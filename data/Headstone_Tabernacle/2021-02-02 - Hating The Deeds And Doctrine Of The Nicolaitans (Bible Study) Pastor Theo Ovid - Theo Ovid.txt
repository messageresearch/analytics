your prayer i'm feeling much better and um have a great relief from that shoulder pain and um i'm just grateful to god tonight so i want to share something with you tonight and i trust the lord that he will bless you and and inspire you and to let you know that um we do have a day of prayer and fast on friday and we're going to climb max that with the zoom permitting on friday that announcement was sent out so if you have your bibles tonight i'd like you to turn to revelation chapter two we want to read one to six and we will read verse 15. know what exactly i've been in revelation and um you just take a break and i will just step in the gap to fill this gap here now but i want to reflect on some things that were shared and spoken from this book of revelation so far so we only look at revelation chapter 2 verse 1 to 6 and then we go to verse 15. it says unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things yet he that holds the seven stars in his right hand who walk it in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works and i labor unlike patience i hold out cancer bear them which are evil and ours tried them which said they apostles and are not and has found them liars and as born and as patients and for my namesake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because that was left thy first love remember therefore for when's the what fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove that candlestick out of his place accept or repent but this thou hast that thou hate us the needs of the the deeds of the nicoletan which i also hate and verse 15 says so as though also them that all the doctrine of the nicolaitan greetings i hate may god bless his word and tonight i want to look and call this hating the deeds the doctrine of the nicolaitans a bible study a view of the ephesians the early church dealing with the seeds of ruination and the key you know sunday we spoke about the two spirits within the free milk of the church we spoke about not only must you know what you are fighting for but you must also know what you are fighting against that's this is very important because if you are not conscious of what the works of the enemy and how he operates you could be deceived you could be fooled it could be trapped but once you know it's coming like a getting revelation of who god is who you are and who the devil is and this is what this is about um god told joshua told the children of israel they come into our land this land is not a clear land it appetizer jebusites a land that is already occupied but the question was or the thing was it belongs to them it was given to them so the challenge was to go and possess it so tonight i want to share something with you on hitting the ds of the nicoleton the d's and the doctrine of the nicolas now the very name ephesus has a strange compound meaning amat and relaxed the high aspirations on this age had begun with the fullness of the spirit the depth of god and whereby they were amen at a high calling of god began to give way to a less watchful attitude a less ardent following of jesus christ begin to manifest itself as a omen that in the future ages the physical vehicle called the church would sink to the awfulness of the depth of satan it had become relaxed and was drifted already the age was backsliding it had left it through his love and there's tiny sparks as i left his first love and the tiny seed planted at that ephesus age would one day grow in the spirit of error until all the false birds of the ear would roost in his branches o blessed be the name of the lord and that is where we find out first identify the spirit of error until the falls both of the air would loosen it branches so inoffensive to human reasoning would that little plant appear to the new eve the new church that again she will be received by satan the ephesians age had presented to her the opportunity for god's best and for a while she prevailed and then relaxed and in that unguarded moment satan planted the seed of complete ruination so therefore satan operates in the same principles and laws that god does planting a seed and then seeing that seed grow and blossom be a fruit okay so here we go proverbs 6 16 to 19. if your bible's getting a mean to proverbs chapter 6 verse 16 to 90. we read these six things that the lord hit ye seven are up an abomination unto him a proud look a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood a heart that divides that wicked imaginations feet that be swift and run into mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he let sweat discord among brethren now that part is very important that last one he that sued discord among brethren god hates that let me see it again god hates that so god is not in this going behind somebody back and planting this and no no he's a soul of the good seed and the seed is the word the seed from god's mouth or prophets is always original let me repeat that the seeds that comes out god's mouth of god's prophet is always original because the original seed is the spoken word and the first man to catch god's word because the bible teaches that uh surely the lord god will do nothing about three seven but reveal it as secrets to serve as the prophets and like brother isaac brought out that we were so far from the sun so to speak god needed seven stars to bounce the light off the stars that we could get access to light so we didn't get it direct we get the light to seven stars seven church ages now understand this when john was seeing the seals white horse redhorse pelos black horse and and suzanne marie alter judgment earthquake and then the seven seal it was symbols john and the enemy looking on or whatever couldn't understand the mystery behind the elect being sealed away in every age i want you to get this in every age the elect was called out and sealed away the devil couldn't get no none really under the ox anointing millions of christians died in the dark ages but that debt was also being sealed away under the anointing of the ox god released the eagle anointing his last day to call out an end-time bride which i believe that we are part of okay so therefore it is important to understand where that seed of discord come from that comes from the enemy this this the seed and if we want to take on the next scripture matthew 13 and we want to look at verse 24 to 30 and we read matthew 13 24 24-30 another parable he put forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and saw tears among the wheat went his way when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared tears also so the servant of the householder came and said unto him sir does that not so good seed and i feel from whence then at it tears he said unto them an enemy had done this the servant said unto him well down then that we go and gather them up but he said knee lease while he up the tears you root up the wheat with them let boat grow together until the harvest one and in the time of the harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tears bind them in bundles burn them guarded the wheat into my ban and jesus completed this parable in matthew 13 go down to 36 to 43 then jesus this is verse 36 of matthew 13 sent the multitude away went into the house and the disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field now remember this parable speaking in parable is jesus taking common stories and hiding mysteries and stories he was a storyteller telling a story telling a parable hiding truths written a story so they said declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field he answered and sent to them he that's what the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom so we convert that there not just seed but they could see that the children of the kingdom and the tears at the churn of the wicked one the enemy that saw them as the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels as therefore the tears are gathered and burn in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as a son in the kingdom of their father who had ears to hear let him hear so brother branham by bringing taking this scripture preach a message called the seed of discrepancy which you identify is a friends that has happened from throughout every age all the way from the beginning it started the very same thing the seed of god is the word of god and then the word is a seed and every seed will bring after its kind now if the christian the children of god the children of the kingdom has become the seed of god then they must be the word of god the word of god manifested in the age that we are living in for the promised seed of that age god gave his word at the beginning and each age had its seed its time and its promises and the people of that age that manifest that promised wood is the seed of that age according to what jesus said right here they are the children of the kingdom so therefore this bright age we call it it is not written in the scriptures about a bright age it's one of the hidden mysteries all they have is seven ages up to laurissia but then here we are talking about another ephesians talking about a prophet who was given a message to turn our hearts back to the fate of the fathers the fate of the fathers in other words we have to go back and pick up what they had so brother branham said this way he talked about uh the lust for knowledge that loss that's what eve ended up having desiring and so on and he said the last call is going to catch the bride before she gets into that he said before the mark of the beast and get doomed come out from among them my people hatred and death and eternal separation from god in this eden of lust filth and perversion by sowing the wrong seed so he said the thing of it is today we don't try to establish the word of god in people's hearts we try we are trying to establish ourselves churches here we go are trying to establish the doctrine of the church in the person's heart let me read it again he said today we don't try to establish the word of god in people's heart we are trying to establish ourselves churches are trying to establish the doctrine of the church in the person's heart but we are commanded to establish the word of god and paul said i didn't come to you with enticing words of man that your faith might rest up in the knowledge of man but i come to you in the power and the manifestation of the holy ghost that your faith might rest in god there you are so man mustn't establish yourself this is about abraham we find it let go do something for a person send them out every man trying to impersonate that they are trying to establish themselves every man i did this me i my my denomination me this establishing themselves what are we preaching about ourselves or the kingdom of god establish the word of god take the out the unbelief and establish the kingdom of god in a man's heart and that kingdom of god cannot be established in a man's heart unless god made a man dust remember the deceitful part is a way to seem right unto a man every intellectual being seem right so here we go what the prophet said is what we see today men trying to establish themselves men trying to establish their slanting message or their doctrine or their teaching what should have the word of god uncompromised uh pure original just comment the prophet's mouth that we could take and apply to our lives and ourselves now paul in acts 20 right in the bible in acts 20 20 to 31 paul was about to leave and paul brought a prophecy and that is where we're going to connect with to get further into the tortoise bible study tonight paul in acts 20 talking to the church from verse 28. he said take heed therefore unto yourselves unto all the flock over which the holy ghost had made you overseers to feed the church of god which had purchased with his blood for i know this that after mighty pattern shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also so he's talking about outside folks but then he's showing them about the inside folks you say also of your own self shall men arise speaking perverse things reason to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i cease not to warn every one of you everyone night and day with tears so paul was prophesying the condition that would come where not only wills will come but right in his message the message of the gospel at that time men would raise up and they would preach and teach and do whatever it necessary to draw people to themselves so we find man is still man man has not changed he's still there with his greed with his lust for power with his lust for position and because the heart is corrupt corrupt it put man in a position where he is accessible to fallen angel spirits let me say that again because man heart is corrupt it put man in a position where he is accessible to fallen angel spirits and evil spirits nobody branham let's continue he said this church talking about branham tabernacle the church itself is built upon the sovereignty of the local church the church itself that's what built on therefore i have nothing to say moving this pastor or putting one in you all are the church you people are the one who control you are the church yourself and the church the holy church of god is here we go the sovereignty of the holy spirit in that church now remember what jesus told peter right he said thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church is not just flinging a brick here and flinging a stone here and flinging a piece of steel here nobody builds a building uh by you know just by his thoughts and fancy they have to have a plan they have to have a vision they have to have a program as how you're going to build if you're building a house you're building a a business or whatever you're building it has to have a map a plan a vision or order in order to build so when jesus said upon this rock i will build my church he was clearly defining an order and a plan of how he wanted that church to be built so brother brown was saying here the holy church of god is the sovereignty of the holy spirit in the church and the church elects their own pastor now being a baptist you remember the reason i kind of stuck with the baptist church was the sovereignty of the local church which i think is apostolic i repeat that he stuck with the baptist church because the baptist church at that time believed in the sovereignty of the local church the baptist church is not a denomination it's not supposed to be it is now but it was not supposedly nomination it's a brotherhood and it's the sovereignty of the local church and if god is ever going to get a message to his man his elder which is according to the bible the highest office of the local church is the elder and and so forth so therefore if god have to speak to that man there's no hindrance it ought to pass through another man worker talk directly to that man therefore there is no one person has nothing to do in this it is the majority of the people now this is ephesians now this is original now this is how it's supposed to be if 20 votes for him and 21 votes against him he goes vice versa that's it it's the sovereignty of the local church each one of the members has a say so in the church anything goes wrong they can come right around and the only thing they have to do is to be before god that they are see that nothing hinders the movement of the church this is the consciousness that all of us must have is not brother over church it's not my church i don't want a church in san diego it's jesus christ we're talking about i serve in that church i'm a servant in that church just like everybody else if god had called me to be in the front pew to be praising and shouting god i will be doing that go call me to minister and preach the word and i do my part i have no part if there's no people to preach to in other words every person in the assembly every person in the church have a power to play because it's god's kingdom we talking about so he said therefore he said now watch so you must ensure that nothing must hinder the moving of the church but the full and complete authority of the church is the pastor if you read that in the bible see that's not bible order there is no one above the elder let me repeat that there is no one above the elder so sovereignty of the church means that the church should not be influenced by any external forces or people or ministry or minister if it's a local assembly based upon the structure and the order presented by that prophet that man who's the local elder or pastor he has to be hearing from god and he has to be speaking as he hears from god to god's people so brother branham says here if there's anything wrong in the church that you ever know or some individual or some person or anything you are duty-bound i will answer before god if you don't clear that thing out you the church now remember it's not on my shoulders it's on yours anything wrong in the church god will make you answer it that's right that's the way he runs his church that's the way it is in the bible that is the order of the bible the sovereignty of the local church the pastor is the head now coming to this blessed will message here i want you to know that this is tip recorded and the tape recorders of the church the orders the rules of the church is untip recorded that's according to the bible we don't run it there's nobody in head no all are we the same we got a leader and listen how we phrased it we got a leader that is the pastor as long as he's led by the holy ghost let me repeat that let me repeat it again we got a leader that is the pastor as long as he is led by the holy ghost praise the lord so how i pray god that it'll be edifying to you tonight and helpful for you tonight that you're seeing your rule and we want to get to something so let's continue for the brand i believe in the supreme authority of the local assembly let each church be its own choose its pastors its deaton whatever it is and in that way the man in deer has no bishop over him the holy spirit wants to speak something to that church they don't have to ask anybody about whether they could do this or that it is the individual in contact with the holy spirit show me in the bible what is greater in the bible than a local elder to a local church that is right the sovereignty of the local church each church in itself now brotherhood that is wonderful all churches ought to be embraced like that for the seventy of the local church so i wanted to put this as a backdrop as we continue luke 22. i want you to find this one if you have a bible luke 22 verse 24 to 27 we want to read that one this is this is important luke 22 and you will see all the disciples were just like the people that we have no this year 2021 who's 24 luke 22 and there was strife among them which is the disciples this is the disciples driving remember there is a room here they have no holy ghost yet they just get anointed they associate with jesus so therefore they have access to miracles powers and what not but here is a piece of a piece of confusion a piece of even going on among them there was strife among them which of them should be haunted the greatest could you imagine that could you imagine jesus jesus is the lord he's the boss he's the king and then among the who who's the greatest who who you think higher than who these men have the holy ocean these men just called anointed and this is let's continue and he said unto them the kings of the gentiles exercise lordship over them and they and they that exercise authority upon them are called many factors in other words if they are a good man you look up to them because they they are the bosses and whatnot he said but he shall not be so now understand this he has preached he is speaking this to the ministers he is speaking this to these apostles to be you're speaking this to these men who have to get the holy ghost to get these foolishness out of them it's striving and who's the greatest all that nonsense you're speaking to them and saying look at the gentiles look how they does be on top one another and they have the authority of one another he said you shall not be so but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is chief as he that does serve for whether it's greater he that sitteth that meat or he that serve it is it not he that sits in that meat but i am among you as he that servant so jesus is telling them listen man i'm the boss i'm in charge and here it is my role is one that serves so this is the backdrop now of where we go into tonight about this nikolaitan this deed and this deed which is the beginning before it became a doctrine and the doctrine becomes flesh and becomes a life it starts with little things little seeds and this deed began the birth of organization and the reason that the church is where it is right now and what we are going through is because of this here this very thing here you see remember in the church age when we opened the first church back there we found out that the holy spirit was against a certain thing that they started in the church age that was called the deeds of the nicolaitan you remember it nikkei means to conquer laity means the church nikolaitan then was to conquer the laity take the holy spirit out of the church and give it all to one holy man let him be the boss of all of it we went through it nicoletan was a saiyan in one church it become a doctrine in the next church age and by the two church age it was an enforcement they had a nice year council let's go out about it again first was i saying you know easy mana dia you know nobody is speaking like him you know wow he's our man and afterwards it was a thought a saying an expression then it becomes a doctrine of course he is the man yeah when he had to get the word to him that is what it comes next and afterwards it was the enforcement at the united council it was made the doctrine of the church and that was the first thing happened an organization from it today he is under the disguisement of the white horse this was on the first scene watch how he changes from the white horse he doesn't only become a white horse and become a beast with many heads and horns the white horse he's a receiver now and that's the reason the people hasn't known it all this time but it's going to be revealed by the scripture now when there's nikolaitan so he's talking about future now when the nicolaitan see the antichrist is finally he is incarnate in a man then he is crowned when he starts off as a nicolaitan spirit in the church he's a spirit you can't crunch a spirit but 300 years later he become a pope and they crong him he had no crown to start with but he got a crown see that is when the spirit become incarnate he become a man nikolaitan the doctrine become a man then they could crumb him they couldn't do it because it was a doctrine so in other words this thing went from deed to doctrine to become incarnate then it could be crown is not something and then brother branham flip the script and bring it on the positive side so watch glory notice when this holy spirit that we have become incarnate to us the one that's in our midst now in the form of the holy ghost become incarnate of us and the person of jesus christ we call him king of kings and lord of us could we give you a hand of praise for that oh praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord you love him tonight blessed be the name of the lord so brother branham quote the scripture and you say my over in john little children i would not have you ignorant for you to know about the antichrist spirit which is already come and is working in the churning of disobedience the antichrist spirit then was beginning to form in the nicoletan spirit to make an organization and this nicolet and spirit the object of it the purpose of it is to conquer the laity because once the ladies conquered listen to this the spirit can move oh hallelujah oh glory to god do you understand that do you understand once the lady is conquered the spirit can't move because they switch the operation of the spirit from the people to the manbini pulpit oh glory hallelujah and the prophet said god is a god of the audience i wanted to get remember it wasn't about moses you know moses was about getting all god's people it has always been about god's people it wasn't about abraham it was abraham's seed it has always been god's people he said they were the children of god and when they came out of egypt they become the church of god so i want to show you that the burden of god is for his people when he say if my people that are called by my name shall humble themselves and he's not talking about pastor and teacher he's not talking about dating he's talking about my people all this past and teacher evangelist was the purpose of that for the perfecting of who these saints which is you oh give god some praises tonight the object of god sending a prophet behold i send you elijah the prophet there's nothing like you to star and take pictures and see what he's actually prophet he shall do something he shall turn the hearts of who you the children that's the object of this whole message the object is to get us back to defeat which is back to the original and the original had no pope had no bishop had no man in the hour it did not have that in the original so now we're gonna get down to why god says i hate it i hate it i hear the deeds i hate the doctrine i hate it i wit you on that i know your fellow from your first love and i know you're struggling know you have works i know this about you i know that but you see i'm with you i wish you on that one we on the same page you hate the deeds of the nicolaita and you hear the doctrine of the neglect i with you on that well hear what this last day bright church going back to fullest love and going back to hating the deeds of the nicolaitan and reduction in nuclear we will not accept anything are going to conquer the laity and press the people that is why you should be praising god tonight that you are free oh hallelujah you're free to worship you're free to praise him you're free to honor him oh hallelujah because you escape oh you're one of the escaped ones oh blessed be the name of the lord all right let's take some more here now the true vine hated the formal deeds of the nicoletas so did god what was this in the ephesians church in the church of ephesians became the doctrine in the programmers church in the ephesus the first church it was a deed in the next church become a doctrine can you hear it can you understand it now it was a deed in ephesus and in pyramus it becomes a doctrine it started in baby form now let's break down the word and he break down the word we know it nico to conquer or overthrow nicolet and still conquer over to the lady what they were trying to do here was trying to take the church where god had pastors and the spirit of god moving by the gifts in the church of the living god oh hallelujah and they were having a doctrine start that they were going to have some priests and bishops and popes so you see all this slighting of the gifts of the spirit gift of wisdom if of healing gift of tongues if of interpretation that is not pentecostal you know that is our thing let me see it again all the nine gifts all the ninefold gifts have to be back in the church so it's not just gifts of pasta teacher profit on a mandated pulpit no it have gifts to move among the people because god wants to show he's the god of israel the god of my people he wants to show his god among his people do you believe that tonight and i want you to be under great expectation to expect all those gifts to come back into the church tongues interpretations prophecies healings all these things it's supposed to be operating among god's people but i'm calling this way mark 16 in action and brother stephen struck it aboard the church near any headstone superchurch super race as they near the headstone this is what this is all about oh blessed be the name of the lord so i trust that it refreshes you tonight to see what god is seeing in this last day he said no so therefore they wanted to have this poop and program he said in other words take all the sacredness all the power from the church and put it on priests let the congregation live the way it wants to by the priests of what he wants taking the holy ghost away from the people with signs wonders following them now let me just say this back again what did the bible say these signs shall follow the pastors no the bible said these signs shall follow who them that believe which is you can you give us some praises for that do you understand that signs supposed to follow the believers it just said these signs shall follow the pastors these signs shall follow the mandarin pulpit no it said these signs shall follow them that belief in my name they shall in my name they shall in my name they shall give the lord some praises so it doesn't have it okay so let's let's back up a little bit old testament levitical priesthood one man oh no one man going once a year to offer sacrifice special man high priest iran high priest once a year israel under tension waiting for this man to come out got to put some rope on him in case he didn't walk right and talk right and he dropped down dead his head that they told him because nobody got one rescue this is a a one-track team that'll be in order bell's ringing anointed right perfume right what you all the drama to go to offer and sprinkle the blood seven times eastward upon the mercy seat oh hallelujah make them feel inspired night hallelujah because the blood was covering sin so you had to wait till the man come victory god gave us a a a sign off for one more year and people had victory when jesus died and the veil was from the top to the bottom and god bust that whole ceremony everything up because the real sacrifice was not on the cross he dismissed this one-man show and this one man going once a year and people don't know the mystery and reveal because the veil was there on calvary cross giving you direct access somebody said direct access stick it back to you direct access not to mary not to joseph not surpassed the holy ali or prophet muhali or teacher holy ali or apostle reality or evangelist holy ali not to none of them but direct access to the blood of calvary that's what he did so therefore the new testament in his blood gave us the passcode to access his presence whereas was debt to go in nor with debt to be out of the presence so the object of you the people is to bring you into presence this is the object of the message to bring you into presence but bring you into church where you come to church and go back home but you're coming to presence where you could be quickened and get active change in your life i like that not just change active change every day something taking place hallelujah oh glory to god you're seeing progress you're seeing improvement you're seeing things changing you're seeing old leaves falling off and new leaves coming in trying to explain how they can't explain when you're growing you're maturing you're writing you're handling trial and testing differently why because you're coming into presence and that's why paul could say i come not with enticing words but i come with the power and demonstration that your faith may not lie on my gift that could bring knowledge and wisdom and revelation to you but that your faith will rise and connect to the power of god or give him praises tonight bless his wonderful name oh hallelujah so watch so therefore taking the holy ghost and swapping it for peace do you see what it was it finally it was deeds and this place had become a doctrine ty tyra it took over luther came out and so on we went right on with that now here's what the prophet said now the pentecostal power or a church that was on pentecost it was quite large at the beginning but they started a denominational spirit coming among them trying to denominate the church which was called the deeds of the nicolet okay and that's the overthrow the the lady and the only one to give the interpreter okay and it was trying to overturn the lady and put all the blessing on only one to read the bible and only one to give the interpretation and would be the bishop or some great head person of the church then we find out the second church age will begin to squeeze me out and then in the third age program pentecost was almost squeezed out but the doctrine of denomination it becomes some days into a doctrine and he says this group here had overpowered the pentecostal group so in other words the original church is a pentecostal church or give the lord some praises your original church the church on the dynamic power the original church is a church like if somebody dropped dead in your church you don't call for bear goes for a home you raise the dead and you continue preaching no it's the calling for belgrus they're calling for some funeral home to pick up the dead that fallen church before i'm saying but the original church which is the church we had to go back to it was a church with power with tongues prophecy with signs with wonders with miracles with healings with visions now you you say i'm saying that from a general perspective but when you're going to jewel what did god prophesy it shall come to pass afterwards that i will pour out my spirit and young men shall see visions all men shall dream dreams upon my handmaidens into commando fight for ministry you're talking about i report my spirit upon all flesh so the promise still is the spirit pouring out the problem was when dynamics fell on pentecostals 1906 all they could have produced was gifts because they didn't have the word because you would come into a prophet so therefore the real adoption power the real manifestation with sons of god couldn't be at that time because the word to produce character wasn't released yet from the monk of that prophet let me say it again dynamics came long in 1906 you know but the world was not there the dynamics that came down in 1906 could only release tongues and healing and all kind i guess no life because only you would have life and that dynamics that came in 1906 was really the dynamics that in effect was bringing about the restoration of the bright tree god was restoring to bring back another original branch oh hallelujah so you're not pentecostal you're not baptist or methodist you belong to this original thing alpha and omega first and the last first church and the last church is the same church you must want nothing less than that oh blessed be the name of the lord do you see it tonight trust to see it tonight so they started with this domination thing and afterwards now they only have one man to give the word interpretation the word and so on and he said this group here overpowered that pentecostal group overcome what the laity when all the holiness goes into some man just some man alone he's the only one and the church can live any way they want to make confession to him the holy ghost is for whosoever laity and all it isn't god you will for it just to be a holy man it's the holy ghost among people so when a narcissist came into the church it wasn't just peter dear it was the operation of the holy ghost the bible said the lord added to the church such as would receive it wasn't just men trying to snatch people off the street like fine fire them inside the church it was god himself putting upon people's heart to get to that church to get under that anointing to get in that group when emphasis gets licks after manifesting poor god the pressure comes down on them and they put licks on them to stop it because they say licks you know human being already you gotta licks you take a timeout instead of taking a timeout you church gather together and they might have prayer meeting oh glory that a holy ghost time premature and the power of god will rock them they get a fresh baptism the bible call it they were refilled with the holy ghost and the prophet said the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost i don't know if you are the elix but one thing i know a good very filling of the holy ghost that's the dynamics it will be refilling of the holy ghost this is what and he said that the churches in that time had so much of the holy ghost and they acted like they didn't have he said if churches no don't have i like to do okay we have to get more hungry we have to get more thirsty we have to get more on the expectation to get back to where we're supposed to be because while abraham came to turn our hearts back to his feet of the fathers back to another ephesians trust tonight you get excited i trust tonight you see it this is what's programmed so listen to this it's taking the power out of the laity and put it upon a minister so wait better over you mean the ladies supposed to have power come on now give me a shout on that one what the scriptures say in acts 1 8 you shall receive power when after the holy ghost come down upon you or after some minister come and share a word with you is after the holiest come upon you the message we have received in books and tips is letter that would have to come alive that would have to come flesh jesus is not coming for books on tapes we could have books from from from the ground to the ceiling that is not really rapture come and you stay among the books you could you can make a book close a book jacket a message pants yeah somebody designed a message shoes for you and all that's not going rapture what going in the rapture is the spirit life and you the magnetism of the holy ghost that's what we have to have because the big rapture magnet coming to pick up those that are connected that are quitting at our life and no man could quit than you think about it think about it the holy ghost alone is the revel revealer of the revelation of jesus christ that is why a man without education could get revelation because it's not man teaching them that is the holy ghost revealing to him that that is why god could bite us all them tribal pharisees and call fishermen and put them in charge of the church mend that guy write their own name put them in charge of the church because they're not operating by intellect they're operating by the pillar of fire wrestling on their shoulder speaking out do you have a lighter man you're like a god sylvan gold have i known peter i go and say i have a training classes yeah how to tell them that oh how would you say this thing it wasn't peter was the hotest agent peter just watched the man look on him oh glory hallelujah you look on him and then the next day he said i perceive you are fit to be healed these guys was breaking into this element i perceive you are fair to be healed rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ because they were doing things jesus didn't even do because he has accepted will you be made whole will you make perfect peter talk that talk peter says sir don't go i want to give it to you i want to give it to you tonight i want to share it with you rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ be free be delivered come out of the darkness come out of blindness this is this is what this is about oh blessed be the name of the lord so watch this here it is take nepal to the lady put it upon a minister of bishop whatever it might be watch the deeds of the nicolaitan overcome the laity and watch i think in a meeting like this it give god a chance to work through the laity and see this is brother branham see the power of god work through the laity oh praise the name of the lord so no man here we go no man on the platform has got a right to say he is the only one that has got the holy ghost and he is the only one got a say so in it the holy spirit is is the whole entire body of christ oh dear where there are tongues interpretations gifts and manifestation holy spirit so no man on the platform have a right to say he's the only one anytime a man say that you know there's problems that is problems big time oh my hallelujah you love him tonight so this is the core here i'm going to speak here to you what are these nicolaitans he said again the two words nico which means to conquer leos which means the laity in plain fact somebody was doing something in that early church which was conquering the laity and if the late he was being conquered then it must have been some authority doing it what was it that god hated that was happening to that church what was going on then and is no going on today is exactly what the word nicoletan means the people here we go the people were being subjected somehow in a way that was absolutely contrary to the word of god you know the bible talk about the famine right in the last days not for books on tips not for bibles not for preachers but for churches they're mortals than ever more barriers than ever more messy people than ever but for hearing the true word of god i ain't talking about but ram tips which we know is that he's not still only prophet i'm talking about people that presented the word the gospel original gospel and he said they will run to the east they will not hear it he said why because of the same organizational spirit the people will not be able to hear it the hearing of the word away think about that there are bibles there are preachers but you're not hearing the word it'll be staffed oh they wouldn't hear the jubilee trumpet the freedom you wouldn't understand it's not the church going in the rapture it's yuri individual rapture and the rapture have to be in you for you to go in the rapture rapture is not external you're acting internal something has to happen on the inside something supernatural has to happen with your life oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god let's continue so what was it that god hated the people was being subjected somehow in a way that was absolutely contrary to the word of god he said the two vines make the church they are like wheat and tears growing up side by side but one is true the other one is false so here we go this might blow your mind now god will speak to each one and he will talk about each one he will call them the church but only the elect will really know which is the true spirit so when he said let the spirit say it unto the churches he'd have a true church and a false church god sent one prophet to boot i wait think about that both claiming profit both claiming the hearing both came in they believe in but one is true or one is false are you with me so this is not skim milk this is serious stuff he said i read it again now god will speak to each one and he will talk about each one he will call them the church but only the elect will really know which is the true spirit only the elect will not be deceived by 24 24. for there shall arise false christs false prophets shall show straight sounds and wonders and so much it will that that will be very possible they shall be seized very like so way back here in the early church a very short period after pentecost the false vine got to entwine itself around the true vine and refine these deeds of the nicoletanes and that spirit is going to be found fighting the true vine until it is destroyed by god now have you got it no it had left its first love leaving its first love of the word of god was revealed to us as having fallen from its origin which was tempting in plain english that means this church was in danger of being taken away from the leading of the holy spirit or the control of the spirit this was exactly what took place after moses led israel out of egypt the way of god was to lead them by the cloud of fire prophetic utterance miracles signs god gave him wonders i think that's worth reading again the way of god to lead him was by cloud of fire prophetic utterance miracles signs god given wonders this was to be accomplished by here we go god selected god ordained god equipped and god sent men with the whole camp being dominated by a holy ghost move so brown went back in the old testament to identify the church back here what it was being governed by cloud by day pillar fire by night prophetic utterance signs wonders miracles so that shadow was a type of what was supposed to be the real thing do you see it tonight so that was the original intent of god and that is what god wanted for his people but listen to this he says then they wanted a king and brother isaac spoke about that they wanted to be exactly like the world and went into complete apostasy and oblivion that is exactly how the food stream started it will get worse and worse until the holy spirit is completely rejected and god must destroy the people so this is prophecy right here he said will get worse and worse until the holy spirit is rejected because man believed that they are god you see always starting early church it was called deeds then become a doctrine it became the standard it became the unbending we it finally took over and god was pushed aside it started so small so quietly so inoffensively it looks so good it seems so sung then it caught a hole like a python snake it squeeze out the very breath and kill all these spirits uh spirituality in the church that false vine is subtle it's like an angel of light until it gets a hole in you now i want to say that i believe in leadership but it is not the leadership of men i believe in i believe in the leadership of the holy ghost coming to the word i believe also that god has sent men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order i believe that and i believe also that the church has ruled over amen and god sends that god sends the big church but that rule is by the word so that is not men really ruling but the spirit of god or the word and spirit of one praise the name of the lord but you see what was happening back there that false vine was getting a hole it was teaching that rulership by man was right it taught that the church had to be governed it brought a control over the people but instead of doing it god's way they simply took authority and vested all the spiritual power in their own hands and came out with a holy priesthood standing between god and the people how much time you're here you have to go to this man to pass through this man if you come to sweden make the bride you alter the bride cut you off you're shocked yours this and that like that and brother branham is saying clearly there is no man between you and your lord there is no person between there at all let me say it again he says and watch and and came up with the holy priesthood standing between god and the people they went right back to the old aeronic system they became antichrist for the disposed of his mediation and imposed their own god hated that the ephesians hated that and any true believer will hate that too we would have to be stone blind not to see that the same thing at work all to the ages and right now it is worst of all what it was it was organization that separated the people what separated the people organization when somebody say i am right everybody else is wrong you say we have this image i know that is wrong it cannot be that because it's not a church it's a kingdom it's not a church it's a bright body it's not one man it's a many member body that god is anointed and inspiring at this particular time okay so when you homostretch god's people are supposed to be one by one spirit are all baptized into one body and every one is to be moved upon by the holy ghost everyone is to participate in the worship of god and repeat that again everyone is to be moved upon by the holy ghost and everyone is to participate in the worship of god but men wanted the preeminence so they took over control and bishops become ash bishops at which imposing titles they bypassed the word of god and taught their own doctrines they got the people to obey them until time came that their way of worship did not in any way resemble the early church after pentecost these deeds were the beginning of apostolic succession on pop sex succession it was one easy and quick step to church membership as a means of saving grace the word was reduced to a creed antichrist spirit by his spirit was predominating the church my so watch you may recall that i brought out an ephesians age that word nicoleta to conquer the lady now why is this such a terrible thing it is terrible because god has never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership which moves with political magnus he has placed his church in the care of god ordained spirit-filled world-living men who lead the people to feeding them the word he has not separated the people into classes so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood it is true that the leadership must be holy but then so must be the whole congregation further there is no place in the world where priests or minister or such many immediate between god and the people let me read it again there is no place in the world where priests or minister mediate between god and the people how in jesus name could a man have a key to your life that is insane that is madness how in the name of god could a minister have the key to your life god holds the key to your life as you look to him he revealed to you what you need to know further there is no place right there's no place in the world where priests are minister or such means reading gone people nor is there a place where they are separated in their worship of the lord god wants all to love and serve them together nikolaitism destroyed those precepts and instead separates the ministers from the people and makes the leaders overlords instead of sylvans that would repeat and again nikolaitism destroyed those precepts and instead separates the ministers and the people and make the leaders overlords instead of servants this doctrine started in the first age where and what you saw happen it appears that the problem lay in two words elders and overseers which were bishops those scriptures show that there are several elders in each church some began to teach that the idea of a bishop was one of preeminence or authority and control over the elders now the truth of the matter is the word elder signifies who the person is while the word bishop signifies the office of that same man the elder is the man the bishop is the office of the man the elder always has and always will refer simply to the man's chronological age in the lord he's an elder not because he's elected ordained but because he's older he is more seasoned trained not a novice reliable because of experience and long-standing proof of his christian experience but no the bishops did not stick to the epistle of paul but rather they went to paul's account so they take a paul story of the time he went and called the eldest of ephesus the military in acts 20 in verse 17 the record state elders were called and then in verse 28 they are called overseers bishops and these bishops no doubt political minded and anxious for power insisted that paul had given the meaning that overseers were more than local elder with the official capacity only in his own church to them bishop was not one with extended authority over many local leaders such concept apparently so the bishop that they took up was one not only over their own churches but over many local leaders such a concept was neither scriptural nor historical yet even a man of the statue of polycarp lean to what such organization but isaac spoke about that in his last surface thus what started as a deed in the first age was made a literal doctrine and so it is today bishops still claim power to control men and deal with them as they desire placing them where they so will in the ministry this denies the leadership of the holy ghost who said separate me paul and barnabas for the work we're into i have called him this is andy wood and antichrist and brother i'm quote this beautiful scripture matthew 20 verse 25 says and jesus called unto them and said you know so this is the next scripture that parallel to one i spoke early on you know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are a great exercise authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but a minister to give his life a ransom for many matthew 23 8-9 be not be called rabbi oh one is your master even christ your old brethren so in order to clarify you will recall in revelation 13 3 it said i saw one of the heads it was only to death and his deadly wound was healed we know he's a catholic church woman empire that head rose again she divided and conquered that was the seed of rome divide and conquer the iron teeth tore and evolved whom she tore and devoured could not rise again and as she destroyed carthage and sowed his heart assault the same iron seed remains in her when she arose as the false church and the policy has remained the same divide and conquer that is nikolaitism and god hits it now it is well known you know what if it wrap up now it is well known historical fact that when this error crept into the church men began to vie for the office of bishop where the result that this position was being given to the more educated materially progressive politically minded men human knowledge and program began to take over divine wisdom's place and the holy spirit no longer controlled this was indeed a tragic evil for the bishops began to maintain that is no longer required a transparent christian character to minister either the word or the right of the church for it was the elements and the ceremony had counted this allowed evil men see juices to render flock but man-made doctrine on the elevation of bishops to a place not according to them in the scripture the next step was the handling out of greedy titles that built up into religious hierarchy for soon there were archbishop over bishops cardinals over archbishops and by the time bonnie faced the third there was a pope overall all the pontiffs let me talk about message pope i'm closing this off let's come back to you the believers no a minister cannot bring a revival there is no preacher can bring a revival he doesn't pack it with him the only thing he can do is be loyal to god and to his word but the revival has to come by the people in your home and in your life and here you are right now tonight you are in your home and here's a prophecy hanging over you here's a direct word that a minister can revive no man of the hour no this one it takes revival enough to come by the people so i always believe that the vision of god has to be transferred to the people if i hold the vision and i am the man and the only man and whatnot what you have what you have to see when you get the revelation that you are the people of god hallelujah peculiar people come out all the darkness into this marvelous light where god put the keys in your hands to start a seventh on the revival right inside your house right inside your home even tonight even this week let us speak be a special week let tonight be a special night where the blessings of god could come upon your heart and life when you don't look inside and just look at yourself your failures your short comments your weakness but you look at the promise of god what we speak in the night is what god promised i you know one of the bible sessions i really enjoyed when it was um but isaac was speaking about neighborhood and jezebel and about rehab and he lusting after the man feel and jesus will come and set it up to kill the man to take me back for you and this god receiver is a just god that might matter be poor that might might mean no king assistant to no recognized person but because of the even wickedness god sent elijah to deal with that whole situation we say but just gone you go wrong you get in trouble and whatnot you repent that just god come to help you and deliver you because you're willing to repent you're willing to make things right you're willing to correct on the streets of your ways he said if my people whoever forget that shall humble themselves until i would heal the lamb is that man talking that is god talking god is just he wouldn't let this bride just suffer he going to bring her through and i'm telling you the one who started working you need to finish what you hear he's able to complete it give him praises tonight open your mouth and give god some praises we're going to be finishing here now brother branham let a little flock let that little remnant he's talking about brother branham you talking about elijah let that little remnant that god will give him let that little remnant go to calling out to god watch what happens you'll be a national showdown there will be a power that i've never seen before and the final thing i have to read is some jewel too and i'll restore to you the years that the lucas had eaten the conquer worm the caterpillar the palmer my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that i just wanted you with you and my people shall never be ashamed my people again and he shall know glory that i am in the midst of israel that i am the lord your god and none else and my people that's who you are tonight shall never be ashamed i shall come to pass afterwards that i'll pour my spirit upon all flesh your sons your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men chastity visions and also upon the servants upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit and i will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood fire pillars of smoke sun shall be turned into darkness the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the lord it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call the name of the lord shall be delivered for monk zion and in jerusalem shall be deliverance as the lord had said and in the remnant of the lord god shall call may god bless his will to your heart tonight friends on a restoration path when the devil eat down god's tree god purposed to restore and in that restoration nothing was going to stop it he eat on luther branch wesley branch push up he eat down the wesley branch the pentecostal branch push up he down the pentecostal branch he come but around the wood and devil will break his seat on the wood he can't eat that dog go say i am going to restore nothing going to stop the restoration of this bride i want you to see tonight what god called you out of you not only have to know what you're fighting for you have to clearly know what you're fighting against let's pause oh blessed be the name of the lord heavenly father i thank you tonight for the truth of your word this is how the church fell it fell by the spirit moving away from the people and going unto men and men who love power they arrested and stopped the flow of the spirit because the channel of the world was broken you hate organization you hit breaking of the sovereignty of the local church you hate this the deed of the nicolaitans you hear the doctrine of the nicoleta you hate it and we hate it all so far we have been frightened and standing for what we know to be the truth of the word that nobody outside to tell us we have to do it this way that way and that's all the messages and how this no we have to be led by god led by the holy spirit this is how we felt let tonight to present this to your people that it will anchor and ricochet in their souls we love you tonight we love your word we love your people we love the chorus lord we pray that that love will grow stronger every day love for truth love for righteousness love for god to love what god love and to hate what god hate father made his teaching be something special to your people that they can see clearly that god is the god of the audience and if the holy ghost is to come is to come among your people father so make us servants real servants genuine servants make us humble servants humble hearts that would wait upon you because you did stay in your wood you take a humble heart dedicated god to bring jesus christ into present tense brother visit him with your love a presence bless the service tomorrow they're going to be streamed and father bless the time of prayer and fast and friday and the prayer meeting on friday to resume we glorify your name and bless you in advance of what you're about to do and what you're doing and jesus might ask it amen and amen god bless your saints thanks for being here i trust them that you were edified and you were helped and you were blessed but god is in the word and god is the people that ephesians church found those who say they were apostles and found them to be liars it wasn't the ministers that was doing that it was the believers that was doing that and baraban said they were telling those so-called apostles you're not saying what paul's preached you're not saying what paul spoke you're there for your faults so these believers were anchored by the word that came out from paul's mouth because paul said if i angel come from heaven and preach any other gospel let them fly back then go back where you come from let them be a curse they were standing for the word and for truth and i want you to be like that a solid ephesians bunch this is may god bless you see you thanks again for coming god bless you
