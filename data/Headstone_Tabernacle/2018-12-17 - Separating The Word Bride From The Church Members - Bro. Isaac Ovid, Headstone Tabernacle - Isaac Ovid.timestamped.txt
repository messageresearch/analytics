[37:04] whoremongers and murderers and idolaters
[37:06] and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie I
[37:09] Jesus have sent mine angel to testify
[37:13] unto you these things in the churches I

[37:35] book If any man shall add unto these
[37:38] things God shall add unto Him the
[37:40] plagues that are written in this book
[37:42] and if any man shall take away from the
[37:45] words of the book of this prophecy God
[37:47] shall take away his part out of the book
[37:50] of life and out of the holy city and
[37:52] from the things which are written in
[37:54] this book he which testified these
[37:57] things say it surely I come quickly amen
[38:01] even so come Lord Jesus he may be seated
[38:05] in the presence of the Lord today
[38:08] greeting once again so for a title this
[38:12] morning and you're gonna have to help me
[38:13] preach this morning I don't know what
[38:17] type of virus they've been cooking up
[38:19] but
[38:20] people have been going with the cool and
[38:23] the flu and different things but the
[38:24] enemy is defeated and we're not gonna
[38:27] let no rock don't share our praise me
[38:30] we're gonna keep the devil on the ropes
[38:32] because whenever your taxes because he's
[38:35] afraid when every the taxes because you
[38:38] know something is about to happen so we
[38:40] are here and the president of the Lord
[38:41] this morning to worship God to give Him
[38:45] praise to give Him glory to recognize
[38:48] that what we are seeing is modern events
[38:50] made clear by prophecy that God is not
[38:52] surprised and we ought not to be
[38:54] surprised because the word has clearly
[38:56] declared what is supposed to be
[38:58] happening this great season of we're
[39:01] living in you men so for a title this
[39:04] morning separating the word bride from
[39:08] the church members separating the word
[39:11] bride from the church members and an
[39:15] inspiration the identification of the
[39:17] true believers and an inspiration only
[39:21] the elect have the ability to hear from
[39:24] God and the church say Amen and have a
[39:28] closing theme if I call it that for 2018
[39:33] going into 2019 no more excuses can the
[39:37] church say mmm you want to give a
[39:40] hundred percent we want to give our all
[39:42] as we prepare to leave this place
[39:45] amen amen amen no brother man I'm told
[39:48] us in every church there are three kinds
[39:50] of believers we know this they are
[39:53] unbelievers in the church they are make
[39:55] believers in the church and they are
[39:56] true believers in the church this is why
[39:59] you can't judge a church by who's in the
[40:01] church because in the church are three
[40:03] kinds of believers people act all kind
[40:06] of strange ways you don't know who they
[40:08] are they may just be a make believer
[40:10] people act funny to you you don't know
[40:12] they may be an unbeliever they are in
[40:13] church but they are unbelievers in the
[40:15] church they are made believers in the
[40:17] church but through the prophetic
[40:19] ministry of brother Branham he
[40:20] identified that they are also true
[40:23] believers in the church and these true
[40:25] believers have an identification there's
[40:27] something about them that lets you know
[40:30] that they are true
[40:31] there's something about you that lets
[40:33] you know if you're a true believer if
[40:35] you're make believer or if you're an
[40:36] unbeliever can the church say mmm it is
[40:40] for this reason no Church can claim to
[40:43] be a holy church because brother Branham
[40:44] said in every Church has three kinds of
[40:46] believers so that levels are playing
[40:49] fields of churches because in any church
[40:50] they could be a true believer unbeliever
[40:53] and a big believer we can measure the
[40:55] church man who's in it you measure the
[40:57] church by individuals who have the
[40:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost who are
[41:01] pressing for perfection who are pressing
[41:03] for something more than they had
[41:05] yesterday who are willing to separate
[41:07] themselves from the things of the world
[41:09] who are willing to cover the time to get
[41:13] into the message of the hour to realize
[41:15] that this world is finished to realize
[41:18] that America is in its place and Russia
[41:21] isn't its place and China is in its
[41:23] place and the government is in the
[41:25] police and the economy is in its place
[41:26] and the bride of Jesus Christ has to get
[41:29] into her place
[41:30] [Applause]
[41:33] hallelujah and God has always been about
[41:36] separating he is a separator and his
[41:39] separation is about word Brian and other
[41:42] believers of the separation has to come
[41:44] because the rapture is the great
[41:47] separation we can repeat about culture
[41:49] we could talk about scriptures but
[41:51] there's a real rapture just as there's a
[41:53] real judgment there's a real promise to
[41:57] individuals who won the promise up but
[41:59] if you wanna stay here he who is filthy
[42:01] you can be filthy still he who is
[42:03] righteous you can be right yourself you
[42:06] who want to be a real Christian a real
[42:09] Christian still you said behold I come
[42:12] quickly and I'm bringing my reward with
[42:15] me oh you don't have to wait for the
[42:16] reward when you see me come I have my
[42:19] reward with me to give every man
[42:21] according to your worship to give every
[42:24] man according to your prayer life to
[42:26] give every man according to how you read
[42:28] the scripture like if every man
[42:31] how you live this message how you live
[42:33] this message in your home how you live
[42:35] this message in your job how you live
[42:38] this message when the pressure comes Oh
[42:40] [Music]
[42:41] hallelujah
[42:43] somebody say madam you may be seated and
[42:46] I was thinking just the other day that
[42:48] your problems are a test and your
[42:51] blessings are also a test now that's
[42:54] deep because people don't see their
[42:56] blessing as a test they see the problem
[42:58] as a test so they see the pressure as
[43:00] the test but your pressures our test
[43:02] just as your blessings are tested
[43:04] because God is looking for somebody
[43:06] the more he blesses the more humble they
[43:09] become so even if your blessing you are
[43:11] being tested every step you take you are
[43:14] being tested to see if you could be
[43:17] counted worthy of this great glory to
[43:19] see if you become somebody help me this
[43:23] morning
[43:24] [Music]
[43:26] no wonder the Bible says haven't done
[43:29] all to stand stand after you've done
[43:35] everything to stand then stand after
[43:40] your position yourself still stand after
[43:43] your prey it's tandem and against the
[43:46] temptation stand against lust stand
[43:49] against evil stand against disrespect
[43:51] and against gossip stand against the
[43:54] styles and the fashion and again no
[43:56] prayer life and the canceled movies
[43:59] stand there cancel worldly desires stand
[44:02] against being an ordinary Christian we
[44:07] don't want to be a church member you can
[44:09] be a member of any Church I want to be
[44:11] in the word bride because only the world
[44:14] bride makes a rapture Oh
[44:17] whether you fellowship and Isaac I
[44:20] fellowship in Christ Jesus because
[44:22] that's the identification of the word
[44:24] pride to many church members
[44:29] it's easy to be a church member oh you
[44:33] get about Sunday morning and you make
[44:34] sure you all dressed and you get ready
[44:36] at your church your church member nobody
[44:39] holds you accountable but what bride is
[44:41] different what bride means you can stand
[44:44] the test good brides me if you lose your
[44:46] job that doesn't move you what Bryan
[44:49] means if you lose family that doesn't
[44:51] move you will bribe me City chose you in
[44:53] a bed of sickness that doesn't move you
[44:55] oh good bride means if he tells your
[44:58] family against you that doesn't move you
[45:00] because you are measuring your life not
[45:03] by your expectations not by what you
[45:05] want but by water wood sensor that's
[45:08] would ride would bribe me you can stand
[45:11] the test but that will show something at
[45:13] you you can stand the test and say no
[45:16] I'm a word pride the teletransport not
[45:19] girly at you you say no I'm word right
[45:21] the Tevatron he can say that you know
[45:24] I'm a word bride the devil chose for
[45:26] instruction at you know I'm a word bride
[45:29] my room is sealed up I could take no
[45:31] other serum I have already impregnated
[45:34] by the original theater the original
[45:37] life from the original message the
[45:39] original power and I'm under expectation
[45:42] but the same science but the same
[45:45] wonders for the same miracles for the
[45:48] same power for the same anointing for
[45:50] the same glory but the same fire for the
[45:54] same spirit somebody say man
[45:59] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah real
[46:05] christians christians who can worship
[46:07] when things I could Christians who've
[46:09] been worship when things are bad
[46:10] Christians who could worship on the way
[46:12] to the bank because we could worship
[46:14] when you hear I have no money in the
[46:15] back that's a real word bride it doesn't
[46:18] matter these natural circumstances but
[46:21] your eyes are fixed to where you're
[46:24] going not where you come from not where
[46:26] you are now but every day I'm going
[46:29] somewhere I'm going somewhere I'm going
[46:32] somewhere come and go with me through my
[46:35] father
[46:36] house if you don't want to go don't hit
[46:39] me but I'm going somewhere Oh hallelujah
[46:48] hallelujah and every Church three kinds
[46:52] of believers
[46:52] what kind of believer are you today the
[46:55] unbeliever is in church but they don't
[46:57] believe the unbeliever is in church but
[47:00] when they hear you shall receive the
[47:02] Holy Ghost they don't think it's for
[47:03] them the unbelievers in church but when
[47:06] they hear the word it doesn't rest well
[47:08] with them
[47:09] that's the unbeliever the unbeliever dig
[47:11] they can worship don't get me wrong
[47:13] naked worship but when it comes to
[47:15] living something they have a trouble put
[47:17] it into action because if you really
[47:19] believe you will go into action well
[47:21] somebody helped me to smaller may your
[47:24] feet rise that's true believers this
[47:27] morning to possess your God given
[47:29] inheritance can the church say Amen to
[47:35] make believer that's a strange one
[47:37] that's the one you almost think it'll
[47:40] make it they got everything right but
[47:42] they are putting on a good show good
[47:46] actors good actors things are wrong but
[47:50] it not letting anybody know anything is
[47:51] wrong me believe in me believing it's
[47:55] all right me believing it's okay
[47:57] but the true believer when you fall like
[48:00] them like a sheep that falls into the
[48:03] mud your cries not afraid to cry not
[48:06] afraid to run to the altar and see a
[48:09] pastor I messed up I want to be restored
[48:11] because I want to be right with God
[48:13] that's the true believer not true just
[48:16] in your external action but true in
[48:18] spirit ah true and how you communicate
[48:20] true in your prayer life you may be
[48:25] seated
[48:26] hallelujah
[48:29] I heard somebody say recently I think I
[48:32] read it how it's interesting when people
[48:36] are praying and you're praying for
[48:38] somebody else you could pray loudly Lord
[48:44] my brother Lord you know he needs the
[48:46] liver and me you break whatever is
[48:48] pulling him and and when it's time to
[48:50] pray for yourself because you don't want
[49:01] nobody to know what's going on in your
[49:02] life I'm not putting believers into any
[49:08] category but I'm just saying there's
[49:10] something about being real blind
[49:14] bartimaeus was really Jesus son of David
[49:18] have mercy on me I'm in trouble I can't
[49:23] go on tomorrow this same way I can't
[49:25] reach tomorrow in this condition I came
[49:28] to church for a reason I didn't come to
[49:30] be seen at a cover shake hand but I came
[49:33] because I need a touch I can't I can't
[49:35] face this season I can't face my job
[49:38] this week it's a reality
[49:45] [Applause]
[49:46] [Music]
[49:48] somebody helped us this morning God has
[50:01] taken a picture who is filthy filthy
[50:04] still if we know when the picture is to
[50:09] be taken then that's fine then we could
[50:11] pose for the picture but the problem is
[50:15] we don't know when the picture is gonna
[50:17] be taken where he who is righteous be
[50:21] righteous still if we can get a glimpse
[50:24] into the mind of God so when it'll
[50:26] happen then we make sure that we be
[50:28] righteous because God please listen the
[50:32] seeds of permanence but that's a season
[50:37] we are into because there's no more time
[50:39] left we really run out of time and the
[50:44] message has always been be ready be
[50:48] ready and then the question is are you
[50:50] ready this is not as a church now as an
[50:54] individual because it's a separation
[50:56] going on this morning between church
[50:58] members and between the word bride the
[51:02] scripture reread says if you add
[51:04] anything your name is seeking out if you
[51:10] take away something he has no part with
[51:13] you it has to be this word in its
[51:16] entirety and nothing less Lord what does
[51:20] the word see about me today what does a
[51:23] lower expect about us today can the
[51:26] church same and
[51:27] so I want to take my time this morning
[51:30] most companies are slowing down for the
[51:33] season and so we don't have too much in
[51:36] the natural to worry about this morning
[51:39] isn't that right so I don't have the
[51:43] energy I normally wear better mic so I'm
[51:46] gonna take my time this morning from the
[51:48] message the queen of sheba but the band
[51:49] said some people look at their symptoms
[51:51] my pastor prayed for me last night but
[51:54] my hands know better that has nothing to
[51:56] do with it if you are really a believer
[51:58] then you don't even look at that it's
[52:00] already settled forever God healed you
[52:03] bastards
[52:03] what if Abraham would have looked that
[52:06] next month to see if Sarah was going to
[52:08] have the baby he'll never notice it he
[52:11] just noticed what God said and any true
[52:13] believer looks to the promise not what
[52:16] symptoms are around them they look what
[52:19] God said and in praying but I ran and
[52:22] said I mean know Lord that that church
[52:23] is not in the majority this morning the
[52:26] true believers are in the minority but
[52:29] someday Lord you will take that minority
[52:31] to yourself can the church say Amen and
[52:35] the message might kind of profit by the
[52:37] balance that all true profits are all
[52:40] true Christians all true believers stay
[52:43] with that would no matter what anybody
[52:45] says you stay with the word no matter
[52:47] what your wife says your mother your
[52:49] sister your brother your name up they
[52:51] see the deeds of miracles as past don't
[52:53] you believe it for the Bible said he's
[52:55] the same yesterday today and forever
[52:57] you tell you have to dress a certain way
[52:59] they're fitted on your job you don't
[53:01] believe it because the wood tells you
[53:03] differently in this Christmas season
[53:04] they tell you you have to attend up the
[53:06] events in work or whatever it is you
[53:08] don't believe it
[53:10] because there's a word promised over you
[53:11] and it's a word covenant over you
[53:14] proving his worth notice it was by his
[53:17] believers that he proves his would he
[53:20] can only prove his worth not by
[53:22] unbelievers it's only by believers that
[53:24] he can prove his would no matter how
[53:27] much of the rest of them claim to be oh
[53:29] I believe brother see if you do God will
[53:31] prove it it's by true believers that he
[53:35] proves his would not those who say
[53:37] didn't believe but those who really
[53:41] believe it's by his believing children
[53:43] that he proved his would oh my my my
[53:47] mind listen to the Prophet know he had
[53:49] believers do all crop my died off the
[53:51] unbelievers who said we couldn't take it
[53:54] he let every one of them perish why
[53:56] every one of them but the believers who
[53:58] was left Moses have been taken to glory
[54:00] and the unbelievers have perished in the
[54:02] wilderness and this was their children
[54:05] they were only two that crossed over and
[54:07] that was the believers Joshua and Caleb
[54:09] and that's how what type
[54:11] he was the believers they was the ones
[54:13] who cross over it's the only way court
[54:16] can do it is by his believing children
[54:18] you believe that
[54:19] now those tune of Israel left Egypt from
[54:22] this morning on Church is about two
[54:24] million strong they all journey together
[54:27] they all sort of see miracles of God all
[54:30] partook of the same manner and water
[54:33] from the smitten Rock all full of the
[54:35] seen cloud by day and the pillar of fire
[54:37] by night but only to reach the promised
[54:40] land only two were true or real
[54:42] believers that is correct because the
[54:44] word tells us that the rest died because
[54:47] of unbelief and because of unbelief they
[54:51] could not enter in then since that is so
[54:54] and only to enter then the rest were not
[54:56] true believers what made the difference
[54:59] to stayed with the wood when the heart
[55:02] of the ten spies fear that Kira's Barnea
[55:05] Joshua and Caleb did not stagger for
[55:07] they believed the word and said we are
[55:09] more than able to take the land they
[55:11] knew they could because God had said I
[55:13] have given you the land after all those
[55:16] Israelites saw of the power and goodness
[55:19] and deliverance of God he did not enter
[55:22] rest which is a type of the Holy Ghost
[55:25] so they all left Egypt they all
[55:28] celebrated even Egypt he saw miracles
[55:31] they saw water from the rock he saw
[55:33] healings and they did not enter the Holy
[55:35] Ghost land because only their true
[55:38] believers enter the holy ghost land he
[55:40] knew about the land they had heard a
[55:42] pouter land he heard stories of the land
[55:45] but when they keep the kiddies Vanille
[55:47] to enter into the rest the rest of the
[55:50] spirit oh come on now only can a man
[55:53] just swap despite the opposition despite
[55:57] the opposition said we are more than
[55:59] able this is what we came to church for
[56:02] to get the Holy Ghost
[56:04] what giants are you talking about what
[56:06] time is he talking about what sickness
[56:08] you're talking about what problem in my
[56:10] family you're talking about what mistake
[56:13] what failure this movie goes promise
[56:15] land is my land I'm going to possess it
[56:18] I'm gonna cream it so you can see right
[56:26] now listen to the Prophet carefully now
[56:27] and this is the junction we have so you
[56:29] can see right now that very few will
[56:32] ever believe all the way to receiving
[56:35] the Spirit of God and that's the great
[56:41] showdown to receive the Spirit of God
[56:44] that's what we are here striving so claw
[56:47] can enter a new heart a new spirit he is
[56:50] spirit now when they left Egypt for the
[56:56] currents they believed they were going
[56:58] somewhere but your belief is tested by
[57:02] the opposition your belief the depth of
[57:06] your belief is if you give up or if you
[57:10] hold on the depth of your belief is if
[57:13] you backslide or if you pick up yourself
[57:15] and say I'm going to keep on pressing
[57:18] it's not about a mistakes if you get
[57:21] back up but just won't hear them they
[57:24] said we are more than able we are more
[57:26] than able we have come too far to turn
[57:29] back now we have been to too many
[57:31] services to go back with nothing too
[57:36] many years 2019 is around the corner
[57:39] this time is the time for the
[57:41] inheritance to be divided up have
[57:44] children that's coming lovelyz has
[57:46] coming don't tell me about these giants
[57:49] we can take them we can handle them
[57:52] but the planner said Caleb took a box
[57:54] and stir up on Uproxx he was no great
[57:56] big slowly up but his belief was big
[57:59] his faith was strong he believed and he
[58:02] could do it
[58:02] and this morning I believe we can have a
[58:04] revival this morning I could believe
[58:07] that you can be delivered I believe your
[58:09] sickness your tout your fear we could
[58:13] kill at the T not even tomorrow to team

[58:30] tears they're gonna be the last service

[58:34] service we don't even know because he
[58:36] said I come quickly and my reward will
[58:39] be with me Oh it'll be a straw quick
[58:41] message and I'll shake the whole nation

[58:54] bring a reward he will bring a blessing
[58:57] he will bring a change in your soul it
[58:59] will be not by might nor by power but by
[59:02] my spirit saith the Lord

[1:04:52] the natural eye you can't look at it
[1:04:55] from a kind of perspective you can't
[1:04:57] just turn on the news and see what's

[1:05:23] still calling from the east from the
[1:05:24] west from the north from the south
[1:05:26] [Applause]
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:05:29] [Applause]
[1:05:32] you rarely see them and frankly realize
[1:05:35] quarters doing the calling you cannot
[1:05:37] come to this mess unless God calls you
[1:05:39] you got me invited to this room
[1:05:42] nobody can invite you to this you know
[1:05:45] this is like this white man's invitation
[1:05:47] you can invite everybody unless the seat
[1:05:50] in there so they can never see this
[1:05:51] thing you can invite a pope you can
[1:05:55] invite the president you can apply the
[1:05:56] Prime Minister if there's no seed in
[1:05:58] their soul they can sit there for every
[1:06:00] service they can come to us every single
[1:06:03] team if there's no scene in their soul
[1:06:05] they get nothing but you are here to
[1:06:07] spawning is what I've seen in your soul
[1:06:09] now when the word goes forth something
[1:06:12] connects gonna see Germany of soul you
[1:06:19] maybe see them what is it I said into it
[1:06:29] is it's like a wife I was like yeah
[1:06:33] there's a cell phone you know when you
[1:06:35] go so many any mountain you lose
[1:06:37] reception anybody ever explain any of
[1:06:41] you drive somewhere American like
[1:06:42] Whitman I'm totally technologically
[1:06:44] advanced I realize I have no reception
[1:06:47] no signal so when you're bored in this
[1:06:50] world you're born with no signal
[1:06:54] but some of your porn with still put it
[1:06:56] with a food in your heart but when
[1:06:59] you're born you have no signal and
[1:07:01] you're living your life with no signal
[1:07:02] so you just drive around aimlessly
[1:07:03] nobody know what you are you never get a
[1:07:06] phone call you never get a text you know
[1:07:08] yo what's up your phone dead
[1:07:10] but then something a word is spoken as
[1:07:14] when a Kangol e said last week he was a
[1:07:16] young man walking his up what a
[1:07:18] spin looking he was searching his hat
[1:07:21] for something you read this you eat a
[1:07:23] piece of but he's a young man
[1:07:24] talking and all of a suddenly he
[1:07:27] receptor his short come alive man I'll
[1:07:30] never feel that before this thing this
[1:07:32] thing he didn't put it in him it was
[1:07:34] there all along
[1:07:35] he didn't know he had it but it was
[1:07:37] there all along so when people come into
[1:07:42] this glorious tabernacle if they have a
[1:07:44] receptor they're gonna respond if
[1:07:46] there's no receptor you don't know how
[1:07:48] to respond but thank god there's a
[1:07:51] receptor in your soul and when the word
[1:07:53] of god is spoken you can say yes yes yes
[1:07:56] yes Amen that's me that's my name I'm
[1:08:00] born to overcome I'm going to be a
[1:08:03] conqueror I'm born to receive the Holy
[1:08:05] Ghost I'm going to have joy destroyer
[1:08:10] have the world didn't give it to me this
[1:08:13] piece I have the world didn't give it to
[1:08:15] me and the world cannot take it away
[1:08:17] because that receptor that Jim not fall
[1:08:20] in my heart I didn't even put it here I
[1:08:23] can't even take it over on one two
[1:08:25] [Applause]
[1:08:40] can the message the spoke away the
[1:08:42] original seed now let us stand like
[1:08:45] Joshua and Caleb as we see the Promised
[1:08:48] Land coming in sight you have to see the
[1:08:51] Promised Land coming in sight not Santa
[1:08:54] Claus come with the town nor the
[1:08:55] promised land coming in sight not the
[1:09:00] razor PA coming inside didn't get that
[1:09:01] tongue Lord but you have to see the
[1:09:03] promised land coming in sight because if
[1:09:07] you see the Promised Land coming in
[1:09:08] sight you make preparations for the
[1:09:10] Promised Land coming inside its nearing
[1:09:14] the time to be given just when Hebrew
[1:09:16] means Savior and it represents the
[1:09:18] promise and time to take the church over
[1:09:21] caleb represents a true believer who
[1:09:24] stayed with Joshua God started Israel as
[1:09:27] a virgin with his word but they wanted
[1:09:29] something different so did the last day
[1:09:31] Church conan's in sportage original seed

[1:10:00] Christmas I'm not no not this year
[1:10:04] well they're not getting me this year

[1:10:24] all Christmas morning breathless batches

[1:10:40] [Applause]
[1:10:44] I'm and many times and it happens
[1:10:47] unconsciously you don't know it says
[1:10:48] some of you tired I think was Tennessee
[1:10:50] even had something good and I was tired
[1:10:52] and then when Irish we're going some
[1:10:54] retired years go it's not he had no
[1:10:56] longer I don't know but his printable
[1:10:59] thing get on you it has people get tired
[1:11:04] I want me every time I see good food
[1:11:06] suddenly no feel they don't know any
[1:11:09] time is gone
[1:11:11] and I just feel inspired say I know it
[1:11:17] happens we say you're hungry no I'm not
[1:11:19] I'm not hungry ok cool
[1:11:21] and then I really say well who who's
[1:11:23] Adam but what you say you're not hungry
[1:11:26] the spirit anything
[1:11:29] I'm gonna pranam said winning a ballgame
[1:11:31] this is brother branham did you see
[1:11:33] example when y'all Boyle came you have
[1:11:34] to get any spirit of it it's a horrible
[1:11:37] thing to be in a ballgame and then you
[1:11:39] there you are the only put in there and
[1:11:40] you and everybody as they look like
[1:11:43] nothing else going on and it's so
[1:11:45] important we come into the house of God
[1:11:47] we come to the house of God to get in
[1:11:49] the spirit of trying a saggy negativity
[1:11:53] when you're working natural news is
[1:11:56] murder as this is negativity who get
[1:11:58] kidnapped who do this somebody want to
[1:12:00] really news could have nothing to hide
[1:12:03] nothing to edify us didn't make you know
[1:12:04] but when it come here it's only good
[1:12:06] news honey that's the money only healing
[1:12:10] honey deliverance and they being
[1:12:14] reminded of where you come from reminded
[1:12:17] of what you're going tell the church
[1:12:19] amen
[1:12:25] hmm from a message proving his word now
[1:12:33] I want you to notice he does it that way
[1:12:34] in every age he does it every time by
[1:12:38] the same method he has to take believers
[1:12:40] so God is looking for true believers
[1:12:42] this morning what we call word right not
[1:12:45] church members and then in order to have
[1:12:47] believers to meet that word he's got to
[1:12:49] predestinated in that age that's what
[1:12:52] makes the destination so powerful
[1:12:54] because predestination means that God
[1:12:56] did the choosing he said you have not
[1:12:59] chosen me but I have chosen you my sheep
[1:13:04] know my voice and a stranger they would
[1:13:07] not follow so there's something in you
[1:13:09] that's pulling you even when people talk
[1:13:12] to you there's something saying no
[1:13:14] that's not right because you're not
[1:13:17] hearing his voice because my sheep know
[1:13:20] my voice so true is worrying when
[1:13:22] somebody could preach and they can say
[1:13:24] nice things but I'm not hearing his
[1:13:25] voice because his word is an expression
[1:13:28] of his voice scripture is an expression
[1:13:31] of his voice the scripture is the
[1:13:33] written form of his voice everybody with
[1:13:36] me this morning so what made the
[1:13:39] prophetic ministry the prophetic
[1:13:41] ministry is that brother Branham wasn't
[1:13:43] speaking his thoughts he was expressing
[1:13:45] his voice
[1:13:46] [Applause]
[1:13:46] [Music]
[1:13:50] in the days of the 7c when he shall
[1:13:53] begin too soon but he's someone I can
[1:13:56] study his words his solving is his
[1:13:58] because with a Bradham said and brought
[1:14:01] to to the scripture for via Amos 3:7 the
[1:14:03] prophets and a mouthpiece of God so God
[1:14:07] doesn't need to stand physically here to
[1:14:09] speak he uses prophets and then this is
[1:14:12] we have a mighty major prophet time your
[1:14:15] right hand of God when he spoke his
[1:14:18] words were the voice of God to us and
[1:14:21] that voice caught us from the Baptist
[1:14:24] Church from the Methodist Church from
[1:14:26] the Pentecostal Church even within the
[1:14:29] message that voice became so clear to us
[1:14:32] it made crystal clear
[1:14:34] Oh identification our identification in
[1:14:40] Christ not as message believers but as
[1:14:43] bride of Jesus Christ this great love
[1:14:47] letter that quote sent to catch your
[1:14:50] attention to let you know that you are
[1:14:53] not a natural being that you are
[1:14:57] supernatural and that despite the
[1:15:00] revelation you have a supernatural
[1:15:01] element still remains that you will be
[1:15:04] changed you will be transformed that you
[1:15:08] are part of him that when they see you
[1:15:11] they will see him when they see him
[1:15:12] they'll see you because you are the
[1:15:14] father ah become one wife of the Lamb
[1:15:19] flesh of my flesh bone of my bone spirit
[1:15:23] of my spirit light of my life you have
[1:15:26] no thoughts of your own you have no
[1:15:28] ambitions of your own you have no agenda
[1:15:30] of your own your agenda is his agenda
[1:15:34] your thoughts are his thoughts your
[1:15:36] desires are his desires and the least of
[1:15:39] his desires is your commander because
[1:15:41] you love him you are the servant and you
[1:15:43] are one with him what unity between
[1:15:47] Christ and His Church
[1:15:48] and that will be our striving for that's
[1:15:51] what we are contending for or to shake
[1:15:55] off there's all were these six
[1:15:57] developments and put it behind us
[1:15:59] oh we're gonna have a
[1:16:00] run time with another grand time up in
[1:16:03] heaven
[1:16:03] I can't wait to testify to David how do
[1:16:06] you mean it over holding this age of
[1:16:09] Internet and Facebook and whatsapp all
[1:16:12] kinds of manner of evil we could stand
[1:16:15] the test and every time we found out we
[1:16:19] got back up and say lord lord give me
[1:16:22] strength to fight another team
[1:16:24] somebody say man somebody say man do you
[1:16:29] love him
[1:16:30] will you serve Him hallelujah he's got
[1:16:39] to protest any this thing to be here to
[1:16:42] meet the challenge of the age and no age
[1:16:45] has had a challenge like this age this
[1:16:49] age has systematically broken down the
[1:16:52] resistance of people to accept what was
[1:16:55] perverse as normal to lower your
[1:16:59] tolerance so they tell you if you speak
[1:17:02] out against certain things
[1:17:03] now you're it's against freedom of
[1:17:06] speech and you're not being tolerant and
[1:17:08] you're do you're discriminated well if
[1:17:14] I'm discriminating in college
[1:17:15] discriminated because going to look that
[1:17:17] subtle and the morons am gonna judge it
[1:17:18] I didn't say the Bible says it you can't
[1:17:25] tell me you really seem liable and I'm
[1:17:27] reading scripture speaking scripture and
[1:17:29] because of scripture period is
[1:17:31] discriminatory and you wonder claim to
[1:17:33] really see Bible and that's the thing of
[1:17:36] it is is easier taking you whole gospel
[1:17:38] or a take Nana
[1:17:40] because if you want a book of rules to
[1:17:42] live like a good person have plenty have
[1:17:46] nice books of ethics and a nice way of
[1:17:48] living and do good unto others and you
[1:17:50] have those are nice rules to live by
[1:17:51] but this Bible is the minor chord the
[1:17:54] torts of God in completion and God sent
[1:18:03] a prophet to tie up the loose ends in
[1:18:05] this age to identify the spirit of the
[1:18:08] Antichrist and we'll try to slip into
[1:18:10] this church that the true church the
[1:18:13] word gradual will stand them discerning
[1:18:17] withstand the Antichrist word the truth
[1:18:20] was working within the framework of the
[1:18:22] church thank God for a prophet because
[1:18:27] what audience profit will be lost
[1:18:31] can the church say Amen but because it
[1:18:34] is prophetic ministry we can speak with
[1:18:37] confidence and we know we're gonna make
[1:18:39] it and because God is looking through
[1:18:41] the blood your mistakes and your
[1:18:43] failures my mistakes and my feelings
[1:18:45] they are covered under the blood until
[1:18:48] such time as fire drops down and
[1:18:51] transforms the scene into a full
[1:18:53] manifestation we are gonna be perfect we
[1:18:57] are going to be adopted can determine
[1:19:01] one of these days these voices will live
[1:19:04] with a black run and when they live it
[1:19:06] will not be my voice but will be seven
[1:19:09] little voices not a little thunder that
[1:19:12] shakes the temple and this people under
[1:19:15] fear messenger this word pride under
[1:19:17] their messenger between the final voice
[1:19:20] that are finally
[1:19:24] oh whatever it be Allah Peter Holy Ghost
[1:19:28] the Holy Ghost and power you may be
[1:19:30] seated
[1:19:33] we read the quote but Abraham said few
[1:19:36] will make it to that spot to receive the
[1:19:39] Spirit of God
[1:19:40] whew 2 million left Egypt and other the
[1:19:45] 2 million and left is only 2 meters and
[1:19:47] swapped to receive the Spirit of God the
[1:19:50] type of the promised land the rest at
[1:19:52] the entity I'm gonna bring him in water
[1:19:56] Holy Ghost is given for he said a hole
[1:19:58] that goes give you power to speak he
[1:20:01] said the way in the upper room they
[1:20:02] could even see him no they were hiding
[1:20:05] they didn't even have confidence to
[1:20:06] speak with a Stephen but when the Holy
[1:20:08] Ghost came upon them they had the power
[1:20:10] to speak but the parent said when the
[1:20:13] Holy Ghost given port it gives you power
[1:20:14] to have a prayer life or coming on
[1:20:16] somebody somebody say man the Holy Ghost
[1:20:20] gives you power still have a Holy Light
[1:20:22] but Isaac I'm struggling come on let's
[1:20:25] pray for the Holy Ghost let's make room
[1:20:27] for the Holy Ghost because that's what
[1:20:30] the church needs it's a Holy Ghost you
[1:20:37] may be seated
[1:20:38] wherever I'm sent a little sister she's
[1:20:40] praying she can't get no prayer answered
[1:20:42] he said when the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:20:44] her watch how she operates it's a
[1:20:46] different walk it's a different talk
[1:20:48] it's a different life so for you who are
[1:20:51] struggling my encouragement you get to
[1:20:53] Holy Ghost get Zoe that new life in your
[1:20:56] soul it will come as a baby you may be
[1:20:59] seated
[1:20:59] but the brown said it's a it's a bus so
[1:21:02] you gotta grow up so that spirit pulls
[1:21:04] in your soul sell us some with you you
[1:21:07] should have to be tested that's why I
[1:21:08] said after you get the Holy Ghost now
[1:21:10] you make yourself a Christian so without
[1:21:12] the Holy Ghost you are aspiring to be a
[1:21:14] Christian but when you gather Holy Ghost
[1:21:17] now you can make yourself a question oh
[1:21:19] come on now are we in the world is
[1:21:24] rolling so stop looking at your failures
[1:21:27] and look at the promise of God for your
[1:21:30] life
[1:21:30] and realize that listen even with auto
[1:21:33] holy ghost you may be seated
[1:21:35] the wood will defeat the devil any time
[1:21:39] any place under any condition and Jesus
[1:21:44] proved that with gesture would he send
[1:21:47] the devil straight back to whatever
[1:21:49] emergency room they have in hell
[1:21:51] he said the devil's shrimp back there
[1:21:53] straight back
[1:21:55] but that Branham said it was electric
[1:21:57] fools with a job that hit him when he
[1:22:00] said it is written it is written to also
[1:22:02] return Jesus could have used spirits He
[1:22:04] is God but he used a water source that
[1:22:07] why are you waiting for the Holy Ghost
[1:22:08] you have all the wood and the world
[1:22:11] itself is power the word itself is power
[1:22:15] [Music]
[1:22:15] [Applause]
[1:22:17] [Music]
[1:22:18] [Applause]
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:19] [Applause]
[1:22:21] [Music]
[1:22:22] [Applause]
[1:22:28] kanna-chan same and everybody feeling
[1:22:31] fine the Bible said resist the devil and
[1:22:34] he will not not walking Paul enough when
[1:22:42] well as you flee flee is not running
[1:22:53] few people use that word flee flee and
[1:22:57] fled that world family of words is
[1:23:01] feeling
[1:23:07] this is not walk away in them it's not
[1:23:09] even running them you can run we see
[1:23:13] flee so when you resist the devil and
[1:23:16] better Branum made it so simple and
[1:23:18] that's why I said this gospel is not
[1:23:19] rocket science there people who would
[1:23:21] like it to be rocket science
[1:23:23] my son rocket science but if I say when

[1:33:21] [Music]
[1:33:24] hallelujah separating the wood right
[1:33:33] from the church members
[1:33:39] over the years we've seen a lot of
[1:33:41] people come in and on the message after
[1:33:44] years many times you don't see them
[1:33:46] anymore because they could not take the
[1:33:50] wood
[1:33:53] people make all kind of excuses and
[1:33:56] that's why I'm a hard-ass no more
[1:33:59] excuses because it's idiot Ziggler would
[1:34:01] the only alternative to teak in the wood
[1:34:05] is to make a choose to not eat it people
[1:34:09] find some reason why well the reason why
[1:34:13] I are doing this is because of X the
[1:34:17] Bible say forsake not the assembling of
[1:34:18] herself together and I was come to
[1:34:20] church any reason the reason I come is
[1:34:23] because I was excused pray without
[1:34:29] ceasing that's in the wood many teeth on
[1:34:34] the word day and night what is your
[1:34:37] excuse as if they are pro team you ought
[1:34:42] to be more sincere more conjugated what
[1:34:46] is your excuse but a Branham did not
[1:34:50] studying and career as he said listen
[1:34:54] plan as if he coming in twenty years
[1:34:56] that's all right but live as if he
[1:34:59] coming tomorrow
[1:35:00] [Applause]
[1:35:02] don't let me and caught up in the in the
[1:35:06] way of life how do you plans that if I
[1:35:09] get that you're supposed to be ready if
[1:35:10] the Lord comes tomorrow
[1:35:12] [Applause]
[1:35:13] [Music]
[1:35:16] [Applause]
[1:35:20] what if he comes today are you ready
[1:35:26] separating the word bride from the
[1:35:30] church members the Prophet make some
[1:35:34] points here this one that kind of
[1:35:35] touches the rejected King but around
[1:35:37] said but listen you true believers in
[1:35:39] Christ you true Christians that believe
[1:35:40] in going a little financial all the time
[1:35:44] Saul was training this big army and all
[1:35:47] these intellectuals coming up God had a
[1:35:48] little demon out there somewhere feeding
[1:35:51] his father's sheep on sheep food I'm a
[1:35:54] better call she food a would not
[1:35:57] theological weeks right and he happened
[1:36:01] to be standing by when that happened
[1:36:03] talking about when Goliath through
[1:36:05] stream enough and they wanted to give
[1:36:08] him a seminary experience you see in
[1:36:11] soil and I wanted to give David a
[1:36:12] seminary experience so I said come here
[1:36:15] maybe my armor would fit you maybe this
[1:36:18] interpretation would fit you maybe you
[1:36:20] can say it this way it'll work and he
[1:36:22] said take the thing off of me well I'll
[1:36:25] make you a bachelor at and give you a
[1:36:27] doctor's degree and he said I don't know
[1:36:28] nothing about it take the thing off of
[1:36:30] me let me tell you something I've got
[1:36:33] this slingshot well that's no compare
[1:36:35] mint but looky here one day Allah was
[1:36:38] out there feeding one of my father's
[1:36:39] sheep was out there feeding and a lion
[1:36:41] come and got it and I and then packed
[1:36:43] off and I took this slingshot and I
[1:36:45] trusted in a God of Israel and I went
[1:36:47] after him and I knocked him down and
[1:36:49] slew him and brought that lamp back a
[1:36:51] beer come in and got a kid and started
[1:36:53] off with him one of my father's and I
[1:36:55] put the rock in a slingshot there's a
[1:36:57] little bitty thing but I went after him
[1:36:59] I wasn't trusting in his slingshot but I
[1:37:01] was trusting in the power of the God of
[1:37:02] Israel I'm better Brett but if I was
[1:37:06] bringing on the table its true believer
[1:37:07] and we know to scoop that Noah was a
[1:37:09] true believer Abraham was a true
[1:37:11] believer job was a true believer even
[1:37:13] when his wife said to him why do you
[1:37:15] curse God and die he was such a true
[1:37:18] believe I still believe in her
[1:37:20] he's in speed like a foolish woman and
[1:37:24] even though he got down when court
[1:37:27] challenged him
[1:37:28] where was though answer me like a man
[1:37:33] joke couldn't have no excuse girls
[1:37:36] remind me in job away come from Gannon
[1:37:39] was a true belief but Elijah was a true
[1:37:41] believer Mike I was a true believer
[1:37:44] hallelujah no my
[1:37:58] from a message and my seed shall possess
[1:38:00] the gate of his enemy and that's the
[1:38:01] reason we find our organization's
[1:38:03] falling by the wayside it's because when
[1:38:06] it comes to the test what tests
[1:38:08] God's will base the test God's Word is
[1:38:10] the test where we do what a bunch of men
[1:38:14] says do or will we do what God says do
[1:38:17] that's the difference
[1:38:20] dare he come the days of Dwight Moody
[1:38:23] the days of Finney Sankey Knox Calvin
[1:38:25] splitter all the rest of them those
[1:38:27] spiritual men they only see some
[1:38:29] followed after them
[1:38:30] they cut up a bunch of men back there
[1:38:32] that's cut their wheeze into it each one
[1:38:34] believing this and I'm adding a little
[1:38:35] here and taking a little away there and
[1:38:37] adding a little here until they finally
[1:38:39] they made our organization out of it and
[1:38:40] when they do the real true believer goal
[1:38:43] comes right around and picks up some
[1:38:46] humble little person breaks that thing
[1:38:48] to pieces right God all asunder goal
[1:38:51] doesn't change just tear that thing to
[1:38:53] pieces some spiritually minded people
[1:38:56] who will steal but to wind can the
[1:39:00] choose a man for the Bible in a message
[1:39:03] events made clear by prophecy for the
[1:39:06] Bible is a living foretold witness of
[1:39:09] Jesus Christ and as the earth has grown
[1:39:11] into its fullness and also finds grow
[1:39:15] into the fullness the day's grow at his
[1:39:16] fullness the bible has manifested him
[1:39:19] his fullness in the prison of Jesus
[1:39:20] Christ
[1:39:21] he was the word of God revealed the
[1:39:23] whole complete book of redemption the
[1:39:27] Bible is God's Word foretelling the
[1:39:29] future events its believers is commanded
[1:39:32] by its author to read and believe every
[1:39:34] word of it not just part of it
[1:39:37] one would disbelieve it you might as
[1:39:39] well quit trying until you believe that
[1:39:41] would every word is absolutely a part of
[1:39:45] Almighty God God made manifest
[1:39:48] wound into his will to show forth who he
[1:39:51] is we are commanded as believers to
[1:39:53] believe every word of it and it's ruled
[1:39:55] by the author of God himself there's
[1:39:57] nobody can add anything to it or take
[1:40:00] meeting from it if you would ever be a
[1:40:02] freak body of God it would have me be
[1:40:05] six fingers on one hand or three arms or
[1:40:07] something to add something
[1:40:09] to take something away from it and be a
[1:40:11] one short I'm one finger short it's the
[1:40:13] complete body of Jesus Christ and in
[1:40:16] Christ being a male the groom the bride
[1:40:18] is represented in him also and these two
[1:40:21] our one day you'll know that I'm and the
[1:40:24] father the father me I in you and you
[1:40:26] and me what a complete picture and the
[1:40:29] true believers in this in this world who
[1:40:31] accepted the way believe it but that we
[1:40:34] believe it and we patient wait for it's
[1:40:37] prophesied promise since every one of
[1:40:39] them to be manifested in its each
[1:40:42] hallelujah blessed be the name of God it
[1:40:48] doesn't matter if you call yourself a
[1:40:50] Christian anyone can do that
[1:40:52] the point is whether or not you have the
[1:40:54] Spirit of God in you forward out the
[1:40:57] spirit you are reprobate that is a
[1:40:59] rascal no-good troublemaker
[1:41:01] good-for-nothing you are none of it I'll
[1:41:03] read it one more time it doesn't matter
[1:41:05] if you call yourself a Christian anyone
[1:41:08] can do that
[1:41:09] and you meet them all the time I'm a
[1:41:11] Christian I'm a Christian I'm a
[1:41:12] Christian and not be trying to judge but
[1:41:15] you know that life is nowhere near
[1:41:16] Scripture it doesn't matter you call
[1:41:19] yourself a Christian and when people
[1:41:21] tell you that I'm a born-again and they
[1:41:23] jumping up in the next county welfare
[1:41:24] which paths born way again it doesn't
[1:41:28] matter if you call yourself a Christian
[1:41:30] anyone can do that
[1:41:31] the point is whether or not you have the
[1:41:33] Spirit of God in you because if the
[1:41:35] Spirit of God is in you it was like God
[1:41:38] it will act like Christ
[1:41:40] it'll make you two things I got richer
[1:41:42] it's a man not too long ago can you take
[1:41:48] someone not too long ago I asked the
[1:41:50] lady if she were Christian she said to
[1:41:52] me I'm you may have heard it before
[1:41:54] I will have you know sir that I burn a
[1:41:56] candle every night
[1:41:58] what in the world has I've got to do
[1:42:00] with it that's a profit accent I'm a
[1:42:02] Methodist I'm a budget I'm a pentacle so
[1:42:04] that has not got nothing to do with it
[1:42:06] it is the holy gospel parish it is the
[1:42:11] Holy Ghost or parish so when the
[1:42:14] question is if you are Christian the
[1:42:16] real question has been asked is do you
[1:42:18] have no only goes that's the real
[1:42:20] question
[1:42:23] hmm hallelujah
[1:42:30] the original Word will produce the
[1:42:32] original life hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:36] glory glory glory glory hallelujah give
[1:42:41] Him praise giving worship so that's
[1:42:50] right for message Christianity versus
[1:42:52] idolatry that's right you've got to know
[1:42:54] the word stay under words see the great
[1:42:57] battle is at hand
[1:42:58] now with bleach for years and years but
[1:43:01] it always come now that when Janice and
[1:43:03] John John breeze and Janice will
[1:43:05] withstand Moses as a balance at the wood
[1:43:07] and it's going to be a spiritual battle
[1:43:09] conflict there'll be some just continued
[1:43:12] all the denominators will just move
[1:43:14] right on into domination and go all the
[1:43:17] way it goes but I mean that real true
[1:43:20] believer is coming to that battlefield
[1:43:22] and you'd better be versed and know what
[1:43:24] you're doing or you can take an evil
[1:43:27] spirit so easy and not know if it's
[1:43:30] contrary so this would don't believe it
[1:43:33] stay with that word but thanks be to God
[1:43:37] we got hidden food spiritual food that
[1:43:41] we're living under goodness and mercy of
[1:43:43] the revelation of Jesus Christ in these
[1:43:46] last days vindicating self among his
[1:43:49] people
[1:43:49] amen they went and Elijah went in before
[1:43:51] the drought setting thank God for being
[1:43:54] in before the judgement sets in now is a
[1:43:57] time of coming out and going in getting
[1:43:59] out of this organization and getting
[1:44:01] into Christ coming
[1:44:03] and going in time for all true believers
[1:44:06] now notice recognize the caller godswood
[1:44:09] which is a part of and it's an eagle
[1:44:11] town eagle now if that mother would have
[1:44:14] screamed like a buzzard he'd have never
[1:44:15] known it he pinched axes well off in the
[1:44:18] barnyard when it was a scream of an
[1:44:20] eagle there was something inside a
[1:44:22] little fellow that he knowed he was an
[1:44:24] eagle and the same thing is with every
[1:44:27] true believer when the preaching of
[1:44:29] God's wood comes forth and is vindicated
[1:44:32] and proven it's God's work with this
[1:44:35] hour then there's something within the
[1:44:37] believer I don't care how loyal his
[1:44:40] father was to a church how loyal is
[1:44:43] mother was or his grandparents and if
[1:44:45] the church is teaching contrary to this
[1:44:47] hour of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:49] message there's something in him that
[1:44:51] screams out he leave the pond yard he's
[1:44:54] got to do it the chicken might have been
[1:44:57] all right one day but this is Eagle Owl
[1:45:00] it's a different there's something he

[1:45:09] is quickened and brought by the
[1:45:11] quickening spirit to the obedience of
[1:45:14] glass wood or somebody give God a shout
[1:45:17] of praise

[1:45:26] represented as the eagle flying over the
[1:45:29] land and finds a believer no man can
[1:45:32] come to me no man could come to me as he
[1:45:34] wants to but all that the father has
[1:45:37] given me will come to me but no man can
[1:45:40] come by himself
