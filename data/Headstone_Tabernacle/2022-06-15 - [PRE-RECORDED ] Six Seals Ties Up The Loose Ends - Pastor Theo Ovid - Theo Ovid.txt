that love that passage information that love that bring ashore assurance lord that love that brings comfort knowing in whom we have believed grant law that you would speak to them in a special way and confirm your word today with signs wonders and miracles and father may that first miracle be done in the hearts and lives of your children may they themselves become a miracle before they see other miracles granted lord in jesus name i ask it amen god bless you and welcome we want to go straight into the wood this morning i have something up on my heart and um i can't do it all in one service we'll this will be split into two um there's a special message i have i want to share with you this morning and we're going to read three portions of scripture all in the book of revelation version 5. i want to reverse one to 10 version 8 1 verse 1 and version 10 1-7 praise god so we come along to our message now i really was blessed last sunday with brother message amen praise god amen our version five reading from verse one and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within notice how the words are placed the the book is written within but on the back side sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming a lord voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the caesar of open and loose seals and no one in heaven knowing earth needed under the earth was able to open the book he doesn't look there on i wept much because no man was found worthy to open to read a book neither looked around one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seas thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders to the lamb as it had been seen having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the it and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts formed when the elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden virus full of waters which are the prayers of saints they saw a new song saying that was worthy to take the book and to open the seas thereof for dao has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth version 8 verse 1. and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about a space of half an hour and a last scripture from version chapter 10 reading another mighty angel come down from him clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head his face had his wooden sun his feet and spills the fire he has in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot up on the sea his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice and when a lion roared and when he had cried seven thunders uttered the voices and when the seven thunders had uttered the voices i was about to write i heard a voice from heaven seen unto me seed up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hands to heaven and swear by him that lived forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are on the earth and the things that are there and on the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to song the mystery of god to be finished as he had declared to serve as the prophets let's pray one more time father we thank you for your word and i pray your blessing upon it and the hearers of the word you know the great battle to come to this spot here this morning but i believe you are here and you would speak to us and open up the word to us we invite you have the preeminences god in jesus might ask it amen and amen god bless you it's so good to be here tim this morning i always consider god bless you have your seats i always consider it a privilege to come into the house of god amen always a blessing and a privilege amen hallelujah is the honor to come into the hall just think about it now we are really blessed amen so other title title is six seals ties up the loose ends that's the title i had a whole long thing to continue but we'll leave it for the next part of this consider the seventh seal but this part according six seals ties up the loose ends of a team let the main thing be the main thing that's the team let the main thing be the main thing another inspiration nothing else matters when you see the real message nothing else matters when you see the real message and you know it's something else when you see things in a way you can't unsee it or you think about that no you ever see a picture and they ask you do you see a woman in it or do you see an old woman in it or something else in it and you're looking looking and you see like a rabbit or something else and once you see the picture in it you can't unsee it because it's like you see it your cedar and this is what we want to get to tonight oh hallelujah when you see the real message nothing matters and barabanam saw it and then he said it this way you say whether i maintain my family or not let me maintain christ friend or no friend live or die denomination or no denomination let christ work in me o lord is my prayer so he really saw something and you you have to see something oh glory to god do you believe that hallelujah let's and i'm gonna go and this is very unusual what i'm doing here this morning but i'm going to do it normally a way to get to this title or the inspiration or the subject but i'm going to take that up first what we're talking about the title the subject the team i'm going to deal with that at first this is the prophet here now he said now uh all right you're talking about world revival um the church went over into wheels to understand or figure out all the mechanics was in the revival during the world and they got off the ship with their tall hats on wrong color scene coming down the street a little policeman swinging his club around around like that whistling he said good good man could you tell me where the world revival is and he said yes brethren you are standing in the middle of it you say you understand i am the world revival because the wealth revival is in me he said that sovereign that what god does he alone has a right to send a revival not get the mechanics together it is pray for god to send on the dynamics so that must be to pray upon your heart lord send the dynamics i pray for that every day send your fire send your power every single day oh praise god hallelujah we are limited with our words we are limited with our explanation i understand the prime minister say people not even bothering they're not they're not taking his word seriously to wear masks i understand in england it's compulsory you get a ticket you get charged you get fined if you don't wear a mask but people are not taking it serious and we have the word here that people are taken serious it comes down to basic they call it be sick watch your hands social distancing where your mass it could make the basics read your bible and pray every day you know big you know big scientific thing in that read your bible and pray every day and you will grow grow grow grow grow oh glory to god hallelujah praise god hallelujah stephen i was thinking about a song this morning the things i used to do i do them no more the place i used to go i go there no more i couldn't remember the story was so i wanted to get the old timer together there but since i have been changed but georgina song oh glory to god hallelujah maybe somebody could raise it but steven gave me a shout out and that one other things how they going my lord to them no more no longer hear that song change change my lord glory hallelujah come along any words the thing i used to do my lord do them no more mine i will say them no more please i used to go [Music] oh give the lord some praises [Applause] this ought to be your testimony hallelujah the things i used to do i do them no more the places i used to go i go there no more the things i used to say i say them no more i have been changed oh god if this gospel will change as we wasting time oh hallelujah but you've come to be changed not to get a religious atmosphere over your own life oh give the lord a shout don't get me started this morning your coming to be changed [Applause] he only reveals his word in the predestinated when i use the word predestination as a bad word to use and i'll skip let's get that let's do this i want to skip down a little bit but god has his words set and has in all ages his foreknowledge caused him to set in the church in the people sitting things okay now jesus said father i thank thee father that was hid these things on the eyes of the wines and prudent and revealed to be such as would learn see that is predestination not that he did it but you say i chose you but you and don't choose you but by his for knowledge he knowed what you would do but his full knowledge he know what you will do when he was party and vetting he knew you would repent when he was carrying on he knew you will come out of your nonsense you will cut your foolishness he knew you would come to that spot when i was a child i act like a child i speak like a child whatever but when i became a man i put away childish things there are things you have to put away he is not going to come and put it away for you oh give the lord a shout in the house oh god the pastor's in house this morning he's not going to come and put it away for you you have to put certain things away when i say put it put it kick it throw it out [Applause] all right here we go how many ever seen the picture of a car in the bush that you have to look and look did you ever see that or see the picture of christ in a bush or sky or clouds that the painter has got it so fixed till you have to look at it a certain way and when once you see it you can't see nothing else but that hallelujah every time you look there it is how many seen those pictures we're sure you have well that's the way christ is himself the gospel the message when you once see the message of the hour there is nothing else you can see but that everything else is gone the rest of it is filler when you won't see the message the rest of it is filler so when somebody gave you a gift this is how you get a gift like a gift bag this is a gift you don't have anything and say look look that is a gift this is how you get a gift the gift does get wrapped well you see this little paper thing here you see this here didn't have to give him this is way called fuller this just make it look nice and and so on all right [Applause] a punch is a sexy gift now to get to the gift you have to rip off only seals and then when you get here and always have more filler material and then they give it like something for my wife you know but this is a gift [Applause] so here i want to get you now the prophet brought a message are we going to get it it has superneed baptism in jesus name it have a lot of mysteries inside of it that is filler material you can go on the to the rapture until concede you can't go on the rapture on rome falls you can't go on the rapture on any nonsense and any little lighting no you can't go you have to get to the message so when you see the message the rest is filler so we want to let the main thing be the main thing say after me let the main thing be the main thing you know sometimes husband and wife have chorus and fusses another setup filler material that they fussing and carrying about it's not the main thing because everything have a main thing you know everything has a root cause the reason we're talking about seals and book is because something happened in gardner eden that is why we are dressing this thing called this book and they see it's not this great thing that you have to go and get a degree to understand each other man fell adam was supposed to call other sons by name you know before you you were born your mother father had a name for you for his other fight if his boy or girl then they had to get a boy name or girl name and they're waiting for you to come out to tag that name on you but your name was before you ah jesus oh give the lord a shout do you get that so god put your name before you he put your name in the book before he expressed you so when you come forth you come to connect with your name and when you see your name you're going to behave the same with john be here because he was crying a while ago but somebody said we'd not the land of the tribe of judah had prevailed to take the book and to loose the seals thereof oh glory to god hallelujah although we could pray from now to the end of the year on israel are we still touchy sufficient we could put israeli flag here still at the receivers of it we could preach our second seed and get the trailer that is separated and speak six months and serpent and that can help you all you're seeing is supports hallelujah but we commented on to the bride's message which is your message don't miss it and once you see it you can't unsee it once you see it nobody can take you out of it if this church disappear if you still see it oh glory to god hallelujah it doesn't matter who come who go you still see it no demon not devil paul said this way what can separate me from the love of god that in christ jesus shall things present things to come nothing going to separate me so i wanted to bring that to you this morning let's say it again when you won't see the message of the hour nothing else you can see but that everything else is gone the rest of it is filler when you want to see the message that is what is noah's time when noah and his group who when they saw the message nothing else mattered when moses group saw it nothing else mattered when john group saw it nothing else mattered headstone tabernacle when you see it nothing else matter [Applause] all your complexes go go hallelujah all the nonsense go fly out your head fly out your spirits nothing else matters this world is about finish america is finished the kingdoms of this world is finished egypt was in power greek was in power all of them was in power but daniel saw a stone that we are connecting with the coming of the headstone oh glory to god and the prophecy when the bride near the headstone she'll be a super race she'll be a super people it'll be a super church oh could we get a shout in the house this morning oh hallelujah this is what i'm looking for [Applause] [Music] when john group saw it nothing mattered when jesus group saw it nothing else matter them dropped their nets they dropped their fishing they dropped their business to follow jesus nothing else matter oh glory to god when looter group saw when the apostle group saw it nothing else mattered when luther's group saw it where's the group saw it pentecostal group saw it nothing else mattered they pulled away from everything why by for knowledge he predestinated these things to happen so you have to see it what does habakkuk say right the vision and make it not complex plane that he that read that may run not work you have to run run means you spurred on with the action you are motivating to do more than just drip drifting along with everybody else this is no slow walk this is getting desperate right division make it pain that's what the fivefold was supposed to be doing for the last 50 years making it plain that you see it could run and act upon it because what we see should make a church that would be acting upon it that will make a revival are we on the word this morning are we going good so far you have to check me out by the way you know [Applause] why are you saying it because you're going to find out enticing spirits and the classical spirits and demon spirit follow lotions let me say that again eclassical spirits demon spirits and tyson spirit follow loose ends say if a preacher not preaching the complete vision or the prophetic vision and impression on the loose ends demon activity is present because the devil rides on loose ends but god has nothing to lose sense business he just come to tie it up [Applause] and as saying this to you know you have to begin to tie up your loose ends [Applause] you're not clapping you're afraid to say amen or what who you expect to tie it up for you god had to come and tie up the loose ends before the power of god could rock true because the word is a conduct of the spirit and the word was scattered through all the ages and god had to gather it up gather it up gather it up line it up and then drop the spirit inside of here that is why you are here [Applause] no i i truly believe i was given this to share with you this morning all right [Music] people say there'll be a mark it's already my heart you reject the holy ghost you are mocked that's why any doctrine that one to play down the holy ghost and now the holy ghost dismissed the holy ghost tell the holy ghost take a leave any doctrine is satanic any doctrine that want to put the holy ghost as out of play and let man come into play that is lucifer again and we will expose him because the problem says when the bride recognized the two spirits working in the church you know once somebody by the bar and the united church and the two spirits working in the church one is a loose and spirits and one of the spirit was loose from under the seventh seal it's two different spirits all together oh glory to god but the sixties come to tie up the loose ends to introduce a seventh seed because under their silence the devil don't know what happened on the deer but there's gonna be a bragg and to know exactly what is happening under there or give the lord a shout this is for you you're coming to your message [Music] [Applause] receive the holy ghost you are mocked receive it once see what take place that's the mark of god you are sealed to your eternal destination like a car on the road the inspector comes now you didn't get the holy ghost that's that last night that went in here check up the night the inspector of the holy ghost is here kindly inspecting you over i'm still reading i used to work for the pennsylvania railroad and we will load a car maybe with cans and so forth and the inspector comes around he would shake everything to see if there was any looseness [Music] the inspector is not the person sorry i am not the inspector the holy ghost is see when you're cussing you see when you're lying you see when you're cheating you see where you're doing on the hunting you see when you're not sincere you see when you're not honest he is seeing them things not me [Applause] but god send a messenger that will tie up the loose ends because christ have to come after the loosers have been tied up and your seal coming after your loose ends tied up that's the way god does this church see what's the matter with it see if there's any looseness in you before he pours the spirit into you and if the church is a little shaky he won't pour his spirit into it if you still love the world i want to do the things of the world you will never get the holy ghost upon that you might get a confusion you might get a stammering lip you might speak with tongues you know you talk about entice inspiration because that ride upon loosens oh you'll get manifestation but no life that is what they have now in preachers with doctors behind the reading bibles with manifestation and absolutely zero life and they're stomping up and down with no fear of god look at them good see if i see anything looking like fear when god said god tremble at the word no fear of god hallelujah they think they're controlling god because they're in that spirit realm hallelujah of demonic activity but god promised a bride that could be so lined up with god watching speaker nerd go echo in him what she buying and they'll go bang in here man watch it loose i'm not gonna be loose in heaven oh glory to god are bride so in tune with god oh hallelujah praise god praise god what you speak god honors what you speak god is pleased with what you're talking about if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask whatever you will whatever you will and it shall be done unto you so this will give us great confidence now in the god that we serve and the promise that he made he can't lie oh glory to god the secret is the word is in the bride and he put a divine connection between you as a branch and he has the vine and he's trying to challenge the life to flow from the vine into the branch because through you he gonna produce fruit true and bride the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised so close the lord has shout oh glory to god he must find hands he must find feet he must finish he must find a people in the land another people in the land under their messenger becoming the final voice at the final age oh glory to god god given an opportunity to become the voice of life my lord whoo my lord glory i want to spray and deal with this message i was praying i was thinking about the spirit of truth it's not just truth letter word written but there's a spirit of truth that's why ministers with demon activity behind their life could take scriptures but it's not the spirit of truth at work it's a different spirit at work but they read in scripture hallelujah and they're giving enough gospel to tantalize people taste that it could sparsely smell tests hallelujah it's something about god something about jesus but it can't test that it can't pass the test of the prophetic vision oh glory to god hallelujah praise god do you understand what i'm saying because if you caught this part and this filler that part is filler it's still the word but as you feel a part hallelujah there's a bright part that's only for the bride the prophet preached plenty messages plenty promises plenty information plenty knowledge but the bride have her message inside of there that's why he said alter a true group of the seed of the word god represent christ with a beloved bride there's a group coming out with the true seed of the word because son of man has come forth [Applause] soul of the good seed all right when they expect to come along and shut the thing and the car was good solid he shut the door then he sealed the car when god sees that you're ready so lord for him he fills it with the holy ghost you are sealed by the holy ghost until your destination grieving of the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption that's exactly what the scripture said don't get scared just keep moving on hollywood i want to say that to you don't get scared yeah it's scary but don't get scared fear not so as the holy spirit come the angel of fear not fear not fear not don't fear i'm with you fear not i'm going to lead you fear not oh glory to god shall i hide from abraham what about to do praise god god to open this up to abraham to tell him just making about the strike set him hallelujah but look what's down there and abraham change gears and say oh ho were you revealing who am i my family what about 50 i wanted trouble what about 40 if there's 30. you ain't called a lot name yet you know he's just dealing with if there's 50 righteousness all right here we go love this one as john the baptist was 1933 uh the pillar fire came down in the banks ohio river and spoke as john the baptist our center for around the first coming of the christ you have a message message message that would forerun the second coming of christ so this is from as but isaac said it so beautifully december 1962. so i was amazed i don't know what he was going to preach and where he's coming from last week sunday and when he started i said wow he doesn't know what i'm going to preach but i'm continuing where he left off he said he's not going dear he going have i done enough but the place he said he's not going is where i'm going so what we preach is the word so this is from so this is time as john was sent to wind up the old testament you know sometimes you're driving fast you miss the flowers and you miss these trees and whatnot we're driving slow this morning because we want to soak in everything here we don't want to miss anything here as john was sent to wind up the old testament and to bring forth the introduction of christ a message will wind up the loose ends and will introduce the messiah just before his coming the message of the last days no john didn't just come up bring a message he bring a message and then introduce the messiah and the messiah took over from there well william branham he came with the spirit of elijah and he came not only to bring a message six seals you're gonna get it but here was to introduce christ the seventh seal or introduce luke 17 30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed so william branham was malachi for elijah prophet but luke 17 30 is the god prophet himself but it happened that the god prophet was veiled in a prophet it wasn't two different men oh glory to god let's go let's go let's read he said moses david joseph elijah on down through we could take each one of those prophets and bring their lives out and she would express jesus christ perfectly yet never given his secret and full amen waiting for it to be made known in the last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended before he could express it no the coming of the lord is a mystery we don't know when he is coming how he is coming but we know he is coming and so was all the mysteries of god waiting for this last day after it's already been completed then he reveals and shows what he's done he never gave his mystery in full so it take this last day for a prophet to come at the end aloud this year and he steps at the end of laodicea and show you paul feet arenas martin columba he's showing you know the history what has already been lived that you can see where we are at seeing that all this has already been unfolded so you can't do like a lotus day or yesterday that's finished already that mystery completes already you come into your mystery you're coming to your day you're coming to your message do you see it now just like comparing the seven seals when god used martin luther for the coming out of the first church or that church age and he used john wesley he gradually brought them out and was revealing in them that church age in them they were living out something they didn't know and it was revealing in them that churches notice when the seas break right horse red horse black horse pay horse and an earthquake and everything else right but watch the seas never talk about the messengers because the messengers were hid in the seals don't forget that now this is very important if you read your bible you don't see anything but no paul arenas or any messenger no you seen red horse white horse well what he'd ever doing and what not but behind that what the devil couldn't see unknown to satan god had a messenger he says calling these people come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on and they only go into the kingdom the king only filling out he calling me elect and dick slamming into the kingdom of god devil can't do nothing about that you only keep in his own but god keeping taking his people out oh glory to god so in the last there's god i need them that messenger to gather the bride together with a special message exclusive bright message oh glory to god hallelujah they're going to give the bride faith they're going to gather the right together oh glory to god to give the right faith for rapture and grace there's only for the bride church members can have whatever they want but the bible have the real message and when you see that message nothing else matter oh glory to god you get locked into that talk give the lord a shout hallelujah oh glory to god so he was revealing in them that church age and we find out but in the last days the reason that was such a tremendous thing he spoke of it here and showed those seven thunders in life magazine and pack a circular cloud yeah my god i'm gonna see it here come luta preach justification okay let's continue here come looter he only put justification he just spawned away in fact for that age he didn't know what age that was here come wesley he punked you is it true a lot of outfalls from it the other church is raising up and here comes pentecost pointing away and they organize right right back and then comes the revelation of the mystery to reveal what it has been all about and all these little doctrines like luther brought out catechism and everything else whereas we brought this remember luther was the one who called them justification right but they were drinking beers and i am saved hallelujah pass me a beer no that can't work when we're sleeping because we're sleeping to add something more to this justified beer drinking bunch he said you can't drink beer and be justified only you have to be cleaned that up you have to be sanctified so you drop another bomb on them to blow that up now all them justified people who want to continue drinking their beer they was out of it they get cut off loose and spirits take them oh glory to god you understand what i'm going on it was okay when luther was preaching justification and certification at it yet your beard drinking was acceptable that time because you're only getting justification by faith but when wesley come you can't continue drinking beer not when the god that said justification is the same god that said sanctification or give the lord a shout therefore justification was the token for that time and when wesley comes justification plus sanctification oh give the lord a show [Applause] [Music] so the pentecostal brought back organization fires and where he goes baptism and so on then come back in the last days and pick up all these mysteries the messenger and and clearly explain it and reveal it why it's all the last days when this great mystery that god has in his heart is being revealed now remember i don't know how much longer i'll be with you remember this is the truth thus yet the lord is the truth like the seven mysteries of the seven last seals the mysteries of them the seals had done been broke and every age had come down and they had been left off a lot of scattering and god not willing that it should be scattered he comes back and pick up those things those doctrines they started and brought it out and revealed the whole thing the same thing he's doing now revealing the mystery of christ so all the little pieces are little doctrines got her to go and pick those things up but all of that is still under six seals so when you see people arguing about filler material and denominate over filler material and teaching fuller material you know is a six seals is a loose end spirit anointing that is dear tying people up saying you have to believe it the way i see it because that is that is what happened you know um um baptize this way do baptize this way believe it so believe it so and if you don't believe it so you're out of it that was two changes that's loose and spirits and those spirits come back in the message still preaching loose ends they're preaching topics doctrines differences and debates they're not preaching a vision because vision is what inspires you to press on a vision is what gives you a wrong target a goal that was a vision i press towards the mark so the vision is what produced a mark i pressed towards the mark of the prize of the high calling in christ jesus oh glory to god without a vision the people perish sitting in church by the thousands this morning but no vision oh glory to god but once you have a vision oh glory to god you could strive oh glory to god if you pass your willingness you still have the vision they sell you to egypt you still have division they put you in prison you still have the vision they forget you in prison you still have the vision but the vision is for an appointed time nobody could change that vision or give the lord a shout in the house until his word came the word of the lord tried him when god gave you a vision you could perceive here when god give you a vision you could press god came and give the bride a vision and purpose it's the prophetic vision it's a vision of the end time it's a vision of the seventh seal and no devil in hell could cancel it change it upset it he doesn't know it because under that seven see the silence [Music] oh you love him tonight now watch there's a lot of truth loss out there where others compromise on truth and this seventh angel don't compromise on nothing he gathers up all the loose ends he gathers up all the loose ends he has to do that first hallelujah at the song then all the mystery of god should be finished what is he quoting revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin this song the mystery of god should be finished he's talking about all the rich mysteries all the loose end mysteries should be finished by that time and once that mystery is finished then we are ready for the mighty angel revelation 10 1 i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven because this mighty angel coming down he coming down on a platform of the word being tied up the world already tied up the loose has already gathered up the platform is made ready for this mighty angel to come down oh one foot upon the land one foot upon the sea swore by himself time shall be no longer time is finished oh glory to god the the clock the conglom is on on time hallelujah praise god let's continue here the book that is written within is then completed when this angel ceases now please understand this when the seventh angel's message is completed the godhead mystery dissipancy mystery all the other mysteries of these things they will cast it but you don't like machines anymore cooperative preaching mysteries this morning notice here we go the book written when this angel finishes all these loose end mysteries that through the battle they thought luther fought wesley fought the pentacles of what but there was coming one in the days of the sounding of these mysteries the one is run off in jesus name the trinity went on fast and holy ghost a nicer concert they were both wrong now in the middle of the road in the scripture lays out the truth and you see where we are at notice revelation 5 1 we read the scripture i saw on the right hand of him that sat upon a throne a book written within and the prophet said is here the writing was on the inside oh we're driving past through and on the back side sealed with seven seals and we found those seven c with seven voices hallelujah that reveals what was inside the book but it was sealed with seven seals is right all right now let's continue now there is writing on the inside of the book but on the back side had seven c's on the back of it that wasn't written in the book this is the revelator talking john now remember it wasn't written in the book in the days of the voice of the seventh angel all this misuse written within should be finished it should be taken care of then is the time for the seven voices of revelation 10 to be revealed when the book is finished there's only one thing left and that is the seven mysterious voices of thunder that was wrote on the back side of the book that john was forbidden to write it's on the back side when the book is completed so when you spend the patience the book is completed voices on the back side hallelujah praise the name of the lord don't write it john saw the same thing and watch daniel saw it john saw it it has already been written outside of the bible they had seven seas on the back of the book no michael opened those seas but that was them voices so brother branham identified the seals on the back of the book as them voices seven thunders seven voices seven thunders is them voices back there he said but on the back side of the bible the revelations are shown to daniel say that there is seven voices to be uttered that no man can open no man know what it was but the bible said it told daniel and also john in the last days these seven voices would be known by the real true church you get it can you see where the false and counterfeit is trying to their best to keep great men from places like that hallelujah so when i begin this song the mystery will be finished note then it's time for the seven sea voices of revelation 10 to be revealed do you understand when all the mysteries of the book has completed and the bible said here he would finish the mysteries and the seven thunders right here in the revelation here of jesus christ is some mystery does not the bible said that the revelation of jesus christ the conversation said amen he said why there's some hidden mystery in of it you say what is it the seventh unders have it for john was told was just about to write and a voice came from heaven saying don't write it but seal it seals up put it on the back side of the book it's got to be revealed it's the mysteries now is it plain when the first scene was opened the seals that was on the inside of the book these mysteries are strongly for justification signification he's identifying them roman catholic church protestants all these little battles and things left these loose ends in the word of god the seventh angel comes on gathers them all and explaining explains them then he finishes then seven thunders utters out then he went on to say this if the ministry of the mysteries of god is finished what if that is them seven mysteries coming forward you know what he said if all these new sins is tied up what if it is those seven thunders coming forth hallelujah and a humble little church like ours that almighty has come and regarded the lowest state of his people what i don't think so it might not be but what if it is then time has run out be serious it is later than we think oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah now listen the angel come down from heaven the other seven angels of the seven churches was earthly messengers but this angel version 10 1. all the messages finished the seven angels wind halting but this angel come down not of the earth he isn't a man from the earth as the messengers of the church ages that is finished but this angel brings the next announcement so after the seals are tied up after the loosens are tied up you have a next announcement and you know it had men human beings thought that they were that angel and the prophet came to introduce them loose end spirits just take them just like that and give them revelations and stuff and they think that they were the ones that were supposed to come wow thank you lord jesus hallelujah this angel bring the next announcement an angel means a messenger he comes down from heaven talk with that pillar of light cloud a rainbow over his head rainbow is a covenant with christ with one foot upon the land where are we at science what is this about i'm asking you the other angel was messengers men of the earth but this one didn't come from the earth he come down from heaven because the mystery is all finished when the mystery is finished he just said time shall be no more what if there's something to let us know how to enter the rapture in faith is it will we run a leap over walls is there something fixing to happen that these old mad bodies are going to be changed no we have to believe that you know we can't just looking to get old and dead you know that is not that's not the promise you're getting old but you're looking for the promise to be changed you have to be on the expectation for that and if you're looking to be changed you'll give a rapture and fear to be changed because you have to have fear to be changed in a moment it'll become you have to have faith for that for you let me sting you a little bit you know that church thing you know these two in our bed one taking one left you know oh give the lord a shout this is you having faith for you being changed and before you get changed on the outside yeah they get changed on the inside the raptor's not outside in this inside out oh give the lord a shout let me say that again the rapture is not outside in it is inside out you have to have the mechanics in you a change in you and because you know what has changed in you you know that the power that's in you could change outside you or give the lord a shout jesus himself said destroy this body in three days i will raise it up myself because he understood the revelation of mechanics and dynamics and he had resident dynamics in his mechanics [Applause] don't get trouble with that you know one time they did man bones the private bones was there they showed a dead man on the bones anyone come back to life because the quicken power was still on them bones it can't leave you them quick then pour on your bones it's on your flesh and on your hand it'll be all over you on your mouth on your eye and your tongue oh glory to god we have seen nothing yet we are about to get started come on [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah think about it man think about dinner they take cloth out of paul's body and the anointing went into the cloth and when they lay hands and they put the cloth up the people the anointing was transferred praise god to quickly power you can't get away from that this is our promise to quick then power oh god equipped and power open them seals it was the quick thing power upon enoch it was the quickening power upon the apostles it was the quickening power and be a quick then power up on you tonight [Applause] hallelujah my god my god what abraham says will we run leap over walls and is there something fixing to happen not talk happen nobody got preachers dinner you're preaching when you're up there good you're going to rupture you're going to rapture yeah yeah wrap the ticket how many more tickets to get false prophets false spirits you don't work in so you know enoch walk with god and before he walk he had a testimony god are you going to knock pressure away pressure pressure good good like that's the money knockout that would like this morning pressure my wife cooked for me this week a vex i know you testimony in your hand [Music] you had a testimony praise god you don't know what kind of whitey man had but he was pleasing god fell an old friend whether i maintain my family enoch was maintained in christ and his mechanics became dynamics by the spirit let me say it again his mechanics became dynamics by the spirit and god took him and sit down say oh god when sitting looking for you not gone as a sign as i say that we will be gone [Laughter] all glory to god god take enoch and use him as a sign that we will be gone and he was his seventh from adam who killed the lord hallelujah he said can i lift the seer o lord is it so close that i'll see it is this degeneration so is my brethren what time is it where are we at it might be crucial and we think it has got me scared and this last week message oh i haven't done enough where are we at time shall be no more he announces the time's over what happens what happens could that be so no brethren seriously think if it is then the pyramid is capped by the seven thunders so he put the voices the seals on the back of the book as the cap of the pyramid hallelujah the back of the book the tongue is become the capstone that's our message that's where we are that's the doctrine [Music] listen it had scribes they had a doctrine it had pharisees they had the doctrine they had sadducees and they were sad you see they had adoption too all of them had the doctrines but john didn't come to introduce another doctrine give the lord a shout on that john didn't come to have rejection according to john he come to introduce christ behold the lamb of god hallelujah not another teaching or doctrine christ and christ point them to the cross and then they struck the upper room where they were filled with the holy ghost of god then he said do you remember the proven message it's the capstone what did it do the holy spirit capped off the individual so we're not talking about church israel we're talking about the individual let's drive by and slow capped off the individual when um we added to our faith righteousness godliness did that means you cast your faith i have faith are you so sincere 20 years now you know no no you have to add add and then you add so you don't have to go step waste you add in hallelujah the only way god could add patience is to give you patience and you have to wait you can't get the patience very quick so please say oh god i can't wait for the pictures oh god patience isn't too long are you adding that now you want a promise go get your promise and your weight telling you hold oh god and you're tired prayer pray for six months now when you're more you'll see more once again to pray because you want to add patience hallelujah and they keep adding until they come to berlin kindness whoo spirit of forgiveness and that is when somebody do this and that is when she do it is that he does and they do this and and that's where you get tested to see if you forgive and drop because you don't want to stop at the leakiness and to get above early kindness you have to deal with the issues around you that requires a demonstration and a manifestation of the spirit of forgiveness oh glory to god halal that doesn't come you sit the number yourself on some mountain somewhere you can get burning candles and some hill you have separate room stepping somewhere all the way to the world of this life we are forgiven up there you can't run the hill and this you have to be among people somebody must smash your corn and god set them up i know it's painful but god not testing them goddess in you they didn't get the pressure you did they didn't get any heartburn you did you didn't you didn't feel bad you felt bad i know you have to die by dropping your odds and so i forgive you and move on and press on just like christ did father forgive them more crucify crucify him old mother people under mob anointing hallelujah crucified crucified he's a father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing and they didn't know what it was doing they didn't know they was going to be judged and sentenced run out of the land for hundreds of years oh glory to god but he's still going to bring them back oh give the lord and you could run but you can hide he'll leave the jews to come and get a gentile bride where you going where you hiding oh glory to god you like diamond in the rough and when he cut you he had to grind you and drill you and cut you and shape you that the fire could cop in the diamond you could spark the rainbow inside that diamond oh i know you're rough i know you're tough i know you're dirty i know you're this but you gotta drill long and get you you're gonna cut your hair and cut today and cut your deer oh glory to god all them loose ends in their life will be wrapped up i know you have pressure your pressure is good for you i know you're feeling good about it but it's good it could bring on the best insider you're devil your liar the devil is a liar it will bring all the best inside of you he's still a liar oh glory to god hallelujah praise god you ain't dying now at all oh glory to god you're overcoming first you're getting the victory first you're raising above yourselfes you're rising over your family and friends first you must your loved ones believe you in some religion oh you sit down a minute how much did your family believe you just going to church you're in some religion then you'll see you're no son of god them see you as a church go are you going to a church a message god gonna deal with all of that god go and shut them out god going and prove who you are god going and confirm who you are don't sit down like i'm talking in space i'm talking to you [Applause] one time david cried out why do the hidden rage and the people imagine a fainting people saying where is your god but my god going to come my god were to come my god going to come my god going to come he's not a liar he called me he he called me he put my name in the lamb's book of life oh glory to god hallelujah the devil said i'm nobody i am somebody if i wasn't somebody jesus was going to die for me he died for me i could be redeemed by his blood [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah yeah yeah your pain your struggle your weakness your feelings and shortcomings but you ain't gonna stay weak all the time have a word the bible like the week say i'm strong before you get shown how to speak it to them out when you speak strength so the devil will confuse because i speak in my faith let the weak say i am strong not feel your strong say it speak it oh glory to god let me say it again you have to speak it say i am strong the lord will fight for me no weapon form against me gonna prosper my bible tell me that day that great upon the lord shall renew your strength my bible tell me that [Music] oh glory my soul waited upon god [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you you can't beat somebody hungry and tasting after god hannah was barren and hannah was crying another altar it's a plenty grace to do that you know because yeah one people know your condition but hannah didn't care she passed a certain barrier already other people tease and she and terrorize and she enters you all kind of thing i for her to begin to cry out she's had a grumble and mumble even in the pre-stall she'll take a little thing before she came by the altar thought she was all drunk hallelujah hannah was not drunk she was groaning in the spirit because she was desperate and when you get desperate you begin to groan because something you need a breakthrough you need a touch you need heaven to come down message too comfortable yeah the message is too easy so god said lock them down lock them down always say they have faith all you see there's this i know preachers who was pre-claiming to be god man and and all kind of powers and whatnot this corner virus the only man alone they leave the god part out they're fighting no more god money no no i can't i'm ordinary man yes i'm going outside all the godman all the powers they claim to have all the great gifts they claim to have while they get power and they are churches back in the day and once the people back in them up that's it i said they float up in space you see years ago early in my ministry very early god taught me and showed me that adoption is not based upon the people so i was never persuaded for the by the people i know adoption is father and son business because many men get deceived by the people that they preach too let's say it again they get deceived by the very people that they preach to because the people love them and hey and afterwards they do all kind of crazy stuff because they love the people and people love them and they're the man of god and man in the all right but when you understand that this adoption as i said it last week or a week before sometime was preaching nowhere adoption is based upon the man sermon message or teaching doctrine think about it think about it mighty messages share our messages firewall messages quality messages message they can dispute but they're not adoption i talk adoption have to do with behavior a wife could cook wash clean and still do love she has bananas and don't do it in any spirit and quality it was just banana she's doing duty you think god wants a bride that you're in duty she has a conversation all right take it or leave it he's not leaving it you're on your own he said he wants a brother but love him so it's not what you do is the spirit and how you do it [Applause] that's why paul bust him with the gifts he said do i speak with tons of men and angels do i have give my body to be burned do i have all knowledge do i know all mysteries i don't have this spirit called love charity the prize absolute you're the child of the chinese ticket the rainbow the cloud the glory the amber light whatever you want to call it if i don't have that i am not nothing zero not a waste of time [Applause] oh give the lord a shout in the house look look look israel in egypt right okay egypt moses come to deliver them so god dropped fate upon moses to speak deliver them they come out now they're happy to rejoice in they have a labor the labor they have is to get from egypt to promised land they have a shortcut god say no them people is pressure i can't show them that because they will run and they go back to each other if you know that they will just be making trips so god gave them a longer journey to see what was in their hearts and only time reveals what in people's heart they could talk they talk now but when as time unfolds as time unfolds and god gave 50 plus years to see the separate the boys from the men the good from the perfect all glory to god many are called but from those who he has chosen oh give the lord a shout in the house the willingness test is to see what's in people's heart whether they're going to serve god or not up the mountain down the valley the wilderness is not your promised land you can't build a house in the wilderness you're on a journey your husband gone you're this one died this one leave your life this one workout so what you're on a journey don't backslide now don't give up now don't let go now [Applause] you know people walk out to this message young people don't believe this message no more that doesn't change the message it changed them there was once in it they were holding them they know the message they see nothing wrong with the seed they're planted on birds they could the birds take it the seed is a good seed put it in good ground and see what happened put it in good ground and see what happened nothing wrong with the seed every seed bring forth after it's kind o give the lord a shout and if god send a prophet to put a seafarer pride so help me god there's a bride in trinidad so help me god there's a bride that's inside of here today [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah i don't care what your flesh feels okay what your flesh feels i don't care what you have been should that have nothing to do with it if your flesh had anger with it the woman i will couldn't come through jesus didn't actually how much man she had first he saw her name first and then went and call her and because her name is on the book she could have a hundred men it didn't matter her name was on the book if your name is on the book nothing else matters [Applause] you got to see it you got to see the message [Applause] [Music] your children you think each one is yours you're turning alone you don't own your children you're turning on the loan you don't own their mind your own their choices are decisions that's they're on your own you will give them a chance to raise them until they could get mature and separate on their own so don't get no kind of bad feeling like how they are i can like you no don't go there don't go there what's in them and if they are seized they have to come all that the father had given me no devil to stop that no necromancer in the orbit nothing could stop all that the father had given me will come nothing not even generation curses stopping that when god called you they would never ask you who your father is who your mother is when god called you god call you oh give the lord i shout i feel inspired oh glory to god we're gonna tie up all the loose hands all the loosens in your life all your frustration and depression oh glory to god hallelujah [Applause] [Music] i know you know all these things you put in remembrance of these things because your faith have to be activated you think peter didn't know jesus wasn't it was a christ who knew that but he ran for his life when he saw there was crucify him too and he wasn't uncharged you know that's the fear and you're gonna get so fearful it's called another arresting paralyzed by fear you end up looking inside your house your you will have to go on you have to live you have to trust god you have to believe do the right thing and survive where's he writing read your bible video and pray then wash your hands then wear your mask then do your social distance and give the lord a shout out [Applause] all them people who couldn't break lose our friends they were friendly partner you can't put your hands on your part no no [Applause] that means you could have done it all alone i wanted to i wonder if this is going to tv i wonder if you'll still watch tv and you know varys coming through tv spiritual virus think about it now let's say corner valley coming through tv and you're watching tv coming to your eyes i wonder how much people watching would take a tv off and say we'll kill you kill you you can't pull it off you kill him ain't gonna go for the kill here he's dying now you see sin come in run you know because sin not coming to get your smack on your face like that jenna they're coming to kill you when i say kill i mean are you talking about just physical that you know don't those pharisees that you oh fat is it minor willingness what what what are they claiming generational blessings generational inheritance is our people oh fathers eat man and willingness and so don't go back there don't go back about your father's them dead already and you're not the one physical death they were spiritually dead they dead already what about you i come that you might have light you turn me down you in darkness they can't come to bring light because you are on the loose ends all along i came in the light of my father's word and i'm manifesting my father's word i come that you might have life and have it more abundantly not the texts have life in him have life oh give the lord i shout oh glory to god you have to bring the disciples to him you have to come to him you have to come into his presence do you remember the premium message is the capstone what did it do the holy spirit capped off the individual and sealed it i don't hear ministers talking about that capped off the individual and sealed it man claiming to be adopted and organizing there's no signs no wonders they can't even hear a two take a headache and they're adopted i wonder how much of them challenging coronavirus right now okay they could make all the big boats when it's not running through the land when they run and shoot the land what are you going to pull people and say you see what i'm talking about now right you add righteousness and godliness you kept adding till we got seven things and the seventh one was love which is god and that's how he makes the individual and caps him and seize him with the holy spirit that is how he makes makes the individual this is not joining church i want you to see the message see what the prophet came to point us to not church but the distortion of a perfect man that these things could live in you and every time them virtues add into you did they ever have less room inside of you less room to use they assumed to influence you until one day you're full up when you see me you see my father when you see me you watch any word but what working in me is the spirit or give the lord a shout and that's not too hard to believe because in john 14 20 said that in that day you shall know i am in the father you and me and i and you all glory to god we are just flesh and blood we have a spirit we have a soul hallelujah when jesus died that ghost of jesus is the holy ghost he released his spirit throughout all the earth that's how you were found you were not found by a text the spirit called you no man could come except my father draw him the lord is that spirit oh give the lord a shout it was not text that called you it was the spirit that called you [Music] let me say it again it was not text that called you it was the spirit that called you and the spirit i call you bring it to the text that you can be washed by the washing of the water of the word and through the text you could connect back to the spirit [Applause] then if he caps and seals then if that be so he has got seven two changes the individual has that he's that seven mysteries have been sung that away and they fought for to bring back and now the headstone comes the cap of the church does the ton doesn't mean that my brethren so this is that where we are at could it be that the mighty thunder or the seven angel in the seventh consolation seventh period constellation their pyramid in a form tree on our side one on top and the drop from eternity could it be is this the mystery of the thunders not return this now the mystery of it now that will bring back the headstone you know the pyramids never kept the headstone is yet to come so the mission of the thunders pulls down the capsule pulls down the headstone pulls down a power they're going to take the bride out of here he's talking about you're seeing the dead being raised up that ought to give you a fear to be changed that's why i know they must have signs and wonders it can't be talking talking explaining revealing mystery talking it can't be that it has to be a little more than that it has to be a power emanating in the church [Applause] why should god send power on man with no life or let's say no character the least the age gone by had that the pentecostals still have power still released they're losing you know they're lying marrying four or five times they're doing whatever they want to still doing disgust no devils and healing and whatnot it's a power yeah that paul connect with loose ends but this power we're talking about is where the angel come down and introduce the age of adoption and this age of adoption is the age of personal life you see all the other ages was church life but it's the age of personal life where you get them singled out so you can hide in the group you can't hide with your behavior you can't play a church here and religious here and like a devil in your house that can't work you have to tie up that loose end there's a loose end and a demon will drop down behind you an enticing spirit will drop down behind you and terrorize your life because you have to tie up the looseness in your life as pastor of this church i can't tithe up for you oh glory to god you have got to tie up your loose ends [Applause] shake amen shake your head behind them i will say amen under the mask so nobody has seen you saying it but you saying it because the angel recording all who's in him and tick tick sisters also amen brother so and so say amen good god i wanted the line because seen it we will see you tomorrow tick tick tick tick sorry do you need to exceed the angel taking the ticks he checking off your amen oh give the lord a shout i feel good hallelujah oh glory to god i shall not die but live said speak it to declare the work of the lord [Applause] hallelujah praise god you never know you're not dead angel you no no no no no no no no no no no no no i have too much to live to see i want to see your glory to god the glory of his coming i want to see his appearance that will be the other part of this message he have to appear among the bride all right let's continue now you say is this the mission of the thunders that would bring back the headstone you know the prayer was never capped the head soon has yet to come it's been rejected will this be the mystery that would open up that will bring christ bring up power to the church mystery open up to bring what not more we know the mystery mystery you know that that was for devil only laughing let me get over a mystery but around 75 fell in the upper room then was staggering and they tell them angels them demonstrating foreign excited forget that he said he never rolled over me back to sleep of getting up to do something about it he get up he went over and sleep as far as he's concerned there's just noise because you have no discernment of they already become a conductor of the spirit and

how to do lord to feed them and the bread of life because in that vision many years ago where that big curtain laid in the west on the mountain of the bread of life the little book i was not disobedient to heavenly vision and here it all comes to pass reveal right in our face you are god and there is no other fortune receive us lord forgive us of our sins and i am repenting for all of my unbelief for all of my iniquity i plea on the altar of god as i come tonight with this little church before me by faith we move from this building in rapture as we sit together in heavenly places around the throne of god our hearts have been warm many times in the times that we have seen you do and unfold your mysteries to us but lord tonight i'm all wary woe is me and jacob when he saw those angels coming down the ladder and going back he said this is a dreadful place none other than the house of god and their battle was established god people don't understand that they think it would be so much joy but lord what a wary what a dreadful thing for a human being to come into the presence of a great mighty being of heaven i pray for forgiveness of my little church here that you sent me down to lead and to guide you bless them lord i did according to the visions and dreams and things has said so the best of my knowledge i've laid it all the food that i know how for them lord whatever it is lord we are yours we commit ourselves into your hands lord be merciful to us forgive us let us be your witnesses as long as we're here on the earth and then when life is over receive us into thy kingdom for we ask in jesus name amen then he said every one of you cleanse all your heart lay aside every wheat keep it out of your way don't let nothing bother you don't be scared there is nothing to be scared about if jesus is coming it's the moment the whole world has grown and cried for if it is something breaking fought now for a new coming a new comment of a new gift or something it will be wonderful if it's come in time for the revelation of the seven thunders to be revealed to the church how to go i don't know i just stated what i saw what a time it is serious solid thinking praise god you love him tonight you enjoying the word are you being edified this this today all right let's continue watch in the days of the voice of the seven angel when he begin to song the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his siblings the prophets he read the scripture now see the mystery of this seven sealed book will be revealed at the songing of the seven to each message the seven angels begin to song and there is a message wrote out there because it's unt and book form now at the beginning of the song of the message the mystery of god should be finished see at that time now we notice the book the mystery of god is not revealed until the seven angel messages sounded right now these points are important in the seals because it's tied together now it's wrote mysterious because no man nowhere god alone jesus is a mysterious book it's a book of redemption now we know here we go that this book of redemption will not be totally understood it is probe that through six church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins the song is mystery he winds up all the loose ends that these fellows probed at and the mysteries come down from god as the word of god and reveals the entire revelation of god then the godhead and everything else is settled all the mysteries sip and see so in other words all the little loose doctrinal teachings will be sorted out by this seventh angel messenger are you with me all right here we go okay so at the song of the seventh church is the last church age all the loose ends that's true these church ages has been probed at will be wound up together and when the seals are broke and the mystery revealed down comes the angel the messenger christ setting his foot upon the land upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now here the part now remember this seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming amen so this mighty angel version 10 1 mix version 10 7. because version 10 7 is the messenger of this age russian 10 1 is christ the mighty angel coming down after all the mysteries written has been unfolded now as john was given his message the same time the messiah come in his day john knew he would see him because he was going to introduce him we realize in the scripture over malachi there is to be one like john and elijah to whom the word of god can come to and he is revealed by the holy spirit all the mysteries of god and restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers he didn't say some man have to come after him to reveal mysteries this elijah prophet will reveal all the mysteries of god and turn our hearts back to the fate of the fathers to the fate of the apostle fathers we stood back all the mysteries that has been proved that now we see this seven seed book now is the mystery of redemption it's a book of redemption and all the mysteries at this time should be finished at the songing of this messenger and here is the angel on earth and another angel mighty messenger come down see this is an earthly angel but here come christ isn't that right this seven seal book let's continue it was closed here in version the fifth chapter and in revelation 10 it is open hallelujah and great signs in the heavens angels coming in the constellation scientists looking at it and there in a magazine told months before it happened seven angels come down and said the complete revelation of the sexy mystery of god should be unfolded so this is the prophet now explaining that all this mysteries is under six seals he called it the complete revelation of the six seals mystery would be unfolded and then he said now watch never before since the early church age did it ever see the things we are seeing today and this was only made possible when god sent us seven seals and gave us a sign by it and sent seven angels down out of heaven to come to bring back the scattered word in them denomination and tie it back down into the word again to bring down the holy spirit so it's more than just loose ends it's to gather the word to tie back into the word that he'll bring a channel to release the holy spirit okay i think we're in the home stretch now you believe we are living in the last days when the son of man was to be manifested so now he he's going in detail what son of man is he said that would be all the word that's been gathered up through luther wesley baptist all of that and the pentecostals all guided up to a revelation of what it had been are you ready the seventh angel was to open the six seal mystery it is all to be gathered up in the son of man who is that christ the seventh seal but the seventh earthly messenger could only open six seals because christ is the seventh seal do you understand that let me read it again think about this do you believe we are living in the last days when the son of man was to be manifested manifested that would be all the word that's gathered up through luther wesley baptist all of that and the pentecostal all gathered up to the revelation of what has been the seven angel was to open the sexy mystery it is to be guarded up into the son of man his fullness of time has come to the fullness of his word to manifest the fullness of his body that's the word then the spoken word made manifest by the word reveal the word so this 16 mysteries was gathered up into the sun [Music] now we get to look something dirty now i'm not talking about the sign of the son of man i'm talking about luke 17 30 christ himself coming to reveal the hidden mystery of himself in the word and that is why it had a message called come to your unveiling of the mighty god even after the seas was open because god still had to be unveiled he said when the seven seed broke it break in silence but at the finishing of the seventh seal you're supposed to know who god is all about him his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up there by that time oh glory to god are you with me are you riding with me stick with me now i wouldn't be too long with you again but i felt i want to get this there's another part of this message i'll be getting called coach grace next week so irenaeus oh here this is one

there's something called orders french wood nice little peanut butter inside of the prunes a peanut butter biscuit the only thing with the sticks and it's you can eat alone because you're waiting for them to get over their business to bring all the food right now if you're bypassing orders yeah miss nothing else the ghost men you come in [Music] now sometimes i don't think i'll trick they overdo it for the orders i don't know they want to small you find the food that you want to get afterwards they give packets with i said that's a cake and little thing and that i think i don't think somebody can either dig it like a big hole so sometimes i leave all the things aside because i want the main thing no you're going to eat both you know you can have both don't don't follow me they just when we talk more but you have to let the main thing to be the main thing in other words you polish the car you rub it down you spray paint it but it can't cast that and you're bringing people to invite them to see how good the furniture inside you guys are you're just you're a pool seeker and when you say come for a spin you say what do you spend around it right now you're going to walk around with the car car start the car you have new tires on it but it's not going anywhere you have new rooms those rooms are extensive they were imported nobody doesn't train and have rooms like your rooms but the car can't stop the main thing is not any meeting there you are a joker because a car is supposed to just be on display a car supposed to move from point a to point b and if it's time moving point to point b you are a joker so the main thing is to find out how to get it started i want to tumble the engine you could have anything you want behind it could move so listen to this i love what about exact said the whole syllabus is what is required as a body of knowledge for this child to study but the whole syllabus not coming for exams so they give you a channel to approach what is coming for exams you have to pass the exams you can learn everything you want in the past years i miss the botany you have to make the rapture you don't want to be with them drunk tribulation saints and they don't want with him because i'm never going to be drinking when they recognize they miss the boat don't go with them you want to know their activity virtue and to vote your knowledge you want to know you haven't wasted your years you come here and you find yourself with a purpose in your life you want to know you see the vision of the message of the hour and you can't unsee it nobody can change you from it so you want to know not loosened spirit upon you that you will answer back your husband and be dismayed with your husband that loose and spirit no bullets burst upon you you would obey the word husband would love your wives that's the word now that's not the loose sense wife subjective husband that's the word now another lose him come on cheering over your parents another losing [Applause] [Music] husband priest in the house pray for me pray for me pray for your wife something wrong your life off-key you're planting loose ends and you have to tie them up yet you must be in a position where anything somebody call it a prayer you could pray midnight 2 a.m 1 a.m it doesn't matter when hey somebody go pray for me you say yes would you want me to pray for you now [Applause] what it means your heart is right your heart is in tune the holy spirit could avail himself to your heart because your heart is unfeelable that the spirit could speak and work through you by and through the bride will you fulfill all that was prophesied nobody else buy into the bride so you have to have your height mechanics which is making things right getting your heart right that is the right mechanic not coming to church i want to get in that sometime oh my god so at the end you received the whole secret of god tap the loose ends and reveal those shield of god represent this government fought several mysterious thunders that are not written on all and i believe that true those seven thunders will be revealed in those days in order to get the bride up and feed because what we have right now we could hardly uh we have got a step further you see we have got to step further we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly this is that i trying to push down on somebody or talk somebody down you know this is the prophet saying we hardly have enough faith for divine healing hardly we have got to have enough faith to be changed so you're saying the faith to be changed is more than divine healing so we have to get divine healing plus [Music] that's why we had to go back to the faith of the fathers plus [Applause] we gotta go in the raptor without going back and forth in fathers you know the theater the fathers had signs wonders and miracles the faith of the fathers had paul a snake bite him and he shake it off and the people take the time and watch interference are there because there's a 10 second snake 10 seconds you're dead it's a highly poisonous stick and i see so paul living normal normal they say he's of god because the holy ghost running through them so he have the antidote on the inside he is virus protected snake bite protected drunk proof protected stoned protected he is just protected [Applause] that is dynamics that is original dynamics oh glory to god no weapon form against you oh god they shall even drink deadly thing and it shall not harm them if you drink poison by mistake it can harm you oh glory to god after you reckon it is poisonous but normal because what you are protected all your bloodstream charged with holy ghost life flowing through your members you don't even have to pray yourself lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover because the quickness power is usual to you oh glory to god he was oozing out to jesus hallelujah woman with the blood issue come and when she pressed her away and touched him so she withdraw from it he said who touched my clothes this quicktime power she pull it right out of him through his clothes you don't touch my clothes i felt paul left me i felt virtue virtuous power he felt power left him oh glory to god so we mean the brain no power no power i felt she talked to me i felt he talked please come on power have to become resident he that believed i'm going to close you i'm not going to as the scripture said out of his belly just two more pages you're doing great tonight it's a good thing i cut it to two parts maybe too much this one just knows too much let's continue here now ah hear this one now you know but i don't mention it but i'm talking about we're we're presuming when preaching his time right he has ventured out you know he was saying he felt he had something to say but listen to what happened 25th of july 1965 how we described that same message what happened monson said god confirmed in his word what was all this noise about god fulfilling his promised word we shall come up please of revelation 10 1-7 in the days of the song of the seven asian message the mystery of god shall be finished the hidden mystery of revelation 10 1-7 the last message to the last church age fulfills exactly message since luke 17 30 the day when the son of man is revealed and the god of heaven promised the even time would have even light three years ago this mystery was a prophecy what time is it sir so when he's looking back he's not seen that as presuming he's seeing that as the prophecy he says now but how no it is history it is past the promise is fulfilled what time is it sir what is this attraction oh glory to god thank you jesus he said the great battles back there hallelujah praise god okay let me read this you know what we've seen should happen what we've seen happen should make put every soul in action it should make a church i know we hear this over and over but here again it should make a trade that would make a revival here in phoenix that people would say will be fine from europe to see what's taking place they would say there's a place in arizona called the maricopa valley a city called phoenix there is something broke out there until the seven thunders of revelation 10 that's not even wrote in the bible is being manifested the power of god the end time is here the angel has guided up the loose ends and we are here he's about to write those thunders he said don't write them and at the day of the son of the last seven angel he said god is not a big bunch of gods is one god all these things should be finished the great battles back there got all the loose ends hanging out it's ought to be wrapped up together in this last age then that song the angel come and said time shall be no more o praise the name of the lord hallelujah praise be to jesus so therefore after the sixth seal that explains away all the loose ends god take the whole thing and hide it under the seventh seal of silence and he took the thunders from version 10 and put it right under the science 77 seal isn't that something oh praise the name of the lord praise be to jesus i am finished could we please something praise the name of the lord hallelujah okay last quote i'm going to read i'm going to read i want to say back the same one he said do you believe we are living in the last days when the sun man was to be manifested that would be all the word that has been gathered up through luther wesley baptist all of that and the pentecostal all gathered up into the revelation of what has been the seventh angel was to open the sexy mystery it is all gathered up in the son of man his fullness of time has come to the fullness of the body of his word to manifest the fullness of body all praise the name of the lord i'm finished oh blessed be the name of the lord all the word gathered up so all the loose ends had to be gathered up so god is not interested in leaving loose ends he interested in tina blue's hands that you could get the full blessings of god the full blessing of god comes after the loose ends are tied up afterwards and tying up duncan the angel to reveal christ the seventh seal so baram said that's the one i was waiting for waiting on he said that 17th job hallelujah that's the one so important to me the seventh angel the seventh angel the mighty angel the one with the straight back wings let's all stand as you want to praise the lord tonight i praise the lord i trust the lord will help you and and see that the messenger came to break six seals as a man seven angel messenger but son of man christ veiled in that prophet luke 17 revealed the seven seal reveal all about himself he unveiled himself and god must all be veiled so once that god is unveiled he has to feel himself in a bride so what did he do he take that that whole word and bring it in seed form and put that seed inside of you as god's secret inside of you and that seed have to unfold now the seed doesn't look like the fruit the seed doesn't resemble the fruit the seed looks different but from seed to fruit is a space what i call process hallelujah so when you go to school and you're studying and you want to get to exams how you get there your study your study keep studying revising your work and that's the process and that process give it bring it to the exam room you get the fruit you get a certificate with all the subjects so when god put that seed he expects that seat to unfold and work itself out another way he said that joseph perfection seed is god in you working his way out to where from the inside to display himself on the outside so god lodge himself inside of you and the devil do have a clue because he can't go in your heart only the word could he say in your heart so when god dropped the seed in your heart devil can't touch that he could touch your flesh he could touch your spirit but he captures the sea that god put in your soul in your heart and your subconscious is anchored inside the deer he can't change that god himself can't change that that's original seed so therefore you connect with spoken word and when you understand by revelation the six seals tie up all the loose ends that the seven seekers step forward you will recognize this message is clean it is clear and we are on our way to the rapture let's bow our heads heavenly father we thank you to the morning and i thank you for your presence and your nodding upon your word i pray and give your people revelation and the greatest of prevailing power is divine revelation and while the weight of dynamics or written power while writing your spirit may your spirit come and reveal your word to your people that they will have such a charge in their life because as you deal with the church ages so you deal with the individual as you brought the ages through so you bring the individual true and father made it see in their own lies their loose ends that must be tied up before they receive that full baptism grant
