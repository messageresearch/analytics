[44:15] we say amen amen
[44:22] [Music]
[44:35] praise his wonderful name can we give
[44:38] him praise
[44:40] can we give him glory
[44:45] amen the bible says enter into his
[44:48] presence with praise and thanksgiving
[44:53] praise his wonderful name
[44:57] i appreciate being here this morning
[45:01] you may be seated just the moment while
[45:04] i greet you
[45:07] i tell you what this is perhaps
[45:12] one of the
[45:36] amen praise this wonderful name um
[45:40] but we are here you know without a fight
[45:44] without complications without
[45:46] difficulties there is no way that we
[45:49] could
[45:50] expect the victory
[45:54] so when the devil fights fights in the
[45:56] way that he has
[45:58] fought this meeting and i'm sure that
[46:00] everybody has
[46:02] their own testimony of how well
[46:05] you see the devil don't want you
[46:08] to receive what you're going to receive
[46:11] this weekend
[46:14] you hear what i said what you're going
[46:17] to receive not what you
[46:19] may receive or are hoping to receive
[46:23] but what you're going to receive this
[46:25] weekend
[46:26] hallelujah amen and i believe this is a
[46:29] special
[46:30] uh meeting and a special time amen for
[46:34] the bride of jesus christ
[46:36] and especially during uh
[46:39] what i believe is a very important theme
[46:43] of this message of this convention
[46:47] amen what a question when the son of man
[46:49] cometh
[46:51] shall he find faith on the earth
[46:54] and i like what brother thompson said
[46:56] that
[46:57] you know there's going to be a people
[47:00] and only a people can answer that
[47:04] and i'm so thankful that uh
[47:08] there are quotes and things like uh well
[47:10] brother brown said
[47:11] i'll just read it sometime if i if i get
[47:13] a chance
[47:14] but when god makes a promise
[47:18] the promise goes out and he's
[47:21] obligated to his word
[47:24] he's not obligated to what i say or what
[47:27] other people say
[47:28] and what we make up there are many
[47:31] made-up promises you know
[47:33] but he's not obligated to that he's
[47:35] obligated to his word
[47:38] and since he is obligated to his word
[47:42] then he himself amen make sure
[47:45] amen that he becomes the answering of
[47:48] his own word
[47:51] hallelujah so how can we fail
[47:55] amen so we by faith amen the elected
[47:59] of god this portion of the bride of
[48:02] jesus christ can
[48:04] say not only just by saying it but
[48:07] by divine revelation amen
[48:11] yes lord you will find faith on the
[48:15] earth
[48:16] praise god amen
[48:19] and i'm here to tell you is not just
[48:21] saying it amen
[48:22] is manifesting it amen hallelujah
[48:26] so we is manifesting time you know
[48:29] amen because harvest time is here but i
[48:33] i don't want to i do have uh
[48:37] should i say a schedule to follow and i
[48:40] don't want to keep you too long
[48:41] but anyway i just want to say i am so
[48:45] delighted to be back in south africa
[48:48] and the first time
[48:51] i walked
[48:54] the streets of south africa and this
[48:56] great beautiful country
[48:58] was 28 years ago i was
[49:02] a young man of 20 years old
[49:06] and so
[49:09] you know it seems always that when i
[49:12] return to south africa
[49:15] although i am getting a little older i
[49:17] just feel a little younger here
[49:19] for some reason i just don't know it's
[49:23] it's the anointing that makes you feel
[49:26] amen all that singing last night
[49:28] and the singing this morning amen i feel
[49:31] like aaron's
[49:32] old rod that just was put into shekinah
[49:36] glory
[49:36] amen it couldn't help but uh amen
[49:40] blossom and yield almonds amen whenever
[49:43] you are
[49:44] in the presence of god
[49:47] you can never be the same again
[49:50] glory be to god amen listen
[49:54] you cannot enter the presence of god and
[49:57] remain the same amen
[49:59] you're gonna either change for the
[50:01] better or you're gonna change for the
[50:03] worse
[50:04] but something is gonna change
[50:07] amen glory be to god amen hallelujah
[50:11] glory be to god
[50:13] so i just want to take this opportunity
[50:16] before i just get too
[50:17] excited and i love preaching in south
[50:20] africa
[50:21] because there are believers here that
[50:23] knows
[50:24] amen the word there was a brother one
[50:27] time who
[50:28] uh he we had a conversation and he
[50:32] he he said he had visited south africa
[50:35] and of course i won't mention any names
[50:37] or anything like that
[50:38] but you know he well
[50:41] he he tried to preach something that is
[50:45] well not quite aligned with the word you
[50:49] know
[50:50] and i told the brother i said brother
[50:52] when you go to south africa
[50:56] you better know what you're talking
[50:57] about
[51:00] because south africa knows the word
[51:03] knows the message
[51:04] amen so i'm so thankful for that you
[51:07] know why because
[51:08] we all not only south africa
[51:12] but the problem that i have seen in this
[51:14] message that
[51:15] too many people do not know the message
[51:19] [Applause]
[51:20] and this is why they're so easily tossed
[51:22] about to and fro
[51:24] [Applause]
[51:26] faith can only rest on the word
[51:29] [Applause]
[51:31] and nothing else and i love to see
[51:35] a believer that's resting on the world
[51:40] [Applause]
[51:42] hallelujah to the lamb amen so if you're
[51:46] not
[51:46] you you cannot rest on interpretation
[51:50] you cannot rest on man's ideas
[51:53] your faith becomes restless it you come
[51:56] in and
[51:57] out up and down but if you ever
[52:00] amen put your faith on the word of god
[52:04] that word will never return to him lord
[52:07] but
[52:08] shall accomplish the purpose he sent it
[52:11] for
[52:12] glory be to god what a mighty god we
[52:15] serve today hey amen
[52:19] i'm here to brag about jesus you know
[52:21] praise god amen
[52:23] glory you may be seated a moment in uh
[52:26] amen
[52:27] oh cc i'm just see this is what happens
[52:29] in south africa
[52:31] amen your whole message is it goes out
[52:34] in your comments you know and just your
[52:36] introduction it's just the pull
[52:38] hey man amen so i'm enjoying this
[52:41] because i have been to
[52:43] places obviously that you preach you try
[52:46] to get people to understand
[52:48] their promises for their day and you
[52:50] know they give you a nod
[52:52] yeah that's good good point brother
[52:56] i'm not talking about a good point here
[52:58] i'm talking about a revelation
[53:00] hallelujah go repeat to god i'm talking
[53:04] about the same
[53:05] revelation that john had amen
[53:09] nobody explained it to john he realized
[53:13] amen that if it wasn't for the lamb of
[53:16] god
[53:16] that stepped forward and took the book
[53:20] oh hallelujah
[53:23] he realized he was lost but when the
[53:26] lamb came forth and took the book
[53:28] he saw his name in the lamb's book of
[53:31] life
[53:35] and nobody had to tell john
[53:38] be quiet be quiet no no no no
[53:42] because now he was in division
[53:46] he saw himself redeemed he saw him
[53:50] he said i know my redeemer living
[53:54] glory be to god and no man can
[53:57] preach that to you no man can open that
[54:00] up to you
[54:01] because that comes by divine revelation
[54:05] and upon this rock brother peter praise
[54:08] god upon this rock i'll build my church
[54:12] and the gates of hell shall never
[54:14] prevail against
[54:15] amen oh hallelujah
[54:18] praise his name oh praise this wonderful
[54:22] name god richly
[54:24] bless you i uh greet you in the name of
[54:27] the lord jesus christ
[54:29] amen on behalf of my family
[54:33] and our little church in valley stream
[54:37] i call it a little church and it is a
[54:40] little church
[54:42] amen and i'm not ashamed of that you
[54:43] know because
[54:45] you see that's scriptural jesus said
[54:48] fear not little flock
[54:53] what's your godfather's good pleasure to
[54:55] give you the kingdom
[54:57] amen and i'm not envious of those that
[54:59] have you know
[55:00] thousands whatever but you see god
[55:03] uh likes to deal with uh
[55:07] the the little things you know so god
[55:09] richly bless you
[55:11] uh i am once again so privileged
[55:14] and honored uh to be here
[55:19] and i was so blessed
[55:22] to see yesterday some of my old
[55:28] okay let me correct that long time
[55:32] friends hey man
[55:35] friends that i haven't seen in a long
[55:37] time and it's so good to see
[55:39] amen friends that uh i last year i was
[55:43] asking
[55:43] trying to figure out amen who was
[55:47] uh present in 1980
[55:50] and the last time there wasn't many
[55:54] hands i think there's a few more hands
[55:56] uh this convention amen those were so
[56:00] wonderful times in the lord
[56:03] and we've come a long way
[56:08] and i think we have mature
[56:11] amen don't ever believe that
[56:15] you are going through whatever it is
[56:16] that you're going through
[56:18] it's in vain god has a plan
[56:22] god has a purpose and i want you to
[56:26] realize
[56:27] that your trial is
[56:30] custom design
[56:34] you have a custom design trial because
[56:38] amen what you are strong at in certain
[56:42] areas somebody else may not be as
[56:44] strong so he has to customize
[56:49] the trial if you have even more trials
[56:52] well
[56:53] god knows that you can carry it more
[56:57] so don't worry about the trials don't
[56:59] worry about the burdens don't worry
[57:01] about oh
[57:02] oh all the devils have turned against me
[57:05] my family
[57:06] my church whatever well praise the lord
[57:10] amen
[57:11] because i'm gonna show i'm gonna tell
[57:13] you something
[57:14] here's the revelation when you feel that
[57:18] way
[57:19] when you feel in prison
[57:22] you could here's the mystery there's
[57:24] power and praise you
[57:26] know because when
[57:29] paul and silas was put into jail
[57:37] they were put into jail amen
[57:41] they were incarcerated they were in
[57:43] chains
[57:45] but that is the moment that they decided
[57:47] to have
[57:49] [Applause]
[57:52] church
[57:54] poor look over to silence and say you
[57:56] know what let's sing a little bit
[57:58] i will praise the lord
[58:03] brother they begin to sing and they
[58:05] begin to shake
[58:07] the prison and shake it and shake it
[58:10] and shake it in so much that the chains
[58:13] that was
[58:14] binding them fell off
[58:17] the chains that were on their feet amen
[58:20] fell off the prison door
[58:24] bars networks closed swung open
[58:28] so if you're bound here's the secret
[58:32] you don't praise god because you're free
[58:35] you praise them to get free
[58:41] hallelujah amen
[58:45] glory be to god amen hallelujah
[58:50] so now so many have gone before us
[58:54] and we miss those that are good friends
[58:58] and
[58:59] believers and great mighty
[59:02] men of god that have given their
[59:04] testimonies
[59:06] over the years and we learn
[59:09] by them what i
[59:13] like to do always is to take the good
[59:16] and take amen what is going to benefit
[59:19] me
[59:20] amen and move on and because
[59:23] here is what i want to say right now
[59:26] they
[59:27] are on the other side so now there's a
[59:31] great responsibility
[59:34] that has been placed upon those that
[59:36] alive
[59:37] or and remain because they
[59:41] now without us
[59:44] did you hear what i said now they
[59:47] without
[59:48] us cannot be made perfect so we
[59:51] have to come to perfection
[59:55] by the word of god not by an
[59:58] interpretation
[1:00:00] not by man's ideas but by the original
[1:00:04] seed word of god amen
[1:00:09] then we'll be able to call the others
[1:00:12] hallelujah that are in uh the grave
[1:00:15] hallelujah
[1:00:16] so shall we ever be with the lord and
[1:00:19] like brother thompson said yesterday we
[1:00:22] have to
[1:00:23] climb up a little higher amen into a
[1:00:26] sphere
[1:00:27] amen that's gonna shake the whole world
[1:00:30] amen shake and shake and shake brother
[1:00:33] not only the world but it's gonna
[1:00:35] shake the graves open hey amen
[1:00:38] hallelujah
[1:00:39] there's coming a resurrection amen we
[1:00:43] have an appointment
[1:00:45] glory be to god amen
[1:00:49] so we which are alive and remain shall
[1:00:52] not
[1:00:52] uh amen shall be caught up together see
[1:00:56] with those that are asleep amen so
[1:00:59] therefore we have a responsibility
[1:01:01] i want to take this moment before i just
[1:01:03] get into this sermon real quick
[1:01:05] uh i want to thank brother thompson for
[1:01:09] and his wife and family they've been so
[1:01:12] uh welcoming to me and
[1:01:16] all of us and i and the uh tabernacle
[1:01:20] uh that so has worked so hard
[1:01:24] to make this a possibility never forget
[1:01:27] to pray for the local church because
[1:01:30] believe me while we're sound asleep
[1:01:32] many of them are still probably up
[1:01:36] hours of the night and trying to make
[1:01:39] uh us comfortable for the services and
[1:01:43] the convention so we certainly want to
[1:01:44] appreciate
[1:01:47] brother raymond thompson and his wife
[1:01:49] and the end time
[1:01:51] message believers church and of course
[1:01:53] all those that cooperated and
[1:01:55] i have enjoyed the specials that have
[1:01:58] come
[1:01:58] forth i like what brother peter says
[1:02:01] certain songs you hear
[1:02:03] certain specials you hear and others you
[1:02:06] you feel and i have felt everyone
[1:02:09] amen oh i have felt everyone
[1:02:14] glory be to god it's just just just
[1:02:16] heavenly vibes
[1:02:17] coming into your heart amen so god
[1:02:20] richly bless you and i want to take this
[1:02:22] opportunity
[1:02:23] well i bring greetings as i said from my
[1:02:25] wife and
[1:02:27] uh the original faith gospel tabernacle
[1:02:30] uh in valley stream in new york where we
[1:02:33] are
[1:02:34] a little group that is waiting amen for
[1:02:37] the coming
[1:02:38] of the lord and we know that we have to
[1:02:40] stay
[1:02:41] very close and as close as possible
[1:02:45] with what the prophet said
[1:02:48] brother brown said say what i said and
[1:02:51] the problem
[1:02:52] has been over the years is that uh so
[1:02:55] many people have
[1:02:56] felt the authority i guess to
[1:02:59] to say what he said but then add a
[1:03:01] little here there and take a little here
[1:03:03] there
[1:03:03] and see but the seed has got to remain
[1:03:07] original can't be tampered with
[1:03:10] amen because god doesn't need help
[1:03:13] his seed is perfect it doesn't need any
[1:03:17] help
[1:03:19] glory be to god amen and that seed is
[1:03:22] the word of god
[1:03:25] how on earth can we help god fulfill his
[1:03:28] word
[1:03:29] because it's not you fulfilling the word
[1:03:32] it's the seed in you that's coming to
[1:03:35] perfection
[1:03:37] glory be to god we cannot make it on our
[1:03:40] own
[1:03:41] glory be to god but there's something
[1:03:43] inside of you
[1:03:45] amen striving to be perfected amen
[1:03:48] striving to be adopted
[1:03:50] striving amen to be positionally pleased
[1:03:55] amen oh hallelujah i'm feeling happy now
[1:04:00] amen would you mind if i take off my
[1:04:02] coat
[1:04:02] [Applause]
[1:04:05] amen god bless you richly amen
[1:04:08] and and what can i say bro brother my
[1:04:10] good friend brother peter chandler
[1:04:13] amen uh yesterday's message
[1:04:16] uh time tested faith amen did you
[1:04:20] appreciate the message from brother
[1:04:21] peter trump
[1:04:23] i was tremendously blessed
[1:04:27] you know because there are people who
[1:04:29] claim they have
[1:04:31] faith and you realize that after a while
[1:04:34] after several years you realize that
[1:04:37] they have
[1:04:38] their faith begins to dwayne and fade
[1:04:41] away
[1:04:42] and what is so sad that as brother
[1:04:45] thompson
[1:04:46] have said that i have had the privilege
[1:04:49] of
[1:04:49] traveling quite a bit and there's a
[1:04:52] brother who made a statement
[1:04:54] and said i have wasted 40 years of my
[1:04:56] life
[1:04:57] preaching this message and what a sad
[1:05:01] statement to uh hear from a minister who
[1:05:04] has been
[1:05:05] in the message for 40 years and say i
[1:05:08] have wasted my time
[1:05:10] amen so therefore there's a great
[1:05:12] falling away
[1:05:14] but when the son of man cometh shall he
[1:05:17] find faith
[1:05:18] [Applause]
[1:05:19] because he that endureth till the end
[1:05:21] he's the one that's going to be saved
[1:05:24] you see a falling over here falling
[1:05:27] there
[1:05:27] you see all kinds of things on the
[1:05:29] internet
[1:05:31] and let me tell you something half of
[1:05:32] those people most of those people
[1:05:35] have never even met brother branham
[1:05:37] [Music]
[1:05:39] [Applause]
[1:05:40] but i am so blessed to even hear uh
[1:05:44] a brother like uh t.l osborne
[1:05:47] amen who walked with brother branham who
[1:05:49] saw the miracles
[1:05:50] and you know what in so much he said i
[1:05:53] seen god in that man
[1:05:58] i seen god walking in that man i seen
[1:06:01] god
[1:06:02] working in that man hallelujah so i
[1:06:05] don't want this new
[1:06:06] a that's this new generation amen
[1:06:09] i don't care if you're uh a millennial
[1:06:12] or whatever it is
[1:06:13] brother i know this message is truth
[1:06:16] it is thus saith the lord and all that
[1:06:20] we
[1:06:20] have need of is in this message
[1:06:25] hallelujah rapturing faith is in this
[1:06:28] message
[1:06:29] the resurrection is in this message
[1:06:32] adoption is in this message
[1:06:34] hallelujah glory be to god the
[1:06:38] final and the great kill is in this
[1:06:41] message
[1:06:44] hey amen god bless you amen so
[1:06:48] anyway brother peter chandler thank you
[1:06:50] very much for that
[1:06:51] uh masterpiece last night amen i
[1:06:54] certainly did appreciate it was very
[1:06:56] blessed
[1:06:57] brother peter chandler has a way of just
[1:06:59] bringing
[1:07:00] uh things in a very simple way but
[1:07:03] powerful way you see because i
[1:07:07] uh he i was telling him i said you know
[1:07:10] he comes from a different angle
[1:07:12] sometimes but boom he hits the
[1:07:14] mark right there and then you have
[1:07:16] another minister come the next service
[1:07:18] and comes just slightly with different
[1:07:20] angle and boom
[1:07:21] hits the bullseye and the key i don't
[1:07:24] care how many angles you uh
[1:07:27] amen as long as we hit the bullseye
[1:07:30] amen glory be to god amen
[1:07:35] and i'm so thankful for this opportunity
[1:07:37] so god bless you richly
[1:07:39] uh right now i wish if you could uh
[1:07:42] stand to your feet
[1:07:44] amen i feel a great uh anointing here
[1:07:47] this morning and i know that god is
[1:07:48] going to bless
[1:07:49] us amen you get only what you come
[1:07:53] expecting huh so i want to turn
[1:07:57] with uh to familiar scriptures that we
[1:08:00] know of course
[1:08:01] malachi 4 malachi 4 verse
[1:08:06] 5 and 6 and i just want to pick up
[1:08:10] of course the theme of this uh
[1:08:14] ins of this convention
[1:08:18] because i believe that uh this is not
[1:08:21] just
[1:08:23] a question
[1:08:26] that we could just read look at
[1:08:30] and say okay that's a nice question this
[1:08:32] is
[1:08:33] a seasonal question this is a question
[1:08:36] for our
[1:08:37] age because if god
[1:08:40] is looking for faith
[1:08:44] he's got to provide a way
[1:08:48] to provide that which he's looking for
[1:08:52] and we're gonna find out by the grace of
[1:08:53] god even though people
[1:08:55] may or may not uh you know they may not
[1:08:59] see
[1:08:59] exactly but it's okay we're brothers and
[1:09:02] i always say
[1:09:03] the time has come amen broadly kindness
[1:09:07] never forget as we climb up the pyramid
[1:09:11] amen and as we approach amen that
[1:09:14] the great headstone has something has
[1:09:18] has got to have something to rest upon
[1:09:21] you see and never forget
[1:09:22] there's not many people that preach on
[1:09:24] the virtue of our
[1:09:26] age they talk about oh yeah all the
[1:09:29] power all the this and that but the
[1:09:30] virtue of our age
[1:09:31] let's not forget it amen because
[1:09:36] if we ignore it we'll never go to the
[1:09:38] next step
[1:09:40] amen god hallelujah because faith you
[1:09:43] know is based
[1:09:44] on forgiveness so let
[1:09:48] us turn to uh malachi 4
[1:09:51] and uh we'll read just two verses there
[1:09:55] uh malachi 4 we'll read two verses there
[1:09:58] and um
[1:10:03] verse 4 malachi 4 and verse
[1:10:06] rather verse 5. the reason this wise
[1:10:09] behold i will
[1:10:10] send you elijah the prophet
[1:10:14] now before the coming
[1:10:17] of the great and dreadful day of the
[1:10:19] lord
[1:10:20] now listen he had a purpose
[1:10:24] he had a commission and he shall turn to
[1:10:28] heart
[1:10:30] of the fathers to the children and the
[1:10:32] heart
[1:10:33] of the children to their fathers lest i
[1:10:36] come and smite the earth with
[1:10:39] a curse and we realize
[1:10:42] and i have often tried to explain to
[1:10:45] denominational people
[1:10:46] that malachi 4 malachi 3
[1:10:49] amen are two different messengers amen
[1:10:53] so
[1:10:53] we at the end of the age remember
[1:10:57] we uh have
[1:11:00] have a promise to receive a messenger
[1:11:05] with the requirements
[1:11:08] of what would be needed that when he
[1:11:11] comes
[1:11:12] he will find exactly what is needed in
[1:11:15] other words if i could rephrase it like
[1:11:17] this god has done his part
[1:11:20] and if we miss it is nobody else's fault
[1:11:23] but
[1:11:24] ours if we miss it
[1:11:28] it's no we we chose and have chosen to
[1:11:31] miss it
[1:11:33] we can't blame god for it all but i
[1:11:35] thought no no no no no
[1:11:37] amen he did his part so let us turn to
[1:11:40] saint luke 7
[1:11:41] rather 18 uh 8 luke 8
[1:11:44] 18 saint luke rather 18
[1:11:48] and verse 7.
[1:11:52] talking about the unjust judge but i do
[1:11:54] want to drop in there when the son of
[1:11:56] man cometh but
[1:11:58] verse 7 and shall not god avenge his own
[1:12:01] elect
[1:12:02] which cry day and night unto him
[1:12:05] though he bear along with them
[1:12:09] i tell you that he will avenge them
[1:12:13] speedily
[1:12:14] nevertheless when the son of man
[1:12:18] cometh shall he find faith
[1:12:21] on the earth what a great question
[1:12:25] last scripture reading found in jude
[1:12:28] and we'll have you have your seats
[1:12:36] in jude
[1:12:41] because what we realized my friend
[1:12:45] is that
[1:12:48] we realize that this faith that we are
[1:12:52] talking about is one faith there's only
[1:12:54] one faith one lord one baptism
[1:12:57] amen hallelujah
[1:13:02] we i remember i preached a message is
[1:13:04] christ divided
[1:13:06] way back way back in chile
[1:13:11] christ is never divided you know
[1:13:15] christ is never divided we divide christ
[1:13:20] it's the lack of revelation amen
[1:13:24] that brings division we're the ones that
[1:13:27] divide christ
[1:13:28] but let's read jude 1
[1:13:32] 3 beloved when i gave all diligence to
[1:13:36] write unto you
[1:13:37] of the common salvation it was needful
[1:13:40] for me to write unto you
[1:13:43] and exhort you that ye should
[1:13:46] earnestly contend
[1:13:49] for the faith which was once
[1:13:52] delivered unto the saints
[1:13:56] our heavenly father we have read your
[1:13:58] word
[1:13:59] lord we realize that just about anyone
[1:14:02] can read the bible
[1:14:03] lord those who
[1:14:06] you know have the ability o god to read
[1:14:09] the bible
[1:14:10] but only you your spirit can follow that
[1:14:13] word
[1:14:14] so i ask dear god that you would anoint
[1:14:17] this service in a special way and lord i
[1:14:21] pray for the next few minutes
[1:14:22] that it will be an encouragement to your
[1:14:24] people father
[1:14:26] lord take me out of the way and i pray
[1:14:28] that your spirit would have
[1:14:29] liberty father and may we realize the
[1:14:32] importance of this
[1:14:34] subject that uh brother god has given
[1:14:37] an inspiration to brother raymond
[1:14:39] thompson lord i believe is
[1:14:41] timely it is in season father god
[1:14:44] we've got to recognize that god has done
[1:14:47] his part
[1:14:48] and we must do our part amen and if we
[1:14:52] do our part he will
[1:14:53] find faith on the earth amen
[1:14:57] hallelujah we ask it in jesus name amen
[1:15:00] and amen god bless you you may be seated
[1:15:02] amen
[1:15:06] are you feeling good praise god
[1:15:09] hallelujah
[1:15:11] i am feeling very well
[1:15:14] i feel the anointing of the holy spirit
[1:15:17] in this place
[1:15:18] amen and um i had a a message that i was
[1:15:23] about to bring
[1:15:24] to south africa something that i had
[1:15:27] been uh meditating on and uh
[1:15:30] but the lord gave me a message
[1:15:33] on the way here so i
[1:15:38] i put it together pretty quickly and
[1:15:41] excuse me i had to put some notes on on
[1:15:44] this notebook and a little bit on that
[1:15:46] notebook
[1:15:46] preachers know i guess what what i'm
[1:15:48] talking about amen
[1:15:50] but i trust that god had just put it all
[1:15:52] together to make us
[1:15:53] understand amen so i was speaking
[1:15:57] uh on tuesday uh to brother raymond
[1:15:59] thompson
[1:16:01] uh over dinner and we'd be good to speak
[1:16:04] on the inspiration of this meeting and
[1:16:08] what a question amen the question is
[1:16:12] asked when the son of man
[1:16:15] cometh shall he find faith to me that is
[1:16:18] a deep question
[1:16:21] amen some pete because if when we
[1:16:24] realize and we walk out of this place
[1:16:26] we're going to find out
[1:16:32] you know denominations have faith they
[1:16:34] have faith to do things they have
[1:16:36] faith for healing they have all but
[1:16:39] that's not what i
[1:16:40] am talking about this morning this is
[1:16:42] not what we're talking about this
[1:16:43] morning
[1:16:44] us we have our faith has got to reach
[1:16:48] a higher level brother branham said we
[1:16:50] hardly have
[1:16:51] faith for divine healing amen but we
[1:16:55] have to have faith
[1:16:57] amen not only for divine healing but for
[1:17:00] the changing
[1:17:01] of the body glory be to god
[1:17:06] amen just before the resurrection
[1:17:09] praise this wonderful name and i like
[1:17:11] when brother branham talk about april
[1:17:20] forth that promised son amen
[1:17:23] uh they were old and stricken in age we
[1:17:26] all know that
[1:17:27] but god promised it god promised a son
[1:17:31] amen and of course ishmael come around
[1:17:34] and
[1:17:35] you know the the promise was slightly
[1:17:37] interrupted
[1:17:39] by reasoning let's do it this way or
[1:17:41] whatever then he
[1:17:42] no no but that's not what god said
[1:17:45] and he even testified when abraham was
[1:17:48] about to sacrifice
[1:17:50] isaac he said oh because you not have
[1:17:54] not withheld thy son thine only son
[1:18:00] thine only son because a seed will not
[1:18:04] be
[1:18:05] air what the shock praise god hallelujah
[1:18:09] amen you have been elected before the
[1:18:12] foundation of the world
[1:18:14] and i'm gonna tell you something it's
[1:18:16] not because you were
[1:18:18] a better person than somebody else amen
[1:18:21] it wasn't because your parent or or your
[1:18:24] daddy was a priest
[1:18:26] that has nothing to do with it amen
[1:18:28] because of
[1:18:29] before the foundation of the world one
[1:18:32] thing i like about
[1:18:33] election is that god is sovereign
[1:18:38] he doesn't have to ask anybody
[1:18:42] amen he chose abraham and said
[1:18:45] in blessing i will bless thee and
[1:18:48] multiply and i will multiply thee
[1:18:51] praise god and i'm gonna give you an
[1:18:53] unconditional covenant
[1:18:55] amen abraham i know you you're doing a
[1:18:57] good job but you can't hold
[1:18:59] your part of the deal so therefore i
[1:19:02] am gonna give you an unconditional
[1:19:05] covenant praise god
[1:19:06] i am gonna keep both parts amen
[1:19:09] hallelujah glory be to god
[1:19:12] brother if that don't make you happy i
[1:19:15] don't know what will
[1:19:16] amen nothing present nor things to come
[1:19:20] shall be able to separate you from the
[1:19:23] love of
[1:19:24] god so devil bring it on amen bring up
[1:19:28] the big guns
[1:19:29] because nothing present nor things to
[1:19:32] come
[1:19:33] shall be able to separate me from the
[1:19:36] love of
[1:19:36] god amen that's when a person has a
[1:19:40] revelation
[1:19:41] that's a person that cannot be shaken by
[1:19:44] denomination
[1:19:45] cannot be shaken by false interpretation
[1:19:48] he's standing on a rock and that bridge
[1:19:52] will pull
[1:19:56] across the bridge there'll be no sorrow
[1:20:00] amen hallelujah amen hallelujah but
[1:20:05] listen
[1:20:06] if there is a question here is what i
[1:20:09] want to say
[1:20:10] if there is a question then there is an
[1:20:12] answer
[1:20:16] if there is a question when the son of
[1:20:19] man cometh
[1:20:20] shall he find faith that is a question
[1:20:23] and if there's a question there it's got
[1:20:25] to be an answer
[1:20:26] and let me tell you something you may
[1:20:28] think that god
[1:20:29] doesn't know the answer but he has
[1:20:32] already answered
[1:20:34] the question he just wants to get you
[1:20:38] the revelation
[1:20:39] that the question has already been
[1:20:41] answered
[1:20:43] [Applause]
[1:20:44] hey amen hallelujah has already been
[1:20:48] answered
[1:20:49] amen so this theme this convention
[1:20:52] amen is very thought provoking
[1:20:56] and ministers and believers and church
[1:20:59] members or
[1:21:00] laity deacons ushers should really go
[1:21:05] home and not only home but throughout
[1:21:07] this meeting and think about this
[1:21:09] question
[1:21:10] because it is very important amen
[1:21:14] when the son of man cometh shall he find
[1:21:17] faith
[1:21:17] amen so i trust that the convention when
[1:21:20] it's all
[1:21:21] said and done we would understand amen
[1:21:24] that
[1:21:24] this is not just uh a
[1:21:28] a question for just a short period of
[1:21:30] time
[1:21:31] this is a question for the age
[1:21:38] it sounds simple people have read it
[1:21:40] many times
[1:21:41] but the deeper you you uh read it and
[1:21:44] you go into it and you go into it and
[1:21:47] you say you know
[1:21:47] this is something i must have
[1:21:54] this is something that is not optional
[1:21:58] this is something that if i don't have
[1:22:01] it
[1:22:02] hallelujah amen i will not be able to go
[1:22:06] and there is no one to blame but
[1:22:08] yourself
[1:22:09] i like that amen you see when god made a
[1:22:13] promise
[1:22:14] and he's always throughout the ages
[1:22:16] brother branham said
[1:22:18] in each age when god said a certain
[1:22:21] thing
[1:22:23] what happened he come
[1:22:26] uh here comes that man along
[1:22:31] behold i'll send you elijah the prophet
[1:22:35] now here's the preparation of the faith
[1:22:39] that we all need to have he's
[1:22:42] taking care of his word listen
[1:22:46] because the word cannot fail or fall to
[1:22:49] the ground because
[1:22:50] his reputation is on the line now hey
[1:22:53] hey man listen so uh in each age go
[1:22:57] when god said a certain thing would
[1:23:00] happen
[1:23:01] he come here come that man along
[1:23:04] and manifest that so somebody
[1:23:08] manifests what has already been spoken
[1:23:12] [Applause]
[1:23:14] the first is a manifestation of
[1:23:18] the spoken word
[1:23:21] but let us continue here but here come
[1:23:24] that people along
[1:23:26] and live that oh
[1:23:30] hallelujah here come that people
[1:23:34] along and live that
[1:23:37] so you just can't say i agree with that
[1:23:40] it's not enough to agree with that
[1:23:43] it's only enough amen to live that
[1:23:48] same and somebody praise god
[1:23:52] amen and only the elected seed of god
[1:23:55] can ever live that you know why let me
[1:23:59] tell you the reason why
[1:24:00] amen it's god himself
[1:24:03] living in the people amen because it's
[1:24:06] the
[1:24:07] answering of his word
[1:24:12] oh i'm just gonna walk around the pulpit
[1:24:14] here just a moment amen
[1:24:16] god promised the promise he asked the
[1:24:20] question
[1:24:20] but he's not waiting on you and i to
[1:24:24] really
[1:24:24] manifest these things because we cannot
[1:24:27] do it in ourselves
[1:24:30] you know why because it'll be god in the
[1:24:34] people
[1:24:35] [Music]
[1:24:36] because it's the answering of his word
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:41] christ in you you you you you you
[1:24:45] answering the question when the son of
[1:24:47] man cometh
[1:24:48] will he find faith on the earth yes he
[1:24:52] will
[1:24:52] he will find manifested sons of god
[1:24:56] he will find adopted sons of god
[1:24:59] he will find mature sons of god
[1:25:04] you're not the believer
[1:25:05] [Applause]
[1:25:08] brother brown said you're not the
[1:25:10] believer you don't have it in your flesh
[1:25:13] to believe this
[1:25:15] god has to put something in you before
[1:25:18] the foundation of the world
[1:25:20] to believe this
[1:25:28] [Applause]
[1:25:29] amen that's the difference others are
[1:25:33] trying to figure out
[1:25:34] intellectually but the real believer
[1:25:36] he's not worried about
[1:25:37] okay explain this to me explain that to
[1:25:41] me
[1:25:42] listen god is not known by explanation
[1:25:46] he's known by revelation
[1:25:51] and once you get it brother there's not
[1:25:54] a demon that can take it from you
[1:25:57] amen you're on your way to the
[1:26:00] [Applause]
[1:26:06] resurrection
[1:26:09] hey man i'm feeling good oh my god
[1:26:11] hallelujah
[1:26:13] so therefore listen you can be seated a
[1:26:15] moment just uh
[1:26:16] so i can get my breath i'm not as young
[1:26:19] as i
[1:26:19] used to be amen
[1:26:22] so the question is and was not will he
[1:26:26] find good people
[1:26:28] there are many many good people out
[1:26:30] there
[1:26:32] not will he find churches plenty of
[1:26:35] churches
[1:26:36] and in fact i will say this with respect
[1:26:39] and everything else
[1:26:41] that uh years ago and remember
[1:26:44] uh the first time i was here was 28
[1:26:47] years ago
[1:26:48] and everywhere i travel amen
[1:26:51] i see that uh there are more and more
[1:26:54] churches
[1:26:57] they say in america it's like mcdonald's
[1:27:01] there's a mcdonald's in every corner
[1:27:05] and we're so divided in that sense you
[1:27:08] know
[1:27:08] that everybody has to you know uh be a
[1:27:12] whatever and i'm not here to judge that
[1:27:14] at all i'm just here to make a point
[1:27:16] all right so so therefore we're more
[1:27:19] divided sometimes
[1:27:21] when we could see and recognize
[1:27:24] the move of god in some man's life and
[1:27:27] church
[1:27:28] why don't you unite with them and just
[1:27:30] put your shoulder to the wheel
[1:27:32] amen it used to be when mike when i
[1:27:34] first came here you hardly had
[1:27:36] any auditorium that can fill uh
[1:27:39] the these conventions it's d because it
[1:27:42] was an innocence of
[1:27:43] of people that just love to be together
[1:27:47] but something has happened over the
[1:27:49] years
[1:27:51] amen that has divided amen
[1:27:54] and i'm going to tell you who that
[1:27:56] person is that is the cause of division
[1:27:58] that's the devil
[1:28:02] that's the devil
[1:28:03] [Applause]
[1:28:07] the devil loves division
[1:28:10] the devil loves when you speak mean to
[1:28:13] somebody
[1:28:14] the devil loves when you don't want to
[1:28:17] call
[1:28:19] a person that just offended you he loves
[1:28:22] that
[1:28:22] so let us make it clear right now who
[1:28:26] is the the person behind that that is
[1:28:29] the devil
[1:28:31] amen but in this day and age we must
[1:28:34] be uh we cannot have these situations
[1:28:40] get us out of focus of what we're
[1:28:43] looking for
[1:28:44] [Applause]
[1:28:45] because there are so many distractions
[1:28:47] today that if we're
[1:28:49] if we get involved in every distraction
[1:28:54] we will miss the real
[1:28:58] promise to the bride
[1:28:59] [Applause]
[1:29:02] you know the bible says in in in
[1:29:04] revelation rather
[1:29:05] uh hebrews chapter 11 it speaks of this
[1:29:09] man
[1:29:10] called enoch and enoch had a testimony
[1:29:16] enoch had a testimony that he pleased
[1:29:18] god
[1:29:20] he walked with god amen he had this
[1:29:23] testimony
[1:29:25] and you know what's the beautiful thing
[1:29:26] about this is that
[1:29:28] god amen vindicated that testimony
[1:29:34] enoch was not testifying of himself now
[1:29:37] it was god who saw that enoch pleased
[1:29:42] god his testimony
[1:29:47] his life the way he lived
[1:29:50] was so pleasing to god amen that he said
[1:29:54] this
[1:29:54] is the time that i am going to call him
[1:29:57] home
[1:29:59] amen so the question that i have today
[1:30:03] we all have a testimony but what does
[1:30:06] god think of that testimony
[1:30:09] [Applause]
[1:30:11] we all had that testimony
[1:30:15] what is god saying about that testimony
[1:30:17] are we going to
[1:30:18] realize and bring it back to love you
[1:30:21] know a lot of people say oh that love is
[1:30:22] weak
[1:30:23] no well yeah love is weak but it's
[1:30:26] powerful
[1:30:28] amen but listen enoch had a testimony
[1:30:31] in hebrews chapter 11. 11 and god
[1:30:35] vouched and recognized his testimony
[1:30:38] he pleased god and one day he was
[1:30:42] found not and just to show you that this
[1:30:45] is an individual
[1:30:46] affair it wasn't just enoch and a whole
[1:30:49] bunch of people
[1:30:50] it was just enoch who was so
[1:30:54] who lived in such a way that he pleased
[1:30:57] god and i want you to realize today
[1:31:00] it is your individual walk with
[1:31:04] god that is giving testimony to god
[1:31:08] and is that testimony worthy of
[1:31:14] translation
[1:31:16] hallelujah amen
[1:31:19] so when god himself declares here's
[1:31:22] people who say oh bless
[1:31:24] god i am i am the greatest whatever
[1:31:27] you're testifying about yourself that's
[1:31:29] not what god's testifying about you
[1:31:32] praise god hallelujah you watch people
[1:31:35] that are so
[1:31:36] uh bragging about their own ministries
[1:31:39] and who they
[1:31:40] are and how big they are oh my my my i
[1:31:44] don't want to hear from you
[1:31:45] what you're saying that you are i want
[1:31:48] to hear from god
[1:31:50] what god what you're manifesting
[1:31:53] glory be to god because we have driven
[1:31:56] away we have gone away from the life the
[1:31:59] true meaning
[1:32:00] of this message it is a life behind the
[1:32:03] name
[1:32:04] that makes the demons tremble it's the
[1:32:08] life behind the name
[1:32:10] hey that makes the proud heart
[1:32:13] humble glory be to god
[1:32:16] because in you if you are true seed of
[1:32:19] god
[1:32:20] if you are a true wheat amen what is
[1:32:22] keeping you alive
[1:32:24] it is the life that is in you and
[1:32:27] whatever you
[1:32:28] hey whatever life is in you you cannot
[1:32:30] help but bear fruits
[1:32:34] others can't do it it's a different life
[1:32:38] hey hey amen let's let's let's move on
[1:32:41] but our faith
[1:32:42] has got to be ripened see amen into
[1:32:45] another level on our faith
[1:32:47] has to be matured amen has got to come
[1:32:51] to a place
[1:32:52] amen of maturity we've got to uh
[1:32:56] our faith is all these have been
[1:32:58] progressing progressing
[1:32:59] maturing you know brother brown said in
[1:33:01] 1965
[1:33:03] intellectually we have listening we've
[1:33:05] been listening to the message but it had
[1:33:08] to lay in the presence of the son for a
[1:33:10] while
[1:33:11] to mature he realized that he
[1:33:15] see he sold the seed
[1:33:19] of the entire bible for this body
[1:33:23] [Music]
[1:33:25] one now people may uh disagree with me i
[1:33:28] heard i i've got some emails and so
[1:33:30] forth
[1:33:30] well i don't believe it's one man
[1:33:32] message and so forth yet well you know
[1:33:34] what here's the thing
[1:33:35] i always believe
[1:33:39] and i'm very very positive about this
[1:33:42] brother i say what he said
[1:33:46] it's not my words amen i say what he
[1:33:50] said the fire falls
[1:33:51] i walk out and it's still anointed today
[1:33:56] people don't even want to hear tapes
[1:33:58] anymore they no longer want to do this
[1:34:00] or that
[1:34:01] they're trying to criticize this message
[1:34:04] over the internet but i'm going to tell
[1:34:06] you something that this
[1:34:07] angel is still standing on the earth
[1:34:11] amen bringing the people
[1:34:12] back to perfection by the word of god
[1:34:16] oh hallelujah he still heals the sick
[1:34:20] he still delivers amen i've seen it
[1:34:25] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:34:27] and forever he cannot change amen
[1:34:30] hallelujah but let's look at ina he had
[1:34:32] a testimony
[1:34:33] praise god that he uh uh pleased
[1:34:36] god so what kind of testimony is my
[1:34:39] question what kind of testimony
[1:34:40] in this last days will we have
[1:34:45] that that christ can recognize and say
[1:34:48] oh
[1:34:49] that's a testimony that is pleasing he's
[1:34:52] a
[1:34:52] i say and you know the bible says it is
[1:34:54] impossible
[1:34:56] to please god with our faith
[1:35:00] so we must have a god-pleasing faith
[1:35:08] amen now here is
[1:35:11] uh i'm going to get into the the sermon
[1:35:13] now just have
[1:35:14] a few minutes i'm just going to try to
[1:35:16] uh uh
[1:35:17] abide by it sure but now let's look at
[1:35:21] in matthew chapter 8
[1:35:23] the roman centurion
[1:35:27] listen to this is so beautiful
[1:35:30] this roman centurion was not of
[1:35:33] religious background
[1:35:37] in fact he never claimed that he was
[1:35:39] religious or whatever
[1:35:42] but he had a problem and the problem was
[1:35:45] his servant
[1:35:47] was very sick very
[1:35:50] very sick now
[1:35:54] oh i love this because this is not a
[1:35:56] priest this is not a religious person
[1:35:58] this is
[1:35:59] this is a gentile this is a roman but
[1:36:02] you see he got a he had a revelation no
[1:36:05] doubt he was looking
[1:36:06] at jesus from a distance and how
[1:36:09] the demons were being cast out by a word
[1:36:12] and
[1:36:12] and uh when you're laying and he's
[1:36:15] laying his hands on
[1:36:16] people they will walk and the blind will
[1:36:18] see amen and he caught a revelation now
[1:36:22] now remember faith is a revelation
[1:36:26] because what he recognized he said you
[1:36:28] know what i
[1:36:29] am a man of authority
[1:36:32] and i have men under me that when i tell
[1:36:35] them to go they go
[1:36:38] when i tell them to come they come
[1:36:41] so he recognized
[1:36:45] that this man jesus who was called jesus
[1:36:48] had authority
[1:36:53] that he himself did not even have to go
[1:36:57] he sent his servants or whoever was
[1:37:00] to go for him and he told
[1:37:04] jesus one day when he asked for
[1:37:07] the healing of a servant oh
[1:37:10] i uh oh just he said jesus
[1:37:14] master hey i have a servant who is at
[1:37:18] home
[1:37:22] now remember he wasn't christian because
[1:37:23] he said i'm not worthy you come under my
[1:37:25] house
[1:37:28] now you think that oh the religious
[1:37:30] people had the faith
[1:37:32] but this was a roman centurion
[1:37:35] oh people are going to be very shocked
[1:37:37] that day
[1:37:39] and find out who makes it and who does
[1:37:40] it
[1:37:42] amen hallelujah people are all righteous
[1:37:46] and everything else will bless
[1:37:47] god i don't need god let me tell you
[1:37:49] something let me put
[1:37:50] let me bust your bubble we all have to
[1:37:53] come down we all need the faith
[1:37:55] this faith that i'm talking about
[1:37:59] and brother branham said a righteous man
[1:38:02] is not a sinless man
[1:38:04] a righteous man is a man who recognized
[1:38:08] that when he sinned he gets right with
[1:38:10] god
[1:38:11] [Applause]
[1:38:13] [Music]
[1:38:14] hallelujah people don't like to repent
[1:38:18] people don't like to make
[1:38:19] right with god they cannot be righteous
[1:38:22] but those that
[1:38:23] recognize when they have done wrong
[1:38:26] amen and go to god lord forgive me
[1:38:29] that's a righteous man
[1:38:33] and david was a man after god's own
[1:38:35] heart amen
[1:38:36] he had his fair share of problems but he
[1:38:40] was a
[1:38:40] man after god's own heart sure he failed
[1:38:44] sure he made mistakes but he sought the
[1:38:47] lord
[1:38:48] he sought the heart of god amen and
[1:38:51] that's the bride of jesus christ
[1:38:53] we're not ashamed to apologize to a
[1:38:56] brother
[1:38:57] we're not ashamed to say i'm sorry we're
[1:38:59] not ashamed to say you know
[1:39:01] i misunderstood you amen hallelujah
[1:39:05] the devil hates that but that's a
[1:39:07] righteous man
[1:39:13] say a man somebody
[1:39:16] glory be to god hallelujah
[1:39:20] hey amen glory be to god
[1:39:25] so he said oh i'm not worthy come over
[1:39:27] the uh
[1:39:28] uh in my room you know what but speak
[1:39:30] the word only
[1:39:32] just speak the word only but here's what
[1:39:35] i want to
[1:39:36] point out here right now
[1:39:40] speak the word only what a faith
[1:39:44] and in so much that jesus marveled
[1:39:52] he said you know i've been in israel
[1:39:55] i've walked around in every village i've
[1:39:58] gone around
[1:40:00] every amen case but i have not found
[1:40:05] this kind of faith in all of israel
[1:40:12] why because somehow some way
[1:40:15] this roman centurion his faith was on
[1:40:18] another level
[1:40:19] it was a spoken word faith
[1:40:23] it was out of season back then but is in
[1:40:26] season now
[1:40:28] speak the word only the sick will be
[1:40:32] healed by a word
[1:40:33] hallelujah the devils will shake
[1:40:37] and hallelujah and he's doing his best
[1:40:39] to divide us
[1:40:40] he's doing his best to weaken the body
[1:40:43] but i'm gonna tell you satan is too late
[1:40:47] too late there's gonna be a gathering of
[1:40:50] the bride of jesus christ
[1:40:52] amen shall be flesh of his flesh bone of
[1:40:55] his bone
[1:40:56] life of his life the same power the same
[1:40:59] spirit
[1:40:59] the same anointing
[1:41:04] glory be to god hallelujah oh
[1:41:08] my my my excuse me a minute i
[1:41:12] i told brother john conte last night
[1:41:16] brother if you don't have dancing shoes
[1:41:18] you better have dancing
[1:41:20] feet amen because i don't shoes or no
[1:41:24] shoes
[1:41:25] something on the inside if that doesn't
[1:41:27] make the believers
[1:41:29] if that doesn't make the elect of god
[1:41:32] amen charge with faith
[1:41:36] hallelujah you're not the believer
[1:41:39] the seed in you is the believer
[1:41:44] because it is the answering of his word
[1:41:48] [Music]
[1:41:49] god said will he find faith yes he'll
[1:41:52] find faith
[1:41:53] because a seed of god is in you
[1:42:01] glory lauren

[1:42:54] that sounds like a fairy tale no it's
[1:42:56] not amen this is thus saith the lord
[1:42:59] so it just shows amen it's not to the
[1:43:02] religious
[1:43:03] it's not to the good amen it's the
[1:43:05] somebody that has a revelation

[1:45:38] to malachi 4 he will
[1:45:41] turn the hearts of the children
[1:45:44] to the fathers and
[1:45:47] number two he will reveal the
[1:45:50] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:45:54] revelations
[1:45:56] 10.
[1:46:02] [Applause]
[1:46:10] hmm

[1:46:22] the mystery of the seven thunders
[1:46:24] uh in revelations 10 which are the
[1:46:27] revelations
[1:46:29] the revelations now revelations can only
[1:46:34] be divinely revealed
[1:46:36] or else it still remains a mystery
[1:46:44] and it's still a mystery to many people
[1:46:49] it was divinely revealed to the prophet
[1:46:52] and as much as he could say he said it
[1:46:56] but he knew that somebody
[1:47:00] will see the divinely revealed truth
[1:47:08] i'm talking about you and i now amen
[1:47:11] we've got to come to perfection listen
[1:47:13] no matter let me just say this
[1:47:17] no matter how much you are in the
[1:47:19] message
[1:47:21] you can never get around this
[1:47:24] [Applause]
[1:47:28] this is a message on teaching
[1:47:31] [Music]
[1:47:33] statue of a perfect man
[1:47:36] amen that ties the man in
[1:47:41] listen if you're gonna be tied in
[1:47:44] this is a message on teaching
[1:47:47] [Applause]
[1:47:49] so call it what you want to call it say
[1:47:52] what you want to say
[1:47:54] but the way to holiness the way to
[1:47:58] perfect faith
[1:47:59] is this way
[1:48:09] hallelujah
[1:48:15] amen now listen these are the seven
[1:48:18] thunders of revelations

[1:48:23] in the seven seals there contains seven
[1:48:27] amen there are revelations in the
[1:48:29] seventh seal
[1:48:31] amen but listen as i continue the quote
[1:48:35] it will be these divinely revealed
[1:48:38] truths
[1:48:43] now malachi 4 had a commission to
[1:48:46] restore the faith
[1:48:48] but without it being divinely revealed
[1:48:55] malachi 4 could not be accomplished
[1:48:58] it would not be able to turn the hearts
[1:49:00] of the children back to the father
[1:49:03] so these these are connected and you
[1:49:06] can't separate it

[1:50:05] audience
[1:50:08] and he began to discern just like the

[1:52:10] how special you are
[1:52:12] how special you are do you think that
[1:52:16] those
[1:52:16] are millions probably and thousands and
[1:52:19] thousands of people
[1:52:20] way back when when brother branham
[1:52:24] was showing the signs and discerning the
[1:52:26] hearts of the people and trying to
[1:52:28] identify the revealing of the son of man
[1:52:31] they saw those things but there was
[1:52:34] nothing in them to catch it
[1:52:36] [Applause]
[1:52:36] [Music]
[1:52:40] some of them said they sat on a platform
[1:52:43] half asleep
[1:52:44] but meanwhile god was being unveiled
[1:52:48] hallelujah the son of man being unveiled
[1:52:52] scripture was being fulfilled
[1:52:56] so they did not catch it you know why
[1:53:00] the message was not for them
[1:53:03] [Applause]
[1:53:06] the prophet put it in c4
[1:53:08] [Music]
[1:53:10] and said this seed has to lay in the
[1:53:13] presence
[1:53:14] of the sun for a while to ripen
[1:53:17] because all along the prophet was sowing
[1:53:20] seeds
[1:53:21] but he knew right then that generation
[1:53:24] wasn't going to catch it
[1:53:28] oh but there's got to be
[1:53:32] a seed that's been in the ground
[1:53:36] brother chandler about 50 years or so
[1:53:38] now oh
[1:53:40] somewhere somehow
[1:53:44] god has got a crop somewhere
[1:53:49] [Music]
[1:53:52] that seed that was in the ground is
[1:53:54] maturing
[1:53:55] it's coming to perfection
[1:53:58] glory be to god hallelujah oh i'm
[1:54:02] talking about you
[1:54:03] i'm talking about this portion of the
[1:54:05] bride of jesus christ
[1:54:08] you wasn't ready back then of course not
[1:54:11] but you had to mature
[1:54:14] listen in corinthians 13
[1:54:17] they said when i was a child i spake as
[1:54:20] a child
[1:54:23] which means if you can just look at how
[1:54:26] the scripture
[1:54:27] is written when i was a child
[1:54:30] i understood as a child i couldn't
[1:54:32] understand
[1:54:34] my limited understanding i i thought as
[1:54:37] a child
[1:54:38] i did as a child but when i mature
[1:54:43] wonder grain becomes more mature
[1:54:47] when it comes to maturity i changed my
[1:54:51] walk
[1:54:55] i changed my talk
[1:54:57] [Applause]
[1:55:00] those little things i don't play with
[1:55:02] those things no more
[1:55:05] i am a man now
[1:55:12] and that's what god is looking for amen
[1:55:15] a statue of a perfect man amen this
[1:55:19] is what will tie that man in
[1:55:22] into that eter eternal church age at the
[1:55:25] end of the seals
[1:55:27] [Applause]
[1:55:30] now i'm not preaching doctrine i'm just
[1:55:32] saying what he said
[1:55:35] [Applause]
[1:55:39] just just just food for thought you know
[1:55:41] glory be to god
[1:55:43] amen so in every age you had to see the
[1:55:47] time
[1:55:47] so if god promised amen malachi 4.
[1:55:51] amen a messenger according to malachi 4
[1:55:54] revelations 10 7
[1:55:55] saint luke 17 30. these scriptures
[1:55:58] were anointed were
[1:56:02] assigned to a a specific
[1:56:05] person that was supposed to come on the
[1:56:08] scene
[1:56:10] so you've got to know your place in the
[1:56:12] scripture
[1:56:14] because then you have scriptural
[1:56:15] vindication
[1:56:18] and brother branham recognize that
[1:56:21] see now number one see a word
[1:56:24] see the message came forth
[1:56:30] it wasn't moses message
[1:56:34] see because not only has a word
[1:56:37] has to be true but it has to be rightly
[1:56:40] divided
[1:56:45] so there are no more pharaohs in this
[1:56:47] message no more dictators no more
[1:56:49] nothing dude no no
[1:56:51] no if you divided that you divided it
[1:56:54] incorrect
[1:56:57] i'm talking about our word
[1:57:02] our time amen to the elect
[1:57:06] lady and what makes you
[1:57:11] let me just say the only thing that
[1:57:14] makes you different from all the rest
[1:57:18] you want to know what that is
[1:57:23] not you not your life not how you say
[1:57:26] amen how much you shout
[1:57:28] no no no no the only difference because
[1:57:30] you know what
[1:57:31] if that was the case pentecost will
[1:57:33] outdo us
[1:57:36] brother because they can make a lot of
[1:57:37] noise they can make a lot of shout and
[1:57:40] everything else
[1:57:41] they're out to us but the only thing
[1:57:45] that makes you different from the rest
[1:57:48] because your name was written in the
[1:57:50] land
[1:57:51] book of life before the foundation of
[1:57:54] the world
[1:57:56] [Applause]
[1:58:01] but you could not know this
[1:58:04] amen you could not know this but when
[1:58:08] the prophet
[1:58:10] malachi 4 saint luke 17
[1:58:13] 30. oh revelations 10 7
[1:58:17] when he waved way back
[1:58:20] [Applause]
[1:58:22] and pulled out the curtain
[1:58:25] there you saw your name
[1:58:27] [Applause]
[1:58:30] brother and when i saw my name that's it
[1:58:34] i'm going up i'm
[1:58:37] going up i'm going up in the first
[1:58:41] resurrection amen i don't care what the
[1:58:45] opposition is
[1:58:47] i don't care how many devils don't
[1:58:49] believe it
[1:58:50] amen that has nothing to do with me amen
[1:58:53] i have a revelation
[1:58:55] that my name is written in the lamb's
[1:58:58] book of life
[1:59:00] amen oh hallelujah
[1:59:04] listen and i'm gonna i'm gonna say this
[1:59:06] while i'm closing
[1:59:07] listen uh and the devil
[1:59:11] listen he always speaks without
[1:59:14] proof and authority whatever he can only
[1:59:16] assume
[1:59:17] that's the devil's realm
[1:59:20] and the devil's job is to tell you and
[1:59:22] i've said this many times before
[1:59:24] is to tell you know what your name is
[1:59:26] not there
[1:59:27] [Music]
[1:59:29] it's not there look at what you did
[1:59:31] yesterday

[1:59:36] months ago or whatever three years
[1:59:38] 10 years ago look what you did and he
[1:59:40] always puts that back in your face
[1:59:45] but there's something in your heart
[1:59:48] a predestinated seed
[1:59:50] [Applause]
[1:59:52] that speaks back to the devil
[1:59:54] [Music]
[1:59:56] and said devil
[1:59:59] show me where i actually did that let's
[2:00:01] go back
[2:00:04] let's go back a little further
[2:00:08] let you know somewhere on the journey
[2:00:12] back he's got to jump off the train
[2:00:16] you know why before satan was created
[2:00:21] you were way back then before the
[2:00:25] foundation of the world
[2:00:27] so if he wasn't there how can you
[2:00:31] he tell you that your name is not
[2:00:34] in the book
[2:00:38] before the devil was i won
[2:00:41] [Applause]

[2:01:51] oh hallelujah where was that
[2:01:56] amen hallelujah you were beyond this
[2:02:00] condition you are beyond defeat you were
[2:02:03] with the manifested

[2:03:28] that was once delivered to the saints
[2:03:31] amen and god that's the kind of faith
[2:03:33] that's going to go we we need rapturing
[2:03:35] faith now
[2:03:37] because as i said what we have sometimes
[2:03:39] it's hardly
[2:03:40] enough faith or healing or whatever but
[2:03:44] this this is what i love really see uh
[2:03:47] in 1954 god has a provided way he says
[2:03:51] and now

[2:03:56] into another great age
[2:04:02] see he was referring now to the bright
[2:04:05] age
[2:04:06] because remember he come at the end of
[2:04:09] the laodicean church age and laodicea
[2:04:13] was already finished
[2:04:15] so he called up people out of laodicea
[2:04:19] and according to the scripture and i
[2:04:21] love how uh
[2:04:22] it's it's written there god took us out
[2:04:25] to put us in
[2:04:27] he doesn't just take us out and just
[2:04:29] leave us in the middle of the year
[2:04:31] see but listen this is the last chord i
[2:04:33] ran out of time but listen
[2:04:35] we're moving uh and now we're moving
[2:04:37] right into another great age coming
[2:04:39] for the rapture this is our
[2:04:43] age there's no other age after this
[2:04:47] amen i don't care how much you plan on
[2:04:48] your 401ks and
[2:04:51] amen your bank account it doesn't matter
[2:04:53] brother i'd rather have
[2:04:54] i you know where i bank i bank on the in
[2:04:57] the first
[2:04:58] uh blood bank of redemption that's where
[2:05:00] i
[2:05:01] [Applause]
[2:05:03] and you know every time i write a check
[2:05:06] it never returns void
[2:05:11] oh praise god hallelujah who cares if
[2:05:14] the stock markets go down
[2:05:16] or governments are closing whatever you
[2:05:18] know why
[2:05:19] because here we have no continuing city
[2:05:21] but we seek
[2:05:22] one to come
[2:05:24] [Applause]
[2:05:27] see a great age coming for the rapture
[2:05:29] of the church and now
[2:05:30] this we're living in the last time of
[2:05:33] the restoration of the gifts
[2:05:35] see it stumbled many of the big fine
[2:05:40] churches it wasn't for them see and it
[2:05:43] sent
[2:05:43] nazarenes backwards amen
[2:05:47] it made fanatics out of a lot of
[2:05:49] pentecostals
[2:05:50] and i'm going to tell you something it
[2:05:53] happens
[2:05:53] all the time it's i always say
[2:05:57] the message is pure and it's always
[2:06:00] right
[2:06:02] the message is not wrong amen i
[2:06:05] i challenge you to take a close
[2:06:07] examination and you realize if you are
[2:06:09] sincere
[2:06:10] and you and you study this message you
[2:06:12] realize that you are wrong
[2:06:14] i am wrong christ is not divided he
[2:06:18] remains one
[2:06:19] one faith one lord one god one baptism
[2:06:22] one truth
[2:06:23] amen so therefore see but just the same
[2:06:27] god is moving right along bringing in
[2:06:30] the rapturing faith of his church that's
[2:06:33] right so tonight
[2:06:35] here's brother branham identifying
[2:06:39] the requirement amen
[2:06:42] when the son of man come in will he
[2:06:46] find faith so therefore tonight
[2:06:50] i represent the faith
[2:06:53] the faith that was once delivered
[2:06:57] to the saints
[2:06:59] [Applause]
[2:07:01] god has done his part i
[2:07:05] represent the faith not just
[2:07:08] pentecostal faith or denominational
[2:07:10] faith he said i represent the faith
[2:07:14] amen so therefore i'm just gonna uh
[2:07:18] just ten minutes that's it ten minutes
[2:07:19] i'm done i'm really done ten
[2:07:21] ten minutes i just want to just strike
[2:07:23] one thing because i oh
[2:07:26] hey man just one thing oh my my mind
[2:07:31] i'm gonna close with this because we
[2:07:33] realize it's sea time right time
[2:07:36] if a seed is a c a chuck is a shock and
[2:07:38] a tears of terror
[2:07:40] now now it's not my responsibility to
[2:07:43] categorize anybody
[2:07:45] in my uh i have to believe that
[2:07:47] everybody's a brother
[2:07:49] and i have to treat everyone as a
[2:07:51] brother
[2:07:52] and a sister you know why because that
[2:07:55] is the nature of a true seed
[2:07:59] but if we realize in matthew the parable
[2:08:01] i'll just paraphrase it
[2:08:02] the the parable in matthew how the sower
[2:08:05] went out and
[2:08:08] he sold good seeds in matthew chapter 13
[2:08:13] and while he rested there was someone
[2:08:16] the enemy who came in with
[2:08:19] tears and in the beginning
[2:08:24] uh you couldn't tell until they begin to
[2:08:28] bud and realize wait a minute
[2:08:31] and the question was asked by his uh
[2:08:34] helpers there
[2:08:36] uh wow they i thought we sold good seed
[2:08:40] i thought we i thought we sold uh amen
[2:08:43] every seed
[2:08:44] from genesis to revelations according to
[2:08:46] what brother branham said i thought we
[2:08:48] did
[2:08:48] you see but meanwhile they realized
[2:08:52] that amen there were tears
[2:08:55] among the fields
[2:08:58] now here's i'm going to close with this
[2:09:03] we don't have an option now
[2:09:07] the wheat
[2:09:10] must grow very closely
[2:09:21] intertwine and everything else whatever
[2:09:24] and even sometimes
[2:09:25] squeeze you to a point that that the see
[2:09:28] the the
[2:09:28] the tears will make the seas
[2:09:32] growth very tough sometimes
[2:09:37] but here in closing a we
[2:09:40] is we
[2:09:47] because no matter how that close they
[2:09:49] grew together
[2:09:51] a week could never change
[2:09:58] because it was planted with the original
[2:10:00] seed
[2:10:02] good seed so
[2:10:05] you hear sometimes excuses well you know
[2:10:08] this brother or that brother this and
[2:10:10] that
[2:10:11] look listen it's not our responsibility
[2:10:14] to say who is
[2:10:16] who is wheat and who is here
[2:10:19] but if you are wheat you will never
[2:10:23] live a life of a tear
[2:10:26] it cannot change you
[2:10:30] so don't tell me because you're so close
[2:10:32] to this
[2:10:33] and you're being squeezed this way and
[2:10:36] that way
[2:10:37] that it's because no a wheat is a weak
[2:10:42] a shock is a shock and a tear is a tear
[2:10:47] because now we've come down to seed time
[2:10:51] bride time and by their fruits
[2:10:55] you shall know them
[2:10:57] [Applause]
[2:11:00] in this last days jesus said
[2:11:04] leave them alone don't don't because you
[2:11:07] may destroy
[2:11:08] the weeds you may be more you might do
[2:11:12] more damage to the wheat
[2:11:14] but let them grow together but here
[2:11:18] remember no matter how close you get no
[2:11:21] matter how
[2:11:22] a hard time
[2:11:25] the tares may give you never
[2:11:28] act like a tear because you
[2:11:32] are weak
[2:11:36] you can say i will love you
[2:11:39] even though you don't love me i love you
[2:11:43] we have to have the love of god
[2:11:47] and it's not our responsibility
[2:11:50] to separate from them because god
[2:11:53] himself said
[2:11:55] in the time of harvest i will separate
[2:11:58] them
[2:12:00] so the test is on
[2:12:04] you're gonna walk out of here i'm going
[2:12:06] to tell you i hope
[2:12:08] and pray that when we leave this place
[2:12:11] amen we are in love with everybody
[2:12:14] [Applause]
[2:12:16] we are in love with everybody god bless
[2:12:19] you
[2:12:20] god bless you my brother listen i
[2:12:23] know you spoke very hard things about me
[2:12:26] but listen i am a weak
[2:12:28] god bless you my brother
[2:12:33] and that's the life
[2:12:37] [Applause]
[2:12:39] god will separate it don't worry about
[2:12:41] it but we're here for a season
[2:12:43] now who is wheaton who is uh uh tara i
[2:12:46] don't know that's not my business that's
[2:12:47] the you know i i'm just trying to
[2:12:50] live my life as much as i can to be a
[2:12:54] real
[2:12:54] christian and to bear
[2:12:58] the right fruit because
[2:13:02] i'm going to tell you something there's
[2:13:03] a lot of people that say hey
[2:13:05] i am a christian i am in a message and
[2:13:07] brother they are as
[2:13:08] mean denominations that treat you better
[2:13:18] but i'm going to tell you something
[2:13:19] that's not the faith that's going to
[2:13:20] make it
[2:13:21] [Music]
[2:13:28] we have the musicians okay we have to be
[2:13:30] magnified
[2:13:32] magnetized to the headstone
[2:13:35] remember brother graham told the story
[2:13:38] the gods great magnet or the great
[2:13:40] magnet that
[2:13:41] went around and just lifted up only that
[2:13:43] which was attracted to the magnet
[2:13:46] so you it means that you have to be
[2:13:48] bribed material
[2:13:51] hey you could have driven a nice car you
[2:13:54] could have sprayed it
[2:13:55] amen and it looked like a
[2:13:58] metal and it looked like the whole i
[2:14:01] mean
[2:14:01] whole thing but the test comes when it
[2:14:04] ends up in the junkyard
[2:14:07] and the magnet is turned on and you
[2:14:09] realize that
[2:14:10] your car is not going up nowhere
[2:14:13] you have to have bride material
[2:14:18] so i will close with this amen
[2:14:21] the faith has been restored
[2:14:27] i'll close with this amen it'll
[2:14:30] be these uh divinely revealed truths
[2:14:36] some people look into seven students
[2:14:37] don't see nothing because it still
[2:14:40] remains to them
[2:14:42] a mystery but to others a revelation
[2:14:46] amen and they're hearing that voice amen
[2:14:50] hallelujah prepare for the bridegroom
