[52:34] seated did you ever hear a lamb die is
[52:38] the most pitiful thing you ever heard a
[52:41] poor little lamb when they go to kill it
[52:45] he sees even the instruments they're
[52:47] going to kill him with he starts crying
[52:49] and begging sometime ago I watch them
[52:52] they're going to chop a lamb head off I
[52:54] butcher to kill him when that poor lamb
[52:56] saw the axe coming he just started
[52:58] crying and going on I couldn't stay
[53:00] there I watched it poke the little lamb
[53:03] and then there the Lance knife go under
[53:04] his throat and then it's dying and
[53:07] kicking his hands are paain in blood he
[53:09] looks up to Jehovah and say Jehovah That
[53:11] should be me but the lamb taken my place
[53:15] and when a man went back with the same
[53:17] design in his heart he talking about
[53:18] when you come to offer up your sacrifice
[53:20] and you lay your hands upon the lamb and
[53:22] the priest skeleton stab it and you feel
[53:24] like jerk yes and you know that's
[53:26] supposed to be you but the lamb taken it
[53:28] your place that man went back with the
[53:31] same design as heart to sin that he ever
[53:33] had because the life that was in the
[53:35] blood of the Lamb was animal life an
[53:38] animal life an animal life Spirit could
[53:42] not come back and blend with the human
[53:45] spirit for one is an animal and the
[53:47] other is human but when Jesus died at
[53:51] Calvary and the worshiper ever comes to
[53:53] Calvary by Faith lay his hands upon the
[53:56] head of the Son of God when he's
[53:58] confessing his wrong and he feels the
[54:01] tear and the agony of Calvary that
[54:03] really paid the price the debt that he
[54:05] should pay he feeds at his own soul hear
[54:08] this part now and the life that was in
[54:11] the blood cell of Jesus Christ was none
[54:14] other than God himself and when that
[54:16] Holy Spirit that was in Christ's Blood
[54:19] come back on him and makes him a new
[54:22] creature in Christ Jesus therefore the
[54:25] man's spirit is Blended out and God come
[54:30] in and take over Oh Glory of God so in
[54:34] other words Hallelujah he said your
[54:36] spirit is Blended out and the Holy Ghost
[54:39] Blends in and takes over isn't that
[54:43] right then they got fellowship with one
[54:45] another and the Very God that created
[54:47] heaven and earth that wrote this word
[54:48] dwells in you and you will believe
[54:51] everything God wrote is the truth you
[54:53] will accept it and believe it and hold
[54:55] on to it and you will have Fellowship oh
[54:58] give the Lord Praises praise God we were
[55:01] born in sin we were shaping leave the
[55:04] children alone they would lie they will
[55:06] steal they will fornicate they will do
[55:08] whatever wrong because that's the nature
[55:10] inside of them something has to happen
[55:12] from above glory to God notice a lot of
[55:15] these big rich people have one child and
[55:18] after a while they commit suicide
[55:20] because they have all the house for the
[55:21] child cars for the child they give the
[55:23] child everything the child do have to
[55:24] labor for nothing the child you have to
[55:26] work this one is a multi-millionaire
[55:27] this one is a multi-billionaire but the
[55:29] child is wrecked and ruined because the
[55:31] child didn't come a normal life Oh Glory
[55:34] to God life itself is very stressful and
[55:37] painful but God put it that way like the
[55:39] chicken in the eggshell if you help it
[55:41] you will kill it it had to pip it had to
[55:44] boss it had to break and today you come
[55:46] to church there are things you have to
[55:48] break out of you have to boss you have
[55:50] to hit you have to keep nudging nudging
[55:52] nudging but the beauty about breaking up
[55:55] once you break out the devil can put you
[55:56] back in oh give the Lord I shout one
[55:59] there's a barrier one there's a
[56:01] hindrance once there's a
[56:03] [Applause]
[56:06] limitation even jobwise even business-
[56:09] wise once you break out a certain level
[56:11] they can't push you back in because you
[56:13] break out Hallelujah and I feel we have
[56:15] got to break out we must well break out
[56:18] today we must break out some point in
[56:20] time why why today can't be that day
[56:23] that you break out that you break get
[56:25] [Applause]
[56:26] [Music]
[56:28] true may see talk about the plane
[56:31] breaking the song barrier and when it's
[56:33] about to break the song barrier he say
[56:35] it be rocking and shaking but once it
[56:37] bust through the b b barrier it is free
[56:40] sailing then oh glory to God you got to
[56:42] see what you got to break through
[56:44] sometime you're finding so resistance
[56:46] you're finding so opposition you're
[56:47] finding so much of pressure you got to
[56:49] break through you got to want to break

[56:54] Oh Glory to God that Joseph had pressure

[56:58] think it was a hard experience for
[57:00] Joseph it was a bitter experience nobody
[57:02] want to go through that your own
[57:03] Brethren sell you out your own Breen
[57:05] sell you to strangers with a different
[57:07] tongue and different language but Joseph
[57:09] couldn't see down the road but God had a
[57:12] vision for Joseph and God have a vision
[57:15] for you you can't see down the road but
[57:17] down the road have a higher order down
[57:19] the road have a higher purpose down the

[59:00] tongue yesterday we talked about that a
[59:02] little bit about your
[59:04] tongue do you could say the right thing
[59:07] that a woman with the daughter V the
[59:09] devil and and you say for this saying
[59:11] your daughter is made whole and you can

[59:20] disrespectful Elijah and then some beers
[59:22] he cursed them and some beers come and

[1:03:39] your peace let it be gone then it will
[1:03:43] vulcanize you can add to your feet all
[1:03:47] right the Great Seal measuring the
[1:03:50] permid the permid started to represent
[1:03:53] the church why right at the bottom and
[1:03:56] as it goes to the top it begins to get
[1:03:58] like funn in shape we find out it get
[1:04:01] right to the peak to the top they never
[1:04:04] that completed why because the Bible
[1:04:07] said The Headstone was rejected oh God
[1:04:10] so the pyramid always stands without the
[1:04:12] headstone a sign headstone rejected
[1:04:16] don't miss this the church has come from
[1:04:18] the beginning of the Reformation Luther
[1:04:20] back in the times the foundation Stones
[1:04:21] was laid was the doctrine of the apost
[1:04:24] Apostles Luther preach justification and
[1:04:26] now we find out in the days of Wesley
[1:04:28] you was a holy ruler if you confess
[1:04:30] Christ that was the new method and they
[1:04:32] finally got to a place till the holy
[1:04:34] spirit will fall on them and they will
[1:04:36] fall on the floor of course you don't
[1:04:39] hear that no more in the message but
[1:04:40] this is what used to happen they were so
[1:04:43] they were so Sanctified that it
[1:04:45] attracted the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[1:04:47] Ghost us to fall on them and they used
[1:04:49] to fall on the floor and they would pour
[1:04:53] water on them and fing with fans though
[1:04:56] like they fainted I have been right in
[1:04:58] their meetings myself in my 50 years I
[1:05:02] have seen them fall under the power of
[1:05:06] the Holy Spirit like that
[1:05:10] amallah and they throw water on their
[1:05:12] face and everything else the old Free
[1:05:14] Methodist many years ago that was
[1:05:16] persecution then after that age lived by
[1:05:18] wesle and came the Pentecostal age with
[1:05:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost see you
[1:05:23] are shaped up all the time so it's not
[1:05:26] just blocks God is laying he is shaping
[1:05:30] he is shaping the ages wide at the
[1:05:32] bottom narrow to the top and God have to
[1:05:36] start to shape you wide at the bottom
[1:05:39] and narrow at the top just as he bring
[1:05:42] the church ages he going to bring you no
[1:05:45] different the church AG is a reflection
[1:05:48] of how God God going to shape you and
[1:05:51] you find out you you are being shaped
[1:05:53] into the word image oh give the Lord
[1:05:55] some Praises as we of times say this
[1:05:58] building you see now as a building that
[1:06:00] you're sitting in was once blocks and
[1:06:03] sand and cement and steel it took labor
[1:06:07] it took building it took paint it took
[1:06:09] everything together to make this
[1:06:10] building that it could be shaped
[1:06:13] material having not is not enough the
[1:06:17] books and tapes have all the material
[1:06:19] but it has to be shaped so there's going
[1:06:22] to be the rise of the stone Mason
[1:06:24] oh give the Lord a shout Give the Lord a
[1:06:27] shout there'll be a fold Ministry
[1:06:30] there'll be such a need for these sons
[1:06:33] of God with the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:06:37] because you you have to be shaped okay
[1:06:39] the Lord I shout you not jumping up and
[1:06:41] going in a Rapture you have to be shaped
[1:06:44] to be fitted in you are Lively stones
[1:06:49] come on now not dead stones not dead
[1:06:52] stones but Lively stones to be shaped
[1:06:57] and
[1:07:00] fitted glory to God hallelujah
[1:07:03] hallelujah so come in the Pentecostal
[1:07:05] age you may be seated with the baptism
[1:07:07] of the Holy Ghost you are shaping up all
[1:07:09] the time now remember the headstone
[1:07:12] wasn't on yet they shaped the church or
[1:07:15] the pyramid in shape to fit The
[1:07:17] Headstone but a headstone never did come
[1:07:20] now the ministry from Luther until the
[1:07:22] end of Pentecost
[1:07:24] minority and that's the reason he says
[1:07:27] the light almost go out in this age he
[1:07:30] said now what because of nicolan
[1:07:32] organized and then he break into this
[1:07:34] year now but the true church this is
[1:07:37] prophecy Hallelujah all over the world
[1:07:41] has shaped down to a place where there
[1:07:44] come a Ministry among
[1:07:47] them prophecy that's exactly like the
[1:07:50] ministry of Jesus Christ Oh Glory to God
[1:07:54] so the ministry of Jesus Christ is
[1:07:56] supposed to be here in The Headstone
[1:07:59] Tabernacle let me say it
[1:08:01] good Hallelujah you hear it direct the
[1:08:05] ministry of Jesus Christ is prophesied

[1:08:24] and what happened next the rejected
[1:08:26] Stone of the pyramid cut out of the
[1:08:29] mountain without hands God sent it do
[1:08:33] you see it now we find out there's a
[1:08:36] quote I wouldn't read it that the
[1:08:38] ministry of Jesus Christ is to catch the
[1:08:44] stone man didn't cut out that stone so

[1:18:53] home in a chair rocking chair and just
[1:18:55] perfect theel by reading spoken books
[1:18:57] and listening to tapes that is a
[1:18:59] deceiving Spirit you know that's a
[1:19:01] religious devil upon them making them
[1:19:03] think that they don't need ministers
[1:19:04] they don't need a fight for Ministry and
[1:19:06] what not they could just chill at home
[1:19:08] they're chilling they're chilling
[1:19:09] straight down to the
[1:19:11] tribulation direct
[1:19:12] line on their way to the tribulation the
[1:19:17] prophet we got more unbelief than ever
[1:19:19] was we Zing to the church now ministers
[1:19:23] organized themselves great denomination
[1:19:26] and they went over to some Seminary like
[1:19:28] an incubator chicken hatch them out and
[1:19:29] a grer bring them out and they know more
[1:19:33] than God than a hot and T does about
[1:19:35] Egyptian
[1:19:36] night what we need in our
[1:19:38] churches is a man that's got an
[1:19:42] absolute what we need in the Methodist
[1:19:44] Church the Baptist Church the
[1:19:45] Pentecostal church the presan church is
[1:19:47] an absolute a man of
[1:19:50] God that will stand tight to the word
[1:19:53] and to Christ here we go are you ready
[1:19:56] and to bring that congregation under
[1:20:00] that condition to where each member
[1:20:03] walks in the condition of this

[1:20:24] in the condition of the word seeing that
[1:20:26] word
[1:20:29] manifested if you know God will not
[1:20:32] manifest what you are slacker while you

[1:23:30] a little atmosphere you have a little
[1:23:32] Spirit to put the seed in he said now
[1:23:35] wait a minute you take the word former
[1:23:38] in Joel
[1:23:39] 2 and the Hebrew word if you want to
[1:23:43] write it down m o u r e h Mor and get
[1:23:47] the Hebrew to interpret that that means
[1:23:48] the teaching reain the denominational
[1:23:51] teaching reain when for for that's right
[1:23:54] the great Pentecostal move they move up
[1:23:55] in millions and the seed has went for
[1:23:58] the word for the minority the groups
[1:24:00] he's talking about you the bride right
[1:24:02] now watch remember Mory is teaching or
[1:24:06] forar rine teaching rain went forth and
[1:24:10] what's the matter now she is now waiting
[1:24:14] for the latter rain and people sometime
[1:24:21] do
[1:24:24] oh praise the Lord is much better okay
[1:24:27] fine so what's the matter now she is
[1:24:29] waiting for the latter rain that is when
[1:24:33] she produce her
[1:24:36] fruits that is when
[1:24:39] what what produce the
[1:24:42] fruits the
[1:24:43] latain is what produce the fruits I hope
[1:24:47] you get her then the kind of seed you
[1:24:50] have planted in your field will be the
[1:24:52] kind of crop you will reap if the
[1:24:54] denomination want more members that's
[1:24:56] what they're going to get that's what
[1:24:58] they have gotten the Pentecost are want
[1:25:00] more Pentecostals that's what they're
[1:25:01] going to get but the word here we go is
[1:25:04] going to
[1:25:06] produce Sons and Daughters of God that
[1:25:10] is coming too I feel confident I feel
[1:25:14] assured that we're going to see Sons and
[1:25:16] Daughters of God not
[1:25:20] humans but at tribute sons of his
[1:25:24] Spirit In other words powered Sons like
[1:25:28] in Genesis 1:26 let a sick man in our
[1:25:31] image in our likeness and let that man
[1:25:33] have dominion then if God restores the
[1:25:36] image and likeness with faith and virtue
[1:25:38] and knowledge and Temperance and
[1:25:40] patience and godness brotherly kindness
[1:25:41] and love that man the power of dominion
[1:25:44] going to be back on the earth and
[1:25:46] brother manam Vindicated it by
[1:25:47] manifesting super Church super Ray signs
[1:25:50] on the earth and said that is for later
[1:25:54] among the sons will be manifested in his
[1:25:57] fullness Oh Glory when that time comes
[1:26:01] all right let's
[1:26:02] go
[1:26:04] watch all right someone asked me to
[1:26:07] repeat the Hebrew word again in Joel 2 2
[1:26:09] chapter so Joel 2 you know uh on the day
[1:26:13] of Pentecost Peter said this is that
[1:26:14] that the prophet Joel spake of okay but
[1:26:17] scripture have twofold meaning Joel 2 is
[1:26:20] also for now
[1:26:25] Give the Lord a shout some ministers
[1:26:27] don't believe that you know they fa jeel
[1:26:29] to is Pentecost and that's it that's
[1:26:30] Joel 2 we have a new thing here no no no
[1:26:32] that Joel 2 is for now let me say it
[1:26:35] again that this Joel 2 is for now he
[1:26:37] said Joel 228 where he speaking of the
[1:26:39] coming of the former latter rain the
[1:26:41] word former is is teaching in other
[1:26:43] words it will be a teaching rain and a
[1:26:45] harvest rain now we have had the
[1:26:48] teaching rain and we are ready now for
[1:26:50] the Harvest rain you know the first
[1:26:52] first rain is when you plant your seed
[1:26:54] to start your crop growing and just
[1:26:56] before it
[1:26:59] matures Hallelujah they call it the
[1:27:02] Harvest rain the spring rain and the
[1:27:05] rain is about June it makes a crop now
[1:27:07] the rain we find out was the
[1:27:09] spirit so the spirit is the rain so it
[1:27:12] can't be word word word word word word
[1:27:14] word no no no no no it has to be Spirit
[1:27:16] also oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:27:19] Hallelujah glory to God now hereen here
[1:27:23] what he say now now we left off and I
[1:27:25] give my thoughts on what the whole thing
[1:27:26] will be I believe that the rain has been
[1:27:29] brought the rain and the reason we are
[1:27:31] quetting down now and people want to
[1:27:34] know what going on in the message like
[1:27:36] if nothing going on like if nothing
[1:27:38] going on Among Us well we still bearing
[1:27:40] the reproach of the word you know some
[1:27:43] people don't know how to bear that the
[1:27:44] reproach because of barness because you
[1:27:47] can't produce anything to show anybody
[1:27:49] but you believe this word and they say
[1:27:51] where it where it where where this well
[1:27:53] keep on hold on you wait tell them seven
[1:27:57] T to that group voices to that group you
[1:27:59] wait all way you want to see you're
[1:28:01] going to see we have faith we have
[1:28:03] patience we waiting all right now here
[1:28:06] the prophet now the reason we are
[1:28:09] quetting down now is because the ground
[1:28:12] is already swn
[1:28:13] over we find there hardly what have been
[1:28:16] sown it went out to radio television
[1:28:19] tapes word everything it SW the country
[1:28:22] down it's planted seeds now what seeds
[1:28:25] was planted you cannot get nothing else
[1:28:26] but what the seeds that was planted you
[1:28:29] understand that now it will be the seeds
[1:28:31] that is planted now the spirit will
[1:28:35] fall give a shout on that
[1:28:38] one I don't care who don't believe that
[1:28:40] you know I believe with all my heart you
[1:28:41] know the spirit will fall and it will
[1:28:45] bring a harvest of the seeds it falls on
[1:28:49] remember that's all right remember out
[1:28:52] of that prophet's mouth he spoke all the
[1:28:54] seeds for the entire
[1:28:55] age even the future home even Los
[1:28:58] Angeles sinking even the war to come
[1:29:01] even all the technology we seeing right
[1:29:03] now he spoke all of that it came out of
[1:29:05] his mouth Judgment of Rome isn't that
[1:29:08] right Judgment of America it came out of
[1:29:11] his mouth but out of his mouth talk
[1:29:13] about a bride I believe the bride is
[1:29:15] called she is sealed to the kingdom she
[1:29:18] is witing the Dynamics to the mechanics
[1:29:20] oh give the so he spoke about you so you
[1:29:23] are in the sea itself so there's an
[1:29:25] anointing hanging over you right now
[1:29:27] tonight to fulfill God's word Oh Glory
[1:29:31] to God
[1:29:32] hallelujah glory to God
[1:29:38] Amen as I say that remember I think it
[1:29:41] was King Ahab when this guys in the
[1:29:44] battle and a man just shoot AR just want
[1:29:46] still kill
[1:29:49] him because he don't want to wear the
[1:29:51] king Rob that know that King you know
[1:29:53] but you see God had to direct that Arrow
[1:29:55] you know a man just feel let to shoot
[1:29:57] that man going
[1:30:00] there he taught that being this guy is a
[1:30:03] normal little thing he go escape but
[1:30:06] when God said judgment is
[1:30:08] Judgment when that hour of God's
[1:30:10] judgment loose you can't stop it you
[1:30:11] know oh glory to God when God Loos that
[1:30:14] no man stop it you know it coming it
[1:30:17] coming it coming H Target when when when
[1:30:20] when when David ran down to meet Goliath
[1:30:22] and loose that stone in the thinging he
[1:30:23] couldn't miss Target you know anyway
[1:30:26] golad head going going duck the stone
[1:30:28] ducking through God directed The Stone
[1:30:31] and this bride you tell me if God could
[1:30:33] direct the stone that David had God
[1:30:35] wouldn't direct the stone a rock a
[1:30:38] revelation God put in our
[1:30:40] hands those go last or finish Oh Glory
[1:30:42] to God there's going to be Revival in
[1:30:45] Trinidad oh give the Lord a shout in the
[1:30:48] house hallelujah hallelujah the same God
[1:30:50] that was with David
[1:30:54] brother Bram he's praying he's praying
[1:30:57] father so it is now at near coming of
[1:31:00] Jesus again just like the vine if the
[1:31:03] vine puts forth a branch and that Branch
[1:31:04] was a Pentecostal Branch filled with the
[1:31:06] Holy Ghost and signs and wanders of
[1:31:08] fruits follow that branch and if that
[1:31:10] vine ever puts another Branch it'll be
[1:31:12] the same kind of Branch we know that
[1:31:14] father by Nature itself and we do know
[1:31:17] that you can graft any fruit that
[1:31:18] pertain to that into the vine it will
[1:31:20] live by the fine and we know that we
[1:31:23] take an orange tree and grow citrus
[1:31:24] fruits of different kinds seven or eight
[1:31:26] put lemons on it go right in because
[1:31:28] it's citrus fruit it will go grapefruit
[1:31:30] many others tangerines many of citrus
[1:31:32] fruits and if that tree brings forth its
[1:31:34] own Branch again it will be orange Lord
[1:31:37] it'll be like the first one was and we
[1:31:40] believe he's still praying that there is
[1:31:42] to be a church in these last days that
[1:31:44] will receive both former and latter rain
[1:31:47] it will be scattered throughout the
[1:31:48] world in this loud years and age it will
[1:31:50] be a church called back to the original
[1:31:52] faith in God it will be a church that
[1:31:54] will have Jesus Christ walking in
[1:31:58] it manifested himself and the shout of
[1:32:02] the king will be in
[1:32:06] it do you want to be part of that
[1:32:09] church Oh Glory to God that's the
[1:32:11] prophecy hanging here this morning there
[1:32:13] will be a church with Jesus walking in
[1:32:15] it Hallelujah and what they're trying to
[1:32:18] do they're trying to this so this
[1:32:20] something else what they're trying to do
[1:32:21] they're try trying to manufacture Lin
[1:32:23] nonsense I'm
[1:32:25] reading he said nonsense why the Lin
[1:32:28] will sweep the world
[1:32:32] brother the ltin wouldn't be a local
[1:32:34] thing will we have a thing and nobody
[1:32:36] else have it that's nonsense somebody
[1:32:38] have a thing that your thing like
[1:32:40] Trinidad thing but the Lin is what is
[1:32:45] prophesied they going to sweep what will
[1:32:48] sweep the world brother being former
[1:32:50] rain sewing words he this brother Kangle
[1:32:52] he said former showing words that's
[1:32:54] right but now you will see what the Lin
[1:32:57] produces you will find out there will be
[1:32:59] affiliation the Pentecostal and all the
[1:33:01] groups will come together and will shut
[1:33:03] the doors on them guys and won't listen
[1:33:04] to it so the latter R produced the the
[1:33:08] the
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:13] Press I challenge the minister s me but
[1:33:16] press here and press here them pressing
[1:33:18] their own self with their
[1:33:20] foolishness the Lin produces the Press
[1:33:24] because the Lin produces an affiliation
[1:33:27] that if you don't belong to them they
[1:33:28] cut you off and he said they going to
[1:33:30] shut down our churches they will have to
[1:33:32] shut it down because Christ will be
[1:33:34] walking in it and the same haters that
[1:33:37] hate Jesus back there his spirits come
[1:33:39] back upon them to hate him again and the
[1:33:42] bride will be rejected the bride will be
[1:33:44] Joseph the prde will become the rejected
[1:33:47] Stone oh give the Lord I shout in the
[1:33:50] house Glory

[1:34:18] will interpret Christ walking among the
[1:34:19] bride all the present play or they not
[1:34:22] play any Prophet meses so how that's why

[1:42:15] house latter rain is fixing to come
[1:42:20] what's the matter still reading same
[1:42:21] quote the church is manufacturing
[1:42:24] herself something just like Eve tried to
[1:42:26] do she tried to give more light to
[1:42:29] manufacture something we have done the
[1:42:32] same thing trying to make something in
[1:42:34] ourselves I'm adopted how dry Jesso no
[1:42:40] voice no witness no father saying this
[1:42:41] is my son to you in whom I'm pleased
[1:42:43] dwelling hear him you do you m hear
[1:42:45] me because if say nothing are you still
[1:42:49] waiting yes sir father to talk to me too
[1:42:51] you

[1:42:58] Revelation them thing is lying Spirits
[1:43:00] enticing Spirits oh God will tell you
[1:43:02] that and God didn't tell me and go and
[1:43:03] talk to
[1:43:04] me and I still striving because I get
[1:43:07] upset sometimes I get angry sometimes so
[1:43:11] I know Temperance is vulcanized yet I
[1:43:14] know I need vulcanization of all them
[1:43:15] things I need you go tell me what going
[1:43:18] on inside of me you know what inside my
[1:43:21] heart you know the battles and devils
[1:43:23] are had to

[1:43:28] strange things you fighting the same
[1:43:30] devil too oh give the Lord I shout in
[1:43:33] the house don't open the pastor the
[1:43:36] pastor yes the pastor oh give the Lord a
[1:43:39] shout I to fight for my life like
[1:43:41] everybody else oh give the Lord a shout
[1:43:44] in the
[1:43:46] house don't watch this here
[1:43:49] now
[1:43:52] what's the matter the church is trying
[1:43:53] to manifest herself something just like
[1:43:56] Eve tried to do she tried to have more
[1:43:57] light we have done the same thing trying
[1:43:59] to make ourselves something in ourselves
[1:44:01] keep listen to this word brother George
[1:44:03] keep your hand off of it let God do it
[1:44:08] take his word and believe it hold it in
[1:44:10] your heart and when the rain begins to
[1:44:14] fall life will take whole and the word
[1:44:18] will manifest itself
[1:44:23] I can't say it better than
[1:44:25] that that's why quoting CL I can't I
[1:44:28] can't I can't deify that I know that's
[1:44:31] not a word I know that's not a word
[1:44:33] deify that's the first time I hear now
[1:44:36] note that one I
[1:44:37] Dey I can't make that deeper you know
[1:44:40] when the rain not if begins to fall life
[1:44:44] will take a ho and the word will
[1:44:47] manifest
[1:44:48] itself now Adam Bri could not with here
[1:44:52] this deep Revelation this is a deep one
[1:44:53] here now God told Adam and Eve multiply
[1:44:56] and replenish the Earth it was an
[1:44:59] uncommenting A
[1:45:01] Promise she was not his wife as yet
[1:45:05] because he had never lived with her so
[1:45:07] they were supposed to wait for a further
[1:45:09] Revelation as to how to
[1:45:14] multiply do you understand that God said
[1:45:17] multiply replenish but they're supposed
[1:45:19] to wait
[1:45:21] the further Revelation was going to be
[1:45:22] Adam was supposed to speak the word and
[1:45:25] Eve conceived by Spoken Word but because
[1:45:27] they didn't wait serpent come in it fell
[1:45:30] down into sex that's how we end up born
[1:45:32] in sin and shape iniquity so that's why
[1:45:34] the First Gospel Jesus preachers you
[1:45:36] must be born again of the word and
[1:45:38] spirit so you're bringing you right back
[1:45:40] to what it had in the Garden of Eden
[1:45:42] because originally we supposed to be
[1:45:43] born of the word Adam's son was to be a
[1:45:46] spoken word son because Adam had the
[1:45:48] title lead of the earth and he that
[1:45:50] spoken word he could have said tree move
[1:45:52] here mountain move here Adam was in
[1:45:54] charge of the earth oh give the Lord a
[1:45:57] shout but Fallen that Fallen man it's a
[1:46:01] different girl
[1:46:02] together all right the bride of Christ
[1:46:05] is not his wife
[1:46:07] yet all this phrase I I am the bride and
[1:46:09] I bride and what not that just train
[1:46:11] that talk that just talk ignore that
[1:46:13] talk I see not bright until he hit
[1:46:16] charity there's the connection there's
[1:46:18] the bond of perfectness that's seal all
[1:46:20] the bires in so in other words charity
[1:46:23] is rest Hebrews 4 labor to enter into
[1:46:26] the rest how you laboring with faith and
[1:46:29] virtue and knowledge you're laboring
[1:46:31] you're laboring you're laboring you're
[1:46:32] pushing you're pushing to get where into
[1:46:34] the rest charity is the rest that love
[1:46:38] that comes over the prophet he said I
[1:46:39] wish it happened I wish it happened all
[1:46:41] the time Hallelujah I wish it happened
[1:46:43] all the time something came he said
[1:46:44] something came over me Hallelujah the
[1:46:46] man chatting him and say you snake in
[1:46:48] the grass you hypocrite come platform he
[1:46:50] said come the devil he said love come
[1:46:52] over him he felt sorry for the man the
[1:46:54] man may be a half wife and children but
[1:46:56] the devil upon him oh give the Lord some
[1:46:59] Praises we have to have that love we
[1:47:02] can't be clanging sword and carrying one
[1:47:03] another we we have to have Love Oh Glory
[1:47:06] the bull coming you know the killer bull
[1:47:08] oh praise God and you have to be able to
[1:47:10] speak the bull language and the bull
[1:47:12] only understand the language of love
[1:47:13] isn't that right all right here we go
[1:47:15] now so she got in a hurry and she bought
[1:47:17] up with the child all right Hallelujah
[1:47:20] that's what Christ found Adam found his
[1:47:21] wife full of seed what disgrace that's
[1:47:24] what Adam found that's what Christ found
[1:47:27] couldn't wait and that's what the matter
[1:47:28] with the people today here we go brother
[1:47:30] George they can't wait for the real Holy
[1:47:35] Spirit to take the church in
[1:47:40] position last message I preach get ready
[1:47:42] you're about to be position on pleas
[1:47:45] what does that mean the real Holy Spirit
[1:47:47] coming to take the church in position
[1:47:50] they can't wait they have to manufacture
[1:47:52] something work up something initi
[1:47:55] evidence speaking in tongues to get more
[1:47:57] members in church got to woke up
[1:48:00] something I'm patri 4 I'm adopted
[1:48:03] potentially
[1:48:05] adopted somebody said that kind of mini
[1:48:08] adoption like mini Donuts
[1:48:13] something so Jehovah bride went to
[1:48:15] horing what did she do she brought forth
[1:48:18] a bunch of
[1:48:19] illegitimate again Christ bright done
[1:48:22] the same what's the matter can't wait
[1:48:24] they just can't wait he said they had to
[1:48:27] manufacture something they can't wait
[1:48:29] for the Holy Spirit to come and get into
[1:48:31] the church they have to get more in
[1:48:34] denomination so in other words the
[1:48:36] message not good enough we had to preach
[1:48:37] crazy stuff
[1:48:39] now and Satan have a bucket you know a
[1:48:41] deep he have lower levels you know and
[1:48:43] when he to spit out the reolution so
[1:48:44] many they snatching it
[1:48:48] up this white Horseman some
[1:48:50] and and something a newspaper mean
[1:48:52] something and and and the comment com in
[1:48:54] and that means something and that mean
[1:48:56] nothing you know and then and then could
[1:48:58] it be could it be that when Saturn Lin

[1:49:07] Hallelujah
[1:49:08] Hallelujah Saturn up for Jupiter and we
[1:49:11] are here here
[1:49:14] where man take a donkey ride and talk
[1:49:16] about Jesus right in Jerusalem Jesus
[1:49:20] that's Jesus right in Jerusalem you and
[1:49:22] your white donkey or White
[1:49:26] Horse brother Bram they can't wait for
[1:49:29] the Holy Spirit to come and get into the
[1:49:31] church see they have to get more in
[1:49:33] their denomination if it had stayed the
[1:49:35] way it was back Yonder a 100 years ago
[1:49:38] or 50 years ago when Pentecost first
[1:49:40] started in this Latter day when the word
[1:49:42] begin to be preached if it had stay that
[1:49:44] way here we go you ready she probably
[1:49:47] wouldn't have over 50 members
[1:49:49] today but they would be Blood Washed
[1:49:52] they would have the power of God in them
[1:49:54] and the world would be shaken under her
[1:49:57] tremendous impact of the word flesh
[1:49:59] being spoken word by
[1:50:02] word 50 people line up with the word
[1:50:06] rocking the world and shaking the world
[1:50:08] the world have to get a shaken we not
[1:50:10] leaving here
[1:50:13] quietly it won't be a public show that
[1:50:16] right take that the bride will not leave
[1:50:18] here quietly we going to make a lot of
[1:50:20] noise before we leave you here oh glory
[1:50:23] to God God will let them Devils know who
[1:50:26] we are where we come from and they can't
[1:50:29] go where we are going oh glory to God
[1:50:32] I'm excited
[1:50:33] tonight oh glory to God hallelujah
[1:50:37] hallelujah my God today is song named
[1:50:40] brass and tingling symbol just become
[1:50:43] nonsense a laughing stuck a disgrace to
[1:50:45] the world he said what's the matter with
[1:50:48] the Pentecost of today they are man
[1:50:50] facturing something they can't wait oh
[1:50:51] God he said oh God they just can't wait
[1:50:54] so they commit
[1:50:55] adultery to manufacture something what
[1:50:57] does it bring forth like the first B
[1:50:59] couldn't wait she brought debt a bastard
[1:51:01] born child we are all children but God
[1:51:04] Came In the Flesh to give us another
[1:51:06] birth to bring us back to the original
[1:51:08] Sons and Daughters of God the LIF sperm
[1:51:10] of Eve never happened it never did
[1:51:13] because she mingled it instead of Adam
[1:51:15] coming to for bride when the time
[1:51:17] appointed would be Hallelujah just like
[1:51:20] Christ's will would have to come to the
[1:51:21] group Christ would have to come to his
[1:51:25] church he promised to do it we don't
[1:51:28] have to manufacture nothing we have to
[1:51:31] be on expectation and plead the
[1:51:34] promises God promised to multiply them
[1:51:36] but they had to wait until God's time
[1:51:39] and that's what the matter today they
[1:51:41] don't want to wait God's time they want
[1:51:45] to get something else so the devil has
[1:51:48] got the wisdom right there to give it to
[1:51:50] them to make an organization bigger than
[1:51:53] the rest of them so when you have a
[1:51:55] taste of mysteries that the pastor and
[1:51:57] preacher there to teach that and reveal
[1:51:58] that three four hours uning and
[1:52:00] afterward you Shak and said never man oh
[1:52:02] God never sees on F
[1:52:04] so and your same condition silly women
[1:52:08] Laden with diverse lust ever learning
[1:52:11] never come to the knowledge of the truth
[1:52:13] heaping unto themselves teachers
[1:52:15] having itch and
[1:52:18] ears woo Hallelujah couldn't wait so the
[1:52:22] sperm of Eve never happen hybrid of
[1:52:24] Satan lies his his lovely bride become
[1:52:27] polluted and so as Christ's bride the
[1:52:29] bride what made her polluted because she
[1:52:33] never stayed with the word now the
[1:52:36] reason that Adam bride there's three
[1:52:39] Adam Christ and God and he said this now
[1:52:41] the reason that Adam bride never did
[1:52:43] Bear right the life child is because she
[1:52:46] disbelieved God's word and the Coran Say
[1:52:49] Amen the reason that Jehovah wife was
[1:52:51] put away his bride because she rejected
[1:52:54] God's word the prophets and the reason
[1:52:56] that Christ's bride is put away in
[1:52:57] divorcement is because she has rejected
[1:52:59] the word of God just like Eve did Christ
[1:53:03] Pentecostal brigh did the same thing she
[1:53:05] can't bring forth spiritual word
[1:53:07] children for she's a hybrid herself so
[1:53:11] once they hybrid once they come with a
[1:53:13] wrong Doctrine and walk teaching and
[1:53:14] whatnot they come hybrid Death
[1:53:17] setting Church might grow you know but
[1:53:19] death is there because the bride is the
[1:53:21] original word she becomes a virgin to
[1:53:24] the word that's what make you a virgin
[1:53:26] you know when you're staying with the
[1:53:28] word no man interpretation an idea a man
[1:53:31] can come and tell you you are the Holy
[1:53:32] Ghost you know he's a liar talking no a
[1:53:34] misrepresentation of the truth
[1:53:37] talking all right so the true bride
[1:53:39] there's going to be one she is
[1:53:41] predestinated she won't be denominated
[1:53:44] because she is predestinated are you
[1:53:46] ready now here we go when Christ come to
[1:53:48] his bride she she's he's coming he's
[1:53:51] coming as a husband he's coming when
[1:53:53] Christ come to his bride she will be a
[1:53:55] virgin like Mary was for God will not
[1:53:59] bring Christ through the womb of a
[1:54:04] say amen amen neither will he
[1:54:07] bring the bride he can't bring his word
[1:54:10] through AO of his word them is horrible
[1:54:12] words but that's what the Bible
[1:54:14] says hallelujah praise God be in home
[1:54:17] Church the last day the TRU B will come
[1:54:20] pick up a pen and write God told him
[1:54:22] this super Church super race as she near
[1:54:24] The Headstone all right let's skip it he
[1:54:26] says now what he says the they will be
[1:54:29] so much like him that they'll be in his
[1:54:31] very image in order to be United with
[1:54:33] him there will be one there will be the
[1:54:35] very manifestation of the word of the
[1:54:36] Living God theom can never produce this
[1:54:39] they produce their Creeds and dogmas
[1:54:40] mixed with the word and being the hybrid
[1:54:42] product the first son was spoken see the
[1:54:44] word of God he was given a bride he said
[1:54:46] now watch to produce himself that's
[1:54:48] object the bride is to reproduce himself
[1:54:51] you get that so Christ want to reproduce
[1:54:54] himself in a bride a bride is to bring
[1:54:57] reproduction to reproduce so Christ had
[1:54:59] to be unveiled through us all right she
[1:55:02] fell by high breeding but listen to how
[1:55:03] I want to get to from a little group of
[1:55:05] the true seed of the word god represent
[1:55:07] Christ a beloved bride not the whole
[1:55:09] group from the group of the true seed of
[1:55:13] the word right in the Mage Oran and
[1:55:15] seeds but they have a true seed of the
[1:55:16] word out of that true seed of the word a
[1:55:18] group coming out of that
[1:55:20] oh praise God watch and she will be a
[1:55:22] virgin a virgin of his word amen notice
[1:55:25] what Harmony I going to skip that they
[1:55:27] only do his will no one can persuade
[1:55:29] them to do half different they have thus
[1:55:31] say the Lord or the keep skill all right
[1:55:34] so let's kind of wrap up here now what
[1:55:37] is horning we talk about horning all
[1:55:39] right we talk about horn down to be fit
[1:55:42] into the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:55:43] horning can be referred to at different
[1:55:45] things depend upon the context so we
[1:55:47] have horning as a sharpening process
[1:55:50] honing is a method of sharpening blades
[1:55:52] or edges typically using a honing stone
[1:55:55] or honing machine it involves removal a
[1:55:57] small amount of materials from the
[1:55:59] surface to create a Sharper Edge honing
[1:56:01] is commonly used for tools such as
[1:56:03] knives razors chisels and scissors
[1:56:06] horning is also for skill development
[1:56:09] horning can also refer to the process of
[1:56:11] refining or improving a skill or ability
[1:56:14] it implies The Continuous practice and
[1:56:16] refinement of a particular skill to
[1:56:19] achieve Mastery so here somebody say I'm
[1:56:21] honing my skills for example a musician
[1:56:24] might say they are honing their guitter
[1:56:26] skills or a writer might be honing their
[1:56:27] storytelling abilities horning can be
[1:56:30] used to describe the process of
[1:56:32] fine-tuning or perfecting something it
[1:56:35] often implies making small adjustments
[1:56:37] or improvements to achieve the Desir
[1:56:40] outcome for example a speaker might horn
[1:56:43] their presentation by rehearsing and
[1:56:45] making minor adjustment to their
[1:56:47] delivery or content overell overall
[1:56:50] horning involves the process of refining
[1:56:52] sharpening and so like that right now
[1:56:54] there's the part I want to get to here
[1:56:55] in metal working horing is a machining
[1:56:59] process used to improve the geometric
[1:57:01] form and surface finish of cylindrical
[1:57:04] surface usually inside a diameter or a
[1:57:07] cylinder the primary purpose of honing
[1:57:10] is to achieve a precise size smooth
[1:57:14] surface finish and improve roundness on
[1:57:17] the internal surfaces of parts this
[1:57:19] process is often employed in the
[1:57:21] production of components such as engine
[1:57:23] cylinders hydraulic cylinders other
[1:57:25] Precision components they are tight
[1:57:27] tolerances and excellent surface
[1:57:29] finishes are
[1:57:30] crucial oh praise the name of the
[1:57:33] Lord like any metal work process honing
[1:57:36] relies on a systemized approach of
[1:57:39] components working in concert to deliver
[1:57:41] Optimum results horing oil is one of
[1:57:44] these critical components now I did a
[1:57:46] bit a bit of metal thing in in in a
[1:57:48] school and had a a long machine and if
[1:57:50] you have to get it to a point have
[1:57:52] something spinning around and you have a
[1:57:53] caliper and you would measure the the
[1:57:56] thing of it and then you have a oil
[1:57:58] because it's it's a lot of pressure
[1:57:59] going on spinning spinning and easing
[1:58:01] out this thing fine fine tolerances and
[1:58:04] you have to measure the caliper I don't
[1:58:06] know what if I saying it right but
[1:58:07] that's you use but you have to have oil
[1:58:10] there oh glory to you have to have Holy
[1:58:12] Ghost there got to get the spirit there
[1:58:15] to do the holding here you can't really
[1:58:17] cut that metal without oil is a lot of
[1:58:19] Heat going in and the oil will be
[1:58:21] pouring over onto this thing that's
[1:58:23] spinning and thing like that Hallelujah
[1:58:25] the success of honing Des spends upon
[1:58:28] precise performance in each of five key
[1:58:30] components of the honing system the
[1:58:32] machine fixturing tooling abrasive
[1:58:35] honing oil even through the honing oil
[1:58:37] accounts for around 1% of total process
[1:58:39] cost selecting the right honing oil has
[1:58:41] a direct and immediate impact and so on
[1:58:43] when the whole in oil is left out of the
[1:58:45] equation it will definitely lead to
[1:58:46] reduced production increased cost and so
[1:58:48] on all right let's go that's enough
[1:58:51] technical talk about honing just just to
[1:58:54] get an idea of the word because we had
[1:58:56] to come to that pyramid notice how the
[1:58:58] pyramid is coming a funnel it's being
[1:59:00] honed down somebody had a vision years
[1:59:02] ago of people climbed the pyramid and it
[1:59:03] was falling off him because you see
[1:59:05] afterwards they get more steep so people
[1:59:07] climb and climb instead of fall off
[1:59:08] pyramid some a few was climbing higher
[1:59:11] and higher all right the people who died
[1:59:14] in here are depending and waiting on us
[1:59:17] so this church has got to come to
[1:59:19] perfection in order to bring the
[1:59:21] resurrection and this church you see is
[1:59:24] coming smaller in minority but the BR
[1:59:26] referred to the chalkboard it is a whole
[1:59:28] lot sharper it come to a needle point
[1:59:31] until the church in the minority has got
[1:59:34] to get into a place until the same kind
[1:59:37] of ministry that this left because when
[1:59:39] this headstone come back he says and
[1:59:42] when it
[1:59:43] comes this headstone this church has got
[1:59:47] to be
[1:59:48] horned
[1:59:52] or you mean that commun going back home
[1:59:55] no you had to be
[1:59:58] hored in other words you have to be
[2:00:00] shaped in fine Precision to fit into
[2:00:04] this Holy Spirit
[2:00:07] there's a for you that nobody
[2:00:09] else could take your
[2:00:13] place but you a pushing yourself into
[2:00:15] the place you know you got to be cut to
[2:00:18] fit notice how sharp the pyramid is Fai
[2:00:22] shaped virtue shaped you can't take
[2:00:26] patience and put it on top of fith it
[2:00:27] wouldn't line
[2:00:32] up watch this all the rest of the stones
[2:00:35] in the pyramid are laying so perfect
[2:00:39] here we go that you can't run a razor
[2:00:41] blade between them and they weighing
[2:00:44] tons they don't know how to get them up
[2:00:46] there they don't know how they were
[2:00:47] built up here amen when the permit cap
[2:00:51] does comeall the permit
[2:00:54] itself the body of Christ will have to
[2:00:58] be
[2:01:03] honed not just some Creed or doctrine or
[2:01:06] something or the other we come true it
[2:01:08] will have to be so perfectly like Christ
[2:01:11] till when he comes he and that ministry
[2:01:15] will WR smack together then will come
[2:01:18] the rapt
[2:01:20] I will say this way not
[2:01:23] before so the church have to be hor and
[2:01:27] the ministry have to be
[2:01:30] hor I ask some more things to get to you
[2:01:32] you know because when the ministry is
[2:01:35] hor then you could be
[2:01:39] honed because the ministry is what H the
[2:01:46] bride oh give the Lord a shout in the
[2:01:48] house
[2:01:49] and we read at Ephesians 11 for the
[2:01:51] perfecting of the Saints or for the
[2:01:53] holding of the Saints for the work of
[2:01:56] the ministry for the edifying of the
[2:01:59] body all right we in home stretch but
[2:02:04] BR why wasn't the Capstone put in it the
[2:02:06] headstone the top of it because I was
[2:02:09] rejected rejected Stone here we go right
[2:02:12] with me STI with me then those stones
[2:02:16] talking about you and I that fit around
[2:02:18] the head
[2:02:21] stone will have to be stones that will
[2:02:24] be so completely like that
[2:02:27] stone so there are Stones Around The
[2:02:30] Headstone notice you are not in
[2:02:33] ludia you been called out out
[2:02:36] ofia into the bride age the Holy Spirit
[2:02:39] you are going to be the stones
[2:02:42] around the
[2:02:47] Headstones that's the way God is
[2:02:50] bringing his church we are fitly joined
[2:02:52] together one at one Accord let me
[2:02:55] go skip notice the coming of the Lord
[2:02:59] Jesus is so close at hand until the
[2:03:01] spirit from way down here beely
[2:03:02] justification sanctification B Holy
[2:03:04] Ghost right onto the coming of The
[2:03:05] Headstone the church has to be so
[2:03:08] perfectly like Christ you see the
[2:03:09] emphasis over and over until Christ and
[2:03:12] the church can unite together the same
[2:03:14] spirit and if the spirit of Christ is in
[2:03:16] you it makes you live the life of Christ
[2:03:17] act the Life of Christ do the works of
[2:03:19] Christ we got a Ministry coming prophecy
[2:03:23] that's exactly like the Life of Christ
[2:03:26] that is not brother over's Ministry we
[2:03:28] have a Ministry coming that's a new
[2:03:31] ministry Give the Lord some
[2:03:33] Praises that's exactly like the Life of
[2:03:36] Christ what does that Ministry identify
[2:03:40] the coming of the Lord with his shout
[2:03:42] voice and Trump so that Ministry was
[2:03:44] identifi first Thessalonian 4 16 all
[2:03:48] right we be going on very good
[2:03:51] Hallelujah prophesy son of man can these
[2:03:52] bones live four stages to bring forth
[2:03:56] the church I'll restore sayith the Lord
[2:03:59] he said justification brought back the
[2:04:00] pulp sanctification brought back the
[2:04:02] back doctrine of Holiness what brought
[2:04:04] back the leave Pentecostal clapping and
[2:04:06] rejoicing what was the thought for was
[2:04:08] the word and the word made flesh fruits
[2:04:11] of the proof of the Resurrection that
[2:04:14] Christ has finally after justification
[2:04:15] be planted Sanic be planted baptism Holy
[2:04:19] Ghost organization died out Christ has
[2:04:21] again seted himself like the cap of the
[2:04:22] pyramid the bapt Holy Ghost then they
[2:04:24] come of the cap what is it this part I
[2:04:27] want to get to now that Holy Ghost
[2:04:30] Bunch being honed out so that it can fit
[2:04:36] with the same kind of ministry he had
[2:04:39] when he went away and when he comes back
[2:04:42] it will catch the whole thing in the
[2:04:44] Rapture so this is not a
[2:04:46] gimmick glory to God
[2:04:49] Hal there's an
[2:04:50] intelligence to unfold this whole
[2:04:52] Rapture thing the Rapture truly is a
[2:04:56] revelation Oh Glory this is not a
[2:04:58] Pentecostal church this is not a
[2:05:00] Pentecostal church we come to church
[2:05:01] we're going in Rapture no no no no we're
[2:05:02] not a Pentecostal Church he's saying how
[2:05:04] it's going to be Christ going to be in
[2:05:06] our midst you got to be perfectly like
[2:05:09] Christ you got to be hone to fit in oh
[2:05:12] then the Rapture going to come oh glory
[2:05:15] to God hallelujah hallelujah so that's
[2:05:19] why you must enter into your place of
[2:05:20] trying where the word could be honed in
[2:05:23] you isn't that right where you could be
[2:05:25] formed into the word image so we cannot
[2:05:28] begin to shun our trials and ask God to
[2:05:29] take us out why not ask God to take it
[2:05:34] through all right and this is where I
[2:05:36] get the title from almost finished but
[2:05:38] Brandon he's
[2:05:39] praying okay going

[2:06:03] appearing before the coming and there's
[2:06:05] a great difference in the word appearing
[2:06:07] and then coming now father we realize
[2:06:10] that the church has come through the
[2:06:12] stage of justification come to the stage
[2:06:14] of sanctification come to the stage of
[2:06:17] receiving the Holy Ghost now here we go
[2:06:20] and I get title from the stones are
[2:06:23] being honed down for the fitting of the
[2:06:26] ministry of Jesus

[2:07:26] the same thing and you know when you
[2:07:28] find an egg when you bust some eggs and
[2:07:30] so on you have to whisk it you have to
[2:07:34] blend it if you don't blend it it just
[2:07:36] wouldn't come out right and that's what
[2:07:38] God have to do take us
[2:07:39] on whip us up a little bit blend you in
[2:07:43] all right here we go final
[2:07:45] quotes what good would be Stones be if
[2:07:47] you pile them up
[2:07:49] let them lay there it might be better
[2:07:51] out there than pile them up together
[2:07:54] they won be they won't be they might be
[2:07:56] needed out
[2:07:57] de that's right stone is no good without
[2:07:59] a stone Mason no no no
[2:08:03] sorry okay I'm no I miss sorry I miss
[2:08:06] miss part of the quote what good is
[2:08:09] Stones if you haven't got a stone Mason
[2:08:12] to shape them
[2:08:13] out confession is Stones when Peter made
[2:08:17] his confession Jesus said Peter a little
[2:08:19] Stone but what good is a stone if there
[2:08:21] isn't a stone Mason there to shape him
[2:08:23] into a Son of God plain books and tape
[2:08:26] that can't do it it need a stone Mason
[2:08:30] the tapes is the material you are Sons
[2:08:34] it take a stone meon to shape you into a
[2:08:37] Son of God that is where a fivefold come
[2:08:41] for the Min work of the ministry the
[2:08:43] ministry of Jesus Christ is not man's
[2:08:45] Ministry it's Jesus ministry here we go
[2:08:48] what good is a stone if there isn't a
[2:08:50] stone Mason there to shape him into the
[2:08:52] Son of God you are just piling up rocks
[2:08:55] it isn't going to Bitter good the water
[2:08:58] wear it away the stone so people sit
[2:09:00] down as Stone they had taken the word
[2:09:02] they had the old interpretation they had
[2:09:03] a dream last night and they preaching
[2:09:05] word and only water is wearing them and
[2:09:07] them getting we too the water wear it
[2:09:12] the stone that's
[2:09:14] right all right what good is Stones if
[2:09:17] you got a stone a good sharp
[2:09:20] tool to shape him into The Fitting Place
[2:09:23] in the house of God just want to ask you
[2:09:26] what good decisions what good you're
[2:09:27] putting up your name in the book what
[2:09:29] good you come to join the church if the
[2:09:30] stone Miss isn't dear that will shape
[2:09:33] that and make them quit this and that
[2:09:34] and cut them and make them over this way
[2:09:37] and square them up and make them like
[2:09:39] Christians that set in the house of God
[2:09:41] with signs following the
[2:09:44] Believers then brother Anthony prophesy
[2:09:47] that end time evangelism is taking the
[2:09:49] stones and shaping
[2:09:55] them so it's not just us coming together
[2:09:58] it's you coming to be shaped that's
[2:10:00] right the ministry had to be shaped to
[2:10:03] fit the ministry of Jesus Christ but
[2:10:05] then you as Believers have to be shaped
[2:10:08] into a perfect man so you're going to be
[2:10:10] honed into the stature of a perfect man
[2:10:14] could we give the Lord a shout in the
[2:10:16] house Hallelujah
[2:10:19] what what good would the stones be if we
[2:10:21] just pile them up let them lay where
[2:10:23] they at Hallelujah he said what Jesus
[2:10:26] concer us not members he concer us God
[2:10:29] has always tried to get one man in his
[2:10:31] hand that's all he needs he's one man
[2:10:33] and he will do his work through the
[2:10:34] years just think if you can only find
[2:10:36] one righteous man in time of Noah time
[2:10:38] of Mo look at Samson see God can only
[2:10:41] use what you surrender to him Samson was
[2:10:43] a big strong man he had lost of strength
[2:10:45] Samson surrendered his strength to God
[2:10:47] but he would didn't give his heart he
[2:10:49] gave his heart to the they could
[2:10:52] something and that's what the matter
[2:10:54] with the people today brother they'll
[2:10:56] reach down and pay off debts and things
[2:10:59] like that and build bigger denomination
[2:11:00] and so forth like that when it comes to
[2:11:03] giving the heart they won't do it let's
[2:11:05] stand and let's praise
[2:11:10] [Music]
