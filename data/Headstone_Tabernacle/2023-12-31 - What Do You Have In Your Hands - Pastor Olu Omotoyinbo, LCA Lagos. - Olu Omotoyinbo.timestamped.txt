[35:14] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen
[35:18] God bless you God bless you may be
[35:23] seated
[35:25] um we have got a few announcements here
[35:28] so let's turn and um take care of them
[35:47] first I'm I'm going to be reading from
[35:50] Joshua 5: 1- 12 Ecclesiastes 9: 10 and
[35:55] 11 Ephesians 42 28 and 1
[35:58] Peter 1 and verse
[36:01] 7 um Joshua 5 and verse 1 through verse
[36:05] 12 read and this wise and it came to
[36:08] pass when all this was this was when
[36:11] Israel had come into the promised land
[36:14] and um the um um the Mana this is the
[36:20] junction the story line around when the
[36:23] Mana
[36:24] ceased and it came to pass when all the
[36:26] Kings of the amorites which were on the
[36:28] side of Jordan Westward and all the
[36:30] kings of the Canaanites which were by
[36:32] the Sea how that the Lord had dried up
[36:35] the Waters of Jordan from before the
[36:36] children of Israel until you were passed
[36:39] over that their heart melted neither was
[36:42] their spirit in them anymore because of
[36:45] the children of
[36:46] Israel now Spirit seen the B they were
[36:48] afraid but
[36:49] notice whether to be able to do you need
[36:53] the spirit you need Spirit whatever your
[36:56] spirit is got to be alive to do anything
[36:58] your spirit is not there you are you're
[37:01] done and especially for us as if God's
[37:04] spirit is not there we're done and
[37:06] that's why Jesus said without me you can
[37:08] do nothing it's not the word alone but
[37:10] the spirit coming upon the world that's
[37:12] what makes the word come alive that's
[37:15] what make the word come come alive yeah
[37:17] all right so there's uh um the spirit um
[37:22] um what was I neither was there speaking
[37:24] them anymore because of the children of
[37:25] Israel um verse two at that time the
[37:28] Lord said unto Joshua make the sh knives
[37:31] and circumcise again the children of
[37:33] Israel the second time they circumcised
[37:36] them when they came out of Egypt but all
[37:40] these young folks who were born in the
[37:42] wilderness had not been circumcised and
[37:44] that's why going into the promised land
[37:47] they will be
[37:49] circumcised that's the baptism of the
[37:51] Holy Ghost without that you you are not
[37:54] going to really Thrive as a Christian
[37:56] you'll survive
[37:57] you're hanging there but you are not
[37:58] going to thrive and God wants us to
[38:00] thrive and have Abundant
[38:03] Living and that's what the baptism of
[38:05] the Holy Ghost
[38:06] represents and the baptism of the Holy
[38:08] Ghost is available for you to get right
[38:12] now as you are standing on your feet
[38:15] amen but of course if you don't
[38:17] recognize your need for the Holy Spirit
[38:20] baptism you're not going to be really
[38:21] hungry but Jesus said they that hunger
[38:24] and thirst that the ones that going to
[38:27] be filled amen all
[38:31] right verse
[38:33] four and verse three and Joshua made him
[38:35] sh knives and circumcised the children
[38:37] of Israel at the heel of the First Kings
[38:40] and this is the cause why Joshua did
[38:42] circumcised all the people that came out
[38:44] of Egypt that were males even all the
[38:47] men of War died in the wilderness by the
[38:49] way after they came out of Egypt now all
[38:52] the people that came out were
[38:53] circumcised but all the people that were
[38:55] born in the world Wilderness by the way
[38:58] as they came forth out of Egypt them
[39:00] they had not circumcised in other words
[39:03] they had not had their own experience
[39:05] with the Lord there had been children
[39:08] born in the home where God was talk
[39:13] about but the Jews were very good at
[39:16] making their religion a part and parcel
[39:18] of their lives and affects everything
[39:20] that they do the natural lives the
[39:22] school life the business life the career
[39:25] everything the Jews were Masters ated
[39:28] and that's why they they're little a
[39:30] little different even if they are these
[39:32] ungodly Jews whatever you want to call
[39:34] them but because they have that culture
[39:38] in them in the nation among the tribe
[39:42] wherever they on the face of the world
[39:45] the Jews have mastered the art of making
[39:48] their religion a part of their lives not
[39:49] a Sunday Sunday thing like many
[39:51] Christians do and then they get during
[39:53] the week they live like unbelievers and
[39:55] then come to church the boys live like
[39:56] the girls in school and the all the
[39:59] filthiness and even on the job adults
[40:01] mothers fathers mothers do all the
[40:04] fighting during the week and all that
[40:05] stuff not Jews they learn to make their
[40:09] religion a parent pass of their Liv so
[40:10] their children grew up saying the
[40:12] religion being their life it was their
[40:16] lifestyle
[40:19] amen verse six for for the children of
[40:23] Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness
[40:25] did all the people people that were Men
[40:27] of War which came out of Egypt was
[40:29] consumed because they obeyed not the
[40:31] voice of the Lord unto whom the Lord
[40:34] swear that he will not show them the
[40:36] land which the Lord swear un to their
[40:38] fathers that he will give us a land that
[40:40] flow with milk and honey and the
[40:43] children whom he raised up in their
[40:44] state them Joshua circumcised for they
[40:47] were uncircumcised because they are not
[40:49] circumcised them by the way and it came
[40:52] to pass when they had done circumcised
[40:55] when they had done circumcised in all
[40:56] the people that they abod in their
[40:59] places in the camp till they were whole
[41:00] they were
[41:02] healed and the Lord said unto Joshua
[41:04] this day have I rolled away the reproach
[41:08] of Egypt from off of you that's what the
[41:11] holy spirit is going to do when he comes
[41:13] in he there to roll away the re all your
[41:16] weaknesses all your C do and even for
[41:20] your do you have any reproach today any
[41:23] reproach at all let the holy spirit let
[41:26] Holy Spirit over over it and watch him
[41:29] roll watch him begin from this hour to
[41:33] roll away your reproach that's his job
[41:38] that's his tough that's his specialty to
[41:41] roll away the
[41:44] reproach
[41:46] amen
[41:51] hallelujah and the Lord said unto
[41:53] Joshua this day have I rolled away the
[41:57] reproach of Egypt from off of you
[41:58] wherefore the name of the place is
[42:00] called gilgal onto this day and gilgal
[42:04] in the Bible was Israel's based Camp
[42:06] they did everything from that spot where
[42:09] the Holy Spirit met them the generation
[42:12] in the promised land amen the son of man
[42:16] amen the new
[42:18] land and the children of Israel verse 10
[42:21] encamped in gilgal and kept the Passover
[42:23] on the 14th day of the month at Eve in
[42:26] the plains of Jericho and they did eat
[42:29] of the old corn of the land on the
[42:32] tomorrow after they pass over the go in
[42:35] the land at the Passover circumcised
[42:38] them at the Passover once they at the
[42:40] Passover the man is
[42:43] ceased neither have the children of
[42:45] Israel neither have the children of
[42:47] Israel manner anymore but they he eat of
[42:50] the fruit of the land of Canaan that
[42:54] year amen may the Lord add his Blessing
[42:57] to the reading of his holy words amen
[43:00] you may be seated let's continue reading
[43:02] um ecclesias 6 9 vers 10 to 11 because
[43:07] I'm I'm I'm talking about work today
[43:09] work and the the kingdom of God's
[43:12] perspective about work now when I'm
[43:14] talking about the kingdom of God because
[43:15] I know generally thank you brothers and
[43:17] and sister um um what's what's the name
[43:22] again Carol Carol uh Ruth Carol
[43:28] Sim
[43:31] yeah all right um speak I know I'm
[43:34] talking about the kingdom of God kingom
[43:36] of God and then because it's very
[43:38] popular I mean and I'm not trying to put
[43:41] anybody down and I don't do it because
[43:44] you can only live as high as your
[43:46] Revelation our Pentecostal brothers are
[43:48] very good to about Kingdom values
[43:50] Kingdom these kingdom kingdom principles
[43:52] and Kingdom these and all that so and
[43:54] when you really dig down to it
[43:56] judging about the message is not Kingdom
[44:00] anything it's just natural Canal selfs
[44:04] satisfying thing they tell you Kingdom
[44:07] wealth for example and many times the
[44:09] preachers see the people sitting down as
[44:12] an ATM
[44:14] machine and they're talking kingdom
[44:16] kingdom values and they are they are you
[44:19] know being filled up but the people are
[44:21] getting more imped and they see one or
[44:23] two or three or four who B didn't of
[44:26] their own you know they have raised up
[44:27] but they preach all this Kingdom to I'm
[44:29] not talking about that I'm not talking
[44:31] about I'm not trying to talk like I'm
[44:33] doing anything better than that I am not
[44:34] talking about so you oh yeah so just go
[44:36] and get a pentec picture talking when
[44:38] was talking Kingdom so they're talking
[44:39] Kingdom this because it's very popular
[44:41] language among Pentecostal Kingdom this
[44:42] and Kingdom this and Kingdom that but
[44:44] I'm not going to say because Pentecostal
[44:45] do is going to scare me away from it no
[44:48] no that's what I'm trying to let you
[44:49] know I am not talking the same might be
[44:51] talking the same but I'm coming from a
[44:53] totally different angle because because
[44:55] I'm not talking about manipulating
[44:58] people I'm talking about the Holy Spirit
[45:01] God
[45:02] himself amen making himself available
[45:06] for his children to
[45:10] use for the benefit of each of their
[45:13] lives
[45:16] amen so I thought I should put that
[45:18] caveat out so you won't you know just go
[45:21] searching for like what they say Kingdom
[45:23] this and Kingdom that and all that
[45:24] stuff but you understand what we're
[45:27] talking about I'm not talking about
[45:28] principles of the of is life is about
[45:31] principles I'm not talking about PR I'm
[45:33] not talk if you're talking principles
[45:35] about other then we'll be talking the
[45:37] same like you know motivational speakers
[45:39] are talking I'm not talking just
[45:41] principles I'm talking about the the
[45:44] spirit of God is a central theme in what
[45:46] I'm talking about the spirit of God not
[45:51] principles you can you can follow the
[45:53] principles all you want and and only 2
[45:56] 3% will be able to get anything done
[45:58] because the rest of us don't have enough
[46:00] willpower to use those principles but
[46:03] I'm talking about the kingdom where 97
[46:05] 98 99% of us can use these principles
[46:09] and that's only enabled by the kingdom
[46:11] of I mean by the spirit of God because
[46:12] it's not you but the Zeal of the Lord of
[46:16] hosts will perform this amen
[46:23] amen Ecclesiastes chapter 9 and
[46:27] verse um verse 10 whatsoever thy hand
[46:31] find to do do it do it with thy might
[46:34] whatever your hand find do whatever your
[46:36] hand find do whatever do with thy might
[46:41] Kingdom for there is no work nor devis
[46:45] nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave
[46:47] wither thou goest don't be scared
[46:50] anybody into the grave but that's what
[46:51] he's saying that at the end of it that's
[46:54] where all life ends up in
[46:56] so where there is work is here there's
[46:59] no work on the other side work is here
[47:02] amen and I'll show you I hope I'll get
[47:04] to it um show you um why walk is an
[47:07] integral part of of you know Humanity so
[47:12] you don't understand from the scripture
[47:14] base if you ask many people today why do
[47:16] you work they don't have they don't have
[47:17] they don't have a clue they just
[47:19] everybody does it they they expected to
[47:21] work but why do you work because if you
[47:24] don't know why you're doing what you're
[47:25] doing you're not going to be the best at
[47:27] it if you apply yourself at all you're
[47:29] not going to do with
[47:30] Excellence I mean many people don't even
[47:32] have a spr get to what Excellence you
[47:34] just want to get by if you don't know
[47:36] why you do work at all you go to your
[47:39] job you'll give your job you'll give
[47:40] your boss 10% you steal his 90 90% And
[47:44] you expect to get paid for it if you
[47:46] don't understand the purpose of work why
[47:49] you work and many people
[47:52] don't and that's what we're talking
[47:54] about and it's such an integral part of
[47:56] the Kingdom integral part of God's
[47:59] covenant with
[48:01] mankind be from before the
[48:05] fall so it's not a human thing is a God
[48:08] thing is a spiritual work is a spiritual
[48:11] thing
[48:16] amen whatsoever thy hand fin to do do
[48:19] with thy might other do it all
[48:21] diligence diligence consistency
[48:24] persistency you know with
[48:27] Focus for there is no work nor divice
[48:30] knowledge nor wisdom in the grave with
[48:32] thou goest I returned and saw Under the
[48:35] Sun that the race is not to the Swift
[48:39] nor the battle to the strong so even
[48:42] while you do the work listen here
[48:45] neither yet bread to the
[48:47] wise nor yet riches to Men of
[48:51] understanding nor yet favor to Men of
[48:53] skill I I'll get back to this not today
[48:55] today so I don't want to I have a
[48:57] tendency to talk and talk and talk I
[48:59] don't I don't want to be be disciplined
[49:01] to uh um get to what I'm saying but
[49:04] here's the point he's making here even
[49:06] with all your work but time and chance
[49:09] happen to them all time and chance is
[49:12] opportunity happens to
[49:15] everybody happens to
[49:20] everybody Ephesians
[49:22] 4:28 let him th thus St
[49:26] still no more so it's not like so
[49:30] because I have God's spirit now
[49:33] automatically I'm not going to steal
[49:35] anymore no the holy spirit is an
[49:37] enablement a
[49:39] power to help you but
[49:41] doesn't take over your will no you hand
[49:45] over your will to him so if you were if
[49:48] you were a thief
[49:49] before this scripture here lets us that
[49:52] living a Christian Life a life a
[49:54] Christlike life is is a deliberate thing
[49:56] you decide yourself is a matter of
[49:59] choice it's an intentional deliberate
[50:02] thing you do in your right
[50:05] mind I will arise I will go to my father
[50:09] I will say to him father I have seen a
[50:13] Del a conscious deliberate effort on
[50:16] your part so let him that store now you
[50:19] have go Spirit steal no more deliberate
[50:21] I am not going to steal because the
[50:23] Temptations that going to come to you to
[50:25] steal
[50:26] Hallelujah the tempation that's going to
[50:28] come to you to do all the things you
[50:30] used to do
[50:32] before that's why you see things that
[50:34] different now something happened to me
[50:36] when I gave my life to things that love
[50:38] before have passed away things that love
[50:40] for more have come to
[50:43] stay and that's why it's so vital that
[50:46] we maintain a constant constant constant
[50:51] everyday relationship with the Lord
[50:52] Jesus
[50:54] Christ let let him that sto steal no
[50:57] more but rather let him labor work
[51:01] working with his hands the thing which
[51:04] is good that he may have to give to him
[51:08] that needeth we'll get to this later the
[51:11] PA your work PA your work includes
[51:15] giving many people say now I don't have
[51:18] enough and they never give that's why
[51:21] you remain the way you are I'm not
[51:22] telling you give me anything I don't
[51:23] need a thing from you
[51:26] nobody needs a thing from anybody but
[51:27] it's part and parcel of the kingdom of
[51:29] God the principles of the Kingdom you've
[51:32] got to give not given because if i s his
[51:35] seed I get back no not
[51:37] that it's just part of the Kingdom
[51:43] principles so in other words you are
[51:45] walking you are conscious of the fact
[51:46] you are walking so you can have to give
[51:49] to him that needs so him that needs
[51:52] doesn't go like that oh so thank God
[51:55] told them now I need the Bible has the
[51:58] word for you to him he that will not
[52:00] work let him not
[52:06] eat do you have some time
[52:09] [Applause]
[52:11] Legos I don't mean today today we have
[52:13] Sunday School uh Sunday school um kids I
[52:16] don't mean I don't mean as Sunday school
[52:19] I mean I don't mean today I'm
[52:21] sorry but I get a feeling sometimes like
[52:24] the many of us get to church and we just
[52:26] get so excited and I never sit back to
[52:30] take it in and and reg goate what we
[52:34] hear and apply to our hearts and lives I
[52:39] get the fear many
[52:44] times let him walk with his hands I told
[52:47] you last
[52:48] week the purpose in in the um promised
[52:53] land was he wanted to bless the work of
[52:55] their hands is such an integral part of
[52:59] of God's contract with mankind the work
[53:02] of your hands what is that in your
[53:05] hand what is that in your hand is not a
[53:07] catchphrase it's an integral part of the
[53:10] Gospel of and I'll show you from the
[53:13] Bible beginning from Genesis from from
[53:16] Adam in
[53:18] Eden I'll show you what the what the
[53:21] fall did to work I'll show you I I I'll
[53:24] try to show you I mean forgive me for
[53:26] saying like I'm going to show you
[53:27] something the holy spirit is one that
[53:28] can show us anything but I'm just trying
[53:29] to I'll show you from the scriptures you
[53:31] know and it let for the Holy Spirit to
[53:34] to take the words and B them into bread
[53:36] to feed
[53:37] you all
[53:39] right 1 Peter verse one chter 1 verse 7
[53:43] that the trial of your
[53:45] faith being much more precious than gold
[53:48] that perisheth in other words when we
[53:50] are being tried We are Becoming like
[53:53] gold when we are being right we becoming
[53:56] valuable when we're being tested and
[53:58] proven in the wilderness we becoming
[54:01] like gold more precious than goal more
[54:04] valuable than go so when you understand
[54:05] when you talk about value in work value
[54:09] in the marketplace that's what he's
[54:11] talking about that's how it comes in the
[54:13] kingdom of
[54:14] God it doesn't come by going to school
[54:17] even though going to school is a major
[54:19] part of how you get this value but it
[54:21] comes from the school of life where you
[54:24] go through your trials and testings when
[54:27] you go to school you go through tests
[54:28] right that's a school regular school in
[54:32] God's school also you go through tests
[54:33] and trials so it's a different kind of
[54:36] test that test is testing your school
[54:39] test is testing your head this test from
[54:41] God is testing your heart your character
[54:45] so it's the same thing same
[54:49] thing and when they think you have
[54:51] enough you know enough they move from
[54:53] primary one to primary two
[54:56] becomes you become too valuable for PR
[54:59] one you go to PR
[55:02] two so
[55:05] test to test and prove what stuff you
[55:09] are made of what value you have whether
[55:12] you're becoming like gold or you're like
[55:14] silver um Rubble or some other precious
[55:18] tone so the trial of your faith much
[55:21] more being much more precious than that
[55:23] of gold that perisheth though it be tra
[55:25] with fire might be found onto praise and
[55:29] honor and Glory at the appearance of
[55:32] Jesus Christ and I I have a con
[55:33] scripture that I'll just read quickly
[55:35] speaking along the same thing job 23 and
[55:37] verse 10 but he knoweth the way that I
[55:39] take when he have tried me I myself
[55:43] shall come forth as gold I am gold when
[55:46] you are tried when you go through the
[55:48] Wilderness you are coming as gold not
[55:50] not you will be you will be like gold I
[55:52] shall come forth as gold gold is value
[55:56] go is value valuable hallah valuable
[55:59] Rich material that's what that's what
[56:02] God is trying to get you through that's
[56:03] what I told last week don't waste the
[56:05] Crisis crisis where you can become gold
[56:08] can become golden golden character gold
[56:12] you are wasting with mumbling grumbling
[56:15] not today but I'll show you but if you
[56:16] have a time go read numbers 1112 1314
[56:20] and see how Israel provoke God to where
[56:23] God said I had enough and said 40 years
[56:26] you're going to spend in this Wilderness
[56:28] here a Jo that taking them just 11 days
[56:31] 40 years because of the mumbling because
[56:33] the
[56:37] unbelief he knowth the way that I take
[56:40] when he tried me I shall come forth as
[56:42] gold May the Lord has his Blessing the
[56:44] reading of his holy words amen so today
[56:47] I'm um trying to shing a bit longer than
[56:50] I I thought it would originally but I
[56:53] felt the Lord spoke my like that it's
[56:55] very major that they get and understand
[56:56] this if they get and understand this
[56:58] here I promise you totally absolutely
[57:00] transform your life to levels you will
[57:02] never imagine and these are not new
[57:05] things but I think maybe now you can
[57:06] hear you can listen you can take it all
[57:09] in and I pray and hope like I I'm able
[57:12] to make it a bit clear for you to see
[57:14] and I'll try not to hold you too long so
[57:16] I will um not make it weome for you so
[57:21] um so still speaking on the same subject
[57:23] like I said in the church meeting on
[57:25] politics the
[57:27] government uh the economy and you and
[57:31] today particularly I want to like begin
[57:32] to talk a little bit about work the
[57:34] place of work in the context of the
[57:36] kingdom of God because my in my
[57:39] insistence is that when we live anywhere
[57:42] we live on the face of the Earth here we
[57:43] should not live within those economies
[57:46] we should live in the economy of God
[57:50] because if you live in the economies
[57:52] where you at man's economy is always in
[57:54] a recession I don't think I read it but
[57:56] last week I showed you where when Israel
[57:59] rejected God's economy and God's
[58:02] government type of government was too
[58:05] religious and then
[58:08] Israel um
[58:10] chose to have a king like other nations
[58:13] in other words want to be like want to
[58:15] have the government like other nations
[58:16] have and Samuel felt bad that they are
[58:19] rejecting God said no s don't feel bad
[58:21] it's not you they are rejected it's me
[58:23] they are rejected but let just tell them
[58:26] what they want give it to them but let
[58:27] me show them what they're going to get
[58:30] and then God told Abra I mean um Simon
[58:33] to tell Israel the kind of King they're
[58:36] going to get not just
[58:38] Saul in other words the because like
[58:41] other nations the kind of system of
[58:44] government they're going to get and what
[58:47] that system of government is going to
[58:48] give them and I tell you read 1st Samuel
[58:51] chapter 8 and you will see the
[58:53] discussion there between God and Samuel
[58:55] and the Israelites and then you'll
[58:58] see how God said these systems are going
[59:01] to do what they're going to do to people
[59:03] and you you can fit any system there you
[59:06] can Feit the monarchy there you can Feit
[59:08] the Empire system there you can fix you
[59:11] can Feit federalism there you can Feit
[59:14] socialism there you can Feit uh um
[59:16] communism there you can Feit a vaed
[59:18] democracy there you can even fit in our
[59:21] Nigerian homegrown democracy you can fit
[59:23] it in there is the same thing he tells
[59:26] you what will happen to your sons and
[59:28] your
[59:30] daughters it's just a system that and
[59:34] slaves now there are some slaves who are
[59:36] the top of the pile who are the top of
[59:39] the pile so they look like they're not
[59:41] slaves but the system were all enslaved
[59:43] by the
[59:47] system and that's why the people who are
[59:49] like you know against Taxation and all
[59:51] that stuff they fight bad because they
[59:53] feel the government you know just wants
[59:55] to own you and like task Masters that
[59:58] you have to pay tax to all the time you
[1:00:01] think that doesn't matter Jesus they
[1:00:04] came to his disciples and that why
[1:00:06] doesn't your master pay
[1:00:10] taxes let me not get into
[1:00:14] that and Peter like was shaking and told
[1:00:18] them that yeah and that this this like
[1:00:21] my master pay taxes you so that they won
[1:00:23] so f i right Marian is that what it is f
[1:00:26] FRS will come after Jesus and there'll
[1:00:28] be a scandal like it will make Headline
[1:00:31] News man who claims to be the Mah is is
[1:00:36] is what do you call it he's not paying
[1:00:38] taxes he owes taxes of 30 years pet said
[1:00:42] no my my master pays taxes so Jesus
[1:00:45] called him and said Peter let me ask you
[1:00:49] and dis other disciples a question to
[1:00:51] whom do the children of this world Peter
[1:00:55] taxes do kings pay taxes or is it the
[1:01:01] slaves subjects that pay
[1:01:03] taxes and they said no Kings don't pay
[1:01:06] taxes Prince Charles or is it King King
[1:01:09] Charles doesn't pay any taxes doesn't
[1:01:11] pay any taxes and Jesus trying to tell
[1:01:14] them there I am a king I'm the king of
[1:01:16] the world I owe no man no
[1:01:19] taxes but but Jesus that's where that
[1:01:22] that was his agreeable
[1:01:25] nature even though Peter says something
[1:01:27] that he not agree with he's not going to
[1:01:30] spoil anything he says but so that won't
[1:01:32] offend them because you have already
[1:01:34] told them this go into the fish Bank in
[1:01:38] the bottom of the ocean throw in your
[1:01:42] fishing rod the first fish that comes
[1:01:44] out you'll get the tax there for them
[1:01:47] bring it out and go pay them so we don't
[1:01:49] offend them but really I owe them no
[1:01:51] taxes so I'm saying and all these things
[1:01:53] are together in in the kingdom kingdom
[1:01:55] principles are waiting
[1:01:57] there
[1:01:59] [Applause]
[1:02:06] Hallelujah
[1:02:07] anyway so we were speaking last week
[1:02:10] about I'll try to talk I'll try to talk
[1:02:11] so you'll be sure to hear me um about
[1:02:14] Israel's Wilderness Journey that the
[1:02:17] Wilderness was their training school I
[1:02:20] like to say the training school of Life
[1:02:21] the school of life like I'm saying
[1:02:22] school school is all about testing you
[1:02:24] and other they have different methods of
[1:02:26] testing this is but still about testing
[1:02:28] so they'll be able to determine whether
[1:02:29] you have the value or the the content
[1:02:31] within you to move to the next class the
[1:02:33] next grade the next so that can be know
[1:02:36] whether determine whether you are worthy
[1:02:37] of the certificate the badge of honor
[1:02:40] that you have a bachelor or a Masters or
[1:02:43] a doctorate or
[1:02:45] whatever we are the value in you to say
[1:02:49] you have the degree that the college or
[1:02:51] the
[1:02:52] university gives out
[1:02:54] so the Wilderness was Israel's training
[1:02:58] school and what was he doing he was to
[1:03:01] prepare them for the task of entering
[1:03:04] the promised land and when they enter
[1:03:06] the land to subdue the promised land and
[1:03:09] when they subdue the land to possess the
[1:03:11] promised land so it's not just to enter
[1:03:14] the land I enter the land and then see
[1:03:15] Giants there and they miss the point
[1:03:17] that's when they saw giants they fell no
[1:03:19] this guy want to kill us
[1:03:21] here if they took their training the
[1:03:24] promised land will be a small
[1:03:27] matter they had to work but will be a
[1:03:29] small matter but because they didn't
[1:03:31] take their training they wasted the
[1:03:35] crisis but that training was to prepare
[1:03:38] them
[1:03:39] for the task of entering the promised
[1:03:42] land having entered them to subdue the
[1:03:44] land and then to possess the promised
[1:03:48] land the Wilderness therefore was a very
[1:03:51] painful experience but was a necessary
[1:03:54] experi experience for them it was a
[1:03:55] necessary part of their preparation for
[1:03:57] the promised
[1:03:59] land being in that spot where they don't
[1:04:01] have where they want to wumble and cry
[1:04:04] was painful was a painful
[1:04:07] experience but like we read last week
[1:04:09] God planned it God God designed it God
[1:04:14] had a purpose in it the Wilderness was a
[1:04:17] painful experience but necessary part of
[1:04:19] their preparation for the promised
[1:04:22] land this preparation was targeted at
[1:04:25] their
[1:04:26] hearts at their hearts about the Inner
[1:04:29] Man the inner person the person they are
[1:04:32] on the
[1:04:34] inside to form character in them to form
[1:04:38] character value gold on the inside of
[1:04:41] them that's how when he has tried me I
[1:04:43] will comfort as gold your trials are to
[1:04:46] a point the purpose God wants to make
[1:04:48] you gold
[1:04:50] yes character
[1:04:53] gold
[1:04:54] Jesus said buy of me gold tried in the
[1:04:57] fire that's what he's talking about
[1:04:59] that's why we're looking for the spirit
[1:05:01] of God Jesus himself went in the
[1:05:04] wilderness the spirit drove him into the
[1:05:06] Wilderness for what for character
[1:05:08] formation that was God who was God
[1:05:11] himself alone but to show us how it how
[1:05:13] it is because the Bible says we know
[1:05:16] like a I used to do a song when I was
[1:05:18] growing up when Jesus walked in Galilee
[1:05:20] he gave all men a chance to see what God
[1:05:23] in intends for them to be and how they
[1:05:26] ought to live so he did many things to
[1:05:29] show us how it should be so he went into
[1:05:34] the Wilderness just like and God's
[1:05:36] spirit drove him into the just like
[1:05:38] God's spirit drove Israel Into the
[1:05:41] Wilderness and the Bible say what
[1:05:44] happened in the wilderness what happened
[1:05:47] Satan came at
[1:05:49] him to give him the
[1:05:52] test lot of the eyes lust of the flesh
[1:05:55] PR of life to test him on the World to
[1:05:59] test him in the flesh in his spirit in
[1:06:02] his eyes just test him everywhere like
[1:06:04] Israel was tested with Hunger isra was
[1:06:08] tested with Hunger Jesus was tested with
[1:06:09] Hunger test everything like isia was
[1:06:17] tested but he did not go their
[1:06:20] route it took his 10 believe even what
[1:06:24] God Said and was built up character on
[1:06:28] the inside of him he did not waste his
[1:06:32] crisis character on the inside of
[1:06:36] him and the Bible said St Luke 4:4 Jesus
[1:06:40] came out of the Wilderness in the power
[1:06:43] of the
[1:06:47] spirit because he did not waste the
[1:06:49] crisis that his tests and
[1:06:51] trials represented
[1:06:54] can you say amen amen
[1:06:59] amen all right so
[1:07:02] um
[1:07:07] okay okay
[1:07:15] um all right so so the night Journey was
[1:07:19] about really about the hearts go wanted
[1:07:21] to build character goal value on the
[1:07:25] inside of them so he was second that
[1:07:27] their hearts not at anything else but
[1:07:30] their hearts so the Wilderness and the
[1:07:34] ties and the testings and all that I did
[1:07:37] to prove you I humbled you and all that
[1:07:40] stuff was not about the
[1:07:42] destination was not about the wealth
[1:07:44] they were going to get in the promised
[1:07:45] land no no that's why many of them did
[1:07:48] not get to that wealth that's why they
[1:07:51] not get to that abundance in the
[1:07:52] Promised Land
[1:07:56] because they miss the purpose if you
[1:07:57] miss the purpose you miss purpose you
[1:07:59] are finished you're
[1:08:01] done so Wilderness was not primarily
[1:08:05] about the destination it was more about
[1:08:07] the condition of their hearts it was
[1:08:09] more about their
[1:08:11] preparation and the people of value that
[1:08:14] God wanted them to become so that
[1:08:16] they'll be ready to take the promised
[1:08:19] land so the Wilderness was never
[1:08:22] primarily about the destination
[1:08:24] you understand that amen not for Israel
[1:08:27] not for you not for me it's not about
[1:08:30] the destination what God is interested
[1:08:32] in in your Wilderness may say I want to
[1:08:35] be this I want to be that you have you
[1:08:36] can't jump over the Wilderness the
[1:08:37] Wilderness is a path and parcel of the
[1:08:39] journey the Wilderness is a necess
[1:08:41] painful but a necessary part of the
[1:08:45] journey and I told you how you know
[1:08:47] you're in the wilderness I'll tell you
[1:08:48] how you know you're inness you in that
[1:08:50] SP where you just you just have enough
[1:08:53] you can make all the money all the
[1:08:55] resources just find that it just goes
[1:08:57] away that's the sign you in the
[1:08:58] wilderness you're not learning all the
[1:09:00] lesson go want you learn where did where
[1:09:02] did the money go to you in the
[1:09:05] wilderness is the money is
[1:09:08] spoiling the manner just couldn't go
[1:09:12] extra because God s you that his fault
[1:09:14] because they hadn't taken their
[1:09:15] [Music]
[1:09:17] lessons it's not about how much money
[1:09:19] you make no it's not about that God help
[1:09:23] us God help
[1:09:31] anyway so the witness was not about the
[1:09:34] destination it was more about their
[1:09:36] hearts about the value that God wanted
[1:09:39] to put in their soul so they come out of
[1:09:40] winess with power that's the power to
[1:09:43] create the wealth the power to get
[1:09:46] wealth the power to create wealth have
[1:09:48] you ever heard the phrase when you talk
[1:09:50] wealth people just need money no wealth
[1:09:52] is the re deeper richer than that have
[1:09:54] you ever had the phrase wealth of
[1:09:56] experience have you ever had the phrase
[1:09:58] wealth of knowledge have you had the
[1:10:00] phrase wealth of wisdom have you ever
[1:10:02] had the phrase wealth of understanding
[1:10:04] that's what creates the wealth that you
[1:10:06] are talking
[1:10:08] about the Lord but wealth is richer
[1:10:10] deeper than the very narrow thing that
[1:10:13] you you put on
[1:10:15] [Music]
[1:10:17] it so the Wilderness therefore is your
[1:10:21] preparation is the mean to the end that
[1:10:25] you
[1:10:26] seek whatever you want to be whatever
[1:10:29] you are going for the Wilderness is the
[1:10:32] route you are going to take to get there
[1:10:34] Israel couldn't jump from slavery and
[1:10:36] strength the promised land no they had
[1:10:39] to Traverse the rocky terrain of the
[1:10:42] Wilderness amen the Wilderness was a
[1:10:45] route it was the means by which they
[1:10:48] will be able to achieve the promised
[1:10:50] land and it's the means by which you and
[1:10:52] I will be able to achieve
[1:10:54] the desired end goal what whatever you
[1:10:57] desire without this Wilderness
[1:11:01] preparation your attainment your
[1:11:04] achievement of long-term sustainable
[1:11:07] success in any area of life is very
[1:11:12] remote if not outrightly
[1:11:15] impossible I don't want to say out
[1:11:17] impossible is very very remote and
[1:11:20] that's why many of you remain the way
[1:11:21] you are every small thing happens you
[1:11:23] Mumble Grumble complain because you the
[1:11:26] devil is telling you what's going on get
[1:11:29] but bam came to take us back to the
[1:11:31] world back to the Bible what did the
[1:11:33] prophet tell us about this here what the
[1:11:36] Bible tell
[1:11:42] us and we keep failing and failing and
[1:11:45] failing in this school of life that's
[1:11:48] why we never get promoted to the next
[1:11:49] level you fail in your school natural
[1:11:52] school they're not going to promote
[1:11:53] going to next
[1:11:58] class I said the the Wilderness the test
[1:12:01] is not nobody sees a t thank God a test
[1:12:03] is coming no nobody sees that something
[1:12:05] wrong with your head you do that but you
[1:12:07] have a knowledge and understand that why
[1:12:09] the tests are there we don't enjoy them
[1:12:12] but is a necessary painful but necessary
[1:12:15] part of our preparation for the higher
[1:12:18] Heights God wants us to go to you
[1:12:20] couldn't how can you compare the
[1:12:21] promised land to the Wilderness or
[1:12:24] slaver in
[1:12:25] Egypt by no stretch of anybody's
[1:12:27] imagination should we be able to
[1:12:29] compare
[1:12:31] them so the promised land is something
[1:12:34] what dying for something what giving up
[1:12:36] everything to get there a land that
[1:12:38] flows to make and Hy and of abundance
[1:12:43] amen so without the Wilderness you and I
[1:12:46] are going nowhere the success we are
[1:12:49] looking for is very remote and I would
[1:12:52] say almost outrightly
[1:12:56] impossible because the Wilderness is
[1:12:58] where God works on
[1:12:59] you works in your inner man to ship you
[1:13:04] into the person that can um
[1:13:08] handle the destination that can handle
[1:13:11] the success that can handle the weight
[1:13:14] of the
[1:13:15] blessing that the kingdom of God
[1:13:18] represents he
[1:13:21] said of the increase of his government
[1:13:25] of his kingdom there shall be no end and
[1:13:28] the government shall be upon his
[1:13:30] shoulder your should when you your
[1:13:33] should it represents you represents
[1:13:35] strength to carry something that's
[1:13:39] heavy the weight of the responsibility
[1:13:42] the weight of
[1:13:44] success watch in the Bible I'm not
[1:13:46] talking at you look in the Bible very
[1:13:50] few people could handle
[1:13:51] success not even even Solomon not even
[1:13:55] The Heroes of Faith that we talk about
[1:13:58] Hallelujah that's why Paul said so that
[1:14:00] for the abundance of Revelations he will
[1:14:02] not be overtaken with pride God had to
[1:14:05] put a a thorn in his flesh to keep him
[1:14:08] humble huah for his b to keep him humble
[1:14:12] and teach him to pray every single day
[1:14:14] because we are not built to be able to
[1:14:16] handle the blessing and that's why God
[1:14:19] was warning Israel before the blessing
[1:14:21] would come run through the Bible people
[1:14:25] serve God when their pockets are empty
[1:14:27] once their pockets are are getting
[1:14:29] filled up you see them become something
[1:14:31] else in the
[1:14:33] Bible I told you repeated Israel when
[1:14:36] they they CED to God God please God
[1:14:39] delivers them once the judge dies they
[1:14:42] go back again to their filthiness their
[1:14:44] their
[1:14:46] ungodliness because God delivers them
[1:14:48] the judge comes and the land the land
[1:14:50] prospers again and prospered in their
[1:14:52] pockets
[1:14:54] they lose their heads and go after
[1:14:56] strength
[1:14:57] Gods that's why I
[1:14:59] say many of you don't even have money to
[1:15:02] finance
[1:15:05] sin and what you show right away even
[1:15:08] when your pockets are empty shows what
[1:15:10] you will do when you
[1:15:12] have some money that's why God keeps
[1:15:14] away from you because he will not give
[1:15:16] you what will destroy you that's why he
[1:15:19] wants to get your heart first or he will
[1:15:22] not give you the bless you are looking
[1:15:23] for that's why many of you are talk on
[1:15:26] the same spot going around in
[1:15:29] circles all all action but no
[1:15:44] movement so we can sum up the Wilderness
[1:15:46] this
[1:15:48] way the purpose of the wilderness was
[1:15:53] and still always is God shaping the
[1:15:57] character of his people so they'll come
[1:15:59] forth like gold Comfort like people of
[1:16:02] Great Value and they'll take that value
[1:16:04] into the promised
[1:16:07] land how does that come about by the
[1:16:09] trials the testings the experiences that
[1:16:13] he gives them along the way in the
[1:16:16] wilderness these experiences and trials
[1:16:20] and tests teach them
[1:16:23] knowledge knowledge you know the church
[1:16:26] is not going to kill you knowledge you
[1:16:28] know God keeps his word knowledge you
[1:16:31] know God will answer your prayers
[1:16:33] knowledge to know
[1:16:37] knowledge these experiences the
[1:16:40] trials that's what God was wan to teach
[1:16:42] Israel in is a school school of life
[1:16:45] God's School come from Heaven seven
[1:16:47] angels come from Heaven pick me up into
[1:16:50] the Pyramid of themselves and begin to
[1:16:52] teach me about God's School God's school
[1:16:56] begin to teach them knowledge what do
[1:16:58] you get in school
[1:17:00] knowledge and the Bible says my people
[1:17:03] perish for lack of knowledge you don't
[1:17:06] perish because you have no money in your
[1:17:07] pocket you don't perish because you are
[1:17:10] nasty you perish because of lack of
[1:17:12] knowledge you fail in your classroom
[1:17:15] because of lack of
[1:17:19] knowledge my people perish for lack of
[1:17:22] knowledge and where there's no vision
[1:17:25] people are destroyed same
[1:17:32] thing so God's taken them you me through
[1:17:35] the
[1:17:36] Wilderness to teach them
[1:17:40] knowledge and from knowledge they get
[1:17:43] understanding because knowledge is
[1:17:45] nothing on its
[1:17:47] own knowledge when you examine it when
[1:17:51] you apply it you you get some
[1:17:54] understanding and then wisdom comes on
[1:17:57] the application of the understanding
[1:18:00] that you have gained from the knowledge
[1:18:03] so in the wilderness God was teaching
[1:18:04] them wisdom understanding and knowledge
[1:18:07] wisdom understanding and knowledge and
[1:18:09] that's why God never got even go will
[1:18:11] get angry at them but he will give them
[1:18:12] they Moses is in Egypt is that why you
[1:18:15] made us to come and die here God say
[1:18:16] Moses give them the food to let them see
[1:18:18] like God he'll take care of
[1:18:20] you God he'll make a way way where there
[1:18:24] seems to be no way he will take care of
[1:18:26] you amen when you do sin God will
[1:18:30] forgive you when you repent that's what
[1:18:32] the Wilderness
[1:18:34] represented he was there patiently
[1:18:36] showing them that he's a kind loving
[1:18:39] considerate sensitive heavenly father
[1:18:41] who will take care of his own who is
[1:18:44] devoted to his children when they are
[1:18:46] good when they are bad when they are
[1:18:47] nasty when they are evil is there with
[1:18:50] them to show that nobody can take good
[1:18:53] care of you like God
[1:18:54] will he'll take care of you how many
[1:18:57] have testimony he will take care of
[1:19:00] you amen God will make a way where there
[1:19:03] seems to be no way he walks in ways we
[1:19:06] cannot see he will make a way for you he
[1:19:09] will be your guide my
[1:19:11] guide amen he will do it he will do it
[1:19:16] are you learning that in your Wilderness

[1:24:01] value of
[1:24:02] gold
[1:24:04] amen it is this
[1:24:06] value this character that Israel was to
[1:24:10] get in the wilderness under the fiery

[1:28:38] cause foolishness what the work call
[1:28:40] foolishness God cause power character
[1:28:45] integrity
[1:28:47] Grace no wonder the Bible say when he
[1:28:49] has tried me I shall comfort as gold
[1:28:53] like we read the trial of your faith
[1:28:54] been much more
[1:28:56] precious
[1:28:57] than gold Jesus came out of the
[1:29:00] Wilderness in the power of the holy
[1:29:02] spirit so Israel got into the promised
[1:29:05] land and we read Joshua chapter 5 now
[1:29:09] when they entered Jericho in the
[1:29:10] promised land what was it God began to
[1:29:13] unveil some more about how the kingdom
[1:29:16] walks on Earth Here below remember there
[1:29:19] were in Egypt slaves in the Kingdom of
[1:29:22] God not under the kingdom of pharaoh
[1:29:24] they live there but they not live God s
[1:29:27] you that not live by the kingdom of
[1:29:31] pharaoh for their daily up because they
[1:29:33] were slaves they depend on somebody to
[1:29:35] give them food they task
[1:29:38] Masters and they never had enough slaves
[1:29:40] never have
[1:29:42] enough but when he came down to it when
[1:29:45] the Kingdom of Egypt was being judged
[1:29:47] and Egypt was the was the was the chief
[1:29:50] of the whole world at that time like the
[1:29:52] US is
[1:29:55] today when the Judgment came to Egypt
[1:29:58] they were in Goan in Egypt but not in
[1:30:02] Egypt in Egypt but protected from the
[1:30:04] plagues of Egypt and that's why I'm
[1:30:07] saying you you don't the plagues don't
[1:30:09] have to touch you no buhari's plague
[1:30:13] orus plague don't have to touch you
[1:30:16] we're not unrealistic about those things
[1:30:18] but it don't have to touch
[1:30:20] you and that's what I'm trying to show
[1:30:23] you I'm not talking religious talk I'm
[1:30:24] talking real world
[1:30:27] talk if you can receive it and do the
[1:30:31] work that's needed
[1:30:40] amen
[1:30:43] anyway so God in the world have been
[1:30:46] taken care of
[1:30:48] them and in the in the uh uh um Promised
[1:30:53] Land he was going to continue taking
[1:30:55] care of them but in a different sort of
[1:30:57] way and I want you to listen really good
[1:30:59] we again to work
[1:31:01] work in the wilderness he fed them daily
[1:31:04] with angel food Mana from
[1:31:07] heaven now the promised land the Mana
[1:31:11] EAS and now going forward he was going
[1:31:14] to feed them on the old corn of the
[1:31:20] land are you with me
[1:31:26] because the scriptures let us understand
[1:31:29] that the promised land was ready for
[1:31:31] planting and harvesting in other words
[1:31:33] the land was ready land was
[1:31:36] fertile ready to be harvested ready to
[1:31:38] be planted that's that's important to
[1:31:40] note we'll get to you
[1:31:42] later the prise are LED for planting and
[1:31:46] harvesting so that they will plant and
[1:31:50] the next year they will eat of the O of
[1:31:52] the land it totally changed Mana ceas
[1:32:00] immediately what does that
[1:32:03] mean it means that from from it means
[1:32:07] henceforth they were going to God was
[1:32:10] going to take care of them in a
[1:32:11] different sort of way by the old kind of
[1:32:15] the land by the planting and harvesting
[1:32:18] they were going to do in the land not no
[1:32:21] more miracle P Lo food from Heaven angel
[1:32:29] cake it means that going forward it was
[1:32:32] going to bless the work of the hands you
[1:32:34] read that in deom 28 was because is all
[1:32:38] about work he's going to bless the work
[1:32:40] of their
[1:32:42] hands which was his ultimate goal all
[1:32:50] along it couldn't bless the work of
[1:32:52] their hands in Egypt because they were
[1:32:54] slaves in the wilderness they were just
[1:32:56] passing through they were in school they
[1:32:58] didn't have
[1:33:00] work it was schooling them tutoring them
[1:33:03] so that they get knowledge wisdom
[1:33:05] understanding it's after school that you
[1:33:07] get
[1:33:11] [Applause]
[1:33:13] work
[1:33:18] so he couldn't bless the work of the
[1:33:20] hands in Egypt because they were slaves
[1:33:22] in the wilderness they were in school
[1:33:25] and then after school once they got into
[1:33:27] the promised land the work of their
[1:33:30] hands work of their hands oh brother
[1:33:35] amen so going forward that's the new
[1:33:39] program say God but where's the
[1:33:42] supernatural provision no that stopped
[1:33:45] that
[1:33:48] stopped how we going to eat the work of
[1:33:51] your hands
[1:33:53] no work of your hands no
[1:33:56] food give me give me some oil I ain't
[1:34:00] got n for enough for
[1:34:05] myself new order
[1:34:08] here but listen this runs really
[1:34:13] deep by God blessing the work of their
[1:34:16] hands because they go into this land
[1:34:17] here make honey and what they saw was
[1:34:19] Giants why is they make honey I'm sure
[1:34:22] they've imagined that that when they get
[1:34:23] there they'll just be walking it just be
[1:34:24] like you know when your street is water
[1:34:27] logged they just be waterlock milk and
[1:34:32] honey so their problem was going to be
[1:34:35] how they are going to like how they're
[1:34:36] going to refine how do you call like is
[1:34:39] it
[1:34:40] refin how to refine okay refiner right
[1:34:43] refine the milk and oil so that it be
[1:34:45] suitable for human consumption so they
[1:34:47] were going to like just be like ah in my
[1:34:49] own Street the milk is like up to waste
[1:34:52] level in my street is even like you know
[1:34:55] covering us up and they got there they
[1:34:57] saw like these rocks and mountains
[1:35:04] and you know in Nigerian lingo Nigerian
[1:35:07] lingo like this is one
[1:35:13] chance this is one chance they didn't
[1:35:15] say but like that they were very
[1:35:16] disappointed go read numbers 10 11 12 13
[1:35:20] 14 and see the power of disappointment
[1:35:24] in the things of God discouragement it's
[1:35:26] don't go there don't go there don't go
[1:35:31] there
[1:35:38] so where's the milk and where's the
[1:35:41] honey the work of your
[1:35:44] hands here is the Revelation by the work
[1:35:48] of their hands is that they're going to
[1:35:50] access the the milk and the honey and
[1:35:53] it's going to be not just access going
[1:35:54] to be a flow of it it's going to be an
[1:35:56] abundance of it of milk and honey amen
[1:36:00] amen all brother is somebody hearing me
[1:36:05] glory to God
[1:36:07] Amen oh
[1:36:09] Hallelujah so by God blessing he promise
[1:36:12] he said he is he promised to bless the
[1:36:14] work of their hands it's not like that
[1:36:16] show me the kind of work whatever of
[1:36:18] course it can't be like dubious work
[1:36:19] show me the work the work of hands some
[1:36:22] have this work some have that work the
[1:36:24] work of your hands it doesn't matter the
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:36:35] work I could say something but I better
[1:36:37] leave there
[1:36:38] alone I better leave there alone no
[1:36:41] customers they won't take it
[1:36:46] leave
[1:36:49] so how do we access the milk and the
[1:36:53] honey he told them before they got to
[1:36:54] the
[1:36:55] land read Deuteronomy 8 again he told
[1:37:00] them like that your rocks I have hidden
[1:37:02] Stones inside there I mean your rocks
[1:37:04] have hidden iron inside there I've
[1:37:06] hidden brass inside there I've heing
[1:37:08] stuff inside different places when when
[1:37:10] you understand when you understand
[1:37:13] wisdom wisdom to know how to go into
[1:37:15] those rocks and things you'll bring out
[1:37:18] the iron you'll do stuff with the iron
[1:37:22] Hallelujah you you'll give people you
[1:37:25] from the iron and the things that have
[1:37:27] hidden in the land in the sea in the
[1:37:30] rocks and the mountains when you do
[1:37:32] stuff with them you are going to give
[1:37:34] value to people and though people are
[1:37:36] going to Glory that's how you are
[1:37:40] creating wealth creating value for
[1:37:43] people and that's how wealth comes back
[1:37:45] to
[1:37:46] [Applause]
[1:37:47] you you'll find the Mir the horny is too
[1:37:51] too much too much Prosperity too much
[1:37:55] abundance will say those years back too
[1:37:57] much Prosperity amen may be see
[1:38:00] that it doesn't come by bet
[1:38:03] Niger
[1:38:17] no I go into other but let me leave that
[1:38:20] alone all the all the machine slot slot
[1:38:23] machines of Las Vegas and all the
[1:38:25] gambling and all the
[1:38:27] stuff I don't see the scripture for it
[1:38:29] I'll show you but not not today let's
[1:38:31] let's let's try and get a walk here
[1:38:33] let's let's get a walk here
[1:38:36] so by God blessing the work of their
[1:38:38] hands that was how they were going to
[1:38:39] access the honey the milk and the Honey
[1:38:42] in the promised land the land flowing
[1:38:44] will milk and honey flowing not dripping
[1:38:47] flowing and it flow what does that mean
[1:38:50] an abundant
[1:38:53] amen let's bring it all down to you and
[1:38:55] I
[1:38:57] today
[1:38:59] notice that the the the ultimate goal
[1:39:02] was always
[1:39:03] abundance but notice they not have
[1:39:05] abundance in Egypt now they have
[1:39:08] abundance in the wilderness is somebody
[1:39:11] WR in their Bible did somebody read that
[1:39:13] in their Bible can I hear you do they
[1:39:16] have abundance in the wilderness they
[1:39:18] have abundance in Egypt in Egypt they
[1:39:20] had less than enough but just to keep
[1:39:23] soul and body together like those years
[1:39:26] at night they say w to God morning will
[1:39:28] come and the morning they say what to
[1:39:29] God night will come it was uncomfortable
[1:39:36] existence my brother bham I mean Master
[1:39:39] Storyteller that he was let us see this
[1:39:41] things so very well uh down through the
[1:39:44] years so an abundance amen they didn't
[1:39:48] see it in Egypt they didn't see it in
[1:39:49] the wilderness and neither will you or
[1:39:51] me see abundance in the wilderness or in
[1:39:55] Egypt we're not going to why the
[1:39:59] provision in the wilderness was only
[1:40:02] God's Supernatural provision to meet
[1:40:04] their everyday daily
[1:40:07] needs while they travel the Wilderness
[1:40:10] my Lord knows the road to the Wilderness
[1:40:13] all I have to do is follow my Lord knows
[1:40:16] the way through the Wilderness all I
[1:40:18] have to do is to follow listen to me
[1:40:20] real good don't sit down there tired and
[1:40:25] listen to me really good of course you
[1:40:27] don't have to I mean forgive me you

[1:40:30] can tell you that if you if you listen
[1:40:32] your life will be totally T listen
[1:40:35] listen taken to levels you will never
[1:40:37] imagine what's possible right from from
[1:40:39] the page of the Bible from the gospel of
[1:40:42] Malachi first message
[1:40:49] amen amen the
[1:40:55] Wilderness was not the land of
[1:40:59] abundance when is only the land for
[1:41:03] God's Supernatural provision to me their
[1:41:05] everyday needs while they travel through
[1:41:07] that
[1:41:07] school they not have to work for the
[1:41:10] fruit or the provision of
[1:41:12] it as good and as kind as that
[1:41:17] sounded loving caring heav h l father
[1:41:21] providing for their need supernaturally
[1:41:24] water from the rock Mana from Heaven
[1:41:26] providing for their health care Snak
[1:41:29] beat them just look just look up and
[1:41:31] then everything is gone
[1:41:34] supernaturally the supernatural God they
[1:41:36] were going from Miracle to Miracle to
[1:41:38] Miracle to
[1:41:40] Miracle there was only a temporary plan
[1:41:43] that wasn't God's ultimate
[1:41:46] goal
[1:41:49] GL
[1:41:55] so as good and as kind and as loable as
[1:41:58] that was I'm sure the one you get the
[1:42:00] promised land and like just wake up now
[1:42:03] we are home now so we can really get
[1:42:06] this this this manner from heaven with
[1:42:09] some quills too and we can do them into
[1:42:11] different store we can make them into
[1:42:13] like what you call now you make them
[1:42:15] into different things different things
[1:42:17] for breakfast for lunch for dinner have
[1:42:20] some for the friends for the family we
[1:42:21] can even sell some can do stuff that so
[1:42:23] the man just come and then we just be in
[1:42:25] wealth milk and
[1:42:28] honey God doesn't reason the way you
[1:42:30] reason God's interested in the man on
[1:42:32] the
[1:42:33] inside the man on the
[1:42:36] inside if you are God's child if you are
[1:42:38] God's child if you are God's child you
[1:42:40] are God's seed you will never come into
[1:42:44] wealth if God doesn't have your heart I
[1:42:47] promise you that you will never even
[1:42:49] when you have plenty
[1:42:52] you will just find that it will
[1:42:53] spoil some need out of the blues will
[1:42:56] just come from somewhere to take it all
[1:42:58] away from you because God doesn't have
[1:43:00] your heart yet that's why it says seek
[1:43:03] ye first the kingdom of God and his
[1:43:05] righteousness it's all your benefit not
[1:43:08] because God needs you or me it's for
[1:43:10] your
[1:43:11] benefit can you say
[1:43:17] Amen no you're not hearing me really
[1:43:19] well no you're not here Jo are they are
[1:43:22] are they following me you think they are
[1:43:24] all right all
[1:43:35] right all right
[1:43:37] so the supernatural provision was only a
[1:43:40] temporary plan it wasn't a long-term
[1:43:44] plan Supernatural pration miracle
[1:43:47] miracle was not God's long-term plan for
[1:43:49] them
[1:43:51] it was only a temporary shortterm
[1:43:53] plan providing for them Supernatural in
[1:43:56] the wilderness in a place where they
[1:43:58] couldn't provide for themselves even if
[1:44:00] they wanted to was only God's way of
[1:44:04] showing that he was and still is a
[1:44:07] faithful caring father who takes care of
[1:44:10] his own and God wants you to understand
[1:44:12] that that he cares for his own amen and
[1:44:15] nobody can do that better than him he
[1:44:17] cares for you he carth for you through
[1:44:19] sunshine or
[1:44:21] sorrow Shadow he cares for his own he
[1:44:24] cares for you amen but too many people
[1:44:27] they don't say it like but they feel
[1:44:29] like that this God has failed them they
[1:44:32] F God has failed them I'm not talking
[1:44:35] any personal to anybody I'm not talking
[1:44:36] to any because I mean I'm not talking to
[1:44:37] any anybody I'm talking from the
[1:44:39] scriptures you know how I talk I'm
[1:44:40] talking from the
[1:44:42] scriptures just like Israel that's the
[1:44:44] Prototype the antitype of the Prototype
[1:44:47] that's the antitype of the type Israel
[1:44:49] fa God had failed them
[1:45:01] so God providing for them Supernatural
[1:45:03] in the wilderness was only God's way of
[1:45:05] showing them of building up their trust
[1:45:08] and faith that no one can take better
[1:45:11] care of them than God will that God
[1:45:13] Alone will take care of them and he will
[1:45:16] take care of you he will take care of
[1:45:18] you I don't care what he will take care
[1:45:19] of you
[1:45:21] because notice what they couldn't do for
[1:45:23] themselves God stepped in and even right
[1:45:25] now even when you are in the promised
[1:45:27] land that which you cannot do for
[1:45:28] yourself God steps in he will step in
[1:45:32] for you he will do for you what you
[1:45:34] cannot do for yourself because it's a
[1:45:36] faithful God he's a caring God Amen he's
[1:45:39] the god of the universe and so it
[1:45:42] matters not what the doctor says it
[1:45:44] matters not what he will take care of
[1:45:46] you in a in a split seconds time the
[1:45:50] cancer will vanish every disease will
[1:45:53] melt away in a split seconds time by the
[1:45:57] blast of his nostrils the Red Sea open
[1:46:00] up and they walk through on dry ground
[1:46:03] blast of his nostrils his god of the
[1:46:06] heavens and the universe and the Earth
[1:46:08] is only body's foot to that's the god
[1:46:11] that we serve that's the god that we
[1:46:13] serve he holds Heaven he holds Heaven
[1:46:16] time and seasons in his hand that's the
[1:46:18] god that we serve oh and he carth for
[1:46:22] you through Sunshine through Shadow he
[1:46:24] cares for you and I oh give him praise
[1:46:28] people give him praise Hallelujah
[1:46:31] glorify his name glorify his name glory
[1:46:35] glory to God he deserves all of our
[1:46:39] praise
[1:46:41] [Applause]
[1:46:49] amen the supernatural
[1:46:52] provision was to show them that through
[1:46:55] the tough and the difficult terrain of
[1:46:57] the Wilderness may be seated in the good
[1:47:00] times and in bad
[1:47:02] times and even when they eventually
[1:47:04] arrived in promised land that God so
[1:47:07] that they always know that God would
[1:47:11] always take better care of them than
[1:47:14] they could take care of
[1:47:17] themselves and was to let them to
[1:47:19] understand to to focus their minds on
[1:47:22] God so they can always look to him as
[1:47:24] their one true
[1:47:26] Source amen and to seek ye first the
[1:47:31] kingdom of God and its righteousness
[1:47:34] righteous living
[1:47:37] righteousness so
[1:47:40] notice his ultimate long-term plan was
[1:47:42] to bless them with
[1:47:43] abundance Jesus said I come that they
[1:47:45] might have life and have it more
[1:47:48] abundantly that's all God is abundant
[1:47:50] that's who God is amen
[1:47:55] amen of the increase of his kingdom
[1:47:58] there should be no end abundance just
[1:48:00] keeps on going on and on and on and on
[1:48:01] and on so God's ultimate plan long-term
[1:48:05] plan in his kingdom to his children was
[1:48:07] to bless them with
[1:48:08] abundance which is more than
[1:48:10] enough and that and that will only come
[1:48:13] through the work of their
[1:48:16] hands the abundance was hidden in the
[1:48:18] promised land amen and when they got in
[1:48:20] promised land that Bon will only come
[1:48:22] through the work of their
[1:48:24] hands his plan was not to keep providing
[1:48:27] for their needs by Supernatural means if
[1:48:30] he had done
[1:48:33] that they'll only become
[1:48:35] entitled spoiled immature kids spoiled
[1:48:40] Rich Kids spoiled Rich Kids the Rich
[1:48:43] Kids of
[1:48:44] Abuja Spa kids Rich Kids of Lagos Rich
[1:48:47] Kids of New York Rich Spa kids
[1:48:51] if he just kept providing for them
[1:48:52] supernaturally like that they will never
[1:48:55] learn anything they'll never be built up
[1:48:58] themselves on the inside to become
[1:49:00] people of value
[1:49:04] themselves even though they have all the
[1:49:06] thing thrown on their laps but those
[1:49:08] kids are in the wilderness because what
[1:49:10] they have it just spoils they just
[1:49:11] wasted just pails just doesn't last just
[1:49:15] just pause just pause and that's why you
[1:49:18] see you know generational well many
[1:49:20] times doesn't pass them down because
[1:49:24] those kids were not in the promised land
[1:49:28] they live there but they were not they
[1:49:30] not get built up to have the shoulders
[1:49:32] that will carry the weight of the
[1:49:34] kingdom in the promised land other
[1:49:37] Christians unbelievers it matters not
[1:49:39] and then once they they just they just
[1:49:43] go right back in the wilderness and all
[1:49:45] the resources just frer
[1:49:48] away what is it God doing that it's a
[1:49:51] principle of
[1:49:53] God it just pause warms just eat it up
[1:49:57] nobody still and just warms eat it
[1:50:02] up amen are you with
[1:50:10] me hope we are catching your lessons
[1:50:15] amen so God was not going to spoil his
[1:50:19] children
[1:50:21] no if he did throwing things at them
[1:50:24] like that they would never grow they
[1:50:27] only become entitled
[1:50:30] immature little
[1:50:32] babies just as is the same way God's
[1:50:36] plan for his church is not for you and I
[1:50:39] to live from Miracle to Miracle live
[1:50:42] from Supernatural provision Supernatural
[1:50:44] prion that's good but that's not his
[1:50:48] plan no he wants you and I to walk by
[1:50:52] faith to live by faith and not by
[1:51:03] sight what are you saying preacher I'm
[1:51:06] saying that God doesn't want you and I
[1:51:07] to live such that unless you see a
[1:51:09] miracle you will not
[1:51:17] believe I haven't I haven't even halfway
[1:51:20] here but uh let me let me just see here
[1:51:22] let me narrate to you brother Bam's
[1:51:27] experiences came with the ministry
[1:51:29] unlike any other since the time of the
[1:51:31] Apostles I mean since time of the
[1:51:34] Apostles and when was banking on the
[1:51:36] scene nothing like the FF bws were the
[1:51:39] Giants they they became like his his his
[1:51:44] protes his students because they saw the
[1:51:47] grace of God upon his
[1:51:48] life I'm and because the angel if you
[1:51:51] can get the people to believe you
[1:51:52] nothing will stand before you had the
[1:51:55] tenden to tell people when they go
[1:51:56] anywhere tell them like that bring me
[1:51:58] the hardest
[1:51:59] cases every every line I had was a
[1:52:01] miracle line not a healing line a
[1:52:04] miracle line you've got to see Miracle
[1:52:07] after Miracle after Miracle after not my
[1:52:09] watch brother's words
[1:52:13] himself so there was a
[1:52:16] day they brought him a girl who had no
[1:52:19] no eyeballs at all and he had prayed for
[1:52:23] many like that the eyeballs just came up
[1:52:24] come up like that I mean some like that
[1:52:27] so he he got this child he prayed prayed
[1:52:29] prayed nothing
[1:52:32] happened he prayed and prayed and prayed
[1:52:34] nothing happened 30 minutes praying and
[1:52:38] prayed again 45 minutes one eyeball
[1:52:40] popped into the
[1:52:43] eye second one he prayed and prayed not
[1:52:46] anyway at the end of the day the guy the
[1:52:49] the baby received eyeballs miracle
[1:52:51] miracle instant on the
[1:52:53] spot when he left the place the angel
[1:52:56] spoke to him and
[1:52:57] said you cannot keep going on like that
[1:53:00] come on
[1:53:01] brother because when you keep going on
[1:53:03] like that you will weaken the people's
[1:53:07] Faith their faith will become like until
[1:53:11] and see a miracle they will not believe
[1:53:15] me my Covenant with them is blessed he
[1:53:18] that believeth Hallelujah without
[1:53:20] sin I don't want them to live from
[1:53:23] Miracle to miracle and miracle I want
[1:53:25] them to just come sometimes come through
[1:53:27] the prayer line come to the healing line
[1:53:29] lay hands on them and let them go away
[1:53:32] believing that they'll be
[1:53:35] healed but the way you are managing them
[1:53:39] you'll get them to where unless they see
[1:53:41] a miracle they will not
[1:53:43] believe and God said I don't want my
[1:53:45] children to live like that a miracle
[1:53:47] Supernatural
[1:53:48] provision
[1:53:53] and brother Bram said the angel I'm so
[1:53:55] sorry Lord and then he still went on
[1:53:58] like
[1:53:59] that because bam doesn't want to hurt
[1:54:02] other people then in his meetings they
[1:54:04] call the brother's name will tell people
[1:54:06] like that those of you with testimonies
[1:54:08] of Miracles come and give a testimony
[1:54:09] and they'll come and give a testimony
[1:54:12] and then everybody is sitting in the in
[1:54:14] the front row because they're looking
[1:54:15] for a miracle
[1:54:17] themselves and the B was going on like
[1:54:19] that what the angel had told him not to
[1:54:20] do CU people they see Miracles but they
[1:54:23] don't have faith they are see because
[1:54:25] they see they are seeing the Miracles
[1:54:27] because they see if you see a miracle
[1:54:29] happen on the spot why won't you believe
[1:54:30] for
[1:54:33] yourself so one
[1:54:36] day 1947 this was early on his Min not
[1:54:39] not for years early on his ministry
[1:54:41] 1947 the M called the angel of God 2 of
[1:54:46] November
[1:54:47] 1947 a man was praying for a deaf mute
[1:54:51] for a deaf person and he prayed and said
[1:54:54] can you hear me the person didn't see
[1:54:55] anything can you hear me the person
[1:54:56] didn't see anything so a few people down
[1:54:59] the line said like that he stopped and
[1:55:00] said no brother bam open
[1:55:03] transparency then started giving this
[1:55:05] story that the Lord has been speaking to
[1:55:08] me that I should not do these things
[1:55:11] like that he said not have always a
[1:55:15] miracle line make it a healing line
[1:55:18] because he said in that sense that this
[1:55:19] Serv is his healing line not a miracle
[1:55:21] line so that the but he said some some
[1:55:24] Pastor brother will come and say and the
[1:55:26] people will come and all the miracle
[1:55:27] everybody's coming looking coming for
[1:55:29] looking for a miracle miracle miracle
[1:55:31] miracle miracle and so he prayed and
[1:55:35] somebody did not get
[1:55:36] healed somebody not get
[1:55:39] healed so bam prayed and said Lord I
[1:55:42] promise you from today no matter what
[1:55:43] anybody says I'll do what you tell me
[1:55:46] I'm not I'm not going to do it this way
[1:55:47] anymore Hallelujah I'm not going to do
[1:55:49] this anymore I'm going to let the people
[1:55:52] believe and they'll be healed I won't
[1:55:55] let their faith be upon until they see a
[1:55:57] miracle before they believe that's what
[1:55:59] God was trying to kill Israel off in the
[1:56:01] promised
[1:56:03] land and that's how where many of us
[1:56:05] still are only way we get our provision
[1:56:08] is Supernatural Supernatural let me not
[1:56:11] run ahead of myself I'll let you go
[1:56:12] shortly
[1:56:14] amen ready go
[1:56:16] shortly so what I'm saying here is that
[1:56:21] just like God did not want Israel to
[1:56:23] live from Miracle to Miracle because it
[1:56:24] will never grow they will never
[1:56:26] grow they will just become entitled you
[1:56:29] know Paul to Rich
[1:56:32] Kids amen same way he doesn't want his
[1:56:35] church to live so that unless they see a
[1:56:37] miracle they will not
[1:56:39] believe and
[1:56:43] so
[1:56:44] God made sure that when he go in the
[1:56:47] promised land he changed the order
[1:56:50] and that's why you can pray all you want
[1:56:52] to you can fast all you want to you can
[1:56:55] read all the motivational books all you
[1:56:57] want to believe with so much Faith as to
[1:56:59] move mountains all you want to without
[1:57:01] the work of your own hands you'll never
[1:57:04] come into abundance never
[1:57:11] ever you may have your basic needs met
[1:57:14] but you'll never come into abundance you
[1:57:15] just have enough you just have enough
[1:57:17] and that place of enough is Will is not
[1:57:19] a very good place to
[1:57:22] be amen but read through from Ephesians
[1:57:25] even them that still let him have it let
[1:57:27] him have for himself so that can also
[1:57:29] have enough to even give out to who
[1:57:31] needs not like a father Christmas to who
[1:57:34] needs that's
[1:57:40] abundance without the work of your own
[1:57:41] hands you'll forever grapple with and
[1:57:43] live in the land of not enough and the
[1:57:45] land of Never Enough Just Enough
[1:57:50] amen so in the promised land which was
[1:57:54] the fertile land of bible
[1:57:56] promises which is the fruit of milk and
[1:57:59] honey in due season God was going to
[1:58:02] bless the work of the
[1:58:04] hands and number two he was going to
[1:58:06] further unveil an additional element of
[1:58:09] how he miraculously provides in his
[1:58:12] kingdom by his laws of
[1:58:15] nature and the role that each one of
[1:58:18] them was to individually play this each
[1:58:20] one of us has a role to
[1:58:23] play I said this over and over and you
[1:58:26] know that already but let me just say it
[1:58:28] again all through the Bible three
[1:58:30] fundamental ways God God God God acts
[1:58:32] and provides number one he provides by
[1:58:34] Supernatural ways his signs wonders and
[1:58:36] miracles that's what Israel found out in
[1:58:38] the wilderness number two he provides by
[1:58:40] his laws of nature sewing and repping
[1:58:43] planting and harvesting which is what we
[1:58:45] are going to Boos to do in the promised
[1:58:47] land and number three by his Providence
[1:58:49] which is favor things you just cannot
[1:58:51] explain God just gets there and does it
[1:58:53] those are three ways that God works and
[1:58:55] operates through amen All Through the
[1:58:58] Bible now the the the promised land it
[1:59:01] was now he had showed them all through
[1:59:03] the Wilderness years his power to
[1:59:06] provide for them
[1:59:07] supernaturally by Supernatural water
[1:59:09] from the rock Mana from heaven and all
[1:59:11] that now I was going to show them the
[1:59:13] second part of how he provides in his
[1:59:15] kingdom by the laws of the Kingdom by
[1:59:18] the laws of his laws of nature amen that
[1:59:20] he himself put there planting and
[1:59:23] harvesting sowing and
[1:59:25] reaping amen the Bible said the promised
[1:59:28] land was
[1:59:30] ready and was FL with milk and honey it
[1:59:33] was ready means the land was fertile it
[1:59:35] was ready to receive seed and let it
[1:59:37] bring forth
[1:59:40] amen so Malachi 4 let's understand like
[1:59:45] when they go in the promised land they
[1:59:47] didn't see thean honey but the the milk
[1:59:49] and horny laid hidden in the land in the
[1:59:51] hills in the mountains under the Earth
[1:59:53] in the waters all over the land and the
[1:59:55] only way they will get at the milk and
[1:59:57] honey was by their own planting and
[1:59:59] harvesting their sewing and raping by
[2:00:01] the work of their hands
[2:00:04] amen so citizens of the kingdom of God
[2:00:08] Believers ask again what do you have in
[2:00:13] your
[2:00:14] hand whether it's small insignificant
[2:00:17] only Five Loaves only one barrel of meal
[2:00:20] meal one Cruise of oil what do you have
[2:00:23] in your hand whether it's a crooked

[2:04:44] okay God in wanting to bless the work of
[2:04:47] the hands God was introducing them
[2:04:50] to further and additional laws in his
[2:04:53] kingdom how the kingdom works by the
[2:04:55] laws of
[2:04:57] nature all through the Wilderness he has
[2:05:00] shown them time again that his kingom
[2:05:02] works by Supernatural and all that like
[2:05:04] we said over and over but now he wanted
[2:05:07] to let them know that the kingdom also
[2:05:09] works by the laws of nature and in there
[2:05:13] you're going to have abundance for
[2:05:16] yourself and that's where he led Israel
[2:05:19] understand the value of work work work
[2:05:24] work let me just take this I'll closed
[2:05:27] okay at 10 15 minutes I I close don't
[2:05:31] sleep stay aler no some I'm sleeping
[2:05:33] already so about don't
[2:05:36] sleep no some young men are not
[2:05:39] remaining right
[2:05:44] now work work so they feel like that so
[2:05:48] work what's that
[2:05:52] mean
[2:05:54] Adam had work in the Garden of Eden
[2:05:57] before the fall and Adam had walked in
[2:06:00] Eden after the fall after it was driven
[2:06:03] out of Eden he had
[2:06:05] walk Adam had to work even a perfect say
[2:06:08] he had to
[2:06:09] work before the fall the work that he
[2:06:12] did was to provide
[2:06:14] solution till the ground dress the
[2:06:17] garden name the animals because the
[2:06:18] Bible said there was no man found to
[2:06:20] teal the
[2:06:22] ground it was so to speak quote and
[2:06:24] unquote a problem that God was looking
[2:06:27] for somebody to hire to serve it and he
[2:06:29] couldn't find one person to hire so God
[2:06:33] the Creator went to work and created the
[2:06:37] hire he
[2:06:39] needed which was Adam so Adam was
[2:06:43] here to work and his work was to provide
[2:06:46] a solution for God look at the clientele
[2:06:51] that Adam had god
[2:06:58] wow Adam's work before the fall was to
[2:07:02] provide Solutions because Genesis 27 God
[2:07:05] made man and bring to him and Man became
[2:07:08] a living soul and God put the man he had
[2:07:10] made in the Garden of Eden and God told
[2:07:12] him of all the trees in the G you may
[2:07:14] eat but hise of may not eat and God told
[2:07:17] him that to put him in the Garden of
[2:07:18] Eden to dress it and to keep it and then
[2:07:21] God brought all the man in man to him to
[2:07:23] name them but for Adam there was not
[2:07:25] found a help meate for him before Eve
[2:07:30] work and like you know we said over and
[2:07:32] over Adam he want to get I mean marriage
[2:07:34] Eve but no marriage because talking with
[2:07:37] a young man oh let me leave that alone
[2:07:39] okay let me
[2:07:40] leave each in
[2:07:42] ears 18
[2:07:47] years
[2:07:51] let me just say it let me just say
[2:07:53] it CU I heard some some that in Legos
[2:07:56] Church they never marry and all that
[2:07:57] stuff they never let them marry and all
[2:07:58] that I I don't have a problem with that
[2:08:00] I don't have a problem with that but you
[2:08:02] know and forgive me forgive me church
[2:08:04] just like when I went to Europe the
[2:08:05] other other time and the brother is
[2:08:07] trying to tell me I mean tell me like
[2:08:09] that what you do say in your church it's
[2:08:11] about call your great to scr me on how
[2:08:14] to take care of the sheep of God under
[2:08:15] my care and don't you ever don't you
[2:08:17] ever try that again don't you ever do
[2:08:21] that
[2:08:23] again I'm not a public person and I
[2:08:26] don't none of us should be I mean I
[2:08:28] don't mean public in public I don't mean
[2:08:30] like show off type type of person
[2:08:34] whatever but what I do is for for say if
[2:08:38] you're not part of this church not not
[2:08:40] of your business none of your
[2:08:42] business but say the young man that
[2:08:45] other people do their things the way
[2:08:46] they feel and I don't get into it
[2:08:49] but why judge
[2:08:52] me I said but in Legos you're not going
[2:08:54] to marry if you don't have a a s of
[2:08:57] income and don't have your own
[2:08:59] house I don't mean a mansion you can be
[2:09:02] under a tree but it's not going to be in
[2:09:04] your daddy and your mommy's
[2:09:07] house other cultures I know like I was
[2:09:10] in India India when they get married
[2:09:11] they that their culture I'm not talking
[2:09:13] about that I'm talking but that's not
[2:09:14] the culture
[2:09:16] here and I don't mean you must get a
[2:09:19] mansion if I was getting married today I
[2:09:21] will not leave my daddy's house I will
[2:09:24] go from my daddy's house in the morning
[2:09:26] to Mar marry and I'll go to my house in
[2:09:28] the night why would I want to miss my
[2:09:30] mommy's meal
[2:09:31] for why so I am not saying you must have
[2:09:35] a I'm saying like that for this cause
[2:09:37] shall a man leave his father and mother
[2:09:40] let's do that
[2:09:42] first and Cliff to his wife because she
[2:09:44] has to leave in many cultures is a taboo
[2:09:48] for you you to marry and go and live in
[2:09:50] your with your father and father-in-law
[2:09:54] in their
[2:09:58] home and I said but other place I see
[2:10:00] them once the boys are ready to marry
[2:10:02] they get to marri and many of those boys
[2:10:04] have funded their marriages and they
[2:10:06] have no job no work and they marry and I
[2:10:10] don't complain about that I don't I
[2:10:11] don't criticize what they do that's the
[2:10:13] man's Revelation why what I do if you if
[2:10:15] you're you got to you got to have a
[2:10:16] decent job I'm not saying you must have
[2:10:18] all the money in the world you must let
[2:10:20] me see what you must if it's 100 n you
[2:10:22] earing a month you got to be able to
[2:10:24] manage it so that you'll be able to take
[2:10:26] care of that
[2:10:28] girl cuz once you marry 9 months time a
[2:10:31] baby
[2:10:33] comes and like I said
[2:10:35] repeatedly
[2:10:37] worldwide the number one cause of
[2:10:40] marital stress number one is
[2:10:43] immorality worldwide and unfortunately
[2:10:46] Christians are caught up in that too
[2:10:48] unfortunately messy people are CAU up
[2:10:50] unfortunately people inside here are
[2:10:51] caugh up with that too let's get real
[2:10:53] let's not fool
[2:10:55] ourselves number two number two CA of
[2:10:58] marriage marital stresses is financial
[2:11:04] troubles financial
[2:11:06] troubles so I'm not going to set up my
[2:11:09] children for that I'm not saying you
[2:11:10] must have all the money in the world no
[2:11:12] you must have the responsibility and
[2:11:14] that's what God did if your daddy is
[2:11:16] good enough Rich enough to get to your
[2:11:17] house he had better do it if he if he
[2:11:20] and that's why I believe parents can
[2:11:21] help the children to set up to set off
[2:11:22] in life your daddy can rent the house
[2:11:25] for you he can you had better do it but
[2:11:28] like I said I let Daddy Daddy the rent
[2:11:29] starts the day I leave your house on my
[2:11:31] married date on my on my on my on my the
[2:11:34] day I get married so I can stretch the
[2:11:36] money I can stretch the
[2:11:43] rent and number two because God gave
[2:11:46] adam a beautiful Garden of Eden
[2:11:49] and nextly he gave him a
[2:11:51] job once he gave me a job gave him a
[2:11:54] house marriage could
[2:11:57] come he wasn't see with God up in heaven
[2:12:00] no God was visiting him in his house
[2:12:01] that he get his
[2:12:03] son you can say I'm spiritualizing you
[2:12:05] can see I'm sping that's my
[2:12:08] [Applause]
[2:12:09] Revelation if it takes you time to get
[2:12:12] the house together what has he got why
[2:12:14] why why blame me for it right
[2:12:19] all
[2:12:21] [Music]

[2:12:25] I'm not I'm I'm forgive me I said 10

[2:13:25] but they remember marital
[2:13:27] stress Lord have
[2:13:31] mercy
[2:13:33] that's loss for money loss for women
[2:13:36] loss of popularity this a DE to the
[2:13:37] believer and we all say I said it's not
[2:13:39] true it's not true so marital stress no
[2:13:43] no we don't care about those things no
[2:13:44] we care that's why that's the only thing
[2:13:46] you remembered you remember anything

[2:14:38] Hing ears will not you know so you can
[2:14:41] you can listen God has something to say
[2:14:42] listen listen pay close attention so let

[2:14:49] so God anyway
[2:14:51] um he he
[2:14:54] found um the man he didn't find the man
[2:14:57] but he created the man for the position
[2:14:59] amen and so Adam you know had a job and
[2:15:02] Adam's work Adam's work work work work
[2:15:05] work I talk about meaningful work all
[2:15:07] the time he can work but is a work
[2:15:08] meaningful is work value value
[2:15:12] driven Bible Bible I showare from the
[2:15:15] Bible that's why I'm taking my time on
[2:15:16] this here I mean I'm not not today
[2:15:18] through the series and I'm not in a rush
[2:15:20] to finish it but I'll try and finish
[2:15:22] before the year runs out so
[2:15:25] Adam uh uh um had to work before the
[2:15:28] fall the work that he did was to provide
[2:15:31] Solutions which forgot and that's look
[2:15:34] at his the quality of his clientele God
[2:15:36] was the one that hired him to do work
[2:15:39] for
[2:15:39] him and in providing
[2:15:42] Solutions um in providing solutions for
[2:15:47] God God wanted somebody to te the ground
[2:15:50] to dress the garden to name the
[2:15:53] animals um in providing Solutions Adam
[2:15:55] validated his own position as a Creator
[2:15:59] as a little Creator under God his father
[2:16:03] who was the creator of the
[2:16:04] universe so before the fall Adam's work
[2:16:07] was this here was about all about
[2:16:09] providing solutions for God for his
[2:16:12] clientele and was his work was wrapped
[2:16:14] around wisdom and
[2:16:16] creativity
[2:16:18] you know these days everybody talk about
[2:16:20] you know startup startups and like
[2:16:22] everybody wants to a startup and they
[2:16:23] don't even know what it takes to
[2:16:27] Startup I don't want to work
[2:16:32] spiritual the very idea of a startup you
[2:16:34] have
[2:16:35] Innovation the stock market calls
[2:16:38] Innovation God calls it wisdom and
[2:16:43] creativity the stock market just at
[2:16:45] wisdom and creativity and a market plan
[2:16:48] and they call it Innovation the
[2:16:50] innovators that's what it is just wisdom
[2:16:53] and creativity that's what Adam had or
[2:16:56] how could he have how was he could he
[2:16:58] have named the animals who taught him
[2:17:00] how to take care of the garden and keep
[2:17:02] it in good shape good order wisdom who
[2:17:05] told him to to coin the names for the
[2:17:10] animals wisdom he was creative a Creator
[2:17:14] like God himself and in naming the
[2:17:17] animals he placed them in their orders
[2:17:19] like the the the I forgot all those
[2:17:22] things but the zoo whatever the
[2:17:24] different orders and all that the
[2:17:25] mammals and the whatever their orders in
[2:17:29] giving them the
[2:17:30] names the wisdom the creativity to do
[2:17:33] that he showed he was a Creator
[2:17:36] himself amen that's the quality of work
[2:17:40] that Adam did in the Garden of
[2:17:45] Eden his work definitely required effort
[2:17:47] effort see it was work work requires
[2:17:49] effort but it was productive
[2:17:52] work it solved the problem that God
[2:17:55] had to teal the ground to name the
[2:17:58] animals to do the things that was
[2:18:00] lacking in the garden it was fruitful
[2:18:02] work be
[2:18:04] fruitful you know many times when we he
[2:18:07] in the Bible Genesis 12628 be fruitful

[2:18:14] still too far from it I don't want to
[2:18:15] keep you too long I know I'm boring to

[2:19:35] [Applause]
[2:19:42] amen
[2:19:45] amen let's close out here
[2:19:49] so Kingdom work Kingdom work work work
[2:19:51] Kingdom work as Adam
[2:19:54] demonstrated must be fruitful in other
[2:19:57] words must be productive might be
[2:19:59] fruitful work we'll get into it in some
[2:20:02] detail and to be productive and
[2:20:05] fruitful it must be tailored to solving
[2:20:09] problems like Adam s for God the bigger
[2:20:12] the problem the more complex the
[2:20:16] better
[2:20:19] to be fruitful and productive solving
[2:20:23] increasingly bigger and more complex
[2:20:25] problems it must be done with wisdom and
[2:20:28] [Music]
[2:20:30] creativity in other words the more
[2:20:33] creativity and wisdom you bring to bear
[2:20:36] and apply to your work the more
[2:20:39] productive your work will
[2:20:43] be power power to be creative
[2:20:48] and when you're creative it creates
[2:20:50] wealth you create value you create the
[2:20:53] gold for
[2:20:55] people power to create
[2:20:58] wealth so Kingdom walk let me recap is
[2:21:02] solution
[2:21:03] providing is
[2:21:05] productive is
[2:21:07] creative and is waved around
[2:21:10] wisdom amen wisdom have builded her
[2:21:14] house has he out a seven
[2:21:18] peers
[2:21:20] amen
[2:21:21] amen
[2:21:23] glory amen so Adam's work Adam's walk
[2:21:28] was the
[2:21:29] pathway by which he demonstrated his
[2:21:31] dominion over everything on the earth
[2:21:34] fruitful multiply sub replenish subdue
[2:21:39] dominate The Avenue through which he did
[2:21:41] that was the work that he
[2:21:43] did his work was tied to his purpose for
[2:21:47] for
[2:21:51] being let us make mine our image and let
[2:21:54] them have dominion over the land and the
[2:21:55] Sea and all that stuff but his work was
[2:21:57] going to bring out that Dominion was
[2:21:59] going to bring out that fruitfulness was
[2:22:00] going to bring out that uh uh uh
[2:22:03] multiplication are you following me all
[2:22:06] right it's so
[2:22:08] simple in other words by the work that
[2:22:11] Adam did before the fall that was how he
[2:22:13] was able to demonstrate the
[2:22:16] potential that the talent that God plac
[2:22:18] in
[2:22:19] him to
[2:22:22] dominate the potential was there the
[2:22:24] talent was there but work is what
[2:22:26] brought it out work is what brought it
[2:22:28] out and I always tell you that Talent is
[2:22:30] nothing you can have genius level Talent
[2:22:34] without work it means
[2:22:36] nothing that's why they tell you that
[2:22:38] genius is 99% sweat you are gifted a
[2:22:42] baby is gifted you can have a genius
[2:22:44] baby who is gifted to be the greatest
[2:22:45] soccer star in the world to make all the
[2:22:48] money for all their Village in
[2:22:50] Nigeria but can you put that baby on the
[2:22:52] soccer field even though he's gifted
[2:22:55] supernaturally from God
[2:22:57] no work is what's going to bring out
[2:23:00] that gift going to bring out that
[2:23:02] potential that's where your talent's
[2:23:10] [Applause]
[2:23:11] coming I'm not sure you're following
[2:23:16] me
[2:23:18] going to help
[2:23:25] us Genesis
[2:23:28] 1:26 let us make man in our own image
[2:23:31] and let them have dominion over
[2:23:32] everything on the face of the earth I
[2:23:33] always show you that's potential that's
[2:23:36] talent and God put that in every single
[2:23:40] man yours may be one Talent mine may be
[2:23:43] two another might be five but every man
[2:23:47] because the Bible say to every one of us
[2:23:49] he giveth the talent every
[2:23:51] man every
[2:23:54] man that's potential and God now goes to
[2:23:58] verse 28 to explain how that potential
[2:24:00] comes out
[2:24:03] fruitful replenish I mean multiply
[2:24:05] replenish subd
[2:24:09] dominate so you have
[2:24:11] potential Adam has been told you going
[2:24:13] to dominate but how did he do it good
[2:24:17] put him in Eden and walk is what pulled
[2:24:20] it out of
[2:24:22] him your
[2:24:24] talent is not the same as your
[2:24:27] skills
[2:24:29] no
[2:24:32] no it's not because you have talent that
[2:24:34] you are chrisan Christian Christiano

[2:24:46] your skills
[2:24:48] when you when you hone your talent do

[2:24:53] practicing work practice labor they say
[2:24:56] practice makes perfect no practice makes
[2:24:59] permanent you are practicing laboring

[2:25:04] tent holding that Talent it turns into a
