spirit not not Norma spirit Holy Spirit Alleluia or glory the God so this morning why don't you Steve [Music] silhouette of Jesus when you get a burden for your own soul and who put it upon the minister or the pasta and you get desperate to know if you have to meet God's requirement to make it over to the other side the past and I've given you a ticket no I've given you a ticket to go on crossover you gotta cross yourself you gotta face it yourself I may be seated God bless you and welcome to this time and the presence of the Lord and singing that song Steve away I guess most of you was afraid about it - angèle sadder she was still quick say the worst one in 20 years 6.4 and I think it was 7.1 and I'm thinking about it good quick we have in here we have enough a spiritual retreat praise God nothing is my chance now oh yes what if your son is going down this week it changes everything yeah you'd realize how real this messages what this prophet in the spirit realm went up and saw and where we supposed to be for such a time as this what kind of condition we supposed to be him as the time begins to unfold and we see the Bible talk about the beginning of Sorrows it's important that we see this but we want to tank she say yochabel for that song I'll rise again talk about agree and also from two extras looking away to Jesus I'm looking but if you've got blessing my brothers we certainly appreciate that email this morning we have precious but a solemn and Aegina from Ghana I'm gonna stick you this morning and you know many times people think being a leader you have to have a title a post a position but it's not really so I want to show you that you are called to lead you here this morning you you the people leading is the behavior its attitude oh praise the name of the Lord the bird man says a minister now a minister cannot being a revival there is no preacher can being a revival he doesn't pack it with him the only thing he can do is to be loyal to God and with his word and the revival has to come by the people in your home in your life revival isn't adding new members to the church is reviving what we have already got so when the church get in a rut we need a revival it doesn't have new but it changes and under what is already dear or glory to God and then he said isn't it strange that God would want the people to have patented it when Jesus looked out into the harvest he said the harvest is ripe the laborers are few you pray the lord of the harvest that was him you pray to me that I will send laborers into my harvest it is some part you have to do God is waiting for his church to call on him so you say you written on God and go reason anew it's just to call on him he always did it God is waiting today for the people to call his servant into action so you hold a key every prayer every praise every right life and attitude there's a part in this glorious program that get caught servants interaction listen to this he said God is waiting for the people to call his civil interaction and the servant can't get into action till the people please o blessed be the name of the law we believe that then he said what we see happen should put every soul in action it should make a church that will make a revival he ain Phoenix that people will be flying from Europe to see what taken place they were saying as a place in Arizona called Maricopa Valley a city called Phoenix there is something broke out there until the seven thunders of Revelation 10 that are not even written in the Bible is being manifested so there's a prophecy hanging over you for a manifestation of God Oh glory to God that there be a genuine witness that he is raised from the dead Oh hallelujah oh we appreciate that service last night by the daily

him I'm nitrile guardian from me ro ma freakin next to me hallelujah so suddenly we've been here my wife and I we are back again and this time we had to come early and thank you very much by the Raymond that's our host but everyone is wife sister Wendy and her family and the millions such a wonderful you know group down there emiru we had to go by date you know they had to console me not to miss home so much so they took me to the Atlantic Ocean so that I could have a feel of whom I said Organa is just beyond the other side I wish I could just move on hallelujah but what a time we have in Trinidad what can we say about yesterday the presence of the Lord the love of God the sweet fellowship of the bread tree this is what a prophet came for there's going to be a bride and there is a bride that was prophecy but this is the manifestation of what the Prophet SAW from different nations we don't come from Trinidad I don't come from Ghana Radha we came from Elohim and we are going back to Elohim we are just packing up we are in Trinidad this weekend to pack up backups on faith pack up some love part of some dynamics because that's our promise to get back to our maker o blessed be the name of a living God and is so happy to see the unity of the faith in Trinidad good to see the different ones all here in one one mind one Accord I was telling him that Avondale last night I said we see you on the TV you know we watch him with the today's of those singing group and we're gonna enjoy but to see the man and shake his hand is a blessing and one of these days we are all gonna be never to party anymore water fellowship my precious brother my precious sister there's no gonna be no group there is going to be one sweet spirit hallelujah sister hope to the Prophet this is what you preach this is the Holy Ghost soon and very soon we make so but once we are here we are now different locations we are defending the gospel we are defending the message we are keeping the devil away because there is a bride there is a bright body and we are sure part of that body this morning remain so I wanna salute on behalf of the church and my family and my wife will salute but the whole village the church and all the offices and the local church here god bless you and thank you for having us I'm gonna salute all the ministers that has gone before me brother Chandler and relatively and all those that will come after me and those that I hear this morning with their churches I'm certainly not ready to be here by just following on my lot to be here amen so to shoot the messenger now hallelujah I'm just here as a messenger of the Lord to bring you a message our main is that if you have a problem meet the one who sent the message but I trust this morning we are gonna enjoy ourselves so as we stand to our feet this morning shall we go straight to the word much each of the 13 read verse 30 39 42 41 you know Jesus talking about the parable of the sower like into the kingdom of God rest a t-cell let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles and bend them but gather the wheat into my barn verse 39 the enemy that sowed them is the devil but the one that stood the test now is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the Reapers are the Angels amen verse 40 and I was there for the tests are carried and been in the fire so shall it be in the end of this well the Son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them that which do iniquity Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 and to that to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted made a lord are a blessing to the ring of his word you may please be seated a man I trust us you see give him praise we are here to worship Him he's the only one that deserves our praise and worship so this morning for a title the manifestation is the interpretation hallelujah what is in the ground let it come to the manifestation then it will give itself the interpretation my subject is at the appointed time and obviously the inspiration the harvest time hallelujah so the Prophet said this morning and I want to read from blasphemous names he said now coming from the Holy Spirit what is coming then he will give you supernatural faith amen spiritual faith that here at the bottom then that's spiritual faith recognizes only the word no matter what anybody says it don't do no good hallelujah the manifestation will only recognize the word which would be the interpretation it's not going to be theory is what the way it's said but at where has an appointed time to be manifested it has an appointed time to be vindicated and you cannot let that word come at the time that it is not appointed is that Abraham I will visit you according to the time of life and Sarah your wife will have a son now there had to be a time of life no matter how you know Abraham was in a hurry to have that sound they had to come that appointed time that appointed season for Sarah to get in that condition to receive that child hallelujah Abraham was a man of faith but the appointed time had to come and it was according to God's own time Abraham couldn't push it for it to go here to contain 25 years on the promise it shall be it shall be I'm gonna have a son why God said so hallelujah hallelujah they opposition had to come the critics had to come but God hath spoken it and Abraham received a spiritual faith he wasn't looking at the circumstance of Sarah and this bride receives a promise hallelujah that is coming for a bride that bride is going to come for nothing will stop her hallelujah she is called she is predestinated she sought aim to comfort hallelujah but that bride cannot comfort until the appointed time but thank God this is the appointed time because we have gone through the denominational period hallelujah you may be seated but the problem said Amen there were three groups that were planted and when you plant you are looking for the harvest there are interested in the crop how beautiful the green crop is your focus is at the end what you are going to read from that crop hallelujah so three groups were planted when Abraham said Oral Roberts King he meant I with me this morning on a robe SK tear laws won't came the Prophet came and they all planted and the Prophet that you wonder why you don't hear about Bill agree how many more you wonder why I don't hear about Oral Roberts anymore is that an evil mind is the deadest of them all but it was gone into the ground it not being planted for a manifestation for a manifestation today you see the denominations are growing Indian numbers and numbers and numbers why it is a harvest time because a denominational seed was sold and now they are repeating numbers they were interested in the numbers they have the numbers but brothers coming for the price and that probably a minority but up prior with her power that Brad wah power power from the Holy Ghost not powerful groups not power from denomination but power of the resurrected Christ but in the life of man again all these signs shall follow them that believe the science follow the believer may be seated to the professor they were planted denominational C's were planted true bill agree humming or aerobics so we see people you know coming into the Machine like they used to know the seeds have been planted and the Prophet that bride will be in a minority because she'll be the Wed only hallelujah because she's gonna take back one her husband ease and her husband is the word she knows no man-made creep hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of a living God and the Bible said and his bride has made herself what ready his wife Christ wife nor a man's wife Christ why and I'm looking at the wife of price today Oh glory be to the Living God some from Ghana some from Nigeria some from Trinidad what are we do we'll make it ourselves ready for that bridegroom Oh glory be to the Living God so the prophet left the word in there hallelujah and he said he left the promise that the seven thunders will gather the bride and by roving read this morning about how people were planning to see it manifesting but there has to be a Kathryn first hallelujah that is our seat because after the prophets finished with the Pentecostals he still had two pretty kinds of believers amen three kinds of believers that was coming three kinds of believers I left Pentecost bolita prophet but three kinds of believers but in death as believer let's make believe up the unbeliever but the promise is to the believer that promise of the resurrection of Jesus Christ is to the believer Alleluia and the Prophet loved the promise the wait till them seven thunders so there's a waiting for an appointed time for these seven thunders to author their voices to that group there's a special Group the pride group the pride group the elected group the chosen group the odain group the predestinated group that group that knows no man's free wait till them seven thunders and what is that unless Christ Himself the cup stole the headstone and he's coming for the harvest the harvest of the bride that I've waited long enough or to get that hot July son ha July son you might have wanted it in January but it's not time hallelujah you murabba wonder it in April but it wasn't time Oh glory to God that relies on her to count and when he came it was time for the harvest is that come on call up the Reapers let him put the sickle in before the enemy can do more damage and we are promised that is dynamics to our mechanics so all that we receive was mechanics hallelujah the Busan teams were mechanics but brother in the mechanical church members they were unbelievers they were big believers brother but the heavens had to come to separate a shock to separate a big believer to separate the unbeliever and to leave that bride alone because the Prophet said that bride has the material on the edge or to overcome that bride has a material on the earth to make it to perfection that bride has the material right now Oh glory be to the Living God to bring for the manifestation of the Holy Spirit that is why we are shouting we are not shouting because we are funny we are shouting because we know we have a revelation that our word is unfolded that our word is unveiled that God is unveiled in the word Oh here imprison small [Music] hallelujah hallelujah but a problem restore the Son of man reveal the son of man hallelujah and the Pharisees came tempting Jesus is a wench on this the kingdom of God come Jesus - let me comment on with observation you know when they churches 1,000 people then the kingdom is coming hallelujah I said they would tell you though here this is the man of the hour I said no don't listen to that hallelujah this is in a secret place thank you for I'm protecting the password hallelujah I'm had a man I like a man that and protects himself you have nothing to hide I want you lock key down man there's some secret thing going on there hallelujah he said in the secret place I don't go there because the kingdom of God is within you that son of mine has been revealed it's within you now Andrew Brown revealed the son of man as promises only to the bride the Prophet had to come be seated and tie up the loose ends of the entire Bible because the word will judge the world so judgment warning has to come before judgment so the Pentecostal need to know the restore the full restored word to reject it and they can be jacked by that word the unbeliever has to see and know that the wear has been fully restored to reject it and then be jacked by that way so God sent the Prophet to tie up every loose end so metal this house do excuse Catholic has no excuse the Pope has these books he has to excuse hallelujah but that was in their promise the promise was for the bride so after tying up the loose ends he then released the Son of Man as promises hallelujah and Peter said by these promises you become partakers of the divine nature of God and find a child divine me that you have nothing to do with it Mary had nothing to do with it be done to me according to your word I have nothing to do with it no man has nothing to do with the divine nature of God the problem revealing us promises and on the horizon the god is obligated come on now bring back to do this more God is obligated at the appointed time to watch you suffer - what you get confused though he is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises hallelujah hallelujah on the basis of the promises and the profit outside of those promises you have catch yourself off Oh glory be to the Living God that is why when I really say the seven thunders shall gather the bride I'm looking wherever the bride is got it I know that seven thunders is being manifested that is the manifestation of the prophets prophesy because he spoke it but the thunders who got her the bride the thunders will show her how to prepare how to escape the judgment how to escape false Christ how to escape false anointed ooh that candles will show that right how to prepare oh and we

at the appointed time dynamics at the appointed time or the Holy Ghost itself at the appointed time when God is ready to let me go there he will send it and the prophet of God will send a power to the church God will send the power to the church at the appointed time power is coming watch the tech Gordon Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah but Abraham said and Noah did not he said I'm only building I'm only building he said that our is close at hand where you are going to see something happen something happened in the bride something happened in the believer or Peter did he know that something was coming so when the dual Pentagon was fully cop he was walking by the gate called beautiful and here was a beggar man give me some change he says silver and gold I don't have but something happened something happened Jesus spoke about it he said you will do with power but the power is here and such as I have I give to you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up come on get up it doesn't look it doesn't look possible but I say get up or glory to God and today he's speaking to you it doesn't look possible but something is gonna take place that was prophecy but we are here as a manifestation that that word cannot fail or glory be to the Living God glory be to the Living God when something is going to take place and all this background here has only been laying a foundation for a short quick message that will shake the whole nation that was the whole nation he was talking about you or glory to God and your praise the Word of God is the power that is shaking this our Los Angeles is going down by your praise by your worship by your holding on because that is prophecy and brother we are saying even so come Lord Jesus it's gonna go down hallelujah because there's a people there's a people as capito completely but bronzed at the church the real believer is looking for the manifestation of the Holy Spirit something in the heart is moving hallelujah the devil tells you is not for you see that you are alive the mini Center opens his mouth doesn't like coming out you don't even need to pay attention to the devil hallelujah o blessed be the name of a living God you may be seated Amen a spoken word is the original C vertebra hamza remember the Bible said in Genesis Amen that every seed of the east kind a to bring forth after its kind that's right every seat will have to bring remember the F is full of seeds the rain makes it bring forth after each time hallelujah back home when the grains and the harvest and you know everything is dry and they set fire wait to rain comes next even though fire has gone through but some seeds waiting for the rain once the rain drops you see them shooting up hallelujah so the ring where the problems that the former rain has come is that a Pentecost Pentecost felt our they had the formal remembrance that they never had the former ring but the former rain couldn't come without the messenger so until palabra Homme stepped on the scene no formal ring for us at the formal rain is a teaching rain but after the teacher read has another ring to come Oh glory to God so we are not just paying with the former rain I mean the message former rain tribulation specialist formal rain no we are not staying there is that let us move to perfection he said on to your mechanics odd dynamics and he is the dynamics the latter ring must stamp and the prophet that we are going to have to we're gonna have poof the former and the latter rain together Oh glory we are gonna have the revelation path and the manifestation paths the two will be together because dynamics with other mechanics no good mechanics with other dynamics no good hallelujah so the provident believe each other by the fundamentalism of the word the word the word new spirit hallelujah and the Pentecostal spirit know where the prophecy like a man having money and can sign the check and somebody can send a check no money the Raza bring the two together while you bring the two together than something can take place Oh glory to God we'll need the dynamics will meet the dynamics we have the mechanics we have the mechanics we can explain the mechanics of it but where is the power but our gospel is not in word only but is in power oh and demonstration of the holy spirit is in power power to overcome power to stand and believe power to say God said so I am standing there like Abraham I'm not gonna let go brother I am holy dog until my change come that's the gospel today Oh hallelujah bronze I remember the F is full of seeds and the rain may see bring forth after its kind I believe we are near the harvest time don't you believe it brother you all agree with that we are near the harvest time now the seeds has been planted thus what is with the matter the sees has been planted Oh God I wish I could he said I wish we could see what passed before me damn right there a vision broke about the bride about the harvest oh brother I wish you could see what just passed now we are living in what he saw we are living in what he saw he saw a bride already predestinated for a manifestation of dynamics hallelujah ooh repeat to the Living God amen hallelujah is that a man the seed has been planted remember there is a planting time then a harvest time thank you for the inspiration couldn't come any better time than now we are declaring it we are in the harvest time the sea is in the devil cannot take any more seal waiting for the takeoff they know amen where was that this is that remember there's a plant in time then a harvest time they know they said sue who knew you knew God said sue now there has been three different kinds of seeds planted and I just talked about it Billy Graham Oral Roberts and the rest of them he said and the word has been planted the word Rachael word and God will not bring that wedding the wound overhaul it's gonna come to revision hallelujah amen so he said we should not be unequally yoked with the world young people this our service right young people these are service hallelujah God will not bring this word in the womb of a home he's gonna bring it in the womb of a veggie that knows no other thing than the word because this word was given to the children for their defense get out of that way you are not defending anymore there's no pillow fire over you anymore the angels don't come around you anymore you must fortify hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of a living God so program said Amen oh let me skip on hallelujah oh you'll love him this morning Alleluia glory be to the name of a living God now listen here pilgrims in the seat of discrepancy he said now notice as ever as soon as Jesus went away went into heaven the holy spirit was sent back that was the seat the life giver onto the so the Holy Ghost comes on the seat to give it life hallelujah without the holy goose mechanics we understand these things we read we understand we can explain them intellectually but it takes the Holy Spirit they take the dynamics it takes the life giver onto the word as we spoke last night amen it is the one that quickens the word creaking means to bring to life the genuine Holy Spirit only brings to light the word that it is it will bring a crit to life it can't amen because it is nothing of the cream it is the life of the Word of God for it it's thought and it quickens that body Oh glory to God the Holy Spirit only brings quickening power to the word and that word is well where is that word on books and tapes though the word is in the bride that where is in the bride and the prophet and upright know what to do with that word either instant they said no man can make them do otherwise if it is not the word goodbye if it is not the word bye-bye hallelujah if it is not the word I don't want to see it see no evil hear no evil think no evil Oh bye you have to read in between the line well glory it wasn't the church was not built on reading in between the line upon this rock I will build my church on Revelation the revelation of a check no the revelation of Jesus Christ the same yesterday the same today the same forever he never fails he never changes and that quick name power only comes upon that word so the Prophet therefore they can be nothing shut do we not a shadowy we're not looking with it with some less it is as it is it interprets itself a very shall conceive now a virgin conceived and brought for Christ Berman said I don't need no interpretation his sporty Mary brought forth that was the manifestation of their interpretation of Isaiah's prophecy Rams are nothing shadowy just a genuine unadulterated Word of God that is sons and daughters of God who is not born by the will of man or by shaking of hand or some form of baptism but born of the Spirit of God by the Holy Spirit and the word manifested itself through them that is the genuine seed of God that is what goes into the harvest that the Holy Ghost can work through work through work true manifests in the word of the Living God that is the seed of God Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen now listen a program continues in the city of discrepancy amen he said but the finally came forth until proof is that by the finally came forth until both of two seeds the seed of discrepancy and the seed of God they put forth their genuine heads amen that wound up in Judas Iscariot and in Jesus Christ for he was the son of God Christ now he was the beginning of the creation of God he was nothing less than God and Judas Iscariot's was born the son of perdition came from hell return back to hell the truth harvest time our scripture let both grow together at the harvest time at the showdown the manifestation will be the interpretation that harvest time man but Abraham said amen Judas in his discrepancy was the seed of devil come to the well for deceit my preaching to somebody is born hallelujah Judas had a peppers Judas had a commission Jesus had a commission to you both seats so in the heart of men hallelujah also don't worry about what is going on in the message the elect will come to the hedge - nothing will stop the elect no matter how downtrodden how rejected how cut away they will come to the edge - called the up predestinated - it hallelujah Judas in his discrepancy was the seed of the table come to the world for this seat just like he was at the beginning Cain his former father Judas only play Church Judas knew how to clap and sing and dance and do all this which was though experienced with the Holy Ghost rather he wasn't really sincere he didn't actually have faith he have if he had Hyrum never betrayed Jesus but see he sowed the seed of discrepancy he thought he could make friends with the world when there's no believer I can wear some pants fit in he thought he could make friends with the world maman and have fellowship with Jesus but it was too late for him to do anything about it when the death hour came when he did this evil thing he crossed a separation line between going forward and retaining back glory this is real there was a rupture your fate is on the tapes all that you need to make heaven is here all that you need together Holy Ghost is here when the dead hour came when he did this evil thing he crossed the separation line between going forward and returning back he had to go on in the way that he went as a deceiver he sowed the seed of discrepancy he tried to find favor with those great big organizations of the day with the Pharisees and Sadducees and thought he would make himself some piece of money he will popular among the people if he doesn't if he doesn't consume any people to get in that discrepancy trying to find a fever with man let's find favor with God this morning let me find fever with God not with man but that was what Judas done when this discrepancy headed up in him and we know that Jesus was the word since John one said in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us then the way it is a seed then the seed become flesh and dwelt among us if G if Judas was the seed of the enemy and discrepancy it also became flesh and dwelt among us in the person of Judas Iscariot the prophet s spirits don't die so they asked Jesus when will the kingdom come Jesus told them as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed remember before then they will tell you here don't go for cementing to follow I mean then the word is a seed then they will become flesh and blood among as Christ now if Judas was the seed of the enemy or I mean the seed of the enemy and the discrepancy it also became flesh and dwelt among us in the person of Jesus Judas Iscariot he never had no real fate Judas had no faith he had a make-believe fake man brother he had he thought he had faith there is no such a thing as having freed in a big belief faith one leg in church one leg in the world pride material hundred percent red material hot July Sun well we're growing up as young people in those days we call it blasting blasting you we're trained to repent what you have been given the heat

in the half of his children so go so the seed of the habit in your heart his children his family to keep that way that was their only defense keep that way here come the enemy and broke the barrier by suing the seed of discrepancy Oh hallelujah but he said I will restore all the years all the years all the years of no praise I will restore all the years of dough proudly kindness I will restore all the years of the holy decency I will restore that was promised by he has restored Oh blessed be the name of a living God amen inclusion email musicians as we get ready conflict between God and Satan
