[57:25] about I was about 26 when he came to
[57:29] Ghana with the Brethren from Lagos they
[57:31] passed by to Ghana and they had meetings
[57:32] in Ghana and when Berto we'd finished
[57:36] preaching there was a group of us about
[57:37] four friends and I said this man has
[57:41] brought a revolution to the message and
[57:43] they were like why I'm like look we go
[57:46] to services we have three four hours of
[57:48] same one but this man comes in 45
[57:51] minutes is out of the way aha man that
[57:53] is that was a revolution amen and so we
[57:56] connected with him something about him
[57:59] not just you know the time but he came
[58:02] with the world in purity in simplicity
[58:06] and empower brother is shook our hearts
[58:09] and we are terrified with him amen
[58:12] and so growing up when we didn't see him
[58:15] on the field was a revolution going on
[58:17] behind the scenes we said no this man
[58:20] must come back on the scene because they
[58:22] caught cold man and when God makes a way
[58:25] he's gonna come back brother and got
[58:27] shot he'd make away and he's back on the
[58:30] field and everybody was better of it

[59:16] morning you know we have families in
[59:18] Ghana da hook up to your services I mean
[59:22] they at home and for the purity of the
[59:25] way that is flowing through here they

[59:41] I trust that the Lord will bless us this
[59:43] morning as we stand to our feet and
[59:45] let's get straight to the word as battle
[59:50] over it we say straight to the word man
[59:53] shall we turn to the book of first
[59:55] Corinthians chapter 13
[59:56] I trust the Lord will bless us this
[1:00:04] morning first Corinthians 13 you know
[1:00:07] the story but we'll read from this eight
[1:00:09] charity never faileth
[1:00:11] but whether they be prophecies they
[1:00:13] shall fail whether there be tongues they
[1:00:15] shall cease whether there be knowledge
[1:00:17] it shall vanish away for we know in part
[1:00:20] and we prophesy in part but when that
[1:00:23] which is perfect is come now this is
[1:00:25] prophecy when that which is perfect is
[1:00:28] come then that which is in part shall be
[1:00:30] done away with when I was a child I
[1:00:32] speak as a child I understood as a child
[1:00:34] I thought as a child but when I became a
[1:00:37] man I put away childish things for now
[1:00:40] we see through a glass darkly but then
[1:00:42] face to face now I know in part but then
[1:00:46] shall I know even as also I am known
[1:00:50] and now abideth Faith Hope charity these
[1:00:53] three but the greatest of these is
[1:00:56] charity
[1:00:57] and then we tend to the last one March
[1:00:59] each of the eleven was two to five main
[1:01:12] now when John had heard in the prison
[1:01:16] the wakes of Christ he sent two
[1:01:18] disciples of his and said unto Him art
[1:01:21] thou he that should come or do we look
[1:01:24] for another jesus answered and said unto
[1:01:27] them go should I go and show John again
[1:01:32] those things which ye do hear and see
[1:01:36] the blind receive their sight and the
[1:01:40] lame walk and the lepers are cleansed
[1:01:43] and the Deaf hear and the dead are
[1:01:46] raised up and the poor have the gospel
[1:01:49] preached to them hallelujah Chargers bar
[1:01:53] has us we pray our Heavenly Father we
[1:01:55] thank you this morning for your grace
[1:01:57] thank you Lord for your saving grace
[1:01:59] that has made a way for us to be your
[1:02:01] presence
[1:02:02] and you promised that way two or three I
[1:02:04] got it in your name you are in their
[1:02:05] midst we know without a doubt that you
[1:02:08] are here this morning father we thank
[1:02:10] you for the word and we thank you for
[1:02:12] the ring of the word father I hide
[1:02:14] myself behind the cross this morning may
[1:02:16] you come in this morning and take over
[1:02:18] speak to your people Lord bless the ring
[1:02:20] of your word a preaching of the word and
[1:02:22] the hearing of it father and the end
[1:02:24] will be careful to give the praise and
[1:02:26] glory in Jesus name Amen and amen amen
[1:02:29] you may be seated
[1:02:31] so this morning I have a title amen and
[1:02:35] my title is that which is perfect is
[1:02:37] come amen
[1:02:39] now Paul was given a prophecy but we are
[1:02:42] here in the manifestation and we are
[1:02:45] declaring that that prophecy is here
[1:02:46] that that which is perfect is not coming
[1:02:49] is here it has come amen and my subject
[1:02:52] is only belief
[1:02:54] now there's a difference between
[1:02:56] believing and only believing so I want
[1:02:59] us to only believe this morning and it's
[1:03:01] not some mysterious thing but God in
[1:03:04] simplicity and that's my inspiration
[1:03:06] this morning so I trust that the Lord
[1:03:08] will bless us this morning you love him
[1:03:11] man and I'll trust that we will have a
[1:03:13] fellowship this morning and as we preach
[1:03:16] I need you to pick back to me hallelujah
[1:03:19] the gospel Abraha Oxford a poster of one
[1:03:22] time what is fellowship he said two
[1:03:24] fellows in the ship so he's the preacher
[1:03:26] and you in the ship this morning having
[1:03:28] fellowship you believe that this morning
[1:03:32] Amen so I know you've been feeding on
[1:03:34] the word Amen and I know we are growing
[1:03:38] higher and higher into the image of his
[1:03:41] son
[1:03:41] Amen and all that the word is to do is
[1:03:45] to bring us to that perfection to bring
[1:03:47] us to only the word to bring us to a
[1:03:50] place of only believing a place that we
[1:03:52] will not doubt the word that whatever is
[1:03:54] written in that where it is this say of
[1:03:57] the Lord whatever is written in that
[1:03:59] where is ye and amen whatever is written
[1:04:02] in that word is for me whatever promise
[1:04:04] is declared in that word is mine
[1:04:06] hallelujah I'm not waiting for somebody
[1:04:08] to testify about what our is to him that
[1:04:11] where is my deliverance is my healing is
[1:04:15] mine the Holy Ghost is my is my promise
[1:04:18] and we are here by the promise of the
[1:04:21] world hallelujah
[1:04:22] and Paul said by these promises we
[1:04:26] become partakers of the divine nature
[1:04:28] that divine nature is the perfection of
[1:04:31] who he is the prophets were pointing us
[1:04:33] to this day they were pointing us to
[1:04:36] that perfect word they were pointing us
[1:04:38] to who Christ was his nature he's been
[1:04:40] hallelujah and what is that nature what
[1:04:43] is that being is to be manifested in the
[1:04:45] bride that bride is here to manifest not
[1:04:48] perfection or the professions or books
[1:04:50] and tapes that perfection is a living
[1:04:53] reality where Moses metal
[1:04:55] reality he said let me turn outside and
[1:04:58] look at this side brother it was
[1:05:00] something that was not comprehensive to
[1:05:02] the human mind a bush was burning but
[1:05:04] was not been it was not consumed it was
[1:05:07] unusual that was a manifestation of this
[1:05:11] living reality Moses how to turn aside
[1:05:14] hallelujah but today we know that that
[1:05:16] living reality is but as the word but we
[1:05:19] have to turn our site and look at that
[1:05:21] word what is in that word for me what is
[1:05:24] in that word for me that is where we are
[1:05:26] here today and that word is in the bride
[1:05:29] brother and the devil cannot come near
[1:05:31] that word because that word his power is
[1:05:34] power and as many of us believe him as
[1:05:38] many as received him to them he gave
[1:05:40] them power power to overcome power to be
[1:05:44] the sons of God power to be the
[1:05:46] daughters of God you say oh but not me
[1:05:48] yes you because God knew you're healed
[1:05:51] God brought on you God trusted you
[1:05:54] God knew you could not come in any other
[1:05:56] age they brought you to this age he knew
[1:06:00] that you could be the word you could be
[1:06:02] the word Express today
[1:06:04] so God reserved you for last hallelujah
[1:06:08] hallelujah when you read the Bible a man
[1:06:12] you may be seen it when you read that
[1:06:14] word you say Oh Daniel was a man of
[1:06:16] faith but God brought more of your faith
[1:06:20] than what Daniel had so go to Daniel go
[1:06:23] your way I'm just gonna show you a
[1:06:25] vision of this bride that is coming in
[1:06:28] the last day that would be the final
[1:06:30] voice Daniel saw you and wanted to be in
[1:06:34] your day but God said no come on Daniel
[1:06:37] they have more faith than you have in
[1:06:40] this day they are coming in that final
[1:06:42] age they are coming in that final time

[1:07:00] Daniels they were not as powerful as
[1:07:03] this day hallelujah
[1:07:06] so Daniel couldn't stand the demon
[1:07:08] powers of this day so go say but I've
[1:07:11] gotta people I've got a bride that was
[1:07:14] to take that word that would believe
[1:07:16] that word that will hold on to that word

[1:07:23] back to God but once they are on the air

[1:08:15] Luther couldn't produce this day Wesley
[1:08:19] couldn't produce this day the
[1:08:21] Pentecostals could not produce this day
[1:08:23] but product there's a pride the
[1:08:27] prophetess a bride who you believe that
[1:08:30] this morning Alleluia amen you may be
[1:08:35] seated
[1:08:36] Alleluia da which is perfect is come
[1:08:39] well Brahm said in the city of
[1:08:40] discrepancy now he said the seed of God
[1:08:43] the Word of God
[1:08:45] the seed of God is the word of God Jesus
[1:08:48] said in a certain place that the word is
[1:08:51] a seed and every seed will bring forth
[1:08:53] of his kind
[1:08:54] now if the Christian the children of God
[1:08:57] the children of the kingdom has become
[1:08:59] the seed of God then they must be the
[1:09:02] word of God
[1:09:06] hallelujah give me Bible no I'm looking
[1:09:09] at Bible this morning because that word
[1:09:12] is in you that where is in me then we
[1:09:16] must be the seed and we must be the word
[1:09:19] hallelujah
[1:09:21] and when it our weight come from that
[1:09:23] word came from God that word was God
[1:09:26] that word became flesh and dwelt among
[1:09:29] us and John had the privilege to
[1:09:32] introduce that word hallelujah he said
[1:09:35] behold the lamb of God that taketh away
[1:09:37] the sins of the world
[1:09:38] amen John was only believing but a time
[1:09:42] came doubt came into John's heart is it
[1:09:45] aware or we are to expect another is it
[1:09:48] that inspiration or we are to expect a
[1:09:50] greater inspiration hallelujah by the
[1:09:52] word spoke back to John go tell John
[1:09:55] that it was prophesied hallelujah that
[1:09:58] I'm gonna come on the air I'm gonna heal
[1:10:01] the sick I'm gonna raise the dead I'm
[1:10:03] gonna open the blind eye I'm gonna
[1:10:05] preach to the people that are bound in
[1:10:07] prison I'm gonna set the captives free
[1:10:10] well go back and tell John that this is
[1:10:13] taking place that means that that which
[1:10:15] was prophesied is right here and it's
[1:10:18] manifesting itself Oh glory be to the
[1:10:21] Living God now that don't need no
[1:10:24] interpretation so go back tell John that
[1:10:26] you see the signs you see the Sigmund
[1:10:29] Hill then you know that that profession
[1:10:31] is here it's not coming here it's not
[1:10:34] speaking in tongues brother you've got
[1:10:37] to get charity then all that will follow
[1:10:40] hallelujah the prophecies will follow
[1:10:43] charity the signs and wonders will
[1:10:45] follow charity not tarry to following
[1:10:47] the signs and wonders so we are looking
[1:10:50] for that perfection where it is only the
[1:10:53] word and only the word alone oh you
[1:10:56] believe that this morning and now if the
[1:10:58] Christian the children of God the
[1:11:00] children of the kingdom has become the
[1:11:02] seed of God then they must be the Word
[1:11:05] of God and the Word of God manifested in
[1:11:08] the eight that we are living in for the
[1:11:11] promised seed of that age amen now let
[1:11:13] me take that again he
[1:11:15] the chin of the kingdom has become the
[1:11:17] seed of God then they must be the Word
[1:11:19] of God the Word of God manifested in the
[1:11:22] age that they are living in for the
[1:11:25] promised seed of that age God gave his

[1:27:32] hallelujah we are both scored according
[1:27:35] to our thinking he might if he's to come
[1:27:38] he must come this way hallelujah if the

[1:28:50] Pope hallelujah

[1:29:10] to this Jesus Christ Jesus didn't give
[1:29:13] them a mystery he said go tell John that

[1:29:50] hidden truth that was to come by any
[1:29:52] other man Malakai for had brought it all

[1:29:59] is the mystery of God revealed Christ

[1:33:16] they are wake up I know 999 thousand
[1:33:19] people didn't make it but I made it
[1:33:22] hallelujah it wasn't by chance it wasn't

[1:50:33] need to let yourself away you need to
[1:50:35] break loose you need to settle down and
[1:50:38] surrender that is the only way he will

[2:23:21] for possible over lo we pray you anoint
[2:23:24] him give him strength Lord as we
[2:23:26] approach a convention touch from the
[2:23:29] crown of his head to the soles of his
[2:23:30] feet Lord it's a built in his heart to
[2:23:33] see your people free the convention is
[2:23:36] not for show it's not just to come
[2:23:38] together but it's muscley this place
[2:23:40] this world is not our home we are just
[2:23:43] passing through
[2:23:44] may we come to that spiritual
[2:23:46] realization of what we are born to do
[2:23:49] we commend everyone into your hands in
[2:23:51] the precious name of Jesus Christ and
[2:23:53] the church says amen amen amen
[2:23:57] you may be seated hallelujah you love
[2:24:01] the Lord just before I give you
[2:24:03] announcements so we do want to play a
[2:24:05] very short deep
[2:24:08] short clip that we made for the
[2:24:10] convention before I make our convention
[2:24:12] announcement so over to you brothers and
[2:24:19] he said so is the kingdom of God as if a
[2:24:23] man should cast seed into the ground and
[2:24:25] should sleep and rise night and day and
[2:24:29] the seed should spring and grow up he
[2:24:31] knoweth not how for the earth bringeth
[2:24:34] forth fruit of herself first the blade
[2:24:37] then the year after that the full corn
[2:24:40] in the air but when the fruit is brought
[2:24:42] forth immediately he put us in the
[2:24:44] sickle because the harvest has come
[2:24:49] [Music]
[2:25:08] therefore said he unto them the harvest
[2:25:11] truly is great but the laborers are few
[2:25:13] pray ye therefore the lord of the
[2:25:15] harvest that he would send forth
[2:25:16] laborers into his harvest at the harvest
[2:25:22] time
[2:25:22] the seed is back to its visual condition
[2:25:25] and must have all all they were in order
[2:25:28] to be the seed I can't have a half a
[2:25:33] seat it will grow hmm it's got to be the
[2:25:36] hold see if Skott do not manifest say I
[2:25:39] think the Baptist only goes how obvious
[2:25:40] bigger don't that's just part of not the
[2:25:52] gifts alive all the gifts see what I
[2:25:57] mean we're at the in time brother
[2:26:00] and God has never left east up on the
[2:26:04] earth without a witness that is always
[2:26:08] somewhere someplace added the person
[2:26:12] that he could put his hands on and
[2:26:15] withstand father wouldn't so he's good
[2:26:19] that sound since Genesis the beginning
[2:26:22] surely somewhere God has a man that he
[2:26:26] laid in now he's more than one man now
[2:26:33] he has many names that he can lay his
[2:26:35] hand on because we're coming down
[2:26:37] through the gathering time the harvest
[2:26:41] [Music]
[2:27:06] they've been talking so much about
[2:27:08] battery not distorting you lettering
[2:27:13] [Music]
[2:27:22] what's the matter
[2:27:23] the church has manufactured herself
[2:27:25] something just like Eve tried to do she
[2:27:28] tried to add more lights and manufacture
[2:27:30] something we've done the same thing time
[2:27:33] to make something in ourselves keep your
[2:27:34] hands off is watered and believe it all
[2:27:40] right in your heart and when the rain
[2:27:41] begins to fall rise will take home and
[2:27:43] the word will manifest itself

[2:29:35] service there'll also be a choir
[2:29:36] practice after the service in addition
[2:29:39] with respect to your meals we'd like to
[2:29:42] encourage you to sort out if you'll be
[2:29:45] requiring a meal and as well as any
[2:29:48] payment arrangement with the desk
[2:29:49] downstairs after today for the members
[2:29:51] of this church I'm not sure if there'll
[2:29:54] be any one processing those orders so
[2:29:58] you may have to make alternative
[2:30:00] arrangement so we really want you to
[2:30:01] sort that out as well and for those of
[2:30:03] you who in your heart have made a
[2:30:05] commitment to the pledge in some way we
[2:30:10] encourage you to join us in being able
[2:30:14] to pull all the pieces of the convention
[2:30:16] together and most important
[2:30:19] Libyan prayer without prayer without the
[2:30:24] sacrifice without the efforts when I ran
[2:30:26] I've said no revival comes with our
[2:30:27] prayer so we are on the grid expectation
[2:30:30] come with a burden in your heart and
[2:30:33] come on the grid expectation and pray
[2:30:34] for the believers that are on their way
[2:30:37] that are traveling in we have many
[2:30:38] challenges every time there are
[2:30:40] challenges but we have seen God help us
[2:30:43] overcome every single one every single
[2:30:45] year so we are looking for course you do
[2:30:47] something great and be the ministers in
[2:30:49] prayer as well because we know the
[2:30:52] ministers kind of bring the revival the
[2:30:54] revival is born by the people the Bible
[2:30:56] the revival is carried by the people so
[2:30:58] you don't have to wait until Friday to
[2:31:00] get started we get insulted right now
[2:31:02] every day by the time Friday morning
[2:31:05] comes this place should be shaking this
[2:31:06] world should be shaking those in the
[2:31:08] internet connection should be shaken
[2:31:10] because the Holy Ghost is already moving
[2:31:12] as a burden as a crowd as a call and the
[2:31:15] ministers would barely be able to
[2:31:16] minister because the Holy Ghost would
[2:31:18] take complete control you believe that
[2:31:20] this morning all right so I think that's
[2:31:24] it for now Spence let's get ready to
