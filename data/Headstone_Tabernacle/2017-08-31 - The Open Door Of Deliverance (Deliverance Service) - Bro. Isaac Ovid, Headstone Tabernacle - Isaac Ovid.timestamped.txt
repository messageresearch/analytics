[16:28] hallelujah are you happy to be in the
[16:31] house of the Lord tonight on this
[16:34] special Wednesday night service
[16:37] you know God is a God of suddenly you
[16:41] read the Bible it says suddenly he was
[16:43] there suddenly something happens and
[16:46] whenever a suddenly happens is God's way
[16:48] of breaking the routine breaking the
[16:51] order of things and I believe that
[16:53] tonight is a break in the routine
[16:55] we're not normally here on a Wednesday
[16:57] night so the devil doesn't know what's
[16:59] going on he had no idea we were gonna be
[17:02] here tonight and we are gonna sing we're
[17:04] gonna shout you gonna worship so we're
[17:07] gonna keep the devil confused tonight
[17:09] we're gonna keep him confused because
[17:11] we're gonna smile we might be tired but
[17:14] we still gonna worship we might be weary
[17:16] but that's all right we know where we
[17:18] come from and we know where we're going
[17:21] can the church say Amen Oh blessed be
[17:24] the name of the Lord
[17:25] so I greet you tonight in the precious
[17:27] name of Jesus Christ and if you have
[17:28] your Bibles would you tinted me too
[17:31] but three portions of Scripture not
[17:34] going to be too long with you tonight
[17:36] but we want to read from the book of
[17:39] Genesis and the book of Revelation and
[17:41] brother Branham said that there are two
[17:43] books in the Bible at the devil heats
[17:47] which are the books of Genesis and the
[17:51] book of Revelation so we want to stay
[17:54] right where we give the devil problems
[17:58] because if we don't give them problems
[18:00] we create a room for him to give us
[18:02] problems so we have him on the ropes
[18:05] tonight and we want to keep him on the
[18:06] ropes tonight so Genesis chapter 6 and
[18:10] reading from verse 5 and God saw that
[18:14] the wickedness of man was great in the
[18:17] earth and that every imagination of the
[18:20] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[18:22] continually and it repented the Lord
[18:26] that he had made man on the earth and it
[18:28] grieved him at his heart and the Lord
[18:30] said I will destroy man whom I have
[18:33] created from the face of the earth both
[18:35] man and beast and the creeping thing and
[18:38] the fowls of the air for it repented
[18:40] me that I have made them but Noah found
[18:43] grace in the eyes of the Lord I'm
[18:46] reading Genesis 7 the next chapter
[18:49] reading from verse 1 and the Lord said
[18:52] unto Noah come thou and all thy house
[18:54] into the ark for thee have I seen
[18:57] righteous before me in this generation
[18:59] I'm going down to visit the team in the
[19:04] self-same day entered Noah and Shem and
[19:07] ham and Japheth the sons of Noah and
[19:09] Noah's wife and the three wives of his
[19:11] sons with them into the ark vien every
[19:13] beast after his kind and all the cattle
[19:15] after their kind and every creeping
[19:17] thing that creepeth upon the earth after
[19:19] his kind and every fowl after his kind
[19:22] every bird after every sort and they
[19:24] went in unto Noah into the ark two and
[19:26] two of all flesh wherein is the breath
[19:28] of life and he that went in went in male
[19:31] and female of all flesh as God had
[19:33] commanded him and the Lord shut him in
[19:36] an hour last reading from the book of
[19:37] Revelation chapter 3 and with it
[19:40] revelation 3 and verse 8 for I know thy
[19:44] works behold I have set before thee an
[19:46] open door and no man can shut it for
[19:50] thou hast a little strength and ice kept
[19:53] my word and has not denied my name can
[19:56] we bow our heads for a word of Prayer
[19:57] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[19:59] grace for your love tonight and law we
[20:01] are breaking our routine Lord and the
[20:03] hustle and the bustle of life and father

[20:53] over they and me you bring him back Lord
[20:55] safely and in strength to us father may
[20:57] you bless the services this coming
[20:59] Sunday and may you be with your people
[21:01] in the precious name of Jesus Christ and
[21:03] the church says amen you may be seated
[21:06] tonight so for a short title for this
[21:09] exhortation tonight the open door of
[21:12] deliverance the open door of deliverance
[21:16] and we read the scripture that God was
[21:19] looking at the urgent he realized that
[21:22] man had fallen from his position man had
[21:25] fallen out of order if God had a vision
[21:28] of what he wanted to see when he was
[21:30] looking at man it was it was not what he
[21:32] had wanted to see was not his desire and
[21:35] brother Brandon brought out that is not
[21:37] God desire that anyone would be lost see
[21:39] he doesn't look when somebody Falls and
[21:41] say it's good for you that's not his
[21:43] desire is not his attribute that you
[21:45] make mistakes is not his nature that he
[21:47] you wants you to be in trouble
[21:49] and as God looked he had seen that man
[21:51] was out of position husbands out of
[21:53] their position wives out of their
[21:55] position fathers out of their position
[21:58] mothers out of their position believers
[22:00] so to speak out of their position every
[22:04] imagination the Bible says was evil
[22:07] could you imagine every imagination
[22:10] every time their mind goes somewhere is
[22:13] evil every thought they had was evil the
[22:16] way their mind worked
[22:17] it just was evil the conclusions they
[22:20] came up with was evil the ideas they had
[22:23] was evil the dreams they had was evil he
[22:25] said every imagination it was not a
[22:28] minority it was not once in our aisle
[22:30] but when God looked at everything every
[22:33] imagination was evil
[22:36] but yet in the midst of all of that in
[22:39] the midst of that God for one man who
[22:43] found grace in the eyes of the Lord and
[22:45] his name was Noah and I could imagine as
[22:49] God looks at the world right now you see
[22:51] into every imagination evil
[22:54] young people evil you see on the news
[22:56] it's fight it's murder it's this is bad
[22:59] and I could imagine God shakes his head
[23:01] but I believe that there's some people
[23:03] who have found grace in the eyes of the
[23:06] Lord the Bible says if repented God that
[23:12] he made man in other words God almost
[23:14] regrets it even me man
[23:16] because what he made man to do man was
[23:19] not to him he had created man to worship
[23:22] but man was not worship him he had
[23:24] created man to have dominion but man was
[23:26] not having dominion he had created man
[23:29] to be happy but man was not happy he had
[23:32] created man to be sons of God but they
[23:35] were not acting like sons of korah
[23:36] there every imagination was taking them
[23:39] away from God so God said you know what
[23:42] I'm gonna destroy this time I'm gonna
[23:44] destroy man because this is not what I
[23:47] created them for but God who is rich in
[23:51] grace and mercy whenever he finds
[23:53] somebody who finds grace and insight he
[23:57] could never destroy the righteous of
[23:59] with a wick hit him that's why when he
[24:02] spoke to Abraham he say Abraham I can't
[24:04] hide from you what I'm about to do but
[24:07] what's happening in Sodom and Gomorrah
[24:09] has disturbed me so I've come down to
[24:12] take care of business up but Abraham was
[24:15] such a soldier he started to negotiate
[24:17] with God is there somebody tonight who
[24:21] answer negotiate with God God had made
[24:25] up his mind I'm gonna wipe out Sodom and
[24:29] Gomorrah
[24:29] but Abraham save oh wait a minute Lord
[24:32] with one minute if there are 50 what you
[24:35] wipe it out he said no not 4:15 Abraham
[24:38] when he plays it there 40
[24:40] he said no I'm gonna spit I can't do it
[24:42] in receivers 30 Abraham push and he
[24:45] pushes a lot of his 10 and when God
[24:48] investigated he sent the angels to
[24:51] investigator he couldn't even find him
[24:54] he's from Locke and his family and he
[24:57] had to bring them out of because God can
[25:00] never destroy the righteous with the
[25:02] wicked if god has to send angels to pull
[25:06] you out of wherever you are he is clutch
[25:09] sirtuins up because that's what makes
[25:11] him god up he is obligated to defend his
[25:14] name he is obligated
[25:19] you may be seated the message last
[25:22] Sunday but the dealer was speaking and
[25:24] he said when man fell yes man lost a lot
[25:28] but he said God had a lot more at stake
[25:31] because God wanted fellowship God wanted
[25:34] a family God had made an investment and
[25:37] when God looked at it he saw his
[25:40] investment going down the drain he said
[25:43] I can't lose all of this investment
[25:45] I can't lose all of this investment up I
[25:47] can't lose all the attributes that I
[25:50] poured into this man called Adam I'm not
[25:52] giving up that easy
[25:54] I spent time to make him I spent time to
[25:57] phone him I spend time to call him I put
[26:00] his name on the book a lamb was slain
[26:05] before the foundation of the world
[26:07] before Adam was even there I'm not about
[26:11] to lose this investment and God has made
[26:14] an investment up in you yes for you
[26:19] that blood price that was paid on
[26:21] Calvary God is not gonna lose his
[26:23] investment he is not gonna waste his
[26:26] investment he has paid for you because
[26:29] he saw you valuable he paid for you
[26:32] because there's something in you that's
[26:34] gonna come forth gonna be manifested
[26:37] gonna be made visible the world may not
[26:40] see it yet what is there you may not see
[26:43] it yet but it's there you leave a minute
[26:46] see it but it's there
[26:47] your boss may not see it but it's there
[26:49] there's a seed in your soul and the
[26:52] devil is mad but I'm so glad
[26:55] [Applause]
[26:57] halleluyah halleluyah
[27:00] you may be seated so I want you to
[27:03] understand no I didn't even know what
[27:06] was going on Noah was living his life
[27:09] just pleasing God he wasn't doing it to
[27:12] impress God you know he was doing it
[27:14] because it was his attribute to find
[27:17] Shiva in the eyes of God he wasn't
[27:20] thinking you know I think I couldn't
[27:22] judge the world this is why I behaving
[27:24] like that do we know as acting was
[27:28] normal living for him his normal
[27:31] behavior got caused attention he didn't
[27:36] know he was being observed he didn't
[27:39] know he was being monitored he didn't
[27:41] know an examination was going on but
[27:44] Noah's passing the exam with flying
[27:47] colors his life his character his
[27:52] behavior his attitude godless him that
[27:55] man I can't let that Monday not
[27:59] that--some not that boy not that son I
[28:04] don't know what the Bible says all these
[28:06] men we preach about were men of like
[28:09] passion meaning they were just like you
[28:11] and me but they defy the odds they were
[28:14] just like you and me but when the other
[28:16] was against them though he slay me yet
[28:19] still I'll trust him job was just like
[28:22] you and me but when he said toe the skin
[28:24] once I destroy my body he was sick but
[28:28] the odds were against him but he didn't
[28:31] give up he didn't backslide he didn't go
[28:34] back to the world he got worried he got
[28:37] tired but something kept going something
[28:41] kept him alive
[28:42] and that's why we are here tonight
[28:44] something has kept us alive when all
[28:47] hell is against you because hell could
[28:49] never stop you can the church seaman
[28:54] somebody give her a shot of praise
[28:58] hallelujah
[29:00] listen the devil has tried for thousands
[29:05] of years to stop God and up to know he
[29:10] can do it
[29:12] [Applause]
[29:14] every time he tried to cut this one off
[29:17] and cut this one off and cut this one
[29:20] off and the biggest mistake he made his
[29:22] when he killed Jesus because Abraham was
[29:27] trouble nor was trouble Jonah was
[29:29] trouble
[29:30] Joe was trouble everybody was troubling
[29:32] you all right when Shauna was supposed
[29:35] to go this way and Jonah went that way
[29:37] the devil was like yeah you see I knew
[29:39] you wasn't gonna make it
[29:40] oh let's eat when I backslide Jonah's
[29:44] supposed to be preaching in Nineveh and
[29:46] Jonah see it not me I think any poor
[29:49] towards this way and when Shana heading
[29:51] this way any devil laughing God laughing
[29:54] louder because God know the end of the
[29:57] story you see the devil doesn't know how
[30:01] the story is going to end but God knows
[30:04] the end of the story
[30:05] that's what makes him God he is Alpha
[30:09] and he is Omega
[30:12] he is the beginning he is the ending so
[30:16] don't give up in the middle of your
[30:18] story there's a bigger life going on
[30:21] it's a life of Jubilee it's a laugh of I
[30:24] know they're gonna make him don't wipe
[30:26] the tear from your eyes lift up your
[30:29] shoulders throw your head back
[30:31] yes sickness in the face and say yet in
[30:35] my flesh I shall see God
[30:37] that is my testimony that will be your
[30:40] testimony and the church amen
[30:43] oh and Juna Juna in the wheel joint on
[30:51] the ship rather and the ship began to
[30:53] rock she will not know one time that he
[30:57] is a problem because when you're not in
[30:59] position you know you had a problem your
[31:01] blessing only comes when you are in
[31:03] position so to not feel the board shaky
[31:05] knees looking around and they trying to
[31:07] cast lots to see who it is it's Alisa
[31:09] forget all and I just threw me overboard
[31:11] throw me overboard I went to church on
[31:14] overboard there was a repair the first
[31:17] GPS directed repaired submarine vessel
[31:20] that was ever created
[31:22] all I'm suffering they have no is trying
[31:25] to be imitated course original vessel to
[31:28] transport sons
[31:32] because Jonah had a destination for some
[31:36] people to be delivered and God has a
[31:39] destination for some sons and daughters
[31:42] to be delivered that's why we are in a
[31:44] deliverance service tonight for whatever
[31:47] is cheating you down whatever is binding
[31:50] you whatever is hauling you black for
[31:52] you to break free
[31:54] watch the chains and break free God
[31:57] deliver need to unlock it you have the
[31:59] power to break free
[32:01] you are superhero tonight whatever chain
[32:05] they put you could break free like
[32:08] Samson and chain him he broke free
[32:10] nobody had to help him but when the
[32:13] Spirit of the Lord came upon him and
[32:16] activated what was already in him you
[32:19] don't need something new you already got
[32:21] something you need something more more
[32:24] more can the church amen
[32:31] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God can
[32:40] God he made away and a door of
[32:45] deliverance opened up to the people of
[32:49] Nineveh during a vigil and bondage Moses
[32:54] came on a door of deliverance open up to
[33:00] them we heard it Sunday and I think I
[33:03] said it a Sunday before speaking about
[33:05] that man who got the pardon that was
[33:07] written from which we get a pass and a
[33:11] pardon until it's accepted there was a
[33:12] door and was opened to him he chose not
[33:16] to step through that door and not accept
[33:19] a pardon so - in the days of Noah Noah
[33:23] is under the anointing he's inspired God
[33:26] didn't speak to his wife
[33:27] God didn't speak to his children God and
[33:29] speak to his neighbors God spoke to
[33:31] Noah's here Noah I'm gonna judge the
[33:33] earth build an ark and Noah went into
[33:36] action and defy the odds because what he
[33:39] was preaching had never happened that's
[33:41] a difficult message to preach it's
[33:44] easier to preach now because we are
[33:46] speaking of what has happened and is
[33:47] going to repeat and bring back the old
[33:49] days and back to Pentecost that's easy
[33:51] to preach no had it hard it will rain
[33:54] and rain had never fallen before there
[33:58] was no reference point for Noah
[34:00] we have many references David John job
[34:03] Jonah Elijah
[34:05] all examples to get inspiration where
[34:07] did Noah get his inspiration from it's
[34:09] rain but it was caught said soon a
[34:13] revelation in his soul that captain
[34:16] building building against the odds bring
[34:18] more go forward bring the table bring
[34:20] the animals bring everything and he was
[34:23] building
[34:24] and a door was open that anybody could
[34:28] have walked in that door was not
[34:31] exclusively for Noah and for Noah's
[34:34] family
[34:35] Noah's preaching was to get the
[34:38] attention of the public to come into
[34:40] that door
[34:41] Noah small ministry was about that door
[34:45] because once you cross the threshold of
[34:48] the door you were in the Ark of safety
[34:50] his horror gospel was come into the Ark
[34:54] of safety come into this door of
[34:57] deliverance if you are outside at all
[35:00] you're not gonna make it but if you step
[35:03] into the door you're gonna be all right
[35:05] and you step through the door you're
[35:08] gonna be safe if you step through the
[35:11] door you're gonna eat him plenty and be
[35:14] satisfied because a storm is coming up a
[35:17] flood is coming judgment is coming and
[35:20] Noah preached year-after-year service
[35:23] after service he had to preacher his
[35:26] children he had to preach to his wife he
[35:28] had to preach his friends he was a man
[35:32] of light passion I'm sure he had
[35:33] neighbors I'm sorry of people that knew
[35:37] all grew up with their people who used
[35:39] to call him no no what you doing come
[35:49] hang out this evening with us no see I'm
[35:52] building because the rain is coming
[35:56] what rain is talking about know what is
[36:00] rain laughing and mocking and Noah had
[36:09] to keep on going when nobody else
[36:11] understood it's one thing if you're in a
[36:14] group and the group has a understanding
[36:17] and revelation and you're doing it
[36:18] together but Noah had no help because he
[36:22] was the only one with a revelation his
[36:24] wife didn't have the revelation his
[36:27] children have the revelation he was the
[36:28] only one and he was standing in the gap
[36:32] for his wife standing in the gap for his
[36:35] children so don't think you come in to
[36:37] services and accidental by chance you
[36:40] are standing in the gap for your house
[36:42] you are standing in the gap for your
[36:45] family they may not be here tonight but
[36:48] you are the key to unlock in their
[36:50] future you are the key to unlocking them
[36:53] because the Jesus I will be failing you
[36:56] will be the Jesus that they will see
[36:58] there are people who are not
[36:59] predestinated to read the books and the
[37:02] tapes but when they see you they see the
[37:04] books and the tapes because you are
[37:06] written in missiles read unknown of men
[37:11] you made me see that I'm not gonna be
[37:14] too long with you just to shake you a
[37:17] little bit Noah had the hardest message
[37:20] to ever preach no one preached and
[37:23] nobody will come to the altar Noah
[37:29] preached for the class and nobody would
[37:31] repent Noah had no fruits of his
[37:35] ministry beyond this family think about
[37:38] it could you imagine your ministry is
[37:42] over a hundred years and there's not one
[37:43] convert because things were so bad the
[37:48] Bible says every imagination was evil
[37:52] the minds of the people had been grown
[37:55] accustomed to being not about God and
[37:58] the things of God the devil at consuming
[38:00] like this dear that will consume the
[38:03] people minds with the styles and the
[38:05] fashions and the cares of life and being
[38:08] so PC your every imagination is being
[38:11] influenced by another and that influence
[38:14] is one of evil
[38:16] what is your influence tonight but there
[38:19] is hope there is a door there is a door
[38:23] of deliverance we read the scripture in
[38:25] the book of Revelation 3 and verse in
[38:27] the hall I set before you an open door
[38:31] no man open this door no man can shut
[38:34] this door and whether Branham brought
[38:37] out that after Luther and Wesley there
[38:39] was no messenger to the Pentecostal age
[38:42] Christ himself dropped down and open the
[38:45] door that door was the tour of the Holy
[38:47] Ghost no man had opened it and no man
[38:51] has the power to close it and that door
[38:53] has remained open so whoever wants to
[38:56] step into the Holy Ghost but the random
[38:58] said Christ is the door the church is
[39:01] not the door but the Holy Ghost is the
[39:03] door and you could just step through the
[39:05] door tonight just as people have the
[39:07] opportunity to step to the door in the
[39:10] days of Noah what will you do tonight
[39:12] will you stay outside or will you come
[39:15] inside I challenge you to come inside
[39:17] tonight
[39:19] can the church say man for the Branum
[39:23] said very ejected not Noah but they
[39:27] rejected Jesus Christ in North that's
[39:32] who they rejected he didn't reject MOA
[39:34] because but the Brennan said it was
[39:36] Christ in Noah but then I said they
[39:38] rejected the Word of God for that each
[39:43] can the church same Noah is Dan the Ark
[39:51] and the Bible says God shut him in he
[39:58] didn't closed the door he didn't lock
[40:01] anybody off it was God had shot him him
[40:06] in and when that door was shot the
[40:10] opportunity for salvation had passed the
[40:14] day of grace had transitioned into a day
[40:18] of judgment the world didn't realized
[40:21] that for all the years Noah was
[40:23] preaching the judgment the plagues of
[40:25] flood was being held back until Noah
[40:27] could be sealed into Christ until he
[40:30] could be in position before God could
[40:34] shut the door no one had to be in his
[40:36] place and before God could shut the door
[40:41] Noah has to be in his place Noah this
[40:45] type of this bride who finds favor in
[40:47] God's eyes has to be in her place
[40:51] what place are you in tonight because
[40:55] the Bible said that comes a day when he
[40:57] who is righteous is righteous still he
[41:03] us filty is filty still you know there
[41:07] are some people when they want to buy
[41:09] something buy a fridge buy a stove buy a
[41:13] car let us take that time and check
[41:16] things check it out good now because you
[41:19] don't to take any chances
[41:24] and it's amazing how people depending on
[41:27] the value of what they want to get they
[41:29] will spend more time investigating to
[41:31] not take chances chances about something
[41:36] that is temporary because no matter how
[41:40] you're investigated car the use guy 1x2
[41:43] check the engine to check the spark
[41:45] plugs if they sell of that whatever else
[41:47] they have known one day that car will
[41:50] not be able to start one in a car will
[41:53] not be able to go anywhere but it's an
[41:55] age of man to check it out in the
[41:58] natural it amazes me how in the
[42:01] spiritual people want to gamble with
[42:05] their souls and take a chance take a
[42:10] chance by not weighing your decisions
[42:14] not weighing what you're doing and
[42:17] service after service will come and the
[42:20] door is preached every service the doors
[42:23] breach and people choose to wonder if
[42:29] you know but the Branham said when he
[42:31] was ministering to the audiences and the
[42:33] Holy Ghost would be there and he would
[42:35] be on the discernment and people would
[42:37] come to him and he'd say your name is
[42:38] so-and-so and you lived in so-and-so and
[42:41] then the in Zola would pull him over
[42:43] there and pull him over there and he
[42:45] said there would be people who were to
[42:47] be healed that he would say it's over
[42:50] there and he said they did not respond
[42:53] fast enough and the angel left and they
[42:58] missed it could you imagine it's one
[43:03] thing to not know you miss it that's one
[43:06] thing it's one thing if you miss work
[43:10] one day and they were having our checks
[43:12] for 10,000 others and nobody tell you it
[43:15] helped you wouldn't feel a certain way
[43:18] about it but if the next day you come
[43:21] you recognize a if I was here I would
[43:24] have gotten it then you live with this
[43:26] regret
[43:29] friends this journey of Christianity is
[43:33] a journey of choice and decision that
[43:37] could lead to regrets that you have the
[43:40] opportunity tonight to avoid those
[43:44] regrets I can imagine
[43:47] Noah's children because no one's
[43:51] children had not also they had not heard
[43:53] from God but they Brandon painted a
[43:55] picture that Noah had to slam the door
[43:59] the window on Noah's children have
[44:02] because they wanted to go outside they
[44:04] wanted willing participants they didn't
[44:08] say I already want to be in the ark you
[44:10] know daddy already wants to come tonight
[44:12] to be in New York what time you will
[44:16] that was my deposition but Noah's love
[44:19] for them had almost forced them into the
[44:23] Ark and I tell young people all the time
[44:29] try to decision what the parents trying
[44:31] to do them as human beings we always
[44:37] have differences you may not have to
[44:39] agree with everything but you have to
[44:40] respect and listen what is the motive
[44:43] and objective is it to bring you closer
[44:45] to God but he's gonna get you away from
[44:47] good you have to discern the motive and
[44:52] the objective but I wanna know what
[44:54] happened when the door is shut and
[44:56] Noah's children here and their friends
[44:59] on the outside because they would have
[45:02] all heard of Noah preached commented
[45:05] here cometh in the Ark and I can imagine
[45:08] all those know what sure and being so
[45:10] grateful that daddy had said a or you
[45:13] better get in or else by whatever means
[45:17] necessary to get them in because he knew
[45:19] what was going to happen it would not
[45:22] have been easy for those children to see
[45:24] their friends one by one the flood take
[45:27] them right now in the u.s. there's a
[45:31] hurricane that has been the worst in
[45:34] years lives lost hoses
[45:38] devastated property come true I know the
[45:43] Bible said there be Wars rumors of wars
[45:45] different diverse places all kind of and
[45:48] he said he said and you know what the
[45:50] any don't even yet there's more coming
[45:54] on but you know what that's not your
[45:56] fear look up your Redemption draweth man
[46:00] because what has happened to the earth
[46:02] has to happen legally earth is preparing
[46:05] to be cleansed for real owners to take
[46:08] their place the mountain no the real
[46:12] owners are the trees nobody real owners
[46:14] up we have been hiding for too long as
[46:16] the real owners of this because the
[46:18] Bible says we shall reign on it the
[46:21] earth is waiting for the kings the sons
[46:24] of God to walk on the earth but before
[46:27] God were allowed to walk he was the
[46:29] cleanses you were to make sure things
[46:31] and please
[46:32] but the Branham said the reason his
[46:34] sickness and sin he said Satan is the
[46:37] Prince of the power the air he said
[46:39] demons in the atmosphere he said it will
[46:42] take fire to destroy them and when the
[46:44] fire comes it it opens up the whole
[46:46] thing for the whole of creation to
[46:49] transform because some sons of God are
[46:53] coming back into position to walk on
[46:56] streets of gold and to take leaves from
[46:59] the tree see the nation's and that's
[47:02] your inheritance eternal life is your
[47:06] inheritance joy unspeakable is your

[49:51] packed a certain way to make sure there
[49:53] is no movement and it's packed right so

[51:33] see were trans and I think I see that
[51:36] there then people at her and Nathan came
[51:40] to my holiday so I am party all night
[51:42] long and watch them is something else my
[51:45] name is spirit or something when it's
[51:48] election time I see people 4 o'clock any
[51:50] morning people who go to bed in the
[51:57] clock
[51:57] - am the up because it wants to know who
[52:00] in because this is the thing people eat
[52:04] p.m. they all call for Christmas night
[52:06] Christmas I forget it go away the
[52:10] harmony of coho I could sleep I'd have
[52:13] how many other because in the spirit of
[52:16] Christmas I think we talked about it
[52:21] pressures but adjourn Philip went on to
[52:22] be with the Lord one Christmas he have
[52:24] not painted and not painting no Pete
[52:28] what Bible transitions no not me boy
[52:31] Christmas Eve
[52:32] it is he paid if you see kids nobody
[52:37] paying so fast because he spirits are
[52:40] easing it hits him and it hit hard and
[52:43] that's what some of us need to get to
[52:45] hit harder
[52:46] I recognize wait a minute I'm getting
[52:48] out of this place
[52:50] I don't know world forever that's not my
[52:52] passion is that would my personal
[52:54] rejoicing and worship and this is a
[52:57] testing ground to prove that I can make
[53:00] it that I'm counted worthy that I've
[53:02] found grace and save up in the eyes of
[53:04] Almighty God
[53:09] can the church same and the musician to
[53:13] get ready I'm almost finished so I
[53:17] challenge you tonight to make the right
[53:20] choice don't just put your foot here our
[53:24] people watch that summer real happy
[53:26] people some time ago I told my dad I say
[53:31] you know sometime people walk in to the
[53:34] church and there's something on the
[53:35] floor and for some people if you see
[53:37] something Friday and party or you'll
[53:39] pick it up so you ask yourself the
[53:42] question why would somebody come into
[53:44] the house of God he's a man front
[53:45] passage street and say there has to be
[53:48] only one answer because in their house
[53:57] they have grown accustomed to pass in
[54:01] suffering wrong
[54:02] so today miss no it's no difference
[54:05] because this half waiting people like
[54:08] Newton have who you know every when I
[54:10] was young I was in the world I was
[54:12] delivered from Edward when amongst a
[54:16] clean up well join I remember one day I
[54:18] clean up little bit kappa damn police up
[54:20] under the covers
[54:21] I see the fastest cleanups ever clean up
[54:31] me room or else covered open and
[54:33] everything going up but you didn't know
[54:35] how it fit if you open that cupboard you
[54:39] wouldn't believe what coming only cover
[54:43] but that is what happens when they doing
[54:45] something halfway and God wants us to go
