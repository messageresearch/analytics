[25:14] a man was certainly a privilege to be
[25:20] here tonight a man and I didn't have to
[25:24] be here
[25:25] praise God just yesterday I was in the
[25:28] middle of an incident on the road and
[25:31] it's just the grace of God to show you
[25:33] what you could have what you just missed
[25:37] amen
[25:38] I was coming I was going on my regular
[25:41] route to lunch and work and a few things
[25:45] happened before and it delayed me and I
[25:46] wondered about it but then when I got to
[25:48] that point I caused swallow to the
[25:50] street and there was an exchange of fire
[25:52] gunfire and there's a police officer
[25:55] behind and it was just wild shots
[25:56] happening and then they stopped in a
[25:58] little road and there was this Mexican
[26:00] standoff the drivers of the vehicle had
[26:03] their guns and they were pointing at the
[26:04] officers and everything so I just ran
[26:06] off just enough to slip up the street
[26:08] and run away anyway but a man if I was a
[26:12] second earlier I would have been right
[26:15] in the middle of it because that was my
[26:16] regular route to go where I was going so
[26:18] just God just shows his grease in your
[26:21] life I was right there just to see what
[26:26] I had just been saved from it was just
[26:30] the grace of God to me tonight so I know
[26:33] that I'm here for a purpose tonight
[26:35] because if the devil had his way he
[26:38] would have cut me off but I made it
[26:40] tonight mama I made it praise hallelujah

[26:46] defeated his sword goes before us and

[26:57] would not defend you we're not you're
[26:59] not looking great when you are not aware

[27:04] you from in front of you from behind you
[27:06] oh I have every right to shout tonight
[27:09] to praise God tonight to dance to sing
[27:13] or when I see my enemies praise God cut
[27:16] off before me I feel like Miriam tonight

[27:30] he cannot have all the devil could have
[27:32] some of them hallelujah but he can't
[27:34] have you tonight because you are
[27:36] predestinated to be conformed to the
[27:39] image of his son

[27:43] last hour I believe it all my heart or

[42:16] groaning we should be travailing we
[42:19] should be looking we should be on an
[42:21] expectation we should be burning but in
[42:24] our hearts to see Jesus to see a reality
[42:27] in my life if the past is anointed
[42:30] that's wonderful but you have to get
[42:32] your own anointing if the pastor got
[42:35] revolution that's wonderful
[42:37] but you have to have your own revelation
[42:39] it's not good enough to say you come to
[42:41] this church but have you received the
[42:44] Holy Ghost since you believe the theme
[42:47] of every apostle is how we receive the
[42:50] Holy Ghost since you believe I don't
[42:52] care who you belong to
[42:54] I don't care how long you in the message
[42:56] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[43:00] you believe are you in the church
[43:01] triumphant are you in the Savior's pride

[43:40] in a natural in order to achieve it take
[43:45] a sacrifice if you do what you're
[43:47] comfortable doing between 9:00 to 5:00
[43:49] you can never grow beyond that you'll be
[43:52] very good at your 9:00 to 5:00 you'll be
[43:56] very good at your routine but in order
[43:59] for you to get from one stitch to annex
[44:00] it takes growing pains it takes a little
[44:04] extra it takes some night hours it takes
[44:07] some groanings in the night time when
[44:10] people not looking when people not
[44:12] seeing you are they're plugging away you
[44:16] are they're praying away you are there

[44:25] calling making your election sure giving
[44:29] all diligence add to your faith virtue
[44:31] to your virtue knowledge you are
[44:34] diligent in your prayer closets and your
[44:37] secret space oh jesus said don't do like
[44:41] the publicans they pray in the open
[44:43] looking for commendation looking for
[44:45] accolades but going to your prayer
[44:47] closet shut the door behind you and pray
[44:50] to your father in secrets and he prays
[44:54] and secrets he that season secrets he
[44:57] shall reward you openly
[45:00] raju with the holy ghost he reward you

[45:06] you with that rainbow presence that was
[45:09] around the prophets that was five feet
[45:11] from him that he was sick
[45:14] the Grays are dead that casts out Devils
[45:17] Jesus said if you abide in me and my
[45:20] words abide in you
[45:21] you can ask whatever you will out of
[45:25] your belly shall flow rivers of living
[45:27] water so there's a work to do but all
[45:39] they keep saying and no Reviver didn't
[45:43] come without some kind of sacrifice and
[45:46] he was talking about South Sea more
[45:48] prayed five hours a day and different
[45:52] things isn't that right I need disciples
[45:57] were in the upper room ten days they
[45:59] were up there worshiping they were
[46:01] object creating atmosphere they were up
[46:04] there praying they were up there calling
[46:06] upon God it takes a certain kind of
[46:08] attitude and the Prophet said the right
[46:11] mental attitude is what will bring the
[46:15] Prophet promise the pass is night
[46:18] hallelujah cut out the right attitude
[46:20] gotta have the right approach and I've
[46:23] got to be doing your part in order for
[46:25] the father to take place hallelujah
[46:27] prophet said let me be the revival so we
[46:31] not even putting this on anybody else
[46:33] tonight
[46:33] we are putting this in your lap you've
[46:36] got the Peter revival somebody say
[46:38] Manson you've got to be the Reviver
[46:41] you've got to pray you've got to praise
[46:44] he's got to worship
[46:46] you've got to call upon God you've got
[46:48] to get serious with God we've got to get
[46:51] next to yourself you've got to get
[46:53] dressed for it if you know you have
[46:55] demons in your life not your struggle in
[46:58] which the protoplanet said you did the
[47:00] Synod now you got to do the plain
[47:03] you got to do the callin ouch can't do
[47:05] it for you the pastor can't do it for
[47:08] you but they can't can't do it for you
[47:09] Jasha can't do it for you you got to do
[47:12] that for yourself you got to get up and
[47:16] get or you will get nothing if you don't
[47:23] work jesus said come unto me all ye that
[47:30] heavily-laden I'll give you rest a man
[47:34] is not right I'll give you rest from
[47:36] your labors
[47:37] but you must be laboring it must be a
[47:40] burden it must be a groan there must be
[47:44] a travail hallelujah otherwise what are
[47:46] you resting from know if there's no
[47:50] burden then you get it easy now as they
[47:53] say easy come easy go it's nice but
[47:56] that's not the kind of Christians God
[47:58] wants in this hour because I don't got
[48:01] it easy
[48:01] Adam was given Dominion and he forfeited
[48:05] it for the sin in the Garden of Eden is
[48:07] Arash
[48:08] so God fouled himself and he would not
[48:11] have it like that again but that you
[48:13] would have to fight for your individual
[48:15] inheritance you have to fight to enter
[48:18] back in to that tree of life again
[48:21] Holland God set it up that way yes he
[48:24] did his part but you've got to do your
[48:26] part also it's not pretty enough they
[48:29] just say I'm a Christian and I pay my
[48:31] tithes and I'm a nice person hallelujah
[48:34] between good and perfect and this
[48:37] ministry comfort to bring forth
[48:39] perfection
[48:40] therefore if reflection is required we
[48:43] cannot settle for anything less than
[48:45] that you can't settle for justification
[48:49] come on armed you can't settle for
[48:51] sonification you can't even settle just
[48:53] for the baptism of Holy Ghost but you've
[48:55] got to be willing to go all the way to
[48:58] add to your faith virtue and to virtue
[49:00] knowledge and to knowledge temperance

[54:06] 3/5 let's to come by the people Wow in
[54:09] your wing in your life now revive her as
[54:14] a definition he's saying he isn't adding
[54:15] new members to a church but it's
[54:18] reviving what you've already got revived
[54:21] means to bring back
[54:23] so a revival to bring back to revive to
[54:28] stir up isn't that right the Prophet
[54:31] said ëi said I stood here some years ago
[54:33] I said for the first time he said by a
[54:35] large body of water which was Lake
[54:38] Michigan I was used it was he was a you
[54:41] know Dean as a missionary any parts of
[54:43] shapes and so on he was about 20 or 21
[54:45] years old he said and he went up the air
[54:47] when they had some great Easter service
[54:49] and so on and he wanted to see yeah you
[54:53] want to see this large body of water he
[54:54] said it's the first time he saw
[54:56] something like that so he went out on
[54:58] Lake Shore Drive he study a little while
[55:00] ago he said I noticed all them waves
[55:02] jumping up and down and he said they
[55:04] were they were just splashing around so
[55:06] I can imagine the Prophet is his first
[55:08] time seeing such a large majestic body
[55:10] of water and he's observing it for the
[55:13] first time and he said it was just
[55:15] splashing around like that and he said
[55:17] and he thought to himself what what is
[55:19] so excited about what is all the
[55:22] excitement he said and the little waves
[55:25] would start and run out and then be
[55:29] great big waves
[55:30] and bounce into each other and break
[55:33] apart and then the phone would fly up
[55:35] and it will come back in and then I'll
[55:38] see the big waves coming in again and
[55:40] break on the bank like you're used to
[55:42] here he said but he said but that was
[55:44] something new for me he said a man is
[55:46] all right he said so he said well what
[55:49] doesn't what must it be he said well
[55:51] that Lake is having a revival
[55:54] he said that's must be what it is he
[55:57] said it's having a revival is now right
[56:00] it's having a big time he said it's just
[56:02] jumping up jumping down is now right he
[56:06] said and I thought what that's good
[56:08] that's fine he said but you know I
[56:10] thought well I wonder he said if it gets
[56:12] a lot of extra water when it's not a
[56:14] revival he thought he said no there
[56:16] isn't one more drop in it right now than
[56:18] if it was perfectly calm not one bit
[56:20] he said it's the same water he said it's
[56:23] just having a revival it's just jumping
[56:27] up and down when I I thought holily is
[56:29] nice
[56:30] well he said what good does that do he
[56:33] said come to find out that when it's
[56:35] having revival and jumping up and down
[56:38] like that he said it washes all the
[56:41] trash up on the shore he said that's
[56:44] what the church needs is a revival to
[56:48] boil the trash out of the church all the
[56:50] trash down in the seabed all the things
[56:53] you can't see up on the surface
[56:55] sometimes you got trash in your life
[56:57] sometimes you got some things growing up
[57:00] some things stuck up in there only I
[57:02] need some time to water laying little
[57:04] cow and just a little trickle here I
[57:07] thought that they'd never liked to keep
[57:09] you in that atmosphere don't get too
[57:11] riled up don't get too emotional now you
[57:14] just a real common and God will bless
[57:16] you but any time you get to move in any
[57:19] time you got to jump in any time you get
[57:21] to crying any time you get to screaming
[57:24] there's a reaction that takes place the
[57:27] trash all the trash that's in it begins
[57:30] to jump up on the on the bank it begins
[57:32] to purge it ouch begin to push it out
[57:34] why because as having always
[57:36] and that's what the church needs is a
[57:39] revival that gets you stirred up to get
[57:43] you riled up
[57:44] oh I'll never get you to call it out on

[1:01:04] mighty rushing wind coming down upon it
[1:01:08] again and reviving it we get ready to
[1:01:11] pray in a pre in a few minutes and
[1:01:12] getting all the world out and the things
[1:01:15] of the world out and the way then it
[1:01:18] starts and that way then it starts a
[1:01:20] revival and then it settles down the
[1:01:23] church and all its condition then start
[1:01:26] to get then to receive spiritual gifts
[1:01:28] and the blessings of God the Prophet
[1:01:30] said that's what we want is that what
[1:01:32] you want tonight it's not what you come
[1:01:34] all this way for is that what you
[1:01:36] believe in form is that what we've been
[1:01:38] longing for all these years a real
[1:01:41] revival a many man what we need for the
[1:01:45] roof what we need for a rapture is a
[1:01:47] feat that we never known before harder
[1:01:49] to take us up into glory
[1:01:51] it'll take a feat more than once you got
[1:01:53] tonight to take you up into the sky
[1:01:55] therefore we need power tonight
[1:01:58] and seven thunders give a speech to call
[1:02:00] for the power of God the Transformers
[1:02:03] from hallelujah from a word seed into a
[1:02:06] manifested son a man isn't her own he
[1:02:10] said I do not believe that a revival and
[1:02:13] we're looking to come it's gonna comment
[1:02:14] a fashion that we're looking for it he
[1:02:17] said it always comes contrary to what
[1:02:19] we're looking for
[1:02:20] he said on Christ come different John
[1:02:23] the Baptist and so on he said well if
[1:02:25] not if anyone would have thought he said
[1:02:27] I suppose that some of the interpreters
[1:02:29] of the scripture in John's day would
[1:02:32] have said well the voice of one crying
[1:02:33] in the wilderness prepare we have the
[1:02:35] Lord make his paths straight the Prophet
[1:02:38] said I imagine some of them thought God
[1:02:39] would slip the corridors of heaven and
[1:02:42] have an angelic escort coming down quite
[1:02:46] dramatic is enough coming down to the
[1:02:48] ground and having some great dignified
[1:02:50] prophet would come up walking out of
[1:02:52] glory he said and it was to be so great
[1:02:55] until this this ministry I was to come
[1:02:58] forward he said it would be so great the
[1:03:00] prophecy was that all the low places
[1:03:01] would be made high and at all the high
[1:03:04] places with me made low and the
[1:03:05] mountains would skipped like rounds and
[1:03:07] all the leaves were gonna clap their
[1:03:09] hands and so forth he said what an event
[1:03:11] it was gonna be or what the people must
[1:03:13] have looked to see in those times but
[1:03:15] what did they come to pass to be he said
[1:03:17] on all fuzzy-looking preacher with a
[1:03:20] sheepskin wrapped around him probably
[1:03:24] never took a bath every three or four
[1:03:26] months but he walked out of the
[1:03:28] wilderness prophet said standing up in
[1:03:30] the mud on his knees and hollering
[1:03:33] repent for the kingdom of heaven is at
[1:03:35] hand already he said that is when the
[1:03:38] high places was made low that is when
[1:03:40] the low places was made high when John
[1:03:43] come on screaming hallelujah a different
[1:03:46] name he wasn't like Hezekiah but I or
[1:03:49] any one of them he was John God called
[1:03:51] him difference he was eaten looks and
[1:03:53] wild honey he was a different man he was
[1:03:56] a renegade
[1:03:57] he said he acts is laid to the root of
[1:03:59] every tree you better bring peace Ellis
