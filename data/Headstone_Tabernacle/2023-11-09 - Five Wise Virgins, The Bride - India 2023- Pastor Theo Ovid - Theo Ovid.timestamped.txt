[13:40] churches and this type of
[13:44] church will be put out of

[14:04] prophesied that they're going to close
[14:06] down our
[14:08] churches we know that and we have a
[14:13] boycut but here it this he said
[14:16] Christian
[14:17] friends I am a
[14:19] man I can make
[14:22] mistakes but God cannot make a
[14:27] mistake listen to this
[14:29] now but before this boycott can
[14:34] come the marking of the
[14:36] Beast there has to be a
[14:40] seed swn for the church to take a church
[14:43] out of
[14:45] it so the prophet
[14:48] prophesy before they can close us
[14:52] down it have to have a
[14:54] seed in
[14:56] you to take you out
[15:00] now let me give you a
[15:03] guarantee not if the spirit
[15:07] Falls listen to this
[15:10] prophecy when the spirit
[15:14] Falls that there becomes a move among
[15:17] the
[15:19] people that they will swing
[15:22] together and the Church of God will be
[15:25] out put
[15:27] out Rome will rule the world for about
[15:31] one
[15:33] hour not

[15:41] world with the coroporation of
[15:45] protestantism he said when the spirit
[15:49] Falls the life of the
[15:52] seed but come not
[15:55] if so you today
[15:59] you pray God let that seed come into me
[16:01] I want that seed I
[16:04] want the
[16:06] rain
[16:08] manifest what is in the
[16:11] seed Oh Glory to God the most important
[16:15] thing is the
[16:16] seed praise God
[16:19] Amen here is
[16:21] question a
[16:24] question but
[16:26] Bram are the five foolish vers of
[16:28] Matthew 25 counted as a gentile
[16:35] [Music]
[16:38] Remnant I understand that the five
[16:40] foolish virgins were
[16:45] saved but had to go through the Great
[16:47] Tribulation
[16:51] period is this
[16:53] correct if so what will be their final
[16:57] destination
[16:59] could there be the Sheep which is
[17:01] divided from the goats in Matthew
[17:05] 25 then B begin to
[17:08] speak you say a
[17:10] woman will take a piece of goods cloth
[17:13] piece of
[17:15] cloth and takes a
[17:17] [Music]
[17:18] pattern where she desires and cut
[17:22] it the part that is left
[17:26] over is called the remnant
[17:30] so when the woman makeing a
[17:33] dress she takes listen she takes the
[17:40] material and lay it
[17:42] down take the pattern of the
[17:45] dress put it on the
[17:48] material I begin to
[17:51] cut what she cuts
[17:54] out makes up the
[17:57] dress the rest of the
[18:00] material is the
[18:03] remnant and that's what he said here
[18:06] now if you
[18:07] notice there were five foolish and five
[18:10] Vice
[18:12] virgins all of them
[18:14] virgins made out of the same
[18:19] material but by
[18:22] election God chose His B by
[18:26] election before the foundation of the
[18:30] world and put their names on the Lamb's
[18:32] Book of
[18:34] Life Oh Glory to
[18:37] God the foolish
[18:39] virion who didn't have oil in their
[18:42] lamp but cast into outter
[18:46] Darkness weeping and willing ning of
[18:49] teeth and that's the Great
[18:53] Tribulation oh Blessed Be of the
[18:55] Lord so then he went on to say further
[18:59] before the box is
[19:02] sealed the
[19:04] inspector have to check the
[19:07] box you have trains here in
[19:10] India so he was talking about a box
[19:15] car so you put the boxes in the
[19:18] car has a long journey to
[19:21] make so you make sure it's packed
[19:26] right no loose place
[19:30] and when it is sealed but it's
[19:33] packed it seals
[19:35] it so said this
[19:38] here the Box Car may be fully
[19:41] loaded but if it got loose places in
[19:44] [Music]
[19:46] it you have to pack it over
[19:49] again and that's what's the matter a lot
[19:52] of us don't get the Holy
[19:56] Ghost when the inspector
[19:59] comes he finds loose places in
[20:03] you and he won't seal You
[20:06] Yet now if you have never been sealed
[20:08] with the Holy
[20:11] Ghost you never receive your faith in
[20:13] him
[20:15] yet you got some loose
[20:19] places but when you get all those loose
[20:21] places back
[20:24] right then you seals
[20:27] you until the day of your
[20:32] Redemption glory to God glory to God a
[20:38] seal signify
[20:43] ownership I know in Western Days with
[20:45] horses and so
[20:48] on have a branding
[20:51] iron and they put it in the
[20:54] fire and when they hold that horse
[20:59] and put that brand on
[21:01] him the horse had to run and kick
[21:04] up
[21:05] fire but when it is
[21:09] finished he is
[21:11] branded and when God
[21:15] finish the devil will
[21:18] know whose son you
[21:21] are whose daughter you

[36:03] virgins both in the
[36:06] message both believe William
[36:09] Bram both have
[36:11] books both have
[36:14] tapes both have
[36:16] pastors but one have
[36:19] oil oil is the
[36:22] spirit in the Old
[36:25] Testament in the seals
[36:28] hurt not the oil and the
[36:32] wine oil and
[36:34] wine is always in
[36:38] worship and the wine is the
[36:42] stimulation of
[36:45] Revelation and Jesus said you don't take
[36:51] wine and put it in Old
[36:54] bottles and those bottles
[36:58] wasn't the kind of bottles you have
[37:01] today it was a lamb skin
[37:05] bottle out the
[37:07] skin and after a
[37:09] while when the skin get old and
[37:14] dry it wasn't
[37:17] flexible because wine have a power in
[37:21] it do
[37:24] ferment do Bubble Up
[37:28] will
[37:29] expand so the challenge
[37:33] is keep the oil in the
[37:37] skin and once you have
[37:39] oil in this lamb
[37:42] skin and God pour the wine on
[37:45] you you can
[37:48] expand you can lift your
[37:50] hand you can praise
[37:53] God you can jump a little bit you can
[37:57] walk hallelujah hallelujah why because
[38:02] you have
[38:03] skin oil in your
[38:06] skin I know the Holy

[38:25] seated we having a good
[38:28] time but this is
[38:30] serious you may be see said this is
[38:34] serious when you think about
[38:36] it precious sainted
[38:40] people missing the
[38:44] Rapture because no
[38:47] oil the pastors didn't Pat the
[38:51] promises the pastors didn't preach the
[38:53] word to the
[38:55] people
[38:57] so instead of the
[38:59] church going in Matthew 56 that prob we
[39:04] read Because listen if you hungering
[39:06] this
[39:08] morning you already
[39:11] blessed you already
[39:13] blessed because Jesus
[39:16] said blessed the
[39:19] day blessed that day that
[39:23] hunger and tast after righteous
[39:28] they shall be
[39:30] filed that is
[39:34] positive that is Jesus own
[39:37] words you're going to be
[39:39] filled listen to The Prophet
[39:41] now watch these two
[39:44] churches it just burns my
[39:49] soul these churches are clean and
[39:52] [Music]
[39:53] holy they're all virgins just as clean
[39:58] the only difference was oil in the
[40:02] lamp the Holy
[40:05] Ghost and the Holy Ghost if it is
[40:08] there hear this it will produce the same
[40:11] kind of fire it did on
[40:16] Pentecost we don't want no mother Holy
[40:22] Ghost amen amen amen amen hallelujah
[40:28] hallelujah
[40:30] hallelujah
[40:32] hallelujah de

[40:39] yesterday India P some Wicket out and
[40:44] good
[40:48] Wicket or some star batsman hit six they
[40:51] need four to win and need and hit
[40:55] six
[40:58] and you sit down there Bo good
[41:00] six I don't want to be your
[41:03] friend I don't want to be near
[41:06] you I want
[41:08] somebody that is
[41:11] excited to see that we cost six
[41:16] runs and we won the
[41:18] match and we
[41:21] shout we
[41:23] Rejoice because our country won
[41:28] but
[41:29] Jesus people on
[41:32] the he
[41:35] wants the Bible said let us
[41:40] rejoice and be
[41:42] glad for the marriage of the Lamb is
[41:46] come and his
[41:49] wife made
[41:51] ready you want to leave this place
[41:55] shouting
[41:58] you going to leave India
[42:01] shouting you will leave India praising
[42:04] your
[42:05] god oh glory to God hallelujah all right
[42:10] let's finish here now let's let's get I
[42:13] amam they have fine
[42:17] ceremonies but still that is
[42:19] wrong that's the kind that misses the
[42:22] [Music]
[42:25] rapture the same thing with the sleeping
[42:27] virsion and the wise
[42:30] versin he said you are a bunch of Holy
[42:34] Rollers Oh Glory to now a sleeping
[42:37] virgin and a wise virgin with oil in her
[42:43] lamp all of a sudden there came a
[42:47] sound behold the bridegroom come in go
[42:51] out to meet
[42:52] him and they
[42:54] waken and when they
[42:56] did this one could go
[42:59] in because they had oil in their
[43:02] lamps that was the
[43:05] difference this one could not go
[43:08] in where there was no oil in the
[43:12] lamp listen to these words now they went
[43:15] back to pray up to receive the Holy
[43:19] Ghost oh brother over you need to pray
[43:23] to receive the Holy
[43:25] Ghost
[43:27] Jesus said it this way he said which one
[43:30] of
[43:31] you would give a serpent to your
[43:35] son which one of you being
[43:38] evil how much
[43:40] more would God give the Holy
[43:45] Ghost to them that ask
[43:50] him if you don't
[43:53] ask you will not
[43:55] receive so if you want
[43:57] it you have to ask
[44:00] for Oh Glory to God hallelujah keep on
[44:04] asking until you
[44:06] receive so the prophet says watch
[44:10] this there was no oil in their
[44:13] lamps and they went back to
[44:16] prayer to receive the Holy
[44:19] Ghost and while they were
[44:22] gone they would
[44:24] say well maybe we were
[44:28] wrong maybe we better go back to seek
[44:30] for the Holy
[44:32] Ghost then the bridegroom
[44:35] come oh my oh my Hallelujah Hallelujah
[44:39] Hallelujah Hallelujah the wise version
[44:42] with oil in a
[44:44] lamb she was made ready and while the
[44:47] foolish went to get
[44:49] oil here comes the
[44:52] bridegroom oh my hallelujah praise God
[44:55] listen to The Prophet I'm going to wrap
[44:57] up but says now the reason that the
[45:01] revivals we are supposed to
[45:04] have we have had real
[45:06] [Music]
[45:08] stiring we have millions of of church
[45:10] members but not a
[45:14] Revival prophecy the
[45:17] bride hasn't had a Revival
[45:21] yet there is no
[45:24] Revival no manifestation of
[45:27] God to stir the bride
[45:31] yet we are looking for
[45:33] it it will take those seven unknown
[45:38] Thunders back
[45:40] there to wake
[45:43] up all of a sudden something
[45:47] struck to wake up the
[45:49] bride because the briag woman is
[45:52] coming and you have to be ready to meet
[45:54] him
[45:57] now watch this those foolish
[46:00] virgins once had oil you
[46:03] know but their oil ran
[46:06] out the wise
[46:08] virgin had extra
[46:11] oil so don't don't barely make
[46:15] it
[46:18] extra praise God praise listen what the
[46:21] prophet said if the churches would
[46:23] forget their creeds
[46:27] and forget their
[46:30] dogmas and take the
[46:32] Bible and plead the
[46:35] promise it would be effective to
[46:40] them when what does he mean when he said
[46:42] plead the
[46:45] promise you telling
[46:47] God lord you promised me the Holy
[46:51] Ghost you promise to heal
[46:54] me for my
[46:57] promise you promised to Quicken
[47:00] me you promised to break the world and
[47:02] everything has what God to do you ple
[47:04] the promise
[47:08] God andam said it's here we are
[47:11] finished he said what we seen happen
[47:14] here should put every soul in
[47:16] [Music]
[47:18] action it should make a
[47:20] church that will make a Revival in
[47:24] Phoenix and people will be flying from
[47:28] Europe to see what taking
[47:31] place they will say there's a place in
[47:34] Arizona called Maricopa
[47:37] Valley Valley a city called
[47:40] Phoenix Phoenix there is something broke
[47:42] out
[47:44] there until the seven
[47:46] thunders of Revelation
[47:49] 10 that's not even wrote in the
[47:51] Bible is being
[47:54] manifested oh glory to God hallelujah
[47:58] hallelujah let's go further we almost
[48:01] done five wives had all in their
[48:05] lamps they were all
[48:08] Sanctified but the
[48:10] five was wise
[48:13] enough to have the wisdom of
[48:17] Revelation to catch that
[48:20] door and be filled with the
[48:23] spirit don't let no man deceive
[48:26] you or fool
[48:29] you you must have the oil to go
[48:34] in you see these five versions
