a sign of what you will you you will do with each one of us this year Lord and all the rest of our lives Lord that we still have to spend on this on this planet may this be a day Lord that will never forget we thank you Father God and that's the blessing in Jesus name amen amen God bless you um remain standing all right um so I want to I I have so many scriptures actually um but I'll read I'll read the first one and then I'll let you sit down okay is that is that is that okay all right um excuse me um I'm sorry I'm getting a little all right don't be scared of the many scriptures okay just um by time I'm done you'll see the original eye and you can I mean don't even touch all of them I'm not likely to but when I finish you can go and preach the rest of it yourself okay no serious you'll find out all right um Saint John 6 verses 1 to 14 that's the one I'll read and then when you sit down I also read Romans 4 16 to 25. and Philippians 4 6 and 4th Thessalonians 5 18 I read the last three after you have shut down and my contact scriptures are first king 17-1-16 that's Elijah and the video of zaripat and Zechariah 4 6 to 10 don't despise the day of small things it's in Luke 9 25 the what is a man advantaged if he gains the whole world and loses on soul and then and then first came with each other six under six godliness with content man is great again amen so um while you're mentioning let me read Saint John 6 and verses 1 to 14. after this thing Jesus Went Over the Sea of Galilee which is the Sea of tiberias and a great model followed him because they saw the Miracles which he did on them that were deceased and Jesus went up into protein and there he sat with his disciples and the Passover a feast of the Jews was nine when Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he saith unto Philip When shall we buy bread that these may eat Jesus he didn't claim to know it or anyone because this things like this he gives the other person the feeling of importance a feeling that they they count their opinion matters you know because the Bible said he already knew what he was going to do so he wasn't deceiving them but he just wanted them to just the the art and the skill of you know managing the other person their different their differences their reality the different that may be different from yours and usually is so and this is said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do Philip answered him 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient to them for them that every one of them may take a little one of his disciples Andrew Simon Peter's brother said unto him there's a lot here which has five Valley Loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many and Jesus said make the man sit down now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down in number about five thousand and Jesus Took the laws and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that was set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would now this was a buffet they ate all they wanted all they wanted all they wanted so when you talk about the buffet old country and all that Jesus did it that's why it's coming from that old and this was without money without price so I was you open a buffet here without money without price forget it don't even try it people will go there they will put in their pockets and their food in their bags everywhere some of you here will do the same I know all right verse 12. when they were filled he said unto his disciples this is speaking about abundance from nothing to abundance from a proper to a King do you speaking about abundance when they were feeling disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost therefore they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with the fragments of the five Valley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten then those men when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did said these are the truth that Prophet that should come into the world Amen Let me see that Romans 4 and verse 16 through 25. therefore it is a faith that it might be my grace to the end the promise might be short to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who could net the dead and call it those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in Hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and be not weak in faith I'm going to try to show you how he was not weak in faith because many people naturally because faith faith comes by hearing the word of God but even many times when you have the word of God people still falter you and I all of us still do even Abraham did as really when the promise is not really doesn't seem to make sense or doesn't is lingering and he's not like you know coming to pass the way and when you think it should verse 19 and bring no weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead there are things he considered our things he did not consider because he considered his body dead that was dead he would not have faith just simple just simple deductions there so it wasn't like Abraham just some you know something just held into no he was human like you and I Flesh and Blood subject to the same Temptations like the Bible said of Elijah same thing exactly same doubt same when is this going to happen is not happening and all that same thing exactly but he learned because he was a friend of God like you have a chance to be a friend of God now to walk with God and God can speak to you from his word like he spoke to Abraham Abraham didn't even have the word didn't have the Bible he had to depend on a relationship with God but you have the Bible you have the preaching you have the words you have the prophet to let you know how to hear from God so but Abram had been taught by God how to maintain his faith and be not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead it wasn't like the body was dead dead the body was not a state a ship to give forth a child at all so if he considered that how is he going to believe you consider that the body is dead I just gonna believe it's it's a tougher thing to believe it'll just be struggling against you know what his reality is telling him but the thing was don't even consider that in the University of Harvard and all these other Great Schools University of Lagos forgive me I don't want to use your school so that you don't feel bad at me or wherever you went to school they'll tell you that doesn't make sense well this is the school from above amen so this has nothing to do with what man thinks of one Marathon too many times we complicate the simple I always say we over complicate this you know we don't just complicate we over complicate the simple things all of us do may you all of us do and it's the first way out of it is catch ourselves and know I got to move away from here so Abram had been taught by God how to like maintain faith amen you considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sierra's womb inconsiderate at all and because he didn't consider it his Target not at the promise of God through unbelief because he consider it all the upcoming so it didn't even amen so even you can hear from God and still have unbelief because you are considering the wrong things the things you should not consider are the things that maybe possibly your conscious that's what many of us know many times I was in our self-talk our talk with ourselves all the time we're considering the things that we should not consider so he's tagging another promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith given glory to God so there are two sides here one side you consider it and then you get unbelief one side here you are given glory to God and thanking God so the two sides there foreign his persuasion gets got stronger and stronger and stronger until he became fully persuaded and being fully persuaded that what God had promised he was able also to perform and therefore it was impeded to him for righteousness just gave it to him are you with me yeah just because Abram knew what side what to consider want to look at and God saw him the way he was God just gave it to him Abraham wasn't righteous none of us is righteous it was imputed it was given to him like okay you are righteous because of this he got the results he was looking for because of that night was not written for he's sick alone that he was impeded to him but for us also [Applause] to whom it shall be impeded if we believe in him the rest of Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification amen First Kings I know I think I'll leave that that's my connect scripture Philippians 4 and verse 6. for this lands fight all right Philippians 4 and verse 6. be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving that your request be made known unto God fourth thestellians 5 and verse 18 in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you in everything give thanks and the good times the bad times and when you understand when you don't understand at the beginning of 2023 on January 2nd 12 noon 12 a.m January 4th January 20. in everything give thanks for this is the will of God amen amen so we actually can walk in the will of God all the time by just being thankful just been thankful and so that's why we are here this morning I didn't want to use the word Thanksgiving service so we have things very first Sunday of the year and then the rest of the year is no thanks even no Thanksgiving is every single minute of every single day amen [Applause] all right okay okay um I have a title here which you know remember the benefit of the message a thinking man's future and a holy man stage he said he got it from the box of a cigarette and you know so he explained that to you so Mattel this morning uh I'm sitting on the Gap and again I was probably the beat to the emperor for that but but it's not my I didn't originate the the phrase I didn't I did not but I I saw it from an author and so this makes sense this makes sense and I see it all through the Bible because that's what I see in the Bible anyway so so this is my channel but the concept the Gap and again is not mine so a disclaimer so all right so um so my title is are you living in the gap or are you living in the game I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to do today because I wanted to play different with the brand I'm just out of the year just like we did last night and um and you know I have another prayer line from the prophet or something so but then two days ago I felt a lot you know I felt I felt the leading to go this direction so I I trust it'll be a person to me because I'm praying for me so I trust you you'll find some blessing in yourself also so anyway um so once again a most blessed and happy New Year uh trust and pray that it will be your very greatest year ever amen so the Gap and again is a very very follow me closely and I'll try to just talk so you because I think this is very important and is it I mean it's a topic I've been speaking on I'm well not exactly but it's related to because this principles of Life are interconnected because you're from God so but I think this is very important for you to understand what we're talking about and if you are able to it will you know cause a little shift in your thinking like I mentionology I'm using a little shift in your thinking amen so is he because no matter what your brain tells you if it doesn't happen on the inside of you you are finally losing battle use you don't start a fighting chance if your soul the thinking on the inside doesn't you know I agree no matter what your brain and your flesh tells you you're not going to get so the important the big man in the house is the man on the inside and it's the one we want to get is by in in everything we hope to do and achieving life and every single area of life family home Church walks business career great corporations you got to get the buy-in of the man on the inside because God said man is only a living soul the soul on the inside is what lives out so when you go to work it's a soul that goes to walk when you go to school it is when you are angry is the soul that's angry amen a man is only a living soul so the gap on the gaining is a very simple but very powerful principle of life that's veiled and hidden in the scriptures and explains why so many people and stupid was here many times you and I many times miss our blessing and never reach the high levels of success and achievement that we desire in most every area of Our Lives even our Christian lives our natural lives because my insistence is the same principle that runs Allah because you are one person and you are interconnected so Superior Body one person it's not like you have one side for school one side for church no one side for home one time for work you are the same person and really how you do anything is really how you do everything so you have because you're one single person so not uh if you understand this concept here you'll understand and see why many many people including you and I many times miss their blessing and never reach the high levels of success and achievement that we set out to achieve in every endeavor you get married you just this is going to be the greatest marriage in the world you know it's going to be written about in the Bible when they write the Bible again they're not planning to you know but just making a point it's okay but then you know your wife does something you get angry and you start thinking what's this here Oh I thought you said he's gonna be the greatest career I'm gonna I'm gonna write my name and goal here and then things don't go away and then you'll feel like what's going on here I think I made a mistake I think you see we're going to be the pin the Stars you know I mean paint the town right or let this child's shout your name because you don't understand about the concept of the Gap and again now most people are very unhappy and that's with us because we can experience that we all experience Happiness and happiness and the problem it really is the way the measure their progress ion that's the problem that's the problem if you understand how to measure your progress you'll find sadness and unhappiness disappear so the problem is how they measure their progress that's why most people are happy and it's a simple reason because of the way they measure their progress now you know in life every even every single time in life every single action you take you are trying to go from point A to point B you're trying to go from here to there and so there is like a um something to get you from here to there I wake up in the morning I want to go to the bathroom to take my bath my bed is point a about to miss point B there's actions I have to take between 0.8 and point B and all the way down like that everything in life you can put into into it first of the year you're sleeping already it's a brother all right I didn't mention his name so I said brother all right so anyway so if you only know how to measure progress so measurement is a big deal many times victim many times and of course you know that's a Bible thing that's not a mathematics thing until they come to the measure of a stature of the fullness of Christ it's a Bible thing and the The Pretenders in the world only take their cue from the Bible even though they don't recognize God that's where they take it from well let's leave that alone I don't want to get into the measurement thing let's leave that alone so so when I get annoying my goal is to go to the bathroom and so there's a gap between where I'm starting from and where I hope to end up at so that's the Gap but when I leave let's say I live in my house I live on the on the on the seventh floor of my house and then my bathroom is on the 12th floor so I have a journey over three floors I mean five floors to get my bathroom so when I go from floor seven to nine I have gained to two steps I've reduced the gap so I have gained two flaws and I still have a gap of three floors are you following me so that's the Gap and again so sock says or failure in almost every area of Our Lives depends on how we measure this Gap and again and it's all real and hidden in the Bible and I'll try to show you I need to keep the top of my time so I don't um by the way I forgot that you know after the service like I already announced it yesterday Friday Friday that we would have like a you know Thanksgiving Fellowship but thanks means every time really you don't understand but you might finish day which not that you don't know before but your I think you can maybe explain to yourself a bit more finish day so we have a fellowship and just just some very very light refreshments and don't be angry that I thought they were going to give us a buffet I was talking about a buffet no not today not this morning not today not a buffet today maybe next time we'll do a buffet not today so just a small life refreshment but what I want I don't want you just go rush home no don't do that don't do that don't do that I'll get into that in the success of failure series that I'm getting into the child coming to the age of accountability don't do that because you will not get to the unity of the faith without the unity of the spirit even those those even those who upset you and annoy you and you can't stand them and passion of the program for you to come to a Unity of spirit energy of the spirit first before you get into your faith so so don't go don't go don't run home just turn around and especially look out for somebody you haven't seen because since we came back in March we just come and then we're rushing back to so look around and see somebody you are you having Fellowship for some time man and and chat with them for a few minutes before you head on back home she don't be disappointed if you just give you a bottle of water and say that's it so don't miss the point okay all right so what happens many times in life is that we set up with this great you know desires and what we want to achieve and what we want to get and like at the start of a new year everybody writes their New Year resolutions what they want to achieve for the year and all that and you'll find out that Target is the ideal when I get that I'm done I'm I've ticked off number one I've done it number two I've done number three I've done it but for many people many people it's a dream is a mirage knowing what a mirage is when you are going in on the on a hot sunny day and you'll see the road it's like there's water there and when you get there you find it's also moved ahead again it's like a moving moving Target and that's what life is for many people the target is just moving that is just moving and because they don't understand the concept out to want to focus on what to consider and what to not consider they just get more and more frustrated every single day in life and godliness in their private lives in their personal lives with their finances with their health with their relationships with their career with every area of life just just a moving Target and because we are measuring ourselves against that moving Target we feel so unfulfilled and because the moving Target is always Out Of Reach just like a mirage is always Out Of Reach and it just becomes like it's a dream it's not real it's those who get there is some law cause some happenstance that just happen to them but it's not but it's not so let's um before we get into getting the findings of it let me just also say that when we measure ourselves against this elusive moving Target we're leaving in the gap but when we measure ourselves against our previous cells we're leaving it again you're a Christian and you want to live for Jesus Christ if you're here today I'm not adopted yet I'm not adoption hasn't happened yet and the devil is telling you things in your mind that you are not doing you are not overcoming yet and that's your focus you're living in the gap and you'll never have success living in the gap you'll never it's not it's not uh to wish those things we know but it is a certain mindset to to to address and recognize and identify the Gap but also you want to live in the game that's how you can address the gap amen as we started this new year that's my lesson for you I mean that's my that my message to you let me get to my conclusion before I even get started I want to tell you today periodically everyone here if you're making some effort you actually are achieving more than you actually give yourself credit for the only problem why you think you are not is because you are measuring yourself against that objective the ideal that you are going for and once you don't have that yet you you feel very sad but think about your Christian Life what do you measure yourself against in your Christian Life you measure yourself things are different now something happened to me when I gave my heart to Jesus things I Loved Before have passed away things that love far more have come to stay in your Christian life you are giving yourself like I have men making progress you are not breaking your head against the world that you're not adopted yet in the Christian Life to be really successful you live in the game godliness with contentment is great game [Music] again is a Bible word it means profitable it's Bible it's God amen and in the Christian Life is your mind is not focused on gain spiritually in all your endeavors you are not going to make a success of this Christian Journey now there's something in all areas of your life amen someone challenge you as I I'm coming to all the way to the back now that periodically set back as a matter of fact I can do it every day or every week every month text talk of all that you've achieved no matter how tiny it is naturally spiritually and you will be shocked at how much you have actually achieved that's what this song says count your blessings name them one by one and it will surprise you What the Lord Has Done I say brought me why you are just trying to you're just what you call the wine I just want to remind me you know number whining I'm preaching the world I'm preaching the word of God I'm not whining you I'm preaching the Bible and I'm not doing no motivational stuff on you I'm preaching the word of God and I'll show you now this is how Jesus lived this is how Moses lived this is how Abraham lived this is how Elijah lived these are any successful person in the Bible live [Applause] thank you [Applause] so while you are here feeling unhappy with yourself unhappy with your children unhappy with your boss unhappy with everybody not the unhappy circumstances are not around you no I'm not trying to be an unrealistic person or people say I'm a realist and you live in that realist mood I mean realist no I'm a realist too but I don't live there says that thanks to Calvary I don't live here anymore I hope today you'll change where you live so you stop living in the Gap and you begin to live in the game and you'll see what the Lord has done and how transformative it is amen glory to God Amen because simply you aren't able to appreciate your progress no matter how little because you are busy measuring yourself against your target your goal or your ideal because you haven't got there yet you feel so so bad and your discontinence whatever little advancements you have made I'm going to ibadan I got stuck in traffic on the expressway and I'm all upset I'm all upset I'm going to Nature I'll get stuck I'm on the way to ore and I'm I'm feeling bad no oh thank God we meet Lagos in it's one of the traffic made it in two hours okay we'll we'll get to Nature also are you leaving in the Gap running again he's dangerous to live in the game you never achieve anything with it Israel in the wilderness they came out they came out they were baptized in The Wretched to Moses in other words they went through the Red Sea of redemption blood now you are here today you've passed through the race of redemption for those eyes lived in the Gap every single time their focus was where's the promised land I thought you said it's just that way even when the children I said what those Giants are too much for us they just live in the Gap all the time and because of that they wept they were sad they were they were bitterly like this is this is one chance this gospel is one chance we have been full and deceived into believing this year so because they lived in the Gap what they did not have yet the the perish in the wilderness don't live there it will kill your desires it will kill your dreams it will kill your hopes it will kill your aspirations it will kill your marriage it will kill your career it will kill every sin living in the gap [Applause] Eve that's where all started from she had so much going for her and she only had one thing that was not there yet just a little Gap just a little Gap just a little Gap and Lucifer understands because the serpent brother Venom taught us the the the the the Lucifer could use a serpent because someone under understood the issues of Life issues that were again issues issues and I'll show you how they get formed not today some brother is still sleeping another brother another one the bus wasn't too much in soccer watching Ronaldo and his move and all that [Music] all right boy gentlemen I'm so sorry thank you all right so about the missions if you want to go to her she's gonna you can that's fine all right so so Eve Lucifer the serpenter is Shifting and focused from the gain all that she had going for her to the one single thing she did not have going for her one single thing that was missing and she lived in that and dwelt in that and like they say the rest is history living in the Gap and living in the game count your blessings as that's my inspiration count your blessings name them one by one one by one don't just put them together no be very specific count them one by one even if all you have is God he woke me up this morning seventh on the morning he didn't have to do it but he did I am thankful Lord I can raise my hands I can get off of my bed I'm thankful to you Lord isn't that enough to thank God for even if that's all you have to thank God for because many went to bed last night they couldn't wake up this morning or they couldn't get up this morning so there's a lot to thank her for they'll say oh that that is normal no it's not normal no don't don't have an entitlement thing God don't owe you to wake you up the next morning Hallelujah he woke me up this morning seventh Sunday morning he didn't have to do it but thank God he did say thank God he did amen you maybe see that [Applause] so you can know you can see right away from Eve and all the other examples if he has a major example as a major case study how dangerous how destructive how powerfully negatively destructive it is to live in The Gap the gap my wife didn't do this this is what your wife all the other things about her leaving the game about that but I thank you Lord I have a wife I thank you Lord that I think I think the problem is a lot of these brothers are spoiled Frankly Speaking so they don't even appreciate the basic thing because they grew up knowing how I I don't I can't cook I can't I can't cook anything I'm not proud of it so absolutely for everything if a grain of rice I can I don't even know how I anyway no I'm not I'm not saying I mean I I'm I'm great I'm not saying that at all I'm not saying that I'm just seeing like that so many little little blessings like the song for me and Johnson used to sing for the many many blessings that's the song Right many many many many blessings I feel my life is divorce of a blessed who told you that who told you that we told you that [Applause] the devil telling you that to drag you out of that zone into the Gap and when you get in the Gap it sinks a hole you can go in there amen now I'm not trying to put you happy I mean if you want to sink in your hole that's fine but I'm preaching the word of God too like I always say to the two three percent who believe what I'm telling them amen amen [Music] so leaving in the gap and living in the game let's see the life of Jesus as we quickly run through now this story we read you know Jesus had this this campaign the people came and then he preached to them and healed them and all that and when he was close to even time he was like too late for the people to go away and find some food and go to their homes so there was a problem a dilemma here you can see it was a big deal about that they just saying the Wilderness well it's like you going to uh um let me know say something that looks like I'm I'm joking I want to say like you go to uh you get to talk between um already I've been in at 2 am and um you know you have to walk all the way or you stay in some secluded place and on the way where you are protected and somebody says like I said I will let them go and find food to let them just walk you know just walk around so that's what this app was did so there's a problem here that was a problem here so this happens like most of us were simply living in the gap they only saw they need they only saw the problem they only saw the challenge they only saw the difficulty they did not see a single problem I mean a single solution inside none of not like not one faint hop inside no one felt hot inside disciples did that just like Isaac did father Where is the lamb for the sacrifice he was living in the Gap Abraham was in the game because he had the experience because that's how you came Isaac he said God will provide for himself a sacrifice even before it happened all that you don't have to have God speaking to you the Bible tells me so thank you [Applause] so the shop was only saw the problem the need the gap there was no solution in sight and this really was a very very pretty tougher and challenging insulation to be in from their perspective and really it was having five thousand men and women besides children and partner men besides women and children could have been six thousand seven thousand eight thousand nine thousand in that place and the people who are hungry and they need to be given food they knew that they still need to find something to eat so they focused on the gap on the need on The Challenge on the difficulty on how things are not working well that's why people make all these New Year resolutions and they don't it doesn't last one week because the focus is just no longer they haven't been taught what not to focus not what not to consider like Abraham you considered not it's not what to consider what not to consider is as important even much more so than what you consider because all he said was Abram considered not he didn't even tell us what he considered until later so when you're focused on the gap on the problem on the difficulty you will see only problems and was not working you know that from Eve shift her focused that's how powerful the negative focus on the Gap is shifter Focus from all that she had going for her to the one single thing God kept away from her and that was also for our own good but when you are in the Gap you listen to a different narrative that's not going to serve your purpose so when you end the Gap you'll see no Solutions even if the solution is hiding in plain sight and in plain sight like in the acceleration the solution was there Hard In Plain Sight they just need to look a little bit once it doesn't you just jump into the gap and then you say God doesn't do God doesn't do and you Endeavor is telling your heart of hearts this gospel we're just going through it it doesn't really work it works every time what's every single time [Applause] but when you leaving the gap and even when the solution presents itself because you are in that Gap thinking that's what your mind is all about that's your thinking pattern just Gap thinking even when the solution shows up you reduce the solution to insignificance insignificance [Applause] imagine if Jesus was in there that I said what what uses these five laws and two fishes what uses it uses it and the grace of almighty God provided those Five Loaves and two fishes and human beings living in a narrow war in a small world just reduce God to that and say nothing imagine if Jesus was in there but thank God the grace of almighty God hey Glory I'm just seeing you it's the glory god bless you God bless you glory bless you bless you get to see you bless you imagine if Jesus wasn't there so be sure that Jesus is with you all the time or you throw away many many blessings many many opportunities because you are so fixated living in the gap living in a wall of luck in a world of warmth in a wall of nothing works here oh yeah that's your scripture that it doesn't really work in the real world well I wish you all the best I wish you all the best of course I'm not preaching I'm not talking I'm not talking to you I'm talking to those who know like that God this war itself was created by the word of God the word of God hung the universe in space so how about your own turning you are too inconsequential Amen brother you are too small God's word it works every time everywhere under any condition it always works always works you may be seated Oh Glory are you falling out story amen [Applause] because we're living in the Gap even when Solutions came to them that they could just give to God and give thanks it was too small God wasn't doing what he promised he will do he wasn't meeting the expectations they make themselves God and they want this God in their image who will do the things just the way they want him to do it and once he doesn't do it that way their Spirits sink and you see people who stood out higher and when they get to a certain age they feel like yeah I'm older now so I understand all those things about me one the use of attending those people they are just for small children when those kids no they have said in here in this church before some are saying it now I mean I know I know I I hear what goes on hearing good years what is oh yeah when this event grew up they were funny like that the real world is different all right go on living in the Gap I'm teaching my people how to snatch success from the jaws of failure amen welcome to 2023. amen welcome welcome you are gonna find out [Applause] as we go on you are going to find out your lives will be transformed like you never knew before like you never thought was possible amen glory foreign you don't see a solution Jesus asked him what should I leave you to eat you may be seated he asked them feel it he's probably was a financial problem so we don't have the money we don't have enough money how many times you and I do that how many times you do that we don't have the money [Applause] don't laugh don't laugh so no no no no no we can't do this no money we don't have the money you think you are new no see that but the man who kept preaches all these things here like that and when you ask him to help you some money he said he doesn't have the money how does he experience to carry out what we what do you say we should do Jesus told them to go and look for food but you not give them the money because my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Christ Jesus Hallelujah thank you let me see that [Applause] [Music] no I think I'm I'm not taking too long okay but I'm taking too long but this is my New Year message to you a Thanksgiving message so you know in everything to give him thanks amen Glory you may be seated [Applause] so Philip's problem was we have no money 200 penny worth that's like saying like twenty thousand dollars or twenty thousand dollars even if you have that here where is the place to buy the food whole country is closed the chicken Republic they're closed is late unless you go to lekki where they had them 24 hours and even that by the time we buy food for 100 people they're done for the night well I mean just doesn't make sense this Jesus just say something really let's be real between you and I just some really stupid things sometimes you know just between you and I say some really stupid things just doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense at all thank you how many of you have missed your day of visitation miss your opportunities because you say if only I had enough money I don't have the money so it's not if Jesus wasn't there insisting that go and look for it they would have given up we don't have the money and that was having it and they would have missed this great event how many good events have you missed in your life because you say I don't have money and you just resign in you just you just you just you just uh um Retreat into a place of a a place of defeat because you don't have money foreign he doesn't let you do that [Music] so before we condemn Phillip many times you do that all right Andrew Andrew [Music] at least they tried the other ones did not even company since you you can even understand what he's saying you you go and talk to him it just it just doesn't make sense I mean but if I go to tell him Michelle that you are always you tell me that you're always you're only challenging Authority so I don't I mean I I don't want to get on his case just you since he thinks well of you you won't tell him of course you know that happens you know you know what I'm telling the truth you know it [Music] Andrew he saw Five Loaves and is there a little lad here little light just small boy I mean in other words food that will fill a child is what we're talking about if he was a giant man we can even be talking about real real sizable food but this a child's food like like you just have a baby's feeding bottle and you're talking about food for all these people here when you live in the Gap you belittle the things of God and that's what many people do I'm not being funny even people who come and say like that oh the church that church there just belittle the things of God because their hearts are in the gap and away when they got the devil fills it up he fill it up for Eve filled up for Eve well that's another story let me know let me go there so Philip I mean Andrew he despised the day of small things Zechariah zikaraja before I don't think I read I I I think I I gave you my contact scriptures the great chapter 4 is talking about this zeruba Bell and all that bodies said who had despised the day of small things despite the day of small things how would you know that you and I here said that as a little seed little sick little button of small things and because of that you miss your visitation many times many times Andrew dispersity of small things why because of a mindset that fixated on the gap on the difficulty on the impossibility on how it can be done and that mindset can do nothing but belittle every small but possible solution that tells you in the uh in the um in the criminal wall like you don't you follow the leads you don't you don't you don't disconnect any lead it may be a small drop of blood that's where you don't have to be a large pool of blood they know that you don't disconnect any small thing don't despise that day of small things and because of that will suppose went into they were not ready for anything to disturb their comfort they went into a a wall of send them away so each man can go friend for himself one must we feed them why must we feed them is the church the place to feed people from is this place the place went from must they come to this place to our house whatever it is office whatever whatever all right and right away if they were dealing with Jesus how is that for telling me away at two o'clock in the morning in the morning let him walk to Benin from already themselves and find them on the way what happened to them it didn't matter [Applause] your senses your connection to God gets dulled you are not sensitive anymore you are only responsive to the environment in which you live that environment where is tough nothing is going on buhari and all of that crazy stuff is my wife if only my wife will behave yourself if only my children will be there this is my husband will be if only the pastor if only the beginning they got on my case and all that just live in that world [Applause] send them away friends how is that for Let each one of you bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ amen wow [Music] so here the disciples had you know exhausted Lord we've tried send them away the Bible said Jesus knew a solution was there because he said the Bible said he knew himself what he was going to do so the solution is there wherever you are whatever so um let me announce you the solution is there is hiding but is hiding in plain sight amen can you say Amen [Applause] bless you Joanna and see let's see Jesus he came they're talking about disruption he discovered everything that could be disrupted there's nothing there's nothing new Under the Sun this is from the Bible Jesus Disturbed their theology so but every they served there or destroyed their mathematics destroyed their financial destroyed everything why didn't he destroy neither morning he had a bank in the sea he said Peter he provided the money but Peter Sila to go get it it will provide the money for you but you should have to go get it so Peter go under the sea I mean go when you I'll tell you but go and do some do get some fishing skills and the first fish that comes out that said get it money a fish Bank a fish Bank fish Bank tell the financial expert they said that you are crazy that's that's it that's a myth that didn't happen you were daydreaming it disrupted the food industry with this year it destroyed the medical industry where they just pick a one and people get here people raised from the dead it was a disruptor it was a disruptive influence Oh Glory to God that's the god that we serve and he's the same yesterday today and forever he's never fail me yet it is never filled me yet Jesus Christ has never failed me yet on everywhere Rigo I won this world to know that my Jesus Christ has never failed me yeah yeah Hallelujah and it's not about to start feeling you because one thing is impossible for God to do is God to fail he cannot fail and charity never fail and that's gone you may be seated [Applause] Celestial Joanna and see Jesus I handle the thing do you ever live in the Gap let's see someone living in the game amen [Applause] Jesus unlike disciples focused on the gain is your focused your focus is very important I mean I don't want to get into all that focus is very focus is very powerful as a matter of that's what guys in Direction life Focus Jesus said if you I be single it's only my focus Focus was shifted a little bit a little bit those of you who drive you know many times just shift your focus is 50 seconds you can run into a vehicle you know that focus is important very massive just a mind shift yeah not some great angels I know just you might just need to shift your focus a little bit here today shift your thinking amen has been talking about all these past few months so Jesus he was all the time focused on the game he was focused on gratitude he was focused on Thanksgiving he was focused on magnifying the Lord with me and let's exalt his name together it was focused on magnifying amplifying the little things God has done amen the disciples almost you know rebuked him for living like that for the mining solution that didn't seem to exist anywhere but Jesus was focused on again and looked for a solution because he knew it was there every speech every action that Jesus made was directed toward finding a solution here they're not looking for a solution to cause more trouble just not looking for solution at all when you do that you are missing your purpose in life we were sent here to provide Solutions Adam was sent here not to walk it was the work was providing a solution because the problem was there was no man to kill the ground So Adam was sent here and he provided the solution that God was looking for and we are paid in this life in direct proportion to the solutions that we saw for people and the quality of ways we solve the pollution for them we solve the problem for them that's what work is if your work is not solving the pollution not not solving a problem you are just going through the motions laughs I don't want to get into all that so let me just leave that alone but I think the point is made so anyway so Jesus was certainly gained while these guys who are focused on the Gap without a solution in mind Jesus knew in the game he'll find the solution for what's left of the gap thank you so while you are focused on the problem looking for no solution Jesus looked for lived in the game and he looked for search for and highlighted the solution no matter how little he Amplified it perhaps the Lord will work for us today amen the disciples on the other hand they allow the circumstance to shape and dictate and control their narrative and their worldview which was always to see the problem intractable unsolvable and never see the solution because they were living in the gap amen Jesus I keep saying lived in the game that's our model another example and I'm saying are you living in the gap or in the game that face everything in your life every single the natural spiritual in church name it oh that church all they're doing that you'll never find a perfect Church you never if you're on that search I wish you all the best is it sick don't need a physician not the healthy Jesus said so this year is a is a sick day we come to be healed every single time all of us all of us you show an example of a Christian that was in Gossip you show an example of what they're not doing that you think they should do you should be that example you be the king like they say the change that you're looking for amen yes you can amen [Applause] so Jesus living again and I was always looked for and on and always look for and saw the solution to the problem no matter how little no matter how little no matter how little oh I want to start out that I want to start that that career or whatever and I don't have money and then you should you sit back I don't want to get that so you're something I'm just talking about those those natural things so talking about everything everything or like your wife like my wife just always this is yeah that's the Gap are you living there or is there something about this wife that you can thank God for is that something about this wife that is even worthy of the gratitude to God oh you're brought us on the job he makes your life rough I know I know I know I know I know it but there's so many about him that you can just live in the game Somebody by him and somebody about that office that job that you're in while you are still there the principle of life if you want achievement in your life you gotta you got to find the secret how to live in the game anoint the god amen wow you have some chance today [Applause] all right so Jesus because he lived in the game he recognized the Gap is still there God told Joshua Joshua you are getting all and there's still so much land to be conquered so we're not living like in denial here no and what do we do about this problem so I'm only being realistic you don't know what I'm going you don't know you have no idea no all these things you are saying I've tried it before it doesn't work all right I don't even I wouldn't get scared when I had to talk like that when people feel like that and people feel that way so Jesus didn't he recognize the problem but did not leave in the gap the circumstances to the difficulties he didn't let them shape his perspective on worldview the narrative he spoke to him because you're talking to yourself all the time a lot of self-talk we talked to ourselves about 10 times more than other people talk to us on a daily basis I can't remember the figures now talk to yourself constantly so many thoughts that come into you you explain to yourself and most of it is negative because many human beings are just perfected out of living in the Gap and they give them their reasons why they must live there and then they do not achieve they feel frustrated they're angry and all that and they feel like that what's going on here because that's what you chose to do because you are a product of your thoughts your thinking [Music] see that's it that's what you choose to do God gave you that control totally totally yeah but Jesus know the seed of living in the game and when you live in the game you begin to see I'm making when you have gained the same look that are that that I one of my current scriptures said what is the man advantaged if he gain the whole world gain is all about advantage [Music] when I have the advantage over you I have the gain over you that's what happened in Eden when you live in the game you see advantage gain his advantage Jesus was just saying that advantage that man has he's not going to fetch him anything because he just had to his soul but gain his Advantage so when you leave in the game you are living a life of advantage and you have seen he's done so much for me I cannot tell it all and then you start naming them one by one count your blessings one by one my but what we do we believe to that we believe two things as as waking up in the morning that's nothing that's that's nothing big deal I come to church I go to work and I go there strong heal no acting on the way as if those who left their house I'm gonna hit by a car in front of the house they are sourcing us than you and we just don't we are so starchy in our ways that until we get some money in the pocket before we can thank God you will likely not get there and if you get there God's grace but you will likely not progress so much more if you don't understand this principle of living and again and living in the gap three percent might struggle their way through because they have so much will power from majority of you and I will not be able to even manage it so so living in the game gives you Advantage what's the advantage you see what God has done what the Lord has done for me I cannot tell it all I can't tell it all on a daily bit I cannot tell it all I can stand on my feet I thank you so much as that what is that well that's nothing for you is everything to me [Applause] that can raise my hands I can talk oh Hallelujah [Applause] living in the game unless you see the value of the advantage of being thankful living in gratitude living in Thanksgiving when you leave and again you will be thankful because it's so much that he has done for you oh Hallelujah when you live in the game gratitude and the giving of thanks will be a part and parcel of your daily living your daily existence your prayer life becomes transformed you don't just say Lord Lord please uh bless me please no you are saying Lord I Thank you that I can wake up I can raise my hands I I even have a job I think it's a stupid job I don't I don't appreciate but I still have a job look I have my family I have my dad my mom not I can breathe before you get to the other specifics that he has done for you rather than rather than marriage god with what he hasn't done for you oh Hallelujah Hallelujah living and again living in gratitude thanking God gratitude thanking and praising him in everything giving him thanks in the good times the bad times thanking him living in the game oh Hallelujah Glory and so Jesus living in the game he gave thanks he knew what was going to happen when you're living again you know it's going to happen Jesus said they said we found Five Laws and two fishes and two fishes just bring it to me and say firstly set them down and sell them in companies because it's beginning to rain so tell them in companies they are going to have food now sell them in companies let them sit down and they did that set them in 50s by companies you have a company not my words the Bible you have a company set it in order it's beginning to rain it's going to rain the economy might be your home it's going to rain you may be seated [Applause] and so Jesus he gave thanks for the Small Things even a little boy's meal that some despised don't let anyone Define you by what they think maybe see that [Applause] some feel sorry for you is thanking God for that you know that he doesn't he doesn't understand the big life yet that you I thank God for every small thing I thank him for hiding me in the night when you went to bed last night where did you go to do you know where you went to of course you don't know what brought you back out of there those who went to bed and didn't wake up are they all Sinners than you know the grace of God is it not to thank God for oh Hallelujah Hallelujah 2023 we are going to have a Hallelujah a harvest of Thanksgiving every single day every single day we're thinking in the morning thank him on the bus going home thank him in the evening time thank him thank him in our sleep take him every time in the good times and the bad times I got to thank him for life for friends for family for church for the word of God for our souls we're going to thank him Hallelujah over here amen oh my let me try and find my way to begin to wind down here Jesus unlike disciples they give what they despise he he took it and gave thanks for this even the small simile insignificant blessing [Applause] he counted His blessings he named them one by one oh Hallelujah oh this something this film is too massive to feed Phantom people and you are thanking God for Five Loaves and two fishes they said how is that among so many just belittle the solution that God is providing for you Jesus said I hear you I hear you sit down and I say you maybe see that there's a food is coming food is coming food is coming let them sit down give me the Five Loaves and two fishes and what did he do Lord I thank you I'm living in the game that we even have these flowers and two fishes Lord is coming to thank you for even if only two little children manage to eat this Lord you have done well that we can even find food at all we thank you Hallelujah that we can find food at all we thank you we praise you oh Hallelujah when you're living again you'll be thankful your life will be a testimony of thankfulness and gratitude and Thanksgiving amen and as you do that you are going to get into a harvest of testimonies every single day oh Hallelujah Jesus thank God for this seemingly small and insignificant solution to such a massive and huge problem we thank God amen my young young woman I know some of you are tired you never tell me I know it maybe she did [Applause] she will get tired but whatever it is just make sure you have Jesus in your boat for examples were exasperated searching for a way out of this Quagmire that they were in just because they follow this gospel this man here and we are following us to make food big big brick from straws make make big bricks from straws don't get tired amen Oh Glory amen now listen as I'm trying to wind down [Applause] the miracle the solution laid not in the Five Laws of the two fishes what that's what you're going to understand the remarkable was not in the Five Laws and two fishes no man the miracle was hidden in the Five Laws and the two fishes your Miracle is not in the small insignificant no your Miracle is hidden in that small insignificant something that you were talking about [Applause] and you have no idea who was hidden in I'll show you a few examples from the Bible so the miracle the solution lead not in the fabulous and the two fishes no the miracle laid in the given of thanks [Music] that's where the miracle laid in the given of fangs and as he gave thanks the miracle that was hidden in those five notes began to force their way out [Applause] the given of thanks was the conduit was the pipeline that the miracle needed to cut his way out [Applause] if Jesus did not know that's just a lord this this is all you gave us well it's okay just the given of things you understand what the Bible says to me in everything to give thanks every single thing to give thanks because we don't do that we hide our Miracles are hidden away from us many times the solution to simple problems that we have I know from us many many times in everything give thanks every single thing whether you understand or don't understand give him thanks [Applause] the miracle late in the given of things because he gave it on things open up the way the pipeline they conduit for the blessing the miracle that was hidden in the Five Loaves and two fishes to come out oh my the Five Laws and two fish were only the conduit I mean the the the the the the the warehouse for the for the food for five thousand you have food for five thousand think Elijah's blood like a man's hand think the ladies with humans a vial of oil of meal on The Crucible think it Michael is always hidden there but takes gratitude on Thanksgiving to bring out the culture amen don't be like these apples so bogged down with how things are just not working till you just you you can't even respond to what I'm saying and I'm showing you from the Bible and I won't let you go I'll show you some more examples let me let's meet Jesus first let's meet Jesus Christ amen so the food for the five thousand I said was hidden in the Five Loaves and the two fishes but that food would only come out of his hiding place through the giving of things gratitude that's why gratitude and giving thanks is so powerful it's so powerful because it releases the blessings to you it removes the the damn it breaks them open amen amen glory amen the food for five thousand the miracle of the of the feeding the 5 000 lead hidden I would only find expression through the Avenue of giving things through the Avenue of gratitude to the Avenue of thankfulness to the Avenue of Thanksgiving Hallelujah glory to God and the same way your Miracle Your solution lays in the game so it's not about this game you're talking about it's just a small thing no it's not about that it's not about the size of the game look in the Bible it's not about the size of the game it's not about the size of your blessing that you have you can you can you can identify up till now no it's not about that Five Loaves and two fishes that was the game that only showed them God is here moving [Applause] but he was there is this was a secret that small blessing that small blessing is warehousing your bigger miracle amen now his sister is sleeping wake her up man he's a young girl too wake up wake look around with your friends up okay all right the devil doesn't want to get this I know I'm taking long but they're going to get this uh I'll I'll be done shortly just forgive me I'll be my shortly wow so your Miracle Your solution Liz in the gin let's enjoy Five Loaves and your two fishes and when you mix that up with gratitude count your blessings one two three and thank him Lord I look maybe he's a small thing but I'm magnified the Lord with me let's exalt his name together Lord I Thank you I praise you I bless you I thank you when you do that amen so your Five Loaves your own Five Loaves and two fishes plus gratitude will lead to your Miracle which looks Your solution will lead to the power that will power you over the Gap that's remaining and take it to your expected end oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord oh my [Applause] so here is the great secret of the story of the gap and again the secret count your blessings the secret mix that up with your gratitude with thankfulness with Thanksgiving Hallelujah mix it up no one just say Lord you did this one this is going to do for me no he did it for you thank him for that I mean yeah my dad my dad my mom yeah thank God for your dad and your mom my son my daughter yeah the headache thank God for your son and your daughter [Applause] Thanksgiving holds a secret to all of God's miracles and the same way holds a secret to your miracles the solution that you're looking for whatever it doesn't matter what is a principle whatever it is you're looking for so stop complaining and start living in the game stop complaining stop living in the gap instead of leaving in the game and thanking God counting your blessings every single day you just can't wait you you can't you you can't you can't pile it up you want to thank him every day for it you want to thank him every day I want to thank them every day every single day and if you open your eyes you'll see them you'll see them all around you you must say it's small it's small nobody said blessed thank God for me [Applause] it's not the size of the game the The Miracle might be hidden inside there amen I will question about show you one or two examples too but what I'm saying here yeah beginning to take stock and count your blessings every single day and you'll be amazed at the Miracles at the abundance that will overtake you you'll be amazed Jesus showed us here they not only ate they had leftovers they didn't just eat like like you know we'll give you just a little live refreshment today or even just a bottle of water no they act like they come and just like this young people just come back and say I want some more I want some more I want some more I want some more I want someone until they are staggering and they are daddy amongst it my friend you are Glutton come on everybody to live for a fool and then they had 12 baskets left over what does that speaking about speaking of abundance is a god of abundance we limit him we limit him we get in our situations and leaving the Gap and we are sure like that that's the way to go but well if this is not speaking to you I'm not speaking to you either because from the inconsequential Five Loaves and two fishes Jesus he told them he wanted to let them know he said Gather because he was just he wanted him to see how abundant it was a gather together gather together who took them but I not so many years ago that some Pentecostal group said that um that the 12 disciples each one took one basket to their homes [Applause] so you get you get those baskets and give the pastor one you know so there's no you don't have those things we can get any you can anything in the Bible you know you can you can type it so and and of course if that's the elevation it is correct it's going to be I mean you can't disprove it the 12 disciples said the 12 troubles gather them up so so they didn't throw them away he said so that nothing will be lost so who took them [Applause] thank you you'll be there complaining the disciples are having a basket each at home all right all right let's let's try to close out I really am sorry but I want you to get this here but what immediately is a god of abundance I have come that they might have life and they might have it more abundantly your work is too small come on children you live in too small a wall [Applause] you're living too small a world you may be seated David said thou prepare us a table before me in he told Abraham I will bless you and you will be a blessing that means the blessing will overflow from you to others is a god of abundance get away from your small thinking and from it [Applause] big things amen you may be seated oh Hallelujah Hallelujah he's a real God isn't he oh no wonder we're enjoying in the Bible Amen to be careful for nothing is the word of God be careful for nothing how many of us can manage that because we just we are careful about everything everything worries us everything worries us the Bible the word of God said be careful for not some things for nothing [Applause] just learn to live in the game knowing that your father he holds the moon the sun he hangs them out in Space by his word surely he can take good care of you and me can he not oh yes he can [Applause] you can can I use it all yes he can oh Lord I thank you you can take good care of me Hallelujah surely you can take good care of you and may God start it all in control oh hallelujah amen because we are taught to give thanks in everything for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you and the secret is you may be seated your daily miracle lays in gratitude and the giving of thanks and you can only do that daily grateful living in graduate every day you can only do that as you deliberately and consistently live in the game and not in the Gap you refuse to do it you refuse to live in The Gap amen Joshua and Caleb the reality was the Giants were in the land Joshua said don't take me there I saw them they're there but I'm living in the game if God be with us we shall they shall be like bless hope us to us living again so don't do that's your reality that's why you want to live don't don't pull me in there and you can see a noise talking about this nonsense all these all these years yeah that's that's that's why it hasn't worked for you [Applause] because you are not living in the game yourself you have one foot in the one foot in the Gap and you have one food in the game a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways [Music] Glory Glory oh my this is going to be quite a year gonna be quite a year I'm telling you gonna be quite a year I just feel it in my bones I feel it in my balls brother I'll feed it in my bones amen amen Brothers [Applause] sing praise God oh yeah oh let me let me let me run and close that you maybe see the Glory Glory Glory oh Hallelujah amen so as you're leaving the game that's where you can see what is what you have gained what progress you have made you may be seated and then you can begin to thank God for it and then you can begin to see your daily miracles oh you see your husband changes ways you see your wife change your ways you see your children change their way you see your balls you see that cranky colleague on the job change their ways because you refuse to live in The Gap you are living in the game oh Hallelujah The Secret of all successful people in every area of life is they have learned to live in the game and on the Gap studies studies show that the most successful people that's what they do and that's why you see people who are very endowed who are very ambitious they just don't move because they're just chasing this moving Target and they're not getting and they change the moving Target because you have a wrong mindset towards the gap Jesus recognized there's a gap here but he's not living there you leave the mindset of achievement in the Gap just like you as a Christian today there's a gap we're not adopted yet but you have a mindset here you have become a good work in you shall surely perform it until the deal you know you are getting there if you don't think you are getting there you will not get there that's why people are there people live in the Gap and say in the church this year brother Brown I don't believe it I don't believe that they're living in the up and so that's why they leave that's why they don't that's why they leave when you are like that and we can't admonish you by the world there's nothing anybody can do for you nothing just your choice but when you live in the game like like Ruth you say where you go I will go where you Lodge I will Lodge your God will be my God in the good times in the bad times then you are on to something good something good is about to happen to you because Jesus of Nazareth is passing your way Believers are this Jesus is passing your way oh Hallelujah Hallelujah and nothing stays the same when he passes by difference when Jesus passes by oh what a difference what a difference it makes hallelujah oh Hallelujah amen The Secret of all successful people in every area of Life business church ministry politics whatever is the learn to live in the game and on the gap maybe seated I don't think those guys playing tennis playing tennis and they they are they are one one one set point down one match point down from finishing there are two sets down and they are once one match point set game and match point away and they still go back because they're not focusing on the on the point they're gonna lose no if you do you will know you're out you are out right they are going back into their Inner Strength their mental toughness I can make it I'm gonna make it no it's just one point here is not going to pass me I'm gonna return the ball you are returning the Bible before the opponent serves the ball [Music] leaving him again is the advantage you need to power over the gap living and again and being grateful and thankful for it every day is the advantage you need the power you need to power over the gap oh again gives advantage amen and I'll just uh get a few examples and we'll we'll close out for all my Abraham Elijah Moses let's see what we can learn from them Abraham Romans that we read together the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith are you stood there he was strong in faith because he had much no no he has a secret he was strong in faith given glory to God Glory Thanksgiving Glory I glorify you I praise you that was Abram living in the game he refused to consider the deadness of his body he refers to him in the game and with the gratitude see there you have it Abraham's secret of that kind of faith for 25 years was gratitude because he was living in the game he was counting His blessings and thanking God for his Blessing so far let me tell you something about Abram that um but look at what showed me about oh I was talking about the other day just to take him into a picture Abraham you'll be father many nations around 25 years nothing came nothing and his wife was 65 and then she became 90 and that's when you go for nominations but he didn't you know now Abraham did not consider it she said well that's like a story no you write your own story what are you what do you know because if you consider it will weaken his faith so 25 years this child came oh thank God no the children are going to come now I'm just going to come in plenty the Bible said Isaac was 40 years old when he married Rebecca are you following me so Abram from Abraham's perspective it was 75 so as it came when it was 100 25 years then he saw Isaac 40 years old he didn't even get married this boy here go get a wife so that the promise can come to pass come you can come to pass but I like the kind of parent Abraham was but let me leave that alone so all the all the nonsense anyway forgive me let me know I'll get to it but not today not today I'll get there and then the Bible said when I saw Abraham said oh so God thank you this this for he said in Isaac shall that seed be so so we expect Isaac will just have these children like 12 children 15 children 20 and then the children would just would just be like a geometric progression like that and then he waited 20 years 65 years 40 years 65 years after the promise only one child came how do you think Abraham failed God this promise of stars in the heavens like the sun on the seashore this this message well and then as you finally got married at 40 she thank God the babies are going to come now and the Bible said for 20 years Rebecca was barren 25 to 40 to 20. that after the promise was into Abraham 85 years only one child only one child maybe five years put yourself in Abraham's shoes and see how great you'll be jumping God is fulfilling This Promise we were in exactly the same spot many times but Abraham's tiger nut refused to be dragged into the the Gap and when the babies came it was two boys add that to Abrams 75 plus 75 plus 2500 plus 40 when I got my 140 plus 21 Eureka had the boys 160. and then when it was 160 years old he had these two so three now three after 85 years three children and we're going to populate the whole Earth [Applause] Bible said Abraham live and and saw Jacob and Esau for 15 years Abraham that I won 75. but put yourself there put yourself there so what's the problem God came for his word or you are living in the gap or you are not waiting on God and what are you what's the problem here because God's word never fails never fails never fails no I refuse to accept that refuse I I just don't flow with my understanding of this theology here amen so Abraham refused to be dragged into the gap and stayed in the game and work stronger in faith every day why would you not work strong and feel that way when you see every single day Lord I saw how job before I got one day brother go can I were going home many many things he keeps you from and we're going and a policeman just stopped us on the way around and throwing shovels on the way and you know okay Dodge just getting a um area quite uncommon and all that so about 30 seconds you let us go as we were going as we got on to Anthony I mean Anthony onto ikodu road in front of us if we were 30 that person would have been in front of us a truck just fell over if not for those 30 seconds we would have been right under that vehicle right under it [Applause] okay as a matter of two or three Witnesses so how many many things so that's why you are waxing stronger and further every day because you'll see more and more and more every day don't belittle the greatness of God he's a great God he's a real God he's a mighty God Hallelujah is the Mighty God of Israel he's the Mighty God of Israel so there you have Abraham's secret gratitude Thanksgiving thankfulness that's why I was strong in faith that's why I was able to stagger not now the promise of God he was living in the gain he was counting His blessings was thanking God for the blessings amen up to the present moment amen because his victory to power over the cup that remained his victory amen laid hidden in the game lead hidden in the Thanksgiving his Miracle LED him in the Thanksgiving oh brother amen glory to God Amen I'm almost done amen amen let's speak Elijah on the window of zaripath just to show you right here amen that was Elijah was a man of like passions like we are so we had doubts like you and I that's again of course you know like the God I'm the only one nobody else believes this message here I'm the only one in my school and everything so yes Elijah got depressed and went under a tree on some Junior Elijah man like you and I so what story are you right they wrote their story what story are you writing accountable amen Elijah on the Widow of zeropath farming there will be no no rain for three years and six months at my world so there was farming in the land and God told Elijah I will I I will provide food for you in the farming years we have the largest message spiritual farming spiritual food induces and brother Branham called it but it applies to even your natural Endeavors too it's a place to it amen the scripture they drag on the farming represent spiritual family represented a bad government represented a recession and they're predicting the U.S is going to have a recession they're predicting it I mean for next year and one you know once America catches a cold they don't even need to copy it one America has to hold the whole world just whatever so it's coming things are going to get multiple tighter yeah so although whatever Nigerian elections say is doesn't it's going to get hurt it's not going to change even if you choose the right person it's going to be overnight no it's not going to be it's not going to be no it's not going to be but in spite of that in spite of of what was going on in Egypt God's children were protected somewhere in Goshen like devotion like paradise the fire did not tell them were in Paradise waiting for the missile to come so God said by the Brook charity I have the ravings to feed you now wait a minute wait a minute God for real like you guys would say Raven to feed me food that sounds like the Five Loaves and two fishes for five thousand Ravens what's Raven a raven gonna do how much food are they gonna bring me in the morning and in the night how much food are they gonna bring me but no Elijah and one thing about Ravens too Ravens are very selfish Ravens don't share their food they don't so God went to the most difficult Birds and talk to those Gods I want you to get enough food for Elijah morning and night every single day and it's grateful for him [Applause] and when that season was over God said come in the city now I have a billionaire to send go to their house and you provide you food there no no it's not even your husband and wife no a widow woman Five Loaves and two fishes he said I have commanded a widow woman there to feed you [Applause] and when Elijah went down by the spirit of God like where is our Elijah he went and went like on Jemima but the Panama went and saw the woman two crosses how would Elijah have known she was at the point where she was just gonna eat and die foreign she was living in the Gap but he had came Deliverance like to you this morning stop brings destruction he brings failure brings lack it brings you nothing [Music] when Elijah came on the scene he saw the woman he was gonna go listen to her brother Branham I can see hot sunny afternoon and see him coming [Applause] what about him he said make me a cake first bet me a cake first the woman looked bakery cake that's why I say those adults there maybe there are some adults who hid their food in that in that place because that's what the adults do big Mickey will say ah Bros this food is only enough for me and my son there are many adults in that place who they're looking for food please they're looking for just please just any food no no we are not here no no no don't you think you're 10 lies no no I mean they're asking for extra food for everybody else I only have enough of myself but Elijah said woman big she was living in the gap that's how many of you do when you live in the Gap you are just so filled with the luck mentality you you have a victim mentality there against me they're coming at me it's me alone they are getting at me and I just have a lack victim mentality [Applause] when there's abundance all around when there's an oasis of love like the song that have fun and voices of love there's food for the hungry he says abundance all around how could that woman know in that one barrel of meal and the crush of oil in it was hidden food that will last her for three and a half years how would she know [Music] so it's not the size of the god because in there it's just a warehouse for the blessing Elijah said I understand you are living in the Gap but I'm telling you of a more excellent way come in again I'll tell you go bake me a cake first he said no just myself there's no death here there's no luck here there's no negativity here the holy spirit is in the camp Jesus is on the scene get me a cake first and she obeyed I hope you obey today no no no I must be a big make cake for us no no no no no no that wasn't making cake for sure you don't bring me cake I don't even eat them so don't don't bring Medicaid but I'm just you get my point right all right trying to say something no I'm not saying anything nothing I'm not saying anything no I don't want any cake no I don't bake me a cake for us like some brothers in Trinidad years ago they wanted to do Elijah they wanted some shop you know China they eat Roti they eat Roti so they went to the store and the people were trying to they just said there one of the brothers I met him in the states in 83 and he he is my favorite Was Elijah he was the message and backslide and I think he has a mental thing so he had a chain like Elijah's Mantle a chain very heavy chain I saw him I even have a concern with him 83 but you had this big chain there and like some ropes and so he went to this store here and said bake me a roti first because it was Elijah baked me already for us he said what if you don't get out of here we call the cops on you say big they drove him out of there Elijah first and she obeyed and was going and it was when she was going in other words Elijah was teaching her was tutoring her to how to stop living in the Gap and leaving the game and she changed her perspective I will do what the word says I will do what the prophet of the life of Elijah says I will go and bake the cake and as she was going for the sake of the Lord the power of mute shall not waste nor the cruise of all fail thus share the Lord and I said today your vial of meals shall not waste neither will your Crews of warfare if you learn to live in the game with graduate on Thanksgiving every single day one more example I will go home Oh Glory Glory Hallelujah [Music] Glory Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] oh my [Applause] here [Applause] what was it friends was the moral here what's the lesson here Elijah told this woman amen the focus on the game plus gratitude will multiply the solution the literally you have in your hand like the song that the two David sang what do you have in your hand what do you have in your hand amen Elijah taught her the value of appreciation the value of gratitude for what she has in her hand for what God has done for us for the little things of Life The Little Blessings of life amen and the value of that and not what she doesn't have what somebody else have and you don't have and he belittles God in your estimation amen um because Elijah told her that she switched her mind and took on the advantage of living in the game oh Hallelujah from the advising her favor to begin to live and again shifting her mind away from the Gap and into the game shift the man away from what she did not have to every little blessing because you know it's not the size of the blessing he takes a beggar I make him a king the bigger doesn't have to be like the one who is that head of Beggars first and then the the chairman of the biggest station no no How could a meal the Bible says for and she and her house her son and Elijah ate until the farming was over and the drought was over three and a half years in a barrel of meal and a cruise of all one barrel and one Cruise like fabulous it was hidden there so it's not the size of the little thing God has done for you no [Applause] is your gratitude that pulls the miracle out oh Holly let's make 2023 a year of Thanksgiving every single day and they will have a harvest of testimonies you will have to have a successful with every single day oh Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] Elijah told her that and later understand the value of what you have in your hand what is I ask you this afternoon as I'm finishing the clothes what is in your hand what do you have in your hand what do you have to thank God for but he hasn't done anything for you at all what has he done for you tell me one thing he has done for you let's sit down List It count your blessings pennies organists count your blessings amen like Moses they cry of my people and I have come down to deliver them and I'm sending you Moses that joke and please if they joke God I'm sorry to say about you know everything but me too God you know now with all those drones that will fish me out from wherever I am uh God please said what do you have in your hand and say God please the joke the joke the joke is making you serious what I have in my hand this stick ah I get that's right Pastor Sean says the staff that's right that's what the Bible calls tough Pastor Sean that's right I told him he's going to preach one of these days he said sure it's still it's still the closer we get to the preaching the the father he gets away from it so perhaps so he has a staff in his hand said God to him that stuff here in that stuff is hidden the power that will overtake and bring down the lone superpower in the world at that time for us is a story but for Moses it was something he lived and your situation right now what do you have in your hand what do you have in your hand oh Hallelujah [Applause] so I say what do you have in your hand identify what he has done for you that's what you have in your hand and if everybody has done for you and thank him for it and in there you recognize the Gap that's still there and then you set out that's another topic today a plan from the word of God how to go over with gratitude go over that Chasm or that Gap and come to your expected end so I ask you as I'm closing are you living in the gap why are you living in the game count your blessings name them one by one and you will be singing as the day goes by as the days go by God bless you listen to everything Glory happy New Year welcome to a phenomenal year 2023
