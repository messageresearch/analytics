[29:08] to that's will be the service tonight
[29:10] amen so we want to go to Numbers Chapter
[29:13] 13 and Galatians chapter 4 for two
[29:15] portion of scriptures
[29:21] tonight numbers 13 reading from verse 25
[29:24] to 30 and Galatians 4: 1: 7
[29:28] numbers
[29:30] 13 and they returned from searching of
[29:33] the land after 40 days and they went and
[29:36] came to Moses and to Aaron and to all
[29:39] the congregation of the children of
[29:40] Israel unto the Wilderness of paron to
[29:43] Kadesh and brought back W unto them and
[29:46] unto all the congregation and show them
[29:48] the fruit of the land and they told him
[29:52] and said we came unto the land with thou
[29:54] sentest us and surely it flow it with
[29:57] milk and honey and this is the fruit of
[30:00] it nevertheless the people be strong
[30:04] that dwell in the land and the cities
[30:06] are wed and very great and moreover we
[30:09] saw the children of anoch there the
[30:12] amalekites dwelt in the land of the
[30:14] South the Hittites and the jebusites the
[30:16] amorites dwell in the mountains the
[30:18] Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the
[30:20] coast of
[30:21] Jordan and Caleb stilled the people
[30:24] before Moses and said let us go up at
[30:27] once
[30:27] and possess it for we are well able to
[30:31] overcome it Galatians chapter 4 now I
[30:34] say that the heir as long he's a child
[30:37] differ nothing from a servant though he
[30:39] be Lord of all that is under tutors and
[30:43] governors until the time appointed of
[30:45] the father even so we when we were
[30:48] children were in bondage under the
[30:51] elements of the world but when the
[30:53] fullness of the time was come God sent
[30:56] forth his son made of a woman made under
[30:58] the law to redeem them that were under
[31:01] the law that we might receive the
[31:03] adoption of sons and because ye are Sons
[31:08] God has sent forth the spirit of his son
[31:11] into your hearts crying Abba Father
[31:14] wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but
[31:16] a son and if a son then an heir of God
[31:20] through Christ let's bow our heads
[31:21] father we thank you for your word
[31:24] tonight and we invite you to come and
[31:26] breathe life into that word father we
[31:28] are facing a critical hour a critical
[31:31] time but you promis this word to open up
[31:33] in such Clarity that we could know who
[31:35] we are where we come from and where we
[31:37] going and whose we are Grant father that
[31:40] you would come among people and bless
[31:42] them and pour out your spirit upon their
[31:44] hearts and lives in Jesus name we ask it
[31:46] amen and amen you may be seated praise
[31:49] God blessed be the name of the Lord do I
[31:52] hear a shout in the house hallelujah
[31:55] praise God you are alive
[31:59] glory
[32:01] amen hallelujah oh praise the Lord you
[32:04] are alive alive unto God Amen praise the
[32:07] Lord blessed be the name of the Lord you
[32:10] love him this night amen have a title
[32:13] matured ripened seed Sons to be made
[32:18] manifest that's my title matured ripen
[32:21] seed Sons to be made manifest I a
[32:24] subject if a son then an air of God
[32:28] through Christ amen that's my subject
[32:31] and have an Inspiration Go possess
[32:35] overcome it Hallelujah all these are
[32:38] instructional words go possess overcome
[32:42] it blessed be the name of the Lord
[32:46] praise God now the Amplified of
[32:48] Galatians 4 says now I I mean as long as
[32:52] the inheritor is a child and underage he
[32:56] does not differ from a slave although
[32:58] he's the master of all the estate but
[33:01] he's under Guardians and administrators
[33:03] or trustees until the date fixed by the
[33:06] father so we when we were miners were
[33:10] kept like slaves under the rules of the
[33:12] Hebrew rituals and subject to the
[33:14] element teachings of a system of
[33:17] external observation and regulation but
[33:19] when the proper time had come God sent
[33:22] his son born of a woman born subject to
[33:25] the regulation of the law here we go to
[33:28] purchase the freedom of or to Ransom or
[33:33] to redeem or to atone for those who were
[33:36] subject to the law that we might be
[33:39] adopted and have here we go sunship
[33:42] conferred upon us and be recognized as
[33:47] God's sons and because you really are
[33:51] his sons God sent the Holy Spirit of his
[33:54] son into our hearts crying out father
[33:57] therefore you are no longer a slave
[34:00] which is a b servant but a son and if a
[34:03] son it follows that you are an air by
[34:05] the aid of God through
[34:09] Christ oh blessed be the name of the
[34:12] Lord wonderful oh praise God Amen praise
[34:15] God do you love him amen so you are no
[34:18] longer a slave a born servant but a son
[34:21] and Jesus came to call out Sons he came
[34:24] to identify Sons oh blessed be the name
[34:27] of the Lord so I have a little team
[34:30] hungering after
[34:33] righteousness and the passion to become
[34:35] a manifested son this is taken it now
[34:38] Beyond church membership this is taken
[34:41] about you going to church and you're
[34:42] coming you love Jesus and believe the
[34:44] calvary This Not That now this is taking
[34:46] it beyond that this is you having a
[34:48] desire in your heart some for the first
[34:51] time to become a manifested son you
[34:54] don't just want to be a Son of God you
[34:56] want want to be a manifested son you
[34:59] want to understand that you are heir of
[35:01] God if you are son then you have an
[35:03] inheritance am then you have a portion
[35:07] oh that's why you could go up at once
[35:09] and possess it because it belongs to you
[35:14] it wasn't revealed to you yet but it
[35:16] belongs to you whether you know it or
[35:18] you don't know it still belongs to you
[35:21] because whatever the father have is
[35:22] yours this it belongs to you and the
[35:26] Bible said g say we are well able well
[35:30] able tell somebody next to you we are
[35:32] well able tell them that we are well
[35:34] able tonight to possess it to P what it

[35:41] died for you are well able to possess it

[36:04] devil don't want you to know but you
[36:06] were raised up to be Sons and Daughters

[36:12] beast of the field Hallelujah you were
[36:16] called to be in His image and likeness

[36:20] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[36:23] Lord hallelujah glory to God Luke 9:23
[36:28] Jesus said If any man will come after me
[36:31] let him deny himself take up his cross
[36:34] daily and follow me oh Hallelujah the
[36:38] Amplified and he said to all if any
[36:41] person will come after me let him deny
[36:43] himself disown himself forget lose sight
[36:47] of himself and his own interests refuse
[36:52] and give up himself take up his course
[36:55] daily and follow me which is to cleave
[36:57] steadfastly to me and conform to my
[37:01] example in
[37:02] living and if need be thine

[37:09] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[37:11] His might there is no scripture say be
[37:14] weak in the Lord be struggling in the
[37:16] Lord there's no scripture that said that

[37:22] power of His might put on the whole
[37:24] armor of God that we may be able to
[37:27] stand against the wise of the devil and
[37:29] somebody was sharing with Paul was
[37:31] seeing all the Roman shoulders in their
[37:33] armor seeing them and he take it and
[37:35] bring it a description for the Christian
[37:38] to put on the whole armor for We R not

[37:52] you may withand in the evil day oh glory

[39:01] struggle has to be daily so brother B
[39:03] said no wonder Jesus consider the lies
[39:06] of the field how they toil neither do
[39:09] they spin but yet I see Solomon in all
[39:11] his glory was not a raid like that and
[39:14] the Lily was revealing Christ and how
[39:17] lily Pastor Lily he said Lily he gets
[39:20] down into the valley the dark place and
[39:22] he push himself up through the darkness
[39:24] of the earth to do what to glorify
[39:27] himself to glorify everything that comes
[39:29] in contact with him he has to toil day
[39:32] and night to keep his Radiance of beauty
[39:36] to keep the perfume flowing he has
[39:38] pulled day and night from the Earth to
[39:40] give out here we go that's what a real
[39:44] Christian does we not talking about
[39:46] church member now we talking about real
[39:49] Christians you pray one humble yourself

[39:56] order in order that you might give
[39:59] yourself to somebody
[40:01] else it is not what you keep it is what
[40:05] you give that counts you must give
[40:07] yourself out to others and that's the
[40:10] way Jesus did he gave himself unto
[40:13] others and that's why perfect eternal
[40:15] life is when you can live for somebody
[40:17] else when you're not looking for I me
[40:20] and myself and what you could get but
[40:22] what you could give oh praise God

[54:42] that boy was taken out and was put on a
[54:45] garment and a ceremony and that boy was
[54:48] placed into the family that he was born
[54:51] in and that's the matter with the
[54:53] Pentecostal today they jump here they

[1:26:58] you appreciate a pastor tonight amen
[1:27:02] amen so just for a short thought just a
[1:27:06] few minutes to midnight so I'm not going
[1:27:07] to be too long with you but I do have a
[1:27:10] short thought for the season and to
[1:27:12] usher in 2017 so if you have your Bibles
[1:27:15] we turn with me thank you musicians I
[1:27:17] certainly appreciate all of the specials
[1:27:19] and it's certainly a great privilege to
[1:27:22] be back home so I want to read from
[1:27:25] Hosea chapter 6 Hosea is the book just
[1:27:29] before the Book of
[1:27:31] Joel Hosea chapter
[1:27:34] 6 and also from Philippians chapter
[1:27:38] three for context
[1:27:42] tonight certainly want to welcome all of
[1:27:44] the visitors we want you to feel very
[1:27:48] welcome and very comfortable in his
[1:27:50] presence and the thing about God he
[1:27:53] makes you feel comfortable and he also
[1:27:55] makes you feel a little
[1:27:57] uncomfortable because when you begin to
[1:27:59] look at your life you have to ask
[1:28:01] yourself the question do I measure up to
[1:28:04] the word so we want to be comfortable
[1:28:06] and a little uncomfortable welcome and
[1:28:08] feel a little welcome amen So reading
[1:28:11] from
[1:28:12] Hosea uh chapter 6 and from verse one
[1:28:15] come and let us return unto the Lord for
[1:28:20] he hath torn and he will he us he hath
[1:28:24] smitten and he will bind us up after 2
[1:28:29] days will he revive us in the third day
[1:28:31] he will raise us up and we shall live in
[1:28:34] his sight then shall we know if we
[1:28:37] follow unto know the Lord his going
[1:28:39] forth is prepared as the morning and he
[1:28:42] shall come unto us as the rain as the
[1:28:45] latter and former rine into the earth oh
[1:28:49] Ephraim what shall I do unto thee oh
[1:28:52] Judah what shall I do unto thee for your
[1:28:54] goodness is as a morning cloud and as
[1:28:58] the early due it goeth away therefore
[1:29:01] have I hewed them by the prophets I have
[1:29:03] slain them by the words of my mouth and
[1:29:06] thy judgment are as the light that goeth
[1:29:09] forth for I desired mercy and not
[1:29:12] sacrifice and the knowledge of God more
[1:29:14] than burnt offerings but they like men
[1:29:18] have transgressed the Covenant they have
[1:29:21] they dealt treacherously against me
[1:29:24] Gilead is a city of them that work
[1:29:26] iniquity and is polluted with blood and
[1:29:30] as troops of robbers wait for a man so
[1:29:33] the company of priests murther in the
[1:29:35] way by consent for they commit lewdness
[1:29:39] I have seen an horrible thing in the
[1:29:41] house of Israel there is the whoredom of
[1:29:44] Ephraim Israel is defiled also oh Judah
[1:29:47] he had set an Harvest for thee when I
[1:29:50] returned the Captivity of my people and
[1:29:53] reading Philippians 3 and reading from
[1:29:56] verse 13 Philippians 3 or last scripture
[1:30:00] reading and reading from
[1:30:02] verse
[1:30:07] 13 Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:30:10] apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:30:14] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:30:17] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:30:19] which are before I press toward the Mark
[1:30:22] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[1:30:25] in Christ Jesus may the Lord add a
[1:30:27] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:30:29] may be
[1:30:31] seated amen can we give the Lord a hand
[1:30:34] of Praise we just a few minutes before
[1:30:37] 2017 so just for a very short thought
[1:30:41] tonight it's return unto the Lord and
[1:30:46] for a subject recognizing your day and
[1:30:51] your message amen and for an inspiration
[1:30:54] forgetting the things that are passed
[1:30:57] because the only way you can forget the
[1:30:59] past is because there's something else
[1:31:01] to hold on to so we read the scripture
[1:31:03] where Paul is saying to the Philippians
[1:31:05] Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:31:08] apprehended in other words he's saying I
[1:31:10] don't count myself to really understand
[1:31:12] everything that's going on but this one
[1:31:14] thing I do forgetting those things which
[1:31:17] are behind and reaching forth unto those
[1:31:20] things which are before I press towards
[1:31:22] the mark for the prize of the high
[1:31:24] calling in Christ Jesus and I believe if
[1:31:27] there's anything you understand tonight
[1:31:29] is you have a right you have
[1:31:32] a an opportunity tonight to forget the
[1:31:35] past to forget this year to forget what
[1:31:39] happened to forget what went wrong to
[1:31:41] forget what hurt you to forget what
[1:31:44] bothered you to forget why you were not
[1:31:46] in service to forget why you backslid to
[1:31:49] forget why you argued and put it all
[1:31:51] behind and press towards something
[1:31:54] greater something more important not
[1:31:57] your ambition not what you want but a
[1:32:00] prize of the high calling because it's a
[1:32:03] high calling that we are responding to
[1:32:06] tonight to be in the house of God can
[1:32:08] the church say Amen oh I believe it's
[1:32:12] almost midnight so I could already begin
[1:32:14] to tell you Happy New Year happy new
[1:32:16] season welcome to
[1:32:20] 2017 this is time this is our time this
[1:32:24] is revival time this is restoration time
[1:32:28] this is Deliverance time it's Holy Ghost
[1:32:30] time it's outpouring time and it's time
[1:32:33] to come back home it's time to return
[1:32:36] not to church but to return unto God to
[1:32:39] return to the Lord uh not return to man
[1:32:42] not return to the pastor but return unto
[1:32:45] the Lord can the church say
[1:32:47] Amen oh you may be seated I'm not going
[1:32:51] to be along with you tonight but you
[1:32:53] know what I'm convinced of there are
[1:32:55] some parties that haven't started
[1:32:58] yet there's the midnight party there's
[1:33:01] the 1:00 a.m. party there's the 2: a.m.
[1:33:04] party somebody to me there a concert
[1:33:06] starting at 3:00 a.m. and I got tired
[1:33:08] thinking about it and I tell myself if
[1:33:11] we are breaking into a new season that
[1:33:13] Moses knew about and Abraham taught
[1:33:16] about and brother Brandon wish he was
[1:33:18] here and we are here breaking into a new
[1:33:20] season new dimension all these years we
[1:33:24] are in the message listen you may be
[1:33:27] seated I said to them in South Africa
[1:33:30] and for you visitors who are here
[1:33:31] tonight I am tired of church I've said
[1:33:34] it for years I'm one of the few
[1:33:36] preachers who says they are tired of
[1:33:38] church because I'm looking for a reality
[1:33:41] I'm not looking for church I'm looking
[1:33:43] to see that same Jesus I'm looking to
[1:33:45] see the pillar of fire I'm looking to
[1:33:48] see silver and gold I don't have I'm I'm
[1:33:51] looking to see you may be seated people
[1:33:54] restored and
[1:33:56] stay let me say that again people get
[1:33:59] delivered and stay not delivered this
[1:34:02] week and next week I can't find you it
[1:34:04] means you will not really delivered
[1:34:06] because God does a total Deliverance I
[1:34:09] don't want a 80% Deliverance I don't
[1:34:12] want a 95% Deliverance I want
[1:34:16] all 16 elements to be transformed by
[1:34:20] fire to be transformed by the Holy Ghost
[1:34:24] I'm looking for that same power that
[1:34:26] Peter felt that the prophet felt can the
[1:34:29] church say
[1:34:30] [Music]
[1:34:32] Amen you may be seated you have to
[1:34:36] forgive me but with every breath that I
[1:34:39] take and for as long as God has me on
[1:34:42] this Earth whether he says Isaac your
[1:34:44] time is to be finished here or go to the
[1:34:46] Rapture I'm going to give God all that I
[1:34:48] have I might make mistakes I might fall
[1:34:51] but the devil knows who s I'm on he
[1:34:54] ain't make no mistake about that because
[1:34:57] it doesn't it's not how much time you
[1:34:58] fall is if you can get back up so 2016
[1:35:02] is over you have a blank slate today
[1:35:05] today is a new day it's a new year it's
[1:35:08] a new month it's a new declaration and
[1:35:11] the devil is mad because he has no idea
[1:35:14] what's about to happen because he
[1:35:16] doesn't hold a future but God he holds a
[1:35:20] future he is Alpha and Omega he knows
[1:35:23] the beginning from the end he saw you
[1:35:26] here tonight and her word went out
[1:35:29] return unto the
[1:35:32] Lord can the church say Amen so just for
[1:35:36] a few minutes can I get a few minutes
[1:35:38] tonight is there anybody ready for
[1:35:41] another round you ready to go another
[1:35:44] level higher you ready to give the devil
[1:35:46] a knockout punch is there anybody tired
[1:35:48] of being tired tired of being sick sick
[1:35:51] tired of being up and down is there
[1:35:54] anybody in the
[1:35:55] house can I get a shout in the
[1:35:59] house Hallelujah we came to serve the
[1:36:01] Lord Jesus that's what we came to do not
[1:36:04] to have church but we came to Lift Jesus
[1:36:07] Higher somebody say Jesus Jesus I can't
[1:36:10] hear you somebody say Jesus Jesus that's
[1:36:13] only 80% somebody say
[1:36:15] Jesus he's a center of my joy he's a
[1:36:19] center of my being he woke me up this
[1:36:21] morning and he has kept you all these
[1:36:24] years and he will keep you in this year
[1:36:26] let the redeem say
[1:36:28] [Applause]
[1:36:29] so
[1:36:31] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:36:34] Lord you may be
[1:36:35] [Applause]
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:39] seated just a few minutes I'm going to
[1:36:42] go as long as you could
[1:36:44] go so what time you finish is entirely
[1:36:47] up to you because it takes the people to
[1:36:50] pull the gift
[1:36:54] the preacher can never bring the Revival
[1:36:56] but it takes the prayer and the worship
[1:36:58] and the hunger and The Thirst to operate
[1:37:01] a gift so you have the remote control
[1:37:03] this evening you could operate a gift
[1:37:06] you could turn up the volume you could
[1:37:08] change the channel you could do whatever
[1:37:10] you want to tonight because God is a god
[1:37:13] of the audience he's a god of the people
[1:37:16] that's why it's bride time it's seed
[1:37:18] time it's family time it's Dynamics time
[1:37:22] can the church say
[1:37:25] amen
[1:37:27] hallelujah you may be seated just let me
[1:37:30] drop off this thought we'll have to
[1:37:32] continue this in regular service I got
[1:37:34] to take care of the calebs I told them
[1:37:36] in South Africa is a young people
[1:37:38] service because on the other side there
[1:37:40] are no calebs by age everybody is Young
[1:37:43] so brother George that gray here has a
[1:37:46] destination to be black again and I'm
[1:37:48] not talking about using Dy or using any
[1:37:50] other Tech technology it's just the
[1:37:52] genetic coding that's inside of you
[1:37:55] comes from God and once you come from
[1:37:57] God it could only respond a certain way
[1:38:00] the bald has got to go back the gray
[1:38:03] hair got to go back the back that's out
[1:38:05] of place got to get back everything you
[1:38:08] lost has to come back we read the
[1:38:09] scripture return unto the Lord because
[1:38:12] God said I will restore I'm not leaving
[1:38:15] it up to you the devil can't get
[1:38:17] involved because if God said he's going
[1:38:19] to restore what devil what demon What
[1:38:23] Spirit no weapon formed against you
[1:38:26] could
[1:38:28] Prosper
[1:38:30] Hallelujah a few
[1:38:32] minutes so my subject
[1:38:35] recognizing your day and your message
[1:38:39] because ignorance of this is what causes
[1:38:42] the problem in the church amen if you
[1:38:45] have Clarity of what you are born to do
[1:38:48] and what your purpose is it's very
[1:38:50] difficult to backslide am brother the
[1:38:53] brandham taught us that sin is unbelief
[1:38:57] and unbelief is sin he said smoking
[1:39:00] drinking fornication lust stepping
[1:39:03] outside of your marriage those are the
[1:39:06] attributes or the outward expressions of
[1:39:08] sin but at the very core it is unbelief
[1:39:13] because if you believe and you fear God
[1:39:15] you would not do anything wrong that's
[1:39:18] why David and Solomon exalted us that
[1:39:20] the fear of God is the beginning of
[1:39:24] wisdom but we live in a time where
[1:39:26] people don't even fear
[1:39:29] God so because they don't fear God they
[1:39:32] walk around as if there are no
[1:39:34] consequences to
[1:39:36] actions and when the consequences come
[1:39:39] they are quick to say oh God help me and
[1:39:41] God said you broke by very basic of
[1:39:44] covenants basic of words that you should
[1:39:47] fear me I am a jealous God I don't want
[1:39:51] to be shared with your job I don't want
[1:39:54] to be shared in your marriage what is
[1:39:56] due to me is due to me I should be first
[1:40:00] place all the time he is a jealous God
[1:40:03] can the church say
[1:40:05] Amen so two things we have to recognize
[1:40:09] our day yes and we have to recognize our
[1:40:13] message amen so when we talk about
[1:40:16] recognizing your day we talk about
[1:40:18] recognizing the signs and the conditions
[1:40:22] and the challenges you don't need to be
[1:40:24] in the message to understand the signs
[1:40:27] and the challenges and the situations
[1:40:28] the Pentecostal tell you the hour is
[1:40:32] late the Baptist and the Methodist tell
[1:40:35] you time is
[1:40:38] short so the day is not the
[1:40:40] issue because the Bible for years spoke
[1:40:43] of wars and rumors of wars and we are
[1:40:45] living in that time we are living in
[1:40:47] that day we recognize the day we live in
[1:40:51] a day where there's sin not just in the
[1:40:54] world but sin in the church that's why I
[1:40:56] read that scripture that's the very
[1:40:57] scripture God's Prophet read when he
[1:41:00] preached a message recognizing your day
[1:41:02] and its message about the sin in the
[1:41:05] church and about the priest and what
[1:41:07] they're doing and what is going on but
[1:41:09] yet still we must recognize our day and
[1:41:12] our message the hour is late the lid of
[1:41:16] hell is open and it would seem as if God
[1:41:20] has reled the
[1:41:22] rules it would seem as if God has
[1:41:25] relaxed the rules because for years
[1:41:27] people have gotten away with
[1:41:30] stuff gotten away with doing God on your
[1:41:34] terms when God is the one who set the
[1:41:37] terms worship is not optional it's
[1:41:41] mandatory prayer is not optional it's
[1:41:45] mandatory being in church is not
[1:41:47] optional it's mandatory singing is not
[1:41:51] optional it's mandatory having a Revival
[1:41:55] is not optional it's mandatory it's what
[1:41:59] we do it's who we are it's what makes us
[1:42:04] different it's not good enough to
[1:42:07] recognize your day you must recognize
[1:42:09] your message because your message you
[1:42:12] know what a message is a message has a
[1:42:14] to and it has a from and it has a
[1:42:18] subject amen that's go amen whether it's
[1:42:21] a email whether it's WhatsApp it's on
[1:42:23] the phone when you call somebody you are
[1:42:25] the from and you're speaking to the two
[1:42:28] and hopefully there's some content in
[1:42:30] there even if you say the word hi it
[1:42:32] still means something of value
[1:42:35] hi and you have a choice and how to
[1:42:38] respond but this message that we're
[1:42:40] talking about is God's own words so he
[1:42:43] is the from and he had a two so there's
[1:42:46] a message from God to an elect lady and
[1:42:50] in that message contain certain things
[1:42:54] there's a subject in there in that
[1:42:56] message has Rapture and Fai in that
[1:43:00] message has healing so when God said
[1:43:03] hello locked up in every word is
[1:43:06] power locked up in every word is Grace
[1:43:10] locked up in every word is the
[1:43:16] anointing let me give you an example
[1:43:19] there's a centurion he com to Jesus he
[1:43:21] said
[1:43:22] master I recognize that you are a man
[1:43:24] under Authority because if I say to one
[1:43:27] go he goeth just speak the word my
[1:43:30] servant is in trouble notice Jesus
[1:43:33] didn't even ask for a
[1:43:36] diagnosis he didn't ask is it cancer is
[1:43:38] it diabetes is it tumor he said go thy
[1:43:42] way he is
[1:43:44] well that was a from to the servant and
[1:43:49] those words had power
[1:43:51] those words had the solution to whatever
[1:43:54] that man's condition was so when we come
[1:43:57] to the house of God and we speak from
[1:43:59] the prophet's
[1:44:01] message it's a message of power that
[1:44:04] goes to the believer it goes to your
[1:44:07] family and there's no distance there's
[1:44:09] no time there's no obstacle there's no
[1:44:12] hindrance nothing could stop it can the
[1:44:15] Church Say
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:18] [Applause]
[1:44:19] Amen
[1:44:21] [Music]
[1:44:25] a few more minutes somebody just put the
[1:44:28] volume
[1:44:30] up somebody wants to get going somewhere
[1:44:33] they want to they want to see their
[1:44:35] inheritance they want to see their
[1:44:36] family delivered from their conditions
[1:44:39] is there anybody you want to see a
[1:44:40] family delivered is there anybody you've
[1:44:43] been struggling with sickness and you
[1:44:45] want to tell the devil enough is enough
[1:44:47] enough taking medication my promise is
[1:44:51] that
[1:44:53] medication my promise is not doctor's
[1:44:55] visit you have to come back every two
[1:44:57] weeks for a checkup no I need to come to
[1:44:59] the
[1:45:00] Rapture I need to be the house of the
[1:45:02] Lord every week that's my checkup not
[1:45:04] the doctor checkup I love over said we
[1:45:07] are in authority to cancel every
[1:45:10] assignment of the enemy whatever it is
[1:45:12] cancel the doctor's report tell the
[1:45:14] doctor go back to school because our
[1:45:17] school is different it's not the School
[1:45:19] of Theology it's the scho School of the
[1:45:21] Holy Ghost and Fire and when you
[1:45:23] graduate from that school your
[1:45:25] certificate allows you to speak against
[1:45:27] sickness speak against cancer speak
[1:45:30] against sin speak against lust and
[1:45:35] [Applause]
[1:45:37] fornication you may be
[1:45:40] seated so you could know everything
[1:45:43] about the day about the season about the
[1:45:45] time but we have a message in Noah's day
[1:45:48] there was a message in Moses day there
[1:45:51] was a message in Daniel's day there was
[1:45:54] a message what about our
[1:45:58] day our message is not just to come to
[1:46:00] church you could do that in any place
[1:46:03] it's a higher
[1:46:05] calling our message is not to be in the
[1:46:10] message that's like you saying I have a
[1:46:12] message I have a message I have a
[1:46:13] message what's what is the
[1:46:16] message the message that God sent a
[1:46:19] prophet that's the
[1:46:23] messenger what is the
[1:46:25] message the message is not to Brak
[1:46:28] confusion the message not to bring
[1:46:30] argument the message is not to have
[1:46:32] theological
[1:46:35] debates the message not to be
[1:46:37] interpreted or misinterpreted because we
[1:46:39] were taught in the message God is his
[1:46:41] own interpreter he doesn't need help to
[1:46:43] interpret in the time and season that
[1:46:45] the word supposed to be made manifest he
[1:46:48] doesn't need the preachers to make sense
[1:46:49] to it because he is the author and the
[1:46:52] finisher he uses the speech us as
[1:46:55] microphones and he speaks to his elect
[1:46:57] lady because you don't belong to man or
[1:47:00] to the church you belong to God and if
[1:47:03] God call you he's more than able to keep
[1:47:06] you he's more than able to save you he's
[1:47:08] more than able to fill you with the
[1:47:10] baptism of the Holy
[1:47:14] Ghost just a few more
[1:47:18] minutes listen to the prophet reason
[1:47:21] that people in Noah's day listen
[1:47:23] carefully is there anybody sleeping show
[1:47:25] I raise up
[1:47:27] hands the reason people in Noah's day
[1:47:31] did not go into the ark and I don't care
[1:47:34] if this is the first time you in church
[1:47:35] I know you know about the
[1:47:38] ark but the B said the reason that
[1:47:41] people in Noah they did not go into the
[1:47:43] ark is because they never recognize the
[1:47:47] message nor the messenger that's the
[1:47:51] only reason they perish is because they
[1:47:54] didn't recognize the hour that they were
[1:47:56] living
[1:47:57] in Hallelujah so I want to encourage you
[1:48:00] tonight I want to challenge you tonight
[1:48:03] I want to push you tonight some people
[1:48:05] have been on a journey for a long time
[1:48:08] and it might be feeling weary you might
[1:48:10] be feeling tired you might say Lord I've
[1:48:12] been holding on for a long time you have
[1:48:15] had the message but the day wasn't
[1:48:18] yet and there are those who just came in
[1:48:21] at the right time but you need the
[1:48:22] message because you have to recognize
[1:48:24] your day and your message and when the
[1:48:27] two come together when the word meets
[1:48:29] your time like Mary Mary knew the word a
[1:48:32] virgin would conceive that was the
[1:48:34] message but then they came a day when
[1:48:36] the angel Gabriel came and say hail Mary
[1:48:40] thou are highly
[1:48:42] favored let me drop this off friends
[1:48:44] it's not going to be your preacher it's
[1:48:46] going to speak to you when God is ready
[1:48:48] and we said it in South Africa when
[1:48:50] God's ready to activate you he's going
[1:48:51] to send an
[1:48:54] angel it's not going to be man it's
[1:48:56] going to be the angel of the Lord going
[1:48:58] to come visit you on your job in your
[1:49:01] home you're going to be washing the wees
[1:49:03] you're going to be driving you're going
[1:49:05] to be on the phone but an angel is going
[1:49:08] to interrupt your life and say your time
[1:49:11] is now you've been sitting for a long
[1:49:13] time but the hour has come for you to
[1:49:15] get into action to make a church to make
[1:49:18] a Revival to praise some more to worship
[1:49:22] some more to sing some more can the
[1:49:25] church say
[1:49:27] Amen you may be seated brother Stefan
[1:49:30] I'm going to have to finish this message
[1:49:32] some other time I'm on page seven of
[1:49:36] [Applause]
[1:49:42] 89 but I feel good because this is our
[1:49:46] time this is our season the devil is in
[1:49:49] trouble our commission is to return unto
[1:49:52] the Lord I'm going to skip through where
[1:49:54] the B said if the churches today would
[1:49:55] only recognize the word of God that's
[1:49:58] made promised for this hour people spend
[1:50:00] so many time on the mechanics and the
[1:50:03] details and the technicalities but God
[1:50:05] is a god of power he's a god of
[1:50:07] demonstration he said his gospel is not
[1:50:09] in word only but it is in power and
[1:50:11] demonstration so we are here to prophesy
[1:50:14] because the testimony of Jesus is a
[1:50:17] spirit of Prophecy and I want to walk
[1:50:19] into prophecy and the prophet the bride
[1:50:22] and the Holy Ghost has to say the same
[1:50:24] thing so we got to speak for our young
[1:50:26] people we got to speak for those that
[1:50:27] are sick speak for those who are not
[1:50:29] here right now and say this year is our
[1:50:32] year this year is our time this year is
[1:50:35] our
[1:50:37] season but brother Isaac you said that
[1:50:39] last year you said that a year before
[1:50:41] you said that a year before that every
[1:50:44] year Noah saying it's going to rain it's
[1:50:46] going to rain it's going to rain but
[1:50:48] they say but last year you said said
[1:50:50] 2016 is going to be my year he say it's
[1:50:53] still going to rain it's still but one
[1:50:55] day the Rain Begin to Fall the lightning
[1:50:58] began to flash and there was a
[1:51:00] manifestation of that word can the
[1:51:03] church say
[1:51:07] [Applause]
[1:51:10] amen
[1:51:12] hallelujah
[1:51:14] hallelujah I have a lot of stuff here
[1:51:16] but I'm going to skip through this we're
[1:51:17] going to take this up another season
[1:51:19] another time time so our message
[1:51:22] recognizing our day is it everybody know
[1:51:25] that this is the last day is there
[1:51:26] anybody not sure about
[1:51:28] [Music]
[1:51:30] that you think they got like centuries
[1:51:32] to come
[1:51:35] and the US just give sanctions against
[1:51:38] Russia and the prophet spoke about a
[1:51:40] time of tension and a and a bomb that's
[1:51:42] going to come to America all these
[1:51:44] pieces are being lined up in order but
[1:51:47] you know what's amazing that scripture
[1:51:48] we read with the brandom typed it he
[1:51:50] said it speaks to the Jews returning to
[1:51:52] God but before the Jews can return to
[1:51:55] God the Gentiles have to come back to
[1:51:58] God so you can't talk about the Jews
[1:52:01] because they are God's time piece but
[1:52:03] God has them on
[1:52:06] pause because the Bible said he had
[1:52:08] scattered but he going to bring back he
[1:52:11] said that scattering he said God blinded
[1:52:14] the Jews if God didn't blind the Jews
[1:52:16] they would have seen Messiah because
[1:52:18] they knew that the day they kn knew what
[1:52:20] day it was they knew what the message
[1:52:22] was supposed to be because when the wise
[1:52:24] men came and say where is he them
[1:52:26] brothers pulled the quotes
[1:52:29] well the prophet said there's one to
[1:52:31] come and if you find him bring back word
[1:52:33] so they knew the word they knew the day
[1:52:36] but they failed to
[1:52:38] recognize the message of the hour and
[1:52:41] when Messiah was walking the Earth the
[1:52:44] Pharisees didn't recognize him he looked
[1:52:47] like him he but it's like I don't know
[1:52:48] who that is they didn't recognize him
[1:52:51] but you a veiled message hidden for
[1:52:55] centuries Paul hinted towards it John
[1:52:58] was caught up he went higher and saw it
[1:53:01] but you you recognize
[1:53:03] it from the east from the west from the
[1:53:05] north from the south you never met the
[1:53:07] prophet but when you saw the word you
[1:53:09] saw your name you say I know who that is
[1:53:12] when they spoke when the word spoke of
[1:53:13] adoption and Perfection I'm not sure you
[1:53:16] spoke like Paul I do not claim to
[1:53:19] apprehend or comprehend but this one
[1:53:21] thing I know forgetting the thing that
[1:53:24] have passed I was born in sin shaped in
[1:53:27] iniquity I made all kinds of mistakes
[1:53:30] but there's one thing I do know
[1:53:32] forgetting the things that the pass I'm
[1:53:34] reaching the something that's beyond
[1:53:37] something that is Supernatural something
[1:53:40] from eternity something from God because
[1:53:44] I come from God and I'm going back to
[1:53:46] God somebody say
[1:53:48] Amen
[1:53:51] oh my my my my my 2017 is demon chasing
[1:53:57] time we are serving notice you may have
[1:54:00] had havoc in 2000 and 2010 and 11 and 12
[1:54:04] but 17 we are taking back what the devil
[1:54:07] took from us all the young people
[1:54:10] they're coming back the sick has got to
[1:54:12] be healed those that are dead they're
[1:54:14] going to be raised up because we have a
[1:54:17] Ministry of Resurrection so I don't care
[1:54:19] how bad it is what happened is
[1:54:21] irrelevant we know who we
[1:54:26] are I'm getting ready to why now now a
[1:54:29] few more minutes recognizing our Dano
[1:54:32] message it's a message of truth that's
[1:54:35] the message we are speaking about
[1:54:36] tonight it's a message of life it's a
[1:54:39] message of power it's a message of
[1:54:41] adoption it's a message of perfection
[1:54:44] it's a message of Revival it's a message
[1:54:46] of Victory it's a message that show us
[1:54:48] how to go amen there's no other way to

[1:54:54] us how to get up it's a message for our
[1:54:56] families it's a message for our children
[1:54:59] it's a message of healing it's a message
[1:55:01] that's Vindicated it's a message that's
[1:55:03] already overcome it overcame in Paul's
[1:55:06] day in irenia day Martin Luther it
[1:55:10] overcoming every day and in our day
[1:55:13] God in his wisdom took all the word and
[1:55:17] tied it up in this day and give you the
[1:55:20] whole Atomic
[1:55:23] weapon he put the whole payload in this
[1:55:26] Rapture Express so that when we leave we
[1:55:29] drop the atomic
[1:55:31] [Applause]
[1:55:33] bomb and finish the
[1:55:36] enemy am hasn't he had his run for a
[1:55:39] long time well we are serving noce Satan

[1:55:45] bride is going to overcome because she
[1:55:47] has a message that can never fail
[1:55:50] Rapture in faith is laying in that
[1:55:51] message Redemption is laying in the
[1:55:54] message can the church say

[1:56:35] new year as well and brother Brandon was
[1:56:38] preaching for a while but he came to a
[1:56:39] crossroad in that message and he say Oh
[1:56:42] Come stand with me by my side and he
[1:56:46] speaking to the church in Phoenix

[1:59:46] real a call is going out this morning
[1:59:50] return to
[1:59:51] God come come come return unto God
[1:59:56] brother Bram ghost and I'm calling for
[1:59:57] men to Stand By Me stand with the word
[2:00:00] what the word says do do it just the way
[2:00:03] the word said I don't care what anything
[2:00:05] else said stay it that way it's the only
[2:00:09] thing that will cut amen
[2:00:12] amen so when this message that we have
[2:00:16] recognized to be the truth is applied in
[2:00:18] its power
[2:00:20] and with Simplicity and the same way the
[2:00:23] prophet said he said it will cut every
[2:00:25] time no interpretation no feeling no
[2:00:28] emotion but you take the word of God and
[2:00:31] lay it to your situation lay it in your
[2:00:34] marriage lay it in your finances lay it
[2:00:37] to your children lay it in your house
[2:00:39] and watch the demons go to running
[2:00:42] because you are sons of God you are
[2:00:44] Daughters of God born for such a time as
[2:00:47] this can the church say amen amen is
[2:00:51] there anybody wants to return unto the
[2:00:53] [Music]
[2:00:54] Lord friends you may be seated hall
[2:00:58] hallelujah the season is
[2:01:01] changing and when the season
[2:01:04] changes you cannot do anything about it
[2:01:07] you just have to respond amen and with
[2:01:10] the season of blessing and restoration
[2:01:14] it comes with
[2:01:15] judgment because brother the random said
[2:01:17] many times the people did not realize
[2:01:19] that God keeps his word not just His
[2:01:23] blessings and promises but he keeps his
[2:01:25] curses he keeps his judgment I'm going
[2:01:28] to share a story with you have we all
[2:01:30] may know it or some may know it but
[2:01:33] brother Brandon was standing one time
[2:01:34] and his son Billy
[2:01:36] Paul messed with the tupe on his
[2:01:40] head and brother Bram went and pray and
[2:01:44] he stood and interceded for his son and
[2:01:46] Billy Paul didn't understand what was
[2:01:48] going on
[2:01:49] because he couldn't understand the
[2:01:51] spirit realm and what was taking place
[2:01:53] and you know what brother real said to
[2:01:55] him he said I forgive you he said you're
[2:01:57] my son he said but I have no power I
[2:02:01] have no control over the angel who works
[2:02:04] with me and that angel wanted to kill
[2:02:07] Billy Paul for messing with his father's
[2:02:10] head that's the kind of season we are
[2:02:13] living in it's the reality of another
[2:02:16] Ephesians we are back to the time of
[2:02:18] Anan and Safar we are back to the time
[2:02:21] of judgment but also Deliverance amen so
[2:02:24] I want to challenge you Church of the
[2:02:26] Living God don't take this for granted
[2:02:30] don't take prayer meetings for granted
[2:02:33] amen recognize your day recognize your
[2:02:37] message that was brought dripping with
[2:02:41] blood recognize that it's the grace of
[2:02:44] God to us to understand these things to
[2:02:47] be here tonight to hear the these things
[2:02:50] not just to be in the message but the
[2:02:52] brand in the token said don't just say
[2:02:55] you want to hear the messenger he said
[2:02:58] obey the message
[2:03:00] am don't just say we know God sent the
[2:03:03] prophet that's not good enough what are
[2:03:05] you doing with the prophet's
[2:03:08] message recognize young people your day
[2:03:12] recognize your message in this message
[2:03:15] where the Brandon went into it he spoke
[2:03:16] about the woman and the way they dressed
[2:03:19] and the way they act and the men in the
[2:03:21] church and the way they dress and the
[2:03:24] way they act and as I challenge the
[2:03:26] Church of the Living God this morning
[2:03:28] whether it's Minister Elder Deacon
[2:03:30] trustee Usher it does not matter we have
[2:03:33] to recognize our day and our message we
[2:03:35] have become
[2:03:37] lazy we have become full we have
[2:03:40] taken things for granted we come to
[2:03:43] church when we want we come to church
[2:03:45] whatever time we want we dress any way
[2:03:48] we want and and judgment will begin in
[2:03:50] the house of God Amen and because we
[2:03:53] have been given the word We Know
[2:03:57] Better what is our excuse
[2:04:00] Hallelujah recognize your difference
[2:04:04] recognize your message it's easy to
[2:04:07] shout and jump into 2017 but if you walk
[2:04:10] into this new season without
[2:04:13] understanding how dangerous the ground
[2:04:15] is you will
[2:04:17] lose the Holy Ghost is moving around
[2:04:19] right now to put a mark upon those who
[2:04:22] sigh and cry for the abomination in the
[2:04:25] city not just in the city but in the
[2:04:28] Church of the Living God
[2:04:31] Amen fathers who have abandoned their
[2:04:34] positions mothers have abandoned their
[2:04:36] positions daughters have abandoned their
[2:04:39] positions because we all have a position
[2:04:42] amen amen we are striving to be
[2:04:44] positionally placed to live such a life
[2:04:48] that people will look at us and say yes
[2:04:50] I want to be like you that could only
[2:04:53] happen if you recognize your day and
[2:04:56] recognize your message
[2:04:58] Amen in that same message where the Bram
[2:05:01] said God will raise up
[2:05:03] prostitutes if he has to because his
[2:05:06] word will never fail and if you reject
[2:05:09] this message if you reject his truth if
[2:05:12] you reject his gospel God will raise up
[2:05:15] Stones if he has to but his word will
[2:05:18] come to pass
[2:05:19] but I believe in my heart tonight that
[2:05:21] you are here because there's a
[2:05:23] call that has arrested you a call that

[2:05:34] Heart by The Busy schedules by your
[2:05:38] Ambitions by your plans and your dreams
[2:05:41] and your aspirations Because unless God
[2:05:44] has signed off on it you are going
[2:05:46] against his will amen
