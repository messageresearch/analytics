you have to claim it for your own self you send your car claim it without it without doubts and unbelief you can't believe you have received and you have a doubt you have to have faith truly Faith to believe you have received and when you believe you have receive it you could praise God for it so you can't come here with a long face you're coming you're thinking and praising and blessing God because you believe you have received and you are grateful to God for the opportunity praise God faith is a revelation praise God you could be backed in 50 years and God drop Revelation inside your

you know Holy Ghost Bunch Give the Lord a shout there is going to be a holy ghost bunch okay let's outstand we want to go into the wood this morning [Music] and we have three portions of scripture we want to read Joel 2 reading from 21 to 29 Luke eat ing from 10 to 15 Hebrews 11 reading from 31 to 40. and the reason I reached scriptures this way and announce it and so on many times the convention and other services I want to preach upon the scripture and I can't write it down so I am doing what I want for myself I scored all your scriptures if you want to write it down you can write it down so I want to read from John chapter 2 uh reading from verse 29 21 rather fear not to land be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things that alone is a shout caught saying I'll do greetings Be not Afraid beast of the field or the passage of the Wilderness do spring for the tree beard of fruit and the Fig Tree and the vine do yield their strength be glad then each one of Zan and rejoice in the Lord your God for he had given to you the former Reign moderately but he will cause to come down for you the rain the former and the lottery in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat no no barrenness no emptiness and the factual overflow with wine and oil and I push not prolonged will restore to you the years that the Lucas had eaten the conquer woman the caterpillar and the Palmer one migrate Army which I sent among you and they shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that I don't want to see with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and they shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit and from Luke chapter 8 reading verse 10 this is Jesus after the parable of the seed and the disciples and he acts they asked him what is this about and he said we'll stand unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but the others in Parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of God those by the wayside are they that hear then commit the devil and take it away the word out of the hearts at least they should believe and be saved they on the Rock a day which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believes and in time of Temptation Fall Away that fell among Thorns that day when they have heard go for it and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection what's that lying there no fruit to Perfection but 15 says and they but that on good ground a day which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruitful patience so what that tells you food with patience is food of perfection all right let's last for scripture last scripture from Hebrews chapter 11 verse 31. praise God by faith the Harlot rehab perished not with them that believe not when she had received the spies with peace what shall I say Mercy for time would fail to tell me of Gideon or bark of Samson of jephthah of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who threw fate subdued kingdoms throughout righteousness obtained promises stop them out of lions according to farmers are far escape the age of the sword out of weakness were made strong rocks villains and fight turned and flight the armies of the aliens one received their dead raises to life again others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection others are Trials of cruel mockings and squadrons Yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned there was sauna Sunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wanted about in sheepskin and goat skin being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better things for us that day without us should not be made perfect let us pray father we thank you for your word I've read it Lord and you know all what is here father Lord may you speak what need to be spoken and what you don't want me to speak just close my mouth and Jesus name I ask that amen you may be seated oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise God it is wonderful to be here this morning praise God in the presence of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah praise God we want the world to be turned on praise God in your heart in your light the word turned on Amen all right so brother was praying in the six seal on your spring this prayer you say Lord I pray that you'll honor these people for their respects of the word and heal them for Jesus sake out here in the audience Lord there are certain people just like who listening to the the Apostle Peter Pentecost how he went back in the word and got the word he said Joel said and the last these these things will take place and three thousand Believers are baptized and father today We Stand by Your Grace it's not because it's a special people just like the day of the land oxman is Eagle time it's the anointing of the r it's a time you're living in it's the working of the holy spirit for this particular time to prove that Jesus is not dead and the things he said he would do just before the even lights went out and here we are seeing him do right down along the road we see it come down and scientific it's picture taken the great Pillar of Fire who led the children of Israel who met Paul on the road we know this same pillar of heart let Moses down in the wilderness by that same pillar fire he wrote several books of the Bible he was anointed but the word this same pillar Fire coming upon Paul on the root of Damascus he wrote many books of the Bible and the Lord that same Pillar of Fire by evidence of the proof of the word and by scientific research it is here revealing the word of God he said God let the people be awakened quickly Lord quickly those who have their names put on The Book of Life and when this flashes across their path may they see like the little ill-filled woman of the well that day she recognized quickly and she knew it was scripture and father I pray that all that would receive you at this time in their hearts will set it forever that in at this hour that they are finished with sin original finish with sin and will arise and make preparations now for public confession of baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins the show that believe that God has forgiven them and they take on the name of Jesus Christ yeah when I get to know then father then father pour out down the Holy Spirit of oil upon them what is he talking about Mysteries Revelations teachings he said pour out the Holy Spirit of oil upon them that they might be placed into the service of the Lord God that they might be workers in this last evil day for we realize we have just a short time and the church might have to go at any time the line the lamb might at any time leave the sanctuary or the Throne of sacrifice and comfort from the Throne of God where the sacrifice is lead there's no more hopes for the world she is finished then she goes into frustration of great spasms and of earthquakes and great shakings like it was at the resurrection and Christ arose from the grave when the saints rise the same thing will take place Lord it could be at any minute we are watching for that glad day to arrive take your children under your arm father draw your little lambs to your bosom Grant it and feed them on the word till they are in strength for service see them on the word till they are in strength for service God promised virtue power for service who as many as received him to them give him power to become the sons of God God said feed on the word until you get strength for service because this bride have to be put into service this bride are going no benchwarming Churchill come and going home and coming back to church that is not the pride of Jesus Christ this brother to be put in service these things Jesus began to do and continue to do oh glory to God Jesus didn't finish his ministry but he continuous Ministry by and through this bright lady this elect lady God called you by which he could work that Ministry or give the Lord some Praises see them on the word till they have strength for service Oh Glory to God we are feeling on the word tonight hallelujah praise God we commit them to you now answer this prayer you said father over in Mark 11 chapter When you pray believe you receive what you ask for and you shall have it I'm with all my heart to him that's been revealing these things done through the years and these seals here this week I believe you Lord God that this is the hour oh closer than we have ever think please let my prayer be answered and may every called child of God that's inherent distance of here or either the test will strike May at that time I claim them for the kingdom of God oh glory to God he claiming them that prophet and Faith hit in Mark 11 so I claim them for the kingdom of God upon the basis of knowing this is the word that's been revealed let the evening light shine father I commit them to you in Jesus name Give the Lord some praises or give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah praise God he was praying that you comfort he was praying that you come true he was praying the table strike you and it has shocked you that's why you are here oh glory to God Amen Hallelujah we'll have a title this morning the title is looter Wesley Pentecostals I know the word

better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father that I declared to do undetermined to do I wasn't the one that appeared on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performed all these things and foretell these things that happen as perfect as they are I'm only one that knee when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it is what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seven Angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was

[Applause] I feel converted straight in the bedroom oh Hallelujah let's go about this over this by Clarence he said you see why I have been so zealous of the kind of a seed I planted for the body so we have to find those seeds that brother Branham planted he actually put it on books and tapes he go tell them to say things a certain way to throw awesome and all but there are seeds for the body and our duty is to find those seeds that he planted for the body now watch the rain is going to fall pretty soon I mean the real rain and it's got to have sea to fall on I hope I live to see it God didn't

and live in virtue and live in knowledge because the seed have the potential oh give the Lord a shout the seed of the potential to be transformed into whatever God said the seed is and we put the Sea of the stature of a perfect man Not A Primitive side of you Oh Glory to God Glory my watch so you know Solomon Temple the past were caught in different places right and they came to assembly to say another Soul was healed and so on he said no watch it didn't even need a honing it was already honed God made it so perfect to fit in this place what a type here we find that spiritual how every gift of God every odd Act of born-again Christian in their peculiarity yes it's got a place it fits in the body it goes in the right place many of us would say that that's not God a good holy consecrated soul of the Cross and we say no we stood in the church all the other night we heard such a thing that can't be God but if it is in line with the pattern if it's in line with the Scripture it may be odd but it's going to have its place it will fit right in and it won't even need horny or polishing it's go to its place for the great architect Christ is dependent now now we notice in the building down here the next chapter in the building there was one stone there was actually too odd to fool with so the builders rejected it and they pitch it over in the corner that stone is too hard to be used there's no such a place but remember they had built the building so high till they missed the stone and they didn't know where that stone was they searched on the ships they went through every Ox cart they said did you lose your stone on the road something is wrong and they could not find it nowhere else come to find out it was right on the ground it was the Chief Cornerstone that the bill has rejected and Jesus spoke of it he said have you not read that the stone the bill is rejected was the Chief Cornerstone where the rest of the building rested on and in the building the day of the spiritual house that God worshiped I think it had been a great big failure today among the builders we have come with our denomination we have laid them in sincerity we sent our boys to school to educate them speak well before congregations learn them psychology Bible History we did everything built fine pews high tower Steeples beautiful music we find something is wrong we try to build it out of man-made material what education could produce what seminaries could bring out what scholarship which I'd ability upon education and all these things will not work as long as we have not accepted this Odd Stone this peculiar Stone and as the building begin to materialize they realized that the hole that was left the Odd Stone fitted to the dot that is where the spiritual Builders today that is why the bride building of Christ is not ready for the bridegroom listen to these words that is why the bride building of Christ is not ready for the bridegroom is because the builders has rejected the Chief Cornerstone that was laid on the Ping of Pentecost which is the baptism of the Holy Spirit it's been odd people act funny they don't want to come in order of psychology or Educational Learning they don't fit in there and they kick it out because it was too odd too peculiar no we find out but you have stones and Stones got 14 and we're only waiting for that headstone that the bill has rejected waiting for his coming the captain Stone that is the real church not mortar not brick and stone and so forth which is perishable but the real church is built upon the revelation of the word and the will of God and they have been placed in the body since Ephesians is all the way down to allow this year in the day of Solomon completed the temple he said no watch I say this with reverence with all respects to every man in every Church today accept the rejected instead of pushing them off and call them a bunch of Holy Rollers the odd ones they're making too much noise here's somebody calls exercise in church really stand up like maybe like we're doing aerobics church when you gain up and saying but they they probably stay tuned and they say no stone dead watch and watch but did you notice after the building was completed it was still empty it was nothing but furniture so Solomon had done all this he could do now the great dedication come and they were going to dedicate this building for worshipers to worship something now without Something There To Worship the building would have been in vain no the building was ready for dedication they started marching the trumpet song and they saw trees playing smoke going up from dead animals sacrificed before Jehovah down through the building of the dedication that came they brought it to his resting place and when it fit down into the sockets of the huge place when it fit down finally come to its resting place the Bible said that the Lord sended dong upon the place till he filled the entire Temple the pillar of fire came in dear with such a great glory of God till the minister could not Minister anymore because of the glory of God that building by Solomon was built according to specification it was built according to our vision according to our program and nothing happened you're not remind me of when Elijah was following Elijah Elisha was following Elijah and he crossed Jordan and he said if you see me go he said what you want me to do he's a double portion if you see me go and Elijah making sure no politics he was just focusing on Elijah and then he saw him go and he dropped the mantle upon him and when that man had hit him so he tried to only cheer up his own robe and nothing happened he's so good I topping upon that Michael nothing it was just a mantle and then he catch a revelation it's not in my bloody power he saw you like that strike the mantle and you throw it and open up it wasn't a mantle he took the mantle and he said where is the Lord God of Elijah and he recognizes more than just letter it's more than just word it's more than having a rule from the prophet I am the prophet's robe you could have whatever role you have you better have the god of Elijah okay the Lord some praise it Glory Hallelujah mine mine Glory then he said watch we find out Stephen said our fathers from favor before God and Solomon built another Temple how would be the most high dweled not of temples made with hands Heaven is my Throne it is my footstool what house will you build me but our body has no prepared me showing that God was going to dwell in the body watch and hear 120 temples that God created was ready for dedication they got all the unbelief Beatle to them and the garden of the upper room and waited for 10 days for dedicational service and then suddenly completely surrendered and God came down again in Shekinah Glory and fill all the house where they were sitting so he didn't hear Pentecost he filled them 120 temples that was up there with himself with the Holy Ghost then Shekinah Glory broke true upon them oh glory to God do you understand that this is not some mystery this is not trumpets and vials and wars and woman and his son and Russia and Ukraine this is not

unfolded when I put the first seal red horse and a white horse and then peel horse and then Black Horse and red horse and something like that all the horses going what the season show is the elected lady in every single age under the anointing of God hidden away from Satan they pay us Rider riding the White House Rider riding the red horse rider riding and so on and so on but the saints of God he let was being snatched out of every age Oh Glory to God and I became my devils in hell in this age there's a black lady that got put the face with anything Lucifer could deliver Oh Glory to God and this bride will defeat the Devil anywhere anytime any place under any condition his licks everywhere what a triumphant bride not even death will stop this Pride Oh Glory to God she wasn't born to die she was born to be translated she was born to be changed this Rapture will come inside out oh glory to God from the new blood inside you another being be informed inside of you Christ the world image and the Flesh on the outside changing in a moment in a thing of an eye there's mortar will put an immortality this corruption will put on in corruption we shall be changed all right let's go four messengers of debt that's what he read about tamawum Lucas Cancun caterpillar one talks is fruit one took the back one talks the leave and one took the life that was the dead angels that was the angels of death four you call them messengers of debt and then four messes of Life restores the tree four messages were sent to restoratory first as Martin Luther justification second was John Wesley sanification what was the third the Pentecost where the Russian of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptisms what was the thought the word that's why I titled the message luta Wesley Pentecostal and the word that is the fourth message one of them looter you begin the shine a light small strength of justification Along Came Mercy stronger sanification and then the last days Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with the very word the word of the Lord comes to the prophet to turn the hearts of return back to the faith of the fathers the Fort Light so Malachi 4 is the fourth light four Killers took it four messenger destroyed it four messengers of death took it away for mess of righteousness restore right back oh my Hallelujah I will restore saith the Lord justification brought back the pulp certification brought back the back touching of Holiness the Pentecostal brought back the leaves clap hands and fellowship and rejoicing what the thought was the word the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ here we go has finally after justification been planted that's the word planted standard vacation being planted the bathroom only goes organization died out and Christ has again centered himself like that cup of the pyramid first line justification sanification second Holy Ghost stood then the coming of the camp that's where we are at then he said what is it he's going on deeper that Holy Ghost bunch being honed out so that they could fit with the same kind of a Ministry I tell the ministers they do have that Ministry yet it's the same kind this is Jesus ministry we're talking about understand this the bride will preach to Eternal loss how could lost people preach a loss we born in sin shape iniquity how could sinner saved by grace preacher they lost is not our ministry that will be Christ Ministry you think Peter want to kill innocence of Ira it's Peter wasn't in charge of that you know he said enlighten me you lie to the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost took care of that so that wasn't Peter Ministry that was the Holy Ghost Ministry working to Peter you mean that coming back yes you mean that we're back in the church yes [Applause] here we go what is it what the Holy Ghost bunch being honed so that it can fit with the same kind of mystery had when he went away and when he comes back it will catch the whole thing in the Rapture where the Justified sanctified baptism only goes that pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again the tree of life is growing again so you cannot say you're Justified the message because he had the word no you need the whole package because all is God the spirit justifies you the spirit sanctifies you the spirit baptizes and the spirit bring the word to you to turn the word on the light Oh Glory to God so when you want to get closer to God you're only trying to grow in God so you get fit God to Draw Me Closer bring me closer he give you a virtue I want to be close God give you knowledge through some means Temperance and patience and godliness right up the pyramid seven steps to perfection write up the pyramid and then afterwards you become one with him when you see me you see the Father the father who lives in me and what the prophecy we have since John 14 20 at that day you shall know I am in the father he and me and I knew so God promised to be in you he was God above us in the pillar of fire he was God With Us in Jesus Christ but he really want to get in you God above god with and now God in that's why he told them I will not leave you comfort this I will come to you otherwise see me no more and but you're gonna see me Oh Glory to God how you dwell it with you but shall be in you I would not leave you comfortless I will come oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah praise God these people who died are depending and waiting on us that includes all the Brethren and sisters who died in this church all the prophets all who died the waiting on us watch what so this church prophecy has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection their souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to Perfection that is when Christ does come oh my Hallelujah okay the Lord some praises glory to God and when it comes this church has got to be honed between them so when the pyramid cap does come the body of Christ will have to be honed that is not America that's the entire body of Christ see you in Africa and YouTube you have it so no yeah if you're in China you have to be honed South America has to be home Canada America West Indies have to be honed that means God must raise them from Stone Mason to hone the Bride of Jesus Christ that's why there's a fight for Ministry for the Perfection of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the 85 of the Body for the honing of the body to do the final finishing touches the word cut you out but the finishing touches I said that is fine tuning now this [Music] [Applause] what what you not seeing God's seal that's why God tell the prophet be more sincere Oh Glory to God because God's seeing something man cannot see or give the Lord a shout so he had to be honed and cut and smooth out oh glory to God hallelujah Hallelujah sand people rubbing you down so it's not easy but look glory to God when God finished with you it fitting just right the Devil Himself can move between that hey torn upon Stone glory to God red blood into orange blend into yellow blood into thin and no leaks in the building and charity comes down the wonderful Fitness and seal the whole building and he said I use the pyramid living pyramid of the Living God oh Hallelujah glory to God all right let's hit the homelessness you know you're going good for marginal voice he says this God is ready if he isn't doing it now he is going to call a church the Perfection by his word Jesus Christ that's the call to this group because it is pastor this minute so this inspiration to connect to this one and what no no call the perfection by his word Jesus Christ all right so let me get to the inspiration now I was wondering how to title this was so tough I was thinking about this last Grace that must come to Perfection if I titled that you would know what I'm talking about Wesley Pentecostal and the word and this last great step must come into the Perfection which is the word let's step there right so now we understand where he comes from now from the sign of the time New York brother Brown we have left the Pentecostal age we are coming now to wear like in a pyramid not pyramid reduction now the headstone when it comes to fit it's got to be honed there's got to be a Ministry in the church he is not talking about brother to your ministry the ministry he's talking about here now is the ministry of Jesus Christ has to be in the church here there's got to be a Ministry in the Church the true children God to where when The Headstone come Christ or the ministry of Christ and Christ will fit right together so Christ is coming but the minutes of Christ is here to fit with Christ in other words he's come back for the Same Spirit you know but don't give a story about any in the early times when the Chinese came over and they had laundry and when they come and put your laundry closed he said take a ticket until and give your peace to keep and they will keep a Peace So when they come back for a laundry Cruise doesn't match it and then then match it then you could get your clothes and always the other half of the Chinese ticket so when God come back he has to have the same Spirit here on the earth when Christ come it must match it must blend in other words word of my word Spirit of my spirit it has to be here it has to have the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ not your birthday kindness not you loving your own and your family and whatnot that is you and your business that is not you and your natural business we're not talking about natural body kindness natural virtue natural Faith natural patience we talk about the patience of Jesus Christ the temperance of Jesus Christ the godliness of Jesus right not your own of Jesus Christ oh give the Lord some Praises that has to be emanating in you glory to God can be calling with your wife and when somebody knocking the door you say God praise the Lord when you're smiling so but you're just calling with your husband so you know any stranger come or some people come to get in my shoulder prison all is well but you're just a correct that yet you know see I'm talking about so when they begin to live in you it's automatic you act the right way to give a witness to Pentecostal to anybody haters and atheist Muslim Buddha Hindu it doesn't matter which is you act like Christ how christ-word you live the life of Christ you act the Life of Christ is the life behind the name they're going to make them Devils tremble are you with me now [Applause] all right there's got to be a Ministry in the church the True Church of the Living God to when when The Headstone come Christ or the ministry of Christ and Christ would fit right in together then that brings back the redeemed to take the whole house of God to Glory the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian true great proficient ages will come out and give their lives and persecution on things for the kingdom of God but that Stone is coming yes sir it says me will come God will send it it will fit all the building together upon it we see these signs and we see the ministry from Christ beginning to narrow up now to the complete Ministry of Christ in the fullness of the Holy Spirit under Luther it was the same holy spirit so don't say loser didn't have the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit was given to Luther in the form of justification so justification was his baptism are you with me sanification then sanitation on the Wesley the messages then the baptism of the Holy Spirit making a tree not three steps of Grace but three stations I might call it notice and this is where he switched over now when a baby is born these three things considers birth normal birth is water then blood then life the new birth is water blood and spirit that's the elements that come from his body to make up his bride Adam had his bride taken from his body crimes his brightening from the body and when Christ died there was three elements that came from his body water blood spirit justification true Believin water sanification to the blood the battle Holy Spirit and this is where I get it from so now this last great step must come into the perfection that the Holy Spirit has to live in that church so perfectly not he's not talking about messages he's not talking about sermons and foreign four hours three hours pumping the wood and Elena Foundation when you go when go finish because you see you have to get on the expectation for the cap you have to get an expectation for the lettering you have to get an expectation for the spirit you need a spirit to be with your children you need the spirit to live with your family you need the spirit to be the loved ones it's Devils on them you can go and beat them at a spoken book you can take the Bible and slam it on them and tell them in the Bible just laugh at it but when you see a move of the spirit by the time you hit that front door them Devils looking to go on the back door because they know what is coming they recognize the anointing upon your life say my sickness when that anointing upon you you say you're going to the hospital bed he said I'm devious no they have to give up cancer demon to my demon leukemia all them Devils at a tremble on your hospital bed here is it bad yeah can they act they want to go it's a spirit all them things and doctors and Things Are Spiritual God will give you your doctorate with signs on one of the Miracles Lord bypass all that degree Oh Glory to God lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover they give the Lord a praise Hallelujah glory to God you get in your doctorate man we're not going to the medical school your doctorate is to cast our Devils or no praise demons because every service you're trying to cast out no praise demons Satan sitting in the top lip and they can't say amen and praise God and before be say amen and the 24 Elders say Amen under ten ten thousand thousands glory glory and you set you like a lump and a log you have nothing to say praise God you better say Amen if you believe this word oh God want to hear you from your mouth when you take this man to be your wife Rebecca say I will go oh give the Lord I shout glory to God I want to hear from your mouth and we said Jesus you're blind man but he must a blind man say Lord and Jesus asked him what you want me to do for you be assumed you're supposed to only blind without thou shall see no you won't even know what you want me to do you know a man wonder when he luxury you know the man with the promotion you don't remember the feature another feature and you don't know what a man wants you want to hear from your mouth what do you want me to do for you if God come along this morning and ask you that question what will you answer him what do you want me to do for you today okay the Lord some praises what you want that's what you need they want God to give you power to live a holy life power to pray power to overcome well that's what you want oh give the Lord some praises [Applause] oh let's see if you can hit the womb this last great step must come into the perfection what is that the Holy Spirit has to live in that church so perfectly it will make the head and the body unite together that's the body he's the head of the Buddy notice this on Masterpiece the life that was in the husk in the stock in the tassel all God is up in the seed yeah the sea began to pull their life so the light God is in the seed hear what he said no the light of under the stock and that's it that is talk leaves but the stalker leaves is not deceived it's when it's reproduced in the original state it come back to the original so when the seed dies what happens they push up a stock and that's the ages there the unfolding of the life of the seed but when it comes to the last age spot itself which is the seed and around the seat of a husk or a shock that covers the seed because the seed is not ready for the Sun so you'll have a shock around it that come into church with the seed fellowship and break the seed acting like the seed but a shock and when the sunlight had to hit it so the shock dries up and the Sea becomes golden brown [Applause] do you get it now that's why when pressure comes the sea could handle it the secret take pressure the seed will leave church because pressure come I done whether it says I've done with this Christianity thing I finished no no no no no no the sea just stayed there and the pressure gets the sea to be cold and prone we'll give the Lord some Praises now Glory are you ready one went to meet the other justification middleware personification sanification made away for the back only goes here we go and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection and back to the word it's still not living the word so you can't talk about perfection and no word it has to be back to the word oh praise God praise God Hallelujah the church will come to justification to Luther true sanitation to Wesley to the back to the holy ghost or the Pentecostals and go right into the Perfection of the son of man when husband and wife will be the self-sing person God musician God please God will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will both be the same Oh Glory to God hallelujah we read the parable until last Wednesday about this some this that man saw the seed and then when Harvest Time come now when they come come he come and see tears with it master you're so good seed Oh Come tears among these is he said the enemy has done it should we cut off this still said no no no no leave it let them grow together let them grow in the church seed tears bride Church wise virgins foolish version am I preaching the word [Applause] seed shock let them grow together but in the time of harvest they're growing they're growing they come like this corn and they grow and growing going yes you know cornea the other way through the rain and when the corn come out you can pick the cone in the time of harvest got any tears together to burn and gather the season to my band all right now election in Abraham justification in Isaac Grace and Jacob perfection in Joseph there is not one thing recorded against Joseph that's the perfection he was love of the father his father gave him a quarter many colors is that right and if you watch yeah that robe without seeing which represented the Holy Spirit that cover his being and today is the holy spirit that covers the church the robe of Many Colors there are seven colors in the rainbow now I want to assure you that Joseph represents the Spirit-filled church with the rainbow coat so only Joseph have this quote you know covered as being and Joseph was hated by his brethren and he was hated Without a Cause what is he called no cause no cause at all and people have a spirit Hate You Without a Cause so the bride will be like Joseph she will get the perfection he hated all being rejected isn't that right so Joseph couldn't help being who he was look at those four Patriarchs Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Abraham calling Isaac election vice versa calling Jacob Grace Joseph affection nothing against him that was God working its way out oh my you could go on right here now God put a seed in you and that seed in you begins to work its way out you're working away out past the mock past the Maya past lies past people mistreating you past pain and suffering the seed working his way out God take this from you God cut that offer for you but there's a seed inside of you the devil didn't put it and the devil can't take it out of you that's Joseph that's the seat of affection inside of you there is nothing against you this morning if you can only catch that if you can only see that this morning and I decided we're not talking about that we're talking about Revelation right now according to this word there is nothing against Joseph and Joseph is this Capstone bride Joseph is this fourth line bride Joseph is this word bride the secret is the word is in the bride Oh Glory to God glory to God hallelujah listen to this Luther Wesley Pentecost the Capstone and the church and the world becomes the same so right after Luther Wesley becomes what the Capstone glory to God he said tree is perfection the ministry comes to its Perfection when it reproduced Christ again in natural among human beings talk about the ministry now foreign has come to its Perfection when it reproduce Christ again in natural among human beings example Jesus advisors are winning and the wine run out what did Jesus do they come and tell Jesus listening message Divine run out he's selling wine Jesus ran in our wine business Jesus need to go back and get wine from the wine cellars what that have to do with he he was against everybody else they come to Jesus and Jesus said take water and fill it and draw it and somebody said whatever he said do it whatever he said just do it and they went on the draw water and when the poor it pour into wine and people who is wine drinkers everybody has leave you all wine for last it looked like you lived the best wine for last into the wine he began at the best wine Jesus bypass the process of cautionary grapes of mixing within water of Covenant energy leaving it 90 days and 100 days he bypass all of that he killed all of that and turn the water into wine hey he turned the word into stimulation of Revelation God could take the word you're hearing and bring it stimulation to you you leave here saying it it's eaten nice it isn't sweet oh give the Lord some presents Hallelujah let me hit you home right now you may be seated all right you're doing good fine you're a great audience love preaching to you the best people I could preach you right now Oh Glory to God you're making me happy that joy in my heart Hallelujah there's a lot of stuff yeah you know gotta go back and listen to this table T here all right here we go there's some Hebrews he had seven varieties of spirit the Bible talk about seven spirits move all the children of God it's not seven spirits it's seven manifestation of the Holy Spirit the seven spirit before God right seven manifolds seven Spirit we finally there are seven colors there are seven two teachers seven is complete seven spirits and those Spirits were perfect the first was the color of red perfect love Redemption if we have time to give those colors and show each one of those colors represents God's Beauty those colors there are seven natural colors those colors represent the purity of God those colors represent the motives of God the deed of God those seven colors they represent seven footages Seven Stars seven angels isn't that right seven ministers seven Messengers seven messages all seven now God was this great spirit we call him Elohim the self-existent one that was before he was God he wasn't always God he was one security called Elohim self-existed one because God is the object of worship and there was nothing to worship because he was there by himself existing with his thoughts and then he created the angels and the angels worship him and then he become God but before he was God he was Elohim the thought and you were in his thought you were in his thinking you were not yet expressed but you were part of him he was thinking about you and when he spoke it became a word and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God but before it was a word it was a thought and earlier I'm thinking you were one of them jeans in his thinking you can't miss it as a try her glory to God the dev is a liar you can miss it if you try Give the Lord some Praises amen but Anthony let's go now watch this now God was this great spirit the seven colors of the rainbow isn't that right God is eternal he was perfect perfect love perfect peace perfect Joy somebody run after a man they get married to the man there is Hell from that man and you want to know what have I done okay the Lord I praise God Somebody went after a woman and that held from the woman and you want to know what on Earth have I done but God have perfect peace perfect love perfect Joy perfect satisfaction oh give the Lord a praise you will be seated all those seven spirits made up God was perfection [Applause] before Lucifer was created because he came in the beginning before the beginning was Elohim seven perfect Spirits the rainbow was perfection [Applause] in the beginning came the word but before the beginning was perfection the spirit do you get it watch this here we go now all those seven spirits made up God was Perfection everything else outside of that has been something that's been perforated from that and the only way that we could come back to Perfection is to come back to that perfection which is God then we come back to Perfection then we have eternal life what is he saying we have the word when we have to get back to the spirit the word was in the book The Mysteries hidden in the book but the spirit was outside the book Seven Thunders sealed the book it was a shot of seven sins the spirit itself God sealed on the inside by the word and they're called to seal you by the spirit seven perfect spirits to go back to Perfection so we have to go beyond the letter of the word and connect back to Ellen the spirit that is coming back to Perfection this last great step must come back to the perfection going right back to seven perfect Spirits Seven Virtues yes seven Thunders yes seven voices yes seven Mysteries yes [Applause] my God my God hallelujah hallelujah Glory I'm finished begin to play something Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah that last step fourth step must come into perfection what's for the catch the headstone you have to be the same
