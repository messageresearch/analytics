[13:57] the
[13:57] closing pages lord of time and
[14:01] we prepare to blend into eternity lord
[14:04] how you have
[14:05] given us so much that you can now expect
[14:08] more from us

[14:16] expected
[14:17] lord we are here reporting for duty
[14:21] lord subjecting ourselves to the
[14:23] discipline of the word
[14:24] law that we could be mentored and
[14:26] tutored and encouraged and
[14:28] lord not be subject to the ideas or
[14:31] thoughts of
[14:32] man lord but to see how in your word

[14:38] kind of situation
[14:40] every kind of conflict every type of
[14:43] challenge

[16:49] amen amen and amen
[16:51] certainly want to welcome one and all uh
[16:53] tonight in the precious name of jesus
[16:55] christ
[16:56] uh it's such a great privilege to be
[16:58] here uh one more time
[17:00] and uh looking to see what god will do
[17:03] for us
[17:04] tonight and it's such a great privilege
[17:07] to
[17:08] be able to gather uh and to as i say to
[17:11] break the
[17:12] the i call it the monotony or the
[17:14] necessity of life and our various
[17:16] responsibilities
[17:17] and to be able to report for duty for
[17:19] what is most uh important
[17:21] you know which is the word of god and
[17:23] our spiritual growth
[17:25] uh in god and and all things concerning
[17:28] what we do every day and how we live and
[17:30] how we act and there's a
[17:32] template you know uh in in the business
[17:35] world
[17:36] there are templates that you use to
[17:38] guide you that you don't have to
[17:39] reinvent the wheel if there's something
[17:41] that you do every day
[17:44] it really makes no sense to do it you
[17:46] know fresh
[17:47] if you have to do it every single day
[17:48] you have a template you you have
[17:50] you have certain things that you have in
[17:52] place that sort to make your job easier
[17:54] that you don't have to reinvent your
[17:55] wheel you know you don't wake up in the
[17:56] morning and try to figure out how to
[17:58] make a car
[17:59] to get to work you know you use the car
[18:01] that has been made
[18:02] you know why you sit down they're trying
[18:03] to invent a car if there's a car already
[18:05] invented
[18:06] and the same thing is there are so many
[18:07] situations and challenges
[18:10] that we encounter on a daily basis how
[18:12] wonderful it is to know
[18:14] that there are templates in the word for
[18:16] how to deal with different situations
[18:18] that we don't have to figure it all out
[18:20] because the answer has been given to us
[18:23] if we only know where to look if we only
[18:26] know what questions to ask
[18:28] uh if we only understand the the amount
[18:30] of insights that god
[18:32] placed in scripture for us and the
[18:34] challenge for us is
[18:36] you know most of us don't spend that
[18:38] quality time to see
[18:40] what god wants us to see in the world so
[18:41] we thank god for his grace that he
[18:44] is revealing himself to us in his way
[18:47] and we thank him for the wisdom of
[18:49] revelation and and how god is able to
[18:52] you know bring light to these things to
[18:54] us that we could
[18:55] move differently act differently you
[18:58] know but over knows
[18:59] i have a major challenge you know i
[19:03] i i i struggle daily with this battle
[19:07] and this battle is a battle of dealing
[19:09] with mediocrity
[19:11] and dealing with average and dealing
[19:13] with
[19:14] people's default positions of that good
[19:17] pass
[19:17] and that's okay and this is acceptable
[19:19] you know and
[19:22] uh i in looking at the more i look at
[19:25] scripture
[19:26] and and as you know for if if you're
[19:28] here for the first time
[19:29] this is a very practical class um i
[19:32] don't consider myself to be super
[19:34] spiritual
[19:35] i believe that the gospel is a practical
[19:37] gospel it is meant
[19:38] to impact our daily lives the word is
[19:41] meant to
[19:42] impact our daily lives it's not meant
[19:44] for us to walk around swell headed
[19:46] because of knowledge and insight and
[19:48] deep mysteries and you don't know how to
[19:50] deal with your wife you don't know how
[19:51] to deal with your children
[19:52] you don't know how to to manage your
[19:55] business your fears
[19:56] your testimony in the workplace these
[19:58] things matter because it matters to god
[20:01] you know uh you read through scripture
[20:03] you see so many examples of how
[20:06] god called men and god called women
[20:08] operated
[20:09] uh it's examples to us that we used to
[20:12] check
[20:13] ourselves you know so i was sharing in a
[20:16] meeting
[20:17] work related this week you know about
[20:20] operational excellence and product
[20:22] excellence there are two things you know
[20:24] one
[20:24] is about the process and one is a body
[20:27] product
[20:28] so operational excellence is about the
[20:30] way you work
[20:31] and these all have scriptural context
[20:34] because a lot of us we accept
[20:35] mediocrity we we accept it of ourselves
[20:38] and we accept it of others and i was
[20:40] giving
[20:41] an illustration about steve jobs
[20:44] of apple one time one of his designers
[20:47] brought
[20:48] one of the devices to him and if you've
[20:51] ever
[20:51] interacted with a ipad or an iphone or
[20:54] any device
[20:56] it is it is characterized by its sleek
[20:58] design
[20:59] you know there's a lot of emphasis and a
[21:01] lot of effort
[21:02] goes into the design you know very few
[21:05] people ever get to see
[21:07] if ever the inside of a device you know
[21:10] very few people could see they have seen
[21:11] the inside
[21:12] of an iphone or the inside of an ipad
[21:16] you know and one of the designers you
[21:18] know was was showing
[21:20] steve jobs certain things about the
[21:22] device
[21:24] and he asked a question about something
[21:26] that was designed
[21:27] inside the device and one of the
[21:30] responses that he got well
[21:31] you know mr jobs uh nobody will see that
[21:35] thing you're asking about
[21:36] it's on the inside of the device and his
[21:38] response was
[21:40] i know it's like that i'm seeing it even
[21:43] though
[21:44] the public will not interact with that
[21:46] design on the inside it is there
[21:48] it bothers me it is not it is not
[21:50] product perfection
[21:52] it is not the way i want to see it
[21:53] because he was as interested
[21:55] in the inside of the device as the
[21:58] outside of the device and many of us
[22:00] we are we we put on this external show
[22:04] what the external is is what is
[22:06] important to us
[22:08] and the reality is on the inside that
[22:10] others may very seldom see or never see
[22:13] there are some crossed wires some some
[22:16] circuits that not designed just right
[22:20] that should bother us but because we
[22:22] believe nobody ever gets exposed to it
[22:24] you know it it could pass it's okay and
[22:27] the reality as you look
[22:28] through scripture to see how god shapes
[22:31] his men
[22:32] and deals with his men and brings the
[22:35] shape thing of character into view
[22:38] god is and i would dare say more
[22:40] interested
[22:41] in what cannot be seen than what you see
[22:45] he is more interested in what in what
[22:47] people don't know about you
[22:50] than what they know about you because
[22:52] the true character
[22:53] and person of who you are is locked up
[22:56] in what people do not see
[22:58] it is impossible for people to see the
[23:01] the
[23:01] hidden envy and the and the hidden
[23:04] jealousies and the
[23:05] the hidden challenges that that you try
[23:08] to lock up inside of you
[23:10] but god sees it and it matters to him
[23:12] and he's not satisfied with the external
[23:15] and i'm saying to myself if somebody
[23:17] like steve jobs
[23:18] who is a natural man you know could be
[23:21] that
[23:22] obsesses you would they use if you if
[23:24] you study
[23:26] the the business life of steve jobs they
[23:28] would said he was
[23:29] obsessed about product perfection it was
[23:32] an
[23:32] obsession for him obsessed means a
[23:36] disproportionate amount of time is spent
[23:39] focused on something
[23:41] you know it it consumes your thinking it
[23:43] wakes you up in the morning because
[23:44] you're not satisfied
[23:46] until it operates a certain way you're
[23:49] not satisfied
[23:50] until it works a certain way you're not
[23:53] satisfied until
[23:55] certain metrics are achieved or certain
[23:57] things are accomplished
[23:59] you know and i'm thinking if a natural
[24:00] man could be so obsessed
[24:02] about his ability to have something that
[24:04] he could even perfect or better than
[24:06] how much is god interested in seeing a
[24:09] perfect man walk the earth how
[24:11] how much is god interested in putting
[24:14] things in place to see you come
[24:15] to perfection you know so it's it's
[24:18] inspiring to us to see
[24:20] true scripture through the word how god
[24:23] is
[24:24] is is is hiding things for us to see
[24:27] the shaping of his sons and and shaping
[24:29] of his daughters so
[24:31] tonight by the grace of god i uh have a
[24:34] little thought
[24:34] that i want to share with you tonight
[24:37] and uh
[24:38] i will preface it by a scripture
[24:41] um which is not our substantive
[24:43] scripture but i do want to you know
[24:46] take a a a a line you don't have to find
[24:49] it because
[24:50] we want to go into the old testament but
[24:52] in matthew 5 and verse 9
[24:55] the bible said blessed are the
[24:58] peacemakers
[25:00] for they shall be called the children of
[25:03] god
[25:04] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[25:07] shall be called
[25:08] the children of god so it means that
[25:13] there's you know ecclesiastes speaks of
[25:16] a time of of
[25:17] war and a time for peace and you know it
[25:19] takes wisdom
[25:20] and understanding and knowledge to be
[25:22] able to rightly divide the world to
[25:24] place
[25:24] in context what should be in context but
[25:27] there's a blessing with being a
[25:28] peacemaker
[25:30] because the peacemakers are the ones who
[25:32] are called the children of god and
[25:34] you know as you look through life and
[25:36] the challenges of life
[25:38] and i want to come into your home this
[25:40] evening if you'll allow me to do so
[25:42] uh conflict is part of life
[25:46] there's conflict in the workplace
[25:48] there's conflict in
[25:50] families there's conflict and so many
[25:52] things and
[25:54] and and and my text or my thought
[25:57] tonight is
[25:57] are you a peacemaker that is the
[25:59] question i want to ask each question
[26:01] tonight
[26:02] are you a peacemaker so for a title for
[26:05] this bible study tonight it's
[26:07] are you a peacemaker a study of abigail
[26:11] so that's the thought tonight are you a
[26:13] peacemaker
[26:15] a study of abigail and to find this
[26:18] we're going to now go to our our subject
[26:20] which is found in
[26:22] first samuel 25
[26:25] first samuel 25 and we will you know
[26:28] operate in that chapter for this
[26:30] teaching tonight
[26:32] first samuel 25.
[26:37] everybody feeling fine so
[26:40] first samuel 25
[26:43] starts interestingly and
[26:47] this is the kind of stuff that excites
[26:49] me because i've realized that words
[26:53] words are more important than we realize
[26:57] it's only recently i was sharing my
[26:58] brother over the words are so powerful
[27:02] if you understand how powerful words are
[27:04] and
[27:05] how the words in the right order has an
[27:08] impact and how god doesn't play around
[27:10] with words because every
[27:11] spoken word has the ability to create
[27:15] and words in the right order has the
[27:18] ability
[27:18] to heal words in a different order
[27:22] has the ability to hurt people words
[27:26] rearranged have the ability to strip
[27:28] someone of their confidence
[27:31] words in a certain order if you take a
[27:34] certain
[27:35] you know quantity of words and put them
[27:37] in a bucket
[27:38] and you arrange them a certain way you
[27:40] can motivate your child
[27:42] or you could discourage your child you
[27:44] could rearrange those words
[27:46] to help your wife or to break her down
[27:49] you can rearrange those words to
[27:52] accelerate war
[27:54] or to create peace you can rearrange
[27:56] those words to
[27:58] to change your disposition to change
[28:00] your outlook
[28:01] on life you know and when you read
[28:04] the word we call the bible the word
[28:08] i begin to have a greater respect of how
[28:11] god inspired the written word
[28:14] and the insight of the revealed word on
[28:17] the written word
[28:18] so you have to take it together and
[28:21] i found myself in recent times uh asking
[28:24] questions
[28:25] and and and and i was sharing my brother
[28:27] over there i want to speak
[28:29] to the church on questions and the power
[28:30] of questions and you know so
[28:32] first samuel 25 starts off and samuel
[28:35] died
[28:37] now
[28:41] that alone just stops me and samuel died
[28:45] because it is not just three words and
[28:48] samuel
[28:49] died is more than three words
[28:52] because and samuel died automatically
[28:56] means the
[28:57] end of an era
[29:02] it means a line in isan is drawn and
[29:05] samuel died
[29:08] it means the person who was doing
[29:10] certain things
[29:12] was no longer there and samuel died
[29:18] now the book of samuel
[29:21] and the character of samuel is one of
[29:24] the most interesting in scripture
[29:26] and i don't know if you've ever studied
[29:27] the character of samuel but i wanted to
[29:29] just
[29:30] highlight a few things about samuel
[29:31] because the fact that this
[29:33] chapter that we are reading starts off
[29:35] with his death places a context on what
[29:38] is to follow
[29:39] we can't advance beyond this until we
[29:42] address
[29:43] this the fact that samuel is now dead
[29:45] and what samuel's debt also represents
[29:50] so i just want to read it and then come
[29:51] back to this and samuel died and all the
[29:54] israelites were gathered together
[29:57] and lamented him and buried him in his
[30:00] house at ramah
[30:02] and david arose and went down to the
[30:06] wilderness of paran
[30:08] so we see a context we see a few things
[30:10] happening here
[30:11] samuel's death has brought together
[30:14] all the israelites so it's a single
[30:18] force a single act
[30:20] it is what we will call today like a
[30:22] state funeral
[30:24] it is as if the president of a country
[30:26] were to pass on
[30:28] but why would the death of samuel have
[30:31] such an impact
[30:32] that's one question that i ask the other
[30:35] question i have is
[30:36] israel is gathering and if you study
[30:38] from first samuel to
[30:40] uh of chapter one to chapter 24 we would
[30:44] see
[30:44] a number of times where samuel is
[30:47] rebuking people
[30:49] correcting people telling people what to
[30:51] do and what not to do
[30:52] and for the most part they ignore him
[30:55] consistently
[30:57] but his death they rally around him and
[30:59] they're lamenting and they're crying
[31:03] some scholars would actually call it
[31:04] hypocritical
[31:06] because the man who you did not listen
[31:08] to you did not pay attention to
[31:11] suddenly you are there crying at his
[31:14] death
[31:15] but the reality is during his life you
[31:17] never regarded him
[31:19] this samuel who is now dead is the same
[31:22] samuel
[31:23] who lamented when they wanted to get
[31:27] a king and and he cried to god saying
[31:30] what to do and god said they haven't
[31:31] rejected
[31:32] you they have rejected me
[31:35] this same samuel was the one who told
[31:37] them if you choose this road
[31:39] there will be consequences to your
[31:41] actions
[31:42] and the bible says despite his warnings
[31:45] despite his admonitions despite his
[31:48] encouragement
[31:49] they still chose to do what they wanted
[31:50] to do but yet
[31:52] his death brings a state funeral and
[31:54] they are lamenting
[31:56] the death of samuel before i go on i
[31:58] just want to highlight a few things
[32:01] about samuel that i want us to consider
[32:04] we will recall that
[32:05] samuel is one of the few characters in
[32:08] scripture
[32:09] whose birth is carefully described
[32:12] many characters in scripture we don't
[32:14] have much information about their birth
[32:16] however we find with samuel we see a
[32:19] broken sad hannah who cannot give birth
[32:23] is there the altar crying because she
[32:26] wants to have a child
[32:28] and she's praying to god and she makes a
[32:30] promise to god that she has a child that
[32:32] she would
[32:32] she would give that child over to the
[32:34] lord and in so doing
[32:37] god hears a prayer in fact the bible
[32:39] says god remembered her
[32:42] and she gives birth to a young baby
[32:45] named samuel who is the only character
[32:49] in scripture
[32:51] that actually is simultaneously a
[32:53] prophet
[32:55] a judge and the priest
[32:58] of all the titles you could have in the
[33:01] old testament
[33:02] there are only four titles
[33:05] that have been shared throughout the old
[33:06] testament
[33:08] we have prophets we have judges
[33:11] we have priests and we have kings
[33:14] samuel is the only character who
[33:17] effectively totally carries all of these
[33:21] titles
[33:22] except the title of a king he's a
[33:24] prophet
[33:26] he's a priest and he's actually the very
[33:29] last judge
[33:30] so samuel's death is extremely
[33:33] significant
[33:34] because in samuel's death was the death
[33:37] of the last
[33:38] judge that ever ruled israel
[33:41] in samuel's death was also the death of
[33:44] the first
[33:45] prophet of the lines of prophet and i
[33:48] can reference it
[33:49] in scripture in fact uh in the book of
[33:52] acts
[33:53] let me just uh say it here acts 3 24
[33:57] you you don't have to find it and uh
[33:59] likewise all the prophets were spoken
[34:01] from from
[34:02] samuel and his successors onward so
[34:06] in let me just just get it quickly
[34:12] this is acts 3 24.
[34:17] yea and all the prophets from samuel and
[34:20] those that follow after
[34:22] as many as i've spoken have likewise
[34:24] what all of these days
[34:26] so in the book of acts we see preaching
[34:29] that places samuel as the first of the
[34:32] line of prophets now we know before
[34:33] samuel
[34:34] the major prophet that would have
[34:36] existed would have been moses but after
[34:37] moses there was this break
[34:39] because after joshua's death it was all
[34:41] george's so samuel
[34:43] was the last judge and the first of the
[34:45] line of prophets
[34:46] and we know samuel is also a priest so
[34:48] i'm placing our context here
[34:50] because we are building to something
[34:54] in his role as prophet
[34:57] in his office as priest he was also
[35:01] the only one well he was the one
[35:04] to anoint the first king of israel
[35:08] now i want us to appreciate the fact
[35:09] that when we when we
[35:11] knock saul as the first king the reality
[35:14] is
[35:15] saul was a god-appointed king i wanted
[35:18] to be very
[35:19] very cautious when we throw saul out and
[35:22] say well
[35:22] well well i found a better king i found
[35:24] a better man in david but the reality is
[35:27] when saul was appointed king
[35:30] this was also god's blessing upon soul
[35:35] so samuel was the only one to have
[35:38] witnessed
[35:39] the creation of the monarchy as it were
[35:42] so he anointed two kings but at the
[35:45] point of his death he only saw one king
[35:48] because david was still coming into
[35:50] power
[35:51] all right so i just lay enough
[35:52] background on the context of what's
[35:54] happening here
[35:55] in samuel's act of anointing kings
[35:59] plural two kings
[36:02] he also created a situation of of great
[36:04] conflict
[36:06] not that he pushed it or accelerated it
[36:09] but the reality is because of saul's two
[36:12] acts of disobedience
[36:13] there were two acts of disobedience that
[36:15] saul had
[36:16] one was he was supposed to wait until
[36:18] samuel came and samuel was supposed to
[36:20] come in in seven days and because he
[36:22] didn't use samuel he take it upon
[36:23] himself to offer a
[36:25] sacrifice and someone said well this
[36:26] will be god because of this there are
[36:28] consequences
[36:31] but it was the second act when god
[36:33] remembered what the amalekites did the
[36:35] children of israel and he ordered saul
[36:37] to go and kill them
[36:38] when saul decided to make a command
[36:40] decision
[36:41] and save somebody the animals and save
[36:44] king aegon and he make a judgment call
[36:47] and god said listen
[36:48] that is not what i instructed you to do
[36:50] and then it was at that point
[36:53] that the kingdom was taken from saul so
[36:55] when you look at scripture
[36:57] if saul had obeyed god
[37:00] it would have been a different
[37:01] trajectory now we understand god and
[37:03] predestination we understand god for so
[37:05] all of these
[37:06] but i want us to understand that
[37:08] connection between
[37:09] decisions and consequences because the
[37:12] bible makes it very clear that it was
[37:13] upon that
[37:14] failure of soul to act upon the
[37:17] instructions that came
[37:18] from god that broke the kingship
[37:22] and at that point samuel steps in to now
[37:24] anoint
[37:26] david while saul
[37:30] is still on the throne david anointed
[37:33] the bible said when david was anointed
[37:36] that the spirit of god came upon him
[37:38] from that moment and at that exact same
[37:40] moment
[37:40] that evil spirit came upon saul so
[37:42] samuel is connected to all of these
[37:45] great activities when we hear
[37:46] about a man after god's own heart samuel
[37:50] was instrumental in the unfolding of
[37:52] this
[37:53] just let me lay a couple quick points
[37:55] and we're going to get to our subject so
[37:57] samuel is a miracle child and this
[38:00] scripture we're reading here
[38:01] saying that this great miracle child
[38:04] has now gone on
[38:07] samuel name means name of god he is from
[38:10] the tribe of levi
[38:12] he is the last judge he anoints the
[38:14] first two kings of israel
[38:16] he is the first of the line of prophets
[38:18] he is a priest
[38:20] you can read them first time you have he
[38:21] offered sacrifices he's a nazarite so
[38:23] like samson
[38:24] his here was not cut he is also the only
[38:28] ghost
[38:29] we meet in the context that saul went to
[38:32] the witch of endor
[38:33] to raise samuel back up again
[38:37] in second chronicles the bible said that
[38:41] there was celebrated a passover
[38:46] like no passover compared to the days of
[38:50] samuel so
[38:51] samuel was credited in scripture
[38:55] with the greatest of passovers samuel is
[38:58] remembered for his
[38:59] prayers because in psalms 99 it
[39:01] references samuel prayers
[39:04] so samuel is unique and and startling to
[39:07] some we have first
[39:08] and second samuel but samuel has not
[39:10] mentioned at all
[39:11] in second samuel and samuel died
[39:16] and with him died a history
[39:19] things he would have seen emotions that
[39:21] he would have felt god would have seen
[39:23] how long will you mourn
[39:24] for saul all of this is wrapped up in
[39:27] the death of samuel at a time
[39:29] when king david is on the run
[39:32] for students of scripture we can't get
[39:34] into all of it now but
[39:36] first samuel 25 the scripture we are in
[39:38] tonight is
[39:39] at a point in time when this
[39:42] heat this conflict this issue
[39:46] between saul and david is at a point
[39:48] where david is running for his life
[39:52] and although david is running for his
[39:54] life the death of samuel
[39:56] cannot even bring david into
[39:58] reconciliation
[40:00] with saul or even bring david to even
[40:02] attend the funeral
[40:05] everybody with me so again we're
[40:08] building
[40:09] and samuel died and all the israelites
[40:11] were gathered together and lamented him
[40:13] and buried him in his house
[40:15] at rima and david arose and went down to
[40:17] the wilderness of parents
[40:20] i want us to appreciate the fact that he
[40:22] is clearly not heading to where
[40:24] everybody else is heading because of
[40:26] obviously saul's eating it the bible
[40:28] says in verses in two
[40:30] chapters before saul every day was
[40:32] looking for
[40:33] david the anointing i was upon david we
[40:37] will recall that
[40:38] in in in in a few chapters before david
[40:41] would have dealt with goliath
[40:43] and it's interesting because the bible
[40:45] said david was saul's armor bearer
[40:48] david was saul's musician and it was
[40:51] only after goliad was killed
[40:53] saul is inquiring whose david father is
[40:58] so it is as if it's just a little boy
[41:00] that's around he
[41:01] he's not too significant he carried my
[41:02] armor he played music and stuff
[41:04] but when he killed goliath saul takes
[41:07] him now fully under his wings
[41:09] until the sisters got anointed to write
[41:12] a special
[41:14] and when they wrote this song the song
[41:17] is what started changing relationship
[41:19] the song was that saul killed
[41:22] thousands but david killed ten thousands
[41:27] and that song got soul so affected
[41:31] the bible said he got so angry that he
[41:34] processed that
[41:35] song to mean that the only thing that
[41:38] david don't have now is he tron meaning
[41:40] he have everything else
[41:41] that's how saul was so affected
[41:47] so this is the context so by the time we
[41:49] come the first samuel 25
[41:51] i want us to also see the picture of
[41:53] david
[41:55] the picture of david didn't do anything
[41:57] to getty people's attention
[41:59] he didn't do anything to to try to
[42:02] displace soul
[42:03] in fact he had been a very good servant
[42:05] a very good student everything he had
[42:07] done to this point
[42:08] was in character of being in favor with
[42:11] god and favor with men
[42:14] he hasn't tried to undermine saul in any
[42:16] way
[42:17] he was living out something but i want
[42:19] to draw attention to
[42:21] call it king making there's a phrase
[42:23] that is used
[42:24] more in the political ring about king
[42:26] makers king makers
[42:27] are the individuals who influence
[42:31] decisions about kingship and leadership
[42:33] and and they help
[42:35] shape somebody who is about to go speak
[42:38] and how you should act and
[42:39] the people are around your circle and
[42:40] these things
[42:42] and this scripture we are into tonight
[42:45] is about
[42:46] king making so this title tonight could
[42:49] have been the making of a king
[42:52] but i want to focus on abigail because
[42:55] she helped
[42:56] she was almost a hell being a king maker
[42:58] but her approach
[43:00] is what i wanted to learn from tonight
[43:02] anybody wait with me
[43:04] so i want to before i go further make
[43:06] very clear
[43:07] that david being on the run was not
[43:10] accidental
[43:12] david being on the run was character
[43:15] formation
[43:16] that he didn't even understand i wanted
[43:18] to understand that with god there's no
[43:20] accident so
[43:21] people go through different experiences
[43:23] for job it was loss of certain things
[43:26] anybody with me different experiences
[43:28] you go through
[43:29] for god to shape the kind of character
[43:31] he wants
[43:32] because this king is the king out of
[43:35] whom
[43:36] son of david would come anybody with me
[43:39] so
[43:40] david as son of david and we talked
[43:43] about
[43:43] judah as we were dealing with joseph it
[43:46] was god taken his sons through certain
[43:48] experiences
[43:49] so that certain things can happen out of
[43:51] their lives anybody with with me all
[43:53] right
[43:54] so let's build a little bit and samuel
[43:56] died
[43:57] and all the israelites are gathered
[43:58] together and lamented him
[44:00] and buried him in his house at rhema and
[44:02] david arose and went down to the
[44:04] wilderness apparent
[44:05] which basically means he's not in the
[44:07] same direction with everybody else he
[44:08] still has to operate outside of the
[44:10] circle of this as much as david would
[44:12] like to pay his respects he really can't
[44:14] because saul will kill him if you see
[44:16] him anybody with me all right
[44:17] verse two let's go and there was a man
[44:21] in my own whose possessions were in
[44:23] camel
[44:25] and the man was very great and he had
[44:28] three thousand sheep
[44:30] and a thousand goats and he was sharing
[44:33] his sheep in camel
[44:35] sharing his sheep in camel and
[44:37] possessions in common
[44:38] and in my own is the same thing like
[44:41] saying he running a conglomerate
[44:44] he is so vast in his business efforts
[44:46] that although he is in my own
[44:48] his reach his influence his spread is in
[44:51] the camel he actually have a sharing
[44:53] operation
[44:54] that's removed from his physical
[44:56] location because he is just that big
[44:58] everybody with me he is successful
[45:02] he is wealthy when the bible says you're
[45:04] very great you're very great there's no
[45:06] argument we can have about it the bible
[45:08] said the man was very great
[45:10] whose possessions were in camel all
[45:12] right
[45:13] three now the name of the man was
[45:16] neighbor
[45:17] now
[45:21] whenever there are many instances in
[45:23] scripture where
[45:24] the name is not given so the bible said
[45:27] there was a certain man who did this
[45:29] it was a certain man who did this there
[45:31] was for example the sunnah might woman
[45:33] there's no name given she says he
[45:35] shouldn't my woman
[45:36] but when the bible tells you the man
[45:38] name it is not accidental it is very
[45:41] deliberate
[45:42] so the name of the man was neighbor
[45:44] neighbor means fool
[45:48] so the fact that the bible highlights
[45:51] his name
[45:52] is to bring reference to names are
[45:54] important
[45:55] names have meaning names characterize
[45:58] the nature of a person
[46:00] all right so let's let's go so
[46:04] now the name of the man was neighbor and
[46:05] the name of his wife abigail
[46:08] and she was a woman of good
[46:10] understanding and of a beautiful
[46:12] countenance
[46:14] in fact in all of scripture this might
[46:16] be the only time
[46:17] where there is a description of beauty
[46:20] and intelligence together like this in
[46:21] scripture
[46:23] just characterizing this woman name
[46:26] abigail she was a woman of good
[46:28] understanding
[46:30] which in the amplified it says she was
[46:33] intelligent
[46:34] and beautiful in appearance but the man
[46:37] was chillish
[46:40] which means harsh and evil
[46:44] in his doings and he was of the house of
[46:47] caleb
[46:48] of the house of caleb is almost like
[46:50] saying
[46:52] we could expect better because we know
[46:55] his
[46:55] we know caleb's pedigree
[46:58] anybody with me so we have a situation
[47:02] here
[47:03] of a marriage of non-equals
[47:08] an inconvenient marriage on the left
[47:12] corner
[47:12] of this battle we have a woman who is
[47:15] beautiful
[47:16] and understanding and on the right
[47:18] corner we have a man who is chillish
[47:20] evil in his doings what a
[47:24] mismatch in this relationship
[47:28] what a relationship nightmare
[47:31] when we have the temperament of one
[47:33] person being of good understanding
[47:36] it didn't just say understanding you
[47:38] know good understanding
[47:40] you can have understanding but when the
[47:41] bible say you have good understanding
[47:43] that's a little higher than just
[47:44] understanding
[47:49] there's a lot i can say there but i will
[47:50] see the lord will bring it a little
[47:52] later on
[47:54] verse 4 and david heard
[47:57] in the wilderness that nabal did share
[47:59] his sheep
[48:03] five and david sent out 10 young men
[48:07] and david said unto the young men get
[48:10] you up
[48:11] to carmel and go to neville and greet
[48:14] him
[48:15] in my name
[48:18] so you can see david despite the
[48:21] pressure he is under
[48:22] despite the fact that he is hiding
[48:25] despite the fact he's on the run
[48:27] he is still operating with courtesy he
[48:30] hears of this man named neighbor he
[48:32] doesn't know him
[48:33] he doesn't know his character he doesn't
[48:35] know he's serious he doesn't know he's
[48:37] evil in his doings
[48:39] but out of him being on the run he's
[48:41] looking for
[48:42] some level of fellowship some level of
[48:43] relationship
[48:45] he said go to camel and go to naval and
[48:48] greet him in my name
[48:50] and thus shall he say to him that live
[48:52] it in prosperity
[48:54] peace be brought to thee and peace be to
[48:57] thine house
[48:59] and peace be unto all that thou hast now
[49:02] that's a powerful greeting
[49:04] so we see david extending only positive
[49:07] greetings
[49:07] peace be to thee peace be to thine house
[49:10] and peace be unto all that thou has
[49:14] and he's continuing and now i have heard
[49:18] that dao has sharers which are the
[49:19] people who are taking care of the sheep
[49:21] now thy shepherds which were with us we
[49:23] heard them not
[49:26] neither was there ought missing unto
[49:29] them all the while
[49:30] they were in carmel
[49:33] so basically what is unfolding before us
[49:37] is that david and his men
[49:41] had obviously encountered the sharing
[49:44] crew that belonged to naval and had
[49:48] obviously spent a little time with him
[49:51] everybody with me and he is sending now
[49:54] a report
[49:55] of the encounter that he has been having
[49:59] with nabel's men
[50:04] verse 8 ask thy young men and they will
[50:07] show thee so
[50:08] david is saying we encountered your men
[50:10] and rebelled my davis and you run with
[50:12] the army and he not only run
[50:13] you know having a social movement it's
[50:16] his season soldiers with him
[50:18] david is on the run at any point he can
[50:20] meet the reigning king
[50:21] so he's in a fighting mood you are
[50:23] fighting men and he's saying we
[50:25] encountered your men
[50:26] thy shepherds we heard them not so we
[50:28] encountered them we didn't touch them we
[50:29] didn't hurt them
[50:30] neither there was earth missing unto
[50:32] them meaning we didn't take anything
[50:33] from them
[50:34] all the while they were in camel somehow
[50:36] we run into each other
[50:37] we didn't touch your people we said in
[50:39] peace and greeting unto you
[50:41] ask thy young men so don't ask us you
[50:44] ask your own men
[50:45] and they will show you wherefore
[50:50] let the young men find favor in thine
[50:52] eyes
[50:53] for we come in a good day give i pray
[50:57] thee
[50:58] whatsoever commented thy hand unto thy
[51:00] servants unto my son david
[51:02] so i wanted to understand the context
[51:04] that was building here i don't know if
[51:05] you ever studied this before
[51:06] but basically david is saying we
[51:10] encountered your men
[51:13] we had them with us we didn't hurt them
[51:17] we didn't take anything from them we
[51:19] basically protected them
[51:23] ask them they will tell you we didn't
[51:25] hurt them we didn't take in them so we
[51:27] want
[51:27] you to give us whatever is in your heart
[51:30] to bless us with
[51:32] because your men were out here
[51:34] unprotected
[51:36] and we protected them we didn't rub them
[51:38] we didn't take anything with them
[51:39] bless your people so this is david i
[51:42] want us to see a king in the making
[51:45] because he's an iran reaching almost a
[51:47] point of desperation now
[51:50] he has a need and he is asking a very
[51:53] wealthy man
[51:54] listen whatever on your heart to bless
[51:56] us bless us now
[52:00] verse 9 we're not going to meet too long
[52:03] tonight and when david's young men came
[52:05] they speak
[52:06] the naval according to all those words
[52:08] in the name of david
[52:10] and ceased so they basically went
[52:14] and communicated to them and the bible
[52:17] says then they waited that cease means
[52:20] they expressed what david said to
[52:21] express we met your men on the road
[52:24] we we encountered them we didn't take
[52:26] anything from them we didn't fight with
[52:27] them in fact they were with us so they
[52:28] were obviously on
[52:29] our protection we're looking for a
[52:31] little blessing we need
[52:32] you know something give us a little
[52:34] something for protecting them
[52:36] verse 10 a neighbor answered david's
[52:38] servant
[52:40] and said who is david and who
[52:43] is this son of jesse there be many
[52:47] servants nowadays
[52:48] that break away every man from his
[52:52] master
[52:57] so this question who is david
[53:00] is not a question about identity
[53:04] it is like god asking adam adam where
[53:08] now
[53:08] in the garden of eden he wasn't asking
[53:10] adam of his location
[53:12] because obviously he knew his location
[53:15] he was asking adam of his spiritual
[53:17] position where are you you're not where
[53:18] i left you
[53:19] i left you in power now you're not in
[53:20] power left in dominion now we're letting
[53:22] dominion left you in charge
[53:23] now you just give up your seat so the
[53:25] question who is david
[53:27] it's impossible for neighbor to not know
[53:29] who david was
[53:31] because one if you knew saul you would
[53:33] have seen him around seoul as amabera
[53:36] two if you ever went to the palace you'd
[53:37] have seen their playing music
[53:39] three everybody heard about in the
[53:41] encounter of goliath so it's impossible
[53:42] for you to not know
[53:44] trust me the song was the song everybody
[53:46] was singing soul came
[53:48] thousands david killed ten thousands
[53:51] then
[53:51] if all of those four points didn't bring
[53:55] knowledge of david to your attention the
[53:57] fact that saul made an edict
[53:59] to find david and it was something that
[54:01] was expressed throughout all the land
[54:03] and in fact that saul himself spent a
[54:05] disproportionate amount of time hunting
[54:07] for david
[54:08] made nabel knew exactly who he was the
[54:11] question
[54:12] neighbor was asking was one of a
[54:15] question to create insult it was a
[54:18] question to say david is a nobody
[54:21] who is david who does he think he is
[54:25] who he feel he is coming up here asking
[54:27] for anything
[54:29] who is this son of jesse the fact that
[54:31] you're asking
[54:32] son of jesse is even like a foot in
[54:34] insult meaning
[54:36] what line you come from there'll be many
[54:39] servers down with this that break
[54:40] every man from his master so this
[54:43] statement
[54:44] break from his master
[54:47] is is could be a something is a hit
[54:49] against
[54:50] the perceived break between david and
[54:52] saul
[54:54] a couple of people running around there
[54:55] who who break from their leadership you
[54:57] know
[54:58] they don't want to subject yourself you
[55:00] know who is this david right
[55:02] listen to verse 11. shall i then take my
[55:05] bread
[55:06] and my water and my flesh that i have
[55:08] killed for my shearers and give it unto
[55:10] men
[55:11] whom i know not when they be
[55:17] so neighbor know that is food that i'm
[55:19] looking for
[55:20] now i want to understand the context
[55:22] david is on the run
[55:23] he has very little places where he can
[55:25] be safe
[55:26] because saul is still king it's food he
[55:30] wants
[55:30] so dear neighbor is smart enough to know
[55:33] that his food
[55:34] that he's interested in he says shall i
[55:36] take my bread and my water
[55:37] and my flesh that i've killed for my
[55:39] shearers and give it unto men whom i
[55:40] know not when they be
[55:43] so david's young men turned their way
[55:45] basically to back around
[55:48] and went again basically and returned
[55:52] and came and told david these things
[55:56] everybody with me tonight and verse 13
[56:01] and david sent unto his men good ye on
[56:03] every man his sword
[56:07] david says strap up and they girded on
[56:10] every man his sword
[56:12] and david also girded on his sword and
[56:15] they went up after david about
[56:17] 400 men and 200 are bored
[56:21] by this stuff so basically
[56:25] it now makes clear that david was
[56:27] rolling with about 600
[56:29] you know the mighty men of david these
[56:31] were not soldiers who won payroll
[56:34] these are soldiers who know they're
[56:36] rolling with the future king
[56:37] these are soldiers who prepare to die
[56:39] these are the soldiers who
[56:41] just got to the enemy for a drink of
[56:42] water these are a different breed of men
[56:46] david was so angry and this is what i
[56:48] want to build now
[56:50] david got so angry at the response of
[56:53] naval
[56:54] that he took two thirds of his men 400
[56:58] left 200 to guard the provisions
[57:01] and the supplies that he had
[57:06] to head to deal with neighbors insulins
[57:12] verse 14 but one of the young men
[57:18] this is one of neighbors young men we're
[57:20] dealing with now
[57:21] told abigail neighbor's wife saying
[57:24] behold david sent messengers
[57:28] out of the wilderness to salute our
[57:30] master
[57:31] and he railed on them
[57:34] in the amplified that says
[57:37] one of neighbors young men told abigail
[57:39] neighbor's wife listen
[57:41] david sent messengers out of the
[57:42] wilderness to bless greet our master
[57:45] and he shouted at them in contempt you
[57:48] remember when i said earlier who is
[57:49] david
[57:50] that's contempt it was derogatory it was
[57:53] insolence it was disrespectful
[57:57] and the young man goes on explaining to
[58:00] abigail
[58:00] in verse 15 but the men were very good
[58:03] unto us
[58:04] and we were not hurt neither missed we
[58:07] anything
[58:08] as long as we were conversant with them
[58:11] when we in the fields
[58:13] listen now to what was taking place that
[58:15] is now coming out
[58:18] they were a wall unto us bored by night
[58:22] and day all the while we were with them
[58:24] keeping
[58:25] the sheep so in the amblyfire it says
[58:29] they were a wall of protection to us
[58:32] both night and day all the time that we
[58:34] were them
[58:35] tending the sheep now therefore
[58:38] know and consider what thou will do
[58:41] for evil is determined against our
[58:44] master
[58:45] and against all his houseful for he is
[58:48] such a son
[58:49] of belial
[58:52] that a man cannot speak to him
[58:55] now have you ever met people who you
[58:57] can't talk to them
[59:00] you can't get a word in by them because
[59:01] influence them
[59:03] so this young man who worked
[59:06] for the neighbor is communicating to his
[59:08] wife listen
[59:09] i don't know if you're aware of it
[59:11] because the master don't even know what
[59:13] already took place but while we were out
[59:14] there
[59:15] david men were protecting us they didn't
[59:16] ask for anything did they do anything
[59:18] they sent greetings the actual whatever
[59:21] the master want to give
[59:22] and he spoke to them in contempt send
[59:24] them away
[59:25] i don't know what you want to do over
[59:26] the matter but i don't know who could
[59:29] talk to this man because
[59:30] nobody could reach this man nobody could
[59:33] influence this man
[59:35] all right anybody with me
[59:39] verse 18 then abigail made haste
[59:44] now this is really powerful
[59:48] this woman of good understanding this
[59:51] woman of beauty this woman of character
[59:53] this woman who is a decision maker this
[59:55] woman who
[59:57] sees the consequences of actions made
[1:00:00] haste the bible said
[1:00:02] she hurried and took 200 loaves
[1:00:05] and two bottles of wine and five sheep
[1:00:09] ready dressed and five measures of
[1:00:12] parched corn
[1:00:14] and 100 clusters of raisins
[1:00:17] and 200 cakes of figs and laid them on
[1:00:20] asses
[1:00:21] and she said unto her servants go on
[1:00:24] before me
[1:00:25] behold i come after you but she told not
[1:00:29] her husband neighbor
[1:00:33] so this woman has the wisdom to see
[1:00:36] the context of the situation because you
[1:00:39] recognize if
[1:00:40] nothing is done david is so angry
[1:00:43] now bear in mind david don't know her
[1:00:46] david don't know who in the house david
[1:00:49] is just so angry of the contempt and the
[1:00:51] disrespect now i don't know you know
[1:00:53] their situation like the last straw that
[1:00:55] bring the camel back
[1:00:57] david has been on the run for a while
[1:00:59] the man is hungry
[1:01:01] he air asks for a salary for protection
[1:01:03] he acts a little food to eat
[1:01:05] and it's almost like listen if i fed up
[1:01:07] i fed up running i fed up this
[1:01:08] this this need to stop today this might
[1:01:10] have been prosperity for it he don't
[1:01:12] want to bless us
[1:01:13] so david is angry but that anger that
[1:01:16] david has
[1:01:17] is not the anger that a king should have
[1:01:19] anybody with me
[1:01:22] so there's something in david that needs
[1:01:23] to be addressed so i want to that's why
[1:01:25] i said this chapter is about king making
[1:01:27] as much as it is about peacemaking
[1:01:30] because what is in david what is being
[1:01:33] expressed in david
[1:01:35] god could not allow that
[1:01:40] so i want to see the deeper lessons here
[1:01:42] despite
[1:01:43] you see the lesson david is being taught
[1:01:46] here is
[1:01:47] sometimes your efforts and your actions
[1:01:50] you might think you deserve something
[1:01:52] for it
[1:01:53] but you you that level of this year's
[1:01:56] entitlement
[1:01:57] remember we dealt with entitlement some
[1:01:59] weeks back david felt that he was
[1:02:02] entitled
[1:02:03] to be compensated for what he did
[1:02:08] so his anger understand this neighbor
[1:02:11] didn't owe him a no
[1:02:13] i wanted to see the perspectives here he
[1:02:15] didn't enter into a contract of service
[1:02:18] with nabel he didn't go to navel and say
[1:02:21] listen
[1:02:21] i have security forces we're going to
[1:02:23] come and protect a man when we finish
[1:02:24] just protection detail
[1:02:26] this is what we wanted to get paid for
[1:02:28] david
[1:02:29] offered a service without being asked
[1:02:31] and then it seems he want to lock the
[1:02:33] man neck to pay him
[1:02:34] for service demanding order
[1:02:37] now on the one hand we could empathize
[1:02:40] with
[1:02:41] david's men being a wall of protection
[1:02:43] around it
[1:02:45] but what right does david have of
[1:02:47] entitlement to say
[1:02:48] neighbor have to pay me they will have
[1:02:51] to give me something
[1:02:53] so these are call it the issues
[1:02:56] that have to come to the fore that
[1:02:59] sometimes
[1:02:59] we process things in our mind that will
[1:03:03] put us in trouble
[1:03:04] anybody with me so
[1:03:07] here you have a situation that
[1:03:11] the bible has many stories about men but
[1:03:13] here we have
[1:03:14] a a woman being used
[1:03:17] in a powerful way to influence a king
[1:03:22] who is not yet a king
[1:03:25] and she has the wisdom because she is in
[1:03:27] a relationship that is
[1:03:29] a traumatic relationship
[1:03:32] the servant is saying to her you know
[1:03:34] your husband don't listen to nobody
[1:03:36] and it is evident from her actions that
[1:03:38] he husband was even listening to her
[1:03:41] because if he was willing to listen to
[1:03:43] her she could have gone to him
[1:03:45] and make him change his mind the fact
[1:03:48] that the bible said she told not her
[1:03:50] husband
[1:03:51] meant she didn't feel comfortable to go
[1:03:53] to him it meant
[1:03:54] that automatically she knew that if she
[1:03:56] did go to him the response she would get
[1:03:58] would not be this response
[1:04:03] so this is a woman who is willing to
[1:04:05] take a risk
[1:04:08] for a bigger purpose she's willing to
[1:04:11] take a risk
[1:04:13] for her household she's willing to
[1:04:16] understand the consequences of
[1:04:18] inaction because now that information
[1:04:22] was presented to her
[1:04:23] she had a choice and she had to make a
[1:04:26] decision out of
[1:04:27] limited options tell my husband wasting
[1:04:30] time
[1:04:33] option one dead do something about it
[1:04:37] that's our next option sit down and cry
[1:04:39] that's the next option
[1:04:40] lock myself in your room next option
[1:04:42] just take my horse and ride away into
[1:04:44] the sunset
[1:04:45] next option she had options
[1:04:48] she was in a this could almost be
[1:04:50] described as an abusive relationship
[1:04:52] this was her opportunity to get out
[1:04:56] if she had malicious nature in her heart
[1:05:00] the knowledge that david was coming to
[1:05:03] wipe out this man
[1:05:04] who was chillish who was harsh
[1:05:08] who was evil in his doings the
[1:05:10] opportunity had effectively presented
[1:05:12] herself
[1:05:13] for her to take her and her hand
[1:05:14] millions of people say let's just ride
[1:05:16] to that other mountain and spend the
[1:05:18] evening there and when david finished
[1:05:20] wipe out everybody we can go back
[1:05:23] but here it was in the face of it
[1:05:26] a woman of good understanding stands out
[1:05:28] making
[1:05:29] a great decision anybody with me
[1:05:34] but she told not her husband neighbor
[1:05:38] and it was so verse 20 as she rode on
[1:05:42] the ass that she came down by the covet
[1:05:44] of the hill and behold
[1:05:46] david and his men came down against her
[1:05:48] and she met them
[1:05:50] so i want us to understand the context
[1:05:54] in the ambiface it said it happened that
[1:05:57] as she is riding on a donkey
[1:05:59] and coming back by the way of the hidden
[1:06:01] part of the mountain
[1:06:02] that suddenly david and his men were
[1:06:04] coming down toward her and she met them
[1:06:06] so i want us to
[1:06:07] picture the drama that's unfolding
[1:06:10] here is this one woman riding a donkey
[1:06:14] and she meets david and 400 heavily
[1:06:18] armed very hungry angry men
[1:06:22] men who if david say kill will kill
[1:06:24] fight fight good
[1:06:25] them fellas just ready for anything
[1:06:30] you know in life it takes great skill to
[1:06:32] call it
[1:06:33] de-escalate situations
[1:06:37] as a father as a parent as a leader
[1:06:41] your choice of actions can either make
[1:06:43] things worse
[1:06:44] or make things better how could one
[1:06:48] woman face against our army
[1:06:52] you have to have wisdom to de-escalate
[1:06:55] you know there's some
[1:06:55] people who when they get angry you can't
[1:06:57] talk to them it takes
[1:07:00] you know people make horrible decisions
[1:07:03] out of anger
[1:07:05] what david was showing here is akin to
[1:07:07] almost having a temple
[1:07:08] he was out of control you know
[1:07:12] this what was being how can you kill a
[1:07:14] man because you ask him
[1:07:15] to bless you with whatever you want to
[1:07:16] and here bless you so you decide to kill
[1:07:18] him this is what david was on his way to
[1:07:20] do
[1:07:23] a lot of people don't know this
[1:07:24] existence so this is david not yet king
[1:07:26] yet no saul is still on the throne
[1:07:28] but david cannot be king unless this
[1:07:30] issue is dealt with
[1:07:33] and we will see how it calls out later
[1:07:36] on
[1:07:41] verse 20 again and it was so as you
[1:07:43] wrote on the eyes that she came down by
[1:07:44] the culvert of the hill and behold
[1:07:46] david and his men came down against her
[1:07:48] and she met them
[1:07:54] now david had said listen to david's
[1:07:56] thinking
[1:07:57] and i wanted to think because this
[1:07:59] applies to parents
[1:08:01] it applies to bosses it applies to
[1:08:03] relationships and i'm going to give the
[1:08:05] examples in a bit
[1:08:06] now david had said surely in vain have i
[1:08:09] kept all
[1:08:10] that this fellow had in the wilderness
[1:08:13] so that nothing was missed
[1:08:14] of all that pertain unto him and he had
[1:08:17] requited me evil for good
[1:08:19] in the amplified it says now david had
[1:08:21] said so this is david seeing in his
[1:08:23] heart in his mind
[1:08:24] this is what he's riding with this is
[1:08:26] what is riding him this is what affected
[1:08:27] him
[1:08:28] surely in vein i have protected and
[1:08:30] guarded all that this man has in the
[1:08:32] wilderness
[1:08:32] so that nothing was missing of all that
[1:08:35] belonged to him
[1:08:36] and he has repaid me evil for good it is
[1:08:39] as if you're saying i waste my time
[1:08:40] protecting him
[1:08:42] it's as if you're saying i waste my time
[1:08:44] sending my child to school
[1:08:47] it's as if you say i waste my time doing
[1:08:50] some activity that you
[1:08:52] felt or you had a desire to do and you
[1:08:54] ever get a return or the response from
[1:08:57] me that you wanted
[1:08:58] so david's anger is based on the fact
[1:09:01] that he feels he wasted his time
[1:09:03] protecting this man's assets and because
[1:09:06] he didn't behave the way david expected
[1:09:11] david is saying the response i expected
[1:09:16] is not what i'm getting that is
[1:09:19] in other words he had too much
[1:09:22] expectation
[1:09:24] of how neighbor was supposed to respond
[1:09:26] and our disappointments and frustrations
[1:09:29] in life
[1:09:30] are many times because we get
[1:09:32] disappointed by what other people do
[1:09:34] or don't do but i want us to appreciate
[1:09:36] the fact that david was missing
[1:09:38] the reality that nothing you do as a
[1:09:41] person
[1:09:42] can ever control what another person
[1:09:44] does
[1:09:46] it's either you're doing it from your
[1:09:47] heart or you're not doing it at all
[1:09:49] but you cannot sit down and say if i do
[1:09:52] something
[1:09:53] this is what i really expect in return
[1:09:55] and if the person doesn't do what you
[1:09:57] want to return you're ready to kill them
[1:10:00] that is not christ-like behavior
[1:10:04] yes david was a man after god's own
[1:10:06] heart but he had some issues
[1:10:08] that were being brought to before that
[1:10:10] god was about to deal with anybody with
[1:10:11] me
[1:10:13] how many times have we gotten angry with
[1:10:15] people
[1:10:16] because we felt we did something for
[1:10:19] them
[1:10:21] as a favor i wanted to catch it as a
[1:10:23] favor
[1:10:24] they didn't ask us to do it we do
[1:10:26] something for them as a favor
[1:10:28] and then we now upset
[1:10:32] that their return whatever we thought
[1:10:35] should be returned
[1:10:37] and in so doing we ready to ready 400
[1:10:40] men
[1:10:41] i want us to to check it and see it with
[1:10:43] the word now right
[1:10:44] good so now verse 21
[1:10:48] now david had said surely and vin have i
[1:10:50] kept all of this fellow hat in the
[1:10:52] wilderness
[1:10:52] sorry and vienna waste my time i should
[1:10:54] not do it i regret doing it i wouldn't
[1:10:56] do it again
[1:10:57] i thought i was doing something good i
[1:10:59] had good intentions i thought that if i
[1:11:01] do this the man would at least give a
[1:11:03] piece of bread a little piece of water
[1:11:04] something this is not right nobody
[1:11:06] respect my effort that has been doing
[1:11:08] all the thing and nobody's seen what
[1:11:09] they're doing
[1:11:10] because what david did was in secret
[1:11:14] it was not in public it was not neighbor
[1:11:17] didn't know what was going on
[1:11:19] check this i want us to catch this you
[1:11:21] have to know
[1:11:23] why you're doing what you're doing in
[1:11:24] secret and what you expect out of it
[1:11:28] you cannot get angry when you do
[1:11:30] something from your heart
[1:11:31] because it's either from your heart or
[1:11:33] not from your heart even from your heart
[1:11:34] you have to you're going all
[1:11:36] in anybody with me i want to reframe
[1:11:40] your thinking on these issues
[1:11:41] because they affect us i do this thing
[1:11:45] for
[1:11:45] f for my wife she didn't even know i do
[1:11:47] it i went to the backyard and i cut the
[1:11:49] grass i cut it thing it changed
[1:11:51] and however and i
[1:12:00] [Music]
[1:12:02] don't ask me to do that again this is
[1:12:04] this is i want to see the practical
[1:12:06] thing
[1:12:10] i remember you have young children young
[1:12:13] people
[1:12:14] you're you're you're supposed to do
[1:12:15] house shows i hope everybody have house
[1:12:17] shows
[1:12:18] i hope parents giving their young ones
[1:12:20] house shows
[1:12:21] you know things to do when you have your
[1:12:23] house chose to do
[1:12:25] your parents don't owe you compensation
[1:12:27] you know there's this this is back this
[1:12:29] is some serious entitlement issues you
[1:12:31] know
[1:12:32] i feel i waste my time i waste my time
[1:12:35] up in the house yes
[1:12:36] because i told when i mop it that i will
[1:12:38] get something i i waste my time
[1:12:40] cleaning my my father to me do so and so
[1:12:42] i do it um you know in fact i do a
[1:12:43] little extra and when i tell him i do
[1:12:45] extra he even do anything about it
[1:12:50] whatever it is all right so
[1:12:53] david had said surely in vienne have i
[1:12:54] kept all of this fellow hat in the
[1:12:56] wilderness so that nothing was missed
[1:12:58] of all that pertaining to him and he had
[1:13:00] requited me evil for good verse 22 we
[1:13:02] almost done
[1:13:03] so and more also do god
[1:13:07] unto the enemies of david
[1:13:10] if i leave all that potato here by
[1:13:12] morning light anywhere piss it against
[1:13:14] the wall
[1:13:15] so david say may god do so to the
[1:13:19] enemies of david and more also if by
[1:13:22] morning i'll leave alive
[1:13:23] any one male of who belonged to him so
[1:13:25] david said because
[1:13:27] i decided to protect this man
[1:13:30] and he didn't repeat his favor to me
[1:13:33] every living male are gone kill
[1:13:36] you see this level how your unrealized
[1:13:39] expectation can lead you to do something
[1:13:41] to get you into problems
[1:13:46] and when abigail saw david verse 23
[1:13:50] she hasted and lighted off the ass and
[1:13:52] fell before david on her face and bowed
[1:13:55] herself to the ground
[1:13:58] again i want this to notice the approach
[1:14:02] because she is about to de-escalate the
[1:14:04] situation
[1:14:06] remember the question here the teaching
[1:14:07] is are you a peace
[1:14:09] maker because if there ever was the need
[1:14:11] to make peace
[1:14:12] this was it david was on the verge of
[1:14:16] doing
[1:14:16] something that he would have to regret
[1:14:18] for the rest of his life
[1:14:20] god give us more peacemakers who can
[1:14:23] step in before we do things we regret
[1:14:25] for the rest of our lives but here it
[1:14:28] was
[1:14:29] one woman against 401 men
[1:14:32] about to do an irreparable damaging
[1:14:35] decision
[1:14:36] that could prevent david from us ever
[1:14:38] ascending to the throne and here it is
[1:14:40] she comes off
[1:14:41] sit goes down on her knees and bow down
[1:14:44] and fell at his feet verse 24 and said
[1:14:46] upon me
[1:14:48] my lord upon me let this iniquity be
[1:14:51] now now this is where this is what you
[1:14:54] call
[1:14:54] master craftsmen you know countries go
[1:14:58] to war for many things
[1:15:01] the office there are certain offices uh
[1:15:04] uh ministers of of of of trade
[1:15:07] and and ambassadors and international
[1:15:10] relations
[1:15:11] and the secretary of state of the us and
[1:15:13] these kind of roles are supposed to help
[1:15:15] bridge
[1:15:16] issues of relationship between countries
[1:15:18] and and armies and these things
[1:15:20] here it is this woman had nothing to do
[1:15:25] with the current situation
[1:15:29] she did not speak to david's men
[1:15:33] she didn't say don't give them no food
[1:15:35] she was out of the conversation at the
[1:15:37] very beginning
[1:15:38] but look at her approach to
[1:15:40] de-escalating the situation
[1:15:42] she said upon me oh lord in other words
[1:15:45] it's my fault let this inequity be
[1:15:49] that's powerful the effect of this and
[1:15:52] david how
[1:15:52] david automatically had to reframe his
[1:15:55] thinking
[1:15:56] she says upon me my lord upon me
[1:15:59] let us iniquity be and let thine
[1:16:02] handmaid i pray thee speak in that
[1:16:04] audience
[1:16:05] and hear the words of the anime she said
[1:16:08] it's my fault it's my fault
[1:16:10] i am to blame hear me out hear me out
[1:16:14] what's the work of a master peacemaker
[1:16:16] too many of us like the arguments you
[1:16:18] know
[1:16:19] she has say you're wrong you're wrong
[1:16:21] you're wrong you're crazy
[1:16:23] you say listen i am to blame i'm to
[1:16:24] blame i'm to blame give me a little word
[1:16:27] let's hear me out
[1:16:31] listen to verse 25. let not my lord
[1:16:35] i pray thee regard this man of belial
[1:16:44] in the amplified they said please do not
[1:16:46] my lord pay attention
[1:16:48] to this worthless man neighbor
[1:16:51] [Music]
[1:16:53] for as his name is so is he you remember
[1:16:56] i made a statement that the fact that
[1:16:58] his name was called is relevant
[1:16:59] to what is happening here and we see now
[1:17:02] why is relevant because
[1:17:03] she is using his name as part of the
[1:17:05] peacemaking
[1:17:06] she said as his name is so is he nabal
[1:17:10] is his name and folly is with him
[1:17:14] so this man is admitting that she have a
[1:17:17] husband who
[1:17:21] i can't finish it she has a husband
[1:17:23] who's a fool
[1:17:26] except that he don't know he's a fool
[1:17:31] let not my lord i pray the regard this
[1:17:33] man of belial
[1:17:34] even nabel for as his name is so is he
[1:17:37] nabal is his name and folly is with him
[1:17:41] but i then hand me it so not the young
[1:17:44] men of my lord whom thou did ascend
[1:17:46] so you say the man who spoke to them is
[1:17:49] a fool
[1:17:50] i didn't encounter your men
[1:17:53] so let us reframe what we're about to do
[1:17:57] now therefore my lord as the lord live
[1:18:00] it
[1:18:01] and as i so live it seeing the lord
[1:18:04] had withholding thee from coming to shed
[1:18:07] blood
[1:18:11] and from avenging thyself with thine own
[1:18:13] hand
[1:18:14] now let thine enemies and they that seek
[1:18:17] evil
[1:18:18] to my lord be as neighbor so i want to
[1:18:20] read it again in the amplified
[1:18:23] so now my lord as the lord lives and as
[1:18:25] your soul lives
[1:18:26] since the lord has prevented you she is
[1:18:30] speaking in the past and she is
[1:18:32] appealing to to david on the next level
[1:18:34] the law has prevented you past tense
[1:18:37] so she is speaking to him as if he
[1:18:39] already changed his mind
[1:18:40] i want to see the level of craftsmanship
[1:18:42] going on here
[1:18:44] since the lord she is also not taking
[1:18:46] credit herself for what's happening
[1:18:48] right now
[1:18:49] she this one woman of good understanding
[1:18:52] and beauty
[1:18:53] is ministering onto a future king
[1:18:56] she is coaching a future king she is
[1:18:58] mentoring a future king
[1:19:00] she is guiding a future king and she has
[1:19:02] not even taken credit for it
[1:19:04] she said since the lord has prevented
[1:19:07] you from shedding blood
[1:19:09] and from avenging yourself by your own
[1:19:11] hand
[1:19:13] now then let your enemies and those who
[1:19:15] seek to do evil to my lord
[1:19:17] be as self-destructive as neighbor
[1:19:20] so she's saying this man is imploding
[1:19:22] himself
[1:19:26] verse 27 we're almost done and now this
[1:19:29] blessing which thine handmaid
[1:19:32] had brought unto my lord let it even be
[1:19:35] given
[1:19:35] unto the young men that follow my lord
[1:19:38] so you're saying
[1:19:39] i bring the gift all the food you're
[1:19:40] looking for i pray thee
[1:19:43] forgive the trespass of dying handmade
[1:19:46] you see she tried to defend neighbor
[1:19:50] she said the man is a foolish man you
[1:19:52] make a foolish decision
[1:19:54] i am here pleading face case what i find
[1:19:56] is so powerful is that she know she's
[1:19:58] living with her
[1:19:59] worthless money amplified that she said
[1:20:00] worthless man
[1:20:03] and she didn't even say david david
[1:20:05] watch now i don't mind nick illumina
[1:20:09] i really am mine you know because i fed
[1:20:10] up i fed up you're already talking to
[1:20:12] him
[1:20:12] you know i telling him to change who is
[1:20:14] and he has listened to me i try i try
[1:20:16] god knows that's right
[1:20:19] this is a wife in action
[1:20:22] dunk to the end she's still defending us
[1:20:25] but although he's a fool
[1:20:30] i pray verse 28 forgive the trespass of
[1:20:34] thy handmaid
[1:20:35] for the lord will certainly make my lord
[1:20:38] a short house
[1:20:39] so she actually beginning to prophesy
[1:20:43] about david now
[1:20:45] so she is now switching gears from
[1:20:47] pleading and repositioning his thinking
[1:20:50] to now speaking into his life all right
[1:20:53] i pray he forgive the trespasser then
[1:20:55] handmade so in other words
[1:20:57] forgive the transgression now she do
[1:20:59] anything wrong but she's saying forgive
[1:21:01] me and she's about to say certain things
[1:21:03] for the lord will certainly make my lord
[1:21:05] a short house
[1:21:06] because my lord fighted the battles of
[1:21:09] the lord
[1:21:10] and evil had not been found in all the
[1:21:14] ideas
[1:21:15] so she's beginning to plead and prophesy
[1:21:17] in a whole next level in other words
[1:21:19] up to this point in time evil has not
[1:21:22] been found in lee
[1:21:24] that is real there so she is checking
[1:21:27] david and his decision-making and his
[1:21:29] current action
[1:21:30] with up to this point you haven't done
[1:21:32] anything that will ruin your testimony
[1:21:36] anybody with me
[1:21:40] yet a man has risen to pursue thee
[1:21:43] so they all know what's going conquest
[1:21:48] yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to
[1:21:52] seek thy soul
[1:21:53] but the soul of my lord shall be born
[1:22:06] and the situation this is the this is
[1:22:08] the climax of what he has been going
[1:22:10] through
[1:22:11] all the time is that he last straw
[1:22:14] so she is not just and it shows great
[1:22:16] wisdom she's not addressing just the
[1:22:18] issue with neighbor now
[1:22:19] she's going to the root cause of the
[1:22:21] problem
[1:22:23] is saying yet a man is risen to pursue
[1:22:25] thee speaking about saul
[1:22:28] and to seek thy soul but the soul of my
[1:22:31] lord shall be bound
[1:22:32] in the bundle of life with the lord thy
[1:22:34] god in other words
[1:22:36] this woman of good understanding had a
[1:22:39] good
[1:22:39] understanding of exactly what was
[1:22:41] bothering david
[1:22:43] david was angry he was upset he didn't
[1:22:46] have a place to put his head at night
[1:22:48] because he had to be on his move all
[1:22:49] along he said by doing a good effort he
[1:22:52] was going to get a little food to eat we
[1:22:54] don't know when last he ate we didn't
[1:22:55] even last he slept well he had to keep
[1:22:57] moving because saul was hunting him and
[1:22:59] he felt if he could just sit down and
[1:23:01] rest
[1:23:01] and eat and take a pause and refresh he
[1:23:04] can fight another day
[1:23:05] and here it was after doing a good deed
[1:23:07] this
[1:23:08] insolent rich man who had the means to
[1:23:11] help him
[1:23:12] refuse to do it how could he do that
[1:23:16] and here is abigail the great peacemaker
[1:23:20] is first apologizing first thing
[1:23:23] is a fool you're dealing with first
[1:23:25] thing i bring food for you
[1:23:27] first saying i'm bring food for your men
[1:23:29] but
[1:23:30] now she goes to the root cause of the
[1:23:31] issue david i'm nowhere really going
[1:23:34] on i know the anger you have
[1:23:37] is not really at neighborhood verse 29
[1:23:40] again
[1:23:40] placing it in context yet a man is risen
[1:23:43] to pursue thee
[1:23:44] after she said no evil has been found in
[1:23:47] thee you have had a testimony
[1:23:49] we heard the testimony we hear about
[1:23:51] goliath we heard of the victories
[1:23:53] your testimony has raised the whole land
[1:23:55] your whole land knows who you are
[1:23:56] david what are you doing what are you
[1:23:58] doing now why are you doing this
[1:24:00] yet a man has risen to pursue thee and
[1:24:03] to seek
[1:24:04] thy soul but the soul of my lord look
[1:24:06] she's given him comfort
[1:24:07] shall be bound in the bundle of life
[1:24:10] with the lord thy god
[1:24:11] in other words god will protect your
[1:24:14] soul
[1:24:15] and they sold of thy enemies and them
[1:24:17] shall he sling out
[1:24:18] as out of the middle of a sling and
[1:24:21] she's relating to david in a language he
[1:24:24] can understand because
[1:24:25] we know about david and his sling talk
[1:24:27] about the woman of good understanding
[1:24:28] she is ministering with complete
[1:24:31] knowledge
[1:24:32] of david's position his condition his
[1:24:34] understanding
[1:24:35] the fact he was a shepherd in fact he
[1:24:37] would know she's using an analogy he can
[1:24:39] relate to
[1:24:40] i want us to catch the depth of
[1:24:42] understanding upon ministering to him
[1:24:45] she is using this sling as an analogy
[1:24:47] because she knew
[1:24:48] david knows what a sling is and how it
[1:24:50] could be used he says
[1:24:52] them shall he sling out us out of the
[1:24:54] middle of a sling
[1:24:56] anybody with me verse 13
[1:24:59] and it shall come to pass when the lord
[1:25:02] shall have done to my lord
[1:25:04] according to all the good that he had
[1:25:06] spoken concerning v
[1:25:08] so she is now tapping into what the lord
[1:25:10] has spoken considering him
[1:25:11] which would have come to the prophet
[1:25:12] samuel and shall have appointed the
[1:25:15] ruler over israel so she is already
[1:25:18] speaking
[1:25:19] she already saying you will be ruler
[1:25:21] when it shall come to pass
[1:25:23] when the lord shall have done so she is
[1:25:26] already speaking now in the
[1:25:28] i don't even know what tensei has called
[1:25:29] let's know the english experts could
[1:25:31] guide me when the lord shall have done
[1:25:33] to my lord she was he speaking future
[1:25:35] past tense i don't know but when the
[1:25:38] lord would have done all he said
[1:25:40] concerning you
[1:25:41] all the good he had spoken concerning
[1:25:43] thee and shall have appointed the
[1:25:45] ruler over israel listen now
[1:25:48] that this here right now this moment
[1:25:52] shall be no grief unto thee that is
[1:25:55] powerful
[1:25:56] she is saying here now listen carefully
[1:25:59] that this incident
[1:26:01] will not cause grief or bring a troubled
[1:26:03] conscience to my lord
[1:26:05] in other words if you move the wrong way
[1:26:08] right now
[1:26:09] this will forever be appearing upon you
[1:26:12] it will be a negative
[1:26:13] statement against your ministry against
[1:26:15] your testimony you haven't messed up
[1:26:17] before
[1:26:18] but if you do this act right now all
[1:26:20] that god
[1:26:21] will have promised to you will still
[1:26:23] come to pass you know but this will ruin
[1:26:25] your testimony
[1:26:28] so in that short message she gave to
[1:26:31] david
[1:26:32] she de-escalated the situation she
[1:26:35] brought context
[1:26:36] she brought what he wanted she snapped
[1:26:38] him back to reality she
[1:26:40] identified he would cause the problem
[1:26:42] and she now address the future
[1:26:44] and the wisdom of don't let this
[1:26:47] experience taint
[1:26:48] your testimony that this shall be no
[1:26:51] grief unto thee
[1:26:52] or pain unto thee no offense of heart
[1:26:56] unto my lord
[1:26:56] that's conscious that you will be
[1:26:58] sitting on the throne regretting that
[1:27:00] you made this move this decision
[1:27:01] that is not well thought out either that
[1:27:04] doll has shed blood cause less
[1:27:06] in other words she's saying if you act
[1:27:08] now there's no cause
[1:27:10] there's no reason for you to act this
[1:27:11] way how many times have we acted when
[1:27:14] there's no cause there's no reason to do
[1:27:16] so so she's telling david stop think
[1:27:18] think think
[1:27:19] think before you act any further before
[1:27:22] you do anything else think
[1:27:24] because you have a future you have a
[1:27:26] destiny you have a purpose there's a
[1:27:28] prophecy over your life
[1:27:30] and you have a point you have a chance
[1:27:32] now to make a decision
[1:27:36] and how you decide will determine the
[1:27:38] kind of testimony it'll determine your
[1:27:40] resume
[1:27:41] you don't want to regret doing the wrong
[1:27:43] thing anybody with me
[1:27:46] or that my lord had avenged himself
[1:27:49] but when the lord shall have dealt well
[1:27:51] with my lord
[1:27:52] then remember thine handmade so she also
[1:27:56] now say after all of that
[1:27:58] when the lord so she already speaking
[1:28:00] knowing that her
[1:28:01] argument is so convincing to david
[1:28:04] that when you reach your position don't
[1:28:07] forget me
[1:28:08] because my intervention here is helping
[1:28:11] guide you to kingship anybody with me
[1:28:15] could we could we just bring it to a
[1:28:17] close a little for a few more
[1:28:18] minutes would would that be fine
[1:28:21] verse 32 and david said to abigail
[1:28:26] blessed be the lord god of israel which
[1:28:29] sent
[1:28:29] me this day to meet me hallelujah
[1:28:34] look at her look look at a king being
[1:28:37] shaped owned
[1:28:38] a king who could who could listen to a
[1:28:41] good argument
[1:28:43] and say this thing making sense and say
[1:28:46] blessed be the lord god of israel
[1:28:50] would send thee this data meet me
[1:28:53] he recognized that this simple woman
[1:28:57] was sent by the lord to stop him in his
[1:28:59] tracks from doing something he should
[1:29:01] not do
[1:29:02] and listen to verse 33 and bless me thy
[1:29:05] advice
[1:29:06] and bless be thou which has kept me this
[1:29:09] day
[1:29:10] from coming to shed blood and from
[1:29:12] avenging myself with my own hand
[1:29:16] verse 34 for in very deed
[1:29:19] as the lord god of israel lived which
[1:29:21] had kept me
[1:29:22] back from hurting thee except thou had
[1:29:25] hastened and come to meet me
[1:29:27] surely they have not been left unto
[1:29:29] neighbor by the morning light any that
[1:29:31] pisseth against the wall
[1:29:33] so david is saying here in verse 34
[1:29:36] nevertheless as the lord of god of
[1:29:37] israel lives in the amplified who has
[1:29:39] prevented me from harming you
[1:29:41] if you have not come quickly to meet me
[1:29:44] most certainly by the morning light
[1:29:46] they will not have been left to neighbor
[1:29:48] so much as one meal
[1:29:50] so david said if she didn't come quickly
[1:29:52] by morning every man in that camden
[1:29:55] so i want us to also understand that
[1:29:58] when
[1:29:59] jesus speaks that blessed be the
[1:30:00] peacemakers listen
[1:30:02] making peace needs to be a very quick
[1:30:04] thing you know
[1:30:07] david is saying if you come if you try
[1:30:10] to make peace tomorrow all night already
[1:30:11] i don't know
[1:30:14] making peace could actually be too late
[1:30:16] to know
[1:30:19] let me ask you the ministering question
[1:30:20] is there something you need to make
[1:30:22] peace about
[1:30:24] is there some pending war
[1:30:27] brewing beneath the surface some action
[1:30:31] taken or not taken that you need to
[1:30:32] address don't lie
[1:30:35] don't go to go for days you don't know
[1:30:36] who will be there here david said if you
[1:30:38] didn't come and arrest me right now
[1:30:40] i don't even know where where i would be
[1:30:42] all right
[1:30:45] so david verse 35 so david received of
[1:30:48] her hand
[1:30:49] that which she had brought him and said
[1:30:52] unto her
[1:30:52] go up in peace to thine house see
[1:30:56] i have hearkened to thy voice and have
[1:30:58] accepted thy person
[1:31:00] what a powerful testimony and it speaks
[1:31:03] to
[1:31:03] the character of a man that he can
[1:31:07] recognize i was making a bad decision
[1:31:11] there are some people who are wrong and
[1:31:14] strong
[1:31:17] they're wrong about to make a wrong
[1:31:18] decision and people give them good
[1:31:20] advice
[1:31:22] and they know it's good advice you know
[1:31:24] but they don't want to
[1:31:25] appear changing their mind imagine if
[1:31:27] david had an ego
[1:31:29] as you say imagine if david was a
[1:31:31] trinidadian said i don't reach out here
[1:31:33] ready i
[1:31:34] i'm going to buy it how are we going to
[1:31:35] them back they think are weak
[1:31:38] what were they thinking let me see
[1:31:39] arrive at him yes
[1:31:42] what david was willing to say
[1:31:45] go up in peace i've heard unto thy voice
[1:31:47] and i've accepted thy person
[1:31:49] accepted that person in the amplified
[1:31:51] means granted your request
[1:31:56] we're almost done verse 36 and abigail
[1:31:59] came to neighbor so she going back now
[1:32:02] and behold he held a feast in his house
[1:32:05] like the feast of a king no no neighbor
[1:32:08] is clueless
[1:32:09] of this whole interchange naval is so
[1:32:12] out of sync with reality
[1:32:14] he doesn't even know death was just
[1:32:15] knocking on his door
[1:32:18] neighbor doesn't understand that his
[1:32:20] wife who
[1:32:22] clearly doesn't have the best
[1:32:23] relationship with him
[1:32:25] clearly loves him enough to still save
[1:32:27] his life and the life of the host
[1:32:29] and the bible says and ever abigail came
[1:32:31] back to neighbor
[1:32:32] and behold he held a feast in his nose
[1:32:34] like the feast of a king
[1:32:36] and neighbor's heart was merry within
[1:32:38] him for he was very drunken
[1:32:40] wherefore she told him nothing less or
[1:32:42] more until the morning light
[1:32:44] when it but it came to pass in the
[1:32:46] morning when the wine was going out of
[1:32:48] naval
[1:32:50] and his wife had told him these things
[1:32:52] that his heart
[1:32:54] died within him
[1:32:59] and he became as a stone
[1:33:05] so i am not sure
[1:33:08] the bible doesn't tell us what
[1:33:11] exactly bothered him about what was said
[1:33:15] was it he was angry that she went and
[1:33:18] did what he didn't want to do
[1:33:20] was he shocked at the fact that death
[1:33:23] was knocking on his door
[1:33:24] and he could have died we have no
[1:33:26] information
[1:33:27] but the reality is it affected him so
[1:33:30] much
[1:33:31] that his heart died within him
[1:33:34] and he became a stone i think that would
[1:33:37] be a kinder almost like a stroke because
[1:33:39] he wasn't dead
[1:33:41] yet he was just paralyzed
[1:33:45] in the amplified it says he be in
[1:33:47] paralyzed and helpless like a stone
[1:33:49] that is the amplified so when he just
[1:33:52] shot
[1:33:53] on and he became a sword in verse 38
[1:33:57] and it came to pass after ten days that
[1:33:59] the lord
[1:34:00] smote nabel so now this is now
[1:34:04] this is not here here f in a diagonal he
[1:34:06] is parallel and the lord's smooth
[1:34:07] smote is very very specific
[1:34:11] struck smooth wipe out then he died so
[1:34:13] the lord stepped in
[1:34:15] because neighbor had crossed the man
[1:34:18] after god's own heart
[1:34:21] so the lord took action there verse 39
[1:34:24] and when david heard that neighbor was
[1:34:26] dead he said
[1:34:27] blessed be the lord that had pleaded the
[1:34:30] cause
[1:34:31] of my reproach from the hand of naval
[1:34:34] and had kept his servant from evil
[1:34:37] for the lord had returned the wickedness
[1:34:40] of naval upon his own head
[1:34:43] and david sent and communed with abigail
[1:34:46] to take her to him to wife
[1:34:49] and when the servants of david would
[1:34:52] come to abigail to camel
[1:34:53] they spake on us saying david sent us
[1:34:55] unto thee
[1:34:57] to take thee to him to wife and she
[1:34:59] arose
[1:35:00] and bowed herself on her face to the
[1:35:02] youth and said behold
[1:35:04] let the handmaid be a servant to wash
[1:35:07] the feet
[1:35:08] of the servants of my lord
[1:35:11] and lord a blessing to the reading of
[1:35:13] his word
[1:35:14] so a diplomat became
[1:35:17] david's wife a peacemaker became
[1:35:20] david's wife a woman of good
[1:35:23] understanding
[1:35:24] and duty became david's wife she
[1:35:26] effectively
[1:35:28] had had distinguished herself to be a
[1:35:30] woman who was deserving of the spiritual
[1:35:33] discerning of the natural discerning on
[1:35:36] on on when to be discreet
[1:35:37] and when to move with haste of what to
[1:35:40] put as the provisions
[1:35:42] of how to confront a king in the making
[1:35:45] how to deal with the army on the move
[1:35:47] all of this was displayed in this woman
[1:35:48] called abigail
[1:35:50] key lessons to learn tonight peacemaking
[1:35:54] blessed are the peacemakers there are
[1:35:57] many times we'll find situations
[1:35:59] where conflict is rampant be it in our
[1:36:01] homes in our families any workplace in
[1:36:03] business
[1:36:04] whatever it is it takes great skill
[1:36:07] to be a peacemaker it takes great
[1:36:09] understanding
[1:36:10] to be a peacemaker it takes a good
[1:36:13] understanding
[1:36:14] of coming to the root cause of a
[1:36:16] situation to bring peace
[1:36:18] but on the flip side we see conflict and
[1:36:22] a situation
[1:36:23] he could have derailed david's life
[1:36:24] forever if abigail had not intervened
[1:36:28] the story of david would be very
[1:36:29] different and we see it in both
[1:36:32] abigail's narrative
[1:36:33] and david's acknowledgement that it was
[1:36:36] the lord had intervened
[1:36:37] to prevent david from doing something
[1:36:39] that he would regret forever
[1:36:41] i challenge you tonight on both sides of
[1:36:44] this spectrum
[1:36:45] to become a peacemaker because blessed
[1:36:48] are the peacemakers
[1:36:50] are you a peacemaker so i challenge you
[1:36:52] to become
[1:36:53] a better peacemaker but i also challenge
[1:36:55] you
[1:36:56] to take the words of abigail and apply
[1:37:00] it to your life
[1:37:01] understanding that like david you two
[1:37:04] have a purpose
[1:37:05] you two have a destiny you too have a
[1:37:08] place to rule because you are priests
[1:37:09] and kings
[1:37:10] so as a king that has a destiny as a
[1:37:13] priest that has a purpose
[1:37:15] there are some things you cannot do
[1:37:17] there are some actions you cannot take
[1:37:18] there are some activities you cannot do
[1:37:20] and there are some levels of avenging
[1:37:23] that you cannot indulge in because it
[1:37:25] will forever taint
[1:37:26] your testimony guard your testimony
[1:37:29] guard your future protect your life and
[1:37:32] use this scripture as an inspiration to
[1:37:35] you as a reminder
[1:37:36] of what could have gone wrong what may
[1:37:39] have been different
[1:37:41] and above all else if peace has to be
[1:37:44] made
[1:37:44] make it quickly make it history don't
[1:37:48] let your act meet the next day don't let
[1:37:51] issues just hang any balance don't let
[1:37:53] issues that could escalate
[1:37:55] just keep escalating we have to learn to
[1:37:57] de-escalate we have to learn to make
[1:37:59] peace
[1:37:59] we have to learn to live like christ and
[1:38:02] lastly
[1:38:03] we have to recognize how god could send
[1:38:06] people
[1:38:07] in our lives even tonight this is an
[1:38:10] invent intervention for somebody
[1:38:12] who needed to be stopped in their tracks
[1:38:14] because you might be taking an action or
[1:38:16] contemplating an action
[1:38:18] that when you reflect on this and gave
[1:38:21] his own
[1:38:21] entitlement when he said in vain i did
[1:38:25] what i did
[1:38:25] in other words i wasted my time and many
[1:38:28] times we feel as if we wasted our time
[1:38:30] many times we feel we may have done more
[1:38:32] than people expected
[1:38:34] we may have done more than we thought we
[1:38:35] should have done and there's this
[1:38:37] expectation at least of gratitude
[1:38:40] what david was looking for was simply
[1:38:41] gratitude he didn't put a price on what
[1:38:43] he wanted from
[1:38:44] neighbor he didn't say neighbor i want x
[1:38:47] y and z
[1:38:48] he said as it is in your heart whatever
[1:38:50] you want to bless us with
[1:38:51] and he was shocked that neighbor didn't
[1:38:53] even do anything at all
[1:38:55] i want us to realize friends that you
[1:38:58] cannot control
[1:38:59] what other people do for a brief moment
[1:39:03] david missed that fact that he had no
[1:39:06] control over naval
[1:39:08] and abigail was able to help david to
[1:39:11] recalibrate to realize
[1:39:13] he could have only controlled himself
[1:39:15] and in that moment of contemplation
[1:39:18] and reflection he was able to
[1:39:19] recalibrate and say wait a minute
[1:39:21] thank god you spoke to me because i was
[1:39:24] acting out of my feelings
[1:39:26] i wasn't spirit-led i sought no advice i
[1:39:29] was in my emotion
[1:39:30] i responded based on how i was feeling
[1:39:32] and quite honestly as i began writing
[1:39:34] this end
[1:39:35] i've been dealing with so many issues
[1:39:38] in my life that this was like the last
[1:39:40] straw
[1:39:41] solved been after me are frustrated and
[1:39:44] this was the narrative
[1:39:45] and sometimes in life we have so much
[1:39:48] going on
[1:39:49] that we confront this last straw
[1:39:52] that affects us so much it may push us
[1:39:55] to the edge of doing something that we
[1:39:56] will regret
[1:39:58] let us take a deep breath let us reflect
[1:40:00] on this tonight and this lesson
[1:40:02] laying in full samuel 25 and let it be
[1:40:05] an encouragement and an inspiration to
[1:40:07] us
[1:40:07] shall we pray our guest is heavenly
[1:40:09] father a
[1:40:10] simple teaching tonight lord of so much
[1:40:14] that could be said
[1:40:15] so much that has not been said but i
[1:40:17] pray tonight lord that
[1:40:19] lord i was able to lord express it the
[1:40:21] way that you wanted me to to help
[1:40:23] somebody i don't know who tonight
[1:40:25] lord but life is about decisions nabel
[1:40:28] made a choice
[1:40:30] and david would say the lord returned
[1:40:32] evil
[1:40:33] his evil upon his head his decision
[1:40:36] returned upon him and our decisions come
[1:40:39] back upon us
[1:40:40] we could choose to bless or we could
