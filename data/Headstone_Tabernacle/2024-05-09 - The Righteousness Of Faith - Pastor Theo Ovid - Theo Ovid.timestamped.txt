[40:57] come to know in your Saving Grace and
[40:59] knowledge father may this prayer request
[41:01] become a not of Praise in Jesus name I
[41:04] ask it we thank you Lord we thank you
[41:06] Lord and father as we approach your word
[41:09] tonight I pray that you would come and
[41:10] breathe Upon Us Lord bring the breath of
[41:13] life and may divine revelation bring
[41:15] forth upon your people tonight and will
[41:17] you confirm your word with signs wonders
[41:18] and miracles we ask in Jesus name amen
[41:22] and amen God bless you uh tonight we
[41:25] want to turn to two portion of scripture
[41:27] Romans
[41:28] 4 uh what I think I'll do I'll read a
[41:31] second scripture first Romans
[41:33] 1 uh verse 16 and 17 and I'll let you
[41:35] have your seats and we're going to go to
[41:36] Romans
[41:38] 4 Romans 1 verse 16 and
[41:41] 17 and it reason this wise Paul speaks
[41:46] for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of
[41:48] Christ for it is the power of God unto
[41:52] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[41:55] the Jew first and also to the the Greek
[41:58] for therein is the righteousness of God
[42:00] revealed from Faith to Faith as it is
[42:03] written the J shall live by faith you
[42:05] may be seated or praise God may God
[42:07] bless his word and we want to turn to
[42:09] Romans chapter 4 we want to go through
[42:12] that that chapter Romans chapter
[42:15] 4 what shall we say then that Abraham
[42:18] our father as per to the flesh had found
[42:21] for If Abraham were justified by works
[42:24] he had where of the glory but not before
[42:26] God but what sayth the scripture Abraham
[42:29] believed God and it was counted unto him
[42:32] for righteousness now to him that
[42:34] worketh is the reward not reckon of
[42:36] Grace but of debt but to him that
[42:38] worketh not but believeth on him that
[42:42] justify the
[42:44] ungodly his fate is counted for
[42:49] righteousness even as David describeth
[42:51] the blessedness of the man unto whom God
[42:54] imputed righteousness without works
[42:57] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[43:00] are forgiven and whose sins are covered
[43:04] blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
[43:06] not impute sin come this blessedness of
[43:08] them on the circumcision only or upon
[43:11] the uncircumcision also for we say that
[43:15] Faith here we go was reckoned to Abraham
[43:17] for
[43:18] righteousness how was it then reckoned
[43:21] when he was in circumcision or in
[43:24] uncircumcision not in circumcision but
[43:27] but in
[43:28] uncircumcision and he received a sign of
[43:30] circumcision a seal of the righteousness
[43:33] of the Fate which he had yet being
[43:37] uncircumcised that he might be the
[43:39] father of all them that believe though
[43:42] they be not
[43:44] circumcised that righteousness might be
[43:48] imputed unto them also and the father of
[43:51] circumcision to them who are not of the
[43:53] circumcision only but also who walk in
[43:56] the steps of that fate of our Father
[43:59] Abraham which he had being yet
[44:01] uncircumcised for the promise verse 13
[44:04] that he should be the heir of the world
[44:06] was not that Abraham ought to recede
[44:09] through the law but through the
[44:12] righteousness of faith for if they which
[44:15] are of the law be ears faith is made
[44:17] void and the promise made of none effect
[44:20] because the law worketh rra for there
[44:22] where there's no law is there is no
[44:25] transgression therefore here we go it is
[44:28] of shout out it is of faith that it
[44:31] might be by grace to the end the promise
[44:35] might be sure sure to all the seed not
[44:39] to that only which is of the law but to
[44:42] also which is of the faith of Abraham
[44:44] who is the father of us all as it is
[44:47] written I have made thee a father of
[44:49] many nations before him whom he believe
[44:51] even God who quickeneth the dead and
[44:54] calth those things which be not as
[44:56] though they were were who against hope
[44:58] believe in hope that he might become the
[45:00] father of many nations according to that
[45:02] which was spoken soal Li he be and being
[45:05] not weak in fate he considered not his
[45:09] own body now dead when he was about a
[45:11] 100 years old yet the yet the deadness
[45:13] of s's wom he staggered not at the
[45:16] promise of God through unbelief but was
[45:19] strong in giving glory to God so your
[45:23] faith shows by your giving glory to God
[45:26] and verse for anyone being fully
[45:28] persuaded that what he had promised he
[45:31] was able to perform and tonight we have
[45:34] to be fully persuaded that what this God
[45:37] promised to this last day Prophet
[45:39] messenger he is able to perform and
[45:42] therefore it was imputed to him for
[45:44] righteousness and it was not written for
[45:47] his sake alone and it was imputed to him
[45:49] but for us also here we go to whom it
[45:52] shall be imputed oh gor if we believe on
[45:55] him that raised up Jesus Christ from the
[45:58] dead who was delivered for our offenses
[46:01] and was raised up for our justification
[46:03] and this is the time to give God some
[46:05] Praises right now oh glory to God
[46:09] hallelujah hallelujah praise be to Jesus
[46:12] we love him tonight we thank God tonight
[46:14] so the title of the message tonight is
[46:16] the righteousness of
[46:19] Faith the righteousness of faith and of
[46:22] a subject the righteousness of God is
[46:24] revealed from fi to Faith
[46:27] all right let's go now Paul sorry didn't
[46:30] send the whole Cy but shame put some of
[46:32] the scriptures up but suffer to be
[46:35] so Paul in Galatians chapter 3 was
[46:38] rebuking the
[46:39] Galatians he was talking about you
[46:41] foolish Galatians having begun in the
[46:44] spirit are you now made perfect by the
[46:47] flesh have you suffered many things in
[46:49] vain and then he said he therefore that
[46:52] minister to you the spirit and worketh
[46:54] miracles among you doeth he by The Works
[46:56] of the Lord or by the hearing of Faith
[46:59] even as Abraham believed God and it was
[47:02] counted for him for righteousness now
[47:04] the church didn't start this way the
[47:06] church end up in this mode that Paul had
[47:09] us to rebuke them from going into a
[47:12] level of legalism and law and not
[47:14] staying in that level of Faith so he
[47:17] said even as Abraham believed God and it
[47:19] was accounted to him for righteousness
[47:22] know ye therefore that they which are of
[47:24] Faith the same as the children of
[47:25] Abraham amen
[47:27] so Paul was rebuking them but I want to
[47:31] get this here in the Amplified and the
[47:34] proph and and this is verse three here

[53:00] of God came to present themselves before
[53:01] the Lord Satan came among them and the
[53:03] Lord said un Satan hey whence thou
[53:05] comest
[53:06] down then San answered to the Lord and
[53:09] said from going to and fr in the Earth
[53:10] from walking up and down in it but this
[53:13] is what he actually does the Lord said
[53:16] unto Satan has thou considered my

[53:57] Tire hitting the road the devil letting
[53:59] God know the only reason job is acting

[54:05] you increase him you anoint him just
[54:07] take W from him you will curse it to
[54:10] your
[54:11] face and the Lord said unto Satan Lord
[54:15] behold all that he had is in thy power
[54:20] only upon himself but not forth thine
[54:23] hand so job so Satan went forth from the
[54:26] presence of the Lord Brother
[54:30] BR and he's talking about job let's take
[54:33] that old man name of job now there's a
[54:37] reason why I'm reading this I want you
[54:39] to get a picture here there's nobody
[54:40] like him in the day there was a prophet
[54:42] people come from Far near to hear job
[54:45] God blessed him he prospered he was a
[54:47] rich man he had thousands of cattle and
[54:49] sheep and and whatnot he would go in the
[54:52] streets young princess from the East
[54:53] that's the mag the wise astronomer they
[54:56] were saying and I would bow before him
[54:58] just to ask a word of his wisdom he was
[55:00] a smart man he was a prophet so the
[55:03] devil looked down he saw what job a
[55:04] smart man I'll show you how smart man
[55:06] does now coming back to the text praise
[55:09] God he said you know my children is
[55:10] married going off and per Adventure one
[55:13] of them might Sinn here we go now there
[55:17] is one requirement God had that's a
[55:19] burnt offering he said now he didn't
[55:21] believe his children sin
[55:24] but per Adventure
[55:26] they might sin because they're visiting
[55:29] one another they're going to parties one
[55:30] other homes and so forth if one of them
[55:32] sin so Lord I will bring a burnt
[55:35] offering and offer this burnt offering
[55:37] for my child and that's all he know to
[55:39] do because that's all god require a
[55:42] burnt offering that's all we require so
[55:44] then the great Midnight Hour come and
[55:46] struck Paul job was in a condition he
[55:48] lost his cattle his sheep storms killed
[55:50] his children burnt his servants his own
[55:53] heal fail in the backyard Ash sheep Boke
[55:56] he broke down with boils and scraping
[55:58] his boils and then his Consolers turned
[56:01] their back on him and they told him he
[56:05] sinned now this is this is an important
[56:07] service
[56:08] tonight it may sound flat but it's more
[56:11] than you
[56:15] think the church member the Deacon board
[56:18] whatever it was come and see him we set
[56:21] seven days there they're telling him
[56:24] job you might as well make a
[56:28] confession because you have
[56:30] sinned because God wouldn't let a
[56:33] righteous man be tormented like
[56:38] that but God does let a righteous man be
[56:42] tormented like
[56:44] that and the people
[56:47] say and only 10% say that we not a big
[56:50] crowd tonight but every I I supposed to
[56:52] hear everybody inside that we could
[56:53] count the numbers here tonight because
[56:56] because you have sinned God wouldn't let
[56:57] a righteous man be tormented like that
[56:59] but God does let a righteous man be
[57:02] tormented like that you see God that's
[57:04] the thing happened to us because we sin
[57:06] but sometime it is a testing of a saint
[57:08] instead of chasing a sinner
[57:13] hey you hear that sometime it's testing
[57:16] of a saint instead of chastening of a
[57:23] sinner we find out that job was a
[57:25] righteous man though and when God was
[57:28] testing him because Satan said sure when
[57:30] he come before God with the sons of God
[57:32] he said you consider my and Joe perfect
[57:34] man nobody like him and S like that he's
[57:37] a perfect man and that was before the
[57:40] blood of Jesus was
[57:42] shed God called job a perfect man
[57:47] because job was keeping the requirement
[57:49] of God in that day and God said you are
[57:53] perfect you are righteous you are
[57:56] Justified Oh Glory to God
[57:59] hallelujah so Satan say let me have him
[58:01] one time and make him to your face Satan
[58:03] he's in your hands God said don't take
[58:05] his life and that was God's trust that
[58:08] his Prophet would not fail him and he is
[58:11] trusting you and I that we won't fail
[58:17] him CH got killed cattle killed all his
[58:21] riches was lost lost his health
[58:23] everything but his life scraped his Bo

[1:07:29] have killed himself supposing that the
[1:07:31] prisoner had fled but Paul cried out
[1:07:34] with a loud voice do thyself no harm for
[1:07:36] we are all here we free but we here
[1:07:39] hallelujah our bands are loose but we
[1:07:42] are here hallelujah the Prison Walls
[1:07:44] fall down but we are still here oh give
[1:07:46] the Lord some Praises Hallelujah then he
[1:07:48] called for a light and sprang in and
[1:07:50] came trembling fell down before Paul and
[1:07:53] Silas brought them out and said s what
[1:07:57] must I do to be
[1:07:59] saved this is the God now this God
[1:08:03] recognize something is Supernatural
[1:08:05] happening and they said believe on the
[1:08:08] Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be
[1:08:10] saved and thy house oh give the Lord a
[1:08:14] praise offering is this the gospel this
[1:08:17] is the gospel you know oh glory to God
[1:08:21] and they spake unto him the word of the
[1:08:23] Lord and to all that were in his house
[1:08:25] and he took them the same hour of night
[1:08:28] and washed their stripes and was
[1:08:31] baptized in all this straight away no
[1:08:34] time to waste that man was baptized you
[1:08:36] and your house glory to God and brother
[1:08:40] brandham he was talking the same story
[1:08:43] Paul didn't even need the devil to
[1:08:45] assist him in anything say you're a man
[1:08:46] of God and you come to show the away and
[1:08:49] he turned around rebuked the spirit of
[1:08:50] the woman and when it did it caus an
[1:08:52] uproar when they found out the spirit
[1:08:54] left her she couldn't could not tell no
[1:08:56] more fortunes so you don't understand
[1:08:58] now all them fortune tellers is a spirit
[1:09:00] on them they telling people fortune and
[1:09:02] people just paying for their Fortune all
[1:09:05] right and the one that had hired her
[1:09:08] taken care of her caused a great uproar
[1:09:10] and they were beaten and put in jail and
[1:09:12] I can imagine Paul and Silas laying
[1:09:14] there old buggy jail in the inner courts
[1:09:16] way back the outside where the best
[1:09:17] prisoner I kept was bad enough but they
[1:09:19] was on the inside they put put them on
[1:09:21] inside
[1:09:23] inside and did you ever see stocks I had
[1:09:27] the privilege of seeing them they put it
[1:09:29] around your feet they put it around your
[1:09:31] hands and they put them across your neck
[1:09:34] so his neck hands and feet you have your
[1:09:39] bind that call
[1:09:41] stocks any stock market there a
[1:09:43] different kind of stock there a
[1:09:44] different kind of
[1:09:47] stock and just think Paul and Silas for
[1:09:50] preaching the gospel was laying back
[1:09:52] there in that old D Place probably rats
[1:09:54] mice bugs on them
[1:09:56] what a place for a man preaching the
[1:09:58] gospel and we think today we complain
[1:10:01] because we have things a little hard
[1:10:03] look what they did knowing what was
[1:10:05] waiting them perhaps execution next
[1:10:06] morning but they were
[1:10:08] faithful they were shout out they were
[1:10:13] they were faithful then they stayed
[1:10:16] faithful and about midnight I could just
[1:10:19] think how they must have felt their back
[1:10:21] stick into the old dirt and might was
[1:10:23] the leprosy everything on the floor Lane
[1:10:25] against old hard floor dirt floor rats
[1:10:27] running around and the midst of all of
[1:10:29] that perhaps no supper beaten till they
[1:10:31] were bleeding bruised and sore no doctor
[1:10:33] to wash out the wounds or anything for
[1:10:35] infection that we used today something
[1:10:37] like that just throw them back there and
[1:10:39] put them in the stocks put them in the
[1:10:41] condition but they wasn't
[1:10:44] complaining am I preaching to someone
[1:10:46] here tonight but they wasn't complaining
[1:10:49] no not one word of complaint came from
[1:10:53] them what is your complaint
[1:10:56] tonight Oh Glory they should rebuke you
[1:10:59] not one complaint from them and knowing
[1:11:02] maybe next morning magistrate will
[1:11:04] probably call them before the Emperor or
[1:11:06] the sadrin and executive of preaching
[1:11:07] this heresy we find out among midnight
[1:11:10] Paul and SAS must have talked about the
[1:11:12] Lord until midnight then they begin to
[1:11:14] sing hymn some good old hymns like
[1:11:16] there's power in the blood oh oh I love
[1:11:18] Jesus and then they begin to sing all of
[1:11:20] a sudden an earthquake struck the place
[1:11:21] notice how it is done instead of piling
[1:11:24] those walls of that big building right
[1:11:26] on top of them and smashing them to
[1:11:28] death it shook the walls away from them
[1:11:30] so this was a different kind of
[1:11:32] earthquake instead of the walls cave in
[1:11:33] the walls cave out and free them from
[1:11:37] the walls so you want to tell me God
[1:11:39] cast an earthquake in your life and free
[1:11:41] you and break the stocks off of you
[1:11:42] right now some of you are stocks God
[1:11:44] want to break that off of you all them
[1:11:46] binding Powers all them hindrance
[1:11:49] hindrances in your life and then in
[1:11:51] prayer and then in pray and then your in
[1:11:53] finances and then your business then
[1:11:55] whatever you do that God will break that
[1:11:58] hindrance off of your life oh give the
[1:11:59] Lord some Praises I believe you're going
[1:12:01] to be broken tonight I believe you're
[1:12:03] going to understand what faith really is
[1:12:05] tonight and what god require of us to
[1:12:08] present as righteousness oh give the
[1:12:10] Lord some Praises tonight
[1:12:15] Hallelujah over their feet over their
[1:12:16] hands over their neck they will set free
[1:12:18] everyone of them now instead of that big
[1:12:21] old heavy Roman prison breaking in on
[1:12:23] them it fell away from them not only but
[1:12:25] the shackles and things fell off of them
[1:12:27] that is our God when we hold out
[1:12:31] faithful Oh Glory to God and God have
[1:12:34] been testing Believers for years to see
[1:12:36] if they'll be faithful I know the really
[1:12:38] trial come yet people just being tested
[1:12:41] if it could hold on hold on until the
[1:12:43] trial could
[1:12:44] come people getting frightened did you
[1:12:47] hear what I just said God testing people
[1:12:49] and they fall off like flies and the
[1:12:51] test they come yet the test is just to
[1:12:54] hold on you know because the time is not
[1:12:56] yet division is true but the time is
[1:12:59] long you have to wait for the appointed
[1:13:02] time my God I feel inspired tonight but
[1:13:06] said Jesus was behind a veil how he say
[1:13:08] it boy like a he said like behind a a
[1:13:11] curtain and even though he went and die
[1:13:14] his Spirit couldn't come up because they
[1:13:15] said three days so that three days kept
[1:13:18] him
[1:13:19] behind all the power he had he couldn't
[1:13:22] break that because the word said three
[1:13:24] days is so you have to wait there till
[1:13:27] that time run out oh give the Lord some
[1:13:29] Praises there's a law of the word you
[1:13:32] can't break that oh glory to God time
[1:13:35] appointed you can't break that time of
[1:13:37] life you cannot break that appointed
[1:13:39] time you cannot break that harest time
[1:13:41] you cannot break that time of harvest
[1:13:43] you cannot break that oh God everything

[1:13:49] BRI Revival you can't break that there's
[1:13:51] going to be a seven T Revival you cannot
[1:13:53] break that oh there be a super Church

[1:13:58] you can't stop that manifestation of the
[1:14:01] sons of God you cannot stop that adopted
[1:14:03] s you can't stop that allil that's still
[1:14:06] coming coming soon coming soon coming
[1:14:11] soon Hallelujah Give the Lord a shout in
[1:14:14] the house don't let his STS bother you
[1:14:17] don't let the prison bother you give him
[1:14:19] a shout in the house Paul knew he had to
[1:14:22] get out of here so he get to praise God
[1:14:25] Stager not at the promise of God to
[1:14:27] unbel what was strong in faith these
[1:14:30] guys live by faith
[1:14:33] hallelujah oh my Hallelujah that's our
[1:14:37] God when we hold on faithful we must
[1:14:39] stay faithful and as long as we are
[1:14:42] faithful and we might not be in that
[1:14:43] kind of shape now I I hope we don't get
[1:14:45] like that but we can be faithful and
[1:14:49] what we go through with maybe it's a
[1:14:51] persecution maybe somebody laugh at you
[1:14:54] maybe somebody say you old time your
[1:14:55] only ruler let's be faithful just the
[1:14:58] same because are you ready God
[1:15:03] respects our faithfulness to
[1:15:07] that just the same as he respect their
[1:15:11] faithfulness to what they had to go
[1:15:12] through we find out that Roman Centurion
[1:15:15] knowing he would answer with his own
[1:15:17] life he pulled out his sword because he
[1:15:19] know the prison escape he he gone that's
[1:15:21] how it is he's a finished man so he say
[1:15:23] let me finish me before them finish me
[1:15:25] take myself first before them take me he
[1:15:28] go go and kill himself right he pull out
[1:15:30] his sword soon he found out they were
[1:15:32] gone started to kill him to kill himself
[1:15:34] take his own life instead have to go
[1:15:36] through
[1:15:37] punishments maybe he stucks himself he
[1:15:40] Jer on his store to kill himself but
[1:15:41] Paul screamed out and said do yourself
[1:15:43] no harm for we are all
[1:15:46] here look how close that was Bly the man
[1:15:50] almost kill himself and he going to be
[1:15:52] saved and his whole house
[1:15:56] that's hold it we have a God that answer
[1:15:59] prayer a God can heal a God can deliver
[1:16:02] a God can get you out of what you're
[1:16:07] in Paul screamed out and the man
[1:16:09] realized that there there must have be
[1:16:10] something taking place that made this
[1:16:13] man to know that they were Christian men
[1:16:15] or holy man because quickly he fell down
[1:16:17] at the feet imagine he heard them
[1:16:19] singing songs he heard them testifying
[1:16:21] he heard their conversation just think a
[1:16:23] minute folks if that Roman C was
[1:16:25] convinced and convicted because he heard
[1:16:27] them two men beaten prisoners and we are
[1:16:30] still free and we we are not beat or
[1:16:32] prisoners but hearing their testimony
[1:16:35] has such an influence that it cause men
[1:16:37] to say what shall I do to be saved he
[1:16:39] said we should be testifying you young
[1:16:41] people whatever it is you may not preach
[1:16:43] maybe God never called you to preach but
[1:16:45] you are housewife whatever you are
[1:16:47] teenager let's do something and live a
[1:16:50] life that makes the people say well
[1:16:51] that's a Christian going there that's a
[1:16:53] Christian Give the Lord Praises
[1:16:55] hallelujah praise God did you notice
[1:16:58] today most of the ministers keep telling
[1:17:00] people what not to do quit your smoking
[1:17:03] quit your lying quit your stealing quit
[1:17:05] this quit this quit this but he said
[1:17:07] that is not what the man asked what must
[1:17:09] I do not not do what I must do to be
[1:17:12] saved Oh Glory to God he wasn't telling
[1:17:15] them what not to do you know but what
[1:17:16] must I do to be saved and you know what
[1:17:18] our kids are Renegades and things like
[1:17:20] that we must stop that thinking our kids
[1:17:21] are Renegades I believe we must remember
[1:17:24] that the these kids are the best kids in
[1:17:26] the world because they are our children
[1:17:28] and we claim them for
[1:17:31] God I people talk about this one is toed
[1:17:33] and this one so and it curs the child
[1:17:35] and it say this and say say the other
[1:17:36] they're claiming nothing because they
[1:17:38] see a condition in front of them and
[1:17:40] it's easy for them to say these things
[1:17:42] than to apply Faith than to apply prayer
[1:17:45] than to apply praise it's easier to
[1:17:47] curse them and be negative about the
[1:17:50] childrenall
[1:17:59] wow hallu something I get into here your
[1:18:04] salvation will not save that child now
[1:18:06] Paul said and this is the beauty of the
[1:18:08] scriptures believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:18:10] Christ and die and th house shall be
[1:18:12] saved now what did he mean by that what
[1:18:16] does he mean by that here we go he
[1:18:19] didn't mean because they were saved and
[1:18:22] their house would be saved with it he
[1:18:24] meant
[1:18:25] this that
[1:18:27] because if he had enough Faith to be
[1:18:31] saved himself his same amount of faith
[1:18:34] that he had for himself would work for
[1:18:37] his
[1:18:39] children it's not believing in the Lord
[1:18:41] Jesus and you to be saved and you're
[1:18:43] doing nothing no no no no no it's not
[1:18:44] working so automatic I'm saved my
[1:18:46] children are saved because I'm saved
[1:18:47] that's not how it
[1:18:48] working is fine
[1:18:51] print I've got my children there's my
[1:18:54] little son Joseph and Billy Sarah
[1:18:56] Rebecca I want to see each one of them a
[1:18:58] worker of the Gospel doing something I
[1:19:01] want to see them saved and filled with
[1:19:02] the Holy Ghost now I've committed them
[1:19:04] to God and say I'm holding on to God for
[1:19:07] them I believe they're going to be saved
[1:19:10] every one of them I believe they're
[1:19:12] going to be saved I'll have them on the
[1:19:14] other side I don't believe my salvation
[1:19:15] will save them no but my faith in God
[1:19:19] will do
[1:19:20] it you see my faith believing God will
[1:19:24] do it will cause them to come to
[1:19:30] christall I wonder if we going to
[1:19:32] exercise that faith and you see the
[1:19:33] reality of faith in a in a positive way
[1:19:36] and I believe that that is where you
[1:19:38] people praying for your children here we
[1:19:39] go that's the reason your children has
[1:19:41] the manners and the real lady and
[1:19:44] gentleman in this wild age that we
[1:19:45] living in yet that part of them that's
[1:19:48] best I know of any kids see I think the
[1:19:50] reason for that is because your prayers
[1:19:52] for them you have committed them to God
[1:19:54] and holding on now you see the Romans
[1:19:56] said what must I do he just asked for
[1:19:59] himself he said what must I do and I am
[1:20:01] believing for my house and you are
[1:20:03] believing for your house by believing
[1:20:05] what we trust God God imputes our own
[1:20:09] faith like he did Abraham or job or any
[1:20:12] one of them for righteousness did you
[1:20:14] get that your faith is imputed or
[1:20:17] credited to account Hallelujah as
[1:20:20] righteousness
[1:20:22] Hallelujah not your fears
[1:20:25] not your feelings not your emotions your
[1:20:28] faith is what is credited to your
[1:20:31] account as righteousness Hallelujah I
[1:20:35] think it's a wonderful thing God imputes
[1:20:37] our faith like he did Abraham or job or
[1:20:40] any one of them for righteousness you
[1:20:42] see it's a Lotter to us for
[1:20:44] righteousness and that's how thou and
[1:20:47] thy household shall be saved I think it
[1:20:49] is a wonderful thing not only that but
[1:20:51] I'm holding on for every brother all my
[1:20:53] brothers my sister sister I'm not only
[1:20:55] holding for that I'm holding for every
[1:20:57] person that's in my church I'm holding
[1:20:59] for you all I want you to hold for me
[1:21:02] because of the righteousness of faith we
[1:21:04] don't have to make a burnt offering
[1:21:06] Christ is our offering but we have to
[1:21:08] have faith in that offering that Christ
[1:21:11] made oh give the Lord a shout tonight do

[1:21:22] going to be a better man because you're
[1:21:24] going to you're do better we not talking
[1:21:26] about that Christ entered the veil once
[1:21:28] and offer his own blood okay the Lord

[1:31:21] of the Lord Let's see we could wrap up
[1:31:23] Hallelujah
[1:31:26] woo so we rode right there above that
[1:31:29] sin that we used to write in there we
[1:31:32] was a lotted that much Fai because what
[1:31:35] we believe when we are saved is that
[1:31:37] right we believe here that we are Sav so
[1:31:40] then we right up above that because we
[1:31:42] believe we are save now listen to this
[1:31:46] just before I get to the questions
[1:31:49] brother and sister I'm going to give you
[1:31:51] a little secret on myself I guess you
[1:31:54] often wondered how I see those visions
[1:31:57] and things and what makes it it's
[1:31:59] because when he met me that night and
[1:32:01] told me this would happen I believe it I
[1:32:04] suddenly believe it and I go in to pray
[1:32:06] for the sick if I could ever get a
[1:32:08] feeling that something fixing to happen
[1:32:10] they fixing to get well it's always
[1:32:13] about right and that's the way we must
[1:32:15] do with our family with anything we ask
[1:32:19] for we must
[1:32:21] pray and God resp respects Faith this is
[1:32:25] a real powerful quote here that the
[1:32:28] first time I've seen him say that to me
[1:32:30] God respects Faith you see to believe it
[1:32:33] you we must believe that it is right now
[1:32:37] with that little bit of God when you
[1:32:39] said yes Lord Jesus I'm a sinner I'm not
[1:32:42] worthy of your love but you did love me
[1:32:45] so I accept you as my savior immediately
[1:32:49] you walk right out of there what is it
[1:32:51] you stop your Lon you stop your cheating
[1:32:55] you stop your stealing why because
[1:32:57] you're confessing Lord Jesus I'm not I'm
[1:32:59] a sinner I'm not worthy of your love but
[1:33:02] you did love me I accept you as my
[1:33:03] savior and something happens that raises
[1:33:07] you up it's almost like you get a
[1:33:11] lift it's like Peter walking on the
[1:33:13] water he get a lift if that's if that's
[1:33:15] you B me come and the words say come he
[1:33:19] believe it he see it he start to walk on
[1:33:22] the water and and then he took his eyes
[1:33:24] off because the devil K come up a storm
[1:33:25] at the both sides if he keep his eyes
[1:33:27] focused on Jesus he walks straight to
[1:33:28] Jesus you but when he take his eyes off
[1:33:31] he start to
[1:33:32] sink his feate
[1:33:35] fell and his experience
[1:33:39] fell so I could see now how people could
[1:33:42] fall from fate and fall into that sinner
[1:33:44] condition or fall into that condition
[1:33:46] now because the Fate has not been
[1:33:47] maintained
[1:33:55] you stop you're lying you stop your
[1:33:56] cheating you stop you're stealing you
[1:33:57] stop doing things that you oughtn't to
[1:33:59] do why because you believe that you're a
[1:34:01] Christian because you believe you are a
[1:34:03] Christian you rise up from that to
[1:34:05] another
[1:34:07] level because of what you
[1:34:09] believe it Inspire
[1:34:12] youall
[1:34:14] friends Hallelujah a
[1:34:17] conversion outside of the same thing it
[1:34:19] won't last either when you go to church
[1:34:21] you say well I'm going to join the
[1:34:22] church I'm going to be baptized if that
[1:34:24] isn't Come From The Heart of Love To God
[1:34:26] it will never go nowhere but when you
[1:34:28] are converted to Christ a love to Christ
[1:34:31] then you accumulate a faith in Christ
[1:34:35] like you would to your wife or to your
[1:34:37] husband you accumulate a fate that you
[1:34:41] walk in that fate I don't know you just
[1:34:45] something about you just something that
[1:34:46] anchors you there that's the same which
[1:34:48] is about Christ that Christ says and you
[1:34:51] believe it you just stay right with it
[1:34:53] that's the way it just raises you right
[1:34:54] up above it God brings it to pass and
[1:34:56] fulfills his promise if you believe in
[1:34:58] the Lord Jesus you and your house shall
[1:35:00] be saved if you can believe in the Lord
[1:35:02] Jesus not only for salvation for
[1:35:04] yourself but for your loved ones for the
[1:35:05] healing of the child or for a mother or
[1:35:08] for anything that you desire here we go
[1:35:10] now if you know if you desire something
[1:35:12] that wasn't right you wouldn't have
[1:35:14] faith enough to ask God in the first
[1:35:16] place so you know already you know not
[1:35:19] right you're trying something but that
[1:35:21] can't work if you are sincere and know
[1:35:25] that it is right then you can ask God
[1:35:28] with a clean heart knowing it is no
[1:35:31] selfish motive and your objective and
[1:35:33] your motive is exactly right then ask
[1:35:35] God like a child believing you get it
[1:35:38] and you get it I know that but if it
[1:35:42] would be the right thing to do come sit
[1:35:44] down okay so he's talking about if you
[1:35:46] want money from somebody you can't just
[1:35:48] come up
[1:35:49] to you $1,000 you $1,000 like like a
[1:35:52] piper you're like a then people in the
[1:35:54] streets stop in here trying to get money
[1:35:56] that's not the approach he said you had
[1:35:57] to go and talk to the person and you
[1:35:59] know like become friends and whatnot and
[1:36:01] say you know I want to know I really not
[1:36:03] you know sticky with it here and talk to
[1:36:05] them so he's making that reference he
[1:36:07] said what you express our feelings to
[1:36:09] each other you are my friend that's the
[1:36:11] reason I come to you no that's the same
[1:36:14] way it is by Christ say you are my
[1:36:18] Lord I am sick the doctor say he can't
[1:36:22] do nothing for me but I know you can
[1:36:25] because you are my Lord oh give the Lord
[1:36:28] some Praises tonight do you
[1:36:32] understand just speak it over with him
[1:36:35] until you feel that you receive it
[1:36:37] that's your faith so you are speaking
[1:36:40] until that feeling of faith and the this
[1:36:43] beautiful quote say when Abraham came to
[1:36:45] the fullness of
[1:36:46] believing it's almost like if Abraham
[1:36:49] belief got capped and it Burt into the
[1:36:51] reality of our faith believing
[1:36:54] create the substance of Faith or or
[1:36:57] believe and give the birth of Faith

[1:37:06] that's your faith faith is the substance
[1:37:08] of things open forth and when when I
