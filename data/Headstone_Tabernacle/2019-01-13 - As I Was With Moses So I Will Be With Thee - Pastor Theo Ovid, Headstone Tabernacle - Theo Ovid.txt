we had a blessed time by butter at San Jorge and Thursday those Nvidia amen and also this Wednesday I believe in from Mexico yes some meetings in Mexico so I want you to remember be in prayer we slip across the Mexico come on Wednesday wanna turn to scripture Joshua chapter tree wanna read one verse verse seven Ephesians 4 wanna read from verse 11 to 13 and acts 5 11 to 16 we didn't just for a tree we're invisible and the Lord said unto Joshua this day would I begin to magnify thee and the sight of all Israel the demon know that as I was with Moses so I will be with thee Ephesians chapter 4 we didn't on verse 11 and he gives some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ on a last scripture from Acts chapter 5 11 to 16 and this was just after illness and Sapphira fell dead in church after lying into the Holy Ghost verse 11 says a great fear came among all the church and upon as many as heard these things and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one Accord in Solomon's porch and of the rest this no man joined himself to them but the people magnify them and believers were the more added to the law multitude sport of men and woman in so much that they brought forth the sick unto the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them the Kim also of a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem bring in sick folks and then which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone let's ball head one more time father we thank you for your word common and interpreted to our hearts well you took away that profit but you didn't take away the angel that let that profit father you said the angel of the Lord is on all fixing things are wrong for your comment come and fix things around yet this morning by your spirit Lord me the pillar fire drop down inside I hear and speak to your people father granted Lord in Jesus mi ask it email I mean when you may be seated oh praise be to Jesus it's always a blessing and a privilege that we as believers could gather together and Bible say we should gather even as that more the day approaching we should be gathering even more often oh praise God and I believe in all my heart that as we gather we will hear more and more dusty at the Lord will more will hear one more spirit given things because the spirit have the minister to meet the needs and the challenge of that is where we living in praise the name of the Lord we have had the books and tapes for 40-plus years and it could do so much and no more and God is not going to use mechanical things God gonna use a man that's what he come to use man human what is not gonna be faithful to sit down on the side and sit down on a bench when he has man that he could use who always wanted to use man he want to live as in a man he actually became a man or God is a man Oh hallelujah the man Christ Jesus neither same yesterday today and forever so but I want to use you put on your tie and your shoes and your jacket you want to wear your news so this morning our title as I was with Moses so I will be with thee but a ban on preach a message having the same title I'll be drawing a lot of stuff from there but the

happy to know that the Lord Jesus has never left us neither will he ever forsake us he's the same blessed Lord Jesus from eternity to eternity never feel and he's just as real today as he was in the days of Galilee where I'm staying here in your lovely city with a very lovely people yesterday morning there was something happened there was a vision came to me in the room visions just don't just come on the platform this is just a little part of it and in the room a vision came and I went to the table where the sisters were sitting present now I said I saw a vision of a little girl just about so high blond-headed she was destined to die today in a wreck in the black automobile I said he had told me to pray for a child that this would be bypassed did you hear the vision said the child is gonna die today and he told me to pray for the child that this would be bypassed and I have and I said it is thus saith the Lord you will hear of it in the next 2-3 days seem our love little girl of that home was out in the automobile we're just barely escaped debt was brought back safely how our Heavenly Father just marvelously just when we was sitting while ago talking about it those things happen all the time and different things it's a sure sign that our Lord has risen from the dead he lives among us He loves us all he lives among us he loves us all he loves all the Methodists here he loves all the Baptists all the Presbyterian all the Pentecostal and Nazarene all he loves everybody if anybody ever problem with that they have a real problem little denominational barriers keeps our fellowship apart but God loves us just the same we are his children his grace overrides the whole thing now if this don't make you praise God and shout this morning keep pressing on [Applause] his grace authorized the whole thing and he loves us all whether we are white brown yellow black doesn't make a difference to him we all come from one person Adam each one of us whether we are white brown black or yellow we could transfuse blood to each other and save each other's life by blood transfusion but I'm so thankful that one come who was made different from all of us and through the transfusion of his blood we can live forever the Lord Jesus who was dinner Jew nor Gentile he was God quad own blood was in him he was recreated blood wasn't you any man the Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary and she conceived and brought for jesus christ the son of god which was the blood coming to the male was god's own blood that we are needed Jewish blood or Gentile blood it was the blood for me Manuel's vain so we are so thankful for that making now all the middle wars are partitioned and bringing us into the one lovely fellowship together give the Lord some praises [Applause] continue and this one here is from sit-ins even activities but a Branham now we appreciate your prayer prayer changes thing there's only one thing that can change the mind of God one and that's prayer [Applause] forty percent a evening [Applause] I think I'll redesign here there is only one thing that will change you here watching the mind of God [Applause] let me see so what we read just no deal about this little girl she was supposed to die God did this prophet and say if you pray you could interrupt what was this time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] in every season you're not about as if prophecies will feel well if that vision was a prophecy it filled the prophecy negative about you could fail I don't have your dream yourself last night I don't care a prophet come and tell you a vision he had of you prayer is the only thing [Applause] the doctors will give you two weeks to live and prayer to change that the 15 years that's what we're talking about [Applause] [Music] let's continue we appreciate your prayer prayer changes things there's only one thing a Keynesian mind of God that's prayer but God can say anything this God can say anything and prayer can change it I wonder if you are saying 'man did not my torture or you taught this night they did not my interpretation you know I have feel so listen to this is what the tips are yeah and not only that but a man will find scriptures to back that up because he come to open the scriptures if the scripture will have that he can reveal that it has our scripture to back that up so there is a gambling single your

meeting is to pray and seek or to help the time you love them they love these words this is how more profit let's continue the thing of it is the day there's a quote I've read before I'll read it back again we don't try to establish the wood of Gordon people's hearts we're trying to establish ourselves churches are trying to establish the doctrine of the church in a person's heart and the world first quote I read by Ballarat and George was there's no such thing as a holy church the Holy Ghost can be preached in it button in there you'll find good bad indifferent the Holy Ghost the church itself can't hold the Holy Ghost it is individuals opposed of illegal so it will leak out of a Trixie so we can't say we have it nobody else doesn't have it that doesn't make any sense we are something special we are see Abel is in shock it sounds good but it's not it's not true we are right everybody else is wrong it sounds good the busi people's head not hot but that's not the way he said we can hold the honey because honey is watching us in a group where people mash the corn when people upset you but you could forgive you could drop it you can behave yourself hallelujah even Jesus have mercy Father forgive them they know not what to do and we know faith is based upon forgiveness so you have no fear to get unless you could forgive you just messing up your own self yes yes yes if you can't come out them aunts and grudges and bad feelings and if you can't job that you in real trouble because you will never get the faith to claim and get the things on God because all things are bodies of faith you could never get nothing from God with reason and feelings and emotions God does respect faith faith as the currency of purchase and the kingdom of heaven [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so you can have a hundred thousand dollars worth of feelings that can't buy nothing in heaven but you have a hundred thousand would with a faith brother in seven come down and the biggest thing about faith you don't have to be rich to have faith listen to the point hacked this is the kingdom of God something brought upon your poor rich in faith it is a currency thy faith hath made thee whole by faith Abraham - why's it my fate Samson my faith even - chest time I fit you raise your hands this morning by faith you stood up never stand up in the service before but by vectors tunnel hallelujah you come with me pin and by faith you shake your knee because you're shaking on the pain the shaking of the condition I say hallelujah the kidneys giving trouble I say to take your own hands and the rest of like that this idea by faith you are believing you're knowing Tennyson's building upon your hand trains godmothers here this year is here wherever it is you lay hands on your own self Mississippi so we are commanded to establish the Word of God Paul said I didn't come to you with enticing words of man that you freed my dressed up in the knowledge of man but I come to you in the power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost that your faith might rest in God so if we come at a certain knowledge and certain information as a whoop oh boy but he could be really he is good he's very good he's like oh man I see manatee all but Paul didn't preach that way Paul what power that when they look at power this is what what they want to meet that power they want to touch that power Paul is not a power he's a channel of the power and when wat po po presented power you wonder connected very source [Applause] long time when the other Paul overseas you can't call overseas

of God established the word it unbelief and established the kingdom of God in a man's heart and the kingdom of God cannot be established the man hearts unless God made him does or praise the name of the Lord this from the Division of the United States I when I first read this message the envision some of you may not even know what a Branham spoken message called the envision of United States I sometime I wonder in some if it is just spiritual or if it's also natural you talk about the Russians you talk about soldiers he talked about it's really something else this is normal game this is real God sent a message and you so want to know this message know what is prophesied in this message that things wouldn't take you on our way as you were saying as I think today what a time you're living in that evangelism they put it all in great big bright lights when you see the advances coming to town you wonder why emissions has been guilty of the same that's right I wonder who is coming to town sometime is the boundaries or Jesus Christ I went to a place you never go we're certainly in France they were supposed to come and why that picture of evangelists the man of the hour the man

continue where we are all glory to God skip that so go toward the profit this was a translation from and prophesy because that was chosen it was in French and the translation in English because I was chosen the narrow part you see against I had to walk by yourself I can't understand that Moses had to make his choice - he didn't have to do it but he did it the hard way because I was older than our path the hard way though has walked of your own choosing in other words I didn't have to do it I can inside and go with them if I wanted to but I stayed with the world that was picked the precise and correct and precise decision in his mind way he said what because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven on which D now that's what I wonder when I die will it be then I happen to think heaven is not portion of the different portions of here have missed the king of him that's within us which one waits for what a glorious didn't know as me this in itself is that which will give and may come to pass tremendous victory in the love divine so the victory that God promised us this tremendous victory not just victory I want you to get that tremendous victory it connects with the people have know their God shall be strong and do great exploits so the promise for your life is tremendous victory promise for your life is your copter run over not just a sip from the cup but your cup to run over so let's let's continue now but a banner you see what coming onto the Jordan meant we are dunya now let's cross over let's quit playin let's cross over to the other side now cause it all belongs to us can i yeah being a mariner it's all belongs to us dem visions have never failed they can't feel because they come from God I believe it with all as within me we are not the Helen Shepards the Hollander we run back in doing this we will cross Jordan the separation then he's a God break to us the seals that's on the back of the book let us enter in that great place now for Joshua divided inheritance that God hath left for them oh my the seals in the back of the book that's where the thunders are that we can cross Jordan to walk into another Ephesians Oh glory to God hallelujah it used to be coming here this morning this morning our monies are saying here his wife they use our sing a song that trilled me it goes like this forgive me Lord and try me one more time I'll be yours if you will be mine if I fall if I feel let me rise and try again forgive me Lord and try me one more time I like that for any good so let's get up to get warmed it'll hurt but if he's a still a soldier and got a purpose something to fight for he will rise and try again and Joshua the new commander of the army after Moody's passed on seeing that God stared with him and his mistakes he held his commissioner no matter what Moses done it was Moses office that God respected hallelujah more there was might be a little character but is the office that he respected he was a prophet and when he was above all the prophets he was really more than any prophet he had his own sister Lafferty for Marilyn it's European girl he called him together and said don't you fear God okay and that's a good thing don't trample upon God's people you hurt him when you do so God had commissioned Moses his failures meant nothing God knows is hot and we see every David David was all kind of stuff but he was a man after God's own heart sees what the heart Oh glory no God and one time Moses had too much to do and God took his spirit and invited among 17 they had no more spirit than he had in the beginning they only had more machinery but seemed among the Spirit God can put his entire spirit upon a man if he wants to or he can scattered among thousands if you want to Oh glory to God one day put his whole spirit upon a man called Jesus now he scattered a few stitches everywhere God keeps his commission or give the Lord some praises hallelujah glory of God let's call it further I think of a minister today that's call of God to step into the tracks where Jesus stood what a command what a commission but each that's called of God is commissioned to stand in that same place I'll be with you even in you to the end of the week each Minister is called to stand where he would the works that I do shall you do also each minister that is ordained of God is commanded to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that he's performed that's quite a command and if it must have felt when Josh was standing there that morning talking to God I'll be with you and sworn like that no the church organizations that might be closed off yesterday the church organizations has filled I don't think people get that yet and that's like waters allow judges to feel and fall that people go to lean on men or teachers just crashing and burning and falling it's not personal god I don't want to give no man no glory and the glory after what the God you know and any man want to take God's glory God will deal with that and he just want to take your ego will deal with that so what the church organization and listen the message itself cannot be denomination because it messes the light but you've got building dimensions along the life you can be less I wrong the message but the message itself is pure it's the word it's God I'll give the Lord a shout hallelujah if you build systems along the message but the message itself you can hold that and pin it down because God Himself the captain on board you can lock up inside of here he would be cold he will go out Oh glory to God I love him for that or glory that God hallelujah my my John debacles wasn't mixed but nobody when Jesus I'll mix it with everybody they have fallen for John not mixing they have all but Jesus mix well Jesus city well do need up a physician is he sick go here among wine-bibber see among drunkards your mom what kind of people anybody country who defies you to mess with Jesus went and then a problem with that so then that is where they get so excited when they cut the woman caught in the very act of adultery and they come with this tool and moves this see and I just released it last night and you know the pretty tip and moves they say and they have the coat and they have the stones this is no problem and Moses say that which one of you without sin cast the first stone he bring it down to mirror their hearts I wanted to see the Hat condemned in them oh god the water will leave the one idea he said woman wait and an accusers go and sin no more freer from us and I wonder same Jesus that same Jesus Oh glory was brought up open the blind eyes at door man free said captive free I want to see that same Jesus not message Jesus Jesus Bible Jesus messages interpretation Jesus like Jesus a quantity scrutiny group when is them is trials when is used judgment the message Jesus when they go to the thing they come fill it up when you go to your thing they want to expose it its message Jesus hallelujah it's test for them but just meant for you shut up you don't know we drive it's just it's just we're drying up the seed gets in dead right but yours prophecies will yes prophecies coming coming people looking us today we will listen to them on the internet and they still alive that's why we on the internet the short of your life [Music] quicken power thank you Jesus well this morning we have some student problems so we're not streaming so they not seen this this is after quick in power hallelujah praise God and everything went dead any message until brown put your message I'm the rising of the Sun when you come and said dynamics he says the church emphasizing mechanics mechanics but time for the dynamics we could not go get me the car rollin hallelujah she was a good use your pollen Erica the shiny rims and you surely steering wheel on it glistening dad let me I got spin I went to Niki's so nothing could there's no dynamics inside of that hallelujah nothing nothing firing

dynamics or blowing a call when that engine turn is gonna tumble we coin down to the rupture between come to the resurrection we're gonna escape the Beast let's get the work of the kitchen and keep the false prophet the Beast system we escaped in all of that glory of God my lord hallelujah let's go you may be seated so forum says the church organizations denomination has failed they will not take the church over God will raise up a new system I am saying that this morning I am prophesying that this morning I am saying this as present tense God is going to raise up a new system an

a great power come among the church just before it going it's not too hard to pray that because you promised it and we are looking for that tooth pull that we know we'll do great things in our myths we have to be looking for it we're I'm sorry field moving within me don't want to pray for everybody he's looking for money if I see any good pull we have to come to the spot where we want to expect what God promised in this hour not just come to church this is not a Catholic Church of that road go up so this is a hilly Mariano Rivera no this is not that this is the word of promise it's the last message if you were to get dresses Weiss be the self ready Oh glory to God thank you Lord Jesus listen to this oh my it's not so much a stuffy a man I really have fifty eight pages I'll reach the tea so I'm twenty more peaches again [Applause] listen listen listen listen listen but Rama he says listen to the Buddha now the people that I've tried to tell this gospel truth and it turned their back on it or who we are a laugh at it that seems like an insult I don't care to me but they're the things I've been saying it's the truth trying to help them like shoo another boat and say cross over get over the swirling stream you wanna die you're gonna perish there and they laugh at you walk away it feels like if they walk on away there's nothing I can do about it but see that I can do but I listen so he recognized people walking away right and he said but I want to run down the back now and persuade them come on back I've got to have that feeling because I know there is somebody out there that hasn't come in yet what he's talking about the last name there's somebody out here that hasn't come in as yet and I'm going to fish till the last fish is caught I want to do that no in order to do this are you ready I'm expecting something to happen in a prayer meeting [Applause] you do face I want to show you what a branham's expectation this he's expecting he said what he said something many of you remember the vision of the last poll that tape or rather you remember there's something happened just before that I've seen the light go down into that place I will meet you in there that will be the third pole in that little room and he got a script for that when you pray pray to your father who sees in secret and the Pharisees in secret sorry what you opened me so he connect the third pole to your prayer closet Oh [Music] glory to God hallelujah the kid pulls their prayer closet he's in a seven seed bring him back again it the lamb took and took the book out of the right hand of him and claim what he owned he had redeemed it has always been that to opponent from souls in prison what if that could be read to it posted eternal loss could you imagine the power of God come capped the pyramid of your life pour a boil in the church and then the message select a preacher those who cannot be saved because the last name come in the door is no shut it's going to be a toothed pole reach into the eternal loss on his toilet pull when he preached the loss that couldn't be saved no more they were down there in them big painted eyes and burn I'm sorry I'm in hell with all the makeup and mascara and when he called he said I made him a cup you say hello son what is it they instead of know all them drama they have on the face it's from hell they take it looking pretty you think it looking nice but hell as an largest mouth he say hell as no one the earth he saw a vision of that in hell he said watch preach the source in hell that did not accept mercy but we're eternally separate from his presence and yet they have to recognize it that he was God loss could never be safe they rejected mercy that was still full recently eternal laws Noah triples his - it was today lost when the door was shut oh my brother gives me a church full of the Holy Ghost ball doing one year what all theology field in two thousand years you ain't yet prophecy till the anointing of the church really strike home to that fearful at the remnant after the door the gel that is closed go and anoint assist them he who is thirty be filthy still he was right to the righteous till he was holy be holy still go along the church with the power of God and things will be taking place and then he saw the prison he began to pray Almighty God on this elected church I pray God that you will pour your blessings that they might receive our Ministry of testimony like lot had like Noah had like Jesus had on the return a loss if it be there that day them serve the sealed into the kingdom of God don't you rely upon some kind of emotional workup don't you rely upon your spoke in tongues I believe in those things I did all those things but if the life of Jesus is in you it will live itself out believe in every word because he cannot deny himself or glory that God lady if you or man whoever you are if those things that's so real in the world that Jesus died for not just to have a church to have a emotional punch but to have a bunch of got his spirit living in him it's bright and you know it doesn't operate through you that week you know these things in the Bible you just can't believe it to be so and you want to remember in prayer now whenever I close every head bowed I wonder this late hour and then he said this this is important it's maybe almost past feeling time because there will come a time like that when the Spirit of God will be taken from the earth and there will be no more the church will remain a while preaching because it has to preach the eternal lost just as every ministry did come into the age the last part of every ministry preached eternal loss there will be a ministry now that were preached eternal loss as they refused to receive it Oh glory to God what a crucial time that we live in how careful we must be that remain true to the word not take from it to act it for he would speak my God had not spoken makes him their liar what I had particularly his mind is this at the turn of the century the hunger for God was generated and if anything each brought a cry for the Spirit of God and when the cry was answered by God seven for the manifestation in tongues interpretation and prophesy a group immediately almost contrary to the word drop my doctrine that tongues was evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost tongues was far from evidence they were manifestations but not evidence the falsity of doctrine can only be seen by a lack of scripture to substantiate it but those who subscribe to the doctrine immediately here is organized on the basis of doctrine proven that they were not in the truth as they were have people believed it look good it looked at original Pentecost but they prove it wasn't because organized it could not be back to the original word until the world restored the prophet had not yet come but now according to the time of his tan in laude son age the prophet messenger a version ten seven must already be in the land now see the Lord must be here ready thus the true seed is ready for maturing and then harvest this is the last warning there will be not another the trollin will be set up the trail foundation on delayed
