[9:24] under the shed blood and we thank god
[9:26] for his grace for his mercy for his love
[9:29] can we just bow our heads for a word of
[9:31] prayer
[9:33] our graces heavenly father we thank you
[9:36] tonight
[9:36] that we could gather one more time on
[9:40] lord this day this day that lord that
[9:43] you have made
[9:44] and you have ordered and give us this
[9:47] great privilege to come together
[9:49] lord to sit and have a conversation
[9:51] around your word
[9:53] lord that you couldn't find a better way
[9:56] to leave your thoughts for us lord you
[9:59] put it in writing lord as the written
[10:01] word and
[10:02] you put it to lord and we could see the
[10:04] mountains and the stars and
[10:06] see all these things to see expressions
[10:08] of your thinking expressions of your
[10:10] thoughts and
[10:11] lord how you put it in such a way that
[10:13] we could
[10:14] actually step into your mind at any
[10:16] point in time lord and
[10:18] lord not like the rest of the world who
[10:20] may have
[10:21] exposure to the bible but because lord
[10:24] you choose to
[10:25] send a prophet to us we can go into the
[10:27] book and see
[10:28] what others cannot see father because
[10:30] this prophet was given
[10:32] the insight to shine light on the
[10:34] written word so that we could see the
[10:36] reveal word that was based on scripture
[10:38] so we thank you
[10:40] for your grace we thank you for your
[10:42] great
[10:43] mysteries that we lord have come to
[10:46] understand and to realize that this
[10:48] great prophet was to
[10:49] lord reveal every mystery and we thank
[10:51] you for
[10:52] lord every scripture every book every
[10:55] chapter every verse every line and we
[10:57] get comfort and courage in this so may
[11:00] you bless us tonight as we approach your
[11:02] scriptures may you take complete control
[11:04] lord of everyone that's in this room
[11:06] those that will join and
[11:07] lord perhaps somebody may even listen to
[11:09] this at some point may it all be a
[11:11] blessing and
[11:12] lord uh as we look at what's happening
[11:15] lord even beyond this meeting to see the
[11:18] the the global realm the the political
[11:21] realm the
[11:22] natural realm to see that even now uh
[11:25] the united states is going through their
[11:27] own
[11:28] period of of a time of decision lord to
[11:31] see the whole world is waiting on a
[11:33] decision
[11:34] lord of what would unfold and to see
[11:37] that all these are
[11:38] pieces of this great puzzle this great
[11:40] plan that you have designed and ordered
[11:43] a certain way to bring about a certain
[11:45] outcome
[11:45] so father we submit ourselves to your
[11:48] plan for tonight that the plan you have
[11:50] for us
[11:51] knowing that there's a certain outcome
[11:53] lord the bible speaks of an expected end
[11:56] lord away how things will turn out lord
[11:58] may each person tonight leave this
[12:00] meeting tonight
[12:02] with a resolution with a commitment with
[12:04] a desire
[12:05] to be better christians lord may we each
[12:08] leave with a desire to be different lord
[12:11] may
[12:12] lord our thinking be renewed you said
[12:14] that we ought to be transformed by the
[12:16] renewing of our minds so
[12:18] may our minds be reset tonight lord and
[12:21] lord even as the word and the
[12:23] conversation will go forth if there's
[12:25] anyone
[12:26] lord that desiring a touch and
[12:27] encouragement or law whatever it may be
[12:30] you are more than able to do it tonight
[12:32] so
[12:33] father we commit the service into your
[12:34] hands and we committed time into your
[12:36] hands in the precious thing of jesus
[12:37] christ
[12:38] amen and amen and amen well certainly
[12:41] a great privilege to be here tonight and
[12:44] um thanking god
[12:45] that uh through our different trials our
[12:48] different experiences our
[12:50] our ups our downs uh
[12:53] and every step of the way that god is in
[12:56] control we thank god for his control
[12:58] and uh i was saying to my wife abigail
[13:02] uh know yesterday the announce that um
[13:05] there were no new uh coronavirus cases
[13:08] in
[13:09] in trinidad and i know a few people were
[13:11] jubilant about that and then today they
[13:13] announced 50 new cases
[13:14] you know so um and and you see in people
[13:17] swinging back and forth and this this
[13:20] this experience of uncertainty and
[13:22] and and you know it's it's quite it's
[13:25] quite
[13:25] a time that the world is living in and
[13:28] uh
[13:28] of course on a on a big macro level
[13:31] um we have the election uh decisions
[13:35] and there are those who are pro this and
[13:37] prove that i am pro the lord tonight
[13:39] um the outcome of of this
[13:43] this vote is something no matter what
[13:45] the outcome is we have to deal with it
[13:47] um
[13:48] and it really i am i'm trying to operate
[13:51] above that level because i believe that
[13:53] i come from
[13:54] a different uh plane of existence i come
[13:57] from a different
[13:59] order you know i come from a different
[14:02] you know where i come from these systems
[14:04] operate
[14:05] very differently you know so you don't
[14:07] want to be trapped into these natural
[14:09] these natural things and and i see a lot
[14:11] of people get heated about these things
[14:13] and i really try to live above that you
[14:14] know so
[14:15] but i want to encourage you tonight uh
[14:17] to keep pressing the battle i want to
[14:18] encourage you
[14:19] uh to keep focused on the race the race
[14:22] that we are all in
[14:24] uh we are all in the race whether you're
[14:27] 15 years old or you're 95 years old
[14:29] you're still
[14:30] in the race you know and we know the
[14:32] race is not really swift but it's a race
[14:34] of endurance
[14:35] for those who could endure those who
[14:36] could stand the test of time
[14:38] so um you would have heard me say
[14:41] oftentimes that
[14:42] our bible study is really a conversation
[14:44] uh
[14:45] look into scripture to inspire to
[14:47] encourage
[14:48] um maybe it'll be something you heard
[14:50] before maybe it'll be something you
[14:52] heard for the first time
[14:53] maybe uh you see another perspective of
[14:55] it and your understanding opens up in
[14:58] such a way that it gets you to a reset
[15:00] and to to to take courage to be able to
[15:02] step out
[15:03] you know um so tonight uh i think it was
[15:06] three weeks ago i did
[15:08] uh uh study on introducing solomon
[15:12] it was a study of solomon part one and i
[15:13] know um during the last few months i've
[15:16] had a lot of part ones
[15:18] um i never really got into part two of
[15:21] of things because i i try to wait until
[15:23] i get a nudge with how to go but i do
[15:25] want to continue
[15:26] um along the vein of solomon so tonight
[15:30] it'll be a study of solomon part two
[15:33] exploring the book of proverbs
[15:35] uh that's that's that's the study
[15:37] tonight a study of solomon part 2
[15:39] exploring the book of proverbs
[15:43] because there is no way we could get
[15:45] into the whole book tonight
[15:48] there's a lot of wisdom in there and
[15:50] just to put things in context
[15:52] a study of solomon uh exploring the book
[15:55] of proverbs is specific because
[15:57] solomon is credited um with with writing
[16:01] three books um he wrote proverbs
[16:04] he wrote ecclesiastes and where we find
[16:07] there's a time and a season he also
[16:09] wrote the
[16:10] song of solomon we know proverbs to be
[16:13] the book of wisdom
[16:14] ecclesiastes is called by theologians
[16:17] the book of folly
[16:18] uh and song of solomon the book of love
[16:21] and when you look at proverbs a lot of
[16:23] people look at the proverbs as a very
[16:25] disjointed uh disconnected just a lot of
[16:29] different points but it's more than
[16:30] points because as you go above the book
[16:34] and you go in and you come back out you
[16:35] start to see
[16:36] certain patterns in the book and you
[16:40] would
[16:40] begin to realize that there's a certain
[16:42] thread that repeats
[16:44] and you will realize that as you go
[16:46] through the book of proverbs
[16:48] really the bulk of the book of verbs
[16:50] really speak about three people
[16:52] you know it doesn't call them by name
[16:55] but it's still
[16:56] three people that the book focuses on
[16:59] and it focuses also on
[17:01] three mean i want to use the word
[17:03] qualities
[17:04] you know um and the three qualities or
[17:08] characteristics or or or key messaging
[17:11] of proverbs is about wisdom
[17:14] understanding and knowledge
[17:15] there are three things here wisdom
[17:17] understanding and knowledge
[17:19] and the three main characters in the
[17:22] book of proverbs
[17:23] although they are not named we know them
[17:27] we know them in others and at times we
[17:30] know them in ourselves
[17:33] one is called the wise one is called the
[17:36] simple
[17:37] and one is called the fool you would see
[17:41] multiple references as in addressing the
[17:45] wise
[17:45] this character called wise you'll see a
[17:48] lot of references of speaking about the
[17:50] simple
[17:52] and you'll see a lot of references about
[17:54] the fool
[17:55] and this might sound very simple to
[17:58] start but it but it
[17:59] it builds and i want us to really take
[18:01] heed because many times in life
[18:03] we i'll put it like this most of the
[18:06] problems we end up in
[18:08] life is because we have failed to
[18:11] probably
[18:12] to properly understand the role and
[18:14] application of
[18:15] knowledge understanding and wisdom and
[18:18] we also
[18:20] don't really pay enough attention to
[18:22] understand when we are being a fool
[18:25] where we are being simple and our
[18:28] failure at times to be wise
[18:31] i'm sure if you reflect on
[18:34] your decisions in life and with the way
[18:37] you did things and the way you approach
[18:39] situations and the way you approach
[18:41] conversations and
[18:43] every time you find that the you know i
[18:45] could have done it a better way
[18:46] it is you come into an appreciation and
[18:48] a recognition
[18:50] that there is a better way and that in
[18:53] that particular situation at that
[18:54] particular point in time you may have
[18:56] either lacked your knowledge
[18:58] you may have lacked the understanding or
[19:01] me you may have lacked your wisdom
[19:03] and the more you spend time on these
[19:05] things as a believer
[19:07] it is about your maturity so as a father
[19:11] you could lack all of the knowledge as a
[19:13] father
[19:14] you could lack the understanding of
[19:16] being a father you can lack the wisdom
[19:18] of being a father
[19:19] you could lack the knowledge of being a
[19:21] mother you could lack the understanding
[19:23] of being a mother
[19:24] you can lack the wisdom of being a
[19:25] mother and i could
[19:27] run that through every single situation
[19:29] you go into the workplace
[19:31] there are some people who you know have
[19:32] the knowledge of the working of
[19:34] but they are not wise with how they
[19:36] operate within the work
[19:38] you see so let me give you an example
[19:40] and we'll get the description a bit but
[19:41] we're having a conversation tonight
[19:43] take a doctor for example you talk about
[19:45] a doctor with good bedside manner
[19:47] and good bedside manner is not something
[19:50] that is really taught
[19:52] because a doctor by training is taught
[19:54] to clinically analyze a particular
[19:56] situation
[19:57] and be able to provide a diagnosis but
[19:59] there are some who are
[20:01] better than others at being able to
[20:02] present the situation to you
[20:04] so they say the way that doctor relates
[20:07] to you
[20:07] is called his bedside manner the way he
[20:10] says things to you
[20:11] you know and i can just relate my own
[20:14] personal experience
[20:15] today to today i was sharing with my
[20:17] wife a meeting that i was in
[20:19] and i was brought in as a consultant to
[20:22] analyze a certain situation
[20:24] and the person who was working on the
[20:27] project before we were invited in was in
[20:29] a meeting as well
[20:31] now in that situation um
[20:35] when the person who was on the project
[20:36] before is also there you have to be very
[20:38] careful
[20:39] with how you deal with it you could have
[20:42] the knowledge of
[20:43] what to fix but if you walk in there and
[20:44] say well you have to fix this fix this
[20:46] fix is that wrong that wrong not wrong
[20:48] you will totally destroy the person who
[20:50] in the room
[20:51] who has been caring for this project all
[20:53] along
[20:54] you see so as believers and the
[20:57] applications here that we see
[20:59] in the book of proverbs is about us
[21:02] maturing as christians it's about us
[21:04] operating a certain way and i want to
[21:06] just
[21:06] read this reference here so when we
[21:09] speak about the wise the fool and the
[21:11] simple and i
[21:12] and i and i said it we know people who
[21:14] we could consider wise and it could be
[21:16] situational wisdom
[21:18] so there are people you may go to
[21:19] because they're wise about a certain
[21:20] thing they're things that
[21:21] that i'm not aware of if i want to go
[21:23] and hunt i want to find somebody who
[21:25] wise who has wisdom about hunting
[21:27] because i don't know enough i like the
[21:30] knowledge
[21:31] of hunting i like it i like the
[21:32] understanding of hunting and i certainly
[21:35] don't have the wisdom because wisdom is
[21:37] about application wisdom is is about
[21:39] skillful use of something
[21:41] all right so again i want to make the
[21:43] point that this applies
[21:44] in a natural it applies in business it
[21:47] applies in your education
[21:48] it applies in your marriage it applies
[21:50] in your conversation
[21:52] and yes god is interested in it and we
[21:54] will see
[21:55] through his scripture how much interest
[21:57] he has in you having knowledge
[21:59] so in other words i'm challenging you
[22:01] tonight to stop saying i don't
[22:03] know i'm pushing you tonight to say i
[22:06] don't
[22:07] you can't keep saying i don't understand
[22:08] because we'll see this scripture makes
[22:10] it clear
[22:10] in all that getting get understanding
[22:13] anybody with me
[22:14] tonight the scripture is pushing us to
[22:16] get wisdom
[22:18] you can't forever say well because my
[22:20] father didn't show me or because i
[22:22] didn't go to school
[22:23] or because i didn't those become now
[22:26] non-issues
[22:27] and they really are crutches that you
[22:29] need to drop
[22:30] and if there's a gap to be closed we
[22:32] have to close the gap
[22:34] so this is tonight is like almost like a
[22:36] motivational bible study if i could use
[22:38] that too
[22:39] and quite honestly i've reached a point
[22:42] in my own maturity
[22:43] where under inspiration i'm not moved
[22:47] by people's interpretation of how we
[22:50] operate as a sovereign church
[22:51] so i am very big on us being the best we
[22:55] can be for the kingdom of god
[22:57] i see nowhere in scripture where we
[23:00] supposed to be living under our
[23:01] privileges
[23:02] i see nowhere in scripture that says
[23:05] we're supposed to be frustrated
[23:06] and depressed and we supposed to i can't
[23:09] find it
[23:09] in scripture i can't find scriptures
[23:12] that say
[23:13] this journey supposed to be licks all
[23:15] the time
[23:16] there are scriptures that speak to god
[23:18] taking us
[23:19] through experiences for an objective god
[23:22] is not chastising because he feeling
[23:24] chastise
[23:25] to quote but over and over that's it you
[23:27] know it's not like you want to chastise
[23:29] so he chastising it is all to an
[23:31] objective and the objective is our
[23:33] maturity
[23:34] so this teaching is about wisdom solomon
[23:38] as we would have taught three weeks ago
[23:40] was principle when it comes to wisdom
[23:43] and and and the bible said he who win it
[23:45] a soul is wise
[23:47] so it means that if you have the
[23:48] testimony of bringing somebody to the
[23:50] lord
[23:50] god is saying that is that is wisdom on
[23:53] display
[23:54] when you can bring someone into contact
[23:56] with
[23:57] the experience of the supernatural and
[23:59] an encounter with god
[24:01] and you're actually winning a soul and
[24:03] it should be a testimony for all of us
[24:05] to actually bring someone to the lord
[24:07] because that's
[24:08] that's a that is the great commission
[24:11] and if it is that is one of the
[24:13] reflections of being wise and i want to
[24:15] pass that exam
[24:16] i want to fulfill every scripture every
[24:19] promise every
[24:20] everything any word that applies to me i
[24:22] want to accomplish it
[24:24] and believe you me it's not always easy
[24:26] it's tough
[24:27] time is being snatched by the news
[24:31] and by the newspaper and by different
[24:33] commitments and by
[24:34] traffic and all these things and it is
[24:36] becoming increasingly difficult
[24:39] to be able to navigate this world as a
[24:41] christian but at the same time
[24:43] this is where wisdom comes in this is
[24:45] where knowledge comes in
[24:47] this is where understanding comes in
[24:48] because the more complex things
[24:50] become it is more that wisdom
[24:53] shines out anybody with me tonight it is
[24:56] under crisis that equalities of
[24:59] knowledge
[25:00] wisdom and understanding are even more
[25:02] valuable if there is no pressure
[25:04] you can operate anyhow you know all
[25:06] right so i'm just saying i'm getting the
[25:08] scripture but
[25:08] i just feel into kind of have a
[25:10] conversation tonight if that's okay with
[25:11] you
[25:12] so i i saw a conversation recently at
[25:15] the beginning of this pandemic
[25:17] that was looking at businesses and it
[25:20] was saying that because of the pandemic
[25:22] a lot of businesses spent more of their
[25:25] time
[25:25] focusing on their internal issues than
[25:28] what the competition was doing
[25:30] because of the pressure they were forced
[25:33] to address the internal issues
[25:35] that they were facing they were forced
[25:37] to look at cost they were forced to look
[25:39] at their business model
[25:40] they were forced to look at the economic
[25:41] situation they were forced to look at
[25:43] the
[25:43] the industry analysis and the
[25:47] speaker who was bringing this out was
[25:49] saying
[25:50] the pressure brought a focus of
[25:52] introspection
[25:54] that when things are casual you have
[25:56] more time to look at what other people
[25:58] doing
[25:59] but under pressure you actually find
[26:01] yourself
[26:02] asking the question am i operating at my
[26:04] full potential
[26:06] am i selling everything i should be
[26:07] selling am i spending too much money
[26:10] and i want us tonight as we go into this
[26:13] journey
[26:14] for as long as the lord will allow us to
[26:15] venture tonight to really take a
[26:17] uh internal reflection of our lives let
[26:20] us check our inventory
[26:22] let us check what is our stock levels on
[26:25] on our level of understanding and i want
[26:28] to go a little deeper tonight
[26:30] so before we get into to say we don't
[26:32] know what we don't know
[26:34] i'll say it again you do not know what
[26:37] you do not know
[26:38] and and to bring an example uh
[26:41] i'm sure you have been in a situation
[26:43] where you heard something for the first
[26:44] time
[26:45] whenever you hear something for the
[26:46] first time you now come to a realization
[26:48] you know i never knew that but before
[26:51] that person pointed that out to you
[26:54] you didn't know he didn't know it you
[26:55] know it is
[26:57] only after you find out the thing you
[26:59] didn't know
[27:00] is when you realize you didn't know and
[27:02] that's a scary place to be
[27:04] so you find yourself as a parent there
[27:07] are things
[27:08] you don't know and it's not just that
[27:10] you don't know
[27:12] sometimes you didn't know that you
[27:13] didn't know
[27:15] it's one thing to say i don't know how
[27:17] to change the
[27:18] the i don't know how to fix the
[27:19] transmission on the car you i
[27:21] know personally i don't know the return
[27:23] mission
[27:24] but as i said next thing if i didn't
[27:27] know that there was something on the
[27:28] reach
[27:29] not knowing what you don't know is a big
[27:32] issue for us so
[27:33] let us get to the scripture tonight i
[27:35] don't know who that would help how it
[27:36] would encourage
[27:37] but just understand where i'm coming
[27:40] from tonight
[27:42] i believe in the practical application
[27:44] of the gospel
[27:46] i am not into super spiritual people who
[27:49] can live
[27:50] and navigate this world as a christian
[27:52] if god called us to live on a mountain
[27:54] and not talk to people that's one thing
[27:56] but that's not
[27:56] our reality the reality of our lives is
[27:59] we have to interact with
[28:00] family we have to interact with the
[28:02] public we have to interact with
[28:04] co-workers
[28:04] we have to interact with neighbors we
[28:06] have to interact with people who like us
[28:08] people who don't like us people who love
[28:10] us people who hate us
[28:12] and god has made it so wonderful that he
[28:15] has given us
[28:16] access to the tools to deal with every
[28:19] single situation
[28:20] as peter would say all things pertaining
[28:23] to life and
[28:24] godliness so all of that half past tense
[28:27] given to us so it's available to us and
[28:30] it's for us to put these things into use
[28:32] tonight
[28:33] so i want to start tonight uh because we
[28:35] would have introduced proverbs in our
[28:37] last teaching but i want to start from
[28:39] proverbs 1 and from verse 20 tonight
[28:43] and we'll just kind of take some aspects
[28:45] of it a bit slower than others
[28:47] and some uh we'll kind of kind of go a
[28:51] little faster tonight
[28:52] and i don't intend to take up too much
[28:54] of your time but i i want you to picture
[28:57] this young man named solomon
[29:01] you know and god using him as a voice to
[29:04] you tonight
[29:05] to encourage you all right so let's
[29:07] start with proverbs
[29:08] uh chapter 1 and verse 20.
[29:12] wisdom cry it without so the first thing
[29:15] we realize
[29:16] is that solomon personifies these things
[29:19] he doesn't speak about wisdom as a topic
[29:24] i want to be clear on this he doesn't
[29:25] introduce wisdom as an
[29:27] idea he speaks of wisdom as a person
[29:31] so we would say in in english or in
[29:33] descriptive that
[29:34] he personifies wisdom so he puts flesh
[29:37] on wisdom
[29:39] wisdom is this is this is this person
[29:41] almost that you could interact with so
[29:43] wisdom because it's the person can now
[29:45] have a voice
[29:46] so wisdom cries without and if you go to
[29:49] the amplified
[29:50] or the esv it will say this means wisdom
[29:53] cries
[29:54] with a loud voice or cries aloud in the
[29:57] street
[29:58] she utter it her voice in the street she
[30:01] cry it
[30:02] and the fact that it's crying and wants
[30:04] to pay attention is because wisdom
[30:06] as a person is trying to get people's
[30:08] attention
[30:09] in other words wisdom saying people not
[30:12] trying to be wise you know
[30:14] i want this to get this to get people
[30:16] attention people are living like
[30:18] robots people are not trying to
[30:22] get above their level so wisdom is
[30:24] trying to catch your attention
[30:26] trying to cut to say listen there is a
[30:28] better way
[30:30] there's a there's a perfect way because
[30:32] this is this is not man's wisdom we're
[30:34] talking about you know this is god's
[30:36] wisdom
[30:37] so wisdom is screaming trying to get
[30:39] your attention
[30:41] cries allowed in the street in the
[30:42] markets or we could say even in the
[30:44] business places she raises her voice all
[30:47] right
[30:48] verse 21 she cried in the chief
[30:52] place of concourse so that really means
[30:55] at the head of the noisy street she
[30:57] cries out
[30:59] in the openings of the gates that's like
[31:02] the in the entrance of the city
[31:04] she uttered her words so this is solomon
[31:07] painting
[31:08] wisdom in front of your house trying to
[31:10] get your attention
[31:11] wisdom on the highway trying to get your
[31:13] attention wisdom in city gate trying to
[31:16] get your attention
[31:16] wherever you go wisdom is saying to you
[31:19] there's a better way
[31:21] and listen to what he says look into
[31:23] what wisdom is saying
[31:24] how long ye simple ones
[31:27] will you love simplicity
[31:31] there are people who there are many
[31:34] scriptures that people misapply
[31:36] because they don't want to do work
[31:40] can i say that one more time there are
[31:42] many scriptures people apply because
[31:44] they don't want to do work
[31:48] so they take these scriptures that are
[31:50] convenient
[31:52] so there's a scripture that speaks about
[31:54] in and policy and
[31:55] all these things i was i'm content and
[31:58] they don't really hold context of paul's
[32:00] narrative
[32:01] and they say well i'm content so i want
[32:02] to study i want to work harder i don't
[32:05] want to do anything so they
[32:06] they they they take a piece of scripture
[32:08] to justify but
[32:09] but here is wisdom crying and saying how
[32:12] long
[32:13] these simple ones will he love
[32:15] simplicity
[32:17] in another translation it says how long
[32:19] or simple once will you love being
[32:21] simple
[32:22] now when i bring this from the scripture
[32:25] there are people who have criticized and
[32:27] say um
[32:29] i i want to live a simple life and
[32:31] brother is like trying to get people to
[32:32] become sophisticated i'm not speaking
[32:34] about becoming sophisticated no no
[32:36] i'm talking about there are three
[32:38] characters that are being described
[32:41] defined in the book of proverbs it is
[32:43] the wise
[32:44] it is the full and it is a simple
[32:47] you have to decide in your life in your
[32:50] marriage in your business and as a
[32:52] christian
[32:52] are you trying to be wise do you want to
[32:55] stay
[32:56] a fool or be a fool or do you want to be
[32:58] simple
[32:59] and let me just before continuing just
[33:01] kind of give a further definition
[33:03] so the wise if you read the description
[33:06] that is given of why is in the
[33:08] scriptural context
[33:09] is somebody who embraces god's covenant
[33:12] and learns the skill
[33:13] of living out the covenant in everyday
[33:16] situations
[33:18] to put it simply the wise character
[33:21] shows the skill
[33:22] in the art of godly living this is the
[33:26] person who continues to work hard
[33:28] at applying the grace of god the story
[33:32] of the gospel
[33:33] to everyday situations
[33:36] he is not yet perfect at it but over
[33:38] months and years
[33:39] he sees more and more how the promises
[33:42] of god
[33:42] apply to every square inch of his life
[33:46] that's that's the wise all right so
[33:49] even in my king james bible here
[33:52] the book of proverbs is introduced you
[33:54] know there's a little description before
[33:56] the book starts
[33:57] the key word in proverbs is wisdom the
[33:59] ability
[34:00] to live life skillfully
[34:03] a godly life in an ungodly world however
[34:07] is no
[34:07] simple assignment proverbs provides
[34:11] god's
[34:11] detailed instructions for his people to
[34:14] deal
[34:15] successfully with the practical affairs
[34:18] of everyday life
[34:19] how to relate to god parents
[34:22] children neighbors and government
[34:26] solomon the principal author uses a
[34:29] combination of poetry
[34:31] parables petey questions short stories
[34:34] and
[34:34] wise maxims to give in strikable
[34:38] memorable form the common sense and
[34:41] divine
[34:42] perspective necessary to handle
[34:45] life's issues and make no mistake about
[34:48] it
[34:49] there are issues of life that we all
[34:51] have to deal with
[34:53] they are decisions we have to make every
[34:55] day why not
[34:56] take counsel from the godly
[35:00] inspired wisest man who ever lived
[35:05] isn't that something people are trying
[35:07] to go to all kind of guru
[35:09] and self help people and all kind of
[35:10] thing and you have the wisdom
[35:12] that was only surpassed by jesus christ
[35:15] himself
[35:16] who was able to say are greater than
[35:18] solomon is here
[35:21] so we have access to the words of
[35:22] solomon and we have access to the words
[35:24] of the lord jesus christ
[35:26] who was the only one greater than
[35:27] solomon when it comes to wisdom
[35:29] anybody with me tonight what a place
[35:32] solomon
[35:33] solomon plays in scripture when jesus
[35:36] comparison of of greatness is is
[35:39] much against that of solomon so we are
[35:42] going through
[35:43] solomon's description for us because
[35:46] there has to come a time in your life
[35:48] when you realize simplicity cannot be
[35:51] the answer and you cannot keep doing
[35:52] foolishness
[35:55] it may sound cause it may sound rough
[35:57] but something we have to hear it
[35:59] that god expects more from us and he
[36:01] expects
[36:02] us to have knowledge and grow in
[36:04] knowledge
[36:05] he expects us to have understanding and
[36:07] he expects
[36:08] us to have wisdom there has to be a
[36:10] better way
[36:11] so let's go on we at verse 22 i
[36:14] reach anywhere yet
[36:17] how long his simple ones really love
[36:20] simplicity so he said
[36:22] simple people love simplicity you know
[36:29] and these corners delight in their
[36:32] scorning
[36:36] scorners exquall scuffers so you have
[36:38] people who
[36:39] coughing so for example you have people
[36:41] who going wrong
[36:42] painting this coronavirus is a fake
[36:45] they're painting on the wall
[36:46] they're laughing at virus some people
[36:47] say i wear no mask because this thing
[36:49] are real
[36:50] it's a conspiracy listen i have noticed
[36:52] confirmed no conspiracy by just defining
[36:54] what a scoffer is
[36:56] i'm just defining so you get a
[36:58] perspective of what solomon is referring
[37:00] to
[37:00] a scuffer or a scorner is somebody who
[37:03] seeing something happening
[37:04] and either don't believe it and mocking
[37:06] it scoring it's coughing laughing in it
[37:08] right
[37:09] scone is delight in their scorning and
[37:11] fools hate knowledge
[37:13] so so we begin to see
[37:16] a formation of the character of
[37:20] full wise and simple because one of the
[37:23] attributes of a fool is hate and
[37:25] knowledge
[37:27] now i remember preaching about this a
[37:28] while back i say listen i am not making
[37:30] this thing up
[37:32] you have to look at the scripture and
[37:34] realize if you hate knowledge
[37:36] if you don't want anybody to talk to you
[37:38] if you're not trying to learn
[37:40] you have to know from this who is being
[37:42] described because by the time
[37:43] solomon finishes proverbs he has
[37:46] perfectly described the fool
[37:48] he has perfectly described your eyes and
[37:50] he is perfectly defined and described
[37:52] simple let's go on
[37:56] turn you at my reproof this is verse 23
[38:00] all right behold
[38:03] i will pour out my spirit upon you so
[38:06] lucky brings his spirit in
[38:08] i will make known my words unto you turn
[38:10] you
[38:11] at my reproof means turn to my call
[38:14] meaning i'm trying to catch your
[38:15] attention
[38:16] so if you turn to my attention so wisdom
[38:19] this is wisdom speaking
[38:21] wisdom trying to catch your attention
[38:23] and wisdom sing if you want to be wise
[38:26] and if you respond to my call about
[38:28] wisdom i'm going to
[38:29] pour my spirit unto you and make known
[38:33] and make known is about knowledge making
[38:35] known so he will give
[38:37] or he will god will give you the
[38:39] knowledge
[38:40] of his words unto you and here's why
[38:44] here's why verse 24 because i have
[38:48] called
[38:48] and you refused you kind of wisdom now
[38:52] bringing it out here
[38:53] i have called and you have refused i
[38:56] have stretched out my hand
[38:58] and no man regarded so this is wisdom
[39:00] put it in a formal complete
[39:03] wisdom is saying i have called and he
[39:06] refused
[39:07] i have stretched my hand and no man
[39:10] regarded
[39:12] but he upset at not all my counsel in
[39:14] other words
[39:15] wisdom say i try to give you advice and
[39:18] your true my advice away
[39:20] and with none of my reproof would not
[39:23] let my reproof means
[39:24] you ignored what i'm saying
[39:29] i also so wisdom saying because
[39:33] you didn't respond to my hand to my
[39:35] gesture to my call to my advice
[39:38] i also will laugh at your calamity
[39:42] i will mock when your fear cometh when
[39:45] your fear cometh
[39:46] as desolation and your destruction
[39:49] commit as a whirlwind
[39:51] when distress and anguish commit upon
[39:53] you
[39:54] listen then shall they call upon me but
[39:57] i will not answer
[39:59] they shall seek me early which is
[40:02] scripture but they shall not find me
[40:06] for that they hated knowledge
[40:09] and did not choose the fear of the lord
[40:12] and the fear of the lord we know is the
[40:14] beginning of wisdom
[40:16] so i want us to understand now when you
[40:18] have to read these scriptures
[40:20] it makes you reassess how you spend your
[40:22] time it makes you weigh
[40:24] decisions differently because if wisdom
[40:26] according to the scripture is always
[40:28] there
[40:29] screaming saying there's a wise way
[40:32] but don't pass me don't pass man go and
[40:34] do your own thing
[40:35] in other words is a message about
[40:37] seeking wisdom
[40:38] and wisdom is trying to catch our
[40:40] attention i hope everybody seen that
[40:44] verse 30 they were with none of my
[40:46] counsel they despite all my reproof
[40:50] therefore and that's why i say there are
[40:52] consequences
[40:53] shall they eat of the fruit of their own
[40:56] way
[40:56] and be filled with their own devices in
[40:59] other words wisdom is saying
[41:00] if you ignore my advice if i try to get
[41:03] your attention
[41:04] if i try to to pull you from the wrong
[41:07] path that you go into
[41:08] then you have to live with your choices
[41:10] and this is why when you read the
[41:12] prophet's message and you read scripture
[41:14] there's so much to be said about getting
[41:16] good advice
[41:17] we tell people in marriage don't get
[41:19] into this thing unadvisedly
[41:21] we are saying to them
[41:27] get counsel check get advice make sure
[41:29] i'm praying
[41:30] talk to the pastor because listen
[41:32] because after you go on this road
[41:35] if you didn't talk to wisdom before you
[41:37] come up this road
[41:40] when wisdom was calling you when wisdom
[41:43] put on a hand to you
[41:47] you're making business decision and
[41:48] wisdom saying right now
[41:50] stop and talk to me before you continue
[41:52] now but you fly past wisdom
[41:54] and where some say but there he goes
[41:56] again there she goes again
[41:58] you come back and wisdom say hold on not
[42:01] i want to know but you
[42:02] pass under your own thing we talk about
[42:05] godly wisdom now we're talking about
[42:07] waiting on the lord
[42:09] we're talking about understanding that
[42:12] god's wisdom is available to us and he
[42:14] wants us to have it he's not trying to
[42:16] keep it from us you know
[42:19] i want to make it as clear as possible
[42:20] god not saying you have to do something
[42:23] no no he said wisdom is crying on the
[42:25] streets i want you to see a picture of
[42:26] it
[42:27] wisdom is not you hunting for wisdom
[42:31] wisdom is trying to come to you so when
[42:33] you make bad decisions is you actually
[42:35] ignoring wisdom
[42:38] can we push a little bit i don't know if
[42:41] anybody ever saw this like this before
[42:42] but
[42:43] i'm trying to put flesh on this thing
[42:45] flesh on wisdom
[42:46] flesh on understanding flesh and
[42:48] knowledge and for us to move
[42:50] from and and when you define it you have
[42:54] on one hand wise
[42:55] on the other hand is full and then
[42:57] simple is right in the middle
[42:59] let me just drop this true encouragement
[43:03] and clarity there
[43:04] so we talk about the why is already fool
[43:06] is the person
[43:07] steadily opposed to god's covenant he's
[43:09] the one who rejects forgiveness he is
[43:12] the one and we see he he
[43:13] ate knowledge the interesting one is the
[43:16] simple
[43:17] and i've found i can't put labels in
[43:20] anybody
[43:21] but this category of simple is is the
[43:23] category that we really comment against
[43:25] because
[43:26] i don't want to believe any fools are
[43:28] here tonight
[43:29] because fools hate knowledge fools
[43:32] wouldn't find themselves in a
[43:33] in a on a tuesday night when they have
[43:35] things to do
[43:37] fools ready no no no make the effort
[43:40] to to to be in a meeting like this
[43:43] that's not
[43:44] fools oppose god so i don't believe
[43:46] tonight i don't want to believe tonight
[43:48] that that there are foods in hiding and
[43:50] it's
[43:50] it doesn't they might already add up so
[43:52] so it is either we're speaking to the
[43:54] wise who who want to become wiser and
[43:56] those who are turning to wisdom
[43:58] or we're addressing the the simple and
[44:01] let me kind of put definition to these
[44:02] simple before we continue tonight
[44:05] the simple is described in proverbs as
[44:08] one not firmly committed to wisdom or
[44:11] foolishness
[44:12] lord help us today so the simple
[44:16] not committed to wisdom or foolishness
[44:19] or for anything that matters he is
[44:22] easily misled
[44:24] he easily falls into believing the
[44:27] majority opinion of the crowd
[44:29] he can be religious when surrounded by
[44:32] religious people
[44:33] he could be sinful when surrounded by
[44:35] sinners he can be lazy
[44:37] when surrounded by slackers he is not
[44:40] actively opposed to god
[44:42] but he really doesn't care that much
[44:43] either the simple is not
[44:46] as far gone as the fool but he tends to
[44:49] be the guy
[44:50] when in the presence of wise teaching
[44:52] remains unaffected
[44:54] it whistles right through his head now i
[44:57] am
[44:58] reading from a theologian who wrote
[45:02] hallelujah so
[45:07] i hope you're being blessed tonight i i
[45:09] i i
[45:11] i don't know when last year i had a
[45:13] conversation about wise the fools
[45:15] and the simple but i want us to to kind
[45:17] of understand that we're trying to go
[45:19] somewhere we are not mind you i'm not
[45:22] talking about education
[45:24] i'm not talking about a degree i'm not
[45:25] talking about mathematics
[45:27] i'm not talking about science i'm
[45:29] talking about godly knowledge
[45:31] godly wisdom and godly understanding
[45:34] with the recognition that god has a
[45:38] source of the knowledge that you need
[45:40] for every situation that you ever have
[45:42] to encounter
[45:44] he has what he has the knowledge and he
[45:46] wants to make it available to you
[45:48] the understanding to to understand how
[45:51] to speak to people
[45:52] to understand how to talk to your wife
[45:54] when when there are five ways to talk to
[45:56] her you know
[45:57] you might know what the problem is
[45:59] you're trying to address but do you have
[46:00] the understanding
[46:02] of of of how to say it do you have the
[46:05] wisdom to put it across in the in the
[46:08] right way
[46:08] so that when you're you're finished say
[46:10] it that that that
[46:12] that that your point actually went up in
[46:15] and your point didn't go down anybody
[46:17] with me tonight
[46:18] are trying to make this thing as
[46:20] tangible for us as possible
[46:22] because i'm dealing with the realities
[46:24] of life
[46:26] friends people come to church on sundays
[46:30] driving the car not talking to one
[46:31] another you know
[46:34] that is not doctrine that is a failure
[46:37] of
[46:38] knowledge wisdom and understanding
[46:42] people could be on the job co-workers
[46:46] you spend a significant amount of your
[46:48] time in your workplace
[46:50] you need wisdom you need understanding
[46:54] it makes no sense you live your life
[46:56] with that stress
[46:57] you need to get wisdom and understanding
[46:59] to reduce your stress
[47:01] you have to have wisdom to know what to
[47:03] even include on your list
[47:04] of things to even stress about and i
[47:06] could go deeper into why i shouldn't
[47:07] have a list
[47:08] at all but even if you have to think
[47:10] about something you have to have any
[47:11] wisdom to know what to put on that list
[47:13] anybody with me tonight i know this is
[47:16] not a
[47:17] bible story we into tonight this is not
[47:19] a character in the book of kings
[47:21] but this is we deal with the issues of
[47:23] life
[47:24] and emerging tomorrow with fresh
[47:27] perspective a fresh authority
[47:30] with understanding what god has for you
[47:33] what he called you for
[47:34] and most importantly called you to do
[47:37] all right
[47:38] so we have verse 31 the rate i'm going i
[47:42] will not reach my destination
[47:44] i have enough understanding to realize
[47:46] that at the rate that i'm going i will
[47:48] not reach my destination tonight
[47:52] so we at verse 31 this is the
[47:54] consequence
[47:55] of when wisdom screaming and crying you
[47:58] choose to ignore wisdom
[48:00] do you know there's somebody tonight
[48:02] we'll ignore words said tonight
[48:04] and there's someone in his room tonight
[48:06] will take this to heart
[48:08] and reflect on how they can become a
[48:10] better christian
[48:11] a better son a better daughter a better
[48:12] husband a better wife may that be you
[48:15] tonight my friend
[48:16] therefore verse 31 shall they eat of the
[48:19] fruit
[48:20] of their own way and be filled with
[48:22] their own devices for the turning away
[48:24] of the simple
[48:25] shall slay them i want you to catch that
[48:29] so the simple the turning away is
[48:32] is almost ignoring and the prosperity of
[48:35] fools
[48:36] shall destroy them the prosperity of
[48:40] fools
[48:41] is their destruction
[48:44] but who so hacking it unto me shall
[48:48] dwell safely
[48:49] and shall be quiet from fear of evil
[48:53] and i felt this is powerful because as a
[48:55] believer
[48:56] as a son as a christian you are supposed
[48:59] to sleep good at night
[49:02] you shouldn't have to worry about fear
[49:04] and evil you still have to
[49:06] worry about about this and that and have
[49:08] that stress because you have
[49:09] confidence in how you live confidence on
[49:12] the source of your strength
[49:14] confidence that if you haven't seen
[49:15] something yet it doesn't mean that the
[49:17] solution is not there
[49:19] it just means you need to go to god and
[49:21] say lord give me the wisdom
[49:23] give me the knowledge give me the
[49:24] understanding of how to resolve this
[49:27] situation
[49:27] how to approach this situation how to
[49:30] make the next step
[49:31] anybody with me tonight
[49:35] chapter 2 my son
[49:38] if thou wilt receive my words and
[49:41] hide my commandments with me
[49:46] so that thou inclined an air unto wisdom
[49:50] this is what we're doing tonight we are
[49:51] inclining our ear
[49:53] to wisdom and apply thine heart to
[49:56] understanding
[49:58] when you hear somebody say their heart
[50:00] into it
[50:02] your heart into something is more than
[50:03] your mind being into it
[50:06] there are people who come to church and
[50:07] they head in into them but they have not
[50:09] in it
[50:10] you see the difference there you see the
[50:13] the distinction and
[50:14] and why solomon is placing things a
[50:16] certain way all right
[50:18] so that though incline the air unto
[50:20] wisdom you're listening for it and
[50:22] applied and heart understanding
[50:23] and many times through proverbs you'll
[50:25] see him begin to interchange
[50:27] because he's pressing the buttons to
[50:29] make sure
[50:30] you understand what he's pushing for
[50:32] yeah if thou
[50:34] criest after knowledge and lifted
[50:37] up thy voice for understanding
[50:41] you have to understand your role in god
[50:45] you have to understand your role as a
[50:47] christian you have to
[50:48] understand your role as a husband as a
[50:50] son as a daughter
[50:53] if you don't understand your role if you
[50:55] don't understand it you will
[50:57] end up into failure so if you don't
[50:59] understand he say listen
[51:00] listen lift up your voice for
[51:02] understanding
[51:05] if thou seek is her listen verse four
[51:08] are silver
[51:09] in other words you're out there trying
[51:10] to make money but you're not seeking
[51:12] knowledge you're not seeking
[51:13] understanding you're not seeking wisdom
[51:14] so he's giving you a comparison
[51:17] if you take the same effort you're
[51:19] trying to give towards making money
[51:20] if thou seeks her as silver and searches
[51:24] for her
[51:24] as for hid treasures then thou
[51:28] then shall understand the fear of the
[51:30] lord and
[51:31] finding knowledge of god now can i dig
[51:35] all of it yeah people listen you don't
[51:38] need to wake them up to go to work or
[51:39] not
[51:42] you don't need to wake them up because
[51:43] they need that money they gain up
[51:47] but to get them to come to a prayer
[51:49] meeting you have to wind up you have to
[51:51] start to wind up
[51:52] days in advance because the tenacity and
[51:56] the drive
[51:57] and the enthusiasm for the prayer
[52:00] meeting
[52:00] or for the wisdom of god huh
[52:05] they don't have it but they say they
[52:07] want to go into the rapture or they want
[52:09] to make it
[52:10] or they and they don't understand what
[52:12] is really valuable
[52:14] and we'll dig into it god wants you to
[52:15] be blessed financially he wants you to
[52:17] be blessed and healthy whatever
[52:18] but there's an approach to god and if
[52:21] you are under the covenant of god
[52:22] there's only his approach is the
[52:24] approach
[52:26] because he said he fool his prosperity
[52:28] is his destruction
[52:29] so you have fools who will make money
[52:31] and that is their destruction
[52:33] but you are on that different covenant
[52:35] so you can't operate like the fool or
[52:36] the simple
[52:37] you need to operate with wisdom
[52:41] chapter 2 verse 5 then shall thou
[52:44] understand the fear of the lord
[52:46] and find the knowledge of god for the
[52:48] lord listen
[52:49] give it wisdom so it's not something you
[52:52] need to buy
[52:53] he giveth the wisdom earlier on he say
[52:56] wisdom crying to get your attention
[52:58] now he's saying he given the wisdom so
[53:00] if you don't have it why you don't have
[53:02] it
[53:05] okay for the lord give it wisdom out of
[53:08] his mouth commit knowledge and
[53:10] understanding
[53:11] i'm praying that tonight that's why you
[53:13] heard something that that pushes you to
[53:15] a deeper level of
[53:17] understanding or knowledge or you're
[53:19] you're you're getting some wisdom out of
[53:20] this to even go back into these things
[53:22] and
[53:22] go back to the word go back to the
[53:24] prophet message sit down and analyze
[53:26] your life
[53:27] meditate on this word day and night and
[53:29] and and see listen tomorrow i want it
[53:31] better than today
[53:32] maybe i didn't operate at my best
[53:34] capacity today how can i be better
[53:36] tomorrow
[53:37] how much effort did i make in prayer did
[53:40] i did i get an
[53:41] art or a grudge that i that is that is
[53:44] how you live right
[53:45] amen let's continue
[53:50] verse seven chapter two verse seven he
[53:53] lay it up sound wisdom for the righteous
[53:55] so so solomon is now going into into
[53:58] god's role in this thing right he said
[54:00] from verse 5 then shallow understand the
[54:03] fear of the lord and find the knowledge
[54:04] of god
[54:05] for the lord verse 6 give it wisdom out
[54:07] of his mouth commit knowledge
[54:08] and understanding he's pushing he lay it
[54:11] up sound wisdom
[54:12] for the righteous he is a buckler to
[54:14] them that walk
[54:15] uprightly can the church say amen he
[54:18] keeping the path of judgment
[54:20] and preserving the way of his sins then
[54:24] shall thou understand righteousness and
[54:26] judgment
[54:27] and equity ye every good path isn't this
[54:30] don't you want this to be your testimony
[54:32] don't you want to be a beneficiary of
[54:34] this
[54:36] when wisdom enter it into thine heart
[54:38] and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul
[54:41] the sentence is not ending there
[54:43] discretion shall preserve thee
[54:46] understanding shall keep thee
[54:49] you see what keeping me truth this
[54:51] pandemic
[54:53] discretion shall preserve thee
[54:56] understanding shall keep thee
[55:01] to deliver listen verse 12 be from the
[55:04] way of the evil man
[55:06] the evil man has his way if you spend
[55:08] too much time watching the news and this
[55:10] and all these things happen and who are
[55:11] invasions and all these different things
[55:14] god is saying listen when you follow my
[55:16] statutes all of this stuff puts you in a
[55:18] position
[55:19] to keep you from these things to deliver
[55:21] thee from the way of the evil man
[55:23] from the man that speaketh forward
[55:26] things anybody with me tonight
[55:29] who leave the paths of uprightness to
[55:32] walk in the ways of darkness
[55:34] who rejoice to do evil this is what he's
[55:35] keeping you from and the light and the
[55:38] frowitness of the wicked
[55:39] whose ways are crooked and they frowned
[55:42] in their parts
[55:43] to deliver thee from the strange woman
[55:46] even the stranger
[55:47] which flutter it with her words
[55:51] which forsaken the guide of her youth
[55:54] and forgetted the covenant of her god
[55:57] for her house inclined it unto death
[56:00] and her parts unto the dead
[56:04] none that go unto her return again
[56:07] neither take their whole of the parts of
[56:09] life
[56:11] this is a whole message a whole sermon
[56:15] when you find out how people end up in
[56:16] the trouble what how much stop signs you
[56:19] run to end up in this position
[56:23] anybody with me tonight
[56:26] let us see your scripture you know none
[56:28] that go under her return again
[56:31] there are a one-way street
[56:36] okay down the street you can't come out
[56:38] be careful friends
[56:40] tonight get knowledge get understanding
[56:42] get wisdom understand the
[56:44] red lights whatever i'm saying god don't
[56:47] send anybody to hell on them
[56:48] he said you run all the red lights
[56:52] anybody remember that quote you say you
[56:54] run the red light
[56:55] god is screaming trying to stop you from
[56:56] doing foolishness
[57:01] that thou mayest walk in the way of good
[57:03] men verse 20 and keep the path of the
[57:05] righteous
[57:06] for the upright shall dwell in the land
[57:08] and perfect
[57:09] shall remain in it
[57:13] but the wicked shall be cut off from the
[57:15] earth and the transgression shall be
[57:17] rooted
[57:17] out of it let's keep going chapter three
[57:22] my son forget not my law
[57:26] sometimes we read that and we read it
[57:29] but how do people
[57:33] not forget things if you want to
[57:36] remember something
[57:37] so i want you to think if you have an
[57:39] exam
[57:40] what is your approach to remember
[57:42] something if you have something to do in
[57:44] work
[57:45] and you need to remember it if you have
[57:47] a password into your email
[57:49] and you need to remember it what do you
[57:51] do
[57:53] some people use a sticky note some
[57:56] people
[57:57] sit on and regurgitate it repeat it
[57:59] until they remember it and we'll have
[58:01] our notepads and we'll use our mobile
[58:02] device
[58:04] so people have found over time ways
[58:07] to try to remember or keep at hand
[58:10] things that are important to them so i
[58:13] want us to
[58:14] understand now that my son forget
[58:17] not my law means this must be so
[58:20] important to you
[58:22] that the law of god the word of god the
[58:25] things of god
[58:26] must be so easily accessible to you more
[58:29] than that it must be
[58:30] ingrained in you that it is not
[58:32] something that you could forget
[58:35] and if there is a command this is
[58:37] something that pushes us now to really
[58:38] kind of reassess
[58:40] because and i've shared it multiple
[58:42] times about things that i can remember
[58:44] from primary school
[58:45] that i drill and drill and drill till to
[58:46] this day i can't take it out my head
[58:48] i can't forget it no you can't remember
[58:51] everything in life but
[58:52] it's a focus here towards how much
[58:55] diligence
[58:56] attention and care you place to
[58:58] remembering the law of god
[59:00] and not forgetting his things all right
[59:04] my son forget not my law but
[59:07] let thine heart keep my commandments
[59:11] and it's not descendant is not complete
[59:13] there's a there's a call on there which
[59:14] means this is this is going on now
[59:16] there's a consequence of this for length
[59:19] of days
[59:20] so this is long life and long life
[59:23] lengthening and long life and peace
[59:25] shall they add to thee
[59:27] so automatically when you
[59:30] forget not the law and you keep his
[59:33] commandments
[59:34] you actually extending your life you
[59:37] know
[59:37] that's what the scripture is saying that
[59:40] is how god
[59:40] how much value he places on his word
[59:43] that's how much
[59:44] value he placed in his word you could
[59:46] extend
[59:47] you talk about you want the extension
[59:50] focus on his learner
[59:51] you want you want length of days and
[59:53] long life and not just that and peace
[59:55] because you don't want a long life and
[59:57] stress you know people living long and
[59:59] stressed out the grumpy grumpy grumpy he
[1:00:01] is saying that here
[1:00:02] you say length of days and long life and
[1:00:05] peace
[1:00:06] shall they add to thee
[1:00:09] all right let's go on verse 3
[1:00:12] left not mercy and truth forsake thee
[1:00:16] bind them about thy neck write them
[1:00:19] upon the table of thine heart mercy
[1:00:22] and truth mercy and truth
[1:00:26] so your value truth and you also value
[1:00:28] mercy
[1:00:29] because that's how god is how could he
[1:00:32] be a christian and
[1:00:33] you do have no mercy it might sound
[1:00:37] simple callous but god will test you on
[1:00:39] these things you know
[1:00:42] you are you are you are merciless
[1:00:44] christian really
[1:00:48] nobody can ever get a second time you
[1:00:50] are you are one chance christian
[1:00:51] you know much chance god gave you and
[1:00:55] and you have no mercy your wife burned
[1:00:58] the food and
[1:00:58] for days she hear about it
[1:01:02] no mercy is any simple things you know
[1:01:08] you have to realize friends every action
[1:01:10] you take could either escalate or
[1:01:11] de-escalate situations
[1:01:16] that's in your marriage in your business
[1:01:18] in your job
[1:01:19] every action every word every emotion
[1:01:23] and sometimes it's simple enough because
[1:01:24] sometimes we say a word but our body
[1:01:26] language saying something else you know
[1:01:28] you say ah sorry but you know that
[1:01:30] wasn't necessary that wasn't
[1:01:32] sorry and you're watching this and you
[1:01:34] see any smoke you see anybody language
[1:01:36] it's not lining up
[1:01:40] all right verse 4 social
[1:01:44] so shall thou find favor and good
[1:01:46] understanding in this
[1:01:48] in the sight of god and man so there's
[1:01:50] such a thing
[1:01:51] as finding favor and good understanding
[1:01:55] in sight of both god and man that's a
[1:01:57] powerful place in
[1:01:58] you know where because you keep the law
[1:02:01] of god a certain way
[1:02:02] you find favor with both god and man oh
[1:02:05] that's powerful
[1:02:06] verse five trust in the lord with all
[1:02:10] thine heart
[1:02:11] and lean not unto thine own
[1:02:13] understanding so again
[1:02:15] i would have said earlier we're not
[1:02:17] talking about
[1:02:18] your knowledge your wisdom your
[1:02:20] understanding we're talking about
[1:02:22] us coming to an appreciation of god's
[1:02:24] understanding
[1:02:25] and god's knowledge and god's wisdom so
[1:02:27] he is now further
[1:02:29] clarifying and making it clear to you
[1:02:31] trust in the law with all that heart and
[1:02:33] lean not unto dying own understanding
[1:02:35] because you don't understand everything
[1:02:39] so you have to get his understanding on
[1:02:41] the matter
[1:02:42] you only understand so much right now
[1:02:45] but
[1:02:45] you look now at your life 20 years ago
[1:02:48] for those who could
[1:02:48] rewind that much 30 years ago for those
[1:02:51] who could remind remind that much
[1:02:52] 40 years ago for those who rewind that
[1:02:54] much what you understand now
[1:02:56] is very different to what you understood
[1:02:58] 40 years ago
[1:03:00] so the comparison that you can make with
[1:03:02] what you understood at
[1:03:03] 20 years old and at 60 years old imagine
[1:03:06] the gap
[1:03:07] between your understanding at six years
[1:03:09] old and causing understanding
[1:03:11] anybody with me tonight all right in all
[1:03:15] thy ways acknowledge him
[1:03:16] and he shall direct thy parts i think i
[1:03:18] mentioned this and i referenced in the
[1:03:20] last teaching
[1:03:21] that everything is about the lord
[1:03:25] your success is because of the lord yes
[1:03:28] you study hard and you work hard and you
[1:03:29] put in the hours
[1:03:30] but if the lord didn't give you the
[1:03:32] strength to work hard and put in hours
[1:03:33] you wouldn't be able to do it so it's
[1:03:35] not your it's not ever your ability
[1:03:37] i want to make that point you say when i
[1:03:38] work hard and i study late at night
[1:03:41] so if god didn't allow it to to not be
[1:03:43] able to be up at night now
[1:03:44] what they want to study the things you
[1:03:47] wanted their credit for
[1:03:48] you can't take credit for nothing i want
[1:03:50] to make that point very clear
[1:03:52] there is nothing we could take credit
[1:03:54] for
[1:03:56] will i really study i have a degree i
[1:03:58] you know i push
[1:04:00] and i walk to work and i had no money to
[1:04:02] go and i real sacrifice
[1:04:03] and i didn't do whatever you're talking
[1:04:06] that whole sentence
[1:04:07] i can show you god and everyone
[1:04:11] i don't mind to go to school i walk to
[1:04:13] school what happened if you had no foot
[1:04:14] now
[1:04:14] are you going to work out
[1:04:19] well i went to school and i got done
[1:04:21] kind of
[1:04:22] where you get from if you load in a lot
[1:04:24] of canon cat you
[1:04:27] and they can find every single situation
[1:04:29] that you want to be credit for
[1:04:30] god is responsible so in all thy ways
[1:04:34] acknowledge him
[1:04:35] most of us do not put acknowledging god
[1:04:38] as part of our daily statement our daily
[1:04:41] life
[1:04:43] somebody message me just this week and
[1:04:45] say i'm so impressed with something i
[1:04:46] did
[1:04:47] i say all the glory to god i don't care
[1:04:49] if he's a christian a non-christian what
[1:04:50] they believe
[1:04:51] i i am telling you where my strength is
[1:04:53] coming from
[1:04:55] i tell you what bank i am withdrawing
[1:04:57] from if the bank up in the sky
[1:05:00] if you're blessing what i say it's not
[1:05:01] my ability
[1:05:03] this is not my knowledge i'm not
[1:05:04] speaking for my knowledge here
[1:05:06] i'm tapping into a source where this
[1:05:08] thing comes from
[1:05:09] i want to get in mind of the order of
[1:05:11] this thing because he could bring it out
[1:05:13] better
[1:05:14] than i could ever could anybody would be
[1:05:16] tonight
[1:05:17] in all thy ways not some
[1:05:20] not some of your ways we take credit for
[1:05:23] things we are not
[1:05:24] we did not do it
[1:05:28] i wanted to to get that point in all thy
[1:05:31] ways
[1:05:32] when lies did you acknowledge god in
[1:05:34] what you do
[1:05:35] you think you can cook no you can't cook
[1:05:40] acknowledge the lord everything i want
[1:05:42] us to
[1:05:43] bring it simple to us to understand
[1:05:46] these skills you have it's because of
[1:05:47] the lord
[1:05:48] give him the credit and watch him bless
[1:05:50] you with more come on now
[1:05:53] whatever skill that you think you have
[1:05:55] whatever ability whatever you do
[1:05:57] acknowledge him as his source and see
[1:05:59] him because he loves that he's a jealous
[1:06:01] god
[1:06:03] and the more you you left him higher the
[1:06:06] more you rise
[1:06:07] because that's how he is anybody with me
[1:06:11] tonight nailing it down in all thy ways
[1:06:14] acknowledge him
[1:06:15] and he shall direct thy parts so he's
[1:06:17] saying in acknowledging me now i'm going
[1:06:19] to tell you what to do next
[1:06:20] because i like the fact that you're
[1:06:22] putting me in my place i like the fact
[1:06:23] that you're putting me first i like the
[1:06:25] fact that so i'm going to tell you make
[1:06:26] that move next
[1:06:27] make that move next and you keep saying
[1:06:28] is the lord is he lord is he lord
[1:06:30] i thank the lord if it wasn't for the
[1:06:32] lord who was at my side and as you live
[1:06:34] that way he said
[1:06:35] next step is here go here and your
[1:06:38] competition they don't know how you
[1:06:39] navigate in this world they don't know
[1:06:41] how you know where to be
[1:06:42] what to do how to go how to speak
[1:06:45] anybody with me
[1:06:46] tonight be not wise
[1:06:49] in their own eyes who is seven
[1:06:53] so he is now digging into this
[1:06:55] understanding issue let me say be not
[1:06:57] wise in your own eyes well that's a
[1:06:58] scary one
[1:07:00] the people who sit down and they come to
[1:07:02] the conclusion after they analyze the
[1:07:03] situation that they're actually wise
[1:07:07] when you mark your own papers and come
[1:07:09] to the conclusion that you
[1:07:10] wise you say well you know
[1:07:14] i made a really wise decision you see
[1:07:16] where you talk so
[1:07:17] and you mark your own papers solomon
[1:07:20] said
[1:07:20] that is not what i want to know
[1:07:24] be not wise in their own eyes fear the
[1:07:27] lord
[1:07:28] so look how we connect you being wise so
[1:07:31] he's saying you making that statement
[1:07:33] you need to to actually have fear of the
[1:07:35] lord because
[1:07:36] fear of the lord you can't talk so fear
[1:07:38] the lord and depart from evil
[1:07:41] it shall be held to thy navel and marrow
[1:07:44] to thy bones
[1:07:45] anybody with me tonight what are we
[1:07:48] doing for time
[1:07:49] who's track of all right we might we
[1:07:53] might we might reach
[1:07:54] not much full destination but close all
[1:07:56] right
[1:07:57] honor the lord with thy substance and
[1:08:00] with the first fruits
[1:08:02] of all that and increase well this year
[1:08:04] is direct to those who
[1:08:05] don't want to pay tithes and they don't
[1:08:07] want to put god first and there's a
[1:08:10] whole teaching by itself if you don't
[1:08:11] understand the principle of this thing
[1:08:13] you you negate verse 10 this is not
[1:08:17] about punishment
[1:08:18] this is about honor the lord with thy
[1:08:20] substance
[1:08:21] and with the first fruits of all thine
[1:08:24] increase
[1:08:25] listen to why verse 10 so shall thy
[1:08:28] bands be filled with plenty
[1:08:30] and thy presses shall burst out with new
[1:08:32] wine
[1:08:33] so if that is important to you then you
[1:08:35] will do verse 9.
[1:08:38] that's scripture this shouldn't take
[1:08:41] explanation but we're dealing with why
[1:08:43] is we dealing with fool we dealing with
[1:08:44] simple
[1:08:45] you have to understand how god places
[1:08:47] this law he said put me first
[1:08:49] in your heart put me first in your mind
[1:08:52] put me first with your substance
[1:08:54] in all your ways acknowledge me and
[1:08:55] watch me bless you
[1:08:59] verse 11 my son despise not the
[1:09:03] chastening of the lord
[1:09:05] neither be wary of his con of his
[1:09:07] correction
[1:09:08] where he is tired of his correction so
[1:09:10] god is saying don't ever get tired
[1:09:12] of coming to a church service don't ever
[1:09:13] get tired or commit a meeting
[1:09:15] and hear anything that you need to fix
[1:09:16] in your life don't get exhausted about
[1:09:19] it
[1:09:20] don't feel aware about it we are coming
[1:09:22] here to be edified i am reading this and
[1:09:24] i'm looking
[1:09:25] at the word of my life and i want to
[1:09:27] compare with isn't it
[1:09:28] i am trying to see lord am i living up
[1:09:31] to every single
[1:09:32] verse because the prophet taught us if
[1:09:34] you don't see jesus
[1:09:35] in every verse read it again in other
[1:09:38] words
[1:09:38] see the strength in every single verse
[1:09:41] of scripture most of us
[1:09:42] don't invest the time to go through
[1:09:44] these things
[1:09:45] and look at our lives and slow down and
[1:09:48] i turn god
[1:09:49] through this experience we have been
[1:09:50] able to come together like this and say
[1:09:52] oh wow
[1:09:53] i didn't really see it so i didn't
[1:09:54] really process it so i know two little
[1:09:56] verses yet a little verse yeah but this
[1:09:58] is much more than that
[1:09:59] this is about me growing to be a son
[1:10:02] that he could say this is my beloved son
[1:10:04] in whom i'm well pleased he has
[1:10:06] understanding he has
[1:10:07] knowledge he has wisdom but ibrahim said
[1:10:09] he could sign the father's check
[1:10:11] he could run the business you can run
[1:10:13] the business if you don't know you can't
[1:10:14] run
[1:10:15] just if you don't understand he
[1:10:16] currently business if you have wisdom
[1:10:19] anybody with me how can god give you
[1:10:21] power in his kingdom
[1:10:23] how he lay things out and you coming out
[1:10:25] there where i know
[1:10:26] i know i understand i know i that is not
[1:10:30] that's
[1:10:30] not this thing anybody with me
[1:10:34] my son despise not the chastening of the
[1:10:37] lord
[1:10:38] neither be wary of his correction so
[1:10:40] this speaks about your attitude
[1:10:42] your attitude to being corrected
[1:10:45] your attitude to being chastened and
[1:10:48] chasing is not
[1:10:49] punishment chasing in this context is
[1:10:51] not already punishment
[1:10:52] it's it's get back in line
[1:10:55] get back in line get back in step
[1:10:59] you're not where you're supposed to be
[1:11:00] you could do better
[1:11:02] and and you know whenever somebody said
[1:11:04] you could do better you know in your
[1:11:05] heart is it true to know
[1:11:08] if i come tonight and say everything is
[1:11:10] good with you everything is good with
[1:11:12] you you have to do nothing
[1:11:13] why are you coming but when they come in
[1:11:16] here listen
[1:11:17] i need a little more seating
[1:11:20] that mercy thing i need to put a little
[1:11:23] more a little more focus
[1:11:25] on that because you're being encouraged
[1:11:27] now to dig a little deeper
[1:11:28] to go a little higher you know anybody
[1:11:30] with me
[1:11:37] let's go
[1:11:41] for whom the lord loveth verse 12 he
[1:11:43] corrected
[1:11:44] even as a father the son in whom he
[1:11:47] delighted
[1:11:48] so he's saying a good father delight in
[1:11:51] correcting a son who could do better
[1:11:55] who could improve because god is about
[1:11:57] improvement
[1:11:58] this gospel and this is the challenge i
[1:12:00] have with people saying i've been in a
[1:12:02] message for 20 years and your behavior
[1:12:04] is the same as it was 20 years ago
[1:12:08] you have no improvement
[1:12:15] verse 13 happy is the man
[1:12:18] that find it wisdom and the man that get
[1:12:21] it understanding
[1:12:22] so as as this as all the pieces begin to
[1:12:25] connect in your life
[1:12:27] there's a happiness that comes did you
[1:12:29] ever think of it
[1:12:30] there's a happiness that comes a happy
[1:12:33] is the man
[1:12:34] that find it wisdom and the man that get
[1:12:37] it understanding
[1:12:38] there's a happiness what's what have you
[1:12:41] been happy about lately
[1:12:44] because this is a reason to be happy you
[1:12:45] know i i
[1:12:47] i when i said i already think about it i
[1:12:49] wish i could swallow i could spend a
[1:12:50] whole hour yesterday's one verse
[1:12:52] happy is the man that find it wisdom
[1:12:55] when god say happy happy you know like
[1:12:58] you don't know happiness
[1:13:00] like you say you don't know what i don't
[1:13:01] know you know this happens here you
[1:13:03] ain't notice happiness
[1:13:04] if you understand this thing enough you
[1:13:06] are limited
[1:13:07] you are not one percent happy and god is
[1:13:09] saying the happiness i talk about if you
[1:13:11] understand how happy you will be
[1:13:12] when you find this thing called wisdom
[1:13:15] and the man that gets understanding if
[1:13:17] you understand why
[1:13:18] god take you through your experience and
[1:13:19] you understand why he put you in the
[1:13:21] house
[1:13:21] you're in and why he put you in your
[1:13:23] family and why you went to that school
[1:13:25] you went to if you could ever
[1:13:26] understand why he he didn't let this
[1:13:29] thing work out
[1:13:30] because he really knew that he went down
[1:13:32] that road you would have never come to
[1:13:33] know him
[1:13:34] if you really understand that that that
[1:13:37] that your
[1:13:37] your first choice school that you wanted
[1:13:39] to get you didn't get it because he
[1:13:41] really wanted you to go down a different
[1:13:43] path to come to know him a certain way
[1:13:45] when he really understand the things
[1:13:46] that you're disappointed about
[1:13:48] was really for your betterment that if
[1:13:50] you didn't get that disappointment it
[1:13:52] wouldn't have driven you to where you're
[1:13:54] at today to be in this room
[1:13:55] oh my how happy you become when you get
[1:13:58] a deeper understanding
[1:14:00] of how you didn't find the message but
[1:14:02] the message had to find you
[1:14:03] but what you didn't know was was your
[1:14:06] journey and your child and your
[1:14:07] experience
[1:14:08] if you only understood then what you
[1:14:10] understand no oh you would have been
[1:14:12] happier then
[1:14:12] but you can be happy now and i could go
[1:14:16] on and on
[1:14:17] about looking at it another way tonight
[1:14:20] how happy
[1:14:21] happy is the man that find it wisdom and
[1:14:24] the man that gets it understanding
[1:14:27] verse 14 for the merchandise of it
[1:14:30] is better than the merchandise of silver
[1:14:33] and the gain or the profit thereof than
[1:14:36] fine gold
[1:14:37] so so there's there's a profit there's a
[1:14:39] value to this
[1:14:41] understanding there's a value to this
[1:14:43] wisdom
[1:14:44] that is better there's more profit in
[1:14:46] what we doing tonight oh gosh
[1:14:48] if you can catch this there is more
[1:14:50] profit in what happened right now
[1:14:52] than the time you can spend in your
[1:14:54] business
[1:14:56] and the prophet of this meeting will
[1:14:58] have an impact on your business
[1:15:00] how god is so good that the more time
[1:15:02] you spend with him
[1:15:03] is the more results you have in your
[1:15:04] life oh help us tonight

[1:17:11] this thing is always like this thing
[1:17:13] again better and better is that
[1:17:14] is that your experience she is a tree of
[1:17:17] life
[1:17:18] to them that lay hold upon her and happy
[1:17:21] is
[1:17:21] everyone that repeated her isn't this
[1:17:25] your desire tonight
[1:17:27] isn't this the experience you want to
[1:17:28] have is this not the approach
[1:17:30] is this how you want to live every
[1:17:31] single day of your life
[1:17:36] the lord by wisdom have founded the
[1:17:39] earth
[1:17:39] so so now solomon is bringing into
[1:17:42] context the practicality of the
[1:17:44] application of these three things we're
[1:17:46] talking about
[1:17:47] knowledge understanding and wisdom so he
[1:17:48] said if you want to understand
[1:17:50] how this thing is applied in a display
[1:17:54] way
[1:17:54] in a demonstrative way how these things
[1:17:57] could be used
[1:17:58] in other words he said in verse 19 the
[1:18:01] lord
[1:18:02] by wisdom have founded the earth
[1:18:05] by understanding that he established the
[1:18:08] heavens
[1:18:08] by his knowledge the depths are broken
[1:18:11] up and the clouds drop down the view
[1:18:13] so you're saying it was these three
[1:18:15] things at work
[1:18:17] to see oh my i don't know if you i
[1:18:20] i think i have my own services
[1:18:25] so then solomon brings it back to you
[1:18:27] now bring it back to speaking
[1:18:29] father the son as it were my son let
[1:18:32] them not depart from thine eyes
[1:18:34] so he's saying keep it in your eyes keep
[1:18:36] focus on this thing
[1:18:38] where where are your eyes focus on what
[1:18:40] are you looking for what are you trying
[1:18:42] to achieve
[1:18:42] where is your because what you focus on
[1:18:44] is what you will live out
[1:18:46] anybody with me tonight what you spend
[1:18:48] your time doing is what you will be
[1:18:50] known for
[1:18:52] find the right balance we're gonna we're
[1:18:54] gonna get right to close now
[1:19:00] so shall so shall they be life
[1:19:04] unto thy soul and grace to thy neck
[1:19:07] then shall thou walk in thy way safely
[1:19:10] is there anybody want to want to walk
[1:19:11] safely
[1:19:12] will he give you the key knowledge
[1:19:14] understanding wisdom you want to walk
[1:19:15] safely
[1:19:16] and thy foot shall not stumble
[1:19:20] and these are open statements which
[1:19:22] means
[1:19:23] he is not qualifying these statements so
[1:19:26] thy foot shall not stumble
[1:19:28] in scripture and in studying you can
[1:19:30] extend this therefore child not stumble
[1:19:32] in business
[1:19:32] like foot shall not stumble in marriage
[1:19:34] like for child not stubborn in your
[1:19:36] relations
[1:19:37] yo because he's saying if you operate
[1:19:39] this way
[1:19:40] as you move as you walk he wants god
[1:19:42] wants you to walk with the confidence of
[1:19:44] knowing that you're part of his economy
[1:19:46] and you're part of his family that
[1:19:47] you're walking with
[1:19:48] angels to this patch to protect you
[1:19:53] window lies down and i said it i said it
[1:19:57] look at scripture when thou lie is down
[1:19:59] thou shalt not be afraid
[1:20:01] ye thou shall lie down and thy sleep
[1:20:04] shall be sweet
[1:20:06] i don't
[1:20:10] know that there's a difference that is a
[1:20:13] day that alone is a revival
[1:20:15] it have people in the message jumping
[1:20:17] and sorting at mystery and they sleep
[1:20:18] not sweeten
[1:20:21] find that reconciliation in scripture
[1:20:25] you know mystery and your sleep now
[1:20:26] tweet something wrong because this great
[1:20:29] god wants you to be able to lie down at
[1:20:30] night
[1:20:31] and know that your name is written in
[1:20:33] the book
[1:20:34] know that the price has been paid know
[1:20:36] that no weapon formed against you could
[1:20:38] prosper
[1:20:39] know that you're going out is blessed
[1:20:41] you're coming in is blessed
[1:20:42] knowing that your step is ordered by god
[1:20:44] knowing you're the car even stumble
[1:20:46] what an assurance how your sleep can be
[1:20:49] sweet
[1:20:51] so if it is you know mystery and they
[1:20:53] could you could break seals and it took
[1:20:55] and you can't sleep at night that making
[1:20:56] sense
[1:20:58] that might be much have to add up
[1:21:02] you have to have a life and live in such
[1:21:04] a way and understand that this word come
[1:21:06] that you could sleep beautiful sleep let
[1:21:08] me read it again
[1:21:11] that one when thou lies down though
[1:21:13] shall not be afraid yay
[1:21:15] thou shalt lie down and i sleep shall be
[1:21:17] sweet
[1:21:19] then he goes on to make sure you
[1:21:21] understand be not afraid of sudden fear
