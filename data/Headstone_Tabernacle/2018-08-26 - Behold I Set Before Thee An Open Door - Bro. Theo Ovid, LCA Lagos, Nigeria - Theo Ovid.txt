on Nigeria all the brothers in ministers there send a greeting then their love and pastor will loo from Lagos Church also sent his greetings by the grace of God we're so happy to be back home and we are yet yeah tremendous victory in Africa tremendous victory in Nigeria forgive us some tremendous tremendous meetings and there was testimony is to testimony of the Dead been raised and God is the supernatural is at work and the god of this prophet is still alive but a historical God you just readin quotes on reading history he still healing he is the deliverance he still alive he still restoring and that's what we are here for to get in contact with this this God amen freeze a limb of the Lord so I was away when I hear but it's good quick let's chop this Trinidad and now you know I always talk about see I'm not concerned much about a hurricane but the it quick that's coming that just a deposit they really want is yet to come so you know it's wondering all these bandits and robbers if they might get shake up what if a time then they back to the robbery and banditry and so on because the nature of man is still the nature of man she can it has a temporary shaken one thing with earthquakes do it make you that you're not in control see when storms I could put a thing and block and duck and different thing but a chicken that's a little different I don't think that they could shoot at that and they could fight that you see but the judgments of God is hanging over the earth and we have to begin to see that our lives is not in our own hands many choices and easier to make we have to make it prayerfully you have to really put things before God because you could plan but cordon have other plans and you want at this kind of our here now to really surrender your plans and put us to go on so this morning we gonna bless you we have a mixed message but I want to share with you a preach in a legal church but before that or how a few words I want to share with you up on my heart so that's time we're gonna turn our Bibles to Luke chapter 14 Thank You musicians a beautiful we want to read some scriptures there from 25 to 33 Luke chapter 14 just although you're fine and whether in the challenge is that Gordon is wisdom send your way let me repeat that hope you're fine and you're weathering the challenge that challenges that God in His wisdom sentences you're being looked up the 24 verse 25 to 33 and they went great multi-use with him and he turned and said unto their business Jesus if any man come to me and he'd not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters year and his own life also he cannot be my disciple now the context of this would heat is not as you know it doesn't mean you do not put above his discipleship your parents your wife your husband nothing must come ahead of him he must be first let's continue if any man come to me this verse 26 and heed not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters year and his own life also he cannot be my disciple and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first and contact the cost whether he be have sufficient to finish it lease happily after year lay the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish or what King going after to make war is another King sit at nothing not first and consulted whether he be evil with ten thousand to meet him that commit against him with twenty thousand or else while the other is yet afar off he said it ambassador his arid conditions of peace so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsake it not all all that he had he cannot be my disciple his boyars Heavenly Father we thank you for your presence and we pray that you would speak to us Lord these few words that I put you put up on my heart to share with them in Jesus and we ask it amen and him and you would be seated Luke chapter 14 14 in Luke chapter 14 okay so ahead of us we have this coming Thursday we have a special service Friday's a holiday we have a special service entire Church this coming Thursday and we know also after service from next September September month our service will be switching from Tuesday to Wednesday and Fridays we have Wednesday 7:30 Friday 7:30 and Sunday morning Sunday service this commune Sunday of course these two services we're gonna have communion service this coming Sunday so this morning I just want to share so much you contain the cost the cost of discipleship and he wants you to follow him Jesus not husband not wife not children not father mother brother it doesn't matter he must be first isn't that right and the disciple is a follower Elena that's how we have to become not arrogant not nobody got told talked to you not not nobody can tell you nothing because you're so we will tell you when you're so Jesus came and you know we were born in same shape iniquity we didn't stand a chance so we were at that base level nothing could work for us except God come and do something special for us are you are you understanding me now so Gaurav was the calm now and go past your flesh past your human spirit and turn a key inside of you to unlock the beginning of your transformation other than that you are just like everybody else unless God come between the bone and amar and good hang on till something inside of you you just like everybody else that live in Nice lives good lives I'm just gonna just stay here and die but your life because of the width of what God put inside you Christ died to redeem you when you don't even know you are worthy of redemption or you were called to redemption but you were called to this thing so his blood is shed that is spirit to be released to go after you listen regardless of your condition that part is very important regardless of your condition your condition has nothing to do with the release Spirit commented on the pulls from the inside out because gotta come inside you and picnics and then inside the wood back out from soldier spirit and only thing remaining is your body all glory to God because you are gonna be completely redeemed hallelujah so Jesus had was the call ordinary sinful men and tell them they were better than that they have value more than that you have to call them out and show them you have to be my disciple or follower but sit down and think the true and cut the course because this is not a game you're not gonna start if you don't think you'll finish the may as well not start but if you believe you can finish it let's get started if we believe we can a revival let's get started if we believe it could be a super Church let's get started right now let's get started or glory the thought I believe there is no limits to the church I believe we can come to a place where there is absolutely no limits one of the testimonies the sister died in church and they were take her to the hospital you know they still don't know what's happening and so on and husband refused to receiver this is taken to the morgue the priam everything I went to reach in more than she wake up Hospital didn't wanta the morgue supposed to take her but God can slow later but get cancelled all with the devil trap and a sign and trying to trap you on a Tyson what could break the pans of wickedness that's why I said God break it break it in just in your life that can be broken hallelujah glory know God what is it that is in men that would push them by vision to accomplish things that others say it can't be done all these penicillin vaccine and and all these different vaccine doctors discover light and and and the Wright brothers but airplane what is in it and they're these men that believe it could be conquered because courts put man to dominate and to rule the earth man wasn't supposed to be dominated by man was supposed to be the dominate all man was supposed to be in charge man was supposed to be under God having access to the power and authority of God and we see fallen man in His image for all man is a condition dominating with cars technology science and whatever it is they had still dominating because we were built for that so don't tell me you just defeated because you know how it is and you're born in sin no camera don't call me that inside are you on a DNA a gene something sorry you got put inside you to dominate man fly to the moon my son kingdom eyes man same thing go to space man setting up things and bringing on things outer space why we can't go open space this morning and the realm of the supernatural let's go to space open up like all Jesus could decide to walk on water and everybody said that can't be done but Jesus did it I never think Jesus a longer do it Peter did it to further the wild then he began to sink but I am seeing there's more to this gospel that you think you should hear you you're more than that you could do better than that you could live better than that you could be inspired more than that what could empower your vision and purpose but you could go beyond where you are that much more can be accomplished by and through your life you'd rather sit there and your lust in your flesh in your stinking roughness you let us sit there like that you could be inspired the mode of your priests got your situation you're at a run on your man to get no boyfriend yet are not guilty and again you can put Jesus first seek first the kingdom of God you can be so desperate and you parents can be so foolish delecia daughters or sons after some girl or some kind of nonsense they can be so dumb praise God hallelujah see first the kingdom of God what's that the Holy Ghost get the Holy Ghost first get cocky right first then everything gonna work out [Applause] [Music] [Applause] allelujah hit mother father brother what he said get indifferent to what they think and feel God first the word first is money and slack you don't be slack if your father's luck don't be slack God first don't follow your mother or father follow the word don't feel no dance that dig follow the word I don't care what the deacon do at the end of leaders matter what they do what the court said this one doing that that one doing that that's not my standard what the court said what did the prophet said but that the word said what the scripture said nobody is my standard taught the where is my standard I want that hallelujah [Applause] fight for that what is fighting for the fact that was once delivered to the Saints not know old talk know the faith once delivered to the Saints that was what was delivered something was given to them they had it it was delivered into their hands have I done I give it unto you it was delivered in their hands [Applause] what's the faith I know I know I know once vision break upon you your your your walk is different somebody's meant breaking the things that they create and make that the world will even know they need when they maybe iPad and the world establish and so on the world in nor they needed that they were told is still peaceful in book but them them physical book but now they become digital they're not going back to that don't have a camera I have a torch like yeah but this year I got about 50 things come wrapped up in one old phone right now all you forget did not phone all the time but camera in it or you forget that big big long things you couldn't take nothing in the channel let us up any boot with your coin oh do you know what point but do they mean no one would look like just I don't know whatever love letter look like that away for this time and when 20 we let that come how many let her go on any come back and push my now bring it yet in your waitin no everything is instant so inside the walk-in Sun power one God said no it doesn't look so nice man in the business God how much instant power so he said my pork loin with character my power berry discipleship my power born with you want a lineup to come in order nobody cares for sleep incited a Christian everybody hearing a Christian is actually kinda believe us sitting right here sorry right now so you can't just leave Church by any one person they could be Isis they could be a backslider they could be whatever it is you welcome everyone but to be a Christian is to get right inside of you and that's why we hid the word that the waiter strike you then the spirit on blind meet a change you which monk even thought that I won't give it to a stature it takes plot to change a man he's gone much woman syndicate in German marine mantich engine I know money husband dead she say dead he couldn't kill me take cottage in - you wanna have hottie through wicked on earth I said you know we could go it but what deceitful you know that hat deceitful who could do it but God so that make us a new heart I'll give you if you Harper's could've never offer you a different heart you see a new heart that will give you a new spirit that will give you and put my spirit in your spirit good lord do you have to watch me but you're hard to cast on your neighbor you can't stand this one and your blood can take this one with the heart of God you could have compassion because mercy you could seek justice you could see what is right at the core the extra mile because they are my heart for God even the extra mile for you you could call the extra mile for others it wants to be so selfish me stingy and plain evil or give the Lord a shout I'm speaking to somebody to pay the passes in the house hallelujah praise for dinner [Applause] unless if I take out of you to speak I miss a husband how much he gonna take time how much it will take out of you they speak kindly to your wife or to your husband or your children how much how much how much dad got a call tell you you go suffer go break your hat which man wouldn't build a tower sitting on the county course whether you're sufficient ability when you start to take a frisson people say laughs oh look at me he can finish come because there's a cost for marriage there's a cost for relationship there's cost to get closer to God everything have a cost that goes with it the revival have a cost ago that revival doesn't just happen it really is for revival there's a cross of prayer and agonizing and groaning and travailing and fasting and praying and believing unexpected and creating the atmosphere people recommend us jumping revival doesn't work so the cabbie just in front of TV movie and expects revival you can't be late late night show unexpected and sleep and wake up in the morning and get some kind of revival it is a price for revival glory to God Church on laid-back right now they are separate they are building of a condition of elders there are passes and they could they're good they're good but that's not what we want we don't want good church we want a revised people because you have to get the fire in your soul to correctly please God [Applause] hallelujah as you see why I think water just some medicine with the amount because Joshua don't know the mind of God he don't know what pleases God only as bullet could redeem as well so when you're in the world you have a consciousness of the will of God so when you're in the world you could live the world you could speak the word because it's written where it shall a young man cleanse this way by taking he to the word the word is God so when you're in the world the devil has to get permission to a proto man that covered with that word because the word is a protection the word is there sealed but the DeMars a liar because it be able does make you feel they would not powerful read the Bible read their Bible for every day but I'm said to get closer to God read the Bible and pray you're not reading the Bible not praying every day how you'll get closer to God it feels simple you want to get to our Father and Stella Mary play backward and cut a feather and buona sera you won't see me demi-god a given or simile me [Music] some lapis game pillow Jesus have mercy upon us simple a person do you say have mercy upon us someone was just nobody began drinking what naughty doesn't know do you see you drink your smoky well no one he didn't ask no questions how much the upon us anyway he's invited he will respond Jesus don't turn down no invitation wherever he's invited he respond some people not hit him right when he comes but he has come invited he cannot come I'm a supply me he said go on show yourself to the brief just a word he answer guandu Sumida me go and do this just go and show yourself to the priest so constable just go on show I like that go and show where they were walking they even reach mr. priest barnable Walkman man recognized the heel Lawren I am good I am fine look at that I better take a drink on that one man Java warmer by the beach one went here one when the 9mm ends up and one of them see whom I have to go back and I have to go back and thank the Lord I have to go back and praise it for healing me for blessing me for helping me for waking me up this morning for turning my life around put a song in my soul and he came back to Jesus I love this Jesus you may be seated do you say any man worship he said but Jesus it wasn't all of you healed we are the other name but she is drop a bomb he said your feet have many who watch this the other nine had obedience they got healed because I will bring what God said but this man he didn't get the no be he had faith because faith makes you praise faith makes you bush' faith as a revelation it is the substance of what you're hoping for it is the power before you get the power [Applause] hallelujah my god all right so this heat have to do with the pre for less to have less I know where's your word of what your mother saying and Farah say you know a brother husband and wife it doesn't carry the weight of the word of what Jesus said so his word is above everything else isn't that right so he give examples in the street how you could have the commitment or a task that's what he did by saying which man gonna build wouldn't we it out first consider the task that's ahead of us so you don't ball and straight oh god pressure bank and Jesus one time here's those diapers accepting my word I need my flesh y'all do life on what that under-17 and busted one day you say nothing that I go on service over for me and Jesus didn't back down you say well you go also you could go with them you know I'm Peter said Lord to whom shall we go now alone has the words of it I do I don't understand all what you're teaching and preaching but I know that the father sent you and I know that your words are true it will reveal myself are gonna for yourself consider the cost of following through to completion whatever it is what is home whether it's business whether it's marriage whatever it is you want to see it to completion isn't that right and I will close with this but around give a story of a man who was gonna build a bridge one day want to build a bridge in in Australia and all the architects come and dig up this all and tested it and said it cannot be done the whole B is full of quicksand and the soil will not hold together enough it will shift from place to place therefore if the bridge would be built it would be dangerous try to pass over it and finally there was a man who was a man of vision a bridge building England came over and looked at the Sun he surveyed it he tested the soil he sounded the water he looked over all this and I look over all fist and geez amber I'm sleeping descriptively red a man buying a ground going to meet an army first he set the lock on the course now I like the reference you have 10,000 in mine come on 20,000 no if your fellows Reds killing if you like a hundred twenty thousand fine if the driver skill is better than the buy JCPS cuz you don't want to be embarrassed you don't want to be ashamed you don't want to be defeated so in other words is it adjust your position this upon the situation come because if you know you can go out and fight there don't do it because you don't get right out nobody has a good to know better don't go and you say anyone work for the Lord and because ever taken your Alti home in the back make sure things are in order they have no place that even strip you see your things in position isn't alright so what if every one of you here the altar this morning would sit there in your seats before you come to be anointed and would count what it means it wouldn't just be going to a prayer Mr hazard Lee if we be going with a film confidence that God had promised it and God was able to keep his word this man tested the soils he tested each bed in there well dr. quicks done and finally he went through official said I will build a bridge and it will be safe the bridge builders from America different parts of the world laughed and said this man is mentally ill no man could put a bridge across that even for chicken will walk on the bridge it would be built it would sink the bridge kind of standard the vibration of the even the dog running across the bridge will vibrate the bridge said it will shake the silence the bridge will go down it could not be done but this man was a man of vision he knew what he was talking about for something dong in him told him he could do it God give us men in the church like that not observers there some people just observe they're doing nothing they waitin for you to go down or up if they go up they say we do it if we go down they on their own so in other words you want people that believe it could be done we could have a revival yeah we could have a church where Jesus is walking in it and the shot of the king is in the account that is what you want do you want that let the she'll be in your house first let your soul be in your heart first let your soul be in your prayer rooms us bring him here let's have a big show give the Lord some prisons because you have to bring that revival this is another vision he could do it so he took the contract weekly went to work he went testing his swords he went to testing song in the depths of the quicksand bed he tested every boat it has every piece of wood every piece of metal every concrete everything had to be perfect because his name his character his ability rested on whether the bridge turn or not and if a man on this earth my vision could be sure that everything was tested perfectly before he put it on the bridge because of his character because of his mean how much more did our Blessed Heavenly Father yes every word and every was said a word in the Bible he tested every word every prophet every son that cometh to God must be tested the material of course under this great highway every Rock every material that is placed before it is placed in the body of Christ before it is placed in the body of Christ all glory of God you come for more than a nice sermon the qualifier revelation and understanding of what you have to go through to be positionally pleased or give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God before it's placed into the body of Christ has to be tried shisen every son commander God must first be tried no exceptions say no exceptions say it out loud no exceptions every son are you a son and you can be tried stop trying Sabine wimpish face up your sigh like a man hallelujah turn up like a man or give the Lord our show let the men in the house say Amen let me at him brother say Amen tell him like a man and deal with it every one of them every prophet before he could write in that Bible he was tested by the Holy Spirit the bridge the bridge builder I'm sorry I forget his name couple of days ago I was reading him an article he said he got the best concrete man he got the best he could find out to put together the best that he had and my soul would cry cholera to God when I team that God puts his church the best that he could find God takes his children and test them with cities and places them into the body of Christ because they are tested don't rush don't rush the tests comment that remind me one time in the market I might say don't rush don't rush don't rush everybody gonna get and there's nobody there you know give all his goods in front they don't talk about don't push don't push I like that he is speaking in Reverse he's best in the polls don't wash your touches coming don't fight on this brother and this is but what you're going through yours are rich yet she watching them like a movie whoa I'm on the mountain way to visit your Valley coming you're right the dog it'll come in so he said he put he got the best concrete man the best he could find he said gore-tex Assurant you as a test then he places them in the body of Christ because they are tested they believe they went to trials they had the experience I love that listen how he placed these words because they were tested they believe one they went to trials to they had the experience you can't just be a believing Christian without no experience it has to bring you to experience bye-bye young people some time because I have to Pisa education to a degree or to Pisa some knowledge in the head they figure they knew it all I would have to push them into arrogance and somebody who don't have quarter of that knowledge but have the experience they have something that the young people don't have they have been through the fire down into certain experiences and that's

with him I said well you don't know what it is to be on the outside looking in and it was a blessing to be there in that weddin and to see the culture of the family connections and so on we don't have it like that we don't know it like that so it's quite enlightening and I was telling him that if it had more of that I think that there would be so much more support for marriages and West and maybe it might have had less broken homes unless absent fathers I'm so like that but I was thinking something even further that we as sons of God you know you know like I somebody asked me what do I speak I said English losting language long time ago from before fathers but the thing of it is we also lost our language from the Garden of Eden so that's why God's for mrs. Newton's that we could speak we lost our authority we lost our inheritance and we are fighting or we back home and Abraham he said he was seeking a city whose maker and builder is going so when you get into travelin mode and home mode you want to get back to where you were before because the sons of God had their culture and that culture was to have dominion over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the face of the earth we had our own environment which was even a place a garden that God put aside especially for the sons of God and the enemy of course was kicked out of heaven and he came to introduce himself to Eve but we are promised another Eve a second is that will not be deceived we are also promised to go back to the very even that our forefathers got kicked out of so Adam got put out the garden and God is trying to get us back to the garden and we are going back swings of God on what you feel you are doing the condition you're gonna straighten up your people aim and shoulders gonna straight back up you are prince you are king you are please you ain't got to try [Applause] be seated and many a times people talk about Israel and they forget that this twelve sons Jacob had and those twelve sons represented twelve tribes with their banners and the culture and everything else twelve sons praise God hopes of Levi house of Joseph holy men house of Ephraim hopes of Judah everybody belong to but they belong to God and even when the God go back to the Jews is a hundred and forty four thousand to be caught out out of every tribe and we send Gosselaar Eagle prophet to call you and I know that we can be fitted because we were always in the Lamb's Book of Life could never be received could never die because you are part of him or get a lot of shower what put your

Jesus so praise God brother Branham talked about true worship is in wine and oil that's how we have true worship when we have the wine and oil together and this is what brings on Revelation chapter 5 oil and revé oil and wine worship worship and and that is the creative atmosphere for your point of the Holy Spirit so butter brown and this is so strange that I got this this church age to identify this open door this is where he identified and as a resident age each of brotherly love please God and the Prophet he came in the back of the book on the back of the silence is supposed to be [Music] [Music] the loose ends these fellas be back and the mysteries come back from God as the Word of God and revealed the entire revelation of God isn't that right so he put Ephesians bridge for us to cross over isn't that right and now he said we are living by the evidence of the new land the son of man so what a Branham was the evidence to us that this land is real this promise is real but the vision is for an appointed tank so even though we have a revelation of what is promised we have to wait until that appointed time or glory to God hallelujah praise God that's why you are we the patients that you wait for this to be fulfilled but you wouldn't take something that God did not send but you were way on the promise because God promise will be fulfilled or glory to God what you're talking about God promised the manifestation of the sons of God not just sitting on in church but real manifestation of the sons of God God promised it oh praise God we believe that hallelujah mighty he-man praise the name of the Lord glory to God so brother Branham he took the seven voices of the tundish on the backside and placed it under the seven seal on the inside or glory to God only the intelligence of God could do that God please you in the blood section of the Lamb's Book of Life so that no nothing could take out your name no devil could take out your name no minister no Bishop no past I can take out your name and whenever God opened the door for you no man nobody could shut that door I'm going to put the door to you the door to your healing the total revival the total of Richard the total deliverance a door is going to open up to you [Applause] the tour of your dreams that over to hoping for but to longing for hallelujah praise God glory know God you may be seated cigar send a prophet to reveal the whole mystery of God for the rapture of the church he's in a prophet to open the book to open the world so the mighty angel came down with the book open the book is no longer closed so if the book is open we could go to any part of the book come on now I'm on Church if the book is here but this is to bring a prophetic vision to you because the Prophet body eyes he's the seer you will be seated so he saw for the entire what took him in 1965 but the vision he had wasn't a 1965 vision Desai please the bride is called I see a seal to the kingdom of God he prophesied are we gonna be here he prophesied are we gonna be here do you hear what I'm saying seven thunders gather the bride together this is what we are on the right now seven thunders exclusive bride promise or glory to God hallelujah praise God you may be seated so watch but a Branham was the I age he said next is the intelligence oh my hallelujah praise God do you believe that this is brother Branham the message called Christ is revealed loanword you say for Jesus himself is the interpretation of the Bible when he is made manifest in the age that a part of the body being made manifest so people that argue and fuss and caught but when Jesus has been manifest that is the interpretation so nobody ought to explain this I'm explain that and fight with courts but Jesus himself made manifest is the interpretation but a Branham says it then it come true defeat looter Wesley then to Pentecostal the tongues and the lips no it is the eyes prophetic Malachi for there is nothing else left for it to come but he himself to step into that the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own oh praise God in excess what the intelligence or the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the world because the vision is always for an appointed time do it Tara Whitsitt it will surely come it's a vision of God or glory of God in and Alleluia you may be seated to build this church it couldn't just just start this meal would and just that congregants it put some bricks there boys put some brick there boys put some wood put some what no and have to have a vision we could be made this way because we're exactly it had to have a program it has to have a revealing of the mystery of the architect of how this place supposed to be that is the picture now you may not have all the money one time all workers one time but that's the vision it's in the office hang in there I see what you're gonna build I see what we gonna accomplish or glory to God then you begin to dig the foundation then you begin to add the building is covered and you have a church or glory that got bit by a vision we'll call it a vision of a perfect man walking in here sons of God but but God said I will restore I'm gonna bring back that vision I'm going to bring back the word I'm gonna bring back the vision but if you cut not division what are you supposed to see Oh glory to God Oh hallelujah because the fish and give your eyes or may be seated my book of Samuel there was no open vision in that day praise God the priest was all messed up and go out call another boy named Samuel and give him a vision and Brahma said our open vision is the direc wood of the Lord people have closed vision today any inspiration title man is a closed vision because you have to connect that man the participate of what he has going to have no clothes vision this is an open vision this is for whosoever will you'll see it you can have it now when God put that open door to you you could get inside of it nobody could hinder you all those big mysteries that these high priests behind the in a veil and everybody wondered what they're doing behind there and what going on behind there and once a year these high priests with all the big hats and long gongs and bells ringing and the insider Daniel we're telling you don't know what happened but when Jesus died he passed that veil from the top to the bottom to show you that was only shadow that was only shadow to show you that you are gonna be the real priest or that mystery behind there he busted apart to make sure you know you could go straight to the show Oh glory to God do believe that you may be seated he's in the last days the true bride will come to the headstone and will be a super Church a super ace not not that church not no over-excited Pentecostal church we Antonio for that know we come give a super Church the Pentecostal don't have what we are promised silvano ha lino not even Jesus name his new name and the wife

faith of God in David when there is I'll cut your head off that wasn't David's feet that was caught fate and David being expressed to defeat the devil that was defeated already do you understand the devil was already defeated he's going for a really feet he's coming back to be defeated again [Applause] not happy with what you got come back again this'll be a super Church super race hallelujah

plant original world and know your original seed Oh hallelujah the secret the wood is in the brain and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word she does is in his name she has dusted the Lord and so on they only do his will you may be seated hallelujah praise God no one can persuade them different they have to see the Lord or to keep still the bride will have dustier the Lord let us stand like Joshua and Caleb Caleb represent the true believer stay with Joshua and he said the watch they said just lost the Commission you're washed up why not doing something today you used to do this and notice is the Lord but this wise God sent prophet knew the promise of God but also new to wait for that promise and this is the problem that the people don't want to wait so they're interested in keeping it to themselves teachers having itching ears they finally promised a long of transformation on our dynamics so they want to hear revelations that I've never seen so Oh is true never was a taught another thought and another taught and never taught but they are coming up distorts the word has to remain Mary's us forty years of war timer revelations but there's going to be a brand that gotta take this same world and bring it to life all glory to God so you know it away to the promise yeah what mom says because see and when the time come God give it to Joshua who stayed with him by the word he could not trust others he could trust him so will it repeat it may be seated discovery read Hebrews six and so after he patiently endured he obtained the promise another Scott veronik patience this is perfection written on God and we can for God patience is what brings our character in us if God give us in something like that I hope we have a long time there was something else a sin a love letter that we letter like let us take the thing and lick the stamp and put the stamp and hope this letter vistacal and then hope she reaches any other wait but I took three three weeks four weeks to get back this letter to say I love you I'm twisted and you answer like that it was no I just sent a what's up Orson attacks or SMS oh how you doing so so so God doesn't have that kind of thing to bring character he has this drawn out we tweet everyone love a son for 25 years no board didn't tell Abraham 25 years honor because they've got only 25 years he might have be playing for 24 only 25 years Abraham now cover the church [Applause] so God doesn't want that behavior what one to testimony he started not at the promise of God she won the lease what was strong

mountain God God do know what my just watch him I'm gonna keep right in there so why are you sure knee and go sit this one and then here Abram words I am the lad we will go up God is evil because

sickness wallace diseases we're gonna restore what the church dr. ephesus back to the alpha church that's like a nonprofit the turn us back not the explanation of the father's let me see the praise God oh my you wait till God begins unknowing this bride but the power of God and the pillar fire resting on your shoulder [Music] because because you know who you are you know I come from the book is open to you I know concept all I set before you an open door [Applause] maybe season let's get a few thoughts or glory nigari may be seated this age was the age of John Wesley Yusei was a brilliant scholar he was at Oxford he was a child he and Charles became part of the group that were spiritually exercised the worship listened on the basis of experimentally living the truth rather than making doctrine their standard so they were more interested in living truth than discussing truth that's why they come the word Methodist mean a method or a way it was a way of life that's what the Western holiness and the Methodists that's where that come from there was experimentally living the truth as opposed to talking about doctrine so when people say we can't fellowship because we are living a Dutchman you know that is foolishness that came in past Wesley's death because I don't care what doctrine you have as long as have the right spirit and we all under the blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin and we are selling one with another that has nothing to do with doctrine that's a lie of the devil that is satanic doctor on the similar or Satan [Applause] let me see that they drew up a spiritual guide of works such as giving to the poor visiting the sick imprisoned during his lifetime he could have acquired vast wealth but he did not his favorite scene on the subject of money was are you ready get all you can perceive a man it's just the same of whiskey get all you can see it all you can and keep all you can come we get a lot some praises get save and give so it it should also be mentioned that Wesley never the desire to build a work upon the nominal sectarian business and so on oh my Don was a daddy is of 88 having Steve got a few men but they even to think you may be seated I want to just share something with you a man of that age or even today I'm making the same mistake as the Jews took refuge in a synagogue for worship so in Philadelphia age they were taken refuge in the church it is not joining a church that counts the life is not in the church the life is in Christ this is the record gonna give us eternal life and this life is in his son Jesse but urbana I'm backing up his teachings with the scriptures isn't that right he said he that had the key of David beautiful prayers and he's a Christ the perfect realization contrasted with passion realization just wanna go further Isaiah 20 to 22 and the key of the house of David with a layup on his shoulder so he shall open a nunchuck shut and he shall shut anon shall open the spirit uses his Old Testament reference concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry in the church what the key of David signify at that time is a mere shadow which is not fulfilling Jesus tan in the mists of the lampstands it has to do with our Lord after his resurrection the pilgrimage but what does this key signify the answer lies in the position of the key it is not in his hand it is not worn around his neck it is not placed in the hands of other men though the verses could not be seeing that here on yahoo has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has the right budgies himself isn't that right but where is the key it is on his shoulder but what does the shoulder have to do with it Isaiah 9:6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder the answer this phrase garment upon his shoulder come from the wedding ceremony of the east when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulder signifying that not only is she under his Dominion but she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head and also that he bears the responsibility and the care that he and he alone no one else nor a man nor the power had any right and responsibility and that beloved is the key of David God being sovereign he foreknew by divine decree exactly who would be in the bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid a price for her she belongs to him to him alone she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ as the head of the church a serie called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is a lord he speaks and she obeys but that is her delight but men have but has been heeded his truth for their esteem his body who alone has a sovereignty over the church I said no here we go for in every church the church has been gone like a hierarchy a priesthood apostolic succession closing the door of mercy and grace Dillman will and instead of assuming the love and the responsibility of the church it has been mercenary lust preyed upon her and destroyed her I want to salute Pastor Hulu Oh as I'm here custom we we were Nigerian name Oh hallelujah because I see the love we have for his people I see the care here for his people and I admire that that's why I look for real Shepherds take care of the sheep okay the Lord a shout God thank you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated so listen to this so after the Wednesday age I come to Methodist age have been established to take roots one of the greatest among the Protestant churches something took place Jesus said an open door yeah we could be for the church before they entered into loud is an age so in this Philadelphia age he's I set before thee an open door he opened the door before loud easier and this open door have to do with no messenger it was God Himself the Holy Ghost now he went on to say that Philadelphia now Asia this door is just between the Philadelphian and the loudest and age is a lap over now right now the Lord said in the end of that age I am the door to the sheepfold now the door was open between two ages 1906 when the Methodist Church & Dwight Moody and and faded from the scene there come a break thought of those people receiving the Holy Ghost so when God opened the door to break out the Pentecostal ear there was no man messenger there was no man releasing the Holy Spirit there was no man given the Holy Ghost God just open the door and see more and all them Pentecostal people they move inside of it because they saw what promise stones and speaking in tongues and signs and wonders and they were in a basement in a prayer meetin and they got in an atmosphere because they saw that God promised that gives to be restored and they cut in the atmosphere create an atmosphere for these gifts to come down the open door was there and they step into it and don't come the Holy Ghost or glory to God God haven't changed the open door God have that shift of the open door the open door still remains that's why the spirit follows the blood from the book of redemption whenever the blood is at this very gonna be there oh you are Oh glory may be seasoned you are under the blood right now you don't see your phones and your feelings and the mystics and your failings because you're under the blood here and your prayer prayer coming true the blood or glory to God in the under the blood you are perfect Oh holla you hear what I said shoot that blood you are perfect that's nothing against you I don't get what the devil bang in your mind it's what God said oh how long guess nothing against you he said it Oh hallelujah glory to God that's why the word

door if you want to see the revelation here it is where you would village church I'm the only way that he could take his churches back to the revelation of what he is not what if I fall is not what the Prophet is what what he is because he William Branham is the messenger he came to bring a message that Jesus wife [Music] [Applause] do you get it now William Brennan was the messenger he had a

sitting back just gonna leave you alone you think here in the beach somewhere this morning he's waiting outside trying to trap trying to hinder trying to quench your spirit but we come to shake him off because the Prophet said you could live such a life that the devil don't know what to do with you [Applause] when you wake up in the morning and you go down on your knees the demo run out and say she no no no she praying again [Applause] [Music] when you walk the streets of Lagos that tell you who's coming a Sun is coming a man who know who he is the son of a king is coming he walks like one he talks like one he lives right one yes one this is the opposition all right believe you me they're doing very well all right all right Luther message scientific ation true here Watch okay here sir this that's the supervision right there so he's showing him in this church in Philadelphia had his mystery of where we are right now virgin right there can you see at the end time when they went out they were justified by faith sanctify to hear but missed the open door justified by faith to looter sine Phi by the Wesley many of them precious nursery in preparation methods before clean life think they got the Holy Ghost on here fellow speak in tongues and the laugh at Emma see the devil you see yourself what your guts in the Holy Ghost they were all sanctified here we go every one of them but five was wise enough to have the wisdom of Revelation to touch that door to be filled with the spirit wisdom of Revelation to touch that door they had all in the lamps and the others had no oil and they were weakened and when they come up they say oh give me some of your oil give me some he said go and pray up and the bridegroom came and watch a couple of more verses you'll find they go into the Tribulation Period I will keep thee from the hour of temptation that will try every man on the earth and butterbur and reveal that as the tribulation so we're gonna protect you from three-and-a-half years and give a trillionth wedding supper and avoid you from getting chilly laughs yes Tribulation Period oh praise God are you with me glory to God a man you may be seated I'm on the home stretch here now all right so we noticed you me see said I wanna get something here now we notice this problem of the fourth true or false believers are already in the existence of the second age these who falsely call themselves Jews appear right after the first four point of the first age that is hardly an accident indeed it is not an accident it is a principle of Sita the principle is to organize and claim originality and therefore be entitled to special rights and privileges let me show you back there is minor age these people lied and said they were actually Jews or believers and they were not I remember a pastor tell me see beloved somebody's brothers because we in Congress some characters are not right here but receive some innocence have they ever met Jesus when you consider some of the behaviors and attitudes do they know Christ or they just believe a message see but some point in time you have the me Christ I need to meet Christ is only one effect when you meet Christ it humbles your heart and spirit no man ever come in the presence of God and raise up arrogant no man not even John John say I fell as one dead Daniel fell as one dead as I as the worries me when they break into the supernatural but a Brannon found himself on the corner knocked out and that was the vision that was not even the seven angels coming here SS division but rather they were sit-ins organized crowd as it wasn't that age we saw the start of men in the ministry I already taken an unwarranted leadership over the minister and brethren that is the beginning of Bishop three my ministry bigger than your ministry now you see my ministry so you have a tiny ministry I'm gonna come in to take over I really is that I taught one is a finger and one is a foot and one is an eye and one of them knows I thought all belong to the same buddy you're needed knows I need a mount you need her ears near the right ears and either fingers when a young man creamed up all if I fall you know in trouble one but in India ask me are we gonna have an international pasta i said and then i said we then we have an international poop typically trained to bring it like we need this man this city yeah we need a man but in mine Christ Jesus if a man have that man we'd be happy for that manner if you fail in that man that is mean but he can't pedal a man you can't push a man this is my let me say it again they were sit-ins or a nice crowd for it wasn't that age we saw the start of men in the ministry taking an unwarranted leadership over their minister and brethren bishops set up in districts over elders the next thing we saw was the terrace was a definitely a place called seat and seat the age give us the church state marriage with the power of the state behind her the church and was literally physically invincible but God brought that whole in spite of the power of state with Rita as the reformer or glory to God still backup power and one thunder a little blade Martin Luther couldn't find nobody God looking for some Sun to talk to God went to the Catholic Church and find a priest that had a sincere heart looking for justification meeting for forgiveness God went and not in the Catholic Church and find a man named Martin Luther and when God blast the bomber blood upon him and he seen we are justified by faith we can shake off recognizing a son of a king and began to preach justification shake the whole kingdom of Rome well no wonder the prophets said we're tell them seven thunders uttered their voices to that group it will turn up the world brother right now the begin of the rock you don't even know what happened in the spirit realm you think thickness oh my god you think we nice here right now no we have any places [Music] Nigeria is the outskirts right now right now in the realm of the spirit and in the spirit realm there's an earthquake taking place the devil just watches Nita and say something shaken something shaken trying to find out which countries are coming from wet dipping from asleep Lagos Davos I feel fine praise God something is happening something shaken vomit movements it's moving movements Oh in the spirit realm Oh hallelujah praise God when I finish hallelujah my god they are dead they are turn of oh my dear son the true fruits are missing they are built upon their own creeds and dogmas and doctrines and the truth is not in them for their taking their own consoles above the Word of God let me show you that what I've been teaching you may be seated come from two different spirits I'm gonna close I'm gonna kind of wrap up here oh praise God the shock was a carrier isn't that right and the seat itself has to leave the shock or a shock us to leave the seat either one seed leaf shock leave but both of them can see together the purpose of the shock leavin sees leavin is the cat in the person of the song in the presence of the Sun the shock dries up in the prison of the Sun the seed dude golden brown same Sun so when Sun
