[34:26] amen and amen God bless you
[34:28] you thanks again for being here tonight
[34:31] and if have your Bibles I like to turn
[34:33] to 1 John chapter 1 we're want to read 5
[34:36] to1 1 John Chapter 2
[34:39] 9-11 Revelation 5 1-7 so good to be here
[34:43] tonight see all of you out God bless you
[34:46] welcome and uh from 1 John 1
[34:52] ver5 this then is a message which we
[34:54] have heard of him and declare unto you
[34:57] that God is light in him is no Darkness
[35:01] at all if we say we have fellowship with
[35:05] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[35:09] not the truth but if we walk in the
[35:11] light as he is in the light we have
[35:14] Fellowship one with another and the
[35:16] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[35:19] us from all sin if we say we have no sin
[35:23] we deceive ourselves and the truth is
[35:24] not in us but if we confess our sins he
[35:27] is faithful and just to forgive us of
[35:31] our sins to cleanse us from all
[35:33] unrighteousness that's the deal if we
[35:36] say we have not sinned we make him a
[35:38] liar and his word is not in us and we go
[35:42] to chapter 2 and reading from verse 9 it
[35:45] reads he that sayith he is in the light
[35:49] and hateth his brother is in darkness
[35:53] even until now he that loveth his
[35:56] brother abideth in the light right and
[35:58] there is none occasion of stumbling in
[36:00] him but he that hateth his brother is in
[36:04] darkness and WTH in darkness and knoweth
[36:08] not whether he goeth because that
[36:11] Darkness has blinded his eyes Revelation
[36:14] chapter five reading from verse one and
[36:16] I saw in the right hand of him that sat
[36:18] on the throne a book written within on
[36:20] the backside seal with Seven Seals and I
[36:23] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[36:25] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[36:27] book and to loose the seeds thereof and
[36:29] no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither
[36:32] under the Earth was able to open the
[36:33] book neither to look there on and I wept
[36:36] much because no man was found worthy to
[36:38] open man to read the book and he to look
[36:40] there on and one of the elders said unto
[36:42] me weep not behold the land of the tribe
[36:44] of Judah the root of David had prevailed
[36:47] to open the book and to loose the seven
[36:49] sees thereof and I beheld and low in the
[36:52] midst of the Throne of the four beasts
[36:53] in the midst of the ERS stood a lamb had
[36:56] been slain having 7 horns and seven eyes
[36:59] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[37:01] forth into all the Earth and he came and
[37:03] took the book out of the right hand of
[37:05] him that sat upon the throne praise God
[37:07] God bless you may have a seat may God
[37:09] bless this reading of his word always
[37:11] it's good to be here tonight I thank God
[37:13] for all the services that has gone on uh
[37:16] previous to this one and we just thank
[37:18] God for the gifts and the blessing that
[37:20] has blessed us by the
[37:22] word so tonight I have a a title uh and
[37:27] and um well Steven really was blessed
[37:30] with in a special way and I got some
[37:32] stuff from it and I I told him and and I
[37:36] have some something that he he said but
[37:38] I want to title this this tonight this
[37:40] book of redemption was given to make
[37:44] sons and daughters again you hear about
[37:47] the book and the Book of redemption and
[37:48] the Seven Seals but there's a object
[37:51] that this book has and the purpose of
[37:53] this book is to make sons and daughters
[37:56] again the book purpose of the book is
[37:59] not for argument is not for debate it's
[38:02] not for doctrinal differences the object
[38:05] of God is to make Sons and Daughters of
[38:08] God by this book or through this book
[38:11] now the Pentecostals couldn't come
[38:12] through because they rejected the word
[38:14] because they rejected the prophet so
[38:16] they didn't have the word to get the
[38:17] seed to become the word because the word
[38:21] was yet to come the Pentecostal was the
[38:23] birth if they had received the message
[38:25] which was the word they could become
[38:27] sons in the TRU sense of sons so this
[38:30] message is the key to our sunship and
[38:33] our inheritance and our godship praise
[38:36] the Lord now when God made man he made
[38:39] him dust he made this a little certain
[38:41] compartment in the man for his throne
[38:43] his controll Tower God wants to lead man
[38:47] but man wants to lead himself therefore
[38:50] there's a walk constantly think quot
[38:52] this but even read the man wants to go
[38:54] after what he sees with his eyes and
[38:56] there's where he deceived so in other
[38:58] words your five senses is lying to you
[39:01] because your five senses is declaring
[39:02] what your eye taste fell all those
[39:04] things but the faith comes by the word
[39:08] and Faith make you see God because Faith
[39:10] connects with the word right you can
[39:12] only get Faith by hearing the word so
[39:14] when your word is preached to you faith
[39:16] is activated to begin to begin to get a
[39:18] glimpse of what God sees and how God
[39:21] sees it oh praise the name of the Lord
[39:23] so watch that is where Satan deceived
[39:25] Eve by what you could see the fruit was
[39:27] pleasant to the eye it was death to the
[39:29] soul so it is tonight God wants to lead
[39:32] man so he made himself a little control
[39:34] tower in the midst of his heart so that
[39:37] man would be led by the spirit of God
[39:40] getting off of his own leading is what
[39:43] separated him from his
[39:44] fellowship and when and that is where we
[39:46] stand tonight all those who are led by
[39:49] such things but the scripture said Sons
[39:51] and Daughters of God are led by the
[39:53] spirit of God not by your emotions not
[39:56] by your feelings not by your imagination
[40:00] Sons and Daughters of God are led by the
[40:02] spirit of God I feel and I feel and I
[40:05] feel you feel nothing forget your
[40:07] feeling what did God says you have to be
[40:09] led by the spirit of God isn't that
[40:11] right now watch it there now watch and
[40:13] you notice a man or woman that tries to
[40:16] walk after the things of the world they
[40:18] can never please God but a man and woman
[40:21] that will not look to the things of the
[40:23] world and just go according to the
[40:25] leading of the spirit they are are
[40:27] usually in the will of God so the
[40:30] spirit's leading and remember the spirit
[40:32] will not lead you contrary to the word
[40:34] then you know it's not the Holy Spirit
[40:36] right praise God so Satan took the eye a
[40:39] man's head to control him by his head
[40:42] because the eye have plenty touch points
[40:45] you see coffee you see cake you want to
[40:47] eat cake you see a Roy shop you want Roe
[40:49] you see this one hi hello and you see
[40:51] your phone and WhatsApp your eye your
[40:53] eye eye and head eye and head what your
[40:56] eyes see every day is all color is all
[40:59] connections and Satan take the head but
[41:01] there's something deep that God puts
[41:02] that in your heart that's why you can't
[41:04] even explain you why you still connected
[41:07] to this gospel you can't even explain
[41:10] why you keep holding on why something
[41:12] you keep believing it's not you it is
[41:15] something in you something you can't
[41:17] explain that's how you supposed to know
[41:19] is God is something you cannot explain
[41:22] God put that in you not your mother not
[41:24] your father not your uncle not your aunt
[41:26] not your grandmother not your great
[41:28] grandmother God put that inside of you
[41:31] Hallelujah that's his Gene that's his
[41:33] germ that's his seed that's why Jesus
[41:35] could confidently say no man could come
[41:37] to me except my father draw him and all
[41:40] that the father had given me will come
[41:42] Jesus the confidence because in you once
[41:45] God put it in you it got to come it got
[41:48] to respond where there's a deep deep
[41:50] calling you got to have a deep to
[41:51] respond God knew what he put inside of
[41:54] you he knew what will activate you he
[41:56] knew what will draw you he knew what
[41:58] will call
[42:01] you hallelujah
[42:03] hallelujah let's go man is always trying
[42:06] to achieve something by his head he's
[42:09] supposed to achieve but by his
[42:13] heart that's why your head thinking one
[42:15] thing but your heart see something
[42:20] else like you know you you meet somebody
[42:23] and and and and you know they they say
[42:25] certain things and what that and that's
[42:26] all sudden your heart a red flag go up
[42:29] something just can't explain but
[42:33] something all a sudden there is like
[42:35] something I ain't clicking with that
[42:37] person you know like something fishy
[42:39] something not you can't explain it you
[42:41] know but the Vibes that's the heart
[42:44] saying No
[42:47] Deal so the heart that's the controll
[42:50] tower when god control him and directs
[42:52] his thoughts directs his Works directs
[42:55] his emotions sometime I get so happy I
[42:58] just have to let loose if I look around
[43:00] I see somebody then I got my eyes on
[43:01] people then but God helped me to keep my
[43:03] eyes closed I want to be led by the
[43:06] spirit of God that the flesh will have
[43:08] nothing to do into it we find that this
[43:11] man is controlled by a controlled Tower
[43:13] and that Tower makes him what he is it
[43:15] moves him Hallelujah so the real you is
[43:18] not the head so much that head have
[43:21] intentions good intentions is go
[43:23] straight to
[43:23] hell but the heart is the real you
[43:31] that's the real you your head G Fight
[43:33] your head go oh a lot of problems up
[43:35] here a lot of battles up here a lot of
[43:37] confusion up here but deep down what you
[43:40] are is as a man thinking is that so is
[43:42] he what you are here in your heart
[43:44] that's that's
[43:47] you and the tower makes him what he is
[43:51] it moves him he lives by it it's his
[43:55] emotions he lives by it now why where
[43:57] they are waiting on the spirit to know
[43:59] what to say and okay I'll go God knows
[44:01] what he's doing as long as he's leading
[44:06] you see you must always go by the spirit
[44:10] and the spirit will always agree with
[44:12] the word now if the spirit leads you
[44:15] contrary to the word then it's not the
[44:16] spirit of God if the holy spirit is
[44:19] leading you it will say Jesus Christ the
[44:21] same yesterday today and forever now he
[44:24] said all these strange voices in the
[44:26] world of this Social Gospel belongs to
[44:29] church and that has not has and why
[44:32] hasn't it done something it's done
[44:34] nothing but confuse the people what we
[44:36] need tonight is a unified Church filled
[44:39] with the Holy Ghost and power from on

[44:55] him but that is what they say in message
[44:58] not saying these exact words their life
[45:00] and behavior speaks that I am better
[45:04] than them because my pastor have more
[45:07] Revelation than his Pastor or we have
[45:09] more it whatever it supposed to be in
[45:11] our church than that other Church which
[45:12] is
[45:13] foolishness and the Believers are
[45:16] deceived by believing that
[45:20] crap we read a scripture if you say
[45:23] you're walking in the light and hate
[45:24] your brother you a liar

[45:31] that as we confess our sins we have
[45:32] fellowship with him the blood of Jesus
[45:35] cleanses us not cleanses them us you
[45:39] included and then we could have
[45:41] Fellowship one with another so what else
[45:44] could affect
[45:45] Fellowship is the Devil Himself

[45:50] Fellowship that is why he put man on the
[45:51] earth to have fellowship with man oh

[51:01] to see what sons of God begin to look
[51:02] like oh God good Lord get help me Jesus
[51:06] after all these years we have to begin
[51:08] to see
[51:10] E when God create monkey and goat and
[51:13] cow and and and and whale and and all
[51:16] that he there was none like him he said
[51:18] let us make man in our image and like
[51:20] this it have to resemble something oh
[51:22] glory to God when Moses was looking to
[51:25] Lord I want to see you when the past he
[51:27] saw the back part of a man an image must
[51:29] reflect something oh give the Lord a
[51:31] shout it can't reflect nothing oh how it
[51:34] must reflect something after all these
[51:37] years we have to see some kind of
[51:41] [Applause]
[51:54] formation Hallelujah
[51:56] a woman say she's
[51:58] pregnant and she going for
[52:01] ultrasound and they see
[52:06] nothing is
[52:10] Burger is is burger or some kind of some
[52:14] other things she e you know in other
[52:16] words you have to see her form you have
[52:18] to see her shape and after all these
[52:20] years you have to begin to see a form a
[52:23] shape and has to be in the Statue of a
[52:26] perfect man it has to be in a a form
[52:30] that reflects God image and
[52:31] likeness it can't reflect you it can't
[52:34] affect your bad behavior it can't affect
[52:36] your temper and your attitude and your
[52:38] you're Vex and you're angry and you're
[52:40] upset and you're hateful and you're
[52:42] miserable you're miserable for 40 years
[52:44] how long you been miserable for like
[52:48] you but God want to bir it from above
[52:56] notice specifically the words of Matthew
[52:59] 25
[53:01] 31-46 he's referring to the script we
[53:04] just read it does not say that a
[53:07] Shepherd is literally separating sheep
[53:10] from goats but it is as a Shepherd
[53:14] dividing sheep from coats these are not
[53:17] sheep in this particular area of time
[53:20] which is white Throne judgment the Sheep
[53:23] are already in his fold they heard his
[53:26] voice the word and they followed him
[53:29] they already have eternal life and
[53:32] cannot come into judgment but these who
[53:35] he's talking about here now do not have
[53:37] eternal life they are in the Judgment
[53:41] they are allowed to go into eternal life
[53:44] but upon what grounds do they enter into
[53:48] life eternal certainly not upon the fact
[53:51] that they already have his life as does
[53:53] the bride but they receive it because
[53:55] they were kind kind to his
[53:58] Brethren they are not his Brethren that
[54:01] would make them joint ISS with Jesus
[54:03] they are not as to anything but
[54:07] life they share No throne with him their
[54:11] names must have been in the Book of Life
[54:13] and not removed but because of their
[54:17] love of the people of God they are
[54:20] recognized and
[54:22] saved take that devil Oh Glory G to God
[54:27] did you get that there are people that
[54:29] going to love the Brethren and because
[54:32] of their love for the people of God they
[54:36] will be recognized and saved God said so
[54:41] oh give the Lord some Praises there the
[54:43] Lord I shout in the house
[54:47] Glory let's go no doubt these served and
[54:52] helped the children of God perhaps like
[54:55] Nicodemus and gal they stood for the
[54:58] children in a time of trouble it may
[55:00] seem the smack of restoration watch
[55:02] carefully now for the wicked are not
[55:05] restored but are turned into a lake of
[55:07] fire the names of many of those
[55:09] destroyed were in The Book of Life also
[55:11] but they were blotted out because they
[55:14] failed to honor the people of God who
[55:18] were
[55:19] living manifested word living Epistles
[55:23] for their day and they fail to honor
[55:27] that bad behavior Wicked people and I go
[55:31] call on them
[55:33] Spirits I was telling
[55:35] NM
[55:37] about many times we don't see what God
[55:39] see you know when God see Wicked I was
[55:42] telling about the man with the talent
[55:44] when the man come back and this one have
[55:46] five produce five this one had 10
[55:47] produce 10 this one have one he bury it
[55:49] well you know he address
[55:51] him Wicked servant you know not you know
[55:54] boy you miss the mark you know you know
[55:56] I mean should have put in back all right
[55:58] no not that you know
[56:00] Wicked who said that God said that
[56:03] that's how God seeing
[56:05] it amen in John 1 let's go in the
[56:10] beginning was the word the word was with
[56:12] God and the Word was God in him was life
[56:16] the life was the light of men the light
[56:18] CH to The Darkness Darkness compar not
[56:20] let's go he was all right he came unto
[56:24] his own verse 11 and he received him not
[56:26] but as men receive him to them give he
[56:29] power to
[56:30] become so we get a new word now that
[56:34] power has to be
[56:36] released for us to become the sons of
[56:40] God we are Sons Fallen Sons but to
[56:42] become the sons of God he's talking
[56:44] about a different level of sunship he's
[56:47] talking about a real attribute son of
[56:49] his Spirit manifesting what the father
[56:52] had or to be just like the father Oh
[56:55] Glory to God what we manifest now is
[56:58] what our fall nature have we have car
[56:59] house land lights wherever man heart is
[57:02] science and whatnot technology and
[57:03] whatnot but God not in his technology
[57:05] business God in the translation business
[57:08] we have technology that they don't know
[57:11] God in the opening open the prison bars
[57:13] God in the healing business conquering
[57:15] nature business God got a different
[57:17] level all together isn't that right that
[57:18] we back to watch as many as receive him
[57:21] which is the word to them give he power
[57:24] to become the sons of God so becoming
[57:27] sons of God is Not
[57:29] instant it's as brother stepen says a
[57:31] process it's a process to become sons of
[57:35] God you are born and you become you he
[57:38] said you make yourself a Christian you
[57:41] just sit down because watch this power
[57:43] came to the Pentecost
[57:45] 1906 but look how they are they still
[57:47] filthy as they were since back then in
[57:49] other words that power came but they
[57:51] didn't have the word to make them Sons
[57:54] or the word to for the to reform into
[57:57] Sons they didn't have that that's right
[57:58] at this day they're still
[58:01] failing because they don't have the word
[58:04] because the word is what God used in the
[58:06] beginning let there be let there be let
[58:08] there be let there be and in the
[58:10] beginning was the word and the Word was
[58:12] with God and the Word was God and the
[58:15] word tonight is still God oh glory to
[58:18] God and the word tonight could transform
[58:20] you if you want to receive it inwardly
[58:22] and willingly not outwardly and formally
[58:25] oh give the the Lord some Praises
[58:27] Hallelujah you receive that word
[58:29] inwardly and willingly and watch that
[58:31] word go to work inside your heart glory
[58:34] to God remember the devil can't get
[58:35] inside the deal because the word is the
[58:37] deser of the thoughts and intents of the
[58:39] heart not the devil the word is Oh Glory
[58:41] to God the devil could play with your
[58:43] mind but he can't mess with that seed
[58:45] inside your heart give the Lord some
[58:46] Praises tonight Hallelujah do you love
[58:48] him do you love the Lord
[58:51] tonight watch as men receive him to them
[58:54] give you power to become the sons of God
[58:56] even to them that believe in his name
[58:58] continues which were born not of blood
[59:01] nor the will of Flesh nor the will of
[59:03] man but of God he's saying you'll be
[59:06] born of God and the word here we go was
[59:09] made
[59:10] flesh and dwelt among us
[59:13] but like Abraham could not see that son
[59:16] no signs of pregnancy of Sarah not even
[59:18] menstration periods nothing and yet God
[59:21] said so all hopes her womb was dead his
[59:25] life was him was gone the stream of his
[59:27] life had dried up her life had dried up
[59:29] within her yet he staggered not at the
[59:31] promise of God true unbelief but was
[59:34] strong giv praise knowing that God was
[59:36] able to perform anything he said he
[59:38] would there is the way we got to believe
[59:41] that word today do you believe it like
[59:42] that that God can't lie there's going to
[59:44] be Revival there'll be a super church or
[59:46] super race as we near The Headstone
[59:48] there'll be a power and the shout of the
[59:50] king be the camp the car close us down

[1:05:02] hallelujah oh
[1:05:06] my who is this great unseen person who
[1:05:09] is this that Abraham seen in Visions
[1:05:11] right at the last though he was
[1:05:13] manifested in flesh before the sun came
[1:05:16] God himself came to Abraham in the form
[1:05:19] of a man at the end time manifested he
[1:05:24] saw him in a little light one time he
[1:05:26] saw him in Vision he heard his voice
[1:05:27] many Revelations but just before the
[1:05:30] promised son he saw him in the form of a
[1:05:33] man and talk to him fed him meat and
[1:05:36] drink notice God himself failed in human
[1:05:40] flesh this is a part of his way this is
[1:05:43] the way he manifest himself to us he
[1:05:46] manifest his eternal word god Jehovah
[1:05:49] made flesh like in St John 1 and this so
[1:05:52] the prophet said it in the beginning was
[1:05:54] the word and the Word was with God then
[1:05:57] he said this in the beginning was Elohim
[1:06:01] and Elohim became the word and the Word
[1:06:06] was Elohim and the Word was made Elohim
[1:06:09] it's the same thing just unfolding
[1:06:13] Elohim the thought the word the L ghost
[1:06:18] the word made flesh then he went on to
[1:06:20] say this like the attribute see it is
[1:06:24] God attribute which is your thought God
[1:06:26] in the beginning the Eternal he was even
[1:06:29] God he was eternal he wasn't even God
[1:06:32] God is an object of worship he wasn't
[1:06:34] even that he was Elohim the Eternal but
[1:06:37] in him here we go was taught listen
[1:06:41] tonight he wanted to become
[1:06:45] material that is the ccs of the matter
[1:06:47] here right now the thoughts that he had
[1:06:50] in his mind he wanted it to become
[1:06:56] material what did he do he spoke a word
[1:07:00] and the word
[1:07:01] materialized and that is the whole
[1:07:04] picture from Genesis to Revelation this
[1:07:07] word materializing and the Word was
[1:07:11] invisible until it became flesh oh
[1:07:15] praise the name of the Lord so God's
[1:07:17] purpose as brother stepen preached was
[1:07:19] for you to become manifested God purpose
[1:07:23] for you to become the word made
[1:07:26] flesh it is nothing wrong let's go I'm
[1:07:30] I'm reading it is Elohim materializing
[1:07:34] so he can be touched and feel and in the
[1:07:37] Millennium there is Elohim sitting on
[1:07:40] his throne with all his subjects around
[1:07:42] him he predestinated before the
[1:07:45] foundation of the world give the Lord
[1:07:46] some praise this is beautiful tonight

[1:13:32] him that one Jesus met the requirement
[1:13:36] Grace produced the person of Jesus
[1:13:38] Christ and we find this book now God
[1:13:42] stretched his tent come from God to
[1:13:45] become man he changed his strain from
[1:13:49] the almighty to be a man to take on the
[1:13:52] form of man so he could redeem thy to
[1:13:55] redeem man the bride in the Bible in the
[1:13:59] Book of Ruth you read it such a person
[1:14:01] was called a goel goel he was called a
[1:14:04] go it was a person that could meet the
[1:14:06] requirement and the go must be able to
[1:14:09] do it he must be willing to do it he
[1:14:11] must be a Kinsman next to Kinsman and
[1:14:13] God the creator of spirit here we go
[1:14:16] became kins folks to us when he become
[1:14:19] man in order to take our sin upon him
[1:14:21] and pay the price so he couldn't take
[1:14:24] our sin upon him in spirit form he had
[1:14:26] to become one of us and take us as a
[1:14:29] human as a kins folk that why the word
[1:14:32] became flesh here we go let's go down a
[1:14:35] little deeper now there it is there's
[1:14:37] the Redeemer
[1:14:39] Christ has redeemed us now we are now
[1:14:44] redeemed but he has not claimed his
[1:14:47] possession yet you might different with
[1:14:50] that just hold on a minute he hasn't
[1:14:52] claimed it if he took the book of
[1:14:54] redemption everything that Adam had
[1:14:57] everything that he lost Christ redeemed
[1:14:59] back so this is an unfolding Revelation
[1:15:01] present tense Redemption God redeeming
[1:15:04] you day by day Christ has redeemed you
[1:15:07] is already unfolded in his great mind he
[1:15:10] already redeemed us but he hasn't took
[1:15:12] possession yet he cannot until the time
[1:15:14] appointed and then will come the
[1:15:16] resurrection and then the Earth will be
[1:15:18] renewed again and then he will take
[1:15:20] possession he will possess when he come
[1:15:22] to redeem us he come at the appointed
[1:15:24] time Give the Lord a praise glory to God
[1:15:28] hallelujah hallelujah so he hasn't
[1:15:30] claimed us as yet but the spirit come to
[1:15:32] redeem our souls redeem our spirit and
[1:15:34] then there's a fire baptism to redeem
[1:15:36] our body praise God so we have to die
[1:15:39] out and we have to have die out and
[1:15:42] Faith could come out and virtue could
[1:15:43] come out and knowledge come out the
[1:15:44] death of a corner weat all these virtues
[1:15:46] have to be emanating through us he said
[1:15:48] that God can see these things living in
[1:15:51] us oh give the Lord some Praises so how
[1:15:54] that could be
[1:15:55] and people behaving so badly something
[1:15:57] is wrong he said the spirit of God can't
[1:16:00] behave in one man and dis behave in
[1:16:01] another man something is wrong we
[1:16:03] talking about the spirit we talking
[1:16:05] about the seals we talking about the
[1:16:06] unfolding of the word it has to become
[1:16:08] flesh
[1:16:12] tangible and then a favorite quote you
[1:16:15] quot this so much time the ministry has
[1:16:18] reached its Perfection when Christ is
[1:16:21] reproduced in natural

[1:16:40] everywhere they come to them and all the
[1:16:41] drama all the PO poy they have here the
[1:16:45] prophet say this the ministry comes to
[1:16:47] his
[1:16:48] Perfection when Christ is reproduced in

[1:19:48] darkness
[1:19:54] there's a church only the whole church
[1:19:56] in darkness a Visionary Church the whole
[1:19:57] church in darkness only light is by the
[1:20:00] exit only light is by the exit the whole
[1:20:04] church in darkness and the people don't

[1:20:07] preaching normal normal normal but the
[1:20:09] whole church under Darkness who to tell
[1:20:12] them not me I Ain called to do that
[1:20:14] they'll kill
[1:20:16] me okay so he this part now
[1:20:20] Fellowship
[1:20:22] God you take a little more few more
[1:20:25] I 11 pages on page seven we're going
[1:20:28] good God wanting to fellowship with man
[1:20:33] always wanted to do it the Old Testament
[1:20:36] all of it was full of shed blood without
[1:20:38] the sheding blood no of sin so God
[1:20:40] himself cannot deal without this Blood
[1:20:42] thing because man fell it has to have an
[1:20:45] atonement we can't explain that but that
[1:20:48] is how God sees it because he know he's
[1:20:50] coming to to play the blood price to to
[1:20:53] remove sin completely but in the
[1:20:55] meantime he's operating under that
[1:20:57] temporary Covenant of the blood of bulls
[1:20:59] and goats he going to accept that and
[1:21:01] work with that because he have to come
[1:21:03] down in the appointed time to be made
[1:21:04] flesh to pay the price that he could
[1:21:06] enter once forever and kill that dead
[1:21:10] and free us from guilt and shame and the
[1:21:12] past we do have to go once a year hoping
[1:21:14] that God forgive us right Old
[1:21:17] Testament now watch here we go without
[1:21:20] the shedding of blood there's no
[1:21:21] remission of sin and when there's no
[1:21:24] remission of sin sin there's no
[1:21:25] Fellowship that's right so sin breaks
[1:21:28] Fellowship so if Fellowship is broken
[1:21:31] sin is at the
[1:21:33] door sin somewhere near if the
[1:21:36] Fellowship of the Brethren is broken sin
[1:21:38] behind the pulpit then sin in the
[1:21:41] congregation then sin in the group then
[1:21:44] sin somewhere brother Kangle because sin
[1:21:46] affects Fellowship because the blood of
[1:21:49] Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin
[1:21:51] and we have Fellowship one with another
[1:21:56] so if Fellowship is not there one with
[1:21:57] another something is wrong somewhere
[1:21:59] it's not with God it's not with the word
[1:22:01] it's not with the blood it's not with
[1:22:02] the message give the Lord some
[1:22:05] Praises are you with me all right let's
[1:22:10] go where there is no remission of Sin
[1:22:12] Sin there's no Fellowship you have got
[1:22:15] to get away from
[1:22:18] sin you can have fellowship with God
[1:22:21] because God can't fellowship with sin
[1:22:25] you are born a sinner shaped in iniquity
[1:22:28] come to the world speaking lies how can
[1:22:30] you ever do it you might just well quit
[1:22:32] right now to begin with you can't do it
[1:22:34] within yourself but there is one who
[1:22:36] died to bring you to Fellowship back not
[1:22:39] only to Fellowship but to relationship
[1:22:41] with God to make you a son and daughter
[1:22:44] of God so it's more than Fellowship God
[1:22:47] want to bring you into want want to
[1:22:48] bring you into a relationship he died
[1:22:50] for that purpose come here and prove
[1:22:52] himself Emanuel omnipotent praise God
[1:22:55] and when omnipotent speaks the
[1:22:56] miraculous happen now let's go quickly
[1:22:59] now watch the fellowship how Adam and
[1:23:02] Eve they turn away from God because of
[1:23:04] sin had separated them from that
[1:23:06] wonderful marvelous Fellowship it had to
[1:23:09] shift for himself he become a Wanderer
[1:23:12] toss with every wind of Doctrine carried
[1:23:14] away that's the way he stands today out
[1:23:16] of Fellowship out of Harmony away from
[1:23:19] God shifting for himself he creates
[1:23:22] something in his mind that he believes
[1:23:24] that God was I used to talk to the
[1:23:26] people have the god of their own
[1:23:27] imagination they don't have a god of the
[1:23:29] word hallelujah they think have an idea
[1:23:31] what God is God is a a cross God is that
[1:23:33] Jesus on the cross God is at this God is
[1:23:35] at that God is because the man I believe
[1:23:37] God in that man there and I in the right
[1:23:39] place and the right church and they tie
[1:23:40] up god with that man and they tie up god
[1:23:42] with a church and they tie up god with a
[1:23:44] Doctrine God is nothing to that God is
[1:23:45] the word oh give the Lord some Praises

[1:26:13] couldn't make it because some was in her
[1:26:15] heart not her head in
[1:26:16] know not the head the head say go the
[1:26:19] head say Keep On Walking the head say
[1:26:21] don't look back but the heart is one
[1:26:22] move her back there one more look at how
[1:26:24] show the dresses how one more look at
[1:26:26] the lipstick and the earring and all the
[1:26:28] tattoo and all one more look to see what
[1:26:30] she was leaving instead of throwing some
[1:26:32] Dynamite behind and blow up behind you
[1:26:34] don't even look back we have to do that
[1:26:35] you know throw the dynamite and just
[1:26:37] blow up behind you blow the bridge
[1:26:38] behind you devil like you to have Bridge
[1:26:39] you know keeping just in case he needs a
[1:26:41] cross Mar forget that God you a new
[1:26:43] bridge God could get you a new plan all
[1:26:45] together blow up behind
[1:26:50] you man shifting for himself out of
[1:26:54] Fellowship out of Harmony away from God
[1:26:58] so what we saying tonight Adam and Eve
[1:27:00] was in Perfect Harmony because they were
[1:27:02] in the word When sin came that's when
[1:27:05] the call
[1:27:07] stting he said it changed your spirit it
[1:27:10] break the fellowship between them with
[1:27:14] God and with each
[1:27:15] other so if the fellowship with God is
[1:27:17] restored what going to happen with each
[1:27:20] other do you see it now when Adam and
[1:27:24] Eve fell it broke their relationship
[1:27:27] with God a broken relationship with God
[1:27:29] means broken relationship with each
[1:27:33] other so the first thing God has to do
[1:27:35] was to make us to get back a connection
[1:27:37] because when you D no D tone line cut
[1:27:40] sin cut the line what Jesus did by dying
[1:27:43] on the cross was to bring back a new
[1:27:45] line through the blood so now we have
[1:27:48] dial tone and give you a choice to call
[1:27:51] and to respond he not calling he he put
[1:27:53] the call already he don't already call
[1:27:54] you have to respond to the call and once
[1:27:57] you could call him you could call each
[1:27:59] other once you have a fellowship and
[1:28:01] connection with him you can connect with
[1:28:02] each other if you have if you say I have
[1:28:05] no sin you deceive yourself so what
[1:28:07] would make a man not want to Fellowship
[1:28:09] what not there that word for that you
[1:28:10] know it start with P it's called
[1:28:15] Pride people don't want to Humble
[1:28:18] themselves but pride is a dangerous a
[1:28:22] deadly a wicked evil thing because that
[1:28:25] is what Lucifer got in the beginning he
[1:28:27] said I will
[1:28:29] arise I and I not no I and when the eye
[1:28:33] man hit him so he get hit down with ey
[1:28:36] he got the boots and he got kicked out
[1:28:38] pride is a deadly thing you
[1:28:43] know Nicodemus was coming by Night
[1:28:46] know because he didn't want to be seen
[1:28:48] any
[1:28:51] day Pride
[1:28:54] but when that man daughter was dying and
[1:28:57] he brother with anybody else you know he
[1:28:59] know Jesus on a different Road all
[1:29:00] together he said my master master my
[1:29:03] daughter somebody said better to ask him
[1:29:04] she dead now she has died now she's dead
[1:29:07] and Jesus turned and says you see what
[1:29:09] what is he in different realm he said I
[1:29:11] go
[1:29:14] weaker when Lazarus died what did Jesus
[1:29:16] say I'm glad for my sake I was not
[1:29:20] there he knew what he was going to do
[1:29:23] [Applause]
[1:29:25] he's in the
[1:29:27] spirit are you in the
[1:29:29] spirit let's up Mission come up please
[1:29:33] but
[1:29:36] Brandon I was quoting something ago and
[1:29:39] one of the services a little boy that I
[1:29:41] knew of in a certain city who was
[1:29:43] climbing around in the Attic he found a
[1:29:45] little old attic a Garett old trunk
[1:29:47] digging to the trunk he found a little
[1:29:48] yellow posted stamp it was a yellow from
[1:29:51] age he taken it over to the stamp
[1:29:53] collecting friend and he said said how
[1:29:54] much will you give me for this stamp he
[1:29:57] was expecting 5 or 10 cents and perhaps
[1:29:59] an ice cream core in his
[1:30:01] mind he looked it over the collector he
[1:30:03] knew it was valuable stamp he said I'll
[1:30:05] give you a dollar bill for it that was a
[1:30:07] good quick sale for the little lad he
[1:30:10] collected a dollar the stamp collection
[1:30:11] taken the stamp down the street he went
[1:30:13] for ice cream the stamp collector began
[1:30:16] to work on the stamp a few weeks later
[1:30:18] he sold it for
[1:30:20] $500 then a little after that it was
[1:30:23] sold for 3,000
[1:30:25] and they say it's worth a quarter of a
[1:30:27] million dollar you see it wasn't the
[1:30:30] little yellow
[1:30:32] paper because you wouldn't even have
[1:30:34] picked it up if it was on the street but
[1:30:38] what made it so valuable was what was
[1:30:40] root on that little yellow
[1:30:43] paper and that's the way it is tonight
[1:30:46] it's just a piece of paper not very
[1:30:48] valuable paper but it's what's wrote in
[1:30:50] it have so much value because it is the
[1:30:54] word of God and Heaven will pass away
[1:30:56] but that word will never pass away a man
[1:31:01] is just as good as his word you are just
[1:31:04] as good as your word I am just as good
[1:31:06] as my word if I can't take your word I
[1:31:08] want no dealings with you I want you to
[1:31:10] be the same to me and we must be the
[1:31:12] same to God if he can keep his word then
[1:31:15] I want to know who is God that can keep
[1:31:18] his word so he said have faith in God
[1:31:21] faith is a common thing like we reads
[1:31:24] like like his up you try to press it out
[1:31:27] make it something that no one can take a
[1:31:29] hold of it's so simple but
[1:31:32] BR God humbles
[1:31:34] himself God is
[1:31:37] humility what say the first sign of the
[1:31:39] Holy Ghost first not second not third
[1:31:42] not fourth the first sign of the Holy
[1:31:44] Ghost is
[1:31:46] humility somebody who's willing to
[1:31:48] Humble themselves somebody will to say
[1:31:49] I'm wrong I'm
[1:31:52] sorry the man that can humble himself is
[1:31:55] on his Road
[1:31:57] up he that exalts himself is on the road
[1:32:00] down that groups of Pastor Elder Deacon
[1:32:05] regardless of who it is you see somebody
[1:32:07] proud and
[1:32:08] arrogant they're on their way down
[1:32:11] regardless of what status they have they
[1:32:13] could have the best in pool house land
[1:32:15] car plane whatever they're on their way
[1:32:17] down the one who humble themselves
[1:32:19] they're on the way up we must remember
[1:32:22] that Christianity is not pushing ahead
[1:32:24] trying to get ahead of this fellow but
[1:32:25] stepping back taking the backseat let
[1:32:28] the other fellow go humble
[1:32:32] yourself if they sue you at the court
[1:32:34] take your coat give them the cloak also
[1:32:36] if they compel you to go a mile go two
[1:32:38] smash you One Cheek turn the other he
[1:32:40] was our example in every way that we
[1:32:43] should
[1:32:45] be
[1:32:48] brandham he decided to took blood Adam
[1:32:51] and Eve tried to make a fig Leaf apron
[1:32:52] it wouldn't do required blood blood and
[1:32:54] he said now watch and he will never
[1:32:57] change he never changes and when it come
[1:33:00] a time a person was sick and wanted to
[1:33:01] be healed by God God healed them on the
[1:33:04] same basis in faith I'm almost done and
[1:33:07] any word that God says here we go it can
[1:33:09] never change now that's the reason I
[1:33:11] believe the Bible is just the way it's
[1:33:13] written it can never be changed we can't
[1:33:16] find nothing better God cannot he's
[1:33:19] infinite we are finite we make mistakes
[1:33:21] and tomorrow we know that we know today
[1:33:24] more than we know today but not God he's
[1:33:26] Eternal infinite omnipotent omnipresent
[1:33:28] omnicient he is God if he isn't those
[1:33:30] things then he isn't God he's finite
[1:33:33] like we are so we must remember he is
[1:33:35] God his words are and that's part of him
[1:33:37] you've heard me say every man is good at
[1:33:39] his word God is no better than his word
[1:33:42] so in the beginning was the word word
[1:33:44] was with God and the Word was God last
[1:33:50] quot you see the attribute sons of his
[1:33:55] Spirit have not yet entered into the
[1:33:57] word formed
[1:33:59] body the difference between him and you
[1:34:02] as a son he was at the beginning the
[1:34:05] word and in morphe body he came in and
[1:34:09] lived in that in the person of mzc then
[1:34:13] later we never heard no more mzc because
[1:34:15] he become Jesus Christ melz was a priest
[1:34:19] but he became Jesus Christ now you
[1:34:21] bypass that because in that form he
[1:34:24] knowed all things but you have never
[1:34:26] been able to know that yet you come like
[1:34:29] Adam like me you became from attribute
[1:34:32] to flesh to be tempted but when this
[1:34:35] life is finished here if this earthy Tac
[1:34:38] could be dissolved we have one already
[1:34:40] waiting that is where we go that is the
[1:34:42] word then we can look back and see what
[1:34:45] we have done now we don't understand it
[1:34:47] we have never become the word we just
[1:34:50] become flesh man not the word but but
[1:34:53] look clearly it makes it clear you will
[1:34:56] never be the word unless you were the
[1:34:57] thought at the beginning that proves the
[1:35:01] predestination of God you can't be the
[1:35:03] word unless you were a thought you have
[1:35:06] to be in his thinking so if you have to
[1:35:08] believe tonight that you are part of
[1:35:10] this bright body you have to believe you
[1:35:12] are part of God's thinking that is why
[1:35:14] you connect with this word you see in
[1:35:17] order to stand Temptation you have to
[1:35:19] bypass theophany you have to come down
[1:35:21] here in flesh to be tempted by sin Oh
[1:35:25] Glory to God you byass it off and become
[1:35:28] a flesh man to be tempted by sin Oh
[1:35:32] Glory to God hallelujah but when this
[1:35:35] body received the spirit of God the
[1:35:37] immortal Immortal Life inside of you it
[1:35:40] CHS this body in
[1:35:42] subjection hallelujah hallelujah there
[1:35:44] you are it CHS your body in subjection
[1:35:47] you don't have to say if I could quit
[1:35:49] drinking if I could quit this just get
[1:35:51] into Christ and it's gone because your
[1:35:53] body is subject to that Spirit let's all
[1:35:56] stand and give go praise to
[1:36:03] God
[1:36:05] Jesus pay it
[1:36:11] all
[1:36:13] oh to
[1:36:15] him I

[1:37:26] without one
