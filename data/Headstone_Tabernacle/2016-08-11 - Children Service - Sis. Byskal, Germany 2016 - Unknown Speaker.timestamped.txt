[17:09] adore
[17:10] them um I have 26 or 27 great
[17:16] grandchildren the oldest is 15 so you
[17:20] know how I love the little children so I
[17:24] just want to give you a little bit of my
[17:26] background and I've already already been
[17:29] instructed to speak slowly for the sake
[17:32] of the uh translators at the
[17:35] back and um so I'll give you a little
[17:39] bit of my
[17:41] background uh I was born in a very small
[17:45] town in Northern British Columbia
[17:49] Canada and in the wilderness
[17:53] practically and I was about 700 kilomet
[17:59] from the nearest small City by Gravel
[18:04] Road and um my father was a
[18:08] businessman and I was growing up with
[18:13] everything I needed he was well to
[18:16] do he had a large department
[18:20] store and uh uh I had everything I
[18:25] wanted and I wanted nothing
[18:30] and
[18:32] um when I was about four years old I
[18:37] heard the name of Jesus for the first
[18:39] time my parents were not
[18:42] Christians and the first song I remember
[18:46] was the great
[18:49] physician and when I heard that
[18:56] name the sweetest
[18:59] name on Mortal
[19:02] tongue I never forgot
[19:05] it Jesus Precious
[19:08] Jesus I was so little but I I remember
[19:12] it Jesus Precious
[19:16] Jesus and right across from my father's
[19:19] store was a little gospel
[19:23] church and because I was the youngest in
[19:27] the family and my brother and sister
[19:29] were much older than I I was allowed to
[19:33] pretty much do what I
[19:34] wanted and I started to go to Sunday
[19:38] school when I was about
[19:41] six and from then on I I joined myself
[19:46] to that pastor's children
[19:50] and I I learned the
[19:53] scriptures I learned the Sunday school
[19:56] songs there
[19:58] I I lived in that church pretty much
[20:02] with that family back and
[20:04] forth and from a very small child I
[20:08] learned every gospel song I could every
[20:13] little Sunday school song I could and to
[20:16] this day I remember the Psalms that I
[20:22] memorized and I want to say to you
[20:24] little
[20:25] children learn as much scripture as you
[20:30] can as soon as you can it will hold you
[20:34] through
[20:35] life I remember standing in the church
[20:38] as just a very young girl and
[20:41] saying Thy word have I hid in my heart
[20:45] that I might not sin against thee I
[20:48] didn't really know what it meant but it
[20:51] held me through my young
[20:54] years and the word the scripture let the
[20:58] words of my mouth and the meditation of
[21:01] my heart be acceptable in my thy sight
[21:05] oh Lord my strength and my
[21:10] redeemer I those words still echo in my
[21:13] heart and mind to this
[21:16] day let thy words be a meditation in my
[21:20] heart and may they be pleasing to thee
[21:23] Oh
[21:25] Lord and I say to the parents
[21:29] even though my parents didn't teach me
[21:31] any of that yet I loved the word of God
[21:36] and it held
[21:38] me and one day when I was 13 years old
[21:44] in 1949 it was the fall of the year in
[21:49] September a man came to
[21:54] hunt and he came through Dawson Creek at
[21:57] the in in invitation of some of the
[21:59] farmers and
[22:01] ranchers I don't know how he got there
[22:05] it was a long distance I don't know
[22:08] maybe he came partway by
[22:11] plane uh the roads were were
[22:15] terrible uh but he he came through and
[22:18] he was asked to speak one night at the
[22:21] little Gospel
[22:23] Church I'd never heard his name there
[22:25] were only about 50 people
[22:28] in the
[22:30] church and of course I was there sitting
[22:33] in the back
[22:35] row and when he finished
[22:39] speaking I moved out the back double
[22:43] doors and uh I people hung their clothes
[22:48] there in the little part of the church
[22:50] at the
[22:52] back and as the doors opened I I stood
[22:56] behind the door
[22:58] out of the way as people began to move
[23:03] out and I wanted to stay out of the
[23:07] way and so I got right behind the door
[23:11] and I just stood
[23:12] there and then this man walked out with
[23:15] the crowd he was shaking
[23:18] hands it was brother
[23:21] Bram I didn't know who he
[23:24] was and as he moved out with the crowd
[23:28] he
[23:30] stopped looked behind the
[23:33] door saw me standing there took my
[23:38] hand and it was a scripture he said to
[23:41] me and he said little
[23:44] sister God bless
[23:46] you if you will commit your way unto the
[23:50] Lord he'll give you the desires of your
[23:54] heart at that moment I
[23:59] something just enfolded me in the
[24:02] sweetest
[24:04] presence I knew that I had been touched
[24:08] by something
[24:10] Supernatural a voice from from the
[24:15] eternities and I
[24:17] wept I stood there behind the door
[24:21] weeping brother Brandon moved on out I
[24:25] didn't know who he was what it was I
[24:28] just knew that I had been
[24:31] enfolded in something from eternity that
[24:34] I had never experienced in my life and I
[24:38] stood there weeping while everybody left
[24:42] and went
[24:43] out and I've never forgotten that
[24:47] moment and I I am so thankful for that
[24:52] encounter and as I grew up I wanted
[24:57] nothing of the
[24:59] world I had every opportunity that I
[25:02] could have possibly been
[25:05] given um I
[25:08] had I had many friends in
[25:11] school they did things that I didn't
[25:13] want to be a part
[25:15] of of course there was a a young boy
[25:20] that came to the church every once in a
[25:23] while because he was in this home and
[25:28] that home and had no home
[25:31] actually and that was brother
[25:35] Ed and I I liked
[25:37] him and somebody said to me the pastor's
[25:41] daughter actually I was 10 years old and
[25:44] one day she said to me Ruth do you like
[25:48] Eddie he likes you and I wasn't the
[25:53] least bit interested in any boy at that
[25:56] time my whole life was was cats kittens
[25:59] dogs horses you know anything to do with
[26:02] the
[26:03] farm and he wasn't interested in any any
[26:06] girls either so but that was from that
[26:10] moment on our lives did become
[26:15] entwined through because of the gospel
[26:18] and our interest in things relating to
[26:21] spiritual
[26:22] things and
[26:24] I became very interested in
[26:28] in
[26:29] skating I I would skate in Winter
[26:33] carnivals and uh because we lived in the
[26:37] north uh it was cold so six month of
[26:41] winter I spent on the
[26:44] ice and uh one day the Pastor said to me
[26:49] Ruth is this something that a Christian
[26:53] girl should be
[26:55] doing and just that one
[26:59] word caused me to drop it right there I
[27:04] never went back to that entertainment
[27:08] again from that
[27:10] moment something in my heart it was I
[27:13] don't understand it I never
[27:16] struggled with those things
[27:18] again it just it dropped I had no
[27:21] interest in those
[27:24] things and even the the movies or
[27:27] anything like that I just I had no
[27:31] interest in it it just seemed like my
[27:33] interest was towards God and I I look
[27:38] back at that moment when brother
[27:39] brandham said if you'll commit your way
[27:42] unto the Lord he'll give you the desires
[27:45] of your
[27:46] heart and as the years went on I
[27:50] realized my
[27:52] desire was for the Lord that's what I
[27:56] desired it wasn't the desires for things
[28:01] or it was for him my desire was for for
[28:06] him and I had a a
[28:10] stubborn
[28:12] streak but my stubborn streak was no one
[28:16] is going to make me do something that is
[28:19] going to displease the
[28:21] Lord and I I'm very thankful for
[28:25] that and um
[28:30] when brother
[28:32] Bram began to have a contact with my
[28:37] husband uh that brought me into contact
[28:40] with him as
[28:42] well um and he would come up north to go
[28:47] hunting at various
[28:49] times and um one time in the spring he
[28:55] had come up and was hunting with my
[28:57] husband husband and uh he had they had
[29:01] gotten a a bear on one hunt and they
[29:04] were coming back to Dawson
[29:06] Creek and I was staying with my sister
[29:11] and uh our girls were young I think
[29:14] Linda was about N9 or
[29:16] 10 the oldest girl and we were waiting
[29:21] for them to
[29:22] come and uh they arrived and dropped the
[29:26] the bear hide off at my sister's
[29:29] house and then as we stood just at the
[29:32] side of the
[29:34] street the girls began to sing for
[29:37] him and they could sing some of the
[29:41] Native Canadian Indian songs so I
[29:45] believe they sang couple of songs in the
[29:48] native Indian
[29:50] language and uh I think he took off his
[29:55] hat he said um
[29:58] now we've uh had the song
[30:02] service and now we'll take up the
[30:04] offering and he reached in his pocket
[30:07] and put a few coins in there and gave
[30:11] them to the girls and he said you know
[30:13] now you can buy yourself some ice cream
[30:15] or chocolate bars or something we've had
[30:18] the song service now here's the
[30:21] offering and they remember that very
[30:26] clearly um
[30:29] not long after that um we were living in
[30:33] southern British Columbia in Victoria we
[30:36] were getting ready for brother brandham
[30:38] to come to port alurn and Victoria for
[30:43] meetings and by this time um my husband
[30:47] was not welcome in the undenominational
[30:52] churches so as we prepared for the
[30:55] meetings we were doing it by our
[30:57] ourselves all the
[30:59] advertising all the preparation of
[31:02] whatever building we were going to
[31:04] have and uh just before that my father
[31:10] who was about 64 years
[31:12] old had a very severe heart attack in
[31:17] Dawson Creek and um the main artery of
[31:21] his
[31:22] heart ruptured
[31:24] out and his doctor
[31:28] called my husband and said I think you'd
[31:31] better send Ruth up he's not going to
[31:34] live through
[31:36] this and so I I went up to Dawson Creek
[31:40] it's about um a th000 kilometers I'd
[31:45] say and I was allowed to stand by his
[31:49] bed for 10 minutes the day not speak to
[31:54] him but just stand there
[31:58] and I was there for a few days then I
[32:01] had to go back to Victoria because of
[32:04] the preparation for the meetings and I
[32:06] was terribly burdened for him
[32:10] heavy-hearted
[32:12] and then we began to prepare for the
[32:15] meetings and besides bearing the load of
[32:19] the advertising the the building and all
[32:24] those
[32:26] things my heart was so heavy I wanted
[32:29] while we waited for brother brandom to
[32:31] come and he came and he was in a motel
[32:35] and I wanted so
[32:37] desperately to speak to him ask him tell
[32:41] him about my father ask him if he would
[32:44] pray but there was no opportunity he he
[32:48] was waiting on God in the motel and then
[32:51] he'd come to the meeting and I was
[32:53] playing the piano and and then he'd
[32:56] leave the the platform and go back to
[32:58] the motel and it was just every day like
[33:01] that and I was just
[33:03] longing and and then we went to Victoria
[33:07] and carried on with the meetings there
[33:09] and and there was no help from anyone
[33:13] none of the churches in fact for
[33:17] Victoria the Anglican
[33:20] Church of Canada gave us one of their
[33:25] organists who came came forward and
[33:27] played the organ for the meetings if you
[33:30] can imagine not even a Christian or a
[33:33] Believer she came forward to play the
[33:36] organ and um so then after those
[33:40] meetings were
[33:41] over and uh we were at the motel
[33:46] outside and brother brandom was talking
[33:49] to my husband and just
[33:51] saying the departing words it's been
[33:55] wonderful to be here we're thankful for
[33:58] what the Lord has done and maybe we'll
[34:01] see you again and we're just they were
[34:03] just saying a few parting words I was
[34:06] standing about this far to there
[34:10] quietly just under the lights of the
[34:14] motel and brother brandom turned to me
[34:17] and
[34:19] said by the way sister bisc your father
[34:23] will be all
[34:25] right
[34:30] and there was
[34:33] no big
[34:35] shouting
[34:37] clapping
[34:39] jumping just that
[34:41] Serene
[34:44] peace and from that
[34:47] moment my father who was his life
[34:51] hanging on a
[34:53] thread
[34:55] improved and for the next 20 years there
[35:00] was not an
[35:02] indication that there had ever been
[35:06] anything wrong with his
[35:09] heart
[35:14] he he had a an examination every year
[35:19] and the attending specialist said if I
[35:23] had not been the attending doctor
[35:27] I could never tell that you had ever had
[35:31] anything wrong with your
[35:33] heart and when he passed away at 84
[35:37] years old 20 years later he simply
[35:41] passed away from old
[35:44] age and not only that he died a
[35:49] Believer and from that
[35:53] moment from that moment my family who
[35:57] had never gone to
[36:01] church my mother was saved and baptized
[36:05] at
[36:07] 82 my sister was saved and baptized at
[36:11] about
[36:13] 50 my brother was saved at 90 years
[36:18] old never go had a chance to be baptized
[36:22] but was
[36:24] saved and my whole family family one at
[36:27] a
[36:28] time by God's grace
[36:32] somehow came in so never never give up
[36:36] on your family just hold them before the
[36:40] Lord even if they're not anywhere around
[36:43] you they can be hundreds of kilometers
[36:46] away just hold them before the Lord and
[36:49] God's promise and he'll work it out
[36:53] he'll bring
[36:55] them so I'm I'm thankful for
[36:59] that I wanted to say
[37:02] about my contact with brother Bram is
[37:06] just a natural way just
[37:10] um I think you can call it just his
[37:13] natural
[37:15] Association uh once or twice we were
[37:18] down in Jeffersonville just maybe a for
[37:21] a day or two
[37:23] visit um like brother George was talking
[37:27] this morning about the natural
[37:30] man uh we were we visited once and and
[37:34] uh the girls and I were riding in the
[37:37] back of his car he had taken us out for
[37:41] lunch and um the windows were
[37:46] down and the wind was blowing and he
[37:49] said oh quickly roll up the windows we
[37:53] don't want to the wind to blow the
[37:56] ladies
[37:59] hair so he was mindful of all these
[38:02] little things you know maybe he wouldn't
[38:05] think a man would
[38:08] be and uh then we he took us for lunch
[38:11] to a to a restaurant and we're walking
[38:15] down the street he's got two of the
[38:17] girls by the hand and he's just talking
[38:20] to them and asking their name and um one
[38:24] of them is Joanne the youngest girl and
[38:27] he says what is your name she's 5 years
[38:31] old and she says uh
[38:34] Joanne he said oh that's a good strong
[38:38] name he said let me see I think you're
[38:43] going to be a
[38:45] singer and sure enough we always said
[38:48] she had lungs like
[38:51] leather but in recently in the last uh
[38:56] two two or three years she had an
[38:59] incurable
[39:01] disease and never spoke of it we never
[39:03] spoke of it it was a it's a disease that
[39:07] gradually hardens the lining of the
[39:09] lungs and other parts of of the body are
[39:14] affected and then in February she got um
[39:19] respiratory pneumonia she had a weakened
[39:22] condition
[39:23] anyway and I will just make this very
[39:26] short
[39:27] she ended up in in the
[39:32] emergency of the hospital hanging on a
[39:37] thread and we were
[39:39] away and one night we were trying we
[39:43] were trying to get uh plane tickets to
[39:48] rush home because we knew that that she
[39:52] was very very low and uh in the night
[39:57] I was
[39:58] praying and I reminded the
[40:01] Lord I said
[40:03] Lord your Prophet
[40:06] said
[40:08] Joanne I believe you're going to be a
[40:12] singer and I'm holding you to that
[40:15] promise she cannot sing unless her lungs
[40:19] are
[40:21] perfect and we came
[40:24] home and within a few few days God
[40:28] provided
[40:31] miraculously the top specialist I would
[40:35] say in Canada who came to the Forefront
[40:42] overnight actually called
[40:45] her at 9:30 one
[40:48] night and said
[40:50] Joan this is Dr
[40:54] stoer you don't sound
[40:57] good and I will meet you at the hospital
[41:00] in the
[41:02] morning Joanne couldn't even breathe she
[41:07] said how did you call me why are you
[41:10] calling me did my father call you H how
[41:14] are you calling me anyway by next
[41:18] morning Joanne had a team of four
[41:22] Specialists tending to her and
[41:27] I we just firmly believe that that whole
[41:30] thing happened for the sake of that
[41:32] doctor and her
[41:34] salvation and we know that it will it
[41:37] will turn out that
[41:39] way so we're very thankful for
[41:43] that and I think there's so much more
[41:47] that I
[41:48] could
[41:50] probably say if I could remember it
[41:53] right
[41:55] now
[41:57] um for you young girls young
[42:02] men I would just say to you what what
[42:06] those words that brother brandom spoke
[42:08] to me commit your way unto the
[42:12] Lord and he he will give you the desires
[42:15] of your
[42:16] heart you know it pays it pays to commit
[42:21] everything to the Lord commit your way
[42:22] to
[42:24] him follow him
[42:27] turn from the world it's not there's
[42:30] nothing out there for you not a
[42:34] thing and
[42:36] U even the little children read your
[42:40] Bible and
[42:41] pray the Bible is the most precious
[42:45] book when I was a young child I used to

[51:39] afternoon amen and before amen I'll I'll
[51:42] mention my title I will address the
[51:45] first question of the little children
[51:47] because I know when my children when
[51:49] they were smaller and when we were
[51:50] driving up to church I cannot remember
[51:53] they ever asked me Daddy what is your
[51:55] title
[51:56] they never asked me Daddy what scripture
[51:58] you're going to read but they said Daddy
[52:01] how long are you going to
[52:03] preach so let me answer that question
[52:05] for you little children amen I'm only
[52:07] going to speak 20
[52:09] minutes amen but 20 minutes is enough
[52:12] for God to touch your heart hey because
[52:15] one day when brother Brenham was here
[52:16] there was a dead a little fish amen that
[52:20] was dead on the lake amen and in about
[52:22] 28 minutes or so that dead fish turned
[52:25] back to life so 20 minutes is enough
[52:28] that God can bless and touch your heart
[52:30] this afternoon amen so just relax in the
[52:32] spirit I'm just going to direct amen
[52:35] these few words to the children the
[52:37] young people and parents amen you can
[52:40] say Amen you can amen pray for the
[52:42] children amen as you feel that but am
[52:44] I'm just going to speak to the children
[52:47] amen something that the King of Kings
[52:49] told me to
[52:51] do amen because amen the King of Kings
[52:54] has a secret
[52:55] message that is revealed and belongs to
[52:58] the
[52:59] children amen thus sayth the Bible amen
[53:03] the secret things belong unto God but
[53:06] once they are revealed they belong to us
[53:08] and to our
[53:10] children that we may fulfill every word
[53:14] in this
[53:15] Bible amen so as a title for a few
[53:18] moments I'm going to speak children on
[53:21] The Secret Message of the
[53:23] king and our King is
[53:27] Jehovah he's the king of
[53:30] kings amen he's the greatest King there
[53:33] is amen he's the only King and he has a
[53:37] secret message for you
[53:41] children amen glory to God Amen it's a
[53:44] secret message that has been revealed
[53:47] and that is now belonging to you
[53:50] children and I Pray by the end of these
[53:53] few words that you can say this message
[53:56] that I heard about in these meetings is
[53:58] my
[54:00] message it's not just the message amen
[54:03] for for brother Brenham it's not the
[54:06] message just for my parents it's not the
[54:09] message for my older brother or sister
[54:11] but it is my
[54:15] message amen it is the most important
[54:18] message that you will ever hear
[54:21] children and it is a message that the
[54:25] devil knows nothing
[54:27] about but the King of Kings has it for
[54:34] you it's a message that was hidden
[54:37] before the foundation of the
[54:39] world and it's a message of
[54:44] Grace and it's a secret message it
[54:48] expresses and reveals the hidden and the
[54:52] secret desires of the king of kings
[54:57] the only thing that our King of Kings
[55:00] wants is expressed in that secret
[55:05] message the only desire he had was he
[55:09] wanted a
[55:13] family Jehovah wanted fellowship with
[55:16] his
[55:18] family and he wanted some more Sons and
[55:22] Daughters of God into his image
[55:27] that was the desire of the king of
[55:31] kings he now the enemy Satan did not
[55:35] like that
[55:37] desire because the devil has enough
[55:39] problem with God
[55:41] alone so the devil is afraid what if
[55:44] there will be more Sons and Daughters of
[55:46] God coming on the
[55:50] scene but God said that is my
[55:54] desire amen I want a
[55:58] family I want sons and daughters of God
[56:02] just like
[56:04] me just in my
[56:07] image amen so it had to become a secret
[56:12] message because the enemy the devil
[56:14] would do everything he can to destroy
[56:16] that
[56:17] purpose to destroy that
[56:20] message but I have good news for you the
[56:23] devil failed
[56:27] and the devil will not stop that secret
[56:29] message from coming to your heart and
[56:32] accomplishing its
[56:35] purpose amen say Amen somebody
[56:39] amen amen glory to God Amen so all God
[56:43] wanted was to reproduce his original
[56:46] life in some Sons and Daughters of
[56:50] God that was his desire that was his
[56:53] purpose that was his
[56:56] plan and that's why God spoke it in
[57:00] Genesis 1:
[57:01] 126 he said let us make man into our own
[57:05] image and let them have
[57:08] dominion and once it was spoken it has
[57:12] to come to
[57:13] pass but it was a
[57:16] secret the devil heard that read that
[57:19] scripture and says how will it ever
[57:22] happen but it was a secret message
[57:25] message that God Amen had for his people
[57:29] including his little
[57:31] children amen so that message amen that
[57:34] secret message let me tell you young
[57:36] people it is stop
[57:39] secret many people wish they could be
[57:42] here and hear the
[57:45] message many people wish they could hear
[57:48] amen and then the message from our King
[57:50] of
[57:51] Kings but it was a top secrets but thank
[57:55] God he gave us a prophet to reveal it
[57:58] and now once it's revealed it belongs to
[58:00] you
[58:03] children amen so that message that
[58:06] secret
[58:07] mission and message was so important to
[58:10] him so
[58:12] precious amen that he hided it in
[58:17] Simplicity brother Brenham said he said
[58:21] when God revealed that secret message to
[58:23] brother Brenham he said oh you don't
[58:25] know what this message means to
[58:29] me and I just pray it touches your heart
[58:32] this afternoon in the same way that you
[58:34] can begin to declare this is my secret
[58:38] message that has been revealed but it is
[58:42] mine amen because we see that amen that
[58:45] message it was amen put in
[58:49] secret John heard the message but God
[58:52] said John don't write
[58:53] it Daniel heard the message God told
[58:57] Daniel don't write
[58:59] it but God knew there would be a prophet
[59:02] in the last days that would reveal every
[59:06] mystery and it would reveal and live out
[59:10] that secret
[59:13] message amen hallelujah God would reveal
[59:16] it through a humble
[59:18] prophet and he would reveal and hide it
[59:21] into nobodies like you and I
[59:26] a secret message for simple people like
[59:29] you and I to run with that
[59:33] message cuz see young people children
[59:37] God has put us in a
[59:40] race and brother bam talks about that
[59:42] race and he said one day there was a
[59:45] contest and he said all that he they
[59:49] gathered some young children and he said
[59:52] what they had to do they were given a
[59:54] word
[59:55] and they had to run from that let's say
[59:58] from there to
[1:00:00] there and before they started running
[1:00:03] they got a
[1:00:05] word and the only thing that mattered
[1:00:08] when they made it to the other Aon
[1:00:10] site the only question that was asked it
[1:00:14] was do you remember and do you have the
[1:00:21] password and brother Ram tells many
[1:00:23] children ran and there was a boy he was
[1:00:26] running and he came the
[1:00:30] first but he
[1:00:32] arrived and the referee asked do you
[1:00:35] remember the pause
[1:00:37] word do you remember the message I've
[1:00:39] given
[1:00:41] you and the boy had forgotten
[1:00:45] it and the referee said I'm
[1:00:49] sorry and there was another boy he had a
[1:00:52] hard time to run he was falling up up
[1:00:54] and down once in a while he didn't take
[1:00:57] the shortest way to run from here to
[1:00:59] there but when he made it and the
[1:01:02] referee said what is the
[1:01:05] password he had the right word for his
[1:01:10] day so the question is not going to be
[1:01:13] have we run the
[1:01:16] fastest children the question will not
[1:01:18] be have you never fallen have you never
[1:01:21] have you had your UPS or Downs
[1:01:25] the question will not be did you take
[1:01:26] the shortest
[1:01:28] way but the question will be have you
[1:01:32] heard and
[1:01:33] recognized and acted upon my secret
[1:01:43] message blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:01:46] the Bible says Jesus said when I come
[1:01:50] back will I find
[1:01:53] fate that's the only thing that God is
[1:01:56] looking
[1:01:58] for that's the only question he's going
[1:02:00] to ask
[1:02:02] you when I come back will I find
[1:02:07] faith will I find back that original
[1:02:11] fate that I sent a prophet forth to
[1:02:15] restore will I find back that perfect
[1:02:18] Fai that Jesus
[1:02:21] had and I don't know about you
[1:02:24] but I'm saying yes
[1:02:26] Lord you will find that
[1:02:31] fate because that original faith is my
[1:02:36] message and I just pray that you can
[1:02:38] have the same
[1:02:41] testimony glory to God because God needs
[1:02:45] you
[1:02:46] children young children young people God
[1:02:49] needs you to fulfill his
[1:02:53] desire
[1:02:55] when the devil tells you you're not
[1:02:57] important when the devil tells you this
[1:02:59] is only for my parents and for my church
[1:03:02] that devil is a
[1:03:05] liar because God needs each one of you
[1:03:08] little children to fulfill his
[1:03:13] desire he chose you to complete that
[1:03:15] mission and fulfill the desires of his
[1:03:21] heart amen but he put it in a secret
[1:03:24] message to make sure that nobody could
[1:03:27] do damage to
[1:03:29] it and he wrote The Message in a secret
[1:03:35] language and he gave it to Adam in the
[1:03:38] Garden of
[1:03:41] Eden and every evening Jehovah would
[1:03:43] come down in the evening and he would
[1:03:46] come and fellowship with
[1:03:48] Adam he had given Adam that secret
[1:03:51] message he had given him the book and
[1:03:54] every evening they would have
[1:03:55] fellowship and God would just unfold
[1:03:59] that secret message to
[1:04:02] Adam and as Jehovah and Adam were
[1:04:06] fellowshipping they were
[1:04:08] fellowshipping in a secret
[1:04:11] language they were fellowshipping in the
[1:04:14] original
[1:04:18] language now some of you may think that
[1:04:21] the oldest language in the world is
[1:04:23] Latin or maybe it's Greek or maybe it's
[1:04:27] Hebrew or maybe it's
[1:04:30] Egyptian amen there's lots of debates on
[1:04:33] the internet who what is the oldest
[1:04:35] language I'm going to tell you what is
[1:04:37] the oldest
[1:04:38] language the oldest original language
[1:04:41] there is is the spoken word of
[1:04:47] God because the first language that was
[1:04:49] ever recorded is in Genesis 1 and God
[1:04:52] said let there be
[1:04:56] amen and that was the language that Adam
[1:05:00] spoke and that was the the language that
[1:05:03] Jehovah
[1:05:04] spoke and what a fellowship they had
[1:05:08] what a communion they had as they spoke
[1:05:11] on that fellow in that
[1:05:14] language and God was just they were just
[1:05:16] fellowshipping on that secret
[1:05:20] message amen glory to God this
[1:05:24] language is so special it is so secret
[1:05:29] it is so original that the devil will
[1:05:31] never know
[1:05:34] it but here is the good thing the only
[1:05:38] thing the devil can do with that
[1:05:40] language is obey
[1:05:45] it the devil will never speak that
[1:05:48] language he will never understand that
[1:05:52] language but when we speak that that
[1:05:54] language the devil has no choice but he
[1:05:57] has to
[1:06:01] obey and God has that secret language
[1:06:03] for you
[1:06:06] children amen but we see in the Bible
[1:06:09] amen how amen Adam amen he lost that
[1:06:13] secret language he lost that secret
[1:06:15] message because he doubted they in one
[1:06:18] word just one word from the password was
[1:06:23] missing but that did not change God's
[1:06:25] original
[1:06:28] desire that did not change God's
[1:06:30] thoughts about you and
[1:06:33] I God said my desire is I will have a
[1:06:39] family I will have sons and daughters in
[1:06:44] my
[1:06:46] image I will have little children that
[1:06:49] look just like
[1:06:51] me I will have teenagers that speak just
[1:06:55] like
[1:06:58] me blessed be the name of the
[1:07:00] Lord and when Adam lost that secret
[1:07:04] message the devil was standing there and
[1:07:06] he wanted to take it he said maybe I can
[1:07:09] get it now but before the Satan could
[1:07:13] get the secret message God took it back
[1:07:17] because that secret message does not
[1:07:19] belong to the devil but belongs to God's
[1:07:22] children God took it
[1:07:25] back sealed it up in a little book and
[1:07:28] kept it at his right
[1:07:30] hand because that was his
[1:07:33] desire that was the greatest the the
[1:07:37] greatest desire and dreams and wishes
[1:07:40] and plans that God
[1:07:42] had that was so precious to
[1:07:45] him that he said I'll I'll hold it in my
[1:07:48] right
[1:07:49] hand till there's going to come a
[1:07:52] time when I'm going to reveal it back to
[1:07:56] my
[1:07:58] people amen glory to God Amen so he
[1:08:03] sealed it in a in a little book sealed
[1:08:04] with Seven
[1:08:06] Seals amen and you can am we heard in
[1:08:08] Revelations 5 when John was looking he
[1:08:12] saw god with that little book with that
[1:08:14] secret
[1:08:15] message and John was
[1:08:17] weeping he said oh if I could only hear
[1:08:22] and and and read that secret message
[1:08:26] again if I could only get to that secret
[1:08:28] message
[1:08:30] again but the Bible says nobody was
[1:08:34] worthy to take the book even to look
[1:08:36] upon it you see how precious this
[1:08:42] is amen hallelujah but when John said
[1:08:45] aen he said amen when John was there
[1:08:48] crying all of a sudden he heard somebody
[1:08:50] saying weep not
[1:08:52] John the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[1:08:56] prevailed
[1:08:58] Hallelujah and out of Eternity stepped a
[1:09:01] bleedy bloody
[1:09:03] lamb that said I am worthy to take that
[1:09:09] book to lose to make it open
[1:09:15] again and to go and reveal it to my
[1:09:20] people and you and mean we can read in
[1:09:23] the book of Revelations that John when
[1:09:25] he could see that secret message again
[1:09:28] he was so happy he was so filled with
[1:09:32] joy cuz he said this is my secret
[1:09:38] message John did not care about anybody
[1:09:41] else but he said this is my secret
[1:09:45] message amen glory to God Amen so we
[1:09:49] thank God that God did not change his
[1:09:51] thoughts but out of Eternity Ste the
[1:09:54] bleedy bloody Lamb of
[1:09:56] God Amen and that was worthy to open the
[1:10:00] book amen and to bring it down to the
[1:10:03] Earth to continue the secret
[1:10:08] mission to bring God's people into Sons
[1:10:13] and Daughters of God into his own
[1:10:16] image amen and God revealed it to a
[1:10:19] humble
[1:10:20] Prophet amen and that Mighty angel came
[1:10:24] down in
[1:10:26] secret and hided himself in a
[1:10:30] prophet to reveal that secret
[1:10:34] message and when a prophet was called
[1:10:37] home as we heard this morning when the
[1:10:39] prophet was called of the scene that
[1:10:42] Mighty Angel stayed
[1:10:45] behind amen because that secret message
[1:10:49] was had to fulfill its
[1:10:52] purpose amen the Bible says in Exodus
[1:10:56] behold I've sent my angel before you to
[1:11:00] keep you in the
[1:11:02] way just obey his voice and he will
[1:11:06] bring you in the place that I've
[1:11:08] predestinated you to to go
[1:11:11] to so when a prophet left that angel
[1:11:15] stayed
[1:11:16] behind amen that Prophet amen the angel
[1:11:21] in a prophet had revealed again that
[1:11:22] secret message
[1:11:25] now we could say that secret things that
[1:11:27] belonged to God one time were revealed
[1:11:30] and now they belong to
[1:11:33] us but that angel stayed behind to make
[1:11:36] sure that message would become plain to
[1:11:40] you that secret message that was
[1:11:43] revealed now that angel stayed behind to
[1:11:46] make sure it would unfold and it would
[1:11:49] become so plain to
[1:11:51] you that you would say this is
[1:11:57] mine because see it was a secret
[1:12:00] message and it was hidden in the
[1:12:03] Bible but that's why when we read the
[1:12:06] Bible we read it through the message of
[1:12:08] Malachi
[1:12:10] 4 because everybody can read the
[1:12:13] Bible but to find that secret language
[1:12:17] you read it through the message of
[1:12:18] Malachi
[1:12:20] 4 Hallelujah and then you can read
[1:12:23] between the
[1:12:24] lines because that Mighty Angel the
[1:12:27] spirit of Truth is here to make sure
[1:12:31] that you connect to that secret
[1:12:34] message
[1:12:36] amen so that's why we thank God for that
[1:12:39] angel that's aiming at is on the Earth
[1:12:41] right
[1:12:42] now and all we have to do is stay
[1:12:44] connected to that angel because that
[1:12:47] angel has one
[1:12:49] mission to bring you in the place that
[1:12:53] God wants you to be in amen that angel
[1:12:57] is there Amen to watch over you and to
[1:13:00] connect you to that secret
[1:13:03] message blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:13:07] amen that angel is a spirit of truth
[1:13:10] that is unfolding and decoding the
[1:13:12] message if you like and making it more
[1:13:17] positive because we can testify every
[1:13:19] time we read the message every time we
[1:13:22] read the Bible it becomes more positive
[1:13:25] to me it becomes more positive to
[1:13:28] you am this is not a dead word this is a
[1:13:31] Living
[1:13:33] Word glory to God Amen so that message
[1:13:38] as the angel is making it plain and more
[1:13:40] positive to you it's that same message
[1:13:43] but he wants it so clear to you
[1:13:46] children because you need to run with
[1:13:48] that
[1:13:50] message and you need to know what is
[1:13:52] that secret secret
[1:13:55] message and the only thing you need to
[1:13:57] know it is a message of
[1:14:00] love it is a message of
[1:14:03] Grace it is a message that God wants you
[1:14:07] children to be like
[1:14:11] him not everybody knows that not
[1:14:15] everybody can even believe that but I
[1:14:17] thank God for some
[1:14:19] children for some young people for some
[1:14:22] believers
[1:14:23] that not only hear that message but that
[1:14:25] recognize
[1:14:27] it and are going to act upon
[1:14:32] it amen Ain going to say Lord reveal
[1:14:35] that secret message in its fullness to
[1:14:39] me Lord let me stay the Bible talks
[1:14:42] about a secret place of Thunder let me
[1:14:44] stay in that secret place and as I pray
[1:14:48] and read my Bible and read the
[1:14:50] message may you reveal to me the purpose
[1:14:55] of my
[1:14:57] life and may I then commit my ways unto
[1:15:00] that secret message just as sister bisc
[1:15:03] did commit my ways unto the Lord and he
[1:15:06] shall bring to pass the desires of your
[1:15:10] heart amen because the promise amen
[1:15:14] there's a promise over you children that
[1:15:16] you will
[1:15:18] know you will know him that is from the
[1:15:21] beginning you will have have perfect
[1:15:24] fellowship with Jehovah like Adam had
[1:15:26] with
[1:15:29] Jehovah that is not history it is more
[1:15:33] present tense that we can even pinch
[1:15:37] ourself the same language the same way
[1:15:40] that Adam fellowship with Jehovah that's
[1:15:43] how God wants to speak to your
[1:15:46] children in the same
[1:15:48] Simplicity we saw it manifested in
[1:15:50] Malachi 4 we heard a testimony about it
[1:15:54] that is the same way that God wants to
[1:15:57] reveal that secret message to you and to
[1:16:00] make it a
[1:16:03] reality amen and as you amen as you
[1:16:07] receive that secret
[1:16:09] message and as God unfolds it to
[1:16:12] you that original
[1:16:15] language will become your
[1:16:18] language I will forget about
[1:16:22] flamish I will forget about
[1:16:26] French I will forget about my human
[1:16:30] language I will forget about my human
[1:16:35] thoughts I will forget about my
[1:16:39] ODS I will forget about my funny
[1:16:43] feelings but I will connect back to that
[1:16:46] original
[1:16:50] language and I will speak just like
[1:16:53] Jesus
[1:16:55] spoke so I promise you 20 minutes
[1:16:57] children my time is
[1:16:59] up but I pray that some little child in
[1:17:02] here may speak like Jesus did one day
[1:17:06] when he was the age of
[1:17:11] 12 you know what Jesus
[1:17:15] said I must be concerned about that
[1:17:19] secret
[1:17:22] message because I must fulfill that
[1:17:26] secret message musicians you can come
[1:17:29] forward I must
[1:17:31] complete and
[1:17:33] fulfill God's original
[1:17:38] desire I must be about my father's
[1:17:41] business Jesus
[1:17:44] said I must run with this
[1:17:48] message I must contend for that message
[1:17:53] it is not just the message of my
[1:17:56] parents it's not just the message of my
[1:18:01] grandparents it's not just the message
[1:18:03] of my
[1:18:06] church but it's
[1:18:12] mine it is my love
[1:18:15] letter it is my secret message from my
[1:18:19] king of
[1:18:21] kings amen
[1:18:23] and when I come to the other side of the
[1:18:26] race and the question is asked will I
[1:18:29] find
[1:18:33] fate I
[1:18:36] pray that we can stand
[1:18:39] there and said Lord according to thy
[1:18:42] words it has been unto my
[1:18:46] life so God bless you
[1:18:49] children just remember the king of Kings
[1:18:53] has a secret message that has been
[1:18:56] revealed through a humble prophet and it
[1:18:58] belongs to
[1:19:00] you don't let nobody take it away from
[1:19:05] you don't let nobody say that it is not
[1:19:08] your
[1:19:10] message don't let nobody distract you on
[1:19:13] that
[1:19:15] race it doesn't matter how fast you run
[1:19:18] does not matter whether we fall and rise
[1:19:21] again we all do but what matters have
[1:19:25] you heard have you
[1:19:28] recognized and have you
[1:19:30] acted upon my secret
[1:19:33] message shall we stand to our
[1:19:36] feet and may we pray be like Jesus said
[1:19:39] those words I must be about that secret
[1:19:43] message because that secret message that
[1:19:46] is
[1:19:47] me you may not see it yet but every word
[1:19:51] in that secret message m is going to
[1:19:54] become
[1:19:56] me and that little boy that brother Bram
[1:19:58] spoke about was looking in the mirror
[1:19:59] one time and he said I see a boy and
[1:20:02] when he when I raise my hand that boy
[1:20:04] raises his hand when I raise both hands
[1:20:07] that boy raises both
[1:20:08] hands amen and then that the boy got a
[1:20:11] revelation and he said that boy is
[1:20:14] actually
[1:20:15] me I pray children may God show you that
[1:20:20] that secret message the word hallelujah
[1:20:22] is
[1:20:25] you may God bless you mine mine mine
[1:20:29] Jesus Is Mine Jesus spoke those words
[1:20:32] when he was in the temple he said I must
[1:20:34] be about my father's business I just
[1:20:37] pray children that when you leave from
[1:20:38] here you say the same and you say Jesus
[1:20:41] is mine this secret message has been
[1:20:44] revealed and it belongs to me it's not
