[31:34] in your word lord
[31:35] god and may the burden of god strike us
[31:38] father for the need for the hour the
[31:40] need for this season i may come and
[31:42] confirm your word with signs wonders and
[31:44] miracles bless the people here this
[31:46] morning bless you is connected to us
[31:48] here father and me do that but hear the
[31:50] message be with them in a special way
[31:53] what are we living in father you're
[31:55] promising your word when the enemy come
[31:56] like a flood the spirit raises standard
[31:59] father god we prayer is the standard
[32:00] this morning in jesus name we ask it
[32:03] amen and amen
[32:05] god bless you
[32:06] and welcome
[32:08] if your bible is allocated to any bibles
[32:10] to two portions of scripture this
[32:11] morning acts 1 verse 8
[32:16] and 1st corinthians chapter 12 i want to
[32:18] read 12-14 just two scriptures this
[32:20] morning
[32:22] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[32:26] acts 1 8 it's in red jesus speaking
[32:31] but you shall receive power
[32:33] after that the holy ghost is come upon
[32:35] you
[32:36] so you tell you when you get in power
[32:38] and you shall be witnesses unto me
[32:41] so she's telling me who you're going to
[32:42] be with yourself
[32:43] when you get this holy ghost to come
[32:45] upon you by giving your power you shall
[32:47] be witness unto me both in jerusalem and
[32:50] north judea and in samaria and the
[32:52] uttermost part of the earth
[32:54] first corinthians chapter 12
[32:56] 1 verse 12.
[32:59] paul
[33:00] for us the body is one and had many
[33:03] members
[33:04] and all the members of that one body
[33:06] being many
[33:07] are one body
[33:08] so also is christ
[33:10] so he's given a comparison here okay
[33:13] for by one spirit we are all baptized
[33:16] into one body
[33:17] whether we be jews or gentiles whether
[33:20] we be bond or free and have been all
[33:22] made to drink into one spirit
[33:25] for the body is not one member
[33:27] but many may god bless his word you may
[33:30] be seated
[33:36] so
[33:38] i think by now
[33:41] you know how we operate
[33:43] we have no extra boost this morning we
[33:46] go straight to the board
[33:48] all right um i know some ministers and
[33:50] you're on the way to run donkey take off
[33:54] the machine that we have here is a
[33:55] little different
[33:56] let's take off someone just zoom like
[33:58] that
[34:00] have no runway there
[34:01] okay so the amplifier the descriptor we
[34:04] read
[34:05] first corinthians 12 because the title
[34:07] this morning is by one spirit
[34:10] are we all baptized into one body that's
[34:12] the title this morning by one spirit we
[34:13] are all baptized into one body
[34:16] so this is the amplified for just as the
[34:18] body is a unity talk about our bodies
[34:22] and has many parts
[34:24] and all the parts though many form only
[34:28] one body
[34:30] so your body are many parts but it's
[34:33] one body
[34:34] okay so it is with christ
[34:38] the messiah the anointed one
[34:40] for by means of personal agency of one
[34:43] holy spirit
[34:45] we were all whether jews or greeks
[34:47] slaves are free baptized baptized united
[34:50] together into one body and all made to
[34:53] drink of one holy spirit
[34:56] that's why we say the holy spirit cannot
[34:58] behave in one person and believe in
[34:59] another person something is wrong it's
[35:02] one holy spirit
[35:04] isn't that right for the body does not
[35:06] consist of one limb
[35:08] or organ but of many
[35:10] your physical body is not a han only or
[35:13] knows only it's of many
[35:15] and that's how christ's body is so you
[35:18] can say you don't need the foot you
[35:19] don't need the hand you're feeling like
[35:20] of our nose this morning because you
[35:22] ain't want to smell that is your
[35:23] business
[35:24] god put all these different parts in the
[35:26] body to make up this body and that is
[35:28] why you're beginning to see that you
[35:30] need the brethren you need others you
[35:33] need everybody to come into this into
[35:36] that place
[35:37] not church
[35:39] but the body
[35:40] oh give the lord some praises
[35:43] hallelujah let's go
[35:45] [Applause]
[35:46] then each night we want every person
[35:48] that's not a christian hope something
[35:49] will be said or done that you become a
[35:51] christian
[35:52] and if you're not if you already believe
[35:54] in the lord jesus and accept him and
[35:56] have been baptized that is in water now
[35:59] and you haven't received the holy ghost
[36:01] as yet
[36:02] don't let this get by
[36:04] just let this be your night because
[36:07] remember there is just so many names on
[36:10] that book and when the last name is
[36:12] added that's all of it
[36:14] and yours might complete it
[36:16] oh blessed be the name of the lord there
[36:19] are so many names on that book and your
[36:21] name might complete it
[36:23] no and the last name goes on that book
[36:26] and then he changes it or
[36:30] the last name that's redeemed that was
[36:32] put on that book
[36:34] oh glory to god the last name that was
[36:37] redeemed that was put on the book
[36:39] that settles it he comes to claim what
[36:42] he has redeemed and it might be a
[36:44] strange time did you ever think people
[36:46] will go on right on preaching the church
[36:47] will go right on even thinking they're
[36:49] getting people saved it's too late then
[36:51] it's over see the message will go to the
[36:53] total lost oh praise god so there's
[36:55] another game this is the word of god oh
[36:58] blessed be the name of the lord you love
[37:00] him this morning
[37:01] blessed be the name of the lord
[37:03] hallelujah praise be to jesus thank you

[54:10] one spirit we are baptized
[54:12] into the body
[54:13] which body some church
[54:16] this is not the church christ
[54:17] billionaire this is the building we
[54:18] built with concrete and cement
[54:20] christ i built this and we build this
[54:22] the one at the church he's talking about
[54:24] upon this rock i
[54:27] will build
[54:28] my church
[54:29] and the gates of hell
[54:32] shall not prevail against it
[54:34] that's the body he's talking about
[54:36] [Applause]
[54:39] all right
[54:42] question
[54:43] by one spiritual baptized into the body
[54:45] of christ
[54:46] he said you remember that was the
[54:48] question i was on now that's found of
[54:50] course in first corinthians 12 at the
[54:51] time
[54:52] you reached somebody asking the question
[54:54] we received the new birth this takes
[54:55] place
[54:56] is this the baptism of the holy spirit
[54:58] or is there a later baptism or is it a
[55:01] filling
[55:02] but a brand of answer no this is quite a
[55:05] question we could spend the rest of our
[55:07] time right on that one tonight and
[55:09] tomorrow night and so forth but it would
[55:11] take and tie the entire bible together
[55:14] every scripture must probably be tied
[55:16] together every other scripture in the
[55:18] bible
[55:19] but just trying to make it just as
[55:21] briefly plain as i know how to make it
[55:24] no
[55:26] when you believe in the lord jesus
[55:27] christ then you have the new birth
[55:30] when you believe on the lord you receive
[55:32] a new thought a new life
[55:34] but it isn't the baptism of the holy
[55:37] ghost see
[55:38] you got the new birth when you believe
[55:40] you've got eternal life it's a gift of
[55:42] god that's given to you to sovereign
[55:43] grace by accepting the gift of god given
[55:45] to you he that here at my words and
[55:48] believe it on him that sent me heart
[55:49] eating a life as everlasting life that's
[55:51] the new birth you have converted this
[55:53] means you are turn around
[55:55] but
[55:55] the baptism of the holy spirit puts you
[55:59] into the body of christ
[56:01] subject to the gifts
[56:03] for
[56:04] service
[56:06] it doesn't make you any more of a
[56:07] christian it just puts you into the body
[56:09] of gifts now by one spirit first
[56:12] corinthians 12 we all baptize into one
[56:14] body now says paul said there are
[56:16] different gifts and in this body is nine
[56:18] spiritual gifts in this body you have to
[56:20] be baptized into the body to possess one
[56:23] of these gifts they come with the body
[56:26] but now as far as having eternal life
[56:28] being a christian you're a christian the
[56:30] moment you believe no not not make
[56:31] believe
[56:32] that is truly believe on the lord jesus
[56:35] and accept him as your personal savior
[56:37] you are born again right there and have
[56:39] eternal life god comes into you but
[56:41] watch eternal life you don't hear my
[56:42] words and so on now then
[56:44] then then they had then they had them a
[56:46] preacher up there a converted lawyer by
[56:48] the name of apollos and apollos was a
[56:50] mighty man in the scriptures and was
[56:52] proven by the scriptures that jesus was
[56:55] the christ now what apollos through the
[56:56] word was proven by the word faith come
[56:59] by hearing and hearing the word he that
[57:01] heareth my word and belong to him that
[57:03] sent me has ever asked in life but
[57:05] apollos by the word was proven and they
[57:07] were christians they were followers
[57:09] disciples and apollos was proven by the
[57:11] word jesus was the christ and they had
[57:13] received god great joy and received the
[57:16] word yet knowing only the baptism of
[57:18] john
[57:19] and when paul passed through the upper
[57:21] course of ephesus he fined his disciples
[57:23] and said have you received the holy
[57:25] ghost since you believe are you know
[57:27] what they say but we haven't heard of
[57:29] any holy ghost but we really believe we
[57:31] have all the books we have all the tips
[57:33] we hear all the mysteries we have all
[57:35] the revelations we really do but we are
[57:37] here about this thing called the holy
[57:38] ghost he said now what
[57:40] he said no i want and um he said noah
[57:43] and he said have you received all sins
[57:44] you believe now when you believe jesus
[57:46] said you have eaten the life that's the
[57:48] new birth that's your conversion
[57:49] changing but the baptism of the holy
[57:51] spirit is the power of god
[57:54] that you are baptized into and are
[57:57] subject to these nine spiritual gifts to
[57:58] work through you such as preaching
[58:00] evangelists apostles pastors prophets
[58:02] and all the gifts of the body come into
[58:04] this and then you are baptized into this
[58:06] body doesn't make you any more christian
[58:07] it just sets you positionally in the
[58:10] place to be a ministering spirit in the
[58:13] church of the living god no you get it
[58:16] oh praise god no by one spirit we are
[58:17] baptized into one body that's correct
[58:19] the baptism of the holy ghost is
[58:21] different from the new birth one is a
[58:22] birth one is a baptism it brings you
[58:24] eternal life and the other ones gives
[58:26] you power it gives power into your
[58:29] eternal life and that's why we're at
[58:31] acts 1 8 you shall receive power not
[58:33] recycling see that church bench or
[58:35] poached pew or church seat you shall
[58:36] receive power power for what power to
[58:38] say i am sorry take part to the
[58:40] direction of some people carry repent at
[58:41] all paul did say please forgive me for
[58:43] what to pray for to forgive power to
[58:46] love power to act right oh praise god he
[58:49] said i knew what i will give you because
[58:50] you have a heart heart towards god a new

[1:08:53] don't like it you have other churches
[1:08:54] you don't like it like the exit you
[1:08:56] don't like it bye-bye praise where you
[1:08:57] want to go but we're not here to please
[1:09:00] any man we have to tell you the truth
[1:09:02] because only the truth goes set you free
[1:09:04] oh god your husband can't give you this
[1:09:06] your wife can't give you this you can't
[1:09:08] get this in a supermarket but to get
[1:09:09] this on the word of god forget bbc and
[1:09:12] cnn and forget all the news out there
[1:09:14] this is the good news this morning we
[1:09:16] have a land to possess it's the land of
[1:09:18] the holy ghost it's the land of power
[1:09:20] why are we so weak we need power look at
[1:09:22] the lord i shout
[1:09:24] oh glory to god
[1:09:25] [Applause]
[1:09:28] you know money is power
[1:09:31] you say which one does me happy that's a
[1:09:32] lie
[1:09:36] and people receive the thing the
[1:09:37] spiritual and the poor and it's more
[1:09:39] spiritual than anybody else irishman oh
[1:09:41] god he happy
[1:09:43] you can buy whatever you want
[1:09:44] he has the power to do that
[1:09:46] that's power he had the power to go on p
[1:09:49] for doctor p for this and people can't
[1:09:50] pee for this and play for triple he had
[1:09:52] power i will monitor them and with the
[1:09:54] power now he could be arrogant he could
[1:09:57] be uncaring
[1:09:58] like the man who lazarus said give me
[1:10:00] some water on the front thing see a rich
[1:10:02] man he could be uncaring he don't care
[1:10:04] who who survived and so on because he's
[1:10:07] her power
[1:10:08] so god want power to release his people
[1:10:10] but he want character
[1:10:12] because power apart from character is
[1:10:13] satanic so god have to go through the
[1:10:16] grind of changing us and remaking us and
[1:10:19] quran saying looking for a man that the
[1:10:21] more he blesses is the more humble he
[1:10:23] becomes why because usually when people
[1:10:26] get blessed they get puffed up
[1:10:29] oh glory to god you got that
[1:10:31] usually when people get blessed they get
[1:10:33] puffed up
[1:10:34] and god hates a proud look
[1:10:39] one thing you hate to spread you know
[1:10:41] [Applause]
[1:10:42] are we knowing something this morning
[1:10:44] boy one thing god hit his pride you know
[1:10:47] hallelujah hallelujah he said i am the
[1:10:49] high and lofty one that dwell with him
[1:10:51] that have a humble heart and a contrite
[1:10:54] spirit as lucifer said i will ascend and
[1:10:56] be like the most high
[1:10:58] oh glory to god he's the one that was
[1:11:00] puffed up in pride and godzilla go
[1:11:02] humble you he gave me the boots and
[1:11:03] kicked him out oh glory to god and he
[1:11:06] fell in the earth oh glory thank you big
[1:11:08] mischief among the sons of god on the
[1:11:10] earth but we are coming back sons of god
[1:11:12] are coming back the book that was sealed
[1:11:15] in the garden of eden has now been
[1:11:17] unsealed and now we have access oh glory
[1:11:20] to god by the cross access to the
[1:11:23] innervale access to his glory access to
[1:11:26] his presence access to his spirit
[1:11:29] [Applause]
[1:11:31] oh my hallelujah let's say we wrap this
[1:11:34] up here now this part here friends
[1:11:36] we are not promised a system
[1:11:39] jesus wouldn't have nothing to do with a
[1:11:41] system we wasn't promised a system we
[1:11:44] were promised what was we promised a
[1:11:47] kingdom
[1:11:48] how do you get into it by one spirit we
[1:11:52] are all baptized into this kingdom
[1:11:54] it's the kingdom of god a kingdom of
[1:11:57] eternal life with an eternal king given
[1:11:59] for his word with an ever eternal people
[1:12:02] predestinated to eternal life we are
[1:12:05] baptized into it oh blessed be the name
[1:12:08] of the lord praise god give me some
[1:12:10] praises
[1:12:12] oh
[1:12:14] hallelujah
[1:12:16] so believe it or not
[1:12:18] that's what i got before coming out here
[1:12:21] that's what i share with you all right
[1:12:23] all right nobody brown
[1:12:24] we see nations breaking israel awakening
[1:12:27] the signs that this bible foretold for
[1:12:29] this day we see the mechanical taking
[1:12:31] place now
[1:12:33] now
[1:12:34] the spirit
[1:12:36] the dynamics of that promised word
[1:12:40] to get into his church
[1:12:42] and drive them to calvary yonder unto
[1:12:45] the rapture
[1:12:47] oh
[1:12:48] so you mean the people not going to the
[1:12:50] cross
[1:12:51] no
[1:12:52] the duck and the cross
[1:12:54] the duck in calvary because calvary is
[1:12:56] where you die
[1:12:57] it's not just die and you go free him
[1:12:59] you have a cross for you too
[1:13:01] you see but he said the spirit and then
[1:13:03] he identified
[1:13:05] what the spirit is the dynamics of
[1:13:08] the promised word so when we preach the
[1:13:10] promised word there's spirit in it
[1:13:13] and that spirit is what going to drive
[1:13:14] you
[1:13:15] to calvary
[1:13:16] now when the spirit came upon jesus and
[1:13:18] gave him his baptism
[1:13:20] oh jesus baptized yes
[1:13:22] he was baptized at the river jordan not
[1:13:25] just in water but by the spirit
[1:13:27] when he got the spirit
[1:13:29] fullness of the godhead
[1:13:31] fullness of the spirit he was led
[1:13:34] by the spirit
[1:13:36] into the wilderness he didn't say lord
[1:13:38] is that you is that really you
[1:13:40] no he was led
[1:13:42] by the spirit to encounter lucifer
[1:13:45] one on one
[1:13:46] and when you're finished with the devil
[1:13:48] who is man oh give the lord i shout so
[1:13:52] when jesus overcome the devil by it is
[1:13:55] written by the word he was ready for
[1:13:57] ministry he was ready to go into the
[1:13:59] temple he was very defined in scriptures
[1:14:02] to say the spirit is upon me would the
[1:14:04] bride have that sure she will the spirit
[1:14:07] and the bride have to say come or give
[1:14:09] the lord a shout therefore the holy
[1:14:11] ghost itself the dynamics have to come
[1:14:14] upon a bride to go into the scripture to
[1:14:17] say the spirit is upon me because he has
[1:14:19] anointed me oh glory to god to open the
[1:14:22] eyes of the blind to cause the death to
[1:14:24] hear to cause the tongue to speak you
[1:14:27] mean the private level ministry yes
[1:14:29] or give the lord some praises before
[1:14:32] they could close us down
[1:14:37] before
[1:14:39] i enclosed myself don't get to close me
[1:14:41] down but before
[1:14:43] they could close us down we have to have
[1:14:45] a witness
[1:14:46] we have to have power
[1:14:48] the car closes down clapping hands and
[1:14:49] singing nice to jesus songs that is not
[1:14:52] everybody doing that the car clothes has
[1:14:54] done because we are bibles they can't
[1:14:56] close us don't be all we have nice
[1:14:57] teachings everybody are teachings but
[1:14:59] you know what they're closing them for
[1:15:00] when the reproduction of the original
[1:15:03] grain when they say jesus come walking
[1:15:06] in trinidad silver and gold have i none
[1:15:09] such as i have i give it under thee
[1:15:12] which man on the earth right now could
[1:15:14] do that
[1:15:15] not one
[1:15:17] [Applause]
[1:15:18] only more champions
[1:15:20] [Applause]
[1:15:23] this was casablanca you know
[1:15:25] this was denying peter you know this is
[1:15:27] peter who denied christ three times you
[1:15:28] know this was peter who was struggling
[1:15:31] and everything else you know he come and
[1:15:33] says silvan gold have i none such as i
[1:15:35] have what did he have he did not sell
[1:15:38] van gogh he had no money he was a poor
[1:15:40] person
[1:15:42] scranton a person suffering a person
[1:15:44] but such as i have
[1:15:46] he had the kingdom
[1:15:48] he had the key
[1:15:49] he had power he had the artisan well he
[1:15:52] had permanent power it was resident in
[1:15:55] him
[1:15:56] and he knew it
[1:15:57] and he could give what he have you can't
[1:15:59] give what you don't have he got
[1:16:01] something it happened in the upper room
[1:16:04] he could testify where it happened when
[1:16:07] it happened how it happened it's a
[1:16:09] silver and gold have i known such as i
[1:16:12] have i give unto you rise up and walk
[1:16:20] we can't be afraid of that
[1:16:21] that has to be reproduced
[1:16:23] here say oh say if i go have i know i
[1:16:25] haven't got you hold a book
[1:16:29] i wanted to hear this tip
[1:16:31] it's not taking him i want to hear you
[1:16:33] know he want deliverance from that
[1:16:34] condition
[1:16:37] and there are people out there they
[1:16:38] might ordain to hear no book or no tape
[1:16:41] they want to see a manifested life
[1:16:44] like the woman at the well
[1:16:46] i that speak unto you i'm here
[1:16:49] word made flesh
[1:16:51] good manifested so now we get it now the
[1:16:53] dynamics of the promised words that
[1:16:55] drive them
[1:16:56] oh god
[1:16:58] to calvary then to the rapture
[1:17:01] but abraham said this you know you know
[1:17:03] it
[1:17:03] he said no
[1:17:06] what is the holy spirit now the reason
[1:17:09] i've taken these subjects
[1:17:11] uh in this line you cannot come and
[1:17:13] receive the holy spirit unless you know
[1:17:14] what it is one
[1:17:16] two you cannot receive it
[1:17:18] if you know what it is unless you
[1:17:20] believe it is given to you
[1:17:22] and it is for you
[1:17:24] three
[1:17:25] you cannot know whether you got it or
[1:17:27] not unless you know the results it
[1:17:29] brings
[1:17:30] so if you know what it is and who it is
[1:17:33] to what action it brings when it comes
[1:17:35] then you will know what you got when you
[1:17:37] get it
[1:17:41] there's a vast difference between just a
[1:17:43] christian
[1:17:44] and a holy ghost filled christian
[1:17:47] now we're gonna get this from the
[1:17:48] scripture and place it exactly in the
[1:17:51] scripture the first place there's a
[1:17:53] christian profess to be a christian but
[1:17:55] if this christian has not yet been
[1:17:57] filled
[1:17:58] with the holy ghost
[1:18:00] now we're not talking about teaching and
[1:18:02] mysteries we're talking about experience
[1:18:05] of god
[1:18:06] that is promised to you
[1:18:09] if
[1:18:10] this person has not been filled with the
[1:18:12] holy ghost he is only in the process of
[1:18:15] being a christian
[1:18:16] he is professed to believe it he is
[1:18:19] working to it but god has not yet given
[1:18:22] him this spirit of the holy ghost he has
[1:18:25] not yet reached that goal with god so
[1:18:27] when god made a common abraham we know
[1:18:29] what he did he gave him a covenant and
[1:18:32] after abram was found faithful to the
[1:18:34] promise that god gave him he that he
[1:18:36] would a child give him a sign and that
[1:18:39] sign was a sign of circumcision and a
[1:18:41] circumcision is a type of the holy ghost
[1:18:43] and that is why
[1:18:44] i i think it was stephen say you
[1:18:46] stiffneck and uncircumcised you do
[1:18:49] always resist the holy ghost as your
[1:18:52] fathers did that was stephen bust them
[1:18:54] with those circumcision type of the holy
[1:18:56] ghost now watch
[1:18:58] it's a sign of the sacrificial
[1:19:00] circumcision of the heart it's a
[1:19:02] distinction to separate them from other
[1:19:04] peoples now the holy spirit that makes
[1:19:07] god's church a separated church what it
[1:19:10] is
[1:19:10] the holy spirit right now watch and from
[1:19:14] all other creeds and fates and
[1:19:15] denominations
[1:19:16] they are in all kinds of denomination
[1:19:19] and yet they are separated people
[1:19:22] hear the bomb you let me talk to a man
[1:19:25] two minutes
[1:19:27] and i can tell
[1:19:29] you
[1:19:30] whether he received the holy ghost or
[1:19:32] not
[1:19:33] how much mysteries a man could go back
[1:19:35] in two minutes
[1:19:39] how much information a man could give
[1:19:40] two minutes you saw a deep cause of deep
[1:19:42] right most of you would have seen it i
[1:19:44] believe you saw where i'm on the
[1:19:45] platform see a preacher come up there
[1:19:47] and bram say you're not sick
[1:19:49] he said
[1:19:50] he said you're a preacher
[1:19:51] and then they're supposed to talk about
[1:19:53] i feel that christian spirit so it's a
[1:19:55] spirit atmosphere so he doesn't have to
[1:19:57] say hey who your pastor is well you
[1:19:59] believe
[1:20:00] yes teach this take no you know that he
[1:20:03] said you're a christian
[1:20:04] then he said tell him one next woman he
[1:20:06] said my spirit be a record with your
[1:20:07] spirit
[1:20:08] that you're a christian you're a child
[1:20:10] of god so it's not what you're saying
[1:20:11] with your mouth you don't want to talk
[1:20:13] you advise it
[1:20:15] oh give the lord some praises
[1:20:17] so what your vibes in
[1:20:19] now if you're good vibes the holy spirit
[1:20:21] revives your christian life you could
[1:20:23] advise jealousy
[1:20:25] envy malice we gotta talk you know but
[1:20:27] you're feeling it
[1:20:29] a jealous spirit upon you on it your
[1:20:31] vibe's in it right if it's color you see
[1:20:32] any color it's because he colored god
[1:20:36] bitterness all that
[1:20:37] ah brother time said why are you so
[1:20:39] bitter yeah you said no
[1:20:43] they come they almost smell it you see
[1:20:46] you don't have to say a word he said two
[1:20:47] minutes i could tell where you see the
[1:20:49] holy ghost or not it separates them it's
[1:20:51] a mark and any child that refused
[1:20:53] circumcision in the old testament was
[1:20:55] the fourth shot of the holy ghost was
[1:20:56] cut off among the people he could not
[1:20:58] have fellowship with the rest of the
[1:21:00] congregation if he refused to be
[1:21:01] circumcised what is the holy ghost it's
[1:21:04] a sign we come in to get on a little
[1:21:06] later on the message and watch it's the
[1:21:09] holy ghost it's a seal it's a sign god
[1:21:12] gave you give to his chosen children to
[1:21:14] reject it is to be cut off from the
[1:21:16] people and to receive it is to be
[1:21:18] finished with the world
[1:21:19] and all the things of the world it's to
[1:21:21] be a product that god has put a seal
[1:21:25] approval on and peter described jesus
[1:21:28] jesus a man approved of god
[1:21:33] so when it is approved is the proof of
[1:21:35] god
[1:21:36] a man approved it by god and that's what
[1:21:38] god wants to do for you to say this is
[1:21:40] my beloved son in whom i am
[1:21:43] well pleased okay now watch
[1:21:46] and but i'm talking about the railroad
[1:21:48] and when the car being loaded inspector
[1:21:50] come to find anything loose and if and
[1:21:52] if it would fall or break you would not
[1:21:54] seal the car so he's talking about the
[1:21:56] candles he's switching natural tight
[1:21:58] about box car on the railroad and they
[1:22:01] put things in it and when the inspector
[1:22:02] come the inspector have to come
[1:22:05] the inspector
[1:22:07] i have good news for you
[1:22:08] you will like this one this species not

[1:22:17] gotta get a fight this morning boy why
[1:22:19] what you're going through something else
[1:22:20] you are going on to it i'm going to this
[1:22:22] inspector now he could come and he come
[1:22:24] and come and come in
[1:22:25] so watch
[1:22:26] now he said the reason that we don't get
[1:22:29] sealed so much we are too loose about
[1:22:32] things when the inspector goes through
[1:22:35] to inspect your life
[1:22:38] or you've been here respect life
[1:22:41] yes not your words you could talk
[1:22:43] talking to anything but inspect your
[1:22:45] life
[1:22:45] see
[1:22:46] if you are not just a little loose about
[1:22:49] things
[1:22:50] and he sat and they find some things
[1:22:52] loose about your prayer life
[1:22:57] oh you mean we supposed to have a sort
[1:22:59] of discipline and having a prayer life
[1:23:02] yes
[1:23:04] yes
[1:23:05] loose about your prayer life loose about
[1:23:07] that temper loose about your tongue
[1:23:10] to talk about others that's a big one
[1:23:12] that's a that's a huge one
[1:23:14] he will never see that car
[1:23:16] so he's a gossiper whether he has a
[1:23:19] professional or not
[1:23:20] um
[1:23:21] no steal for you
[1:23:24] he's have official and unofficial you
[1:23:26] know
[1:23:27] praise the lord
[1:23:28] watch some dirty habits
[1:23:31] some vile things
[1:23:33] some vulgarity mine he can't
[1:23:36] seal
[1:23:37] the car
[1:23:39] so this now brings the whole thing
[1:23:41] different now
[1:23:42] you can't hide in church there's not
[1:23:44] people to see somebody in front of the
[1:23:45] slide down slowly that the only person
[1:23:47] sees them good i'm not seeing you you
[1:23:48] could have put some function at all
[1:23:51] but this is not this year
[1:23:53] the inspector at tall or short he right
[1:23:55] there
[1:23:56] he's seen you every move
[1:23:58] and if you take that consciousness you
[1:24:00] would not do what you have done or will
[1:24:01] do because your conscious the lord is on
[1:24:03] your right side the lord is watching you
[1:24:05] the inspector watching you if we could
[1:24:07] leave it with the conscience this
[1:24:08] morning there's an inspector oh glory to
[1:24:11] god when nobody else sees the
[1:24:12] inspector's seen
[1:24:14] it comes somebody after they sweep the
[1:24:15] floor and you sweep the floor they look
[1:24:17] around like that and you raise up the
[1:24:18] big mat to the carpet and throw the dust
[1:24:20] on insert it so coming back
[1:24:23] when parents come home they see it sweep
[1:24:24] they hate sweep but it does under the
[1:24:26] carpet
[1:24:27] they see it yet
[1:24:30] that is man see but god's seen
[1:24:32] everything
[1:24:33] oh blessed be the name of the lord so
[1:24:36] watch
[1:24:37] now what something
[1:24:38] no
[1:24:39] he has purchased us every promise in the
[1:24:41] bible is yours it belongs to you then
[1:24:43] this token is upon you and god has
[1:24:45] sealed you now we want to check
[1:24:47] ourselves for a moment when god has
[1:24:49] given you the true baptism of the holy
[1:24:51] spirit then the life of jesus christ is
[1:24:54] within you now that's true it's the new
[1:24:56] book you are born anew of the holy ghost
[1:25:00] because that god has did this and you
[1:25:02] know you are no good in yourself you
[1:25:05] accept what god has did then he seals
[1:25:08] you into the kingdom by the holy spirit
[1:25:10] oh praise god and everything that jesus
[1:25:12] purchased and promised you in the bible
[1:25:14] is yours it's your property because it's
[1:25:17] paid for and when you understand by
[1:25:19] revelation you pray differently then you
[1:25:21] say healing his mind he paid for it he
[1:25:23] lost yours he paid for it freedom is
[1:25:25] mine he paid for it heaven is mighty
[1:25:27] paid for it everything he purchased
[1:25:29] belongs to the man that holds that token
[1:25:32] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[1:25:36] so then he is showing you
[1:25:38] in connection with the true holy ghost
[1:25:41] and this is very important listen
[1:25:43] carefully he said the way god is
[1:25:46] expecting the individual to grow is the
[1:25:48] way he brought his church to grow
[1:25:51] how did he bring his church to grow look
[1:25:53] at right here fate
[1:25:55] virtue
[1:25:56] knowledge
[1:25:57] temperance patience
[1:25:59] godliness brotherly kindness this is not
[1:26:03] a fast food product god have god put
[1:26:06] abraham faith isaac love jacob grace

[1:26:18] the cornerstone of the new testament
[1:26:20] here come paul martin arenas columba

[1:26:44] holy ghost to come upon you
[1:26:47] to give you power
[1:26:52] hallelujah
[1:26:53] so i am not talking about pentecostal
[1:26:55] baptism i am talking about the power
[1:26:58] right on the top of bradley kindness
[1:27:01] which is perfect
[1:27:03] because god know the amount of rob and
[1:27:05] crab and all kind of characters that are
[1:27:07] going to step on your toes
[1:27:10] and god will see if you have the ability

[1:27:14] to give you access
[1:27:16] to that holy spirit
[1:27:18] just above brotherly kindness give the
[1:27:19] lord a shout

[1:27:29] [Music]
[1:27:30] brother
[1:27:32] that's the key
[1:27:33] because that is the blood for this age
[1:27:36] so if somebody can't forgive they're not
[1:27:37] really any message
[1:27:39] let me say it good
[1:27:40] if they can't forgive they don't not
[1:27:42] really even any message
[1:27:43] because this is a evidence or a display
[1:27:46] that you understand this is your age
[1:27:49] this is the age of forgiveness how much
[1:27:51] times must the brother offend you
[1:27:53] 70 times a day how much time do you go
[1:27:54] forgive your brother oh give the lord a
[1:27:56] shout
[1:27:58] gloria no slacker
[1:28:00] with unforgiveness in his heart
[1:28:01] [Applause]
[1:28:03] that ain't that no adoption for that
[1:28:05] i don't care what the brother did

[1:35:22] of the holy ghost
[1:35:23] comes upon you
[1:35:25] in the true
[1:35:27] baptism
[1:35:28] of the holy ghost
[1:35:30] and you've got all these virtues sealed
[1:35:31] in you
[1:35:32] so the true baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:35:35] when all these virtues
[1:35:37] is sealed in you
[1:35:39] you recognize this is not skim milk you
[1:35:41] recognize this is not small talk you

[1:35:45] this is you and christ
[1:35:47] christ living in you

[1:35:50] hope of glory not mystery to talk not
[1:35:53] mystery in your head but christ
[1:35:56] in you
[1:35:57] [Applause]
[1:36:06] are you ready
[1:36:07] for the big bomb
[1:36:09] when a man
[1:36:11] possesses these kind of things
[1:36:14] then the holy ghost
[1:36:16] comes upon him
[1:36:18] what is acts 1 8
[1:36:20] you shall see power
[1:36:22] after
[1:36:24] the holy ghost
[1:36:25] comes upon you
[1:36:27] when a man
[1:36:29] possesses these things
[1:36:31] i'm reading
[1:36:32] then the holy ghost
[1:36:34] comes upon him
[1:36:36] you better believe that this morning
[1:36:38] that's thus said the word that's thus
[1:36:39] saith the lord
[1:36:45] no matter you might speak in tongues you
[1:36:46] might impersonate any gift that god has
[1:36:48] got you might do that but until these
[1:36:50] virtues here go into you
[1:36:53] you are still off the real true
[1:36:55] foundation of faith
[1:36:56] but when these virtues grow in
[1:36:59] look at the words
[1:37:01] and
[1:37:03] you added that to that then you are a
[1:37:07] living monument
[1:37:10] [Music]
[1:37:14] not imaginary
[1:37:16] a living faith
[1:37:18] a living virtue
[1:37:20] he's going down he's drilling down a
[1:37:22] living knowledge a living temperance and
[1:37:24] living patience
[1:37:26] how we could know it living if we had
[1:37:27] tested
[1:37:29] nothing tested we don't even living
[1:37:32] a dog lying down there you don't know if
[1:37:34] your dog alive or dead
[1:37:35] touch sensina
[1:37:37] if it bites by children thing you know
[1:37:38] they're alive
[1:37:41] you better move it dead
[1:37:43] living faith
[1:37:45] living virtue
[1:37:46] living knowledge and it makes a living
[1:37:49] man
[1:37:50] a living image
[1:37:52] in the statue of god
[1:37:54] and that brings us back to genesis 1 26
[1:37:56] let us make man
[1:37:59] in our image and likeness so you mean
[1:38:02] this book
[1:38:03] that adam had
[1:38:05] is connected to these virtues that is in
[1:38:08] this pyramid
[1:38:09] in the second bible
[1:38:11] oh give the lord a shout
[1:38:14] you mean that's a revelation you mean
[1:38:16] when you have that you have the entire
[1:38:17] bible in you
[1:38:18] yes
[1:38:19] it's just three bibles this second bible
[1:38:22] and this written bible is the same bible
[1:38:24] this is the living bible
[1:38:26] that will be living in you
[1:38:28] word made flesh
[1:38:30] god made flesh
[1:38:32] all glory to god
[1:38:34] and the word was invisible until the
[1:38:37] word becomes flesh and when the word
[1:38:40] becomes flesh the invisible give the
[1:38:43] lord a shout
[1:38:44] becomes visible
[1:38:46] [Applause]
[1:38:50] all right
[1:38:53] and watch the same thing that jesus did
[1:38:55] walking the same way he walked doing the
[1:38:57] same things he did because it's not
[1:38:59] imaginary there's a reality that proves
[1:39:01] that
[1:39:02] and every man today
[1:39:04] that has received the true baptism of
[1:39:07] the holy ghost is anointed with the same
[1:39:10] spirit
[1:39:11] that jesus of nazareth was and went
[1:39:13] about doing good and healing the sick he
[1:39:16] said that makes me feel good to know
[1:39:18] that he lives today
[1:39:20] oh glory to god
[1:39:22] and then he being a prophecy
[1:39:24] he said
[1:39:25] when that light
[1:39:26] struck little rebecca
[1:39:28] she knew something between her that
[1:39:30] brought her to isaac she failed her face
[1:39:33] she wanted norma to do with her own
[1:39:35] thinking isaac was a thinking from then
[1:39:37] on and the church itself
[1:39:40] when it strikes the power of god
[1:39:42] the baptism of the holy ghost and he's
[1:39:45] identifying where
[1:39:47] so you're going to know it's not
[1:39:48] pentecostally talking about is that
[1:39:50] charismatically talking about listen to
[1:39:52] what he said when it strikes the power
[1:39:54] of god the baptism of the holy ghost out
[1:39:57] of the nominative churches out of the
[1:39:59] catholic church wherever it is
[1:40:02] when the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:40:05] made real to the people
[1:40:07] them that are predestinated like you
[1:40:08] people here to eternal life sees it and
[1:40:11] walks in it what is it a super sign
[1:40:15] so there's a prophecy here brother
[1:40:16] lyndon that this baptism going to be
[1:40:18] made real
[1:40:20] to the people it has to be made real
[1:40:23] to the people
[1:40:25] i need it i want it i got to have it as
[1:40:27] promised god said it
[1:40:30] [Applause]
[1:40:36] you know why people follow false
[1:40:38] doctrine
[1:40:39] or i'm saying become a man naked
[1:40:44] man make it
[1:40:46] you see this we're talking here
[1:40:48] man can make that
[1:40:50] man can make that transformation
[1:40:52] see what preaching here man can produce
[1:40:54] that
[1:40:55] just got to do that
[1:40:56] oh my
[1:40:58] you talk about a woman let's go
[1:41:00] i want a home stretch
[1:41:02] i mean
[1:41:03] on this stretch

[1:45:50] jesus openly understands the scriptures
[1:45:52] he opened mysteries revelations old
[1:45:54] testament he dropped everything on them
[1:45:56] he opened the word
[1:45:58] and opened the understanding that he
[1:46:00] could understand the word because he
[1:46:01] didn't open the understanding they
[1:46:02] understand nothing
[1:46:04] and so it make you waste the time within
[1:46:05] the word so you understand how to be
[1:46:07] open to understand what he's telling you
[1:46:09] and he tell them very simple behold
[1:46:11] i send the promise of my father this is
[1:46:14] not only promise this is the promise of
[1:46:16] my father the other terry and he sees
[1:46:18] jerusalem until
[1:46:20] you've been with with some pastors
[1:46:22] spent and just tracked through the
[1:46:24] book to the window no until you get paul
[1:46:27] from one high
[1:46:28] that's all he knew
[1:46:29] now when jesus died all them said oh god
[1:46:32] oh good
[1:46:33] who would multiply bread again he dead
[1:46:35] go on
[1:46:36] so them in a sad mood when jesus opens
[1:46:39] scriptures to them opened the
[1:46:40] understanding and he was leaving the
[1:46:42] ball by by
[1:46:44] hallelujah
[1:46:46] no heartache
[1:46:47] no grief
[1:46:48] he was taken up in a cloud
[1:46:50] and they went into the temple
[1:46:52] praising and blessing god
[1:46:54] you see god calcum melon dry
[1:46:57] you ever prayed for somebody who's dead
[1:46:59] half dead at the altar you ever lay
[1:47:01] hands on somebody who really want to be
[1:47:03] there
[1:47:04] the family but they send them they say
[1:47:05] go up there and you're praying there
[1:47:07] like a plane on a stone
[1:47:09] no spirit atmosphere you see when
[1:47:11] somebody want deliverance and they come
[1:47:13] up to the altar to be prayed and they're
[1:47:14] in the spirit and you put your hands
[1:47:16] upon them to pray for them you feel a
[1:47:18] connection there's a deep inside of them
[1:47:21] calling oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:47:24] so the holy ghost
[1:47:26] can't come and dry
[1:47:28] so he put them together atmosphere in
[1:47:30] the upper room for 14 days
[1:47:33] they were praising and blessing god
[1:47:35] maybe mary didn't feel she had the
[1:47:37] praise god in the beginning but by time
[1:47:38] they finished she was praising god too
[1:47:40] old man jack mary
[1:47:43] mother of jesus and mary magdalene both
[1:47:46] mary's insider there oh glory to god
[1:47:48] virgin mary and prostitute mary all
[1:47:51] their names in the book say mary had to
[1:47:54] raise and praise raise and praise and if
[1:47:58] you think you getting anything without
[1:48:01] raising and praising you have nothing to
[1:48:03] get oh give the lord a shout in the
[1:48:05] house
[1:48:05] oh glory to god
[1:48:07] we gonna have a revival in the church

[1:48:18] hallelujah
[1:48:20] church joining us is of a man who it is
[1:48:22] of god
[1:48:24] but about him we will never get in on
[1:48:26] the intellectual we have to come in by
[1:48:29] the holy ghost because that's the only
[1:48:32] kind of a spirit that the holy ghost
[1:48:34] church bears so the pregnant word of god
[1:48:37] true word
[1:48:38] gospel could only produce this screaming
[1:48:40] shouting oh glory to god
[1:48:43] a bird i mean hospital is is is a messy
[1:48:46] thing
[1:48:47] i don't care if he's a king daughter
[1:48:49] prince anne prince elizabeth prince
[1:48:52] whoever prince or princess i don't care
[1:48:54] who given birth is a mess and these
[1:48:56] spiritual birth is a mess too they may
[1:48:58] fall along and might roll on the floor
[1:48:59] you might fall out clogged on my wheat
[1:49:01] you might cry whatever it is but it will
[1:49:04] be a mess
[1:49:05] glory to god your week might fall off
[1:49:07] and all you ever been a mess
[1:49:09] oh glory to god but jesus was born
[1:49:12] oh glory to god is a mess a bread is a
[1:49:15] mess and this new bird will be messy too
[1:49:18] this holy ghost thing will be messy
[1:49:21] people are going to like it but it could
[1:49:22] be messy
[1:49:23] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:49:26] oh but when you're finished you're a new
[1:49:28] creature in christ jesus when you're
[1:49:30] finished you're born again you're born
[1:49:32] anew you're born of the holy ghost
[1:49:35] you're born of the spirit you're
[1:49:37] connected to heaven
[1:49:38] [Applause]
[1:49:50] themselves
[1:49:51] from
[1:49:52] the true baptism of the holy spirit
[1:49:54] and the word of god unto what
[1:49:56] onto the cesspools of the church
[1:49:58] of dogmas and creeds and innovation
[1:50:01] differences
[1:50:02] so you see it's easier to preach
[1:50:04] something for somebody to hold his
[1:50:05] apostle creed
[1:50:06] this particular is that nomination again
[1:50:08] you know man preaching their own thing
[1:50:10] is that private popes you know
[1:50:12] proposed to be bigger than other
[1:50:13] thousand people in the church and two
[1:50:14] thousand and ten thousands you know
[1:50:15] there are people who are five people and
[1:50:17] they poop
[1:50:21] i'm almost
[1:50:22] done i have a lot i could preach
[1:50:28] [Music]
[1:50:33] it easy to pray three hours and see
[1:50:34] nothing else
[1:50:38] is not this is the word now
[1:50:42] if you know my different books to fight
[1:50:44] to get all these things to put it
[1:50:45] together
[1:50:46] [Music]
[1:50:47] because i want you to know what the
[1:50:48] prophet said

[2:27:21] appreciate that
[2:27:22] very very much as you know we have
[2:27:25] a greater level of compliance

[2:27:56] good practice in discipline you know so
[2:27:59] bear that in mind
[2:28:01] and um maintain all of the protocols not
[2:28:04] just here but
[2:28:05] as part of this journey
[2:28:08] uh it's akin to going into the arc of
[2:28:10] safety
[2:28:11] you know so noah couldn't say well i
[2:28:12] have the occurrence staying outside
[2:28:14] because i'm anointed he had to be in the
[2:28:15] ark so he had to do what had to be done
[2:28:17] to preserve life so as much as we can do
[2:28:20] to preserve life we will do so amen
[2:28:22] church
[2:28:23] wonderful next week uh group four
[2:28:26] brother marlon alexander's group is
[2:28:28] scheduled uh to clean so you wanna take
[2:28:31] note of that and may the law already
[2:28:34] blessed you this week and i see from the
[2:28:37] way the lord has been leading but
[2:28:39] it's a season being declared friends
[2:28:41] of that difference with being a
[2:28:43] christian and a holy ghost-filled
[2:28:45] christian
[2:28:46] uh it's a higher challenge to us with
[2:28:49] how we walk and that holy ghost life is
[2:28:51] christ in you
[2:28:52] and berube said it and the prophet say
[2:28:54] the holy ghost can behave in one person
[2:28:56] and misbehave in another person the
[2:28:58] behavior has to be christlike
[2:29:01] so we are encouraged and we are
[2:29:03] challenged in our prayer lives in our
[2:29:05] walk with god to walk closer to walk
[2:29:08] carefully to walk because we don't have
[2:29:10] much time left
[2:29:11] every day there's a news report that
[2:29:13] reminds us that we are leaving this
[2:29:15] place
[2:29:16] and it kind of just be words to us that
[2:29:17] we are leaving it it must become a
[2:29:19] reality to us that puts us into a spirit
[2:29:22] of expectation and anticipation and
[2:29:24] consecration and dedication for this
[2:29:27] holy ghost to be real to us individually
[2:29:29] not just real to the church and to the
[2:29:31] believers of the church but it must come
[2:29:33] personal to us as individuals that i
[2:29:35] want this thing and not just wanted but
[2:29:37] i want to live this thing so i challenge
[2:29:40] you those that are here and those that
[2:29:42] are online as well give this your all
[2:29:44] this is what we are here for but always
[2:29:46] said it seven years is like that so make
[2:29:49] your life a testimony while you're here
[2:29:52] let people know you're a christian
[2:29:54] let your house know you're a christian
[2:29:55] let your neighborhood i'm not saying
[2:29:57] they're walking around trying to preach
[2:29:58] to people but your life must thunder and
[2:30:00] that's what the prophet said that's a
[2:30:02] thunder that shakes the devil walking
[2:30:04] around in sweetness and humility so may
[2:30:06] the lord richly bless you stay on fire
[2:30:10] and robert said it in the service we
[2:30:12] ought to be the happiest people on the
[2:30:14] face of the earth so this week i
[2:30:16] challenge you to smile more than you
[2:30:18] smile last week to laugh more than you
[2:30:20] laughed last week i don't care how bad
[2:30:22] things get as david said i've never seen
[2:30:25] the righteous forsaken there's no
[2:30:26] strength in worrying about anything god
[2:30:29] is in control and he who started the
[2:30:31] work is more than able to bring it to
[2:30:33] completion so may the lord richly bless
[2:30:36] you stay on the firing line brother
[2:30:38] anthony
