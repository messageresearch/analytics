anointed I just want to try and speak so the deacons and already what's the thrill if I get anointed they'll be we're even there so I'm going to read a just three portions of scripture if you have your Bibles acts 1 8 3 familiar scripture and then First Corinthians 2 1 to 4 and then the favorite scripture second Peter 1 4 2 7. I'll explain you this nice suit I got on what happened so God is good man brother when he says the suit I'm sending Jesus gave it to me wow x18 but he shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and he shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea in Samaria and unto the utmost parts of the earth that means our router Park clipped down Kimberly all over I mean it never stopped and then First Corinthians 2 uh from verse 1 in Britain when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or wisdom declaring unto you the destiny of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling in my speech and my preaching was not for the enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power wow and then our favorite scripture second video on according as from verse 3 according as this divine power was given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us unto glory and virtue whereby given unto our succeeding great and precious promises thereby these he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption in the world through us and beside us giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience into patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity may the Lord a blessing to the reigning of his word God bless you you may be seated and uh by the days in your wife nice to see you also and everyone that I if I must we just want to say God bless you and good to see you Church wow thanks for those praise me follow up nice thanks and you know what's so beautiful when you have people praying for you but the very you know all across the world people sending encouraging messages phone calls and uh okay so I want to keep that for maybe after or another time so he didn't let the devil win just remember that so I got a special title today and you'll have to listen can I get some more on the stage monitorium my title this morning is God's powers subject is he shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you my inspiration is the gospel is in power and demonstration can we say amen amen hallelujah now it says young world is again falling apart the church cannot run without the power of God through the word and the Holy Ghost will only confirm the word of God for that what it is to do then he turns around and says the anointing is to confirm the word so the anointing comes white to confirm the word to back up the word to manifest it so you can have word word word but it says word without the spirit is nothing it must be spirit and word some is the word no Spirit somewhere is the spirit no word but when you get the two together then there's a manifestation of the power of God so unquote so we see the church cannot run without the power of God the prophet said the anointing is confirmed the word and it is the anointing that breaks the Yoke so that breaks the Yoke so we need to have the anointing here we can have the word and preach word and the Bible says one scripture says the word is dead the letter is dead but you need the spirit to bring that word to life and many people don't preach the spirit so by God's grace we want to get down the anointing that's what we need to get back in the church because that will bring the world to pass because you can walk with the word the word and it means absolutely nothing but brother when an anointing come when you're going to see as we go along that makes the difference that shakes the demon because now he sees the Life coming walking with anointing of God and manifests itself and it breaks the Yoke the Yoke of wrong habits the Yoke of bondage the Yoke of sin the Yoke of unbelief and he says here will falling apart he says and so does the word of God you can't now brother Luke said there were 14 the speakers and we want to thank them until 11 o'clock so he says hey it the speakers must be floating for the past because he's going to float on the boats so I'm going to float on the course so you might bring members by the millions but you'll never bring down the power of God until you get back to the original word again back to a foundational word back to the blood back to Jesus Christ back to the old-fashioned family that would be the powerful so you can't bring the church a true life on the Dogma or an interpretation of the message you need to bring the church it only comes to life by the spirit that will bring it back to life again so we're going to get back to the world and once we get back to the within the anointing comes upon it and then it's manifested so not by traditional Dogma but by the blood of Jesus Christ and back to the vision word of God Stephen in the book of Acts repealed them Pharisees said you just like your fathers you always resist the Holy Ghost so people don't want that yeah but I know you want it I know that's why you are here but these people drove hundreds of miles to be here they want the Holy Ghost we want the spirit Hallelujah and even Stephen when he was stoning him he says you always resist the Holy Spirit but the chorus writer said yeah thanks because the writer said uh yes the holy ghost power that's keeping me alive and he says it will save you when you die it will stop you lying it will stop the devil's flying Hallelujah that's what the Holy Ghost does so you need to get in the spirit otherwise she's not going to get nothing no matter what you do I you can be a hoe you're gonna need the spirit you're gonna find out so you stiff neck and you show it your action speaks and he chose it uncircumcised of us they don't want the holy ghost power in the church but it will be there because it's a promise now that sucks that I mean that's just the Devils out because you know he said no you're happy because it's a promise brother it's hanging over you you climbing a taxi it's there brother you're on the job that promise is hanging over you and one day it will manifest itself now listen what he says here in deceived Church by the world the power of the Holy Ghost that's the secret place in the church come on man the Holy Ghost is the secret place in the church members nothing we need the Holy Ghost that's the secret of place in the church mine and when the church adopts educated preachers and big buildings and finally in the state of the whole old-fashioned Holy Ghost they better be in the Mission Again amen how are you gonna have a Revival of the Holy Ghost and people cringy amen they cringe it and bind it and are afraid of it there's where the trouble lies but brother we must get three men you must get loose you must get to an individual experience with God and don't be used don't you'll be the one that binds the spirit they try to bind the Holy Spirit they try to bind everything that will set them free if anything that will set them really bright that will save them free that's why so many are dying spiritually yep it's a Lifeline in the church it's going to help you young people so don't reject it it's gonna set you free it's gonna break the Yoke Hallelujah if your name is on that Lamb's Book of Life the Holy Ghost is on your track you're not going to escape the power of God is here to set you free Hallelujah he says here the fish of the trumpets the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denomination Rivers for almost 2 000 years but it is to be loose listen in the evening time listen in the evening time Hallelujah by the evening time message this releases the Holy Spirit yes the Holy Spirit back in the church Christ himself revealing human flesh in the evening time he said it and he promised him so what releases the Holy Spirit the message it's been bound by this denomination rivers and false interpretations but they are too late the evening time message releases the Holy Spirit oh I am so glad that's why I'm a Roger it's so important to preach the message of the end time Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] no this is where I got my my coat my title stats of a perfect man we're not building an organization I'm not here this morning to go is beautiful Christ never send me to board an organization can I send me to both listen individuals to the Statue of Christ they may be the powerhouse [Applause] man but God didn't sing to read this message he didn't come to give you mind better if you don't come to give you debating no but they come to burn individual store of our house [Applause] he says individuals to the state of Christ that they might be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the spirit amen by his word by his words he broke up the individual to that place not building organization or a greater denomination but both the individual to Sons and Daughters of God that's the idea see add to your faith virtue and virtue and knowledge well you come into that place now this message is to build individuals to a statue of Christ that they might be the PowerHouse amen and the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit now you can't resist the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit dwells in you that makes you a more house now what is a powerhouse it's a house full of power no I want to say something spoke to Luke said I said look uh you know that's Lord shed and he's throwing out the type of my preaching because now we're power outage so now the power goes out and I thought man it sometimes with my message but some curses [Applause] yeah the Sunday you see them in church the next Sunday you don't see them the power goes out but you know God's Powers [Applause] come on man you have a smile every day you come to the house of God with joy come on Hallelujah you don't see them now also God you must beg them to come early beg them to be in church come on God is moving on he's not going to wait on you man there's some people that wants it and you know what the game says one person if God could get one person in the Tabernacle he's gonna work with that person so all God needs is one person all your excuses is in vain the dogs are back into the Caravan moves on brother praise God and I wrote here and I spoke to Lucas said you pass these substations and there's one just up the road here and when you go past there you hear those Transformers buzzing there's a bus you hear the the current is moving we'll go through this the power you hear prepared you feel it amen and nobody is allowed to just go in there special people only [Applause] oh yes [Applause] you know what those Transformers run on he says they all they run on his oil that's why I think we have so much power outage maybe they ran out of oil come on brother don't run up over the Holy Ghost is here this morning say Lord my lights burning out I feel no cause no current nothing no power in my life no vehicle no confirmation I need oil looks at the guys that boy in The Orleans white suits on yes yes and they check in how low is your oil oh God let me not go there so it can't run out of oil then you lose your power [Music] oh it's load shading they were saying okay diesel is also form of oil they were saying it running out of diesel to keep these Transformers running I can stay on the whole day good with the restaurant of the word comes the restoration of the power power accomplished the baptism of the holy spirit amen and we read x18 you will receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you now many wants the power but the whole spirit is not there you have the word but you don't have the spirit and power to receive the baptism the holy ghost power to overcome sin power to live for God power to love your enemies power to get rid of your personal Philistines you know the personal things that upset you thoughts and grudges you need to get rid of it it's backing you down Prophet says one ought to gains sinner or Saint you might even hate your boss or your neighbor or the guy that saw you but he says you have to drop all of that [Music] speech power to witness to be a witness power to demonstrate the gospel how to change your life from a dranka to a saint from a prostitute to a daughter of God power from a drug addict to a Son of God that's the God we serve a god of Miracles a God that changes a God that heals a God that manifests I mean how many people didn't have covered in the church we prayed for them and did God heal them so is God here I mean is he confirming the word come on brother man Hallelujah he says you are possessing the enemy's gate in the Church of the Living God this morning lays the power to heal all sickness in the Church of the Living God lays power to overcome all temptation in the possession of the Church of God of the Living God this morning lays the power to change sin and throw it away and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the Church of Jesus Christ so it's not brother Raymond's Church in the Church of the Living God that's what David aired against Goliath how can this uncircumcised for the sign defy the armies of the Living God even even they were still the children of God [Applause] can't discern no matter what the world the people of God no matter how many mistakes they got they stole the Church of the Living God that's why you know me I write nobody off God goes right back to the person you write off and change that person's life and where's your comments then so this church is still the church under the lobby God with all the mistakes from the pulpit to the janitor room it's still the Church of the loving God individual that's a Powerhouse of God it's still working on you you might not be there but God is working on you you're gonna be there full with Power full with anointing [Applause] hallelujah amen friends you didn't come all these years eldest man forgot to fail you now God is Not Gonna fail you man this message is not gonna fall to the ground the angel of God is here to hold it up brother straight whether you like the man or not you don't like the way he comes his hair well there's no ales and now I might not like his bow part but it's fine he's still the servant of God God put me here and he put you there you know what brother Monty said God put you there just to amen Hallelujah to dare to pray to be a prayer Warrior to preach the word of God hallelujah and he didn't let the devil win I'm here to tell you church he didn't let the devil win [Applause] unquote he says all this power is laying dormant is laying in the church just waiting for someone in the church to anoint the power because it's a promise he says you're drawing he says here the deity of Jesus Christ the coming of the Son of God is throwing eye that's right and only those who are charged uh he says by the Holy Spirit Holy Ghost who have Immortal Life living in them Immortal Life living in them the Holy Ghost that's the type that's going to be drawn from here just as certain as anything so you can be full of the full of the word and not be drawn full of that Holy Ghost one Buddhist said he's coming for his Holy Ghost and those that have it will go with him so you can never over emphasize the importance of the Holy Spirit you I never over preach it the theme of every person was have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe [Music] and when you receive it then you act different you live different you can drop your own chicken forgive the worst enemy and you know that's where you already says that's a trouble in the church he says here there was something about the little old Ark in the days of Noah that floated on top of the water it was a drawing power from above there was a light on the top that the glory of God Shone from Heaven down upon the upper room and I tell you today friends hear my word he says hear my word uh there is a drawing power not from the church not from the pastor but from Glory he says what is it the baptism of the holy ghost moving down right in right in that right Channel so you see you have to be in the right channel you can't be sitting here in the wrong Channel oh so yeah you know what you know I and I don't want to go that way but somehow it must be said I'll be in the church in the wrong Channel you're not going to get nothing Jesus asked him who do men say I am then they say liar is Prophet today he said but who do you say and brothers says Peter was in the right channel among all the ones there he was in the right Channel all of a sudden you come a revelation and he said all the Christ the son of the Living God he says Peter flesh and blood didn't reveal that you but my Father in Heaven because you're in the right Channel bluffing yourself speaking you can sit that way and not no man you go out towards you ever brother Juma said you every time you come to service you go out worse or you go out better it's just a matter of time it plays out [Applause] a drawing power not from the pastor but for he says from Glory the baptism of the holy ghost moving down in that right channel to throw up a church what is it the power of God the excess to his life this name Zoe now I had this before I even came here but when I was reading last night I thought wow yeah we're dedicating Zone he says it's access to the life God's life you have exists now if God was here I mean we treat our boss with more respect than what we do God so who must come here with such reverence and humility and humbleness knowing God gave you a job he gave you food to eat you were dying that one time he's made your life your children different things and I you think I'm gonna come in here and waste my time brother I come in as humble as I can be seeking favor and for as you get to this age politics and next thing program says I'm not here for Deacon and bylaws he says I'm here for one reason the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's why I'm here brother the people need it more in the message than what whoever this we spoke about but now it's so needful and you're going to find what the foolish versions went all the way to the way this up and then found out they didn't have oil we could say they weren't in the message they want the message they put the same quotes and everything but you found out they ran out of oil when rubita right by the wedding but then it was too late amen now I say that's funny because all of them was in the same service what was it all of them was at the same conventions exposition of the seventh Church Jesus he says I was a Revelations 110 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice as they were trumpet I was in the spirit isn't that just beautiful my I love that you could just call those words the whole of the Christian Life he says you can call that words the whole of the Christian Life if I were going to live as a Christian I have to be in his spirit so yeah yeah there was is very different he says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day but he says here if you're going to live a Christian Life we have to be in his spirit so you come in here with your spirit amen and I expect everyone to bow to your spirit but you mustn't be in your spirit your spirit is enmity with God his Spirit you find favor with God so you have to be in his Spirit not how strong and how so you can't show nobody nothing you got to deal with God you have brother Brandon stay Friday night he said we're not playing Church man amen remember those guys came with the first thing and they wrote on their cancer and TV and Batman says man you came here to challenge the spirit of God he says but now because you challenge the spirit of God challenge they came right in the meetings of brother bran and challenge right in the house of God he says now you got it yeah another then the Holy Spirit can come down upon you follow you seal you give you what you want but you'll find out it's just a matter of time you're gonna see you're gonna get what you want [Applause] the whole of the Christian Life if I was going to live he says we have to have to have to be in his Spirit John was not talking about being in his own spirit that would not have brought these Visions so John was in his own Spirit he says it wouldn't bring all those Visions in and John had to come up higher he said John you two EarthBound see investing you're seeing that and you seen all that he says no John come up higher and when John came upaya he heard the trumpet voice of God then he showed him things to come you're not going to see the vision of God when you hear come up higher come in your spirit brother get her away from yourself then God begin to speak to him and show him what is to come Paul said I will pray in the spirit he says here it has to be the spirit of God With Us to all our efforts are in vain so all your own efforts are in vain yes be ye spirit all said I will pray in the spirit I will sing in the spirit I will live in the spirit if there is anything good that I will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word made manifest by the results it bears as surely as John needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous Revelations from Jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that God has given to us to Love by his word what is the same spirit so Hallelujah I have to get rid of my spirit I must decrease and he must increase brother M says his biggest enemy is you William Brennan he says if I can get William Branham out of the way God can do Mighty things if your God can get you out of the way and me out of the way we'll see the power of God walking through those benches Hallelujah man [Applause] Uncle so you have to get in the spirit and my I'm thinking of those specials was so beautiful man everything you do you do in the spirit you sing in the spirit you walk in the spirit you live in the spirit you pray in the spirit Revelation comes to you by the spirit no man can give you revelation you see this message is not an explanation faith it's a revelation you can't read it like you read a novel you got to read between the lines Hallelujah so no man can give you Revelation the Church of God is built upon revelation is what is the Holy Ghost today we don't walk by the shadow of the law we walk by the power of the Resurrection we walk by the power of the spirit who is our true seal our true Advocate our true comforter our true sign that we have been born from above peculiar people acting funny taking God in his word calling everything wrong God's word is right oh my that's what the Holy Ghost is do you want it would you love to have it well then it's yours you must want it you must come in hungry if you're not hungry you're gonna go out hungry but if you came in hungry horrible for you you must be thirsty blessed are those that hunger at first of the righteousness they shall be found [Applause] I almost said something some people Emily last week right till in my house when the holster come upon him at the baptism no he has something just to show you are important this is when the Holy Spirit come upon him at the baptism of John he become the anointed Messiah now remember he was the son of God when he was born he was God's virgin born son but when he became the Holy Ghost came upon him because Messiah means anointed one and he was anointed when when the Holy Ghost came upon him now in Jesus Christ born the Virgin son he is the word and yet he had to go to Jordan that's a man to receive what the Holy Ghost now who are you and me to say I don't need it I'm all right you know the right you need the Holy Spirit man to come upon you and there'll be a Vindication because a voice spoke from heaven and said this is my beloved Son in whom I miss to dwell in there was a Vindication though he was the word you who are you and me wow so we need the Holy Spirit and only when he became baptized with the Holy Ghost then he was the Messiah yes wow that's say the prophet and Paul Jesus was always the Son of God he was a virgin born son but when the spirit Came Upon him and the baptism he become God's anointed Messiah a man approved of God was signed in wonders the anointed one so when Stephen rebuked him for resisting the Holy Ghost says you want your wickedness crucified the Prince of Peace man and he was a man approved not of men of God of God Amen which signs and wonders he said if you don't believe me then believe the world because the works I'm doing justify of me amen what's wrong with the people today man you can see this message is right you can see the anointing is right it goes with word is manifested it's backed up by the Holy Spirit and yet they will resist it [Applause] said in Messiah Jesus said himself if I do know the works of my father then believe me not if I claim to have the anointing and do not the works of God because I am anointed of him he says it's not me that do the works the father dwelleth in me he do with the works and if I do not them works then don't believe me but if I do then believe him now that was the Messiah now it is a former science The church here comes he says are you ready John 12 14 uh John 14 12 Jesus said he that believeth me the works that he do shall he do also amen now he says Messiah yes that's right so now we must say it so that Spirit didn't leave Australia so you're walking in this brother you are Messiah the pull of fire the size of a pattern and you walk in this Dark World these demons easy brother and they back off when you walk through the town when you walk in the mall they see brother why you are Messiah oh what's what's his next one I'm a science the representation of Messiah on Earth is the church the representation of the Messiah on Earth so brother don't don't write yourself down then don't put yourself you're a messiah you are representative of the Messiah on the earth amen God has no representative but you so love that way act that way speak that way be that way hallelujah amen he was the Messiah the anointed one we are messiah's little ones that's the same spirit and he says that's the representation on the earth my who do you say this is give me a church oh this is my favorite one give me a church completely Anointed with God to the every accident movies thus say the Lord walking is a kind of Glory I'll show you Messiah and anointed one standing away on the earth so where's that Messiah going to be on the Earth when I fell when he fell upon Luther it manifested the promise of that hour when the fell upon Wesley it manifests the promise of that hour when he falls in this day it manifests the promise of this hour it's the Holy Spirit coming down to Quicken and make alive those that are for ordained of God to be in the Rapture now how can you resist you can't even go in the Rapture without it but it's here to Quicken and make a life now the word Quicken you know what it means to make a life those that are folding to go in the Rapture now the Holy Spirit comes to Quicken and make your life God help us what for brother and to go in the Rapture that is if you are a true ego now what's the prophet's word that's a few three a true Eagle you will understand the message you will understand the message of the hour if it's a true Eagle not the eagle little Eagle probably in the barnyard was eating all right but he knowed it wasn't just exactly right but when he heard the truth then you receive the truth now a true ego a true ego so the Holy Spirit Falls in this day manifest the word of the hour and he says that's because you have to pick in and make those alive that's for the Indigo in the Rapture the angel of the Lord is on the Earth moving around fixing everything for the coming of the Lord we're doing well in the church but God's just now loosening up the church everywhere getting in order now so he can get into the Rapture yes so now you stumble at me but meantime you don't see the Holy Spirit loosening you the past is called higher no one can live higher than the person I don't care how you study what you can't live ahead in the past that's God's Lord's works yeah and you won't believe I pick up things in the spirit day at home so I I can come here I had a different message but I thought no I want to encourage you my first time back write it down I'm not here but shows me things I'm gonna just drop something quickly that's what the Bible says obey yes them did what has the room over you so don't treat me like nothing I have the rule of you and the past is a suspicious man not a congregation he says the pasties so when I see you not in the service hey I'm suspicious I see you in the church you don't like me but outside you're talking I'm suspicious I see you clicking and cleaning I see you parcel yes I become suspicious maybe that's what made me sick because he meant to slap makes lovely yes worry nobody else man so where's the way the word obey yes the Pastor said not even me progress is half an hour early we walk in here the Pastor said how many times in a nice early [Applause] we stay with my message is there another church but God says not loosen up the church so he's loosening up so don't look at this I'm getting it no he's loosening you up then you must see the Uncle you miss it yes Mother Father you miss it he says here obey the voice of God God deliver the children of Israel when they were in bondage and they couldn't help themselves but today God's people are not in bondage spiritually for they are delivered by the power of the Holy Spirit no man has to stay in bondage no you are set free by the power of the Holy Spirit if you in bondage you want to save in bondage you understand your sin you understand your own Spirit oh this is your man has to stay in bondage of sun any longer because the Holy Spirit brings him from the bondage of sun so if you want to stay bound you want to be like that there's more oh yeah and I'm preaching to them man there's more fire for God there's more that wants it and I can see there on your faces God will respect that God will hear your prayer he will set you free he'll give you the results of your heart he will touch you by his spirit amen we're not prison for popularity we're not preaching for a big name if I wanted a big name man I will just check in coming here 61 years in the ministry and my head is still the same size never got big never will get beat listen man but if you put me here you're gonna have to put up with me as long as I'm here he didn't let the devil win [Applause] and I ain't playing games and I ain't begging nobody Hallelujah time of playing is over praise God you know when the when the shepherd's loaded then everyone does what they want to yeah everyone is in Authority everyone is doing this and that hey yesterday man God allowed me to get sick too to show up your spirit yeah show up your spirit now we understand I'm not even on the scene and already it's like Paul said man with my departure Grievous Hooves is going to come in I'm not even gone and the wolves are already yes preempting and doing everything come on man wait on your pasta wait on the Lord my God something so powerful man Samuel didn't wait a soul didn't wait for Samuel to come and do the offering and because you know what he said I was the king I can do what I want to and then he offered up yasi when Samuel came erupted he says your kingdom is not the part he says because God don't work through the king he worked with the prophet [Applause] you see we we welcome popularity who's on my side and who's on the forget it that time is over man chances are starting by the hundreds doesn't mean nothing today he's building an individual powers you know Godfrey and I must say this in church to you you know what I'm looking for at this age my question is have I done enough for Jesus I was lean and I said Lord I don't know if my time is up if I'm going and you know they ain't making preach this thing took me so by surprising you know I was coming in I was gonna make an announcement and then this thing hit me righteous yes and then somebody took it out and it went like wildfire couldn't wait on the past to come that's all you had to do wait until the pastor comes back now you preempting stories running all over sad on you man we're supposed to be a scripturally trained Church where's your train in all those years I've been I tried to be an example I was here quarter past nine nobody here that's how I am I try to be example and I expect people to pick up that example dress properly come right but you people don't pick up that they don't see and you still find people walking in your half past 10 half pasting Now where's your obedience to the word now it's not even me saying that you say you love the Lord but where's your obedience yes and Obey them that they have the rule over you so you feel I can't rebuke you yeah man wow so we better think sober [Applause] in front of you must be because of a little thing like that issue and but baby says I'm not even here for bylaws and deacons and stuff but I'll say yeah for one purpose the Holy Spirit God delivered the children this is the way his voice he says so you don't need to stay in bondage so people that stay in bondage they want to but he says the blood was offered so you you yield you delivered you said free you don't need to go on with that habit and sisters with unsafe boyfriends brothers and savior I mean you so long the message they now give up sad man said and we're losing young people by the hundreds because they can't wait on the glory and you think God don't know I send someone a message and he didn't answer and then I thought ah let me delete it and he had a nice little logo forgot and he said they Jesus saw what you deleted I almost wanted to write back Jesus saw what you read but you see Jesus knows recognize your day in this message National Force put Israel in the Homeland National Force will put the church in the world Council of churches but the power of God will pull the people in The Cry No National

were in the PowerHouse when God was pouring it out and still you have uh low cherry yeah promise Lord help us you got to be convinced now this is my closing quote convincing concerned he said destroy it I'll raise it up again thoroughly convinced now that's a problem also I think in the message people are not convinced because if you convince then you'll be on time you all must serve as you be at every service yeah we're begging the people just to come to church and the sun we want to open Wednesdays but you get them to get them on a Sunday now is your experience genuine I got a question even the people are sitting at home and watching on live stream when the power of God is here there's no live stream that you can uh compare with being in a live service no way [Applause] a word you might be paying your tithes and offering he said but moral support being in church makes you a true member I am paying my ties so I'm okay no you're not okay why are you not in church sure I'll raise it up again he says hallelujah scriptures can't fail I'm convinced that he's the same yesterday today in the ministry that the message that I'm preaching just what's a prophet I'm convinced in the ministry and the message I'm preaching I'm convinced is the truth now you want to question this or people walking away when the prophet said I believe this one I'm convinced I'm convinced that it's the truth I'm convinced that these Visions come from God I'm convinced we're living in the last days my we can stand man while I read this quote how old man just rejoice and give God praise he says we're living in the last days I'm convinced that the spirit that's on me now is the Holy Spirit and I'm convinced that that's on me now is the holy spirit brother next time we come from here to here and there amen not always point to them but they say me me I feel like a Powerhouse I feel I'm passing with the power of God who said I'm going out anointed I'm going out different amen yeah I always say you say you so where's your show me yourself amen show me your zero what's up I'm confused that that's only the Holy Ghost Glory I'm thoroughly convinced I'm convinced that the Holy Ghost why is the right way I'm convinced that the Bible weighs the truth I'm convinced that this is Jesus Christ here now I'm convinced if we believe him at this minute I'm convinced that he would heal every sick person in a moment in a twinkling of an eye I convinced he would pour out the Holy Ghost upon you till there would be such a shout till it will be hard to tell what would take place so you have to be convinced speaking like this and a love spirit will drop down listen to this quote he says you are in of all the wrongs in the church he says all the wrongs will be made right [Music] so it's not going to take any man to make the wrongs right that long spiritual drop down make all the wrongs right and he says the sick will be healed without even hands laid upon me [Music] wow he said it I thought it would be hard to tell what will take a race I believe from my heart not because I'm an old man I preached this when I was a kid and I just told you 61 years I was 16 17 years and I still feel the same way so you think anything is going to change me ah sin too much man and when I was a kid not over 20 years old I've been convinced since that day he met me on the river Hallelujah and convinced that he's here now you must be convinced that the pillow fire is the same full of fire that was with Israel in the wilderness is the same pool of fire with a church today so yes we're bringing the church the same pool of Fire he's here my that was with the inner Israel and wholeness is the same qualified with the church today Glory says I'm convinced that it's right I'll give my life for it I left home and everything else give everything over I'm convinced it's the truth I'm convinced he's here now and I'm convinced that this Spirit that's here now is the holy spirit oh I'm convinced that we baptize into his Spirit right now I know it's the truth and fairly convinced that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today in favor I'm convinced perfectly convinced that the angel met me up there and told me what he did I stood before heathens before thousands and tens of thousands say aren't you afraid so he says no I'm convinced it come from God I'm convinced because it was scriptural now I preached this way because this message is already Vindicated I don't have to vindicate it was Vindicated by an Angel it was Vindicated by the power of fire all we gotta do is preach it he will back it up and you can't set the time limit on God [Music] I'm convinced that it comes from God I'm convinced because it was scripture my I'm convinced that it is the angel of God I believe it with all my heart amen I'm convinced if he would if we would ask God for anything he'd give it to us just scared don't be scared Jesus is here man let's borrow it and I want you if you have a situation in your life this morning just say Lord I'm raising my hand bye God bless you man that's beautiful is there someone else you say I got a need I'm sick in the body I'm tired I feel so faint and weak Lord give me Grace

leave us comfortless but you'll be with us Lord a Powerhouse Lord you said you didn't come brother and said incapable denomination so talk about bigger churches but they come to build individuals to the PowerHouse and Lord when we look back the first time the Holy Ghost fell upon that early church how they were powerhouses wherever they went be the shadow fell upon the people he was a Powerhouse and they would jump up God they met the man at the gate and said sermon go every now but such as I have I'm a Powerhouse of God lord may you make those people today power houses Lord may we add to our free virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity Lord you say Lord a man that has these qualities is a man that's great in the Rapture you said the seven fondness will
