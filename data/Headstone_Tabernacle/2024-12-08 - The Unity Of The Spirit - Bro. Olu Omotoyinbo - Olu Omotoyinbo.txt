I the ministers in the church are here and um um some of our deacons are here also and then um some of the Believers are here also but I bring GS from Legos and from My Wife and the family and singu brother Isaac um brother Isaac all right brother Isa and sister Grace for the invitation to be here again n we I think if anybody um deserves any Commendation is brother Isaac in this context here because he's held this meeting s for like 30 years or so now I mean such faithfulness is is really remarkable Isaac We Salute You salute you thank you thank you and to The Headstone charity Tabernacle that supported him all these years we do our hearts to you for staying with the pastor and doing all that you need to do to uh receive us each time we come and um to to um hat to so many people from different backgrounds different needs different desires and ACC Commendation and different things is really commendable I want to say thank you to the ministry the helps and governments of the church thank you so much for always making us feel at home in are I always feel at home and I know that's the testimony of many other people also and to the pastors the ministers the I think the pastor M were already introduced this morning and the Believers from different churches and attendance today you could have been your own services but you chose to come here I want to say thank you because like I always say and many ministers always say if there no people we will not have a convention so between the minister and the people I think the people are more needed to make a convention than the the preachers so we thank you for coming and being faithful and such a good audience to like brother said last night the minister doesn't bring the Revival the people bring the Revival and so to have really you know going into the spirit of the meetings and to have had the kind of services that we have had want to say thank you to each and every one of you and so um my brothers and fellow ministers who have spoken and those who are going to speak behind me I missed the first day even though I saw snatches of it while coming on the way in between I mean various other things and I listened to brother Stefanos you know yesterday morning I mean online also but I caught um the afternoon service and brother Gideon and then last night brother um Kam I know brother brother Isaac and the two Isaac spoke on Friday and brother Isaac over in the evening and so we um I have to speak this morning so I want to say I feel it's a honor and a privilege because I knew I mean some of the brothers like I I mean no disrespects men but with with gladness in my heart I knew when Isaac oid was a very young man I knew when brother stepanos was like small enough to stay in the in the not the boat like the cover up but in the you know like a wagon sleep at the back with his siblings I mean and him when he was that small so to be on the field together with them like they're like you know I feel I feel really blessed and they see God blessing them their Ministries I feel really blessed really blessed and brother Gideon from from Uganda you experienced brother Gideon yesterday so I mean those of you who never knew him and um brother Gideon was talking about all Nigeria you need to go to Uganda and let brother Gideon kill you with Ugandan Hospitality ban is a really really sweet brother and he really sings great too really sings great I have a collection of songs that brother Gideon sings and I think I've told him enough so when he has a few of those he sends them to me so I listen to them and he really sings great some sing and some preach pretend to sing someone like me I pretend to sing but he sings so blon thank you for coming to Nigeria we really appreciate you so much thank you so much and brother Keta I was just asking him what was his ttle last night so he said because I knew was something about Unity of the spirit because he had given his tle before I came in and I didn't remember to check it up so he said IND of the Spirit uh um produces the UN of the faith and I said wow really that's that's that's interesting I said because that's my message really so I I think the Holy Spirit must be there somewhere you know working around there somewhere so but but don't be um because he brought the message last night so again there are those who preach and there are those who pretend to preach so um um no seriously so uh but that wasn't the outstanding last night was wasn't that outstanding that was that was last night yesterday afternoon morning totally outstanding to [Applause] out God bless you so I will um um I'll try not to hold you too long one of my one of the young boys little boy like he's about I think he some five or six in church in Lagos I asked me recently when are you coming to speak I said when you promise me you won't sleep when I'm speaking so he said no no I I I won't sleep if you don't preach too long so I tell we noty Bo get away from me little thing five five six years old so God bless you bless you if you can stand to your feet I'd like to read two scriptures one scripture actually um Ephesians 4 um verses 1- 6 and then I'll also read verses 11- 16 Ephesians 4:1 reads on these wise I therefore the prisoner of the Lord like brother Gideon was telling on yesterday to become that like it said that when you surrender all is the only surrender that gives you Victory any other type of surrender doesn't guarantee you Victory in Jesus but when you surrender all when you walk with the Lord like brother the G yesterday then you are guaranteed Victory in Jesus because when he's by your side you are y with him he's never lost a battle and he will never lose a battle so I therefore the pron of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation where with ye are called with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace there is one body and one Spirit even as he are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all I go on on to verse 11 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the Perfection of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith in verse three was the unity of the SP spirit and in verse 13 10 verses later till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man these are the things that constitute the unity of the faith the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man a perfect man the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ a full mature stature in Jesus Christ so that we end forth be no more children T to and and carried about with every wind of Doctrine and by the SL of men and Corning craftiness whereby the LI in weit to deceive bir speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual walking in the measure of every path maketh the increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love amen may the Lord add his to the reading of his holy words you may please be seated I got a tile the unity of the spirit um I got a few con scriptures you don't have to open them I'll read I'll read um one or two of them or two of them actually um ionic scripture Genesis 1: 26-28 which is where it all started from on the face of the Earth Here amen Joel 2 28-31 Acts 2 vers 1 to8 now we know jeel to I mean jeel to in the last days I poured my spirit upon All Flesh and that promise that we all know about so much but if you know the promise was I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh in other words there's going to be a union of the spirit of God and the Flesh of man God's spirit is going to be anointed into the Flesh of man and then when on the day of Pentecost came and they were filled with the Holy Ghost Peter inspired by the spirit said that this is that which was spoken by Joel the prophet in other words the baptism of the Holy Ghost was the Fulfillment of this promise that the spirit will anoint I mean will Unite with the Flesh of man and on the day of Pentecost they had a little more than what you and I talk about receiving the baptis of the Holy Ghost for breth they had much more than that they had it all the way up to where the world was living in their flesh so to speak the unity they were United with the faith they were uned with the word of the hour amen amen so jel 2: 28-31 in here has the promise in this verses here that the spirit of God and the Flesh of man will be United together so when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not so to say like oh me have been filled no it's a little more than that oh I also have been filled thank God no it's a little more than that it's God's spirit coming into your soul but he wants to find an abod in your flesh that's what they had to where when they walk their Shadow was the spirit of God and it went over sick people and they were healed even without hands being laid upon them sir jel 2 and verse 28 and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see Visions That's All Flesh it means no one is left out it doesn't mean every every everybody on the street know every category the young the old the men the women the boys the girls everybody is included in this economy of God Amen there's no cast system here there's no racial profiling here there's no profiling of any sort in this Kingdom amen are you hearing [Applause] me because sometimes I speak so fast I don't even hear myself so if you're not hearing me just I make you the class janitor just let me know they're not hearing me there was one time I SP in a convention a brother said I heard you well today said I said really said yes I don't hear you I said wow that's that's really serious that's really serious so I hope you're hearing me too well enough okay all right upon the sabath upon the handmaids in those days will I pour my spirit everybody other the servants handm whoever they are and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the Great and the terrible day of the Lord come that was the promise I pour my spirit upon Alles how is he going to be nobody knew but on the day of Pentecost the Fulfillment Peter inspired interpreter that scripture and the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God the manifestation is the interpretation once you see the manifestation nobody needs to interpret the word has interpreted itself amen that's what happened to of Pentecost and Acts 2 verse1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one according one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and they fill all the house where they were sitting and there were and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with all tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and they were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man had them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marel saying one to another behold are not all these we speak galileans and how hear we every man in our tongue where we were born I keep on down to verse 14 but Peter standing up with 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and herken to my words for these are not drunk as you suppose see it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel you are witnessing history here you are witnessing God coming down and uniting with [Applause] man what did J speak verse 17 and it shall come to pass in the last days sayeth God I will pour out my Spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and all my servants and all my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy it said I will pour out off my spirit I don't want to get into all of that but so this is not making you the holy spirit because you can never be the Holy Spirit of my Spirit we receive a portion of the spirit the only person that did not receive the Holy Spirit by measure was the Lord Jesus Christ because he is the holy spirit but we receive the Holy Spirit by measure amen I will pour off my spirit amen you may be seated so when I'm saying the Holy Spirit anointed in your body don't say oh yeah but the old is also saying you become the Holy Spirit no don't hear what I am not saying amen and so we just side step that and I'm not going to get into all that stuff amen just wanted to be clear all [Music] right I will pour out of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in Heaven above and signs in the earth beneath Among Us here signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that what whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved is a day of salvation amen so you can see Unity of the spirit Unity of the faith what is unity of but Isaac's inspiration to gather us together Unity of the faith what is does it mean it simply means United with the faith that's what it means the union that the faith brings when you and the faith are united or anyone and the faith are united that's the union that they bring like a man and woman at United say that's husband and wife amen and the faith like brother Isaac so beautifully brought to us this morning already is the word of God the message the Lord Jesus Christ for this day for what every age but for this day the fullness of the atonement the fullness of signs wonders and miracles that's the message for this day that's the faith in this day here amen so Unity of the faith is that message and you United and becoming one hallelujah amen the Bible say faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God Amen so here we are we have a promise there going to be a Unity of the faith but how does this Union come about who officiates this Union this is the faith this is you who's going to do the journey together how you get to connect that with the faith and that's what we just read the Holy Spirit does this Union the holy spirit is the officiating Minister the holy spirit is one that connects you together with the faith Hallelujah the Holy Spirit unites the individual with the faith the word the Lord Jesus Christ like any officiating Minister unites the man and the bride unites a man and his wife together the holy spirit is uniting you with the faith hallelujah amen so Unity of the faith is when the spirit of God unites with man with the Flesh of man so it's not just uniting in your heart unites with the flesh flesh flesh of man flesh means it's going to be [Music] sin amen you of faith is the word made flesh and you and I know we've been well taught right that takes place when this briad comes to adoption adop at adoption the Lord Jesus Christ is reproduced in flesh again that's what they had in the book of Acts that's what they had in that original Ephesians church that brother Isaac spoke about on Friday Jesus was manifesting their flesh and they took notice with them that they had been with Jesus they saw them they said there goes Jesus these people are like that guy called Jesus at adoption Jesus Christ is reporing flesh again and when the bre comes with perfection that's what happens on Souls that are in prison now brother bam said three is perfection the ministry come to its Perfection when you reproduce Christ again in natural natural In the Flesh in other words amongst human beings as was predicted adoption time that's when this bride you sitting here me all of us here together his promise Amen to to to be connected together with the faith we won't just speak it it will become our clothing our very flesh will become the the Flesh of the word amen hallelujah of some time the word is made flesh in the bright amen that's when is um prophesied what brother said at that Perfection of the coming of a Son of God so you need of the faith is adoption time the word made flesh in you that's the promise that's ahead of us that's the promise that we are goinging for that's when we are holding for that's what we're going for that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes to you to set you on that Journey for your baptism is only a St because you have a destination for the world to hang in your flesh for the spirit to move from your soul into your flesh amen hallelujah according to Ephesians 4 verse 11-6 that we just read a fful Ministry is prophesied to take this bride to the unity of the faith adoption time and that's why the most important job any Minister can do is to prepare their people for the coming of the Lord how do you prepare the people get them ready get them into the unity of the spirit so that they can so that it can produce the UN of the faith not to tell stories about this church that church this man that man I'm better than this one this one here that not for none of that not for anything like that when you get into the Realms of the unity of the spirit all that nonsense goes out of the door Hallelujah you may be [Applause] seated amen so we have a goal our goal is perfection our goal is adoption our goal is the word made flesh our goal is signs wonders and miracles the sick being healed demons casted out with hands being laid on that's our goal can somebody say amen amen I hope it doesn't sound like a story to you or carail to you amen but that's our promise you may be seated amen amen so our goal is the unity of the faith where we're going to be United with the faith it's not it's not me United with you that's what theity of the spirit is about for you and I to be United together before you each one of us United with the faith because many timesed fath like we United we're in we united we are un that's that's you are belittling this gospel [Music] sure you need to be United with the people and that's what I'm I'm that's what I've been spoken about in this convention and that's what I'm putting my shoulder to the wheel to talk about still in this convention but that's what the UN of the spirit is about and that's why you will never get to un of the faith without coming through the UN of the spirit it's not going to happen because because brother bam said I mean the book of Acts said they were in one mind one Accord what is that Unity of the spirit there belov nowhere else but in the bride what produces that Unity of the spirit until we get to that spot there's no Unity of the faith so first things thrust amen you may be seated so in the promise of the unity of the faith is Veil is hidden a promise of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit which is what will in the last days uh jel said Peter said last days when is these last days T they standed right there on the day of Pentecost and we are still in the last days amen when the closing seconds of the last days that's why the promise is relevant to them and relevant to us also hallelujah amen amen and like we already pointed according to Acts 2 and I mean J 228 and ask you the baptism of the Holy Ghost is how the spirit of God unit with your flesh did you get that without the baptis the Holy Ghost you are a Believer that's fine but you don't have the spirit of God working in your flesh that's why you will struggle that's how you will struggle against sin that's how you will struggle against backb that's why you struggle against basic things because the power is the holy spirit Paul said I know that that is in my flesh there lies not one good thing so stop struggling you can't get it done by your struggles that's why many people are struggling and they get frustrated relax come get the Holy Ghost at the last day of the feast which is this day Jesus stood up and said amen he that believeth in me out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water come to the Fountain and drink the Holy Ghost is here for you to baptize your soul with fire and bur the snake out of there and the spirit will begin to go into your flesh to live a Christian Life oh Hallelujah you may be [Applause] seated so I promise that they we are going to come until they all come to the unity of the faith in there is the promise veiled of the outp of the Holy Ghost so we have a right to expect in every service in every convention every time every day at home at school at play at work amen because you have a promise hanging over us B the Holy Ghost because the baptism is how the spirit of God unites with the Flesh of man in other words to come to the unity of the faith that's promised us for this day there is going to be an outpouring of the B of the Holy Ghost how many understand that say amen amen and we saw that in the book of Acts and he wrote a book of Acts behind them only one man stood of Peter one man not an angel a man stood up and said this is that this is the Fulfillment of what the prophet said what you are seeing is what you seeing here is the holy spirit joining up with the Flesh of men the baptism of the Holy Spirit you may be seated was the fulfillment in the book of Acts of the promis in Joel that the spirit of God will Unite with the Flesh of men like the spirit of God United in a body of Flesh in Mary and produced the son of God when the spirit of God unites your [Music] flesh that's what's going to produce the Son of God and it happened before amen St Luke 1:35 and the angel answered and said unto Mary the Holy Ghost shall shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee th the apping in your flesh therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God the spirit of God like you today Came Upon Mary that young virgin girl thinking on the word the spirit of God Came Upon her and the spirit of God United the Flesh of Mary with the spirit of God and he produced the son of God God's example his son the second Adam the Lord Jesus Christ Spirit come down anoint Mary in our flesh I me anoint Mary and the spirit anoint aned join up with the Flesh and produce the Son of God and that Son of God the Lord Jesus CH was God example seat son let me read you this here on the spoken word is original seat brother said 163 then the works will be manifested in him are the same for is the same seed the word of God God's son was his example seed and what his life was when the spirit poured upon him after his baptism and the Holy Ghost come upon him the very life that he produced well that same watering Spirit of the Holy Ghost will bring forth the same kind of a life doing the same things that he did if is the same seed son of God's seed will bring forth a son of God's seed in other words in other words when this Brad comes to the unity of the faith when the Holy Spirit anoints her anoints the word into her flesh what's going to happen she will she must necessarily produce the same kind of life that Jesus lived after his baptism she must produce that it can't be anything but that Hallelujah she must live the same kind of life and she must do the same kind of works that he did because he was God's example s son that was the second Adam the Lord Jesus our example sit son God's example sit son and that's the life that the the bride will also produce when she comes to the unity of the faith the word may flesh like Jesus amen and because were God's example sit son it means every Son of God must come to manifestation the same way that he came it's not about being a Son of God it's about being a manifested Son of God I don't doubt that you are a son of God but in the Bible is the manifestation that's what what we're talking about Adam was a son in Genesis 1 126 and 28 but until that what wased into his flesh Genesis 2:7 you saw no son so the first Adam come exactly the same way like the second Adam come by the spirit of God anointing the word into his flesh uniting the world with his flesh amen Genesis 12628 was the spirit of God Genesis 126 let us make M our image the seed the promise Amen in Adam's Soul representing the baptism of the Holy Ghost and God made created man in his own image the creation come after the baptism adding the nature of God adding the seven spirits of God to the spirit baptism to create the Son of God in the image of god let's make man in our image image of the word the forming of the word image and Genesis 1: 26-28 was Adam baptized with the Holy Ghost was Adam the holy ghost coming upon him to to pull out of his seat seven spirits to stand in the nature perfect nature of God the measure of the stature of the fullness amen but it wasn't manifested yet but when the spirit of God the word image in his soul United with the Flesh in Genesis 2:7 Adam the first Son of God on the face of the Earth was manifested on the earth then that's when the walk could see that's when every body could see there's a Son of God on the face of the earth a manifested son Adam became a Son of God and amatal God on the earth ruling the Earth with power and glory and Authority on behalf of God his father that's how Adam came the spirit anointed the word into his flesh that's how Jesus came the spirit anointed the word into Mary's flesh and when he received the B himself the spirit anointed the word into his flesh and because every son must come to manifestation all nature is groaning for the revelation of the sons of God for the manifestation of the sons of God and this is how sons of God come to manifestation by the spirit anointing the world into their flesh Hallelujah because every son must come to manifestation in exactly the same way as God's examples his son came because of that as a result of that we have a promise from the prophet of Malachi 4 that more sons of God are coming back coming back to be like Jesus coming back to be like Adam the word in their flesh Hallelujah the glory of God around them that's our promise amen amen we are coming back to a Unity of the faith where the spirit of God will once again Unite with the Flesh of man and sons of God will be manifested on the earth once more like it was on the day of Pentecost once more like what with Jesus once more like what Adam amen manifested Sons it will be a super sign God and man together Hallelujah on adoption part four tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the Son of God was ever to be manifested out of this time now when was there a time in the history going all the way back amen there was to manifest the time to deliver all nature nature the nature itself is growing waiting for the time of the manifestation and human beings are not waiting for for the time of the manifestation nature is growing in waiting for the time of the manifestation why before the atonement was made before the atonement was made in the Old Testament year before Christ came before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out before the Old Testament on down there there couldn't have been manifestation because it takes the Holy Spirit to anoint the word into flesh there couldn't have been a manifestation hallah in other words they could not come to the unity of the faith in the Old Testament because it takes the Holy Spirit the fullness of the holy spirit all seven parts of him to anoint the word into your flesh and they'll see Jesus because it's not one spirit it's all seven spirits God fully God in manifestation as in a Sevenfold nature of his being amen before the atonement was made amen that could not have been manifestation it had to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone he's telling you something he's telling you that is adding to the life of Jesus Christ which he preached years later on the statute of a perfect man amen it had to wait till this time all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of sons of God coming back and the spirit of God that's what I'm telling you and the spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly when you hear that it mean a seven spirit because seven that's the fullness of the spirit amen and the spirit of God coming to this man so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ till rejoin him and his church together they'll be become flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life Spirit of his spirit amen Jesus Christ walking in human skin again oh there's your promise for the unity of the faith your promise that sons of God are coming back like Adam like Jesus like the book of Acts that's your promise hallelujah oh hallelujah amen Amen on a super sign 959 and another thing paragraph 70 the word was made flesh dust and dwelt Among Us Jehovah the word became human became D and Tabernacle with us everlasting sign shall never end oh when we think of it an eternal sign the super signs of all signs God becoming one of us then again he must be the Seed of Abraham Abraham of course was the seed of Eve what this Prophet here Abram was the seed of Eve was the woman seed that was to br head but Abraham if you can catch it I'm reading he had faith in God which United the spirit of God with the Flesh of man that's the unity of the faith right there that's where the faith come that's why it could be the Abram seed not of flesh but the uniting of spirit and flesh together god making himself cheering out rooting out all evil bringing into submission the flesh the dust that created and live with you and in you as a partner hallelujah hallelujah so friends we have promised a Unity of the faith adoption time but how do we get there how do we get to this the spirit anointing the war into our flesh how do we get there you may be seated so we promised you of the faith adoption time but before that promise can come to pass there must of necessity be a Unity of the spirit first and that's why say that's why we are failing that's why the church is failing on that walk brother benam said so not me saying it Unity of the spirit before Unity of the faith Ephesians said so Unity of the spirit vers Ephesians 4:3 Unity of the faith Ephesians 4:13 Unity of the spirit before Unity of the faith un of the spirit before adoption time before signs wonders of miracle sure we have signs wonders and miracles now but you haven't seen nothing yet no this is not to say you back up and you don't pray for the SI now we we pray for the we cast out Devils even right now like last night cast those Devils out but you know the trouble of is many many of us make Faith so complicated one thing that always as telling me about brother bam you made Faith so simple he was like was Liv in a realm that where was so simple you didn't have to Nash his teeth and struggle with believing struggle with believing and that's how many of us understand faith and that's why we don't get what we ask for because without faith is impossible to please God the only way we're getting it from God is e by your National Spirits by your tribal Spirits none of that is the unity of the holy spirit in the people me United with the Holy Spirit you United with the Holy Spirit and we unite together in the Church of the Living God waiting for the holy Spirit to unite all of us together with the faith can you say Amen in un of the spirit a Unity brought about by the Holy Spirit to come into one mind one Accord like they had on the day of P when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all not some all with one mind and one Accord Unity of the spirit a Unity of the spirit a Unity brought about by the Holy Spirit to love one another above everything else no divisions no schisms just pure plain brotherly and sisterly love like brother Isaac was exting us this morning just your PL Holy Ghost love not lovey doy you know the mistake we make many times when we talk about love because we are human beings we have love and sometimes we don't even have the love we claim to have so when we talk about the love of God we see God like that like God has love when you say God loves me we see that God has Love sometimes he exhibits it sometimes he doesn't but no the Bible says the essence of God is love you are not the Bible didn't say for you are love but he say God is love in other words everything God does that's love speaking when love corrects that's God speaking when God corrects when God rebukes when God does whatever that's love speaking when he hears the sick that's go that's love speaking I hope I get to it but that's okay if I don't the word has already gone you may be seated on the message you may be seated the arrow of God's Deliverance I can show you quote after quote after quote of brother bham and the and the the the unity of the spirit on the Arrow of God Deliverance sh from a bow August the ver 956 you may be seated paragraph 21 so now dear people you here in shrip let this be a warning to you if you believe me to be God's servant listen the best thing for you to do R Life Tabernacle and everywhere else is keep an oldfashioned prayer meeting going and keep keep the unity of the spirit is quoting from Ephesians 4 and ver3 to keep the unity of the spirit and then he goes ahead to outline what things constitute what things make up keeping the unity of the spirit and keep the unity of the spirit number one keep looking up and watching for the coming of the Lord keep all the world worldness out of you no matter how bad it hurts circumcised by the Holy Ghost will cut away the worldly things now begin to see a lot of worldness creeping into you so now get that out no matter how bad it is Life Tabernacle I'm talking to you you Baptist Brethren uh uh uh talk to your people over there the same way Unity of the spirit what does he do gets an old fashioned premion going keep make you keep looking out for your Redemption D now watching for the coming of the Lord makes you keep all the worldliness out of you no matter how bad it hurts keeps you circumcised by the holy spirit amen and cut every worldliness off of you on hearing him 957 January 25 now notice just just a few moments I want to say this before I start preaching that the greatest need of healing tonight and the sickest body that I know in all of the world is the body of the Lord Jesus the church oh it is horribly sick it is broke up and Scattered that's the sickness broke up and Scattered and needs a healing how will this healing come by the unity of the spirit a Unity brought about to heal this cing and these divisions a healing body by the Holy Spirit here's what's proping here the church is horribly sick is so broke up and Scattered it needs a healing may God send the holy spirit in such a power till the whole body of Jesus Christ will be brought together bond with love and unity Holy Spirit bringing Unity Unity of the spirit until then you will see things Happ happened that you never thought of before Jesus will come when the church gets like this and then it will be over here's another one God's provided a way of approach to Fellowship um 9th of July 960 here is speaking of the conditions that the unity of the spirit will address and set right is praying bless every organization in the valley all the Blessed people the ministers and the pastors of the different denominations maybe we might dis agree upon some theological teachings of the scripture but further in all one principle be we believe in God the Eternal one that those of us who make like we know more than the prophet and we must maintain the status quo they don't belong in our group so we have nothing to to do with that group this is the prophet that brought the word this is the prophet I tell people a prophet has been in the land you may be seated I see I see my time is gone and I I I I haven't even got started yet really no brother Isaac Sunday afternoon is coming Sunday afternoon is coming no I'll try to I'll try to I'll try not to hold you too long so um um so Unity of the spirit is going to address Stu is going to correct conditions is going to is the phys great physician in the room to heal the sickness in the body that's the purpose of the unity of the spirit and what this Prophet here begin to tell you the things that the unity of the spirit was addressed and correct and set right bless every organization in the valley all the Blessed people the ministers and pastors of different denominations maybe we might disagree upon some theological teachings of the scripture but father all in one principle we believe in God the Eternal one so help us Lord in all these divisions help us Lord to have Unity of the spirit until until Unity of the faith is brought forth in the midst of the divisions in the midst of the differences let us have Unity of the spirit until the the unity of the faith is brought forth thus said Malachi for the prophet [Applause] amen and when the angel of the faith is brought forth when we shall see him face to face then then then we will see eye to eye but presently while keeping the unity of the spirit we may not see eye to eye does that justify the scattering the sickness in the body being maintained no I know you don't believe me but I'll I'll show you until that time until the UN of the faith is brought forth May the Holy Spirit bless us in our efforts that we put forth for we ask it in Jesus name amen can all the people say Amen all the effort we are putting forth to keep to keep to maintain the unity of the spirit while we are waiting for the angel of the faith I've got another quote you may be se you may be [Applause] seated the power of transformation October 3 1965 and to think that you can come apart and gather like this whereas the psalmist said behold how sweet and pleasant for Brethren to dwell together in unity is like the anointing all that was on Aaron's Beed that run to the hems of his garments which that anointing all which you know what the anointing all done it preserved him to go in the presence of God see he had to be Anointed with that oil before he went in the presence of God and when when Brethren can dwell together in unity is unity of the spirit not Unity of your belief of your doctrine of your group Unity of the spirit I'll show you the unity that the spirit brings about and when Brethren can draw together in unity is liken unto that oil the oil of the Holy Spirit when bre can DW together in unity that's the Holy Spirit there because the holy spirit is the one that can bring unity in spite of your disagreements that's why it takes the Holy Spirit if you don't disagree and there's a Unity big deal we then enter when we gather together in unity we then enter into the presence of the Lord with that anointing of Brethren together in unity oil represents the Holy Spirit and there you have it friends the unity of the spirit is Brethren dwelling together in unity I just read you quot from theam you want some more no let me go on amen glory glory glory you are getting the drift right you may be seated amen but let me go on let me let me let you you I gave you enough quotes you can go s them some more yourself so what does this mean the unity of the spirit before the unity of the faith let's try and break it down it means before God can send the Holy Spirit the Dynamics like on the day of Pentecost when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in the unity of the spirit all in one mind and one Accord not The Bishop's mind not the bosses mind not the pastor mind not the deons mind the man of God the intelligence the Holy [Applause] Ghost the Ang of the spirit before the of the faith it means before God can send the Holy Spirit into our midst to anoint the word into flesh we must keep the Ang of the spirit and maintain the unity of the spirit in spite of differences you and your wife have differences right but you keep the home something like that somebody getting a revelation you and your wife have differences you don't say no I I separate I draw a circle I don't want anything to do my wife you still try to keep the unity in the home can somebody say Amen am can somebody say I can hear you can somebody say Amen am amen oh no we we this is what I believe I don't believe like them I don't want to do with them no you are missing the point a prophet has been in the land you may be seated you may be seated so keeping the unity of the spirit you may be see I want to hear this real good I want to hear this real good keeping the UN of the spirit what does it mean it mean means getting into one mind it means to keep an all these all these things are from the quotes I read to you I'm not making them up or my own deductions from the scriptures no from the quote I read to you keeping keeping the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace Paul Ephesians 4:3 Malachi 4 keeping of the spirit means get to one man and one Accord it means to keep an old fashioned prayer meeting constantly going on it means to keep looking up watching for the coming of the Lord it means to keep all wildness out of you amen like brother gon was talking to us yesterday it means to receive the circumcision of the Holy Ghost to keep worldliness lost filth out of your life young man young woman you will never overcome lost lust has been overcome already you don't have to struggle come to the Fountain he that is is that you thir let him come and drink of the Water of Life freely and he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost instantly the desire leaves you Satan will still tempt you but you are not struggling anymore the power of the Holy Ghost is overshadowing you and you are cutting all the worldliness off cutting fatal sin cutting off not by struggle by the power of the Holy Ghost don't struggle when you struggle you drown get the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is yet to get amen [Applause] amen keeping the unity of the spirit means receiving the setion of the Holy Ghost to keep worldliness lust filth out of your life so it's not an invitation to struggle like who said I just love my brother I just love that's lovey doy love everybody here love everybody here and love and sin is all over ravaging the lives of the people because I want to keep the unity of the spirit I just love I just love no it's not an invitation to struggle against sin rather keeping the of the spirit is an invitation to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that can circumcise your heart from every ungodliness every fi every debauchery clean you out amen keeping the unity of the spirit means a time for the power of the Holy Ghost from the prophet all these quotes I read it means a time for the power of the Holy Ghost into the church to heal the severe sickness in the body of Jesus Christ his church and what is this sickness he told you horrible sickness he said he severely sick what is his sickness divisions broken relationships a lack of love and unity in the church keeping keeping the unity of the spirit also means displaying wisdom and maturity to manage our disagreements in Doctrine as well as as as our disagreements in other areas of our various interactions if you and your wife do not manage your disagreements you will not have a marriage and don't tell me you don't have disagreement with your wife because you are telling a lie or with your husband but is managing those disagreements that's what keeps the home together so same way keep keep keep the home by managing those agreements the unity of the spirit keep these disagreements keep wisdom and maturity to manage these disagreements so we can keep the unity of the spirit [Applause] Hallelujah keeping the in of the spirit also means to learn if you don't have it to learn the wisdom and maturity that can display the the principle of agreeing to disagree Lord help me when you understand this then you'll understand what it means can two work together except they agree we always put that to everything else when want to do all these separations two can't work except they agree oil and water cannot mix and all that stuff but when it comes to you and your wife even though you disagree you find a way you are not oil and water is somebody hearing me is all foolishness utter [Music] foolishness this is the prophet but we have so many small prophets Among Us so many small prophets wisdom and maturity if you don't have it don't say I have it no you can get wisdom you can learn wisdom wisdom and maturity that you can display the principle what it means to agree to disagree when you understand this principle then you'll come to understand at a much deeper level The Wider implications of the scripture can two work together except they agree those in the world and even in many places in Christianity Today who get a divorce is because they never understood that you have to agree to disagree to keep the unity in your home is so say my way or the highway then they go to get a divorce or like maybe me they stay in the home together but there are two Nations living in the home because they don't understand that two can work together even with their disagreements just by simply understanding how to agree to disagree I am the head of this home what I do stays if you don't take is foolishness utter foolishness did your master do that with you husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church your husband came to you and said you must receive me as your lord and savior or else he didn't do that free moral agency to be or not to be he let you be let your wife be let your husband be let that Pastor be let that church be let that believer be they don't have to be like [Applause] you your wife don't have to be like you that's not what it means to be the head of the home is the unity of the spirit what does the spirit say I'm sure you get the drift amen amen keeping the unity of the spirit means Brethren dwelling together in unity right Unity of the spirit because they understand how to work together in disagreement just like a husband and wife by agreeing to this disagree if you don't understand that you will never come into Unity the unity of the spirit now let's bring all this together let's bring all this home you may be see it let's bring all this home as I'm trying to find a place to wind wind down I didn't say I'm finishing I'm trying to find a place to wind down okay now I've only spoken one hour I've only spoken one [Music] hour I I've only spoken one hour so you may be seated I want you to get this let's bring this home let's bring this home to you and I to each one of us to the smallest child in the room to the oldest person in the room in Genesis 2 God said it is not good for the man to be alone and let me put a caveat here because brother Gideon said said yesterday you got to walk with God alone and somebody said that's why I said don't hear what I'm not saying somebody say that brother U is saying something against whaton said no I'm saying the same thing exactly so listen at a deeper level to hear what I'm saying all right don't just grab the words that's like you become like chpt who just like a sarcastic Pirro just he just it doesn't have enough sense yet to think and reason the way in that in that scripture it is not good for the man to be alone lays the origin of all human associations marriage families friends towns cities countries the association together communities clubs societies unions in that verse it is not good for the man humankind to be alone but I will make him a wife for him no he didn't say that I will make him an help meat for him in the institution of marriage the help meat is the spouse the husband or the wife but these other institutions they are there to help you that's why if you're in a group you can say is this helping me or not it's not helping you know you are in a wrong Association get out of it because the very origin of associations in the Bible is to be a help to you a help that meets your needs so if you the boys and the girls in school and they make you do wrong things that don't help you get away from [Applause] [Music] there because God said it is not good for man to be alone it needs to interact men need to interact with other humans because in those interactions is heeding man's maturity and growth without those interactions man will not mature he will not grow as good as well as God determined that he could and should be is not Unity with yourself alone it's Unity of the spirit and that's why when you have children that that maybe there an only child a husband and wife have only one child those children be managed in a certain way or they will just come up with VI because they don't have other kids to learn from to interact with and those parents need to understand need to have this child or that child grows up feeling so entitled that child gets a feeling so spoed or that child just ends up not properly built up in their character because they didn't have other other other humans of their IL of their age of their Community to interrup with so without the interaction with other human beings you will not grow you not mature as God determined you should if you have an anger problem how you going to know it if you're just by yourself alone you're not going to know you get angry unnecessarily but when your wife talks to you and just get angry then the Holy Spirit tells you I don't want you to do that that's wrong and then you feel like that okay Lord I'm so sorry and what is it you just becoming a better person because you are getting United with the spirit what he wants if you all by yourself you'll be brutish raw evil you think you are the most perfect human being on the face of the Earth so other people around you expose you or inspire [Applause] you man it is not good for him to be alone because man needs other men around him so he can become his better and best self because reality is we learn to become human from one another we learn to become human beings from one another how many of you have learned something just from watching other people I'm talking about good things now you can learn negative things and many of those you will never learn if you are just in your own private corner alone because we learn to become human from one another only Adam learned to become human all alone by himself and that's why God saw that no man needs other people firstly I get Adam a wife to help him to be a better person that's what your wife is there for not like she's she's she's ah this woman is stressing my life this woman I made a mistake getting her coming keeping the unity of the faith and that's how you keep it amen amen can you say Amen GL we learn we learn to become human from one another I learn from you you learn from me because the same only Adam learned to become human all by himself but the rest of us we are who we are because of who we all are I am who I am because of who we all are because we learn from one another we help one another to grow that's how God determined it that's how God planned itall so you need people around you or you'll never come to the unity of the spirit you need husbands wives you need nice husbands nice wives you need not so nice husbands not so nice wives around you to help you become a better human being you need good people you need bad people around you too to help you become a better human being somebody so evil and nasty you just say uh-uh this is not the way to go that's not what we were taught in church no I won't be like that that person has added to your life because they are showing you how not to be how not to live can you say amen amen the pastor gave me permission to say these things amen you may be seated so you need people you need people who love you you need people who cannot stand you people who hate you let's put the word who hatte you you need them too you need people who see the good in all that you try to do you need you need people who don't see any good at all in you you need people who are easy to get along with with you need people who are difficult to get along [Applause] with and on and on and on and on but you get the drift can you say Amen do you get the drift say amen amen I'll have nothing to do with that person anymore great but let them help you be a better person if the person is so evil you saying so people can be so evil Lord Jesus please let your spirit help me to not descend to that law not because you condemning that person but you want to be a better person that's why when they brought that woman caught in the very Act of adul to Jesus God the god of love because he condone sin no he was love love corrects the sin love delivers love sets free love doesn't kill they got her what he said she've done to her the Lord heiller he said he that is without sin Let Him cast the frost Stone have you learned from This Woman's life so you not fall into the same thing again yourself so he began to write on the ground we don't know what he wrote but maybe was writing their sins maybe was writing some of them there who had gone to sleep with that woman forgive the expression some of these religious leaders who have slept with that woman because she won't talk because she was abused and you can't bring those things out easily he said right in the ground and they saw it they ran away and when they were all gone Jesus the father with his daughter alone his daughter who was messed up by sin and disease and de buty he'll knelt down by her side Jesus was having having a father daughter relationship with that woman he was having a father daughter moment he knelt down by her side and said daughter where are your accusers she said no man here Lord he said neither do I condemn you go and sin no more the love of God the love of God the love of God if it was you and I we would say woman last week I warned you two weeks ago I stood you up in church last year you did the same thing and we forgive you you know you know now that you are dead you were dead if not for my influence so make sure you don't leave this kind of a filthy evil ungodly life anymore but Jesus he never won minut mention her sin that's love did he correct her sin yes said go and sing No More what was the point of talking talking talking this woman herself had come to the conclusion that I was dead if not for this woman for this man here so saying sing and then we talk too much we are we are we ministers we rebuke we bless we are rebuke we are blessed in blasting and forgive me and many time when it comes to our own children our own homes we keep mom we keep s lips forgive me forgive me that's not how to come to of the [Applause] spirit a young man young woman in church make a mistake of fall I don't care what the sin the a pastor with a father Heart Like Jesus with that woman can kneel down by her daughter what went wrong recognizing realizing that your daughter your son might be in that same spot tomorrow oh Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I am who I am because of who we all are many young people have left church because of the way they were handled I'm friendly with many young people in this country many of them have told me we pastors have a rod of iron we don't stand for foolishness we don't stand for sin and we get get that rod and we slam and slam and slam that's not representative of God look at Jesus zakus came down he never for one say zakus you ex he never for one mentioned her sin the woman caught in adultery never for once mention a sin the woman at the well look at her I told her it didn't say you Harlot you have been living from Men to Men just said go and call your husband she was the one that said it herself [Applause] name who Jesus came across and he was shubing their sin in their face you won't find one the only people he hated were the Hypocrites and that's how many of us are especially many of us in Authority can you say amen I know I'm stepping on toes can you say Amen I'm speaking to myself too I'm also a pastor you may be [Applause] seated you are who you are because of who we all are we are all who we are because of who we all are I am who I am because of who we all are none of us is as good of all as all of us together under the unity of the spirit none of us is as smart as all of us together under the control of the Holy Spirit none of us there's no Superman Among Us only super person Among Us is the Lord Jesus Christ no Pastor no Deacon no Bishop no prophet and that's not what that's what brother bam taught us the super sign is the holy spirit God anointing your flesh making you God and man together we are all who we are because of who we all are we hold one another's hands up we help one another to be better when somebody is dying sincere you can help them to be better is the sick that needs a physician not the healthy if a young man is caught up in sin the place you come to is the house of God but we we weep them so much we drive them out and they go and become wor outside because of our great weep our righteous weep does it mean you not you don't rebuke sin no but love rebukes sin that's why I say speaking the truth in love you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free but you speak we quote that a lot but what is that you speak the truth in a way that he sets free like Jesus Jesus did to the woman go and see no more is like you know this is your life you don't go that way again go and See No More Les a worst thing comes upon you that's what was saying he was telling her the truth in a way that will set her free that's what I'm talking about wisdom maturity to keep the unity of the spirit [Applause] we hold one another's hands up we help one another to be better let me run we help one another to be human we help one another to become better human beings we learn together to be human none of us is a fully made artical that's why we're not adopted yet we hold one another accountable we don't spare sin we don't Speare wrong but we speak the truth in a way that sets free not the blasting and the disgracing and all that stuff what was it about Jesus that the man the demoniac of gadara a man who had Legions of demons what was it about Jesus that this man so full of devils maybe those kids are full of devils and they're coming to church that what was it about Jesus that that man the Bible said he ran to Jesus he had problems that were overwhelming him he was a demon he was backsliding he was evil but he say he ran to Jesus what was it about Jesus that that man knew he will not be cast out but he will be received with open arms with all his demons and when he came to Jesus Jesus spoke not to the man spoke to the Devils get out of him on the devil's [Applause] left we speak the truth in a way that sets free not speak the truth in a way that make people feel disgraced make people feel lesser than a human being thank you Lord zakus owe you you extortionate you zakus came down Jesus said zakus come down he wanted to have a private conversation with him Z come down for I must dwell in your house today and said me fil me in my house he said it himself Lord I'm a defraud I defra people such love in the presence of love it will cast out evil Spirits it will cast out evil it will cast out Devils sex Devils will fall off from their own mouth they'll confess not zakus you you have been taking all the tax money and all that Zak's bank account was filled with money he had got from people he said all I took money from I will repay four [Applause] times and Jesus said this day zakus salvation Deliverance has come to your house because there was a lord Jesus Christ there who knew how to speak the truth but in love he was the love of God all rich and pure how measureless how strong riching out to his children who are messed up who are bound in sin and sickness disease and all that and setting them free that same Jesus is here right now is here today oh let me turny wind on here let me turn close on here Oh Glory Oh Glory so it's not like we let people live lower than they should live no we don't spare one another we don't let anyone live a life lower than their optimal best that's why we're there for one another we speak the truth in love we speak the truth in a way that sets free that's how love does it we Mentor one another we help one another we lift one another up because again I say it is not good for man for the man to be alone and I am who I am because of who we all are so friends in coming to one man and one Accord we all we have all got to understand and realize this very important reality you may be see that as I'm really trying to find a place to close here we got understand this very important reality what is the reality in every relationship whether it's personal you and your wife you and your son you and your daughter every relationship whether it's personal whether it's individual whether it's a group relationship in church in at work wherever there are always divisive influences there are always Tendencies things that tend to divide us there are always disagreements that can scatter us apart always they will always be there but in the midst of these disagreements different opinions under those circumstances it'll be very easy to turn on one another and go a separate ways each one sticking to his guns each one is so convinced their way is right my way of the highway especially in the mar relationship with the men with Nigerians we Nigerians are like that I'm I'm a husband too I'm talking myself where the head of the home I don't we don't understand in this home here is that how Jesus handles you husbands love your wives as Christ love the church when you make a mistake it cast you out no if you really are walking with God like brother brother G today he'll speak to you he speaks to you and talks to you a long last narrow way he tell that son you can do better I'll help you next next time you felt that way because you did not depend on me you are trusting the arm of Flesh just stay close to me and I'll help you stay close to me like you had on Saturday afternoon and I'll help you he bangs your head and like you scream at the wife and maybe the wife screams at The Horseman or scream at the children or the scre scream at one another or the pastor screams at the church or the church screams at the pastor in every relationship spiritual natural there are always things that tend to divide us and we very easy under those circumstances to turn on one another but rather than allow these situations to divide and and separate us from one another we should use them rather to learn about one another instead am and the Christian Life and John is all about learning Jesus came with the message of redemption he said come andar learn of me he didn't say come and get rid of your sins no come and learn of me you learn about salvation learn about sanctification learn about the Bap learn learn learn because in learning is is hidden your growth into maturity if you don't learn you're not growing there are people who are aging and haven't learned a thing in the past 20 years they're just growing older in years but they're not growing in their wisdom and maturity there are those of us who say I never take back what I said on the pulpit that was God speaking to me oh yeah my time is gone so I don't I don't have time to give a personal testimony about brother Bram so rather than allow these situations to divide and separate us from one another learning us from each other we should use them to learn instead learn about con sitation for other people learn to understand where the other person is coming from why they hold strong to their views like that learn about their world view even though they be wrong learn about that people can be wrong like that so it just gives you more capacity to manage those who are wrong and sing to their wrong guns like that who knows Jesus might be sending them to you like the Demonic of gadara so you can cast the spirit out of them by speaking the truth in a way that sets free instead of letting those sitations divide and separate us seek to understand the other person you always say they don't understand me my husband doesn't understand me my wife doesn't understand me the pastor doesn't understand me I get it I get it but real wisdom and growth is not when people understand you when people seek to understand you they are the ones growing but when you seek to understand another why they so why they are so wound up like that and know said like that said like that a brother you mean him sometimes they said why do you go to these people who are so wound up like that he said brotherly kindness Faith virtue patience with him hoping someday virtue in yourself power in yourself to understand that he's living that way because it's in his heart like that who knows you might be able to set him free oh my I I got to run forgive me you get the drift I I know you got the drift so we seek to understand another why they are the way they are instead of letting this things separate us this is agreeing to disagree you learn about one another others likes and dislikes the needs and expectations you learn what your wife likes what she doesn't like why should she not like that she doesn't like it is that tough to understand it's not right for not to like it I get it but she doesn't like it because you have no power from God to control her to like what you like not even your little child not even your little child God didn't give her that kind of control the only thing that has control about is the Holy Spirit the three-fold mystery right God in control over Christ Christ in control over the bride the bride in control over the earth going down to Eden not over another human being and when you find out what their needs and their weaknesses are that's where your own growth is is hidden you seek to help them with these needs as much as you are able to that way our circumstances our divisions agreements instead of dividing elating us will rather unite us and bring us into one mind and one Accord in the bond of Peace many of us have one man and one Accord in the bond of hatred people people hate they obey young people in ch they obey but they hate the ground on which you are standing on even wives husbands the man is just a a what you call now Iron Fist in the home Iron Fist and when he comes everybody runs into their rooms everybody runs into their rooms that's a dysfunctional home everybody runs to their home because the lord of the mayor has come home the mayor has come to town forgive me Nigerians I mean where where where I'm talking to Home Folks forgive me you will love me after this I know I know you love me because we're talking angel of the [Applause] spirit I I'm not stepping on your toes am I brother is am I stepping on their toes all right Hallelujah Unity of the spirit in the bond of peace knowing the B of everybody keep to their corner but of peace peace peace like a river in the home all it doesn't mean you will not have disagreements it doesn't mean you have troubles in the church do that mean you have people who have bullheads in the church no but it don't handle a bullhead and then it becomes like an issue big issue that's affecting the whole church that's not wisdom that's not wisdom Jesus had a a devil among his disciples he managed him such a way when he told them when he told him like uh what th doest do quickly when he said one of you will betray me today they looked around they did not know who it was till when when when they said is it I is it is it I when Judas got up and went he said what that do do quickly they did not believe because that same man was Jesus's treasurer [Applause] Jesus managed that man whole P someday but he was a devil a child of predition so there was no change in him but Jesus gave him all the chance but just such a way he don't even know at all that Judas was that kind of a person Jesus helped the man to save face some of us preachers in Church parents are there with their children we are blasting the father blasting the mother blasting the father blessing the mother in the presence of their children we are belittling them in the presence of their children like your children like your children I'm not saying not the correct I'm not saying not the correct look through the salmon books they 1,000 Oro of them and brother bam did anything like that in the Tabernacle or anywhere on the street he he rebuked sin but he never got personal all of those things he did behind closed doors and then we wonder why some of these children leave church because they've seen their fathers and mothers who they idolize who they look up to they see them reduced by the authorities in the church and we present God the way he is not do you know why Moses did not go to the promised land Moses the man who was more Meek than all the men on the face of the Earth you know why he not go to the promised land because he showed God because he represented God to those people God said you will represent me and will be your mouthpiece and we on the pro represent God to the people and the young man without Revelation How We Do Is How They see the message how they see brother Bram how they see Jesus Christ don't hear what I'm not say not saying don't rebuke sin brother bam did plenty but he never got personal he never dehumanized he did it the way Jesus did for zakus the thief the robber so zakus come down Amos soop in your house today in other words that going to have a convention over dinner I want to talk to you privately do that stop disgracing parents the children and those children get beaten and [Applause] blue that was the time me let me say this let me see the many let me see let me tell you one there's this young man who took a phone call for his dad and while he was putting the phone down and for his dad to pick the call he took the call in another room to be sure his dad was on the phone and he saw the person on the other line busting his dad like that and he said after the call said Daddy is that how that person talks to you either I talk to you I don't I want none of this and he walked out walked out I don't want if that is Christianity don't want it Moses the great prophet Moses Meek More Meek than any man on the face of the of the Earth the one who God said I speak Moses from lip to air Moses showed God as angry when God wasn't angry that was it that was it Moses did not womanized he not commit adultery he not fornicate he did not worship idols no Moses was so close to God he told God God we can't do it that way remember your holy name and then God said Moses you are right I'll do the way you said and the people were were mad they wanted water they started curing God I told Moses it's not you they're talking to they're talking to me and God said they to him but Moses give them water take your rod and strike the rock once and Moes God's anger did not keep them from getting water Moos was still angry more Angry than God and he came on the pulpit and he got like you rebels calling the people names you rebels who did they rebel against he or God God they rebell against I said give them water you rebels must we we we pl God must we get you water from the rock bang bang he blasted he blasted he blasted and God said Moses you Dishonored me how many times do we dishonor god with anger and we're showing God as angry when he's not when the people sin they're not sin against you or me they're sin against the one that died for them and let's present it to them the wrong in the way that he will do the way he does when we sin and do wrong you don't have if you ever met the Christ of Calvary you won't do adultery fornication and all that but Sin is Sin he that's guilty he that's is that is that is that guilty of one is guilty of all don't say that one adultery committed me you are guilty as guilty as guilty Moses did not go in the promised land because of anger not that he want to be angry but he said be angry but sin not you know when you know when you when you you can get angry God was angry many times but when we are angry and sinning we say is my righteous anger no when your anger is such that the people what you remember more is your words of anger rather than the correction you are trying to bring forth you are sinning the voice of your emotions is draing out the correction Moses said must we get water from the rock bang bang what do you remember about that not so much the the water that came out of the rock but the fact that he BR the thing twice when Moses was angry and [Music] sinned is still got the miracle done like say yesterday p i mean ministers beat their wives and come the it and the anointing is falling Mo are the same thing he had seen that will came from the promised land yet he still had the Miracles he still had water come out of the rock I'm serious I I'll I'll I'll find a way to call off now and get out so when we leave this way trying to keep the unity of the spirit each one of us becomes more mature with every divisive influence that comes along when we step back and let the Holy Spirit speak to us how to handle the thing but many of us are quick on the trigger with fly off fly loose even those of us behind the pulpit maturity is character building maturity is growth building a character forming behavior in us and your behavior is what sets you up for adoption right your behavior while you are in the unity of the spirit keeping the in of the spirit is what sets you up for adoption God's watching until God can see Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience Spirit Inspire not natural virtues but Spirit proven Spirit grown Spirit driven faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance patience and godl and brotherly kindness God his wisdom with our growth into maturity inside those divisions these agreements in those home in the church don't waste the crisis don't waste the disagreement use it to grow you to help other people to grow too because friends we have to learn to live and work together we have to learn to get along as members of the same team which is the same body of Jesus Christ when you get together with other believers and other people that's where you get presented with opportunities to break down your own human spirit and align it with the spirit of Christ that's where you learn to put yourself in your brother's place on the matter that's where you learn to prefer one another in love that's where you learn what sacrifice is really all about that's where you learn to die out of yourself to self life your own interest your own things that's where you learn to deal with and manage difficult people people and difficult situations that's where you learn to grow and how you grow up into Christ in all things oh my [Applause] Hallelujah effective leadership in the chch in in the church should be about taking bring bringing the people to the unity of the spirit so that I can Pro the unity of the faith according to Ephesians 4 friends as I'm closing there's a pray of unity Among Us that's very serious very serious and it must be addressed and not just in Nigeria everywhere all over the world all over the world the people who brother Brown brought a message for that said the seven Thunders gathers the bright together have you really experienced that or he gathers us in our own little clicks together clicks and town unions in the messages in the message clicks and our own groups no before you say it's going to make me CH what I believe no I'm not saying that Unity of the spirit it's not about what you believe or you don't believe it's not Unity of your belief Unity of the spirit ready brother bham there's a problem of unity real problem of unity Among Us that's very serious and it must be addressed so that God can get the type of church he's looking for a church where you don't know your friends from your enemies as he was spoken of brother Branham like brother K I think was yesterday about the man who was trying to put a knife in brother bram's back and he I mean he was saying something about brother bam 1980 we I mean brother a and I had gone to the uh um the the um the spoken work publication at the time in Jeff and brother Roy borders was the editor of the spok books at the time and brother Ro Robertson was there too and brother Robertson was saying brother Bram and said brother Bram many times he goes to meeting and said God bless you what brother say yesterday people live witness said said will turn around he just said God Bless but I just saw his heart he wish he had a knife to put in my back and B will say he sees I say God bless you God bless you the ones who have a church where the difference between the Hales and they have not should not be noticed Among Us in any way like it was in the book of Acts I don't have time to get you but it's not he not talking about feeding lazy people no I'm not saying that but let me just leave and move on and just try to close out here the church in the book of Acts the Church of Ephesus was a church that lived this way in the unity of the spirit and they got this way because they lived in the spirit they know achieve this life in the spirit by sheer will power or In Their Own Strength no it was by the power of the Holy Spirit they recognize that the cruelty of sin tempts us to be self-reliant that's what the devil did to Eve to be self-reliant God doesn't care about you he's keeping something away from you you better take it into your hands and that's what we do sin makes us we trust in the arm of Flesh and the cruelity of sin temp to be self-reliant and RI on the arm of Flesh our own efforts rather than on God but the Holy Ghost so all I'm saying today is not an invitation to live in your arm of Flesh to to show like you can you can let me just love and all that stuff and when your something like you're I've been keeping quiet for you for too long now all that stuff this are an appeal to work in your flesh in an appeal on the last day of the F to come to the waters to come to the rivers to get the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is who we need to guide us to the unity of the spirit we each need his power to grow into the maturity of Grace to handle these situations in our everyday interactions so we can daily grow into him in All Things and to the unity of the spirit that's why God weaved in the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost into the process of coming into the unity of the faith he knows all of this we need to change we need to change our lives our ways and he knows we can do it in our own strength and that's why it we the baptism of the Holy Ghost Inside there for you and I this afternoon

Hallelujah GL hallelujah oh [Music] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord can we give the Lord a hand of praise [Music] amen you love the Lord this morning what can we say about the message what can we say about the Lord and how many appreciate our precious brother Olu what a word from the Lord addressing the body but addressing homes and families and situations and bringing a Unity of the spirit and helping us to navigate the issues of life there's so much that was said that gets you to reframe your thinking amen that God has set people in your life some that are good some that are bad some that will love you some that will hate you and it's all designed that given the the the foundation that is not good for you to be alone to bring on that character in you so it makes you relook at situations and relook at people that go God and his wisdom has sent our way because this pyramid and this life that is being formed into the word image has to be tested and tried for every one of these virtues to be displayed and even the virtue of our age being brotherly kindness you cannot be able you can't demonstrate that on your own unless you have somebody you have to forgive you can't demonstrate that virtue without situations coming and I've said it many times before that somebody who is very close some some somebody who's not close to you can't hurt you but it takes somebody who's close to you to create a situation that forces the level of forgiveness that could qualify because something that's easy is a easy thing to forgive a easy thing you know but somebody who's close to you who you didn't expect it from who did it in a certain way creates that situation for that character of Jesus to be there that love and it's not Jesus trying to be love God is love and he wants that same love to be moved moving through each one of us until we become reflections of his love can we give the Lord a hand of Praise this morning this is a message that's worth listening to again and again it's an anchor point it for your marriage it's for your family situation it's for church issues it's for it's leadership training it's spiritual maturity is preparing us to leave this place with a recognition that it's the grace of God Upon Our Lives and the same way Christ loved us is the way we have to love one another same way husband love your wife as Christ loved the church same way we live may the Lord richly bless you this morning and I pray that as we prepare to leave this house but not from his presence that these things will be on our hearts and our minds as we we work to be as brother U said better people we want to be better people the purpose of coming to church is to make us better people can the church say amen amen so for some notes of Praise this morning from Sister Juliet I'm thanking Lord for traveling Mercy this morning I was in a taxi seated at the back and as the taxi stopped for someone a van reverse and hid the back of the taxi it could have been worse so I give God all the praise so we thank God Amen it's all of these things it's the little things it's the big things God has a direct interest in every aspect of our lives and many times we don't even understand how God moves behind the scenes things we don't even see things we don't even understand God shift turn things around for your good he said I know the plans I have for you plans

also remember to keep in prayer there are different cases amongst us um brother kuu and so many other cases um that are looking for prayer looking for a touch from the Lord uh we want to remember each one and pray for one another even as we come close to leaving here and the word said I think but over read the scripture last week forsaking not the assembling of yourselves even as the day approaching in other words the closer we get to leaving this place is the more we should seek to come together to prepare to leave this place this world is on a on a Time clock that's counting down and time is running out we don't know how much more time is left we see the whole political movements the economic movements everything is just moving so quickly now and speeding up with everything so we want to just be ready we want to be mindful of the time and the season that we are living in and uh in this whole Christmas end of year and we know spiritually Jesus wasn't born on December the 25th but the world has hijacked what it represents with the birth of Christ and we celebrate his birth all year round every day because if he didn't come we wouldn't be here but in this season that we're in don't get caught up in the spirit of the world we want to be mindful of the purpose that he came and if he didn't come we wouldn't have a chance and I love how brother U spoke of that woman who was caught in the very act and how Jesus stood there and asked the question where are thine accusers and he can say neither do I condemn thee and that was Jesus on the earth in display showing the attributes that we ought to have for one another that if there was no and and friends let me just close with this there would be no need for blood if God didn't know we would have failures there'd be no need for Mercy if God didn't have to create a provision for you to be coming out of a situation that you're in so we thank God this morning for his blood we thank God for his grace we thank God for Mercy we thank God for the see a forgetfulness and it's really mindblowing when you look into the mind of Christ as but U said many of us we take up a challenge for God and God not even looking at it that way there's Moses angry and God is not that angry you know so we want to be very Mindful and very sensitive as we approach this season don't get caught up in the spirit of the Season don't get caught up in in all these and make sure that you don't lose your Christian testimony in this time uh so may the Lord richly bless you have a wonderful week in the presence of the Lord uh may the Lord richly bless you brother [Music] Anthony amen you love him today bless the name of the Lord well as the ushers come to dismiss you out amen Go Tell It on the M oh and over the hills and everywhere Go
