you seal may you heal and may deliver and may get honor and Glory onto your name for I ask in Jesus Christ's name amen okay we have two portion of scriptures today from s John chap 17 from Revelation 10 want to read from St John 17 from: 6 to: 11 we'll read from Revelation 10: 1-3 and from 8 to 11 reading from St John 17: 6 to1 ver I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou givest me out of of the world thine they were and thou givest them me and they have kept Thy word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou Hast given me are of thee for I have given given unto them The Words which thou givest me and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believe that thou did send me I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and thine at mine and I am glorified in them and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name Those whom thou has given me that they may be one as We Are One Revelation chap 10 verse 1-3 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar it and when he had cried seven tunders uttered their voices L chapter 8 108 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hands of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people and Nations and tongs and Kings may the Lord add a blessing to his word you may be seated and tonight I have a thought for this time of exaltation recognizing your position in the word am and acting upon it this is where the problem lies with Believers they're not acting upon the word because they don't recognize their position but I Brandon preach a message hearing recognizing and acting upon the word of God this morning the Holy Spirit admonish us to put away childish things because children cannot recognize their position in the word that the father want them to recognize God want his children to recognize who he see they are amen and act upon what he said that they are and it's time we become men and women Amen in this message because we can no longer be feeding babies with milk you have to take hard meat and hard corn you got to learn to handle the word of God that God has placed in you Jesus call his disciples they were fishermen they were ignorant they were unlearned and that was the type of people that God called and most of the time the people that God called are insufficient in themselves for the job that they are called for amen amen amen because God love to confront the strong with the weak Hallelujah God loves to take the best things to confound the mighty that is why he said he that exalted himself shall be a based and he that humbled himself themselves shall be exalted but B said God ways and attitude never change amen amen because he's God and he changeth not that's right but the devil like to beat us down in our mind and tell us we are not who we are we are not who God say we are and we look at our weaknesses we look at our failures we look at our shortcomings but we don't look to the God who spoke concering usall listen brother Bram as a young Minister didn't know who he was he was a Baptist Minister he had a gift to seeing vision and see it come to pass the ministers around him knows nothing about the supernatural they said that must be a devil try and get rid of it do let thing affect you he come to a place he having mind battles he's a tormented man that's right because the angel passing as a warwind and passing he decide to go once and for all in the forest and speak to the Lord not coming back said not coming back until he hear from God amen amen it was only on the 7th of May 1946 when the angel spoke to the prophet and tell him who he was his purpose on Earth and you have the gift of healing to take to the world you're going to pray for kings and potentates nothing will stand before his prayer not even cancer if you get the people to believe he will after a while disc earn the thoughts and the intents of the heart hallelujah hallelujah that is the word that was spoken to a man with a seventh grade education insignificant amen amen he said I cannot do it I have no education he said you is the man for the Hallelujah and you is the man for the job you is the woman for the job Hallelujah Glory listen Glory with that revelation of his position but bam confronted the enemy one time because you know why he was given the greatest the most powerful amen weapon that God put in the control of human beings pray Hallelujah so he went forth and a minister used to preach the message and he will come and pray for the sick and they'll be healed so with that as a child with a powerful weapon he had to be trained how to handle it amen so he was only looking for miracles the toughest hardest case so bra will spend half an hour to qu praying for one dumb person or a blind person until they get the sight until they speak because the angel tell him nothing will stand before his prayer amen but he had to be trained so the angel tell him you're looking for super doing it wrong just pray for the second and they'll be healed so he had tell people after pray going be heal different things so God have to train him how to handle this weapon amen and this gift he had to be tray now to become a man amen he was trained and he became the living Tabernacle of the Living God Dwelling Place Hallelujah listen he became the house that almighty God choose to dwell in in this 20th century and you got to become the same because the same yesterday today and forever the most high God doesn't dwell in temples make with amen amen hallelujah hallelujah he doesn't dwell in temples made with hands that's right but a body amen has thou prepared thee praise God praise God thank you Lord thank you Lord God dwell Amen in the body that's right of human beings because God created man in His image and in his likeness the prophet said we bypass our word bodies amen and came in flesh to be tested and tried but he also said we become the word as we receive the word and we must have the Living Word in us to have the Living God in us and we've been feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man all these years so the Living Word is in us so we have to start to act upon who God say we are amen hallelujah so listen glory the lord himself descended from Heaven according chapter 10 with a little book open where did the Lord went when he came down he put one foot upon the sea and one foot upon the Earth they cried a loud voice listen this seventh Revelation is so simple go the prophet say don't look for no Great Mighty thing yes because it is in Simplicity amen and in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said God do not give his mystery in full but after it's completed then he show what he did that we can look back and see what it's all about and look forward and see what it's all brought up to so if we look back and see what happened the prophet was standing on the Earth when the mighty angel came down and that angel came in the prophet so that angel which is Christ The Covenant angel with the open book that have our names was calling our names to receive our inheritance from the lamb Book of Life in the prophet what was happening the seven Thunders was uttering their voices because when God himself came down I want you to see the parallel on Mount Si there was Moses there and there was God in the mountain that's right but God was thundering that's right it had lightning it had voices that earthquake the place was shaking and rocking and the people fear they said do not let God speak lest we die and God to the people spoke rightly I will no longer speak to the people like that am I will send them prophets I will send them a still Small Voice amen but it going to be thunder it going to be lightning but it Veil yes as a still Small Voice that's it that's it so what God did Hallelujah to the seven Church ages he had seven voices seven Messengers amen seven manifestations of his one Holy Spirit it was the voice of God in each age through the messenger for the age calling the names for the age to receive their inheritance so it was seven thundering voices that was thundering through the seven Church ages but it was sealed Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus told his disciples he alone had the father's seal and the Seven Seals in revealing Christ in his Sevenfold personage the prophet say Jesus Christ in Bride form among the Gentiles that what the Myster of the Thunders [Music] was but it was sealed through the seven Church ages through the Seven Seals am promised revealed in the last day by the seventh angel messenger so brother Bram tied up all the locen what they miss back there to The Seven Ages when any was TI up it was time now for the seven angels to come amen so it was six ages and here the seventh age which the prophet the seventh angel and his Angel is Christ because every age had an angel anointed the messenger so when the prophet was open the servant he said each night an angel came to him and reveal what was under the seal because that was the manifestation of the angel that operated in that age but God hid this whole Revelation because if it was revealed the devil could have great done great damage all he had to do was to kill the prophet and God had nobody to speak true he had no Tabernacle to dwell in there was no place for the seventh angel which is Christ to come down in with the book If this m was unfold so it could notf amen listen brother sorry as a man and as all right the pastor of the Bram Tabernacle amen wanted his church to see this mystery amen so here he tell them he said I've been spending each night just on the seven seal so I want you on the thir SE night to write out questions pertaining specifically to the Seven Seals because he won't let me answer any question wrong amen come on this was the prophet method all right of trying to get the Bram Tabernacle to see the mystery that was being unfolded before their presence so he telling himself that they will ask pertinent questions that the angel in him will answer because he won't let me answer no question wrong amen but God cannot let the mystery out amen so what happened nobody ask no pertinent questions amen hallelujah hallelujah there about four or five question about whether is 7,000 or 700 I make a mistake they ask question about the serpent they ask all kind of questions and they didn't ask no real questions about the seven SE what was taking place amen amen but one guy make a statement and he said brother Branham if in a question he say if every night an angel come to you therefore by Sunday Jesus going to be here amen but said no he had to hide that because they expecting Jesus in corpor but but Jesus was there this Sunday because the S AG was Christ that's it so the guy pick up what was happening and he spoke it but God had to just cover it over and Veil it he said no don't think so have to talk cover for not to see it but when the Sunday came and he was answering the question they asked a question pertaining to Revelation CH 5 amen that they sang a new song and the person asked them are those the rapt Saints or the redeemed Saints was hting he said no this new and he just went on but then the angel in him he said something wrong that is Christ because he answer the question wrong God is vindicating what the prophet say he would not let them answer no question wrong because it's Christ the word is in the prophet you understand he said something wrong amen he said someone said read over the question and read it over when he said oh my look at here he said they sang a new song thou has redeemed us he said these are the redeemed he said look at that he would not let me answer it wrong I felt like was robbing taking a child toy or something he was so convicted because the angel which is Christ that was in the prophet did not let the prophet answer the question wrong because this is God the Worden now here what happened brother Bram reveal all the Mysteries which is really Christ in the prophet doing that while he was alive and God took the prophet home but R 10 said go to the angel and take the book and eat the book that is for every bride member to do if youve been to the angel amen and take the book Hallelujah then the Living Word is in you Hallelujah right now I am speaking to you from rev 10 8 to1 81 amen right now present tense I am speaking to you from under the seventh seal amen Revelation 10 8 to1 because from 1 to 7 has already been fulfilled Revelation 11 which is to come is Israel Moses and Elijah and they cannot come until we get out of here so we have to recognize who we are and who we are because we are called to prophesy again we got to prophesy the same thing where prophesy we cannot prophesy nothing else because the word say the spirit the bride and the prophet going to be saying the same thing which has already been said in the word so the voice of the Archangel got to mount the word in the bride to write her down to the resurrection am the prophet said the world going hear directly from God we must become the final voice to the final Age The Bride is the final voice to the final age that's why you got to recognize who you are and whose you are listen Gideon so himself he so himself his family is the poorest family in manace and he is the least in his father's house that is how low his self-esteem was you know the word saw him a mighty man of Valor Hallelujah you're going to destroy the milites as one man Hallelujah that is how God saw Gideon and Gideon seem himself the least in his father's house how you see yourself how you see yourself when the words of this bride going to be at Invincible Army as she near the great headstone hallah he said missing limb shall be restored not even death could stop this bride how you see [Applause] yourself hallelujah how you see yourself according to the word hallelujah [Applause] the Bride of our ministry to the Eternal loss and to our loved ones amen and to the Lord Sheep amen glory you with your weak condition you with all your condition that you look at and see so terrible is you God call when Jesus was speaking to God he said father I have manifested thy name to the men that you give me and he said no man can come unless the father call him so how you here [Applause] today so much millions in the world today cannot take this cannot hear this because they are not of the father all the father had given Christ going to come and no man could come unless the father call him so you got to recognize who you are and start to act upon what God said you are Shake [Applause] Yourself Hallelujah listen to [Applause] me about a couple weeks ago I was in Mexico amen amen amen and while I was there I was observing the poverty of the people and seeing that there was nobody Ling on the streets you not see no young man no Corner Ling like we have around here in Trinidad everybody's hustling to live and to survive on the subway the poor people you can get to buy from a TR gum to a plaster for your finger they selling everything mve from Carriage to Carriage from the time train stop in a station you see a new group comedy car Carriage they hustling you're traveling a bus for a long the B stop stop two coming guit they start to play the guitar and sing about 2 miles and the pass they collect the pesos and I am observing these people and seeing how they hustling a lady came with a daughter and she a c and I think to Blue and they singing when he came and she's singing for a child that is sick and and collecting money everybody making a living hustling and I really enjoyed myself in Mexico God bless me in Mexico I came back here on Friday 23rd my son called me on the phone he said Daddy one of the most powerful hurricane is heading to devastate Mexico I said what so I went on the computer went in the Weather Channel I want I look the whole hurricane feature fli up the whole screen on the computer I little eye like that and something came over me I saw like a devastating devil coming to destroy this place this never happened to me before since and I got in a challenging spirit and started to pray and I said Lord have mercy upon these poor people in Mexico you are God you can Cal this St the mileage was 200 M hour the hurricane was raging Obama say America is standing by to help them everybody on stand by and in that child I got in the spirit praying I said Lord they forecasted a terrible blizzard to come through Colorado but your Prophet was in Colorado hunting and tell him go back in the storm and he spoke to the storm and disappear said Lord your mercy and Grace could drop that speed of that storm and calm the storm I say you could calm the storm when I get out of the prayer concerning that hurricane I felt relief and I felt an assurance in my heart that God has intervened for the people in Mexico with that storm am so when I heard the news I like to praise could and thank him for what he did the hurricane bypassed the two major cities that each one of 200,000 people and went up in the hills they said I think so far it's been about six deaths amen it wasn't as devastating as it was and I am seeing Sons and Daughters of God wherever they are when the anointing comes upon you because you can't do it in yourself but God is your father and he said ask the father anything anything anything in my name and that will I do but the prophecy must be in the will of God it must be in the will of God to ask that's right and see it come to pass and some of us not handling the weapon God give us which is prayer we are not fellowshipping with God to be in a communion to have chel of prayer and see things happen we have to speak positive and look to see positive things [Music] happen Sunday go on we all know that brother Anto and his wife be celebrating 50 years 50 wedding anniversary next year the devil don't like that the devil don't like to hear a man and a woman married for 50 years and all his well and things going nice what he tried to do triy to kill sister andne he tried to wipe out he g a stroke and a chest infection the doctors F the stroke and didn't really pay much attention to the infection chest and she was a well terrible way but God intervene because the prayer of the [Applause] Saints and God raise up but his three months standpoint after work and she have to walk and dance with her husband for the anniversary so Sunday gone I told her daughter I said when you go home tell your mother I am coming to visit her and when I'm coming I she must be up and walking then I told her husband brother an I said when you go home tell your wife I am coming to visit her when I come I want to see her walking amen amen then I tell him don't let her know I'm coming tomorrow Hall so Monday evening I went to visit Sister Anne with brother Clarance and there she is in the wheelchair so I told her I said Sister Anne I sent you a message that I want to see you walking when I come she watch my face she say I'm going to walk [Applause] tomorrow listen it is positive seeds I'm sewing to get positive results Jesus is the high priest of our confession we got to confess it with our mouth and then see our body obey our confession because the high priest is making intercession on the basis of our [Applause] confession so she spoke it with her Mouth She's going to walk tomorrow Tuesday I went Marvel I asked brother Anne how is your wife he told me she got up and make some steps she got out of the wheelchair and she make some steps amen so you continue to pray for S an twine because we're going to see her dancing with her husband for their 50th wedding anniversary celebration that is where your faith have to be in the god that we serve the devil is a liar you have to exercise what God Said by his Tripes we will heal it's already done we anointing the finished work God promised the Holy Ghost he promised the outpouring of the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon planted word upon the planted word of the son of man that is plant in your heart God promises send fire upon that you got to anoint that you got to plead the promises the prophet said if the ministers will forget the differences and will plead the promises it will become effective to the people when you pray Hallelujah you got to pray and remind God hallelujah what he promised to the prophet stop telling God you know what I'm going through and you know this and you know that and help me here and help me here God know that he don't hear [Applause] that he is omnicient why you telling God father know what I'm going through here he is omn he know that I was telling a brother it is like this when you're pray them can I pray here what you're doing your father promised you a million dollars but you have a old car you like your old car your old car giv trouble so your carburetor start to get trouble you want a $600 for a new carburetor your father a million you know but they go daddy the car in trouble I want J say look son take it and the father but what is WR my child he a telling me he promise I promise him if he get ready bu new car problem solve so when you telling God you know what going through you know tell God you want the baptism of the Holy Ghost and your problem solve listen the prophet say not him that knock it's him that knock it the daughters open him that seet is that he said consider the unjust church and the wiow woman problem is that you need what your father promised you you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire to run the devil out of your life and out of your home you need what God promised the Holy Ghost is the promise this is our promise Hallelujah the person of Christ the person of Christ to manifest his word in US amen amen amen that's it s praise God Jesus speaking to God hallelujah his father praise God in front of all his disciples he's telling God all these men around here they are not of the world as I am not of the world but they are in the world am so keep them he said I pray not for the world but for those that thou has G me out of the world you are not of the world but you are in the world and Jesus already pray for you so you got to recognize you are in the world but you are not off the world because he was chosen before the foundation of the world Hall friends if you recognize who you are amen the devil running from you know every time you see he taking off because his fire it's fire and listen all nature is groaning travailing waiting for you to be manifested listen when brother B was here he identify what the devil doing to take where the buy from people and pray from the schools and the churches I read lat what happened to a guy in America he's the coach of a football team he said since 2008 he been praying at the end of every game with his students but they say you cannot no longer pray in the public he said his prayer is a private prayer he not asking the children to pray with him but the children bowing the heads and some of them saying amen and some of them joining in so in September they tell him stop it completely so he stop it for a little while and a homecoming game at the end he went and pray so they suspend him they tell him he will not allow to assist to be coaching the team again he un full pay suspension until he agree that he won't pray on the field and they want to arrange that he get some small room in some corner he could go by himself and pray in some Corner away from everybody else because praying is no longer permitted let me tell you something in Babylon there was a son named Daniel he knew who he was and these guys wanted to get in they went to the king and said King he this make a decree that nobody could pray in 40 days amen don't let nobody pray unless they get permission from the king in 40 days you think that affect Daniel Daniel open the window look to the East and pray as normal them guys this guy he don't care about the king he have a he's serving a greater King than that Nebuchadnezzar you know he know who he is he's acting upon the word he's looking to the Holy Temple that Solomon dedicated and God say yes I look to the E Temp and pray he from heav he couldn't care about them who don't to pray so if them tell you would not pray you wouldn't pray you're mad so what they did they say brother you in trouble they tell the king listen King you see that guy Daniel he care you know and you have to fulfill your word say l then F liance then what is Alliance then a Son of God had liance know Adam used to speak to the Li and be amen amen butam spoke to the bull and the bull obey him that's right he spoke to the bees that's how Sons us operate so you know who you are and who you are you're not afraid of the king commandment this is what I want you to understand who you are you belong to God so you got to talk to your father and apply the word that he place in your heart in any condition and situation amen Hallelujah you understand so the D Hallelujah D like a baby you know whole night he had no mind [Applause] B some of us ask get some threatening thing oh God boy mind battles mind battles Daniel slept the whole night like a baby amen yes when he came come in the morning he said Daniel he called Daniel because he know that serving God so you know them Li can touch Daniel you understand so the other guys get the family the eaten by the same lions that he wanted in Daniel you have to recognize who God say you are now are we the sons of God and a son is an attribute of his father to let us conduct ourselves as the king son as we look to close off this exhortation let me just close off in this one little thing to you brother bam told a story about no before I let me just say this and pray this not come back to me look at the difference in America no prayer no Bible the president of Zambia call for the whole nation to pray to God to help them because Zambia has gotten in a financial situation the money has dropped them I 40 something per because the price of copper has gone through the window so they going through great economical strain yes the president said no bass must open before 6:00 and he call for the whole nation to pray to God to help them here what he says he says because God own all the gold all the silver is his and he said if his people that are called by his name will humble himself and pray amen then they will hear from Heaven here is a man as a president of a Nation yes going through financial difficulties recognizing that there is a God above that is in charge of all things he said God will help us and he put the nation to pray and here is a nation that God came down Veil themselves in flesh walk all over America heal the sick raise the dead open the blind eyes and they say boots we don't want you out of here and they throw God out of America they say we come Sodom man can Mar man woman can Mar woman the same Nation therefore the Judgment lith at the door that's right think of it sin and Nation brother bam says if God spare America because he didn't spare Israel his own people he sent Nebuchadnezzar to destroy them he said God America to raise up Sodom and repent to Sodom for destroying them amen and you see what going on with Putin and Russia I read where they say in a place in called that 435 earthquake within 4 weeks time the record never happen the fall just letting go gas and some scientists with the latest technology came up and make a thing that they said the the um probability of a large earthquake over5 hitting California is 99.9% within the next 3 years other SST say no they shouldn't say that it's in the next it's 85% but they can't put a Time Factor it is later than we think nothing could happen until we get in our position and God want us to put away the childish things and act upon who we say we are and conduct ourselves as the king son amen so in closing the prophet identified the African slave that was on the plantation and this Brooker came to buy him when the Brooker saw the slave he said I'll buy that one and the owner say he is not for sale he said why do you feed him different he said no he eat the same food like everybody else he said I always wonder what makes the difference to that guy and I found out way back in Africa his father is the king of the tribe and he knowing he's a prince conduct himself as one do you know who your father is your father is God and you are Son of God so you got to conduct yourself as one may God bless youon [Applause] come oh hallelujah hallelujah bless be your name oh H how many you appreciate brother

that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as he drink it in remembrance of me for as often as eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the blood of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world Amen praise God let's just bow our heads and close our eyes hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus
