[0:00] us have spoken about this both within
[0:02] the old testament and the new
[0:04] and it would be remiss of us in such a
[0:06] time as this to be ignorant
[0:08] of what's happening and for us to have
[0:10] the opportunity to put things in place
[0:13] so that we can be stronger christians
[0:15] our confidence and our courage
[0:18] should be based on the fact that we have
[0:19] an understanding that he who started to
[0:22] work in us is
[0:23] more than able to complete it and the
[0:25] seed of the word that's planted in our
[0:27] souls
[0:28] itself has its has the power to
[0:30] reproduce itself so we have to
[0:33] trust um in our destiny in our
[0:36] destination
[0:37] and trust um in who has brought us
[0:40] and carried us through um i don't know
[0:43] how it's been with you from a spiritual
[0:45] perspective i trust
[0:46] that um not only are you enjoying
[0:50] the different services and that you are
[0:51] participating and different studies and
[0:53] stuff like that but beyond that
[0:55] you're also taking your own time to
[0:56] commune with god and commune with the
[0:58] wood
[0:58] in your secret closet and taking that
[1:00] time to slow down
[1:02] you know sometimes the peace of life
[1:04] could be so fast
[1:06] so then when you're stuck in traffic i
[1:07] don't know if you haven't had this
[1:08] experience you're
[1:09] stuck in traffic something happens on
[1:11] the highway and for some reason you
[1:12] can't move and then you notice things
[1:15] on the street that you know you have
[1:17] never noticed before you're passing that
[1:18] road every single day
[1:20] and it's only because you're at a halt
[1:23] you said i recognize the tree
[1:24] the sign the building the color somebody
[1:27] painted the house you didn't realize you
[1:28] was paying because you
[1:30] you become used to just flying past it
[1:32] on the way to
[1:33] wherever you you know were planning to
[1:36] go but because your life
[1:37] gets stopped you get to slow down to
[1:39] reflect a thing to meditate to ponder
[1:42] to discover to explore to analyze to
[1:45] critique
[1:46] to look into the world to look at your
[1:47] life plan to see
[1:49] where you are at um what have you
[1:51] achieved
[1:52] not just any spiritual but even in a
[1:54] natural you know many times we look
[1:57] at things and and as a church and
[1:59] brother ryan was very clear
[2:01] um when he in many different places he
[2:04] referenced the theme that god is
[2:05] interested in every aspect of your life
[2:08] um if he was not interested in every
[2:10] aspect he would not have provided
[2:12] gold and a fish so that the disciples
[2:14] could pay their taxes
[2:16] and that was not a spiritual situation
[2:18] it was a financial one it was one that
[2:20] was
[2:21] meeting the need of the law of ilan as
[2:23] it were and god
[2:24] had a direct interest in ensuring that
[2:27] they could render unto caesar what is
[2:28] caesar he was
[2:29] had a direct interest you know when he
[2:31] was preaching to them and they were
[2:32] hungry
[2:33] that they could take five loaves and two
[2:35] fishes and they could be fed because he
[2:36] was not just interested in their
[2:38] in their spiritual sustenance but that
[2:40] they had food and
[2:41] and they were able to grow and they were
[2:43] able to take care of their bills and
[2:44] meet their needs and all these things
[2:46] and there is also now with this
[2:50] uh no excuse because god gives us the
[2:52] ability to do certain things and
[2:55] we have to be very careful that we don't
[2:57] waste the time
[2:58] that is given to us you know and um
[3:01] but over many times you would have heard
[3:03] but over preach that luck is when
[3:05] opportunity meets preparation and as you
[3:07] look at what is happening
[3:09] on a global scale i i don't know if i
[3:11] said it in this in this room i told
[3:12] somebody recently
[3:13] i am zoomed out last week friday i had
[3:15] eight zoo meetings back to work
[3:17] i was trying to figure out if i was
[3:18] living in zuma outside of zoom so i'm
[3:20] not sure if it was in this room or
[3:21] another room
[3:22] where i was making reference to the fact
[3:25] that zoom this same technology we are
[3:27] using right now
[3:28] the value of this company called zoom is
[3:31] now worth
[3:32] more than the world seven or the us
[3:35] seven largest airlines combined i want
[3:36] you to
[3:37] process that for a second so when you
[3:39] add up american airlines to
[3:41] delta airlines so to these top seven
[3:44] airlines add them all together
[3:46] zoom this technology that we're using
[3:48] right now
[3:49] is worth more than all seven put
[3:52] together
[3:53] and it is it is not that it was zoom's
[3:55] plan to be in that place
[3:57] it is simply that the situation changed
[4:01] the opportunity presented itself and
[4:03] zoom was ready
[4:04] and just as in the natural preparation
[4:08] can meet opportunity is the same way in
[4:10] the spiritual
[4:12] what we are doing is preparation to meet
[4:14] the opportunity
[4:15] and the opportunity for us presents
[4:17] itself in the form of an open door the
[4:20] opportunity presents itself for us as a
[4:22] space of grace
[4:24] the opportunity presents itself to us as
[4:26] another chance
[4:27] the opportunity presents to us as
[4:30] another day
[4:31] the opportunity presents to us as as god
[4:34] giving us a a a space of grace as it
[4:37] will
[4:38] to do what may not have been done before
[4:41] and the reality
[4:42] is as as as those who may be more
[4:45] digitally inclined than others
[4:47] would see that because of what zoom was
[4:49] able to accomplish
[4:50] facebook was scrambling to to do
[4:52] something similar google scrambling but
[4:54] it was already too late
[4:56] zoom's position has been established
[4:58] until
[4:59] it is the next pandemic or the next
[5:01] economic situation or whatever it is to
[5:03] change the way business would
[5:04] would exist zoom's place has been
[5:06] solidified because opportunity
[5:08] met preparation and i want to encourage
[5:11] us in this
[5:12] to see the opportunities because we have
[5:14] been preparing the preparation has not
[5:16] been
[5:16] now in the zoom all these years we have
[5:19] been coming to church
[5:20] has been preparation all of the books
[5:22] these scriptures your life
[5:24] experiences have been preparing us
[5:27] and the reality is our preparation
[5:29] should show it should show in how we
[5:31] speak
[5:32] our preparation to chew and how we act
[5:34] our preparation should show and how we
[5:36] live
[5:36] how we deal with situations situations
[5:38] that should
[5:39] have bothered us before or may have
[5:41] bothered us before
[5:43] just don't bother us as much not that we
[5:45] don't care
[5:46] not that it doesn't bother us but the
[5:49] way we deal with it has changed
[5:52] we learn to value more important things
[5:55] we learn to cherish
[5:56] more important things things that we may
[5:58] take for granted
[5:59] we realize that we can't take these
[6:01] things for granted anymore
[6:03] so this is my way of introduction by way
[6:06] of encouragement to us as a church as
[6:09] a group of believers and understanding
[6:11] that
[6:12] um you know peter said it that god has
[6:14] given us
[6:15] all things that pertain both to life and
[6:18] to godliness
[6:19] and many people miss this because you
[6:22] could end up so
[6:23] super spiritual that you missed the part
[6:24] about life and this issue of
[6:27] life and i remember years ago i spoke a
[6:30] message
[6:31] to the young people in particular and i
[6:33] may have referenced it on sunday
[6:34] about between sundays and i was making
[6:37] that that distinction that
[6:39] that that sunday is like a major mark in
[6:42] our lives because it's that day
[6:44] when we carve out time as it were to
[6:47] to recalibrate and to spend time with
[6:49] god and to look at the world and see
[6:51] what to do next
[6:52] and and and there is this between
[6:54] sundays that exist on a monday on a
[6:56] tuesday and a wednesday and a thursday
[6:58] on a friday on a saturday when the
[7:00] issues of life as it were
[7:02] would increase and the battle would
[7:03] become more fierce and the intensity and
[7:05] the
[7:05] temptation and the struggles sometimes
[7:08] can feel as if they are too much to bear
[7:10] but within that period we understand
[7:12] that he gives grace to us
[7:14] to be able to weather it so i want to do
[7:17] a little bible study
[7:18] for a few minutes um and you know then
[7:22] we could get into prayer
[7:23] and the theme would be leading to
[7:26] a figure that we know in scripture that
[7:28] that that's that's prayer but i want to
[7:29] kind of look
[7:30] into his background i i shared a
[7:32] scripture you know somebody shared it
[7:34] with me and and and
[7:35] and i did some more study and i started
[7:37] to it that'll blew my mind
[7:39] um and i i said in a meeting yesterday
[7:41] you cannot exhaust the bible it kind of
[7:43] exhausts you would
[7:44] the more you look at it is the more you
[7:47] discover new things
[7:48] so um i know everyone would know
[7:51] the story of daniel um or at least about
[7:55] daniel
[7:56] i don't know who has done an in-depth
[7:57] study of daniel
[7:59] um but there's so much in there i want
[8:02] to pull some things
[8:03] out of there tonight for us before we
[8:06] get into prayer tonight
[8:07] and uh i want to call it a study of
[8:09] daniel part one
[8:11] because it is impossible to even touch
[8:14] scratchy surface in in a month on how
[8:17] much stuff is in there
[8:19] so ride with me tonight before we get
[8:20] into prayer and we all know
[8:24] uh the story of daniel and alliance then
[8:26] and all that so i want to kind of build
[8:28] up to that a bit and pass through a few
[8:29] things and really
[8:30] pause as i give the example of driving
[8:33] down the road and you end up at a hall
[8:34] so you get to look at it a little closer
[8:36] so danielle's story
[8:38] is a story of an exile
[8:41] he is an unwilling immigrant
[8:44] i'll i'll get to reading some scriptures
[8:46] in a bit and and in fact before i get
[8:47] into let's just borrow heads one more
[8:49] time
[8:50] heavenly father as we approach this
[8:52] sunday school tonight
[8:54] with your church lord as we look through
[8:57] the scriptures and through your
[8:58] prophet's message and we
[9:00] have a little talk tonight oh family
[9:03] alter family conversation
[9:05] lord with those that are near and dear
[9:07] to us who
[9:08] lord we are united not in one physical
[9:11] place but we are united where it matters
[9:13] most we are united in spirit and heart
[9:15] and faith and focus
[9:17] lord in our desire to be changed should
[9:19] be different to be transformed to make
[9:21] the rapture
[9:22] to lay aside every weight that so easily
[9:24] beset us and we are
[9:25] needy people we are needy for food for
[9:28] our souls we are needy for
[9:30] are touching our bodies we are needy for
[9:32] strength to
[9:33] continue to press this journey this
[9:35] battle that you dropped us into
[9:38] we didn't take the battle but the battle
[9:39] was here before we got here
[9:41] but we accept the challenge we accept
[9:44] the the
[9:44] the obstacles and the situations knowing
[9:47] that you will never give us more than we
[9:49] can bear so
[9:50] may you bless our effort tonight may you
[9:52] bless the
[9:53] this gathering the lord the opening of
[9:56] the word to us that you reveal through
[9:58] your prophet and
[9:59] lord our time of prayer as we draw nigh
[10:02] unto you and you draw an eye unto us we
[10:04] commit it
[10:04] into your hands in the precious name of
[10:06] jesus christ amen amen
[10:08] so daniel's story is a story of an exile
[10:12] um we find in the book of daniel is not
[10:14] that daniel intended to be where he was
[10:17] um but he basically was moved forcibly
[10:20] moved
[10:21] from his homeland of israel across
[10:23] almost 1 000 miles
[10:26] of desert more than likely
[10:30] the way things were at that time he may
[10:32] have been roped
[10:33] or chained to several other of his
[10:36] kinsmen
[10:37] israelis possibly after witnessing the
[10:40] death of his parents or relatives or
[10:42] family
[10:43] as a result of the babylonian invasion
[10:47] that conquered the nation of judah in
[10:50] around 605
[10:51] 606 bc um we know that
[10:55] daniel is a book of prophecy it's a book
[10:57] of kings it's a book of kingdoms
[11:00] it's a book of powers it's a book that
[11:02] demonstrates god's power
[11:04] in world history there's so much in
[11:07] daniel that we speak and reference and
[11:09] it's really
[11:10] amazing how much is in the book of
[11:11] daniel
[11:13] the book speaks of kings that would
[11:15] reign in the time of daniel it doesn't
[11:17] stop there
[11:18] because daniel will interpret the dream
[11:20] that speaks of the kingdoms to come
[11:22] so it deals with the kings that will
[11:24] reign even up to the end time
[11:26] and it is in effect almost the parallel
[11:30] of the book of
[11:30] revelation so it is what the book of
[11:33] revelation is to the new testament the
[11:35] book of daniel would
[11:36] almost represented the old testament so
[11:38] it deals with issues
[11:40] that was specific to daniel's day and it
[11:43] would deal right down to the second
[11:45] coming of christ
[11:47] and it's a book of a young man it starts
[11:49] off as a young man
[11:50] who would purpose in his heart to live
[11:53] for god
[11:54] and the bible says in daniel 1 if you
[11:57] have your bibles and we're going to read
[11:58] a few
[11:59] verses there in the third year of the
[12:02] reign of
[12:03] jehovah kim king of judah came
[12:06] nebuchadnezzar king of babylon
[12:08] unto jerusalem and besieged it
[12:12] and the lord gave joachim king of judah
[12:15] into his hand so the lord allowed it to
[12:17] happen
[12:18] with part of the vessels of the house of
[12:20] god which he carried into the land of
[12:23] china to the house of his god
[12:25] and he brought the vessels into the
[12:27] treasure house of his god
[12:29] and the king spake unto
[12:33] ashbanez the master of his eunuchs
[12:38] that he should bring certain of the
[12:41] children of
[12:41] israel and of the king's seed
[12:44] and of the princes so
[12:48] this heathen king
[12:52] nebuchadnezzar is trying to find
[12:57] i guess people who could be in his court
[13:03] people who could add value to his
[13:05] kingdom
[13:06] people who could contribute something to
[13:08] his kingdom
[13:09] and he goes into a description of what
[13:12] he's looking for
[13:13] and it's really mind-blowing because we
[13:14] hear about danielle but for daniel to
[13:17] have even been recognized or the story
[13:20] of daniel and the hebrew boys
[13:22] this is the origin of it so the king
[13:25] course is the head of his eunuchs now
[13:27] if we understand scripture and the role
[13:30] of kings the kings would have these
[13:31] eunuchs
[13:32] you had to meet certain qualifications
[13:35] to even be allowed in the presence of
[13:36] the king and the queen and
[13:38] and and all these things and look at the
[13:41] description
[13:42] he instructed him to find children in
[13:45] whom was no blemish
[13:48] but well favored when you hear well
[13:51] favored
[13:52] it means that you could get along with
[13:54] people people favor you
[13:56] you know there are people that don't
[13:57] like the company you don't like to spend
[13:58] with them i heard somebody say some time
[14:00] ago
[14:01] everybody lights up a room some people
[14:03] lighted the room when they walk into the
[14:04] room
[14:05] some people light up the room and they
[14:06] walk out the room
[14:09] which one are you is it when you walk in
[14:11] your room the room light up
[14:12] or when you walk out your room your room
[14:14] light lighter
[14:15] but the king was very careful because
[14:17] you don't want any and anybody in his
[14:19] court
[14:19] so he said i want people with no blemish
[14:22] so it basically saying they must be
[14:24] looking good
[14:25] but well favored do they can get along
[14:27] with people
[14:28] and skillful in all wisdom now that's
[14:31] deep
[14:32] many times i've spoken through scripture
[14:34] and i say all is a powerful word
[14:36] all means all aldo means some so
[14:39] skillful in all wisdom and cunning in
[14:42] knowledge
[14:44] this is significant and understanding
[14:47] science
[14:49] so the king is not looking for people
[14:50] who don't want to pick up a book
[14:52] or study a craft or dough they they're
[14:55] not saying
[14:55] they're not playing games during the
[14:57] pandemic all they're doing is playing
[14:58] video games
[15:00] this is not what he's looking for all
[15:01] the really pandemic
[15:03] they they just want entertainment this
[15:05] is people who have already exhibited
[15:07] some level of discipline i want to touch
[15:10] on that because
[15:10] for you to be skilled in wisdom and
[15:13] cunning in knowledge
[15:15] and understanding science that is not
[15:18] genetic it is not hereditary
[15:22] it is disciplined to be there in the
[15:24] first place
[15:26] and such has has has had ability in them
[15:30] to stand in the king's palace now that
[15:32] is powerful
[15:33] because there are people who are so
[15:34] bright or so intelligent
[15:36] that they cannot stand in the king's
[15:37] palace because you have to know your
[15:39] place in the king's palace
[15:40] now i can speak a whole hour just on
[15:42] this one verse alone
[15:44] so he was looking for it's almost like
[15:46] he was looking for a resume format
[15:49] you're looking good you can get along
[15:51] with people you're not wasting your time
[15:53] you're interested in self-development
[15:55] you're interested in self-progress
[15:57] you're interested in
[15:58] advancement such had the ability to
[16:02] stand in a king's palace
[16:04] in the king's palace guests would come
[16:07] visitors would come
[16:08] the expectation in the king's palace is
[16:10] that you conduct yourself
[16:11] a certain way to be there because the
[16:13] kingdoms who want to be embarrassed
[16:15] when visitors come into the king's
[16:17] palace i want you to understand the
[16:19] ramifications of what these things mean
[16:22] and whom they might teach the learning
[16:25] and the tongue of the chaldeans
[16:26] so they're looking for young men who not
[16:30] only
[16:30] knew or had experience or had conduct or
[16:33] had favor
[16:34] but were also trainable that they could
[16:36] teach something too
[16:37] that is powerful and that's why we are
[16:39] here tonight i am a student
[16:41] i just happen to be a student who's also
[16:43] teaching
[16:44] but for me to teach i have to be a
[16:46] student to learn
[16:47] so our attitude when we come into church
[16:50] or in any encounter with anybody
[16:52] is what can i learn because i want to
[16:54] grow
[16:55] and if i ask a question tonight if this
[16:58] king
[16:58] this king nebuchadnezzar wanted people
[17:01] who was trainable
[17:02] wanted people who were already doing
[17:04] something for themselves
[17:06] wanted something for people who were
[17:07] interested in self-development
[17:10] don't you think god who is bigger than
[17:12] this natural king
[17:13] would want people who were interested in
[17:16] developing
[17:17] we're interested in progress interested
[17:19] in improvement
[17:20] interested in learning in this case he
[17:23] wanted them to learn
[17:24] the tongue and and the mitchie learning
[17:27] and the tongue of the childians
[17:29] isn't it appropriate to expect that god
[17:32] wants us to learn his tongue
[17:33] he wants us to learn how he speaks he
[17:36] wants us to learn his will
[17:37] he wants us to learn his thinking he
[17:39] wants us to learn his behavior
[17:41] so i want us to connect with this and
[17:44] the king
[17:44] appointed them a daily provision of the
[17:47] king's meat
[17:48] and of the wine that he drank so
[17:50] nourishing them for three years
[17:52] so after all of these qualifications had
[17:54] already been met
[17:55] they were going on a three-year
[17:57] apprenticeship
[17:58] so to graduate into the class to stand
[18:01] in a certain way
[18:03] in front of the king that at the end
[18:05] thereof of the three year period
[18:07] they might stand before the king now
[18:09] among these
[18:11] were of the children of judah which we
[18:13] know the children of judah
[18:15] is a tribe of royalty the kings came
[18:18] from the tribe of judah
[18:20] in so much that we call christ the lion
[18:24] the lion of the tribe of judah so if you
[18:26] were to type into the jungle the lion is
[18:28] the king of the jungle
[18:29] they give jesus the italian royal the
[18:31] lion of the tribe of judah
[18:32] so from the tribe of judah were four
[18:35] young men who met all of these
[18:38] characteristics i want you to appreciate
[18:40] the position of daniel in the fact that
[18:43] there would be no
[18:44] daniel if daniel didn't meet these
[18:46] criteria isn't this marvelous
[18:48] to see the selection of god the election
[18:51] of god
[18:52] now understand this before daniel could
[18:55] have been in that room
[18:56] danny would have never known what he was
[18:58] preparing for
[18:59] that's why i i i could bring the example
[19:02] all your years of coming to this was
[19:04] preparing you for something you didn't
[19:06] even know what you were preparing for
[19:08] so danielle doing his little school book
[19:10] daniel doing his little bible study
[19:12] daniel during his little prayer time not
[19:14] knowing that all of his preparation
[19:16] was creating a resume for himself
[19:19] that both in the natural and in
[19:21] spiritual he could be chosen for his
[19:23] mission
[19:24] anybody with me tonight and among these
[19:28] were of the children of judah daniel
[19:30] hannah
[19:31] hananiah michelle and azariah
[19:34] four men unto whom the prince of the
[19:37] eunuchs gave names
[19:38] for he gave unto daniel belteshazza and
[19:41] hananiah
[19:42] shadrach and adamitiel meshach and
[19:45] azariah
[19:47] so daniel and what we call the three
[19:49] hebrew boys
[19:51] had met this criteria of being young men
[19:54] who were trainable
[19:55] young men who stood out young men who
[19:58] understood science
[19:59] young men who understood wisdom can the
[20:01] church say amen
[20:03] so you see god loves to use people that
[20:06] he could train and use
[20:08] so i want to build a little bit if if
[20:09] you could ride with me a little bit
[20:13] the reason that they were even in that
[20:16] situation
[20:17] in the first place is because they the
[20:20] children of israel had backslid
[20:22] so god would allow babylon to conquer
[20:26] them
[20:27] now i don't have all the time tonight to
[20:29] get into it but daniel is a
[20:31] very very interesting character
[20:35] ancient babylon some of you may know is
[20:37] what we call modern day iraq
[20:40] in fact saddam hussein before he was
[20:43] taken out
[20:44] in when he was alive he was quoted to
[20:46] sing he is a modern day king
[20:47] nebuchadnezzar
[20:49] now when you begin to study the life of
[20:51] daniel daniel is an anomaly and
[20:54] there's a lot because we know daniel is
[20:56] the one who who who would have seen the
[20:59] who would have seen mysteries these
[21:01] seven thunders was revealed to daniel
[21:02] and when he was told to write it not
[21:04] daniel is the only character in
[21:05] scripture where there's a conversation
[21:07] with him
[21:08] talking about gabriel and michael he's
[21:10] like the only character
[21:11] in scripture who could reference on this
[21:14] interaction with michael and gabriel
[21:16] daniel is a unique character in
[21:18] scripture
[21:19] so he's young he's 16 years old and he
[21:22] would die at around 86 years old i was i
[21:24] was having a conversation
[21:28] these these comic strips about the bible
[21:30] and stuff
[21:31] really paying daniel as a young man in
[21:33] the lion's den
[21:34] but if you really study scripture then
[21:36] it would have had to be
[21:38] some argue early 80s or at least in the
[21:41] 70s any lions then
[21:42] that was not a boy in the lion's den and
[21:44] we can spend a whole hour going through
[21:46] that
[21:47] but daniel is unique he has a testimony
[21:51] he maintains his testimony because when
[21:53] you read down through it
[21:54] daniel purpose in his heart this is
[21:56] verse 8 continuing
[21:58] that he would not defile himself with a
[22:01] portion of the king's meat
[22:03] nor the wine which he drank now we would
[22:06] have heard this reference before
[22:07] but i want to highlight the fact that
[22:09] here is a young man
[22:11] now plays in a position where he has the
[22:14] best treatment
[22:15] he has the best attention the king
[22:18] assigns to him
[22:20] people to take care of him and he still
[22:22] has the integrity
[22:24] he still makes a decision to maintain
[22:26] his testimony
[22:28] he still makes a decision without
[22:31] anybody else around him save those other
[22:34] hebrew boys as it will
[22:36] and they unanimously decide that
[22:39] whatever is presented to us will not
[22:42] compromise
[22:42] what we know to be the truth what we
[22:44] believe to be the truth
[22:46] anybody with me so we are dealing with
[22:50] so i want to carry something through
[22:51] here because i would have addressed the
[22:53] church i think about two weeks ago about
[22:54] the discipline of the word
[22:56] and i'm seeing a pattern here in the
[22:58] life of both daniel and the hebrew boys
[23:01] but we are talking about daniel
[23:02] specifically
[23:03] it was discipline that would have led
[23:05] him to study
[23:07] it was discipline it takes discipline to
[23:09] bridle your tongue
[23:10] so to stand in the palace it takes
[23:12] discipline
[23:14] it takes discipline when the food is
[23:16] offered
[23:17] the meat and the wine it takes
[23:18] discipline to say no
[23:21] that discipline is separate from a
[23:23] spiritual condition i want to make the
[23:25] point
[23:26] because you can get disciplined from
[23:27] alcoholics anonymous
[23:29] somebody who has true struggles with
[23:31] alcohol you can get disciplined from
[23:32] alcoholics anonymous
[23:34] so discipline is separate from a
[23:36] spiritual encounter
[23:38] so i want to make the point that is why
[23:40] the bible can say present your bodies
[23:42] a living sacrifice holy and acceptable
[23:46] unto god it is your reasonable service
[23:48] because that is that reasonable service
[23:50] is a function of discipline
[23:53] the holy ghost comes to give you power
[23:56] but you don't have an excuse to be in
[23:58] discipline i want to make the point
[24:00] because people many times say well it's
[24:01] because i'm waiting for god is why i do
[24:03] any nonsense and
[24:04] really it's a lack of discipline that
[24:07] pervades itself throughout every aspect
[24:09] of your life
[24:10] but not with daniel it was discipline
[24:12] that brought him into the palace
[24:14] it was disciplined that maintained his
[24:16] testimony in the palace can i get
[24:19] a witness in the house tonight so it
[24:21] takes discipline to be in this room
[24:23] tonight it takes discipline to pray
[24:25] it takes discipline to fast it take
[24:27] discipline every single day
[24:29] to be able to say no i don't want that
[24:31] and and daniel
[24:33] and listen the bible said that you know
[24:35] let me read it
[24:36] and the prince of the eunuch setter
[24:38] daniel i fear my lord the king
[24:40] who has appointed your meat and your
[24:43] drink
[24:43] for why should he see your faces worse
[24:47] likened than the children which are of
[24:49] your sort then shall he make me endanger
[24:51] my head to the king so the united say
[24:53] listen
[24:54] if all they do take this food from the
[24:55] king is my neck in trouble
[24:57] because ollie will not look healthy then
[25:00] daniel said
[25:01] unto the prince of the eunuchs prove thy
[25:04] servant i beseech you 10 days
[25:06] and let them give us pulse and water so
[25:08] so don't give us the king's meat and we
[25:10] know this story
[25:11] after the 10 days daniel and the hebrew
[25:13] boys look fairer
[25:14] so daniel had you wisdom to negotiate
[25:18] to maintain his testimony he had the
[25:20] wisdom to negotiate and
[25:22] i really want to fight for something
[25:23] here
[25:25] brothers and sisters about maintaining
[25:27] your testimony
[25:29] maintaining your discipline because
[25:31] we're going to build this
[25:32] into his life because here we see daniel
[25:36] in his teenage years this is not an
[25:38] adult
[25:39] this is not 20 thirty fourteen fifty and
[25:42] we struggle with people
[25:43] in their fifties and sixties who still
[25:44] can't be here
[25:47] anybody with me tonight this is a
[25:50] teenager
[25:51] who not only starts off right but
[25:53] finishes right now
[25:54] biblical scholars are perplexed about
[25:57] this one
[25:58] because we have moses saying drinky
[26:01] rebels
[26:02] we have abraham lying about his wife we
[26:05] have all these testimonies but you know
[26:07] i put you some homework find one
[26:10] scripture that
[26:11] represents where daniel fell now we know
[26:14] all fall short in some way
[26:16] but there's no record in scripture of
[26:18] daniel's
[26:22] mystics
[26:24] that is your homework
[26:28] so daniel had such a life of integrity
[26:31] that god gave him grace with that and in
[26:34] fact
[26:34] ezekiel says there were three very in
[26:37] ezekiel
[26:38] 14 14 he speaks of three very righteous
[26:41] men
[26:42] anybody knows that let me find
[26:46] ezekiel but then we don't sunday school
[26:49] tonight right
[26:50] is that okay
[26:54] ezekiel
[27:01] though these three men ezekiel 14 14.
[27:03] though these
[27:04] three men noah daniel and job were in it
[27:09] they should deliver but they're also by
[27:10] their righteousness say the lord
[27:12] god so it means out of all the biblical
[27:15] characters
[27:16] these men stood out to god for their
[27:19] righteousness
[27:20] remember job there's none like this man
[27:22] on earth like job
[27:23] anybody with me god search the whole
[27:26] earth and say there's nobody like noah
[27:28] so he pulls noah out from a sinful world
[27:32] and he puts daniel in that same category
[27:34] it's all there in scripture
[27:36] three men stood head and shoulders above
[27:39] everybody else job god was boasting
[27:43] about you
[27:44] throw whatever you want at job he will
[27:46] stand the test of time and he did
[27:49] look at noah out of the whole earth goku
[27:51] called noah and dan is in that same
[27:53] category
[27:54] and god gave grace to him by not even
[27:56] showing us
[27:57] you any weakness that daniel would make
[28:00] friends
[28:01] young people church deacon elder
[28:04] minister
[28:05] from a very young age or whatever age
[28:07] you are now you can make a decision to
[28:09] live a disciplined
[28:11] spiritual life with god i want to nail
[28:13] that down
[28:14] to us tonight
[28:18] i also want to highlight something very
[28:19] interesting because we did another bible
[28:21] study
[28:22] i want to go back to verse 7 and unto
[28:25] whom the prince of the eunuchs gives
[28:26] name for he gave
[28:28] unto daniel the name of belter shaza and
[28:31] tahana naya of
[28:32] shadrach and the mitchell of meshach and
[28:34] the azariah of abednego
[28:37] now this is so significant that many
[28:39] people don't really study it now
[28:41] daniel by by name
[28:45] daniel means my judge is elohim or my
[28:48] judge is god
[28:51] they were actually giving them
[28:53] babylonian names
[28:56] that was to be almost a resistance to
[28:58] their
[28:59] israel or jewish name so belted the name
[29:03] they gave to daniel
[29:04] was bell is my judge bail being the
[29:07] babylonian god
[29:09] i want you to process that for a second
[29:11] so daniel
[29:12] as worthy as he was they gave him a name
[29:16] and all of the names that were given to
[29:18] them
[29:19] were names that were contrary to their
[29:21] jewish names
[29:23] but it is a deep teaching that no matter
[29:26] what label
[29:28] is placed upon you whether it's in your
[29:30] job in your family
[29:31] you can rise above the label because the
[29:35] label they give to daniel
[29:37] daniels throw off the label
[29:40] because he knew baal is not his judge he
[29:43] was not answering to the gods of the
[29:45] babylonians
[29:46] he was answering to his god and his
[29:48] testimony was carried through that
[29:50] anybody with me tonight
[29:53] so i want to like i say this is part one
[29:56] if i keep going this could take us to
[29:58] midnight at least
[29:59] i don't have anybody willing to stay
[30:00] until midnight but this could take us a
[30:02] little ways but i want to highlight
[30:04] a few points about danielle so give it a
[30:07] little encouragement and then we're
[30:08] going to try to bring this to a little
[30:10] close
[30:11] so we talked we touched on the fact that
[30:12] daniel is from the royal family
[30:16] we touch on the fact that daniel carried
[30:18] himself a certain way he's renowned in
[30:20] wisdom
[30:21] we know he interprets dreams we know he
[30:25] the bible give us no dirt on daniel in
[30:28] fact what is so interesting
[30:30] to see how how the in daniel
[30:33] 2 48 in 4 9 and 5 11 with the
[30:36] interventional dream
[30:38] they actually put down here to oversee
[30:42] he was the truth prefect of all the wise
[30:44] men in babylon
[30:45] who was handling all this immediately
[30:49] god put daniel to oversee all these
[30:51] immediately characters
[30:53] because daniel was an anomaly to them
[30:56] because in their world
[30:58] they say nobody's was able to to
[31:00] understand what god do and
[31:02] and and here it is daniel when the dream
[31:05] came and the king said he's not telling
[31:07] no he can't remember the dream or he
[31:08] can't he don't know who
[31:09] and i was able to present the dream
[31:11] animation we we know this right
[31:14] daniel has such a testimony that
[31:17] he serves and his life and the
[31:20] consistency of his testimony
[31:22] he serves under four different kings
[31:25] firstly
[31:26] nebuchadnezzar then belchaza
[31:29] then darius and then cyrus the persian
[31:33] he has a 70-year ministry that is
[31:36] unblemished
[31:37] and it was in his later part of his
[31:39] ministry
[31:41] and that's what i want to touch on
[31:42] before we go into prayer tonight
[31:45] in daniel 6 is where he ends up in the
[31:48] lion's den
[31:54] by the time daniel 6 is there darius is
[31:57] no
[31:58] king and
[32:01] the bible says in in daniel 6 it pleased
[32:05] darius to set over the kingdom and i
[32:09] always say
[32:10] whatever man does
[32:14] it is only a small fraction of the way
[32:16] god operates because god we know is a
[32:18] god of order
[32:19] and when you read through scripture you
[32:21] see man's best attempt
[32:23] to have a level of order and structure
[32:25] it please darius to set over the kingdom
[32:29] 120 princes now this is a heathen pagan
[32:32] kingdom
[32:33] 120 princes which should be over the
[32:36] whole kingdom i want you to process the
[32:37] context
[32:38] so it's a huge kingdom he has a hundred
[32:41] and
[32:41] twenty princes which set over the whole
[32:44] kingdom
[32:46] and above these three presidents
[32:50] depending many time we do so long to
[32:51] possess this right he has three
[32:53] presidents
[32:54] that oversee these hundred and twenty
[32:58] leaders these princes of whom
[33:01] daniel was first so daniel is called the
[33:04] first president
[33:06] that the princes might give account unto
[33:08] them
[33:09] and the king should have no damage so
[33:11] the king sets up
[33:13] an administrative structure for the
[33:15] kingdom by appointing 120 princes
[33:18] and picking three men and this is the
[33:21] third king
[33:22] that that daniel is serving under and
[33:24] daniel is always finding himself in this
[33:26] position of leadership
[33:29] mind-blowing that he is not the first
[33:32] out of the three presidents
[33:36] so that the king would have no damage
[33:38] and if you look at each other it mean
[33:39] like no loss so nothing would be out of
[33:41] cater
[33:42] things would run officially et cetera et
[33:43] cetera then this daniel was preferred
[33:46] above the presidents and princes because
[33:49] an excellent spirit was in him
[33:52] could people say that about you that is
[33:55] such an
[33:55] excellent spirit in you that they could
[33:58] trust you to run the kingdom
[34:01] when people look at you can they say
[34:03] it's an excellent way about you
[34:06] i was saying in one of our offices
[34:08] meeting that there's good
[34:09] there's better and there's best you
[34:11] could do things good you could do it
[34:13] better
[34:13] but god really wants the best and here
[34:16] we have
[34:16] and i want you to catch your friends
[34:18] because the super spiritual people we
[34:20] deal with
[34:21] this is a man who god has in government
[34:24] he is part of administration he is his
[34:27] sharp in business in science and
[34:29] leadership
[34:30] and he still maintains his spiritual
[34:32] testimony
[34:34] i want you to get to that for a minute
[34:37] so you could find the balance with life
[34:39] and godliness
[34:40] nobody telling you go be mountain and
[34:42] don't come down
[34:44] but don't ever lose the anchor for your
[34:47] soul or the testimony you have as a
[34:48] christian
[34:50] but god wants you to succeed he wants
[34:52] you to prosper
[34:53] he wants you like i was in a meeting
[34:55] this morning in my office
[34:57] and i said somebody was stepping into
[34:59] our industry i say
[35:00] listen i want to be so good i want to be
[35:03] so good at what we do
[35:05] that we punish them no no i don't try to
[35:07] punish nobody but when you want your
[35:08] work to be so good
[35:10] that people say you know what i give up
[35:12] i don't want to try no more
[35:14] but that happens when you do your work a
[35:16] certain way because when god
[35:17] finished in the book of genesis 1 and
[35:21] it was it was good it was perfect he
[35:23] could rest
[35:25] so i want us to understand that god
[35:28] desires perfection it is an
[35:29] excellent and an excellent testimony
[35:33] so then there's daniel and
[35:36] animoare daniel because listen i've
[35:38] always said admire david and
[35:40] that's why zika exhausted scripture
[35:42] because dave a man after god's own heart
[35:44] i can't identify with david's struggle
[35:46] his ups and downs many of the increase
[35:48] about me many as many did i see as my
[35:50] soul there's no help
[35:52] helping for him and god if you look at
[35:54] at psalms 13
[35:56] you see this is how i started to extend
[35:58] my time what time it is
[36:01] when you read psalm 13 you see a man on
[36:04] the heap
[36:05] of depression in two verses he asking
[36:08] god five questions
[36:09] how long will gopher get me oh lord
[36:12] forever how long will thou hide thy face
[36:15] from me
[36:16] how long shall i take counsel in my soul
[36:18] having sorrow in my heart daily
[36:21] how long shall my enemy be exalted over
[36:23] me
[36:25] that why i could identify with them god
[36:27] see what i dies i mean sometimes how
[36:29] long will don't forget me
[36:30] oh lord oh lord forever forever
[36:34] forever you'll forget me how long will i
[36:37] hide my face from me
[36:38] but here you see a man reconciling with
[36:41] god consider
[36:42] and hear me oh lord my god lighten my
[36:45] eyes lest i sleep the sleep of death in
[36:46] other words
[36:47] if you don't give me some hope his
[36:48] brother dies
[36:52] lest my enemy say i have revealed
[36:55] against him
[36:55] and those that trouble me rejoice when i
[36:58] am moved
[37:00] but i have trusted in thy mercy that's
[37:02] david
[37:03] my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation
[37:05] i will sing it to the lord look at me
[37:07] reverse his whole position by the time
[37:09] he reaches verse six he don't
[37:10] he don't convince himself out of a
[37:12] situation that's david
[37:14] man after god's own heart
[37:17] but true scripture this is why i say we
[37:19] have no excuse because we can look
[37:21] through scripture
[37:22] and see the different situations the
[37:24] struggles the problems the hopes
[37:26] the confidence and see how god could
[37:28] work no matter what the situation is
[37:30] let me try to keep on target few more
[37:33] minutes
[37:34] so then this daniel was preferred above
[37:37] the president and princes why was he
[37:40] preferred
[37:42] because an excellent spirit was in him
[37:45] our desire
[37:46] must be to have an excellent spirit in
[37:48] us that should be our testimony
[37:51] if that is not your testimony you need
[37:54] to start to change it tonight
[37:56] that on your job in your marriage in
[37:58] your business in your neighborhood
[38:00] people must say there's an excellent
[38:02] spirit in you
[38:04] and the king thought to set him over the
[38:06] whole realm
[38:08] so so the king because of the excellent
[38:10] spirit about daniel
[38:12] decide to now elevate him above
[38:14] president status
[38:15] and see you in charge of the whole realm
[38:18] we have
[38:18] examples of this this is joseph so the
[38:21] parallels repeat itself
[38:23] it's the same thing jose was left in
[38:24] charge of the whole of egypt
[38:27] here we have a jew joseph head of egypt
[38:30] a heathen world here you have daniel
[38:33] about to be elevated
[38:34] so it is not uncommon for god to raise
[38:37] you
[38:37] among your own family raise you above
[38:40] your own
[38:40] neighborhood raise you above your
[38:42] circumstances
[38:43] and elevate you dialed in and evade
[38:46] himself
[38:48] king after king would come and something
[38:50] about his
[38:51] life would attract them and place him
[38:53] into opposition of leadership
[38:55] can the church say amen open doors for
[38:57] him he couldn't open for himself
[38:59] can the church say amen
[39:02] no listen now this is where we get into
[39:04] it i'm trying to close up brother
[39:05] could i keep going
[39:09] then the president and princes listen
[39:12] there now sort of find occasion against
[39:14] daniel considering the kingdom
[39:15] so i want you to catch this it was not
[39:18] his spiritual life
[39:20] that attracted the attack
[39:24] god blessed daniel so much his
[39:27] natural life attracted the attack
[39:30] that's deep that is that's a whole
[39:33] message by itself
[39:34] the the other ambitious leaders the
[39:37] bible says sought to find occasion or
[39:39] reason or a problem or an issue against
[39:42] daniel concerning the kingdom
[39:44] concerning his authority considering his
[39:47] leadership
[39:47] considering how he rose to the level he
[39:49] did not by his own doing but by the
[39:51] spirit upon him that attracted favor
[39:54] because god was with him can the church
[39:56] say amen
[39:57] but listen to this but they could find
[40:00] none occasion no
[40:02] fault for as much as he was faithful
[40:05] neither was there any error or fault
[40:08] found in him wow
[40:12] wow i heard somebody we had i was having
[40:15] a conversation about this with somebody
[40:16] and say what a testimony to desire to
[40:19] have
[40:19] that's when i say neither was there no
[40:22] error
[40:23] or fault found in him this gives us
[40:25] something to desire something to aspire
[40:27] to you know
[40:27] that your daily walk could attract a
[40:30] testimony
[40:31] a couple of trying to pull a file on him
[40:33] boy i'm trying to pull a file
[40:34] i getting nothing so they found nothing
[40:38] then said these men we shall not find
[40:40] any occasion they get frustrated
[40:42] against this daniel except we find it
[40:45] against him
[40:46] concerning the law of his god so it was
[40:49] after they do
[40:50] you know when they're going off the
[40:51] election they just go and dig up in all
[40:53] your past
[40:54] they're trying to find something to pin
[40:56] daniel with all
[40:57] attempts at trying to derail daniel
[41:00] field
[41:01] so they say the only thing we could
[41:03] possibly use against daniel
[41:05] is something tied to the law of his god
[41:07] what does he tell us
[41:08] throughout all of his life his career if
[41:12] i could use that word career
[41:13] working in the courts of kings for
[41:15] almost 70 years
[41:17] he maintained a testimony not only a
[41:21] testimony of character
[41:22] but a testimony of the law of his god
[41:25] hallelujah
[41:26] the law of his god was maintained so
[41:29] they say the only thing we could find is
[41:30] something with the law of his god
[41:33] can somebody say there's something about
[41:35] this man there's something about this
[41:36] woman there's something about this
[41:38] deacon
[41:38] this elder this one that they don't
[41:40] compromise the law of the accord
[41:43] can the church say amen then these
[41:46] presidents
[41:47] and princes so if you do the match with
[41:51] me
[41:51] it should have two more presidents 120
[41:54] princes
[41:55] 122 of them against daniel
[41:59] assemble together to the king now it's
[42:02] interesting because i wonder
[42:04] what was he king thinking because daniel
[42:07] was no wrong i don't know where daniel
[42:08] was when this meeting was happening
[42:11] what time they choose to come to see the
[42:13] king and why did he say well why isn't
[42:15] daniel with you i don't know how
[42:17] that city was here but here 120 of them
[42:19] come to daniel
[42:21] come to a king sorry and
[42:24] said just unto him king darius live
[42:26] forever watch not
[42:29] live forever as if you could ever live
[42:31] forever king diaries live forever
[42:33] all of the presidents of the kingdom the
[42:36] governors
[42:37] and the princes the councilors and the
[42:39] captains
[42:40] that is the whole administration the
[42:42] whole government the the the
[42:44] the the corporation the parliament
[42:47] the opposition they bring the whole
[42:49] resume everybody you all
[42:52] administration so you want to tell me
[42:54] you are people against you
[42:56] daniel had the old government the old
[42:59] system against him
[43:02] have consulted together to establish a
[43:05] royal statute
[43:06] and to make a film decree that whosoever
[43:10] shall ask a petition of any god or man
[43:14] so they put all man in there to wrap the
[43:16] king himself to make him feel good about
[43:18] himself
[43:19] any prayer for god or man sorry
[43:22] for that he is safe save of the your
[43:24] king or
[43:25] in other words the only person they
[43:27] should come to is you
[43:28] as the king the cargo to any god
[43:32] or any man except you the king
[43:35] shall be cast into the den of lions now
[43:38] or king
[43:39] established the decree and signed the
[43:42] writing
[43:43] that it be not changed according to the
[43:45] law of the medes and persians
[43:47] which alter it not does that sound
[43:49] familiar
[43:51] the lord will change this was the same
[43:53] thing i do not recall in the story of
[43:55] esther
[43:56] when the decree was made to go after
[43:59] all the children of israel in that time
[44:01] do you remember do you remember
[44:03] the law could not be changed so when he
[44:06] iman was hanged
[44:07] what did the king do the king told them
[44:10] am
[44:10] tell them to arm themselves so they are
[44:13] they
[44:13] are giving them permission to defend
[44:15] themselves because
[44:16] pull back the law which is also biblical
[44:20] because when the blessings
[44:23] was passed to jacob and the word was
[44:26] spoken there was nothing else to pass to
[44:28] esau
[44:29] because the word don't come back once it
[44:30] released from the bow once the blessing
[44:32] leaves god can't even pull back the
[44:34] blessing
[44:35] can the church say man everybody with me
[44:38] tonight
[44:40] so they wanted the king to establish a
[44:42] decree and sign the writing i'm trying
[44:45] to i'm trying to wrap
[44:46] up so that they be changed not according
[44:48] to the law
[44:50] where wherefore king darius signed the
[44:52] writing and the decree
[44:54] now when daniel no this is where it gets
[44:56] interesting we're coming to a close
[44:58] knew that the writing was signed so this
[45:01] is not him being ignorant of it
[45:03] and the bible writes it a certain way
[45:05] and this is your testimony
[45:06] when you knew that the boss did it
[45:09] against you when you knew
[45:10] your co-worker did it when you knew this
[45:12] happened and you knew the situation was
[45:14] bad and you knew it's nothing in favor
[45:16] when daniel knew that the writing was
[45:18] signed he went into his house
[45:20] and his windows being opened in his
[45:22] chamber
[45:23] toward jerusalem he kneeled upon his
[45:26] knees
[45:27] three times a day and prayed and gave
[45:29] thanks
[45:30] before his god as he did a fourth time
[45:33] in other words
[45:34] he did not break his routine he didn't
[45:37] change for nobody he didn't close his
[45:39] door he didn't close the window he
[45:41] didn't pray in secret
[45:43] he kept doing what he had been doing for
[45:46] 70 years
[45:47] he kept doing what he had been faithful
[45:50] to for 70 years
[45:51] he kept doing what had kept him going
[45:54] for 70 years
[45:55] this new trial didn't change his
[45:57] discipline
[45:58] this new trial didn't change his focus
[46:01] this new situation
[46:02] didn't change his testimony this new
[46:04] situation didn't change his fate
[46:07] anybody with me tonight and you must
[46:10] have that conviction
[46:12] you must have that conviction we serve a
[46:16] living god
[46:17] we serve a resurrected god we stand for
[46:20] a message that is true
[46:21] and will never fear no matter what enemy
[46:23] comes against it
[46:24] we have to have the ability to stand for
[46:27] what we believe
[46:28] no matter the cost no matter the cost
[46:32] can the church say man i was just
[46:35] sharing with my wife before this
[46:36] service i said but abraham said so many
[46:39] things
[46:40] that the world can't eat there's so many
[46:43] things the prophet has that the word
[46:44] can't tolerate
[46:45] that they would call hate speech now and
[46:47] recently some of you may know
[46:49] russia banned certain books from brother
[46:51] branham
[46:52] because brother branham would speak
[46:54] plainly you know holding it back is the
[46:55] truth
[46:56] in the same way that's why brother
[46:57] branham would say if
[46:59] if god don't judge this world he will
[47:02] have to repent
[47:03] to sodom and gomorrah and bring them
[47:04] back up again
[47:06] but in this world of liberation to the
[47:08] world movement
[47:10] where it's it's it's it's don't say this
[47:12] freedom of this
[47:13] freedom of this live and let's live love
[47:15] everybody love is love and oh i know all
[47:17] these things
[47:20] what will your testimony be when you
[47:21] opposition come close your door
[47:23] and hide we're not saying don't be wise
[47:27] and don't use wisdom
[47:28] but you have to know where your ground
[47:29] is you have to know what you're standing
[47:30] for you have to know what you believe
[47:32] you have to know what is truth
[47:33] because only the truth will set you free
[47:35] in the hour of darkness only the truth
[47:37] will keep you alive
[47:39] many people will say i don't know that
[47:41] man just like peter before his
[47:43] conversion
[47:44] peter was there for three and a half
[47:46] years he saw the miracles he saw five
[47:48] loaves and two fishes in fact he was the
[47:49] one one of them would say what was jesus
[47:51] among so
[47:53] so you know and and he was there but
[47:56] when the
[47:58] when when the pressure come he said i
[48:00] don't know him i don't know him
[48:02] deny and jesus saw this and still
[48:06] saw the seed in him would overcome
[48:09] because his seed was greater
[48:11] greater than his current situation
[48:13] greater than his pressure
[48:14] let me try to wrap up now when daniel
[48:17] knew
[48:17] that the writing was signed he went into
[48:20] his house and his windows being open
[48:22] did god left it here in scripture for
[48:25] you to see the backbone this man had
[48:29] as an old man now around 70
[48:33] close to the early 80s he's not he's not
[48:36] 15 anymore he's not 25 he's not 35 he's
[48:38] not 45
[48:40] but he you see i come too fast to turn
[48:42] back now
[48:43] i believe this thing for so long i've
[48:45] not given up nothing you do
[48:47] can change me i am trying to protect my
[48:49] position by not praying anymore
[48:52] i'm not trying to protect my office by
[48:54] giving my office not work for prayer
[48:56] like come on now
[48:58] but prayer life is more important than
[48:59] this position they're fighting for
[49:02] is god put me in this position he can
[49:04] keep business business
[49:05] don't touch my prayer life because my
[49:06] prayer life is my defense
[49:08] my prayer life is my weapon my prayer
[49:10] life is my confidence
[49:11] my prayer life is my bank my prayer life
[49:13] is my doctor
[49:14] because i could plug in there any time
[49:17] can the church say amen
[49:22] three times a day three times a day
[49:26] the bible says and prayed and give
[49:28] thanks before his god as he did
[49:30] her fourth time i'm trying to close out
[49:33] and these men assembled and found daniel
[49:35] praying and making supplication before
[49:37] his god
[49:38] then they came near and bespake before
[49:40] the king concerning the king's decree
[49:43] has doubled not signed a decree that
[49:46] every man
[49:46] that shall ask a petition of any god or
[49:50] man
[49:50] within 30 days save of thee
[49:54] or king shall be cast in the dead of
[49:56] lions the king anton said the thing is
[49:58] true
[49:58] according to the law of the meat and
[50:00] persons which alter it not
[50:02] then answered thee and said before the
[50:04] king because now they feel they catch
[50:05] him
[50:06] they are talking about they come and say
[50:08] but you know remember the lawyer make
[50:09] you remember you see nobody should ask
[50:10] any petitions nobody should make any
[50:12] plea
[50:12] you remember that he said well yeah i
[50:14] remember we catch you he said good no
[50:16] that daniel witches are the children of
[50:19] the captivity of judah
[50:20] now understand this it's 70 years
[50:24] daniel there i want you to catch this
[50:26] how the enemy is operating
[50:27] in 70 years he served under four
[50:29] different kings and they're still
[50:31] talking about the captivity of judah oh
[50:33] god almighty
[50:34] this future and the pin the heritage the
[50:37] issue
[50:37] is where he come from and that is why
[50:39] young people in church you will never
[50:41] fit into this world
[50:44] you will never fit in for all the time
[50:47] daniel was there
[50:48] they did they never welcomed him into
[50:50] their circle oh come on somebody i want
[50:52] you to catch this
[50:54] he was his position as high as he was he
[50:57] was about to be appointed head of the
[50:58] realm
[50:59] and he was still not accepted because he
[51:01] was not from there
[51:05] and god could elevate you in any
[51:06] position here but your kingdom is not of
[51:09] this world
[51:10] you're from another place you're not
[51:11] another time another dimension kind of
[51:13] the church say amen
[51:16] that daniel which is of the children of
[51:17] the captivity of judah regarded not be
[51:20] your king
[51:20] knows the decree that thou has signed
[51:23] but making his petition three times a
[51:25] day
[51:26] they come and bring the complaint to the
[51:28] king that daniel playing three times a
[51:29] day has anybody complained about you
[51:31] praying three times a day anybody
[51:34] complain
[51:34] that you're praying oh come on now let
[51:37] me see the hands
[51:38] anybody complaining like i said with
[51:41] with
[51:41] jacob i want my limp you see when jacob
[51:44] finished wrestle with the angel
[51:45] he had his limp i want people to see my
[51:48] limp i want people to complain
[51:50] that i praying three times a day i want
[51:51] them to complain about me
[51:53] that i praying three times a day i
[51:55] wanted to know i met the angel
[51:57] that must be your testimony let it not
[51:59] be hidden let it be a reality to you
[52:01] kind of church say man
[52:04] they complain they complain about him
[52:07] that he said that he that he
[52:10] peop that to make it with the three
[52:12] times so they knew
[52:14] they knew they knew then the king
[52:17] when he heard these words was so
[52:18] displeased with himself so the king and
[52:20] all regret his decision
[52:21] he said may i make her out i didn't
[52:23] realize there was daniel only trying to
[52:25] capture all you know well they all make
[52:27] me feel good and see people coming to me
[52:28] i'm ready you want to get right and he
[52:31] set his heart on daniel
[52:34] this is a heathen king a pagan king
[52:37] this is not uh uh what we would call a
[52:39] godly king
[52:40] but daniel had such an effect upon him
[52:44] i want you to process this that it
[52:46] bothered this king
[52:48] that daniel was in this trouble oh god
[52:50] talk about finding fearful with god with
[52:52] men that scripture
[52:53] finding people with god and men
[52:57] then the king when he heard these words
[52:59] was so displeased with himself
[53:01] and set his heart on danny to deliver
[53:03] him and he labored till the going down
[53:05] of the sun
[53:06] to deliver him so the king himself went
[53:09] into petition mode
[53:12] that is when he really have a testimony
[53:14] that is like
[53:15] what i reference to somebody about the
[53:17] the the centurion who had his servant
[53:20] who was so valuable that he went out of
[53:22] his way
[53:23] out of his character to get to jesus to
[53:25] speak a word
[53:27] are you so valuable to people that are
[53:29] willing to make
[53:30] an extra effort for you are you so
[53:32] valuable to the kingdom
[53:34] that god were willing to to go extra for
[53:36] you can the church say amen
[53:39] then these men assemble unto the king
[53:41] and said unto the king
[53:42] know o king that the law of the medes
[53:45] and the persians is that no
[53:46] decree nor statute which the king
[53:49] established may be changed
[53:50] so they are now arguing with the king
[53:52] about the lord the king make
[53:53] saying you may be looking you can't even
[53:55] change your own law
[53:57] then the king commanded and they brought
[53:59] daniel and cast him into the den of
[54:01] lions
[54:02] now the king spake and said unto daniel
[54:04] thy god whom does service continually
[54:07] he will deliver thee hallelujah
[54:11] oh glory are feeling good tonight oh
[54:14] my may everybody around you be able to
[54:18] testify about
[54:20] you hallelujah that thy god
[54:23] whom thou serve is continually he will
[54:25] deliver thee
[54:26] let it be my testimony let it be your
[54:29] testimony that we serve the lord
[54:31] continually
[54:32] we're not stopping praising we're not
[54:34] stopping believing we're not stopping
[54:36] worshiping
[54:37] we will serve god continually
[54:41] will deliver thee and a stone
[54:45] was brought and laid upon the mouth of
[54:46] the den and the king sealed it with his
[54:49] own signet
[54:50] and with the signature of his lords that
[54:52] the purpose
[54:53] might not be changed concerning daniel
[54:56] then the king went to his palace
[54:58] and passed the night fasting neither
