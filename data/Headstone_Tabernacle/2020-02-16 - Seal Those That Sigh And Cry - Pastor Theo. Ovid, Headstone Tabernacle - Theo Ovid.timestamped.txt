[1:07:43] paused them that have charged over the
[1:07:45] city to draw near even every man with
[1:07:48] his destroyed weapon in his hand I
[1:07:50] behold six men came from the way of the
[1:07:52] higher gate which lied towards the north
[1:07:54] and every man a slaughter weapon in his
[1:07:57] hand and one man among them was clothed
[1:08:00] with linen with a writer's inkhorn by
[1:08:02] his side and they went in and stood
[1:08:04] beside a brazen altar and the glory of
[1:08:06] the God of Israel was gone up from the
[1:08:08] chair
[1:08:08] whereupon he was to the threshold of the
[1:08:10] house and he called to the man clothed
[1:08:13] with linen which had a writer's ink one
[1:08:15] by his side and the Lord said unto Him
[1:08:17] the Lord said unto him go to the midst
[1:08:21] of the city through the midst of
[1:08:23] Jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[1:08:25] foreheads of the men that sigh and that
[1:08:28] cry for all the abominations that be
[1:08:30] done in the midst thereof unto the
[1:08:33] others he said in my hearing go ye after
[1:08:35] him to the city and smite let not your
[1:08:39] eyes spear neither Javie pity slay
[1:08:43] utterly all and young both maids a
[1:08:46] little children and woman but come not
[1:08:49] near any man upon whom is the mark and
[1:08:53] begin at my Suntory then they begin are
[1:08:57] the ancient men which were before the
[1:09:00] house or last script I read in assam for
[1:09:04] speeders after for over 17 for the time
[1:09:11] has come that judgment must begin at the
[1:09:14] house of God and if it is first begin at
[1:09:17] us what shall the end be of them that
[1:09:22] will be not the gospel of God and if the
[1:09:25] righteous scarcely be sealed where shall
[1:09:27] the ungodly and the sinner appear
[1:09:30] let us pray father we thank you for your
[1:09:32] word and we talking to the Scriptures
[1:09:34] being read and I and I pray or take me
[1:09:37] out of the way and circumcise the
[1:09:39] hearers of the word circumcise my own
[1:09:42] heart I mean your torch drop down Lord
[1:09:44] and speak lip to hear to your people
[1:09:45] even as your promise that the spirits
[1:09:47] and a bride will speak the spirit come
[1:09:50] upon the bride and speak the world and
[1:09:52] the world will hear direct from God may
[1:09:54] the believers hear hear direc from you
[1:09:57] this morning granted Lord in G Sam I ask
[1:09:59] at a man you may be seated or praise the
[1:10:01] Lord don't know how many of you have
[1:10:06] heard Wednesday night service if you
[1:10:07] have no good Wednesday night service go
[1:10:09] back and listen to it and I know
[1:10:13] something that the Lord give and I
[1:10:15] believe it would bless you
[1:10:16] the angel from the east having the seal
[1:10:19] of the Living God
[1:10:22] this is not more brother and special
[1:10:26] minister or bishop or whatever it is
[1:10:28] this is the Holy Spirit go out see the
[1:10:32] name Joe so this morning of an
[1:10:36] inspiration of two scriptures sort of
[1:10:39] context scriptures this from acts 19 and
[1:10:41] I want to read it and he came to pass
[1:10:43] that while Apollo's was at Corinth Paul
[1:10:45] having passed through the upper post
[1:10:47] came to Ephesus and financed certain
[1:10:49] disciples he said unto them have you
[1:10:51] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:10:52] believed and they said unto Him we have
[1:10:54] not atmost heard whether there be any
[1:10:57] all he goes so this was a new thing
[1:10:59] altogether they haven't heard about this
[1:11:01] thing called Holy Ghost and when he said
[1:11:04] unto them unto what will you baptize
[1:11:06] this another John baptism and he's then
[1:11:08] paul said john verily baptized with the
[1:11:11] baptism of repentance similar to the
[1:11:13] people that they should believe on him
[1:11:15] which should come after him that is on
[1:11:17] christ jesus when the here is they were
[1:11:19] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:21] and when Paul had laid his hands upon
[1:11:24] them here we go
[1:11:25] the Holy Ghost came on them and they
[1:11:31] speak with tongues and prophesied so
[1:11:34] this all he goes not a imaginary thing
[1:11:35] it could come on you it could come into
[1:11:39] you it could fill you Oprah do believe
[1:11:43] that it's not a explainin ting explain
[1:11:47] your habit already and no no we not
[1:11:49] explain all of that this is what he will
[1:11:51] say so I mean the poor laid his hands
[1:11:54] upon them I went poorly upon them
[1:11:58] the Holy Ghost came on them and they
[1:12:01] speak with tongues and prophesied on the
[1:12:03] other script I have is Matthew 5:6 from
[1:12:05] in the scripture blessed are they which
[1:12:07] do hunger and thirst after righteousness
[1:12:12] for they shall be filled
[1:12:15] not educated not informed not to bring
[1:12:19] at the booths they shall be filled
[1:12:23] who's gonna be filled those who hunger
[1:12:26] in
[1:12:27] and to stand after righteousness so the
[1:12:30] title this morning is sealed O's that
[1:12:32] cyan cry that's the title is warning
[1:12:35] sealed O's that sigh and cry you know
[1:12:40] Jesus said as one of these a sudden man
[1:12:42] switch be come in and they eat they
[1:12:44] drank they bought his soul and different
[1:12:46] things like that
[1:12:47] normal living different nothing Lucas up
[1:12:51] them that happen no they eat it drunk is
[1:12:53] soul but luck was luck was called out
[1:12:56] and when luck came out fire fell so you
[1:13:01] can watch the skies and the can watch
[1:13:02] the Sun on the moon and you can't watch
[1:13:04] or the grass growing and and corn barren
[1:13:07] and you're getting fruit and someone
[1:13:08] harvests it can't just watch that you
[1:13:10] have tours you would you have to focus
[1:13:12] on what God said and then you could get
[1:13:15] clarity of what is happening this is the
[1:13:16] easy thing to get you tune in to yellow
[1:13:18] oh praise that do you believe that oh
[1:13:20] praise the name of the Lord

[1:14:06] was commissioned by God don't come near
[1:14:09] any of those who was the seal in their
[1:14:13] forehead and the seal of God is the
[1:14:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost

[1:14:31] must sealed until the day of your
[1:14:33] redemption so no matter how hard the a

[1:22:55] always sent his guys he always never
[1:22:57] been without a guide
[1:22:58] all through the ages God always had
[1:23:01] somebody that represent him on the earth
[1:23:03] in all ages and sometimes when they get
[1:23:06] off the guide or off the beam as we
[1:23:08] would call it when Jesus was young good
[1:23:10] we'll remember geo certifiers is you
[1:23:12] blind guides you blind guides blind to
[1:23:16] spiritual things they were supposed to
[1:23:18] be guys guys to the people guiding the
[1:23:21] people to salvation but Jesus a Ukraine
[1:23:23] he said let them alone for if the blind
[1:23:26] lead the blind portal fall in the ditch
[1:23:29] plain guys how the world has been
[1:23:31] contaminated with that blind Gaiden and
[1:23:34] God sent a prophet in this nighttime to
[1:23:38] bring light that we wouldn't stumble in
[1:23:40] our steps once you're any ain't anything
[1:23:43] troubling to come back to a spoke one

[1:24:36] guide we must remember him here it says
[1:24:38] Jesus said I will not leave you
[1:24:39] comfortless but I pray the Father he
[1:24:41] will send you another comforter and this
[1:24:44] comforter when he was to come was the
[1:24:46] guidance to all truth and the Word of
[1:24:49] God is the truth and the word is Christ
[1:24:51] I'm the way the truth and the life he is
[1:24:53] the world isn't that right and when the
[1:24:55] churches today reject how can we ever
[1:24:57] expect to go to heaven when the Holy
[1:25:00] Spirit was sent to us for a guide we
[1:25:06] will take some Cardinal some bishop some
[1:25:10] general overseer or somebody like that
[1:25:13] to guide us the Indy 500 it's a fight
[1:25:25] for in the body and 500 to anybody if I
[1:25:28] fall in the body are men who are
[1:25:30] baptized by the Holy Ghost and placed
[1:25:32] inside are they're the ones who who have
[1:25:36] outsid buddy they're just men with gifts
[1:25:40] but no power and the Holy Spirit always
[1:25:48] speak the word I've got many things to
[1:25:50] tell you you can understand it no but
[1:25:52] when he comes he will guide you to it
[1:25:55] and there is where he brought this coat
[1:25:58] that's the reason the common of the
[1:26:00] seals at the finishing of the seventh
[1:26:03] seal the mystery of God shall be
[1:26:05] finished to know who God is what he is
[1:26:07] how he lives his nature is being you
[1:26:10] supposed to be all the way up there by
[1:26:11] that time
[1:26:12] oh my into bring us into the full
[1:26:15] stature of sons and daughters of God a
[1:26:17] church that's washed in the blood of
[1:26:18] Jesus Christ bought without money paid
[1:26:21] for by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:26:23] oh my hallelujah the guide knows the way
[1:26:26] he knows every inch of the way he knows
[1:26:28] every quarters in your heart he knows
[1:26:30] everybody that is here he knows who you
[1:26:33] are what you have done all about you
[1:26:36] he is course guide the Holy Spirit and
[1:26:39] reveal things to you and will tell you
[1:26:41] things that he heard he can repeat your
[1:26:43] words right back and say what you said
[1:26:46] tell you where you have been what you've
[1:26:49] God
[1:26:50] what your greater going all glory to God
[1:26:55] your car the clothes on that guy that
[1:26:57] guy to tell you entire life
[1:26:59] well glory I've got what you have done I
[1:27:01] want you wanna do what you're doing now
[1:27:03] the Holy Spirit will never make you say
[1:27:06] Amen to some kind of man-made Creed it
[1:27:08] will only punctuate the Word of God with
[1:27:11] an e men because the Holy Spirit will
[1:27:14] not lead you any other way
[1:27:16] all glory to God so you could only
[1:27:18] confirm the word when you hear the word
[1:27:20] your spirit your heart you say Amen so
[1:27:26] you see you need a guide he will guide
[1:27:29] you to truth and the truth is the world
[1:27:31] and it always has been God has never had
[1:27:34] to change nothing cause he's infinite
[1:27:37] and he knows what's best he is
[1:27:40] omnipresent he's omniscient his God is
[1:27:43] not right and the Holy Ghost a guide is
[1:27:46] the confirma
[1:27:47] of the world that he is teaching so if
[1:27:50] the Holy Spirit is teaching he confirms
[1:27:53] the world that he is teaching this he
[1:27:55] doesn't confirm it then something wrong
[1:27:57] with it but he's the consumer of the
[1:27:59] world he is teaching or glory to God and
[1:28:02] Luke said Luke was led by the guy to say
[1:28:05] go into all the world and preach the
[1:28:07] gospel to every creature he that
[1:28:09] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:28:10] he does believe it not shall be damned
[1:28:12] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:28:14] believe
[1:28:16] what was it science following what was
[1:28:18] it the guide vindicated that was to do
[1:28:21] truth that was God's policy that's the
[1:28:24] Whitley done that's his program it can
[1:28:26] change from it because he's infinite he
[1:28:29] can change from it he is God I can't I
[1:28:32] can change
[1:28:32] I'm a man you can change your man the
[1:28:36] woman but God cannot change

[1:35:32] Ministry of Christ and a form of paths
[1:35:34] that each apartment is for the perfect
[1:35:36] innocence and that is a revelation by
[1:35:38] itself you can't just say like them

[1:35:45] the perfect only saints for the work wor
[1:35:48] K and as a work not for the on the tone
[1:35:52] of the ministry for the work of the
[1:35:54] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[1:35:57] Christ till we all come so that all all
[1:36:03] come into the unity so we have to fit
[1:36:07] now all over but where is the unity of
[1:36:09] the faith so something after step power
[1:36:11] to bring about the unity
[1:36:13] of the faith but that faith has to be
[1:36:16] identified
[1:36:17] come on refriger to me preach back to me

[1:38:39] how to lead and he lead him all over to
[1:38:42] England there never was in England
[1:38:44] before they didn't notice the leader all
[1:38:47] ganda didn't know where he was going he
[1:38:51] in all time days he missed the boat and
[1:38:55] he took a whole bunch of geese to
[1:38:56] England they get lost across there he
[1:38:58] said now look they don't know how to get

[1:39:02] these geese I know you have a swarm big
[1:39:05] protracted meeting have some revivalist
[1:39:06] come along which a while and you don't
[1:39:08] know where you're going because you've
[1:39:10] got some gander to leave you off to
[1:39:12] something nominal spree and not back to
[1:39:15] the word and back to the baptism of the
[1:39:17] Holy Ghost
[1:39:18] Oh glory to God back to the world and he
[1:39:22] said if God give a duck enough sense to
[1:39:25] know how to dodge the coolness how or do
[1:39:28] you have to give the church if that duck
[1:39:30] by instinct know
[1:39:32] to talk coolness what about the holy was
[1:39:35] in the church it ought to lead us from
[1:39:38] all formalities and trees and things
[1:39:40] into a glorious wonderful baptism of the
[1:39:44] Holy Ghost that brings virtue and
[1:39:47] knowledge and patience and cloudiness
[1:39:50] and the Holy Ghost praise God hallelujah
[1:39:57] we are you are not in a Pentecostal
[1:40:00] church you are not in a Baptist Church

[1:40:05] to go in the rapture you're in a church
[1:40:11] such a good touch back transmitted
[1:40:13] because lain in the messages unless we
[1:40:16] preach the messages you will get the
[1:40:18] faith because mr. Miguel in the word and
[1:40:20] the last day there be a famine not for
[1:40:24] books and tips but for the darién not
[1:40:26] for presently the president pain
[1:40:28] everywhere but for the hearing of the
[1:40:31] true would have caught something that
[1:40:33] will quicken to you and inspire you out
[1:40:36] of what you in my god amen could we give
[1:40:39] the Lord a shout on that will be seated
[1:40:45] what a bantam said he could preach till
[1:40:47] all the here is that fall off unless it
[1:40:51] is inspired to you you will be in the
[1:40:54] same condition that is why the devil
[1:40:59] fight worship 5 the atmosphere because
[1:41:02] he don't got a nice red cup all your way
[1:41:04] except dongle a head go to work I want
[1:41:06] to win the reason you will not break in
[1:41:08] the spirit but i underscore its side I
[1:41:11] just let you know once I lie on I on the
[1:41:14] spirit side in case you didn't know no
[1:41:16] you know ok I'm not on the intellectual
[1:41:19] side it's a scheme sightedness message
[1:41:21] and intellectual side and the spirit
[1:41:23] side
[1:41:24] well deal on the spirit side or glory to
[1:41:27] God that is what I was built for on all
[1:41:31] the only Pharaoh's army built for that
[1:41:33] [Applause]
[1:41:38] now I am educated I know I'm not dumb I
[1:41:45] could use big words - plenty big words
[1:41:50] and no longer say that unlike I use one
[1:41:52] big wood you may see in there but I know
[1:42:01] this Glasper have to come alive and for
[1:42:05] the customers that come with signs and
[1:42:07] wonders this would have to become flesh
[1:42:08] for the invisible to become visible so
[1:42:12] we can't just be talking talking we have
[1:42:13] to see the walk of the talk we have to
[1:42:16] see this word from a line we can't talk
[1:42:18] about cross and a prophet and all the
[1:42:20] prophets and all he did this until just
[1:42:22] know you have to see it yourself you
[1:42:24] have to see the same Jesus present tense

[1:44:09] didn't like what they saw or what we
[1:44:11] need is the thunder of court walking and
[1:44:13] sweetness and holiness purity undefined

[2:23:29] want to think either be meaning apostle
[2:23:32] or mini this no no no mo many versions

[2:37:34] say we write at is wrong but the cup of
[2:37:36] perfection which is the power of love
[2:37:40] after come the seal the brand I was
[2:37:45] trying to wrap up here time is a long
[2:37:48] long time my voice hasn't gone like this
[2:37:50] but let me just continue here right now
[2:37:53] this water was stopped listen to what
[2:37:56] went on at a deeper level we know what
[2:37:58] one let me tell them they and so on but
[2:38:01] at a deeper level 1933 God gave but
[2:38:04] abandoned seven visions which he said
[2:38:06] must come to pass before Jesus come
[2:38:09] again the seventh vision is when America
[2:38:13] was bombed up we not even short of
[2:38:15] America making the Tribulation Period
[2:38:17] bombs all over America America destroyed
[2:38:21] listen to what he said the he said the
[2:38:25] world went to war 1914 never been peace
[2:38:28] peace since constantly swinging and
[2:38:30] swinging and swinging and they are doing
[2:38:31] it the very same thing yet
[2:38:33] and what was their doing talking about
[2:38:35] the injured whole then he said Oh God
[2:38:37] have mercy hold him that great thing
[2:38:40] that I saw in the vision the whole thing
[2:38:44] becomes the destruction wall in the
[2:38:46] atomic hole in the wars that they don't
[2:38:48] destroy themselves until the thing come
[2:38:51] to destroy it until is returns back and
[2:38:53] gets himself with together and then the
[2:38:56] message will go to Israel and she be
[2:38:57] sealed with the seal of the Holy Ghost
[2:38:59] after the Gentiles is called out the
[2:39:03] people for his name's sake will be
[2:39:04] called out which is this age right here
[2:39:07] now then Israel only receives a tree and
[2:39:09] a half and six-month message so Israel
[2:39:13] only Akira half years left for message
[2:39:17] with Moses Elijah those two lamps those
[2:39:20] two standing by the lamps those two
[2:39:23] trees it's not right more than Elijah
[2:39:25] just tree a half years for them the
[2:39:28] Gentiles you and I it is called the
[2:39:31] times of the Gentiles it is called until
[2:39:34] the fool
[2:39:34] of the Gentile come in we have no
[2:39:37] specific time the Bible talked about we
[2:39:39] call it the times of the Gentiles until
[2:39:41] the fullness of the Gentiles come in so
[2:39:44] in other words once this come in and the
[2:39:46] seal of God begin to be applied to your
[2:39:49] heart and life it is over this book is
[2:39:53] then closed so you don't have all the
[2:39:56] time to mix that because the slaughter
[2:40:00] in angel is next after the ink one
[2:40:03] writer went forth first with a
[2:40:05] commission to put a mark upon those
[2:40:09] hallelujah not upon those who say in the
[2:40:12] message not upon doors going to church
[2:40:14] doors have certain characteristics that
[2:40:18] scient I that means the burden go on
[2:40:21] beyond you
[2:40:22] it can be selfish for this thing you you
[2:40:26] see what is happening you know you need
[2:40:28] a manifestation of God you need a fire

[2:41:16] two men anointed with that spirit isn't
[2:41:21] that right and then about a third of the
[2:41:24] earth was blown to bits at that time
[2:41:27] until it of the earth shall be listen

[2:41:38] with the ink one writer was the Holy
[2:41:41] Ghost we realize everybody reads the
[2:41:45] Bible so is the same angel coming again

[2:51:51] strikes the power of God the baptism of
[2:51:54] the Holy Ghost out of the nominal
[2:51:56] churches it's normal us now out of the
[2:51:59] Catholic Church otama in a message now
[2:52:01] wherever it is when the baptism of the
[2:52:04] Holy Ghost is made real to the people
[2:52:06] when them that are predestinated like
[2:52:08] you people here they tell you life
[2:52:09] ceases and walks on it it's a super sign
[2:52:11] it has to be made real to you you mean
[2:52:15] this Holy Ghost
[2:52:16] yes for you to be baptized with the Holy
[2:52:19] Ghost yes you're not contented just to
[2:52:21] be the message no you want the real
[2:52:23] thing
[2:52:24] Oh glory to God and he promised we know
[2:52:27] that the scripture say that Jesus is the
[2:52:29] chief Cornerstone he also as a headstone
[2:52:31] now if we will remember that the 70s
[2:52:34] messenger was to restore the faith of
[2:52:36] the churun back to the father's in other
[2:52:38] words rebuild it again under the power
[2:52:40] of the Spirit Oh glory to God I wanna my
[2:52:45] good there are some prisons
[2:52:53] [Applause]
[2:52:55] whoo I know I jump in this listen to
[2:53:11] this
[2:53:11] no in this rupture in time there will
[2:53:15] come a time know that this bride Whittle
[2:53:20] that rejects the head part of the bride
[2:53:23] so it should be this church that rejects
[2:53:26] the head part of the bride will have to
[2:53:29] suffer for her rejection because the
[2:53:32] gospel wasn't made plain to them back
[2:53:33] there
[2:53:34] it's painful to you today see it was
[2:53:37] made clean you done all these years and
[2:53:39] examples the season so he's saying there
[2:53:42] will come a time when the head part will
[2:53:45] be rejected and the people that reject
[2:53:48] the head part will have to suffer the
[2:53:54] head part is the headstone the head part
[2:53:57] is the capstone the head path is a
[2:53:59] dynamics Jesus is the cornerstone he is
[2:54:02] also the headstone and he was a
[2:54:04] cornerstone of what the early church our
[2:54:06] church he comes to keep off the breath
[2:54:08] so therefore you have to go into the
[2:54:10] pyramid that your prayer may be capped
[2:54:12] off you yourself has to become a pyramid
[2:54:15] and he come into the cap to your pyramid
[2:54:17] the individual pyramid so you have a
[2:54:21] promise of him coming to you or glory to
[2:54:24] God quickly now
[2:54:26] after the brothers wrap that is a
[2:54:28] question answers will any of the foolish
[2:54:29] will be saved or we'll all be lost he
[2:54:32] said will the fully be saved no whatever
[2:54:35] happens no after that time she she fully
[2:54:40] version will have to go to the
[2:54:42] Tribulation Period and the reason for it
[2:54:45] is because she has rejected the
[2:54:48] atonement in its fullness
[2:54:50] and I was they believe pastor the
[2:54:52] message not all the message or glory
[2:54:55] record what she is a believer a
[2:54:58] professed believer but she will have to
[2:55:00] go through the tribulation period so you
[2:55:03] don't want to be a professor believer
[2:55:04] you want to be a believer with the proof
[2:55:06] possession not a believer with the
[2:55:09] profession did you get that you want to
[2:55:15] be a believer with the possession you
[2:55:18] actually have a possession not a
[2:55:22] profession
[2:55:22] Oh glory to God hallelujah my god here
[2:55:29] we go
[2:55:29] under the bomb I'm gonna close when the
[2:55:33] spirit falls not if Saul taught whether
[2:55:39] that mean it comin
[2:55:41] nobody can stop it if I die it's still
[2:55:45] coming all glory to God is this just
[2:55:47] fall apart and blow up it's still coming
[2:55:50] nothing gonna stop this when the spirit
[2:55:53] falls there will become a move amongst
[2:55:57] the people the bride had another revival
[2:56:03] yet there have been no manifestation of
[2:56:06] God to stir the bride he will send it he
[2:56:09] promised it the spirit will fall and
[2:56:12] cause a move among the people them
[2:56:19] denominations will swing together a
[2:56:21] certain as I am standing in the pulpit
[2:56:24] and the Church of God will be on stood
[2:56:27] they will make such a racket unclear
[2:56:30] they will Confederated I put a boycott
[2:56:33] on anybody that don't belong to them
[2:56:35] when Lazarus was raised from the dead
[2:56:37] you know what they say we have to stop
[2:56:40] this man the whole world going after him
[2:56:43] the miracles be from the small ones
[2:56:45] right up the Lazarus raised from the
[2:56:47] dead but that was the capstone
[2:56:48] manifestation of Jesus ministry which
[2:56:51] was a resurrection and everybody knew
[2:56:54] that Lazarus was raised from the dead
[2:56:56] that is when the Pharisees and the
[2:56:59] scribes and the Sadducees came together
[2:57:00] and
[2:57:01] this hydrant council to stop the word
[2:57:04] made flesh or glory regarding that same
[2:57:07] they're gonna happen when the holy
[2:57:09] spirit falls and the sons of God come at
[2:57:12] the manifestation or glory the court the
[2:57:14] church people in the message will reject
[2:57:17] the bright people in the message and
[2:57:19] then the government will come and sit on
[2:57:21] it or glory no God remember remember is
[2:57:25] not Caesar that condemned Jesus was the
[2:57:29] church folks that brought Jesus Jesus
[2:57:32] the Caesar and when they said this is
[2:57:35] your king to say no we have no king but
[2:57:37] Caesar
[2:57:37] they went political also or give the
[2:57:40] Lord a shout Oh hallelujah the religious
[2:57:44] folks condemn Jesus which was the word
[2:57:48] made manifest and what did the Prophet
[2:57:51] said I'm gonna close this then the phone
[2:57:57] fault with the man who was the word nor
[2:58:00] they gonna find fault but the word
[2:58:02] working to the man or glory to God so
[2:58:07] the prophecy hanging over your life is
[2:58:09] this word that you hear in all these
