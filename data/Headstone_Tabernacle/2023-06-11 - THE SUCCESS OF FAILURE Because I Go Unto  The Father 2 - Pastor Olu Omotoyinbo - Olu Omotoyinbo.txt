foreign [Music] Hallelujah amen God bless you remember all right today um I'm gonna be speaking on because I'm going to my father and try to finish that up and before I read my scriptures I wanted to just give you a very quick you know um summary of the matter which I did already last week but just a very brief scenario so um brother Branham let us understand that his ministry and we see that was the Holy Spirit in this day in this day and age and the Holy Spirit which when I understand um is the spirit of Jesus Christ and the spirit of Jesus Christ we start hearing about the spirit of God been called the holy spirit in so much the holy spirit in the New Testament but it's all been the spirit of God all throughout the Bible and um whatever God does he does it by his Spirit there is nothing he does that doesn't come by his spirit like I explained I mean a few times already the word of God is the spirit of God in what form God is a spirit and those who worship Him worship Him in spirit and in truth none of us can understand the things of his Spirit as human beings because they're spiritually discerned so God condescends in other words he comes a little lower to become the word so that we human beings who live in the realm of words can understand God but it's the spirit that's because that has become the world so man can understand not so animals can understand him but so the human beings can understand him and so that's what this whole program is about it's about the spirit of God when we speak in the world is the spirit of God Jesus said the words that are speaking to you their spirit and their life when you speak you are actually speaking out a spirit and that's what the Bible says death and life are in the power of the tongue when you are speaking you are either speaking death or you are speaking life and those number what those are the words of God and that's why we need to like learn to speak the word of God not speak our doubts not speak our fear but speak the truth of the word of God because the ones we speak the spirit and the life because God is a spirit and those who worship Him worship Him in spirit and in truth so when God created man that was spirit because God wants man to live in the spirit that's the only way you will make any real concert with God that's the essence of this year and then when you have the word of God like I'll I'll show you again in the message I say but I'll show you again the message today when you have the word of God it's great it's good but then what has to go back and turn back to the spirit again so that there can be a manifestation of all that God said the world will produce because Jesus said I come from God I am the word I come from the father that Spirit the father of spirits I become the world and I go back to God again it's not that he's going to go back and sit beside God no he's going to go back into the fatherhood the spirit form again in other words I come from how our spirit before Abraham was I am spirit I I come from the spirit to the world and I'm going back to street again and when I go back to speed again I will come again to you how as the spirit so that you can go back and pick up the program that was you know truncated by the devil in the Garden of Eden that's the story of redemption that's the whole message I'm preaching to you today amen let's turn to our faith and let's use the scriptures Isaiah 53 verses 1-12 in Matthew chapter 1 and verse 1 and then it's in John 14 verses 6 to 12. thank you Isaiah 53 and it was when recently slice who have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed the arm of the Lord is strength of God in other words the report has strength in it have you believed all the report we've been sharing with you amen and have you been finding some strength not just for your head for strength who has believed our report unto whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he speaking about the music I grew up before him as a tender plan and as a root of a dry ground he had no form no combeliness and when and and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he's despised and rejected of men The Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him people are embarrassed about Jesus Christ embarrassed about the gospel embarrassed about the message good for you he was despised and we esteemed him not the greatest of all creation the greatest of the greatest despised but didn't say I don't know who you're talking to no it is Nigeria don't even know who I am I didn't do anything he didn't say anything like that when you start sin don't you know who I am you have insecurities that's what it is who are you who are you who [Music] [Applause] but Christian's been going with insecurities those are the those are the those are the crosses say you are that Jesus has broken and delivered or strong amen all right surely was for all surely had borne our griefs because he hung on that calvary's cross and these were the things that he was bearing for you and I so there's no need to Bear any grief anymore no reason at all the problem is we don't believe the word I do that's the problem you don't know what happened to me sad things could happen bad things could happen but in the midst of that he can turn your your sadness into Joy he can give you the all of gladness for the spirit of mourning the Bible says amen amen surely you're born agrees on calvary's mountain and carried our sorrows what is making you sorrowful Jesus already carried it yet we did htme smitten smitten of God and afflicted he was wounded for our transgressions your sin sure you know you can't carry anything no more but people still claim Christ and live in sin sin oppresses them you don't own that sin no more [Applause] sin Shall Have No Dominion over you so if you are doing sin because you it's because you want to he was wonderful at transgressions it said in law that you don't punish for the same offense twice your sin Jesus has already taken the punishment for it legally the devil has no right no moral no spiritual no legal rights to put any sin any sickness any sorrow any sadness any grief any shame on you it doesn't have it he has it because you give it to him [Applause] all right he was running for transgressions he was Bruce for iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his tribes we are healed wow all we get like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all he took them all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth his brother as a lamb to the slaughter you maybe see that this is how he carried your sin you know too many times we say I didn't do that no Jesus didn't do a thing he didn't do any single thing that was put on him but we are so Buddha I want to justify I didn't do it I didn't do it they said it's not me I didn't do that many times it's not necessary brother Branham said many times the man who is making the accusation the person is making the attention is the guilty party so why do you bother yourself but one will be seen as clean I'm right I didn't do it my husband said I did it I didn't do it my wife said I didn't do that did you get it I didn't do it it's not necessary and if it's necessary do it in an atmosphere of Peace strive for the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace when conflict situations come let it be a branding and let there be peace strive for Unity in the born of peace [Applause] um verse um verse 7. he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened on his mouth defend himself because he has a purpose in taking all the sin and the sorrow and the shame that's the purpose and the purpose the garbage truck don't come when you throw all the garbage in it it's going to be thrown away into the garbage dump it doesn't belong in your home do you keep garbage in your home do you put garbage in the garbage truck and then they bring it back to your home no they bring it back to him he said no I paid for this take it away amen for the devil plays on our ignorance and our laziness many times because the symptoms are there because you still struggle doesn't mean that is not it for the devil will only train your resolve whether you believe or you whether you really believe or you are just hoping so hoping so won't get a thing from God brother Obama always said Do you believe with all your heart do you believe with all your heart do you believe with all your heart you get to believe in all your heart not a single doubt in place amen his brought us a lamb to the slaughter and as the ship before the sheraj is dumb so he opened us his mouth not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment taken from prison not just on our palator prison the devil thought I go on more to come down to me in hell in prison I got them now but he was taken from there Undeclared and brought about a new race of human beings a new generation and the Bible said here he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation the generation of Jesus Christ for it was caught out of the land of living for translation of my people was he stricken and in minutes grip with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any decision in his mouth yet he pleased the Lord to bruise him he had put him to grief when thou shall make his soul and offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see all the trouble of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge and and shall be satisfied and shall be sorry to abide his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many and he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I dividing a portion with a great and he shall divide the spar with the strong because he has poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bought the same of many and made intercession for the transgressors amen that's the whole crucifixion Story the death the barrier the the resurrection and Ascension of Jesus Christ right there so Matthew 1 and verse 1 the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham and fathers in John 14 and verse 6-12 I read the last week but that's where my context is from and Jesus said unto him verse 12 about six I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if he had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and I've seen him um Philip said unto him Lord she was the father and he suffice so fast at us in other words it satisfies it just show the father to us and Jesus said unto him have I been so long time with you and yet has thou not known me Philip he that has seen me had sinned the father and I'll see it thou then show us the father Believers thou know that I am in the father look at Jesus no nobody else spoke like this not the Pharisees not the Bishops not the Arabs nobody else spoke like this it took them to way back before The Phoenician of the war before Abraham was to them way back there nobody else speaks these things here not because we are proud We speak no the grace of God to you and I have to take you before the Friendship of War where real Victory comes from real Victory not just in church Victory on your job in life amen comes from everywhere victory in life to Reign on the earth they cried out we shall reign on the earth not in heaven on the Earth amen verse 10 Believers thou know that I am in the father and the father and me the words that I speak unto you um I speak not of myself but the father that dwells in me he doeth the works in other words the father in me is one speaking the words and the words turn to the works the word and the spirit the spirit and the world because they're one on the same thing the father and the son the Son and the father amen the Father the Son and the Father the father and the son The Ward and the spirit of speed on the world you cannot separate them you can claim the world and live a life In the Flesh you can't you cannot verse 11 believe me that I'm in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sick very very either believeth in me the work that I do shall I do also and Greater Works than this shall he do because I go unto my father Greater Works imparting eternal life whosoever since you remit they're admitted whosoever sins you return they're written in patent eternal life during the Greater Works amen amen Lord she bless you all right musicians he left already okay all right not a problem that's fine nice one or when are you there at first are you upstairs okay all right that was increasing him by the way yeah you're singing good like me [Applause] that was really great singing many people you know brother Markley was a song leader you know I'm only one on nature chart with Linux Church years ago before many of you were born before I think even before maybe only ordnell and Gideon were born at the time so definitely J Hill wasn't born so so um so that was a really good thing and we're singing and invest to the lamb for Redemption amen all right so because I've gone to my father and they the because is the operating water because it shows you something because of something something else follows happened so um so our focus is what happened after he went to his father what's that telling us um um when God created man you and I know that you know the story brother Branham let us know the story and like I see all the time and I'm not seeing that you know you not hear these things from a Pentecostal Church even if they've read the message unless you receive that profit you're not like it you'll be able to you know I'll be very clear understanding of what it is because you still have your own thoughts I don't really think it's right on this and all that but when you're sold out then dementia opens up to you get no problem actually because you are you are you know whatever you know it doesn't got us in any one of us we need him so anyway so God wanted to have a line a Godly line image after our likeness to be like us and represent us on the face then go you know be the lineage of God the generation of God and that was what he did in Adam until the fall and that generation received a curse right there the cost of sin and from the sin came sickness disease and death the sin was spiritual death happened they died on the spot just like God said but it also led to sickness disease and we already explained over and over in the past how the sin led to the disease and then the disease led to the death physical death The Last Enemy so that generation died died right there but then that's how we all still came in the world because at that fall a new bloodline was introduced that's the thing about this happens it's the introduction of another bloodline that's not the generation of God and we were all born in that because it's it's human nature we said in the past the devil made sure that the four that every man born of woman was gonna come with this nature not not escaping it the only way you are going to escape is that you're not going to be born through regular natural birth and that's what Jesus bypassed in the virgin birth no instrumentality of man at all just God God himself doing his thing by passing The Devil's Thinking by passing The Devil's plan by fighting what the devil thought he had cooked and he had got us into a into a rabbit hole from the Fallen Eden God bypassed it wasn't born by anything nothing from Mary nothing from from Joseph nothing from any man Mary was just an incubator Mary did not supply the egg it was the spirit of God that he said that holy sin which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of the most high that was God very God that came from the womb of Mary that's why it was called the seed of the woman amen amen the woman just incubating God Amen and so is 10 another generation a spiritual generation amen the generation of Jesus Christ so you are either here today in the generation of Adam or in the generation of Jesus Christ and thank God the generation of Adam is filled with curses the curse of sin disease death everything in your lineage Every curse you can think of Shame sorrow poverty lack insecurities all those curses just there generational stretch it right back to your father's house right down to your father Adam but then here come Jesus the seat of the woman the opportunity to have another lineage and be a point another generation that traces is its Origins brought back to David to Abraham right straight to the man of God amen oh my glory to God amen so quickly let's trace and compare the junction of Adam and the generation of Jesus Christ [Music] repeatedly over and over is like Adam's birth in time judges 128 and Genesis 2 7 is like Adam's birth in time and like a child is born that's what it was for Adam so Adam's in time is recorded in those verses James 1 26 28 was the Inner Man the soul of Adam which was a portion of the spirit of God a portion of God was the soul of Adam and in there was where Adam was made a spirit man because the spirit of God and his Spirit man means he was living in the spirit of God and then the outer man Genesis 2 7 was the Flesh of Adam where he the spirit of God on the inside of him walked out through his flesh so he'll walk in the spirit he lived in the spirit and he saw a life in there and when he was placed in flesh he also that Spirit on him the flesh did nothing they fled just just was just like a a a um an incubator to carry the spirit the flesh just followed what the spirit on the inside did so he lived in the spirit and walked in the spirit amen and was the spirit of God amen so that lets you and I know there's an inner Game of Life and there's an outer game of life but you know put them together if you want to walk with God amen everyone who succeed have really great success in any area of your life at all and I I preach because I believe the gospel is catered to the total man Spirit soul body for all of life and godliness if you want to be really have great success in any area of your life at all in your walk with God in your work in the natural amen you've got to understand where the spirit of God must give you victory in the in the Game of Life because the body in a game and out again when I'm saying game I don't mean soccer just a language to understand that there's an inner thing going on and you got to overcome and live uh in Victory in there because you must win in the inner game first or you cannot win in the outer game let me put it another way you must win in the inner game to stand any chance at all or winning in the outer game because like I've said to you over and over and over so many years by said in the last one year and the course of this series of messages the inner man is a million times more powerful than the outer man a million times more powerful and that's not me saying that go and go and do the research the inner man this subconscious man is a million times more powerful than the outside man amen so to win at all on the external you're gonna win in the internal first and that's why the Bible encourages us to focus on the inner man not on the outer man the ottoman has no choice if whatever is just follow if good is an inner man the ottoman will be good if if if God is an inner man the ottoman will be bad and that's why it tells us to get our heart with all diligence for we come all the things that control and guard your life the issues of life amen so the Inner Man where is it coming from where is it coming from where is this powerful in a man coming from was this powerful inner game coming from verse a million times more powerful than the outer man well you know the story Elohim Elohim before The Phoenician of The World God a spirit had thoughts on his mind that lets you understand right away those thoughts were spirit [Music] [Applause] and you were in the thoughts in his thinking brother banam told us that where else you hear that from where else you hear that from take it to the real origins of the foundation of Faith your Origins Charles Darwin talks about the origin of the species know the origin of life itself is not in amoeba the origin of life this way back to the mind of God before the foundation of the world and there you were as a little thought in God's mind amen I'm trying to show you where where where the inner life of power comes from amen and Elohim like our X-Men over and over also wanting to do this so that he will have sons and daughters who will be like him who will represent him on the face of the Earth because God is the god of the universe but he wants his sons and daughters who have been his name to be the gods of the Earth To Rule and Reign on the earth in his favor the Christians are so focused on going heaven and they are not focused on living on the earth here for us you can't jump off the Earth on the earth yellow on the earth we have got to represent Jesus Christ in every single way before we go to heaven and even when we get heaven we come back on the earth and live on this Earth here forever amen amen it's going to be a new city a New Jerusalem it's gonna be on the earth we shall reign on the earth can you say Amen Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] so Elohim knowing that he's gonna Christians and daughters who are going to operate in the realm of words he started to form himself towards flesh in a theophany he became the word so he came from Elohim to the theophany the world and the thought of you in Elohim became a seed in the word and the spoken word is the original Sage [Applause] death and life are in the power of the tongue where did the seed come from from your words that come from your mouth you'll speak the words for death or life and out of those out of those words from the Seas and from the fruit of death and life I can I will I do believe how I have no idea but I can I will I do believe the Bible tells me so the Bible tells me so halia don't don't tell me your your unbelief and your dad I don't want to hear it the Bible tells me so [Applause] you've been saying that for 40 years that's why it does not 40 years I will keep saying it years is Target North the Bible tells me so yes Jesus loves me I don't have to feel it the Bible tells me so Hallelujah I shall be baptize the Holy Ghost on Fire I don't have to feel it the Bible tells me so I shall be healed of every ailment I don't have to feel it the Bible tells me so the Bible tells me it's all amen [Applause] so they thought of you Amen brother the thought of you became your the thought of you in Elohim make him your Washington the logos you maybe see that follow your own Journey now follow your journey [Applause] or you thought oh your genealogy started from your great great grandfather in your village somewhere no no you can trace that 400 years no eternity pass that's where you come from a little thought in Elohim thinking and is thinking that sounds common to you right now but that's the truth that's where you come from Hallelujah you may be seated amen and in the logos Elohim is seven spirits and you exceed a little thought in his mind and in the logos you became a little seed and each of the seeds of Elohim was had a portion of Elohim in them seven spirits because Elohim is seven spirits is image and if you're a seed of God in Elohim in the logos where you are a seed in your seed your DNA from God was seven spirits just like God [Applause] so we can put a picture up here and say Elohim thoughts logos seeds in him and every seed was like a little button seven spirits seven spirits seven spirits and all of those Spirits had different names on them Hallelujah one seed was Adam once it was Paul once it was Abraham once it was amen once it was William Branham once it was Paul Hallelujah once it was you that's why you Heaven spirits of God but for the foundation of the world that's why the Holy Spirit rocks you to shake you back in those seven spirits of God because that's who you are that's where you come from Hallelujah you maybe see that excuse me [Applause] Glory [Applause] so that's right I like that that's right never will speak is that's why is that what's that oh notice no you are Nigerians I want to know the race was it was it was it what tribe is that what language is that foreign [Applause] [Applause] so what it is this is where this is where you are a a what city the logos that's what the worship was seven spirits that's had your name on it that's what the Bible said whom he did for no [Applause] and he said Romans 8 for whom he called he justified whom he justified no no I'll jump ahead student for whom he did for no then he then he called whom he called he justified whom he justified he already glorified that what that there might be conformed to the image of his son to be in the image of the logos God on the face of the Earth and Adam was the first one he plugged Adam out and put a seat in his soul in the Garden of Eden seven spirits seven perfect thundering Spirits in Adam's soul in the Garden of Eden the perfect man was born on the face of the Earth if I knew Adam he called him he justified him he glorified him and Adam came here glorified adopted son of God a perfect man standing on the face of the Earth with four and nine Authority and power thus said the Lord keep Shield the generation of Adam was in full swing who's gonna stop it what devil what spiritual stop it [Music] Hallelujah [Applause] we're talking about the birth of Adam so I Elohim took these seven spirits the Adam seed brother said who is in my case like maybe seated you come like Adam you come like me so we come exactly like Adam came and Adam's seed was in the logos seven spirits and he took Adam seed out and put in the soul seven spirits seven spirits in his soul and Adam lived in the spirit it was in charge the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen making Adam a son of God the god of the the spirit of God lived in his soul Adam lived in the spirit by the battle of the Holy Ghost in type birth in him giving him a birth into the kingdom of God Hallelujah Adam's children his soul was seven spirits in his soul seven spirit in his soul Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness the stature of Jesus Christ amen and that's what he was that's the spirit man of Adam was every man is a spiritual being but some men have in addition to the spirit the soul they have the seed of God in there that's Adam's generation So Adam was a spirit man with seven spirits in his soul farming him conforming him into the image of the Son of God Amen that he might be conformed to the image of a Son of God the son of God Spirit Son of God Elohim spirit is spirit Spirit Son of God with theophany and but that son had a body so his Spirit son with a what Body Spirit word body the Son of God the theophany amen which became Jesus Christ suggestions 1 26 28 again I say was the birth of Adam in time representing the four meaning of the word image in him conformed become formed god plain on the words that we might be conformed to the image of his son become that we might be conformed be conformed into the image of his son and Adam was become formed into the image of God's son the logos the theophany god represented on the Earth by the man Adam that was his birth that was living in that was Adam lived in the spirit the spirit of God baptizing his soul were the seven spirits of God seven spirits from the Adam into the water image a perfect man standing the face of the Earth with the word image he was fruitful he multiplied he could replenish his subdued and he was in Absolute Total Dominion even in his soul in his inner life the inner came was one of Dominion amen that's why Jesus told them you will feel the deadly supporters you garnish it on the outside and on the inside you are full of potrifying souls brother baptism cleans that up and fish with a sweet s Maryland several of the Holy Ghost from the inside so the water image the Seventh Street in his soul the image let's make God in our own image that's the word image the image of God the word the theophany the seven the the the the spirit Son of God the seven spirits with the word image Adam reigned on the Earth he was a leader last Sunday God's program is to make you a leader between in school [Applause] you may not understand or believe that that's fine but that's what the gospel is God made man the leader of his creation yeah very well so your very essence of being a Christian is to be trained to be a leader sure you the husband is a leader to his family the mother's related to our children the big brother is the leader to the Young Brother the big sister is a leader to the young sister that's God's plan for leadership this is leadership training school that's why we come to church [Applause] amen and so Adam with the word imagine him he reigned in life in the Inner Man he was a leader and brother said that Adam in the spirit he let the animals about in the spirit he has so much Plan Authority he led the animals about before he was even put before this what image was put into his flesh he has so much Plan Authority as a leader on the earth to lead even the animals about there was no wife nobody else him alone amen So Adam he won in the inner game like I said again you gotta win in the inner game is a prerequisite to stand a chance at all to winning in the outer Game of Life is a prerequisite and then Genesis 2 7. all of these here these what he made was anointed into his flesh so where is this in a game coming from from God from God the Eternal the supernatural the one who created the world by his word the word who created the one who of whom he was said and he is before all things and without him was not anything made that was made the Creator who created the Angels who couldn't Lucifer who created everything there is Hallelujah and even before but before I say other question you were there you already there stop biting your nails whether you button your nails for Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah amen Hallelujah so when Adam God placed this word image and anointed into his flesh because he's going to live in the flesh on the face of the Earth showing the spirit he contacts the spiritual world but in the flesh he's gonna live on the face of the Earth he needs flesh to live on the face of the Earth you can go to walk in your spirit you've got to put some flesh on spiritual gotta balance it up let it be the spirit coming out on the outside amen temper down by the radius that you are living in a physical world amen I don't want to get into that amen So Adam was present flesh and when it was leading flesh you begin to walk in the spirit living the spirit walking this way how was he walking the spirit the spirit the water image was in his flesh so the word image used his flesh body to walk the spirit who you can see used Adam's flesh body to walk to walk around amen does that make sense amen oh my God how was the what image anointed into his flesh how we say that all the time by the Breath of Life say God formed man out of the doors of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life which is the Breath of God which is the spirit of God which is not amoya which is God's Own Holy Spirit with Britain at Birth the fall made that but original plan God's breath Breathe on Me Breath of God breathe on me that I may never die Breathe on Me Breath of God Breathe on Me [Applause] listen Adam said I was one image anointing to his flesh by the breath of life which is the Breath of God which is the spirit of God which represents today the true baptism of the holy spirit amen anointed the word into his flesh sure the word image was on the inside but it needs to be on the Flesh on the outside for him to become the world made flesh the word image on the inside good boy needs to come in the flesh and the spirit of God that's why even out here you have been formed into the water image you are going to need the spirit of God are the true baptism of the Holy Ghost to anoint the word on the inside of you into your flesh and then you become the one may flesh your tongue becomes the wall your hands becomes the word you would lay hands on the sick verse the sick cannot stay sick your speak demons cannot stay how your custard Devils they gotta go they've got to go right now we pray sometimes those devils are stubborn right now we pray amen and your sickness sounds to stay there and you think he's not gone those devils are stubborn but that time when you become the what made flesh you don't have to to lay hands on the sick you speak the word and the demons scattered the scatter and run for their life when aware we are on our way glory glory to God hallelujah amen you maybe see that amen [Applause] so the Breath of God Genesis 2 7 anointed the spirit of God into Adam's flesh and the spirit of God and the Flesh of Man became United amen God became United in a body of Flesh and Adam became the word made flesh living in the spirit walking in the spirit Hallelujah walk in the spirit just like it they did in this just like he did living in the spirit walk in the spirit he was foot full multiplied replenished subdue than he was in Absolute Total dominant over everything on the face over there that was God on the face of the Earth that's God's plan that's original original plan oh Hallelujah Adam reigned on the Earth In the Flesh as he had done in the soul living in the spirit what was that success adoption time people think Christianity is to take success away from them no you are wrong because you never you never had the gospel right you you have the gospel too spiritualized the gospel was not sent for Angels who live in heaven were sent for human beings who live on the face of the Earth who have got to function on the face of the Earth who have gone who have got to go to school get a walk go feed their families and the Bible actually said if you are not able to feed your family you are worse than Infidel and you'll bring shame on the faith that's who the gospel was for so enough of this over spiritualized of everything but let me leave that alone we'll get back to it amen amen [Music] thank you the baptism of the Holy Ghost in time was God's formula for success for Adam you know Nigeria Expo is a formula for success cheating really that formula for success but in God's Kingdom the Holy Spirit is the formula for Success let me tell you young and a young woman you need the Holy Spirit not because you want to get to heaven because you

Flesh and you have come here adopted a grown-up fully grown up Son of God like Adam we taught her Dominion on the face of the year that was God's original plan that was a generation God that's a generation God wanted amen and so Adam lived until the fall and therefore this order was reversed the devil's plan reverse the other he's he's a thief he comes to do nothing but to steal kill destroy he has nothing original just see the one and then change it that's how some people are they don't some people are like that it's not God's spirit God's spirit is agreeable not because you agree with everything somebody said no you look for areas of agreement River can two work together except they agree no but some we share this here they look even when you don't agree wisdom says that I don't agree with that thing I said but how can I come across as agreeable so that we can reason together let me leave that alone I go and then and I don't get my message [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but

amen so remember your prayer especially and you know you could see the spirit is moving in a powerful way nobody will stop it now go to move all things from away from you to make sure you get what you're supposed to get this is a critical season this is this is me long for all these years we come up to this great climax when when God called Israel after Egypt it wasn't the Platinum of any wilderness also bring them to the promised land the willingness was just a journey the objective was to get them to the mountain to worship God nothing was supposed to stop no Red Sea no Bandit no no Pharaoh no Horseman nothing at all so that's why Moses was so anointed to bring the people out but those two thousand million two million people died they died because of unbelief they die because when they come so close up they decide to go back in negatives and all like my atmosphere I recall regards of what you've gone through you heard what brother will preach the gene that God put in you was before the function of the world God is not now picking you because you have good behavior now today and you had bad Beaver last night and last week it's not no God choose you you know he chooses it before the function of the world we are all bad we're all born in sin shape iniquity we come under the lineage of Adam's generation of Adam but not as a new generation the generation of Jesus Christ that brought this Blood this Blood this blood and come back to blood to bring a breakthrough for you it's not what you do or you don't do it's you accepting what the blood has done for you and you plugging into the blood and getting power from the blood getting life from the blood getting strength from the blood getting the anointing from the blood it's not your power it's not your anointing it's his power it's his anointed it's not my mind not by power it's his spirit [Music] sideway came before yesterday get back up go sit down get back up I don't care what happened get back up get back on track get back in step that's the burden of God to get back a church in order so you think if God take on all our problems all our lineage and whatever grandfather do and great grandfather and great grandfather we even know what you do and we find ourselves in some some kind of issue the blood comes the correct all of that we're not psychologists to go back in the history of your life and your past in a generation there's a new generation because there's a blood a fresh blood the generation of Jesus Christ they can't go back to a natural lineage they have to go back to the brother Jesus Christ that cleanses us all from sin Oh Glory according to treat people as a forgiven sinner or give the Lord some praises then the Lord I shout in the house not some self-righteous Rascal but they treat people as a forgiven sinner knowing God has pardon you and I've forgiven you and as God give you Grace you can extend that Grace to others oh could we give the Lord a shouting her Hallelujah so you don't have that right to look into this one so and I won't show and you find soul and you saw when you're judging all kind of things so don't do that thank God for the blood that gives you opportunity thank you for pardoning me thank you for your grace thank you for your blood thank you for your mercy and I'm praying for my brother and I'm praying for my sister you gotta call you the judge people in a kind of a way where you for myself righteous thrown Jesus will beat them fast and say Hypocrites your streamers are nothing swallow a camel your own eye and then you'll see clearly to take out the little speck in somebody's eye Hallelujah you want that kind of attitude not Pride not arrogance not because you're no more you're this you're that and and who falls and who this and that no don't go there once we were false once we were Sinners once we were slaves but God choose to give us an opportunity to go free it's your choice God's Not Gonna Force you you could stay in your unbelief if you want to stay in the Sin if you want to but you can also stay choose to get out foolish or in ignorance you can get wisdom you can get knowledge you could get Faith you can get virtue you can get Temperance you can get patience you could get godliness you could get bodily kindness these things is achievable he can't call us for Perfection and don't make a way for faith he can't call you to overcome and don't make a way to overcome you can call us a victory and don't make a way for that once he calls to that it means that is possible we have to continue in that work amen amen amen didn't mean to say all those things but bye what anointing here today oh we're just grateful to God the youth unions are asked to stay back directly after service they'll start choir
