this morning from inside of you oh hallelujah [Applause] [Music] oh oh [Music] oh oh foreign [Applause] [Applause] oh one more time we'll walk [Applause] oh [Applause] how would i be [Music] may the lord bless you [Music] an empty space oh [Music] you see amazing grace [Laughter] where would i be oh so give him praise this morning hallelujah thank you lord jesus glory to god oh praise the lord let's put his word a prayer almighty god truly where would we be but for grace we thank you for your love we thank you for your comfort we thank you for your blood we thank you for extending mercy to us grace to us your love to us and so lord we want to be able to extend to others father may come on a special way and speak to our hearts we wait on you lord god we are needy people are we are desperate and hungry for you we are thirsty for you lord we want to be changed we want to be transformed we want to be made ready what's the use of coming to church if we're not going to be ready help us and prepare us this morning in jesus name we ask it amen why do you turn around and greet somebody in jesus name [Music] through eyes [Music] you may be seated praise god it's great to be back home [Applause] and i guess one of these days when we get back when we get back to where we came from you would see it's good to be back home and i could see the heavenly father saying welcome home my children oh what a deed i'm going to do yeah [Applause] greetings from germany so what was in germany meeting with a whole new crop of believers and ministers and to see and experience such fine christian spirit now i i believe in my heart that many people have gotten away from this christian moorings and spirit somewhere along the line it has become so arrogant and pufter and i will say this to you and those who may hear this message if you are up there wherever up there is or you are higher than i wherever higher than i is or you are tall and powerful and mighty the question is how did you get up there how did you get up there now if god's grace put you up there what right or authority do you have to kick somebody in their face who is down there or below where you are so i want you to know we are where we are and we are what we are by the grace of god [Applause] hallelujah you know by ram says god is looking for somebody anybody that the more he blesses is the more humble it becomes because usually that's the norm usually when people get blessed they get puffed up as they know so it's very rare to see somebody where god points on them and they become like a channel of god's blessing they're not stinging and that means they're not clogged up they're like a vessel that god could just shh and save others and bless others and anoint others and help us and pull us up others and encourage others that's what god is looking for the politics is crazy right now in the world today there are wars and they're going to be more wars and more not just rumors of wars things will begin to take place it's going to get worse and worse why you are in church cherish the time take hold of the moment let your faith rise to to believe god for all things it will take more than sitting in church to get out of here it will take the supernatural not natural supernatural and that is what we're coming into this morning into the supernatural so could we stand this time as you want to sing i love him i love him because he first loved me [Music] he calls [Music] thank you jesus [Applause] one time [Music] he said the atmosphere was right he said things he said he can't see again it was just a right atmosphere to say those things they take the right atmosphere for things to really come out one thing we do know the walls are going to come down the walls that ministers bill interpretation bills men ideas bill it's going to come down but branham said god people will gather together hallelujah it may take persecution it may take pressure but they will gather together oh hallelujah praise god there'll be one more ride and the holy ghost himself is going to be in charge of that right so this morning thank you musicians we have three portions of scriptures we'd like to look at joshua chapter 13 one first verse one ephesians chapter 1 verse 3 to 5 and 2nd peter 1 verse 1 to 12. the title of the message this morning is by these precious revealed promises the subject is partakers of his divine nature and the inspiration is possessing your individual inheritance and i do have a context scripture from joshua 14 we'll sit down after and you'll read but let's turn to joshua chapter 13 and we want to read first one there now joshua was old and stricken in years and the lord said unto him thou art old and strict knit years and they remained yet very much land to be possessed ephesians 1 3-5 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ what blessed us with all spiritual blessings and heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will i'll read in second peter reading verse 1 to 12 simon peter a servant an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us to the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus oh lord according as his divine power here we go had given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding let's read that verse four together whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in this world through lust and besides just giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge and to knowledge temperance and the temperance patience and the patience godliness unto godliness brotherly kindness and to broadly kindness charity for if these things be in you and are bound they make you that you shall neither be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind cannot see a fire off and had forgotten that he was pushed from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and he established in the present truth let's pray one more time father we thank you for your word interpreted to our heart made a pillar of fire come lord and rest on my shoulder and speak out to your people may they hear diarrhea from god this morning in jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise god we say the title is by these precious promises and the subject partakers of his divine nature and inspiration possessing your individual inheritance now for that i have the context scripture of joshua chapter 14 i want to read from verse 6 to 14. then the churn of judah came to joshua and igual and caleb the son of jeffernaire the kazanite said unto him dawn was the thing that the lord said unto moses the man of god concerning me and thee in kinish baniya forty years old was i when moses is the servant of the lord sent me from kenish bhania to his foul the land and i brought him word again as it was in my heart it has to be in your heart not your head it's got to be in your heart to bring a word nevertheless my brethren and that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but i wholly followed the lord my god and moses swear on that day saying surely the land where on thy feet of trodden shall be done inheritance and thy children's forever because thou has holy followed the lord my god and now behold the lord had kept me alive these forty and five years even since the lord spake his word unto moses while the children of israel won in the wilderness and now lo i am this day four score and five years old as yet i am strong this day as i was in the day that moses sent me as my strength was then so is my strength now for war but to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain where of the lord spake in that day for thou heard us in that day how the anakims were there the cities were great on fence if so be the lord be with me i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said and the joshua blessed him and gave unto caleb the son of jeffree hebron for an inheritance hebrew and therefore became the inheritance of caleb the son of jeffernaire the kazanite unto this day because he wholly followed the lord god of israel may god bless his holy word o praise god may we give the lord some praising [Applause] i would like to be northern age than this age this is the closing age this is the closing of time we are honored to be in this age many wise men and prophets would have longed to be in his age this having this eighth of the pressure and all the thunder you had the face all the pressures you have to face this is this age all the temptations all these trials all what the devil could put out this is his eden we are in satan's eden oh hallelujah and god promised to take a bride out of satan's eden or even go to the corner of the earth to find you he will go to your street and knock on your door to find you you cannot escape hallelujah are you not seeking him he is seeking you out praise god after this service your life will not be the same glory to god something going to take place in your life let me prophesy over you this morning glory to god this is not a normal service there's an unusual service there's a life-changing service you are going to be a partaker of his divine nature glory you're going to eat out of it you're going to receive it you're going to apply it it will be part of your system oh give the lord some praise these people hallelujah hallelujah glory you may be seated the bible said if any man be in christ he's a new creator oh glory to god you're singing the same old body same old face same old eye but a brand new you because there's an inside man inside that man come on shame as somebody there's a man inside that man oh hallelujah glory to god second timothy 16 second timothy 3 16 says all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness and the amplified of that scripture says every scripture is god breathe it is given by his inspiration and profitable for instruction for reproof for conviction of sin for correction of error and discipline in obedience and for training in righteousness in holy living in conformity to god's will in thought purpose and action hallelujah all scripture is god breathed god breathed upon it hallelujah that's why you can say my word shall not return unto me void because the breath of god is on every scripture holy men moved by the holy ghost holy men move by the holy ghost holy man moved by the spirit of the living god oh hallelujah we're not here to entertain you we're here to bring you a word from the lord oh glory to god oh my certainly enjoyed by the georgetown testimony he came and put a level on top of the process and he had a whistle at this side he said the level is to keep things level and the whistle is to blow when people falling asleep and he used it see you there [Music] so i think i'll get a whistle they can't believe you have the level okay now the bible talk about i write in you children i ranted to you young men and i write unto you fathers god's objective is to get us to christian maturity where we can handle god's stuff you can't give an inheritance to a child the bible said if the child is the heir even if the child is the heir he has to be on the tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father hallelujah you know what the guy bolt bullet the guy who win the the race i heard something from him and he said the race is the easiest part that's the easiest part to run the race that's the easiest part he said the path that he's had is the training that he has to go through every day hallelujah every day to run for nine point something seconds hallelujah and we have a race to run and we have a way to run and we have to run this with patience this race [Applause] that is set before us hallelujah keep on running brother it's not a sprint it's a long distance race it's not those who start it's those who finish is he that endure to the end oh give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah glory so therefore god's objectives is to bring you into a place of trying that is your behavior your chastisement you're writing you're maturing you're getting right in listening to preachers preaching in church you get ripened by your tests by your upsets by your disappointments by your prey all night your weep all night by the pain you get in the belly that's what you that's what does something to you god took away the prophet's wife took away the prophet's daughter and he was just testing him hallelujah because it is your behavior that sets you out to adoption everybody claimed to be christians everybody claimed to be born again and to be god's children but the bible said try the spirits to see if it is of god hallelujah try them by what by virtue by knowledge by temperance by patience by godliness my brotherly kindness is not i trying you the spirit's gonna try you because what's inside you are gonna speak for itself oh hallelujah glory hallelujah so when the pillar of fire the dove came upon jesus he got power amen but god couldn't say hearing him yet god gave him power and he had to prove himself so the spirit led jesus into the wilderness to overcome the lust of the eyes to overcome the lust of the flesh to overcome the pride of life and he told that all devil it's written it's written it is also written and jesus overcome by the word so that first anointing or power or presence came to position him as a son amen but then he ought to be tested and then afterwards god take him aside onto a mountain isn't that right he had to be tried isn't that right because god can't give you power yet you have to test it first you can't give your full power give you a little taste and pull it off you have to be able to climb up the ladder you have to remove the activated virtual knowledge because power without character is satanic and characters that the gift character is a victory a lot of people don't know that character is when you leave here and you deal with your issues when you leave here and you deal with your philistines your goliath your problems and you handle it and you're overcome then character to be formed in you then god could do something with you because you're not sitting on the premises you are standing on the promises these precious revealed promises oh can we hear the lord some praise his people do you believe he's this word now hallelujah hallelujah so in 1946 to be angela on all right empower him but though god didn't only empower him it had others like all robots until i was born in different ones they all had power they all were doing signs and wonders but guess what only one was adopted oh give the lord a shout in the house give the lord a shout all that signs and wonders and all that crippled walking dead reason demon casting out but when come to adoption time when come to hearing him one man stood out one man was different one man had character one man god said here he him [Applause] oh give the lord some praises people [Applause] from hearing him amen now jesus there we go had proven to god that he's been the right kind of a son i'm a son i'm a son of god you know i hope you are back sitting here i'm a son you know i need backslidden as ever i like him god owe them they're on their way to hell and talk about their son their son [Music] god called you out to put you in it's not good to come out of baptist methodist of good religions it's not good to come out only you've got to go in this is to put you in there's nothing i believe brother branham believe the message that's not this is not that you know we had it for 50 years this is if you want to be changed if you want to be listen listen if you want to be a partaker of his divine nature then what he has become yours did you hear that then what he has become yours so cuspard peter denying peter peter says i don't know that man when that divine nature became his own he said silver and gold i don't have but such as i have i give i give because i got it to give it okay the lord our praise [Applause] now this is not mystery preaching you know some people make the message so mysterious there's not mystery mystery preaching you know now this is the mystery this year christ is the mystery of god revealed every time the mystery come out it reduces produces christ christ in the minister christ and the elder christ and the deacon christ and the usher christ and the church member you live in a christian life not a mean evil wicked spirited life no not in your carnal life no not your natural life but a spirit given life [Applause] jesus god took him up the mountain brought witnesses out there heavenly witnesses and he was clothing with immortality and they looked up and said his garment shine like the sun a supernatural something take place was no book was not reader tape and it sounds good and the only lord show me wasn't that something took place hallelujah a supernatural something took place and his garment glistened and got placed on him the robe of immortality showing that he had received them are you ready let's go that's the thing that god will do to his sons here on earth someday he will call you a side church if you will only obey him and stay on the word and believe it he will place into the church before the coming of jesus all the powers that christ had in him will be in the church hallelujah could i hear a shout on that not some of his powers shout and say all right a bigger one oh one more time or all the powers that christ had oh god retired as sick people staying sick oh yes retire retire tired of sick people oh glory to god the sick's got to be healed [Applause] but branham says we pray for them now when that time come we command it we pray for some some get healed some don't get healed but when that time come all getting healed [Applause] did you hear what i just said [Applause] all the power that christ had would be in the church all gonna be healed not even cancer not even cancer going to stand before the power that's gonna be in the church do you feel it you sons of god do you sense a few sons of god you daughters of god you may be seated notice the bible said these signs shall follow ministers that believe he said these signs shall follow them oh give the lord a shout are you one of them come on now are you one of them these signs shall follow them are you one of them give the lord a shout on that i say you are one of them [Applause] all that god was he poured into jesus all that jesus was he pours into the church god wanted his work done he sent it to his son the son wants his work done sent it into the church at that day you will know that i am in the father the father in me i in you and you and me at that day because the same power that was in jehovah god rest in jesus christ and the same power that rest in jesus christ rest in place sons [Applause] did you hear that there is no mistake about that not sons pleased pleased pleased please [Applause] when moses died god didn't waste time i had a morning ceremony for moses he held on joshua he said joshua moses my servant is dead now rise up cross them over take them across draw them divide for them and inheritance oh you're not hearing me this morning you're going to hear me this morning the church is matching on the truth is matching on [Applause] you may be seated when they were in egypt they were the people of god when they were called out they become the church of god god objective wasn't the kingdom in egypt egypt was bondage god objective wasn't the rain mannering them along the wilderness journey the wilderness was just a journey the destination was canaan the destination was the promise it was a promised land by these promises by these promises precious promises god i'm a good god i have a land flowing with milk and honey it's our faith in it it has virtue in it it has knowledge in it it has godliness in it if i probably kindness in it there's a good land i want you to partake of this land [Applause] he is bringing you out he is bringing you out [Applause] let me caution you one time when you feel the world of the spirit of god around you respond react do something raise your hands shake your head do a spin around stand up and sit back down but don't just look people miss the healing people miss the blessing by not responding we are not come to read a magazine for you we come to bring dusty at the lord glory to god hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] like esther if i perish or perish but i'm going in i'm going in this morning got to go in this morning [Applause] hallelujah listen when you're pointing in the right direction the prophecy you could be reckless let your faith get reckless mankind help you forget about them so get you in front of you forget who behind you they can help you if god could help you my god if you just sit down on the platform i'm going to sit down praise god it's god to help me it's got to help us it's got to help you we need him [Applause] [Applause] you feel his presence this morning so therefore the power would rest in place sons because the disciples were given power and that was a temporary power that wasn't resident power in matthew 10 power be who like send you power they were associated with jesus and therefore they had the power of jesus he's like you know somebody high up in the government and because you know you are rank because you know the prime minister you know this one you could go up to them because your partners were there with jesus father and they changed his blessing yes yes but when jesus went up the mountain in them had no power the cancer no epileptic spirit because jesus come off the mountain now but hear him upon him those guys was trying to cast all the devil saying look at you jesus told you to cast god and not one you could do it but jesus coming down the mountain here come faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness bradley kindness charity a sealed unit that devil know he was trembling jesus jesus started opening his mouth yet and you never want to know when to get out oh glory to god it will speak for itself did you hear what i say [Applause] damn devil said paul i know peter i know but who are you those devils seeing something on the inside oh it was more than a man if you look at the man you would say peter denied christ if you look at the man you say peter cursed that had nothing to do with the plan and program of god for that man like your failures is nothing your failures let me see it good [Applause] that's what the blood is for that's what the blood is for the blood is for your failures your blood is for your mystics your blood is for your sins oh give the lord a soul [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god so brother branham um he was born a prophet born a prophet but god told him do the work of evangelists to do what to grow to mature to writing to be tested and when he loses his wife and his child never said look at you preaching all these years and you're serving lord we the lord wouldn't answer your prayer your daughter would not die too and he was almost given in to say it's true devil all of a sudden something in him not here something inside of here say the lord give the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord the lord give the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord what are you crying about what trial have you been to what what what what's so hard get next to yourself listen for no baby baby baby this is for men to be boys to become men oh glory to god this is this is championship time glory you don't go to olympics because you're just taking a run around the block no you go there because you're qualified to enter into races and enter into this and that because it's the best that the world i've got call me now woke up feeling good right now [Applause] so the devil has climax into his very best so god promised to get his very best do i hear a shout in the house no you're beginning to know who you are when god called you he see you as his very best i know you don't feel like it i know you don't feel like it but that does not change it uh [Applause] so whatever elementary processes went through tests and trial and character formation until god dropping him the king's sword and position he placed him as a son of god now he was placed in his position as that elijah to open six seals because christ is the seventh seal that was filled inside of him because he was sent with a message to introduce elijah so not only did he operate as moses to bring the people out but he got the joshua commission with the hand of god open the bible and point from joshua 1-9 august the 7th 1957. and god reconfirmed that to him the 20th of september 1965. so william branham had the joshua commission a lot of people get mixed up with that because looking for a physical man to come and say let me go work the line what your father is all about god couldn't give you spirit when you have no seed word if god gave you a spirit without seed you end up by pentecostals speaking on the chandeliers speaking in tongues and going nowhere because dynamics struck the pentecostals they had signs wonders they still do miracles speaking in tongues and whatnot but no character so there was no adoption calling him scandal after scandal after scandal with those pastors because there was no life so of course i'm gonna reboot i'm gonna put my word in the people and use my word in them [Applause] and the word comes to a prophet so when they reject the prophet they reject the word and the word is a channel of the spirit the word is the conductor of the spirit so if you want to see the spirit flow put the word in [Applause] because in this seasonal time god is using his own word that is why the bride cannot fail [Applause] did you get that did you get that this bribe will not be like evil [Applause] [Music] [Applause] eve you said sit down please eve was supposed to stay behind the world and she came off from the word and the devil knocked her down but despite will be the word no false prophet no false teacher no false whatever could throw her off the word because god sent a prophet a seven angel messenger hallelujah who who went up in the in in the mind of god and brought down the mystery of god as the word of god and reveal all the promises of god so we were here to preach promises to you i'm not yet to preach my dream i'm here to bring promises to shake your flesh up to shake your spirit up to rock your soul to the very word of god [Applause] i didn't make the promise god made the promise and if god made a promise he's able to keep it you may be seated praise god hallelujah placing a son take him out to a certain place have a ceremony before angels place him positionally what he is in the body of christ then that person has the authority let me say this if you called me for a fanatic from this night on that very same thing that i'm speaking of will be done amen there will be a power put into the church and know is coming in that the holy spirit will so anoint the people they will speak the word and it will create itself right there we haven't seen power coming in the church now i know it for a fact satanist amount can be moved with no doubt in your heart you can have it what you says the placing of the church in position are you ready where the fullness of the holy ghost of the poor holy ghost comes into the church then the criticism will be shut it will be a short time jesus come right off the mountain and went straight to calvary so the critics mount will be only shot by power not by quotes so let them breathe hallelujah but we have a promise on page 304 wait till them seven thunders utter their voices to that group that could take the world [Applause] oh hallelujah they could fight and cut not talk and talk slice and cut the heavens open the heavens do whatever they want to do we want a revival today we're going to have it that's what we're talking about what do we want to do old-fashioned sin kill him demon chasing holy ghost revival [Applause] oh glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh give the lord some praises people [Music] 1963-65 with a seven seal seven thunder prophecy message yes first pull second pull but the third pull was to catch that bar hallelujah other people could fall over the first two points but that's temple was the opening of the world which is every written and hidden mystery he was revealing every mystery so no man can come now and say revealing a mystery the prophet didn't reveal that is foolishness that not working with the bride that could work with church members who have itchiness for new stuff but i think working with the brand that rugged gutsy bride who's standing on the words of malachi 4 every mystery has been revealed oklahoma over your eye hallelujah you know what you're called for you're called to be a partaker of his divine mate i always believe any man that got the key to unlock the pyramid that's the key to the rapture because he said this is the message that ties the man that's going to be redeemed hallelujah that's the message the perfect man message how to get in the pyramid not how to get in the church you could walk upstairs and sit here that's easy but at pyramid press the kingdom of god is preached and every man say press say like i said press every man got the press okay the lord i shout in the hole [Applause] you wanna be [Applause] the prophet said the hawk used to be brother to the eagle he wants you to fly and so but the hawk gets so lazy he just sits on telephone pole waiting for cat to knock down a rabbit and knock down dog and knock down this and knock down that he once used to fly and hunt for his food they're so lazy the kind you make a prayer meeting they're so lazy they can't pass ten minutes of prayer they're lazy that's the hawk but the eagle is still an eagle he just hunt he does fly he doesn't rip he does tear he doesn't go where he wants to go no minister's association stopping him oh glory to god i feel like flying this morning oh glory to god lord lift me up where i belong [Applause] [Music] [Applause] these brothers that i met they get pressure from their circle for coming among us and we getting blues for going by them but who cares as long as god go get glory and honor that's all i can and i'm led by the spirit of god i will go wherever the spirit leads me i will go wherever six seal no seal half seed quarter seal baptist methodist if a pentecostal church inviting them going i appreciate the pope i'll preach your obama i'll preach anywhere anytime i'm standing on a rock a rock of revelation paul is with me irenaeus is with me oh [Applause] maybe seated i'm not an ambassador of man bastard of the throne hallelujah man didn't call me man didn't anoint me they can't unanoint me they can't uncall me they can't de-minister me they can't de-list me that's foolishness hallelujah all who ephono he called hallelujah praise god hallelujah man there no song leader become pastor because the preacher fall you know this is not that you know this is not deacon came pastor because he passed the box like this is not that channel no no this is not that at all oh hallelujah the devil is in trouble he lost this battle whether we know where we come from we know where we're going we know god have a purpose for our lives hell and that purpose for your life the devil upset interrupt it's got to be fulfilled [Applause] give us prophecy secretary 65 seven see something the prophecy because when he preached in christ the mission of god revealed we thought the triple was on he said look at the clock it's 2pm second pull finish to pull at hand because christ was going to come to unveil the unfeeling of the mighty god which is a hidden mystery where god would begin to unveil stuff who's his manchester united said that big mystery is the future home of the bride and groom said go start to reveal and unfold so has god take the prophet of the scene confusion interpretation men stepping forward who said is eight messenger seven and a half messenger [Music] isn't that right which is the holy ghost in word form and he did amen isn't that right so joshua is the holy ghost that was veiling that prophet isn't that right so just what the holy ghost spoke spirit spoken words came out the prophet mount and put it on books on tapes isn't that right the land already divided on books on tapes he said rapture and fate is laying in the messages it is right there all you have need of inside the deer it is waiting for somebody to annoy you to pull it out pull it out pull it out and that brings us to that little inspiration possessing your individual inheritance you see we like to know the group doing this and the church doing this but look at caleb caleb after they cross the land streetings cross the land conquer the land and then divide the land you must conquer the land you can't have lana you're trying to plant underneath any pelting born around that that can't work you have to conquer them isn't that right so after the conquering caleb come up to joshua joshua you know what moses spoke considering me and you 40 years longer and half all them brothers die out man hallelujah i want you to know i ask you for help amen because i'm just as strong as when i first started that you're not hearing me you're not hearing me i asked him for bishop prayer and earlier prayer i'm deacon prayer he said i'm just as strong and if the lord be with me i'm not hearing it oh give the lord a scream give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] i know some of you tired not physically but mentally and emotionally and spiritually if you tired and weary it's a long journey i've been going along since 1975 looking for all these promises to become a reality this is 40 plus years but i'm just as strong as when i first started my god i started a long time ago but i'm just as strong every place i put my foot every place i feel like stamping dinner i feel like jumping every place i put the footage i put them within signs and wonders putting my foot in the power of blood putting over the miracles hallelujah every place you put your footage [Applause] maybe caesar notice hallelujah what caleb said all right um josh what you think excuse me um you think i could get my mountain you think about kevlar oh gosh i better say nothing because nobody asking for it you don't need the rest of them baxter you you don't have them have no faith whatsoever because take fear to take the sword they take fear to make a claim it takes faith to climb up the mountain all things that you're going to get is by faith you can't sit and expect faith to come on your lap you got to do something he said give me my mountain no no therefore give me my mountain he said take it the bible said he expelled the sons of enoch oh glory give the lord a shout in the house caleb get them out you got some expelling to do my god we transitioning you know we changing over from natural to supernatural from normal to super normal hallelujah that's what signs and one will be normal to you praying for the sick is normal to you you don't care what condition then it doesn't matter you didn't make the promise god did you are part of god you're a part of him you are part of elohim oh glory to god you are part of him oh hallelujah praise god and jesus said the same works i do shall you do also shall you do oh glory to god hallelujah he healed the sick we heal the sick he raised the dead we raised the dead he cast our devils we cast out devils he confront the pharisees we confront the pharisees oh glory to god he overcome be overcome same works he did we're gonna do also how many believe that how many receive that oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah praise god blessed be the name of the lord so praise god question who divided the land in the upper room which one of the brethren which one of the fellow ministers came down and said brethren you know i am the man i am the one [Applause] i am coming to break that bread to you open the understanding of the scripture son of man jesus breathe upon them receive the holy ghost son of man jesus he said behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tyrion is here to jerusalem until joshua come from on high amen will be giving the lord that shout out hallelujah so in that context jesus as soon a man was moves his ministry bringing him up to the promised land he said if i don't go comforter will not come i am going that spirit will come i am going that comforter will come oh hallelujah they say don't go jesus those have got to go because what your god can't take you through you need power power in your life power in prayer power in your soul power in your spirit power in your body do i hear shout in the house [Applause] temporary power that peter had when they come and know peter josh sword and tickled manny's instant restoration of a man heir who was not a believer or a saint [Music] but peter had no right taken of the man heir and jesus corrected it bam save god could instantly heal her air what about your kidneys what about diabetes what about irritants what about cancer what about humor what about sicknesses i'm not hearing a good demon for that one more coming you know do you think you're finished with zika is there more coming said we are striving to enter the kingdom of god before these plagues strike so the plagues are coming and sons of god coming and someday we will confront plagues versus sons of god and they're gonna back up cancer they're gonna push back to you they're gonna push back to play it sons of god that's what the creation is growing for [Applause] hallelujah creation of that growing for more mysteries more teachings more unfoldings of revelations we had that for [Music] is the manifestation of the sons of god when god's sons come and take back from the devil what he took from us that is what the creation is groaning for oh hallelujah we going back we going back we get him back my god i preached our message across the restitution of all things and i was convinced after that message god will restore all things because the bible said why say the scribe elias must first come and restore all things hallelujah he said he last must first truly come and restore all things all things must be restored jesus is up there whom the heaven must receive until the restitution of all things jesus had to stay up there until everything was restored perfect church ephesians church holy ghost church phil church anointed church god can't go back to the jews until the gentiles is baptized with fire them jews have to wait those jews have to wait you're not hearing what i'm saying [Applause] israel has got time peace but god have a bright peace among the gentiles that have to be sealed with christ when god finished with this bride then he gives a cross to the jews oh hallelujah glory to god brother branham in paradox hear what he's saying here amen years ago when i seen the bible come down i got a wrote here come down and a hand came from heaven and pointed out to joshua read the first nine verses and stopped there that is joshua when he near jordan god called him out and said this day i'll begin to magnify you before the people then he took the churn across jordan to the land and divided to them the promised land let's call it further now you see what coming to the jordan meant we are down here now all right let's cross over let's quit playing let's cross the other side now because it all belongs to us it's all ours them visions has never failed they can't fail because they come from god i believe with all that is within me we are not the highland that will run back to the wilderness we will cross jordan we will cross georgia we will cross jordan you will hear a bigger image than that your promise is not before jordan your promises across jordan then hear the prophet god bring to us the seals on the back of the book [Music] let us enter into this great place now for joshua divided to the people the inheritance that god left for him so he put the seven pendants which is in the back of the book as the land of promise to be divided he said we're gonna cross take us back there that we could see our inheritance so when the lamb took the brook the seventh seal there was sirens the devil don't have a clue what's happening there but seven thunder was banging one two three four five six seven oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah on that year is where your inheritance lay oh blessed be the name of the lord now watch this land the promise he said no one says leave in egypt next stage wilderness third stage canaan now canaan does not represent the age of the millennium it represents the age of the overcomer because in canaan they killed billion took cities will be no debt in the millennium now what is the land that promised to the new testament believer the promise is the holy spirit amen for it shall come to pass in the last days 228 i'll pour my spirit isn't that right that is the promise the promise is the baptism of the spirit which is promised in all the old testament on youtube that is the promise here we go the promised land is to live in this land of the holy spirit so so you could give up jealousy envy malice strife you could lay down anger you could lay down lust you could do it god put that built inside of you but you got to give up you got to lay it down yeah you got to want to be coached i was telling somebody all those athletes have to be coached because you're feeling after you're going to let them move so you feeling like to not even reach the olympics because you had to be able to take discipline that's my disciple come from a disciplined one one that could be corrected instructed directed guided not a bullhead no no bullets spirit not of god hallelujah not arrogance arrogant spirit not of god you're guaranteed a release not of god somebody humble willing because there's always more to learn they can't say oh because eli was old and he was blind to what his sons was doing isn't that right and god wakes up little samuel that brings samuel forward to bust the whole thing god will use anybody you know oh yes you could find a young life and you're gonna use them praise god so this promised land is the land of the holy spirit that's got promised for the church is to live in the power of the spirit it's another world it's another land you have to come out of the conditions you've been in to come out and live in this promised land to receive the promise remember that you shall receive promise from one high after the holy ghost has come upon you okay from paradox we continue don't you see in shadows stop you a minute there's got to be a place prepared for the world to be manifest and we are now living by the evidence of the new land amen the son of man that elijah prophet could only open six seals christ the son of man is the seventh seal is he is he if brother branham and christ if there was a different man a physical to say well this is christ here it might be easier but you see he failed the son of man he was a son of man revealing thee son of man so he said we are living now by the evidence of the new land dishonor man we are still living by the evidence [Applause] the son of man was the evidence of the new land every mystery being revealed we are living by it every promise being spoken we are living by it every promise being spoken and by these promises these precious revealed promises not just promises but revealed oh hallelujah every mystery has been revealed oh glory now we can be partakers of his divine nature oh glory to god so now i believe it's time to take the land yes sir not just say his promises it revealed this land is my land and that's like no no it's like caleb right now that's hebron hebron you have to possess it now you have to get aggressive hallelujah you have to get militant and aggressive to possess your land not to fight other brethren that's foolishness that them can't take you with they take away your time they take away your thoughts and your mind so you don't go in a church war forget that that will take up too much of your time you want to land war your backlash with your philistines your battle with your personal demons come on give the lord a shout in the house i'm about to get started i'm not feeling about to get started hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you're battling with this brother and this sister and this one and that one if your battle is that you're in trouble because you in flesh flesh and blood you don't like me shiro shake my hand this one say this this one do that this one do that and you in a natural bathroom i wouldn't ever see that he said good good keep it keep it up keep it up i'm supporting you in that keep it keep it going this one fighting this one this one training with this one and traveling pelt in here david duck in here david still deal with the javelin drawer oh hallelujah praise god oh you talk about the christian spirit you have to have it come on now come on now i want him i am man glory from world war in the park god is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises outside of them promises he can't meet you because you don't cut yourself off from him god is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises so when you see them brothers start to pray the god of abraham isaac and jacob who promised to bring us out and you said thy seed shall possess the kid let them start to pray to heaven to shake you know because they cannot be denied [Applause] your blessings could be delayed but the cannot be denied [Applause] give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] i really want to get god's obligation to meet you on the basis of them promises outside and promises he can't meet you because you don't cut yourself off isn't that right so therefore until you speak it only when you speak it become a promise if i just leave right there it's just a thought of god but when it's spoken it's the word of god isn't that right as long as it's not spoken it's a thought so you want to be healed when you see and say nothing but you want to be healed you ain't claiming nothing you have to say i'm going to be healed but i start like what's here healing his mind thought the devil in trouble because your face had to light up and your face had to roll back the sickness that you must have to try to shrink the virus had to shrink in your body because you had to claim the anointing hallelujah praise god do you understand what we're talking about a woman came up on the platform with no eyes no eyes in a socket a man came up all right and baram spoke for the eyes and the light come and begin to create the eyes amidst the middle of creation he said i forget to ask you what color you wanted [Music] what color you wanted oh close she's here i hear blue is a nice color she had it that's what got me talking about he create new kidneys pancreas new womb new jawbone new backbone hallelujah a new heart new spirit come on yes yes you could change [Music] we have to want to change you have to see the need to change [Applause] so jesus had to speak his words to the disciples you have to give them a promise not many days hence he had to tell them you shall receive power from one hand you have to unlock john 2 28. it shall come to pass i'll put my spirit you have to unlock isaiah 28 with time release and another tongue you have unlocked the scriptures the old testament to them isn't that right and give them a positive vibes an equipment to go in the upper room it wasn't easy they were under pressure they went up there and fear the jews they shut the doors it wasn't easy waiting in the promise of god but it was a promise of god man didn't make the promise god made the promise and if god made it we could wait for it if god made it we could wait on it i will wait till my change come oh give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory hallelujah so then they received the word first then the spirit came and the son of man come seventh seal took the written word took the promises of god and these divine promises that ministers don't want to preach because they find it boring they find it doesn't tell the story they want to tell but these are spirit-given words that's why the prophet says say what the tips say because them tapes has something in it it's not he that say it it's god that say it the spirit the scripture is god breathed holy men moved by god a man shall bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god and the mouth of god is his prophets so when william branham spoke that was the mouth of god speaking spirit spoken word are you hearing what i'm saying therefore the word has to come inside of you that's what the minister was supposed to do the secret is the word is in the bride oh give the lord a shout [Applause] that's why that's how you can never understand how jesus could find way to find this woman of the world fine find time to find out this woman i'm going to look for this woman and wait for this woman oh hell because something inside of her that she doesn't know inside of her she have a secret she doesn't even know people see her flesh and spirit and behavior and whatnot but she has something deep on the inside that he want to unlock he wanted to unravel he did it and she went free oh god let's go out and lock you today how many want to be unlocked what unlock you whatever hindering you whatever complex whatever issues in your system people are so much oh hallelujah praise god i'm too tall i do ten i do fat i do this i'm a father i'm my mother i didn't have a good education and i can't write and i can't read and i can't speak and i'm afraid and i'm too timid and i listen to that forget all of that you are sons and daughters of god god call you god going to fix it just right god going to rearrange your life you don't have to be like nobody else you want to be authentic you want to be originally you god love you as you are but i like you to be somebody else god love you that's why he called you he chose you he said you have not chosen me but i have chosen you i have ordained you to bring forth fruit [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah so how could gossip dynamics on me in 1975 when i wasn't married yet and my sons locked up inside of me they are seeds of god they have to comfort in their season so if i say lord lord rapture me now [Applause] every name on that book going to be expressed here the shocker all the ages are already taken up the life already suck up its people we can't go back ahead is tribulation or rapture [Applause] you can keep all the car all the land all the money you can buy plain hotel spacecraft air ship you can go out to space and wait for a while you're still coming down heaven i'm gonna build with the fervent heat all the atmosphere fire fire fire oh glory to god but there's going to be a rapture we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last chunk of the trumpet [Applause] oh and this mortal will put on immortality oh and this corruption gonna put on interruptions [Applause] oh give the lord a shout we are getting out of here [Applause] to the same prophet this malachi for prophets prophesy the ministry of the spirit to come to quicken the word to you because he said intellectually we hear in the message he knew all things of in prophecy he prophesied intellectually we are hearing the message but it has to come tender and be done in your heart it has to come from head to heart where the message sort of oozes inside of you because that invisible god want to become visible this is what it's all about isn't that right so therefore this capstone spirit have to come to a capstone world so god put that word inside of you isn't that right so malachi come to restore back the faith the virtue the knowledge that they come to respect all them virtues that is what the holy spirit had they had seven virtues that was thundering out that the devil couldn't handle people were healing peter's shadow because the image of god was standing in peter oh hallelujah when you're coming to peter's shadow was healed the power was so much in paul that when it touched cloth garments was anointed that when they take that the pew were healed everything you touch whatever your touch your hands anointed your foot anointed the words anointed anointed with god [Applause] enough sense to know how to touch the coldness how old you have to give the church if a doc can do that by instinct what about the holy ghost in the church it ought to bring us out of all formalities and creeds into a glorious wonderful baptism of the holy ghost it brings virtue it brings knowledge it brings patience it brings godliness and the holy spirit and that was under the guide so what the prayer was saying from 1966 this guide of the holy ghost was supposed to lead the church into virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience whatever you preach whatever you teach it's supposed to bring it in godliness the brotherly kindness the charity that you could be a partaker of his divine nature this thing wouldn't live he'd have to live i want it i wanted to live in me i wanted to live through me my wife have to see it my children have to see it you have to see it i've got to see it others have to see it the critics have to see it the liars they go see it too the haters they got to see it hallelujah everybody going to see it it will speak for itself but abraham said he will let it be made known among men you can hide it the pillar of fire will hang over you and say look him here this is my beloved son look another one here you can hide look at daughter mine's here oh give the lord a shout you can't hide he's going to identify you [Applause] know his words oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god so the dynamics descended as a shout in word form my words are spirit and life that's the secret you know why the foolish virgins can't get the oil they don't have the word in them because the oil is the word turn to spirit could you imagine you filled with oil right now in word form could you imagine you have a pyramid and you know in mechanic form are you walking with the rapture rapture is already inside of you when people looking for things outside low here low here go here go here they have the angel here to have the angel here's this and here is that jesus forget about it the kingdom is within you you have got to know where the kingdom is at come on preach back to me somebody oh glory to god that divine nature faith power vote of power knowledge these are not natural things is the natural patience is that it is the patience of jesus christ is the temperance of jesus christ is the faith of jesus christ [Applause] are we preaching the word this morning amen from church with man peter said because you have escaped the corruption that is the world to lust for money lots of big time that's a pleasure all right everything i see a want somebody can see so get something new and your eyesight get go twice in size because you wanted two small advice live below your means you don't hear that right did you ever hear that that's my motto okay simon peter a servant of the person of jesus christ he reminds me

handbags my sister's side on the brother's side some people like ties whatever it is don't let that show you off lust for money there we go lots of big things loss of popularity these things are dead to the believer all god could testify to you he got to present it to you amen so he's so lucky amen amen you got a big bag of money but to break your principles goggles you say well okay behind me first no you have to stand for the word you have to stand for the what's right you have to stand for what's principle because you see it's not manual looking to please it's god's approval you're looking for you need him when you have to pray for your children you need him when you're the perfect husband you need him amen when you need your prayer answered you need him when you're on your sick bed you need him [Music] to this lust for money lust for big things loss of popularity these things are dead to the believer we don't care tend to cottage why should i care live or die sink or drum tent or cottage amen light are not one you will take the cottage you don't live in a tent place a tentacle cottage small house big house square house wrong house in the attic it doesn't matter it does not really matter hallelujah that reminds me of the attic remember the story about around body old grandfather and a young son and daughter and thing and they have playing cards and whatnot and they say you know what we will give my geography book giving me bible you always rejoicing reading the bible and shouting and blowing hallelujah they say they will give my geography book put them in the attic to keep them quiet you have nobody wrong at all and the party going on all over the world hello your glory father carry on praise the lord hallelujah when they check out the papa say what happened is that joking book he said i was reading a geography book and i realized they have a place in the sea they have no bottom line i don't want to remember the sins gone to the bottomless i couldn't help but shout [Applause] when you have god in you you will see god everywhere [Applause] [Applause] why should i kill liver die cinco drum this is the thing i'm interested in the kingdom of god whether i maintain my home whether i maintain my family whether i maintain whatever it is let me maintain christ so you can maintain your lawn in front of your house that's good i salute you but pray this prayer make sure you maintain christ your floor was perfect the broom perfect and this perfect and that perfect but make sure you maintain christ at the end of the day is christ you would need i feel like running through a troop this morning oh glory to god see john is trapped catch him oh hallelujah all glory oh glory to god so think about being purged yes yes being tried being tuned and something like that until the devil there's nothing there's no there's nothing good you can't respond to his offers oh hallelujah a monika touch oh oh glory to god denver said build me up oh lord into this let christ be my head not some man in america be my head not some message pope not some bishop what you're looking for let christ this all our prayer amen let christ be my head working through me on my foundation my feet that's in him let virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brother kindness work in me oh lord is my prayer i don't care live or die sink or drunk denomination or no denomination friend or no friend let that work in me let christ's virtue his knowledge flow out that i that's what the ministry might be able to teach so we could only effectively teach with power and knowledge because knowledge is given to the minister to feed the people and god has to put power in it that power can come into you with the knowledge of the son of god hallelujah glory to god for god has set in the church set god has yes yes not convention and ministers say you are fivefold you're not in the fold who only fold all right no god has set in the church apostles and prophets and teachers evangelists for what for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it that's the purpose of the ministry god had put the pastors and teachers for the pastor's glorification for the pastor to be lifted up on high and say oh a lovely pastor that's not the purpose of that god purpose amen it's for the virtues to come into you god's purpose is for you to get a revelation that you have to be a partaker of this divine nature and peter identified by these promises [Applause] these promises are precious just some people they need so long afterwards it gets stale like when i'm talking about the manager you see and the man talking a man is seeing god and they see what a man tell him i just know god i hear for how much years i only see this water salt man grumpy you taste so long he has seen his sunset he see the beauty of nature he's in sea and salt and butter infects him hungry he need god in him yes when you have god in you you see nature you see the beauty of the amen the birds flying you feel good you see the birds flying and they they're flying free they have a conference i fly so permission please to fly soul the birds free god wants his children free free to save him free to worship nothing must bind you must must hinder you oh glory to god notice not just all those people in the bible i've got the british radicals you know one more the bloody so she was a radical person she said if i could just touch she just gives you a promise if i could just talk to him of the garment i'll be made whole hallelujah she bleeding bleeding if i could just touch her mother she if i could just say hell of his gum and i remain hold he told herself that and come to see jesus so wrongly about all these different people i'll be serious she'll tell you hand back under the leg and say i want my handbag and she pushed and she pressed and she she was just trying to get to jesus you can't fault a person that's my hand back there excuse me excuse me i have to get my handbag whatever she did she had to get hurt and once you get to jesus who touched me who touched my clothes [Applause] you see i felt a power come on to me i felt virtue come out of me i felt power i felt virtue i felt power fell virtue he had it in him that was resident power that was permanent power that was dynamic power that was a dynamo inside of him they couldn't turn it off and they couldn't turn it out oh help me jesus had to preach somebody help me preach somebody they couldn't turn it off and they couldn't turn it out and when god put that power inside of you jesus said this may he that believe it on me out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water oh you're not hearing me this morning my god i feel a revival in the count i feel the holy spirit and the pillar this morning oh glory to god he that believeth on me out of his belly afloat rivers is artesian well it keeps bubbling up bubbling and bubbling up in your soul this is holy ghost time this is revival time this is demon chasing time this is possessing a mountain time this is you given your individual inheritance you press it towards the mark of the high calling oh glory to god hallelujah praise god escape the corruption you escape the tattoos you escape all them brain and all them praise go on their makeup hallelujah escape hell yes yes yes yes yes yes yes hallelujah glory to god you escape the miniskirts the hot pants the tight shots the mini dress you escape all of that they're giving you no fight no more you overcome them oh hallelujah [Applause] praise god there are so many different types different ways they claim to christ jesus they said if you join the church some say if you believe some say one thing another some take it by baptism some take it by fellowship but first corinthians twisted by one spirit we are baptized into one body which is the body of christ the body of believers by what not by one handshake not by one mode of baptism not by one feeling but by one spirit number one teaching and if i don't believe my teaching you're out of it you'll believe what i out of it that's foolishness keep your teaching keep what you believe oh harlow the church of god is free not by teachings it's more than that by one spirit you are baptized into the body so if you are baptized in your body and you meet somebody from china baptizing the body that's your brother you don't have to ask the chinese brother oh you believe tick you believe that thick you believe that tick and you have a list of ticks and when you finish take off the ticks that's a brother let me shake your hand put away that paper if you don't have this gentleman that has a brother you in trouble because you have to have this ailment when the brother came up on the platform bahram says you're not sick you're a christian i feel that spirit vibration all for you you're here for revival you are minister of the gospel how many you want to revive oh glory to god what abraham said in five minutes i can tell you somebody's a christian give me [Applause] he was bruised toe open beside roman spear in order by the holy spirit we could be baptized into his body and become partakers of his divine nature you get it then you become a partaker after coming into his body a partaker of his divine nature christ nature in you how can you cheat steal lie backslide proselyte and everything else with divine nature of christ in you it's impossible that's why i said after you add these things charity have to seal it because things will leak out virtue leaking out knowledge leaking out this leaking out but virtue the bund of perfectness like elmo's glue [Applause] when it glue everything down then you're a sealed unit of the lord god and you are sealed until the day of your redemption devil can't touch he can only watch but he can't touch a sealed unit of the lord god then you see vindicated sons syndicated daughters with a living faith living virtue living knowledge living temperance living patience living godliness living bodily kindness [Applause] but they're not putting several properties in material that's what they see because that's what he would see so you see it too the honey sticks there's a phrase honey had a stick you had to go by somebody what kind of honey that private honey oh hallelujah it looked like it won't stick by the honey i'm feeling sticky this morning [Applause] yeah you could forgive your brother you could forgive your sister you could let things go you can or you can my nintendo you can mine your own and even get a bonnet fit and put it on your old head you could even feed your oat and say you really mean it and you're keeping it you know then you alter the girl they can't get better than you you know but when you see the need for charity when you begin to see you need perfect love to get out of here then you could understand when jesus said when he said when you stand praying for charity for the love of god for this total power for spirit for dynamics drop your order if you have it against any the our father pray forgive us as we forgive those that trespass against us and faith is based on forgiveness so how could they have real faith when there is no real forgiveness forgiveness means not that the person then do it but you drop it and you can hug your breath and hug your sister you can't hold them over the phone you know you can't hug them emoji i don't even have a hockey emoji and you send it across and say i love you that car know love have to show it to them god didn't say that emoji when he wanted us to be willing to know them rascals for them god shall love the world he said emoji no he didn't do that god shall love the world he said his only begotten son he come down and handle me a little baby named jesus hallelujah grow up to pay the price of all redemption pay the price that we get partakers of his divine nature okay so watch if you be a partaker of christ then you become a new creature all things have passed away all things become new all your warrings and fossils and stewards and arguments and tempers all these things pass away you see it what is the fruit of the spirit we have planted it on church membership upon shouting demonstration but the fruit of the spirit is love love who that is when you love those who are unlovable the fruit of the spirit is love you love your family you love your friends you love them who love you bring cake for you who bring something nice for you that was the easiest one to love gotta bring our chocolate for you and you'll be making chocolate for them i love you you love me but that's not the love you're talking about yeah you know this love is the love the unlovable that's when you're looking to test your love [Music] you're looking for opportunity to release this love all this have locked up inside of you whenever when you let it out then you take the opportunity you're getting with me i'm going to see what you need and they come on oh i love jesus [Music] and jesus said look look so glory oh you're gonna love me and you can't love him you have to love one another because you are my disciples all men will know that when that love began to flow so you have to have an interest in being active and pursuing after love pursuing after kindness somebody i'm saying rat and anger you could answer them back in anger you can but you choose to defer that and answer back in kindness and deflate the whatever they have the big airbag of anger put the pin and [Music] but when that when that airbag of anger come up and you started bringing your air bag then there and there's a big city blowing up next made your neighbor hearing and and peace peace pipe had to come between you you don't need all of that you just need to apply virtue and knowledge and wisdom i called the bible said brothers that dwell with your wife with wisdom it's quiet in here boys sometimes wisdom is a distant thing you know the bible says let me
