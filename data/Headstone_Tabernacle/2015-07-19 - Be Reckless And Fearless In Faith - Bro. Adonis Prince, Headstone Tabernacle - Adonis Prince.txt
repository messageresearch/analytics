Corinthians chapter 9 for scripture reading verse 19 you can St read from verse 19 1 Corinthians chapter 9 Paul speaking for though I be free from all men yet have I made myself servant unto all that I might gain the more unto the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews to them that are under the law as under the law that I might gain them that are under the law to them that are without law as without law being not without law of God but under the law to Christ that I might gain them that are without law to the weak I became I as weak that I might gain the weak I have made all things to all men that I might by all means save some let's pray father we thank you for your word it is beautiful it is powerful it is enlightening father may you inspire these few moments that we have in time with you may be beneficial to us may it be inspiring to us may it change our lives or walk or talk the atmosphere in which we live granted father bless your people bless the word bless the speaker that will come forward and bless us today in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen s you may be seated as we amen wait upon the Lord amen hallelujah oh praise God glory genuine Christians amen rugged Christians Hallelujah solid men and women and this scripture is a powerful scripture Paul wasn't content to be on his own he said I become all things to all men amen that my all means that I might save some amen I call that real rugged godsy original Christianity amen that you willing to bend and be flexible you willing to reach out you willing to go where others wouldn't go speak where others wouldn't speak do what others wouldn't do that you might might save some you are prepared to become whatever they are almost to see if you could win them and save them as it was isn't that right genuine Christianity not people who feel they are somebody or above somebody but people who understand that you are what you are only by the grace of God a people that will understand that if the power is to come among a people it wouldn't even be their prayer but it will be the grace of God if you are to make it it will still be the grace of God and there's only Grace because love has been projected Hallelujah there's only Grace because love reached out to us to pick us up that we could be who we are so you have something to bless God about this morning yes you may be struggling yes you may be having a rough time but that doesn't mean the grace of God is away from you is the grace of God be in this time presently Hallelujah God said if he didn't cut the day short no would be saved but for the elect sake he going to cut the day short hallu oh hallelujah praise God in other words we're heading on to Darkness and gross Darkness covering the Earth and covering the people but thank God God put a light a Malachi for light a evening light a star in the night time one of God's stars in his right hand Stars come out in the night time it's night time but God sent a seven Angel Messenger to shine light that we could know how to walk and to create a Revival in our own spirits that we wouldn't die except you be revived you're going to die that's why we have to long for Revival call for Revival speak for Revival pray for Revival expect a holy ghost Revival we have got to have it this what we live by this is what energizes us we got to be inspired we don't here just to hear lecture or hear thoughts we had to be inspired there a bunch of inspired people hallelujah glory to God but Isa gave me a powerful quotation he said there's no substitute for divine inspiration and Revelation there is no substitute I don't care intellectual I don't care have a PhD a doctorate there is no substitute for in for vision inspiration and Revelation there is no substitute oh my god when God speaks to your heart there is no substitute for that Hallelujah no job could subtitute that no salary can substitute that no husband can substitute that no wife can substitute that no woman no man can substitute when God speaks to the human heart Oh Glory to God and he's the same yesterday forever and God can speak to you this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah amen amen hallelujah let's read it again though I be free from all men yet I have made myself servant unto all GL anybody could be a preacher read text scripture and quote but very few going to be servants that's why Jesus Took the barrel the the the Basin with water and washed their feet amen they didn't understand what he was doing at first amen he wanted to do something not by coats but by demonstration that's right this is the behavior this is the thinking this is the attitude I want you to have he said the Gentiles have rulers and rule over them but I want he that a great among you let him serve amen hallelujah hallelujah prise God servitude amen serve not who want to be a big Shir not who want to be on some throne and be worshiped and acknowledged that is why I keep saying all Africa wherever I go it's not about the ministers it's about the people God's flock and in Ezekiel 34 you can read it God said I going to require those Shepherds of the flock that I put into their hands you are not my flock you are God's flock that I have been placed here to serve Amen on say Amen somebody let's get it right now let's get it right now amen you are not my Sheep amen no you are God's sheep that God placed me here as a Shepherd to minister to his sheep come on now I don't own you you were bought by his blood you were bought with a price he paid for you hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] Amen to the weak I became weak amen that I might gain weak I am made all things to all men that I might by all means save some I'll preach to them who don't believe the seven seal is open preach to them who don't even believe in seals preach to the Baptist to the Methodist preach to The Sinner the drunker The Prostitute the honger it doesn't matter whosoever will we have to wrap up and close this age off with the last testimony the spirit and the bride say come not stay out not dead out but come whosoever will yes you're struggling come true yes you're weak come true yes you don't know how you're going to make it come true yes you want break you come too but the spirit and the bride going to be saying Come Oh Glory to God oh give me give me Lord a shout of Praise over the speaker on the comat Give the Lord a shout of Praise they're going to be real Christians ruged Christians Gody Christians you may be seated praise God not the kind you have to spray no I of water I you to put certain thing to spray the the off for them no not that kind of Christians I'm talking about people that love God they become Fearless it come like you don't care a kind of Reckless fith where you believe God for anything and for everything you don't care because God is your father and the devil have no business between you and your father he doesn't own you he have no license on you H going whisper and talk and talk all kind of negative things to you but when you come to church you come to hear your voice my sheep hear my voice his voice is his word so once the word is spoken that's the voice of God you love him oh praise the name of the Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah praise be to Jesus Oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord he said we cannot lead one another we are helpless we got to depend on the great Shepherd amen of the Sheep amen who is the Lord Jesus who's the great sheer the Sheep Lord the Lord Jesus not Pastor somebody Pastor somebody is a Shepherd in a church is not right but the real Shepherd is the Lord Jesus amen isn't that right hallelujah praise God so if a fellow doesn't know a sheep real well it's hard to tell the difference between the bleeding of the goat and of a sheep they hold lot alike but the nature of them prove what they are and that's the way with confessed Christians and real Christians the goat represent the world they lead you right down the wrong road to your Eternal separation from God they would lead you into the trouble but we are sheep or we better watch what kind of Shepherd we got isn't that right and it could be if all God sheep when the heat was on would stand together when the trials was real hard and the heat is on and everything is going on everywhere if all of God's Little Sheep would just stand together we have the coolness of the shade of each other to comfort to lean upon one another now somebody said is that necessary brother Brandon it certainly is there's nothing like having a real good Dependable friend or when the trouble are blazing and the heat is on you can go to this friend and sit down and explain to them talk it over in personal confidence and then kneel down pray together and know that this person is a good God saved man or woman that you can put confidence in oh it's good to do that hallelu oh blessed be the name of the Lord and I think when the church get real cold in different God sheep ought to kind of huddle up together and pray for each other and the warmth of good Christian Fellow ship it means so much David said blessed is the man that sth not in the seat of the scornful but is Delight in the law of the Lord and in that La that heed day and night isn't that right now praise God whatever you do shall prosper isn't that wonderful then he said now if our heart condem us not but if there's something in your life that condemns you you better make that right you just can't operate right the Holy Spirit can't deal with you when you got Prejudice and selfishness and all those things in you the Holy Spirit can never bless you you might get some intellectual emotions G some work up let me explain something to you for instance when a woman gets married and she's afraid that she's not going to have a baby she won't have it no but let her go and adopt a baby then she will have one now that book's claim that's N9 out of 10 it will do it why it sets her body into the right emotion ask the doctor if that's not right it puts her in the right attitude so before you have the real baby you could get the adopted baby so before you get the Holy Ghost you could adopt by your Praises by your worship by getting your minds set in the right atmosphere because you know God going to fill you with the Holy Ghost hallelujah praise God you can come on a great expectation because you know God going to manifest something in your life can you please stand and give God some worship praise God hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise be to Jesus Hallelujah I say yes Lord yes Lord hallelujah I say yes Lord I say [Music] yes to your will Lord oh yeah I say yeah Lead Me Oh Where lead me I will go I will go I say yes Lord many want to say yes this morning I say yes I oh let's sing one more time the prince come to us this morning I say yes Lord I say yes I say do your will Lord your will I [Applause] say where you lead me where you lead me there I will go I will go I want to say yes Lord I say I say yes my Lord I do you want to say yes to the Lord this morning hallelujah hallelujah just worship Him Praise Him thank him say yes to him Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus shall we bow our heads for a word of prayer almighty God we thank you this morning for Gathering us around your word you said by the mouth of the Prophet that your people is gathering under a promise that's the reason why this Gathering is important we call upon the holy spirit to come Among Us father to vindicate the word to Quicken it back to us father so that it can produce results we depending on you father God we ask a blessing upon the reading of the word the hearer and the preacher father may you take me out of the way father God and may you speak to somebody to encourage somebody as we yielded ourselves as your servant to win a soul for the kingdom and to edify one another that's the purpose why you called us into the Ephesian season father we commit the service into your hands each and every one of us into your hands in the wonderful and Powerful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we say amen and the church shall say Amen if you have your Bibles we have three portions of scriptures in the Book of Joshua and the Book of 1 Samuel and the Book of methew so first scripture reading is in the Book of Joshua chapter 1 from verse 3 to8 if you have it it reads as follow from verse three every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that I have given unto thee as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river EES all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your cast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of th life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage For unto these people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper with with soever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate there in day and night and thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success amen and then the next scripture reading in the book of Samuel 1 Samuel chapter 17 just 2 verse 10 verse 29 and verse 37 verse 29 says and David said what have I now done is there not a cause and verse 36 seven David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the pow of the lion and out of the pow of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and Saul said unto David go and the Lord be with thee amen and last scripture reading Matthew chapter 9:18 just one verse Verse 18 Matthew chapter 9 while he spake these things unto them behold there came a certain ruler and worshiped him and saying my daughter is even now dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated I surely deem it a privilege to stand before you I am very grateful for the hospitality that has been extended to me somehow the Lord knew all about these plans I didn't even know myself that I would be here but I have realized that it's the Lord's doing and I will take the opportunity and I hope to be a blessing to you as you've been a blessing to me thus far so I would like to thank the pastor and brother Isaac and the entire church for the lovely brotherly love that they have shown the kindness towards me during my in Trinidad and uh I'm sure enjoying it I wish I could speak your P so I'm catching the accent and I'm getting there for a title I have quite a bold message this morning and I hope it blesses you as the Lord laid it upon my heart amen my title is be Reckless and fearless in faith Hallelujah be Reckless and fearless in faith which Faith there's only one Faith there's only one Lord and we've been contending for that faith and that Faith was restored by Malachi 4 therefore Malachi 4 is telling you this morning be Reckless and fearless in faith Hallelujah and my inspiration is fear not little flock it's the father's will to give you the kingdom Hallelujah so it's the father's will to give us the kingdom we did not deserve this Kingdom but he made us citizens of this Kingdom and it's a spiritual Kingdom you won't see it with your eyes because the king of this kingdom is the Lord himself and his citizens is the elect only Hallelujah the predestinated ones Hallelujah and my subject Holy Ghost Land possessing time do you believe that we have arrived in the land possessing time which is the Holy Ghost Land it is a land of milk and honey it is a beautiful land my brother and you've made it on the third face this is where you going to have your inheritance Hallelujah are you ready direct quote from the prophet's message as I was with Moses so will I be with thee now Joshua in all this knowing that the command was great but having the Assurance he could be Fearless he could be as we would call it Reckless as long as he was pointed the right way hallelujah amen he says as long as you are pointed in the right direction be Reckless and fearless in your faith Hallelujah because people are Marching some groups are going this way some groups are going that way we don't know who is leading them but all we are interested about is to know what did Malachi for say because he is the the star he is the star that pointed us to Christ and if you are facing the right direction my brother my sister be Fearless be Reckless as long as you are facing the right direction Hallelujah we find Joshua knowing the responsibilities was leading them through L now that he'd have to go over into some land he have to set up the kingdom he'd have to divide The Inheritance among them he know the commission was tremendous many people was thinking that the new land was the Millennium the prophet says no they were killing and fighting there there won't be any fighting in the Millennium the land that Joshua was taking them into is parallel to the Holy Ghost Land Hallelujah he said but to you men and woman there's something in you that is calling out because the other Brethren prefer to stay on the border they prefer to stay on the other side of Jordan but for you who's got the deep that is calling unto a deep there must be a call Yonder to respond to your deep hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so he says hallelujah you are going to pass by your brethren but you who believe God to you who know to you that God something in you that is calling you to the other side if all the Deep you've got has been satisfied then stay where you are but for me and my house it's a personal testimony I am not yet satisfied because when I listen to brother bram's message I don't just get the knowledge of the message I also see the demonstration of the faith the gift of God operating in a man Hallelujah he will discern he would heal he would tell things in advance brother I am not yet satisfied with the theologies of men that's why for me and my house for me and my house don't speak for me let me speak for myself for me and my house I am not yet satisfied I am looking for a Revival Hallelujah because he promised a Revival and there's coming for a Revival a seven Thunder Revival hallelujah hallah hallelujah Hall you may be seated Glory Glory he says I cannot I cannot be satisfied with you theology there's something beyond that and that's calling me that's my desire Brethren to see my church cross over into another land a desire to move over to the other side if there's something in you here first there's a calling in you there'll be something to respond to that call because there's something called on on across the ridge Yonder across the Ridge and all across Jordan until you fall fall into the arms of God Yonder so your portion is God himself the Holy Ghost himself hallelujah hallelujah he says if the word says do a certain thing amen do it the prophet pre the message whatsoever God tells you to do whatsoever God tells you to do many people are ready to do what the doctor tells them they take the pr ION three times a day certain numbers of tablets they obedient to what the doctor says but how many this morning are ready to do whatsoever the Lord tells you to do God is telling you to cross over come on my brother let us cross over to the other side to the Holy Ghost Land it's a land of Victory it's a land of possibilities it's a land of your inheritance and I believe this morning we are going to possess the land we are going to possess the Holy Ghost we are going to receive from God [Applause] hallelujah so the prophet goes on to say what we need today is men and women who wants a reality Hallelujah not a Creed but a reality that what the world needs today not quits not fashion not theology we need realities in God the world don't want it the other churches they don't want it they are satisfied to just cting Bram coaching brother Bram and they stop there but for me and my house I want reality the god of William brandham the one who raised the Dead who open the death ear the God himself hallelujah what we need today is a reality if they don't want to accept it but you the church you have to have it God wants you to have it God wants you to have the Holy Ghost God wants you to have your promise God wants you to have your portion God wants you to possess the land Hallelujah [Applause] see God uses men you may be seated do you believe that he can only use men when he can find some men when he can find somebody that he can use there was a time in the days of Judges God could not find a man that he could put his emphatic confidence in so he was trying this one trying that one and it was so difficult and Israel was having so many troubles the Philistines were taking an advantage and God has made a promise and I am here because of that promise you are here because of that promise what is the promise about it is your duty to find the promise of the hour and what is that promise if the people that are called by my name shall assemble themselves together and pray then I will hear from Heaven that's the god I want to see this morning infallible realities of the Living God

willing to live for it but die for it Hallelujah are you ready to die for it are you ready to put your life on the line are you ready to hang your soul on the words of the son of man I am not ashamed

he shakes you off of his wings die or fly my brother you are ready to die for it you are going to flop your wings you are going to exercise your faith Hallelujah because because this is what you were called for this is why you are here that's why you an eagle you were given two wings to fly above the storm Hallelujah an eagle does not run away from the storm you remember the prophet there was a storm in the woods and he was going to get lost and he couldn't find his way back to the camp and he got panicked and he said but I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure this is the tri the trail that I used to follow I should just follow follow this road and then he came back and the storm was ready and he got lost and he got tired tired of trying with his own understanding that's why the Bible says lean not to thy own understanding Hallelujah the prophet says what must I do Lord please help me I'm lost I just can't find my way and the blizzard is already falling what must I do the voice spoke to him say go back into the stor because he was an eagle you are an eagle you are going to Fly Through Your Storm you are not running away from the storm you are not running away from problems let them fight us let them dispute let them do what they want but you are an eagle Eagle Eye flies above the storm set your wings set your wings set your wings be Reckless be Fearless no storm will uproot you no storm will block you out no storm will erase your name from the book Hallelujah there is no storm that is going to shake you until you get out now my brother you belong in this Kingdom it's the kingdom of the word of God hallelujah a deceived Church by the word I don't care if you have to stand alone with nobody but God alone I will preach the truth of God's Bible and I will stand for it if I die I still stand for the truth certainly we want truth I'll measure up not according to the church but according to the word of God I want to measure up Hallelujah am and he says proving his word don't you see my brother in Shadows stop here a minute you may be seated the prophet says in the last days amen there's got to be a place prepared for the word to be made manifest and we are now living by the evidence of the new land amen the son of man who is the son of man the Lord Jesus Christ he is the new land we are living by the evidence because Jesus came he died and we died with him in the message identification we had to be we went with him to Gethsemane we went through Calvary we died with him we went into the tomb we rose with him and as he lifted up on the third day as he went up he sent down the Holy Spirit which is the down payment which is the down payment of your Redemption Hallelujah the other half of the Chinese ticket you have it in your pocket you can't just sit still my brother that's the reason why you have come to these meetings Hallelujah you need a Revival Hallelujah the son of man is here and he's giving out the Holy Spirit to whosoever will it's yours it's yours the land is good the land is real the land is here hallelujah the Holy Ghost the person of Christ Hallelujah you may be seated now in the message total Deliverance amen the prophet says tell us if you are a Christian God does not make halfway Christians God makes complete Christians God Don't Make halfway preachers but the preacher can be halfway if he wants to and God makes his children Christians did you notice Christians not message Believers but sometimes they are halfway Christians but it's not God's intention for them to be that halfway it's their own ways that God mixed up with the plan of God for their life and that's what makes them to be halfway now the the prophet say all that was in God Kos he emptied it in Christ all that was in Christ he emptied it into the church why would you just hold on for one gift when the whole gift giv the Holy Spirit be abundance until your cup overflows why would you be a Halfway Christian why would you be limping in the presence of the one that can strengthen you why would you be a cried Christian why would you still have your crutches why will you just be hanging by the way because we have the full word the word is restored we can now walk upon the waters of the word of God we can challenge the enemy upon any ground because perfect Faith Masters all circumstances [Applause] Hallelujah so they got mixed up with the program of God those halfway preachers compromising on every side but God wants you to be completely standing in the preach on the word expectations I love the word the holy spirit fs on the word of God Christians should always read their Bible it's food it's the word of God men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that's what the Christian lives on the word and the Holy Spirit loves the word and he's here to receive the word and if that word is in you that what the holy spirit is coming upon it's not so much of your body but it's the Redemption of your soul the Redemption of your spirit and the Redemption of the body Christ does all three Hallelujah now he says in three kinds of Believers you may be seated am that ought to be amen the achievement of every believer am this afternoon amen God is able to keep every word that he said he would do I don't care what denomination sayah if that gun is zeroed to the Target it will hit the target amen and I believe if a Believer is zeroed with the word of God it will hit the same thing amen he says if the word of God ever promised anything it will do it again I am fully persuaded of it that's the reason why I do believe that when that bride is called out and elected and set in The Book of Life there will come a sound from Heaven that will take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride that will take her from Earth into rapturing Grace God promised it Hallelujah so the prophet said there's a heaven Hallelujah and there's a little Jesus Christ who in that Heaven There is going to come in a body form one day to receive his church to himself no matter how the story seems old no matter what other people feel like I will still believe it to be the truth God said so and that's the believer's beliefs Hallelujah birth pain these men if they can pick up this and go out with it they can make more sense to it to bring it to a place you would I just want to lay the seed then I hope they make make it come to life amen now you remember in the message he you are a son and a daughter of God but you are living under your privilege you remember the prophet tells about that negro African slave the prophet says he had selfawareness that he was royalty material that's why in that camp this is my words now I'm just explaining to you he knew who he was he knew that back home his father was a king and he was a prince and he was a air to the throne although he was away from Papa and Mama in some foreign land in bondage in slavery where there was no signs no joy no nothing but what did he do he conducted himself as a priest Hallelujah I want to believe that black man he was black I will believe so and I want to believe he was from Africa from somewhere and I want to believe he was tall he was big he was strong he had shoulders he had shape he had everything but what did he do you didn't have to whep him Hallelujah you did not need to whep him he knew how to conduct himself although he was away from his kingdom he would just carry himself like a son of a king when they say rise he rise up when they say sit he sits and the other people they were getting the morale from him because he was giving them some strength some encouragement that what I want you to do my brother walk like a son of a king walk like a priest walk like a Son of God don't be under your privileges don't walk under your god-given privileges you are a son of God you were predestinated unto life Hallelujah that's the reason why the Holy Ghost is here to Quicken you to give you back everything that you lack Hallelujah the pill of fire everything that Moses lack was in the pill of fire anything whatsoever you need for your families for your children for yourself it's in the pill of fire Hallelujah [Applause] Hall so the prophet says no matter what the world says about it yes you as a member not of a church but you as a member of the body of Christ the prophet says you yes work to please God do everything you can to build the kingdom of God don't never separate it but build it together don't never divide it by denominational barriers don't let those little things that man has put up to come and separate Brotherhood then when that son do you realize the responsibility is upon you that's the reason why I came to the convention and I came to be identified because I need the Revival I want to be the Revival I am the worst Revival I'm going back with my Revival no man shall take it away from me I'm possessing it this is my land this is my promise this is my inheritance Hallelujah so I'm looking for the adoption Hallelujah the prophet says if the chure had brought a word to the father and told him that everything was fine this boy is a gallant man that he was zealous of the father's Kingdom and he's done all that he could to improve and embed the kingdom then this boy what we call is ready for the blessing of a child am amen that's adoption season the father taken him out into a public place and set him up before the public his same son that had been born in this same family years before all the time he was there but this time his characterall and his conduct had brought him into another office hallah that's your promise my brother don't be satisfied to be just a deacon don't be satisfied because you the title in the church because you have a position somewhere because people recognize you as such and such no my brother there's more land to possess and the land is open to all of us hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus hallelujah our characters should have us up into a place where we can be in an office to meet the crisis of this hour that we are in the prophet identifies that we are in an hour of Crisis what is Crisis danger what is danger trap what is trap confusion well what must we do there's a challenge there's a showdown which group is what for us young people we grew up with all of them and today we don't know which way they going what must we do must we follow this one must we follow that one no my brother for me and my house for me and my house for me and my house I'm coming back to the word of God hallelujah I'm coming back to the word of God and I will do my best I will do my best to love them to pray for them but I will keep my eyes on the Ark on the word of God all the time like an eagle Hallelujah so this is the hour of Crisis the father has taken him out amen and the prophet is asking amen will God answer in a time of Crisis amen and the prophet answers he will not only answer us in this hour of Crisis he will not just come down and say this one is right and this one is wrong you should have understood it from this day and this age and this time and this prophecy he won't do that not only that this is what God is going to do amen us tell us brother BR yes is asking will God answer in a Time of Crisis amen he will not only answer but he will make manifest in the time of Crisis if the people assembled together Hallelujah did we have some meetings did we assemble ourselves together around the seventh ther convention did God speak to us then what must I do do all you can to embed the kingdom do all you can to keep the unity do all you can to see the Revival do all you can to sustain the Church of God pray for your pastor pray for the ministers pray for the bride of Christ but keep your eyes open on the promised word of the hour because of the crisis Hallelujah no matter if two or three whatever it is pray there he said he would hear from Heaven this is my son and he received in the ceremony the rights in another word his name Hallelujah that's not your nature his name under the check would be just as good as the bank and his own father's name for he was a heir of all things Hallelujah I'm so glad that one of these great days God will come Hallelujah he will manifest his he will manifest his church we will be a to all things then God don't take great denominations apart but God takes individuals apart and he speaks with them he takes you apart and he speaks with you sometimes over in a closet when you feel led to go and you don't go then you've missed out that's what God will do he will call you aside one day and speak to you and tell you this is now the new office that you're coming into you are not just a bride member you are not just a church member but this is what I predestinated you for go ye out there and find The Lost Ones for my kingdom because the time is at end and we about to go but before we go we must tell our testimony Hallelujah so Caleb he questioned people before the prophet you may be seated he said we are well able to take it let's go and get it immediately it was a state of emergency he didn't want to waste time when the people were mourning and meming and saying Moses the land is real but they are giants Caleb qu in the people what we need today we need in this hour what we need is men to challenge the promise of God before the people God promised to pouring out of the a Pentecostal blessing in the last days I mean a real Pentecostal pour out and it's the time for it now so we are again at Kadesh Baria we must take our position we must go possess the land we can wello it sure we can do it what was it those coverly church members they were looking at the giant they were looking with the natural eye but Caleb and Joshua was looking into the promise of God I don't care how much the opposition they had how big the giant looked how big the faces looked they were looking to God's promise every man and woman tonight I would say this morning every man and woman who wants to go with God don't pay any attention what the world says whether we can or we cannot what I'm telling you it's the promise of God and that settles it God said so I like that when God says so it's settled I tell you tonight we've had a whole Hallelujah too many Pretenders pretences we've had a lot of makeup belief we've had a lot of stuff that went out for a sure certainly the devil always throw it out just to show you the counterfeit to scare the people but we've had false Pentecost false prophecies false stuff false rain we've had false this and false that but in the midst of it all there is a genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit and the genuine Pentecostal blessings again there's a genuine Divine Healing there's a genuine steer there's a genuine people and it's time for the match amen amen hallelujah so you've got a decision to make at Kadesh you have to stand and you speak for yourself you've got to come to a time of decision now I got permission to read this quote the pastor gave me permission and I'm going to read it to you it's a very bold quotation from the prophet message titled at Kadesh paragraph after 3138 just further down he says you've got to come to a time of decision that's right that's right you've got to come to a place amen where you have to decide for yourself this includes everything whether the church you belong to whether the city you live in whether the doctrine you align yourself behind it's your responsibility to check the word of God so let me read the quote to you you've got to come to a time of decision and if the pastor he says let me start it from 138 you've got a decision to make you see it stands much longer you are heart between two opinions why why isn't the church on fire why isn't the people packed out why why isn't great signs Among Us and wonders why don't lay it on the pastor it's you we've got a mixed multitude we've got people pulling this way we've got people pulling that way now comes the quot you've got to come to a time of decision if it's the pastor fire him get him out put somebody else who will take his place and preach you the promise of the hour Hallelujah if it's a deacon take him out of the deacon board put somebody else in his place that will take the place and preach you the word of God what are you going to do my brother God puts the responsibility upon you Hallelujah and this may be the time that you've got to make your decision you are either going to move up with God or stay with a dead Church you may have to make your decision now it's urgent so be Reckless be Fearless if my pastor doesn't believe it maybe God has not yet revealed it to him but for me and my house for me and my house we will serve the Lord we know the words of the son of man turning northward possess the promises the promise is unto you and your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call Christians Brothers the prophet is referring to you as Christians amen Christians Brothers Christians sisters we've been on this mountain long enough we've been around here on this mountain too long we've been on this denominational Mountain too long we've been out here 40 plus years oh my when there's Powers that's unknown we when the resources is untou my prayer is that God will help these business men to keep their heart as one that's right and if these ministers amen they don't want to do it God will raise up some other businessmen to do it with Hallelujah I like what the pastor says he's not the pastor to your soul he's only placed here to help you the Great is Christ himself you belong to no man you belong to Christ you are the bride of Christ he's coming back for you he's going to hunt you he's going to look for you he's going to restore you he's going to bring you back to your position to your adoption season hallelujah hallelujah hallu you been seated praise God man praise God and the prophet says coming together till the whole body of the Lord Jesus Christ stands up as one great unit of God then we will leave this mountain and go over possess some more land Hallelujah so even when you get there to the unity of the faith you don't stop there Hallelujah because there's only one Faith one Lord one baptism and we've been contending for this we were built up upon the foundations of the prophet and apostles Malachi 4 Ministry brought the children's back children's heart back to the Pentecostal fathers we took act 238 the Holy Ghost promised we walked with it from Revelation 10 to Ephesians 4 and now that we are in the Holy Ghost Land what do we have to do we contend for the unity we contend for brotherly love we contend for God's promise when the church find its place in Christ it's holy deive Hallelujah that's what we're contending for and even when we get there we don't stop we don't rest we continue to possess because there's more land there's more land to possess until you are perfect until you are formed in the word image and you look like Christ Christ Hallelujah you know what God thinks of you Hallelujah the prophet says you are diamonds amen diamonds from stones of Africa when you take that stone out it's full of impurity but that diamond needs to be cut it needs to be chopped it needs to be Hallelujah to go into a Crusher you've been through hell my brother you've been through all kind of doctrines all kind of churches all kind of Hallelujah but today you are going to reflect the light the Christ himself you are a cheap from that great Diamond who died on Calvary you are not some cheap stuff God selected you you may not be qualified but you are elected [Applause] hallelujah hallu hallelujah that's why he says God's provided approach to Divine Fellowship you cannot do that by your Creeds quids will never satisfy a hungry soul I don't know how much hungry you are never Hallelujah but you've got to be hungry for God you've got to have stamina you've got to be self motivated you've got to be enthused in South Africa we say you've got to have vmer Hallelujah you need vmer you need a power you need something behind you you need a backbone Hallelujah some vmer man Hallelujah you need vmer the power of God and there's a power behind every promise of God for the bride hallelujah hallelujah hallah so don't look down upon yourself listen to this quotation will encourage you convinced and concerned amen you say brother Bram I'm the least in the church all right I'm just a little bit bitty fellow amen but remember when he ascended on high see you are raised with him you are in the body and you are with Christ right now seated in Heavenly places now listen to this if you are the skin on the bottom of his feet every devil is still under your feet Hallelujah you see this is the body there's a hand there's a leg there's a head there's the eye whichever place in the body of Christ I occupied as long as he ascended on high I was lifted up with him and if the devil gives me mind battles and tells me I'm not good enough because I'm still struggling with this and still struggling with that never mind let's say I'm the skin underneath his foot Hallelujah wherever the body goes the whole body goes if the head goes left the whole body moves left if the head moves right the whole body moves right so if the head moves into Perfection the whole body moves into Perfection every day devil is under your feet Satan is defeated your enem is defeated he's under your feet that should give you a jump [Applause] Hallelujah that's right exactly right the church where the head is the body is with it and if we are buried we died we buried in Christ then we are raised with him in his resurrection and we are sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus with every every fire of Hell under our feet amen amen every fire of Hell whether it's the demon of last whether it's a demon of whatever mind battles whatever name it everything is under your feet Hallelujah no matter how little you are every devil is under your feet you are our great conqueror has conquered every sin everything every sickness even death itself was conquered that's right so we are more than conquerors that's why we must be Reckless that's why we must be Fearless in faith Hallelujah only thing we are seated with him in his throne looking to him as he looks over the father that's right that's all there is amen and he says perfect Faith Masters all circumstances what soever situation you find yourself in perfect Faith Masters it Hallelujah whether it's a room of sickness whether it's a room of unbelief whether it's room of whatever perfect Faith Masters every circumstances every circumstances I want you to put your situation there I want to put a difficulty there because Malachi 4 says we receive perfect Faith perfect faith is produced by the seven Thunder and perfect Faith Masters every circumstances and if you have perfect Faith it's based upon forgiveness that's why we love one another that's why we holding shoulder Tosh shoulder that's why we keeping our eyes on Jesus Hallelujah perfect Faith Masters all circumstances you may be seated Hallelujah hall hallelujah Hall Glory praise God praise God now the scripture we read tell us I will tell you about it amen Gus amen there was a man in the Bible a little fellow and a nice man he was a family man let's say he was a pastor let's say he was a priest let's say he was from a certain church but in some ring up he was was a secret believer amen and his name was gyrus gyrus means the one who shares the light or it means Jehovah enlightens so he had some little bit of light in him but he was ashamed he was afraid to take a stand as a man of God amen hallelujah amen I believe he was a nice fellow and many times when we judge people we judge them by their actions and sometimes we we don't judge the heart we don't know so gyrus he wanted to be identified with Christ but he belonged to the club of the association of the Ministers of the day he was given a badge and a bowl of soup he had a lot to sacrifice to come out and show where he stands he had no backbone he had a wishbone whatsoever they tell him to do because his name was put in the church book he was scared to step out Hallelujah so this man he was told that if he goes to the meetings of Jesus Christ that Divine healer he will be put out of the synagogue and little Jos I would imagine down in his heart he didn't want to be a secret believer he didn't want to be a borderline believer he didn't want to be just on on the bench he wanted to make sure that he could step out but he had so many ties so many things were hindering hisi hallelujah hallelujah amen praise God and he says Thank You Lord he just could not make his decision hallelujah or else his paycheck would not come you know a man like that Hallelujah the prophet says soon or later God will bring you to a showdown Hallelujah God knows how to work it out so don't worry about your love ones that are not here with you God is interested in every name that is found written in the Lamb's Book of Life and that's Michael's duty to redeem every seed to call out every name no matter which church they belong to no matter which Fellowship they go to sooner or later God will bring them to a showdown and there's going to be a showdown for you there's going to be a showdown for me but I don't know how hard it going to be but all I'm interested to know by the grace of God we going to make it we're going to take a stand after we've done all there is to stand we shall stand therefore Hallelujah so gyus wanted to follow Christ into the present stage of his ministry which was the third phase which was the seventh standard gives Faith which was the certain sound which was the words of Malachi 4 which was seven Thunders will reveal itself in the last days and give the church rapturing Faith gyus wanted to believe it he wanted to step on it this is the sound of the trumpet we heard blown from Malachi 4 this is the doctrine we've been taught upon Jus knew the truth but he was scared to take a stand afraid to be identified afraid to preach a certain thing amen afraid to say what Malachi 4 says poor little gyus and he was a pastor of a church can you imagine he had no choice he was obligated to compromise convention in convention out meeting in meeting out Hallelujah he was just in between not so sure Amen on we are going to strike his name now strike that's what they are saying the prophet say Jesus all along knew that this is his position and this is where he stands but Jesus wanted to give gyrus an opportunity to express his belief Hallelujah you are going to express what you believe you don't need to debate now my brother but the interpretation or the manifestation of the son of man's words will be the interpret ation of the word of the hour for the quest of the hour and you will be Vindicated by him who sent you who called you who predestinated you hallelujah hallelujah so what what did he do God took him between a rock and a hard place for his Showdown and sometimes God will do that gyus did not know how to show what believes on Amen but he just lingered and followed along and clapped his hand and felt condemned sometimes and join this club and come out of it but one day God who knows all about it began to deal with him and all that he had for his life you see when it comes to your personal household brother you are not ready to compromise you are not ready to play games because this is what is your inheritance Gideon say oh shamai I think it was I'm not going to give my Harvest again to this Philistine for my family to starve for six more months no so gyus only had one child am a little beautiful young girl 12 years old amen and she got sick amen hallelujah and that's how or that's what God used to to get his attention so that he can stop looking on men he can stop belonging to a cloud he can stop having a hand of fellowship or Association but he would step forth and identify with the word and the crisis of the hour hallelujah hallelujah so gyrus started to develop a complex amen you know sitting at home watching tapes saying I'm having church I'm just as good as the one that goes to church he was afraid to join this group because there's too many stories if I go there what will they say if I go to this convention what will they say chrus started now to have his own church in the house you see brother Bram says ever present water it's a joy to go to church under any circumstances whether it's hot whether it's cold whether it's indifferent whether the people are fing whether the people are growing whatever they are doing it's still a joy to hear the word of God from the pulit because you are in love with God that's why you go to church God wants you to go to church in the message here him God wants to manifest something to you that's why he wants you to come to church and listen to the preacher Hallelujah discernment of the spirit every man ought to have a church home you ought to have a place not just floating about from Pillar To Post but have somewhere that you go to church and you call it your church somewhere where you pay your ties and somewhere that you help support the cause Hallelujah so come on gyus come out of your hiding place just come open God is interested in you step to the church sometime step to the church sometimes come on Thursday come on Wednesday come on Sunday God might have something for you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you see God is going to use every excuse which is preventing you to be identified in order to deal with you amen and deal with your heart if that's the only excuse you've got well God will come deal with you through that very excuse that you using to keep yourself as a box leader you may be so that you may be at your post of Duty because you are a soldier you are a citizen to this Kingdom you're supposed to sit there and amen the word but you are hiding going this way going that way and God is going to use your excuse now God is coming to the house of gyrus and he's coming to to give him a test amen and that's what God did amen and what did he do amen the musician may come I wish I had part two hallelu amen am amen but I won't mind to visit you again in [Applause] Tad I'll leave the other stuff for some other time time flies we're doing well amen so gyrus had a daughter yes she got sick that's right there something nice brother and when his daughter got sick the most sensible thing gyrus knew what to do was to call a doctor all along he was a secret believer he knew where to find faith for the healing of his child because the crisis of the hour the prophet says at the end time the end time message has to meet the end time condition that's right so the crisis of the hour Jesus Christ was on the land doing miracles on the other side of the lake chus knew about it because he was in the association of the claps of the ministers so he knew what that Ministry was doing he heard about the signs and wonders but he was caught up so what did he do he calls the doctor the doctor comes looks at the child says chus losing quick the child is getting weak but I will come back tomorrow he gave them some wet cloth put on the child the next day he came the child was getting worse by the day child up until then wouldn't decide amen second day the doctor comes on his Chariot he looks at gyus he looks at the child he examined the child he says gyus I need to tell you something he calls gyrus to the side as a gentleman he say gyus you know better your child is losing ground fast I must prepare you for a shock this is what the devil will do when you live under your privileges when you are afraid to take God at his word when you are HID behind some group some men some Family Ties some family relations my child my daughter my husband my in-laws because of that God will use that excuse and get you on a rock and a hard place to deal with your heart Hallelujah the doctor is preparing him for a shock he says gyus the most sensible thing you should do amen is to prepare your wife go back there tell her anytime from now the child will die amen amen so I'm leaving and I won't come back but prepare your wife and prepare yourself for a funeral service you see a messenger of death brings with him death news but this messenger of life has brought to us good news and the good news is the gospel even now there's a possibility Hallelujah so when it comes down to your house to your Char to your soul brother you going to have some backbone even if you had a wishbone this time you just not going to do that you won't take it for granted so gyrus said Doctor I appreciate you honest man thank you for telling me the facts and the truth according to your science according to what you believe according to all that you know according to what you've studied I appreciate it goodbye amen now remember I said me and my house we are in the House of gyrus today gyrus now sits on the corner he says I just don't take the doctor's words for it I can't just go by the doctor's report this is my child now that little bit of life or light that he had began to move in his heart something begin to remind him what about Jesus Hallelujah I pray that this morning something begins to come upon your heart and reminds you what about the God of William BR what about the indiaan meetings what about the South Africa meetings what about those prayer line in every tape that you listen to Hallelujah we want reality of the Living God we want to see God for ourselves if someone else sees it he will tell us we might not have enough Faith but when God opens your eyes and you receive your Miracle then you know you are in condition for your own changing of the Body for the Holy Ghost to possess the land so gyus says I don't believe the doctor's report I refuse the doctor's report I'm going to take the word of God all along this word was inside of him but it needed some wings it needed some help so gyus calls his wife he says Wifey this is the doctor's report amen he said the doctor is dying soon amen this is my report I don't believe what the doctor says but tell me what is your report hallelujah what is your report what is your report some times gyus was afraid to leave that Association and that club because the wife was considered as a presti lady her dressing code and other thing that she had access to so she said to him before shus if you go to that group people will look down on us because you know we are that class of clergy so I don't want you to mix with that Jesus but this time it was serious it was a crisis it was a aair so gyus say I have my own testimony I have the doctor's testimony I want to hear your testimony because I want to get the house under the condition for miracles Hallelujah so Jus say for me and my house my daughter is dying she's almost dead and the doctor is left and I am the man of the house I've got some backbone behind me I've got some power I've got some hope so what am I going to do wife tell me what you think it's so strange the way women change their opinion just like this just like this the very same lady who was so happy to see gyes in the clubs of associations of the synagogue the very same lady Hallelujah my sister don't worry even at that time of Crisis you will be identifying with what the word of God says about you the wife said you know what gyus even me all along I always believed that Jesus is the one to come to the world and save us and you know what I was talking to sister so and so she was at a certain convention and Jesus was having a healing campaign and there was a woman who had a blood issue who touched the Hem of His Garment and that woman was healed Hallelujah so gyrus I'm telling you I believe I believe this is my report I believe gyus fith muscle begin to move gyus say oh Lord just once more oh Lord my house is in order your house is going to be restored [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah just about that time someone was running from the banks hey people Jesus of Nazareth has landed here Jesus was on the other side of Galilee he crossed the lake because God showed him a vision he had need to come to this side as soon as he reached the banks there's a woman with a blood issue who touches the Hem of His Garment and he looks around while Jesus is busy having this revival a runner goes fast to tell you know what he's on our right he's on our banks Jesus is here this morning he's here for you gyus Jesus is here to heal you the wife says gyus let me fix your jacket take the donkey run fast don't even stop at any churches don't even stop with any group don't even stop to the Char hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah ch's wife she knew what to do she prepared a donkey she PA the jacket she said my brother this is your Bible come on Rush you want me to help you with your shoes this is your socks take it make fast make fast I don't want to lose my daughter I don't want to lose my daughter gyus make fast Hallelujah and gyus he ran with the best rain he could run with he used all his strength because his house was in a condition he was going to Jesus there was so many hindrances people say Jus what are you doing are you going down there to that convention you might not come back hallelujah hallelujah chus did not pay attention to it they said but gyus we are going to cancel your name from the book and you know what it means you'll be lost say you mean to tell me brother that you believe that am say you might as well take it off because now the chist is serious the chist is is serious I just can't listen to you anymore there coming a showdown my brother that's why I want you to come to Jesus I want you to come to him and him alone has the cure for your problem him alone knows how to strengthen out what has wrong in your life him alone can give you total Deliverance you don't have to be Halfway Christian so gyus got to Jesus and when he got there he first acknowledged that he is Lord and he called him my Lord he bowed down he worshiped him he said my Lord my daughter is even now dead but I want you to come because I still believe because faith has been restored there's only one faith I have contended although I was hiding although I was pretending but this time for real for Showdown I believe if you come lay hands she will live do you believe it this morning Jesus is here he wants to heal you he wants to give you a testimony receive your healing receive your healing touch the H of his government God bless you Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh
