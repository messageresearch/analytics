[11:36] ask it email and amen
[11:39] god bless you saints and
[11:41] uh i'll be doing the bible study tonight
[11:45] um by god's grace and i'm
[11:47] blessed
[11:48] to have you all here
[11:50] and um
[11:51] tonight i want to give
[11:54] my title first
[11:56] and a title that i have is faithful and
[11:58] little
[11:59] faithful and much
[12:02] productivity a biblical perspective
[12:05] so the night we want to sort of talk
[12:07] about productivity
[12:09] um or being fruitful
[12:11] about
[12:13] how god sees this thing called
[12:14] productivity
[12:16] and um so you want to get straight into
[12:18] it
[12:20] i don't want to say i won't be alone
[12:23] but is a a small lesson tonight
[12:26] and let's begin
[12:30] from the very beginning
[12:32] god
[12:33] created man to be productive
[12:36] by giving
[12:37] this command in genesis 1 28.
[12:41] this is the scripture here now and god
[12:42] bless them
[12:43] and god said unto them
[12:45] be fruitful
[12:47] and multiply
[12:49] and replenish the earth
[12:51] and subdue it
[12:53] and have dominion over the fish of the
[12:55] sea over the fall of the ear
[12:57] and over every living thing
[13:00] that move it upon the earth
[13:02] so god
[13:04] never intended man to be in a static
[13:06] position
[13:08] a position controlled by the environment
[13:11] like we might say this happened to me
[13:14] that is external
[13:15] it's because of this one that is why
[13:17] again external
[13:20] we miss
[13:21] it is not what happened to us
[13:25] it is our always our response to what's
[13:28] happened to us
[13:31] let me say it again
[13:32] it's not what happened to us
[13:34] it's our response
[13:36] to what happened to us as you hear that
[13:39] i'm
[13:40] taught that
[13:41] god doesn't condemn the sinner for being
[13:43] a sinner
[13:45] because
[13:46] the condemnation comes from not wanting
[13:48] to get out of the sin
[13:50] because sinner
[13:52] sins that's what the sinner does
[13:56] so
[13:58] that
[14:00] static position
[14:01] that we find ourselves sometimes in is
[14:03] not really ordained of god
[14:06] god wants us to be
[14:08] and and this was the word he gave to
[14:10] adam
[14:12] in genesis was to subdue
[14:14] and it would subdue the calm
[14:16] pacified soothe
[14:18] and have dominion
[14:20] which is to reign over dominate
[14:22] or to make it your territory
[14:25] to have dominion over
[14:28] so it is as if man
[14:30] was supposed to be in a position
[14:33] that the not the external control him
[14:35] but he actually dominate the external
[14:39] environment and circumstance
[14:42] today productivity is measured or
[14:44] defined
[14:45] by getting the life you want
[14:47] be unsuccessful to fulfill your dreams
[14:52] but
[14:54] it's in god's picture it's a little
[14:56] different it's not about you it's not
[14:58] about
[14:58] fulfilling your dreams and ambitions and
[15:01] so on like that
[15:02] but i'm seeing it as if god we
[15:05] listen listen closely
[15:07] we are god deposit on the earth
[15:10] or his investment on the good
[15:13] and he's looking for a return on his
[15:15] investment
[15:17] how we would see that by the text that
[15:19] we're going to reach the text we want to
[15:20] get to
[15:22] we need to be good
[15:24] stewards that stewardess custodian
[15:27] guardian keeper stewards of our time
[15:31] our gifts
[15:33] and talents
[15:36] life is too short to waste
[15:41] redeem the time
[15:43] bring glory to god note the emphasis
[15:47] bring
[15:48] glory to god
[15:50] by restructuring
[15:52] your life our lives in doing good
[15:55] and in serving others
[15:58] that would repeat it
[16:00] i'll say this way you can bring glory to
[16:03] god
[16:05] by restructuring your life
[16:08] in doing good
[16:10] and serving others
[16:12] the hebrews 10 24
[16:14] shares with us
[16:16] and let us consider one another
[16:19] to provoke
[16:20] unto love and to good works
[16:23] that would provoke is to incite
[16:26] aggravate
[16:28] to arouse is not a deadness
[16:31] the voc is not well you know i see it no
[16:34] it's taken sign it's the aggravate
[16:38] it's the arouse
[16:40] question
[16:42] how do you allocate your time
[16:45] question
[16:47] how do you use your gifts
[16:49] and talents
[16:52] what you do
[16:53] now
[16:54] and how you do it now
[16:57] does it bring honor
[16:59] and glory to god
[17:02] so when we speak about productivity
[17:05] we're not talking about professional and
[17:07] business folks
[17:09] we are talking about christians
[17:12] believers
[17:13] in all walks of life
[17:15] you eat a housewife
[17:17] a janitor
[17:18] a gardener
[17:20] a business owner owner
[17:23] because jesus
[17:25] give himself for us
[17:27] that we can become productive
[17:31] maybe you never appeared like that way
[17:33] before
[17:34] but listen to titus and this is titus
[17:37] chapter 2
[17:39] verse 11 to 15
[17:41] and it reads
[17:43] for the grace of god if you want you
[17:46] could find this titus 2
[17:48] verse 11 to 15 don't read it
[17:51] i'll read it first in the
[17:53] uh king james and then i'll go the
[17:54] amplified
[17:56] for the grace of god it bring it
[17:58] salvation had appeared to all men
[18:01] teaching us
[18:02] that denying ungodliness
[18:06] and worldly lust
[18:07] we should live soberly
[18:09] righteously and godly in this present
[18:11] world
[18:12] looking for that blessed hope
[18:15] and the glorious appearing of the great
[18:17] god and of our savior
[18:19] jesus christ
[18:21] who give himself for us here we go
[18:24] that he might redeem us
[18:26] from all iniquity
[18:28] so let's go again who give himself for
[18:31] us
[18:32] that he might redeem us
[18:34] from all iniquity
[18:36] one
[18:37] and purify unto himself
[18:40] a peculiar people
[18:43] zealous of good words
[18:45] these things speak
[18:48] and exhort
[18:50] and rebuke with all authority
[18:53] let no man despise thee
[18:57] and we want to read that in the
[18:58] amplified
[19:00] uh i read from the team awaiting and
[19:02] looking for the fulfillment
[19:04] the realization of our blessed hope
[19:06] even the glorious
[19:08] appearing of our great god and savior
[19:11] christ jesus the messiah
[19:13] the anointed one
[19:16] who gave himself on our behalf
[19:19] that he might redeem us
[19:22] purchase our freedom from all iniquity
[19:26] and purify for himself a people
[19:29] to be peculiar
[19:32] his own people who are eager
[19:35] and
[19:36] enthusiastic about living a life
[19:40] that is good
[19:42] and filled
[19:43] with beneficial deeds
[19:46] so i want you to notice tonight
[19:48] that jesus said die for us to just leave
[19:51] here he died
[19:54] that we can be witnesses on this earth
[19:56] by living such a life
[19:59] that that glorifies him
[20:01] that's the object of this whole
[20:04] redemption and pain the blood price that
[20:07] we could hear you know and it always
[20:10] touches me
[20:11] uh when i hear jesus words i come that
[20:13] you might have life and have it more
[20:16] abundantly
[20:17] in other words he didn't come for us to
[20:19] exist
[20:20] he didn't come very hanging in there no
[20:23] he said come that you might have life
[20:26] and have it more abundantly that's why i
[20:28] appreciate the exhortation from the
[20:30] prophet sunday do not be worried do not
[20:33] be fearful but you want to put your feet
[20:36] and trust in the lord amen praise the
[20:39] lord
[20:40] now
[20:41] he said enough if i tell all these
[20:42] things urge advice encourage warn and
[20:45] rebuke with full authority let no man
[20:48] did not let no one
[20:50] despise
[20:52] or disregard or think little of you
[20:55] conduct yourself on your teaching so as
[20:57] to command respect
[20:59] now
[21:01] so the next scripture
[21:03] is what i want to call a key soon
[21:05] keystone scripture
[21:07] in regards to being productive
[21:10] it is like an anchor point this
[21:12] scripture which is matthew 5 16.
[21:16] and this is jesus speaker
[21:18] and
[21:19] this
[21:20] confronts all of us
[21:23] all of us
[21:25] listen to jesus one word in matthew 5 16
[21:28] and i wish had pen and paper and you
[21:29] could write on the scriptures i guess
[21:31] maybe you'll put it
[21:32] out on on whatsapp that you could look
[21:35] back at the scriptures we we have here
[21:38] but jesus said here
[21:40] let your light
[21:42] so shine before men
[21:44] that they may see your good works
[21:47] and glorify
[21:49] your father which is in heaven
[21:52] emphasis
[21:54] so shine
[21:55] not light shine but let your light so
[21:59] shine before men
[22:02] now they may see one
[22:04] your good works
[22:06] not bad works
[22:08] not crazy books you have good works
[22:10] and
[22:11] glorify your father which is them
[22:13] in the amplified it says let your light
[22:16] so shine before men that they may see
[22:18] your moral excellence
[22:20] and your praiseworthy
[22:23] noble
[22:24] and good deeds and recognize and honor
[22:28] and praise and glorify your father who's
[22:30] in heaven
[22:32] so shine
[22:33] so shine that your good deeds would
[22:36] bring honor
[22:37] and praise
[22:39] and glorify your father
[22:42] so by doing good to others
[22:45] you are actually bringing glory to him
[22:48] we still ain't get all our substances
[22:50] text us yet but we we're gonna get there
[22:53] or we you're here
[22:55] praise god i hope you are blessed
[22:57] tonight and you are
[22:58] uh working with us tonight and going
[23:00] with us tonight
[23:01] and we want to turn into a bible so this
[23:03] is our main text tonight and it's just
[23:05] going to be read on sunday matthew 25
[23:08] who's 14 to 30 second revival i like to
[23:10] turn to that by matthew 25 verse 14 to
[23:13] 30 and
[23:15] you know what is interesting is that
[23:17] this was right after
[23:19] a parable of the 10 virgins jesus gave
[23:23] this parable
[23:24] right after the ten veterans he
[23:26] presented this now remember with the
[23:28] virgins
[23:29] um
[23:30] there was wise and foolish he identified
[23:32] them as good people nice people
[23:34] sanctified people one person want to get
[23:37] the oil the other just the oil ran out
[23:40] it's not that they didn't have oil what
[23:42] they had actually ran out
[23:45] the prophet used these words
[23:46] they they missed the wisdom of
[23:48] revelation to catch the open door to
[23:52] receive the holy ghost that knowledge
[23:53] information but miss
[23:55] your revelation to touch
[23:57] the open door
[23:59] okay let's go
[24:00] this is our substantive text tonight
[24:02] from matthew 25 reading from verse 14 to
[24:05] 30.
[24:07] jesus speaking isn't read
[24:09] for the kingdom of heaven is as a man
[24:11] traveling into a far country
[24:14] who called his own servants
[24:16] and delivered unto them his goods
[24:19] and onto one he gave five talents
[24:22] to another two
[24:24] to another one to every man
[24:26] according to his several abilities
[24:28] straight we took his journey
[24:31] then
[24:33] he that received five talents went
[24:36] and traded with the same and made them
[24:38] an other five dollars
[24:40] likewise he doesn't receive two
[24:42] you also gain
[24:44] other two he that received one
[24:48] went and digged in the earth and hid his
[24:50] lord's money
[24:52] after a long time
[24:54] the lord of those servants comment and
[24:57] recommend with them so right here in
[25:01] verse 19
[25:02] is where you see
[25:04] there will come an accountant for the
[25:07] gifts
[25:08] here we go
[25:09] talent
[25:11] that you have been given i think that
[25:14] would repeat it
[25:17] there will come
[25:18] a time of recognition
[25:22] of what
[25:23] you have done
[25:25] with your time with your gifts
[25:30] with your talents
[25:33] who's twenty
[25:35] so he
[25:36] that had received five talents came and
[25:38] brought other five talents saying lord
[25:41] dog delivers unto me five talents behold
[25:44] i have gained besides them
[25:47] five
[25:49] talents more
[25:50] so this was presentation time
[25:53] this was a time when he could present
[25:54] the point and say here what lord you
[25:57] give me five i have another fight to
[25:59] show you what i have done
[26:00] with what you give me
[26:02] verse 22.
[26:04] he also that had received two talents
[26:06] came and said lord
[26:09] thou deliver us unto me two talents
[26:12] behold
[26:13] i have gained
[26:14] two other talents besides them
[26:18] his lord censored him
[26:20] well done or i skipped something
[26:23] okay i did
[26:24] yeah
[26:25] from five his lord senator tim bishop is
[26:27] 21 sorry well done though good and
[26:29] faithful servant
[26:31] dao has been faithful over a few things
[26:35] i will make the ruler over many things
[26:39] now this is
[26:40] very powerful
[26:42] and
[26:43] as i announced my title faithfulness it
[26:45] feels much
[26:47] now
[26:50] it's
[26:50] impressive
[26:52] the analysis
[26:54] that is presented here
[26:56] in what was done
[26:58] this man and his own accord
[27:01] his master didn't tell him do it
[27:03] he didn't write a memo a note a letter
[27:06] on his own accord he took the five
[27:07] talents
[27:08] invested it traded it and got another
[27:11] five
[27:12] and the lord pronounced one
[27:15] you have been faithful over a few
[27:18] i will make you a ruler over many
[27:20] enter into the joy of the lord
[27:23] verse 22 he also that received returns
[27:26] came and said lord thou deliver us unto
[27:28] me two talents
[27:30] behold i have gained two other talents
[27:32] besides them
[27:33] his lord said unto him well done but
[27:35] unfaithful servant has been faithful
[27:37] over a few things
[27:39] i will make the ruler over many things
[27:41] enter into the joy
[27:43] of the lord
[27:44] that he which had received the one
[27:47] talent came and said lord i knew thee
[27:49] the doubt a hard man
[27:52] reaping where dog has not sown
[27:55] and gathering the dog was not stored
[27:58] so maybe this guy wasn't even minding
[28:00] his own business
[28:01] he was 25 but i was afraid and i
[28:04] went so he's in his emotions and went
[28:07] and hid that talent in the low
[28:10] dear dog
[28:12] that is done
[28:14] his lord answered and said unto him what
[28:16] you deserve and though wicked and
[28:18] slugful civil
[28:20] don't know us that i reap where i swore
[28:23] and gathered where i have not struggled
[28:26] though orders therefore to have put my
[28:28] money to the exchanges and then at my
[28:30] coming so watch how jesus freezed it at
[28:34] my comment i should have received my own
[28:36] with usury and not using his interests
[28:39] take therefore the talent from him
[28:41] and give it unto him which had ten times
[28:45] for unto everyone that had
[28:47] shall be given
[28:49] and he shall have abundance
[28:51] but from him that had not
[28:53] shall be taken away even that which he
[28:55] had
[28:56] and cast ye
[28:58] the unprofitable servant into all the
[29:01] darkness
[29:02] there shall be weapon
[29:04] and nash of teeth
[29:06] so friends
[29:08] this
[29:09] is
[29:10] serious all of us
[29:13] had been given time
[29:16] gifts
[29:17] and talents
[29:18] that were repeated
[29:20] all of us have been given time
[29:23] gifts and talents
[29:25] gifts and calling are without repentance
[29:27] you're born with it
[29:29] god has gifted you
[29:31] god has blessed you
[29:33] and is your choice to waste it
[29:36] lose it
[29:38] use it
[29:39] surrender it to him
[29:41] all of that is your choice
[29:43] he is not forcing anyone the bible
[29:46] plainly states there between a bed
[29:48] one taking one life
[29:51] there has to be something about that one
[29:54] being thing
[29:55] it has to be something about why that
[29:57] other one was left
[29:59] i think where isaac can we keep speaking
[30:01] about it
[30:03] about being prepared
[30:05] now
[30:06] all what we are talking about has
[30:07] nothing to do with
[30:09] going to church
[30:11] this have to do with
[30:13] what is expected of you
[30:15] as a christian
[30:17] as a believer
[30:18] as a housewife as a father as a as a
[30:21] brother
[30:22] so let your light shine
[30:26] that men may see your good works
[30:29] because we're not supposed to have bad
[30:30] works because we come out of that to be
[30:33] coming to christ
[30:35] that men may see of good works
[30:37] and glorify the father heaven note what
[30:39] he says you because you are facing
[30:41] little things
[30:43] and you know how the human being is
[30:46] we have ambition we want big things and
[30:48] we want big things no big things fast
[30:50] big things immediately
[30:51] and when we get the little things
[30:53] we mess up
[30:55] and if you cannot manage
[30:57] you cannot account
[30:59] you cannot handle the little that god
[31:02] gives you
[31:03] how
[31:04] could you be given much
[31:07] it can't
[31:08] work
[31:09] it does not work
[31:11] it cannot work it's impossible for it
[31:15] and that is why you know i remember
[31:17] something
[31:18] i remember
[31:20] my wife had a testimony concerning this
[31:21] message
[31:22] when she had received the message she
[31:24] liked you know
[31:25] covering your knees
[31:27] and
[31:28] not cutting your hair and the life
[31:30] around the message was what was
[31:31] attractive to her
[31:33] and she had a battle to come to church
[31:36] and she had 55 brothers and my mother
[31:39] just passed the radio
[31:40] and
[31:42] and she has a battle to come to service
[31:44] with a whole battle and my mother's done
[31:46] it before she got a tissue after cook
[31:48] so she has to wash brother's clothes
[31:50] without any reward and she did all of
[31:52] that and she was telling me
[31:54] uh you know
[31:56] years later about
[31:58] what it taught her because she wanted to
[32:01] come to church
[32:03] she
[32:04] had to cook
[32:06] and that's how she ended up learning to
[32:08] cook because you want to go to church
[32:10] nothing must stop us if this is oh i get
[32:12] a church i'm going to cook before i go
[32:14] to i'm going to cook
[32:15] she has to wash the clothes without
[32:17] reward
[32:18] and you know what she said she learned
[32:20] she learned to work hard
[32:22] now
[32:24] what if she was laid back
[32:26] what if she was lazy
[32:28] what if she was full
[32:30] she may not have met me
[32:33] this is my point
[32:35] whatever was in her
[32:37] pushing her
[32:38] to get to service to get to the lord and
[32:41] so on is because god was rearranging
[32:44] things
[32:45] and and sometimes
[32:48] that's why i think i said it sunday when
[32:50] you work harder than you're getting paid
[32:52] eventually you'll get more p than you're
[32:54] working for you see so so people shun
[32:58] work
[32:59] they shun
[33:00] the the backbone of things but you see
[33:03] she was preparing for future life
[33:06] you see because there's work to be done
[33:08] and if you cannot handle
[33:12] the task presented to you in a small
[33:15] form how you'll handle it how big a
[33:18] stuff there
[33:19] so that is why you see
[33:21] little shops remain little shops for
[33:23] years
[33:25] and that is why we see people that are
[33:27] not changing
[33:29] because they have the same thoughts
[33:32] the same friends
[33:34] the same circle
[33:36] and there is nothing new coming within
[33:38] their zone
[33:39] so they think the same way speak the
[33:42] same way live the same way act the same
[33:44] way and
[33:45] go
[33:46] to church
[33:49] and they remain as they are and age
[33:53] so they're not really growing they're
[33:54] getting old
[33:56] to grow is not to get old
[33:58] let me say that many times
[34:00] to grow
[34:01] is to listen
[34:02] let me repeat that
[34:04] to grow is not to get old
[34:07] they are all people that has not grown
[34:10] our inch
[34:11] they just get old in their ways
[34:14] all in their thinking all in their
[34:16] behavior and attitude
[34:18] what the ghost become is to bring about
[34:21] change
[34:22] as we say pain could come to your life
[34:25] and it could be just be that pain oh
[34:27] gosh
[34:30] it's not working out for me this door
[34:31] closed and i'm based on this
[34:33] but pain come also to change people
[34:37] and it's how you interpret what comes
[34:40] your way
[34:41] are you going to change
[34:43] or are you just going to stay in your
[34:45] pain nobody know the trouble i see yeah
[34:48] the way in trouble you see sometimes you
[34:50] get in your own truck
[34:51] but the point about is this
[34:53] is if you are learning from what you are
[34:56] going through if you are learning from
[34:58] the challenges that is before
[35:00] i remember one time in my job uh working
[35:02] in school
[35:04] and they bought a new machine
[35:06] and was you know a long time duplicator
[35:08] big machines and then papers and stuff
[35:12] and i said to myself oh it's not my
[35:14] business it's not my job secretary will
[35:15] do all these printing and stuff
[35:17] and i tell myself you know what i am not
[35:19] going to learn how to use that machine
[35:20] because they're going to put a set of
[35:22] work on me the print and to do this and
[35:24] do that
[35:26] and then
[35:27] when i thought about that
[35:30] and i retake it i say but but if i don't
[35:33] learn it i'll be ignorant of how to use
[35:34] it
[35:35] so you know what i want to live
[35:38] that was my choice
[35:40] now i could have docket and say well so
[35:41] anybody come and say could you do that i
[35:43] don't know i i don't know how to use the
[35:45] machine
[35:46] yeah that's the easy way out but
[35:48] there'll be a dance
[35:49] i wouldn't know how to use the machine
[35:51] i wanted to know how to use the machine
[35:53] it doesn't matter who want help or who
[35:55] want to print paper you
[35:57] have to want to learn
[36:00] to want to change there are too many
[36:03] people satisfied with themselves
[36:05] they're satisfied with how they are they
[36:07] have no ambition they have no drive they
[36:10] have nothing to spill them on
[36:13] and i hope
[36:14] that you see what god sees when go tell
[36:17] adam be fruitful and not decline adam
[36:19] feeding lead not to multiply near
[36:21] feeling left to be fruitful i don't find
[36:23] the garden so nice he could just relax
[36:24] itself and eat upland grapes no
[36:28] there's a commission behind everything
[36:30] there's our order behind everything
[36:32] amen so i hope you love them tonight and
[36:34] you love the word tonight and let's
[36:36] continue
[36:37] listen to this scripture in luke 16 2011
[36:41] this is jesus speaking again
[36:44] and
[36:45] he said these words
[36:46] he that is faithful
[36:49] luke 16 10 he that is faithful in that
[36:52] which is least
[36:54] is faithful also in much
[36:57] he that is unjust in the least
[37:00] is also unjust in the much
[37:04] so then
[37:06] little literating comes
[37:11] say it after me little thing comes
[37:15] literal things come
[37:19] and sometimes
[37:20] you hear me preach on it talk about it
[37:23] sometimes god give us an instruction to
[37:25] test our response
[37:27] if we will obey
[37:29] maybe it is too simple
[37:31] maybe
[37:32] we expect something complex just like
[37:34] the leper
[37:35] uh who was told to go and wash
[37:39] in the jordan and dip seven times and he
[37:42] was angry
[37:45] he's a leper
[37:47] he he is given a solution
[37:50] uh
[37:53] when he when he do realize he have to
[37:54] dip but
[37:55] could you send me to the beach could you
[37:57] send me to an island pool could you
[38:00] commit a blue caribbean waters
[38:02] why jordan
[38:04] what kind of what is that here
[38:07] what kind of medication it have there
[38:08] anybody know what's in that water is it
[38:10] still h2o but that gave to a plus
[38:13] the question wasn't
[38:15] the water the question was obedient
[38:19] eventually he got the result
[38:23] when he obeyed
[38:26] so
[38:27] that's what i'm saying little things are
[38:29] important
[38:30] you know when you're off target
[38:33] somebody if you're supposed to go north
[38:35] east and you find yourself some other
[38:37] way some other channel the longer you
[38:40] stay in that position is the further
[38:42] away you get from your target
[38:45] that's why the target has to be the word
[38:48] the target has to be god it has to be
[38:50] christ
[38:50] it has to be what god promised you that
[38:52] has to be the target
[38:55] and if god wants us to be productive
[38:58] as christians as fathers as mothers as
[39:01] believers
[39:02] we have to re-examine our lives and
[39:05] ourselves as to why
[39:08] is it roughness laziness tiredness
[39:10] tiredness what is it that is hindering
[39:13] us
[39:14] from becoming at our best man
[39:17] at his best paul
[39:19] expressed himself about he that striving
[39:22] for the mastery is temperate in all
[39:25] things
[39:26] and as we spoke about those virtues
[39:29] and i realized every one of them is a
[39:31] powerhouse every one of them conquering
[39:33] something every one of them overcoming
[39:34] something the impatience overcoming
[39:36] impatience temperance temperance
[39:39] overcoming penalty intemperate behavior
[39:41] and so on every one of them is a
[39:42] powerhouse that we need they need these
[39:45] things
[39:46] to stand
[39:48] to overcome
[39:49] let's continue you know i could see why
[39:51] it's
[39:52] paul very simple man don't want to let
[39:54] him eat like very christian behavior
[39:56] don't let them eat because they don't
[39:58] want to work they're lazy but they want
[40:00] food food that they're not working hard
[40:01] for for very table a lot of people you
[40:04] know they find itself in that way they
[40:06] they don't want to go there learning the
[40:08] street that kind of behavior
[40:10] all right so i want to identify what god
[40:13] is expecting of us now in the amplified
[40:17] okay
[40:18] okay right okay this here is faithful in
[40:21] that which is least
[40:22] is faithful also in march
[40:25] and he that is unjust in the least
[40:27] is unjust also in much then he continued
[40:31] if therefore
[40:33] you have not been faithful
[40:36] in the unrighteous mammal
[40:39] who
[40:40] will commit to your
[40:42] trust
[40:43] the true riches this is jesus
[40:45] now hear this in the angry side
[40:49] he who is faithful in a very little
[40:52] thing
[40:53] is faithful also in much
[40:55] he who is dishonest and unjust
[40:59] in a very little thing
[41:01] is dishonest and unjust also in much
[41:04] beautiful if
[41:07] you have not been faithful
[41:09] in the case of unrighteous mammal
[41:12] which is deceitful riches money and
[41:13] possession who will entrust you with
[41:17] true witches
[41:18] so we come back to what i recall
[41:21] a work ethic
[41:23] one attitude
[41:25] it come like if you are working for
[41:27] someone some business somewhere
[41:30] and you are half-hearted
[41:32] and you're putting in halfway supposed
[41:34] to put in on your attitude sloppy and
[41:36] lazy and whatnot
[41:38] how could you get your own business
[41:41] and be hard-working
[41:43] that's impossible
[41:45] because you see
[41:47] taught
[41:48] come words
[41:49] words become actions
[41:52] actions become habits
[41:54] habit becomes a life
[41:57] so if you are sloppy on the job
[42:00] and you continue to be sloppy
[42:02] and you can't even stand out you can't
[42:04] even be like a joseph he does so well
[42:06] you get promotion
[42:09] if you get your own you will be sloppy
[42:12] it wouldn't work for you
[42:13] because you don't have to discipline you
[42:15] don't have the muscles like you say you
[42:17] want a gym and if you lifting up weights
[42:19] that is just
[42:21] light you have no muscles to get in
[42:23] that's not how you work in the gym
[42:25] as you lift off well i'm not a gym
[42:27] person i just tell you what i know okay
[42:30] if you live up 10 pounds
[42:32] and it's training afterwards you need 11
[42:34] pounds you need 12 you need 14 you need
[42:36] 16 you need 20. and that's train and
[42:39] stretch and stream and stretch this is
[42:42] what get muscles but if you just want to
[42:46] break a sweat you could use the same
[42:48] thing same with and just you know keep
[42:49] doing like that and so on you can
[42:51] because
[42:52] if you want to get muscles you need to
[42:54] exercise
[42:55] and you need to add weight upon that and
[42:58] if you want your feet muscles to to
[43:00] build because some people just slim you
[43:02] know they have no faith muscles they
[43:04] just it's just going through but if you
[43:06] want fat muscles to bring the trials and
[43:09] intestines and the exercise of fate is
[43:11] what gives those muscles strength
[43:14] and as the winds blow you manage it
[43:17] better every time
[43:19] so afterwards it doesn't matter as
[43:21] bahram says uh you meet the devil media
[43:24] challenge anywhere anytime any place
[43:27] under any condition because that is what
[43:29] you have now feet
[43:31] muscles do you have that tonight trust
[43:33] that you do if you're not given again
[43:36] okay
[43:37] let's continue i want to read secondary
[43:39] tree but it means amplified so you have
[43:41] to find it
[43:42] i want to read it and i think it's
[43:45] almost present tense right now
[43:47] um and what is happening in the world
[43:48] today
[43:49] um we would see it
[43:52] but understand this in the last days
[43:54] will come a set in perilous times of
[43:56] great stress and trouble
[43:58] hard to deal with
[44:01] and hard to bear
[44:03] four
[44:04] people will be lovers of self and
[44:06] utterly self-centered
[44:08] lovers of money and aroused by
[44:10] inordinate greedy desire for wealth
[44:13] proud
[44:15] and arrogant
[44:16] contemptuous posters they will be
[44:19] abusive blasphemous coffin disobedient
[44:22] to parents ungrateful
[44:25] unholy and profane
[44:27] they will be without natural human
[44:29] affection callous and human relentless
[44:32] admitting of no truth or appeasement in
[44:34] other words these people don't want to
[44:35] peace at all they're like whoa they like
[44:37] they like it
[44:40] like that they will be slanderers
[44:44] false accusers
[44:46] troublemakers
[44:47] in temporary
[44:49] loose immorals and conduct
[44:52] uncontrolled and fierce haters of good
[44:55] they will be treacherous
[44:57] betrayers rash
[44:59] inflated with self-conceit they will be
[45:02] lovers of sensual pleasures and vain
[45:04] amusements
[45:05] more than
[45:06] and rather than lovers of god
[45:08] for although they hold a form of piety
[45:11] through religion and the bible in the
[45:14] kingdom say having a form of godliness
[45:16] they deny and reject
[45:19] and as strangers to the power of it
[45:22] their conduct the lies
[45:24] the genuineness of their profession
[45:26] avoid all such people turn away from
[45:29] them
[45:30] for among them are those
[45:33] who worm their way into homes
[45:36] and captivate silly and weakness and
[45:39] spiritually dwarf women
[45:41] spiritually dwarfed women
[45:44] loaded down with the burden of their
[45:45] sins
[45:46] and easily sweet
[45:48] and led away by various
[45:51] evil
[45:52] desires and seductive memphis
[45:56] these weak women
[45:58] would listen to anybody who will teach
[46:00] them
[46:01] they are forever inquiring
[46:04] and getting information
[46:07] anna but are never able to arrive at a
[46:10] recognition
[46:11] of the knowledge of the truth
[46:14] so
[46:16] the thing about the scripture here
[46:18] identifying
[46:20] not sinners outside
[46:22] this is church folks
[46:25] this is church members
[46:27] this is people who believe
[46:29] they say they believe the bible is the
[46:30] scripture
[46:32] but their belief
[46:33] and life
[46:35] not in harmony
[46:36] it's not measured
[46:38] sometimes wonder people want to be
[46:40] christians that's a beautiful song we
[46:43] sing sometime lord i want to be
[46:45] a christian in my heart
[46:47] you have to want to be a christian
[46:49] you see you are you and you know you
[46:52] you're living with you
[46:54] paul said that to me life he said uh for
[46:57] me to die is gain
[47:00] and people don't want to die
[47:02] you know and i want to say die i'm
[47:04] talking about debtor's self-doubt get to
[47:06] your own will your own desires
[47:08] why why should i just walk out for you
[47:12] the bible teach you about setbacks
[47:14] through what i said mark
[47:16] jobe is an example of having a setback
[47:19] it's not that you was a sinner in job
[47:21] was antichrist and joke misbehaving and
[47:23] do
[47:24] having adultery and fitting and smoking
[47:26] no he was he was fine
[47:28] but
[47:29] life dealt him a hand
[47:32] that set him back
[47:33] with his family
[47:35] with his health and everything else
[47:37] people could muck and laugh at him
[47:39] but at the end of it all listen god
[47:43] god glory could we give the lord a hand
[47:44] the praise
[47:45] hallelujah
[47:47] at the end of it at the end of what he
[47:49] has been through
[47:50] god glory
[47:53] now
[47:55] you know after time
[47:57] the plain fear truly is level
[47:59] um
[48:00] your ute is no longer there
[48:02] your hair is no longer black it's grain
[48:05] um face is no longer smooth it have
[48:08] wrinkles and and things on it
[48:10] and we all head in the same direction
[48:13] that's our attitude shall return
[48:16] you know just as david told solomon i go
[48:20] to the way of all flesh
[48:22] save the lord
[48:24] he exhort his son
[48:26] but david knew his time was getting near
[48:29] david was the same one that said lord
[48:31] help me to number my days to know and i
[48:34] have wisdom out of or to behave myself
[48:36] how to conduct myself
[48:38] you only have one life to live
[48:40] and you only have one time
[48:43] to be mortal
[48:44] and this is where we are
[48:46] do your best
[48:48] become the best
[48:50] this is what this is about you know
[48:52] you not staying as you
[48:54] but you becoming the best version of you
[48:57] the version that god wants of you
[49:00] gideon didn't know he was better than
[49:02] that we wanted to exhort him and say
[49:04] mighty man of honor in other words you
[49:06] and your mind battle and fight did i not
[49:08] be with you that i see
[49:10] no
[49:11] i'm seeing a leader in you
[49:13] i'm seeing you leading an army
[49:15] i'm seeing your leadership i see you
[49:17] conquering the midianites and so i see
[49:19] you doing all of that
[49:21] lord i'm the biggest i'm the least but
[49:23] yes that's how you see you i don't know
[49:26] i'm seeing you
[49:27] how do we get you to see what god sees
[49:29] are you
[49:30] because this is what the gospel is about
[49:32] this is what the revelation is all about
[49:34] i am not god i am not the holy ghost the
[49:37] holy ghost is the revealer to reveal you
[49:39] who you are
[49:41] now when you get capped listen carefully
[49:44] when you get that cut by your
[49:45] environment kept by your friends crap by
[49:47] what grandfather see and grandmother say
[49:49] and this one's here just go up to you
[49:50] and the second workout when you get kept
[49:52] by all these voices
[49:54] you
[49:55] kept your own self when you shake those
[49:59] things off
[50:00] and you come to us but wait a minute you
[50:01] mean i'm a believer right and all things
[50:04] are possible to them i believe right
[50:05] these signs are falling then i believe
[50:07] right all of a sudden you begin to uncap
[50:09] you begin to disconnect from all the
[50:11] negative and you recognize listen i
[50:14] reacted this way i was immature i
[50:16] reacted that way because i wasn't i
[50:17] didn't have the temperance i needed to
[50:19] have i was too impatient that's why i
[50:21] moved the way i did i thought i was
[50:23] going to woke up because in my
[50:25] and i went with my mind and it didn't
[50:27] work out because it was in my mind it
[50:29] wasn't the minor god did you seek the
[50:30] mind as well you did not
[50:32] you went about it your own way
[50:34] and then it unfold
[50:36] the way it unfolded you are here because
[50:39] of how your life and your choices that
[50:41] you make
[50:42] but the thing about it is the first day
[50:44] of the rest of your life is the first
[50:46] day that you can look and say you know
[50:47] wait a minute
[50:49] my whole life could turn around
[50:51] tonight the light could be my break
[50:53] tonight because as a man thinking his
[50:55] heart sounds he
[50:56] if if you know he's a biblical be
[50:59] transformed by the renewal of your mind
[51:02] could you see yourself pressing forward
[51:03] could you see yourself overcoming the
[51:05] things that keep you down could you see
[51:07] yourself raise up above where you are
[51:09] yes you can
[51:10] you have to see it
[51:12] you have to see it you must
[51:15] just refuse perilous times shall come
[51:18] stressful times are here
[51:20] what is amazing to me
[51:22] 99.9 percent of the world is under the
[51:25] same condition corona virus socialism
[51:28] the government saying this
[51:30] vaccine thing mandate no mandate people
[51:32] protesting whatever
[51:34] all of that the whole world in turmoil
[51:36] you can be like them all there
[51:38] not when god brings us here the lottery
[51:42] shall i hide from abraham what i'm about
[51:43] to do this is supposed to happen
[51:45] but we're supposed to hold steady
[51:48] we're supposed to be pressing on
[51:50] so let your light shine
[51:52] oh praise the lord
[51:54] let's continue
[51:56] now
[51:59] we read this before after a long time
[52:01] the lord of the servants commit and
[52:04] reconnect with them
[52:06] and this
[52:07] scripture here matthew 25 19
[52:10] is a scripture that gives evidence
[52:13] that we all have to account
[52:15] for the time
[52:17] i'll put this with time talent and gifts
[52:19] that god has given us
[52:21] and this time talent and gifts
[52:24] i see it as if
[52:26] we are like an investment to go on
[52:29] you you yourself you your second
[52:30] investment
[52:32] are you bearing your talent
[52:35] are you wasting your time
[52:38] are you misplacing your gifts
[52:42] is god gonna get interest from your life
[52:45] oh you're going to come to god and say
[52:47] lord
[52:48] this is what you give me i come back
[52:50] with it
[52:51] 20 years ago i discovered you and
[52:54] did you see me
[52:57] that's why peter said
[52:59] add to your feed virtue
[53:01] productivity
[53:02] don't stop there
[53:04] and divert your knowledge productivity
[53:06] don't stop me
[53:07] and the knowledge temperance and the
[53:09] temperance patience and the patience
[53:10] guardians the godliness bodily kindness
[53:13] alberta's charity
[53:14] don't ever get tired of hearing that
[53:17] because this
[53:18] is
[53:19] being
[53:21] when it's completed is the sermon of god
[53:23] issues of god going to rapture this is
[53:24] raptor material
[53:26] this is what the big magnet coming to
[53:28] magnetize not so much
[53:30] not who is the pastor
[53:32] what church you go to
[53:34] it's what's inside of you
[53:37] you hear me say the rapture is inside
[53:38] out not outside him
[53:40] the change of the body is only because
[53:42] there's a power on the inside
[53:44] the power the inside will affect what on
[53:46] the outside
[53:47] this is what this rapture is all about
[53:49] the big magnet of the holy watch which
[53:51] is the capsule
[53:52] coming to connect with the power that's
[53:54] already inside it
[53:55] the reason jesus could say destroy this
[53:58] body in two days i'll raise it up is
[53:59] because there was something resident in
[54:02] him with a time on it
[54:04] that that sets off an alarm
[54:06] before three days
[54:08] so jesus knew according to the
[54:09] scriptures he have the right it have no
[54:11] ifs it has no buts so he could declare
[54:14] destroyed his body into his eye myself
[54:16] would raise it up again and he did
[54:19] prove it he was not only mechanics word
[54:21] flesh but he was also a dynamic spirit
[54:23] car
[54:24] was resident in him
[54:26] so when time came
[54:28] his body was quickened and he rose from
[54:31] the dead
[54:33] so there was
[54:34] prophecies of our lives
[54:36] and we have to connect with those
[54:37] prophecies
[54:39] that we could see this day this
[54:41] scripture is fulfilled
[54:44] in my life
[54:45] for my house
[54:47] for my home
[54:48] for my family
[54:49] let's see if we could
[54:51] get that stretch you know
[54:54] now this scripture here i am
[54:57] i just fell in love with it
[54:59] it's from titus chapter 3 14.
[55:02] and
[55:03] i
[55:05] it's a powerful scripture i don't think
[55:07] we ever use that scripture before but i
[55:08] feel in the context of what we're doing
[55:10] tonight it's a key scripture titus 3 14
[55:13] says and let
[55:14] always
[55:15] also learn
[55:17] to maintain good works
[55:19] for necessary uses
[55:21] that they be not unfruitful oh it sounds
[55:24] kind of strange but let's read the
[55:25] amplifier of that
[55:27] and let our own people
[55:30] really learn
[55:31] to apply themselves to good deeds
[55:35] to honest labor
[55:37] and honorable employment
[55:40] so that they
[55:41] may be able to meet
[55:43] necessary demands
[55:46] whenever the occasion may require
[55:49] and not be living idle
[55:52] and uncultivated
[55:54] and unfruitful lives oh that's a beauty
[55:57] i think i want to read it again me and
[55:59] perfect
[56:00] titus 3 14. something to meditate on
[56:04] let our own people
[56:06] really learn
[56:08] to apply
[56:10] themselves
[56:11] to good deeds
[56:13] now
[56:15] doing good deeds is not automatic
[56:17] thinking
[56:18] people
[56:19] is not born with a gift of doing good dj
[56:22] people do good deeds to themselves
[56:25] on a selfish level they're doing for
[56:27] them they're doing their family they're
[56:29] doing it for their loved ones
[56:30] but doing good deeds to others
[56:33] you have to apply yourself to that
[56:36] you have to want to do that
[56:39] you have to choose to do that
[56:41] some people do good deeds to get back
[56:43] goods
[56:44] guys business that is trading that is a
[56:46] different kind of good deeds thing
[56:48] i am talking about good deeds and you
[56:50] expect nothing in return
[56:53] it's a choice of your action
[56:55] it's a choice of your decision that you
[56:58] do that
[56:59] and when you do that
[57:01] you reap the benefit of that
[57:04] so let me read it again and let our own
[57:06] people really learn to apply themselves
[57:07] to good deeds
[57:09] and listen to honest labor and honorable
[57:11] employment
[57:12] so that they may be able to meet
[57:15] necessary demands
[57:18] whenever the occasion may require
[57:21] and not be living idle
[57:23] and uncultivated
[57:25] unfruitful lives
[57:28] praise god
[57:30] and you know the bible talk about stop
[57:32] fullness and we spoke about
[57:34] peter says given all diligence
[57:36] and that diligence is thoroughness
[57:39] persistence
[57:41] attentiveness
[57:43] you know there are some people overlook
[57:44] so many different things they just take
[57:46] general
[57:47] but giving out diligence means you are
[57:49] focused now
[57:50] you know what i want to pay attention to
[57:52] this i think this is very important i
[57:55] can't afford to miss it
[57:57] proverbs 6 6 says go to the adult
[57:59] slugger consider ways
[58:00] and be wise
[58:03] and the prophet and the bible the second
[58:05] corinthians 9 6 says but this i say he
[58:07] that sweats sparingly shall also be
[58:09] sparingly without sweat bountifully
[58:13] shall reap also bountifully
[58:16] the amplified of that says remember he
[58:18] who sows tyranny and grudgingly and also
[58:21] leaves tyranny and grudgingly
[58:23] he will sues generously that blessing
[58:26] may come to someone will also reap
[58:28] generously the blessing
[58:30] do you ever
[58:32] help someone and realize it happened
[58:33] yourself
[58:34] remember years ago
[58:36] early christian experience
[58:38] i was under some real pressure and i was
[58:40] thinking about backsliding
[58:42] and i met a brother who was senior to me
[58:44] and he was standing with the lord and he
[58:46] telling me
[58:46] he going on backslide i said what so go
[58:49] on but
[58:49] i said i testified to him and talked to
[58:51] me would when i finished with him i was
[58:54] so charged he taught her backside in the
[58:56] left
[58:58] and i learned something from that
[59:00] when you give
[59:01] truly you get
[59:03] i was seeing how could you even think
[59:06] about backsiding brother
[59:07] and he was an older brother loneliness
[59:09] long sleeving alone and whatnot and it
[59:11] was something else to me that still be
[59:13] up so much but i he told the backside
[59:17] so friends
[59:18] begin to testify
[59:20] begin to give your testimony
[59:22] begin to share
[59:24] about what god has done for you
[59:26] how god spoke to your life how god came
[59:28] into your life begin to share it with
[59:29] somebody
[59:30] somebody need to hear and be encouraged
[59:33] with your own testimony
[59:35] okay praise the lord
[59:39] eclair says 11 6
[59:43] in the morning should i seed
[59:46] and in the evening with whole nothing
[59:48] hand
[59:50] for thou know is not where they shall
[59:52] prosper either this
[59:54] or that or whether they vote shall i
[59:57] like be good
[59:58] what does that teach us
[1:00:01] don't hold back
[1:00:03] you put all that you're supposed to do
[1:00:05] you're so old some people sow two
[1:00:07] seasons
[1:00:08] and
[1:00:09] and two might be bad seeds
[1:00:11] when you saw a hundred seeds if they
[1:00:14] have 50 or very bad they are 50 coming
[1:00:16] good
[1:00:17] because you put the labor
[1:00:19] your soul sparingly you reap spiritually
[1:00:21] you're so bountiful you read bountifully
[1:00:24] put your hands in the dirt
[1:00:27] put your hands to libra
[1:00:29] labor in prayer labor in faith labor and
[1:00:33] study
[1:00:34] put your hands to it
[1:00:37] and then and only but there is reward
[1:00:40] ephesians 5 the scripture we read
[1:00:43] verse 15 see then that you walk
[1:00:45] circumspectly not as fools
[1:00:47] but as wise
[1:00:49] redeeming the time
[1:00:51] because the days are evil
[1:00:53] wherefore be not unwise but
[1:00:56] understanding
[1:00:58] what the will of the lord is
[1:01:00] but i never read it in the amplified
[1:01:02] which i'll read now
[1:01:03] look carefully then how you walk
[1:01:06] live purposefully
[1:01:08] and worthily
[1:01:09] and accurately not as unwise and witness
[1:01:13] but as wise sensible intelligent people
[1:01:17] making the very most of the time
[1:01:20] buying up each opportunity because the
[1:01:22] days are evil therefore do not be vague
[1:01:24] and thoughtless and foolish but
[1:01:27] understanding and firmly grasping
[1:01:30] what the will of the lord is
[1:01:33] hallelujah
[1:01:35] thank you lord give the lord some praise
[1:01:38] and here
[1:01:39] we go now the only way we stretch here
[1:01:42] to the backbone of
[1:01:45] what we are sharing tonight
[1:01:47] which is from colossians
[1:01:50] chapter 3 verse 23-24
[1:01:54] and whatsoever you do
[1:01:58] do it heartily
[1:02:00] as
[1:02:01] to the lord
[1:02:02] but not unto men now this is a little
[1:02:06] different
[1:02:07] from what
[1:02:08] you may get in productivity books
[1:02:11] or people talk about productivity nobody
[1:02:13] will ever talk that only the scripture
[1:02:16] could
[1:02:16] define it that way
[1:02:19] that what we do
[1:02:20] we do it as unto the lord not as under
[1:02:22] man
[1:02:24] and to me
[1:02:25] what that bring is a consciousness
[1:02:28] that the eyes of god is on you
[1:02:31] not so much money
[1:02:33] the boss may not see you rationally work
[1:02:35] the boss may not see you on the cotton
[1:02:37] or whatever it is but god sees
[1:02:40] so when you have a consciousness
[1:02:43] that the eyes of god is upon you not
[1:02:45] just job-wise
[1:02:47] but life-wise
[1:02:48] be wise it changes the picture of how
[1:02:52] you walk how you talk who you live how
[1:02:54] you behave yourself
[1:02:56] so this is a powerful scripture are we
[1:02:58] going to get it to the amplified will
[1:02:59] shine more light in it he said whatever
[1:03:01] you do
[1:03:03] how to do it
[1:03:04] you're doing
[1:03:05] you could do it grudgingly you could do
[1:03:07] it unwillingly you can do it and your
[1:03:10] next action to do it
[1:03:11] or you could do it heartily ask to the
[1:03:14] lord
[1:03:15] not unto men
[1:03:16] verse 24 knowing
[1:03:18] that of the lord
[1:03:20] you shall receive the reward of
[1:03:22] inheritance
[1:03:24] for you serve the lord jesus christ
[1:03:26] and the amplified states here now
[1:03:28] whatever may be your task
[1:03:30] look at it heartily from the soul
[1:03:34] as something done for the lord and not
[1:03:36] from men
[1:03:38] knowing with all certainty
[1:03:40] that is from the lord and not from men
[1:03:42] that you will receive inheritance
[1:03:44] which is your real reward
[1:03:47] the one whom you are actually serving is
[1:03:51] the lord christ
[1:03:53] the messiah
[1:03:55] and i found this beautiful psalm psalms
[1:03:58] 101
[1:03:59] and that psalm should be our testimony
[1:04:03] our
[1:04:04] our witness
[1:04:06] this should be our psalm
[1:04:08] psalms 101 and you can find it
[1:04:10] and maybe if you find it we could read
[1:04:13] it together
[1:04:15] psalms 101
[1:04:17] and it just ate verses
[1:04:22] i will sing of mercy and judgment unto
[1:04:24] thee o lord will i sing
[1:04:27] i will behave myself wisely in a perfect
[1:04:30] way
[1:04:31] oh when will dog come unto me
[1:04:34] i will walk within my house with a
[1:04:36] perfect heart
[1:04:38] i will set no wicked thing before my
[1:04:41] eyes
[1:04:42] i hate the work of them that turn aside
[1:04:46] it shall not cling to me
[1:04:48] a froward heart shall depart from me
[1:04:51] i will not know a wicked person
[1:04:55] who so privily slandered his neighbor
[1:04:58] him will i cut off
[1:05:00] that hat and hi look
[1:05:02] and a proud heart will i
[1:05:04] will not i suffer
[1:05:06] mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of
[1:05:09] the land
[1:05:10] that they may dwell with me
[1:05:13] he that walketh in a perfect way
[1:05:15] he shall save me
[1:05:17] he that worketh deceit shall not dwell
[1:05:19] within my house
[1:05:21] he that tell it lies shall not tarry in
[1:05:23] my sight
[1:05:25] i will only destroy the wicked of the
[1:05:26] land
[1:05:27] that i may cut off all the wicked doors
[1:05:29] from the city of the road
[1:05:31] may god bless
[1:05:33] this world
[1:05:34] and this is brother branham

[1:07:01] how to be
[1:07:02] god will bless it
[1:07:04] if he takes a notion for something else
[1:07:06] he replaces you where he needs
[1:07:08] you just be what you are
[1:07:11] god wants you the way he made you
[1:07:14] and just keep that in mind if it's a
[1:07:17] doormat
[1:07:18] i want to be the best doormat he ever
[1:07:20] had
[1:07:21] if i have to be a doormat whatever it is

[1:07:27] that i can for him
[1:07:30] now
[1:07:32] jesus said
[1:07:33] they'll come to pass they will kill you
[1:07:34] thinking they're doing god's service you
[1:07:36] remember
[1:07:37] that jesus said that
[1:07:38] through the same spirit predicted it
[1:07:40] against in the end time it's got to come
[1:07:43] if these others hit perfectly with the
[1:07:45] scripture watch and see if it doesn't
[1:07:47] coincide exactly with the scripture
[1:07:49] god said it would happen here and it did
[1:07:52] happen then we are going to do
[1:07:55] then what we are going to do let me get
[1:07:56] down to laodicea again
[1:07:58] oh praise god i'm going to close
[1:08:00] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:08:03] but i am speaking about saint martin
[1:08:04] here
[1:08:06] you say one of his first miracles he was
[1:08:07] a soldier to begin with i believe
[1:08:10] then one day he was coming by a man
[1:08:13] lying cold and shivering
[1:08:14] all the people not willing was not able
[1:08:16] to help the man
[1:08:18] just pass him by the priests the levites
[1:08:20] did in the good samaritan
[1:08:22] when said martin came by realizing his
[1:08:24] duty
[1:08:25] as a christian believer
[1:08:28] he had one coat
[1:08:30] cloak over his shoulders
[1:08:32] he cut it and told his sword and gave
[1:08:34] half of it to the beggar
[1:08:36] he took the other half
[1:08:38] and and that night
[1:08:41] began his career
[1:08:46] for jesus christ appeared him in a
[1:08:48] vision
[1:08:50] wrapped in the same robe
[1:08:53] that he cut half into
[1:08:56] which fulfilled the scripture in so much
[1:08:59] as you have done these
[1:09:01] you have done it unto me
[1:09:03] i wonder if god take that scripture
[1:09:07] and bring it to us how we how will we
[1:09:10] feel
[1:09:11] how would he examine us based upon how
[1:09:14] we treat each other how we treat one
[1:09:17] another how we treat the church members
[1:09:19] how we church church people
[1:09:21] how we handle other ministers or the
[1:09:23] believers other churches hope
[1:09:25] as you have done it into the release of
[1:09:27] this one
[1:09:28] you have done under me in other words
[1:09:30] you treat somebody evil you treat
[1:09:32] christ's ego you treat somebody bad
[1:09:34] you are actively treated in christ bad
[1:09:37] as you have done unto the release of
[1:09:39] this little one
[1:09:40] you've done it on me but we have to come
[1:09:42] back to this now
[1:09:44] this is the bible
[1:09:46] we are reading the bible this is what
[1:09:48] the prophet was saying to open up this
[1:09:51] very scripture
[1:09:52] this is the absolute this is the word of
[1:09:54] god
[1:09:55] let's continue
[1:09:57] so
[1:09:58] so
[1:09:59] now he
[1:10:00] said so let's take that for a lesson
[1:10:04] whatever you do to somebody
[1:10:06] you're doing it to christ
[1:10:08] nobody said let's say that together
[1:10:11] and brother branham and the congregation
[1:10:13] speak a new nation and he make them say
[1:10:15] this and you could sit with me
[1:10:17] what or you see after me what you do to
[1:10:20] others
[1:10:21] you say what you do to others
[1:10:24] you have done to christ
[1:10:25] you have done to christ so no matter
[1:10:27] what he thinks about you listen it is
[1:10:30] what you think about him see
[1:10:33] that
[1:10:34] brings the blessing
[1:10:36] that was his first miracle
[1:10:38] and the beginning of his ministry
[1:10:42] and there's another one
[1:10:43] and he was praying and why is congress
[1:10:46] was waiting for what's important
[1:10:48] and there was a beggar come to the door
[1:10:49] knock at the door
[1:10:51] and he opened the door and he was busy
[1:10:53] and he told him he wanted a garment he
[1:10:56] was naked had nothing he was cold he
[1:10:58] sent him to see the chief deacon and the
[1:10:59] chief deacon was irritable with him and
[1:11:01] ran him out
[1:11:03] and when he did
[1:11:04] he run around he come back again
[1:11:07] and told saint martin that the deaton
[1:11:10] had run him out as i run out
[1:11:14] and so then after that time the chief
[1:11:16] didn't come back in and told him
[1:11:18] kind of sharply your congregation is
[1:11:20] waiting on you
[1:11:22] you keep them waiting
[1:11:24] but he was in prayer
[1:11:27] it is better that he stayed in prayer
[1:11:29] till he feels like of god to go up
[1:11:32] and this beggar
[1:11:34] came back to the door
[1:11:36] and said martin took of his own garment
[1:11:38] good garment and give it to the beggar
[1:11:41] and the chief deacon to go and get
[1:11:43] another one and bring it to him
[1:11:45] so he had to get a garment any of putin
[1:11:47] on saint martin and he wore the lesser
[1:11:49] garment out before the people instead of
[1:11:51] the good girl
[1:11:53] you see
[1:11:54] it goes to show
[1:11:57] give the best
[1:11:58] what you have
[1:12:00] give your life
[1:12:02] give your time
[1:12:04] give everything to christ
[1:12:06] and that same spirit
[1:12:08] that lived in christ lives in you
[1:12:11] and your influence in your neighborhood
[1:12:13] and upon the people that you deal with
[1:12:15] will be so much like christ
[1:12:17] children work the same thing christ did
[1:12:20] so finally it come to pass that the
[1:12:22] people lived in the shadows and was
[1:12:24] healed that's right there's so much
[1:12:26] power of love around them
[1:12:28] and they said when sin martin was
[1:12:29] preaching after he come out with the
[1:12:31] lesser road
[1:12:32] on the entire corrugation notice a glow
[1:12:35] of light all around him see
[1:12:38] because
[1:12:39] he's done the right thing
[1:12:42] always do right
[1:12:44] that's your duty to god
[1:12:46] think right
[1:12:48] that's your duty to yourself
[1:12:50] and you've got to come out right
[1:12:52] that's right you have to
[1:12:54] and the final scripture tonight
[1:12:57] are we going to close
[1:12:59] and this scripture i believe caps it off
[1:13:02] in truth of what god sees as
[1:13:06] productivity
[1:13:08] and this scripture is a familiar
[1:13:10] scripture
[1:13:11] it's in john 15 1-8
[1:13:14] i am the true mind
[1:13:16] my father is a husker
[1:13:18] every branch in me the beard not fruity
[1:13:21] take it away
[1:13:24] that is plain
[1:13:27] that is the knife
[1:13:29] that is no if and bought and maybe every
[1:13:32] branch in me
[1:13:34] that bear it not fruit
[1:13:36] he take it away
[1:13:38] and every branch that beared fruit
[1:13:40] he purges it
[1:13:42] that it may bring
[1:13:44] forth more fruit so now
[1:13:47] just by verse 2 you recognize god
[1:13:51] is interested
[1:13:52] in foodbearing
[1:13:54] he is not interested in no fruit
[1:13:57] he want fruit
[1:13:59] and if he sees fruit you're going to
[1:14:01] purge it to get more fruit now this tree
[1:14:05] now you are clean to the word
[1:14:07] which i have spoken unto you
[1:14:10] abide in me
[1:14:11] and i in you
[1:14:12] as the branch cannot be a fruit of
[1:14:14] itself except it's abide in the vine no
[1:14:16] more can he
[1:14:18] except you abide in me
[1:14:19] i am divine
[1:14:21] you are the branches
[1:14:23] either abide in me and i and him the
[1:14:25] same bring it fought much fruit
[1:14:27] for without me you can do nothing
[1:14:30] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[1:14:32] forth as a branch and is withered and
[1:14:35] men gather them and cast them into the
[1:14:36] fire
[1:14:38] and they are burned
[1:14:40] if ye abide in me
[1:14:42] and my words abide in you
[1:14:45] ye shall ask what you will
[1:14:47] and it shall be done unto you
[1:14:50] hearing is my father glorified
[1:14:52] that you bear much fruit
[1:14:55] socially by disciples
[1:14:57] so we went from fruit
[1:15:00] more fruit
[1:15:02] much fruit
[1:15:03] god
[1:15:04] is interested
[1:15:06] in food bearing
[1:15:09] not so much the talk
[1:15:12] but bearing fruit
[1:15:14] ask god
[1:15:16] that you'll be
[1:15:18] a fruit bear bearing fruit
[1:15:21] and that takes us
[1:15:22] to psalms 1. i've been thinking about
[1:15:24] that hope sometime i'll preach
[1:15:26] about samsung blessed is the man who
[1:15:28] will walk not in the counsel of him
[1:15:29] godly
[1:15:31] walking away of sinners who sit in the
[1:15:32] seat of his cornfield but as a light is
[1:15:34] in the law of the lord and in that lord
[1:15:36] that he meditated day and night he shall
[1:15:38] be like a tree planted by rivers of what
[1:15:43] oh my whatever you shall trust
[1:15:45] hallelujah praise god it's not just the
[1:15:48] trees where he's planted
[1:15:50] may the lord bless you i trust tonight
[1:15:53] that
[1:15:54] this
[1:15:55] taught you in a special way in a special
[1:15:58] way
[1:15:59] that when abraham offered isaac and the
[1:16:02] altar and god said hold your hand stay
[1:16:05] your hand i know you fear me and
[1:16:06] blessing and complicity and multiplying
[1:16:09] and multiply d and thai seizure you
[1:16:12] never yet go talk about subtraction and
[1:16:14] division and so on always addition
[1:16:16] multiplication
[1:16:18] this is the god reserve
[1:16:20] he put a seed
[1:16:21] and that seed would bring forth after
[1:16:23] its kind in in multiply form
[1:16:26] he put you on the earth as an investment
[1:16:29] what will be his returns let us bow our
[1:16:31] heads
[1:16:33] almighty god there are so much aspects
[1:16:36] of this term productivity
[1:16:38] there are so much aspects of faithful
[1:16:41] and literal faithful and much lord are
[1:16:43] you know i just crashed the surface of
[1:16:45] it tonight
[1:16:46] i know that others may do much better in
[1:16:48] presenting this topic and presenting
[1:16:51] this bible study and have this bible
[1:16:52] class
[1:16:53] but i pray god that it will be enough
[1:16:55] for these people guided here and those
[1:16:58] who would listen to be stood in spirit
[1:17:00] and ask themselves in introspection
[1:17:03] what am i doing how am i doing it how am
[1:17:05] i
[1:17:06] i like talling up to this thing we don't
[1:17:08] want to be found on that scale
[1:17:10] when the pronouncement comes
[1:17:12] we hear you're found in a balance
[1:17:15] raising the balance and from wanting god
[1:17:17] we want that skill to truly balance
[1:17:19] balance with the word and spirit balance
[1:17:21] with what you require of us and lord you
[1:17:24] will never lose your slutful the bible
