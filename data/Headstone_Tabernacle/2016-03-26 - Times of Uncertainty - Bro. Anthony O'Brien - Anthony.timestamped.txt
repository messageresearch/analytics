[1:12:27] uncertainty amen and amen do you love
[1:12:30] him this
[1:12:31] morning
[1:12:33] uncertainty and you know that
[1:12:35] word really means that you're not
[1:12:39] sure what's going to
[1:12:41] happen and you're not sure about your
[1:12:44] future or what anything holds for you
[1:12:48] and sometimes life is like that the
[1:12:51] prophet talked sometimes he said
[1:12:52] sometime you're going through a night
[1:12:54] time he called it and there seemed to be
[1:12:58] no no sunlight and there seemed to be no
[1:13:02] no way of
[1:13:03] Hope and there seemed to be as it was
[1:13:06] almost gross
[1:13:07] darkness in the
[1:13:09] situation it seemed to be like there's
[1:13:11] no
[1:13:12] answer sometimes you pray and you feel
[1:13:15] like your prayer hit on a wall
[1:13:18] somewhere sometimes you feel like God is
[1:13:21] silent God is not hearing
[1:13:23] you and it is in those times that the
[1:13:26] devil has a
[1:13:29] Revival because God has seemingly closed
[1:13:32] the door and you can't hear anything and
[1:13:36] you don't feel the spirit like you used
[1:13:38] to sometimes you don't feel like singing
[1:13:42] sometimes you're trying to find strength
[1:13:44] to pray sometimes you're trying to find
[1:13:47] something that could give you a promise
[1:13:49] for tomorrow I got news for you this
[1:13:52] morning the world is UNC
[1:13:55] the atmosphere is uncertain what you see
[1:13:58] around you may be uncertain but the only
[1:14:01] thing that is certain this morning is
[1:14:04] Jesus Christ the same yesterday the same
[1:14:08] today and the same
[1:14:10] forever oh somebody praise him this
[1:14:14] morning
[1:14:15] hallelujah hallelujah so this message
[1:14:18] this morning it's not to make you
[1:14:21] depressed but this is a message of hope
[1:14:24] I hope Beyond all hopes a hope that the
[1:14:27] world cannot see Jesus said a little
[1:14:31] while and the world will see me no more
[1:14:34] but he said you are going to see me you
[1:14:37] the individual you the believer you the
[1:14:41] one who stayed you the one who prayed
[1:14:45] you the one who fasted you the one who
[1:14:47] held on with all of your might don't you
[1:14:51] worry little sister there is a man this
[1:14:55] morning who could turn on the light that
[1:14:58] man is here this
[1:15:00] morning
[1:15:02] oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:15:07] Hallelujah Hallelujah so the doctors may
[1:15:10] tell you that there's no hope they'll
[1:15:13] say there's no healing they'll say
[1:15:15] there's nothing that we can do for you
[1:15:17] no more the doctors might give up on you
[1:15:20] but God doesn't give up on his Blood
[1:15:24] Washed sons and daughters
[1:15:25] there's a promise this morning for
[1:15:28] healing oh if you can forget about the
[1:15:30] dark clouds and just reach up and keep
[1:15:33] on pressing Beyond those dark clouds
[1:15:37] there is a sun out there that is always
[1:15:40] shining doesn't matter what depression
[1:15:43] what frustration what is in your way
[1:15:47] David said to a thand follow my right
[1:15:49] side don't 10,000 follow my left he said
[1:15:53] I shall not be moved oh hallelujah
[1:15:57] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:16:01] hallelujah amen
[1:16:04] amen times of
[1:16:08] uncertainty speaks about life the part I
[1:16:11] love about that title is the first word
[1:16:16] says
[1:16:17] times for everything there's a time and
[1:16:19] a season but Isaac brought it out so
[1:16:21] massively last week speing on the
[1:16:24] scripture Ecclesiastes 3 isn't that
[1:16:26] right amen Time season for
[1:16:29] everything time to be born a time to die
[1:16:31] time for this time for that isn't that
[1:16:34] right and it's an encouragement to me
[1:16:37] because even though it's times of
[1:16:39] uncertainty that uncertainty is only for
[1:16:43] a time only for a time even though it's
[1:16:46] a time of of of of of mourning as it was
[1:16:51] or maybe a time of of of Sorrow as it

[1:17:29] ending and your trial might have a
[1:17:31] beginning this morning but it will have
[1:17:34] an end your situation might have had a
[1:17:36] beginning but it will have an end this
[1:17:38] morning the devil had a beginning and he
[1:17:41] will have an end but you come from
[1:17:44] eternity and you go back to Eternity who

[1:20:07] it unfold and he let people laugh at it
[1:20:10] he let people mock it he let people say
[1:20:13] what they want to say but in the end God
[1:20:16] always has the final say and when that
[1:20:19] seed go to taking on life who could
[1:20:22] laugh now who could get on now
[1:20:25] say what you want to say can't say
[1:20:27] nothing God is manifesting something in

[1:20:39] been with Jesus Paul I know Peter I know
[1:20:43] and you I know also you got an
[1:20:46] experience I can't use you to hate

[1:21:35] without form and void the Bible says
[1:21:38] Darkness was upon the Deep Darkness over
[1:21:41] the waters you couldn't see anything God
[1:21:45] couldn't even make a start until he had
[1:21:47] uttered his first word which was let
[1:21:49] there be light Hallelujah and when he
[1:21:53] spoke that word
[1:21:55] the prophet said it didn't matter how
[1:21:56] long it took for that light to come that
[1:22:00] light had to come because God had
[1:22:03] already spoken it Hal he couldn't take
[1:22:05] it back Hallelujah it was already gone
[1:22:08] forth and what word God has spoken over
[1:22:11] your life this morning he cannot take it
[1:22:14] back oh he's done already spoken it he's
[1:22:18] done already made up his mind God don't
[1:22:21] change his mind about his decisions and
[1:22:25] when God elected you when God
[1:22:28] predestinated you when God chose you to
[1:22:31] be here in this day and in this season
[1:22:34] God didn't change his mind God said I
[1:22:37] love my choice I'm staying with my
[1:22:40] choice oh Hallelujah and I'll show the
[1:22:43] world who they are oh somebody praise
[1:22:47] them this morning God's going to
[1:22:49] identify himself with a bride on the
[1:22:52] earth oh Hallelujah
[1:22:57] [Applause]
[1:23:00] Hallelujah was a time of
[1:23:02] uncertainty the world was out form and
[1:23:05] void but when God began to Bro over it
[1:23:08] it became become more beautiful and more
[1:23:11] beautiful and More Beautiful until that
[1:23:14] war until that void chaotic world begin
[1:23:17] to take on the thing that was booing
[1:23:20] over it it begin to become beautified it
[1:23:22] began to see greens and and trees and
[1:23:25] plants and flowers and birds and bees it
[1:23:28] begin to take on life and I don't care
[1:23:30] how chaotic your life might seem it
[1:23:33] might be without form it might be
[1:23:35] without forid but if you let yourself go
[1:23:38] in The Potter's hands this morning it'll
[1:23:41] begin to take on another form God is in
[1:23:43] the transforming business he's not going
[1:23:46] to throw you away oh no that's what the
[1:23:48] devil would do but God has the ability
[1:23:52] to take something that might be use less
[1:23:55] and turn it into something beautiful
[1:23:57] that's what God can do and God could do
[1:24:00] that for you this morning you might seem
[1:24:02] looses you might seem frustrated you
[1:24:05] might seem broken but that's the kind of
[1:24:08] vessel that God is looking for this
[1:24:10] morning he's going to take you and
[1:24:12] reshape you mold you and break you
[1:24:15] praise God oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:24:21] hallelujah amen hallelujah
[1:24:24] amen
[1:24:26] amen praise God great inspiration has
[1:24:28] come forth last few days there come down
[1:24:31] to The Potter's House hallelujah amen
[1:24:33] it's still going
[1:24:35] on amen amen and having been in art
[1:24:38] myself I had a privilege of actually
[1:24:41] using clay and um one of the things I
[1:24:45] noticed with with with Clay work is that
[1:24:48] if you doing it you can't do it from
[1:24:50] afar like you know you might be able to
[1:24:53] take a brush and paint it from afar you
[1:24:56] know trying not to get your hands dirty
[1:24:57] or something but if you're doing clay
[1:24:59] work you have to be in it
[1:25:02] yeah two hands you can't do clay one
[1:25:04] hand and be talking on your cell phone
[1:25:06] no you have to be completely without
[1:25:09] distractions and you have to be
[1:25:10] committed to this piece that you're
[1:25:13] working on can't have anybody talking
[1:25:15] around you just kind of quiet an noise
[1:25:18] focusing on what's going on inside of
[1:25:20] you sometimes it gets messy the forming
[1:25:24] and the shaping gets messy sometimes a
[1:25:26] Potter is up to his elbows and Clay but
[1:25:29] it's for a purpose because he wants to
[1:25:32] see this thing come to life he's looking
[1:25:35] to see this thing take on shape take on
[1:25:38] form take on Hallelujah take on a
[1:25:41] certain kind of thing so that could be
[1:25:43] used for the purpose that it was meant
[1:25:45] to be used for isn't that right isn't
[1:25:48] that right hallelujah hallelujah amen so
[1:25:52] it's quite an experience we with clay
[1:25:54] and so on amen amen and I could only
[1:25:57] imagine that you can't uh change your
[1:25:59] vision you can't change what it is that
[1:26:03] uh you're trying to achieve once you've
[1:26:05] started it you have to follow through
[1:26:08] you can't change your mind in the middle
[1:26:11] amen isn't that right and change your
[1:26:12] desire or change your focus as it was
[1:26:15] but you have to stay on track with the
[1:26:17] target with what it is you're trying to
[1:26:20] achieve and that's what I love about God
[1:26:23] God don't get a Vikes or get some
[1:26:26] haphazard way and and he don't just get
[1:26:28] a vaps as it was and just decide to
[1:26:30] change his strategy or change this and
[1:26:33] oh Hal no no no no he's going to take
[1:26:34] that same old clay oh Hallelujah and
[1:26:37] mold it into something beautiful oh
[1:26:40] hallelujah
[1:26:43] hallelujah and you know the most amazing
[1:26:45] thing about clay it's a very um almost
[1:26:49] useless kind of soil yeah you know you
[1:26:53] can take top soil and maybe use that to
[1:26:55] grow some plants or get some vegetation
[1:26:57] or something in the backyard but you
[1:26:59] can't use clay for that matter of fact
[1:27:02] you'd have to dig out all the clay might
[1:27:04] replace it with some good soil or
[1:27:06] something cuz that can't grow plants
[1:27:08] it's almost a useless soil so there the
[1:27:11] clay sits doing nothing being useless to
[1:27:14] nobody and no one until all of a sudden
[1:27:17] a skillful Potter comes Alone says I
[1:27:20] could use this to do something and maybe
[1:27:22] the World cast you out
[1:27:24] maybe the world threw you out and maybe
[1:27:26] they said you was a nobody maybe they
[1:27:29] said you was an odd ball but God could
[1:27:31] use OD ball sometimes God could use clay
[1:27:35] sometimes God could use his people to do
[1:27:38] what he wants to do to do something in
[1:27:41] you that he cannot do with anyone else
[1:27:44] you are unique this morning you are
[1:27:47] special to God this morning you were
[1:27:50] created for his glory you were created
[1:27:54] for the glory and the honor of God don't
[1:27:57] you ever let the devil lie to you and
[1:27:59] tell you that you are useless that you
[1:28:01] are nothing when God take useless and
[1:28:05] put it in his hands it becomes something
[1:28:09] to the world then he says here is my
[1:28:11] beloved Son and Daughter in whom I am
[1:28:14] well pleased he ye him oh
[1:28:22] hallelujah amen amen

[1:28:34] things that give

[1:34:06] absolutely sure to every person in here
[1:34:09] I want to leave that thought to you to
[1:34:11] begin with he said it's uncertain
[1:34:14] whether you're going to live to get out
[1:34:17] of this church or not he says it's
[1:34:20] uncertain whether you'll ever be back
[1:34:22] again or not
[1:34:24] it's uncertain whether you'll see
[1:34:26] another years of life he said but
[1:34:28] there's one thing certainly is sure he
[1:34:32] said that's death and the Judgment
[1:34:34] afterwards he said and you're just as
[1:34:36] sure to meet God uh to meet that God is
[1:34:39] in he uh you are just sure to meet that
[1:34:42] God as God is in heaven isn't that right
[1:34:46] he said you may make an appointment with
[1:34:48] your wife and say honey honey I might I
[1:34:51] will take you to a certain place or
[1:34:53] something something may arise and you
[1:34:54] can't do that you might not be able to
[1:34:57] keep that appointment you might tell
[1:34:59] your best friend brother I'm going to

[1:35:03] I'll let you have money or I'll let you
[1:35:05] have my car or whatever all kinds of
[1:35:07] uncertainty against that isn't that
[1:35:09] right he says so you're making your
[1:35:11] plans but God laughs at our plans
[1:35:13] because it's uncertain oh how we hope
[1:35:16] someday we hope that we can do this we
[1:35:19] hope that we can do that but if it's not
[1:35:21] the will of God then it's not the will
[1:35:23] of God because it is UNC what will
[1:35:26] happen tomorrow but we know who holds
[1:35:29] tomorrow and it is in his hands We Trust
[1:35:33] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:35:37] Hallelujah but that's the spirit of man
[1:35:40] we get all caught up in ourselves in our
[1:35:44] abilities and our power to do it and we
[1:35:47] make promises that sometimes we don't
[1:35:50] even know if we could
[1:35:51] keep we make plans
[1:35:54] that we are not even sure half the time
[1:35:57] if we can fulfill but the one thing
[1:35:59] about God is that God keeps all of his
[1:36:03] promises the one thing about God is that
[1:36:06] he fulfills all of his word and he keeps
[1:36:10] all of his appointments oh H and you
[1:36:13] have an appointment this morning with
[1:36:16] the Supernatural and the Unseen and I

[1:36:58] is see that you're going to die and

[1:37:02] bear that in mind he said while now
[1:37:04] we're talking on in

[1:37:35] bad news to report that's why I love

[1:37:40] because I can hear the gospel and the
[1:37:44] gospel is the good news about how God is

[1:37:52] how God is still able
[1:37:54] to do something even now oh Hallelujah
[1:37:59] God could make a way where there seem to
[1:38:01] be no way you might have a situation
[1:38:04] home but if you stay in the right

[1:38:17] work it out right
[1:38:20] hallelujah hallelujah

[1:38:34] had his mistakes they went with higga
[1:38:37] and different things and different
[1:38:38] things happened that was not expected
[1:38:42] Hallelujah but God was in the midst of
[1:38:44] all of it God knew how it this thing
[1:38:47] would unfold God had already spoken and
[1:38:50] said is true Sarah I give the promise of
[1:38:53] of the son Isaac to be born and I don't
[1:38:56] care what interpretation you try to put
[1:38:58] it my word shall not return void and
[1:39:02] Abraham sometimes felt uncertain one
[1:39:05] time Abraham went out and spoke to God
[1:39:08] and he said how can I be the father of
[1:39:10] Nations seeing I go childless and God
[1:39:13] said why you looking at your

[1:39:39] can forget about the natural plug into
[1:39:42] the supernatural plug into what God Said

[1:39:48] Holy Ghost is certain the power of God
[1:39:50] is certain the promise of God is certain
[1:39:53] the anointing of God is
[1:39:55] setting somebody say

[1:40:35] but the Supernatural is eternal the
[1:40:37] supernatural Knows No Time restraints it
[1:40:40] has no time limits which means you could
[1:40:43] pray any time and talk to your court
[1:40:46] which means you could believe any time
[1:40:49] and talk to your C which means you could
[1:40:51] pick up the Bible any time and say I
[1:40:54] believe what's spoken in this book I
[1:40:57] believe every promise is for me I
[1:41:00] believe the words that are preach here

[1:42:10] hallelujah
[1:42:14] hallelujah it's in a time of the
[1:42:18] uncertainty where your faith is tested
[1:42:21] amen amen amen that's
[1:42:26] you know the disciples they when you
[1:42:29] read the scripture in St John
[1:42:31] 20 they were shut off shut off for fa of
[1:42:35] the
[1:42:36] Jews and it was a time of
[1:42:39] uncertainty because here it was that
[1:42:41] they were walking with
[1:42:42] Jesus they seen Miracles they seen
[1:42:45] revivals break
[1:42:46] out they seen the power of
[1:42:49] God they seen a sick heal they seen a
[1:42:52] Dey yes Gyro's daughter brought to life
[1:42:56] some of them were Witnesses of them
[1:42:59] isn't that right all these marvelous
[1:43:01] things isn't that right they were there
[1:43:05] in times of uncertainty when it was
[1:43:07] spoken about when Jesus was going on the
[1:43:09] other side and there come a storm to
[1:43:12] blow up and Jesus was asleep in the boat
[1:43:15] isn't that right Bible says he was
[1:43:17] asleep on a pillow in the hinder part of
[1:43:19] the ship he was so asleep that he didn't
[1:43:22] feel the boat rocking he didn't feel the
[1:43:25] boat shaking I don't know about you but
[1:43:28] a storm in a boat is a very scary
[1:43:32] thing is a very shaken kind of a thing
[1:43:35] yes sir it's one thing to be at home in
[1:43:38] a storm hidden away in a house under a
[1:43:41] safe roof or shelter but there's another
[1:43:43] thing entirely to be out in the in the
[1:43:45] ocean in the sea because there's no sh
[1:43:48] ground there's no sh footing what you
[1:43:51] are standing on
[1:43:53] is literally moving up and down 10ft
[1:43:57] waves the Bible said the water that was
[1:43:59] outside of the boat was coming inside of
[1:44:02] the boat the Bible said the ship was
[1:44:05] full the the disciples got very scared
[1:44:08] they got very frightened and I could
[1:44:11] totally understand why hallelujah
[1:44:13] hallelujah because they were in a
[1:44:15] situation that seemed uncertain there
[1:44:18] was nowhere for them to run there was
[1:44:20] nowhere for them to hide and if they had
[1:44:22] wait any longer the scripture might have
[1:44:25] been different but then they went
[1:44:28] somebody got the inspiration to go and
[1:44:30] wait Jesus we need Jesus right now we
[1:44:34] done all we can we hoisted the sails we
[1:44:38] man the decks we've done all we could do
[1:44:41] but this ship is going down brother if
[1:44:43] we don't call on Jesus somebody go get
[1:44:47] Jesus and I'm saying this morning
[1:44:50] somebody go wake Jesus we we need him in
[1:44:53] this hour we need him right now we need
[1:44:57] him in this situation oh we will not
[1:45:00] make
[1:45:03] it
[1:45:07] oh
[1:45:09] hallelujah
[1:45:11] hallelujah what a Blessed Assurance to
[1:45:14] know that they could go and wake Jesus
[1:45:16] they could go and wake the master I'm
[1:45:18] sure that wasn't the first ship that
[1:45:20] ever got caught out in a storm in the
[1:45:22] ocean many ships got battered destroyed
[1:45:25] there are stories of people who drowned
[1:45:27] at sea but here it was these disciples
[1:45:30] had an opportunity to gowake Jesus it
[1:45:34] takes something to gowake Jesus it means
[1:45:36] you have to put away Pride it means you
[1:45:39] have to put away what you know about
[1:45:41] sailing boats you don't know no more
[1:45:44] this situation is more than you you need
[1:45:47] somebody who could control the situation
[1:45:54] oh
[1:45:56] Hallelujah and that's what God like to
[1:45:58] do god like to put us in situations
[1:46:01] where we don't know no more where we not
[1:46:03] in control no more where we don't know
[1:46:06] it all where our education can help us
[1:46:09] where all certificates can't help us
[1:46:12] where all of our knowledge all know all
[1:46:14] Mysteries you can break scripture but if
[1:46:17] you don't have charity you don't have
[1:46:19] nothing so you better get up all inside
[1:46:22] of here
[1:46:23] oh Hallelujah and pray for charity
[1:46:26] because charity never
[1:46:28] fail oh hallelujah

[1:46:56] gospel in a storm that's not going to

[1:47:02] works brother you better get to praying
[1:47:05] you better go to calling out on God it
[1:47:08] is in those times of uncertainty where
[1:47:11] God's strength is proven more than your
[1:47:14] strength because in your weakness his
[1:47:17] strength is made perfect oh only when
[1:47:20] you are perfectly weak then he becomes
[1:47:23] perfectly strong oh not 99 and 910 but
[1:47:28] you are totally dead and then God comes
[1:47:31] to the rescue oh hallelujah
[1:47:35] hallelujah oh somebody praise him I know
[1:47:39] somebody know what I'm talking about
[1:47:41] this morning oh hallelujah

[1:47:54] you care that we
[1:47:57] perish
[1:47:59] Jesus what I love about Jesus is he
[1:48:01] doesn't let he never lets the atmosphere
[1:48:03] around him dictate his answer to every
[1:48:08] question he's always in the right
[1:48:11] atmosphere and I know there's going to
[1:48:14] come a day where there'll be sons of God
[1:48:16] on the earth Daughters of God on the
[1:48:18] earth who will be always in the right
[1:48:21] atmosphere oh it won't be you no more it

[1:48:36] down you are standing on the only thing
[1:48:39] that is certain that is a rock that is

[1:59:10] that right he said he giveth power to
[1:59:13] the faint and to them that have no might

[1:59:19] on to say that even the youth shall
[1:59:21] faint and be wary oh Hallelujah young
[1:59:24] people feel like we have endless energy
[1:59:28] and we could go all night or we could do
[1:59:30] what we want to and aspire to anything

[1:59:36] not aware sometimes that there's a time

[1:59:59] right now to make a decision is the best
[2:00:01] time to make a change is the best time
[2:00:03] to make a clearcut decision to serve God

[2:00:12] stand for God to stay with the word and
[2:00:15] to stay with his promises all you have
[2:00:18] is right now because tomorrow is

[2:00:40] in these times of uncertainty that I

[2:00:45] opportunity to make a choice whether we
[2:00:48] going to stand or we going to fall to
[2:00:51] make a Choice whether we going to go all
[2:00:53] the way or we going to turn back and go
[2:00:56] back fishing Hallelujah isn't that right
[2:01:00] if we're going to go back to our selfish
[2:01:01] ideas if we're going to go back to our
[2:01:03] humanistic or if we're going to press on
[2:01:05] by faith and if we're going to believe
[2:01:08] God I know God put something inside of
[2:01:10] our hearts this morning to believe him
[2:01:13] in spite of the situation in spite of
[2:01:16] the circumstance in spite of what we
[2:01:18] could see around us that is not going to
[2:01:21] dictate this morning how we are going to
[2:01:24] worship how we believe God what God says
[2:01:27] concerning the scripture it's not going
[2:01:29] to dictate my atmosphere you can dictate
[2:01:32] your own atmosphere this morning you
[2:01:35] could create your own atmosphere of
[2:01:37] worship your own atmosphere of Faith
[2:01:39] your own atmosphere of belief throw
[2:01:42] doubt out the door throw fear out the
[2:01:45] door oh fair and faith cannot occupy the

[2:01:52] whom you are going to serve either it's
[2:01:55] Faith or doubt oh I choose to have faith
[2:01:58] this morning I choose to say the devil
[2:02:02] is a liar this morning I choose to defy
[2:02:05] gravity and to stand up and to put my
[2:02:08] hands in the air and to worship God I

[2:03:39] wait wait on
[2:03:42] God wait for
[2:03:44] God you run ahead out of God's program
[2:03:47] and you end up messing things
[2:03:49] up isn't that right
[2:03:52] it happened that time the prophet had
[2:03:54] that that vision of the the baby is
[2:03:56] supposed to be healed I think and uh he
[2:03:58] ran ahead of the vision God showed him a
[2:04:01] certain certain thing that's supposed to
[2:04:03] happen the glasses the person coming in
[2:04:06] and it's supposed to happen in certain
[2:04:07] order and the prophet went ahead he was
[2:04:09] a human being I guess he was anticipated
[2:04:12] he was excited maybe he felt in his own
[2:04:15] ability that he could do something about
[2:04:17] the situation ahead of God's vision and
[2:04:20] then the situation got worse
[2:04:22] and he had to
[2:04:24] wait he had no choice in that moment his
[2:04:27] prayer didn't work he had to wait for
[2:04:31] God he had to wait for the time and
[2:04:35] sometimes we want things to work out
[2:04:36] right now and God say no wait sometimes
[2:04:41] we want things to work out right away we
[2:04:44] feel frustrated we feel oh God I can't
[2:04:46] take it I feel like giving up I feel my
[2:04:49] soul tearing apart yes in that time of
[2:04:52] uncertainty you are forced to do nothing
[2:04:55] else but wait upon God and wait for God
[2:04:59] he gave strength to the weary even the
[2:05:02] you shall faint but they that wait upon
[2:05:05] the Lord shall renew their strength they
[2:05:08] shall run and not be wary they shall
[2:05:10] walk and not faint if you could only
[2:05:12] wait upon him and Trust in his name
[2:05:16] he'll give you strength this morning
[2:05:18] like you never knew you had oh h
[2:05:21] hallelujah hallelujah God wants
[2:05:24] something to break out inside of
[2:05:26] [Applause]
[2:05:28] you sometimes he's got you there holding
[2:05:32] waiting and the devil is playing his run
[2:05:35] too look what happened here look what
[2:05:37] happened there there was a time of
[2:05:39] uncertainty when the prophet lost his
[2:05:41] child lost his wife lost everything time
[2:05:45] of uncertainty he wanted to kill himself
[2:05:48] picked up the gun it wouldn't go off
[2:05:50] said oh God what is this but then our
[2:05:52] faith rose up inside of him though he
[2:05:54] slain me yet I trust him oh Hallelujah
[2:05:58] the devil was playing with his mind
[2:06:01] playing with his emotions slowly
[2:06:03] breaking him down and he was a prophet
[2:06:06] yet he was a human being just like you
[2:06:09] and me he was driven almost to the brink
[2:06:11] of insanity yet in that moment in that
[2:06:15] time of
[2:06:17] uncertainty God proed himself strong he
[2:06:21] had the anchor that would hold amidst
[2:06:25] the storm oh the storm is Raging though
[2:06:30] the winds are battering though the wind
[2:06:32] blow contrary though the waves try to
[2:06:35] take you over the anchors got to hold oh
[2:06:39] don't you be afraid this morning let
[2:06:42] your anchor grip the solid rock this
[2:06:45] morning forget about what you can't see
[2:06:48] forget about what you can't hear I might
[2:06:51] be able to hear from God but the devil
[2:06:54] cannot move me this morning I'm standing
[2:06:57] on a solid rock oh upon which I stand
[2:07:01] all of the ground is sinking sand
[2:07:03] nothing else will save us in the end but
[2:07:06] Jesus the same
[2:07:08] yesterday the same today the same
[2:07:10] forever oh

[2:07:22] oh hallelujah hallelujah when you drop
[2:07:25] an anchor from a ship it doesn't hold
[2:07:26] right away sometimes you have to wait a
[2:07:27] little bit it drags along the surface
[2:07:29] looking for a rock looking for a
[2:07:32] stronghold looking for something to hold
[2:07:34] to then when it hangs there oh glory to
[2:07:39] God sometimes you have to wait the an is
[2:07:42] dragging is only sand there the devil
[2:07:45] trying to lie to you but then all of a
[2:07:47] sudden Wang it hits the anchor oh
[2:07:50] Hallelujah God's Got all of you now
[2:07:52] doesn't matter what the winds say
[2:07:54] doesn't matter what the storm say I've

[2:08:17] held me something kept me oh Hallelujah
[2:08:21] isn't that right oh do you feel like way
[2:08:24] this
[2:08:25] morning amen
[2:08:27] amen so let me to get back to my
[2:08:29] scripture real quick and then we rounds
[2:08:30] up here that's be it that'll be about it
[2:08:33] but here was the church in St John
[2:08:36] 20 Jesus gone and they had shut up the
[2:08:39] door because of fear they were
[2:08:42] scared they were leaderless they were
[2:08:45] powerless what a position to be in this
[2:08:49] is God's people they were call out from
[2:08:51] from the world call out from the church
[2:08:54] separated walking with an anointed
[2:08:56] Messiah isn't that right signs wonders
[2:09:00] Miracles accompanying his ministry what
[2:09:02] a glorious Church to be in oh hallelujah
[2:09:06] hallelujah you need something to eat
[2:09:07] tastes bread and fish he multiplies it
[2:09:10] this happened that happened there's an
[2:09:11] answer for every situation oh are such a
[2:09:14] wonderful thing to walk with Jesus until
[2:09:18] all of a sudden they were found naked
[2:09:21] amen he's gone his precious little
[2:09:23] church that he called out about 3 and 1
[2:09:26] half years or so they've been walking
[2:09:27] with him some of them didn't know who he
[2:09:29] was some of them were just glad to be
[2:09:31] along for the ride but all all of a
[2:09:34] sudden the ride was finally over they
[2:09:36] found themselves alone shut off
[2:09:40] afraid scared without a leader no power
[2:09:45] no visible evidence of any presence that
[2:09:48] is with them no strength to go on no
[2:09:51] strength for tomorrow that was probably
[2:09:53] the worst service to ever be
[2:09:55] in am what do you say in a service like
[2:10:00] that my and in that atmosphere they
[2:10:04] realized that something was
[2:10:06] missing isn't that right that they
[2:10:09] needed God they needed that atmosphere
[2:10:12] that was Upon Jesus they realized that
[2:10:14] they needed more than just Jesus being
[2:10:16] with them they needed that same spirit
[2:10:19] in them it wasn't good enough for him to
[2:10:21] be in front of them it wasn't good
[2:10:23] enough for him to be around them and for
[2:10:25] him to say nice words but what they
[2:10:27] needed was that Blessed Assurance what
[2:10:31] they needed in that situation was an
[2:10:33] anchor to hold but there was nothing to
[2:10:36] hold to oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't
[2:10:39] that right they had forgotten all he had
[2:10:42] told them isn't that right they needed
[2:10:44] their own witness of power amen amen
[2:10:47] hallelujah so Jesus being absent in that
[2:10:50] moment in that time of uncertainty it
[2:10:54] exposed the truth of what their real
[2:10:56] situation was isn't that right and the
[2:10:58] Bible said the doors were shut for faar
[2:11:01] of the Jews isn't that right the doors
[2:11:03] were closed and they were so afraid but
[2:11:07] then all of a sudden Jesus steps into
[2:11:10] the
[2:11:11] room and I love that kind of a scripture
[2:11:14] because anytime Jesus comes something
[2:11:17] special always happens anytime Jesus
[2:11:20] comes on the scene something always
[2:11:23] takes place you could have a crowd of
[2:11:25] people sitting here but if the presence
[2:11:28] of God is not here then this is just a
[2:11:30] crowd of people but once the presence of
[2:11:33] God steps into the atmosphere the scene
[2:11:37] changes the Devils get scared things
[2:11:41] begin to happen because Jesus is more
[2:11:43] than a man he is God made flesh he is a
[2:11:47] Vindication of God upon the Earth and
[2:11:51] manifestation of a present tense God and
[2:11:54] God always wanted to be with his people
[2:11:58] and he found a way to do it through
[2:12:00] Jesus oh isn't that right and here his
[2:12:04] power come here his glory come hallu and
[2:12:08] this to me is one of Jesus's greatest
[2:12:11] displays of power isn't that right since
[2:12:15] ever he was on the earth he had rose
[2:12:18] from the dead and you had already given
[2:12:20] a witness to the sister earlier that
[2:12:23] morning he told them go and tell my
[2:12:25] disciples I am not dead but I am alive
[2:12:29] and he told them go and meet me I'm
[2:12:30] coming to get you oh and they came with
[2:12:33] a good report oh Hallelujah but those
[2:12:35] Brothers weren't there for that service
[2:12:37] that morning so they came for the
[2:12:39] evening service and they didn't have a
[2:12:41] witness they were looking for a witness
[2:12:44] But Here Come Jesus into the building oh
[2:12:48] Hallelujah here come the presence of God
[2:12:51] the Bible says they were glad when they
[2:12:54] saw the Lord and the most lovely part I
[2:12:56] love about it is that the Bible said
[2:12:58] that the doors were shut they closed the
[2:13:01] doors yet Jesus found a way inside and I
[2:13:07] don't care this morning what door you
[2:13:10] close you could shut your doors this
[2:13:12] morning you could close up your doors
[2:13:14] this morning if God want to get inside
[2:13:18] he's going to find a way to get in
[2:13:21] inside but he's coming in there's no
[2:13:24] shut door that could keep Jesus out this
[2:13:28] morning oh if God want to deliver he's
[2:13:32] going to deliver if God want to heal
[2:13:35] he's going to heal if God going to seal
[2:13:38] with the Holy Ghost he's going to do
[2:13:41] it oh
[2:13:43] [Applause]
[2:13:45] hallelujah
[2:13:47] hallelujah
[2:13:48] hallelujah no closed door
[2:13:51] could stop God roll away the stone this
[2:13:54] morning God Is Bigger Than That Door God
[2:13:57] Is Bigger than that circumstance God Is
[2:13:59] Bigger Than That situation God Is Bigger
[2:14:01] Than That mind he'll throw you in a sick
[2:14:04] bed if you have to he'll throw you in a
[2:14:06] bed of Affliction he'll break your legs
[2:14:09] if you have to but if God wants to get
[2:14:11] in your life he will break down any door
[2:14:15] to get inside but he's coming inside
[2:14:22] oh Hallelujah I'm so glad that Jesus Set
[2:14:26] Me Free this morning I'm so glad he
[2:14:28] broke my chains I'm so glad he broke my
[2:14:31] circumstance I'm so glad he broke
[2:14:33] everything around me to set me

[2:14:55] greatest displays of power he raised
[2:14:58] from the dead oh hallelujah hallelujah
[2:15:01] hallelujah death couldn't hold him he
[2:15:03] told them destroy this Temple and in
[2:15:06] three days I will raise it up myself
[2:15:09] that's not any kind of power no Prophet
[2:15:12] was able to do this before no Sage was
[2:15:15] able to do this before no priest could
[2:15:17] do this no Bishop could do this no no no
[2:15:20] this is more than man power this is
[2:15:23] Supernatural power this is a power to
[2:15:25] heal the sick power to raise the dead
[2:15:28] power to cast out Devils power to push
[2:15:32] back sickness power to push back
