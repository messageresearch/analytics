[12:35] thank you name of the lord
[12:38] certainly a great privilege thank you so
[12:40] much brother anthony it's certainly a
[12:41] great privilege to be here tonight can
[12:43] we just bow our heads for a word of
[12:46] prayer
[12:47] our gracious heavenly father we thank
[12:49] you this evening lord to be able to
[12:52] gather
[12:53] lord in your presence we thank you
[12:57] for this privilege this sailor this
[12:59] pause this time
[13:02] lord where we could cut through the
[13:03] noise and we could interrupt
[13:06] the schedule of our lives that at times
[13:10] almost feels as if it has been planned
[13:12] out for us because situations come
[13:15] challenges come
[13:17] issues arise that
[13:20] would attempt to just pull our time pull
[13:23] our attention
[13:24] pull away our focus so we thank you for
[13:27] this
[13:28] welcome interruption lord it's not
[13:31] always
[13:32] convenient father but
[13:35] lord it is a decision that we have made
[13:39] to report in for duty as soldiers
[13:43] against sometimes how we feel against
[13:46] the stresses of our lives to come
[13:48] together around your word knowing that
[13:50] it's an opening a window a door into the
[13:54] heavenlies and the mind of god and that
[13:57] just five minutes in the presence of god
[14:00] could change
[14:01] our situation could change our
[14:04] circumstances and so many times we look
[14:07] at things
[14:08] one way and when we come into the
[14:10] presence of god we see it your way help
[14:13] us to see it your way tonight may you
[14:16] speak to us through your word
[14:18] lord may you use me as your instrument
[14:22] may you take control of my vocal cords
[14:24] and bring my thoughts
[14:27] lord under your control lord we submit
[14:31] ourselves to your authority tonight we
[14:33] pray for the body of believers that have
[14:35] gathered here tonight we pray for those
[14:37] that may hear this tape we pray for
[14:39] those that are yet to join us
[14:41] lord we commit this study into your
[14:43] hands and we pray for lord every person
[14:46] and their own individual challenges
[14:49] their own situations
[14:51] those that they are comfortable to share
[14:53] or speak and even those that they don't
[14:55] want anybody to know about but we thank
[14:57] you that you are lord the great
[14:59] physician you are the great healer you
[15:02] are a great mighty counselor all the
[15:05] psychologists and the psychiatrists and
[15:07] the counselors and the gurus as it were
[15:10] are just are just a fraction of what you
[15:13] are as the great counselor so may you
[15:15] counsel us through your word tonight and
[15:18] lord may it be that we could leave this
[15:20] meeting with a different perspective you
[15:22] said be he transformed by the renewing
[15:25] of our minds lord that renewing of our
[15:28] minds is a reboot as it were
[15:31] lord it is it is it has been such a
[15:34] different year and as we come to the end
[15:36] of this journey of this 2020 that has
[15:39] been filled with so many curve balls and
[15:42] so many corners and so many turns we
[15:45] thank you for your spiritual leadership
[15:47] that has helped us tune every corner so
[15:49] we commit to service into your hands
[15:51] lord and if there's anyone sick anyone
[15:53] needing a touch as the word goes forth
[15:56] lord may healing come with the word lord
[15:58] as you said you would do you are still
[16:00] in control we commit it into your hands
[16:02] today in the precious name of jesus
[16:04] christ amen amen
[16:06] amen well it's certainly a great
[16:08] privilege to be together again
[16:11] just praising the lord
[16:13] and to be reporting for duty
[16:16] in such a time as this and i
[16:19] want to firstly start by really
[16:21] appreciating
[16:23] uh brother obit for the service on
[16:24] sunday uh last sunday was really a
[16:27] tremendous tremendous masterpiece of a
[16:29] message
[16:30] so run that you may obtain
[16:33] and
[16:34] it the way it was presented
[16:37] and dealing with entitlement
[16:40] and dealing with the prodigal son i
[16:42] shared with him i've never seen it
[16:44] presented that way and i love it when we
[16:47] could look at the word
[16:49] and see it presented in in a way that is
[16:53] in line with the word but you can you
[16:55] can see the the the
[16:58] relatableness if that's a word of it you
[17:01] know to see that you could relate to the
[17:02] situation so i want to kind of continue
[17:05] along that vein
[17:07] uh tonight
[17:08] um
[17:09] so
[17:11] i have a little
[17:12] thought
[17:13] um so remember me in prayer
[17:16] and the internet has been acting up a
[17:18] little bit for me as well so if i do dip
[17:21] out but over that has assured me that he
[17:23] is standing by
[17:24] um
[17:26] if necessary
[17:28] um so for uh uh teaching tonight i want
[17:32] to call this the curse of entitlement
[17:35] the curse
[17:36] of entitlement and uh you know as
[17:39] beloved was preaching i just want to
[17:40] kind of talk with you you know bible
[17:42] studies these sessions on tuesday are
[17:43] conversation it's not a service so i can
[17:45] just kind of chat a little bit and have
[17:47] a conversation so i know you can't
[17:49] respond but i trust everybody's doing
[17:51] fine uh trust that
[17:52] um you know you're hanging in there i
[17:55] trust that you're sword sharp
[17:57] you know i stress that the trials that
[18:00] come in your way you know they have been
[18:02] designed for you
[18:03] i trust that the gifts of these trials
[18:06] that god has sent your way you
[18:08] realize by now that they are designed
[18:11] for you to come to maturity for you to
[18:13] be strong
[18:14] you know and
[18:15] uh you know as well as preaching on
[18:18] sunday you know i was looking at the
[18:20] word and i was looking at my own life
[18:22] and and that is my approach personally
[18:25] and if you could take a page from it
[18:27] tonight is
[18:28] it is that singleness of focus to see
[18:32] how the world impacts you
[18:34] it is very easy
[18:36] to wonder how you would attack impact
[18:38] somebody else you know it is nature to
[18:41] look at other people
[18:42] but when
[18:43] i'm
[18:44] you know in church or in a service i'm
[18:47] always looking to see how can i be
[18:50] stronger as a believer you know what can
[18:52] i learn from it it's easy to look at
[18:54] other people and say well you know
[18:55] that's a word for her or him or whatever
[18:57] but i really want
[18:59] to see how the world was impacting my
[19:01] life and this
[19:02] mentality of entitlement this spirit of
[19:05] entitlement
[19:07] it it got me
[19:09] you know at first i went from i went
[19:12] through different emotions if i could
[19:13] say that on on sunday different
[19:15] you know points and if you haven't seen
[19:16] the message i encourage you to to watch
[19:18] it and if you have seen it i encourage
[19:20] you to watch it again
[19:21] but i went through different emotions
[19:24] different thoughts as the service was
[19:26] going on because he was speaking about
[19:27] entitlement and
[19:30] and i realized that this thing goes as
[19:33] far as
[19:34] there will be people
[19:36] who they feel that they're entitled to
[19:40] go to heaven
[19:42] and they're not
[19:47] they're people who believe that they are
[19:49] entitled because they in the message
[19:51] they will make the rapture
[19:53] so i started to reach that point
[19:55] of looking at this thing called
[19:57] entitlement
[19:58] because this thing of entitlement
[20:00] it's when
[20:02] you convince yourself that you deserve
[20:04] something based on some pretext that is
[20:06] your own
[20:09] you know and as i was going through it i
[20:11] was looking at brother representing the
[20:13] prodigal son and i was kind of starting
[20:15] to look through scripture and i was like
[20:18] i never really thought of it that way
[20:19] because you know we say and when we
[20:20] preach you see you know the bible say
[20:22] one day people go and say lord lord i've
[20:24] done all these things for you
[20:26] and god will say depart from me you
[20:28] workers of iniquity you work of iniquity
[20:31] so it means that that person who is
[20:32] speaking to god actually believes that
[20:34] what they have done
[20:36] was enough to qualify them to enter in
[20:38] and god is saying it really wasn't
[20:41] the fact that he has to address it to
[20:43] them and say depart from me
[20:45] is shattering their belief that they
[20:48] were qualified
[20:49] it is shattering their belief that they
[20:51] were entitled
[20:53] you know and i've beloved said something
[20:55] really powerful sunday and i and and it
[20:57] it shook me because he said that during
[20:59] his whole pandemic and i was seeing a
[21:01] statistic
[21:02] um
[21:03] published by
[21:05] a group of christian
[21:07] you know
[21:09] analysts around the world
[21:10] and they were actually saying during
[21:12] this pandemic
[21:14] as far as they can tell
[21:16] one-fifth
[21:18] meaning one out of every five christians
[21:21] in this pandemic have not shown up for
[21:23] virtual service
[21:28] so they were going to say that so
[21:30] brother made a statement on sunday he
[21:32] said this pandemic
[21:34] some people will go out
[21:35] and say people will come in
[21:38] and it may be as i was just going
[21:40] through i'm just sharing with you i'm
[21:41] going to get to the teaching in a bit
[21:42] just sharing some thoughts with you to
[21:44] so just you know play some context on
[21:46] where i'm at
[21:47] so i was just wondering so i say the
[21:49] people who haven't shown up
[21:52] um because if church coming to your home
[21:55] now as it is
[21:57] then what is the excuse
[21:59] if you're not working on your home
[22:02] then
[22:03] why wouldn't somebody connect
[22:06] but if you have a conversation with them
[22:08] they actually feel entitled
[22:11] or they believe that they still go into
[22:13] heaven or they believe in their in their
[22:15] context that they're on the way to the
[22:17] rapture if you ask them a question you
[22:19] know where's the destination as
[22:21] they're comfortable because there's some
[22:24] level of entitlement
[22:26] and when you look through the word
[22:29] there's no
[22:30] there's no support for that position
[22:33] the only way people can miss something
[22:35] is because they thought they were there
[22:36] and wound
[22:38] because there's nobody
[22:41] i can't find somebody who is
[22:42] deliberately trying to miss the rapture
[22:44] so so let me tell you so people aren't
[22:46] coming to church trying to miss the
[22:48] rapture
[22:49] that that that doesn't mathematically
[22:51] add up unless there's something mentally
[22:53] wrong with you people are not showing up
[22:55] to church deliberately trying to sell
[22:57] sabotage it is not deliberate
[23:00] so if it is not deliberate then it means
[23:02] that there is this expectation that is
[23:05] not in alignment so call it a personal
[23:08] expectation that is not in alignment
[23:10] with god's expectation
[23:12] because i find it very difficult to
[23:14] believe that after all these years
[23:17] of hearing the word
[23:19] of seeing scripture fulfilled of seeing
[23:22] the unfolding of prophecy yes but
[23:24] ibraheem would say modern events made
[23:26] clear by profiting but by by prophecy so
[23:29] it's happening before very eyes how
[23:31] people could be complacent
[23:33] and and entitlement is really it's
[23:35] really taking it for granted
[23:38] so it's there's so many ways to look at
[23:40] it so in time so i take it for granted
[23:43] because of x this should happen
[23:46] and the reality is god doesn't operate
[23:49] that way
[23:50] you know what it really said a shakeman
[23:51] to our core so i started to look in
[23:53] scripture to get a a basis for it and
[23:55] but we kind of kind of mentioned some
[23:58] things but
[23:59] you know
[24:00] our society has developed into this
[24:03] level of entitlement so i could speak
[24:06] from a position of being a manager so to
[24:09] speak
[24:11] so you have people who graduate
[24:13] from
[24:14] university
[24:16] and they believe that because they have
[24:18] a degree
[24:19] they're entitled to certain things
[24:22] it has nothing to do with whether they
[24:24] have the experience
[24:26] whether they could deliver value
[24:29] it is an entitlement that comes from
[24:31] well i did this so i should have this
[24:35] so within we'll say within certain
[24:37] professions or certain industries or
[24:39] within the government sector or there's
[24:41] this entitlement that comes with well
[24:43] i've been here for a long time so i have
[24:46] seniority
[24:47] so because i have seniority i am
[24:50] entitled to whether it is the promotion
[24:53] the parking spot i'm entitled to the
[24:55] cubicle or the corner office
[24:58] so it is something that is spiritual and
[25:00] it's natural and people either fight
[25:03] because they feel they're entitled they
[25:05] they they fight a certain way so
[25:08] the point i'm trying to make is sunday
[25:10] service brought to the surface all the
[25:14] things that we are entitled to and amber
[25:16] of it brought this powerful thought
[25:18] about the connection between entitlement
[25:21] and comparison
[25:23] and i will show in scripture
[25:25] how much god hates that and two specific
[25:29] references of that comparison and the
[25:32] entitlement issue
[25:34] so if i were to identify tonight what
[25:36] the teaching points out of this session
[25:38] is tonight
[25:40] it is to strip away that feeling of
[25:42] entitlement
[25:43] that taken it for granted
[25:46] that that because there's a scripture
[25:47] that speaks of don't let a man eat if he
[25:50] a work
[25:51] the fact that the scripture needs to be
[25:53] said means there are people who want to
[25:54] eat without working
[25:56] so
[25:57] if every situation didn't make did not
[25:59] exist there would be no need for the
[26:01] scripture so god had to push gifted
[26:03] every man i want to work he shouldn't he
[26:05] don't deserve to eat if you don't want
[26:06] to work
[26:07] so he was making a connection between i
[26:10] call it earning or working
[26:13] and i may have said it before but the
[26:14] root word for worship
[26:17] and the root word for work is the same
[26:20] word
[26:21] so work and worship are connected so
[26:23] worship is actually a form of work
[26:27] and we know through scripture that prays
[26:29] is a sacrifice and a sacrifice means
[26:32] that there's a cost to something
[26:34] and madoven was really inspired when he
[26:36] talked about the free and we actually
[26:38] see it in scripture what is free and
[26:40] saying okay there's there's nothing
[26:42] really free there is a cost so so
[26:44] salvation is free but there's the cost
[26:47] which was calvary
[26:49] so i want us to to understand that
[26:51] there's a there's work there's always
[26:54] work involved
[26:55] so salvation is free but jesus worked
[27:00] and the believers who will climb the
[27:03] mountain
[27:04] it can be out of laziness or it is not
[27:08] accidental it has to be deliberate so
[27:10] you have to have a mindset so i realized
[27:13] so much this mindset because if you have
[27:16] this entitlement situation going on it
[27:19] means you take this position of
[27:23] give me do for me i should have it so
[27:25] because i i should have it i don't need
[27:26] to work for it because i'm entitled to
[27:29] it
[27:30] and it removes the need to work for
[27:33] something and i want us to push past it
[27:35] because coming tonight is work
[27:38] i coordinate over a little while ago i
[27:39] say i actually just got home i had a
[27:42] meeting
[27:43] it is not as if home i sit along twitter
[27:45] in my terms
[27:47] everything in in life is work
[27:50] prayer is work
[27:52] reading your bible is work
[27:54] going to work is work
[27:57] you have to work on your marriage you
[27:59] have to work on your relationship with
[28:01] your children
[28:02] you have to work to be in church on time
[28:05] you have to work to be in this meeting
[28:07] tonight
[28:08] so everything is about work and it is it
[28:10] is that activity and that that forward
[28:13] movement that forward momentum finding a
[28:17] way to reach where you need to reach so
[28:20] i want to encourage you tonight
[28:22] by kind of digging a bit more into this
[28:25] issue of entitlement
[28:27] the the mentality of it the spirit of it
[28:30] and as my title is the curse of
[28:33] entitlement because
[28:35] if ever there was a time that people
[28:37] were entitled it's no people feel you
[28:40] know you walk in a place um
[28:42] let me get you wifi password now
[28:45] and there are some people who will walk
[28:47] into your home or your business whatever
[28:49] and if you give them your wi-fi they're
[28:51] looking at it as you are the problem you
[28:53] know
[28:56] they don't see it as is
[28:59] it's your wife as far as i said
[29:00] something wrong with you but not giving
[29:02] any wi-fi password because we have
[29:04] gotten
[29:06] entitled we feel we deserve to have it
[29:08] we we need to connect we are we are
[29:11] so it is something that is so pervasive
[29:13] there are people who feel they're
[29:14] entitled to a certain seat in church
[29:18] people feel they're entitled to a
[29:19] certain part i'm not trying to go
[29:20] anywhere i just i just throw in context
[29:23] you know people feel they and so there's
[29:25] so much so i want us to continue to look
[29:27] because brother had me going through
[29:30] my own introspection because always the
[29:34] word has to make you look at yourself to
[29:37] see how you're lining up with your word
[29:38] and to see if there's any behavior that
[29:40] you have
[29:41] that shouldn't be there
[29:43] and
[29:44] automatically self-correct
[29:46] self-correct is like a gps i don't know
[29:48] if you ever use a gps or use waze or
[29:51] something and you know if you miss a
[29:52] corner the thing automatically will tell
[29:55] you okay make the next right
[29:57] and if you fly past that next right it
[29:59] will tell you we'll make the next right
[30:00] because they're trying to get you back
[30:02] to wherever your destination was that
[30:04] you're supposed to be going
[30:05] and every surface for a service was is
[30:07] is about really self-correction it's
[30:09] about the world committee say listen
[30:12] you're going too much in the election or
[30:13] get back to the highway you know so that
[30:15] is the context so i want to study
[30:17] teaching
[30:18] i don't intend to be too long with you
[30:19] tonight
[30:20] um so i want to start by saying our
[30:23] society our world even the church
[30:26] business
[30:27] has this entitlement mentality
[30:30] i can't tell you how many business
[30:33] people have spoken to
[30:34] who feel that thing should just work out
[30:38] and it's it's an entitlement that it it
[30:40] is that it should happen and it really
[30:43] shouldn't happen until you make it
[30:45] happen because there's no
[30:47] accident there's no there's no it's
[30:49] supposed to it is all about work
[30:53] and this is not just natural it is
[30:55] scriptural because the israelites
[30:58] coming out of egypt
[31:00] had such a horrible
[31:02] entitlement mindset it was it was
[31:05] incredible amaro will reference it
[31:08] we know the story the children of israel
[31:11] was in egypt in bondage
[31:13] and they cried out to god
[31:15] to take them out of bondage we know this
[31:18] god dropped the plagues
[31:23] their bondage
[31:25] but yet still when they come out and
[31:28] they break out and they never thought
[31:30] they could get out and they really
[31:31] wanted to get out and they had a hard
[31:33] labor and their grandfather was a slave
[31:36] and their father was a slave
[31:58] we just praise the lord uh he maybe just
[32:00] dropped out but we could still give god
[32:02] some praises lord we praise you lord we
[32:04] thank you lord we worship you we honor
[32:06] you
[32:07] blessed be the name of the lord
[32:10] hallelujah glory to god
[32:12] amen so bear with me tonight
[32:17] so i had reached i was staying exodus
[32:22] exodus 16 3.
[32:32] and the children of israel said unto
[32:34] them
[32:34] [Music]
[32:35] word to god
[32:40] we have died by the hand of the lord in
[32:43] the land of egypt
[32:45] when we sat by the flesh spots which is
[32:48] which is the meat
[32:51] and when we did eat bread to the full in
[32:53] other words we hate till we couldn't eat
[32:56] no more
[32:59] for he had brought us forth into this
[33:01] wilderness to kill
[33:03] this whole assembly with hunger
[33:06] so hold on
[33:08] these are the same people who cried they
[33:10] were in bondage for
[33:12] 400 years
[33:14] and now that they're out of bondage
[33:16] they're actually making a comparison
[33:19] between the meat
[33:21] and the bread that they ate in their
[33:23] full
[33:27] so now let's get to my substantive so
[33:28] we're going to go to the book of numbers
[33:30] 11
[33:34] numbers 11
[33:37] and we're going to read from this one
[33:42] and this is where we're going to spend
[33:43] most of our time tonight and we're going
[33:45] to try to bring it to a close
[33:47] like i said forgive me if my connection
[33:49] drops
[33:53] so numbers 11
[33:55] how many lovely book of numbers
[34:03] numbers 11 and verse 1.
[34:05] and when the people complained
[34:08] it displeased the lord
[34:11] all right so i want to start i want to
[34:13] stop right here for one second
[34:15] you know how much people love to
[34:16] complain
[34:20] before we go deeper
[34:24] one of the worst things you could do as
[34:25] a believer is complain
[34:29] i have to look at myself you have to
[34:31] look at yourself
[34:32] we complain too much you know
[34:36] you complain about the traffic
[34:38] you complain
[34:40] people who drive in too slow you
[34:41] complain
[34:42] the list your complaint list god help us
[34:46] to bring our complaints to zero
[34:48] that's that's does he challenge what i
[34:50] want to challenge everybody with tonight
[34:53] stop complaining
[34:55] you could change your life tonight by
[34:57] just stop complaining
[35:01] i was challenging we had an officers uh
[35:03] uh uh uh our team leaders meeting and i
[35:05] challenged the leaders
[35:08] i said listen
[35:10] re change your complaining into into
[35:12] gratefulness that whatever it was
[35:13] teaching that on sunday was so powerful
[35:15] because for everything you can write
[35:17] down right on everything i want to
[35:18] complain about and i could tell you the
[35:21] list is much longer about what you could
[35:23] be thankful about
[35:24] and if you don't know where to start
[35:26] just thank god that you're alive let's
[35:28] start with that
[35:30] because i don't know what complaint you
[35:31] possibly could have that could even deal
[35:33] with the fact that you're alive
[35:36] did you eat today whether you eat cricks
[35:39] whether you eat eat lettuce you remember
[35:42] we read the scripture in proverbs better
[35:44] is a meal of herbs
[35:48] where love is you remember we had a
[35:50] conversation so whether today was crits
[35:52] and and bitter herbs
[35:56] you have something to thank god for but
[35:57] i want you to see it's not just about
[35:59] not complaining i want you to see that
[36:01] when the people complete it displeased
[36:03] the lord
[36:04] and the lord heard it
[36:06] so it's not just that god hearing your
[36:09] prayers or no god also here and he
[36:10] complains
[36:12] and your complaints affecting god
[36:16] now in the amplified that says now the
[36:19] people became like those who complain
[36:21] and whine about their hardships
[36:24] so it is not as if god don't know you
[36:26] have hardships in them but his point is
[36:28] don't complain
[36:30] and the lord heard it and when the lord
[36:32] heard it his anger was kindled
[36:35] all right
[36:37] and the fire of the lord burnt among
[36:40] them and consumed them that were in the
[36:42] uttermost part of the camp
[36:45] so god started to judge the eternal
[36:48] israel just because of complaining
[36:51] i want you to start to look at your life
[36:53] now i want to encourage you tonight by
[36:55] firstly saying you can't change your
[36:56] past you can't change what happened or
[36:59] ago or 20 years ago so we put in our uh
[37:02] our reset button in this meeting tonight
[37:07] your attitude your approach your
[37:09] statements whatever is going on prior to
[37:11] this meeting we put in our stopping it
[37:13] tonight and putting a hard reset because
[37:15] you can't change it but you have control
[37:18] from this meeting forward what happens
[37:20] next but i want us to draw reference
[37:24] that complaining actually brought death
[37:27] complaining broad judgment
[37:29] so complaining about your business your
[37:31] job your boss the rent the house the
[37:34] roof the car the church the neighbor the
[37:38] government the prime minister the police
[37:40] the election the whatever you want to
[37:42] complain about stop it there's there's
[37:44] nothing in scripture that supports
[37:46] complaining
[37:47] so we want to establish a foundation so
[37:49] when somebody have this complaining
[37:51] attitude they need to refer them to this
[37:54] the lord consumed them that way in the
[37:56] uttermost part of the camp
[37:58] so
[37:58] the lord burn around and devour those in
[38:01] the outlying part of the camp
[38:04] verse 2
[38:06] this is 11 and the people cried unto
[38:08] moses
[38:11] and when moses prayed unto the lord the
[38:13] fire was quenched
[38:15] so it was moses prayer god i wanted to
[38:17] see this now god was so upset at com and
[38:20] he complaining that he started to reign
[38:22] judgment and moses after the people come
[38:25] to moses said moses look what god doing
[38:27] moses went to pray to stop the judgment
[38:30] and what was he sin because remember sin
[38:32] is judgmental
[38:34] god only judges based on sin
[38:36] so what does that mean complaining
[38:39] is equal to a sinner
[38:42] uh-huh
[38:43] you never saw it that way before
[38:45] so let's bring a parallel here
[38:48] god rained fire on sodom and gomorrah
[38:51] for the way they lived god rained fire
[38:55] on the children of israel because
[38:56] they're complaining
[39:00] i want us to show sometimes we operate
[39:02] in that okay we are above this and we're
[39:04] above that and i don't do this and i
[39:06] don't do that and god say look at your
[39:07] complaining
[39:09] and he is angry because what complaining
[39:13] means is you throwing god's blessings
[39:15] back in his face let me say it again
[39:18] for you to complain because god is
[39:21] blessing you
[39:22] your next breath is a blessing come on
[39:25] now
[39:26] the air you just breathe is a blessing
[39:29] the fact that you can be here is a
[39:31] blessing some of us don't even see it
[39:33] that way
[39:34] the job you have is a blessing
[39:36] the little opportunities you have is a
[39:38] blessing because you are under a
[39:40] different covenant so other people can
[39:42] look at other things and attribute
[39:44] success or achievement to other things
[39:46] but whatever you have your lot your
[39:48] position is by the grace of god and when
[39:51] you come clean god sees it as after all
[39:54] i have done for you you still acting as
[39:56] if i haven't done nothing
[39:58] so i want you to reposition in your mind
[40:00] where complaining fits in
[40:03] and we're building now to how this is
[40:05] tied to entitlement now all right
[40:08] and the people cried unto moses and when
[40:09] moses prayed unto the lord the fire was
[40:12] quenched
[40:13] and he called the name of the place
[40:15] tavara because of the fire of the lord
[40:18] burned among them
[40:20] let's go to verse four
[40:23] and the mixed multitude
[40:26] that was among them fell a lasting
[40:30] now in the amplified
[40:32] it says the rabble among them who
[40:34] followed israel from egypt had greedy
[40:37] desires
[40:38] for familiar and delicious food
[40:43] and the israelites wept again so this is
[40:46] where it is mind-boggling to me
[40:48] because if you complain in
[40:51] verse one
[40:52] and you see what god did how could you
[40:54] come and even complain again
[40:56] so this reminds me of brother brad i'm
[40:58] saying he could preach till he blew any
[40:59] face
[41:01] until you are really converted your
[41:03] behavior not changing you know
[41:05] so they just witnessed people complain
[41:07] and god judge them and here it is and
[41:10] the mixed multitude that was among them
[41:12] fellow lusting and the children of
[41:14] israel also wept again
[41:17] and said who shall give us flesh to eat
[41:22] who will give us meat to eat is what the
[41:25] amplified says let's dig deeper
[41:27] now this is where berobe was preaching
[41:30] and i was like whoa
[41:33] listen to the context
[41:35] we remember the flesh we remember the
[41:37] fish
[41:38] which we did eat in egypt freely you see
[41:41] the word free leader we'll come back to
[41:43] that in a minute
[41:44] we remember the fish which we did eat in
[41:47] egypt freely
[41:49] the cucumbers
[41:50] and the melons and the leeks and the
[41:53] onions and the garlic
[41:57] so
[41:58] they were now
[41:59] they were actually equating
[42:02] they actually there's such a disconnect
[42:04] in their condition that they forgot that
[42:07] they were in bondage when they had this
[42:10] i want to catch that for a second
[42:16] let me let me just i want to just make
[42:17] another point here
[42:28] so even though it is free they actually
[42:31] forgot the great price that came with
[42:34] this free food
[42:39] they forgot the cost of this free food
[42:42] quarter goat free you remember robert
[42:44] was saying on sunday anything that is
[42:46] free somebody paying for it
[42:49] so they themselves were paying for their
[42:51] free food by their bondage
[42:55] it's very confusing to me to see this
[42:57] because it means that they were almost
[42:59] something like they were willing to give
[43:02] up freedom to go back to this
[43:06] i wanted to think about that for a
[43:07] minute they was willing to give up
[43:08] freedom it would seem to go back to this
[43:12] first six but now our soul is dried away
[43:15] the soul is in
[43:20] our soul is dried away there's nothing
[43:22] at all beside this manner before our
[43:25] eyes
[43:26] god gave you freedom
[43:28] he providing for you and you're throwing
[43:30] it in god's face i want you to see how
[43:32] god started to process this now right
[43:34] and the manner was a coriander seed and
[43:37] the color thereof as the color
[43:39] [Music]
[43:41] and the people went about and gathered
[43:43] it and ground it in mills or beat it in
[43:46] a mortar and baked it in pans and made
[43:49] cakes of it and the taste of it was as a
[43:52] taste of fresh oil
[43:53] and when the dew fell upon the camp in
[43:55] the night the manner fell upon it
[43:59] then moses heard the people weep
[44:02] throughout their families
[44:06] every man in the door of his tent
[44:11] and the anger of the lord was kindled
[44:13] greatly
[44:14] moses also was displeased
[44:21] so the deep question here tonight so far
[44:24] is
[44:26] do they really want to be free
[44:30] because
[44:31] there was a price of freedom
[44:33] here it is they were free but here it is
[44:36] they actually feel entitled
[44:38] to more than what god has given them at
[44:40] that point in time and look how god
[44:42] treated with it and we're going to build
[44:43] into something in a bit i'm not going to
[44:44] be too long with you
[44:47] verse 11 and moses said unto the lord
[44:50] wherefore has thou afflicted thy servant
[44:56] in other words why have you been so hard
[44:57] on your servant
[45:00] and wherefore have i not found favor in
[45:02] thy sight that thou lays the burden of
[45:05] all this people upon me
[45:07] so the complaints of the people because
[45:10] they felt entitled to more than what god
[45:12] was giving them was so great that it
[45:14] brought a level of of pain in moses own
[45:17] life
[45:19] have i conceived all these people
[45:22] so moses is now saying lord it's not my
[45:25] i didn't conceive them or no
[45:28] have i begotten them
[45:29] that those should i say unto me carry
[45:31] them in thy bosom as a nursing father
[45:34] bearing the sucking child unto the land
[45:36] which thou swear is unto their fathers
[45:40] when should i have flesh to give unto
[45:42] all his people
[45:44] so this became a major issue for the
[45:46] children of israel and for moses
[45:48] for they weep unto me saying give us
[45:51] flesh that we may eat
[45:56] now we reach a point now and this is
[45:58] interesting this is a point in moses
[45:59] life which i don't know many of you see
[46:01] where moses this led to moses almost
[46:03] getting depressed
[46:08] moses said i am not able to bear all
[46:10] these people alone
[46:12] because it is too heavy for me
[46:16] it became overwhelming for moses
[46:21] now bear in mind this is after moses
[46:23] levitating out of egypt this is this is
[46:26] in a mature stage of moses ministry
[46:30] he was able to weather pharaoh he was
[46:31] able to weather the plagues was able to
[46:33] weather the median he was able and here
[46:35] it is it reached a point because of the
[46:37] complaints of the people
[46:39] because of the emotion of the people
[46:41] because of the attitudes of the people
[46:43] he is saying listen this is now too much
[46:45] for me
[46:46] and many of us situations come to us and
[46:48] we say this is this is too much
[46:51] he said if thou deal thus with me kill
[46:54] me i pray thee
[46:56] out of hand if i have found fear in thy
[46:58] sight and let me not
[47:00] see my wretchedness
[47:04] in the amplified it says so if this is
[47:05] the way you are going to deal with me
[47:07] please kill me at once
[47:09] if i have found favor in your sight and
[47:10] do not let me see my wretchedness
[47:14] so i want to draw a parallel because we
[47:16] went through elijah's own situation
[47:20] and here we see moses coming to his own
[47:22] position where he was
[47:24] feeling like almost given up
[47:28] so i want to remind us as a people and
[47:30] as a church
[47:32] that having the emotion of feeling to
[47:34] give up is something that people go
[47:36] through
[47:37] but time and time again we're seeing
[47:39] that having the feeling of wanting to
[47:40] give up or throw your hands and say this
[47:42] is this word fighting
[47:45] is that word preston is it worth keeping
[47:47] going after all these years
[47:49] and time and time again we see god will
[47:51] provide grace and strength no matter how
[47:54] you feel in the time of your need to
[47:56] give you that in elijah case it was the
[47:59] juniper tree experience
[48:01] the place of rest in moses case we'll
[48:03] see it moses gets the help that he needs
[48:06] he gets the support system that he needs
[48:07] so he could fight
[48:10] but his situation that existed prompted
[48:12] all of this
[48:16] verse 16
[48:18] and the lord said unto moses i'm going
[48:20] somewhere because i wanted to see you
[48:22] know that and i made a point before
[48:24] friends and i wanted to catch this
[48:26] because this entitlement thing
[48:28] [Music]
[48:29] people go and do what they want to do
[48:30] because they feel they're entitled to
[48:32] happiness on their tombs
[48:36] i i i i push in there now right so they
[48:38] feel it entitled so they feel they are
[48:40] entitled to go and have the friends they
[48:42] want to have that's that's the that's
[48:44] pushing entitlement now they want to go
[48:46] and do what they want to do
[48:48] and this is the painful part
[48:51] when
[48:52] when you come back to god or you get
[48:54] restored
[48:56] i want us to understand that god
[48:58] god is just and he is
[49:00] consistent you getting back to god
[49:03] doesn't change the consequences of bad
[49:05] decisions you make her
[49:09] because god is a god of his word
[49:12] god can forgive you
[49:14] and still discipline you at the same
[49:16] time
[49:18] it's a paradox
[49:23] let me say it again god could forgive
[49:25] you
[49:27] and still discipline
[49:28] you because he's a god of his word
[49:32] and we'll get it
[49:34] and the lord said unto moses
[49:37] so i want us to understand what led to
[49:39] this
[49:40] so now we're coming into administration
[49:42] of the children of israel but what
[49:44] prompted this was a bunch of ungrateful
[49:47] people
[49:48] because they made it seem as if they
[49:50] prefer to be back in egypt
[49:52] like how many people come to church
[49:54] come to the message come to the lord and
[49:57] because things in their mind don't work
[50:00] out the way they think it should or they
[50:02] say well when i was in the world i still
[50:04] have more money when i was in the world
[50:05] i used to when i was in the world
[50:07] because this is what they are seeing
[50:08] there we remember when we was back in
[50:11] egypt this is how it was
[50:13] but now we come into this new place this
[50:16] new journey this new experience we come
[50:17] into the deeper aspect of the world
[50:21] i don't have as much friends as i used
[50:22] to have before so i find in an evening i
[50:24] do have too much things to do but when i
[50:26] was there i used to have people lining
[50:27] with me now
[50:30] you see the connection and god is saying
[50:32] when you talk like that you make me
[50:34] wonder why i bring you out of egypt
[50:37] because you need to know what you really
[50:38] want to value are you valuing and this
[50:42] this description of the fish
[50:44] and the cucumbers and the melons and the
[50:47] leeks and the onions could be anything
[50:50] anything that you use of value because
[50:53] when somebody backslides backslide means
[50:55] to go back where you were before you
[50:57] slide back
[50:59] it is something in the sliding back
[51:02] that is still connected to your heart
[51:04] that pulls you back
[51:07] so you're trying to go this new path but
[51:09] you're still looking back to when i used
[51:11] to when i used to when i used to this is
[51:14] what they were saying here and the
[51:15] complaint was
[51:17] i don't know friends i don't have this
[51:20] we do have fun i i i i
[51:22] i had more time when i was in the world
[51:25] i had more time but now now is service
[51:27] on sunday and bible study on tuesday and
[51:29] service on wednesday i'm remitting on
[51:31] friday i have no evenings
[51:36] we're dealing with with yet we're
[51:37] dealing with mindset now
[51:41] entitled
[51:47] so moses now reaching this point
[51:50] like many of us reach many leaders reach
[51:53] this level of complaining is too much
[51:56] so god is about to deal with it and look
[51:58] how he deals with the situation and i
[51:59] want you to see and we need to
[52:01] understand this because god starts to
[52:04] deal with situations by bringing
[52:05] structure
[52:06] you need structure in your life
[52:09] it sounds simple but you need structure
[52:12] you need to know when you're going to
[52:13] pray you need to know when you're going
[52:15] to read you need to have structure to
[52:17] your life and the lord said unto moses
[52:19] gather unto me 70 men of the elders of
[52:22] israel whom those knowest to be the
[52:24] elders of the people
[52:26] and officers over them and bring them
[52:29] into the tabernacle of the congregation
[52:31] that they may stand there with thee
[52:34] and i will come down and talk with thee
[52:36] there and i will take of the spirit
[52:39] which is upon thee and put it upon them
[52:43] and they shall bear the burden of the
[52:45] people with thee that doubt not thyself
[52:48] alone
[52:49] you see that that's powerful
[52:51] so that is god now seeing the burden
[52:54] upon moses seeing the amount of people
[52:56] seeing the immortal needs and saying let
[52:58] me bring some structure around moses
[53:02] so that moses would have to bear this
[53:03] burden alone
[53:05] and that is why i really want to salute
[53:07] the officers of the church
[53:09] who support the office of the pastor
[53:12] because it's impossible to carry to
[53:14] carry the burden alone
[53:15] it was so in the new testament as well
[53:18] that is why the deacons were created
[53:21] because when they looked at the
[53:22] situation they were people with needs
[53:26] and god wanted it that the ministry
[53:28] could focus on the bringing of the word
[53:30] the breaking of the bread the opening of
[53:32] mystery steady people
[53:36] that's why it's impossible for you to be
[53:37] part of a church and not want to know
[53:39] how you could help
[53:41] how you can support
[53:45] anybody with me tonight
[53:48] verse 18 and say thou unto the people
[53:51] sanctify yourself against tomorrow and
[53:54] you shall eat flesh
[53:56] for ye have wept in the ears of the lord
[53:59] saying who shall give us flesh to eat
[54:01] for it was well with us in egypt so god
[54:04] now this is serious see you're serious
[54:07] therefore the lord will give you flesh
[54:09] and you shall eat
[54:11] that i want to soak in that verse 18.
[54:18] i want to read it in the amplified say
[54:19] to the people consecrate
[54:22] separate as holy yourselves for tomorrow
[54:24] and you shall eat meat for you have wept
[54:27] in self-pity
[54:29] you see that self-pity thing
[54:31] in the ears of the lord seeing who will
[54:33] give us meat to eat for we were well off
[54:36] in egypt
[54:38] so god is repeating what they're saying
[54:44] god and discard what they're saying he
[54:45] put it in context because he's coming to
[54:47] deal with this complaint and his
[54:50] entitlement that came from being in
[54:51] egypt
[54:53] therefore the lord will give you meat
[54:55] and you shall eat
[54:57] listen now so god's saying this is what
[54:59] you want listen to verse 19 you shall
[55:01] eat
[55:02] you shall not eat one day nor two days
[55:05] no five days neither 10 days not 20 days
[55:09] so god is saying you want to eat
[55:11] it wouldn't be one day wait no it's not
[55:12] gonna be two days it's not gonna be five
[55:14] days it's not gonna be ten days not
[55:16] twenty days
[55:17] listen but even a whole month
[55:21] god is now
[55:22] answering so this is i want you to be
[55:24] careful now
[55:26] when you cry for the wrong thing
[55:29] and you're flying the face of god god
[55:31] said this is what you want okay fine
[55:35] but even a whole month until it come out
[55:39] at your nostrils
[55:42] and it belongs some unto you because
[55:45] that you have despised the lord which is
[55:48] among you
[55:50] and have wept before him saying why came
[55:52] we fought out of egypt
[55:55] friends this is serious i want to soak
[55:58] in this a little bit
[56:00] because i want to build friends i don't
[56:04] know if i'm expressing the right way but
[56:06] too many people complaining and flying
[56:09] in the face of god and they're wondering
[56:11] why things operating so and god is
[56:14] literally putting a pause on your
[56:16] activities because he's saying you are
[56:18] not acknowledging me
[56:20] you're talking about how things used to
[56:21] be and how this was and you're looking
[56:24] outside and you're not looking at what
[56:25] i'm doing for you right now
[56:30] and the fact that god is repeating this
[56:32] thing about egypt is as if god's saying
[56:34] this thing this reference of egypt just
[56:36] gets me upset
[56:41] you shall eat verse 19 not you you shall
[56:44] not eat one day not two days nor five
[56:47] days neither 10 days not 20 days but
[56:49] even a whole month in other words you
[56:51] want meat take meat i wouldn't give it
[56:53] for one day but you i'll give you a
[56:55] whole month until you're coming out your
[56:56] nose
[56:59] you will get so much meat that you will
[57:01] it will be load someone to you you'll
[57:03] get me till you hit it
[57:06] the lord because you have despised the
[57:08] lord this by means hate the lord
[57:14] i want to read the amplifier because i
[57:15] want to i want it to stick but a whole
[57:17] month until it comes out of your
[57:18] nostrils and it's disgusting to you
[57:20] because you are rejected
[57:22] and despise the lord who is among you
[57:25] and have wept in self-pity before him
[57:27] saying why did we come out of egypt
[57:32] verse 21
[57:35] and moses said the people among whom i
[57:38] am
[57:39] are six hundred thousand foot men
[57:42] and thou has said i will give them flesh
[57:44] that they may eat a whole month
[57:48] shall the flux and the herds be slain
[57:50] for them to suffice them so moses is
[57:53] saying these are how much men are with
[57:54] me shall the flocks in other words the
[57:56] animals we have be slain for them to
[57:58] suffice them or shall all the fish of
[58:00] the city gather together for them to
[58:02] surprise them so moses is saying lord is
[58:05] a lot of people we talking about here
[58:07] is it there to kill all the animals we
[58:09] have to get all the fish so moses
[58:11] himself trying to wrap his mind around
[58:13] how god going to do this
[58:17] and the lord said unto moses is the lord
[58:19] that's hands wack short
[58:24] that thou shalt see know whether my word
[58:28] shall come to pass under thee or not
[58:31] so god saying to moses after all you've
[58:33] been true you will ask me a question
[58:35] like how am i going to do it
[58:37] now i want you to understand something
[58:38] this is i want you to see a side of god
[58:40] people don't normally get to see
[58:42] this is god doing something
[58:45] and he's doing it
[58:47] i don't want to say with reluctance but
[58:49] he's doing it with very intentional
[58:52] because he's doing it because he asked
[58:53] for it but he's going to he be doing
[58:55] this with judgement titan
[58:59] he's not doing it out of blessing
[59:01] you want it take it
[59:04] because i have been providing your needs
[59:06] but you're what you want
[59:08] you're so fussing about it you're
[59:10] stressing on the man of god
[59:15] hallelujah
[59:18] you're going past what my provision is
[59:20] for you and you reached the point that
[59:22] you have the man of god frustrated
[59:24] the man of god wants to know he wants to
[59:26] give up
[59:27] he he reads a point based on your
[59:29] complaints that you say listen don't
[59:31] just kill me yes
[59:35] and not only that you keep referring to
[59:37] how you used to live
[59:39] you keep referring to how things was
[59:41] before you came into connection with my
[59:43] blessing i want to make sure the message
[59:45] gets him so you keep referring to you
[59:47] know when i was in the world
[59:49] you know
[59:50] why the people in the world and and god
[59:52] he hated he hates it
[59:58] verse 24 and moses went out and told the
[1:00:01] people the words of the lord
[1:00:03] and gathered the seventy men of the
[1:00:05] elders of the people and set them around
[1:00:08] about the tabernacle
[1:00:10] and the lord came down in a cloud and
[1:00:13] speak unto him
[1:00:15] and took of the spirit that was upon him
[1:00:18] and gave it unto the seventy elders
[1:00:23] you ever read this before so you see
[1:00:25] you see how easy it is for the brandon
[1:00:27] to say that when you look at the church
[1:00:29] that the the spirit of the pastor is
[1:00:31] many people
[1:00:35] that the anointing on a man can be on
[1:00:37] somebody else
[1:00:39] here it is god is saying clearly i took
[1:00:40] this spirit from among moses and divided
[1:00:43] upon the people
[1:00:47] and gave it unto these 70 elders and it
[1:00:49] came to pass that when the spirit rested
[1:00:51] upon them they prophesied and did not
[1:00:53] cease
[1:00:56] so suddenly it is now moses and 70 men
[1:00:59] around moses all under the spirit and
[1:01:01] testimony of prophecy and they then stop
[1:01:03] prophesying the anointing is upon them
[1:01:10] verse 26
[1:01:12] and there remained two of the men in the
[1:01:14] camp
[1:01:15] the name of the one was eldad
[1:01:18] and the name of the other meedad
[1:01:21] and the spirit rested upon them and they
[1:01:24] were of them that were written but went
[1:01:27] not out unto the tabernacle and they
[1:01:30] prophesied in the camp
[1:01:40] verse 27 and they ran a young man and
[1:01:42] told moses and said eldad and me that do
[1:01:46] prophesy in the camp
[1:01:49] and joshua the son of nun
[1:01:51] the servant of moses one of his young
[1:01:54] men answered and said my lord moses
[1:01:56] forbid them
[1:01:57] and moses said unto him envious thou
[1:02:00] from isaac
[1:02:02] what god at all the lord's people were
[1:02:04] prophets
[1:02:05] and that the lord would put his spirit
[1:02:06] upon them
[1:02:08] and moses got him into the camp he and
[1:02:11] the elders
[1:02:12] of israel
[1:02:15] verse 31
[1:02:17] and they went fought a win from the lord
[1:02:19] and brought quails from the sea
[1:02:22] and let them fall by the camp as it were
[1:02:25] a day's journey on this side and as it
[1:02:27] were a day's journey on the other side
[1:02:29] round about the camp and as it were two
[1:02:32] cubits high upon the face of the earth
[1:02:40] and the people stood up all that day and
[1:02:43] all that night and all the next day and
[1:02:46] they gathered the quills he that
[1:02:48] gathered least gathered ten homers and
[1:02:50] they spread them all abroad for
[1:02:53] themselves around the camp
[1:03:01] verse 33
[1:03:03] and while the flesh was yet between
[1:03:06] their teeth
[1:03:10] uh it was chewed
[1:03:13] the wrath of the lord was kindled
[1:03:15] against the people
[1:03:17] and the lord smote the people with a
[1:03:20] very great plague
[1:03:26] in the amplified that says while the
[1:03:28] meat was still being still between their
[1:03:30] teeth before it was chewed
[1:03:33] so in other words as they bite before
[1:03:35] they even get to chew it
[1:03:37] the anger of the lord
[1:03:42] struck them with a severe plague
[1:03:48] so this is what i this is why i call it
[1:03:49] the curse of entitlement
[1:03:54] and he called the name of that place
[1:03:56] kibra hattawa because they buried
[1:03:59] the people that lusted
[1:04:04] and the people journeyed
[1:04:07] and we'll end there without reading
[1:04:10] on that part tonight
[1:04:12] i just want to share a few more things
[1:04:14] on this thing
[1:04:19] entitlement
[1:04:23] is based on
[1:04:27] this belief that because of x
[1:04:31] you're entitled to a certain thing
[1:04:33] so you believe that because you are from
[1:04:36] a certain family
[1:04:37] you should have something
[1:04:39] because you have a certain education you
[1:04:41] should have something because you're in
[1:04:43] the message you should have something
[1:04:46] because you did this you should have x
[1:04:50] whatever it is whether it's our standard
[1:04:52] of living
[1:04:53] whether is
[1:04:54] you're supposed to be happy whether it
[1:04:56] is all entitlement
[1:04:58] and you will find as you dig in
[1:05:00] scripture
[1:05:02] you know there are a lot of people who
[1:05:03] and we talk about it your trials and and
[1:05:06] counted all joy and and we talked about
[1:05:08] that he's suffering to this present time
[1:05:10] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:05:12] glory that should be revealing us
[1:05:14] and you'll find other christians
[1:05:16] complain about the childs and intestines
[1:05:19] and as much as we preach about it listen
[1:05:22] i just have some hard days you know oh
[1:05:24] you're you didn't think so
[1:05:27] with that
[1:05:28] you think eyes have just happy happy
[1:05:30] days
[1:05:35] we all have rough days
[1:05:39] it takes great strength to smile we need
[1:05:41] to be horrible you know
[1:05:45] and i was looking at the scripture as
[1:05:47] look at paul in in in philippians 4 11.
[1:05:50] you don't have to find it i'll just
[1:05:51] share
[1:05:52] i told you tonight i'm not going to be
[1:05:54] too long i just wanted to just add some
[1:05:55] things to what robert said on sunday
[1:06:00] paul said in the philippians not that i
[1:06:02] speak in respect of want
[1:06:06] so paul is saying
[1:06:07] i'm not speaking
[1:06:09] in
[1:06:10] the position of having
[1:06:13] for i have learned
[1:06:16] learned in whatever state i am
[1:06:20] there with to be content
[1:06:23] i find this is powerful
[1:06:25] so this is not something that paul was
[1:06:28] born with
[1:06:30] paul was saying that he learned
[1:06:32] and this is this is him this is this is
[1:06:34] a scripture that helps us with this
[1:06:36] entitlement thing
[1:06:37] so so look at the look at paul's example
[1:06:40] in verse 12 i know both how to be a
[1:06:43] beast
[1:06:46] do you know how to be a beast
[1:06:48] do you know how to live low
[1:06:51] do you know how to live with
[1:06:53] with bread and bread
[1:06:57] i see i even say bread and butter you
[1:06:58] know i say bread and bread
[1:07:01] do you know what it is to be a beast
[1:07:04] so paul is saying
[1:07:05] my life situations
[1:07:08] by what i've gone through i've not
[1:07:10] realized and we'll see when the
[1:07:11] scripture ends up that it's a journey
[1:07:14] god carries us through
[1:07:16] so listen to paul i want to say he said
[1:07:18] i know both how to be your base and how
[1:07:20] to abound
[1:07:23] everywhere
[1:07:25] and in all things
[1:07:28] i am instructed both to be full and to
[1:07:31] be hungry
[1:07:33] both abound and to suffer need
[1:07:37] so this is paul
[1:07:39] this is this is this is this is to me
[1:07:42] this is so exciting
[1:07:43] because paul has been i've learned
[1:07:46] it didn't come naturally it's not
[1:07:47] something i was born with i learned to
[1:07:49] deal with the mountain top
[1:07:51] and i've learned to deal with the
[1:07:52] valleys
[1:07:54] i've learned to live when my account
[1:07:56] have money i want to have no money
[1:08:00] and this is the context of the scripture
[1:08:02] because one of the greatest challenges
[1:08:04] we have with scripture is people like to
[1:08:06] take a scripture and use it like a word
[1:08:08] jackal weapon
[1:08:09] without the context
[1:08:11] this is the lead up into the verse i can
[1:08:15] do all things
[1:08:17] through christ which strengthens me
[1:08:20] this scripture i can do all things it's
[1:08:21] not a license to say i could build a
[1:08:23] plane
[1:08:25] the context of this scripture is taken
[1:08:28] from the narrative of paul explaining i
[1:08:31] can do all things as in live on the
[1:08:33] mountain and live in the valley because
[1:08:36] it is god who strengthens me to be able
[1:08:38] to behave when i'm on the mountain and
[1:08:40] live when i'm in the valley i can do all
[1:08:42] things be in a position of being abased
[1:08:46] or abandoned you know how many
[1:08:47] christians can't live in a bound
[1:08:50] oh come on let's push now you know what
[1:08:52] christians cannot live in a spirit in a
[1:08:54] space of success and that is why god
[1:08:56] will keep you in a certain place because
[1:08:58] the moment it's had to rise you start to
[1:09:00] lose your connection to the god who
[1:09:02] helping you to rise
[1:09:06] have to learn how to live there you know
[1:09:08] it is not something that happens
[1:09:10] automatically
[1:09:11] and if you haven't gone through the
[1:09:13] lesson
[1:09:14] let's bring it more personal if you
[1:09:16] haven't gone to the lesson of learning
[1:09:17] how to live a beast god will make sure
[1:09:19] you pass that exam too
[1:09:22] because paul's testimony is an example
[1:09:25] to us paul could have because paul was
[1:09:28] called from high society
[1:09:30] paul was a learned man
[1:09:32] a student of gamaliel
[1:09:34] he was exposed to the finer things and
[1:09:36] he learned how to live any finer things
[1:09:39] he learned how to he said i can become
[1:09:40] all all all things to all men
[1:09:44] so yes you may come to church all sad
[1:09:46] because well this month my pain didn't
[1:09:48] really work out that good on you you
[1:09:50] know things you know things rough poor
[1:09:52] came to the point that they couldn't
[1:09:52] tell when things was rough
[1:09:55] because he could do all things through
[1:09:56] christ
[1:09:58] come on now
[1:09:59] who strengthens me paul didn't feel
[1:10:01] untitled and but albert preached it
[1:10:03] because i'm an apostle god should not
[1:10:05] take me through summer basin
[1:10:07] that may not be right with the same but
[1:10:09] i want to drive the point home paul
[1:10:11] wasn't saying well you know i'm a man of
[1:10:13] god so why are going through this
[1:10:15] that is the challenge of the entitlement
[1:10:18] so i want us to take the lesson from
[1:10:20] paul tonight
[1:10:22] you know how many people say but why
[1:10:24] would whenever you ask the question why
[1:10:26] it is entitlement to your deliverance
[1:10:28] that's the issue you're dealing with
[1:10:31] the moment you ask why this didn't work
[1:10:33] out it's because you felt entitled it
[1:10:36] shouldn't work in a certain way
[1:10:38] and paul is saying i learnt it
[1:10:41] and i want to drive home the learning
[1:10:43] the spiritual learning of our behaviors
[1:10:46] anybody with me tonight
[1:10:48] i just want to share a few more things
[1:10:50] and we'll have an early night tonight
[1:11:00] somebody said for many people
[1:11:02] whatever makes them happy
[1:11:04] is what they believe
[1:11:06] they should be allowed to do
[1:11:09] i'll say it one more time
[1:11:10] for many people
[1:11:12] whatever makes them happy is what they
[1:11:15] believe they should be allowed to do
[1:11:20] and this could be any kind of thing
[1:11:23] they like to gossip they feel that they
[1:11:25] should gossip guys bring them is mean i
[1:11:27] feel happy
[1:11:28] they want organ i don't want to go on
[1:11:30] any list of things because you know what
[1:11:31] he listens
[1:11:34] but the christian life and this is why
[1:11:37] the entitlement is the problem because
[1:11:40] the christian life is a life of denial
[1:11:45] denying yourself so now we're driving
[1:11:47] home why this entitlement thing is a
[1:11:50] problem because the entitlement thing no
[1:11:52] means you feel you should have and god
[1:11:54] is saying your sudden you need to deny
[1:11:55] yourself
[1:11:59] so so when last have you denied yourself
[1:12:04] this is this is deep denying yourself is
[1:12:07] is so huge because you want to answer
[1:12:10] back your wife but you deny yourself
[1:12:12] the pleasure of answering back
[1:12:16] you want to say something to the boss
[1:12:18] but you deny yourself the pleasure
[1:12:20] that's how simple it is
[1:12:21] i'm a practical christian
[1:12:24] i'm not trying to connect this to no
[1:12:25] deep mystery denying yourself means it's
[1:12:28] something that you want to do you like
[1:12:30] to do you enjoy doing but you put up
[1:12:32] breaks on it
[1:12:34] and you go against what you want to do
[1:12:36] because you can feel people tell you i'm
[1:12:38] entitled to my opinion are you are you
[1:12:40] really entitled to your own opinion as a
[1:12:42] child of god
[1:12:44] are you really entitled to your say
[1:12:47] people come to church and come and talk
[1:12:49] about how they think it should be and
[1:12:50] everybody has a voice is that the case
[1:12:52] is that in the word
[1:12:55] this is not trying to bring people into
[1:12:57] a state of silence but it's
[1:12:59] understanding the context
[1:13:02] of what you really are entitled to
[1:13:06] and i will close off the meeting with
[1:13:08] what you're supposed to be entitled to
[1:13:14] can we go a little further
[1:13:18] our lives should be focused not on what
[1:13:21] makes us happy now this goes against a
[1:13:24] lot of conventional thinking i'm not
[1:13:26] saying you're not supposed to be happy
[1:13:28] but this entitlement that you now
[1:13:31] seeking your happiness against the will
[1:13:34] of god is the issue because these
[1:13:35] children of israel didn't see it as sin
[1:13:39] this is what god got god upset because a
[1:13:41] lot of us didn't see complaining of sin
[1:13:43] before i presented it this way
[1:13:46] you didn't see how god sees complaining
[1:13:49] because whenever you complain it is you
[1:13:51] throwing back whatever blessing god put
[1:13:54] for you and a provision well well
[1:13:56] accompanied because i already wanted to
[1:13:57] make 15 000 and i only make twelve
[1:13:59] thousand i'm gonna sin but but is i will
[1:14:01] give it e twelve so you're my my my
[1:14:03] twelve egg good
[1:14:06] well fine i'll take it all back
[1:14:09] i'll take it all
[1:14:10] because you there i i put things in
[1:14:12] place to give you 12 because 12 is what
[1:14:14] you need and you they're complaining you
[1:14:15] don't get 15. whatever fine well here's
[1:14:17] what i take them back my 12.
[1:14:21] or like you did with them
[1:14:23] you're one or 15 i'll give 15 till you
[1:14:25] tie yourself up and you lose yourself
[1:14:27] that's it you want meat i give you a
[1:14:29] meat tell you you're sick
[1:14:33] because it's it is really a level of it
[1:14:35] end up being a level of ungratefulness
[1:14:37] all right let me try to bring a point to
[1:14:39] close out here now
[1:14:43] so
[1:14:48] we so i want to make the point then that
[1:14:49] that that there a lot of people say well
[1:14:51] well since i'm a christian i have a
[1:14:53] rougher life
[1:14:55] a tougher life
[1:14:57] and but ibraham would say like this it's
[1:14:59] not a better roses it's not that is not
[1:15:01] what this christianity is
[1:15:03] but people come into christianity and i
[1:15:05] think part of the challenge
[1:15:07] maybe how it is sold
[1:15:09] meaning how people present this journey
[1:15:13] because this is this is that this is a
[1:15:14] spiritual walk it's a walk with
[1:15:16] mountains and valleys and character
[1:15:18] development
[1:15:19] yes there's joy and enjoy the lord of
[1:15:21] your strengths
[1:15:22] but
[1:15:23] you cannot will joy when god was a
[1:15:25] ticket to an experience to break
[1:15:27] something out of you and now you
[1:15:29] throwing up your hands saying well well
[1:15:30] i told this christian work is joy and
[1:15:32] god has taken you through something
[1:15:35] to teach you how to be your best
[1:15:38] and teach you how to abound
[1:15:40] i don't know if this is helping anybody
[1:15:41] tonight
[1:15:47] we are not entitled
[1:15:50] to a certain standard of living
[1:15:55] i want to establish that
[1:15:58] yes god wants you to be happy yes god
[1:16:00] wants you to be successful yes you want
[1:16:02] to be blessed but you are not entitled
[1:16:05] to that
[1:16:10] because god could decide what stage and
[1:16:12] what house you live in against whatever
[1:16:14] plans you have and you have to learn
[1:16:16] like paul to say i have learned
[1:16:19] to deal with this because this is what
[1:16:21] god wants so i want us to see now
[1:16:24] your ambitions and your plans have to be
[1:16:26] in alignment with god's will
[1:16:28] that is when the disconnect takes place
[1:16:31] it is futile for you to have ambition
[1:16:33] outside of the will of god
[1:16:37] now if you're ambition and that's why in
[1:16:39] all your ways acknowledge him and he
[1:16:41] will direct your path you'll try to see
[1:16:42] how the dots connect
[1:16:44] because when you acknowledge him and you
[1:16:46] seek his guidance and say lord i only
[1:16:48] want what you want that is why solomon
[1:16:50] could have been so blessed
[1:16:52] because he was seeking the wisdom of god
[1:16:54] he was seeking the mind of god to know
[1:16:56] how to live how to move how to act and
[1:16:58] god said that is what i want that what
[1:17:00] really that's what i really want i want
[1:17:02] a heart that's after my own heart a mind
[1:17:04] after my and i can bless you with
[1:17:06] anything because that is the principle
[1:17:08] thing
[1:17:10] not i'm a christian i'm in a message i'm
[1:17:12] entitled to the rapture so i go into the
[1:17:13] rapture ho ho ho ho how are you doing it
[1:17:16] what are you working towards
[1:17:18] i want to challenge us
[1:17:22] to bring ourselves into a discipline of
[1:17:25] the word
[1:17:27] you are not entitled to your idea of the
[1:17:29] word you're not entitled to your
[1:17:31] interpretation of the word
[1:17:35] well i feel this is what it really mean
[1:17:37] and i i don't like how that is said
[1:17:39] because that that that comes against
[1:17:41] what what somebody tell me people bring
[1:17:43] their entitlement of how they see the
[1:17:45] word you know
[1:17:48] and you will see through many of the
[1:17:49] bible studies that we have done
[1:17:51] certain things that some people may have
[1:17:52] thought was a certain way when they see
[1:17:54] a truly word and say wait a minute this
[1:17:56] is really what the scriptures say
[1:17:57] and why it is said in that way
[1:17:59] anybody would meet tonight i'm
[1:18:01] almost done
[1:18:06] we are not entitled to the possession of
[1:18:08] others
[1:18:10] our shame with my dad i said that is why
[1:18:14] horses run with blinders on
[1:18:19] because when a horse
[1:18:21] do have the blinders and he takes a look
[1:18:22] at the other horses it's madness going
[1:18:25] on
[1:18:26] so they put blinders so there's
[1:18:28] singleness of focus
[1:18:30] to the finish line
[1:18:32] and i challenge you church and by the
[1:18:34] woman was saying it on sunday as well
[1:18:36] people can rejoice with somebody else
[1:18:38] because they wish what that person had
[1:18:39] was their own
[1:18:41] so it's a kind of
[1:18:42] half rejoice
[1:18:44] we're happy let's go we're happy for you
[1:18:47] how do we get that boy
[1:18:50] is that a genuine it's not a truthful
[1:18:52] rejoicing you know is that is that kind
[1:18:54] of is that i was happy and always i just
[1:18:57] would i be happier i would have been
[1:18:59] happy for you but i would be happier if
[1:19:01] i had it too
[1:19:05] so it's like degrees of happiness so i
[1:19:07] happy but i would be happier if we
[1:19:10] brought gadika
[1:19:11] then we'll be total happiness we vote
[1:19:14] would be really happy for each other
[1:19:16] and god is saying i am keeping you right
[1:19:18] where you at because i'm dealing with
[1:19:20] you differently
[1:19:23] so i want to challenge you that the word
[1:19:25] is the mirror
[1:19:26] that you want to be comparing to
[1:19:29] not anybody else
[1:19:34] anybody with me tonight i'm almost done
[1:19:39] you are not entitled to having your any
[1:19:43] friend you want
[1:19:44] a commentary young people now you're not
[1:19:46] entitled to choose
[1:19:49] who your friends are
[1:19:51] oh you thought it's your choice
[1:19:56] you're not entitled to marry who you
[1:19:57] want to marry here
[1:19:59] uh-huh you told us your choice
[1:20:04] a lot of these things that people think
[1:20:06] they're entitled to they're not entitled
[1:20:08] to and they don't realize it because
[1:20:10] when you live by the world you'll
[1:20:11] realize whitney i don't really have a
[1:20:13] choice about this
[1:20:16] do not be unequally yoked that is
[1:20:18] that deals with that situation you know
[1:20:22] you know what the brandon said under no
[1:20:24] circumstance
[1:20:26] unbeliever
[1:20:29] aha
[1:20:30] so what is your entitlement
[1:20:33] by the time we finish go down these
[1:20:35] roads friends it'll make you realize the
[1:20:37] moves that i thought i could make
[1:20:39] already can't make them
[1:20:41] anybody with me tonight
[1:20:44] i don't know if this
[1:20:45] a little too much heat
[1:20:47] we are not entitled to our own
[1:20:49] interpretation of the truth
[1:20:52] you cannot this is not a buffet
[1:20:55] you cannot choose what you want out of
[1:20:57] the word and say well i believe i live
[1:21:00] in most this is the challenge when you
[1:21:02] meet somebody who doesn't have the
[1:21:03] revelation of the full word
[1:21:05] i couldn't have i don't know
[1:21:07] as a christian and as sing my gospel you
[1:21:09] see i i born again and and
[1:21:12] anybody ever meet somebody like that
[1:21:15] i i can't see why our little songs a
[1:21:18] little songs i sing could king and and i
[1:21:21] born again i went to church
[1:21:23] two years ago and every year let's go
[1:21:25] and rededicate hunting
[1:21:28] anybody ever meet anybody ever meet that
[1:21:31] and as far as that behavior is gonna is
[1:21:33] an entitlement that goes with it no
[1:21:39] i was in a conversation a week ago i'm
[1:21:42] getting ready to close where somebody
[1:21:45] in the pentacles that should say they
[1:21:47] find some preachers that make the
[1:21:49] requirements so high like you can't
[1:21:50] really go to heaven unless you do
[1:21:52] certain things
[1:21:53] i was like really
[1:21:58] that's like
[1:22:00] you know you have to like change all
[1:22:01] your behaviors and change all your ways
[1:22:04] and you have to stop doing certain
[1:22:05] things so how you expect to go to heaven
[1:22:08] if it'll change you'll be either because
[1:22:10] that behavior can't make it in heaven so
[1:22:12] i try to understand and you say and
[1:22:14] these preachers i want to be preaching
[1:22:16] as if as if all these behaviors like a
[1:22:19] little drinking can't be too bad a
[1:22:21] little you think
[1:22:23] i saying
[1:22:24] look hard
[1:22:26] and then but beyond that are coming now
[1:22:28] back to back to back to home back to
[1:22:31] home
[1:22:32] to these simple things
[1:22:34] because i was sharing over some time ago
[1:22:37] you know we would have gone through the
[1:22:38] story of nebot with ahab
[1:22:41] and
[1:22:42] how ahab looked at neighborhood property
[1:22:44] the vineyard and he gave him the offer
[1:22:46] he said i'll give him a better vineyard
[1:22:48] or if you don't want another vineyard
[1:22:49] i'll give him money to pay it
[1:22:51] and and and
[1:22:53] his anger i don't know if you remember
[1:22:55] the story aha went home turn his face to
[1:22:57] the wall and then eat no food
[1:22:59] it wasn't his property and he gets so
[1:23:02] depressed he felt he was entitled to it
[1:23:05] he felt because of his position he was
[1:23:08] entitled and he felt that
[1:23:09] neighborhood should have taken his offer
[1:23:12] so he was upset that neighbor didn't
[1:23:14] take the offer
[1:23:16] look that that's a case of entitlement
[1:23:18] because if you don't feel entitled you
[1:23:19] should have no emotion tied to it
[1:23:22] but then you see entitlement is tied to
[1:23:24] comparison because he was looking at
[1:23:26] nearby probably say without that but i
[1:23:27] cannot get better than mine so i wanted
[1:23:29] it was also tied to coveton because he
[1:23:31] was coveting which means he wanted
[1:23:33] something
[1:23:34] he was coveting his neighbor's property
[1:23:38] and there are scriptures in the new
[1:23:39] testament that play that place is
[1:23:41] coveted in the same category as adultery
[1:23:46] so somebody say well i recommend
[1:23:48] adultery i don't smoke on a drink but
[1:23:50] you did covet in your brother car
[1:23:52] you just you cannot fight you're gonna
[1:23:54] fight you're gonna fight you're gonna
[1:23:55] fight you're gonna fight you're gonna
[1:23:57] fight
[1:23:58] every time you see him driving you just
[1:24:00] you can't deal it
[1:24:03] you have to know your situation but then
[1:24:05] when god looks at it the same way you
[1:24:07] look at complaining you can say but i
[1:24:08] don't drink i don't smoke in church but
[1:24:10] there you're they're complaining you're
[1:24:11] complaining you're complaining you're
[1:24:13] finding you're like you wake up every
[1:24:14] day and you're finding somebody coming
[1:24:16] what can i complain about today boy
[1:24:18] the roof all right let me complain about
[1:24:19] your roof your city roof you see the
[1:24:21] roof you see the roof when you finish
[1:24:22] that day above the roof is your city
[1:24:24] gate you see the gate you see the gate
[1:24:28] and god is saying that attitude
[1:24:31] if something needs to be fixed fix it
[1:24:33] but don't complain about it
[1:24:35] if somebody could change change it but
[1:24:37] complain and don't change anything
[1:24:40] and i want us to understand that this is
[1:24:43] something it's a certain behaviors
[1:24:45] people do already preach about these
[1:24:47] things and that's why i say this is
[1:24:48] bible study but i want us to understand
[1:24:50] when you look at it and see how god
[1:24:51] treated this
[1:24:52] most people never knew god judged them
[1:24:53] just for complaining
[1:24:57] people come to church they got see they
[1:24:58] don't like
[1:24:59] two weeks later they still complain
[1:25:01] about that
[1:25:05] somebody get a bad drive the whole rest
[1:25:07] of your drive it was it was about drive
[1:25:12] is that every story it's stuck in luke
[1:25:14] you're just repeating it you see that
[1:25:15] drive i fell out of me crazy and you
[1:25:17] were
[1:25:19] what manner of lies what manner of
[1:25:21] behavior ought to be
[1:25:23] so i want to challenge us friends this
[1:25:25] spirit of entitlement and i i pray that
[1:25:28] in some way it has been an encouragement
[1:25:30] to you
[1:25:32] the entitlement spirit or mentality is a
[1:25:35] threat to the contentment that paul
[1:25:38] speaks about
[1:25:39] that comes with a relationship from god
[1:25:41] and trust in god to take care of you and
[1:25:44] your need at a particular point in time
[1:25:48] you have to have trust in god
[1:25:52] yes there is actions you have to take
[1:25:53] but take it with prayer don't take it
[1:25:55] all rash and you decide i want to do
[1:25:58] but take it with prayer
[1:25:59] and make sure at the end of the day
[1:26:02] you recognize that it's the grace of god
[1:26:04] to you is the grace of god to me it's

[1:26:44] and in it was judgment that is such a
[1:26:46] paradox to try the law to understand
[1:26:48] your thinking on the matter but to see
[1:26:50] how
[1:26:51] how you are so disturbed when you have
