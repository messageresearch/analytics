[14:08] a few minutes this morning
[14:11] amen so on behalf of our pastor brother
[14:14] oban and his wife sister ann marie i'd
[14:16] like to welcome you this morning and
[14:19] to the house of the lord this morning
[14:23] i'd also like to greet you on behalf of
[14:24] my wife and it's truly an honor to stand
[14:26] before the purchase
[14:28] of the blood of jesus christ i do want
[14:30] to send special greetings to those who
[14:32] are connected live
[14:33] on the internet and wherever this tape
[14:35] may be played
[14:36] amen so before we get started this
[14:39] morning i want to salute by the anthony
[14:40] for the message last week
[14:42] who is this uncircumcised philistine
[14:44] your pre-shipping anthony
[14:47] amen and i want to really salute brother
[14:50] kangale by the george kangli for his
[14:52] words before the prayer meeting on
[14:53] thursday night
[14:54] if you missed it you missed one of the
[14:56] greatest prayer meetings i've ever been
[14:58] in in my life there was such a super
[15:00] anointing and brother branham said one
[15:02] day the right words would be spoken
[15:04] my brother george was speaking the right
[15:06] words on thursday night
[15:07] because the holy spirit just swept right
[15:09] into the building and took complete
[15:10] control so god bless you by the kangaroo
[15:13] and may god continue to inspire you
[15:15] use you and raise you up for the kingdom
[15:17] of god
[15:19] amen and we had a special time in the
[15:21] youth service last night but anthony
[15:23] took care of the youth service and it
[15:24] was really a tremendous blessing
[15:26] so this morning our pastor brother ovid
[15:28] is speaking in pennsylvania
[15:30] to a small group of believers who have
[15:32] been connected to us on the internet
[15:34] from new york
[15:35] indiana and pennsylvania he also spoke
[15:37] last night
[15:38] and a few of our believers went with him
[15:40] so we want to remember them all in
[15:41] prayer they're
[15:42] in service right now and for traveling
[15:43] mercies to their various homes and
[15:46] brotherhood will be back this weekend he
[15:48] said he's going to be preaching next
[15:49] sunday so
[15:50] be on the expectation and remember him
[15:53] in prayer that god would strengthen him
[15:55] and last weekend he was in punjab india
[15:58] and he gave me a brief report
[16:00] to give to the church and initially they
[16:03] had expected about
[16:04] 500 people and about 10 or so
[16:08] ministers to be there but it ended up
[16:09] being about 800 plus people
[16:11] and about 25 ministers came and uh
[16:14] initially some other brothers were
[16:15] supposed to go as well but that didn't
[16:17] work out so it was six
[16:19] services one of the brothers over there
[16:20] he opened up and brother will preach the
[16:22] next five messages
[16:24] so certainly we want to continue to
[16:28] remember him and pray and
[16:30] his five messages were the prophetic
[16:32] vision
[16:33] then he spoke on the word bride then he
[16:36] spoke on the lamb's book
[16:37] then he spoke on the inheritance divided
[16:40] and then he spoke on the final voice
[16:42] and india exploded india is rejoicing
[16:46] india is in revival india is under great
[16:49] expectation
[16:50] india will never be the same again can
[16:53] the church say man
[16:56] amen so when we receive the dvds we will
[16:59] certainly make them available on our
[17:01] website
[17:01] and on our youtube channel and ones are
[17:04] available we're going to notify you
[17:06] via our facebook page so we are in
[17:08] revival this morning
[17:10] amen so i really want to thank beloved
[17:12] for the privilege and opportunity to
[17:14] speak
[17:14] this morning it is by no means an easy
[17:17] task and it is a
[17:18] i can i counted a sacred responsibility
[17:21] especially in such a time
[17:22] as this so before i get to the world

[21:13] of scripture
[21:15] we're going to go to the book of
[21:17] deuteronomy
[21:18] we're going to read from first
[21:19] corinthians and we're going to read from
[21:21] 2nd
[21:21] corinthians this morning and deuteronomy
[21:24] 29
[21:26] and we're going to read verse 29 this
[21:28] morning
[21:35] deuteronomy 29 29 and the bible says the
[21:38] secret things
[21:39] belong to the lord our god but those
[21:42] things which are revealed
[21:44] belong unto us and to our children
[21:46] forever
[21:47] that we may do all the words of this law
[21:51] and reading from first corinthians 15
[21:56] first corinthians 15 51
[22:05] behold i show you a mystery we shall not
[22:08] all
[22:08] sleep but we shall all be changed in a
[22:11] moment
[22:12] in the twinkling of an eye at the last
[22:14] trump for the trumpet shall sound
[22:16] and the dead shall be raised
[22:18] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[22:22] and reading from second corinthians 13
[22:25] reading verse 5.
[22:32] second corinthians 13 and reading verse
[22:34] 5.
[22:35] listen carefully examine yourselves
[22:39] whether ye be in the faith prove
[22:42] your own selves knowing not
[22:46] your own selves how that jesus christ is
[22:48] in you
[22:49] except ye be reprobates
[22:52] i don't want to read this same scripture
[22:54] but i want to read it in the amplified
[22:57] just to expand on it a bit and in the
[22:59] amplified it says
[23:00] examine and test and evaluate your own
[23:04] selves
[23:05] to see whether you are holding to your
[23:07] feet and
[23:08] showing the proper fruits of it
[23:11] test and prove yourselves not christ
[23:15] do you not yourselves realize and know
[23:19] thoroughly by and ever increasing
[23:22] experience that jesus christ is in you
[23:26] unless you are counterfeits disapproved
[23:29] on trial and rejected may the lord have
[23:32] a blessing to the reading of his word
[23:33] shall we pray this morning
[23:35] our gracious heavenly father we thank
[23:37] you for lord the presence of the holy
[23:39] spirit that's already here lord and any
[23:40] man can read the scriptures
[23:42] but it takes the holy spirit to bring it
[23:44] alive father may you
[23:46] take me completely out of the way this
[23:48] morning and speak to the purchase
[23:50] of the blood of jesus christ i'm
[23:51] unworthy to stand behind this desk lord
[23:54] father they are your people this morning
[23:56] lord may you speak
[23:57] lip to ear to them father and bring
[23:59] great transformation
[24:01] in the house of god father bless the
[24:03] reading of the word and
[24:04] bless the hearing of it in the precious
[24:06] theme of jesus christ
[24:07] you may be seated in the presence of the
[24:10] lord this morning
[24:11] amen amen can the church say amen
[24:16] so whether branham said it's the
[24:18] atmosphere that brings the results
[24:20] so it's up to you to be in that
[24:22] atmosphere
[24:24] the minister is not supposed to bring
[24:25] the atmosphere because that atmosphere
[24:27] is that revival atmosphere
[24:29] you are supposed to bring that
[24:31] atmosphere kind of church say man
[24:33] because when you want to shape iron you
[24:34] got to put some heat on it
[24:36] because when the heat there then you
[24:38] could take the hammer and hit the iron
[24:40] but if there's no heat that iron can't
[24:42] move no way
[24:44] so we want to put some fire in the
[24:45] service this morning so the iron could
[24:47] be moved and shaped this morning
[24:50] so you love the lord this morning so i
[24:52] have a title this morning
[24:54] rapturing condition rapturing condition
[24:58] my subject
[25:00] reality check are you ready
[25:04] and an inspiration let every man
[25:08] examine himself so it's a message
[25:11] friends to shake the church it's a
[25:14] message to prod the church
[25:16] it's a message to provoke the church
[25:19] and i'm going to build a bit of a
[25:21] background on
[25:22] on december the 24th 1965
[25:26] but the brandon went on to be with the
[25:28] lord
[25:30] unknown unrecognized and unacknowledged
[25:33] by the world at large outside the
[25:37] ministry of christ the greatest prophet
[25:40] that the world had ever seen had
[25:42] silently slipped away
[25:45] names such as abraham moses noah david
[25:49] daniel and elijah had long been
[25:52] established
[25:53] as necessary actors in god's drama
[25:57] but this time was different this name
[26:00] was not to be written on buildings
[26:02] universities and schools of theology
[26:06] the ministry of this great prophet
[26:08] malachi 4
[26:10] this great elijah was different amen
[26:13] as god unfolded the story of his life
[26:16] through three polls there was a great
[26:19] purpose for this prophet
[26:22] because this prophet was to deliver a
[26:24] seven seal
[26:25] seven thunder message to prepare and
[26:28] elect
[26:29] omega world bride for the rapture
[26:32] for the wedding supper and for the
[26:34] millennium
[26:36] god has always had an order
[26:40] god will never break his order and the
[26:43] word of the lord has always come to the
[26:45] prophets
[26:46] somebody say amen amos 3 7 says surely
[26:51] the lord god will do nothing
[26:53] but he revealed his secret unto his
[26:55] servants or prophets
[26:58] church kings were made subject to the
[27:00] prophets
[27:01] the high priest was made subject to the
[27:04] prophet
[27:05] the levites were made subject to the
[27:07] prophet
[27:08] those who went to war were made subject
[27:11] to the prophet
[27:14] can the church say man this morning is
[27:17] going to be a little different
[27:18] this morning is going to be a little
[27:20] different
[27:22] in second kings 6 the king of syria the
[27:25] bible says war
[27:26] against israel and he took counsel the
[27:29] bible says and said in such and such a
[27:31] place
[27:31] i'm going to attack the israelites but
[27:34] for some reason
[27:35] where we try to attack elisha the
[27:38] prophet
[27:39] told the king of israel don't go down
[27:40] there because they are waiting for you
[27:43] over there
[27:44] when there's a prophet in the land it's
[27:46] a different situation
[27:51] can the church say man
[27:54] you maybe see that the word of the
[27:56] prophet would stand
[27:57] until the next prophet came along
[28:00] so i ask you a question this morning
[28:02] headstone tabernacle
[28:04] is this age to be any different because
[28:07] according to my bible there is no other
[28:09] major prophet to come
[28:12] there will be no other ministry like the
[28:14] ministry of brother branham
[28:16] there will be no other ministry like
[28:18] that great prophet
[28:19] that great elijah somebody's saying man
[28:26] we're back to school this morning
[28:28] because you got to know your history
[28:30] you got to know who you are you got to
[28:32] know who god is you got to know who the
[28:33] devil is
[28:36] when brother branham spoke it was not a
[28:39] man speaking
[28:41] when brother branham spoke it was the
[28:44] son of man
[28:45] veiled in a son of man
[28:48] can the church say amen oh this is the
[28:50] background i'm going to preach in a
[28:52] little while don't worry
[28:54] in the message laodicean church age no
[28:56] wonder brother branham said
[28:58] yes listen to the authenticated prophet
[29:00] of god
[29:01] who appears in this last age what he
[29:04] sells from god
[29:06] the bride will say the spirit
[29:09] and the prophet and the bride will be
[29:11] saying the same thing
[29:13] and what they say will have already been
[29:16] said in the world
[29:18] can the church say man so this morning
[29:21] we are back to the bible because what is
[29:25] said and why
[29:26] i'm against organized religion he said
[29:28] the holy spirit today
[29:29] the manifestation of the holy spirit is
[29:32] that angel
[29:34] trying to get the people back to the
[29:36] word
[29:37] and back to the word means back to the
[29:39] bible
[29:40] can the church say amen because the
[29:43] bible has always been a sealed
[29:45] book without the message of yahweh the
[29:48] bible is close to you
[29:51] can the church say amen the bible is
[29:53] close to the pentecostals
[29:55] the bible is close to the baptist the
[29:57] bible is closed to the methodist
[29:59] the bible is closed the td checks the
[30:02] bible is closed the very end
[30:03] the bible is close to them
[30:08] the bible is close to those in the
[30:11] message
[30:12] who don't dig deep enough in the
[30:15] prophet's message
[30:16] to pull up the hidden mysteries already
[30:19] revealed by malachi 4.
[30:22] somebody say amen this morning
[30:26] we're in the word this morning amen
[30:29] i always say we're going to have a real
[30:30] church or no church at all
[30:32] but the church must be based on the word
[30:37] somebody's saying man malachi 4 revealed
[30:40] many things
[30:42] he saw the siege that spoke of los
[30:44] angeles sinking
[30:45] isn't that right he spoke all the seeds
[30:48] of things that were to unfold
[30:50] he sold seed to tie up all the loose
[30:53] ends
[30:53] reveal every mystery but there was some
[30:56] special seeds
[30:57] that he sold for the pride body
[31:01] los angeles that's not my seed because i
[31:04] don't want to be here
[31:05] the tribulation that's not my seed i
[31:07] don't want to go to the tribulation but
[31:09] there's some bright seeds
[31:11] that belong to me and those things which
[31:14] are revealed
[31:15] they belong to us and they belong to our
[31:18] children
[31:18] and you can't take it from me i have a
[31:21] revelation this morning
[31:22] and you have a revelation also
[31:26] somebody say man glory to god
[31:32] you may be seated that's why brother
[31:34] branham said in the message spoken word
[31:36] original seed
[31:37] you see now why i've been so zealous of
[31:40] the kind of seed that i planted for the
[31:42] body
[31:44] he's speaking specific to the body
[31:46] because the rain is going to fall pretty
[31:48] soon
[31:49] i mean the real rain
[31:52] can a church say a man and it's got to
[31:55] have sea to fall on
[31:56] he said i hope i live to see it
[32:00] can the church see man so this morning
[32:04] i'm speaking about seeds for the bride
[32:06] body
[32:07] you could have been in any kind of
[32:08] church this morning you could have been
[32:10] in any message
[32:11] this morning but this morning we are
[32:13] speaking about seeds for the bride body
[32:15] it's good to know about the tribulation
[32:17] and the plagues and the wolves and
[32:19] serpent seed
[32:20] it's good and all of that but i have no
[32:22] plans to be in the tribulation
[32:24] can the church say amen i want to be in
[32:27] a rapturing condition
[32:29] there's coming a rapture there's coming
[32:31] a secret movement of the church
[32:33] and the church say man and you better be
[32:37] ready
[32:38] let every man examine himself this
[32:41] morning
[32:44] this morning i won the seeds i want the
[32:47] promises
[32:47] i want the word that the bride must
[32:49] produce
[32:51] i'm not going to be long with you this
[32:52] morning but i want you to
[32:54] shake this morning to get into action
[32:58] hallelujah and this morning
[33:02] those things which are revealed they
[33:03] belong unto us you have got to know it
[33:06] belongs to you
[33:07] you got to know you're not just coming
[33:08] to church you've got to know you're not
[33:10] just in the message
[33:11] you've got to know you're not just
[33:12] trying to be a christian you got to know
[33:14] that you are born
[33:15] to produce something you are born to
[33:18] produce the same life
[33:19] the same signs the same wonders the same
[33:23] miracles
[33:25] i don't care what the devil said to you
[33:27] this morning i don't care how we came at
[33:29] you last night
[33:30] you are born for such a time as this let
[33:33] the church see amen
[33:37] you may be seated friends
[33:40] you're not going to get anything if
[33:41] you're not in the spirit hallelujah the
[33:43] world is in their spirit
[33:45] they're in the spirit of all that's
[33:46] going on the biggest discussion in
[33:48] trinidad
[33:49] is if they're going to cancel carnival
[33:53] headline news to cancel or not to cancel
[33:56] what a predicament what a situation what
[33:59] a crisis
[34:00] imagine that's taking up people's time
[34:03] when there's a tribulation coming
[34:04] when there's judgment coming when
[34:06] there's a rapture coming
[34:08] too many people are sitting out in
[34:09] church and they have lost the burden
[34:12] to realize that we're not going to be
[34:13] here forever and that any day now
[34:16] this thing is going to change before our
[34:18] very eyes
[34:19] people are happy to sit in the message
[34:21] and think because they're in the message
[34:23] it automatically means they are going to
[34:26] the rapture
[34:27] if that's been preached to you that is
[34:29] alive being in the message
[34:31] doesn't put you in the rapture to be in
[34:33] the rapture you must be in a rapturing
[34:35] condition
[34:36] there must be something on the inside
[34:39] inside
[34:46] inside
[34:50] you maybe see them but the brandon said
[34:52] when the rapture takes place
[34:54] it'll be so humble it'll be so simple
[34:57] you're hardly gonna even realize it so i
[35:00] asked a question this
[35:02] morning if this whole church goes into
[35:04] the rapture
[35:05] i think they're going to realize it
[35:11] i'm shaking you this morning so i'm
[35:13] going to challenge you but they brought
[35:14] to the rapture is a small group of
[35:15] people
[35:17] i hate to tell it to you but some people
[35:19] are not gonna make it
[35:21] people are sitting uncomfortable in the
[35:23] message they're not gonna make it
[35:25] because you're not gonna make it if
[35:26] you're not in a rapturing condition
[35:33] hallelujah this is not about the
[35:36] preacher
[35:36] this is not about the church this is not
[35:38] about who your pastor is
[35:40] it's are you ready for the rapture this
[35:42] morning
[35:48] you may be seated your job cannot be
[35:50] more important than preparing for the
[35:52] rapture
[35:54] your school cannot be more important
[35:56] than preparing for the rapture
[35:59] because when the branham said you maybe
[36:00] she said just as in noah's day
[36:03] the earth was destined for the flood
[36:06] just time for destruction what about our
[36:08] day but the branham said the world is
[36:10] headed for
[36:11] funeral service fire is gonna burn this
[36:14] world
[36:15] what will your degree do your degree can
[36:18] protect you
[36:18] from the fire your boyfriend can't
[36:20] protect you from the fire
[36:22] your neighbor can't protect you from the
[36:25] fire your
[36:26] boss cannot protect you from the fire
[36:30] shake yourselves in here this morning
[36:33] and get into rapturing condition
[36:39] you may be seated because if you are not
[36:42] in rapture and condition
[36:43] you are heading straight for the
[36:45] tribulation
[36:48] and for those who hear this message you
[36:51] may be seated for those who are in the
[36:53] church
[36:54] they are who was called a remnant those
[36:57] who were exposed to the truth
[36:58] and did not get into condition and the
[37:01] word says that when the rapture takes
[37:03] place
[37:04] the beast will be so angry he will hunt
[37:07] the remnant
[37:08] you don't think the devil knows your
[37:09] name you don't think the devil knows
[37:11] you're a dress
[37:12] you don't think the devil knows where
[37:13] you work and you want to play church
[37:15] and play games wake up in here this
[37:20] morning
[37:26] hallelujah hallelujah
[37:29] you may be seated for some of you in
[37:32] here there's the final warning
[37:34] but the planets have to reject the word
[37:36] of your day
[37:37] is to cross the line it's to cross the
[37:40] line and when you cross that line
[37:42] there is no coming back god will only
[37:44] give mercy mercy mercy
[37:46] but after a while it switches to
[37:48] judgment
[37:56] but people want to sit in the message
[37:59] talk about my group
[38:00] and my pastor and my church well this
[38:03] morning it's not about the church
[38:05] it's not about the pastor is let every
[38:07] man
[38:08] examine himself you can't blame your
[38:11] husband
[38:12] you cannot blame your wife you cannot
[38:14] blame your children
[38:15] let every man examine himself
[38:20] and see if you measure up to what peter
[38:22] branham said is
[38:23] rapturing condition
[38:28] we're gonna make heaven high and hell
[38:30] hot this is not a pentecostal church
[38:33] this is not a metadata church it's not a
[38:35] catholic church this is the house of god
[38:37] and the angel of the lord the one with
[38:39] the swept back wings
[38:40] he is here this morning
[38:49] you may be seated i don't know how foul
[38:52] getting this message tomorrow
[38:54] how pal gets into this message i have 14
[38:57] pages
[38:58] joseph 14 year prophecy i don't know i
[39:00] don't know how far i'm gonna go this
[39:01] morning
[39:02] but you wanna break into crying and
[39:04] sighing that's all right
[39:06] because i'm gonna talk about that later
[39:07] on but i challenge you this morning
[39:10] don't you leave this church the same way
[39:12] that you came
[39:13] don't watch this tape and go back and do
[39:15] the same thing that you were doing
[39:17] before
[39:17] it's a time of reckoning it's a time of
[39:20] transformation
[39:21] it's a time of change and this can be
[39:23] your last chance
[39:24] to hear the word of the lord
[39:34] this morning those things which are
[39:37] revealed
[39:38] they belong to us and to our children
[39:42] there's a prophecy over your children
[39:44] this morning i don't care what condition
[39:46] they might be in there's a prophecy
[39:48] over them this morning
[39:52] hallelujah hallelujah
[39:55] so mother father be encouraged be
[39:57] encouraged this morning
[39:59] god knows their name he knows their name
[40:02] this morning
[40:03] he knows where they are right now and at
[40:05] the right season
[40:06] god is going to bring the handcuffs of
[40:08] the spirit and arrest them
[40:10] take them against their will and say
[40:12] listen sister had you right
[40:14] i give you your two boys
[40:22] hallelujah you may be seated this
[40:24] morning
[40:26] so brother bannon revealed
[40:30] that there's a power coming into the
[40:32] church
[40:34] and people always ask the question well
[40:36] where is the power what happened to the
[40:38] power
[40:39] the bottom line is this god is not going
[40:41] to hand his power to children
[40:47] most of the crime that exists today is
[40:49] young children
[40:51] 12 year olds teenagers with guns
[40:55] most of the robberies take place with
[40:57] children between the ages of 12 and 19
[41:01] because they are children they have not
[41:04] lived long enough to appreciate
[41:06] how hard it is to get certain things and
[41:08] because they don't know the toil and the
[41:10] sweat
[41:11] of acquiring certain things they push
[41:13] themselves to limits and extremes
[41:16] because they don't want to take the
[41:17] sacrifice and the discipline
[41:21] the gun puts power in their hands to do
[41:23] certain things
[41:25] a 16 year old feels powerful when he has
[41:27] a gun in his hand
[41:29] his mother can't talk to him his father
[41:31] can talk to him
[41:32] he goes to school with it he walked a
[41:34] street with it and nobody could talk to
[41:36] him
[41:37] that's power without character
[41:41] amen satanic
[41:46] when we have people in the message who
[41:48] won't shake your hands how could god
[41:50] pour the power out
[41:52] because the power we need is power not
[41:54] just to heal and not just to do this
[41:56] it's power to transform to change this
[42:00] mortal to immortality that's real power
[42:04] that's not a play game power that's real
[42:07] power
[42:11] so god has to wait until some sons and
[42:14] daughters
[42:14] come to maturity
[42:21] because when you are mature you think
[42:23] differently
[42:24] you speak differently you conduct
[42:27] yourself
[42:28] differently
[42:31] if you have a two-year-old child and a
[42:33] two-year-old child breaks something
[42:35] you don't get in a fight and say i'm
[42:37] gonna fight you wanna meet outside and
[42:38] fight no he's two years old he doesn't
[42:40] know what happened
[42:40] amen he's not mature
[42:44] but as he grows older you expect him to
[42:46] get more mature
[42:48] so in the early stages of your christian
[42:50] experiences there were a lot of stuff
[42:52] you broke
[42:56] and god has had to shake you here and
[42:58] tap you here and say don't do that
[43:00] anymore don't do that anymore come on
[43:01] grow up
[43:03] you're not going to be a child all the
[43:04] time you're not going to lack
[43:06] understanding all the time paul said it
[43:08] like this
[43:08] when i was a child i speak as a child i
[43:11] understood as a child but when i became
[43:12] a man
[43:13] i put away the childish things
[43:20] so god had to send some of us through
[43:22] fiery trials
[43:24] interrupt our lives send us into
[43:27] situations
[43:28] to force us to get mature
[43:31] listen it's impossible to get mature
[43:35] in a bed of ease when everything is all
[43:38] right
[43:39] even jesus had to learn obedience
[43:42] by the things he suffered so if jesus
[43:45] had to suffer
[43:46] you think god gonna make it easy for you
[43:49] i like you
[43:50] nice suit no you're gonna have to suffer
[43:53] but at the end of it you're gonna be a
[43:55] mature son
[43:56] you're gonna be a seasoned son you're
[43:58] gonna be a tried son
[44:00] you're gonna be a proven son can the
[44:03] church say man
[44:10] brother kangli that was not in my notes
[44:14] so we are on to page 15 now
[44:17] amen so malachi 4 revealed many things
[44:22] there's a power coming into the church
[44:24] there'll be a manifestation of the sons
[44:26] of god
[44:27] by and through the bride will be
[44:28] fulfilled all
[44:30] there'll be an omega word bride with
[44:32] same signs wonders and miracles
[44:34] like the alpha church once more the
[44:36] world will hear direct from god
[44:39] there will be an ephesians 4 ministry
[44:41] all
[44:42] with the baptism of the holy ghost there
[44:44] will be a perfect
[44:46] church there will be a church with jesus
[44:48] christ
[44:49] walking in it there will be a church
[44:51] where sin
[44:52] cannot stay in it
[44:59] malachi 4 revealed that seven thunders
[45:02] is the prize revival
[45:04] he revealed that rapturing faith is
[45:06] laying in the message
[45:08] he revealed the same jesus who healed
[45:10] the sick
[45:11] raised the dead made the lame walk made
[45:13] the dumb talk
[45:14] walked on water and fed five thousand
[45:17] that same jesus
[45:18] will be veiling a people

[45:34] hallelujah the great mystery
[45:39] that's been hit christ in you the hope
[45:41] of glory
[45:43] malachi 4 reveal is going to be a
[45:45] rapture
[45:46] it's going to be a resurrection there's
[45:48] going to be a wedding supper
[45:49] there's destruction coming this world is
[45:52] destined to be destroyed
[45:54] the bible says heaven and earth will
[45:56] pass away but my word will never pass
[45:58] away
[45:59] and what is revealed friends it belongs
[46:01] to us
[46:02] god promised certain things to us and he
[46:05] is obligated to do it
[46:06] or he is going to be called a liar and
[46:08] my god is not a liar
[46:10] whatever he said he is going to do
[46:12] somebody say man
[46:15] you may be seated listen friends the
[46:18] bride will not be deceived

[49:02] i know where i'm going
[49:06] you may be seated i don't know why the
[49:08] history channel don't come to us
[49:10] the prophet already reveal every mystery
[49:12] they're trying to discover this
[49:14] research this archaeological fine we
[49:16] have the archaeological
[49:18] finds right here with malachi pro
[49:20] already brought every mystery
[49:22] from genesis to revelation we know what
[49:25] happened
[49:26] we know where we come from
[49:29] you may be seated but if branham told us
[49:33] enoch built the pyramids he's still
[49:34] trying to figure out who built the
[49:36] pyramids
[49:38] you are such a blessed people this
[49:39] morning and you want to tell me i can't
[49:41] shout
[49:42] i can worship
[49:48] hallelujah
[49:51] we are back to the bible this morning
[49:55] it is only through the prophetic message
[49:58] of the seventh angel
[49:59] that we could truly go back to the bible
[50:03] why because revelation 10 7 says but in
[50:06] the days of the voice
[50:07] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[50:10] to sound the mystery of god
[50:12] should be finished as he had declared to
[50:15] his servants the prophets
[50:20] so the ministry of that elijah
[50:23] malachi seen luke 17 30.
[50:27] revelation 10 7 the seventh angel was to
[50:30] gather
[50:30] all the scattered word and tie up all
[50:34] the loose
[50:34] ends as a seven thunder seven seal
[50:38] message
[50:38] so that an elected bride can come to
[50:41] perfection
[50:42] adoption and go into the rapture
[50:46] that's a mouthful listen to the tape
[50:52] again
[50:55] but behold i show you a mystery this
[50:58] morning
[50:59] we shall not all sleep hallelujah some
[51:03] of us will sleep but we shall not all
[51:05] sleep but abraham he wanted to go to the
[51:08] rapture but he had to
[51:10] fall asleep but we shall not all
[51:13] sleep hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[51:18] and those that are asleep they are
[51:20] waiting for us to come into
[51:22] rapturing condition
[51:27] what a jubilee what a blessed peace
[51:30] hallelujah breaking from time into
[51:33] eternity
[51:35] you may be seated
[51:39] the rapture will be a defining
[51:43] moment brother branham said jesus would
[51:47] be the showdown between denomination and
[51:49] creed for
[51:50] he will come to back up his word and
[51:53] take his pride
[51:54] in the rapture
[51:57] in the eternal mind of god as he looks
[52:00] at time
[52:02] time is divided into two categories
[52:06] before the rapture and after the rapture
[52:12] before the rapture is a time of
[52:14] preparation
[52:15] for the rapture there can be no wedding
[52:18] supper
[52:19] unless there's a rapture there could be
[52:21] no tribulation
[52:22] unless there is a rapture so this
[52:24] rapture is a defining moment
[52:27] in time whether it is to one person
[52:32] this morning or a thousand people the
[52:34] message is still the same church
[52:37] get ready for the rapture
[52:41] friends let us not lose the focus of why
[52:43] god sent william mariam branham
[52:46] the purpose of the evening time message
[52:49] is to bring the bride
[52:50] into rapturing condition
[52:53] listen to the prophet in the message of
[52:55] the first seal he said at the end
[52:57] of the pentecostal age we are supposed
[53:00] to receive according to the word
[53:02] as god help me tonight to show you there
[53:05] we are to receive a messenger
[53:08] that will take all those loose ends out
[53:10] there and reveal
[53:11] the whole secret of god for the
[53:14] rapturing of the church
[53:17] so friends we must be in
[53:21] rapturing condition not church condition
[53:25] not message condition but rapturing
[53:28] condition the fact that you are here
[53:31] this morning is evidence
[53:33] that this message gathered you
[53:36] but the question is are you
[53:39] ready and this morning i say let
[53:43] every man examine
[53:46] himself i just want to place three
[53:49] quotes
[53:50] before i hit the next part of my text
[53:52] this morning but i ran him in the first
[53:53] seal
[53:54] seven thunders of revelation may he show
[53:56] the bride how to prepare
[53:58] for the great translation faith
[54:01] and is this the sign of the end server
[54:03] the random said where are we at sis
[54:06] what's all of this about i'm asking
[54:09] the other angels was messengers men of
[54:12] the year but this angel
[54:14] said to the angel of the church of
[54:15] laodicea to the angel of the church of
[54:17] ephesus
[54:17] the messengers of the earth see men
[54:19] messengers prophets
[54:21] and so forth to the church but this one
[54:23] didn't come from earth
[54:24] he come down from heaven because the
[54:26] mystery is all finished
[54:28] and when the mystery is finished the
[54:30] angel said time shall be no more
[54:32] and seven thunders throw their voices
[54:34] out
[54:35] what if it is something to let us know
[54:38] how to enter
[54:39] into the rapturing fate will we run a
[54:43] leap of a wall
[54:44] is there something fixing to happen and
[54:46] these all mod
[54:48] vile bodies are going to be changed
[54:51] can i live to see it oh lord is it so
[54:54] close that i'll see it
[54:55] is this the generation serves my
[54:58] brethren
[54:58] what time is it where are we at
[55:03] that's the prophet crying out last quote
[55:06] in united time and signed by the brandon
[55:08] said god is uniting his bride
[55:11] she is coming together from the east and
[55:13] the west and the north and the south
[55:15] there is a uniting time and that's on
[55:18] right now but the band said what is she
[55:21] uniting for
[55:22] the rapture amen god's getting her ready
[55:26] yes sir
[55:26] uniting what is she uniting with with
[55:29] other churches
[55:30] with other ministers no with the word
[55:33] for
[55:34] all heavens and earth will pass away but
[55:36] my word
[55:37] shall never pass away she is uniting
[55:40] herself with thus
[55:42] saith the lord regardless of what any
[55:45] denomination
[55:46] or anybody else says she is uniting
[55:49] herself
[55:50] she is getting ready why she is the
[55:52] bride that's right
[55:54] can the church say amen give the lord a
[55:57] hand of praise this morning
[55:58] let me coast a little bit
[56:15] is there anybody here this morning wants
[56:16] to go to the rapture
[56:23] anybody want to leave this whole filthy
[56:24] world behind
[56:26] leave the styles leave the
[56:29] hallelujah leave the sickness and the
[56:31] back pain and the problems
[56:43] hallelujah
[56:46] rapturing condition friends
[56:50] we're in a space academy this morning
[56:54] we're getting ready for the rapture
[56:57] friends we are preparing to defy
[56:59] gravity
[57:02] amen the law of gravity says what goes
[57:05] up
[57:07] must come down the law of gravity
[57:10] says there's a magnetic force that pulls
[57:12] objects to the center of the earth
[57:15] the law of gravity says you're not
[57:17] leaving here
[57:19] listen to the bro listen to what brother
[57:21] branham says
[57:23] do you know when you raise your hand you
[57:24] defy every law of science
[57:30] do you know your hands supposed to hang
[57:32] down gravitation holds it to the ground
[57:35] but do you know when you raise your
[57:36] hands up it shows that there's something
[57:38] supernatural in you
[57:40] has made a decision something that's not
[57:44] natural something that's not scientific
[57:47] it's a spirit that's in you has made you
[57:50] break gravitation by a supernatural
[57:53] being
[57:54] hallelujah is that why we say worship
[57:58] we defy gravity when you praise god
[58:02] when you stand to your feet when you
[58:04] lift your hands up you are defying
[58:06] gravity
[58:09] somebody give god worship this morning
[58:23] the law of gravity you may be seen in
[58:25] jehovah jaira but the random said
[58:28] and they raise their hands and stood in
[58:29] their feet defying the law of gravity
[58:32] that there's a life in there so do we
[58:35] defy the law of the world and unbelief
[58:39] so when you begin to worship you begin
[58:40] to defy the law of the world
[58:42] and all the unbelief can the church say
[58:45] man
[58:46] i feel like preaching now but but it was
[58:48] my background is over
[58:50] it's time for us to get to rapturing
[58:51] condition this morning
[58:53] you may be seated so the devil is one of
[58:55] the greatest lawyers
[58:58] one of the greatest lawyers the devil is
[58:59] a great lawyer he knows the law
[59:02] he's a chief prosecutor revelation 12
[59:04] calls him the accuser of the brethren
[59:07] somebody help me this morning but i'm so
[59:09] happy that we also have a lawyer
[59:12] that has never lost a case every time
[59:15] the devil accuses you
[59:17] somehow the judge says not guilty not
[59:20] guilty
[59:21] not guilty you have defied the law
[59:24] to be here this morning somebody help me
[59:28] preach
[59:30] hallelujah hallelujah
[59:34] somebody's shaming hallelujah
[59:38] my god has never lost a case every time
[59:41] why
[59:41] because it's a higher law there is a
[59:44] higher law
[59:45] to go to the rapture you need to tap
[59:47] into a higher law
[59:49] how do we know there's a higher law
[59:51] easter proved it's a higher law
[59:54] because jesus was supposed to stay at
[59:56] 10. but if you look into the grave
[59:58] if you look into the tumor he is not
[1:00:01] there he defied that law
[1:00:05] oh somebody help me preach this morning
[1:00:10] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:14] and the law says because you fell in sin
[1:00:17] you'll finish
[1:00:18] but i'm here to tell you there's a
[1:00:20] higher law this morning
[1:00:22] the law says because you're fornicated
[1:00:24] you're over
[1:00:25] but there's a higher law this morning
[1:00:27] the law says
[1:00:28] because your backslid you're over but
[1:00:30] it's a higher law this morning
[1:00:34] and this higher law will take me to the
[1:00:37] rapture this higher law will take me to
[1:00:39] the resurrection
[1:00:40] this higher law will take me to the
[1:00:42] wedding supper
[1:00:50] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:00:54] hallelujah the law says you did this
[1:00:57] the law said you did that the law said
[1:00:59] you made this make
[1:01:00] the devil accusing you what you did last
[1:01:03] night
[1:01:03] what you did yesterday what he did last
[1:01:06] month but here comes jesus
[1:01:08] that's in jesus
[1:01:17] you may be seated one time they brought
[1:01:20] a woman to jesus
[1:01:22] they say jesus this woman
[1:01:26] was caught in the very act of adultery

[1:01:31] instagram
[1:01:32] it was not on facebook she was caught in
[1:01:35] the very act
[1:01:36] there is no mistake about it we know she
[1:01:38] did it
[1:01:39] and the law says we should stone up
[1:01:42] jesus
[1:01:43] without saying words at first he's like
[1:01:45] i know there's a higher law
[1:01:47] somewhere he turned around to them he
[1:01:49] said
[1:01:50] you have no sin cast the first stone
[1:01:54] that's when you know in in in in the
[1:01:57] courtroom
[1:01:58] there's some lawyers who are so good
[1:01:59] when you see the law passing like whoa i
[1:02:01] never thought of that and there it is
[1:02:03] jesus he broke into higher law
[1:02:06] he says you who have no sin
[1:02:09] cast the first stone and one by one that
[1:02:12] higher law
[1:02:13] began to make all those pharisees say
[1:02:14] you know what when i look into the
[1:02:16] mirror
[1:02:17] and examine myself
[1:02:23] when i examine myself i don't measure up
[1:02:27] to take this tone and throw at anybody
[1:02:29] else

[1:02:32] situation

[1:03:28] away
[1:03:33] hallelujah church come up hither there's

[1:04:27] about to strike
[1:04:28] there's a higher law that will take you
[1:04:30] to the rapture
[1:04:37] you may be seated i trust this message
[1:04:40] shakes you this morning
[1:04:42] wakes you up this morning we're in a
[1:04:45] space academy this morning
[1:04:49] brother branham delivered the curriculum
[1:04:55] and the holy spirit is a tutor
[1:04:59] the holy spirit will determine who
[1:05:01] graduates from this class
[1:05:04] in other words the holy spirit
[1:05:06] determines who is adopted
[1:05:10] the holy spirit watches your behavior
[1:05:12] and conduct
[1:05:14] the holy spirit wants to see if you
[1:05:16] would apply the token
[1:05:19] the holy spirit wants to see if you
[1:05:21] could die out
[1:05:23] seven deaths for seven birds
[1:05:26] we're in a space academy this morning
[1:05:29] and to enter this academy you need faith
[1:05:32] and when you're in the academy you begin
[1:05:34] to add to that fate
[1:05:36] virtue and knowledge and temperance
[1:05:39] and patience and godliness and brotherly
[1:05:42] kindness
[1:05:43] and then charity seals you and puts you
[1:05:45] in rapturing conditions
[1:05:52] this message is so simple
[1:05:59] what is rapturing conditions
[1:06:07] let every man examine himself do i look
[1:06:10] like that
[1:06:11] do i walk like that do i talk like that
[1:06:17] and if you don't have this we need to
[1:06:19] press until we have this
[1:06:26] but the brandon brought the curriculum
[1:06:29] we norman what material we're supposed
[1:06:32] to
[1:06:32] have preach become
[1:06:35] the ministers are supposed to rightly
[1:06:38] divide
[1:06:40] the word the curriculum and
[1:06:43] once it's rightly divided now it's up to
[1:06:46] you
[1:06:46] to climb because the pastor cannot
[1:06:50] graduate
[1:06:51] for you the minister cannot graduate
[1:06:54] for you i can graduate in your class for
[1:06:58] you
[1:06:59] it's either you graduate or you don't
[1:07:01] graduate
[1:07:04] the pastor cannot be adopted for you
[1:07:07] he cannot be perfected for you so you
[1:07:10] can't just sit into it and say well i
[1:07:12] like my pastor
[1:07:15] that's the word you have to climb
[1:07:19] you have to add to your faith let every
[1:07:22] man
[1:07:23] examine himself this morning
[1:07:29] what did enoch do he showed us in type
[1:07:32] how god prepares you for the rapture
[1:07:35] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:07:37] patience colonies broadly kindness
[1:07:39] that's how enoch went
[1:07:41] knew what was inside of him so he
[1:07:43] testified to the world
[1:07:45] this is how i went out of here and he
[1:07:46] built the pyramid
[1:07:49] and left it for the world as a testimony
[1:07:53] and malachi 4 revealed the revelation in
[1:07:56] our day
[1:07:57] how to get out of here by the word again
[1:08:00] which is the pyramid
[1:08:02] and god right under the nose of satan
[1:08:06] and in the face of fourth anointed one
[1:08:08] in spite of the world and your trials
[1:08:11] and your tribulations and your testings
[1:08:13] and your ups and downs
[1:08:15] he's building another pyramid
[1:08:18] in your heart this morning and we are
[1:08:22] getting ready for the rapture
[1:08:26] we might make mistakes friends because
[1:08:28] we are humans
[1:08:30] and this body is human so that's why god
[1:08:33] put a blood atonement
[1:08:35] for our mistakes so when he looks down
[1:08:38] at us
[1:08:38] he looks through the blood and he sees
[1:08:41] you perfect
[1:08:43] he hears the voice of the blood and the
[1:08:46] blood is speaking for you this morning
[1:08:49] and god is looking down at you and
[1:08:51] seeing seven virtues
[1:08:53] be informed in you i can't no devil stop
[1:08:57] it
[1:08:58] friends to go in the rapture you must be
[1:09:01] in
[1:09:01] rapturing condition you can be raptured
[1:09:05] the way you are
[1:09:06] you've got to be trained
[1:09:09] but a man i'm in a message perfect faith
[1:09:11] i'm not going to be too much longer with
[1:09:13] you
[1:09:14] so when a man lives by faith and walks
[1:09:17] by faith i mean
[1:09:18] substance faith he is isolated from the
[1:09:21] entire world and becomes a new creature
[1:09:24] in christ
[1:09:26] there now you're getting into bright
[1:09:28] material see
[1:09:30] you're getting into rapturing condition
[1:09:32] now
[1:09:33] that means for every one of us for each
[1:09:35] one of us not just the pastor
[1:09:37] deacon's trustees that means with a
[1:09:39] laity every individual
[1:09:41] walks in a world with god alone you're
[1:09:44] baptized into this kingdom
[1:09:46] and there's nobody in there but you and
[1:09:48] god
[1:09:49] amen in the message christ
[1:09:53] is the mystery of god reveal that's
[1:09:54] about three quotes
[1:09:57] now what are you going to do everybody
[1:09:59] with me this morning
[1:10:01] now what are you going to do when you
[1:10:03] get all that group together
[1:10:05] where the revelation is perfectly in
[1:10:07] harmony
[1:10:08] and god expressing it through his word
[1:10:10] by the same actions the same thing that
[1:10:13] he did
[1:10:13] making the word manifest oh if the
[1:10:16] church only knew
[1:10:17] its position it will one day then the
[1:10:20] rapture will go
[1:10:21] when she knows what it is
[1:10:27] in the message the rapture but brother
[1:10:29] branham said but to the church the pride
[1:10:31] the rapture is a revelation to her it's
[1:10:34] revealed to us
[1:10:36] that the revelation the true bride of
[1:10:38] christ will be waiting for that
[1:10:40] revelation
[1:10:41] of the rapture
[1:10:44] hallelujah friends
[1:10:48] if you want to go to space if you want
[1:10:51] to go on a spaceship
[1:10:53] you got to go through some kind of
[1:10:54] training the astronauts spend a long
[1:10:57] time
[1:10:59] getting prepared to go into space
[1:11:02] because space is a different
[1:11:03] atmosphere it's a different environment
[1:11:07] you can walk the same way in space like
[1:11:09] you walk on earth
[1:11:10] because on earth you are subject to
[1:11:12] gravity but when you go to space your
[1:11:14] body begins to move a little differently
[1:11:15] you begin to
[1:11:16] float you can't just drink out of a cup
[1:11:17] because if you pour like this the water
[1:11:19] just going to float in the air
[1:11:21] so you have to go into a zero gravity
[1:11:25] chamber
[1:11:26] and we're gonna get some experience with
[1:11:29] the
[1:11:29] atmosphere of what you're gonna go into
[1:11:32] and if you realize that in this
[1:11:34] simulation you can't
[1:11:36] perform in that simulated environment
[1:11:37] you're not ready
[1:11:39] for the real thing so this simulated
[1:11:42] environment
[1:11:43] is to work the kings out
[1:11:46] to work the problems out until you get
[1:11:49] comfortable
[1:11:50] and only when you pass this simulation
[1:11:53] you're qualified
[1:11:54] to go on to the real thing so that's why
[1:11:56] brahms said it takes love to get you
[1:11:58] there
[1:11:58] so in this atmosphere this environment
[1:12:01] rapture and condition
[1:12:02] means you could handle whatever
[1:12:04] condition exists over there
[1:12:06] so it means in this simulation you've
[1:12:08] got to learn how to forgive
[1:12:10] you got to learn how to love you gotta
[1:12:12] learn to drop your hearts
[1:12:13] you gotta learn to shake your brother
[1:12:15] hannah you gotta look
[1:12:17] anybody with me this morning is this a
[1:12:19] word or is this not the word this
[1:12:20] morning
[1:12:25] you can't be trying to get a rapturing
[1:12:27] condition and still trying to figure out
[1:12:29] how close to your knee you want to cut
[1:12:30] the skirt
[1:12:32] because that can't work over there
[1:12:41] in this simulation you got to work all
[1:12:43] the kings out
[1:12:46] you can listen to worldly music over
[1:12:48] there
[1:12:49] so why are you listening to it in the
[1:12:51] simulation
[1:12:55] we're trying to get into rapturing
[1:12:57] condition
[1:12:58] you can't have a whirly boyfriend over
[1:13:01] there so how could you have it in the
[1:13:02] simulation
[1:13:08] you can be cursing out the neighbor over
[1:13:10] there so why are you cursing over here
[1:13:13] you're going to spend a lot of time in
[1:13:14] the simulation
[1:13:20] and after a while if you go into flight
[1:13:22] school and you just keep feeling the
[1:13:23] simulation they say you know what
[1:13:25] next consistency we in space academy
[1:13:28] we have two disciplines suspension and
[1:13:30] expulsion
[1:13:33] some people on suspension right now
[1:13:35] because they haven't behaved themselves
[1:13:37] suspended when god discipline you and
[1:13:39] exposing is when you cross the line and
[1:13:41] god say you know what
[1:13:43] this flight is not for you
[1:13:46] you still want a whole lot and that's
[1:13:48] why two weeks ago i spoke about the word
[1:13:50] test because the simulation is where you
[1:13:52] have the word test because only the word
[1:13:54] itself can go over there
[1:13:56] no interpretation could go over there no
[1:13:58] hybrid could go over there only the pure
[1:14:00] word
[1:14:01] could go over there so god will test you
[1:14:04] and god can't test you
[1:14:06] god can't tell you the exam in advance
[1:14:08] and say this is intestinal
[1:14:09] this is an example again tomorrow look
[1:14:12] the exam has to come in a way
[1:14:14] that you need to whoo is this the christ
[1:14:18] what did the prophet say about this and
[1:14:20] that should be your mood always i was
[1:14:22] fellowshipping with one of my friends in
[1:14:23] nigeria and we were fellowshipping on
[1:14:25] the wood and he kept asking where did
[1:14:27] brother branham say it where'd he put it
[1:14:28] i'm saying i said that's how it's
[1:14:29] supposed to be and i said to him he
[1:14:32] yeah he asked me a question he's like i
[1:14:33] don't know the answer i need to check
[1:14:35] what brother branham said
[1:14:36] because i don't want to speculate
[1:14:39] because i want to pass the word test
[1:14:41] if i speculate why did god send the
[1:14:43] prophet the prophet came so that we
[1:14:45] don't have any speculation in the
[1:14:47] message
[1:14:48] i don't know if it is maybe it is maybe
[1:14:49] this is this is no room for maybe it's a
[1:14:52] rapture
[1:14:53] and i'm not trusting my rapture
[1:14:54] experiencing anybody
[1:14:57] who are you going to blame when you miss
[1:14:59] the rapture and you are standing in the
[1:15:00] tribulation
[1:15:03] that's why i let every man examine
[1:15:05] himself
[1:15:06] i wrote in my notes not only will the
[1:15:09] beast
[1:15:10] be looking for the remnants you know the
[1:15:12] remnant will be looking for the
[1:15:13] ministers who deceive them
[1:15:16] amen
[1:15:20] that's why i challenge you let every man
[1:15:22] examine himself
[1:15:24] i'm not taking chances with the rapture
[1:15:29] you must be in rapturing condition
[1:15:33] those whirly magazines can't be over
[1:15:36] there why do you have them here
[1:15:40] those filthy movies can be over there
[1:15:42] why do you have them here
[1:15:45] that hairstyle can't work over there why
[1:15:47] do you have it here
[1:15:51] over there you're always in the world
[1:15:52] you always praising god over here you
[1:15:54] want to come to church and that's it
[1:15:55] that's your quarter for the week
[1:15:58] over there they're always shouting and
[1:15:59] praising it in case you didn't know it's
[1:16:01] eternal shouting and worship
[1:16:03] so you might as well get in the
[1:16:04] atmosphere now
[1:16:12] i can't tell you don't work because by
[1:16:15] the sweat of your brow you're supposed
[1:16:16] to eat
[1:16:16] but i challenge young people always you
[1:16:18] have to make a choice
[1:16:20] with what job you take because you
[1:16:22] cannot tell god i missed the rapture
[1:16:23] because i had to work on sundays and i
[1:16:27] didn't add
[1:16:27] the word food value for the spirit to
[1:16:30] unite with that word in me so i'm
[1:16:31] missing every other sunday or missing
[1:16:33] three sundays a month because of work
[1:16:38] let every man examine himself
[1:16:42] if your job jeopardizes you go into the
[1:16:45] rapture you need to change your job
[1:16:48] if the friends you have are jeopardizing
[1:16:51] you go into the raptor you need to
[1:16:52] change your friends
[1:16:54] because you cannot compromise with going
[1:16:57] to the rapture
[1:17:07] though i know mysteries and speak with
[1:17:08] tongs and have all knowledge and don't
[1:17:10] have charity i'm nothing
[1:17:11] there are people who will have knowledge
[1:17:13] mysteries and feed the poor and still
[1:17:15] miss the rapture
[1:17:18] you have to have charity you have to
[1:17:20] have dynamics
[1:17:21] you have to have the person of christ
[1:17:23] the statue of a man of a perfect man
[1:17:25] must be in you
[1:17:26] you must be a reflection of jesus christ
[1:17:28] there is no compromise
[1:17:30] there's no middle ground you know god
[1:17:32] says either your heart or your cold
[1:17:34] either you go to the rapture or you're
[1:17:36] seeing any tribulation
[1:17:37] there's no middle ground i'll spew you
[1:17:39] out of my mouth
[1:17:44] friends think about it in the message
[1:17:47] that will come a day people will come to
[1:17:48] church
[1:17:49] and they will not have realized that the
[1:17:51] rapture took place
[1:17:55] i don't plan to be here i don't know who
[1:17:58] can be ushering
[1:18:00] i don't know who what type of service
[1:18:02] that's going to be
[1:18:03] but it's going to vary a very depressing
[1:18:04] service it's not funny it's the reality
[1:18:07] of the situation
[1:18:08] because that's what we're heading for
[1:18:09] but you see the problem today is people
[1:18:12] don't take god seriously because if you
[1:18:14] did you will change your behavior
[1:18:18] because the boss on your job tell you
[1:18:21] that if you come to work late three
[1:18:22] times you make sure you're not late
[1:18:25] if you miss if you come late three times
[1:18:26] you lose your job you have a certain
[1:18:28] attitude because you know there's
[1:18:29] consequences
[1:18:31] but we think god is just allowing things
[1:18:33] to happen and watching you in your
[1:18:34] foolishness
[1:18:35] when the word has come for us to grow
[1:18:38] and be formed into the word image
[1:18:40] how many times do you have to tell you
[1:18:41] leave the worldly boy leave the world
[1:18:43] gear leave the worldly music don't cut
[1:18:44] your hair
[1:18:45] wear dressed properly you're not
[1:18:47] supposed to have
[1:18:48] work clothes and church clothes this
[1:18:50] length dislike disliked
[1:18:52] what is that that is rapturing condition
[1:18:58] this is one for churches the one for
[1:18:59] work it's two different outfits
[1:19:03] look in your closet you're shocked
[1:19:06] friends i'm speaking plainly because
[1:19:07] we're trying to get a rapturing
[1:19:09] condition
[1:19:11] when the prophet says sisters don't cut
[1:19:14] your ear that's the word
[1:19:16] there's no compromise when you hear
[1:19:18] jesus said do you hear justin what
[1:19:20] you blame me here jesus for you missing
[1:19:22] rapture
[1:19:26] is this the word or is this not the word
[1:19:31] only the truth will set you free you
[1:19:34] have to stand
[1:19:35] for the word god will only recognize the
[1:19:39] word
[1:19:40] god will only back the word up you know
[1:19:43] you're close that's supposed to be tight
[1:19:44] why is it tight
[1:19:47] we're trying to be in what rapturing
[1:19:50] condition
[1:19:52] i don't care what the world says the
[1:19:54] world by the branham said it's
[1:19:56] atomic father that's the material that
[1:19:59] the bomb is going to explode that's a
[1:20:00] harsh thing to say but is the truth
[1:20:04] you trying to go to the rapture and
[1:20:06] you're experimenting with makeup
[1:20:09] there's no makeup over there you know
[1:20:11] what brother branham called
[1:20:12] jezebel the high priest of makeup
[1:20:15] brother branham called her dog meat
[1:20:17] because the dogs ate
[1:20:20] ate her up no dog meat is going to the
[1:20:24] rapture
[1:20:25] but isaac all you can say that i'm
[1:20:27] quoting the prophet
[1:20:28] don't get upset with me amen and that
[1:20:31] prophet had
[1:20:32] jesus christ failed in him so you come
[1:20:34] against this you come against god
[1:20:36] i have immunity this morning
[1:20:45] you're a man of god you're a sister of
[1:20:47] god what are you doing spending all that
[1:20:48] time with that boy or girl in the world
[1:20:51] married unmarried whatever the situation
[1:20:53] is there's supposed to be a line of
[1:20:55] separation
[1:20:56] because you are a levite you are
[1:20:59] procrastinated
[1:21:00] you are chosen for a purpose
[1:21:07] but just as there's a condition for the
[1:21:09] rapture there's a condition if you want
[1:21:11] to stay here
[1:21:12] there are people who want to stay in
[1:21:13] them
[1:21:15] it has to be because if you don't want
[1:21:17] to take action to get your life in order
[1:21:19] it means you want to stay here
[1:21:21] you want to go to the three and a half
[1:21:23] year tribulation period and die and go
[1:21:24] to white
[1:21:25] judgment but i have a wedding supper
[1:21:29] i have a millennium i have a new city
[1:21:32] i come from god i'm going back to god
[1:21:35] and if you have not heard this kind of
[1:21:36] gospel before
[1:21:38] i hope it shakes your heart to get your
[1:21:40] life right with god
[1:21:43] clean up your house let every man
[1:21:45] examine
[1:21:46] himself can the church say amen
[1:21:52] i'm not going to be too much longer with
[1:21:54] you
[1:21:56] to go into the raptor friends you must
[1:21:58] apply the token
[1:22:01] amen but abandon preach the token and
[1:22:06] then that evening he preached what
[1:22:08] what what message desperation
[1:22:13] friends in the messenger talking but
[1:22:14] abraham said apply it church you
[1:22:16] now don't fail don't he says it three
[1:22:19] times don't
[1:22:20] don't don't let the sun set
[1:22:24] don't don't don't don't rest
[1:22:27] day or night i'm quoting a prophet don't
[1:22:31] take no chance it won't work
[1:22:34] children it won't work you must have the
[1:22:37] token
[1:22:40] listen to the prophet you say i believe
[1:22:42] yes i go
[1:22:43] yeah i believe the message that's all
[1:22:45] right that's good
[1:22:46] but you must have the token
[1:22:49] do you hear branham tabernacle and i say
[1:22:51] this morning do you hear headstone
[1:22:53] tabernacle
[1:22:54] you must have the token displayed
[1:22:58] without it all you're believing is in
[1:23:01] vain
[1:23:02] he said see you've lived a good life you
[1:23:05] listen to what the word says
[1:23:07] you go to church you try to live right
[1:23:09] that's fine but that's not it
[1:23:11] when i see the blood that's the token
[1:23:17] in the same message listen to the
[1:23:18] prophet don't
[1:23:20] just come this far say i believe the
[1:23:22] message
[1:23:24] you obey the messenger come into christ
[1:23:28] you say what i believe every word
[1:23:30] brother branham that's good
[1:23:32] but that's just being able to read
[1:23:36] and that's a lot of the message people
[1:23:37] just know the word they're just able to
[1:23:39] read a spoken one book
[1:23:41] where is the token what's the token
[1:23:42] that's a token that's the life of christ
[1:23:47] but ibrahimo said take the message take
[1:23:50] it into your heart
[1:23:51] that you must have the token
[1:23:54] the very life that was in christ be in
[1:23:57] you
[1:23:58] when i see that i will pass amen
[1:24:02] over you the musicians coming in and get
[1:24:05] ready
[1:24:08] i'm going to begin to wind up now
[1:24:11] the bible says in
[1:24:21] in the book of ezekiel chapter 9
[1:24:28] he said ezekiel 9 verse 1 he's cried
[1:24:31] also in my ears with a loud voice saying
[1:24:34] cause them
[1:24:34] that have charged over the city to draw
[1:24:38] near
[1:24:39] even every man with his destroying
[1:24:43] weapon in his hand and behold six men
[1:24:47] came from the way of the higher gate
[1:24:49] which lied toward the northern every
[1:24:50] manner slaughter weapon in his hand
[1:24:52] and one man among them was clothed with
[1:24:54] linen with the writers
[1:24:56] writers in corn by his side and they
[1:24:58] went in and stood beside a brazen altar
[1:25:01] and the glory of the god of israel was
[1:25:04] gone up from the cherub
[1:25:05] whereupon he was to the threshold of the
[1:25:07] house and he called it a man claw with
[1:25:09] linen which had the righteous ink income
[1:25:11] by his side
[1:25:12] listen and the lord said unto him go
[1:25:14] through the midst
[1:25:15] of the city through the midst of
[1:25:17] jerusalem
[1:25:18] and set a mark upon the forehands of the
[1:25:21] men that sigh
[1:25:23] and that cry for all the abominations
[1:25:26] that be done
[1:25:26] in the midst thereof and to the others
[1:25:29] he said in mind hearing go
[1:25:31] after him through the city and smite let
[1:25:33] not your eyes spear
[1:25:34] neither have he pity slay utterly
[1:25:39] old and young amen this is the bible
[1:25:43] both means and little children and
[1:25:46] women but come not near any man
[1:25:50] upon whom is the mark and begin
[1:25:54] at my sanctuary then they began
[1:25:57] at the ancient men which were before the
[1:26:00] house
[1:26:02] and brother branham he tied this
[1:26:06] scripture
[1:26:09] to revelation 7 and he said after these
[1:26:12] things i saw four angels standing on the
[1:26:14] four corners of the earth
[1:26:16] holding the four winds of the earth that
[1:26:18] the wind should not blow
[1:26:20] on the earth not on the sea nor on any
[1:26:22] tree
[1:26:23] and i saw another angel ascending from
[1:26:25] the east having the seal of the living
[1:26:27] god
[1:26:28] and he cried with a loud voice to the
[1:26:31] four angels
[1:26:32] to whom it was given to hurt the earth
[1:26:34] and the sea
[1:26:35] saying hurt not the earth neither the
[1:26:38] sea
[1:26:38] nor the trees till we have sealed the
[1:26:41] servants
[1:26:42] of our god in their foreheads
[1:26:46] and friends with the branham brought out
[1:26:48] that world war one was stopped
[1:26:51] for the ceiling angel to move through
[1:26:54] the camp
[1:26:55] and put a mark on those that sigh and
[1:26:58] cry
[1:27:00] for the abomination in the city and i
[1:27:02] wonder
[1:27:03] this morning if the ceiling angel were
[1:27:05] to walk through here right now
[1:27:07] and to look upon those who are sighing
[1:27:09] and crying
[1:27:11] is there anybody that would be sealed
[1:27:13] this morning
[1:27:15] is there anybody that has such a burden
[1:27:18] in their heart
[1:27:21] or have you become so used to the
[1:27:23] abomination
[1:27:24] so comfortable with the abomination you
[1:27:27] have accepted the abomination as normal
[1:27:30] or does it hurt you when you look around
[1:27:33] and see the sin
[1:27:34] and see the evil and see the young
[1:27:36] people and see the marriages
[1:27:38] and see the enemies attack and say oh
[1:27:40] god you made a promise
[1:27:43] would you move in this house and deliver
[1:27:45] your people
[1:27:47] sigh and cry for those who just come to
[1:27:50] church
[1:27:51] and go back home sign and cry
[1:27:54] for those who have no prayer life sigh
[1:27:57] and cry
[1:27:58] who for those who are just at ease in
[1:28:01] zion
[1:28:02] sigh and cry because they're just happy
[1:28:05] to be in the message
[1:28:07] when the angel is saying to the
[1:28:10] destroying angels who don't touch them
[1:28:13] until i've
[1:28:14] sealed all those the ceiling angel is
[1:28:16] here this morning
[1:28:19] to seal you into the kingdom of god
[1:28:23] before the terrible plague strike
[1:28:26] friends there's judgment coming but the
[1:28:29] branham said these angels
[1:28:31] are the ones responsible for the war and
[1:28:34] all the wars
[1:28:35] and the weapons of mass destruction

[1:29:34] respond to the word you grieve the holy
[1:29:36] spirit

[1:29:46] oh god help us this morning help us this
[1:29:50] morning
[1:29:52] in the message leadership
[1:29:56] and the last few messages that brother
[1:29:58] branham preached before he left on
[1:30:00] december 24 are so special to me
[1:30:05] because that angel was veiled in the
[1:30:07] prophet
[1:30:08] and god knew when the prophet was going
[1:30:10] to go home
[1:30:12] so i asked myself the question if god
[1:30:14] knew brother branham is going to go home
[1:30:15] and
[1:30:16] i wonder what last secrets he left her
[1:30:19] us
[1:30:20] what will brother branham's parting
[1:30:22] words to us
[1:30:24] he didn't even know the day or the time
[1:30:26] he was going to leave but god knew
[1:30:28] in the message leadership that was
[1:30:30] preached
[1:30:31] on december the 7th 1965 just a few days
[1:30:34] before but the brandon went home
[1:30:36] but abandoned said here now look at
[1:30:38] yourself
[1:30:39] really are you a genuine bible christian
[1:30:42] full of love of god remember the
[1:30:45] kangaroo
[1:30:46] remember the bible said in the last days
[1:30:48] when this time takes place
[1:30:50] he said a mocking angel went through the
[1:30:54] churches
[1:30:56] went through the cities and sealed
[1:30:59] only those who sighed and cried for the
[1:31:03] abomination that was done in the city
[1:31:07] is that right ezekiel 9. so this morning
[1:31:10] friends
[1:31:11] that mock an angel is going through
[1:31:13] churches
[1:31:15] going through cities what
[1:31:18] position are you in this morning
[1:31:22] in the old testament one time joshua had
[1:31:25] to go to battle and
[1:31:26] somebody did something wrong and just
[1:31:29] called try by tribe
[1:31:31] he called family by family individual by
[1:31:34] individual
[1:31:36] every man had to examine himself to find
[1:31:39] out where the problem was friends
[1:31:41] when last have you examined yourself
[1:31:44] and come to the reality it's not about
[1:31:46] how much you jump it's not how much
[1:31:48] you shout it's not even how much you
[1:31:49] pray
[1:31:51] it's how much you live this it's how
[1:31:54] much you sigh and cry and say lord
[1:31:56] i don't want to go home the seminar that
[1:31:58] came out tomorrow really doesn't matter
[1:32:00] tomorrow really doesn't matter what you
[1:32:03] think is important and the
[1:32:04] job and the bills and this and that when
[1:32:06] if the raptor happens two days from now
[1:32:08] and you rush out of church to go home
[1:32:10] and you miss the rapture what's the use
[1:32:14] friends
[1:32:15] what's the use prince i challenge you
[1:32:20] you can't blame anybody friends young
[1:32:23] people i don't care who backslides who
[1:32:25] walks away
[1:32:27] this message is for individuals
[1:32:31] no group no church no pastor holds the
[1:32:33] monopoly on the rapture
[1:32:37] the word has been preached to us
[1:32:40] and it's up to every single one of us to
[1:32:42] measure up
[1:32:44] amen you could have knowledge and mr
[1:32:46] rapture
[1:32:48] you could speak in tongues and mr
[1:32:49] rapture you could feed the poor and miss
[1:32:52] a rapture
[1:32:53] you could give your body to be burned
[1:32:54] and missed the rapture
[1:32:56] you must have charity dynamics the token
[1:33:00] the literal life seven thundering voices
[1:33:03] christ in you the hope of glory to go
[1:33:06] into the rapture
[1:33:08] i want to end with this prayer you could
[1:33:10] play softly
[1:33:13] god doesn't call man to judgment without
[1:33:16] first warning him
[1:33:18] as a prophet god doesn't call man to
[1:33:21] judgment
[1:33:22] without first warning him amen but
[1:33:25] ibrahim is praying say i pray god that
[1:33:27] tonight and i say today

[1:34:03] under this so long and seen so many
[1:34:05] things that
