[36:18] little fees of it keep us all you shall
[36:22] not surely die just one word
[36:23] oh my and something struck me and I
[36:26] don't know if I'll talk about it is
[36:27] Sunday about dark knowledge tact and
[36:30] understanding praise God not getting the
[36:33] right information the right knowledge
[36:35] and this is the age at the Bible talk
[36:37] about knowledge shall increase there is
[36:39] no need for people to be ignorant
[36:41] because full knowledge is unfolded you
[36:44] read must all live in here just type it
[36:46] in google and search it and get it out
[36:47] just not any kind of knowledge - so to

[1:08:05] that's what you desired of what you want
[1:08:07] won't keep you alone my here we go
[1:08:11] and the Holy Spirit we ready something
[1:08:13] classic always speaks the word I've got
[1:08:15] many things to tell you you cannot
[1:08:16] understand it now but when he comes he
[1:08:18] will guide you to it that's the reason
[1:08:23] the common of the seals at the finishing
[1:08:28] these are important question I can
[1:08:30] explain this and stretch it that long
[1:08:31] more be and watered on you know this is
[1:08:33] this is a very compact concise and
[1:08:35] precise just as it is I got a chance
[1:08:39] this no just after here to receive it
[1:08:42] that's the reason the common of the
[1:08:45] seals at the finishing of the seventh
[1:08:49] seal the mystery of God should be
[1:08:52] finished to know who what is what is how
[1:08:57] he else his nature his being you're
[1:09:00] supposed to be all the way up here which
[1:09:03] is by the pyramid here all the way up
[1:09:05] here which is right up the pyramid by
[1:09:08] that time so by that time you're
[1:09:10] supposed to be in Burnet Aquinas you
[1:09:16] know what I said
[1:09:17] nothing check people come to church
[1:09:21] they're not coming to God when a
[1:09:24] chimeric what is different the view of
[1:09:26] church becomes different in a comment
[1:09:28] that is Church the coming into his
[1:09:31] presence
[1:09:31] [Music]
[1:09:35] so therefore the top part got put
[1:09:37] birthday kindness he got put some my
[1:09:38] enemy in between but this is how God is
[1:09:41] read feeding the orange feed into yellow
[1:09:44] up into green and to blue in the indigo
[1:09:48] in the violet that's holy faith unlike
[1:09:51] what if it burned it comes you put in
[1:09:52] this age it's narrows so you get a lot
[1:09:54] of people at the bottom see a lot of
[1:09:58] Jesus in Jesus name present isn't
[1:10:01] brought bottom there well as you go up
[1:10:04] you'll notice it's unknown you get
[1:10:06] caught you get home shape that brotherly
[1:10:09] kindness you have to put yourself in
[1:10:12] your brother's place on the matter that
[1:10:15] brotherly kindness is you not sitting
[1:10:16] down criticizing because you think you
[1:10:18] could do a better job that is you really
[1:10:21] and extend yourself with compassion and
[1:10:23] empathy compassion on what empathy and
[1:10:30] pretend when you feel for somebody
[1:10:32] [Music]
[1:10:35] like well but of India a son died and I
[1:10:38] went on the end which was a missile
[1:10:40] unusual I'd already stiff of the grief
[1:10:43] side and so on like was their right shoe

[1:11:16] his shoes could fit the man you see the
[1:11:18] man already blind no cord and he might
[1:11:20] have no shoes I mean they're finding
[1:11:22] that a lot people come to service to
[1:11:23] have my shoes you see people sign up on
[1:11:25] the platform with motion sickness
[1:11:26] specials
[1:11:30] but but when whatever I'm finished man
[1:11:32] was healed God restore his eyesight he
[1:11:35] said you have to feel for the person and
[1:11:38] regardless of what somebody do you if

[1:15:54] people say he can hear know yet the
[1:15:56] carry on my cord it knowing you forget
[1:15:58] that God is nothing doing you don't want
[1:16:01] to hear your cry now when I say men are
[1:16:04] not to sell is written on God wanting
[1:16:07] hear from you you can't touch him
[1:16:11] because Tex Tex have no feelings all

[1:16:41] subroutine so much that it it went to
[1:16:43] heaven
[1:16:44] heaven touch Jesus Jesus turn around and

[1:17:17] bring us into the full stature of the
[1:17:18] sons and daughters of God that's the
[1:17:21] reason of the common of the seals first
[1:17:24] Corinthians 2:10 says but God had
[1:17:26] revealed them unto us by his Spirit for
[1:17:29] the spirit searcheth all things yea the
[1:17:31] deep things of God for what man knoweth
[1:17:35] the things of a man save the spirit of a
[1:17:38] man which is in him even so the things
[1:17:42] of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of
[1:17:45] God no we are received not the spirit of
[1:17:48] the world but the Spirit which is of God
[1:17:50] that we might know the things that are
[1:17:53] freely given to us of God which things
[1:17:56] also we speak not in the words which
[1:17:59] man's wisdom teacheth but which the Holy
[1:18:01] Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual
[1:18:04] things with spiritual but the natural
[1:18:06] man receiveth not the things of the
[1:18:08] Spirit of God for their foolishness of
[1:18:10] the him if I can he know them because
[1:18:11] they are spiritually discerned Oh glory
[1:18:15] to God hallelujah breathe cardamon so
[1:18:19] the Spirit of Truth was to lead us to
[1:18:21] the book which is the book the Lamb's

[1:18:39] tree was lost to the ages so we're not
[1:18:41] to restore this troops that we can come
[1:18:43] back with the spirit now because

[1:20:10] attributes of righteousness imputed
[1:20:11] imparted unto me blessed be God forever
[1:20:14] these things said he that is true this
[1:20:17] is where we go wrong this world true is
[1:20:20] not of a very wonderful world it does
[1:20:23] that mean true in the sense of it's the
[1:20:25] opposite of false it expresses the
[1:20:28] perfect realization of an idea as
[1:20:32] contrasted with the passion
[1:20:34] realization I just love this just have
[1:20:37] me
[1:20:38] it's not true as opposed to false true
[1:20:42] as opposed to the unfolding truth of
[1:20:44] perfect realization and that they send
[1:20:47] John 14:21 no that's very common little
[1:20:51] perfect realization when you know that
[1:20:53] you know he said this man in in
[1:20:56] Corinthians you shall know as you
[1:20:59] unknown Oh glory to God because God know
[1:21:02] you are certainly well glory to God your
[1:21:05] friends talking about your mother your
[1:21:07] father but eyes are you that says the
[1:21:09] flesh fatter you but you are known a
[1:21:11] certain way and the promises you shall
[1:21:14] know as you unknown but before the
[1:21:20] foundation of the world Oh
[1:21:22] glory to God that's why I call you
[1:21:24] because you are before noon you are
[1:21:28] therefore you can be perfected because
[1:21:32] [Applause]
[1:21:34] it means you put your name on the Lamb's
[1:21:36] Book of Life
[1:21:36] not tonight but before the foundation of
[1:21:39] the world that gives you an opportunity
[1:21:41] to be a real gene of God Germa of God
[1:21:44] child of God
[1:21:45] Oh glory to God justified hallelujah
[1:21:55] whoa we don't go to man I burn around
[1:21:58] give a reference here watch since this
[1:22:00] would indeed expresses perfect
[1:22:02] realization as against the idea idea
[1:22:05] idea of partial realization no you can
[1:22:08] understand as never before the antitype
[1:22:10] contrasted with a tight take for example
[1:22:12] all the manna from heaven court said no
[1:22:14] angel bread from heaven for Israel but
[1:22:16] that bread did not satisfy it was only
[1:22:18] good for a day those who ate for hungry
[1:22:20] the next day if it was left or wrong it
[1:22:23] was become contaminated but Jesus is the
[1:22:25] true bread which manna was a type and if
[1:22:29] any Mattie's of that better come from
[1:22:30] heaven he will never hunger again so
[1:22:33] when the mighty angel came on seven
[1:22:34] thunders water voices oh it was the
[1:22:36] bread come back again
[1:22:37] it was a living bread then Thomas living
[1:22:41] bread together the bride together
[1:22:43] - what about how to repair that gift
[1:22:46] that my back
[1:22:47] the Lord Himself come to call a bride or
[1:22:50] give the Lord a shout voices a call
[1:22:55] Abreu hallelujah
[1:22:57] you know God if any man eat of that
[1:23:00] bread I come from heaven he will never
[1:23:02] hunger again he does not need to
[1:23:04] compassionate again this moment he
[1:23:06] partook eternalized here indeed was
[1:23:08] reality no need of a shadow no need of
[1:23:12] passion salvation never is the whole of
[1:23:14] it
[1:23:14] Oh glory to God hallelujah as the pillar
[1:23:18] of fire give light at night and was
[1:23:20] wonderful no light and life or
[1:23:22] manifested in the fullness of the
[1:23:23] Godhead bodily is allowed I think I read

[1:23:27] carefully now and see something really
[1:23:29] sweet and beautiful I said this this is

[1:24:19] into the Millennium hear what he says
[1:24:20] about being a certain kind of a God and
[1:24:22] he who blesses himself in the earth
[1:24:24] shall bless himself in the God of truth
[1:24:26] yes that is true but the real
[1:24:29] translation is not gonna shoot it is the
[1:24:31] god of the amen so we read it shall
[1:24:34] bless themselves in the core of the amen
[1:24:36] he has swear it and the earth shall
[1:24:37] swear by the god of the amen because the
[1:24:40] former troubles are forgotten and
[1:24:41] because they hid from my eyes for behold

[1:25:13] not of God
[1:25:14] Oh hallelujah the new testament does not
[1:25:16] reveal another God it's the full
[1:25:18] revelation of the one unseen God Christ
[1:25:21] did not come to make himself known he
[1:25:23] came he did not come to reveal the Sun
[1:25:25] he came to reveal and make known the
[1:25:27] father he never talked about two gods he
[1:25:30] talked about one God I know in this age
[1:25:32] we have come back to the capstone
[1:25:34] revelation hallelujah the most important
[1:25:38] revelation of Godhead in the whole Bible
[1:25:40] Jesus is God he and the father are one
[1:25:42] there is one God his name is the Lord
[1:25:44] Jesus Christ he is the god of the amen
[1:25:47] he never changes what he does never
[1:25:49] changes he says it and it stands fast it
[1:25:52] is done forever
[1:25:53] so when caught put your name on the book

[1:26:02] didn't come up on any piano please let
[1:26:06] me hit this trust hallelujah hallelujah
[1:26:11] hallelujah dan barber unquote the
[1:26:15] scripture these things saith the Amen
[1:26:18] it's not like that it means that
[1:26:21] whatever he said is final it means that
[1:26:23] whatever he said to the fullest age to
[1:26:25] the second to all the ages of his true
[1:26:27] church of what a fourth right is exactly
[1:26:29] right it won't change it means what he
[1:26:31] started open Genesis he will finish in
[1:26:33] Revelation he paths to for he is the
[1:26:35] Amen it means show be it now we can see
[1:26:38] again why the devil hates the book of
[1:26:40] Genesis and revelation he hates the
[1:26:41] truth he knows the truth will prevail he
[1:26:45] knows what his n will be how he fights
[1:26:47] that but we are on the winning side I
[1:26:49] could dance a leader Danton on
[1:26:51] tonight be on the winning side
[1:26:55] I mean believers of his world only on
[1:26:58] the 'man side all glory to God
[1:27:01] hallelujah hallelujah these things saith
[1:27:05] the faithful true witness now I want to
[1:27:08] show you what I find in the thought of
[1:27:09] faithful you know we often talk about a
[1:27:11] great unchanging God whose word does not
[1:27:13] change when we speak of him after that
[1:27:15] manner
[1:27:16] we often get a view of him as very
[1:27:17] impersonal it is as though God made the
[1:27:20] whole universe all the laws that pertain
[1:27:22] to it and stood back and became a great
[1:27:24] in please don't God it is a so God made
[1:27:26] a way of salvation for lost mankind at
[1:27:28] the way of the cross then when after the
[1:27:30] dead Christ atone for sins and as his
[1:27:32] resurrection there was an open door to
[1:27:33] him both full in his arms and stood back
[1:27:35] it's as if we majored in believing in
[1:27:38] the Great Creator who haven't created
[1:27:40] lost personal interest in his creation
[1:27:42] now I see that it's the whole to many a
[1:27:44] people think or after think but that's
[1:27:46] wrong thinking God is governing in the
[1:27:50] affairs of men right now the Lord shall
[1:27:56] be in the homestretch he is both creator
[1:27:59] and sustainer
[1:28:01] [Applause]
[1:28:05] so here's covenant in the affairs of men
[1:28:08] right now Alleluia

[1:28:12] interested in your walk tonight and
[1:28:14] chiseling your pork tonight interested

[1:28:18] what makes you free what will give you
[1:28:20] joy he's interested in your joy he wants
[1:28:23] you to have joy it's his will for you to
[1:28:25] have joy - Oh hallelujah here's what the
[1:28:33] creator and the sustainer Colossians
[1:28:36] 1:16 17 for by him all things were
[1:28:39] created that I in heaven that I know
[1:28:41] visible and invisible whether they be
[1:28:43] Thrones dominions principalities or
[1:28:45] powers all things were created by him
[1:28:47] and for him and he is before all things
[1:28:51] and by him all things consist
[1:28:54] he's our sovereign God by his own
[1:28:56] counsel purpose the plan of salvation of
[1:28:59] his own elect which he foreknew the son
[1:29:01] tied up on the cross they established a
[1:29:03] means of salvation and the holy spirit
[1:29:05] carefully
[1:29:06] execute the will of the Father he is
[1:29:08] working all things at this moment
[1:29:10] according to the purpose of his own will
[1:29:12] he is right now in the midst of it all
[1:29:14] he's in a mess of the church this
[1:29:16] creator and Savior God is faithfully
[1:29:19] working right now among and script these
[1:29:21] people he is the shepherd of the sheep
[1:29:23] and that's why I say tonight the spirit
[1:29:25] of truth is here the guide to lead us
[1:29:27] into perfection you say with him we
[1:29:38] rejoice we haven't seen them but we
[1:29:39] can't steal them we know him as much as
[1:29:42] our limited senses can let us but one
[1:29:44] day it will be face to face for that is
[1:29:47] for this age he is coming at the end of
[1:29:50] this age parcel realization will be made
[1:29:53] perfect realization complete realization
[1:29:56] is a hallelujah we have been looking
[1:29:57] through a glass darkly but sooner will
[1:29:59] be face to face we have seen we have
[1:30:02] been going from glory to glory but we'll
[1:30:04] be right in the glory and in his glory
[1:30:06] we shall shine
[1:30:07] we shall be like him wondrously like him
[1:30:10] she's the receiver divine Oh glory to
[1:30:13] God be accomplished in him he will not
[1:30:15] lie to us about that but one day we will
[1:30:17] be changing the atoms we will put on
[1:30:19] immortality we swallow up in life then
[1:30:22] we will realize realization Oh glory to
[1:30:25] God hallelujah praise God amen
[1:30:30] hallelujah truth to bring us our perfect
[1:30:34] realization not Paschal truth that is
[1:30:37] inherently genuine entirely without
[1:30:40] falsehood absolutely pure and timeless
[1:30:43] eternal sincere heartfelt without
[1:30:46] dissimulation without guy here because
[1:30:49] it's a spirit of truth you shall know
[1:30:52] the truth and the chicken to free you
[1:30:54] Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God
[1:30:59] God was this great spirit we pictured
[1:31:02] him of a seven color rainbow the Buddha
[1:31:04] would actually cover the earth but now
[1:31:06] as God is eternal he was perfect perfect
[1:31:08] love perfect peace will fake joy all
[1:31:11] those seven spirits as we have in
[1:31:13] Revelations he said made-up God what's
[1:31:16] perfection everything else I'm sorry
[1:31:19] that has these something else put with
[1:31:20] it from that so he's saying that seven
[1:31:23] spirits make up God and that is
[1:31:27] perfection no the only way that we can
[1:31:30] come back to perfection is to come back
[1:31:32] to that perfection which is called
[1:31:35] hallelujah
[1:31:37] what's the prophetic talk about doing
[1:31:38] bow like no letter now you're caught
[1:31:41] that is
[1:31:44] or glory no goddamn become to perfection
[1:31:46] and we have eternal life without end we
[1:31:48] don't anything is just for eternal life
[1:31:50] now I believe that there's a church
[1:31:52] comminuted a perfection that the
[1:31:55] Ministry of perfection really offices
[1:31:58] where the Apostles on the prophets and
[1:31:59] the teachers in the passage in Francis
[1:32:01] for the perfection of the church then
[1:32:03] passes on teachers will be sure with the
[1:32:05] word until the whole thing will work
[1:32:07] right up to the common of the Lord we
[1:32:10] are nearing that time Oh glory that God
[1:32:13] lost for money lots of big things lots
[1:32:15] of popularity these things our debt to
[1:32:17] the deliverer

[1:34:59] the Bible lady to be the truth you will
[1:35:01] lead a legend
[1:35:01] do you accept it not because I said it
[1:35:05] because God said do you believe we are
[1:35:07] living in last days when the son of man
[1:35:09] was to be manifested then this is deep
[1:35:12] that would be that would be all the word
[1:35:14] that is kind of to luta Wesley Baptist
[1:35:18] all of that and a Pentecostal all
[1:35:20] gathered up to the revelation of what
[1:35:23] it's been the seven angel was to open 16
[1:35:26] mystery it's all gathered up into the
[1:35:29] Son of Man this fullness of time has
[1:35:32] come to the fullness of his word to
[1:35:34] manifest the fullness of the body that's
[1:35:36] the word then the spoken word may
[1:35:38] manifest by the would reveal the word so
[1:35:40] you say all that was scattered Malachi 4
[1:35:43] William Branham got only review 6 yields
[1:35:45] it's all gathered up in the son of man
