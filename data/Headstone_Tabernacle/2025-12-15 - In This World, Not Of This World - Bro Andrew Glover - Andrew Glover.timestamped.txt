[42:41] this generation. Amen. What devil can
[42:44] stop her? There isn't one.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; What demon can limit her? There isn't
[42:48] one. She's an unlimited bride with

[42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil can throw everything he
[43:01] wants to on us. We'll just pick it up
[43:02] and throw it back.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's no demon
[43:06] &gt;&gt; that can hold this body of Jesus Christ,
[43:08] the bride of Jesus Christ down. You love
[43:10] the Lord tonight. Would you give him a
[43:12] praise offering in the house of God?
[43:15] He's worthy of He's worthy of all our
[43:18] praise. He's worthy of all of our honor.
[43:20] There's no God like Jehovah. There's no
[43:22] God with him. There's no God beside him.
[43:25] He's God and he's God alone. Amen. Amen.
[43:28] My what a what a joy it is to be in the
[43:31] house of God tonight. And Amen. I tell
[43:33] you, I finally found somewhere I can fit
[43:35] in and dance. Amen.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; I was somewhere the other day and they
[43:41] said, "Brother Andrew, you need some
[43:42] dancing lessons." And I said, "Well, I
[43:44] don't I don't know how to, but I
[43:48] I'm having a good time. Amen. Amen. We
[43:51] love you tonight with the love of the
[43:52] Lord. We say God bless you.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank you again, Brother Theo,
[43:57] Brother Isaac, for this opportunity to
[43:58] be here. And I do want to take this
[44:00] moment to thank you all for all the
[44:02] hospitality, the room, everything you've
[44:04] done for us, the food, and the
[44:06] fellowship. It's just been a wonderful
[44:07] time in the presence of God. And we
[44:09] thank you all for this time to come and
[44:11] fellowship with you and and be with you
[44:13] tonight. And uh we just want to take a
[44:15] few moments tonight in the word and uh
[44:17] we want to say it's good to see brother
[44:18] Andrew. God bless you. Amen. It's been a
[44:20] been a few days since we've seen you,
[44:22] but it's real honor to see you again.
[44:24] And met brother Andrew several years ago
[44:26] there in Canada and some meetings there.
[44:28] And so he uh and I we got a good name.
[44:31] Amen.
[44:33] We got the same name. So Amen. But it's
[44:35] real honor to see you, brother Andrew.
[44:37] God bless you. And I think you said
[44:39] Sister Hannah was here tonight. Amen.
[44:41] God bless you. Sister Hannah, God bless
[44:43] you. Years ago, we were there with him
[44:45] and brother uh Sister Hannah and brother
[44:46] David in their home and fellowshipping
[44:48] there many, many years ago. So, it's
[44:50] good to see you. God bless you. Please
[44:51] greet brother David for us and the and
[44:53] the family there. And Amen. It's just
[44:55] good to be a part of the body of Christ.
[44:57] Amen. Amen. There's one thing we know.
[45:00] There's no body on the earth like the
[45:01] body of Jesus Christ. Amen. Ever joint
[45:04] working together and supplying. And we
[45:06] thank the Lord for it tonight. Just
[45:08] before we open the word, maybe we would
[45:09] just bow our hearts tonight for a word
[45:11] of prayer.
[45:13] And we want to ask the Holy Spirit to
[45:14] just to come by tonight and to pick up
[45:17] the things that he's laid upon our heart
[45:18] and to speak to your heart by it.
[45:21] Heavenly Father, Lord, as these eagles
[45:23] have gathered here once more, we're
[45:25] gathered here under a divine promise.
[45:27] Lord, that you said wherever the carcass
[45:29] is, there the eagles would be gathered
[45:31] together. And Father, we're not gathered
[45:33] here under the expectations of a man or
[45:36] under the expectations of a church. But
[45:38] Father, we've gathered here tonight
[45:40] under spiritual expectations of your
[45:42] revealed word. For Lord, your prophet
[45:44] has taught us that we'll get exactly
[45:47] what we expect. And Father, if we're
[45:49] expecting negative, then that's what
[45:50] we'll get. But Lord, if we're expecting
[45:52] the positive, then all things are
[45:54] possible.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Now, Father, I pray as we endeavor to
[45:57] look into your word that you would open
[45:59] the windows of heaven tonight. Father,
[46:01] you would fill this place with your
[46:02] anointing, with your mercies and your
[46:04] graces.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Father, if there would be one here
[46:07] tonight that's growing cold on you,
[46:09] Lord, I pray that there would come such
[46:11] an uncction of the Holy Ghost in their
[46:13] heart.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, that you would melt away the ice
[46:15] of unbelief.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; You would melt away the ice of doubts,
[46:19] oh God, and it would become like a
[46:20] snowball on the stove, Father. And Lord,
[46:23] that the realities of your presence
[46:25] would become so real to every heart here
[46:27] tonight. Lord, that when we would leave
[46:29] these meetings, we would be able to say,
[46:31] "Did not our hearts burn within us? Not
[46:34] as a man talk to us along the way, but
[46:36] as you talk to us along the way." And
[46:38] Father, we'll be sure to give thee all
[46:40] the praise, all the honor, and all the
[46:42] glory. For it's due thy wonderful name.
[46:44] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[46:46] pray. And all the believers says,
[46:49] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. If you have your Bibles
[46:52] tonight, we want to go to the book of
[46:54] St. John the 15th chapter. The book of
[46:57] St. John uh the 15th chapter and the
[47:00] 18th verse. St. John chapter 15 and
[47:04] verse number 18.
[47:07] Jesus here speaking. He says, "If the
[47:10] world hates you, ye know that it hated
[47:13] me before it hated you."
[47:16] &gt;&gt; If ye were of the world, the world would
[47:19] love his own.
[47:21] But because you are not of the world, I
[47:24] love one translation to that. You no
[47:26] longer belong to the world.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Because you are not of the world, but I
[47:31] have chosen you out of the world.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Then therefore the world hateth you.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Also want to look in the book of second
[47:39] Corinthians chapter 6. 2 Corinthians
[47:42] chapter 6 and verse number 13. 2
[47:45] Corinthians chapter 6 and verse number
[47:48] 13. Paul here uh writing he says now for
[47:52] a recompense in the same I speak as unto
[47:54] my children be ye also enlarged. Now be
[47:57] ye not unequally yolked together with
[47:59] unbelievers.
[48:01] For what fellowship hath righteousness
[48:03] with unrighteousness? And what communion
[48:06] hath light with darkness? And what
[48:08] concord hath Christ with bile? Or what
[48:12] part hath he that believeth with an
[48:14] infidel? And what agreement hath the
[48:17] temple of God with idols? For ye are the
[48:20] temple of the living God.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; As God hath said, I will dwell in them,
[48:25] and will walk in them, and I will be
[48:28] their God, and they shall be my people.
[48:30] Now, now, where is this going to happen?
[48:32] It's going to happen right here on this
[48:34] earth. Now, wherefore come out from
[48:36] among them, and be ye separate, saith
[48:39] the Lord, and touch not the unclean
[48:42] thing, and I will receive you. I love
[48:44] verse 18. And will be a father unto you,
[48:48] and ye shall be my sons and daughters,
[48:50] saith the Lord Almighty. Amen. We ask
[48:53] the Lord this evening to bless the
[48:55] reading of his word. As you can have
[48:56] your seat here uh this afternoon, I want
[48:59] you by the help of the Lord to speak to
[49:00] you here uh from these scriptures
[49:02] tonight on this title uh in this world,
[49:05] not of this world. Amen. In this world,
[49:08] not of this world. And you know, I
[49:10] believe that as believers, I can I can
[49:13] say this tonight, maybe cover all of us.
[49:15] I believe that we are growing more weary
[49:17] of this world every day. How many could
[49:19] witness that we're growing more weary of
[49:22] this world every day? I love what the
[49:24] prophet would say. He would say, "I'm so
[49:26] glad that by faith we can see aar the
[49:29] coming of the [singing] Lord Jesus and
[49:30] making preparation to get out of this
[49:34] old world that's going to be burned
[49:36] sometime with unquenchable fire." Now,
[49:39] uh, that that really speaks to my heart
[49:40] that we're not, uh, making preparations
[49:43] to stay in this world. Amen. But we're
[49:45] making preparations to get out of this
[49:47] world. Amen. Because this world is not
[49:50] our home. Amen. Amen. I love what Paul
[49:53] said. He said, "We are pilgrims and
[49:54] strangers." Amen. And we are just
[49:56] passing through. Remember Paul said that
[49:58] Hebrews 11, he said, you know, they that
[50:00] say such things declare plainly, amen,
[50:03] that they seek a country. Amen. Amen.
[50:05] And truly if they had been mindful of
[50:07] that country from which they came out,
[50:10] they might have had opportunity to have
[50:12] returned. But now they desire a better
[50:15] country. Amen. That is an heavenly
[50:17] wherefore God is not ashamed to be
[50:20] called their God. For he hath prepared
[50:23] for them a city. Now I love this. The
[50:25] prophet of God says, "We profess that we
[50:28] are pilgrims and strangers. We are not
[50:30] of this world because we have been
[50:33] called out and we have been separated by
[50:36] the Holy Ghost. Now, amen. We have been
[50:39] called out and separated by the Holy
[50:41] Ghost. And now we walk in a new life.
[50:44] Now, I love this because God's children
[50:46] have always, amen, been considered
[50:49] strangers and pilgrims, amen, upon this
[50:52] earth. Brother Random will identify you
[50:53] like he did Father Abraham. [laughter]
[50:55] He said, "We are like Abraham." Amen. We
[50:58] left the world. Ain't that something?
[51:00] Amen. We're still in the world, but we
[51:02] have left the world. Amen. We are like
[51:04] Abraham. We are looking for a city.
[51:07] Amen. Whose builder and maker is God.
[51:09] And we are believing that some glorious
[51:11] day we shall see that city. How many How
[51:14] many can testify by the grace of God,
[51:16] some glorious day, amen, we shall see
[51:19] that city. He said, "My whole heart's
[51:22] desire," Amen. is to see that glorious
[51:26] city. Amen. Now when I begin to think
[51:28] about that, amen, if God has a prepared
[51:31] city, amen, he then has prepared a
[51:33] people, amen, for that prepared city. I
[51:37] think of how in St. John chapter 17, uh,
[51:39] the Bible speaks of our Lord Jesus who
[51:42] prayed, Amen, the great intercessor who
[51:44] prayed that powerful prayer and he
[51:46] prayed for the church and he prayed that
[51:48] the church would be kept sure, amen, in
[51:51] the world. Isn't that something he
[51:52] prayed? Amen. That while the church was
[51:55] in the world that they would be kept
[51:57] pure in it. He said, "Look, I have given
[51:59] them thy word."
[52:01] &gt;&gt; And the world hated them because they
[52:04] are not of the world even as I am not of
[52:07] the world. I pray not that thou should
[52:09] take them out of the world, but that
[52:11] thou should escape them from the evil.
[52:13] See, they are not of the world. Now, I
[52:16] don't know how you feel about yourself
[52:17] tonight, but it's pretty powerful. Amen.
[52:19] that when Jesus prayed for you, he did
[52:22] not leave you lesser, but he actually
[52:24] raised you up to himself and said, "They
[52:27] are not of the world, even as I am not
[52:30] of the world." He said, "Sanctify them
[52:33] through thy truth." Amen. Thy word is
[52:35] the truth. Amen. As thou hast sent me
[52:38] into the world, even also I have sent
[52:40] them into the world, and for their sakes
[52:43] I sanctify myself, that they also might
[52:46] be sanctified through the truth. Amen.
[52:48] Now, I love what the prophet said. He
[52:50] said, "You are a predestinated seed."
[52:53] Amen. Just like Christ was. Amen. What
[52:56] did Paul say? He said, "What fellowship
[52:59] can light have with darkness? What
[53:01] agreement can he that believeth have
[53:03] with an infidel?" Amen. What part, Amen,
[53:06] hath the righteous with the unrighteous?
[53:08] See, amen. You are in the world, but
[53:10] there is something that has come upon
[53:12] you that has brought a separation and
[53:15] has brought you back to your original
[53:17] identification. Listen, wherever Jesus
[53:20] went, Amen. He brought a separation. He
[53:23] didn't even open his mouth in some
[53:25] places and he brought a separation.
[53:27] Amen. It was because, oh, behind that
[53:30] flesh, he was carrying the genes of
[53:33] another world. And I want to tell you
[53:35] tonight, there is a reason you do not
[53:37] fit in this world. There is a reason
[53:39] that wherever you go, amen, the
[53:41] atmosphere changes around you. Is
[53:44] because you have been called and
[53:46] sanctified by the truth of the hour.
[53:49] Come on, church. You're not carrying the
[53:51] seat of just this world. You are
[53:53] carrying the realities of another world.
[53:56] Oh, let me say it as plain as I know
[53:58] how. I am in this world, but I am of
[54:01] another world. The real me is from
[54:03] another world. Yes, sir. The world I'm
[54:06] living in, you know what they want? They
[54:08] want mixers. The world I'm living in,
[54:11] they want to mix everything together.
[54:13] But the prophet of God said, he said,
[54:15] God wants separators.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Ain't that something? The world is
[54:20] wanting mixers, but God is wanting
[54:23] separators. See, God is a
[54:26] segregationalist. He said, "Sometimes
[54:28] when you meet God, it makes you act
[54:31] ridiculous to the outside world." He
[54:34] said, "You imagine Abraham went around
[54:36] testifying he was going to have a
[54:38] child." Amen. Now, come on, folks. Where
[54:40] did that come from? It didn't come from
[54:41] the local seminary. It didn't come from
[54:43] the local teacher. Amen. Abraham
[54:46] received a revelation [laughter] from
[54:47] another dimension. Amen. That you're
[54:50] going to have a son. And through the
[54:51] seed of that son, it's going to be the
[54:53] blessing of Abraham. old church. You
[54:56] know what the prophet said? He said
[54:58] Abraham's he said Sarah's milk veins
[55:00] were dried up [laughter] and Abraham's
[55:02] body was as good as dead. He said but he
[55:04] kept on testifying we're going to have
[55:06] that child. We're going to have that
[55:08] child. You know what happened? Brother
[55:10] Ram said he broke into another dimension
[55:13] and he saw Sarah holding the baby while
[55:16] her body was still in a frail condition.
[55:18] Listen, it don't matter what you're
[55:20] looking at right now. If you ever break
[55:22] out of this dimension into a reality
[55:25] where the power of God is, it'll open
[55:27] your eyes to an unseen world. Listen,
[55:29] I'm so tired of this sensebound
[55:32] existence. There is a reality to God.
[55:35] There is a presence of God that can ble
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It can take a believer from
[55:40] one dimension to another. When God calls
[55:43] a man, amen, he expects you to separate
[55:46] yourself from all unbelief. Amen.
[55:49] disassociates yourself, amen, from all
[55:52] things that's ungodly. Now, it's
[55:54] powerful. God is a segregationist,
[55:56] right? Amen. He called Israel out. He
[55:59] called his people out. He said the very
[56:02] word church means called out from that
[56:06] time 1961. God don't want his children
[56:10] mixed up with the world
[56:12] &gt;&gt; or the things of the world.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Identified masterpiece of God. He is
[56:18] trying to separate his church from the
[56:20] world. But the church wants to go on
[56:23] with the world. But his people is still
[56:26] segregated. Amen. To him, who is he? The
[56:30] word. My who do you say this is? He
[56:33] said, but still a real genuine Christian
[56:36] has to be a segregationist. He is
[56:40] separating himself from the things of
[56:42] the world and everything. Amen. To come
[56:45] into one purpose. And that purpose is
[56:48] Jesus Christ. Amen. Now I want to say
[56:50] this to you and I I want you to always
[56:53] remember this. Okay? Amen. There is a
[56:55] purpose behind a separation that God
[56:58] brings.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; If God bring if God brings the
[57:03] separation, there is a purpose behind
[57:06] that separation. You got sermons like
[57:08] the waters of separation. You got
[57:10] sermons like total separation from
[57:12] unbelief. You know what the prophet of
[57:14] God will show you? He will show you that
[57:17] separation, amen, is going from
[57:19] something unto something. So when you're
[57:22] separated, amen, God is not doing it to
[57:25] be mean to you. He's not doing it to be
[57:28] ugly to you. Amen. But he's bringing you
[57:30] from something into something. Now,
[57:32] Brother shows you the first Adam. He
[57:35] said he went from the word to go with
[57:37] his wife. He said, now this lukewarm
[57:39] carnal believer, he said they go from
[57:41] the word to the church. He said, "But
[57:43] there was a second Adam that was created
[57:46] in the womb of a woman who was born
[57:48] under a Nazerite vow." Listen. And he
[57:51] was separated from the world to the
[57:53] word. The first Adam went from the word
[57:56] to his wife. The lukewarm church member
[57:59] goes from the word to the church. But
[58:01] there was a second Adam. And if there is
[58:04] a second Adam, there's got to be a
[58:06] second Eve. And she's not going to go
[58:08] from this word to the world. She's going
[58:11] to leave the world and she's going to
[58:14] follow the word because she's not come
[58:16] from this world. She has come from
[58:19] another world.
[58:21] My when I think of it, Amen. I can tell
[58:23] you tonight there is a difference. There
[58:25] is a huge difference in being in the
[58:28] world and not of the world.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; I did some research on it. I want to
[58:33] read just a bit to you. It is often used
[58:35] in a religious spiritual context. It
[58:37] speaks of how amen that a person can
[58:40] live within society without being
[58:43] completely shaped or ruled by it. Amen.
[58:47] Now being in the world it means you are
[58:49] physically existing and you are actively
[58:53] participating in daily life. You live in
[58:56] society. You have relationships. You go
[58:59] to work. You experience emotion. You
[59:01] interact with culture and politics and
[59:03] economy. Listen, it's the reality of
[59:06] human life. We're here. We're embodied
[59:09] and affected by our environment. Listen,
[59:11] an example is you go to school, you go
[59:13] to work, or you use technology, you you
[59:16] make money, you deal with social issues.
[59:18] Listen, you are in the world and you are
[59:21] engaging with it.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; You're in the world and you're engaging
[59:27] with it, but you're not of the world.
[59:30] Now that means that you're not adopting
[59:33] the values, the priorities or the
[59:36] mindset of the dominant culture or
[59:39] system. It often implies that you have a
[59:42] resistance and then you are resisting
[59:45] materialism. You are resisting ego. You
[59:48] are resisting superficial success. I
[59:51] love this one. You are resisting moral
[59:53] compromise. Amen. I believe there's a
[59:56] bride on the earth today who is in this
[59:58] world. But see, it's the answer to the
[1:00:01] prayer of the great intercessor when he
[1:00:03] said, "Just as you sent me into the
[1:00:05] world and you sanctified me through the
[1:00:07] truth, I send them into the world. But
[1:00:10] father, keep them the same way you kept
[1:00:12] me. I want to put on notice every devil
[1:00:15] in hell tonight. There is a bride in the
[1:00:17] last days who will not bend. She will
[1:00:20] not pow. She will not compromise. She
[1:00:23] will not give up, shut up, turn around,
[1:00:25] or sit down. She knows who she is. She
[1:00:28] knows where she come from. She knows
[1:00:30] where she's going. Listen, you can throw
[1:00:32] everything you want to on us, but you
[1:00:34] don't have enough to stop us because we
[1:00:37] come from another world.
[1:00:41] [cheering]
[1:00:42] We have come from another world. Amen. I
[1:00:45] love this. You're not letting the
[1:00:47] world's standards define you.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Well, I might as well preach. You're not
[1:00:53] letting the world's standards define
[1:00:55] you. Amen. I love this. You are
[1:00:58] conscience but you're not a conformist.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are you are living with values
[1:01:03] and you're not just following trends.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Come on church. You got to know who you
[1:01:08] are or every wind that blows by will try
[1:01:11] to identify you.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; You got to know where you stand. You got
[1:01:15] to know what you believe.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Now you got to choose. You got to choose
[1:01:20] purpose over popularity.
[1:01:24] You got to choose depth over
[1:01:26] distraction.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Listen, we are not brought into this
[1:01:30] world to fit in.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; We were brought here to stand out. You
[1:01:34] say, "Well, the religion of Jesus Christ
[1:01:36] is not popular." Brother said, "It never
[1:01:38] will be popular." He said, "Because no
[1:01:40] man can serve two masters. Either he
[1:01:43] will have the one, hate the one, and
[1:01:45] love the other, or he will hold to the
[1:01:47] one, and despise the other." Listen what
[1:01:49] he said. That's what's the matter with
[1:01:51] people today. They don't want to get
[1:01:53] shut off from the world. They You want
[1:01:55] to be in contact with who's going to be
[1:01:57] the next most popular girl in California
[1:02:00] or in Hollywood and some of them married
[1:02:02] six and seven times. And you make that
[1:02:04] an example. You turn on your television
[1:02:07] at night to see what Mary or Suzie or
[1:02:09] every what they say. Amen. And stay home
[1:02:11] from a prayer meeting and then wondering
[1:02:13] why you can't hold out. Amen. You're not
[1:02:16] dead enough. He said you can't be too
[1:02:19] living at one time. You got to be dead
[1:02:21] to the world and alive in God or either
[1:02:25] dead to God and alive to the world.
[1:02:28] Listen, I believe God separated the
[1:02:30] church and the world. I believe God did
[1:02:32] that. Amen. I believe the church, it
[1:02:35] does not belong in the world and I don't
[1:02:37] believe the world belongs in the church.
[1:02:41] Is that okay? The world don't belong in
[1:02:43] the church and the church don't belong
[1:02:45] in the world. He said the world is
[1:02:48] looking for a church. He said, "I
[1:02:50] believe that God's church is an example
[1:02:52] to the world that we can live
[1:02:54] different." Ain't that something? We can
[1:02:56] act [laughter] different, we can be
[1:02:57] different. He said, "Now listen, you get
[1:02:59] right with God and you get acquainted
[1:03:02] with the heavenly things of that spirit
[1:03:04] that comes down from heaven." He said,
[1:03:07] "Now Jesus prayed for his church that
[1:03:09] they would not be of the world." See, I
[1:03:12] don't care. You're not an American.
[1:03:15] You're not a Swedish. You're not a
[1:03:17] European. you are a Christian.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Now, come on, folks. Either that's the
[1:03:22] truth or not, we are a Christian. And if
[1:03:25] you're a Christian, then your spirit is
[1:03:27] from affair. And so, it makes you live
[1:03:30] holy, want to be holy, want to act like
[1:03:33] Christ, act like God. And your whole
[1:03:35] desire is on heaven. And I am not a
[1:03:39] lukewarm, formal, intellectual, dry
[1:03:41] Christian. I am a son of God. I wasn't
[1:03:44] born in the smoke. I'll choke to death.
[1:03:47] I was born in the fire where the Holy
[1:03:49] Ghost burns.
[1:03:51] [cheering]
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. Amen. I know what that
[1:03:54] intellectual devil's trying to do. He's
[1:03:56] trying to crawl up out of the pits of
[1:03:57] hell and and paralyze the praise of
[1:04:00] God's people and paralyze
[1:04:01] [clears throat] the worship of God's
[1:04:03] people. [laughter] But there ain't a I
[1:04:05] might as well preach. With every bit of
[1:04:07] strength I got in my body, I can't stand
[1:04:10] that old ungodly, cold, formal devil
[1:04:13] [laughter] that robs the people of God
[1:04:16] from enjoying the realities of what they
[1:04:19] are believing. [cheering]
[1:04:22] I think it's time to kick that devil out
[1:04:23] of the house of God and let the power of
[1:04:26] God return. Let the worship of God
[1:04:28] return. I'm sorry. I don't worship like
[1:04:31] the world because I come from another
[1:04:34] world.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I don't dress like the world.
[1:04:39] I don't talk like the world. Amen. It's
[1:04:41] a spiritual dress I'm wearing. It's the
[1:04:43] wedding garment and it's already been
[1:04:45] put on you. Then let me say to you
[1:04:48] tonight, either you're going to accept
[1:04:49] the revelation or not. You are an
[1:04:52] oddball.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Mson, I think any born again
[1:04:58] Christian is an oddball. Amen to the
[1:05:00] world because you've been changed.
[1:05:02] [laughter]
[1:05:03] Oh, I can't I can't read that quote
[1:05:04] without faking. I was a little I was a
[1:05:06] little boy and there was a brother come
[1:05:07] by the church there where I grew up and
[1:05:09] he come in there and he got to singing.
[1:05:11] His name was Brother Morning. He got in
[1:05:12] there one day and he got to singing.
[1:05:14] I've been changed. I've been to the
[1:05:16] river and I've been baptized. I've been
[1:05:19] changed. And I'll tell you the
[1:05:21] difference in what a man knows and what
[1:05:22] a man has experienced. A man knows it
[1:05:25] can sing about it. But a man that's
[1:05:27] experienced it, when he begins to talk
[1:05:29] about it, the same reality that come
[1:05:31] upon him begins to burn again. Oh, I say
[1:05:34] to you tonight, it's time to realize
[1:05:37] that the spirit that's in you has not
[1:05:40] come from a man. It has not come from a
[1:05:42] church. It has not come from an apostle.
[1:05:45] It has come from heaven to identify you
[1:05:49] as a citizen of a better country.
[1:05:52] Now, I'm not trying to be mean here, but
[1:05:56] I got to say what the prophet said. He
[1:05:58] said, "There's something wrong. You're
[1:05:59] still too earthbound. You ought to be
[1:06:02] heavenly minded." And heaven lives by
[1:06:06] the word.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Now, what does heaven live by? Heaven
[1:06:10] lives by the word. Now, I love this.
[1:06:12] Then, when this separate place is spoke
[1:06:14] of that you've been called into, Amen.
[1:06:17] Denomination is not the separate place.
[1:06:20] Brother B said denomination is a launch.
[1:06:22] He said it's not a church. Amen. Don't
[1:06:25] you associate the two together. Listen,
[1:06:27] the separate place is the word. The
[1:06:30] church is a bunch of bornagain believers
[1:06:33] that's in Christ by the Holy Ghost and
[1:06:36] they are led by the spirit of God.
[1:06:39] They're not of the world. They are out
[1:06:41] of the world. They are different from
[1:06:43] the world. That's what makes them what
[1:06:46] they are.
[1:06:48] Then I can say to you tonight as the
[1:06:50] bride of Christ, you are not going to
[1:06:52] the judgment. You have already been
[1:06:55] judged
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; by the word. The word is the judge. It
[1:07:01] don't matter what I think or what
[1:07:03] anybody else thinks. The word is still
[1:07:06] the red light. The word is still the
[1:07:08] absolute. The word is still the one that
[1:07:11] determines your going or your staying.
[1:07:13] He said when we are judged by the word
[1:07:15] which is Christ, he said we are
[1:07:17] chassened that we should not be
[1:07:20] condemned with the world. My when when
[1:07:23] when we begin to think about this, I
[1:07:25] think of how Amen. that we are we're all
[1:07:27] the time Amen. referring to the world,
[1:07:30] aren't we? Amen. They went back to the
[1:07:32] world or they never left the world or
[1:07:34] they're still in the world. We're all
[1:07:35] the time referring
[1:07:38] to the world. But but but I want to say
[1:07:40] this to you. Amen. What is the world?
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram asked that question. He
[1:07:46] says, "What is the world?" Now, what I
[1:07:48] love about it is when he asked that
[1:07:50] question, he automatically connects that
[1:07:53] question to St. John the [music] 14th
[1:07:55] chapter and the 19th verse. And he says,
[1:07:58] "Now, yet a little while and the world
[1:08:01] will see me no more,
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; but ye shall see me because I live ye
[1:08:08] shall live also." Now, watch this. He
[1:08:10] says what is the world? It's the Greek
[1:08:13] word cosmos which means the world order.
[1:08:17] He says I will be in you. I will be with
[1:08:20] you even in you until the end of the
[1:08:24] world. Now come on saints. Amen. I will
[1:08:28] be in you. Amen. Even in you until the
[1:08:32] end of the world. Then I can tell you
[1:08:35] tonight that that there's another world
[1:08:37] that is coming to this world.
[1:08:40] And that's what separated you from the
[1:08:43] world that you're in. He said, "Now what
[1:08:45] was it?" The people who could only see
[1:08:47] with their natural sight, could
[1:08:48] understand, with their natural
[1:08:50] understanding, with their mental
[1:08:51] thinking. He said, "That is the end of
[1:08:55] Jesus forever for them until the
[1:08:58] judgment." You say, "Preacher, I ain't
[1:08:59] got nothing to be shouting about." Yes,
[1:09:01] you do. Amen. that God has allowed you,
[1:09:04] amen, to live in a world where the
[1:09:07] people have been blinded by the God of
[1:09:09] this evil age and they will not see God
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; again until the judgment. Amen. I want
[1:09:17] to say something to you. He said, "Then
[1:09:19] what is the world?" He said, "It's the
[1:09:21] worldly minded." See? Amen. Now, who are
[1:09:24] the worldly minded people? I just got to
[1:09:26] say what Brother Bam said. He said,
[1:09:28] "It's the church members.
[1:09:34] The worldlyminded people, he says, "The
[1:09:37] church members will see me no more." Did
[1:09:41] they see him in that day? No sir. They
[1:09:44] never seen him in the light of who he
[1:09:47] was. They seen his corporal body because
[1:09:50] they had a sense of sight. those who
[1:09:53] could see. He said, "Now listen, they
[1:09:55] saw him in the light that he was a human
[1:09:58] being, but they did not see him in the
[1:10:01] light of the son of God." Cuz they said
[1:10:03] he was a devil. They said he was be
[1:10:05] elim. They said he was a fortune teller.
[1:10:08] He said, "Now what does that world
[1:10:10] represent? What is the world order?" He
[1:10:13] said, "Here it is. It's the regular
[1:10:15] routine."
[1:10:18] So the worldlyminded people are the
[1:10:21] church members who are a part of the
[1:10:24] world order. And what is the world
[1:10:26] order? It's the regular routine. Now you
[1:10:29] know what he says that is? He says go to
[1:10:31] church on Sunday, go to work on Monday,
[1:10:34] and go back next Sunday. That's the
[1:10:36] world order.
[1:10:40] The world order is people who go to
[1:10:42] church on Sunday, go to work on Monday,
[1:10:45] go back to church on Sunday. He said
[1:10:47] they shall see me no more. You say, "See
[1:10:50] me?" Yes, sir. Well, Brother Bam, I've
[1:10:52] got eyesight 2020. But you're still
[1:10:54] blind. They will see me no more. Look
[1:10:58] here. That's But listen, but there was
[1:11:00] another group of people. Amen. There was
[1:11:02] a world that was under a world order
[1:11:05] that will not [laughter] see him no
[1:11:06] more. He said, "But yet ye,
[1:11:10] ye shall see me." He said, "That's the
[1:11:14] elected church."
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. The elected
[1:11:20] church are the ones who will see him. If
[1:11:23] you were of the world, the world would
[1:11:26] love his own. But because ye are not of
[1:11:29] the world, but I have chosen you.
[1:11:33] I have electtos. I have elected you. I
[1:11:37] have picked you. I have chosen you out
[1:11:39] of the world. Look at this word chosen.
[1:11:41] It is of God choosing whom he judged fit
[1:11:45] to receive his favors. Glory. When God
[1:11:48] chose you, he judged you. He He judged
[1:11:52] you qualified to receive his favors. and
[1:11:55] he's separated from the rest of mankind
[1:11:58] to be a peculiar to his own to be
[1:12:01] attended continually by his gracious
[1:12:04] oversight. Oh, I want to tell you
[1:12:06] tonight, Amen, the president of the
[1:12:08] United States is not, Amen, the safest
[1:12:11] man on the earth. Amen. Your government
[1:12:14] is not the safest people on the earth,
[1:12:16] but the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:12:19] Hey. Well, glory to God. Come on,
[1:12:22] church. I'm not talking about secret
[1:12:24] service. I'm talking about God's
[1:12:26] service. I'm talking about election. I'm
[1:12:29] talking about grace. I'm talking about
[1:12:31] God chose you
[1:12:33] and he's watching over you.
[1:12:38] Oh, [screaming] you ought to rejoice on
[1:12:39] that. That the God of heaven has chose
[1:12:42] you. And because God chose you, this
[1:12:46] world hates you. Because God chose you,
[1:12:49] this world hates you. Man's choice is a
[1:12:52] lot different from God's choice.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; You know that. Brother said this. He
[1:12:57] said, "Sometimes your choice is not
[1:12:59] God's choice."
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; You know what else he said? He said,
[1:13:04] "Sometimes the church's choice is not
[1:13:08] God's choice. But if God elected you to
[1:13:11] be a Christian, you would not be a
[1:13:14] Christian if he hadn't. [laughter]
[1:13:15] It's God's choice, not yours."
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Well, can I get it out there? You didn't
[1:13:21] claim this message.
[1:13:24] This message claimed you.
[1:13:27] You didn't claim this grace. This grace
[1:13:30] claimed you. You did not claim this
[1:13:33] revelation. This revelation claimed you.
[1:13:36] No man seeks God at any time. It wasn't
[1:13:40] you looking for God. It wasn't you
[1:13:42] calling for God. It was God calling for
[1:13:45] you.
[1:13:48] Come on, church. I will go and prepare a
[1:13:51] place and I will return again and will
[1:13:53] receive you unto myself that where I am
[1:13:57] there you may be also.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Do you see it? In this world of
[1:14:02] spiritual blindness we were elected to
[1:14:05] see.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Now that ought to make you put your
[1:14:09] shouting shoes on. In this world of
[1:14:11] blindness we were elected to see. You
[1:14:14] say me? Yes you. Brother said he only
[1:14:17] appears to those who believe him and
[1:14:20] love him and was elected to see him.
[1:14:25] If you have seen him in the appearing of
[1:14:28] his presence in this hour, you are the
[1:14:30] most blessed person on the island of
[1:14:32] Trinidad tonight to know that God has
[1:14:35] elected you out of the billions of
[1:14:38] people upon the face of the earth to
[1:14:40] receive him and his visitation in the
[1:14:43] generation in the hour that you're
[1:14:45] living in.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, you say I'm going to shout. Listen,
[1:14:49] [laughter] if you don't like my
[1:14:50] shouting, I'm sorry. I got something to
[1:14:53] shout about. If you don't like the fact
[1:14:56] I dance a little bit, I got something to
[1:14:58] dance about. I was lost. I was undone. I
[1:15:02] was on my way to hell. But God sent a
[1:15:05] message and opened my eyes and let me
[1:15:08] see him.
[1:15:10] I didn't see the pope. I didn't see a
[1:15:13] bishop. I saw Jesus Christ the same
[1:15:16] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:15:22] I see him in nature. I see him in his
[1:15:25] son. I see him in his people. I see him
[1:15:28] in his word. [cheering]
[1:15:34] Oh, I didn't see what the world sees. I
[1:15:37] see what I've been elected to see.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Why didn't those Egyptians see Moses?
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Come on. Why didn't those Egyptians see
[1:15:47] Moses? They weren't elected.
[1:15:52] He said, "That's the reason they didn't
[1:15:53] see it." But why did those Israelites
[1:15:56] see it?
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; They were elected to see it.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; And today,
[1:16:02] God is calling his elected,
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; the spiritual seed of Abraham
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; by the faith that he had in the word of
[1:16:10] God.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you something? Tonight,
[1:16:13] Abraham's faith is not dead, saints.
[1:16:18] Brother, brother Andrew, I can stand
[1:16:19] here tonight and say it. The faith of
[1:16:21] Abraham is not dead. You say, "Preacher,
[1:16:23] how can you say that? Abraham is not in
[1:16:25] this building, but his faith is
[1:16:30] Abraham is not here in a physical body,
[1:16:33] but the same faith that was in him is in
[1:16:36] every believer
[1:16:38] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost." I'm
[1:16:41] not talking about a bunch of religion.
[1:16:44] I'm talking about the revelation that
[1:16:46] has struck this generation.
[1:16:49] It's not a bunch of mysteries. It's not
[1:16:51] a bunch of, well, you got to go dig
[1:16:52] around and find it for yourself. This is
[1:16:54] a thus sayaith the Lord revelation. This
[1:16:56] is a clear revelation. It's an
[1:16:59] identifying revelation identifying you
[1:17:01] for the rapture. [cheering]
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Don't you see the spiritual scene?
[1:17:11] Now, now
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; this is brother Brandham
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; that don't see the intellectual church.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; It sees the word.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Now, I believe in teaching.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; I believe in teaching.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; But I believe in inspired teaching.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Can I preach a little bit?
[1:17:37] I mean, I tell you, anything I can't
[1:17:39] take is somebody knocking the move of
[1:17:41] God.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; When a man is preaching this message,
[1:17:47] there's no music playing. There's nobody
[1:17:49] rah. Come on. Come on. And it brings a
[1:17:51] stimulation of revelation in the church.
[1:17:54] And then somebody get up and start
[1:17:55] knocking it and calling it a bunch of
[1:17:57] emotion and a bunch of bubble dancing.
[1:18:00] Now, I might as well just say it. You
[1:18:02] know, you know what we've really done
[1:18:03] around here around the message rather is
[1:18:05] we've taken every six-foot icicle that
[1:18:07] couldn't preach and called him a
[1:18:09] teacher.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; And they've taught the Holy Ghost right
[1:18:13] out of the church. They've taught the
[1:18:15] realities of God right out of the
[1:18:17] church. They've taught the power of God
[1:18:19] right out of the church. But if a man is
[1:18:21] a Holy Ghost called teacher, he will not
[1:18:23] be teaching against what God has
[1:18:26] restored under the voice of a seventh
[1:18:28] angel.
[1:18:30] He will be saying only what the prophet
[1:18:33] has already said. [screaming]
[1:18:36] I might as well just preach I'm here. I
[1:18:38] might as well preach I'm here. Amen. Do
[1:18:40] you realize there's two scriptures in
[1:18:41] the Bible? It's Matthew 28:19 and it's
[1:18:44] Acts the 2 chapter. You know what
[1:18:46] Matthew 28 says? Go ye into all the
[1:18:49] world. Baptize in the name of the
[1:18:52] Father, of the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:54] Amen. In Acts 2:38, it says, "Repent and
[1:18:57] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:18:59] Jesus Christ, and you shall receive the
[1:19:02] gift of the Holy Ghost." Now, do you
[1:19:04] realize what men have done? There were
[1:19:07] no contradiction between those two
[1:19:09] scriptures until a man got involved.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, God, I might as well shall preach.
[1:19:16] Until a man got involved and he be to
[1:19:19] pitch or put Matthew against Acts and
[1:19:22] say, "What are you going to believe?"
[1:19:23] Amen. Now, let me bring it right on down
[1:19:25] to our message.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Is that okay? We got quotes like this. I
[1:19:29] would rather have a little wildfire than
[1:19:31] no fire at all.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; We got quotes that says anything without
[1:19:36] emotion is dead. Come on. Amen. We got
[1:19:39] quotes like this. If you ain't what you
[1:19:41] got ain't got some emotion in it, it
[1:19:43] needs to be buried.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Right. And then we got quotes like this
[1:19:47] that Mary received the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:19:50] without s or she brought the word
[1:19:52] without sensation. Right? Amen. We got
[1:19:54] quotes like this. We need to get out of
[1:19:56] order long enough to get say are are you
[1:19:58] seeing what I'm saying? And there was no
[1:20:00] contradiction between the quotes until a
[1:20:03] man be to try to bring a separation.
[1:20:08] And they begin to say, "Well, I'm on the
[1:20:10] emotional side and you're on the word
[1:20:12] side." Amen. That's the dumbest thing.
[1:20:14] I'm sorry. I'm sorry, brother. My
[1:20:16] country ways are coming out. Amen.
[1:20:18] That's the silliest thing I've ever
[1:20:19] heard. Amen. Are you on the fire side or
[1:20:22] you on the word side? Come on. You can't
[1:20:24] even have a service. Without the spirit
[1:20:26] of God and the word of God, [cheering]
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; when in God's name did we start
[1:20:31] separating, Amen. the spirit of God from
[1:20:34] the word of God. I'll tell you when we
[1:20:36] done it is when we replace the
[1:20:38] leadership [laughter] of the seventh
[1:20:40] angel with the ideas of a man. But I
[1:20:43] stand here tonight as an anointed
[1:20:45] Josiah. I say tear down every idol and
[1:20:48] lift up the message again until the
[1:20:50] power of the reality begins to burn in
[1:20:54] every young person in every heart.
[1:20:57] Set us on fire, Lord. Set us on fire.
[1:21:01] [screaming] Not with a bunch of
[1:21:02] wildfire, with the Holy Ghost and fire.
[1:21:06] [cheering]
[1:21:09] I'm sorry. I'm just preaching.
[1:21:17] No, you sh
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; I'm not confused. I know what I believe.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; I'm not a fanatic. I'm a [screaming]
[1:21:25] Holy Ghost filled fire baptized Malachi
[1:21:29] for following dinner of fire following
[1:21:32] son of the living God. And there ain't
[1:21:34] no devil going to set me up. And there
[1:21:36] ain't no devil going to reidentify me.
[1:21:41] I know in whom I have believed.
[1:21:46] [cheering]
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; You want some emotion? Preach the
[1:21:52] message.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Now I'm I'm moving on. I'm sorry.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of that devil. [cheering]
[1:22:06] Tired of that devil that runs around
[1:22:07] with a hand with a with a printer in his
[1:22:09] hand just printing out labels.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Just a just a printer just printing out
[1:22:15] labels. Oh, well, he's this and she's
[1:22:17] that, he's this and she
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; You ain't got no right to identify me.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; The word is my identification.
[1:22:27] [applause]
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Well, he read that quote, so he must be
[1:22:31] that. He read that quote, he must be
[1:22:33] that. I read it because I'm a message
[1:22:35] believer.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; I remember I I don't know. I'm I'm I'm
[1:22:43] running out of time, but I'm here.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brothers. I I was over I was
[1:22:48] over in a in a meeting one time and and
[1:22:50] there was a lady and man, every time you
[1:22:52] was preaching the word, man, she get
[1:22:53] happy. She'd jump up and she'd run up to
[1:22:55] the front of the church and shake your
[1:22:56] hand. It might be dead quiet in there
[1:22:59] and all of a sudden you just preaching
[1:23:00] the message and the power of God and
[1:23:02] that woman stand up on the front row and
[1:23:03] she say, "Amen." [screaming]
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; And then she had a little walk, brother.
[1:23:08] She walk up there and shake your hand.
[1:23:10] [laughter]
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; So I was with a guy. He got to talk to
[1:23:14] me about that. He said, "You know what?"
[1:23:15] He said, "That gets on my nerves."
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; I said, "Really?" He said, "Yeah." He
[1:23:20] said, "She's just an emotionalist."
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, have have you ever went
[1:23:25] and talked to her?
[1:23:27] Well, no. I said, "Have you ever talked
[1:23:30] to her and realized that she used to not
[1:23:32] be like that?
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; But one day she was in a car wreck and
[1:23:36] she almost lost her life and God raised
[1:23:38] her up off of the sick bed and give her
[1:23:40] back her life. And every time she hears
[1:23:43] the word, she wants to take that chance
[1:23:45] to bless the God of Abraham who restored
[1:23:48] unto her her life." Come on. I think
[1:23:50] it's time as believers we get back to
[1:23:53] identifying ourselves by the message and
[1:23:55] not what people think about us and what
[1:23:57] people say about us. [cheering]
[1:24:01] Well, somebody shout hallelujah. I am a
[1:24:04] believer because I met God. I met the
[1:24:07] God of this message.
[1:24:12] And the revelation I begin to feed on it
[1:24:15] begin to bring a separation. Now, I'm
[1:24:17] sorry. I got to move on. The prophet of
[1:24:18] God said this. He said, "What's
[1:24:20] happening?" He said, "It's being called
[1:24:22] from those big denominations into the
[1:24:25] presence of Jesus Christ." He said, "Now
[1:24:28] remember this election, this election
[1:24:29] that you've got is coming now is just
[1:24:33] not going to another nation.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; It's going to glory
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; where their names are wrote on the
[1:24:45] lamb's book of life."
[1:24:47] Now, their names were put on the lamb's
[1:24:50] book of life before the foundation of
[1:24:53] the world
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; and they're in there and they are in
[1:24:57] there elected.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; And when what light flashes over them
[1:25:01] like that, then denominational walls
[1:25:04] drop away from them and here they come.
[1:25:08] See, how could a thorn wake up and be
[1:25:10] official when it was predestinated to be
[1:25:13] that? How could the elected keep from
[1:25:15] seeing it? They were elected to see it.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Their names were not on a church
[1:25:21] recorder, but on the lamb's book of
[1:25:25] life.
[1:25:28] [applause]
[1:25:29] They were elected to see the revelation
[1:25:33] of the age. Now, I want to say this.
[1:25:35] It's the revelation of predestination
[1:25:39] and election. Predestination.
[1:25:42] We are predestinated unto adoption. Now
[1:25:46] I want to say this to you.
[1:25:48] Predestination leads unto an adoption
[1:25:51] which is an authority. Now I want to
[1:25:54] bring it on down to you. The leotans
[1:25:57] which are Pentecostals, they cannot see
[1:25:59] it.
[1:26:03] But only the bride which has the entire
[1:26:06] Bible seed swed into her heart will be
[1:26:10] able to see the revelation.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Now I pray I've got some liberty here
[1:26:15] tonight. I want to bring it on down to
[1:26:17] you. We are in Leosa,
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; but we are not of
[1:26:30] [applause]
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. You want to preach a bride a
[1:26:32] just preach it the way William Brandham
[1:26:33] did. We are in Leotaa. We are not of
[1:26:37] [screaming] Leotaa. Why? We are the
[1:26:40] bride. Come on church. Leotaa is not our
[1:26:44] identification.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Leotaa is not my identification.
[1:26:49] [laughter] I'm going to go to the
[1:26:50] airport in the morning and fly home.
[1:26:52] Okay. I got a passport. Amen. I think my
[1:26:54] I I've got a passport. And if I take
[1:26:56] that passport up there and I hand it,
[1:26:59] [laughter] amen, to the to the to the to
[1:27:01] the immigration officer. Now listen,
[1:27:03] what's on that passport has got to match
[1:27:07] what's standing in flesh before him.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Now, no matter how much me and brother
[1:27:17] Theo look alike,
[1:27:22] [laughter]
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; I can't take his passport up there.
[1:27:26] Now, now come on, folks. If I hand them
[1:27:28] a passport and the passport says 63,
[1:27:31] that's what's got to be standing in
[1:27:33] front of them.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; If I hand them the passport and it says
[1:27:36] 200 and none of your business pounds,
[1:27:40] that's what's got to be on the passport.
[1:27:43] Whatever. Oh, God. Whatever is on the
[1:27:47] passport has what's got to be in flesh.
[1:27:50] [cheering]
[1:27:51] Whatever is on the passport has got to
[1:27:54] be manifested in the flesh. The passport
[1:27:57] and the flesh has got to say the same
[1:28:00] thing. Or I hear brother Brandham say
[1:28:02] it's so beautiful. He said the spirit,
[1:28:05] the prophet and the bride will be all
[1:28:07] saying the same thing and what they say
[1:28:11] will have already been said.
[1:28:15] Well, glory to God that I can say it
[1:28:18] tonight without any hesitation. Lelay
[1:28:21] Osea is not our identification.
[1:28:24] I'm not blind. [laughter] I'm not
[1:28:26] wretched. I'm not miserable. I'm not
[1:28:29] poor.
[1:28:32] I'm not wondering who I am. [screaming]
[1:28:34] I know who I am. [applause and cheering]
[1:28:41] They told me I was at home to preach.
[1:28:43] So, I'm just going to preach.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Ben said the Pentecostals is the
[1:28:47] way ought to see it.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; They're rich
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; and have need of nothing.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Turn on the light. 1964. He says the
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; pick that devil up. It's not a good time
[1:29:01] to push. We get back to saying what
[1:29:04] Brother Brandham said and quit saying
[1:29:05] what somebody said about what he said,
[1:29:07] we'd be a lot better off.
[1:29:11] Leoa is the Pentecostal organization
[1:29:15] which all goes right straight in to the
[1:29:18] mark of the beast.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; That's not who I am. This naked stripped
[1:29:23] off bunch of layout of sins worshiping
[1:29:26] the God of this world through ethics,
[1:29:28] education, and shrewdness. That's not
[1:29:30] who I am. So if I'm here, I've got to be
[1:29:34] a part of something. Oh, there was
[1:29:36] another voice and it said this. Babylon
[1:29:40] is fallen, but come out of [screaming]
[1:29:42] her.
[1:29:45] Come out of her, my people. Now, you
[1:29:47] know, Brother Bam said it. He said, "I'm
[1:29:49] calling you out." He said, "But if I'm
[1:29:51] taking you out, where am I going to take
[1:29:53] you?" He said, "I can't bring you into
[1:29:56] tabernacle." He said, "It's as much a
[1:29:58] mess as the rest of them." He said, "I
[1:30:00] can't take you to the Baptist. I can't
[1:30:02] take you to the Pentecostal." He said,
[1:30:03] "Oh, there is a place I can take you. in
[1:30:06] Christ who is the word.
[1:30:10] Well, take that devil. I am in Christ
[1:30:14] and there is therefore now no
[1:30:16] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:30:20] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:30:23] the spirit. Where is that spirit coming
[1:30:25] from? Another world
[1:30:30] come out of her is the message of the
[1:30:32] hour. God sent a messenger and a
[1:30:34] messenger was sent from heaven to call
[1:30:37] God's people out of Babylon.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Now, can you take a prophet's words?
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; I know you can't.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; May they realize that this is the
[1:30:48] calling out of the bride.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; It's not a Pentecostal message.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal message was to restore
[1:30:57] the gifts back in the church. But this
[1:31:00] is the calling forth of the bride.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Somebody say another message
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; that was to come just before Sodom was
[1:31:10] to be burned.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Now he says this faith I believe this
[1:31:16] because it's revealed by your spirit
[1:31:19] through the word of God and has been
[1:31:22] vindicated and made manifest to the
[1:31:25] whole world. I I think it's amazing that
[1:31:27] people all of a sudden have got a
[1:31:28] problem with the picture of the cloud
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden it's wrong and it's
[1:31:33] false and and this this this theorist
[1:31:36] and this scientist. Amen. Oh god, I got
[1:31:38] to it's my first trip here. I got to
[1:31:40] behave myself.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; I'm trying.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Hogwash
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; nonsense.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said that light that was
[1:31:50] in the cloud is what brought you the
[1:31:52] revelation.
[1:31:56] Who is this Melzdc? Now look here. So
[1:31:58] then what you're receiving is not the
[1:32:01] mind of a man.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; You're receiving the unfailing body word
[1:32:07] of the son of man.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Now look here then. The leotans are
[1:32:12] after the world order.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; I had a reason I wanted you to sing that
[1:32:17] song. The leotans are after the world
[1:32:20] order. Now I want you to hear a
[1:32:22] prophet's words. He says this the end of
[1:32:26] the leotans
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; they went back to works again or
[1:32:32] Pentecostal denomination and went back
[1:32:34] to the denomination in the for seal. He
[1:32:37] says the last plague that hits the
[1:32:40] Pentecostal church is spiritual death.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; She is dead. That's in the name of the
[1:32:46] Lord. She is spiritually dead. He gave
[1:32:49] her a place to repent. She rejected it.
[1:32:51] Now she is dead. Will you take what he
[1:32:54] said? She will never rise again.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; The end of the layout of sins. She is
[1:33:02] dead. She will never rise again. He says
[1:33:05] an invisible union. He says God let it
[1:33:08] die.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; But folks, I'm sorry. I can't find
[1:33:12] myself in there.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; So he separated us.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; He called us out from that.
[1:33:21] So, what's he going to take us to?
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, he says this. Now, turn in your
[1:33:29] Bibles to Hebrews 7.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; There was a world order. [clears throat]
[1:33:37] He says, "But listen, there's another
[1:33:39] order.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; The Leoans have an end. They're dead.
[1:33:45] She'll never rise again. But there's
[1:33:48] another order." And here's what it says.
[1:33:51] without father, without mother. Melzdc,
[1:33:54] without descent, having neither
[1:33:56] beginning of days. Are you all ready for
[1:33:58] this? Nor end of life.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; You can't die no more than God can.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Oh [screaming] yeah, they made buried
[1:34:08] this body in the ground. They only
[1:34:10] planted it for the resurrection.
[1:34:13] Are you hearing me? Because on the
[1:34:15] inside of this 16 element body, I am
[1:34:19] carrying the revelation of Melzdc.
[1:34:21] [laughter]
[1:34:22] And the order of Melzdc is the order of
[1:34:26] which I'm a part of.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to say something to you
[1:34:33] tonight. Okay?
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; The end of Leos
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; shall never rise again.
[1:34:42] Brother, brother Theo, he says, "But
[1:34:44] Melzdc had no end of life."
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; I got to looking at this word end. You
[1:34:51] know what it means? It means the end.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; The last
[1:34:58] that by which a thing is finished,
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; it's Oh, God.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; It's closed.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; It's done.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; It's ended. Yes.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Now, I got a question for you, okay? Are
[1:35:13] you awake?
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; How many things has you have you been
[1:35:18] through and the devil said, "This is
[1:35:20] your end."
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; He has said, "This is your end.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; You're finished.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; You're done for. You're over. You'll
[1:35:34] never rise again."
[1:35:39] But you're still here. [cheering]
[1:35:43] [applause]
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:35:48] The devil has thrown everything he's got
[1:35:50] at you and you're still standing.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Can I just go ahead and tell you it's
[1:35:57] because the devil don't have enough.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; He don't have enough to end this pride.
[1:36:03] He don't have enough to hold this bride
[1:36:05] down. She is not after the order of
[1:36:08] Leosa. She is after the order of Melzdc.
[1:36:13] My when I think of this tonight, he said
[1:36:15] to that same Melzdc is right here alive
[1:36:17] tonight. He said he is the same
[1:36:19] yesterday, today, and forever. He was
[1:36:22] made flesh. He would repeat again. I
[1:36:24] want to say something to you tonight.
[1:36:26] And and I'm I'm hurrying, but I want to
[1:36:28] deliver my heart to you.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; You're in this age of leosia. Yeah,
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; you're not of it.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; There's a reason you're different.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham introduces us to
[1:36:42] this idea. He says, "There's two
[1:36:44] worlds."
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Is this okay?
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, it's a dual condition."
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; All right. All right.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; He'll say it like this. You're working
[1:36:55] in two worlds.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; I love these quotes. You don't realize,
[1:36:59] friend, what a strain. You're living in
[1:37:01] two worlds at the same time.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Another place. It's another world. You
[1:37:07] live in two worlds. There's no need of
[1:37:10] trying to explain it because you just
[1:37:12] can't explain him. You just have to
[1:37:15] believe it. Another one. Why? I'm a holy
[1:37:17] roller. Fitting title, right? You're in
[1:37:19] a dimension that the world knows nothing
[1:37:22] about.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; At thy word. 54. In other words, a
[1:37:27] vision causes you to be in two worlds at
[1:37:31] the same time. Jesus hold the authority
[1:37:33] of the word. He said you are living in
[1:37:36] two worlds. This is my favorite one,
[1:37:38] brother Isaac. He says you are here and
[1:37:41] then you're in another world. Are you
[1:37:43] all ready for this? And you can't help
[1:37:46] it.
[1:37:50] You're here in this world, but you're in
[1:37:53] another world, and you can't help it.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, I say it like this. He says, "Jesus
[1:38:00] is here. His spirit is here. Now, what
[1:38:03] just happened? I went into another
[1:38:05] world." Are you ready for this? It's an
[1:38:08] unseen world.
[1:38:12] [applause and cheering]
[1:38:14] It's an unseen world. We become so
[1:38:17] conscious of looking at one another like
[1:38:19] this. But there's an unseen world and
[1:38:22] it's greater than anything you can see.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Come on church. What other revelation
[1:38:29] outside of the revelation of Melzdc
[1:38:33] unlocked to the church that there's
[1:38:35] another dimension and you're a part of
[1:38:37] that dimension. You have a dual
[1:38:40] citizenship. You're in a dual condition.
[1:38:43] You're in two [screaming] worlds at the
[1:38:45] same time. [cheering]
[1:38:47] There is no other message. There is no
[1:38:50] other revelation, brother Paul. There is
[1:38:52] no other word that can transform this
[1:38:54] bride while she's still living into
[1:38:57] another dimension to receive a grace
[1:39:00] from God but the message of the hour.
[1:39:07] Oh, I feel my strength coming on right
[1:39:08] now. I feel my strength coming on right
[1:39:12] now. I want to tell every devil in hell,
[1:39:14] I'm stronger than I've ever been before.
[1:39:17] My flesh might be weak. My spirit might
[1:39:20] be low, but I am in contact by the
[1:39:23] revelation of another world.
[1:39:27] And it's more real than anything I can
[1:39:30] see here. It's more valuable than
[1:39:33] anything I have here. It's more pure
[1:39:35] than anything Leotaa can produce.
[1:39:43] I'm not a crazy man. We're bumping into
[1:39:45] something right now. It's another
[1:39:47] dimension.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; It's a supernatural world.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Now, can I say what a prophet said?
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "The angels of God are gathered
[1:39:57] here."
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; How many knows the spirit of the prophet
[1:40:01] is subject to the prophets?
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; The angels of God are here.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Christ is here.
[1:40:13] Can I just say it?
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; You've got angelic security.
[1:40:22] [cheering]
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; You are protected by angels. Come on,
[1:40:25] folks. I'm not a fanatic. I'm a message
[1:40:27] believer.
[1:40:29] You know what the prophet said? He said,
[1:40:31] "There's an angel to bring you to your
[1:40:32] seat."
[1:40:35] Glory to God. He said, "You're bumping
[1:40:37] into something." He said, "What are you
[1:40:39] feeling? You're feeling angels." Listen.
[1:40:42] The angels of God have been dispatched
[1:40:45] into this building tonight to minister
[1:40:47] to those who are the heirs of salvation.
[1:40:50] I say, "House of hell, turn loose in the
[1:40:53] name of Jesus Christ. There is more with
[1:40:55] us than there is with them." [cheering]
[1:40:59] Hallelujah. There is more with us than
[1:41:02] there is with them. There is a host of
[1:41:05] angelic beings that have been brought
[1:41:07] into this building. Not by the music,
[1:41:09] not by singing, but by the preaching of
[1:41:12] the message of the hour.
[1:41:17] [applause]
[1:41:17] I'm not a crazy man. There's an angel
[1:41:20] influencing this meeting.
[1:41:24] You know what angel's influencing this
[1:41:26] meeting? Is the angel of the Lord.
[1:41:30] Come on, church. The angel of the Lord
[1:41:32] is influencing this meeting.
[1:41:36] You say, "Preacher, you lost your mind."
[1:41:38] Wherever this message is preached, the
[1:41:40] angel of the Lord, direct quote,
[1:41:42] accompanies the message always.
[1:41:48] Come on, church. Feast of trumpets.
[1:41:52] I'm just preaching the message to you.
[1:41:54] In the Feast of Trumpets, you know what
[1:41:57] a prophet said? You know what he said in
[1:41:59] Feast of Trumpets? He said, "Out of the
[1:42:00] river Euphrates," he said, "Come them
[1:42:02] ecumenical demon spirits." Right? He
[1:42:05] said there were 200,000
[1:42:08] 200,000,000
[1:42:10] demons that was loosed against the bride
[1:42:14] of Jesus Christ.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; But then I read over in the book of
[1:42:18] Hebrews.
[1:42:20] You know what Paul said? He said, "We
[1:42:22] have come to Mount Zion."
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; What is Zion? She's a type of the bride.
[1:42:27] We have come to Mount Zion. And you know
[1:42:30] what he said, brother? He said, "Where
[1:42:31] the angels are innumerable.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; The angels of God are innumerable. Come
[1:42:43] on, church. I'm in the message of the
[1:42:45] hour. Can I say it to you? We can count
[1:42:48] the demons, but we can't number the
[1:42:50] angels.
[1:42:53] We can count the demons, but we cannot
[1:42:56] number the angels. Oh, I want to say it,
[1:42:59] brother, with all my heart. There is
[1:43:01] more with us than there is with them.
[1:43:06] God is sent a prophet in this generation
[1:43:09] to open the eyes of the bride of Christ.
[1:43:11] It's not coming. It's all around you.
[1:43:17] [cheering]
[1:43:19] I'm talking about two worlds. I'm
[1:43:22] talking about where things that are seen
[1:43:24] are temporary. [cheering]
[1:43:27] Come on, church. The things that are
[1:43:29] seen are temporary. [laughter]
[1:43:32] But the things which are not seen, those
[1:43:34] things are eternal.
[1:43:37] I'm going to say it. I'm going to say
[1:43:38] this right now. I'm not trying to be a
[1:43:40] prophet. I'm not the prophet. And
[1:43:41] neither am I the son of a prophet. But I
[1:43:43] got a family member back home suffering
[1:43:44] with something in their body. I'll say
[1:43:46] this right now. There is more with you
[1:43:48] than there is with that devil that's
[1:43:50] afflicting your body. I'll say this
[1:43:52] right now. Amen. You may see the
[1:43:54] symptoms, but just remember they're
[1:43:56] temporary.
[1:43:58] I'm not a crazy man. I know what demon
[1:44:00] of fear begins to follow people when
[1:44:03] little things begin to show up on their
[1:44:05] body. But we are not here as a bunch of
[1:44:07] Pentecostal babies trying to work up an
[1:44:10] authority to overcome the devil. We are
[1:44:12] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:44:17] And you can see the symptoms, but
[1:44:19] they're temporary.
[1:44:24] I'm not a crazy man. I'm talking about
[1:44:26] unseen [laughter]
[1:44:27] and seen.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; You know what a prophet said? He said,
[1:44:31] "You got the Holy Ghost. You got
[1:44:33] something in here to believe with."
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; When the Holy Spirit comes in the heart,
[1:44:40] he says, "Quickly, he becomes a I'm
[1:44:42] sorry, I broke into another dimension
[1:44:44] right now. I'm trying to keep myself
[1:44:46] together." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When
[1:44:50] a man [screaming] realizes he's a son of
[1:44:52] God and the revelation strikes his
[1:44:55] heart, it's not a bunch of emotion. It's
[1:44:57] authority. [screaming]
[1:45:00] [cheering]
[1:45:02] Oh, I know I'm a twofold being. I'm on
[1:45:04] this earth to die, but I'm also one of
[1:45:07] heaven to live.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Listen what the prophet said. He said,
[1:45:10] "When you receive the revelation that
[1:45:13] Jesus Christ died for your sickness,
[1:45:15] it's that very hour your healing has
[1:45:18] come."
[1:45:22] When you receive from heaven that Jesus
[1:45:25] died for your sins and you have accepted
[1:45:28] it, you don't need any prayer for you.
[1:45:30] Then you've already accepted it. It's
[1:45:33] settled.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Now, we can preach the word. We can
[1:45:38] explain the word. But you [laughter]
[1:45:40] have to receive the word. Are y'all
[1:45:43] ready for this? He said, "That's what
[1:45:45] sets it a fire,
[1:45:48] brother. When you receive it, when you
[1:45:51] receive the revelation, I got a question
[1:45:53] for y'all. What good is a revelation
[1:45:55] that you can't understand?"
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. What good is a
[1:46:02] revelation when your babies are sick
[1:46:04] that you can't understand how to pray
[1:46:05] for them?
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just going to preach. I'm
[1:46:08] here. I think it's time to kick this
[1:46:11] illegalistic devil of works out of the
[1:46:14] house of God. And if I can pray hard
[1:46:16] enough, and if I can get good enough,
[1:46:18] then maybe God might do something for
[1:46:20] me. It's already done.
[1:46:23] [cheering]
[1:46:24] It's already done. You're already saved.
[1:46:28] I'm already healed. I've already got the
[1:46:31] Holy Ghost. My name is already on the
[1:46:33] lambs. Whom the son died for, he
[1:46:36] justified. And who he testified, he
[1:46:39] sanctified. Who he sanctified, he
[1:46:41] glorified. And read the rest of
[1:46:43] [laughter] it and has already perfected.
[1:46:46] There is a people who is not perfect by
[1:46:49] your church attendance. You are not
[1:46:51] perfected by your ability to memorize or
[1:46:53] quote. You are perfected by the word and
[1:46:56] that bleeding bloody word.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, what's happening?"
[1:47:04] I'll tell you what's happening.
[1:47:06] revelation.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; I defy that demon of anxiety right now.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; I defy that demon of depression right
[1:47:17] now.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; I defy it in the name of Jesus. Who the
[1:47:23] son has made free is free indeed.
[1:47:37] You want you want to you want to you
[1:47:39] want to change something? Let revelation
[1:47:41] come.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Let revelation come.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; You you know what a prophet said? Is
[1:47:46] this okay? You know what a prophet said?
[1:47:48] He said, "When you receive the
[1:47:49] revelation," he said, "then something
[1:47:52] slips out
[1:47:54] of the unseen world and comes rolling
[1:47:58] down to a mystic channel somewhere into
[1:48:01] your soul."
[1:48:04] And your soul says, "Now [screaming] I
[1:48:07] see it."
[1:48:10] Your eyes brighten. Your lips that hung
[1:48:13] down straighten up and smile. Every
[1:48:15] muscle in your body.
[1:48:18] Well, this is a bad night if you don't
[1:48:20] believe in praising God. Hallelujah.
[1:48:22] Every muscle in your body, it seems to
[1:48:25] rejoice. You know why? You know why?
[1:48:28] Because something is going to happen
[1:48:30] when your spirit becomes so hard to that
[1:48:34] outside world. When your intellectual
[1:48:36] faith comes down into the heart and
[1:48:38] becomes so charged.
[1:48:41] I'll tell you what's happening right
[1:48:42] now. I'm going to say it to you very
[1:48:44] plainly. It's a dangerous spot for the
[1:48:46] devil
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; in an atmosphere like this. It's a
[1:48:51] dangerous spot for the devil because
[1:48:54] there is a gusher of spiritual
[1:48:56] revelation that's rolling down through
[1:48:58] the mystic channel from an unseen world
[1:49:01] and it's striking you and it's striking
[1:49:03] you and it's striking you.
[1:49:08] What is it doing? It's charging you.
[1:49:13] Hallelujah. It's charging you and every
[1:49:17] word of God is becoming a positive
[1:49:20] truth.
[1:49:24] Will somebody give him praise in the
[1:49:25] house of God? Every word,
[1:49:29] every promise, every line, every chart,
[1:49:32] [music] every title is becoming a
[1:49:35] positive revelation.
[1:49:53] the prince of the power of the air who
[1:49:57] is Satan.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said he's right here to get
[1:50:00] you fumbled up in your mind. He said,
[1:50:02] "But listen,
[1:50:05] [snorts]
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; can you all give me that picture of the
[1:50:07] pillar of fire over brother Ramy's head
[1:50:08] if you have it quickly?"
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm not going to hold you much
[1:50:13] longer, but can I finish my thought?
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Will you hear me tonight?
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Will you hear the word of the Lord?
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; It's time to change your focus.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Whatever you're focusing on,
[1:50:32] is what's influencing you.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; But if you can change your focus,
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; listen what a prophet says.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let's turn our cameras this
[1:50:46] morning and look on up yonder in
[1:50:48] heaven."
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Let's break out of this dimension
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; and look up yonder. When things look so
[1:50:56] dreary here, there's always something
[1:51:00] going on
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; in another world.
[1:51:05] [applause and cheering]
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Now, if the pillar of fire is here,
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; what is the pillar of fire here to do?
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Is it here just to excite us?
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Is it just a Is it just a high word? The
[1:51:16] pillar of fire is here.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Now,
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; that very same fire, I don't know if you
[1:51:22] can get it or not. If you can't, that's
[1:51:23] okay.
[1:51:25] That very same fire that's on that
[1:51:29] picture
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; that the mechanical eye of the camera
[1:51:32] caught
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; is right now.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; It's moving between me and you.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; You know what he said? He [screaming]
[1:51:44] said being in another dimension
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; or another world.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Are you ready? What he said? He said I
[1:51:51] see it and you feel it.
[1:51:57] You just thought you was feeling the
[1:51:58] atmosphere of the building. Oh no. When
[1:52:01] the message is being preached, you are
[1:52:04] feeling the influence of the purifier.
[1:52:08] [music]
[1:52:09] Come on. I'm going to tell you this. I'm
[1:52:11] going to say it or I'm going to bust.
[1:52:12] I'm tired of a historical God. I'm tired
[1:52:15] of a God that was
[1:52:18] the God of this message, the God of
[1:52:20] Elijah, [screaming]
[1:52:21] the God of this Bible, the God of this
[1:52:23] message is right here in this building
[1:52:26] tonight.
[1:52:28] My God is not dead. He's alive and he's
[1:52:32] moving and he's healing.
[1:52:35] [applause]
[1:52:36] [cheering]
[1:52:38] That's it. Thank you, brother. Right
[1:52:39] there. Amen. You see that picture? Turn
[1:52:41] it around. Amen. Show it off. I am not
[1:52:44] ashamed of that picture. I am not
[1:52:46] ashamed of the picture of the pillar of
[1:52:49] fire.
[1:52:51] Go ahead, zoom in on it for me. The
[1:52:52] brothers are working hard in the back to
[1:52:54] get it. I I spring it on them real
[1:52:56] quick. Amen. Hold that in front of the
[1:52:57] camera, brother. Let Let somebody get
[1:52:59] that on the camera. That's it. Go ahead,
[1:53:01] zoom in on that.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. [panting and sighs]
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; That same pillar of fire.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Now, come on, folks. Who are we to
[1:53:14] follow, folks? Come on. We got to follow
[1:53:16] somebody. [screaming]
[1:53:17] Who are we following?
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Can I Can Leave [laughter] it right
[1:53:21] there. Can I show y'all something? Can I
[1:53:23] show you something? We don't just have
[1:53:25] the picture of the pillar of fire.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; We don't just have a picture, but we
[1:53:31] have a voice.
[1:53:41] There's a lot of men that would love to
[1:53:42] have their picture right there.
[1:53:46] [sighs and gasps]
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; But there's only one voice
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; to the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; It's the voice of the seventh angel. And
[1:53:55] what he taught is what we teach. And
[1:53:57] what he said is what we say. And what he
[1:54:00] presented is what we receive.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give me back that picture now. I'm
[1:54:06] not done. I'm sorry y'all forgive me.
[1:54:09] [laughter] Amen. I got a question for
[1:54:10] you. Okay. Amen. Where is the pillar of
[1:54:13] fire?
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Where is it at in this picture?
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Now, now this is a microphone, isn't it?
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Okay. Where is this microphone?
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Is it above my head?
[1:54:31] The microphone is below my voice.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; So, I've got something to say, but I
[1:54:38] need a voice to say it through.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Do you see who the seventh angel is?
[1:54:46] He's the only microphone to this age.
[1:54:50] [cheering]
[1:54:51] The seventh angel was a microphone for
[1:54:54] the pillar of fire. What the pillar of
[1:54:56] fire was thinking is what the seventh
[1:54:58] angel was saying. And what he was saying
[1:55:02] is what I believe because I am of
[1:55:06] another order.
[1:55:09] [applause]
[1:55:10] I'm going to say this to you. That same
[1:55:12] pillar of fire is right here in this
[1:55:14] building tonight. Brother said, "If you
[1:55:16] can believe it, then whatever he leads
[1:55:18] your soul to believe, that is yours."
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; I want to close tonight by saying this.
[1:55:26] Every devil [laughter] is defeated.
[1:55:30] The pillar of fire is still with this
[1:55:32] church. The angel of the Lord is still
[1:55:35] with this message. What the prophet said
[1:55:38] has not expired. It's still the inspired
[1:55:41] revelation of the age we're living in.
[1:55:48] Melzdc
[1:55:49] is in this building tonight. [music]
[1:55:52] Elohim is in this building tonight. He's
[1:55:55] looking for a body. He's looking for a
[1:55:58] body. He has no eyes but yours. He has
[1:56:01] no hands but yours. He has no feet but
[1:56:04] yours. I give myself to Melzdc. I give
[1:56:09] myself to Elohim.
[1:56:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Turn loose of
[1:56:15] yourself right now. Turn loose of your
[1:56:17] ideas. Turn loose of your theories. Turn
[1:56:20] loose of what some man said and let
[1:56:22] Melzdc claim every ounce of your body.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:56:33] [applause]
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; There's an angel in this building.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; It's the angel of the Lord.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell y'all something right
[1:56:47] now.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; And I want you to hear me. And I want
[1:56:50] you to hear me plainly.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; I don't care how long you've had it. I
[1:56:54] don't care what condition you've had. I
[1:56:56] don't care what problem you've carried.
[1:56:58] I don't care what thing has been passed
[1:57:00] down from one generation to the next. I
[1:57:02] want to say something to you tonight. In
[1:57:04] the presence of the pillar of fire, it
[1:57:07] is defeated.
[1:57:09] [cheering]
[1:57:12] [applause]
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; In the presence of the pillar of fire,
[1:57:16] whatever ailment is afflicting you is
[1:57:18] defeated.
[1:57:22] I'm not going to rush through this. I'm
[1:57:23] going to I'm going to bust that devil
[1:57:24] square in the face.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; That devil is defeated.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire brings the devil
[1:57:37] powerless before. Come on. I study
[1:57:38] Brother's message. You know what he
[1:57:40] said? He said the pillar of fire is the
[1:57:42] anointing. He said, "And when the pillar
[1:57:44] of fire comes down," Thank you. I've
[1:57:46] just got liberty to preach. I'm I'm I'm
[1:57:48] done preaching. I'm having fun now.
[1:57:50] Amen. When the pillar of fire comes
[1:57:52] down, every spirit becomes subject to
[1:57:55] it.
[1:57:59] [applause]
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; When the pillar of fire comes,
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; every spirit becomes subject to it.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Every voice
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; becomes subject to it. Every gift
[1:58:11] becomes subject to it. Every preacher
[1:58:13] becomes subject to it. Every every ounce
[1:58:16] of this bride body becomes subject to
[1:58:17] the headship of Christ.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Now, can I say something to you?
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Be careful when you start talking about
[1:58:25] somebody's worship.
[1:58:30] [applause]
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's just the music doing that.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; What if it's the pillar of fire?
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; But it's just the pillar of fire hanging
[1:58:47] over that person.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; And the brooding presence of God is
[1:58:52] hovering over that individual. And
[1:58:54] they're getting ready to go from
[1:58:55] sickness unto health. They're getting
[1:58:57] ready to go from bondage under liberty.
[1:58:59] They're getting ready to go from fear
[1:59:01] unto faith. They're getting ready to go
[1:59:03] from failure unto success. I'm talking
[1:59:06] about the message of the hour and is
[1:59:09] influenced by the pillar of fire.
[1:59:12] [cheering]
[1:59:14] This ain't just some little intellectual
[1:59:16] talk somewhere. This is a living
[1:59:18] message.
[1:59:22] You want a testimony? You want a
[1:59:24] testimony of it?
[1:59:28] I got a friend of mine, Brother Ed
[1:59:29] Hunter, Mushing, Indiana. Brother Ed
[1:59:31] Hunter, years ago, he was in Brother
[1:59:33] Beam's meeting and proving his word.
[1:59:34] Some of y'all may know, brother Ed, he
[1:59:36] was in brothers meeting proving his
[1:59:38] word.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "Brother Andrew," he said, "I
[1:59:41] come to those meetings." He said, "I had
[1:59:43] a condition in my body." He said, "It
[1:59:45] was a condition of hemorrhoids." And he
[1:59:47] said, he said, "It had been in my family
[1:59:48] in generations before me and had it."
[1:59:50] And he said, "I was looking," this is a
[1:59:53] supernatural message, folks,
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; of the hour.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "I was looking to get a prayer
[1:59:58] card and get Brother Em's prayer line."
[2:00:00] And he said, "I got a prayer card." And
[2:00:02] you know what he said, brother? He
[2:00:03] started calling prayer card numbers, but
[2:00:05] he didn't call mine.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; And he said, "About that time, I'm going
[2:00:09] somewhere."
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "I just kind of settled down
[2:00:12] and I said this. My grandfather had it.
[2:00:14] My father had it. So, I guess I'll just
[2:00:17] have it."
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "If I can't get in the prayer
[2:00:21] line, then I guess I'll just have it."
[2:00:22] See, this is not about one person. It's
[2:00:25] about the anointing.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; It's about the pillar of fire. He said,
[2:00:30] "And just as I settled down and accepted
[2:00:33] I would always have it," you know what
[2:00:34] he said, brother Gideon? He said, "All
[2:00:36] of a sudden, something come over me."
[2:00:38] And he said, "It spoke to my heart and
[2:00:40] said, "Worship God regardless."
[2:00:46] [applause and cheering]
[2:00:49] He said, "Worship God [screaming]
[2:00:51] regardless. If you get in the prayer
[2:00:54] line, praise God. If you don't, praise
[2:00:56] God. If he prays for you, praise God. If
[2:00:59] he don't, praise God. Worship the Lord
[2:01:02] regardless.
[2:01:04] And you can go hear it on tape, okay?
[2:01:06] You can hear it for yourself. And all of
[2:01:08] a sudden, Brother B said, "Oh, big man
[2:01:11] from Texas, you finally recognized it,
[2:01:14] didn't you? You know what he said? He
[2:01:17] said, "The pillar of fire has been
[2:01:19] hanging over your head for a half an
[2:01:22] hour. It's been waiting for you to
[2:01:25] entertain. its presence.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; You know what he said? He said he be to
[2:01:31] worship the Lord. He be to worship. He
[2:01:34] said, "And I never had the trouble
[2:01:36] again." Brother Brandham never laid his
[2:01:38] hands on him. But he didn't [laughter]
[2:01:40] need to. The pill of fire was in
[2:01:42] attendance.
[2:01:45] I don't have to lay my hands on you
[2:01:47] tonight. I challenge you in the name of
[2:01:49] the Lord Jesus Christ upon the basis of
[2:01:52] the next of the hour. Rise up on your
[2:01:54] feet and receive your healing and
[2:01:57] receive your miracle and receive your
[2:01:59] prodical son coming home. Receive that
[2:02:02] deliverance. Receive ye the Holy Ghost.
[2:02:07] The pillar of fire has come from another
[2:02:10] world.
[2:02:13] [cheering] Worship the Lord.
[2:02:19] worship.
[2:02:29] Thou demon of confusion, I rebuke you
[2:02:35] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; You're not going to be the sons of God.
[2:02:46] I'm not a crazy man.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; I'm a I'm a I'm a Holy Ghost fil child
[2:02:51] of the living God.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; How long are you going to lay down and
[2:02:57] let the devil bind you under the chains
[2:02:59] of condemnation?
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; It's time to get up.

[2:04:43] have fallen but get [laughter] back up.
[2:04:46] You're still a son and a daughter. Come

[2:05:21] presence of God is in this building.
[2:05:24] Father, I may never have the opportunity
[2:05:25] again to speak to this people, but while
[2:05:27] I have a microphone tonight, I want to
[2:05:29] say this. This message is the truth.
[2:05:32] Lord, may you reveal it to them as never
[2:05:34] before. Lord, if there be one with a
[2:05:36] question, may you be the dissolver of
[2:05:38] doubts over that question.
[2:05:41] Father, may they realize they're from
[2:05:42] another world. May they realize this
[2:05:45] revelation has brought [music] a
[2:05:48] separation.
[2:05:49] It's called them back into their
[2:05:51] original identity.

[2:05:57] Satan, you are defeated in the name of
[2:05:59] Jesus.

[2:06:05] Thou demon of misconstring the word of
[2:06:07] the Lord, I bind you, Satan, in the name
[2:06:10] of Jesus. May the power of the Holy
[2:06:11] Ghost, may the pure fragrance of the of
[2:06:14] the sweet smelling savior of the word of
[2:06:16] life. Father, may the may the sons and
[2:06:19] daughters of God, Lord, may they come
[2:06:22] tonight and get a drink from that art
[2:06:23] teaching well, that fresh water.
