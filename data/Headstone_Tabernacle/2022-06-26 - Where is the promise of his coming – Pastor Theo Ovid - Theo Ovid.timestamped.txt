[44:28] for in such a hour as he think not the
[44:30] son of man cometh
[44:32] who then is a faithful
[44:34] and wise servant whom his lord had made
[44:37] rule over his household
[44:39] to give them meat and due season blessed
[44:41] is that servant
[44:42] whom his lord
[44:44] when he cometh shall find so doing
[44:47] there will i say unto you that he shall
[44:48] make him ruler over all his goods
[44:51] and but and if that evil servant
[44:55] shall see in his heart
[44:57] my lord delete his coming
[44:59] and shall begin to smite his fellow
[45:01] servants
[45:03] and to eat and drink with the drunken
[45:05] the lord of that savior and shall come
[45:06] in a day when you look at not for him
[45:09] and now when he's not aware of
[45:11] and shall
[45:12] cut him asunder and appoint him his
[45:14] portion with the hypocrites
[45:16] there shall be weeping
[45:18] a nation of teeth
[45:20] praise the lord we want to go to second
[45:21] peter
[45:23] chapter three verse one this second
[45:24] epistle
[45:25] beloved i know right unto you and both
[45:27] which i steal up your pure minds by way
[45:29] of remembrance that you may be mindful
[45:31] of the words which were spoken before
[45:34] by the holy prophets and of the
[45:35] commandments of us the apostles of the
[45:38] lord and savior
[45:39] knowing this first that they shall come
[45:42] in the last days coffins
[45:44] walking after their own lust and saying
[45:47] where is the promise of his coming
[45:49] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[45:51] things continue as they were from the
[45:53] beginning of create the creation
[45:55] for this they willingly are ignorant of
[45:57] that by the word of god the heavens were
[45:59] of old and the earth standing out of
[46:01] water and in the water and whereby the
[46:03] world that then was being overflowed and
[46:06] water perished
[46:07] but the heavens and the earth which are
[46:09] now by the same word are kept in store
[46:12] reserve unto fire against the day of
[46:14] judgment
[46:15] and peridition of ungodly men but
[46:17] beloved
[46:18] be not ignorant of this one thing that
[46:20] one day with the lord is a thousand
[46:22] years and a thousand years is one day
[46:24] the lord glory is not slack considering
[46:26] his promise some men come slackness but
[46:29] his lone suffering to us what not
[46:32] willing that any should perish but that
[46:34] all should come to repentance but the
[46:36] day of the lord will come as a thief in
[46:38] the night in which the heavens shall
[46:40] pass away but great noise and the
[46:42] elements shall melt with fruit and heat
[46:44] the it also and the works that are
[46:46] therein shall be burnt up see and then
[46:49] and all these things shall be dissolved
[46:51] let me say that one again see and then
[46:53] that all these things shall be resolved
[46:57] what manner of persons ought to be in
[46:59] all holy conversation and godliness and
[47:02] that conversation not talk that's living
[47:05] looking for visiting and hasting unto
[47:07] the common of the day of god wherein the
[47:10] heavens being on fire shall be resolved
[47:12] and the elements shall melt with truth
[47:14] and heat nevertheless we according to
[47:17] his promise look for a new heaven and a
[47:19] new earth when dwelleth righteousness
[47:22] and wherefore beloved seeing that you
[47:23] look for such things be diligent
[47:27] that you may be found in him in peace
[47:30] without spot and blameless let's pray
[47:32] one more time father we thank you for
[47:33] your word bless it interpret our hearts

[48:02] amen and you are fighting this great
[48:04] fight of fate who praised god we have a
[48:07] title this morning
[48:09] and the title is a question and from the
[48:11] scriptures where is the promise of his
[48:12] coming
[48:13] as a title
[48:15] where is the promise of his commandment
[48:16] trust by the end of this series we'll be
[48:18] able to answer that question
[48:20] the promise of his coming but he is
[48:22] coming you know
[48:23] but they know we have a promise of his
[48:25] coming
[48:26] or praise in the middle of the lord so i
[48:27] have a context scripture
[48:29] first thessalonians 4 i would not have
[48:31] to be ignorant brethren considering them
[48:33] which are asleep that you sorrow not as
[48:36] others who have no hope for if we
[48:38] believe that jesus died and rose again
[48:39] even so also with which sleep in jesus
[48:42] will god bring with him
[48:43] for this we say unto you by the word of
[48:45] the lord and this here is his coming
[48:48] this weekend to you by the word of the
[48:49] lord that we which alive remain
[48:52] unto the coming of the lord
[48:55] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[48:57] for the lord himself have not been with
[49:00] pastor bishop pope minister apostle or
[49:03] prophet evangelist the lord himself
[49:06] shall these sentiments with a shout with
[49:09] the voice of the archangel and with the
[49:11] trump of god and the dead in christ
[49:13] shall rise first
[49:14] then we which are alive and remain shall
[49:17] be caught up together with them in the
[49:19] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[49:22] so shall we ever be with the lord
[49:24] wherefore comfort one another with these
[49:26] words
[49:27] the bible exhort us to comfort one
[49:29] another that the lord himself
[49:31] the coming of the lord is upon us it's
[49:34] at hand praise god and we who are alive
[49:36] and remain praise god so it speaks about
[49:39] the dead being raised and it speaks
[49:41] about you who are alive and remain
[49:43] there's gonna be a bunch of people
[49:45] that's gonna be alive and remain
[49:47] praise god one will be taken one will be
[49:48] left oh glory to god two being a field
[49:51] one taken one left oh do we believe this
[49:53] is the word this morning
[49:55] we not killing time in church who want
[49:56] to kill time they're going to kill time
[49:58] but they're going to be a bunch of
[49:59] people that will believe the promise of
[50:01] the father
[50:02] they're going to believe what god has
[50:04] said
[50:05] oh glory to god and peter was exhorting
[50:07] them he come to stir up their minds to
[50:09] remember praise god the same god is not
[50:11] slack
[50:12] concerning his promise whatever god said
[50:15] he's promising he will bring it to pass
[50:17] praise god people are saying where is
[50:19] the promise of his coming
[50:20] oh glory to god the skeptics discovers
[50:23] praise god walking all the message
[50:25] walking all the anointing praise god
[50:28] walking away where is the promise that
[50:30] is coming oh glory to god you may be
[50:32] seated yeah let's go
[50:35] but abraham
[50:36] the coming of the lord is a mystery
[50:38] we don't know when he's coming or how
[50:40] he's coming but we know he is coming
[50:42] oh glory to god the community what a
[50:44] mystery we don't know when or how but
[50:46] he's coming and so was all the mysteries
[50:49] of god
[50:51] waiting for his last day
[50:53] after it's already been completed
[50:56] then he reveals and show what he has
[50:57] done
[50:58] so god wait till the seventh h
[51:01] till this last age to send a prophet
[51:04] that he could he could look back and see
[51:07] from all the ages what he has already
[51:09] done
[51:10] oh glory to god watch after it's already
[51:13] completed
[51:14] then he reveals and show what he done
[51:17] never give his mystery in full
[51:19] so all the brothers that went on before
[51:21] never got the full mystery
[51:23] you only give it in part
[51:25] through seven ages
[51:27] part of it
[51:28] part of it
[51:29] part of it everybody packing a part is
[51:32] only in the last days god sent a
[51:34] messenger to tie up all the parts
[51:37] do you see what you're getting to
[51:39] you see one coming to you
[51:41] not pat the bible said this way when
[51:43] that which is in part is when when that
[51:46] which is perfect is come then that which
[51:48] is part is done away with so god is
[51:50] requiring that which is perfect
[51:52] all seven parts
[51:54] all seven mysteries
[51:56] all seven thunders
[51:58] all glory to god has to line up praise
[52:01] god has to come back as the full token
[52:04] even the time message that we could
[52:06] leave here there's a bunch of people
[52:08] leaving here i am convinced of it
[52:11] oh praise the name never give his
[52:13] mystery in full
[52:15] then he says just like comparing the
[52:16] seven seals now when god used martin
[52:19] luther for the coming out of that church
[52:21] or that church age when he used john
[52:23] wesley he gradually brought him out and
[52:26] was revealing in them
[52:28] that church age
[52:30] revealing where so they were living out
[52:33] something that couldn't be explained
[52:35] hallelujah looter level justification
[52:38] where's the level of sanctification and
[52:39] they were actually living all the age
[52:41] that they were living in
[52:43] without knowing as a whole age
[52:45] their life was thundering and that was a
[52:47] mystery to the devil so the devil
[52:49] couldn't understand these beard drinking
[52:51] praise god justified men in luther's
[52:53] time
[52:54] but sanctification didn't come yet so
[52:56] while they clinging and glassing and
[52:57] drinking their beers they were justified
[53:00] by faith
[53:01] believing a word message from luther but
[53:04] then wesley came to bring a
[53:05] sanctification i say it cannot be no
[53:07] swagger cigarette smoking be a drinking
[53:09] believer you have to clean that up
[53:12] so then the message of sanctification
[53:14] turned into their souls and that got
[53:16] them sanctified because god was
[53:18] preparing them for the next step
[53:20] which was the holy ghost
[53:22] oh give the lord i shout
[53:24] god wasn't just bringing them out to
[53:26] justify them god wasn't just bringing
[53:28] them to sanctify them he was bringing
[53:30] them to clean them up that he could put
[53:32] his spirit
[53:33] inside of them so when the spirit fell
[53:36] it fell on a bunch of people to
[53:38] pentecostals speaking tongues and signs
[53:40] and wonders but there was no life
[53:42] because the word has not been restored
[53:45] it took a profit to get the full word to
[53:47] be restored
[53:48] and they rejected the prophetic message
[53:51] oh glory to god they perfected malachi
[53:53] 4.
[53:54] god said whole i sent you
[53:56] oh glory
[53:58] elijah the prophet
[54:00] when
[54:01] when
[54:02] before
[54:04] the territory of the lord
[54:05] so malachi 4
[54:07] that elijah is the promise of his coming
[54:10] once you see elijah you know he is
[54:13] coming
[54:14] elijah is a guarantee
[54:16] oh glory to god he is coming
[54:19] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he
[54:22] was ready on his way
[54:25] because the lord himself
[54:27] is with a shout
[54:29] he does three things when he coming down
[54:32] a shout a voice and a trump he has
[54:34] already started
[54:36] oh glory to god as a bride
[54:38] to be hewn out there's a pride to be
[54:41] harvested
[54:42] all glory that god harvest time is
[54:44] beautiful
[54:45] harvest time is a tremendous time
[54:47] when you put the seed in the ground
[54:49] and you see the corn pip out and you
[54:52] mold it you watch it grow
[54:54] you get the weeds away from it you see
[54:56] it getting mature and stronger then it
[54:59] put out a flower then i put other fruit
[55:02] you see a small little something come
[55:04] out but you know it had more to come
[55:06] and when it come into full fruition when
[55:08] it comes to maturity what a joy
[55:12] to come with the sickle
[55:13] okla what a joy
[55:15] to come with a sharp knife what a joy
[55:18] to reap the harvest and the husband man
[55:22] has been long waiting to reap the
[55:25] harvest of the earth and god himself as
[55:28] the husband man has been waiting a long
[55:31] time
[55:32] to harvest this pride or 1962
[55:36] five planets lined up these are infant
[55:39] church
[55:40] oh glory to god at church in his infancy
[55:43] i think on thursday it had five or seven
[55:45] planets lined up i wonder what that
[55:47] represents
[55:48] or all these years is it a bride coming
[55:51] to maturity right here in july hot july
[55:55] sun
[55:56] coming into maturity
[55:58] the face praise god the challenges
[56:01] that lays ahead all glory look good
[56:05] hallelujah
[56:07] hallelujah
[56:09] so he was revealing in them
[56:11] that church
[56:13] could imagine god revealing in you
[56:15] the seventh seal
[56:17] oh glory to god silence was on the deer
[56:20] and something was living on the deer
[56:23] all glory to god there was silence in
[56:24] heaven
[56:25] not on earth silence in heaven for the
[56:28] space of half an hour but a message
[56:30] already getting to somebody because he
[56:32] said the secret is the word is in the
[56:34] bride so even though there was silence
[56:36] in heaven for half an hour the secret
[56:38] remains
[56:40] a supernatural element over the secret
[56:42] that's inside of you you can't explain
[56:45] it you struggle out here you stumble out
[56:48] to here you get out of here you get out
[56:51] of this trouble and this trouble and
[56:52] that trouble oh god you don't know how
[56:54] you got out but you got out god make you
[56:57] an escape one oh glory to god you escape
[57:00] the devil you escape all kind of funny
[57:03] cookie business you escape them you
[57:05] escape false pastors false shepherds
[57:08] fall preachers false teaching you escape
[57:10] that oh give the lord a praise
[57:13] you're not saying the lord delay is
[57:15] coming oh
[57:17] hallelujah we're not saying that
[57:19] there is no more delay
[57:22] oh hallelujah
[57:24] hallelujah
[57:27] glory
[57:28] my god
[57:30] watch
[57:31] when he was using wesley he was
[57:33] gradually brought them out and was
[57:34] revealing in them
[57:36] that church age
[57:37] one goes back to the bible now and find
[57:39] out but in the last days
[57:42] the reason that there was such a
[57:43] tremendous thing he spoke of
[57:45] and showed those seven thunders
[57:48] in luke and life magazine
[57:50] and packed that circle of cloud he said
[57:52] they surely seven thunders and look at
[57:54] night magazine
[57:56] and then that circle of cloud and light
[57:58] they couldn't understand but don't know
[58:01] don't know it yet but here telling go
[58:03] there and wait
[58:04] these mysteries to be revealed and once
[58:07] what happened just exactly the way he
[58:09] said it would do
[58:10] did you notice in that picture
[58:12] even the angel on the right when he was
[58:15] being materialized
[58:17] coming along with his wings back his
[58:19] head sitting sideways
[58:21] there it is right there in the picture
[58:23] just exactly months before it happened
[58:25] he's going to bring the body of
[58:27] believers together to reveal and take up
[58:29] them lost ends
[58:31] oh praise god so god is not in the loose
[58:33] ends business he does tie up his
[58:35] business
[58:36] hallelujah all the loose areas and stuff
[58:39] he sent a prophet to tie up all
[58:41] the loose ends and he's quoting i saw
[58:43] the right hand of him i said upon a
[58:44] throne a book written
[58:46] written
[58:48] and he's saying the writing was on the
[58:50] inside
[58:51] and on the back side sealed with seven
[58:52] seals he didn't say writing on the
[58:54] outside the writing was on the inside
[58:57] but on the back side sealed with seven
[58:59] seals and he's going deeper now the
[59:01] writing is on the inside of the book but
[59:04] the back side had seven seals
[59:06] on the back of it that was written well
[59:07] that wasn't written in the book
[59:09] now this is the revelator talking in the
[59:12] days of the voice of the seven names and
[59:14] all the mysteries that is written
[59:16] within should be finished
[59:19] hallelujah so brother branham as malachi
[59:22] 4 that elijah came to deal with the
[59:24] mysteries
[59:25] that was written within
[59:26] but the mighty angel the one with the
[59:28] straight black wings the one revelation
[59:30] 10 that had the book open
[59:33] seven thunders came out of his mouth
[59:35] and when he uttered like a land roar it
[59:37] and then seven thunders come up out of
[59:39] his mouth he came to deal with the seals
[59:41] on the back of the book
[59:42] oh glory to god the mighty angel himself
[59:45] the lord himself i saw a mighty angel
[59:49] come down from heaven with the book open
[59:51] all the time was book was sealed but now
[59:54] the book is open and the seals on the
[59:56] back of the book which are seven
[59:58] thunders which are seven voices oh glory
[1:00:01] to god that mighty angel he came to deal
[1:00:04] with that or give the lord some praises
[1:00:07] then
[1:00:09] whatever i'm saying he said no
[1:00:11] he himself not me
[1:00:13] he's interpreting
[1:00:15] revelation 10 7.
[1:00:17] revelation 10 7 says the days of the
[1:00:19] voice of the seventh angel when he begin
[1:00:21] the song the mystery of god should be
[1:00:24] finished
[1:00:25] always wonder about that phrase
[1:00:27] as he created saving the prophets right
[1:00:29] so he's interpreting it in the days of
[1:00:31] the voice of the seventh angel all this
[1:00:33] mystery
[1:00:35] that is written within
[1:00:37] should be finished
[1:00:39] in other words he's saying all the loose
[1:00:40] ends will be tied up then
[1:00:42] in the days of the voice and seventh
[1:00:43] danger
[1:00:44] all the losing will be tied up to make
[1:00:46] way
[1:00:47] for the next messenger
[1:00:51] which is the lord himself
[1:00:54] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:56] because god remember
[1:00:58] william branham came as elijah
[1:01:00] elijah made a river who messiah
[1:01:03] which was son of man
[1:01:05] jesus
[1:01:06] so john made a way for jesus
[1:01:09] he was told to make a way where he was
[1:01:11] tall in the bank ohio river 1933 as john
[1:01:14] the baptist was sent to for run the
[1:01:16] first covenant of christ you have a
[1:01:18] message that would run the second coming
[1:01:20] of christ and that message unfolded to a
[1:01:23] first pull she was second pulled and the
[1:01:25] turtle was to catch the bride so he
[1:01:27] started with healing ministry building
[1:01:29] up to come to the message to get to you
[1:01:32] all glory to god not with filler
[1:01:34] material but with the real deal the real
[1:01:36] thing oh glory to god because when you
[1:01:39] see the message you can't unsee it oh
[1:01:41] give the lord a shout when you really
[1:01:44] see the message you cannot unsee it
[1:01:46] [Applause]
[1:01:47] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:52] [Applause]
[1:01:55] so then when he referred to the perfect
[1:01:57] man he said this being
[1:01:59] this being you don't know this teaching
[1:02:04] this revelation he call it a being
[1:02:08] this being
[1:02:10] when it is completed
[1:02:12] is the servant of god
[1:02:14] in the church of god
[1:02:15] that is called in the rapture
[1:02:17] if it is not completed not going in the
[1:02:21] rapture
[1:02:27] you ever see two magnus i wish i had it
[1:02:28] here now
[1:02:30] according to where you put it push push
[1:02:32] it aside
[1:02:35] that is too negative or so but for the
[1:02:37] punch
[1:02:38] so if you have negative on this side

[1:07:27] completed not to say on the front side
[1:07:29] he said on the back side after it's all
[1:07:31] done completed then these seven thunder
[1:07:34] voices is the only thing that is stuck
[1:07:37] to the book
[1:07:38] that's not written in the book oh my

[1:07:47] fixing to leave you
[1:07:49] don't fail you ever listen listen
[1:07:52] but i'm talking to this church he said
[1:07:54] these seals are on the back side of the
[1:07:56] book and at the time that the seven is
[1:07:58] sung then all the missions that were
[1:08:00] written in the book is completed and
[1:08:02] immediately the book that was opened is
[1:08:04] written within is closed the mysteries
[1:08:06] of god is finished and this is the
[1:08:08] mysteries of god the queen of the church
[1:08:10] and these are the things the mysteries
[1:08:12] is over and when the seven angels sounds
[1:08:15] out every mysteries is over let him be
[1:08:17] whoever he may be god word can fail but
[1:08:20] in the days of the voice of the seven
[1:08:22] angel he quote in the scripture when he
[1:08:24] shall begin to sound the mystery of god
[1:08:26] should be finished as he had declared to
[1:08:28] his sibling the prophets now those
[1:08:29] things wrong so he explained the
[1:08:31] mysteries in the book rome the all
[1:08:34] the protestant churches denomination
[1:08:36] denomination after her has become a
[1:08:37] heartless all those mysteries that the
[1:08:39] prophet spoke of will be revealed on
[1:08:41] this all when the seven angel rises in
[1:08:43] the loudest church age he begins to
[1:08:45] sound for the true trumpet because it
[1:08:47] will be contrary but will be inspired
[1:08:49] it will be an inspired prophet there's
[1:08:51] no way to figure it out
[1:08:53] oh my god
[1:08:56] hallelujah
[1:08:58] thank you jesus
[1:08:59] praise god so the scripture we read you
[1:09:02] talk about watch he said um
[1:09:05] and then
[1:09:06] if that evil servant shall say in his
[1:09:08] heart my law delete is coming
[1:09:11] no it's not an evil unbeliever
[1:09:18] it's evil servant
[1:09:22] saying
[1:09:23] saying in his heart my lord delays he's
[1:09:25] coming and begin to smite his fellow
[1:09:28] servants and to eat and drink with the
[1:09:29] drunk
[1:09:30] now watch
[1:09:31] if you say the lord is coming you could
[1:09:34] party you could do whatever they want
[1:09:37] see that like when god tell abraham you
[1:09:39] have a son he didn't tell him when
[1:09:41] it was to be 25 years later
[1:09:44] so god didn't leave abraham to go and

[1:12:10] and when barbara read that scripture
[1:12:12] which woman having these coins when lost
[1:12:13] one wouldn't seek glitch until she finds
[1:12:15] it
[1:12:16] and only a prophet could take a
[1:12:17] scripture like that and said this here
[1:12:19] have to do with the crime of the lord
[1:12:21] nobody else could do that
[1:12:22] you see coins and fine coins lost coin
[1:12:25] and he takes he said this is considered
[1:12:27] in the coming of the lord a husband was
[1:12:29] coming i endorse this didn't have a ring
[1:12:31] you'd have a coin on the wrong head a
[1:12:33] ban and every coin represents a certain
[1:12:34] vote you and so on
[1:12:36] what's your wife towards your husband or
[1:12:38] and if you're following adultery or
[1:12:39] whatever it is they will take it to the
[1:12:40] temple take out a coin that represented
[1:12:43] virtue or whatever it is when your
[1:12:44] husband come home and see in that
[1:12:46] condition he divorced you
[1:12:47] that is always in those times so the
[1:12:50] woman lost her coin she can't risk her
[1:12:52] husband coming home
[1:12:54] and she don't have a coin where supposed
[1:12:55] to be

[1:17:58] of the living god in this great art
[1:18:00] we're now living it behooves us a
[1:18:02] checkup
[1:18:03] go before god
[1:18:05] light the candle of the word
[1:18:07] and examine ourselves and find out if we
[1:18:10] are not falling short
[1:18:11] and especially when we see all these
[1:18:13] things coming we are the end time the
[1:18:15] coming of christ is at hand there's not
[1:18:17] one hope in the world for the church
[1:18:19] look
[1:18:20] the church is lolian
[1:18:23] this is a prophet speaking
[1:18:25] he's speaking by prophecy by vision by
[1:18:27] inspiration he's talking about the
[1:18:29] church and his condition
[1:18:30] after coronavirus
[1:18:34] some people can see them in church
[1:18:36] honey
[1:18:42] i wonder if
[1:18:44] they look in the service or they're
[1:18:44] doing something else right now
[1:18:47] or just hearing it
[1:18:49] when are they playing close attention
[1:18:52] all over the world when people fall off
[1:18:53] you know
[1:18:54] oh yes
[1:18:55] corner of it come like a filter
[1:18:57] it not only kill people physically you
[1:18:59] know they seem to have killed people
[1:19:00] spiritually too
[1:19:02] that not even goliath
[1:19:05] that not even does not even be a lion
[1:19:07] test there are viruses all over the
[1:19:09] world unbeliever make believer all
[1:19:11] different religions class creed country
[1:19:13] have you name it culture food whatever
[1:19:16] it's it all over the world and
[1:19:17] christians
[1:19:18] get conquered
[1:19:25] the church is lolian
[1:19:28] the church has no conscience no more
[1:19:31] you can hardly wake them
[1:19:34] up somebody should be praised to pray
[1:19:37] from lca london where people were seeing
[1:19:40] a scary scripture
[1:19:42] seeing they see nothing
[1:19:44] hearing they hear no that is scary
[1:19:46] the hearing and the hear that they're
[1:19:48] not hearing
[1:19:49] the seeing having not seen
[1:19:52] a blindness of deafness the hearing word
[1:19:54] they know is the truth
[1:19:56] but they they can't do nothing about it
[1:20:00] but the truth will be on
[1:20:03] could could people be lost eternal loss
[1:20:06] i don't know
[1:20:08] it's serious you know
[1:20:09] because the word
[1:20:11] that they heard israel wasn't mixed with
[1:20:13] faith and that got him into trouble
[1:20:16] very few was able to apply what they
[1:20:18] were hearing
[1:20:19] all were here in the gospel
[1:20:21] all was here in moses but all wasn't
[1:20:24] mixing what they were hearing with fate
[1:20:27] because faith is how you're going to
[1:20:28] approach this new season
[1:20:31] not feelings
[1:20:32] not emotions
[1:20:34] emotions is something else you know
[1:20:36] oh yes
[1:20:37] a song a feeling a atmosphere and you're
[1:20:40] caught up in it god gave man that
[1:20:43] to deal with things down here it's a
[1:20:46] good thing god give your imagination a
[1:20:47] little bit doesn't help you
[1:20:49] you might go crazy
[1:20:51] say i imagine you're getting over it
[1:20:54] imagine you're flying somewhere going
[1:20:55] somewhere god gave you a conscience
[1:20:57] memory affection reason all these things
[1:20:59] to deal with the atmosphere down here
[1:21:02] that is still not god yet
[1:21:03] but to talk to him to get to him had to
[1:21:05] go past that
[1:21:07] it's a sixth sense that's deal with him
[1:21:09] a sixth sense called faith
[1:21:12] and these lepers
[1:21:13] who said if you will stay here we'll
[1:21:15] dive in gossip real dead anywhere we die
[1:21:18] be moving so without food up too
[1:21:20] then we are starving at least we make
[1:21:22] your bread
[1:21:24] and their little dingy fate
[1:21:27] bomb says faith based on reasoning
[1:21:29] if we stay with that the calculation
[1:21:31] facility there which one which one
[1:21:35] boat is dead
[1:21:37] and they decide to move
[1:21:39] then i sit down here all these years are
[1:21:40] dying i ain't moving
[1:21:43] you will die
[1:21:46] you better move with the cloud
[1:21:48] you better move with the pillar of fire
[1:21:50] people love the church more than love
[1:21:52] god
[1:21:52] they love the church more than i love
[1:21:54] the word
[1:21:54] because when the word challenges you to
[1:21:56] operate and deal differently you have to
[1:21:58] accept that i became a brother of your
[1:22:00] sister you come to speak a separation
[1:22:03] praise god your husband can be a liar
[1:22:05] praise god your sister could be a liar
[1:22:07] it doesn't matter your mother brother
[1:22:09] doesn't matter any man word contrary to
[1:22:11] the word is a liar my word is true
[1:22:14] your sense is lying to you
[1:22:16] if you not agree with the word tell your
[1:22:18] senses sit down and shut up
[1:22:20] sometimes i tell them listen you want to
[1:22:22] see them say oh am i going to church
[1:22:24] praise god i ain't going with my feeling
[1:22:25] your feelings are still up there feeling
[1:22:26] you stay there everyone i go in the
[1:22:28] church i walk in my faith
[1:22:29] i come to church by faith i end up
[1:22:31] feeling good this morning but i just had
[1:22:32] to come to church this morning all of a
[1:22:34] sudden faith started to arise throwing
[1:22:37] your soul
[1:22:38] when i think back about my life when i
[1:22:40] think about all what god brought me out
[1:22:42] i said god is the future put him in his
[1:22:44] soul that keep me on the catholic church
[1:22:47] it's the fear to put him a soul that
[1:22:49] made me step out of this and step over
[1:22:50] that i step on the church and step on
[1:22:52] the group step up to all kind of stuff i
[1:22:54] walk out and leave them back because
[1:22:56] faith inside of they're moving
[1:22:58] oh glory to god every time i move it's
[1:23:00] bringing me closer to the word oh give
[1:23:02] the lord i shout not away from the word
[1:23:04] closer to the word
[1:23:06] that's why you're moving
[1:23:08] glory to god be moving this way today to
[1:23:11] bring us closer to him
[1:23:14] promise of his coming
[1:23:16] so watch the church has no conscience no
[1:23:18] more you could hardly wake them up
[1:23:20] the bible said they would come in that
[1:23:22] condition and they will say the law our
[1:23:24] lord delay is coming
[1:23:26] and this is the path somehow i
[1:23:28] i don't know how i never
[1:23:31] kind of picked this up in this way but
[1:23:33] then he said
[1:23:34] they will say lo our lord is coming and
[1:23:36] they will be devouring and biting one
[1:23:38] another
[1:23:40] fighting around
[1:23:41] just exactly at that hour
[1:23:44] so now i could see
[1:23:46] what led the prophet up to when the
[1:23:48] church finds his brotherly love
[1:23:50] because with brotherly love you can't
[1:23:51] fight your brother
[1:23:53] you forgive your brother
[1:23:55] all glory to god i know understand
[1:23:57] the revelation of the lord the latest
[1:24:00] coming brings a certain blindness upon
[1:24:02] those servants that doesn't see the
[1:24:04] right picture and they figure by cutting
[1:24:07] somebody down it puts them up
[1:24:10] this one not in a five-fold they have
[1:24:12] authority to do that
[1:24:16] who only fight for who not in the fight
[1:24:17] for who is this who is that who is there
[1:24:19] them and how people believe in that
[1:24:21] believe in that
[1:24:23] and god already to a prophet talk about
[1:24:25] not man picking five vo
[1:24:27] god has set in the church there's that
[1:24:30] man appointed you know people voting
[1:24:32] when god set god said
[1:24:34] when god wanted to say something goddess
[1:24:35] do something about it you know go on to
[1:24:37] place david as king he get samuel to go
[1:24:39] to the house of jesse and say anoint one
[1:24:41] of them
[1:24:42] and we know the stories that david was
[1:24:44] anointed
[1:24:45] praise god so when god ready to anoint
[1:24:47] you are gonna anoint you you're a god
[1:24:49] lock god next for the anointing god will
[1:24:51] come and anoint you the bride will be
[1:24:53] anointed you will be anointed praise god
[1:24:56] praise god you heard a message last last
[1:24:59] wednesday night

[1:25:04] the plan of god according to election
[1:25:07] god elected you this hour your father
[1:25:09] couldn't stop you your mother couldn't
[1:25:10] stop you from coming to this message you
[1:25:12] had to see it
[1:25:14] you must obstacle the terror put in your
[1:25:16] way to blind you from this message
[1:25:18] and yet to come to remember london yet
[1:25:21] you come to any hole you had to come
[1:25:23] true your name is on the book that's why
[1:25:25] you're here
[1:25:27] your name is on the book
[1:25:29] [Applause]
[1:25:31] [Music]
[1:25:32] glory
[1:25:34] glory to god
[1:25:35] and once you see it you can't see it
[1:25:47] the coming of the lord
[1:25:49] first testimony 4 16.
[1:25:51] so to say the lord then is coming is to
[1:25:53] also say i do not really believe
[1:25:56] first thessalonians 4 16.
[1:25:59] i don't believe the shout is on
[1:26:03] watch he said the jewish loss of light
[1:26:05] depending because there is also light
[1:26:06] the baptist laws are light every light
[1:26:08] seems to be gone
[1:26:09] he said the pentecost are people
[1:26:10] homeless acting like the methodist
[1:26:12] messengers i climbed the baptist
[1:26:13] baptizing the lutheran lutheran act like
[1:26:15] the catholic we are the end time that
[1:26:17] comes along she had a whole stream in
[1:26:19] time she scrubbed the floor she swept
[1:26:21] the wall she took down the cupboard she
[1:26:23] kept on until
[1:26:25] she found what she had lost
[1:26:27] and when she did
[1:26:29] she called her little sister churches
[1:26:31] to come now
[1:26:36] now if the churches don't recognize they
[1:26:37] lost something they're looking for
[1:26:38] nothing you know because they think they
[1:26:40] oh
[1:26:41] yeah before i'm saying no they think
[1:26:43] they have it
[1:26:44] they have the support of the people they
[1:26:46] think they are it right watch this part
[1:26:48] prophecy i don't care
[1:26:51] if you are methodist baptist pentecostal
[1:26:54] presbyterian come let us rejoice
[1:26:56] together
[1:26:59] and prophecy now when that time come
[1:27:04] speaks
[1:27:05] when that time when the church finds
[1:27:08] it's brotherly love
[1:27:10] so you mean it look as if it could be
[1:27:11] lost there
[1:27:12] there will be issues where bloody love
[1:27:15] is concerned
[1:27:16] some of you hope you get tired of me
[1:27:18] talking about this but people say what
[1:27:19] but you always know my brother i really
[1:27:20] love very love

[1:27:23] i will stop music because that's a
[1:27:24] blood-free age
[1:27:26] and
[1:27:27] and here is bob fate is based on
[1:27:30] forgiveness
[1:27:31] so if you don't understand and see the
[1:27:33] picture of why it has to have brought in
[1:27:36] love and why you have to stop riling
[1:27:38] yourself up against your brother
[1:27:42] because sometimes you relevance heaven
[1:27:44] there
[1:27:59] and fight and battle they're helping you

[1:28:35] recognize
[1:28:36] your word
[1:28:37] it's just that you own your word dino
[1:28:39] god would you speak
[1:28:41] because i have mercy upon whom i have

[1:53:41] mature
[1:53:43] leaves and so on
[1:53:44] and put out the little fine kind of gold
[1:53:47] looking here
[1:53:48] and then the corns that have formed
[1:53:50] there you can't pick it yet because it's
[1:53:52] still curly it's still golden
[1:53:54] afterwards the sun starts to beat it and
[1:53:56] when i get dry
[1:53:58] ice a plant called nps you know so i

[2:03:35] oneness with himself
[2:03:36] with the same kind of a ministry he had
[2:03:39] you know how i shaped the church ages
[2:03:40] here long ago the big tall was built
[2:03:43] called the pyramid but the headset was
[2:03:45] never put on it remember that what he's
[2:03:47] doing he called out the elect to make
[2:03:49] all the loser run he called the elector
[2:03:51] lutheran to make the wesleyan he called
[2:03:53] the elect out of the to make the
[2:03:54] pentecostals now he's calling the elect
[2:03:56] pentecostals out to make the headstone
[2:04:00] to come into it
[2:04:01] you mean the bride's going to make up
[2:04:03] the headstone
[2:04:04] then he could step into it

[2:04:08] pentecostal out to make the headstone to
[2:04:10] commentate
[2:04:11] a very same kind of a ministry dropping

[2:24:46] uh this is from sister suzanne dunda
[2:24:49] good morning and god bless saints i want
[2:24:50] to thank the lord for placing me back in
[2:24:52] the house of the lord after being out of
[2:24:54] church for 12 years it was not an easy
[2:24:57] road to walk things was very tough but
[2:24:59] god kept me through every trial that
[2:25:01] came my way
[2:25:02] and there were times when i wanted to
[2:25:03] give up because my life wasn't a mess
[2:25:05] and i've tried so many times but nothing
[2:25:07] was working out and there's one are
[2:25:09] deciding i need my blessing so i decided
[2:25:12] to take back of the lord where i had
[2:25:14] left him it's not such a powerful
[2:25:16] statement didn't the prophet teach us
[2:25:18] god never leaves us but we are the ones
[2:25:20] who leave him and if you want to
[2:25:22] pick up the pieces you need to go right
[2:25:24] back to where you left him

[2:25:29] speaking about now what is the
[2:25:31] experience coming back into fellowship
[2:25:33] but the devil did not like that so he

[2:25:36] me by letting my daughter leave home and
[2:25:38] from that d
[2:25:39] she left my life felt empty and i was
[2:25:41] not at rest

[2:33:56] amen and amen and amen
[2:33:59] you may be seated for a few
[2:34:00] announcements
[2:34:06] so our first
[2:34:08] this will be a major announcement
[2:34:11] is that
[2:34:13] due to a number of factors the
[2:34:15] convention
[2:34:17] for july
[2:34:18] we will be adjusting the dates
[2:34:21] of the convention and due to a number of
[2:34:23] factors as well it will
[2:34:25] be primarily a virtual convention so
[2:34:28] officially the dates of this year's
[2:34:30] convention will be july 28th to the 31st
[2:34:34] july 28th 29th 30th and 31st
[2:34:39] and it'll be a primarily virtual
[2:34:41] convention so
[2:34:42] remain in prayer remain under great
[2:34:45] expectation as we still navigate a
[2:34:47] number of factors
[2:34:48] towards the teal end of this pandemic
[2:34:51] and what god wants to do for us
[2:34:53] i truly believe in my heart we don't
[2:34:55] have too much time left
[2:34:56] and i believe that we have to do
[2:34:58] everything we can do while
[2:35:01] we could do it
[2:35:02] as we redeem the time
[2:35:05] we see the world falling apart we see
[2:35:07] what's happening in the medical realm
[2:35:09] and we see what's happening in all these
[2:35:11] things that are happening politically
[2:35:13] and economically and just
[2:35:15] stacking you know layers of what has
[2:35:18] been prophesied both in scripture as
[2:35:20] well as our prophet's message
[2:35:23] you don't need much to know the end is
[2:35:24] upon us
[2:35:25] people who i know don't even know about
[2:35:27] church saying the end is upon us so much
[2:35:30] more we who have been given insight and
[2:35:32] to reveal word of our god so be in
[2:35:35] prayer
[2:35:36] be in
[2:35:37] consecration
[2:35:38] not just for the convention but there
[2:35:40] are many people who are struggling as
[2:35:43] broadband was preaching about this this
[2:35:45] pandemic took all people in different
[2:35:47] ways people have lost zeal and lost joy
[2:35:50] and allowed the stresses of life to
[2:35:53] affect them in so many ways and as we
[2:35:55] preached both today last wednesday last
[2:35:58] sunday
[2:35:59] but getting into that place of rest and
[2:36:01] resting on god's word we really want to
[2:36:03] begin to continue to
[2:36:05] stay in the spirit as we progress
[2:36:08] throughout whatever time god has for us
[2:36:10] before this world
[2:36:12] is burned with the food and heat
[2:36:14] you know it makes you question so many
[2:36:16] things we do for the natural and for the
[2:36:18] physical when that is just temporary
[2:36:21] and it would not last and only what you
[2:36:23] do in the spiritual economy of god is
[2:36:25] what will last what you do for the
[2:36:27] kingdom of god that will last what you
[2:36:28] do for the people of god will last what
[2:36:30] you do for him is what will last so be
[2:36:33] on the great expectation be in prayer
[2:36:35] for the ministers for the virtual
[2:36:36] convention and
[2:36:38] it's a great responsibility on the
[2:36:39] technical team
[2:36:41] um here the tabernacle and those around
