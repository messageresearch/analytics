this Wednesday evening in your house and may you come down in a special way and speak to us God made something he said something be done that will change hearts and change lives in ourselves we can't do it it takes the operation of your spirit to change Hearts to change thinking to change people desires Lord the cleanse and the Persian to purify and to uplift and to deliver and to fill with the Holy Ghost and we ask for a supernatural intervention tonight such a people father those are here and those who are connected live and those who would hear the message granted father we thank you in Jesus name we ask it amen God bless you what a message a masterpiece on Sunday let us go on the Perfection about Anthony that was a massive piece of salute you glory to God Amen God bless you my brother tonight we wanna tune to two posts of scripture from Isaiah chapter 14 we want to read verse 20 to 31 and Isaiah 64 we want to read one verse there was four so we see what the Lord knew tonight I was tremendously blessed on Sunday amen amen amen praise God we're looking for more gifts more talents men that God would use and bless because it's a bright idea to come into that position in Christ Jesus okay so let's read Isaiah chapter 40. verse 28 has thou not known has Donald heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fainted not Anita is wary there is no searching of his understanding he given power to defeat unto them that have no mind he increases strength even the youths shall fiend and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as equals they shall run and not be very they should walk and not faint Isaiah 64. this for for since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear neither had the eye seen o God seisty what he had prepared for him that waited for him let us pray heavenly father I thank you Lord for the scriptures tonight and I pray you would interpret it to our heart Lord you know what Isaiah 40 means to me as a Young Man 17 18 years old and when you thunder that into my soul prayed and asked you to make me a young man that will beat on you and God is truly power in waiting on the Lord father made that power coming here tonight in Revelation inspiration and activate the desire of God in every heart granted Father and Jesus name I ask it oh praise the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord well I see this we um I I'll be working on a message but this came to me and I said I'll bring that this bring this tonight the title I have tonight is perfection waiting on God and waiting for God I have an inspiration the power of waiting on the Lord now Isaiah 40 is special to me um a young man so passionate about the scriptures and about a message and about reading and studying the word and I stumbled on that scripture thee that wait upon the Lord but that part the part that got me as a young man is when the scriptures say even young men shall faint and utterly fool now you know the Bible said I call you young men because you're strong so when I saw that that was rocking for me how could young men who's supposed to be strong fall even young men shall faint about before but they that weed so my prayer to God was Lord make me a young man that would wait on you that will return you I know Brothers wanted to get wife for me and everything I said don't go there don't go there go with and God's choosing on time and that's how it woke up with his Armory so I thank God for that tonight so I have a context scripture from James 1 I think about Anthony Struck it my brethren is verse two counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the train of your feet Wicked patience but let patients have a perfect work that you may be perfect an entire wanting nothing so genes give the key of what is about these trials and testings and these things we can't explain how we don't understand he call it when you fall in Dives and temptations knowing this the trying of your faith is what work patients nothing else your faith had to be tried to work patients the trying of your faith you have faith God had to try that to work patients what that is for for patients to have a perfect work what are these four that will be perfect so to come to Perfection you have to come to the child of your feet that patience can have its perfect work and patience when you could wait you could wait on God because you waiting on God when you trust him it means of uterus is timing in you you trust his order it means you trust is Providence Oh Glory to God you're not taking things in your own hands oh praise the name of the Lord do you get that tonight it means you're not taking things in your own hand because you trust him who made the promise if you trust him who spoke to you and you know he can't lie oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah praise God job said if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait oh Glory the God is sick he dying he have boils but job said all the days of my appointed time I will I wait

death after here the dead have to be raised the pillar of Fire have to be in the building Jesus is walking Among Us and the shout of the King has to be in the camp or give the Lord a shout at the house we ain't talking about no books and tips we're talking about the shout out of Jesus Christ oh give the Lord some Praises all man will know the spirit of Elijah Don't rest upon Elisha oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah I will wait till my change come that's what job said and he said he said it under trying circumstance it was no easy experience for him it was situation after situation it was condition after condition but he could say I will wait till my change Come Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God Luke 24 49 he said behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endured with power from on high and if they got power from high we can get power from below Oh Glory to God we can have no power we can only attacking power because that has spoken word books to hand out power handing out tracks and in all tapes we have to have power from on high same Penny same pay same power same vision same witness of the spirit could I hear him and tonight oh glory to God who said these words are Jesus it's in red behold I send you the promise of my father o Glory will go upon you glory to God upon you it has to come upon you he

men Hallelujah Glory to God it's got to be read for since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the air neither had I seen go God beside he what he had prepared for him that waited for him the Amplified of that scripture says for from of all no one has heard no perceived by the air nor has the eyes seen a god besides you who works and shows himself active on behalf of him who earnestly waits for him Oh Glory to God do women see that yet men are going to wait oh hallelujah oh praise God for the brown talk there's some things that have to be he said my father's uh I go

Lord no always exists praise God hallelujah no death exists it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there oh God we can close off right here tonight oh glory to God yeah spoken book to get there no yeah let us go on to Perfection or give the Lord some Praises you have to be perfect to get there the Bible said so Jesus said be there for perfect imagine it's perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride with that one just tripped me out you must be a perfect bride God I have as is you no you're looking what no you have to be a perfect bride or give the Lord some Praises so how can you do it to anything else but the perfect word of God which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody word amen your blood we call it the dripping bloody word I love that at night that song is so old-fashioned you don't hear much about that you know people speaking of mysteries and things but this bloody word the blood the word god bleeding blood to wash the bride in she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place she was trapped in it therefore the pride will be justified right we finally call we call it Justified we Justified he had already glorified who gave the Lord some Praises Hallelujah from the church agencies I know your faith no he does not say here as he did to the church in pilgrimage you hold my feet he's not talking about his feet no he is commending them for their faithfulness and he does as he does he also mentioned their patience no faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for it says in James 1 3 the Trine of your faith work Wicked patience there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of your feet Romans 5 3 scripture tribulation worker patience for Oklahoma tribulation is the team that has worked patients you want patience to have this perfect work then only tribulation is worth that okay the Lord some Praises I'll figure out some bright members here tonight because I hear you're saying amen do not pulling back you're not holding back you're not looking behind you say who who are you talking to you know what you were talking to oh God you know you can say Amen to the word tribulation work at patience or glory to God how highly God regardless of working of our patience is seen in James 1 4 but that patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect an entire lacking nothing here we go are you ready God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God oh glory to God this is the process of character development joining other churches ever make a bride Oh Glory to call if you are thief in this church you'll be a thief in any church if you're crooked here you'll cook it everywhere else you have to get a change inside to be bride okay the Lord has shout Oh Glory to God changing trust membership to make you Pride Oh Glory Days Are church and there's a pride and the pride will be called out at the church the church members that's what they are but you are called to make yourself ready oh God did you get that did you get that did you get that his wife had made herself so talk ready Oh Glory to God you have the ability to take the clothes of the word and just yourself that's what being made ready taking the clues of the word he said God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and written for God this is the process of character development how highly God has commended these sins of the Dark Ages patient as Lambs led to the slaughter lovingly Faithfully deceived God that is all they wanted out of life just service to the Lord how great was their reward okay questions and answers on Hebrews talk to eternal life has no end because it had no beginning it never can die because it never was born it has no beginning of these it has no ending of time now the only way that we can live eternally is through receiving something that is eternal and God was before there was anything it was God God never had a beginning on end now God was this great spirit we pictured him the seven colors of the rainbow the bull would actually cover the Earth if it didn't strike the Earth it's just a water in a circle of the curvature of the earth that makes it no God is eternal and he was perfect so but Obama is drilling don't know perfect love perfect peace peace perfect Joy perfect all all doors seven spirits as we get in Revelation they come out was made of God was perfection so what is he saying he is saying Elohim spirit was perfection Elohim spirit that Perfection expressed which was the thought which was the gene was the mind of God Express itself as logos would in the beginning was the word but before the beginning was seven perfect Spirits Elohim spirit that is where we were in God's mind that's where we was in God thinking that's where Satan can't go back to because he only come in the beginning but we were before the beginning we were in God's mind as thoughts okay the Lord has shout so to go back to that Perfection we have to go back to seven spirits that means the seven spirits the Dynamics to the metallics or glory to God glory to God do you get it now let's say it again perfect love perfect please Perfect Joy perfect satisfaction all those seven spirits as beginning Revelation they come out was made up of perfection everything else outside of that has been something I've been provided from that everything that's why the brightest second Peter 1 4-7 and everything else is opposite that oh Gloria when you strip the bride it was his second Peter 147 you receive Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience cogginess broadly kindness hallelujah what was reflected to seven angels gonna be rebuilt in a pride that's why the pride cannot be stopped that's why she'll be an invincible around me because every day every time the enemy come like a flood the spirit of God raised a standard what can the Lord and Shout in every age god with a standard the ox anointing the man Anointed The Eagle anointed the land anointed in every age God will understand them I can't see enemy we Never Was Defeated God Never Was Defeated Never Was Defeated in any age Oh Glory the court no wonder a songwriter said say it of our fathers living still in spite of fire dungeon and sword or glory to God hallelujah faith of all our fathers is living still okay the Lord some Praises oh hallelujah hallelujah Glory glory to God thank you Lord let's go them further now the only way that we could come back to Perfection is to come back with that perfection which is God which which is what the seven perfect spirits so somehow this bride by the clients have to come from this weird weird and we have to connect with the spirit because the argument with Lucifer is in the beginning when you go before the beginning he can argue he can't talk you have to shut up because you know nothing back there where was there when I lay the foundation of the Earth and the moon is that I sang together and the sons of God showed it for Joy answer me answer me Oh Glory the God be shout back there we're gonna shout down here oh give the Lord some praises before he had a problem before he had asked you you were shouting and praising and worshiping your God in the back part of his mind that's why he can slay the lamb and the back part of his mind or glory to God and put your name in their blood section the lamb section cannot be erased Hallelujah let me see them you see why the devil don't want to go you see why the preachers in them don't want to go there they have a fight with that channel them Seven Virtues them seven voices them seven Thunders oh God they can't handle that but we're staying right there I will wait till my change come he said this being when it's completed it's the servant of God in the Church of God that's going in the Rapture Oh Glory the Gloria trouble no Mysteries here talk about the nice forward message he said this being when it's completed oh give the Lord I shout Oh Glory that God is the servant of God in the Church of God that going in the rapture if it's not completed he is remaining with the Saints I call them with the tribulation sins they will get comfort from those ministers then Hallelujah not comfortable they will get Blues but Adam's sins go rise up and see you hypocrite why didn't tell me where you're supposed to tell me why don't tell me about the oil about the Holy Ghost about Revival how are you leaving this condition here that I said cry out that they said no I have to make myself ready I thought you had to give me a wafer and make me ready I thought you had the money no no he coming to last three and a half years of judgment is a tribulation yes the pigs bombs and nuclear Fanning and pestilence earthquakes and heartaches you talk about Sorrows Hallelujah but Jesus prophesied this gospel

our message in church not that this gospel be preached and then the end shall come how shall you preach without a preacher how can he preach but how can being sent so God promised himself once who Glory that God in this last day as my father sent me glory to God so send by you how did the father send him the father that was sending went inside of him okay the Lord our prayers that's why he said the pillar of fire will dwell in the adopted son this faithful ministry will be adopted Sons on display no devil move until we say so oh give the Lord some praise Glory let's continue perseverance prophecy I believe that there's a church coming into that perfection that Ministry of perfection that's what we call the ministry of Jesus Christ not just all knowing this like that brother Ministry and I don't know the ministry of perfection we're apostles Prophets teachers pastors boundaries for the Perfection of the Saints them pastors and teachers and so forth will be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the Lord I believe that I believe we are nearing that time now I believe it is so those pastors Jesus Prophet will be so with what with Brothers but Apostles always hope no so with the word not not who they associate with you know if they're with the word how do you prove on my holy test a man but how is his with the word not who he friending with

Glory to God what you have is yours come on come on now the devil have no permission to take what is yours what God gave you God gave you that was a liar you can't come and rub you or what God gave you oh give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah praise God he said he had heard that cries and the groans and the prayers they were only written God was waiting on them he had his Prophet order in the wilderness but he's waiting for the people to call him on the action 40 years Moses out here waiting God has signal let me yeah because people are ready yet but when is that I cry God said listen time up you know lights at the flash on top of the mountain till a fire come down to towards attention because the people crying out no the whole Glory that God he said okay now God have this manner God right there standing already you know but the people have to be ready for it who glory to God and God said well let me continue reading I believe he's got the same thing today watch God was waiting on them he had his Prophet out in the wilderness but he was only waiting for the people to call him into action and I believe you got the same thing today waiting for his church to call it into on the scene he said so so he can act the promise of the day is ready but he has got to get the people to pray in and groaning like that down there then it will come on the scene Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah I have not seen heirs have not heard what God will do for the man that's going to wait on him or glory to God hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Jesus but Abraham says isn't it strange that God wants the people to be patented Jesus said look out any Harvest Harvest is Right labors of you you pray the Lord of the Harvest you pray to me that I will send labels into my Harvest it is some part you have to do God is waiting for his church to call on him he's always there that God has written today for the people to call his servants the action and the servant can't get into action till the people pray now this is powerful because he said no minutes like a bigger Revival the Republicans that come by the people so if I present myself as the man of the hour and the only man and the right man what do you get you could sit back on your laurels and you'll wait for your wafer but you have to understand he said right to vision habakkuk make it clean that he that read it could run so brother Branham came and wrote the vision and a five-fold Ministry come to make it plain that's you the people could see it read it understand it and act on it if you're not running something is wrong you better run for your life you better run into the Holy Ghost you better run for Revival Oh Glory to God you hear it you recognize it and they're gonna act on it Oh Glory to culture God is waiting today for the people to call his servants into action and the servant can't get into action until the people pray he said no watch Israel could not get into action down there with signs and wonders until they fell on their face and prayed for deliverer God had his deliverer God had a prophet hanging up their novenness Captain there for 40 years waiting for them to get right to pray so the longer they say the praise the Lord but when they got right and start praying I like that when you get it right so you see when they get a room you're not breathing when they get right just out of my brain yeah so all do not bring something wrong still silly wood he said when they got Right and started praying so anytime you're getting right they will start to pray that's a good one when you're getting right it was not to pray when you're on the wrong side you're watching Facebook and what's that then God sent the deliverer God will do the same thing today if the people will just get together and get the praying that's why we want to push for Saturday five and six power one Dynamic no exaltation no nothing being read just come and pump praise God and Christ unto God one hour Oh Glory to God hallelujah thank you Lord traditions in them days the great prophet cried and said you all Traditions are powerless they stink before me have no faith in them the people was offering this offering without even having a fit what they were doing now let's just ask yourself the question isn't that something like today as bad as we hate the seed we have got to face facts somewhere there is something wrong somewhere he said why this just ought to be a million miles up the road the way it is now Jesus is waiting on his church to get ready and he called the scripture is bright has made itself ready we got the potentials God is here the power to heal the sick the power to do all these things that Christ did I have seen it demonstrated Myself by the holy spirit so the potentials is here what God is waiting for us to get away from is our tradition and come back under the blood of his son Jesus Christ I like that you know watch your body blood you know watch and become the Church of the Living God well I put that in red here I go see it bright come under the blood and become what no the church of Hope of the Living God that means he's alive inside that church oh Chloe the god that's not about just a name we don't become in the Church of the Living God isn't that right Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran whatever more whosoever will may come and take of the water freely I believe that is what is in Me God has sent down the Holy Spirit to do that oh my but what about failure to wait what happens how does that work out and I have an example here of Samuel no not Samuel sorry Soul Samuel 13 and this is this is um Saul reading one year this is Samuel verse one that's it quickly sorry in one year and when he had written two years over his arrest so there's two years into his Reign so I'll choose him three thousand men of Israel 2000 will in Seoul in mismatch and among the tel and a toast with Jonathan and gibia Benjamin and so on I'll skip that right nice verse two let's go down verse five so Saul found himself two years into his ministry into Israel as kingship in back of the Philistines five and the Philistines got themselves together to fight with Israel had six thousand words man people as the sun which is of the seashore and multitude they came up and bitching when the men of Israel saw that they were in a street for the people with distress and that means when this managers show that they're in a tight situation for the truths were oppressed they hid themselves in caves and tickets and rocks and high places Olympics Israel going into hiding when they say the amount of fellow science some of the Hebrews went over Jordan land of God and Gilead as for Saul he was written and all the people followed him trembling as well as a shaky situation yeah he tarried seven days according to the set time that son had appointed but Samuel came not to giggle and the people were scattered from him and Saul said bring hidden to me on a peace offering and he offered the point of him and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of the offering the bullet offering behold Samuel came Saul went out to meet him that he might salute him and Samuel said what has thou done Saul said because I saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou came is not within the days appointed and that the Philistines gather themselves together admit much therefore said I the Philistines will come down now upon meter Giga and I have not made a supplication unto the Lord I forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering no Samuel is a man to do that but Saul took things in his own hand because he finds Samuel A coming on time he couldn't wait Samuel said to Saul that was done foolishly there was not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God which he commanded tea for now would the Lord have established their Kingdom for Israel forever but now thy kingdom shall not continue the Lord had sought him a man after his own heart and the Lord had commanded him to be Captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the Lord commanded thee Oh my Hallelujah soil Under Pressure felt he had to do something he couldn't wait any longer Hallelujah so he decided to make the offering himself Oh my he took things in his own hands and that was a disaster for sure my God Hallelujah so just maybe God take this thing about waiting more serious than we think amen and the Bible said they not wait upon the Lord shall we knew their strength we are weak and weak potato bread called a week a week a week but they don't wait shall renew their straight they shall monked up his wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint Oh Glory to God even young men shall fall and utterly faint but Peter wait oh glory to God wait wait on the Lord how much marriages could be different if men had waited people had prayed Oh Glory they call your situations could be different if people had waited waited for God waiting on God Waiting for God oh glory to God hallelujah you see when you take things into your own hands you are saying God I don't trust you I don't trust you can handle it so I have to deal with it myself that's what you're saying you know without saying those words that is what you're expressing by you not waiting upon God you are saying I don't trust you I don't think you could handle it so I am going to handle it myself but you have to believe and know that God will fulfill his word David said I wait for the Lord my soul waits in him do I hope oh blessed be the name of the Lord we think could be very hard Hallelujah you have to wait for God to heal you wait to go to live with your children wait to go to live your spouse where to go to do this and do that and do the other you don't know when you're going to do it but he's going to do it because he promised it Oh Glory to God it is easy to take things at their own hands I'll go speech them out I'll go get them out I go tell him like it is I go do this I'll go do this but have you ask have you waited oh praise the name of the Lord almost finished Hallelujah so Saul's life is proof of the era of not waiting Hallelujah decisions made in haste made under stress then you live with regrets because we did not wait on the Lord let's talk about a few men who have waited around 25 years 25 years Sarah can't make no child pass child bearing age and yet he waited not one year not two years but 25 years waiting for that woman Hallelujah which woman Sarah had not Hagan Sarah that she going to bring forth a child Hallelujah when the appointed time oh give the Lord some Praises I will return unto thee according to the time appointed 25 years Joseph had to wait in prison he tell the butler remember me when they get old man forget him he's a lot of weight God wasn't ready for him yet he had to wait in patience you have to wait with a revelation that after all the visions that God gave him that God can't lie and God will make a way to bring him out he said I will wait till my change come David waited years to be appointed king after being pursued by Saul David Daniel waited in prayer until the angel broke through Jesus waited 18 years from 12 to 30 to get into his ministry okay the Lord some praises I'm almost done praise God the Holy Spirit told the prophet pick up the pen and write he said let us time like Joshua and Caleb now watch close this is going to have a spiritual background let us stand like Joshua and Caleb as we see the promised land coming in sight it's nearing the time to begin on just when Hebrew means savior represent the end time leader to take the church over Caleb represent the True Believer who stayed with Joshua God started Israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so did the last the church notice now God did not move Israel until his own appointed time now listen this is going to mean something Joshua waited for that time no matter how much the people might have said God gave us the land let us go now and take it they might have said Joshua you lost a commission you all washed up why are you not doing something you used to do it you knew you used to have to say the Lord in a moment that was the will of God but this wise God sent Prophet knew the promise of God but also knew to wait for that promise a clear-cut decision from God for his time when the time Come Oh Glory to God God give me the Joshua who stayed with him by the word for he could not trust others what he's saying God captures people that don't wait on him okay the Lord our prayers oh give the Lord a shout God is not going to trust don't start not gonna wait on him glory to God a woman in case a fine young clean man before they come together from she's pregnant by somebody else watch her own body which is betrothedral to her boyfriend her engaged husband is found full of seed of another man what a disgrace that's exactly what Adam found that's what Christ found couldn't wait that's what the matter with the people today they can't wait for the real Holy Spirit to take the church in position they have to manufacture something instead of waiting upon the Lord for the real manifestation of the resurrection of Christ making himself known among the people Oh Glory to God so this man adopted in the head he deceived this man is this and this man is this and this is him so he nobody else he's a walking faithful and people believe that crap leave that foolishness that nonsense as if God have you have several years or something so God have air
