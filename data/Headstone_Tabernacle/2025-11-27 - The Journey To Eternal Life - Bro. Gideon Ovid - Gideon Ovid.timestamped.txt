[19:42] Amen.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[19:46] Amen. If you have your Bibles, I'd like
[19:48] you to turn with me to a scripture
[19:50] [music] in the book of Psalms, reading
[19:52] from Psalms 105. Just a few verses
[19:55] there.
[20:00] Just the first four verses of Psalms
[20:01] 105.
[20:07] And it says, "Oh, give thanks unto the
[20:09] Lord. Call upon his name. Make known his
[20:13] deeds among the people. Sing unto him.
[20:16] Sing psalms unto him. Talk ye of all his
[20:19] wondrous works. Glory ye in his holy
[20:22] [music] name. Let the heart of them
[20:24] rejoice and seek the Lord. Seek the Lord
[20:27] and his strength. Seek his face ever
[20:29] more. Amen. Let's just bow our heads.
[20:32] [music]
[20:33] Oh heavenly father, as we come to you
[20:35] tonight, as we have taken this
[20:37] opportunity, Lord, and gather together,
[20:39] Lord, we gather together by faith in
[20:41] your name, Lord, seeking more of you,
[20:43] Lord. Lord, seeking to receive a special
[20:45] touch tonight, Lord, seeking to be
[20:47] blessed tonight, Lord, seeking to be
[20:49] healed and delivered and set free, Lord.
[20:51] Lord, I pray that you have your
[20:52] preeminence over this entire service,
[20:54] Lord. Lord, every song that will be
[20:56] sung, every word that is spoken, Lord,
[20:58] Lord, as we worship and we praise and we
[21:00] cause an atmosphere to be formed, Lord,
[21:02] we pray that your Holy Spirit be pleased
[21:04] to dwell among us, Lord. Lord, I pray
[21:06] that no one will leave here the same way
[21:08] that they came. [music] Lord, I pray
[21:09] that you would be with those that may be
[21:11] connected on the internet, wherever they
[21:13] are right now, Lord, in their homes, in
[21:14] the jobs, wherever, Lord, those that may
[21:16] even connect afterwards and may see it.
[21:18] I pray that your presence will flow out
[21:21] and meet them. Meet them at the point of
[21:23] their need, Lord. touch their lives,
[21:25] touch their hearts, touch their minds
[21:26] tonight, [music] Lord. We don't gather
[21:28] in vain, Lord. We don't just gather

[21:32] Lord, but we want to be faithful to you,
[21:33] Lord. Lord, we want to fellowship and
[21:36] speak about you, Lord. We want to talk
[21:37] about you. We want to think on you,
[21:39] Lord. Lord, I pray that you bless your
[21:41] people gather in your house tonight,
[21:43] Lord, with a special blessing, Lord.
[21:45] Bless the musician, the singers, the
[21:46] worshippers, [music] everyone, Lord, the
[21:49] speaker tonight. Lord, I pray that you
[21:50] would have your perfect will in and
[21:52] through our lives. In Jesus name we
[21:54] pray. Amen.
[21:56] You love him tonight.
[21:58] Amen. Let's sing that song. Leave your

[33:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, lamb of God. Blessed be his
[33:14] wonderful [music] name.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; This time, I just want to switch over to
[33:23] [music] to the word. If you have your
[33:25] Bibles, I'd like you to turn with me to
[33:27] the book of Matthew.
[33:32] Thank you, musicians.
[33:34] Matthew reading from chapter 19 from
[33:38] verse 16. Very familiar scripture like
[33:41] us to explore this evening.
[33:53] from Matthew 19:16. And it says, "And
[33:56] behold, one came and said unto him, good
[33:59] master,
[34:01] what good thing shall I do that I may
[34:04] have eternal life?" And he said unto
[34:07] him, Why callst thou me good? There is
[34:10] none good but one, that is God. But if
[34:13] thou wilt enter into life, keep the
[34:15] commandments. He said unto him, "Which,"
[34:18] Jesus said, "Thou shalt do no murder.
[34:21] Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou
[34:24] shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear
[34:25] false witness. Honor thy father and thy
[34:27] mother, and thou shalt love thy neighbor
[34:30] as thyself." In verse 20, the young man
[34:33] said unto him, "All these things have I
[34:35] kept from my youth up. [snorts] What
[34:38] lack I yet?" Jesus said unto him, "If
[34:41] thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that
[34:44] thou hast and give to the poor, and thou
[34:47] shalt have treasure in heaven, and come
[34:50] and follow me." But when the young man
[34:52] heard that saying, he went away
[34:54] sorrowful, for he had great possessions.
[34:57] Let's just bow our heads a word of
[34:59] prayer. Oh heavenly father, Lord, this
[35:02] evening we've gathered together, Lord,
[35:04] and we've read your scripture, Lord.
[35:05] We've read your word, Lord. Lord, your
[35:08] spoken word that you have laid out for
[35:10] us, Lord. And we want to fellowship
[35:12] around your word, Lord. Lord, I pray
[35:14] that you would breathe life, Lord. I
[35:15] pray that you would use me as a
[35:17] instrument of just communication
[35:19] tonight, Lord. But you'll take me out of
[35:21] the way, Lord, and you'll speak lip to
[35:22] air to your people, Lord. I pray that
[35:25] some life, some heart, some mind be
[35:27] renewed, that some somebody will be
[35:28] changed and be made better off, Lord,
[35:31] because of the words that would have
[35:33] been shared, Lord. Lord, I pray that you
[35:35] would take the the few thoughts and and
[35:36] and and the scriptures, Lord, and you
[35:38] would would open it up to us, Lord, that
[35:40] we could receive all that you have in
[35:42] store for us tonight, Lord. Lord, I pray
[35:45] that you will have your perfect will
[35:47] tonight. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[35:50] You may have your seats.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessed be his name. You
[35:54] know, for a title,
[35:57] the journey to eternal life. Amen.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; And for inspiration, what lacets coming
[36:03] out of this scripture we just read.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; And this scripture is a powerful
[36:09] scripture. It's very familiar
[36:12] time. We refer to this as the story of
[36:14] the rich young ruler.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; And just to recap a little bit, you
[36:20] don't have to find it, but we just read
[36:21] the scripture. I just want to highlight
[36:23] a couple things that we just went
[36:25] through from verse 16. It says, "And
[36:28] behold, one came and said unto him, good
[36:30] master." So clearly this young man knew
[36:34] who he was speaking with.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; He knew who he was addressing. He had
[36:38] manners. He had respects. Some may say
[36:40] he had discipline that he came and he
[36:44] said unto him, "Good master," and
[36:46] referred to him as such.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; He also said, "What good thing shall I
[36:50] do that I may have eternal life?"
[36:53] So he acknowledged at this point that he
[36:56] believed that there was something he had
[36:58] to do
[36:59] &gt;&gt; in order to have eternal life.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; It also highlights the fact that eternal
[37:04] life was important to him
[37:06] &gt;&gt; because he saw the need to inquire about
[37:09] it.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; We don't inquire about things that don't
[37:11] impact our lives that are not meaningful
[37:13] to us.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; So he knew he was addressing the master.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; And he knew he wanted eternal life. That
[37:21] was his end goal.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; He was on the journey to get there
[37:26] &gt;&gt; and he wanted some advice and he
[37:28] believed he had part of the answer
[37:30] already cuz he knew it's not by bad
[37:32] works. It's not by lying and cheating.
[37:35] He said what good thing shall I do?
[37:38] &gt;&gt; So I know something is required of me. I
[37:40] just want clarity on what it is.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; So he said what good thing? And then it
[37:44] went on and he said unto him, why callst
[37:47] thou me good? And this was Jesus
[37:48] answering, "There is not good but one
[37:50] that is God, but if thou will enter into
[37:52] life and keep the commandments." So
[37:55] Jesus in this instance responded to him
[37:58] and give him an answer.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Told him these are the things you need
[38:01] to do. If you want to enter into life,
[38:04] you need to keep the commandments.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Now in the message, we learn that Jesus
[38:09] was only testing him. You know, was
[38:10] trying to see what was going on with
[38:12] him.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew what was in his heart, but he
[38:15] wanted to see how he would respond.
[38:17] Yeah. So he wanted to see his religious
[38:19] background and and how grounded he was
[38:22] &gt;&gt; and as expected in verse 18 he said
[38:26] which which commandments. So clearly he
[38:28] knew the commandments which
[38:31] &gt;&gt; so he wasn't ignorant. He wasn't what
[38:34] what do you mean when you say
[38:35] commandments? Exactly what you're trying
[38:36] to express. No he wasn't like that.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; He knew they were commandments and he
[38:40] knew he kept all but he wanted to be
[38:43] certain. He knew exactly which one was
[38:46] required of him.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; This was how specific he was. He said
[38:50] which Jesus said.
[38:53] You know it already. Thou shalt do no
[38:55] murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery.
[38:57] Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not
[38:58] bear false witness. Honor thy father and
[39:00] thy mother. Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[39:02] as thyself. And the young man said unto
[39:04] him almost as if to interrupt him and
[39:07] says, listen, you see all the things you
[39:09] went through there.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I have kept those from my youth
[39:13] up.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; What lacker yet?
[39:18] &gt;&gt; But before he was trying to send a clear
[39:20] message to Jesus that listen when I mark
[39:23] my papers is 10 out of 10.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; All ten commandments in order
[39:28] &gt;&gt; full marks.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; If he had to mark himself 10 out of 10.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Many of times just like us sometimes if
[39:34] we look at ourselves we believe we are
[39:36] right.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; We believe we do good. Amen.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; We believe that we've done done enough.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; We we we believe that we just in limbo.
[39:44] We just waiting because we finished
[39:45] everything already.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; But sometimes in tests, you need to
[39:48] check over.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; You need to review. You might know it,
[39:51] you know,
[39:52] &gt;&gt; but you might make a little mistake.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; So it's important is it's an important
[39:57] part of the process to to review
[40:00] &gt;&gt; to check over per adventure. You might
[40:02] be missing something.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Just in case you may have left something
[40:06] out. So in this case he said all these
[40:10] things all the commandments you call
[40:11] there all of them
[40:13] &gt;&gt; I have done this from my youth meaning I
[40:17] was taught this as a child
[40:18] &gt;&gt; that's right
[40:19] &gt;&gt; amen
[40:20] &gt;&gt; so it's not a a now come thing
[40:23] &gt;&gt; essentially I born in church
[40:25] &gt;&gt; I grew up in the message I know the
[40:27] scriptures I know the quotes
[40:30] &gt;&gt; what is wrong with me
[40:33] &gt;&gt; what more I need to do
[40:35] &gt;&gt; to have eternal
[40:37] Amen.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; So he's in this processing of checking
[40:41] himself against the requirement
[40:44] &gt;&gt; and in his eyes he's all right
[40:47] &gt;&gt; but he's still asking so we can say he's
[40:49] humble enough to say
[40:51] &gt;&gt; what I really missing
[40:52] &gt;&gt; what I miss here
[40:54] &gt;&gt; I come to church I early I sing I play
[40:57] music I do all kind of thing I give
[40:59] charity I treat my neighbor all right I
[41:02] good with my family and my friends
[41:04] everybody have good things to say about
[41:06] me. What could be wrong with me?
[41:09] &gt;&gt; What could I be missing? What's the
[41:11] missing link or missing piece that I
[41:13] don't have this eternal life
[41:16] &gt;&gt; that I heard about?
[41:18] &gt;&gt; I don't have this Holy Ghost that I
[41:20] heard preach about.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; I don't have the token that I read about
[41:24] in the message. What is missing?
[41:26] &gt;&gt; This is the point he was at. And Jesus
[41:29] said unto him in verse 21, he said, "If
[41:31] thou wil be perfect,
[41:33] &gt;&gt; essentially perfection is necessary to
[41:36] access this eternal life."
[41:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "Go and sell that thou hast
[41:41] &gt;&gt; and give to the poor, and thou shalt
[41:44] have treasure in heaven and come and
[41:46] follow me." Now, there's three things
[41:48] there
[41:49] &gt;&gt; in Jesus statement.
[41:52] He says, "Go and sell." That's the first
[41:55] part.
[41:56] He said, "Give to the poor." That's the
[41:59] second part.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Come and follow me."
[42:03] &gt;&gt; That's the third part.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; And in the next verse, we'll come back
[42:07] to that. And in the next verse, he said,
[42:09] "When the young man heard that saying,
[42:12] essentially when he was given the advice
[42:14] or the instruction,
[42:16] he went away sorrowful
[42:20] &gt;&gt; for he had great possessions."
[42:22] &gt;&gt; And that's the end of the scripture that
[42:24] we would have read. But in terms of the
[42:28] the lessons to be gained outside of all
[42:32] the things already highlighted, I just
[42:33] want to delve a little deeper in terms
[42:36] of the things we highlighted.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus told him to sell.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; What does it mean to sell? Not by
[42:43] definition, but to sell really is to
[42:47] give up.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Give up the things you work hard to
[42:50] build.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Give up the things that you're so proud
[42:54] about.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. the titles and the accolades and
[42:57] the achievement and all the good stuff
[42:59] that people have to say about you.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus told him to give it up.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Give it up.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Let it go.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Release it.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Give it away.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Don't focus on that. Don't bother with
[43:10] it.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's no longer important to
[43:13] say you know who I am. I am I am Mr.
[43:16] This. I am the CEO of that. I am in
[43:18] charge and I'm respons. Give up all
[43:20] that.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Sell it. liquidate it.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Dump it.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Get rid of it.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; He also went and he said give
[43:31] and it's one thing to sell. It's one
[43:32] thing to have. And this is not against
[43:34] wealth or money or riches. But when he
[43:37] said give,
[43:39] he meant give of the proceeds of the
[43:41] sales. So he said sell and give to the
[43:43] poor.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Give to those who need.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Give to those who are less fortunate.
[43:49] Give to those who are unable to give you
[43:51] back.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Don't give without expectation.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Cuz he specifically said, not just give,
[43:58] don't give to the foundation and the
[44:00] charities. He said, give to the poor,
[44:02] &gt;&gt; the ones that are helpless,
[44:04] &gt;&gt; the ones that are in need the most,
[44:07] &gt;&gt; and to give. When I looked at it, it
[44:10] means to contribute more,
[44:12] &gt;&gt; to do more,
[44:14] &gt;&gt; to be more,
[44:15] &gt;&gt; to really allow yourself to become
[44:18] selfless and less selfish.
[44:21] to care for others,
[44:23] &gt;&gt; to have empathy.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; So Jesus was asking him, listen, I know
[44:28] you did all this stuff. If we had to
[44:30] look at it in black and white, probably
[44:33] got 10 out of 10, but when I look a
[44:35] little deeper,
[44:36] &gt;&gt; yes,
[44:37] &gt;&gt; I realize there are some things that we
[44:39] still need to address that you may have
[44:41] overlooked the first time.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; So he say, I want you to be able to go
[44:45] the extra mile.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; That's what it is to give. So to give is
[44:50] to become uncomfortable.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; So it's not just the norm. It is not
[44:55] giving because you your your you want to
[44:59] say that you give or for PR you want it
[45:01] to look good. So I want to pat myself on
[45:03] the back and say I give. No. But he said
[45:06] as an instruction to give to the poor
[45:09] &gt;&gt; to show that it's more than you. It's
[45:11] more than your needs and and and and
[45:14] just what you think and feel but to do a
[45:16] little more. And the last thing he said
[45:18] was to follow.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; And this is where we get a lot of
[45:21] problems.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Follow.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Follow.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Cuz you're trained in your mind that you
[45:26] want to lead.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Even my my daughter is five and she'll
[45:29] say, "I want to do it myself.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; I want to do it for myself.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; She don't want to guide her and push
[45:37] her. She wants to do it for herself."
[45:39] And and innately almost we feel this
[45:41] need to just do.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; But to follow is to seek advice.
[45:46] Amen.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; To follow is to allow others to lead.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; To follow is to take guidance
[45:54] &gt;&gt; perhaps from those who've done it
[45:55] before.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; That's what it means to follow.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; So following doesn't necessarily make
[46:00] you weak.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; But it makes you smart
[46:03] &gt;&gt; because you don't have to make the
[46:05] mistakes that others would have made.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; So when he said follow me, it means
[46:10] follow the lessons and the guidance and
[46:11] the wisdom that I am in a position to
[46:13] impart onto you.
[46:17] But as we know the scripture said he
[46:19] went away
[46:20] &gt;&gt; sorrowful.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; But suggest to us listen this was a
[46:24] little too much to ask.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; It was a little too much to ask you to
[46:28] give a little more. It was a little too
[46:30] much like Lot's wife to say forget that.
[46:34] Forget about it. Move on. Keep it
[46:37] moving. Press on. I know you work hard
[46:40] to establish yourself in this circle or
[46:43] in this group, but are you willing to
[46:45] give it up?
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Are you willing to walk away? Are you
[46:49] willing to let go? Are you willing to go
[46:51] beyond yourself and help those that
[46:53] cannot help you?
[46:55] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; This was the challenge of the rich young
[46:59] ruler on his journey to eternal life
[47:03] &gt;&gt; because that's what he wanted. That was
[47:04] his desire. He desired to achieve that
[47:07] which is why he inquired what I should
[47:10] do? What good thing should I do in order
[47:13] to get that?
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; And although the answer may have seemed
[47:16] simple, it was a tough decision for him
[47:20] because in the last verse it say he had
[47:22] great possessions.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Now think think about it for the man who
[47:27] don't have you tell him sell everything
[47:30] you have.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; He don't have anything to sell. He don't
[47:33] have any sacrifice. He has no real
[47:36] burden. He has no loss or hurt to be
[47:40] gained by doing that. But for the man
[47:42] with great possessions, with great
[47:44] titles, with great accolades and
[47:46] achievements,
[47:48] &gt;&gt; it becomes a test. It becomes a trial to
[47:51] move past that.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; So Jesus indeed obviously knew what he
[47:55] was doing. Yes.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus was shaking him up a little bit,
[47:59] &gt;&gt; giving him a reality check,
[48:01] &gt;&gt; that despite how you look on the
[48:02] outside, it was more important the way
[48:05] it looks on the inside because he said,
[48:09] "When you do this, you will have
[48:11] treachers in heaven."
[48:14] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what your neighbor
[48:16] think about it, you know, it doesn't
[48:17] matter if they impressed or not.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; But we also have to be conscious of what
[48:23] is really important.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; So, I want to shift gears a little bit
[48:29] and talk about the other rich young
[48:30] ruler. For in the Bible, they talk about
[48:33] two rich young rulers. Amen.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; One rich young ruler was the one we read
[48:39] about just now. And the next rich young
[48:42] ruler was Moses.
[48:45] And in a message, I believe leadership,
[48:48] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham talked about the other
[48:49] rich young ruler.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; He was just as young.
[48:54] He was powerful.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; He was wealthy.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; He was heir to the throne.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; He had the ability to do things that the
[49:03] average person couldn't.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; He had the ability to tell one go and he
[49:08] will go and come and so on. He had a
[49:11] nice title.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; He had nice achievements and accolades
[49:16] in terms of the things he had
[49:18] accomplished. He went to the best
[49:20] schools. He had great tutors, great
[49:23] teachers. He graduated first class
[49:26] honors, top of the class
[49:29] &gt;&gt; cuz they had to be trained. He was next
[49:31] in line to be Pharaoh.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; But you know what?
[49:38] &gt;&gt; He choose
[49:41] &gt;&gt; and he refused to be called the son of
[49:43] Pharaoh's daughter.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; He give it up.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; He say here what you see the title
[49:47] you're throwing on me.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; I don't want that. Amen.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; He say choosing rather to suffer the
[49:54] afflictions of God,
[49:56] &gt;&gt; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[49:58] treasures
[49:59] &gt;&gt; than all the treasures of Egypt.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; So this tells you it's possible
[50:04] [applause]
[50:05] &gt;&gt; to follow the leadership of God.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; And see doors open
[50:10] &gt;&gt; and see that journey become a little
[50:12] easier
[50:13] &gt;&gt; as we traverse this life
[50:16] &gt;&gt; unto eternal life.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:19] Hallelujah.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; In that message, brother goes on to say,
[50:21] listen,
[50:23] Moses esteemed at the greatest. Now,
[50:26] this rich man didn't Moses was a rich
[50:29] young ruler to become Pharaoh.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; And it went on. They say, "By faith, he
[50:34] saw the promise of God through the word
[50:36] &gt;&gt; that his people would sjourn in a
[50:38] strange land for 400 years, but would be
[50:40] brought out by a mighty hand, and he
[50:42] esteemed that, hallelujah, greater
[50:45] riches than all the treasures of Egypt.
[50:48] for he forsook Egypt not knowing where
[50:50] he was going.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; I said sometimes when you follow it
[50:55] feels uncomfortable.
[50:56] Sometimes when you sell and you give and
[50:58] you decide, I'm going to make this move
[51:01] by faith, it might feel strange,
[51:04] &gt;&gt; but Moses did it.
[51:08] And he was led by Christ
[51:11] for the reproach of Christ, the reproach
[51:14] to be called a odd one to be called that
[51:17] fanatic to take his place with the mud
[51:19] dubbers and the fanatics because he seen
[51:22] at that hour that the scripture was
[51:24] promised to be fulfilled.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Was there then an old church wake up?
[51:28] Can't you see the same thing tonight?
[51:31] The hour that's been promises on us
[51:33] esteem the reproach of Jesus Christ
[51:36] greater riches than all the fellowship
[51:38] of anything. If it takes father and
[51:40] mother church anything else follow the
[51:43] leadership of the spirit. Let us follow
[51:46] this Christ for a few this Moses for a
[51:49] little while that did that. Let's watch
[51:51] his life. The first thing when he had
[51:53] accepted to take the reproach of Christ
[51:55] and forsake his education, forsake all
[51:58] of his wisdom, he was taught in all the
[52:01] wisdom of the Egyptians and all of his
[52:03] popularity, his throne, his scepter, his
[52:06] kingship, his crown, everything he had,
[52:08] he rejected it.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; That's the other rich young ruler. Amen.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; But I asked myself, why? Why was that
[52:16] important?
[52:18] &gt;&gt; We could have learned the lesson from
[52:19] the rich young ruler that walked away.
[52:21] Yes,
[52:22] &gt;&gt; but this highlighted that it's possible
[52:24] for you to do it.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; It's possible for us to achieve that.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Mind you, it didn't say he forget
[52:30] everything he learned and he became a
[52:33] fool. But he rejected the education
[52:35] system. He rejected his passion. He
[52:38] rejected the styles. He rejected the
[52:40] music. And he decided to follow Jesus.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. He decided to follow the word of
[52:45] God
[52:46] &gt;&gt; because God promised to take them out
[52:48] after sjouring in this strange land.
[52:50] Amen.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; And and in the scripture it said, you
[52:53] know, the devil is like a roaring lion
[52:56] &gt;&gt; seeking who he could devour.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; So the devil have plans for you, you
[53:01] know.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; If you don't have plans for yourself, he
[53:04] have plans for you.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; He looking for the chinks, the
[53:07] weaknesses,
[53:08] &gt;&gt; the imperfections.
[53:10] He looking to make sure you could lose
[53:12] marks on this exam.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; He making sure that you're weakened.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; He don't want you strong at all. Why?
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Imagine Simon after walking with Jesus
[53:23] for three and a half years.
[53:25] Jesus in the book of Luke, he said,
[53:28] "Behold, Satan has desired to sift you
[53:30] like wheat."
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; This is after walking with Christ for
[53:34] three and a half years.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; He desired to sift you like wheat.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I prayed for thee
[53:41] &gt;&gt; that thy faith fail not
[53:43] &gt;&gt; and when thou art converted strengthen
[53:45] your brethren. Amen.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Now the interesting thing about that is
[53:50] the the example or the words or the
[53:54] illustration used.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; He say the devil don't want to touch you
[53:58] and run away. You know
[54:00] &gt;&gt; he want to sift you like wheat. And if
[54:02] you ever research what sifting like
[54:04] wheat looks like, it's like a big seal
[54:06] that you rock and you shake violently.
[54:10] So imagine the devil want you upside
[54:12] down, inside out. He want to punch you
[54:14] on your head. He want like if you go in
[54:16] the ocean and the wave batter you and
[54:19] you roll over and you're out of control.
[54:21] That's where he want you. And I found
[54:23] out why. Cuz I started to do a little
[54:25] more research. You see, when you're
[54:28] battered and and and bruised and knocked
[54:30] up and and traumatized,
[54:33] it reminded me of those boxers. I
[54:35] remember hearing years ago that boxers
[54:38] have a higher probability of developing
[54:42] not just brain damage, but things like
[54:44] dementia, amnesia, because of the
[54:48] traumatic effects on the brain when they
[54:51] get knocked all over the place. when
[54:53] they box them in the face and in the
[54:54] head and in the mouth and all over. You
[54:57] see, that's what the devil want to do.
[54:59] If you could get amnesia, dementia, you
[55:02] could forget. It means you could get
[55:03] spiritual amnesia. Then you could forget
[55:05] who you are.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Keep in mind, you're the child of the
[55:08] king. You know,
[55:09] &gt;&gt; at the end of the day, he left certain
[55:11] promises for you. And if you forget,
[55:14] [applause]
[55:14] &gt;&gt; the devil is happy, you know.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; But God don't want you forget tonight.
[55:19] God want to remind you
[55:21] &gt;&gt; that listen, I paid a price for you.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Not for you to just walk around with
[55:26] your head down willy-nilly and you're
[55:28] not sure today or tomorrow, but he want
[55:31] you to be more than a conqueror.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; He want you to be victorious because he
[55:35] already won the battle.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:38] [applause]
[55:39] And at the end of the day after we we
[55:41] clap and we sing and we worship and we
[55:43] shake hands and we smile the question
[55:45] has to be asked with which we are all
[55:48] faced. Are you ready to meet God?
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; When it's all said and done
[55:53] &gt;&gt; are you ready to meet him?
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; In the same message you say remember
[56:01] you're going to die someday or either be
[56:03] translated into heaven. Amen. And if you
[56:06] die before his coming, you'll be
[56:07] raptured first. Did you not know that
[56:11] the dead in Christ shall rise? If mama
[56:13] and papa dies before you do, and Jesus
[56:16] doesn't come in our generation, do you
[56:17] know know this? They will come first
[56:19] glorified before you. See,
[56:21] &gt;&gt; the trumpet of God shall sound, and the
[56:23] dead in Christ shall rise first.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; And then we which are alive and remain
[56:30] shall be caught up with them.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; We'll be changed like that. We've got to
[56:34] remember, listen, that's the main thing
[56:36] in life. You understand now? That's the
[56:40] main thing in life we got to do is to
[56:43] get ready to meet God
[56:46] &gt;&gt; after all is said and done.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; After every sermon is is preached and
[56:51] every song is sung,
[56:52] &gt;&gt; we have to understand that the main
[56:55] thing is to make sure you're ready.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Make sure you pass the exam. Make sure
[57:00] you accept. Make sure you check over.
[57:03] Make sure you're confident in the word
[57:05] of God and his promises. And you could
[57:08] know it's not by might nor by power, but
[57:10] by his spirit that you're prepared to
[57:13] meet him.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:16] [applause]
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now
[57:19] in the book of John and we know it,
[57:22] Nicod Nicodemus would have said um he he
[57:26] approached by night
[57:30] and they say he was a man of the
[57:32] Pharisees. He was an important guy. He
[57:34] was a guy with very experience. He had a
[57:37] lot of knowledge. He had a lot of
[57:38] information and he knew what he was
[57:41] doing. He knew what he was talking
[57:42] about. He was a wellrespected guy.
[57:45] And they say he came to Jesus by night
[57:48] under the cover of darkness because he
[57:50] too when he looked over his life
[57:54] &gt;&gt; although he was a a big boy
[57:56] &gt;&gt; although he was well respected
[57:59] &gt;&gt; he realized that listen
[58:01] &gt;&gt; that Jesus is doing some things that
[58:04] very different
[58:06] &gt;&gt; to what I know and I am a big boy.
[58:09] Imagine I am important. I'm well
[58:12] respected
[58:14] and that Jesus is doing some things that
[58:17] I can't really explain. So he said unto
[58:19] him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a
[58:21] teacher come from God."
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Similar to the rich young young ruler,
[58:24] good master.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; So he say, "Rabbi, I know, listen,
[58:27] you're a teacher come from God." So I'
[58:30] given you respects. I want to show you
[58:32] that I know who you are. I recognize
[58:34] you. I am an important man and I want to
[58:36] give you all the the the accolades and
[58:40] all the the titles that I believe should
[58:42] be given to you at this point
[58:44] &gt;&gt; cuz I want you to be able to answer me
[58:46] the way I expect.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; And you say, "No man can do these
[58:50] miracles that thou doest
[58:52] &gt;&gt; except God be with him."
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered unto him, "Verily,
[58:56] verily, I say unto you, except a man be
[58:58] born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
[58:59] God." So, it was about being born again,
[59:02] but he had a question in his heart. He
[59:04] had something he wanted resolved. He
[59:07] wanted a clear answer on his question,
[59:10] his position, and he wanted it in his
[59:13] context. And in verse four, it said,
[59:15] "Nicodemus said unto him, how can a man
[59:17] be born when he's old? Can he enter the
[59:19] second time into his mother's womb and
[59:20] be born?" Jesus answered, "Verily,
[59:22] verily, I say unto you, except a man be
[59:25] born of water and of the spirit, he
[59:26] cannot enter the kingdom of God." So
[59:28] once again, we see Jesus was responding
[59:32] to him and giving him an answer based on
[59:35] the question he asked.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "What do I need?
[59:40] &gt;&gt; I know you're an important man and I
[59:42] realize you said something here that
[59:44] have me a little unsettled.
[59:46] I want some clarity."
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Please give me something more.
[59:53] And when Jesus answered him,
[59:56] he was at the point that it seems
[1:00:00] strange, but he was listening.
[1:00:05] Jesus said, "That which is born of the
[1:00:06] flesh is flesh, and that which is born
[1:00:08] of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that
[1:00:10] I said unto thee, he must be born
[1:00:13] again." So he definitely heard, "This is
[1:00:15] the answer based on what I asked." Once
[1:00:19] again, this was somebody recognizing
[1:00:21] that something was missing.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Something was lacking.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; That I need clarity on because I want to
[1:00:29] fill the gaps.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; I want to fill the void.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; I want to become a whole person.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; So despite my history, despite my
[1:00:38] experience,
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; I wanted to get that. You see, at the
[1:00:42] end of the day, we might say it's part
[1:00:45] of us to desire perfection, but the
[1:00:50] devil job is to shift you out from that.
[1:00:52] You know, the devil's job is to convince
[1:00:54] you that you are right,
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; the devil job is to convince you that
[1:00:59] you've done enough,
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; that you're okay.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; So, he want to interfere with you know,
[1:01:05] but not not too much.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. Cuz if he interfere with you too
[1:01:08] much all of a sudden a standard raised
[1:01:12] up against him and know
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; all of a sudden he have no access to
[1:01:16] your life.
[1:01:18] So
[1:01:19] in the story of the prodigal son I think
[1:01:23] it's relevant to to touch a little bit.
[1:01:26] He too reach a point and you'll realize
[1:01:30] every single character comes to a
[1:01:32] realization that something is not right.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:36] something is lacking.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; I need to fix this part of me or
[1:01:41] something missing.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; As we know in the story itself, two
[1:01:46] sons, he decide I want my inheritance
[1:01:48] now. I pressing on. I'm going to a far
[1:01:50] country and the Bible said he read
[1:01:54] spent it all riotous living. He had a
[1:01:57] good time. You know,
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; he was on Instagram, Facebook, Tik Tok.
[1:02:01] It was viral. He had memes. He had all
[1:02:03] kind of followers. When when I tell he
[1:02:05] had followers, he had real followers and
[1:02:07] all until famine came.
[1:02:12] When famine came, he realized he start
[1:02:14] to lose followers. He thought was a
[1:02:16] glitch in the system. He thought it was
[1:02:19] Instagram fault or Tik Tok fault or
[1:02:21] Facebook fault.
[1:02:24] He really thought something was wrong.
[1:02:25] If you see him trying to restart the
[1:02:27] social media applications
[1:02:30] until he realized, wait a minute,
[1:02:32] without money, I don't really have a
[1:02:34] choice at this point is about survival.
[1:02:37] At this stage in my life is when he
[1:02:40] chose to do introspection. He start to
[1:02:43] mark himself and he say, "Wait a minute
[1:02:45] here. What? I'm in a bad condition, but
[1:02:48] I'm going to do the best I could do." So
[1:02:50] he became a citizen of the country and
[1:02:53] looking for work. The only work he could
[1:02:56] find was feeding the pigs, living with
[1:03:00] them, mining them,
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; eating pig food,
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; just being part of the society, just
[1:03:07] another one. And although this was his
[1:03:11] condition, it was in that condition that
[1:03:15] he started to think, what lacker yet
[1:03:17] boy, how I end up here.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. You mean it have so much
[1:03:22] promises for me? But I living below my
[1:03:25] privilege.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. You mean it have so much
[1:03:29] more that I could be, so much more that
[1:03:31] I could gain, so much more that I could
[1:03:33] participate in, but this is the way I
[1:03:36] live in.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Imagine he's in the club one day and he
[1:03:39] say, "But what are you really doing
[1:03:41] here?"
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; I remember a time when I used to jump
[1:03:43] and sing, not because the DJ dropped
[1:03:46] some beats, but because I I was in
[1:03:48] church.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; All right. Hallelujah.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Be wait a minute. You mean before the
[1:03:53] foundation of the earth, I was there. I
[1:03:56] was worshiping.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; I was giving praise.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; So you see, he experienced what I
[1:04:03] alluded to earlier. He had spiritual
[1:04:06] amnesia as well.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; He forgot who he was.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And because he forgot who he was,
[1:04:11] something had to stir him up.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; To question what lack I yet.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I find myself in a
[1:04:19] precarious position. I find myself in a
[1:04:21] position that I never expected to be in.
[1:04:24] I find myself in a position because when
[1:04:27] I look back 10 years ago, I wasn't here.
[1:04:30] But slowly slowly I missed one service,
[1:04:32] two services, three services, then I'm
[1:04:34] no longer in church.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Then I find myself in the club.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Then I find myself all over the place.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; But I didn't even realize how I reached
[1:04:43] this far.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; But it started somewhere. So in doing
[1:04:47] introspection as he check back he
[1:04:50] realized wait a minute
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; my father have
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; servants
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; servants he have workers he have people
[1:04:57] that are paid I not getting paid I I pay
[1:05:00] I getting paid in pig in pig food
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; I getting paid in survival points
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; but my father it's is a lord where he is
[1:05:09] you know
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; he's a boss where he is
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; my father has a estate
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; my father have security. He have
[1:05:16] workers. He have staff. He have
[1:05:18] groundsmen. He have pool guide. He have
[1:05:20] everything in in order. As a matter of
[1:05:22] fact, he have guys on the outside of the
[1:05:24] walls looking out too to make sure
[1:05:26] everything is okay. And when he started
[1:05:28] to [laughter] think back, he recognized,
[1:05:30] wait a minute. I don't have amnesia
[1:05:33] anymore. I don't suffer from from memory
[1:05:36] loss anymore. I I I had an identity
[1:05:39] crisis before, but I now know who I am.
[1:05:42] I recognized that if I am in a different
[1:05:45] place, my circumstance will change.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; He was so real with himself.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Come on [snorts] now.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "You know what? I have a plan.
[1:05:53] I will go unto my father and I will tell
[1:05:56] him I have sinned against heaven and
[1:05:58] against thee. I am no longer worthy to
[1:06:00] be called your son. So don't even
[1:06:03] consider me a son because I am a
[1:06:05] failure. I embarrass the family, the
[1:06:08] family name, the family title, the
[1:06:10] history. I am almost like a outcast at
[1:06:13] this point and I don't deserve to be
[1:06:15] part of this. However, if you will
[1:06:18] consider me enough to make me a servant
[1:06:20] at taking that.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; That was his plan. Now God had other
[1:06:28] plans for him. His father had other
[1:06:31] plans for him
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; because his father knew just like you
[1:06:34] and I. God make a promise
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; that not one will be left behind. that
[1:06:39] your children come in
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; that there will be a revival for the
[1:06:43] young people.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; He promised a revival in this hour.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; He promised to restore the gifts in the
[1:06:50] church. So he knew that. So he water in
[1:06:53] these promises every day with hope, with
[1:06:56] faith, with confidence knowing he who
[1:06:58] made the promise was well able to
[1:07:01] fulfill it.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; So he never stopped believing. He never
[1:07:06] give up hope because he know Jesus
[1:07:08] Christ is the same yesterday, today and
[1:07:10] forever. And his word can't fail. His
[1:07:13] promises can't fail. It shall not return
[1:07:16] void. As a result, the father stand up
[1:07:20] outside looking. So while you marking
[1:07:22] your papers and examining yourself, he
[1:07:25] looking, he looking, hoping and praying.
[1:07:28] One day you will walk through the door.
[1:07:30] One day you will remember that I still
[1:07:32] here right where you left me. They are
[1:07:35] still here
[1:07:38] [cheering]
[1:07:39] [applause]
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; in a message the token. [applause]
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham give the example. He
[1:07:48] say listen if you want to ride the bus
[1:07:51] and you see it all the time. You don't
[1:07:53] walk up to the bus driver way waving a
[1:07:56] bill at $10 or $20. You need to buy a
[1:07:59] ticket.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; The ticket is the token. The token shows
[1:08:03] that the price was paid for the ride you
[1:08:06] want to get.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; So this journey you want to take
[1:08:08] requires a price to be paid.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; And when you pay the price or when the
[1:08:12] price has been paid, you get a token.
[1:08:14] The token is evidence that you could
[1:08:16] board.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; It's evidence that you could be on this
[1:08:22] journey.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; That you could reach the destination in
[1:08:25] safety.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose of the token.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; It's not about you. It's about the
[1:08:32] representation you need to take you
[1:08:35] there.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; You could say, "Listen, you you know who
[1:08:39] I am. I am Mr. so so. I am the CEO. I
[1:08:43] don't need a ticket. I going to board
[1:08:45] the plane. I could go to the airport and
[1:08:48] go where I want because I am the
[1:08:50] manager. I am the CEO. I'm the boss."
[1:08:53] Listen, security will put you out.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:57] You can't pass customs or immigration or
[1:08:59] whatever you call it
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; because you need the ticket.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; You need the token to show the price was
[1:09:05] paid for you to be there.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Even if somebody else paid it when you
[1:09:10] reach the air the the airport itself,
[1:09:12] you need a boarding pass.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; So I could buy a ticket for you, but you
[1:09:18] need the boarding pass to get on the
[1:09:19] plane.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; You can't say well well he buy the
[1:09:23] ticket for me. No, you need your
[1:09:25] boarding pass to get on the plane.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; It's personal to you.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; At that stage is an individual affair.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how old you are, how
[1:09:33] young you are, whe whether you're rich
[1:09:35] or poor, you need a boarding pass to get
[1:09:38] on the plane.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; No exceptions.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; None.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; So
[1:09:46] he said, you need the token to get on
[1:09:48] the bus,
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; to get on the train, to get on the
[1:09:50] plane, to get on the ride, to be on the
[1:09:52] journey. You need that.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, when you want eternal
[1:09:56] life, you receive a token
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; showing that the price has been paid. It
[1:10:00] isn't the blood, but it's the token of
[1:10:03] the blood.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; It's the life itself." Amen. Full
[1:10:07] obedience to the whole word of God, to
[1:10:10] God's entire word, will entitle you to
[1:10:12] the token.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; How do you do it? Peter said on the day
[1:10:15] of Pentecost, "Repent every one of you
[1:10:17] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:10:19] Christ for the remission of your sins,
[1:10:21] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:10:24] Holy Ghost, the token,
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; for the promise is unto you and to your
[1:10:28] children,
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; and to them that are far off,
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; even as many as the Lord or God shall
[1:10:35] call."
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; So, you need the token.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; There are things required to get the
[1:10:41] token.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; The price might be paid. Listen, you
[1:10:44] could have a ticket that's paid for. If
[1:10:48] you don't go to the airport, you go
[1:10:49] nowhere.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; That's not good.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; You can have a ticket that's paid for.
[1:10:54] You go to the airport, but you just pass
[1:10:57] the I forget what you call them, the
[1:10:59] CSRs or whatever it is, you go nowhere.
[1:11:01] It doesn't matter that the price of the
[1:11:03] ticket was paid. If you come late, if
[1:11:07] you don't have the requirements,
[1:11:10] your bag's too big or whatever the
[1:11:12] scenario is, you go nowhere.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; You can't take this journey.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; And the title was journey to eternal
[1:11:21] life. That's the most important thing.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; You want to be able to access eternal
[1:11:27] life
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; because one day you're going to meet
[1:11:29] God.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; No exceptions.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; No exceptions. You're going to meet him
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; face to face by yourself.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Not with your mother and your father and
[1:11:40] and my grandfather and my uncle and they
[1:11:43] could vouch for me and they could tell
[1:11:44] you how good I was. No, by yourself
[1:11:47] you're going to meet him. So you need
[1:11:49] your tickets or your token
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; in order to be on this journey.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; So we need to be able to ask ourselves
[1:11:56] what lera yet.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Do I have my boarding pass?
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do I have my ticket? Do I have
[1:12:05] what's required? Because Jesus gave the
[1:12:07] rich young ruler requirements.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; He chose to walk away with great sorrow.
[1:12:15] He thought it was too much.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; I don't want to reach 2 hours before. I
[1:12:19] like to sleep too much. You will miss
[1:12:21] the flight.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, you'll miss the flight.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; I don't want to, you know, I find you
[1:12:28] have too many restrictions. They tell
[1:12:30] Mak bring this on board and this on
[1:12:32] board and this on board. No, that's why
[1:12:33] they scan it. You can't go with any and
[1:12:35] anything.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; They will scan it.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; They want to make sure you have what's
[1:12:40] required to be on board. So this journey
[1:12:42] is like that. You can't just go on the
[1:12:44] journey because your father and your
[1:12:46] mother and your uncle. No,
[1:12:49] you need to have the requirements and
[1:12:51] the boarding pass to be on on this
[1:12:53] journey. [applause]
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be too long with you.
[1:12:59] Now I reme remember even as a child I
[1:13:02] heard this and and I read it myself
[1:13:05] where Brandham used to talk about the
[1:13:07] box cars
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; and he talk about the fact that the box
[1:13:11] cars had to be filled. It were filled
[1:13:12] with cans
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; and if it go loose if it start to rock
[1:13:19] and shake and out of place
[1:13:22] they had to disqualify it from going on
[1:13:25] the journey.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; It couldn't progress. couldn't go to the
[1:13:28] next step. It couldn't go to the next
[1:13:29] phase.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; So, it was important that you pack it
[1:13:33] right and be meticulous about ensuring
[1:13:35] that everything is in its place.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; All the requirements are in order. That
[1:13:40] you pack it the way he said to pack it.
[1:13:42] Why? Because at some point an inspector
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; coming to check it.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; And when the inspector come,
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; they're going to rock it and shake it a
[1:13:51] little bit.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; They're going to check it. They're going
[1:13:54] to do random selection perhaps
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; to make sure what's inside the box,
[1:13:59] guys, what's supposed to be there.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; They're not going to just take your word
[1:14:03] for it.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; They want to ensure that the contents
[1:14:06] inside
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; is exactly what should be inside.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Now, when it's packed properly, they put
[1:14:14] a seal around it.
[1:14:18] Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; They always put a seal around it
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; to make sure
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; nothing could come out and nothing could
[1:14:25] go in.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; That's why it's sealed.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; You seal to ensure that nothing could go
[1:14:31] in and nothing could come out. Amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; So it's important to understand how that
[1:14:36] works.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; The reason being
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; the act of sealing is very very
[1:14:44] symbolic.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Seals could means various things.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit itself is a seal.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; And seal signifies
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; a finished work.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; That done.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; There's nothing else required. So you no
[1:15:06] longer have to ask the question what
[1:15:07] lera yet because I in order now a check
[1:15:11] over is 100%. As a matter of fact I have
[1:15:16] time remaining so I could afford to
[1:15:18] wait. I just waiting on God now. We're
[1:15:21] waiting for God because I do all that he
[1:15:23] asked me to do. I have all the
[1:15:26] requirements line upon line
[1:15:29] by faith holding on to his word. Amen.
[1:15:32] Amen.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; So it is a seal signifies finished work.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; And when the seventh seal is broken, the
[1:15:37] mystery of God, that seal in these
[1:15:39] mysterious seals are finished.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Until the day the seal is broke and then
[1:15:43] it's revealed what's on the inside of
[1:15:45] it.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; If the man is wondering what's in the
[1:15:48] box car say there is supposed to be such
[1:15:51] and such, there's supposed to be. He's
[1:15:53] presuming. But when the seal is broken
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; and the door is open, we see into it and
[1:15:59] then see exactly what's in there.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; You see it?
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; And that'll only be done at the end
[1:16:06] time.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; He want to see if you sell,
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; if you give, if you follow. He want to
[1:16:13] see if you have full obedience to the
[1:16:15] word
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; cuz that entitles you to the token.
[1:16:18] Amen.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; The musicians could could get ready. You
[1:16:22] see another thing a seal signifies is
[1:16:25] ownership.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; When you see that seal, you know where
[1:16:29] it came from.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; You know who that belongs to.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; The seal has a mark on it. The seal is
[1:16:35] not just a tie it up and somebody could
[1:16:37] untie it. No, it has a special
[1:16:39] identifier.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; So when you're bought by the blood of
[1:16:46] Jesus, you're not just bought and well I
[1:16:49] buy you and I press on and I walk away.
[1:16:51] No. He want to put a unique identifier
[1:16:54] on you.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; That everybody knows
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; you are special and he own you.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; He in charge of you so you could follow
[1:17:02] him.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; So when you're sealed by the Holy Ghost,
[1:17:07] you no longer belong to the world or
[1:17:09] anything pertaining to the world. You
[1:17:11] are owned by God.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Another thing, a seal is a security.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Seal means you're secured.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You listen, you don't believe in
[1:17:22] eternal security. I don't know. But now
[1:17:24] a seal signifies security
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; to its destination.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; So nobody could interfere with it.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Nobody could could do so and do so and
[1:17:34] it choke some some something in and you
[1:17:37] don't know what's inside. No, it was
[1:17:39] sealed before taking the journey.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; So when it reach the destination, it
[1:17:43] should be in the same way.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; It should have the same contents. It
[1:17:48] should have the same thing on the
[1:17:49] inside.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; So he said the Holy Spirit seal cannot
[1:17:53] be broken.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; You all have heard me say that people
[1:17:56] said the devil made me do it.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; He said no. The devil didn't make you do
[1:18:01] it.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; I know some people never read this quote
[1:18:04] before. The devil didn't make you do it.
[1:18:07] Stop blaming the devil.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; The devil didn't make you do it. Hear
[1:18:10] what he said.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; He said you just wasn't sealed in.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; He said cuz when you are sealed in He is
[1:18:17] sealed out.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now you went out to him.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; He couldn't get into you because the
[1:18:23] only way to get into you is to come
[1:18:25] through the same process that you have.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; He would have to be saved, sanctified,
[1:18:30] and filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Then he'd be your brother.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; So you see, he didn't do it. No. He just
[1:18:37] went to the borderline. You just went to
[1:18:39] the borderline and come back lusting for
[1:18:41] the things of the world. You never went
[1:18:42] all the way over into Canaan. you see
[1:18:45] across Jordan to death itself because
[1:18:47] you still want to hold on to these
[1:18:49] things. You still want to hold on to the
[1:18:51] title and the benefits and the accolades
[1:18:53] and all the acknowledgement and this one
[1:18:56] you know they really appreciate me so I
[1:18:58] feel good there.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; And what what did Jesus say? Sell it.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Give to the poor.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about that.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; He listen he have you under control.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; He have you in order know he is Jehovah
[1:19:13] Gyra. He will provide everything you
[1:19:15] need.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; He will give.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; He will take care of you. He will see
[1:19:20] you through on this journey.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Let's play that song. Let your living
[1:19:26] water probably in D minor. He said
[1:19:30] education is fine. You should go to
[1:19:32] school and learn.
[1:19:35] You see, that's good, but it wouldn't
[1:19:37] save you. The education wouldn't save
[1:19:40] you. The knowledge wouldn't save you.
[1:19:42] The information wouldn't save you. to
[1:19:44] have plenty of money. That's good. You
[1:19:47] could raise your children, give them
[1:19:48] good clothes and things and like papa
[1:19:51] and mama has worked for you all and
[1:19:53] things. That's good. But it still
[1:19:55] wouldn't save you. [music]
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; See, you could get in a lab, learn how
[1:20:01] to put different things together or
[1:20:02] split atoms or whatever lab folks do.
[1:20:06] You could get in a rocket and go to the
[1:20:07] moon, but those things wouldn't save
[1:20:10] you. You've got to face one thing. Just
[1:20:13] one, not two. You got to face eternal
[1:20:17] life.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; And there's only one person that could
[1:20:19] give that to you. Mama can't give it.
[1:20:22] Papa can't give it. Your pastor can't
[1:20:24] give it. Your leader can't give it.
[1:20:26] Everybody that gets eternal life has to
[1:20:29] come to Jesus Christ.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; He's the only one who could give that
[1:20:33] part. Amen.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Let's stand tonight.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[1:20:40] [singing]
[1:20:43] trouble my mind
[1:20:50] unto you I roll. Let's sing that verse
[1:20:54] again. Let your living water
[1:20:59] let it flow over my soul.
[1:21:03] said, "Let your Holy Spirit
[1:21:08] come and take control
[1:21:12] in every situation
[1:21:15] [singing and music]
[1:21:16] that troubled my mind."
[1:21:20] Listen. All my cares and burdens
