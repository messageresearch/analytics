word of prayer oh gracious heavenly father we thank you this morning for your love for your grace for your mercy towards us lord we pray to god at you have the preeminence in the service this morning lord that you take me out of the way and break chains and break shackles that you would speak to our hearts from the pages of the book father lord that when we leave this place we will say it was good to have been here but more than that we leave with a change in our hearts a change in our lives or changing our minds or changing the way we talk the way we walk the way we live father so father may you take every lord son every daughter under your control father lord as your prophet would have stood so many times and say we declare and take every spirit under our control for the honor and glory of god father lord we welcome you holy spirit through this tabernacle through this house father take me out of the way and speak speak lip to hear to your children this morning father we commit the service into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says let's just sing that song we have come into his house we have come into his house [Music] come into his house gathered in his name to worship him all over the building oh we have come into his house gathered in his name to worship christ our lord [Music] let's just sing it one more time we have come into his house gathered in his name to worship him [Music] we have come into his house gathered in his name to worship him hallelujah we have come into his house heaven in his name to worship christ our lord worship him we're surprised oh lord can we give the lord a hand of praise amen and amen and amen allowed to greet you this morning thank you musicians thank you brother anthony i'd like to greet you this morning in the precious name of our lord jesus christ certainly a great privilege to be gathered one more time in his presence it's not something we could ever take for granted and we know that this will one day come to an end and there will be a last service there'll be a last song there'll be a last opening of the scriptures because churches will be shut down and worship as we know it will no longer be available so while we have this opportunity and while there's still a time for a transformation of your heart and your soul we want to redeem the time as it were and take full advantage for the moment that we have together in his presence and for the grace that he has given to us so we could be honed and shaped into fit into this great image that he is creating is that how you feel this morning so if you have your bibles i'd like to go to first peter and second peter for scripture readings this morning certainly want to appreciate but over it for the prayer meeting on friday night and last sunday's service and how the world has been unfolding uh brother anthony before that such a tremendous time in the presence amen so first peter uh chapter two and reading from verse five he also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious is he precious to you this morning but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallow the same is made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a stone and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation a peculiar people that you should show for the praise of him who had called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time passed to another people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy but anthony you could have them just lower the volume in the monitors that's where the feedback is coming from thank you let's go to second peter one and reading from verse one simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained light precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence out to your fate virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness broadly kindness and to broadly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that he shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and had forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall what a statement never fall for so an intron shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent and that's how i feel this morning to put you always in remembrance of these things though we know them though ye know them and be established in the present truth so we are having a reminder service this morning yeah i think it meet peter is saying yeah i think it is fit i think it is right that word meet means fit or right or correct or appropriate or relevant or accurate yeah i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle as long as i am in this flesh as long as i am present with you to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle in other words i'm going to transfer houses soon even as our lord jesus christ had showed me moreover i will endeavor that he may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty may the lord at a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the lord and we thank god to be here in fellowship tomorrow is a holiday a national holiday so we could relax we could get into the spirit we don't have to rush and do anything at all you could delay thinking about work till tomorrow evening you don't have to do it this evening go there's no work tomorrow everybody feeling fine so i have a title this morning the transformation of peter and what it means for us the transformation of peter and what it means for us and an inspiration the shaping of a stone and the prophecy of lively stones the transformation of peter and what it means for us i truly believe that scripture and the word is supposed to be relevant to us it is not just scripture in a context of it is there to be just studied or learned or understood or known it must be relevant to us the scripture is for a purpose to help us the scriptures and the word is for a purpose to change us and you have to see every time you come to service it is because a change is part of the program so the transformation of peter it's important to know it understand it appreciate it celebrate it acknowledge it dig into it but it must have a relevance to us so i just didn't want to speak on the transformation of peter but what does it mean for us is that how you feel this morning because we just read two scriptures in the books of peter the letters of peter from first peter and second peter and they both speak of a certain kind of quality of a man who is speaking there in eight chapters through first peter and second peter five in this first letter and three in the second letter the peter who is speaking there is a changed man he's a different man he has been through some stuff that allows him to speak a certain way he has been through some stuff to make him an authority to speak to wives and to speak to children and to speak to elders and to speak to the church and to speak to those who are weak and speak to those who are strong and to remind them whether they be jews or gentiles in first peter he opens by saying peter an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers scattered through pontus galatia cappadocia asia and pistoner elect according to the full knowledge of god the father he knew what he was speaking about because he knew he was elected he knows what being elected feels like he knows what being elected looks like he can recognize somebody who is elected so don't tell me when you look at me or you look at your brother you look at your sister you cannot acknowledge that there's something about them and the hand of god is upon them so peter was clear in his delivery in his writing in his communication in what he was sending out that this gospel is not for everybody oh if it would be for everybody that's wonderful but then everybody will receive it because this stone this rejected stone is a stumbling block for some people it's an offense for some people some people can handle it but there's an elect group of people that this is everything to them it is their truth it is their comfort it is their joy it is their foundation it is their goal it is their objective it is their desire it is their zeal it is their passion it is their enthusiasm it's what woke them up this morning it's what keeps them alive it's what change your work change your talk it's what makes you worship it what make you overlook your issues and overlook the problems and overlook the stresses [Music] this rejected stone this headstone this stone that man couldn't put in place that became the cornerstone the chief stone chief shepherd that peter would speak about anybody feeling fine this morning [Applause] if i get just a little more in the monitors that will be great so we're building into something and we're gonna have a little time this morning as we go through the world this morning so buckle your seats belt in not to sit and relax well we're gonna be in for a ride because we came to experience a journey whenever god met somebody it was on a journey he was on the way to somewhere he was on the way to somewhere somebody was in a way to somewhere and somehow it was the encounter of a journey so you're on your way to your next step in your journey and on the way god is meeting you this morning can the church say man [Applause] the transformation of peter and what it means for us i find this to be very encouraging as a subject as a thought as a theme i've always said it's very difficult to identify in scripture a favorite character it is very difficult to find somebody who you can say that's my favorite it's because everyone has their place even if it's for one minute even if there's a one second in scripture like that man who carried a cross of jesus when jesus couldn't carry it no more his role may not have been five years or five months it was for a few moments but he carried the cross of jesus how could you place his role above someone else's each person's role in this journey in this story is so important so relevant so necessary you have no idea the impact of different people who touch your life in a simple way maybe your word maybe an encouragement maybe a note maybe you're just a god bless you was enough and you are here today because all of these things worked together for good work together because behind the scenes there's a author a designer a conductor an architect bringing the pieces together but the reality is there are some characters in scripture for whom we have more information than others so i've always said for me in the old testament david speaks out to me i just love david because we see him as a boy we see him as a shepherd we see him as a king we see him in depression we see him in frustration we see him in anger we see him crying we see him stressed out we see him overwhelmed and god can say that's a man after my own heart because i know i have my struggles and i know you do too and we can identify in the life of david moments in our lives when we feel weak and we feel down and we feel rejected and we feel upset and we feel like giving up but when we look into the scripture and see the life of david we could say oh as the heart punted after the water brook so my soul turns after me many a day that rise up against me we can find something in there that can remind us to keep pushing to keep pressing to keep fighting to keep holding on to keep the flag flying to not look back to not give up and even if you stumble you could get back up again can the church say amen for me in the new testament it is peter because peter is all over the new testament jesus had different disciples and some you don't hear much about but peter oh my brother peter first to respond first to do this first to do that and peter is very open with his issues i can identify with peter peter was excitable peter would boldly make mistakes there was a time and i'll get it when jesus just ignore him because that's just peter can the church say amen but i want to just paint a picture and then we want to go back into history a bit and kind of connect the dots i want to dramatize the way the prophet would that time so it was a long night a difficult night peter felt overwhelmed there was a lot he didn't understand there was a lot he was trying to figure out he just couldn't make sense of it all things that he thought was real suddenly seemed to have fallen apart a few moments before a few hours before he invited a few of his friends to go with him to go fishing seven of them went fishing that night as a way maybe to pass the time maybe it was just a comfort zone maybe for him it was just a way to try to get back to familiar ground it had been maybe three and a half years since he had gone fishing it was not something he did yesterday or last week or last month or last year because he had left that life and the purpose he had left at life had suddenly felt like it crumbled apart not only that in his ascension in his growing and in his maturity he had made a great mistake i can imagine peter's there maybe we don't know what thought he had that night but a whole night is a long time to not sleep and when you're going through a night of not sleeping your mind will bring back things to you that are bothering you anybody ever had a night where stuff bothering you and as you struggle to sleep it's not the irrelevant stuff that comes to your mind it's what's important to you i wonder if peter reflected to the moment when they asked him do you know jesus and against his very best effort to say the right thing he said no and it was not just a lie it was deeper than a lie because it was a denial to lie is the twisted truth or mistell the truth but the denial brother clarence was not only am i not with that but i am not with it it is not just the untruth of i don't know what gospel is talking about but it is i'm not identified i am denying my association with this thing [Applause] and the bible said peter wept bitterly the bible could have said he wept but you see when descriptive words are added it brings clarity and magnitude to the deepest elements of the emotion of the man called peter because he was a man just like you and i many times and this is the fallacy with us we see scriptural characters as untouchables but god in his grace and mercy pains peter as a broken man a man who has made him mistaken as he weeps bitterly he's showing the fact that there was still part of him that was real that although he denied him there was part of him that said this is that right i know better than this i've been to too many services i saw too many miracles i've seen too much truth in this thing for me to give it all up how do i find myself in this spot i can imagine mr george during that night peter is asking himself why am i here because he had given up vision he had left it all behind and sometimes just sometimes it feels like you're back where you started and here it was peter was back in the spot as if he had just started the thing he had left three and a half years ago he found himself back there because the anchor that had propped him up and helped him and help was no longer there i don't know how many thoughts that peter had that night but maybe he started to recall amber branham did this when he was preaching what manner of man is this when they were on the boat he said maybe they were fellowshipping around what jesus preached and they were fellowshipping around the miracles that happened anybody with me peter for three and a half years he had disconnected from his occupation as a fisherman today and even more so then it's a rough profession it is not a profession run by ignorant people don't get it mixed up you have to be sharp you have to be brave the sea of galilee where peter spent most of his life fishing was a rough sea it was common to have storms it was common for your boat to turn over so as a fisherman you have to be used to the risk of going out there not sure not only if they're coming back but what you're coming back with it was used you used to be able to deal with disappointment because you could go and fish all night and not catch anything anybody with me it had been a long time peter had experienced that kind of disappointment because as each hour passed through the night brother punch and it became closer to morning it was just one hour less one hour less before light broke and when light broke it had only one thing to do you have to pack up go home and acknowledge the fact that it didn't work that night anybody with me this morning i'm painting this picture because we're at an interesting point in peter's life we are between him having three and a half years with jesus and him about to complete a transformation process that he didn't even understand but i just want to pee in this picture here before we go back to where it started this is in sin john 21 verse 4 but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus then jesus said unto them children have you any meat they answered him no one would think brother eccles that after three and a half years with jesus you'll recognize his voice they're people who call you without them even signaling who they are you know who they are because you know their voice you would think that after three and a half years they would say wait a minute that voice sounds familiar they answered no and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and you shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes now this is after the crucifixion this is after the resurrection we deal with right therefore that disciple whom jesus loves say it unto peter it is the lord it took somebody to tell peter peter was dealing with so much stuff it took the disciple whom jesus loved to tell peter it is the lord no it still didn't say that peter recognized the voice he said now when simon peter heard that it was the lord it was not an individual this is the same peter who said that with the christ if it was any disciple but a stephen who could recognize peter it should be recognized jesus should be peter but peter was in a in a state anybody somebody feel like they're in a state hallelujah and that state is by design you know it's part of your transformation now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he girt his fischer's quota unto him for he was naked and i want you to just process this for a minute and did cast himself into the sea you ever you ever read this i want you to picture the drama here jesus is on the show the disciples in the boat it's already morning time jesus talking but peter don't want to think it's jesus he's not processing as jesus when john recognized and see it is the lord peter looked twice peter didn't say let's wait till the boat go in peter jumped off the boat to swim to jesus because the next verse says the other disciples came in a little ship in other words the other disciples didn't do like peter you know they say well when he both go in we'll we know he's the lord but but peter was different he raced to meet the lord because there was something in him was desiring the connection and the relationship he had with jesus so when he heard that jesus is on the show he moved like a different kind of man characteristic of peter he was impulsive he did what was in his heart he did what he felt was right there was nothing to stop and he wore his emotions on the on the cuff but god was not finished with him yet can the church say amen it had taken a long time and a number of experiences to bring peter to that spot are you with me this morning maybe peter taught to where it all began and let's just go back to the beginning in jewish custom by around age 12 or so you'd finish your basic schooling so many would start to work by age 13. the part where peter grew up in was official village so it was not uncommon for that to be the career of choice fishermen in those days they were a rough bunch as much as they observed jewish tradition they were a rough bunch traditionally uneducated but they were skilled because not only had you to go out there and find fish but you had to come and sell it in the marketplace so you have to both understand the acquisition of your resource as well as the distribution of your resource the pricing of your resource it was a lot that peter had that was going for him as a young man growing up he got hooked on to hearing about this man called john because he was actually listening to john's messages anybody with me read the bible he was married his mother-in-law lived with him and peter was living life as a young man we don't know his exact age when jesus called him but but it would have been a very young man maybe early twenties or thereabouts or and somewhere around there anybody with me this morning but this simple fisherman was on a journey that he didn't know to be transformed from an official boy who grew up right there into an apostle grew up as official manager a spokesperson for the church grew up as a man who wasn't even a biblical scholar or of a tribe that would study the word in that way so when you read in the first letter and the second letter of peter what peter brought out you'll realize that he had already passed everybody who went to school for this thing anybody with me this morning let's go it's hard to sum up peter's life but the first experience with peter or one of the first experiences with peter could be found in scene john 1 42 and he brought him to jesus and when jesus beheld him he said thou art simon the son of jonah thou shall be called cephas which is by interpretation a stone so the moment jesus saw peter he saw his destiny he saw his purpose he saw what he would become he saw the role he would play and before his transformation he called it as he saw it [Applause] in front of jesus was a stone an unshaped stone an uncut stone a stone that didn't know he was a stone that was to fit in us or anybody hear me this morning a stone that's what one day prison was lively stones a store that would one day identify the chief stone the corner stone that stone stood there didn't hear a message preached yet what he was being identified that thou shalt be called short is prophetic one day they're gonna look at you and see that you are shaped a certain way but for me to shape you you must be made out of a certain kind of material anybody with me this morning and that's why i said this morning peter knew how to identify it because he was identified before he was shaped he was a stone and before you could be shaped you have to be a stone before you can become this image you have to be the material that could be shaped into this image oh come on somebody help me this morning [Applause] there in front of jesus and i want us to understand why every service is important every prayer meeting is important every scripture you read is important every tape you listen to is important every book you read is important every time you meet a brother it's important every time you meet a sister it's important because it's all part of your transformation every miracle you see every prophecy you hear you may be seated there standing in front of jesus without him even recognizing a stone without shape was beginning to take shape a stone that didn't know where he was coming from and where he was going just that one encounter by identifying who he will become change had already started just by identifying what he would be called just by saying you are the bride change just by identifying you are wife of the lamb change just by identifying you predestinated for a purpose change change change your molecules begin to respond your dna begins to respond your vocal cords begin to respond [Applause] [Music] come on now anybody with me this morning come on ride with me a little bit because i'm not just telling peter's story i'm also telling my story i'm telling you a story because when god saw you just like when adam saw eve he said flesh of my flesh born of my bone you shall be called the same spirit was the only earth when he saw peter he said flesh of my flesh born of my bone you shall be called the mighty stone the headstone was on the earth and he said you are stoned also you shall be called headstock come on now anybody with me this morning [Applause] [Music] and a stone without sheep was starting to take shape every experience every encounter god was revealing himself on an individual basis with a pop well don't underestimate every word spoken over your life don't underestimate the you being dedicated in the house of god don't underestimate what god has taken you through it's all for a purpose and that purpose cannot be defeated and what i love about this we're going to get to it god cannot change his mind when he declares who you are he cannot undo it because we're going to see how much mistakes peter made and peter is still one of the 24 elders oh you don't hear me this morning peter oh you don't hear me this morning do you understand who we preaching about this morning do you understand i'm preaching to you and about you and your great purpose in god that the devil wished he could stop but no depression no frustration nothing present nothing passed [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] ride with me this morning it's a little sunday school let's send this school message this morning a stone without shape starting to take shape friends whether i don't know what peter went home i tell his wife you know what is the come on tell your wife i met this man called jesus and he tell me my name but you also tell me i shall be called something else baby you want to start to call me first baby you want to become a peter because this man called jesus tell me my name is simon but i really have another name i don't understand what it means but there's something about this man he called me something else he's showing me something else he's identifying something else friends there's some people who came in here one way this morning you might call them a certain thing when they came in but when you walk out you get their bet ready to call them something else because when you hear your name on that day peter hood his name oh oh come on you don't hear me this morning no wonder when god told them jesus told them go you have power through all these things he said don't rejoice but i don't know rejoice because your name is written in heaven rejoice because you have a new name rejoice because they have oh come on now somebody preached back to me this morning you may be seated a stone without shape we all came to church without sheep born in this world without sheep can't fit in nowhere to fit in you have to be shipped the devil has a job to share people too you know because you're born here without shape and experience in life does make you adjust people learn behaviors you know in many studies they take children of different races white chinese black and put them in a room as kids and they all play normal because the biases of their parents and grandparents have not been taught to them but as they get older and they learn things now it requires conversation like whether you be jews or gentiles because the jews are the gentiles ready is it but that's the behavior you're born to it you're born without sheep and your parents have a responsibility to help sheep the preacher have a job to help sheep the world has a job to help sheep the ministry of the great prophet elijah malachi 4 was a shaping message to shape stones to connect with this head anybody with me this morning so this is why the transformation of peter is so important because peter is the only way you could find at your feet virtue and knowledge and it's only peter is doing peter talk about that you know or you don't hear me this morning so peter understood this shape and thing peter could look back from where he came from and say if you don't add to this fitting some virtue and out of virtue knowledge and out of knowledge temperance and outer temperance patience and attitude godliness and add broadly kindness and and when these things are added is charity and if these things are in you and abound oh you don't hear me this morning only peter could preach that in the whole bible only peter could preach that message because he understood what shaping of a stone felt like looked like oh come on somebody help me this morning trinis fly to america and the language i don't want to finish it the church finishing with sentences the language takes shape some people don't have to reach new york they reach the ramp of the plane and before the scary seat can i have some uh before they even the first time flying over moving there their lead is the first trip you know but they adjust shape change their behavior change their words their language your choice of words now there's nothing wrong with changing you know it's what shape you're going into because in shape and reform this world was without form and void it's scripture until god had to make it into a shape let there be light structure let me separate it from a mentally structure shape design let there be let there be the great architect designing and when he's done he was like let me put a piece to finish this thing off and drop something to complete this design he said let us make man in our image and now like this i put that man there what he was doing putting things in order so you have to see every service every encounter listen if you go to school and you're listening to school work you wouldn't take shape to be employable maybe your role is not to go to school but you need to get shape somehow maybe an apprenticeship program but it doesn't happen overnight peter's journey started somewhere in that scripture that we read in john 1 42 when he met jesus can we can we go on a little bit a stone without sheep saturday take shape say luke 4 38. simon peter has another encounter all of this is shaping him his elements it's it's remembering our service in kaiwal a service in border speed now service in saguanos it's a convention you went to it's a message you heard a tape you listen you could talk to somebody remember the first book i read written by the prophet go talk to about the parents go talk to her go talk to them and ask them what what was the experience like that changed your life and that was a point that was part of the shaping because nobody dropped them overnight and look anywhere they look you now go out with a punch go fellowship that's why on the other side you're relating with fellowship because i want to know how your story was because we could spend time talking about peter sorry about everybody have their story how sister nicolas came to love the lord so much and through her ups and downs and her child and attested you can't move you rock a revelation in her soul because as much as a rock in her soul she also is a rock anybody i could do that with everybody you know even the backslider because peterbox right but that didn't change the fact that you shall be called cfos your temporary mistake doesn't change the fact that your name is going to be changed your temporary situation it's not going to change the fact that he who started to work in you is more than able to finish it and bring it to pass can the church give the lord a big hallelujah [Applause] so the early part of jesus ministry we in luke 4 luke 4 is when he opened his scroll and said the spirit of lords upon me later down in that same chapter in luke 4 38 he arose out of the synagogue and entered into simon's house you could see he was on a mission to get simon's attention he didn't want simon to wonder when he had to talk to him who was talking to him and simon's wife's mother that's what i told you he was living with his mother-in-law there's no secret in and he and someone said my wife's mother was sticking with a great fever and they besought him for her and he stood over her and rebuked a fever and it left her and immediately she arose and ministered unto them you know what that minister mean in this context she was had a fever by a punch jesus rebuked the fever she gets a person to make juice and kick and said the minister to them listen imagine one million lie no next minute your guests can rebuke i would say let me get some flour let me put together what you want to eat a minister to them make them feel comfortable make them feel and there's peter watching that interesting different way i hear john preaching but this thing this thing different anybody with me this morning the next chapter luke 5. and it came to pass as the people press under him to hear the word of god he stood by the lake of gennazaret and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets you wash your neck in the morning when you finish work okay walking in the night so these men had finished work and they finished work and said well i go fling me net and just go miss i just vex i get nothing they still have a discipline anybody with me this morning so they were washing their nets and he entered into one of the ships which was simon's he didn't say he asked permission i want you to picture simon there washing his net and then she'll just walk on in the boat and when he was in the boat he said say trust out and liquor from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship what ship do you have this morning that jesus could just walk into your ship sit down until you drive could he sit down on your porch could jesus just walk into your house and come into the living room and say inviting neighbors to come because peter at that point in time was no minister he wasn't no he wasn't even fully called yet all peter would have known is that my name gone changed my mother-in-law get healed and here's this man called jesus just sitting on my boot with what you have seen me cut through him on the boat so peter died in a service that morning he didn't plan to be in he was washing his nets after a whole night fishing he was tired but he get caught in church they can't leave jesus jesus he pulled my audible you know what jesus you have to keep because every boat stay at george well peter got to say well jesus when you're finished just lock up the keys now but peter had to take the boat a little bit out of the water and stay with his boat and save you and sit along in church when he didn't really plan it wasn't like it was on his schedule anybody watch me this morning have you been caught in a service that i didn't plan to be in any young brother young sister here this morning you're caught in church [Music] peter found himself caught in service and when jesus finished the teaching verse four he said when he had left speaking when he finished preaching he said to simon launch alternately deep and i will let me go out more in the water then let me go deep in the water i just give you some natural fish some spiritual fish let me get your real fish in and let down your nets for a catch now look at simon and i want us to appreciate the transformation by the punch the growth the maturity the understanding up until this point simon had been told his name was going to be changed he has seen his mother-in-law healed he has witnessed a service and listen if there was anybody who could preach jesus jesus feelings preaching or what it would be like to sit in a service when jesus preached himself friends i got preaching you see jesus oh my he could preach and after the service brother pop well when did time come for action listen to the response and simon answering said unto him master we have told all the night and i've taken nothing nevertheless at thy word i will let only that only because it's you only if you said you would can we have enough trust in god after all you've been true to say lord if you just say the word this morning of what i have to do with my house with my job with my marriage but just say the word whatever it is i'm telling you my experience so far has not been a pleasant one because all night we tried and we caught nothing but if you tell me to do it i'm willing to try one more time is there anybody willing this morning to try one more time i don't know if this is helping anybody it's a simple message it's not this is not complicated deep mystery messenger but the mysteries come out of this man here because if you're ever talking about this image here this is peter's man this is peter's legacy here you know this year's peter legacy every time he talked about slipping voices and stuff is peter is the man who preached this sinner so i want to understand what he went through for him to have such confidence to uneducated man to be the righteous thing so eloquently under the leadership of the holy spirit and when they had this done they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break it was so much fish in that brick now there's a subtle thing in scripture here listen it's a very subtle thing i preached it before in verse four it said let down your nets plural for a draw or a catch peter's response was a mixed response he said i would i will let down the net singular the command by the point was like all your nets because god telling you what about to happen peter he believe in it but is that silly instead of doing all of his nets brother pop well he put on one net singular this is very subtle but nothing is accidental to me in scripture jesus said nets if i had one knit i want to know where's the other one because if he say plural it had to be something behind it jesus said letting a net plural and peter led on one net singular and he ned brooke and now verse seven they had to back it under the apartments which were in the other ship and they should come and help them and they came and phil pull the ship so that they began to sink no safety osha all kind of thing going on here boats so much fish anybody with me this morning and when simon peter saw it he fell down and jesus this thing depart from me from a simple sinful man in his in his very slight way he was not fully obedient so he's recognizing the magnitude of god before his eyes and what full obedience to the word how important that really is anybody with me we preaching through these scriptures here right verse nine for he was astonished and all that were with him at the draw for the catch of fishes which they taken and so also was james and john the sons of zebedee which were partners with simon and jesus said unto simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men and when they brought their ships to land they forsook all and followed him they left everything the boat the accessories the degree the training the account the creditors the debtors they just walk away and follow jesus are you willing to leave everything this morning and just follow jesus can we take a little more but obviously continue stop stop saying a little more you think a lot more tomorrow's holiday and this peter start of that journey and i want us to appreciate friends he had no idea the ups and downs he would go through and friends when you go through life you recognize and i think i said this in a bible study or something that at any point in time the decisions you make at that point in time to your best understanding is the best you have at that point in time your examiner board as a parent as a as a worker as a husband as a wife for the most part unless you just what less as you say here for the most part you're doing the best you know how to do you're trying to manage your budget they're trying to see if money you're trying to pay the bills you're understanding you're into school each and they make breakfast you're cooking the best way you know how sometimes you bundy food when it now start it tastes good when it all start you're doing the best the best food anybody with me the best dish you make that way when your guests come you cook the best thing you know to make because your best foot forward but that's at that particular point in time it's only as time progresses you can look back and recognize how much you have grown how much you didn't know was inside of you all along good or bad because for peter he was going to discover what in him was good as well as what in him was bad but it only takes time for that to unfold and that's why god puts time on people to see what's really in you in a natural we give you probation we're gonna get a new job to give probation i've learned through this process years ago my manager told me new brooms always sweep clean when they hire somebody that first day that first week that first month watch now when i tell your work most people if you really watch up most people not after day or two they say well to fire you but that first week that first two weeks my your future promote them but after the next month and then the next month and the next month uh but where you come from boy other teachers said i'm working you have to push him you have to beg him you're scraping him you'll be everyday i have a new excuse violet i met him and he said listen abysman he had 150 employees in my first meeting with him he said see this book right here he pulled it out of me the namely book brother terence was called the book of excuses he said i showed this to all my employees he said this book have every excuse you come up with so because i've read them all don't try not with me but probation is really put in time to see if what you start off with is a consistent thing because you make a real effort in that first date on first week that first month but my month five do you really use that to show up do you really know that don't say good morning when i go to work what's in your past people straight yeah clean me 10 years all kind of thing you do because the radio comes up so too god puts time much people were in this message years ago and you can't smell them now you can't see them you can't find them and it takes tickets even meet them i met somebody recently but hasn't been in church in years and as a talk he said you are eager i say yeah he say you're talking about the thing in your thing from the cleft of the rock and the amount of references in the message i heard in five minutes for somebody who hasn't been in church for a while i said look at eating it really inside and don't eat anything you can't get all the thing anything you know and you have to pray for the grace of god to restore everyone because this message not in vain some god allowed to go to orkin experiences but when god ready for them that thing anything does wake up in him that seed in his soul began to speak and because he responded he rained and he seized on the lettering you know anybody with me this morning somebody say man so we're talking about transformation because the reality is this gospel puts you on notice that the way you came into church a year ago five years ago 10 years ago 20 years ago it's always a work in progress and you can never say you have attend at the best guest you could speak like paul as he have run maurice i've kept defeat i've finished my course but i'm still running and every day you're looking to become more like him that's the process of transformation so i want to highlight and i have it written on my notes i kind of all over the place now but i wanted to say that peter's transformation was not a singular event we could attribute a major part of the upper room but the reality is every situation and tests he went through was making him into the man he became do not underestimate what you're going through the trials and the testing and the situations yes you're going to get the holy ghost but what you're going through now is actually shaping you and shaping you and shaping you and cutting and cutting and cutting kind of cheat say amen this brother called peter i was going to highlight a few in in different order i'm not really going to go in in chronological order as such but let's just show you this man called peter you remember the time that they were in the boat and they were having trouble and jesus appeared to them and peter said lord it dies you bid me come on guys i like that repeater you know peter what's up at that point his fate was at 100. he said lord that you bit me come then disciples know other disciples try to know then what does everybody say well let me do what peter do peter jump out there start to walk on the water peter look back thumbs up and he look at the water and that hundred feet such as the dive because when jesus saved him jesus talked about his faith you know is his faith jesus accused at that point you know anybody with me he said your faith why i have so little faith go read it no wonder jesus could tell peter peter the devil want to say feel like wheat but i've prayed for you that your your feet don't fail because you gotta go into the situation with your feet high you know but then as you see trouble your feet it's not that you don't have faith it's just that your feet come under pressure but jesus has a comfort to us through peter's through this life of peter and this transformed man called peter say i prayed for you that your faith feel not peter ends up in the inner circle just let me give you that one script it is in matthew 14 i was referencing with walking on the water and the exact words in verse uh i wonder we just read verse 29 to 31 and he said come this is when peter said lord if that you biblically come and peter was come down i'll keep you walk in the water to go to jesus and when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and began to sink he cried saying lord save me and immediately jesus stretched fought his hand and caught him and said unto him listen to the words carefully oh thou of little feet wherefore did this doubt doubt so i want you to understand this man of faith and you having a walk of faith and boisterous wins situations in your life affect you and and doubt creeps in and fear creeps in all right let's go in matthew 16 we preach this all the time jesus asked the question who the men say that i am and it is very easy to bring what other people's interpretation or revelation or explanation or thought is some say you are this i'm so you are that you i'm saying and when they were finished calling all of the major prophets who by virtue of them raising these names they were also attributing some level of speculation into if jesus could be one of these jesus said now who do you say i am and silence in the church this is after having seen so many things and nobody had a word until peter says the word of christ and we know it so we know for sure peter had a revelation but in that same scripture just a little lower down when jesus began to explain what would happen jesus tell peter peter get behind me satan because peter was still able to be influenced by factors outside of him and what was coming through peter at that time was a word from the devil that's why jesus could say get behind me satan peter i know you talking you know anybody with me this morning we're talking about this man called peter so i want us to appreciate as and and i want you to appreciate us where the ministry peter was under so you cannot say well it's it's because the pastor is why this happened or peter is under jesus ministry and jesus has the ability to identify the spirit working through peter and say get me behind me satan jesus again complex and say oh gosh boy have somebody in church but the devil just used them is that an indictment in my ministry no jesus i want you to understand friends the three kind of believers in the church i want you to understand these spiritual attacks i want you to understand the forces because jesus is opening up himself and the devil is still trying to infiltrate his church until jesus himself had to rebuke in his own church peter who will become the spokesperson i want us to understand how many moving pieces are here we still talking about peter by hmong transfiguration matthew 17 peter's party in a circle when peter see moses and elijah and jesus when you read that scripture you recognize peter said lord if you give any word we built three tabernacles do you read that scripture jesus never even respond to him jesus acts if peter never even say that jesus haven dignified with the response dare peter goes again but i want us to appreciate the confidence that god had in peter because what he saw there is reflected in his letters in peter of what he actually witnessed and the glory that he saw it was part of his testimony it was part of his transformation you cannot tell the story if he wasn't there can the church say man let's go on i'm gonna skip through quite a bit peter was there for almost every single miracle watching learning studying the timeline is filled with peter being true out all his experiences it was evident that he was called the informal leader of the disciples and as it came down to him let's touch us a bit as part of the whole transformation jesus told peter peter you're going to deny me and peter's response was in a way that peter couldn't even believe it was possible peter didn't believe he could deny jesus no because peter didn't know what the experience was going to be like that was going to require him to give a response i hope this is helping somebody none of the experiences peter went through had prepared him for this encounter when jesus died and when they come and say want you there in service want you aren't you a disciple and you are part of this thing and he denied it three times and we said it before he wept bitterly and all this was part of that building up of the transformation of peter that leads to this great apostle as it were peter was so reckless so responsive to how we was led that imagine when they come to take jesus he draws sword this is after all of the blessed messages and turn the other cheek and after all these great teachings buddhist even peter responded in his default factory settings as if somebody had come on his boat and take a bag of fish and chop off the man is and jesus had to go and restore it and tell peter if you live by the sword you die by the sword that was a message he was dealing with peter personally warrior peter in the garden of gethsemane jesus at the challenge peter peter you can't pray with me for one hour you can't tarry with me for one hour so you see why a revelation or the pastor or the church you're in is different from a personal walk and a personal maturing and a personal maturity as a christian when jesus rose from the dead he said go tell my disciples and peter because peter was going through a lot friends it's not easy to make a mistake and try to work your way back to fellowship it's not easy it takes a lot of effort it takes you having to die out even more peter didn't feel welcome i want you to process it because not only he wasn't this acquired brother this was a front runner brother so when do you hear peter deny jesus the brothers couldn't believe it and peter is still feeling guilty and friends jesus was dealing with that by saying i still want peter to come so go tell me and go and make sure and find peter because peter is still part of this thing he may have made a mistake if that is any encouragement to backstarted this morning take that as a as someone to run with [Applause] nothing peter did was changing god's mind about peter being part of this great purpose and plan if it was us we say tell peter he can't come peter finished he went out from us because he was not of us he believed in revelation now we don't believe because he deny it not once it's three messages he preached and in all three messages with occurrence you see i know not the man i know not the revelation finished thank god god is a redeemer thank god he sees beyond what man sees and he knew what was in peter's heart from that first time he met peter and he said come your name is going to be different and when peter couldn't speak for himself that rock in his soul was speaking for him and when peter couldn't pick himself the resurrected christ there was no blood that could speak for peter or you don't hear me this morning so the blood was speaking better things and peter could have even expressed thank god for the blood if it wasn't for the blood where would we be peter's own mouth put him in trouble but at that same time jesus on the cross it is finished and now there was blood that could speak for peter that peter didn't even fully understand but that blood spoke better for peter than he could speak himself he said go find my son peter i wonder if there's somebody here this morning who is backslidden who is struggling who this is for you this is a message of restoration of redemption of transformation and in that scripture we started with when jesus was having a conversation in john 21 when peter jumped out the boat and swim to jesus and the disciples came in their boats afterwards jesus has a conversation with peter peter do you love me because at the end of it i really want to understand what's in your heart peter and it's not just that it's not that jesus didn't know you know he wanted peter to confess it he wants him to confess and and he asks peter the question three times peter denied jesus three times but here jesus said let me help you undo that do you love me do you love me do you love me and jesus put on record peter's identification with his ministry so when the devil want to pull a tape and say well have the tape when you deny him peter could say well you're playing one when i say i love him if you're bringing that one bring your next one too now because for every one of them ones that i have a tip to report that and show you when i say i love him i love him i really really love him the old peter who denied him is a different peter when i said i love him and i really really love him and i love him more than oh come on now somebody help me this morning the transformation of peter i trust this is helping somebody this morning you know and to show you how much peter was changed by the time you go into acts 5 you know acts 5 started with an eye sense of fire right but as you go down in it this was a because peter who had to deny christ was a scared peter it was it was fear it wasn't if if if peter was this i want you to understand what peter went through this bowl peter a lot of us you build me come saint peter chop over my ears this bold brave peter when he see jesus heading to the cross and seeing this thing the master dying he had a charity life you know peter say well i don't mind trying walking on water i don't mind chopping up ears but it's that thing this debt thing is a whole different i don't know if i really caught the it was fear of debt it was fear of being crucified also they say well here's what i hear already i hear are not ready for this that is i committed you know not that committed and if i ask the question now many of you will say will you die for this gospel i might get some mixture and there'll be some people will be brave enough and say yes but as you walk closer to the crucifixion cross and then see them hold any nails and say you already come i can imagine some nervous people saying you want to go first brother you go now i will go i will go after you that's some real brave brothers let them brave let them go first now let me let me see how your experience look like before i go myself anybody want to go first and he volunteers to get crucified ready you think to the dark ages he lions then and and and and boiling and oil and all kind of thing brothers was you you had to know where standing but peter wasn't there yet at that time he wasn't there yet but by the time he go into his process of transformation i want us to understand transformation and change and the person who we were yesterday and last year not dc person today and even after this service you'll be a different person by the time we read acts five now now this is after the holy ghost pour out right we reach and and and and and the the disciples this is acts 5 verse 17. and the high priest rose up this is after let me just read back a little bit again and by the hands of the apostles this is acts 5 verse 12 were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all at one according solomon's porch and the rest there's no man joining himself to them but the people magnified them and believers were the more added to the lord multitudes both men and women in so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of peter look at this transformed man called peter peter do you even have to pray for them no more just the shadow of peter passing by might overshadow them oh come on somebody help me the same man who denied jesus they say man who made mistakes they say man they just wanted to be near peter because when the lights shine on peter and the shadow of peter dropped there came also a multitude out of the cities round about jerusalem bringing sick folks with them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone go on then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sack of the sadducees so they round up every side you see and were filled with indignation and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison the common prison is not the special prison the common prison is where the bandits and where the heart and seasoned criminals i want you to see polish rem them brothers now and everybody says yes they give up that hard life in them and fellas they're fishing they know they are used to that thing and they put them in the common prison anybody with me this morning hallelujah but the angel of the lord by night open the prison doors and brought them foot and said go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life and when they heard that they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught but the high priest came and deal with with him and called the council together and all these senators of the children of vision and sent to the prison to have them brought but when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and told saying the prison truly found we shot with all safety we didn't find a lock broken we didn't find our window broken the security guards stealing in front nobody open the door and they keep us standing without before the door so the guards right outside the building but when we open dsl we found no man with him now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them where unto this would grow they say if people hear about this this thing is even worse than before it's better we didn't lock them up because if they heard we locked them up and they know outside the prison and the cameras here picked them up the guys here picked them up they lock air brake the guards say he stand up there all night here you know how they went out we can't let this get out there you may be seated then came one i want to show the challenge but this is peter who say i know this gospel then came one until him saying behold the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people then when they captained with the officers and brought them listen the bible was very impossible without violence never let's say we want to be gentle with them because we already know this the empowerment fellows working with these days we already want to push them and next thing the next thing something happened to us so they brought them they say brother peter can you kindly make your way to the high priest and the captain if you would just allow us to take you in we don't want to touch here we don't want to hold here we don't want to use any handcuffs we don't want to hit you we don't want to prod thanks for other people but the thing only working with the thing anything we already want to mess with that thing so can you come anybody with me this morning then when the captain will be off them brought him with all violence listen for they fear the people so all the people now do people have an attitude know the whole believers changing over a punch they don't know scaredy believers you know all them scared people like you know gideon days he said if you're afraid go home and sleep if you're afraid go back go back go back but these disciples who follow him between them now they're afraid nothing they're afraid nobody they don't care who it is who say what the god they serve they know they've been healed they know they've been changed they know one day i was blind but now i see where you going where peter for they fear the people lest they should have been stoned so the gods frightened if they gone get no no no let's go on and when they brought them they set them before the council and the high priest asked them saying did not we straightly command you did we not in other words we have men's words didn't we directly clearly specifically direct you that you should not teach in this name and be all you are filled jerusalem with your doctrine i read any bible and intend to mean this man's blood upon us and then peter and the other apostles answered and said we ought to obey god rather than men so this man peter who a little while ago by the terence was i know this thing afraid to die afraid prison afraid this dinner he said listen listen listen we ought to obey god rather than man the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom you slew and hung on a tree him had god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior fought to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his witnesses you see how it matters now peter could not recall every experience he had he said we are his witnesses the stuff i've seen you can't beat it ultimate this stuff i've seen you can't shut me up this stuff i've seen i can't backslide no more i've been changed i've been transformed we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holy ghost whom god had given to them that obey him when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them i don't i don't want to read all of it but there's the last verse of that chapter says and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ give us some christians like that again who by virtue of your experience and by what you have witnessed and what that you have heard and the glory that has come upon you nothing will stop you from climbing this pyramid oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah peter's transformation i'm going to be wrapping up shortly peter's transformation was at a singular event friends although the upper room plays the most significant role it is undeniable that multiple experiences contributed to peter's transformation how could you say you trust god and you know to trust him when he never had to have to depend on him and had to walk with i don't know how i'm going to pay this bill i don't know how we're going to do this i don't know how this thing going to work out i never see where the lord worked it out for me now you could tell people listen you could trust him it worked for me it will work for you too i know him as my jehovah jireh i know him as my jehovah sharma i know him mario van nisi maybe you only knew him as one or two of these things but he's seven compound redemptive names i want to know him in all of his power and what your name as my priest as my shepherd as my shield as my buckler as my reward as my defense can the church say man [Music] and in the great i call it the great convention that started after the ministry of christ in the day of pentecost peter preached the first service he was also the first one to openly declare the gospel of christ being available and accessible to the gentiles paul would be the one to carry this forward but peter was the one who said it don't matter where you come from this thing is available to everybody can the church say man hallelujah and because of peter's transformation and we read it that's why i read that scripture peter was able to pick up from the old testament something that nobody had touched until he addressed it in the way he did peter was able to pick back up from exodus 19 and i've preached this before when moses spoke something that for years hovered over them that they couldn't reconcile because under the law the line of the kings the lines of the priests were separate lines there was nowhere to mix it in fact god was so serious about that that king uzziah was killed for trying to be a priest when he was a king so moses had declared in exodus 19 now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my commandment and he's speaking for god then he shall be a peculiar treasure unto me for all people for all the earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests for years that word and that phrase hung over them they didn't know how to reconcile it and a holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel can the church say amen and then peter as a transformed man could reach back into the book of exodus and bring it present tense and he said but yeah chosen generation a royal priesthood because with this man called christ jesus who was a king and a priest he has now opened up a new line of priestly kings and kingly priests kingdom of priests royal priesthood holy nation peculiar people that he should show forth the praises of him who had called you out of darkness into this marvelous light but more than that he goes on he said which in times past were not a people in other words you don't even have to be jewish and be able to say i'm from which i believe i in the past you were not a people but i know the people of god grafting in the gentile dispensation oh come on somebody preached back to me which had not obtained mercy but no have obtained mercy can the church say man the musician could get ready i'm looking to wind down and this stone cephas peter petra rock stone is the first one to preach a message about stones he said he also has lively stones this is peter preaching his message i want you to understand that peter's books was his testimony you know oh you don't hear me this morning peter was preaching from first hand personal experience oh hallelujah built up a special house a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices and he lay that promise and that's why i have that inspiration a stone a shape stone a chainstone a transformed stone and the prophecy of lively stones because we have to follow in that same footsteps of a man and a woman whom we have made mistakes we have struggled we didn't know our identity we had this career we had this job we had this family this lineage but one day god found you he called you he met you he said you're going to be somebody else you're going to have a new walk you're going to have a new talk you're going to have a new life you're going to have a new word you're going to have a reason to shout yes you're going to make mistakes yes there might be times you deny me yes there are times you don't know where you're going but that prophecy that word that seed that predestination in your soul will speak for you when you can't speak for yourself just hold on because the upper room coming hold on there's a prophecy coming hold on there's a great transformation coming all of your trials and your ups and downs is to prepare you for that upper room experience because the peter even though he was in the upper room he was still afraid he was still petrified but all of a sudden there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled the whole house and the peter who went into that room brother terrence was a different peter who came out of that room oh you want to tell me there's no such thing as the holy ghost brother sister the promise of the holy ghost is just as real as it was in a day of pentecost and when that holy ghost filled peter's heart peter couldn't go back to the old version of himself you couldn't find the file he couldn't find your record he couldn't find the history peter could stand boldly anywhere and preach the gospel it didn't matter what you trapped him with and in fact when it was time for peter to die he said i don't mind crucifixion but oh gosh don't do it don't do me like don't do me like my lord i'm not even worthy to be crucified like jesus crucify me upside down make sure and make me properly upside down because i'm not worthy because if i like him because i'm ready to go because i know when i go i'm gonna see him oh god i know i wonder when i give up this body and i give him this tabernacle i know we have a next one waiting for me it's just waiting for me any minute now send me quickly because i know where i'm going i know where i've come from i know who called me i know my name is written i've been shaped shaped as a stone character-shaped royal priesthood friends as we get ready to close out that is your promise to be part of this royal priesthood to be part of this holy nation to be part of this peculiar people and being a priest is a duty it is not a feeling to be a priest today it's not just a title being a priest is a responsibility whether you feel like it or don't feel like it you can't be a priest and say well i have feeling to do the duties today it's a duty it's a responsibility has nothing to do with your feeling well i had a bad night nothing to do with it you're a priest you accepted this challenge you accepted this responsibility walk in it own it claim it speak it live it but abraham and preaching seven church ages he said well i don't feel like going to church he said but you're a priest it's your duty he said you've got to be there so i'm not talking to church members nowhere i'm talking about duty-bound kingly priests because you're both a king and you're a priest that's that's what this royal priesthood thing is hallelujah this is but random well i just don't feel like taking a part in this service i'll be there but already not there really he said you're a priest making a sacrifice and he's sacrificing when you don't feel like lifting your hand but when you lift your hand it's a sacrifice it takes some effort anybody wanted to make a effort i don't know if you raise your hand for this service but i want everybody to raise your hand for this service because that's a sacrifice but a brandon said when you raise your hand you defy the laws of nature the laws of gravity you're acknowledging the fact that you're reaching to somebody higher than yourself hallelujah come on you kingly priests you believe in the vine healing oh i don't know you better ask our pastor that's the prophet what do you think about it you're the priest now you had a priest in your home when you're driving in a car you are the priest in your car when he marks you at the prison in maxi when you're having a family altar you are the priest there anybody with me do you understand that as a priest their duties you do every single day have you been abandoning your priestly duties we preaching peter's messenger i'm almost done we are kingdom of priests because jesus is the great priest king lion and the lamb warned of victory for us peter got a clear revelation and understanding of this hallelujah you could begin to play something softly friends the great transformation that peter went through was by virtue of his upper room experience three and a half years under jesus ministry was powerful but it was not enough it was not enough to say i was in church i was there when he fed five thousand it was not enough to say i walked on water do you know that i was the one when they talked but he brought a walk on water that was me that was not enough to keep peter standing he was still afraid there in the upper room afraid of the persecution afraid of being just like jesus crucified undying until the promise that he had been had been breathed over him of receiving the holy ghost became a reality in front of his very eyes and then all of a sudden there was a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind fill the whole house and then that pillar of fire began to divide itself and peter standing there got his own personal liquor fire he wasn't looking at anybody else it was him and his fire it was him and his experience like moses at the burning bush it was just peter and god alone and everybody in there 120 in the upper room had their personal experience with god that changed them permanently it was more than a sermon it was more than words but it was a desire in their soul and on promise that they were building their feet on that combined into a reality to them when the holy spirit moved in friends i want to encourage you this is what peter went through was his transformation to have the bones and the confidence to say by these promises these promises we become partakers of the divine nature it's a nature that we can access the very nature of god the very attributes of god the love of god the virtue of god the the living word of god has seven manifestations of one perfect holy spirit that is our promise friends i challenge you now in a messenger token but the random said i'm trying to press upon your mind's friend that the owl has struck that something's got to be done by it i'm done we must do something it's either in or out the hour has come where the token must be there peter come to his crossroads he needed something more he needed more than a tape more than a book more than a message more than a service he wanted something on the inside and they were in one minor one accord god help us to get into one minor one accord but the brandon said he would get in one minor one accord in five minutes there'd be not a sick person in this building let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer heavenly father a simple message about a transformation of peter lord and what it means for us lord in so many ways peter depicts so much of our lives lord the uncertainty that not knowing who we were and being caught from a life that we may have planned or stumbled upon into a new walk a new talk being confronted with truths that we did not know and we would learn and come to understand and being confronted by situations that challenge us to the very core where we even disappoint ourselves and we fall short of what even we expected of ourselves peter never thought he would deny peter never thought it was in him he thought he was stronger but the situation of life was too much for him and he gave up just as he did when he walked in the water the fate he started with dwindled when he saw the winds and the environment change and he looked away from jesus father lord in my heart my burden is to help somebody this morning who has looked away from you looked away from you to situations to challenges to problems and they have lost their way and they are sinking this morning in the water lord your word said that when peter began to sink immediately you reached out and grabbed his hands and lord to help peter after he denied you three times you presented yourself to him to almost undo that experience there peter you love me declare with your own lips the same lips that declared that you're not with me i want you to declare your love for me to give peter our fate that he could stand because the devil comes as a roaring lion peter wrote that in his letter seeking whom he may devour peter knew what that meant because he went through it he went through the attack spiritual attack mental attack he went through it but he went through his transformation and the process of his transformation was greater than his failures the process of his transformation was greater than his mistakes the process of his transformation was greater than his denial and his processor transformation stood the test of time to give him the boldness for the lord we need young people with boldness we need parents with boldness we need fathers with boldness we need mothers with boldness we need children with boldness the boldness peter had to say we obey god and not man take my life do what you want to be throw me in prison it doesn't matter this means more to me than anything else father help your children today lord restore change transform deliver break shackles lord and create a burden in the heart of your people for an upper room experience because that is what matters the most lord we can preach too much we can sing too much we can never pray too much we can never seek your face too much our young people are in need father the world is falling apart lord may you put a sigh and cry in our hearts peter wept bitterly that weeping that cry is he knew he messed up and he was trying to find a reconnection he knew he wasn't living right at that time he knew what he said was not right lord help us to see our ways to see all our words our actions lord what we have said and done that lord is not right lord we repent father lord we come back to you this morning lord father to reconnect with you father if there's any back slide in our midst anyone who is struggling lord may they come to know you this morning by experience in the mighty name of jesus christ amen and amen i don't miss anybody this morning you want to talk to the lord if you know you're not been living right i want to challenge you to reconnect this morning don't let it just be a service don't let it just be words to you maybe you're here like peter maybe you're messed up maybe you deny this gospel maybe you did something that you shouldn't be doing but you recognize that today you want to reconcile friends it's early i challenge you a challenge you begin to talk to him i challenge you begin to cry out to him i challenge you to say lord i don't want to go home the way i came i saw what happened to peter but father i want that to happen to me you came and talked to peter won't you come and talk to me all over the building lift your hands with your voices cry out to him he's here this is the real reason we came friends peter's transformation means more to us because you could get the same thing too yes he could change your walk he could change your talk he could give you a supernatural experience he could change your home he could change your family he could change your heart he could help you get focused he could change your words your language he could change your attitude yes yes yes that's it that's it talk to him it's your promise that's it talk to him he's here he's
