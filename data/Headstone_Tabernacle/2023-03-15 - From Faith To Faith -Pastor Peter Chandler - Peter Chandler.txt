shall we tap our hands and give God glory um while we're just seated we could go to that very first slide I think Tech Team I just want to do you heard about this uh uh vote in the CRV and they voted to what's it marry same-sex I want to get something clear for you you might be thinking what is going on brother Bradham clarify this in 1962. he said the Beast churches core churches they are not churches let me be sure that's on record they are not churches people join them but you cannot join the Church of the Living God you're born into it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost s and when you are baptized with the Holy Ghost these virtues by the Holy Ghost and therefore he that is born of God be clear on these things the Church of the Living God is based on the Bible we can never do those things it is not hating anybody it is loving the Bible that's what it's all about I hope that helps somebody shall we stand to our feet as we go into the word I've got control here Tech Team and I want to talk today to me a very meaningful subject from faith dinner faith from Faith to Faith and I want everybody to say I'm not content [Music] [Music] so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood just look around you it's coming like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him God is never bloody foreign and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits he is Saint Luke 17 5 leak amen so faith can be increased the apostles said unto the Lord increase our faith amen Romans 1 17. for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith is amen and then Romans 10 verse 17. so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen is amen amen one Peter 1 7 Empire I said watch this that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it betrayed with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ is wonderful let's just power heads in a word of prayer no we've jumped ahead um we just we just come to take us back to the there should be a a picture and this is somewhere okay let's try again oh I don't know what happened to that picture okay let's just pray gracious God take us back as well to the start gracious God I want to thank you for your goodness and for your grace lord the devil doesn't like it but something is increasing it's getting greater it doesn't seem so but it's getting bigger God I bless and thank you today guidance stair us as we go forth in the name of Jesus Christ may we leave this place different people that we may be ready and Lord as your scripture says when the enemy comes in like a flood Ed from faith unto faith in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen you can be seated sayings God bless you richly we maybe missed a slide there but uh we're just going to move forward those are the um can we just uh it seems to be not working now okay we've read that we're going to go down to one I want to start over here brother Branham says I hope there's just one slide we've missed there okay he says I can't heal you that's very important Church brother Branham can't heal so when you're looking for healing remember brother branham's Ministry was there to to show you what to do second for fair and what things are holding it back because when we when we think of this are you the healer look you've missed everything don't look at brother Branham as a Healer Jesus has already healed you at the cross his prophetic Ministry is there to help you to know what's wrong why you're not getting healed that's our prayer Lord Jesus he used to talk to them and he used to to say things to Gary he was there as a uh like like a jack of a car as you press the jacket the car goes up and he lifted up their faith to get them to because he can't change the rules you have to have the faith I can't heal you but Jesus Christ has healed you when he died at Calvary do you believe it if God will reveal to me what you are and who you are and something about you that you will accept your healing it's not it's not William Branham that did it but he brought you up because he can't change he has to do something to show you why why I'm able to show people what they're holding back in their lives if they need to confess because the healing has already been done but he's got to find out why why aren't they being healed and remove the obstacles and then it says you're healed praise be to God so I want to get that real When you pray for healing Jesus Christ something happened like all the obstacles were removed and Christ a Christian was the one who did it in fact he healed her at the cross but she accepted what he's already done hallelujah let's go a bit further with this amen it's sticking can you just help me to go across something must be good going to happen when this starts maybe we can change this around see if you can take a shot press it one more time I depend on this he says healing he says when I'm gone when William branham's gone which he is when I'm gone healing isn't gone that is healing when I'm gone healing isn't gone are you ready I expect a big amen on this healing ought to even be more than it was before we came here after brother healing should have gone from Faith to Faith it should have gone even higher he says healing ought to be more we shouldn't we say oh the prophet's gone no no because Jesus Christ has already healed us can you shout a big Amen on that one he says healing ought to be more please than it was before we came here that's the purpose is to get the people in their minds in the spirit of the last days we are in the latter day he said do you believe that the world is in the spirit of the latter days the blessing this marriage that marriage we don't hate anybody whatever [Music] impossible but may God wants his church so in the spirit they will just fit in wherever God leaves them that's what we want we don't want Jesus to say to us little faith we don't want that we have heard the word that has come to the prophet it says the world but God wants the church so in the spirit wherever he leaves them they'll go he says he if we can't have faith for Divine Healing [Music] are we going to have for the rapture friend I mean there's a Time coming that when there is a church a rising upper Church it should be more than when brother Brandon was here it shouldn't be less No it should be even more we can't have faithful Divine Healing how are we going to have faith for the Rapture we've got to move out friends we've got to get out of this Old Slow Church conditions cut the shoreline get out somewhere where you lose all sense of fears I doubt my doubts amen I wear all things are possible Faith from Faith to Faith praise be to God I feel like the disciples increase my faith Lord are possible amen amen you know I put the picture on the moon you remember those great words this is one small step for man I'm gonna remember but one huge step for mankind I'm telling you church when brother Brown that was a huge step for mankind because that was the end of the world the seventh seal ends and ends time huge steps and he said he even said I believe those standards will be revealed to get the bride together for what rapturing faith because what we've got now we wouldn't be able to do it something yeah we've got to step father we hardly have faithful Divine Healing hardly have faith for that we've got to have faith to be changed in a moment to be swept up out of the earth and we'll find that after a while we'll find where it's written that's what's happening the world is in there you can't add to the Bible it's all hiding in there it has to come out it will come out when he finds a Believer he'll come out of hiding Glory hallelujah amen it says uh we've got to have faith to be changed what we've got now your battle was just Divine healers we've got to go from Faith to Faith from just healing faith rapturing faith we've got to be at that level if you want to go in the Rapture you better plant a seed in your heart that's the only way this is gonna work it says faith to be changed it's something that's got to got to take place we are way up forgive this picture trying to show you the rapture the coming of the Lord Jesus we've got to have a rapturing faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we've got to have Rapture in faith oh we will not go okay oh we will not go if we haven't got rapturing faith because God can't change it for you know Elijah you know you have to have the rapturing faith and rapturing faith is in the messages Faith cometh bye and hearing the word of God we've got to have rapturing faith in a church that can be changed in a moment isn't that sobering it'll be there it'll be there when the power of this church Rises I want the power of that church Rises it'll bring its Brethren and the other Brethren and there'll be a general Resurrection don't worry it'll be there Hallelujah so when you get home tonight Say it'll be there my family will be raptured I can't understand it amen Abraham he took Isaac to the mountain well I see the wood I mean where's the sacrifice you can say to Abraham it'll be there it'll be there don't worry it'll be there God created that Ram out of nothing [Music] [Music] every day if the devil tells you that you're still there say Satan be careful I've got more faith every day something bigger is in my heart today I will have more faith than yesterday we we've got to have rapturing face no matter what's going on the hair was growing out even if you feel like I'm in a prison the hair is growing even if you did that again the hair is growing mistake again the hair is growing hallelujah it's growing the Covenant is growing and the devil can't stop it precept upon prison something's growing in your heart from faith and to Faith hallelujah amen you're growing slowly you have to grow praise be to God it'll be there praise be to God you're always pointing to how Wicked the world things are bad you know things not good out there and it's true but you fail to see how powerful the church is getting at the same time they're getting bad you know what's going on out there but the church is getting more powerful amen the church is growing stronger from Faith to Faith to Faith Hallelujah God is raising up or standing he will not stand by something's raising up all the time you fail to see how powerful the church is getting at the same time she's rising up she's standing on the field she's a little flock God is with us and she's going to Triumph just as certain as Christ rose from the dead God's Church shall never failure it shall never failure the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it won't Prevail against you because you are built on the Rock and that rock is Jesus hallelujah amen the Gates of Hell will not Prevail but the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against you brother hey man we're not prepare brother Freeman of every man because of what you're standing on Amen be very sure be very sure your faith is built upon the solid Little Rock Hallelujah praise the Lord let's keep our hands for the Lord amen the Gate of Hell shall Prevail against it don't Prevail against you can't Prevail it shows they would be against it they are against you amen but they cannot Prevail the church is going to triumphant Faith after Faith after Faith they cannot Prevail the church has got a Triumph through the blood of Jesus to the victory march you're going to go through trials all those trials bad [Music] praise be to God the Gates of Hell will not Prevail if we could only realize those things it shows what you're going through is for our Goods when the critics come up to you it's for our good simple not again it is written in the scriptures trials are brought upon us they are more precious to us than gold for it is God giving us these trials after we all things work together for good to them that love the Lord he said every trial is to come to perfect us for his glory I like this last part to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real than what he was before the truth amen he makes it more real in the trial amen the three Hebrew boys went in the fire but he was more real by the problem but it takes you through the problem doesn't take away the pain but it gives you the ability to handle the pain doesn't take you out the storm but Faith calms you in the midst of the storm Hallelujah it won't take it away but it will change they all said all these Giants but Caleb never saw giants they were because of the comparative size of his God I uh glory to God love bears all things love charity it Bears all things it believes all things what it hopes all things [Music] but to increase my faith [Applause] leave the enemy there listening don't bother him but increase my faith to fight him I'm saying a big thing here there's many things in life don't wish to take away the problem but pray for the grace to handle that problem don't pray to change God's mind that's the wrong attitude attitude the prayer should be the prayer said hey Lord change me increase my faith Lord change me to fit your word not change not let me change your mind you change my mind change my mind to your will is written here you make everything work for good if you he will lead you I thank you foreign even death [Applause] I'll look at you every Sunday you look the same but you're not the same something is going on God is in control amen you you don't join churches you're baptized by the holy spirit amen amen and you have a blood tag that's what's going on praise be to God says many shall run to and fro but the people somebody's saying that to me that know their God shall do exploits in that day they that know their God the Bible says that Faith therefore it says you go from Faith to Faith the prophet said Faith the prophet is something you know something you know you can't I'm gonna try to believe you you can't try to believe you are the belief or you don't believe the people that know their God shall do exploit in that day God's Revelations to his church sit still Little Flock positionally stay where you are don't worry God is waiting [Music] to get the mystery of God reveal to the church because Christ is the mystery of God revealed [Music] is this great Supernatural power that really Lays dormant in the church there's power in you amen don't worry God's gonna get that mystery to you Hallelujah the devil doesn't like it but we're walking with the King praise the Lord they that know their God shall do at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God should be finished [Music] who God is they never acted like us probably men of few words just one not from God God just nodded Hallelujah maybe God is nodding to you maybe there's something he wants you to do one little note from God how could they know how could they know they had the virtues qualifications and the first little nod to the premiere of God compared with everything here and they knew it was the word of God and away they went yeah they didn't have to worry about nothing else something is rising here something is getting bigger amen is getting more powerful your prayers are changing hey man if you want yourself to change your language if you change your language you will change yourself amen start confessing bigger things God can move that mountain for me if you want bigger things not just a faith everybody says Donald Trump says that remember Donald Trump lady everybody got faith we want to go from faith okay [Music] again not just a face everybody but a perfect faith Build It Up In Here yes by his perfect word which is sharper than a two-way sword we are coming now to the Perfection because people has to come to this amen amen they have to come to this in order for the Rapture you can't do your thing for sure you can't have Frank Sinatra faith I did it my way you can't have that Faith no you've got to have perfect faith in order for the Rapture that's what's holding it away waiting for that church to come to that perfect raptured faith I said foreign because the revelations is you cannot have a revelation in Revelation without it being faith hallelujah amen this is a revelation because it's something that's been revealed to you I will build my church the gates of hell would I Prevail faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to Abraham Abraham he would call anything contrary to what was revealed to him as though it wasn't so son existed Abraham now faith that is what faith is the revelation of God the church is built upon Revelation Revelation the whole entire body amen was saved by revelation foreign I'm expecting expectations expectation I know what God's about to do let your subconscious God reacting then the faith of God will confirm we'll back it up because your faith it won't do much you need to go from Faith to Faith from your faith to God's faith you have to go you have to do that God's faith Moves In Love foreign [Music] he says if you've got aim he said that's the problem people have a mental Faith instead of heart Faith you have to go from mental Faith to Heart Faith from Faith to Faith if you say you believe and you don't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost sentence me then you you you you you you do not it your faith isn't accepted in the sight of God you've got a mental Faith give me heart Faith with the heart man believes it's not something you think here you believe with your heart you can't even explain it but you know it's going to take place Las Vegas you have mental Faith instead of heart faith when you are true when you truly believe God is under obligation to pour the Holy Ghost on you amen amen is under obligation to do it he says don't let it come here I believe I've been to Jeffersonville and and it's wonderful I believe but don't let it come on your natural thinking let it drop down on the inside that subconscious once it drops down here this is your children are yours all your prayer requests are yours God give them to you when you've got it down here whatever you have in your heart two seconds and you ask for it when you pray believe you receive what you asked foreign foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] be some glory after Glory we should be way up the road the world is look what they're doing now they're in their Spirits let's get in our Spirits let's get into our Spirits revelation after Revelation power after power he says you shall see me for I'll be with you all the way to the consummation changing from Luther to Wesley from Glory unto Glory Faith unto faith I'm still the same God that lived and going back to the original Glory yeah amen he has broken every denomination of veil every sound barrier he says oh that's foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] in the name of Jesus I love you Lord and I can't believe that we won't have rapturing faith because your word is clear your word is very clear even if you have to create it it will be there there might be somebody raised their hand and say please just pray for me I will break through that barrier and go from speed to speed from Faith to Faith from glory to glory from Victory to Victory May you just take charge lord I Love You Lord father may you touch every person that's humbly lifted up their hands this might be your moment I want to break that barrier maybe there's a barrier you
