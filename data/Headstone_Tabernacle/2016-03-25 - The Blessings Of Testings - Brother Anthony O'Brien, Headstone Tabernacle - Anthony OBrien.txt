evening so let's turn to our Bibles amen certainly want to praise God go to the scripture um amen I have three portion of the scripture thank you musicians amen I want to read firstly in the Book of Job Job chapter 1 and then we we'll read from 1 Peter chapter 1 and then and then Revelation 3 amen but um first we we read from job job chapter 1 amen Job chapter 1 and verse one says there was a man in the land of oo whose name was joob and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and issued evil and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters his substance also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels and 500 yoke of oxen and 500 she asses and a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East and his sons went and feasted in in their houses and everyone his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and drink with them and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and Sanctified them and Rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts thus do did job continually now in verse six says now there was a a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them and the Lord said unto Satan whence Thou come when comest thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fr in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou uh considered my servant joob that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth God and isth Evil then Satan answered the Lord and said do job fear God for not Hast not Thou made an hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every sign thou was bless the work of his hands and his substances increase in the land but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he had hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord now let's turn over to First Peter chapter 1 and then we'll go over to [Music] Revelation uh chapter 3 okay so 1 Peter chapter 1 Hallelujah uh first Peter first p chapter 1 and uh verse three um we read verse 3 to verse 7 okay so verse three says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant mer Mercy hath begotten us again in a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ and our last scripture we'll read is from uh Revelation chapter 3 amen and and then we'll uh say a word of prayer Revelation 3 and ver14 and this is the message unto the Church of Leia and it says unto unto the angel of the church chch of leans of the lisans WR these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou would cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee from out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked Verse 18 says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with thyselves that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and Jason be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my uh in my throne even as I am I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that had in ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches may God have blessing through his word let's just bow our head just one more time Heavenly Father we read your word this evening and Lord we praying tonight that your holy spirit will come down in a special way Lord and anoint these scriptures dear God lord anoint the thought that your

name we pray amen and amen you may have your seats amen do you love the Lord tonight amen praise God hallelujah hallelujah well I have a thought I'd like to give it a title and my title is the blessings of testings amen am amen amen the blessings of testings all right amen amen do you love him tonight are you happy tonight how many know that they are blessed tonight you are blessed beyond measure Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus came Hallelujah not just for the world but he came for you also isn't that right he left his home in glory praise God Amen Hallelujah and came and and and paid the price so that you and I could have a chance at Salvation that you and I could have a chance at Redemption the only reason that we are sitting in this building tonight is because the blood of Christ is hanging over you tonight amen that's the only way that you could come into the presence of God was through his blood he made a way that you could make it that he made a way that you could have access to the throne of God he made a way that you could pray with faith believing Hallelujah and receive amen whatever you have need of he made a way for your family he made a way for your children he made a way Hallelujah because he made that way we are here tonight you can shake each other's hands tonight you can tell somebody God bless you tonight because somebody made a way for us that we could be called the sons of God isn't that right Bible say that he came unto his own and his own receive him not but as many as receive him to them give he power to become the sons of God not all could receive him but God knew who would receive him before the foundation of the world he put something special inside of you and he knew that you would receive him oh somebody say amen hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right amen so every son and daughter of God tonight has a right to the blessings of God I'll say that again every son and daughter of God right here tonight has a right to the blessings of God he had you have a right to every blessing that Jesus died for Hallelujah he was bruised for all iniquity the chastisement of his peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed when he died healing was released when he died the Holy Ghost was released when he died the curtain was rent in TW from the top to the bottom isn't that right only the priest had access to the inside with the Articles and so on but when Jesus died we were made Kings we were made priests we were given access rights to that of the father isn't that right every blessing that you needed every every blessing that you wanted you could have it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that [Applause] right hallu amen amen amen hallelujah so we're going to talk a little about blessings first praise God hallelujah because Jesus died that you could live Jesus died that you could have eternal life he didn't die for you to just come to church and to occup fire a church pew no no no but he died to make us Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah Hal he didn't come for the world but he come for them that he had called he come for his predestinated ones he come for those who would endure to the end he come for those who could take the trials he come for those who could take the testings some fall on thorny and they jump up for a little while but the cares of Life wrap around them and they don't last very long some fall on the Wayside oh Hallelujah some fall on Stony ground but God's looking for those tonight who fell on good ground who with a good and honest heart receive the word of God and they not ashamed of it come on now they appreciate it they embrace it inwardly and openly they're not afraid to worship God they're not afraid to praise God they're not afraid to to smile in the face of adversity because they know whose son they are they know whose daughter they are and they know that no weapon formed against them will ever Prosper because that's what Jesus died for come on now say amen he died for you he died for me he laid on the cross oh and when he said it was finished the devil didn't understand what that meant but one time time he come down in hell and he knock on the door and when the devil opened the door there was Jesus he took the keys of death and Hell the devil don't have the keys no more tonight Jesus got the keys and he is breaking you out of prison tonight I don't care how bound you feel you just begin to worship God I don't care how bound you feel you just begin to praise your God and you watch the CH fall off of you because Jesus got the keys and anytime Jesus is in the building he can unlock your mind tonight he could unlock your spirit he could unlock that no praise demon somebody say Amen oh isn't that right so this is a time to praise God this is a time to celebrate the name of Jesus Hallelujah this is when the lamb died in history goats died Bullocks died sheep died oxen died many of them died but they couldn't obliterate sin they couldn't remove it entirely oh Hallelujah to keep coming back and making more offerings making more sacrifices but they came that perfect sacrifice oh had that perfect sacrifice that obliterated sin completely as if you never did it in the first place when God look at you he don't see your faults come on now say Amen when God look at you he don't see your mistakes he sees you perfect through the blood oh Hallelujah you have a perfect standing tonight because somebody took a stand you have a perfect standing tonight through the blood through the blood oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right Jesus died so that we could have all rights you didn't know you had rights you were born in sin shaping iniquity coming the world speaking lies you didn't know who your father was you were like an orphan praise God you had no owner you didn't know your history you didn't know your lineage you didn't know who your brother was who your sister was and the enemy took advantage of you and told you whatever he wanted to tell you he told you look for God here and you couldn't find him he told you to look for your father there and you couldn't find him and he used you and abused you and told you what he wanted to tell you but one day Jesus came into your life and you realized that you are not an orphan but you belong to somebody somebody was looking for you all your life and you didn't know him but he made himself known to you in Simplicity Jesus Christ The Humble one the meek one made himself known to you and I tonight oh that's why I praise him the way I praise him that's why I shout the way I shout that's why I can go through the trials we can go through the test because we know who our father is we are not orphans but we belong to God God and we go back to God oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah amen is that right here's a prophet on the breach between the seven Church ages he said he did it for me Charlie he did it for you he did it for the whole human race and now he comes forth to claim his Redemptive rights bam said claim it for who not for himself but for us isn't that right he said he's one of us he's our kin folks Oh my he said he's my brother he's my savior he's God he's my kinsman redeemer he's all for what was I without him or what could I be without him so you see he's my all and he's standing there as our kin folks and now he's been interceding for us up till this time and now he comes forth what for and takes the book of redemption to claim his rights of what he did for us oh hallelujah hallelujah Hal so when he descended on high he the bleeding bloody lamb and John was weeping because no man was found worthy to take the book and to loose the seals thereof because in that book was our name in that book was all rights in that book was all right to Healing all right to Deliverance all right to the Holy Ghost in that book was our way of Escape out of this world but there was nobody worthy to get that book and to loose the contents of it but here come a bleeding bloody lamb having been slain seven eyes and seven horns he staggered forward no devil could stop him he was a mighty conqueror he staggered forward drenched in blood but he took that book and all in heaven all on the Earth heard I John praise God hallelujah hallelujah what does that mean when you understand the magnitude of what Christ has done for us you can't help but give God worship when the magnitude when the gravity of what God has done for you drops upon you you can't help but praise your God and worship your God to see how far he brought us from he brought you out of the myy clay he put your foot on a rock he brought you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light so that we could give him praise oh somebody praise him tonight somebody worship him tonight oh do you know your redeemer live it oh amen amen hallelujah is right my God see uh what he did for us see they did they died Jesus said he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day no matter if he falls asleep in the First Watch in the second or in the third or fourth four the fifth or the sixth or seventh wherever he falls asleep brother bam says what will happen The Trumpet Of God shall sound and the last Trump Will Blast forth the same time that that last Angel is giving his message and the last seal is open that last trumpet will sound and the Redeemer comes forth to take his redeemed possessions his church The Blood Washed oh hallelujah hallelujah do you believe it tonight yeah amen hallelujah so you are his church the blood wash made up of individuals who see their names on the book isn't that right Hallelujah okay let's read this here from expectations Prophet said Satan hasn't got any legal rights at all over a Christian I'm going to read that again so you can give me a bigger amen Satan hasn't got any legal rights at all over a Christian oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's right every time a man gets saved listen to this God just writes out a whole big bunch of checks like that and he puts his name at the bottom and said here they are fill them out the prophet said are you scared of it he said fill it out whatever you desire things you desire he said when you pray believe you receive it and it shall be given to you oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh so when you come to church you come with your checkbook that Jesus already signed at the bottom and whatever you want tonight you fill it out if you want healing fill it out if you want the Holy Ghost fill it out if you want your children put down their name one by one put the middle name too but they coming out because that's what Jesus died for oh somebody say Amen oh don't be afraid he said are you scared of it oh just fill it out tonight fill out your joy come on fill out your peace fill out hallelujah hallelujah amen amen Every Blessing belongs to you isn't that right Hallelujah St Mark 11:24 he said see just believe it and every word of God is a seed that will bring forth he said it'll bring forth what it's purposed for he said I me I seen many of you down here raising cotton and apples peaches and fruits and so forth he said when that little apple tree is no bigger than that right there every Apple that'll ever be in that tree is in it right then so I guess he was looking at a sapling or a young tree look like it can't bear fruit and so on but he said no matter uh no no matter if it's no bigger than that right there he said every Apple that'll ever be in that tree is in it right then it has the potentials to bring forth H 100f 100 fold isn't that right Hallelujah it doesn't look like much it doesn't seem like much Hallelujah but it has a potential to be great and you have the potential tonight to do great things in God when God look at you Joel said he saw a mighty Army when God look at you he see a super Church a super race a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people the devil has underestimated us tonight he didn't understand what this book thing was all about but it's too late devil because before the foundation of the world he wrote our names in Blood and he gave us a promise oh Hallelujah receive you the Holy Ghost behold I send the promise of my father upon you oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh say Amen somebody Hallelujah the devil Li us the devil has played up with our minds played up with our thinking messed up with our emotions but no matter what he do how he confuses the waves of a human Spirit there's one thing in the soul that is settled in heaven forever that's the word of almighty God and the devil can't change that he is very upset tonight because because he cannot change what is about to happen to you he cannot change what is about to take place in your life he cannot change the blessings that are upon you right now oh somebody say amen hallelujah isn't that right see the devil gave up his estate in heaven Hallelujah isn't that right he forfeited his right Hallelujah as a son and decided to tell lies and decided to glorify himself and magnify himself and he took a portion of heaven with him isn't that right and those Fallen Angels they had a battle up there there was a battle of war going on in the heavenlies a holy war of occupation and God said it's not fit to you to be here so he kicked him out of heaven and he and his angels fell down upon the earth and the battle has started in heaven is continuing down here on Earth so God decide to send his sons too because he know that they're going to give him a run for his money they know that he going to run them out of town when they see the name on the book oh Hallelujah and when you see who your father is when you see what your possession is you chase the devil out of town you chase him out of your life you chase him out of the church praise God oh Hallelujah [Applause] amen oh my Hallelujah hallu dozens of bushels of apples is in that little tree right then he said why you say brother Branham brother Bram no well he said where they come from if they're not he said they're right in the tree right they're in the tree right then he said now the only thing the little tree you stick it in the ground and plant it and it has to grow it has to draw the moisture from the ground and it has to draw more than what its a lotted portion is he said if you give it plenty of water you have to give it plenty of water and he said when you give it water it just drinks and drinks and drinks drinks till it can't hardly drink no more and then it starts pushing out and it pushes out limbs it pushes out leaves it push P out blossoms it pushes out apples and the apples was inside of it at the beginning and and it just had to drink and he said every man that's born again in Christ Jesus everything you have need of your healing he said Satan will afflict you sure he will but everything you have need of in the whole life's journey is in you right then he said we are planted in Christ Jesus see what I mean he said when you're born again and and the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come into your heart and you have everything that you need of for the journey he said the only you have to do is start drinking and drinking pushing out pushing out pushing out he said I believe he said here's my analysis of Christ Jesus he says he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life and every man that's planted in him can drink and drink and push out and push out every Redemptive blessing that God has promised because it belongs to you it's your personal property oh Hallelujah so are you here to push out tonight push a little bit if you want some Joy push a little bit if you want some Holiness push a little bit oh you want your joy back you want your Victory back you can't be afraid to push we are here to press our way tonight press your way pass the circumstance forget about who's around you forget about who's in front of you forget about who's behind you you are responsible for your own blessing you are responsible for what you get in this service it's not the Deacon's fault it's not the Usher's fault get up and worship God do something about the word that has been preached to you all these years oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah hallelu you can't blame the pastor you can't blame the minister you can't blame the eldership you have to bring forth fruit Jesus wasn't talking to no group he was talking to individuals he said ye abide in me and if my word abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you I am the vine come on now you are the branches the branch cannot bear fruit of itself God needs us tonight if you're ever going to bring forth fruit [Applause] oh give him praise tonight hallelujah amen amen [Applause] amen and it's a death it kills you because you're going past a threshold of yourself that you didn't think you could you could get to and you're pushing amen and then a part of your will is dying a part of who you are is rotting it's smelly but there's a process taking place God is transforming you making you into the real Sun that you supposed to be at the beginning but we fell from that bypass o theophany and drop down into flesh what for to be tested to be tried to be proven so it is a struggle because we're moving from imperfection to Perfection and you cannot allow these things of the world to hold you down if you ever want to get the Perfection so tonight you better make up your mind to push your way push out everything oh Hallelujah that is in your way and press towards Perfection press towards the mark of the high calling in Jesus Christ oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right it's hard Jesus knows it he walked up that hill he was beaten he was mocked he was scourged the Bible said amen isn't that right uh uh for a while you will have sorrow while the world is having Joy but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy H that's a promise for you so when Jesus was going through the cross his his his his focus wasn't what was happening right now but what he had his eye on was the prize at the end of the road that's what Jesus was looking at he was looking at those names on the book that was a prize at the end of the road so he struggled he took a lash here blood poured out flesh burst out he screamed but he saw you in the end he saw you on the Finishing Line and he said I'm coming for you don't 10,000 Devils on my right snakes hissing on my left they yell crucify him crucify him but he was was coming because you was on his mind and he struggled and he fell down he picked the cross up but you were on his mind and tonight he made it our savior made it praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh here we stand Victorious amen amen because of a risen savior isn't that right oh my Hallelujah okay we continue

hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah amen hallu he said and the devil hasn't got any TI to it at all he hasn't got any legal rights he said his legal rights were spoiled at Calvary my he said I can see him when he died there and walked down at Calvary down through the state steps are he passed by those Souls that were in prison that repented not not in the days of Noah he knocked at that door he said oh you should have heard a message of the prophet he said on down he went into hell knocked at the door and Satan opened up and said oh so after all you got here did you said I thought I had you when I slayed Abel I was sure I had you when I put Daniel in the Lion's then the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace butam said Christ was in every one of them then said when I beheaded John I thought I had you then and then I thought I had you on Calvary but now you're here and he said I can hear him say Satan I am the Virgin born son of God he said and my blood is still dripping from that cross Yonder he said and I have come down to take over you made people fear and scared of them run around everything else he said you can't do it no more he said give me the keys of death and hell and he took them from his side and he hung them on his side and he walked up through them other stair steps and knocked on the door brother Bram said I could hear a a shouting meeting going on in there he said and there stood Abraham and Isaac Jacob Sarah Rebecca Isaiah Jeremiah all of the prophets he said I could hear them knocking at the door and said who is there and he said Abraham open up the door said why there's the Seed of Abraham he said here's the root and offspring of David here's that stone that Isaiah saw cut out of the mountain without hands be laid on oh Hallelujah there's Jesus Christ isn't that right oh hallelujah hallelujah there was this Prophet there was that Prophet each of them was living out Christ and they didn't know it oh hallel but when they saw him they said here's a wheel in the middle of the wheel they said here is the Rock of Ages they said here is a strong and mighty tower the true Hebrew boy said there's that F man in the fire oh Hallelujah they all saw him in their own season and time he said oh fools and slow of heart didn't you know the prophets oh Hallelujah spoke of me oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen hallelujah isn't that right wonderful praise God Amen okay a few more here praise God and then I'll uh and then I'll switch over believe us th this he said um now here's what happens sin is what brought sickness into the world sickness is as a result of sin so he said now before we had any sickness we had no sin and When sin came sickness was a results of sin so Jesus came to rid us of sin and to rid he said there's not a gospel preacher in the world but what would believe that Jesus Christ died for our sins he said well uh that's where it's at here he said up this place here now watch close he said here's here's where he paid the price and then he died for a sin as a result of his death sickness fell right with it see he said in other words if my foot was what you wanted to kill he said kill the head and you've got the foot see the foot goes in with it now said that's when he atoned for our sins he atoned for the sins results and sickness is an attribute of sin and Jesus died for our sins and sickness iniquity he said all was included in his death for our sins he said you see it he said then when he died for the sins of the world there at Calvary he healed you and you and you and you and you he said he healed every one of you oh hallelujah hallelujah he said you are already he oh somebody say amen he said he's already forgiven you of your sins if you just accept it oh Hallelujah isn't that right the price is already paid tonight so the devil is only bluffing you telling that you can't make it telling you that you can't overcome telling you that you can't be a son or a daughter of God but he's only bluffing you because Christ has already given us what it takes to overcome the devil when he died we died and when he rose we rose with him oh hallelujah hallelujah that's why the Bible says we are more than conquerors through him that loved us we are more than Overcomers tonight oh Hallelujah we are more than we think we are more than we feel we are not what we feel we are what God says about us we are what the word says about us tonight oh Hallelujah and in his word is joy in his word is peace in his word is longsuffering gentleness meekness kindness the love of God in his word is the Holy Ghost for you there's a promise for you and for your family and for your children that's what Jesus died for oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah give him praise tonight amen my he said now you don't go to hell because you're a sinner said no you go to hell because you refuse to accept the way away from hell he said there's a bypass and he said that's Christ there's a bypass from your sickness quick death premature grave he said that's through Christ but now he said your you sinned in the beginning and Christ died for your sins therefore he saved you when he died he saved you and he healed healed you he when he died he took your place and now all you have to do is accept it by faith and you'll receive it see see what I mean now he said now there's nothing more to be done already paid for man you just reach up and grab it tonight amen he said you can have it right this afternoon he said you can have it right now this very minute when you believe it your faith meets God's requirement to believe that Christ died for your sickness when he died for your sins and he died for your sins at Calvary and accepted upon that basis at that moment and you're healed in the sight of God see then you go on testifying of it believe it amen amen isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah so Christ died so that we could have every right to come into the house of God and to sanctify ourselves and to wait on the promise of the father Hallelujah and the promise of the Holy Ghost the promise of d damic is yours tonight praise God how you can have it if you want it you can have a Revival if you want it because that's what Jesus died for isn't that right so we have a right as Christians isn't that right a right to Joy a right to peace a right to health a right to strength a right to Salvation a right to praise God a right to worship your God doesn't matter where you are no matter who's looking at you praise God don't be ashamed to cry out the name of Jesus oh Hallelujah a right to sing a right to shout a right to Rejoice a right to dance a right to testify of God's mercy and goodness in your life you have that right tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right my praise God hallelujah amen amen amen hallelujah so God has made us citizens of the kingdom of God by Jesus Christ isn't that right amen amen and we belong to a place Heavenly places in Christ Jesus because that's our position in Christ in Heavenly places not Earthly places Earthly places is not your home it's not about your job it's not about how much money you can make it's not about how much money you got in a bank it's not about how much houses you own you could own a million cars but when God puts gives you a place in heaven there's no man could take that from you because only God could put you in your place and only in your place can you be effective to the kingdom and in the body of Christ is where you find your place in him oh Hallelujah isn't that right isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so we are striving with all that is in us to find our place in Christ we don't belong in this world we don't belong in this in this turmoil and This Disaster that they call the world Hallelujah isn't that right this world is headed for funeral service this world is headed for the end the inevitable end they cannot stop the mouth of God that has already spoken America is already judged Los Angeles is already judged isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah Hal God has already pronounced judgment over them and God has pronounced a blessing for us here tonight who can stay with his word those who can endure to the end oh isn't that right Jesus said he that endureth to the end the shame shall be saved he said many will run to and fro and and and there'll be earthquakes and pestilences earthquakes in diverse places isn't that right many false prophets arise up and false teachings and leading the Sheep away but those that will endure to the end the same shall be saved God had to put something special in us in our time and in our season to give us what it take to endure to the end this is not for the faint of heart but this is for those who could endure unto the end Jesus said a servant is no greater than his Lord that's right he said the world hated me before I even came in it and he said if the world hates me they'll hate you too isn't that right he said they deliver you up to be afflicted and persecute you he said but don't you worry I'll give you the words to speak to them I'll put words in your mouth to say to them and to prophesy up unto them and to preach the gospel he said that is when the end will come not all these signs and terrifying things he say don't look for that but he said this gospel must be preached then shall the End come oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right praise God Amen okay where was I amen so God has made US citizens of the kingdom of God by Jesus Christ isn't that right Ephesians 2 and verse 12 says that in that time you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope and without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is is our peace isn't that right who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us oh there was a wall separating you from being a Son of God there was a wall separating us from being all that we could do but Jesus broke down that wall Tonight Paul called it the wall of partition between us he said having abolished in his flesh the enity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make himself of Twain of one one new man so making peace he said and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were a far off and to them that were nigh for through him we have both access by one Spirit unto the father oh isn't that right he said now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners you are not a stranger here tonight you are not a foreigner here tonight here what you are he said but fellow citizens with the Saints and with the household of God oh isn't that right and are built upon the foundations of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone oh hallah isn't that right in whom all the building fitly framed together growth up into an Holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah amen amen so we become joint a isn't that right and I looked up the meaning of the joint air a joint air according to law reference uh this definition here gives says it's a person who shares with another or others the right to inherit a person's money property or title when that person dies so apparently you only become a joint air it only becomes effective when that person dies oh Hallelujah Hal isn't that right you were born in sin shaping iniquity coming the world speaking lies Christ knew what you had in you he knew that you would be a Son of God but in order for it to be effective he had to die and his death put a law into effect Hallelujah his death put a law into motion oh Hallelujah the law of Christ Jesus is what sets us free to tonight from the law of sin and death oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah no wonder there will be a bride that will not see death because there's a higher Lord tonight that has connected us to Christ by his blood and by his sacrifice and has made us Kings and Priests oh somebody's not hearing me tonight no wonder that John said we shall rain on the earth because his name was redeemed from out of the Lamb's Book of Life oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh you've been made a joint air with Christ hallu hallelujah hallelujah whatever the father has you have access to whatever it is isn't that right hallelujah it's like being a citizen of a country and the country provide Health uh benefits and this kind of benefit and that kind of benefit and the only reason why the people don't have have it is because they don't access it some people don't know their rights some people don't know they could go and appeal their case they just sit down and take it and say well I'll just let it go on but when you know your rights ohel you ready to challenge any opposition when you know your rights you are ready to plead your case because you know there's recourse for you there's recompense for you and when the enemy come like a flood we have a right tonight the spirit of God is promised to raise up a standard against the enemy so when the enemy come we looking for the spirit because the spirit has to be there in order to raise up a standard and fulfill his own word in your life oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right my praise God hallelujah that's why we ought to praise God every day the footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord hallelujah you didn't come this way praise God by a fluke by accident God brought you here tonight hallelujah hallelujah now watch something my title is the blessings of testings right so now God just doesn't want us to stay with his blessings he wants to take us to another level tonight isn't that right Hallelujah he wants to really have the preeminence in us and in order to do that he has to take us through a process isn't that right and by this process God could use us isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right so we come out we come out to follow God In His blessings and Promises praise God hallelujah isn't that right it's like Abraham when he was called God spoke to him and told him come out and follow me yeah isn't that right Abraham is comfortable with his family comfortable with his surroundings comfortable with his environment yet there's a call of God on his life to step out from his comfort zone and to go to a place that he doesn't know about and he is relying and trusting entirely on God hallelujah because he doesn't know where he is going God told him come out to a place that I will show you so he is not relying on any GPS he is not relying on any map or any guide to show him it would take God to lead him out because he is following the voice of God and he is following the call of God on his life isn't that right but the Bible says along with Abraham lot was also there isn't that right every step of the journey since he started he and lot have been out traveling together hallelujah hallelujah and God couldn't really bless him until he had separated himself from lot and God Hallelujah the situation became so that it forced the issue of Separation isn't that right the issue became so hot lot and his Hersman start to act up and Abraham his Hersman start to fight and there was war in the family and sometime God causes confusion sometime God causes situation sometime God causes things in your life and you find it unfair but that is God inside your picture trying to turn you upside down because there's some things that you still holding on to there's some things that you won't let go there's some pride that you won't give up there's lust that you won't give up there's some things of the world that you are not willing to part with yet and God is going to turn you upside down until he gets those things out of you somebody say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah war in the family war in the home Strife between lot's man and Abraham's men isn't that right and Abraham say I fed up do what you want to do if you go left I go right if you go right I go left but we cannot continue like this and that's how God wants you he want to get you fed up of yourself Fed Up of the situation Fed Up of the circumstance Fed Up of making circles in the desert oh hallelujah hallelujah when are you going to get fed up of yourself when are you going to get tired of wasting time turn you northward God has a promise for us tonight oh come on now say Amen God has a holy ghost for you God has blessings for you that your mind is not yet able to comprehend you can't yet wrap your mind about what God is about to do oh Halle no eye has seen no air has heard what God has in store for you tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah but we hold our own s back hallel because we won't let go [Music] Foolish Pride holding on to things that are temporal the things that have an end and God wants to give you a World Without End Hallelujah Hal holding on to things that will fade away and God has Eternity for you Hallelujah hallel God has all his his his blessings for you tonight amen isn't that right God has a mansion for you Hallelujah Hal prepared for you a body a new home for your soul your soul is travel traveling in this world it's weary it's tired it wants to go home oh separate yourself tonight H your soul wants to go back to its maker oh that is where you belong tonight lot say fine we separate God was so happy they had that conversation he was waiting for that conversation a long time even since Abraham left but he had to give it time he had to let things play out he had to let the situation worsen he had to let Abraham talk up cuz I guess Abraham wasn't that kind of a guy but but the situation forc his hand to say something to do something about what was taking place and God is going to force your hand until you do something about the situation because he can't bless you until you're ready to let go Hallelujah and when he separated himself from lot lot pitches T towards Sodom isn't that right and the Bible said he end up in Sodom isn't that right and as soon as that happened God spoke to Abraham and said look to the north look to the South look to the East look to the West he said all is yours I couldn't tell you that before when he was tied up in that family thing I couldn't tell you that before when he was tied up in that group thing when he was tied up in that organization thing but now that you've come out now that you've separated yourself God could not speak to the individual the way he wants to he could now try you like he wants to he could now test you like he wants to he could now have the preeminence without interference from other people's voices that's what God wants a clean line of communication amen isn't that right no hacks no break-ins no interruptions he wants to be able to speak lip to air to his Sons and Daughters isn't that right Hallelujah isn't that right that's the kind of communications he had with Adam in the beginning and that's the kind of communications he's longing to have again Hallelujah isn't that right Hallelujah but he has to separate you from the world and bring you out praise God into what he has for you isn't that right okay amen hallelujah isn't that right my he was separated and then God blessed him see God revealed his secrets to Abraham he said how shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do seeing as he is heir of the earth and because of who you are tonight he's about to pour a blessing upon you isn't that right amen and amen okay let me hurry on down here now time's going praise God hallelujah do you love him tonight amen amen praise God praise God Amen and amen hallelujah oh Hallelujah thank you Jesus glory be to God Amen looking for praise God a scripture here amen amen all right here we go amen okay amen hallelujah so First Peter 1 is what we read right before we started and um I love what he said there in verse S and I want to read it back to you or rather I'll go back to skip verse six it says where ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be he said you are in heaviness through manifold Temptations amen isn't that right many Temptations diverse Temptations and sometimes God brings us through situations and sometimes my situation ain't is not the same as your situation and your situation is not the same as mine praise God isn't that right Hallelujah God deals with his sons and daughters in different ways some through the waters some through the flood some through great trials some through great Sorrows some through great situations some through hell and high water but all come through the blood if it's one thing they all come through in the end isn't that right if it's one thing about God his sons and daughters always come through Joseph made it Jonah made it Abraham made it sadrach made it Abednego made it isn't that right Daniel made it Moses made it Elijah made it they all come through God knows what he is doing don't be afraid of what God's work is in your life oh hallelujah hallelujah you just trust God because he'll bring you through isn't that right the only way they found brother Bram said for a chicken to hatch is for it to pip out of his shell he said if you try to pull the shell off of the chicken he said you'll kill it he said because there's something built into the chicken he's got a little snoot a little Bill he said and anytime he gets to pip in he starts pipping until he makes a little hole and when he makes a little hole he begins to fight and fight and continues to fight but abam said it's in that motion that the muscles get to working it is in that time of distress that his muscles get to flex it is in that time of distress it is in that time of burden and travail and you don't know what's going on and you don't know why it's so dark but you're pressing your way anyhow because you believe in something and something inside of you is moving your life is bursting out you can't stay where you are you need something you want something and you know there's more of God out there and you keep pressing your way pressing your way oh hallelujah hallelujah that's what God wants his sons and daughters to do that's why you come every service because you're looking for something you're not satisfied with what the world has for you you come to press your way tonight press your way into your joy press your way into your promises press your way into peace press your way into the Holy [Applause] Ghost Press Your Way those are the ones that get adopted amen those are the ones that get perfected those are the ones that get the promise of the father those are the ones that God uses the ones that are not afraid to step out of their comfort zone hallelujah hallelujah and declare Christ amen hallelujah in their lives verse 7 says that the trial of your fate being much more precious than that of gold that perisheth Hallelujah through it though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise honor and Glory a tried fate amen Peter is talking about a tried fate that is more precious than gold and silver that is more precious than anything that this world could offer you a tried fate a proven fate a Fai that knows the god in the silence just as much as it knows the God in noise he is the god in the silence too because anytime it's silent that's when the teacher is is is performing his test in your life he keeps very silent because he wants to see what answer you are going to write down on your answer sheet he wants to see what you're going to say he wants to see what attitude you are going to have Hallelujah towards your brother towards your sister towards your loved ones towards your enemies towards them that hate you he wants to see what your attitude [Applause] [Music] is oh it's so quiet tonight amen amen he wants to see what your attitude is how you're handling it what kind of son are you and the only way to bring out what's in you what's in you is to test you amen isn't that hallelujah hallelujah what I have here is an iPad there a little device here that they made somewhere China and I'm told that anytime you get one of these products in your hand or your phone or anything like that that product has to be tested yes there's no product that they don't release that isn't tested first to see if it's working and if it's in the right order and it could be used for what it needs to be used for isn't that right it has to be go through all the geometrics and whatever analytics or whatever isn't that right cars are tested houses are tested with the electricity systems to make sure that it's in working order so that you don't move into an electric voltage house amen don't you have any accidents going on in there but it has to be properly tested first so before God is able to release his product into the world he he wants to test it tonight to see if it measures up to the Quality that that he has for it and if you're ever going to be used by God tonight you have to be tested you have to be tried and it have to be proven to work oh hallelujah hallelujah but what I love about it is that these same seven tunders that we are going to live out has been tested throughout the years Faith

fire and even with natural goal it has to go through a purifying process if you look at goal in it Natural State you might miss it as goal you might think it's go you might think it's something else some kind of rock or some kind of rubble it takes a skill train eye to tell the difference between gold and some other metal it takes a skilled eye to tell what is precious and God had a skilled eye and he saw his sons and daughters down in 2016 he looked with his skill trained eye and he saw pure gold how you didn't know you were gold the world didn't put value on you but Jesus put value on every one of you tonight by shedding his own blood I put value on you tonight I I know I'm a somebody I know I'm a Son of God Jesus didn't die for nobody he died for me oh Hallelujah he died for my
