[48:10] greetings from India from pastor vickram
[48:13] and pastor avanes and the Believers
[48:15] across in India part that we went to and
[48:18] we had a tremendous time in the Lord
[48:20] amen praise the
[48:22] Lord I I did for service back to back
[48:26] and my voice never break and I never
[48:28] lose strength actually the last service
[48:30] was just as strong as was the first
[48:33] service so I thank God for that uh it
[48:37] was good being there uh I get to uh I
[48:41] think it's Doha that take 13 hours
[48:43] flight to go that way and coming back
[48:45] was 15 hours to get from there to back
[48:47] to Miami but uh the trip was blessed and
[48:51] the believer were blessed and I know
[48:53] there one or two would like to come here
[48:55] to Trinidad next next next uh convention
[48:58] July and we'll be happy if they could
[49:00] get come to get here amen also I want to
[49:04] appreciate I didn't get to make any
[49:05] comments after the service of brother
[49:07] yadel thel and what a tremendous
[49:09] blessing he was to us and I know is to
[49:12] the body of Christ and I'm looking
[49:14] forward for more fellowship and more
[49:16] brothers that would step forward to
[49:17] minister or minister to
[49:20] support uh so we're looking to see what
[49:22] the Lord will do this morning and um I'm
[49:24] under great expectation
[49:27] and India was kind of mindblowing
[49:28] because the atmosphere was there from
[49:30] the very start so I know that the Lord
[49:33] is working a mighty mighty mighty work
[49:36] and his spirit is moving all over the
[49:38] world God have his people everywhere
[49:40] like I told them across day God have his
[49:41] man right in India we were there to
[49:43] encourage to support and so on not to
[49:45] take over not to be charge not to be no
[49:47] Pope over anybody right so that position
[49:50] of popery I have no interest in it
[49:51] whatsoever that Crown position and
[49:53] that's in charge of men and whatnot
[49:55] sorry I not qualified for that that
[49:57] above my pay grade I'm here to serve and
[50:00] God put me in this little group to serve
[50:02] and that's what I want to do to serve
[50:05] effectively I'm here I believe to speak
[50:07] to the bride of Christ I don't know who
[50:10] that is really we preach to all as bride
[50:12] but all is not bride we know that you
[50:14] know every group there are three kind of
[50:15] Believers so you can't judge this church
[50:17] by some cuckoo inside of here you can't
[50:20] judge your CH by some n case inside of
[50:21] here or some crazy inside of here you
[50:24] understand you have to judge people by
[50:25] the word so when we come here each one
[50:27] of us have to subject ourselves to the
[50:29] word of God because we come here to get
[50:31] better we come here to grow we come here
[50:34] to mature we come here to get ripe the
[50:37] prophet said your faith isn't ripe
[50:38] enough that means Faith could grow Faith
[50:40] could ripe and not because you are where
[50:43] you are you to stay where you are oh
[50:45] come on now not where you are you stay
[50:47] where you are you could be in a
[50:48] condition but you have to stay there you
[50:50] could be in poverty but you don't have
[50:51] to stay there you could be in depression
[50:52] but you don't have to stay there not
[50:54] because where you are you're going to
[50:55] stay there you are come on now you could
[50:56] get out praise God you could step out
[50:59] you could do better amen you can aim
[51:02] higher glory to God because good is the
[51:04] enemy of perfect God don't want it just
[51:06] good he want it perfect he want to come
[51:07] to Perfection that mean you have to
[51:09] press higher the voice said come up here
[51:11] and I shall show you praise God you
[51:13] can't stay where you are to see nothing
[51:15] when you're down in the dumps praise God
[51:17] do something about it go go go don't
[51:19] keep D don't keep digging when you're D
[51:22] in the dumps you go deeper in your hole

[51:36] powerful bride of Jesus Christ nothing
[51:38] going to stop it let's go from good to

[52:11] Heaven witness your testimony oh give
[52:14] the Lord a praise offering hallelujah
[52:16] praise God
[52:17] amen amen maybe Cesar I was talking to
[52:21] my wife and I was talking to Isaac also
[52:23] about you know somehow sometimes God
[52:25] doesn't
[52:26] allow uh people to fulfill all their
[52:28] dreams you have dreams you have visions
[52:31] and so on and like David he has a heart
[52:33] to build a house for the Lord David had
[52:36] plans David put in his own personal
[52:37] money into the into the Affairs of God
[52:39] for the building but God said David not
[52:41] you your son your son will do further
[52:44] than that David you fought your fight
[52:46] your years coming out now you I mean you
[52:48] have a burden and everything else but
[52:50] die now for you to fulfill so tell the
[52:52] Bible said old men shall dream dreams
[52:54] young men shall see Visions now it's two
[52:56] different things there you know because
[52:57] the old men can't fulfill the dream that
[52:59] they're dreaming about but young men who
[53:01] could have a vision could come and
[53:02] fulfill what the old men dream oh give
[53:04] the let the Old Men Dreams oh praise God
[53:06] but God going to raise up some young men
[53:09] that going to fulfill the vision because
[53:10] the vision is an appointed time oh give
[53:13] the Lord some Praises glory to God
[53:16] hallelujah nothing wrong with dreaming
[53:18] nothing wrong with I'm a vision and
[53:20] sometimes it just doesn't work out you
[53:22] have something in your heart you like to
[53:23] see you like to do something work out
[53:25] some with not that's how God have it
[53:28] amen I remember when my mother died uh I
[53:32] don't think she knew uh some of the
[53:33] grandchildren was coming and that's it
[53:36] somebody have to go at some point in
[53:38] time and then whatever age and Stage a
[53:40] child at that's how it is but life goes
[53:42] on the vision goes on the vision itself
[53:46] is complete and perfect because a vision
[53:48] from God but one thing we know God can't
[53:51] lie he don't have the ability to lie
[53:54] he's the function of Truth fruit and in
[53:56] him no Darkness at all so when he speaks
[53:59] is light and his word could be a lamp
[54:01] onto our feet and a light to our path so
[54:04] when God bring his word he bringing
[54:06] truth and light and Life to us that we
[54:08] can walk in it oh glory to God and day
[54:11] by day Souls going across yand praise
[54:14] God Souls break into the next Dimension
[54:16] and they're going across knowing there's
[54:18] a lamb be on the river they are dead and
[54:20] done they go to another dimension and we
[54:22] who are alive and remain glory to God
[54:25] shall not hinder them who asleep oh God
[54:28] that we have Breen gone and they're
[54:29] sleeping right now but we going to wake
[54:31] them because the voice of the Archangel
[54:33] going be a bride day without us not made
[54:36] perfect a church has got to come to
[54:38] Perfection we are leaving
[54:41] here Glory we're going to read the
[54:44] scripture just now and I don't know I'm
[54:46] going get to it but the prophet said
[54:48] your life is in the hand of sinful men
[54:51] with a trigger on atomic bombs and so on
[54:53] sinful men you think anybody in Ukraine
[54:56] teachers doctors lawyers going to work
[54:58] normal normal all does somebody coming
[55:00] to invade one man he didn't led to
[55:04] invade look at Israel ham just to attack

[59:07] into the whole description of this woman
[59:09] with the alabaster box and Jus when she
[59:11] when Jesus understood he was anointed to
[59:14] die to death and she was a side of the
[59:16] Bride right but let's bring it to you
[59:18] and I know do you know you have to be
[59:20] anointed to
[59:23] die
[59:26] a willing us to let go of

[59:53] we fall in the ground and die you abide
[59:56] alone but if it dies it brings much more
[1:00:01] fruit at the end of this at the end of
[1:00:04] this song we have to see
[1:00:09] Jesus like I tell them in India I not

[1:00:13] kind of music and whatever it is you
[1:00:14] know I there to minister the word of

[1:00:42] whatnot and BMS had to fall like
[1:00:45] Ukrainian all of a sudden somebody come
[1:00:47] and and and and think all of a sudden
[1:00:50] men sinful men wicked men but the finger
[1:00:54] on on the on on the
[1:00:58] button don't say that wouldn't affect
[1:01:01] you the Bible said the island shall be
[1:01:03] flood
[1:01:04] away don't say that not affecting you
[1:01:07] you know even what happening oh my I'll
[1:01:09] read it I'll read by the same scripture
[1:01:10] read before leave how J Jerusalem shall
[1:01:13] become a burdensome Stone to All Nations
[1:01:16] so what happened there is he starting
[1:01:18] like a kind like the fire and walk away
[1:01:20] and then start to burn Hallelujah
[1:01:22] because we know all the countries have
[1:01:24] to come against Jerusalem and all the
[1:01:26] spirits in Hell had coming against the
[1:01:27] bride 200,000,000 devils and them only

[1:01:38] no Devils with books and tapes or give
[1:01:40] the Lord some Praises we can't withstand

[1:08:28] want to read from 5 to8 Revelation 10
[1:08:31] 8-1 revelation 22 7-12 and 16 and 17 1
[1:08:36] Corinthians CH
[1:08:38] 3:5 who then is
[1:08:40] Paul who is
[1:08:42] Apollos but ministers by whom he
[1:08:46] believed even as the Lord give to every
[1:08:49] man I have
[1:08:51] planted Paul speaks Apollo's watered but
[1:08:56] God give the increase so neither is he
[1:09:00] that planted anything neither he that
[1:09:02] water it but God that giveth the
[1:09:06] increase now he that plant it and he
[1:09:08] that water it are one and every man
[1:09:10] shall receive his own reward according
[1:09:13] to his own labor Revelation chapter 10
[1:09:18] read in verse eight and the voice which
[1:09:20] I heard from Heaven spake to me again
[1:09:23] said
[1:09:24] go and take the little book which is
[1:09:26] open in the hand of the Angel which
[1:09:28] standed upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:09:31] and John here represented the bride and
[1:09:33] I went unto the angel said unto him give
[1:09:36] me the little book he said unto me take
[1:09:38] it eat it up it shall make thy belly
[1:09:42] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[1:09:45] sweet as honey and I took the little
[1:09:47] book out of the Angel's hand eat it up
[1:09:50] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey as
[1:09:52] soon as I had eaten it
[1:09:54] my belly was bitter and he said unto me
[1:09:57] thou must prophesy again before many
[1:10:00] peoples and Nations and tongues and
[1:10:04] Kings our final reading is on Matthew
[1:10:07] chapter 2 Revelation chap
[1:10:10] 22:7 says behold I come
[1:10:13] quickly blessed is he that keepeth the
[1:10:17] SS of the prophecy of this book and I
[1:10:20] John saw these things and heard them and
[1:10:22] when I had heard and seen
[1:10:24] I fell down to worship before the feet
[1:10:26] of the Angel which showed me these
[1:10:28] things now look at the reaction of the
[1:10:30] Angel then sayith he to me see thou do
[1:10:33] it not don't worship me for I
[1:10:37] am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:10:40] Brethren the prophets and of them which
[1:10:44] keep the sayings of this book worship
[1:10:47] God and he said unto me seal not the SS
[1:10:53] of the prophet prophecy of this book for
[1:10:55] the time is at hand he that is unjust
[1:10:58] let them be unjust still he which is
[1:11:00] filthy let them be filthy still he that
[1:11:03] is righteous let him be righteous still
[1:11:05] and he that is Holy let him be holy
[1:11:08] still and behold I come quickly and my
[1:11:10] reward is with me to give every man
[1:11:13] according as his work shall be let's go
[1:11:14] on to verse 16 of the same chapter I
[1:11:18] Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto
[1:11:22] you these things in the church es I am
[1:11:24] the root and The Offspring of David and
[1:11:27] the bright and morning star and the
[1:11:30] spirit and the bright sck come let him
[1:11:32] that hear at sake come let him that is
[1:11:34] at thirst come and whosoever will let
[1:11:37] him take the Water of Life freely may
[1:11:39] God bless his word let's pray father we
[1:11:41] thank you for your word here your
[1:11:42] precious people the souls gathered here
[1:11:44] this morning and I pray that you speak
[1:11:46] to their hearts and may it have a
[1:11:48] transformational effect upon their lives
[1:11:50] in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be
[1:11:52] seated praise is God
[1:11:55] hallelujah so this morning I have a
[1:11:57] title here the spirit and the prophet
[1:12:02] and the bride that's the title this
[1:12:04] morning the spirit and the prophet and
[1:12:07] the bride I an inspiration seal not the
[1:12:11] sayings of the prophecy of this book for
[1:12:15] the times at hand I have a
[1:12:18] question will the bride have a
[1:12:22] voice
[1:12:24] and be a mouthpiece for God it's
[1:12:27] question going have see if we could get
[1:12:29] that question answered will the bride
[1:12:31] have a
[1:12:33] voice and and Paul said it clearly he
[1:12:36] said who is then is Paul I have planted
[1:12:39] AP Paul's watered but God give the
[1:12:41] increase amen now go in a prophet with
[1:12:46] seeds but the son of man is a Ser of The
[1:12:49] Good Seed Luke 17:30 says even thus had
[1:12:52] it been the day when the son son of man
[1:12:53] is revealed the only reason God send
[1:12:56] back son of man manifestation is to
[1:12:58] bring seeds because the son of man is a
[1:13:01] Ser but the seeds that this son of man
[1:13:03] coming with according to Luke 1730 is
[1:13:05] the seed of the entire Bible because we
[1:13:07] are the end of time so now every mystery
[1:13:10] had to be revealed to get the seed of
[1:13:12] the entire Bible into a people that's
[1:13:15] why I get the secret is the word is in
[1:13:16] the bride a seed is in the bride isn't
[1:13:19] that right all right now watch this you
[1:13:21] now when did you get saved when did you
[1:13:23] get Sanctified when did you get filled
[1:13:24] with the Holy Ghost When You Believe on
[1:13:26] the Lord Jesus for you receive there
[1:13:28] right everlasting life but from then you
[1:13:30] start growing you start growing you grow
[1:13:32] through sanctification through the Holy
[1:13:34] Ghost through speaking in tongues
[1:13:35] through all these things you receive
[1:13:37] life when you believe see what I mean
[1:13:39] now some people already got life and
[1:13:41] you're trying to get them to do
[1:13:42] something here when they haven't even
[1:13:44] reached that place yet and that's why we
[1:13:46] said the Bible talk about I write unto
[1:13:48] you young men I write unto you children
[1:13:51] I write unto you fathers that you know
[1:13:53] from the the beginning on every stage of
[1:13:54] growth from children to young men to
[1:13:57] fathers there's a portion of knowledge
[1:13:59] that is afforded to that you cannot give
[1:14:01] child uh Advanced knowledge when the
[1:14:03] child is just in primary school so
[1:14:05] according to the growth of the child God
[1:14:07] presents certain things to them now the
[1:14:09] object of God is to get us into
[1:14:11] fatherhood or get us into maturity or
[1:14:13] get us into adoption that we could
[1:14:15] manage our own stuff can we give the
[1:14:17] Lord some Praises in other words God
[1:14:19] want his son to be independent you know
[1:14:22] how the Bible say for this cause should
[1:14:24] a man leave his mother and father and
[1:14:25] cleave his wife the object of parenting
[1:14:27] is to bring the child to maturity that
[1:14:28] they could leave and cleave not stay and
[1:14:31] hold and be managed and helicopter
[1:14:33] parent Hing over the child that is not
[1:14:34] the objective you know the objective is
[1:14:36] to reproduce and produce a mature son a
[1:14:39] maure daughter that could go on in
[1:14:41] responsibility and in their future and
[1:14:43] in their lives oh give the Lord some
[1:14:44] praises and that's the same thing God
[1:14:46] wanted let us make man in our image I
[1:14:48] want to be just like me having my
[1:14:49] objective and motive and let them have
[1:14:51] dominion over the fish over every creep
[1:14:53] rep thing and God saw it was good oh
[1:14:55] give the Lord some Praises God wasn't
[1:14:58] envious of man in position or man having
[1:15:00] Authority or man having power that's
[1:15:02] what he wanted oh give the Lord a shout
[1:15:05] So Adam was a god of the earth he had to
[1:15:07] name everything and everything he called
[1:15:09] was the name thereof so God put Power
[1:15:11] into man his original intent was to get
[1:15:14] power into man to rule to conquer to
[1:15:19] overcome but Fallen man want to re over
[1:15:22] man
[1:15:25] fall man want to take control and people
[1:15:29] like to have influence over control over
[1:15:32] power over that's not God's original
[1:15:35] intent God original intent is that the
[1:15:37] Holy Ghost have over
[1:15:39] you it come like the Holy Ghost over the
[1:15:42] husband and then the wife is under the
[1:15:44] husband because the Holy Ghost is under
[1:15:46] the
[1:15:49] husband so as he yield to the headship
[1:15:51] the wife yields to him yes
[1:15:55] so the order of God is for you as a man
[1:15:57] to be the priest in your house not woman
[1:16:00] priest oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:16:02] Hallelujah Give the Lord some
[1:16:04] Praises Oh Glory to God and you be the
[1:16:07] priest in the
[1:16:09] house all right let's go I watch
[1:16:12] something
[1:16:13] now now the Pentecostal people has never
[1:16:17] come to the place where the church is
[1:16:20] getting now to
[1:16:21] adoption or to the placing of a son so
[1:16:25] 1906 birth Pentecostal speaking in
[1:16:27] tongues they only had that birth story
[1:16:30] but they never came to the maturity that
[1:16:33] God could positionally place them the
[1:16:36] only person that came to maturity was
[1:16:37] William Mar Braham that God adopted into
[1:16:40] the family of God and give him authority
[1:16:42] to speak to squirrels speak to squirrels
[1:16:44] speak to the storm same power that Adam
[1:16:47] had that Jesus had he demonstrated and
[1:16:49] said the Bible have that same thing too
[1:16:52] so what he actually prophesying from the
[1:16:54] book was that other Sons will come to
[1:16:56] maturity or come to adulthood or come to
[1:17:00] fatherhood to know him from the
[1:17:01] beginning oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:17:04] you will not always be a young man Oh
[1:17:06] Glory you will not always be a child
[1:17:08] you're going to grow you're going to
[1:17:10] mature you're going to ripen you're
[1:17:12] going to get into the place where God
[1:17:14] could positionally place you as to what
[1:17:16] you
[1:17:17] are Oh Glory to God and when you come
[1:17:19] into a position you cannot oh my you
[1:17:23] will have faith in your position not the
[1:17:25] anointing there know in who you are not
[1:17:29] the anointing upon you you know but in
[1:17:31] who you are come like when Saul when
[1:17:34] when Samuel anointed David David
[1:17:35] couldn't go back and say come for the
[1:17:36] throne now he went back and see what
[1:17:38] sheep because he was anointed but not
[1:17:40] ready anointed but not ready he had to
[1:17:43] grow and get mature to to get the Throne
[1:17:47] of Israel because God was finished with
[1:17:50] Saul God send the pink slip to Saul and
[1:17:52] fire him and he don't even know he's
[1:17:53] fired but he's on the throne but he
[1:17:56] already anoint David and God of a bride
[1:17:58] already anointed but that bride will
[1:18:00] come into position position of power oh
[1:18:04] give the Lord some Praises glory glory
[1:18:08] to God are you with me now hallelujah
[1:18:12] hallelujah so the Pentecostal Church
[1:18:14] never came to this position of being
[1:18:16] placed Hallelujah so this prophet of
[1:18:19] Malachi 4 behold I S Elijah the Prophet
[1:18:21] this prophet of Luke 17:30
[1:18:23] this son of man being revealed is also
[1:18:25] the same prophet of R 10:7 the days of
[1:18:28] the voice of the seventh angel and the
[1:18:30] voice of the seventh angel he had to
[1:18:31] catch the mystery from the mighty angel
[1:18:34] in Revelation 10:1 I saw another Mighty
[1:18:37] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[1:18:38] a cloud and a rainbow about his head and
[1:18:41] his feetures brass and Pillar of Fire
[1:18:43] and he had hand a little book open that
[1:18:45] book was once closed in heaven now the
[1:18:47] book is open and when he opened the book
[1:18:49] Seven tunders T the voices out and I was
[1:18:52] about to write you say seal up the
[1:18:54] things that the seventh Thunders uttered

[1:22:21] Jesus cared
[1:22:23] oh give the Lord some Praises my God how
[1:22:26] do I get out of here hallelujah praise
[1:22:28] God okay let's go watch in the Old
[1:22:30] Testament when a son is born into a home
[1:22:33] it was a son because it was born in a
[1:22:36] home my son is my son when he's born to
[1:22:39] me when the Pentecostal Church gave
[1:22:41] birth or found that they called the
[1:22:43] birth the new birth of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:45] they were born into the kingdom of God
[1:22:47] now Ephesians said we are predestinated
[1:22:49] unto the adoption of sons now a man in
[1:22:51] the Old Testament when he he had a born
[1:22:53] a son in the house he had a son and when
[1:22:55] he was born there was a tutor raised
[1:22:56] that child until he come of certain age
[1:22:59] and if this tutor brought word to the
[1:23:01] Father the child was worthy and all
[1:23:03] right now he was adopted into that
[1:23:06] family many of you Old Testament readers
[1:23:08] know that he was adopted into the family
[1:23:11] but if he wasn't he still remain a son
[1:23:13] but he wasn't adopted then if he was
[1:23:15] adopted he was brought out in the street
[1:23:17] put a robe on him a ceremony was made
[1:23:21] and then this boy sing year on the check
[1:23:23] meant the same as his
[1:23:26] daddy's so now the son could sign the
[1:23:28] check he's now adopted he's always a son
[1:23:33] let's come on to the message now
[1:23:34] everybody is sons and
[1:23:37] daughters but there's some going to be
[1:23:39] adopted and when they adopted they could
[1:23:42] sign the
[1:23:43] check for healing for deliverance
[1:23:47] whatever you have need of look at Peter
[1:23:50] Silver and Gold Have I None such a as I
[1:23:53] have I give it unto you he was an
[1:23:55] adopted son he said rise up and walk in
[1:23:57] the name of Jesus Christ and we going to
[1:24:00] have the same thing here in Trinidad and
[1:24:02] Around The World God will adopt his sons
[1:24:06] because God can't lie that's the purpose
[1:24:08] the message come to bring us to
[1:24:09] spiritual maturity and adoption oh give
[1:24:12] the Lord some praise that's the
[1:24:13] objective not baby baby baby not God at
[1:24:15] a hand your hand you that you sit down
[1:24:17] and being feeling entitled oh give the
[1:24:20] Lord some Praises but the kingdom of God
[1:24:22] is preached and every man every man
[1:24:25] pressed their way into it give the Lord
[1:24:27] some

[1:24:38] start to press your way into this great
[1:24:40] battle we talking about here now glory
[1:24:42] to God so what's something now here this
[1:24:46] God adopted his own son when he took him
[1:24:49] Peter James and John as a witness okay
[1:24:52] in the more of two or three Witnesses he
[1:24:53] said this is my beloved Son he him in
[1:24:55] other words there it is what he says is
[1:24:58] all of it then he is given equal of
[1:25:00] course it was God but God In the Flesh
[1:25:03] of Jesus Christ manifested himself to
[1:25:04] the people then God adopted his son now
[1:25:07] when the Pentecostal church and those
[1:25:09] people in the last days here that's
[1:25:11] beginning to find a new but being born
[1:25:13] again they thought that settled it no
[1:25:17] sir your ups and downs and ins and outs
[1:25:21] and things like that God can place you

[1:27:57] under the impact of the UNC creeping
[1:27:59] judgments one of the ministers will
[1:28:00] probably pick it up in a few minutes on

[1:29:10] start this from this morning age Brother
[1:29:14] The Seven Ages are set forth in
[1:29:15] Revelation Chapter 2 and three takes in
[1:29:17] the whole span of the fullness of the
[1:29:19] Gentiles for the whole time in which God
[1:29:21] is with the Gentiles under the Salvation
[1:29:24] in every single age by none it says the
[1:29:26] very same thing in the opening and
[1:29:28] closing the message to each age unto the
[1:29:30] message of Unto the messenger of Ephesus
[1:29:33] smna pogos Tira sadis Philadelphia laa
[1:29:36] right he an ear let him hear what the
[1:29:40] spirit said unto the churches notice
[1:29:42] here is what Jesus by the spirit in
[1:29:44] every age addresses himself to only one
[1:29:46] person relative to the word of that age
[1:29:49] only one messenger for each age receives
[1:29:54] what the spirit has to say for that age
[1:29:57] let that soak it one man receives what
[1:30:01] the
[1:30:03] spirit says to the age not men one man
[1:30:08] and that one man in this age was William
[1:30:10] maram
[1:30:11] BR behold I send you Elijah so the
[1:30:14] spirit spoke to

[1:30:26] for each age receives what the spirit
[1:30:29] has to say to that age and that one
[1:30:31] messenger is the messenger to the true
[1:30:33] church he speaks for God by Revelation
[1:30:37] to the
[1:30:38] churches both true and
[1:30:43] false so he's not just speaking to the
[1:30:45] TR but up punch he's speaking to true
[1:30:47] and false so in this message of Malachi
[1:30:50] 4 they are true and false
[1:30:53] amen that's right don't say Amen now
[1:30:56] doesn't change it it's still a true and
[1:30:57] false you better find out if you are
[1:30:59] true but it have true and false
[1:31:02] Hallelujah and the message come to both
[1:31:04] so you can't correct false what false is

[1:31:09] not here to try to identify false money
[1:31:10] and false dollars if you do that we have
[1:31:13] no service we because have many false
[1:31:15] prophets many on false teachings and
[1:31:17] doctrines so we stay with your true

[1:31:22] bank people they checking your money
[1:31:23] like that so and they're checking normal
[1:31:24] normal and once a funny money come they
[1:31:27] hand stop the feel is different
[1:31:30] Hallelujah so we want to treat train you

[1:31:42] funny money oh give the Lord some
[1:31:44] Praises he speaks for God by Revelation
[1:31:48] to the churches both true and false the
[1:31:50] message is then broadcast to all hear
[1:31:53] the part I love you but though it is
[1:31:55] broadcast for all who come within the
[1:31:58] range of the message that message is
[1:32:01] received individually by only a certain
[1:32:05] qualified group in a certain way each
[1:32:08] individual of that group is the one has
[1:32:11] the ability to hear what the spirit is
[1:32:15] saying by way of the
[1:32:18] messenger those who hear are not getting
[1:32:21] their own private Revelation nor is the
[1:32:24] group getting their Collective
[1:32:25] Revelation but each person is hearing
[1:32:28] and receiving what the messenger has
[1:32:30] already received from God oh give the
[1:32:33] Lord some Praises so number one the
[1:32:37] elect has the ability to hear from God
[1:32:39] give the Lord a shout on that one the
[1:32:42] elect has the ability to hear from God
[1:32:45] when God speaks there's something in you
[1:32:48] could respond oh give the Lord a shout
[1:32:50] in the house
[1:32:52] hallelujah praise God glory to God
[1:32:55] Amen let's continue I've been saying
[1:32:59] right along that they are actually two
[1:33:01] churches though the spirit speaks to
[1:33:04] both of them in each age as though they
[1:33:07] were a one here it is plainly stated
[1:33:10] that there are churches and it states
[1:33:12] just as plainly that some of those
[1:33:14] churches most evidently do not know that
[1:33:17] he is the one who searched the Reigns
[1:33:18] and the hearts he is going to prove to
[1:33:21] them that is so now what churches will
[1:33:24] be those that do not know this truth of
[1:33:26] course it is the false Vine group
[1:33:28] because the True Believers certainly
[1:33:30] know that judgment begins at the house
[1:33:33] of God and they being God-fearing judge
[1:33:37] themselves that they be not judged Oh
[1:33:40] Glory to God to the True Believer they
[1:33:42] walk in here carefree and walk in here
[1:33:44] careless they walking with the
[1:33:46] Consciousness that judgment begins at
[1:33:48] the house of God let's go let's go let's
[1:33:51] go let's fight with me now so when anas
[1:33:53] fire came into the church God loved that
[1:33:55] bright so much he he didn't want that
[1:33:58] bright to be defiled so he judged and n
[1:34:01] and saf and they died in the church to
[1:34:04] protect the church that was God
[1:34:05] protection for the elect in that day
[1:34:07] give the Lord some praises and the
[1:34:09] prophet said it will repeat again oh
[1:34:11] glory to God you could say Peter Deni
[1:34:14] Christ and Peter the Crow and all
[1:34:16] that but God was veiled in Peter's heart
[1:34:19] you can't you don't know when that
[1:34:20] happened but it happened
[1:34:22] Oh Glory to God they thought was brother
[1:34:23] Peter but God was sitting there and when
[1:34:26] they lie he said didn't lie to a man you
[1:34:28] lie to the Holy Ghost oh give the Lord
[1:34:30] some Praises that same Holy Ghost will
[1:34:32] come back back in the church Oh Glory
[1:34:34] there will be a church with Jesus
[1:34:36] walking in it oh give the Lord some
[1:34:38] Praises Hallelujah do we believe
[1:34:40] [Applause]
[1:34:44] that my God why does God call these
[1:34:48] churches his churches even though they
[1:34:51] are false Vine the truth of the matter
[1:34:54] is that they are all Christians but they
[1:34:57] are not Christians of the
[1:35:01] spirit all brother over it have
[1:35:05] Christian and Christian yeah have
[1:35:07] Christians of the Flesh and
[1:35:09] Christians of the
[1:35:12] spirit they are Christians of the flesh
[1:35:16] they are bearing the name in vain Mark
[1:35:19] 7:7 how be it in vain do they worship me
[1:35:22] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[1:35:24] of men but indeed they are Christians
[1:35:26] for what else could they be a muhammadan
[1:35:28] is a mohammadan that is the religion no
[1:35:30] matter how he lives because he
[1:35:32] subscribes to the theory that the Quran
[1:35:34] teaches in the same way a Christian is a
[1:35:37] Christian as long as he subscribed to
[1:35:38] the fact that Jesus is the son of God
[1:35:40] born of a virgin crucified died rose
[1:35:42] again and he's a savior of mankind in
[1:35:44] fact in the loud Ean age there will be
[1:35:47] those who call themselves Christians
[1:35:48] because they subscribe to the Fine
[1:35:50] qualities of Christ Christ while
[1:35:52] reserving themselves the right to deny
[1:35:54] his deity Christian Science have done
[1:35:56] that he is a nominal Christians belongs
[1:35:59] to the church but he's not a true or
[1:36:00] spiritual believer that kind of a
[1:36:03] Believer is one who has been baptized
[1:36:05] into the body of Christ and is a member
[1:36:08] of him so the spirit is speaking to this
[1:36:13] mixed group on one hand he is praising
[1:36:16] and on the other hand he's rebuking he
[1:36:18] has told what is right with the True
[1:36:20] Believer now he warns what the false
[1:36:22] Vine must do if it is to stand Justified
[1:36:25] let's go now we find why there are two
[1:36:29] Vines one through once for we can see
[1:36:31] why Abraham had two sons one after the

[1:53:55] nights Hallelujah Dr people floating and
[1:53:59] as the rainfall no I begin to raise the
[1:54:02] only thing I'm going to save the church
[1:54:04] is the Judgment so the same Holy Ghost
[1:54:06] we're looking for is one going to judge
[1:54:07] the world because Daniel saw I saw a
[1:54:09] stone cut out without the hands of man
[1:54:12] and that stone ends the Gentile
[1:54:14] dispensation oh give the Lord some
[1:54:17] Praises Hallelujah listen continue oh
[1:54:20] brother give me a church full of the
[1:54:22] Holy Ghost God will do in one year what
[1:54:25] all theology failed to do in 2,000 years
[1:54:28] you wait till the anointing of the
[1:54:30] church really strikes home after the
[1:54:33] doors of the Gentile is closed God will
[1:54:36] anoint a church then he who is filthy be
[1:54:39] filthy still he is righteous to be
[1:54:41] righteous still who is Holy be holy
[1:54:43] still and God will anoint the church
[1:54:46] with the power of God and things will be
[1:54:48] taken place oh give the Lord some
[1:54:50] Praises I understand that woman will bow
[1:54:53] with their hair in the last days I
[1:54:55] understand they'll wear short clothes
[1:54:56] walk with high heel shoes tinkling as
[1:54:58] they go I understand that moral will be
[1:55:00] so low in the last days I understand
[1:55:02] that the preachers will be false
[1:55:03] shepherds in the last days that will
[1:55:05] compromise and will not feed the people
[1:55:06] the word of God we'll go after Crees and
[1:55:08] things instead but I understand there
[1:55:10] will be a voice coming in the last days
[1:55:13] crying out of the Wilderness calling the
[1:55:15] people back to the original message back
[1:55:17] to the things of God I understand by the
[1:55:19] look those things will take place I
[1:55:22] understand in the last days there'll
[1:55:24] come a famine the churches will be so
[1:55:26] organized and so set that the last day
[1:55:28] will be a famine not for bread and water
[1:55:31] only but for the hearing of the true
[1:55:34] word of God not for Bibles they have
[1:55:36] tons of that not for tapes they have
[1:55:37] tons of that but for the hearing oh of
[1:55:40] the true of God and the people will go
[1:55:42] from the East and from the west from the
[1:55:44] north and from the south seeking to hear
[1:55:46] the true of God but the churches will be
[1:55:48] so organized and tighten up they will
[1:55:50] fail to hear it oh give the Lord a shout
[1:55:53] in the house I understand he will send
[1:55:56] Elijah before that end time he will have
[1:55:58] a message that will turn the heart of
[1:56:01] the children back to the fathers and
[1:56:03] turn them back to the original go back
[1:56:05] again I understand here we go that will
[1:56:08] take place just before the spirit leave
[1:56:11] the Gentile church and return to the
[1:56:14] Jews so before God could deal with the
[1:56:17] Jews you have to take the spirit out of
[1:56:19] the Gentile church and he said we will
[1:56:21] be here preaching to the Eternal l oh
[1:56:25] glory to God the spirit going to be in
[1:56:26] the bride no Spirit left for salvation
[1:56:30] no Spirit left for people to come to the
[1:56:31] altar to be saved the time is
[1:56:34] now the time to repent is now the time
[1:56:37] to make it right is now the spirit will
[1:56:40] leave the Gentiles and go to the Jews Oh
[1:56:44] Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:56:47] hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise
[1:56:50] God praise God he said now we live
[1:56:53] through the westan age of Pentecostal
[1:56:54] age with the Bap Holy Ghost we are
[1:56:55] shaping up all the time this rejected
[1:56:58] Stone cut out of the mountain without
[1:57:01] what without hands God sent it do you
[1:57:03] see the rejected stone is the head the
[1:57:06] Capstone and the Very one that was
[1:57:08] rejected to the Gentile is Christ and
[1:57:11] Christ was not cut and put by a Vicor or
[1:57:13] Son of God by some dignitary he is the
[1:57:15] Holy Spirit and the cap of the per where
[1:57:18] Christ coming
[1:57:20] so the holy spirit is right there on top
[1:57:21] of Brotherly kindness so brotherly
[1:57:23] kindness is the attraction for the Holy
[1:57:25] Spirit to come oh my Hallelujah they
[1:57:29] never they put the cap Stone on the
[1:57:30] pyramid it wasn't cut by man's hand it's
[1:57:32] God hand that cut that stone oh my watch
[1:57:36] so watch you see it it hit the image
[1:57:37] right smack in the feet and broke it to
[1:57:40] Pieces grung it into powder what
[1:57:42] happened at that time the coming of that
[1:57:44] stone up when the church into Glory at
[1:57:46] the Rapture because it ended the Gentile
[1:57:48] dispensation amen here it is God ended
[1:57:51] it with the coming of that stone so we
[1:57:53] talking looking for the Capstone super
[1:57:55] Church super race but the Capstone
[1:57:56] itself coming to end the
[1:57:58] Gentile dispensation oh here it is he is
[1:58:01] Christ is that stone he was born of a
[1:58:03] man he wasn't born of a man he was born
[1:58:05] of God he's coming for a church that is
[1:58:08] reborn Again by the spirit of God
[1:58:11] because the strength of that headstone
[1:58:12] runs all through the church like a
[1:58:13] magnet we have got to be magnetized to
[1:58:16] The Headstone that headstone is the Holy
[1:58:18] Ghost Christ that every one of us that
[1:58:20] got the magnetism of the Holy Spirit
[1:58:22] when that stone strike the image the
[1:58:23] church will flee to it back into Glory
[1:58:26] that's why I said the Rapture is not
[1:58:27] outside in it's inside out and if you
[1:58:29] have the magnetism inside of you and the
[1:58:31] Capstone come it will pick you up you
[1:58:33] have to go because it's connected to
[1:58:35] what's inside of you oh give the Lord

[2:06:05] our own seed one man here from the
[2:06:08] spirit oh give the Lord some praises and
[2:06:11] that comes to the prophet so the prophet

[2:06:19] hope that there men come behind to make
[2:06:21] more sense to it he didn't stop there

[2:09:17] his works that's what he said a
[2:09:20] momentary consideration of church
[2:09:21] history will prove how accurate this
[2:09:22] thought is in the Dark Ages the word was
[2:09:25] almost entirely lost to the people but
[2:09:27] God sent Luther with the word Lutheran
[2:09:29] spoke for God at that time and they
[2:09:31] organized and again the pure word was
[2:09:33] lost for organization tends towards
[2:09:35] dogma and Creeds and not simple word
[2:09:37] they could no longer speak for God then
[2:09:40] God sent Wesley he was the voice of the
[2:09:42] word in this day the people who took his
[2:09:46] Revelation from God became the living
[2:09:49] Epistles great and known of all men for
[2:09:51] their generation when the Methodist fail

[2:11:11] bride he will confound her that word
[2:11:13] confound means cause a surprise or
[2:11:17] confusion especially by not according to
[2:11:19] their expectation they'll be so confused
[2:11:23] Oh Glory to God that's that's the
[2:11:24] confound confounded by the prophet and
[2:11:27] the bride confounded or confused or
[2:11:30] baffled or perplexed with uncertainty Oh
[2:11:33] Glory to God question will the bride
[2:11:35] have a voice yes it is for in the last
[2:11:39] chapter of Revelation the 17 it said the
[2:11:41] spirit but I'm reading now he said the
[2:11:43] spirit and the bright said come he said
[2:11:45] once more the world will hear
[2:11:49] direct from God hold it hold it the
[2:11:51] world heard direct from God through
[2:11:53] Malachi 4 but once more the world will
[2:11:57] hear direct from God not through books
[2:12:00] and tapes not that way but from the
[2:12:02] bride because the voice of God will be
[2:12:05] oh give the Lord a praise oh give the
[2:12:08] Lord some Praises glory to God once more
[2:12:13] the world will hear direct from God as
[2:12:16] at Pentecost but of course that word
[2:12:18] Bible be repudiated as in the first age
[2:12:20] you may be seated now we had cried out
[2:12:23] to this age you have the word you have
[2:12:25] more Bibles than ever but you are not
[2:12:26] doing anything about the word except
[2:12:28] dividing and hacking into pieces taking
[2:12:30] what you want leaving out what you don't
[2:12:32] want you are not interested in living it
[2:12:34] but debate in it I would rather have you
[2:12:36] with hot or cold if you were cold and
[2:12:38] rejected it I could stand that if you
[2:12:40] would get white hot to know it's truth
[2:12:42] and live it I could praise you for that
[2:12:44] but when you simply take my word and
[2:12:45] don't honor it and return must refuse to
[2:12:47] honor you I will spew you out because
[2:12:50] you know me you no at me oh what to God
[2:12:53] the church will hot a cold best of all
[2:12:56] she should be fervent H but she is not
[2:12:59] sentence has to be passed let's continue
[2:13:02] she's no longer God's voice to the world
[2:13:04] she will maintain that she is but God
[2:13:06] says not God still has a voice for the
[2:13:10] people of the
[2:13:11] world he's not talking about himself
[2:13:14] let's let me read it now God still has a
[2:13:18] voice of the people of the world even as
[2:13:20] he has given a voice to the bride am
[2:13:23] that voice is in the Bride As we have
[2:13:26] said and we will talk more about that
[2:13:28] later oh praise God
[2:13:32] hallelujah listen to this one now I'm
[2:13:34] feeling good now almost finished but
[2:13:37] Bram there's a voice last days there are
[2:13:39] so many voices on the Earth today that
[2:13:41] is absolutely a Harding because it
[2:13:43] deadens the voice of the supernatural
[2:13:45] there are so many intellectual voices
[2:13:47] great voices of mighty men who are
[2:13:49] intellectual and in their intellectual
[2:13:51] condition they even shake the Nations
[2:13:52] they are not overnight people but they
[2:13:54] Shake Nations being in great
[2:13:56] organization together and a person would
[2:13:58] be confused and say how could these
[2:14:01] things raise up and and it causes the
[2:14:03] voice of God to be placed way back
[2:14:05] somewhere now hear this so brother
[2:14:07] Branham is about to State what we will
[2:14:10] state now yes he stating it for us and
[2:14:13] the voice of God they see how will we
[2:14:16] know it's the voice of
[2:14:18] God because then it wasn't the
[2:14:21] Vindicated Prophet so he's talking like
[2:14:22] if he's here right now that we' be
[2:14:24] looking back and say how we will know is
[2:14:26] the voice of God because in William
[2:14:28] brandham it was an evated prophet he
[2:14:30] said well now today how we know is the
[2:14:32] voice of God because it's the
[2:14:35] manifestation of the prophet's
[2:14:41] word he was Vindicated Malachi 4 he was
[2:14:45] a Vindicated 20th cury Prophet how would
[2:14:47] we know it's a Vindicated word today it
[2:14:50] will be a manifestation of what the
[2:14:52] prophet prophesy how could we know what
[2:14:54] the prophet prophesy if the book is not
[2:14:56] unsealed seal not the says of the
[2:14:58] prophecy of this book how we could
[2:15:00] prophesy if we haven't gone to the angel
[2:15:02] to take the book oh give the Lord some
[2:15:05] praises and that scripture started
[2:15:07] Revelation 108 not 7 8 seven is the days
[2:15:11] of the voice but it says hallelujah I
[2:15:14] Heard a Voice said go to the angel
[2:15:17] Hallelujah in other words go to B boss
[2:15:19] oh give the Lord a shout go to the one
[2:15:22] that called The
[2:15:24] Prophet go to the mighty Angel and ask
[2:15:27] for the book
[2:15:28] direct who's doing that the bride give
[2:15:31] me the book and then take it eat it in

[2:16:01] sweet in the mouth because Revelation is
[2:16:03] sweet oh give the Lord some
[2:16:04] shes how do we know it's the voice of
[2:16:08] God because it's the manifestation of
[2:16:10] the prophet's word this is God's prophet
[2:16:12] and the true voice of God only brings
[2:16:15] back that real living Supernatural God

[2:38:55] he who wrote In His will and testament
[2:38:57] that upon his death you could effect and
[2:39:01] access what he promised for you and he
[2:39:03] died to make sure that his will could be
[2:39:06] affected and then came back as the
[2:39:08] enforcer to make sure that no that
[2:39:11] nothing stands in your way of accessing
[2:39:13] your inheritance that he left for you so
