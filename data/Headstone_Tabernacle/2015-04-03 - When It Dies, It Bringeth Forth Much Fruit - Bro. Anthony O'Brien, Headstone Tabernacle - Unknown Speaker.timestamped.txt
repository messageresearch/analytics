[31:24] isn't that right you come to a sinful
[31:26] condition oh but take a revelation to
[31:29] break upon your soul to reveal to you

[31:34] didn't know who you really was
[31:36] even the devil didn't know who you
[31:37] really was
[31:38] told Jesus if thou be the Son of God in
[31:42] other words I don't know who you are
[31:43] there's silence over your life there's
[31:46] mystery over your life there's promise
[31:49] over your life I don't know who you are
[31:51] but let me test you a little bit let me
[31:53] tempt you a little bit let me see what
[31:54] you're going to do when I hit you the
[31:57] word test but Jesus pass every test he
[32:00] said it is written he said it is written
[32:03] and he said it is all Soul written Thou
[32:05] shalt not tempt the Lord thy God
[32:09] oh hallelujah hallelujah he didn't need
[32:13] power to do it he didn't need great
[32:15] signs and wonders to do it or while he
[32:17] hadn't broken into that Ministry yet but
[32:20] he showed by a simple example how the
[32:22] word of God could defeat the Devil
[32:25] anywhere anytime under any condition and
[32:30] tonight we have the most powerful thing
[32:32] on the planet what is it the word of God

[40:19] how he's speaking to you when he was yet

[42:39] praise him in him
[42:42] we had to give God glory
[42:45] praise God we shouldn't cease to give
[42:47] God priests we shouldn't cease to give
[42:49] God glory
[42:50] because he's done so much for us tonight
[42:53] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we're
[42:56] not worthy of but he did it anyway
[42:58] because he loved you
[43:00] isn't that right
[43:01] you couldn't love yourself when you saw
[43:03] your own condition you can love yourself
[43:05] when you saw your own situation and how
[43:08] lost we was and how messed up we were
[43:10] and how forgotten we was but he came and
[43:12] he found you
[43:14] in your condition and loved you just
[43:16] that way Hallelujah isn't that right
[43:19] just as you are he loved you messed up
[43:22] broken up shaken up Peter not but he
[43:25] loved you just the same and his desire
[43:27] for you is not for you to remain in that
[43:29] condition no no no no no no he's coming
[43:31] with a transforming power to transform
[43:34] you from that state into a perfect state
[43:37] from whatever condition you are to
[43:39] transform you into something glorious
[43:41] into something beautiful into something
[43:44] that the world could look upon and that
[43:46] he himself could say this is my beloved
[43:49] Son this is my beloved daughter in whom
[43:53] I am well pleased to dwell in here here
[43:56] him here here what she has to say hear
[43:59] what she has to speak whatever they say
[44:02] will already be said in a word oh same
[44:05] and somebody
[44:06] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[44:09] he many many men
[44:12] so my title tonight
[44:15] is taken from our Texas in John 12.
[44:17] which says when it dies it bringeth for
[44:20] much fruit
[44:22] when it dies
[44:24] it bringeth forth much fruit
[44:28] my inspiration
[44:30] is taken from that sentence written of
[44:33] verse 8th of Luke 24 which says and they
[44:36] remembered his words
[44:39] amen isn't that right
[44:41] they remembered something something
[44:43] about what was spoken
[44:45] something about what was said concerning
[44:47] them
[44:48] see the word had been sown in their
[44:50] hearts for a year upon year they walked
[44:52] with him for three and a half years and
[44:54] many times the Bible said that he spoke
[44:57] unto them concerning the things that he
[44:59] had to suffer isn't that right he said
[45:02] the son of man will be offered up would
[45:03] be crucified to the hands of sinful men
[45:05] and on the third day rise again they
[45:07] heard this already before
[45:09] but they didn't know what he was talking
[45:11] about
[45:12] the Bible said they understood not his
[45:14] words he said it on more than one
[45:16] occasion yet somehow it just didn't take
[45:19] effect
[45:20] but yet it was soon he had to speak it
[45:23] he had to say it because a thought would
[45:25] only remain a thought unless you speak
[45:28] it isn't that right it remain just a
[45:31] thought in your mind but unless you
[45:33] speak something it wouldn't materialize
[45:34] unless you sow it Hallelujah it won't
[45:37] reap back of fruit and increase in its
[45:39] due season isn't that right so he was
[45:42] dropping off words to them dropping off
[45:44] things to them dropping off uh
[45:46] Hallelujah isn't that right the word of
[45:48] God to them the son of man shall do this
[45:50] and the son of man shall do that and
[45:51] Destroy This Temple but in three days
[45:54] I'll raise it back up again
[45:56] isn't that right Hallelujah he was
[45:59] speaking words to them and they thought
[46:01] it was only words but every word of God
[46:04] is a seed
[46:05] isn't that right it takes the form of a
[46:08] seed and a powerful thing about a seed
[46:11] is that a seed is not the end product a
[46:14] seed is not the fruit yet but it shall
[46:17] be so in the near future it's not right
[46:20] it's going to become a fruit in due
[46:23] process but it has to go through a
[46:25] process it has to go through a death it
[46:29] has to go through a certain kind of a
[46:30] thing step by step it has to go from one
[46:34] form to another until another until it
[46:37] comes to its final stage of progress
[46:48] from before the foundation of the world
[46:50] but what happened in the Garden of Eden
[46:53] calls the spiritual Amnesia to fall upon
[46:56] man isn't that right the prophet
[46:59] preached a message about spiritual
[47:01] Amnesia oh hallelujah hallelujah because
[47:04] you see we forgot who we were Jesus was
[47:06] born in Perfection he was born by the
[47:09] very spoken word of God at age 12 he
[47:12] knew that he was about his father's
[47:14] business there are not many 12 year olds
[47:17] I could say that today but he knew who
[47:20] he was at age 12 because he was not just
[47:23] anybody but he was a very word made
[47:27] flesh oh I say Amen somebody
[47:30] amen
[47:37] Hallelujah he was a very pillow of Fire
[47:41] turn into flesh oh Hallelujah isn't that
[47:44] right he said I was there with Moses
[47:46] when Moses opened the Red Sea I was
[47:50] there with Jacob when he wrestled all
[47:52] night long I am the wheel in the middle
[47:54] of the wheel I am the rock beneath the
[47:57] rock I am the one the voice that cried
[48:00] out in the wilderness prepare you the
[48:02] way of the Lord he told the disciples on
[48:06] the roads he missed he blasted them he
[48:09] said oh fools and flow of hats don't you
[48:11] know that the very prophets were
[48:13] prophesying of my coming didn't you know
[48:16] that those very prophets were living out
[48:19] something they didn't know what they
[48:21] were living out but it was Jesus all the
[48:24] time it was Jesus on two feet it was
[48:27] Jesus Hallelujah
[48:31] Hallelujah
[48:36] if you can't pick up the Bible
[48:38] and read the Bible
[48:40] and not see Jesus in every scripture
[48:43] and there's something wrong with your
[48:45] Christian experience
[48:47] then there's something wrong with you
[48:48] you need to read it again because every
[48:50] verse every line every scripture oh
[48:54] Hallelujah even of the Old Testament
[48:56] prophesied of his coming
[48:58] oh isn't that right hallelujah
[49:01] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[49:03] hallelujah
[49:04] so they remembered something they
[49:06] remembered his words
[49:08] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[49:11] the word come to break the spiritual
[49:13] Amnesia off of you
[49:15] we walk like like like like like like
[49:17] parentless children sometimes we walk
[49:20] like we have no owner isn't that right
[49:22] oh Hallelujah holidays I think there's a
[49:25] poem that says we walk with with hop
[49:27] nail shoes Where Angels Fear to thread
[49:30] we walk in this world but we are not of
[49:32] this world there's so much evil and
[49:34] contamination in this Earthly atmosphere
[49:37] you're not even aware of it you are
[49:40] blind to it you walk in and looking with
[49:42] your natural eyes and you're not seeing
[49:44] how much dangers how much toils and how
[49:46] much snares that you have come through
[49:49] tonight it was God that kept you you
[49:52] thought you kept yourself you better
[49:54] wake up and recognize you are not in
[49:56] control as much as you think you are it
[50:00] is God that is in control
[50:02] kept next to yourself man get next to
[50:06] yourself young woman you can't keep
[50:08] yourself you cannot save yourself I
[50:11] can't save you nor can I give you the
[50:14] Holy Ghost it takes God to save you it
[50:17] takes the power of God to release the
[50:20] people in this hour
[50:22] foreign
[50:30] if you know what I'm talking about
[50:35] hallelujah oh I feel God in this place
[50:39] tonight
[50:40] I feel he's ready to break the plans of
[50:42] wickedness I feel like seeing Jesus who
[50:45] was slain and hung on a tree that seen
[50:48] Jesus with power and authority yet he
[50:51] humbled himself the prophet said if you
[50:53] want Power get next to God and unhumble
[50:56] yourself before God he said you'll have
[50:59] more power than the man screaming and
[51:02] jumping and praising and worshiping God
[51:04] you'll have more power than him because
[51:06] you could humble yourself before God
[51:08] this great King Of Who We Are
[51:11] huh the creator of Heaven and Earth
[51:14] humble himself
[51:16] and became sin
[51:18] and became filthy became wretched like
[51:21] we were to be wretched oh Hallelujah
[51:24] suffered many things for our sake
[51:26] he became man why so that man could once
[51:30] again become God
[51:31] because that was all original condition
[51:35] isn't that right
[51:36] oh he came to redeem us and to redeem
[51:40] means to bring back
[51:41] I know I'm taking my time tonight but
[51:44] I'm just waiting for God to drop down
[51:45] and bless you because I can't do it
[51:48] I know I can't do it now I'm just
[51:51] yielding to his presence
[51:52] are you with me this evening
[51:55] redeem means to bring back
[51:57] to bring back to a former condition
[52:00] because you see you are always in God's
[52:03] mind perfect

[54:46] soul but Jesus
[54:49] I don't care what it is he said put no
[54:53] Idols before me or he wants all the
[54:56] worship or he wants all the praise he
[54:59] wants all the honor that is true to his

[55:09] flirty of all the glory he created you

[55:18] begin to raise our hands you gotta
[55:20] forget about yourself
[55:22] concentrate on him and worship him and
[55:26] think about what he's done for you he's
[55:28] done so much for you you cannot tell it
[55:31] all you cannot understand it all just
[55:35] give God worship you just give God
[55:37] praise forget about yourself
[55:42] Hallelujah
[55:47] Hallelujah
[55:50] is something special about you
[55:52] there's something wonderful about you
[55:55] makes you think about that story about
[55:57] the African slave
[56:00] and he was in the
[56:02] slavery condition just like everybody
[56:04] else
[56:05] it's not right
[56:07] but he walked different
[56:10] he talked different from the other
[56:12] slaves
[56:14] he moved a little differently they might
[56:16] have all looked the same from the
[56:17] outside
[56:19] but you could see from his conduct
[56:21] and from his behavior
[56:23] that he was a little different from the
[56:25] other slaves
[56:27] isn't that right
[56:28] he spoke a little differently he was a
[56:30] more positive attitude kind of person
[56:33] when others was looking up he was
[56:35] looking down he was looking up when
[56:37] others were depressed he was always in
[56:39] High Spirits
[56:40] and one day a merchant came by and he
[56:43] wanted to buy one of those slaves
[56:46] but he had his eye on this special one
[56:48] and he told a slave master he said I
[56:50] want that slave
[56:53] because he recognized there was
[56:54] something special about him isn't that
[56:55] right
[56:56] the slave owner said he's not for sale
[56:59] I can't tell him
[57:01] I can't do it he's too precious
[57:04] he's too different from the rest
[57:07] the merchant said I noticed he's
[57:09] different
[57:09] but I want to know why why what makes
[57:12] him tick like that what makes him
[57:14] operate like that what makes him move
[57:17] like that oh hallelujah hallelujah
[57:20] that's not right
[57:21] and the slave owner said back in Africa
[57:24] I began to check up on him I began to do
[57:27] a background search on this one
[57:28] particular slave I began to ask some
[57:30] questions and it began to only realize
[57:33] that back in Africa he is the son of a
[57:38] king in a camp in Africa
[57:41] his father is a great Chieftain
[57:43] his blood is royalty
[57:46] he sees himself a certain way
[57:48] that is why he walks the way he walks
[57:51] that is why he talks the way he talks
[57:54] he's just different and there's
[57:57] something about you tonight there's
[57:59] something about the way you walk there's
[58:01] something about the way you talk your
[58:04] family can see it your wife could see it
[58:07] your husband could see it come on now or
[58:10] even the devil can see it praise God he
[58:14] knows there's something about you
[58:16] Hallelujah
[58:19] oh the devil is not afraid of who you
[58:21] are now but he is afraid of what you are
[58:24] going to become or Hallelujah because he
[58:27] knows if you could connect back to who
[58:29] you was before the beginning to who you
[58:32] was before there was a moon before there
[58:34] was a star before there was an action
[58:36] you wouldn't know who you are you will
[58:39] have authority in court
[58:41] to tell the devil pull right back
[58:48] oh they've got to praise tonight
[58:54] Hallelujah
[58:57] so put a smile on your face this evening
[58:59] put your shoulders back this evening you
[59:01] are not what the devil says you are
[59:04] oh come on now you are not what the
[59:06] enemy says you are you are not what your
[59:09] family says you are you are What God
[59:11] Says You Are
[59:12] this is who I am if anybody asks me just
[59:17] who I am Tell them I've been a team
[59:21] I've been bought with a price
[59:23] I am somebody inside of here tonight and
[59:27] if I want to be healed I could just go
[59:29] to this because this has my name all
[59:32] over it
[59:38] oh somebody answer me somebody answer me
[59:41] tonight answer me like a man where was
[59:45] how
[59:46] stop
[59:57] I feel him I feel him I feel him in this
[1:00:00] place tonight I feel him in his place
[1:00:02] right now
[1:00:04] the one with the nail prince in his hand
[1:00:06] he's moving through the aisles tonight
[1:00:09] there once was a film there once was a
[1:00:12] film
[1:00:14] think about David Wilkerson I think the
[1:00:16] cross on the switchblade that's right
[1:00:19] there was a young man in there who used
[1:00:20] to give a lot of trouble his name was
[1:00:22] Israel what a name for a man who gave a
[1:00:24] lot of trouble
[1:00:26] and the story David works I think was a
[1:00:29] true true story actually he actually in
[1:00:31] the end he started a church in Manhattan
[1:00:32] I think
[1:00:33] and um in New York but he was preaching
[1:00:35] to lost souls in New York trying to save
[1:00:37] these young kids from gangs and violence
[1:00:40] and this one particular young man is
[1:00:42] named Israel he was a gang leader
[1:00:45] and I think it was a Momos or something
[1:00:46] I can't remember the names gangs and so
[1:00:48] on but he was a gang leader and he was
[1:00:50] really high up in the ranks if you
[1:00:52] wanted to know what to do in the gang
[1:00:53] you had to go and ask Israel what to do
[1:00:55] because he was one of the
[1:00:57] hi Hitman trigger finger he was crazy
[1:01:01] he was um he had a bloodlust like never
[1:01:04] before
[1:01:05] and David Wilkerson would always go with
[1:01:07] his Bible and preach the word of God
[1:01:08] preach it to Israel Israel to laugh at
[1:01:10] it mock at it scuff at it he would do
[1:01:13] all kinds of things but there come a
[1:01:15] time when
[1:01:16] this preacher began to he held a
[1:01:18] convention
[1:01:19] and for all these young gang leaders and
[1:01:21] all these young people and the spirit of
[1:01:23] God dropped down began to save them
[1:01:24] begin to do something among the lives of
[1:01:26] these young people that they had never
[1:01:28] seen before or when God began to move in
[1:01:31] the camp I remember Israel
[1:01:34] he was saved something happened to him
[1:01:37] he got in contact with the same Jesus
[1:01:39] Christ he got in contact with the same
[1:01:42] God that we're talking about tonight
[1:01:44] and they were beginning to hand out
[1:01:45] Bibles after the service and Israel pick
[1:01:48] up the Bible
[1:01:49] and he opened the Bible so I think the
[1:01:51] Old Testament and he said wait a minute
[1:01:53] wait a minute he said look my name is
[1:01:56] all over this Bible he said look Israel
[1:01:59] is here he said look Israel here he said
[1:02:02] look Israel here he said I didn't know
[1:02:05] and I was part of this glorious day
[1:02:09] foreign
[1:02:14] when we were lost and undone without God
[1:02:18] or his son but then he reached down his
[1:02:21] hand for you you begin to see your name
[1:02:23] all over the power he promised you Joy
[1:02:27] come on now he promised you the Holy
[1:02:29] Ghost he promised you peace he promised
[1:02:32] you your children he promised you the
[1:02:35] baptism of fire he promised to be with
[1:02:38] you he said I'll never leave you he said
[1:02:41] I'll never forsake you
[1:02:43] who's he talking about he's talking
[1:02:45] about you when you begin to see yourself
[1:02:48] in the world
[1:02:55] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:58] what is it the word mixed with shakes
[1:03:00] it's a word mixed with faith
[1:03:03] he told kirian he said the sword of the
[1:03:05] Lord and of Gideon don't just say the
[1:03:08] sword of the Lord but put yourself in
[1:03:10] there too
[1:03:11] put yourself in the Bible put yourself
[1:03:14] in them promises if God was talking
[1:03:16] about the Holy Ghost he was talking
[1:03:18] about me if God was talking about
[1:03:21] Deliverance he was talking about me if
[1:03:24] God said be there for perfect he was
[1:03:27] talking about you
[1:03:32] oh answer me like a man answer me like a
[1:03:36] man and somebody like a man who will
[1:03:39] stop
[1:03:41] I can't hear you
[1:03:43] I can't hear
[1:03:54] Hallelujah
[1:04:02] Hallelujah
[1:04:05] can I take my time tonight
[1:04:09] it's important for you to see yourself
[1:04:10] in the world
[1:04:12] without a vision the people perish
[1:04:15] you'll be coming to church for years but
[1:04:17] if you don't have a vision
[1:04:19] you're not gonna get anywhere
[1:04:21] you're gonna just be coming to church
[1:04:24] there's millions of people on the island
[1:04:25] two and a half million people on this
[1:04:27] island a certain percentage of that
[1:04:30] they go to church
[1:04:32] a lot of people go to church there's no
[1:04:34] power in that but you see when you take
[1:04:37] this word
[1:04:38] and you begin to do something about it
[1:04:41] that's when the word has an effect on
[1:04:43] your life
[1:04:44] and that's when the devil goes on a
[1:04:47] rampage because he doesn't want you to
[1:04:49] do something about a word that you're
[1:04:51] hearing
[1:04:53] isn't that right isn't that right
[1:04:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:58] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:01] the people at the pool of Bethesda
[1:05:04] isn't that right
[1:05:06] excuse me
[1:05:07] they were doing something about that
[1:05:09] angel that dropped by and stood the
[1:05:11] waters isn't that right he would drop
[1:05:14] down and Trouble the waters
[1:05:16] and you see God God God sets things up
[1:05:18] where he likes to struggle
[1:05:20] he likes for you to contend he likes for
[1:05:22] you to fight
[1:05:23] to press your way the Bible said since
[1:05:26] John come on the scene
[1:05:28] the kingdom of God is preached and every
[1:05:31] man
[1:05:32] not some man
[1:05:35] come on now
[1:05:36] not certain kind of man
[1:05:38] not people of low-class society of
[1:05:40] medium-class society or High Society
[1:05:42] people no no no no every man
[1:05:45] press their way
[1:05:47] into the kingdom
[1:05:49] the kingdom suffered violence and the
[1:05:52] violent taken by force and I can imagine
[1:05:55] how vile the scene would get at the pool
[1:05:58] of Bethesda when people were rushing to
[1:06:00] get their blessing when people were
[1:06:02] rushing to get their touch when people
[1:06:05] are rushing to get their healing to get
[1:06:07] their anointing but it wasn't a time for
[1:06:10] people to say sorry it wasn't a time for
[1:06:12] excuse me when the angel began to stir
[1:06:15] the pool when the angel began to trouble
[1:06:17] the water you had to do something about
[1:06:21] that angel or you would get nothing from
[1:06:23] God
[1:06:26] oh
[1:06:28] there is somebody with me tonight
[1:06:30] answer me tonight
[1:06:35] oh hallelujah hallelujah you had to do
[1:06:39] something
[1:06:40] for something that happened
[1:06:42] action is caused isn't that right
[1:06:44] praise God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:46] hallelujah
[1:06:48] my I haven't even got to my text yet
[1:06:50] praise God I'm just building a
[1:06:51] background here it's not right
[1:06:53] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but do
[1:06:55] you love him
[1:06:57] he loves the contest he loves the battle
[1:06:59] he loves the struggle because the
[1:07:02] struggle proves what is in you
[1:07:04] isn't that right it proves what is
[1:07:06] inside of your heart if you have a real
[1:07:08] desire because you see if your
[1:07:10] lackadaisical it will show on the
[1:07:12] outside
[1:07:13] it's not right
[1:07:15] if you if you're backward in your mind
[1:07:17] and thinking and slow to the to the
[1:07:19] promises of God if you if you're slow to
[1:07:21] the draw it'll show on the outside when
[1:07:24] the test comes come on now when when
[1:07:26] when when the Press comes down come on
[1:07:28] now it will show what's inside of you
[1:07:31] that's why God loves to give a test God
[1:07:33] loves to test his sons and daughters of
[1:07:36] God to see what is inside of them to see
[1:07:39] what hidden potential that is lying
[1:07:42] inside of you there is more to you
[1:07:45] tonight
[1:07:46] that meets the eye
[1:07:48] or answer me somebody
[1:07:51] there's more to you than the devil can
[1:07:54] see but the only way to prove that is
[1:07:56] true a test the only way to prove that
[1:07:58] is true and experience when something
[1:08:01] begins to happen then it begins to show
[1:08:03] up oh Hallelujah what's on the inside
[1:08:05] what desire you have inside of you isn't
[1:08:08] that right
[1:08:12] one time God called a man call Gideon
[1:08:15] he said
[1:08:17] I chose you because you're a mighty man
[1:08:19] of Valor
[1:08:20] of course Gideon didn't quite believe
[1:08:22] that
[1:08:23] I don't blame him because I wouldn't
[1:08:24] have believed it either
[1:08:26] because Gideon was said to be a kind of
[1:08:28] a short guy and he was said to be kind
[1:08:30] of look insignificant looking young guy
[1:08:33] but God called the Young because they
[1:08:35] are strong come on
[1:08:36] amen young people so it doesn't matter
[1:08:38] how young you are God could still use
[1:08:40] you oh hallelujah hallelujah to put the
[1:08:43] church on fire he could use you to put a
[1:08:46] devil on a run he could use you to knock
[1:08:48] Satan unconscious oh hallelujah
[1:08:51] hallelujah young people are very
[1:08:53] powerful people in the hands of God and
[1:08:56] anytime God gets you in his hands he
[1:08:59] could to create damage to the enemy he
[1:09:01] could do great damage to Satan that's
[1:09:03] why the enemy has been afflicting the
[1:09:06] young people so much but it's coming up
[1:09:08] power to break the chains off of them
[1:09:11] there's coming a power to defeat the
[1:09:14] Devil that's coming up power in the
[1:09:17] church now to break the curse of sin to
[1:09:20] pick the curse of the enemy off of our
[1:09:22] young people
[1:09:24] only hold them for our time but when God
[1:09:27] is ready for you you can't go nowhere
[1:09:30] but to Jesus you gotta drag yourself God
[1:09:34] will hold you by the neck where do you
[1:09:36] think you're going tying this up
[1:09:42] and God was ready for Gideon
[1:09:45] said the almighty man of hell
[1:09:49] answer me like a man
[1:09:51] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:09:53] begin to talk to Gideon you're going to
[1:09:55] prove himself together
[1:09:57] now Gideon knows that God is real and
[1:09:59] he's for real this time he's for serious
[1:10:01] I heard about this God from the stories
[1:10:04] of Joshua and I heard about this chord
[1:10:06] from the stories of Moses but Kitty and
[1:10:08] saw God for himself and that's what need
[1:10:11] to happen to you in here tonight you
[1:10:13] need to see God for yourself otherwise
[1:10:16] you're just playing Church
[1:10:19] until you see God real
[1:10:21] in your home and in your heart and in
[1:10:24] your life
[1:10:28] oh answer me like a man somebody
[1:10:30] oh hallelujah hallelujah talk back to me
[1:10:33] somebody
[1:10:39] and he said call the man up
[1:10:41] thousands came and answered the call
[1:10:45] you're making a call to war
[1:10:47] and then all of a sudden God speaks to
[1:10:50] Gideon
[1:10:51] and tells Gideon to say a certain thing
[1:10:53] and get him he gets to talk to the
[1:10:55] people
[1:10:57] and keep beginning of giving my last
[1:10:58] chance you see if you have anything to
[1:11:00] do if you have anything that you need
[1:11:02] that is more important than this here
[1:11:03] right now feel free to go ahead
[1:11:05] and a large majority walked away
[1:11:08] a large majority thought it more
[1:11:10] important to go and see about other
[1:11:11] things see about their family and their
[1:11:13] cattle and their sheep so this smaller
[1:11:16] portion come down with giriana and God
[1:11:18] is beginning to filter them out
[1:11:20] and this small portion of people that
[1:11:23] come out after the call to war was made
[1:11:26] God took a smaller portion of that
[1:11:28] people
[1:11:29] and he said carry them down to the river
[1:11:31] carry them down to the water and they
[1:11:34] tell them to drink from that water he
[1:11:36] said let every man go and drink for
[1:11:38] themselves oh hallelujah hallelujah it's
[1:11:41] not right
[1:11:42] and they begin to go and drink at the
[1:11:44] water and God begins to speak to Gideon
[1:11:46] and he said Gideon don't call the ones
[1:11:49] that have too much pride to drink don't
[1:11:52] call the ones that kneeling with their
[1:11:53] knees and those one that don't want to
[1:11:55] get their dress dirty he said oh call
[1:11:57] the ones that that Freight to kneel down
[1:11:59] he said no no he said call the water
[1:12:01] laugh us he said call the ones that lay
[1:12:03] prostrate before the river he said call
[1:12:06] the water lapis
[1:12:12] God is looking for thirsty people God is
[1:12:16] looking for desperate people people who
[1:12:19] are water lappers people who are not
[1:12:21] afraid people who are not ashamed of the
[1:12:24] Gospel of Jesus Christ people who are
[1:12:27] not ashamed to be identified with him
[1:12:30] God is calling for water lapis he said
[1:12:33] the hour common hours when the true
[1:12:36] worshipers Are Gonna Worship the father
[1:12:39] in spirits and in truth
[1:12:45] I need somebody to help me tonight
[1:12:48] somebody shout unto God tonight
[1:12:51] oh Hallelujah
[1:12:53] I need somebody who's not ashamed of him
[1:12:55] tonight to be identified with court
[1:12:58] tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:13:01] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:13:02] Hallelujah
[1:13:04] Hallelujah
[1:13:06] the woman
[1:13:08] that brought
[1:13:10] her Allah backs the box to Jesus
[1:13:15] she was in a condition
[1:13:17] isn't that right the Bible said she was
[1:13:19] a prostitute
[1:13:21] woman
[1:13:24] Michael
[1:13:25] and here was the Pharisees
[1:13:27] having a social Gathering
[1:13:31] is not
[1:13:32] try and picture this
[1:13:34] a Pharisee is throwing a party
[1:13:38] that that went right over your head
[1:13:41] a Pharisee is throwing a party
[1:13:44] he's throwing a a good time
[1:13:47] that's kind of strange but so were they
[1:13:50] trying to trap Jesus they were so trying
[1:13:53] to trap Jesus and to get Jesus in a
[1:13:55] corner and to embarrass him and to make
[1:13:58] support of him
[1:14:00] that they decided to throw a party
[1:14:02] something that I don't think they really
[1:14:04] do
[1:14:05] because that's a kind of a boring party
[1:14:08] but here was this great party with all
[1:14:10] these official heads of the Pharisees
[1:14:13] and the sex and the scribes of the of
[1:14:16] the of the Sadducees and all these great
[1:14:18] esteemed men came to this so-called
[1:14:21] party
[1:14:22] but they knew what the plan was they
[1:14:24] knew what the plot was they were all in
[1:14:26] it
[1:14:28] because they provided no one at the tape
[1:14:30] at the door of the feast to wash Jesus's
[1:14:33] feet when he would come
[1:14:34] they gave him us gave Jesus a special
[1:14:36] invitation just to make fun of him just
[1:14:38] to mock him just to just to just to be
[1:14:40] cruel to him
[1:14:42] because he didn't like him at all but
[1:14:43] you see Jesus anytime he's invited he
[1:14:47] always comes
[1:14:48] anytime you invite Jesus
[1:14:51] I think that's a quote on our Facebook
[1:14:53] page
[1:14:54] anytime you make an invitation to Jesus
[1:14:56] he comes anyway
[1:14:58] no matter where it is no matter how it
[1:15:00] is he always comes
[1:15:03] the prophet preacher message called
[1:15:05] doors and doors he said you could open
[1:15:07] the door to your living room or they
[1:15:09] don't have to open the door to your
[1:15:10] bedroom
[1:15:11] Jesus will be let in as far as you let
[1:15:13] him to go in
[1:15:15] is that right some people Entertain You
[1:15:17] on the porch and that's as far as you
[1:15:19] could go with them they are not going to
[1:15:21] let you in the living room
[1:15:23] you got to be a little closer in
[1:15:24] friendship I guess to be led into the
[1:15:26] living room
[1:15:27] that's a special kind of place
[1:15:29] and then there's an even more private
[1:15:31] kind of a place for you to invite
[1:15:33] somebody into your bedroom into your
[1:15:35] personal space
[1:15:37] is that right
[1:15:38] and here was Jesus invited to a place
[1:15:41] where he was being mocked at scuffed
[1:15:43] that ridicule made fun of scrutinized
[1:15:46] heavily
[1:15:47] yet he was God in flesh and they failed
[1:15:51] to see it but yet was their attitude
[1:15:53] towards this man Jesus called the Christ
[1:15:56] but here was a woman with a condition
[1:15:59] here was a woman who had a need she
[1:16:01] needed something
[1:16:02] and she saw that Jesus had a need also
[1:16:05] and she saw that Jesus's need was
[1:16:08] greater than her own and she took the
[1:16:10] most expensive thing that she could find
[1:16:12] she ran home and got her Alabaster Box
[1:16:15] she ran home and got the most expensive
[1:16:18] kind of perfume
[1:16:20] it's not right
[1:16:22] she didn't buy this perfume at the ten
[1:16:24] dollar store no this is not the twenty
[1:16:27] dollar store perfume this is the kind of
[1:16:29] perfume we'll go to buy at the magic box
[1:16:31] or something this is the kind of perfume
[1:16:33] you would spend a lot of money on
[1:16:35] same and somebody oh Hallelujah isn't
[1:16:38] that right it was an expensive perfume
[1:16:40] it was a perfume of great price it cost
[1:16:43] something to her
[1:16:45] isn't that right and she took the most
[1:16:48] costly thing that she had
[1:16:50] the thing that valued the most to her
[1:16:52] and she was willing to present that to
[1:16:55] Jesus and some of us are so cheap with
[1:16:58] our praise some of us are so cheap with
[1:17:00] all worship we don't want to present
[1:17:03] something to God but God is looking for
[1:17:05] the most valuable thing he said what do
[1:17:07] you have
[1:17:09] what do you have this evening to give to
[1:17:12] Jesus what do you have to give to me
[1:17:17] oh come on now come on now oh hallelujah
[1:17:22] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:26] where am I going
[1:17:29] she came into the presence of the feast
[1:17:31] a knelt down before Jesus she didn't
[1:17:34] look at the left she didn't look to the
[1:17:35] right she saw this man with dirty feet
[1:17:38] sitting in the corner ridiculed no one
[1:17:42] was talking to him they were laughing
[1:17:43] and having their own inside jokes
[1:17:45] what a condition and here was this woman
[1:17:48] she began to knee long before God and
[1:17:50] she began to cry and she began to cry
[1:17:53] and the tear ducts of her eyes begin to
[1:17:55] open up a little more than it should but
[1:17:58] it was for a purpose because his feet
[1:18:00] needed washing and God had a need of her
[1:18:03] tear ducts so he opened her tear ducts
[1:18:06] and they began to flow like a river and
[1:18:08] they began to wash the feet of Jesus
[1:18:11] they began to
[1:18:13] fleeing the feet of Jesus
[1:18:16] but there's a powerful thing about the
[1:18:18] story that I heard
[1:18:19] that she began to let her hair down
[1:18:22] to wipe his feet apparently in Jewish
[1:18:25] custom it is unseemingly for a woman to
[1:18:28] let her hair down in the presence of men
[1:18:31] if she was married her husband could
[1:18:34] have put her away for that act that she
[1:18:37] did but sometimes tonight I feel like
[1:18:40] letting my hair down and I feel like
[1:18:43] letting God know how much he really
[1:18:45] means to be you see when God means
[1:18:49] something to you you don't mind if you
[1:18:52] act unseemingly I don't care what people
[1:18:55] think about Jimmy if I have to lose my
[1:18:58] tie a little bit if I have to lose the
[1:19:00] buttons on my shirt if I have to get all
[1:19:03] sweaty and messed up I don't care if I
[1:19:07] have to act unsevenly but God means
[1:19:10] something to me tonight I don't mind
[1:19:13] letting my hair down in the presence of
[1:19:16] almighty God because he means something
[1:19:19] to me tonight
[1:19:21] Hallelujah
[1:19:26] oh what does he mean to you tonight
[1:19:30] does he mean something to you
[1:19:34] if he does then praise him
[1:19:38] if he does then worship Him
[1:19:40] if he does then thank him give him the
[1:19:43] glory
[1:19:44] that is due
[1:19:46] to his name
[1:19:48] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:51] hallelujah
[1:19:54] certain people come to Jesus certain
[1:19:56] Greeks isn't that right came to the
[1:19:58] feast
[1:20:00] and it's asked of him saying so we would
[1:20:03] see Jesus
[1:20:05] Jesus being led by the spirit of God
[1:20:08] begins to speak certain words to them
[1:20:11] is that right
[1:20:12] he says unless a corn of wheat
[1:20:14] fall into the ground and die
[1:20:17] alone
[1:20:19] isn't that right
[1:20:21] Hallelujah now this corn of wheat that
[1:20:23] Jesus is speaking about
[1:20:26] is a seed isn't that right
[1:20:28] and the word of God when spoken Goes
[1:20:31] Forth as a seed
[1:20:34] it's not right
[1:20:35] when he speaks it materializes it takes
[1:20:38] place
[1:20:39] it's not right
[1:20:41] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:45] many many men could you live Lord Hannah
[1:20:47] praise this evening
[1:20:56] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:58] hallelujah
[1:21:01] many many many men
[1:21:04] thank you Jesus
[1:21:06] okay
[1:21:08] let me read this here from the spoken
[1:21:09] word is the Original Seed
[1:21:12] he said now the word of God is eternal
[1:21:16] he said God be an infinite cannot speak
[1:21:19] one thing and then later on change it to
[1:21:22] something else
[1:21:24] to a better decision
[1:21:25] because every decision of god is perfect
[1:21:31] it's not right
[1:21:33] so his decision to have you here in this
[1:21:36] age
[1:21:37] of all evil
[1:21:40] and this messed up society that we're
[1:21:42] living in
[1:21:43] his decision to have you here living in
[1:21:46] 2015 in this time now
[1:21:49] to be born into the family or born into
[1:21:52] to be come up through the way you come
[1:21:54] up his decision to do that was perfect
[1:22:00] is that right because he knew that there
[1:22:04] was something inside of you
[1:22:05] that despite the opposition that despite
[1:22:08] what was around you that you were going
[1:22:11] to make it anyhow
[1:22:13] he knew that he put something inside
[1:22:15] your soul that no matter what the devil
[1:22:18] throw
[1:22:19] in your direction he knew that you were
[1:22:23] going to make it anyhow
[1:22:28] oh answer me like a man somebody
[1:22:33] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:36] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:38] oh Hallelujah he smiled when he saw you
[1:22:41] in 2015 because he knew that the devil
[1:22:44] was in trouble and every time you wake
[1:22:46] up in the morning the devil gets a
[1:22:48] headache bigger than you even know
[1:22:50] because you just woke up this morning he
[1:22:53] oh Halal he began to Tremor he begins to
[1:22:56] shake because there's a power in you
[1:22:58] tonight the Bible said the devil
[1:23:00] believes and trembles when he sees the
[1:23:05] weakest Saints go to praying on their
[1:23:08] knees when you go to praying to your
[1:23:10] father when you go to pray to your
[1:23:13] father the devil begins to get a mind
[1:23:16] battle because he knows that the word
[1:23:19] says ask anything in my name and it
[1:23:23] shall be given unto you
[1:23:27] preach back to me somebody
[1:23:29] oh preach back to me somebody
[1:23:35] Hallelujah
[1:23:36] Hallelujah
[1:23:38] Hallelujah
[1:23:40] said every decision of god is perfect
[1:23:44] he's not going to change his mind on it
[1:23:48] his mind is already made up David said I
[1:23:51] would O Lord is settled in heaven
[1:23:52] forever
[1:23:54] isn't that right once it's spoken it
[1:23:57] cannot come back for once it's spoken it
[1:24:00] cannot come back with nothing once that
[1:24:02] word is spoken it has to come into a
[1:24:05] manifestation of whatever the word is is
[1:24:09] that right
[1:24:11] said he cannot watch his word is spoken
[1:24:14] Prophet said it can never die
[1:24:17] it lives on and on and on and can never
[1:24:21] die because it is God and His word can
[1:24:25] no more die than he can die
[1:24:28] that's the reason we read in first John
[1:24:30] or Saint John first chapter he said in
[1:24:31] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:24:34] was with God and the Word was God and
[1:24:39] the Word was made flesh the same word
[1:24:41] that was spoken in the beginning with
[1:24:45] his eternal purpose come on over and was
[1:24:48] made flesh and twelvet Among Us he said
[1:24:52] that was God's word
[1:24:58] spoke something in the beginning and it
[1:25:01] had to comfort no matter what the
[1:25:03] obstacle was no matter what the
[1:25:05] situation around it the word of God once
[1:25:08] spoken cannot return
[1:25:10] but it shall accomplish the purpose that
[1:25:13] it was sent forth for it to accomplish
[1:25:16] it's not right
[1:25:18] and I shared something down in tickle
[1:25:20] Mountain Amen on Wednesday night going
[1:25:22] there
[1:25:23] Hallelujah about a special kind of a
[1:25:26] plant
[1:25:27] they are underwater plants isn't that
[1:25:29] right there are plants that actually
[1:25:31] have the ability to grow underwater
[1:25:33] most of the times we see plants growing
[1:25:35] above the water in the land bushy areas
[1:25:39] grass areas trees shrubs Hills Etc but
[1:25:42] there is a certain kind of grass called
[1:25:43] underwater grass or seagrass and
[1:25:47] sometimes because of the condition of
[1:25:49] the water it can hinder the growth of
[1:25:51] this underwater grass sometimes it could
[1:25:54] destroy this underwater vegetation is
[1:25:57] that right but there is a certain kind
[1:25:59] of plant called a Lily and a lily has
[1:26:03] the unique ability that despite the
[1:26:06] condition of the water that Lily will
[1:26:09] press through any muck that Lily will
[1:26:12] press through any Maya that Lily could
[1:26:15] press through any condition that it
[1:26:17] would find itself in and you could throw
[1:26:20] cabbage in the water you could throw all
[1:26:22] pails in the water you could throw a
[1:26:24] fridge in the water that won't stop the
[1:26:26] Lily from pressing through that Lily is
[1:26:30] on a mission that Lily will not stop
[1:26:32] growing that Lily is carrying within it
[1:26:36] a life form of a flower and that Lily
[1:26:39] has one mission to get to the top and a
[1:26:43] Christian on this Earth he and she has
[1:26:46] one Mission One mission to get to the
[1:26:49] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and
[1:26:53] there's nothing inside of you that is
[1:26:55] going to stop as long as you are a son
[1:26:58] of God tonight or answer me tonight as
[1:27:02] long as you are daughter of God if
[1:27:04] there's something inside your heart if
[1:27:07] there's something inside your soul if
[1:27:09] there's something God put inside of you
[1:27:10] you cannot stop you will Press Your Way
[1:27:14] press pass and more come on now press
[1:27:18] pass the Maya press pass a condition
[1:27:20] press pass what the devil throws in your
[1:27:24] direction into the glory of sunshine of
[1:27:28] the Holy Ghost That Fire
[1:27:33] Hallelujah
[1:27:37] nothing can stop you nothing can stop
[1:27:40] you from getting to that place
[1:27:42] Hallelujah where you know you belong
[1:27:45] nobody have to explain to Lily nobody
[1:27:48] have to carry a little school to find
[1:27:50] out how to be a Lily that is built into
[1:27:53] the Lily to press past the muck it is
[1:27:56] built into a fish to swim it is built
[1:27:59] into a bird to fly and then it's built
[1:28:02] into every Son of God to press past the
[1:28:06] enemy
[1:28:08] to stand having done all to stand
[1:28:12] stand and fight
[1:28:18] Hallelujah
[1:28:21] Hallelujah
[1:28:23] Hallelujah
[1:28:25] Hallelujah
[1:28:27] sometimes children are born of parents
[1:28:30] I think scientists say it at 10 percent
[1:28:33] of the attributes of a child
[1:28:36] is almost innate it's built in
[1:28:39] and sometimes they'll have little
[1:28:40] children that are born and they don't
[1:28:42] know their parents but I have a certain
[1:28:44] kind of way that they behave
[1:28:46] I'm trying to say that part of that is
[1:28:49] actually given from the parents and
[1:28:52] sometimes a child may be born in a
[1:28:54] parent home and but they never knew
[1:28:56] their parents and when they reunite they
[1:28:58] begin to realize that they have like
[1:28:59] characteristics that they have like
[1:29:02] attributes that their eyes look a little
[1:29:04] bit like Daddy that their nose look a
[1:29:06] little bit like Daddy like their mouth
[1:29:08] look a little bit like their biological
[1:29:09] father or mother isn't that right each
[1:29:13] child carries the attribute of the
[1:29:15] parent that that brought them forth in
[1:29:18] the first place isn't that right
[1:29:20] scientists even goes past to say that
[1:29:22] some boys cross their legs like their
[1:29:24] father does some boys walk a little bit
[1:29:26] like their father does some boys Express
[1:29:29] themselves they never been with their
[1:29:30] father some of them may not know their
[1:29:32] father by Adam from Adam but they but
[1:29:35] just by their reuniting after all those
[1:29:37] long years sometimes children were
[1:29:39] adopted and sent away and they began to
[1:29:41] search for their real father come back
[1:29:43] to their real home to find out who their
[1:29:44] biological father was or who the
[1:29:46] biological mother was in the reunites
[1:29:49] and they begin to realize that they have
[1:29:51] similar attributes that they have
[1:29:53] similar things about them that they have
[1:29:55] similar books that they like to read
[1:29:56] they have similar music that they like
[1:29:58] to listen to and just like natural
[1:30:00] parents could put natural attributes in
[1:30:03] a natural son or daughter so that God
[1:30:06] puts Supernatural attributes
[1:30:08] Supernatural likenesses in his sons and
[1:30:11] daughters you are just like your father
[1:30:14] tonight you walk a little bit like him
[1:30:16] you talk a little bit like him some of
[1:30:19] you who may have never never met him or
[1:30:22] Hallelujah but you have some of his
[1:30:24] attributes tonight there's something
[1:30:26] inside of you tonight that has the
[1:30:28] ability to hear from God to connect back
[1:30:32] to your father
[1:30:37] Hallelujah
[1:30:39] Hallelujah
[1:30:47] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:30:51] a many men 11 tonight
[1:30:54] oh my
[1:30:56] praise God is it here
[1:31:01] Hallelujah
[1:31:03] he said it's God's word
[1:31:06] isn't that right
[1:31:08] and he said the word of God continually
[1:31:10] goes on isn't that right
[1:31:12] Hallelujah
[1:31:14] amen isn't that right
[1:31:16] he said I'm tall this is from the spoken
[1:31:19] with real estate again
[1:31:20] says I'm told and if we could pick up an
[1:31:22] instrument
[1:31:23] that could catch it
[1:31:25] he said that a man's voice he said my
[1:31:28] voice
[1:31:29] that I speak today this is a prophet
[1:31:33] he said my voice that I speak today he
[1:31:36] said ten thousand years from now could
[1:31:39] still be picked up in the air
[1:31:41] like dropping a petal in the middle of a
[1:31:44] pond
[1:31:45] and the teeny little waves after they
[1:31:48] fail to be seen
[1:31:49] by the the eye by the naked eye continue
[1:31:52] on
[1:31:54] till it hits the bank
[1:31:55] and the airwaves of our voices he said
[1:31:58] continually travels around and around
[1:32:01] the world
[1:32:02] he said therefore
[1:32:04] then all voice what we say he said what
[1:32:07] we say will be our judgment Our
[1:32:10] Testimony would rise against us he said
[1:32:13] our own voices will echo in all heirs at
[1:32:18] the Judgment power of God when his great
[1:32:21] instrument catches every voice that's
[1:32:25] been spoke every word that has been
[1:32:28] muttered are you following me this
[1:32:30] evening
[1:32:31] so he says that the world is speaking
[1:32:33] right now even though you fail to hear
[1:32:35] them after a while he said they're still
[1:32:37] traveling throughout the Earth those
[1:32:40] waves are still bouncing around bouncing
[1:32:42] around in the Supernatural atmosphere
[1:32:44] he said and now there's only one way
[1:32:48] to stop that voice that is wrong he said
[1:32:52] that's repent
[1:32:54] he said that's repent
[1:32:57] God Alone can stop it he said if it he
[1:33:02] said if it doesn't it goes on and meets
[1:33:05] you up in the eternity
[1:33:09] oh is this a gospel he said therefore
[1:33:12] God being perfect
[1:33:14] and his voice Eternal his own voice
[1:33:18] would have to catch up with it therefore
[1:33:21] he must be perfect in every decision for
[1:33:25] once he says something it has to go all
[1:33:28] the way and come right back to the
[1:33:31] judgment
[1:33:31] can we see him as somebody so if a
[1:33:34] natural man's voice can speak something
[1:33:37] in a natural atmosphere
[1:33:39] and it will go on like that and go on
[1:33:42] and go on the only thing that could stop
[1:33:44] that is to repent is the blood of Jesus
[1:33:47] Christ the power of God to save that
[1:33:50] voice from meeting up for you in
[1:33:52] judgment some of the wrong things you
[1:33:54] said some of the things you said in your
[1:33:56] anger some of the things you said in
[1:33:58] your haste those words already went out
[1:34:01] the only thing to stop that the Bible
[1:34:04] the prophet said is to repent to make it
[1:34:07] wretch and the blood of God will go
[1:34:09] after that voice that's been spoken in
[1:34:12] the atmosphere oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:34:15] I'm kept and keep that thing from
[1:34:17] condemning you in the Judgment isn't
[1:34:19] that right and if a man's voice spoken
[1:34:22] in a natural has so much power then what
[1:34:25] about the voice of God when spoken in
[1:34:29] the Supernatural atmosphere
[1:34:31] oh somebody preached back to me when God
[1:34:35] speaks something it is not just for that
[1:34:37] time but it goes on forever and forever
[1:34:40] and forever when God spoke to Abraham
[1:34:44] and said thy seed shall possess the Gate
[1:34:48] of the enemy that word is over every
[1:34:52] Seed of Abraham
[1:34:55] somebody preached back to me
[1:34:57] therefore when Jesus died and
[1:35:00] reconnected on natural seed to that
[1:35:03] spiritual Seed of Abraham then that
[1:35:05] makes you chosen of the light then that
[1:35:08] makes you chosen of God that makes you
[1:35:10] the Royal Seed of Abraham to The
[1:35:13] Fellowship of Jesus Christ then that
[1:35:16] prophecy is over you tonight that every
[1:35:19] seed shall possess the king of his enemy
[1:35:26] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:29] somebody praise God somebody praise God
[1:35:32] somebody praise God so if you recognize
[1:35:35] tonight that there's a power over your
[1:35:38] seed that same word seed that is in your
[1:35:41] heart from before the beginning before
[1:35:44] there was a moon before there was a star
[1:35:46] before there was the atom or molecule
[1:35:48] God put a word seed in your heart then
[1:35:52] there's certain promises that are
[1:35:54] hanging over that seed and in its time
[1:35:56] and in its season that seed must come to
[1:36:00] life
[1:36:01] it's got to comfort
[1:36:03] it's got to produce whatever a life of
[1:36:07] the sea is Hallelujah
[1:36:17] Hallelujah
[1:36:19] Hallelujah
[1:36:22] many many men
[1:36:28] please
[1:36:30] Hallelujah
[1:36:32] see it's a seed
[1:36:34] you lay a seat down
[1:36:36] it doesn't look like much
[1:36:38] but in that seat is a potential
[1:36:40] to bring forth and produce something
[1:36:43] people might laugh at it people might
[1:36:46] call it names but that doesn't change
[1:36:48] the nature of the sea that doesn't
[1:36:50] change the power that is in the seed
[1:36:52] sometimes the seed is just in the wrong
[1:36:54] environment sometimes the seed is laying
[1:36:57] on a table somewhere sometimes the seed

[1:40:35] first man he created was Spirit man and
[1:40:38] he was in the image and likeness of God
[1:40:42] who was the first man Spirit man before
[1:40:45] there was flesh man before there was
[1:40:47] failure before there was a mistake
[1:40:48] before there was the sin that committed

[1:41:56] that Fallen man he said that's the real

[1:42:37] was an oak tree it was to bring forth an
[1:42:40] oak
[1:42:41] if it was a power it was to bring forth
[1:42:44] a palm
[1:42:45] because the great Creator had just sent
[1:42:48] forth his word amen listen to this and
[1:42:52] the word seed was there before the real

[1:59:59] foreign
[2:00:02] for three and a half years Jesus is
[2:00:05] dropping off wood planted word
[2:00:07] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen if
[2:00:11] you if don't believe I can all things
[2:00:14] will be made possible ask anything in my
[2:00:16] name it shall be given unto you all
[2:00:19] these signs shall follow them not
[2:00:21] believe in my name Nisha Castle Devils
[2:00:24] speaker
[2:00:26] the cast of devils isn't that right he's
[2:00:29] a sick raise the dead open your eyes are
[2:00:31] blind isn't that right he was speaking
[2:00:33] words to them knowing that this watering
[2:00:36] Spirit of the Holy Ghost was to come
[2:00:39] back upon the people and take that same
[2:00:41] planted world and make it living make it
[2:00:44] moving make it visible among the people
[2:00:48] because God cannot anoint anything
[2:00:50] outside of his word he's got to anoint
[2:00:54] the word for That season the word for an
[2:00:57] hour so he gave the disciples the word
[2:01:00] even though they didn't understand
[2:01:17] because he knew that that water in
[2:01:21] spirit would come upon the seed world
[2:01:23] that was being sown in their hearts
[2:01:27] Hallelujah
[2:01:36] Hallelujah
[2:01:39] that's why you have to receive the Holy
[2:01:41] Ghost
[2:01:43] Because unless a corner we'd fall into
[2:01:45] the ground and die it's a bad alone
[2:01:51] God in the beginning was alone with his
[2:01:54] thoughts
[2:01:55] he was alone with his thinking alone
[2:01:57] with his own program of knowing what he
[2:01:59] wanted to accomplish but it come to a
[2:02:01] point when he was tired of being alone
[2:02:04] God was fed up for being alone by
[2:02:07] himself so this great Supernatural
[2:02:10] Spirit Elohim created logos word oh
[2:02:14] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[2:02:15] created heaven and earth and everything
[2:02:17] and then said let us make man in our
[2:02:20] image and all likeness why because he
[2:02:22] wanted to have fellowship with his
[2:02:24] thoughts he wanted to have fellowship
[2:02:26] with his attributes he wanted to speak
[2:02:29] to his attributes and he wanted his
[2:02:31] attributes to talk back to him he wanted
[2:02:33] somebody to have a conversation with you
[2:02:36] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[2:02:38] Hallelujah
[2:02:40] Hallelujah and even when he created man
[2:02:43] he said it's not good for man to be
[2:02:45] alone and make him a help meet oh
[2:02:48] Hallelujah I'll take a rip from his side
[2:02:50] oh Hallelujah I create woman so that he
[2:02:53] can have fellowship with somebody
[2:02:55] it's not good for man to be alone isn't
[2:02:58] that right
[2:03:01] laying by itself alone God does not
[2:03:04] desire that kind of a thing what God
[2:03:06] desires is for your life it's for that
[2:03:09] seed to bring forth fruits to bring
[2:03:12] forth something to bring forth
[2:03:14] Hallelujah to show evidence to show
[2:03:17] fruitfulness to show visible life of God
[2:03:20] in you to be an expression of whatever
[2:03:23] the seed is
[2:03:27] it's not good for the sea to just remain
[2:03:29] a seed
[2:03:30] no no no no God wants to save fruit God
[2:03:33] wants to see life God wants us something
[2:03:36] to show for rich
[2:03:37] oh hallelujah hallelujah sometimes we
[2:03:40] too lazy sometimes you just lay around
[2:03:42] and say God give us a seed oh and we
[2:03:45] have a seed but that seed is no good
[2:03:47] unless it goes into the ground and die
[2:03:49] that seed is no good or if it's just a
[2:03:53] bite alone but when that sea go to die
[2:03:55] when that seed go to Rotten when that
[2:03:58] sea go to producing something a literal
[2:04:01] life begins to come out of that scene
[2:04:06] somebody
[2:04:12] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:04:15] Hallelujah
[2:04:17] oh man let me hurry up here
[2:04:21] every seed that is spoken
[2:04:25] there's a power inside
[2:04:27] power inside of it to transform itself
[2:04:31] into whatever the seed is supposed to be
[2:04:34] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:04:37] isn't that right
[2:04:39] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[2:04:41] God alone has the power to transform
[2:04:45] isn't that right
[2:04:47] Hallelujah
[2:04:48] you could try to conform somebody
[2:04:52] you could try to conform somebody tell
[2:04:54] them conform to this law
[2:04:57] Thou shalt not do this Thou shalt not do
[2:05:00] that you could conform to it
[2:05:03] isn't that right I tried to do it the
[2:05:05] best you can but that's not
[2:05:07] transformation
[2:05:08] isn't that right
[2:05:10] hallelujah hallelujah if somebody goes
[2:05:12] to prison the idea of a prison is to try
[2:05:14] to reform them so that they can get back
[2:05:16] into society so that they can fit in and
[2:05:19] perform a functional role in society
[2:05:21] that's called Reformation but that's not
[2:05:24] what we're talking about tonight what we
[2:05:27] are talking about is transformation The
[2:05:30] Prophet said it says the change it's to
[2:05:33] change your state from whatever you're
[2:05:35] in to another state entirely it is a
[2:05:38] change from one form to another it is a
[2:05:42] transformation you're not what you
[2:05:44] started out as but slowly bit by
[2:05:48] as you get closer to the headstone you
[2:05:50] begin to become a super race you begin
[2:05:52] to come by super church as you near The
[2:05:55] Headstone as you get greater as you get
[2:05:58] in contact with God as you get closer
[2:06:01] and closer into the presence of God
[2:06:03] suddenly begins to happen inside of you
[2:06:06] God begins to transform who you was into
[2:06:10] who you're supposed to be then you get a
[2:06:13] little bit of Faith then you get a
[2:06:14] little bit of pressure then you get a
[2:06:16] little bit of knowledge a little bit of
[2:06:17] temperance what is begin to happen you
[2:06:20] will begin to transform from the inside
[2:06:22] out not from the outside in
[2:06:26] oh come on now come on now you know what
[2:06:29] I'm talking about
[2:06:31] do you know what I'm talking about
[2:06:32] tonight
[2:06:35] there's some people will tell you that
[2:06:37] some Churches I think they preach and
[2:06:38] they say God loves you as you are
[2:06:41] they'll tell you stay as you are God
[2:06:44] loves you just as you are
[2:06:46] but that is not God's entire purpose
[2:06:49] that is not God's entire program
[2:06:51] hallelujah hallelujah yes God loves you
[2:06:53] as you are but he wants you to change
[2:06:56] Hallelujah he calls you out of something
[2:06:58] to put you into something
[2:07:01] that is redemption calling out of and
[2:07:05] going into
[2:07:06] isn't that right many people love the
[2:07:09] calling out part that's wonderful that's
[2:07:11] glorious come on shouting and dancing
[2:07:14] but the going into part that's the
[2:07:17] process that's the part that people
[2:07:19] don't like that's the part that hurts a
[2:07:21] little bit not the part that pains a
[2:07:23] little bit but it is necessary in order
[2:07:26] for you to become what God wants you to
[2:07:29] become you have to be willing to change
[2:07:31] you have to be willing to be led of God
[2:07:35] you say Lord You Are The Potter and I am
[2:07:39] the player you have to be willing to put
[2:07:42] yourself in God's hands and let him
[2:07:44] break you and let it melt you and let
[2:07:47] them mold you and let them shape you
[2:07:49] I'll let him form you into what he wants
[2:07:52] you to be
[2:07:54] outside of that
[2:07:56] you're just playing Church
[2:08:03] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:08:08] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:08:10] Hallelujah isn't that right
[2:08:13] well let me read a second and every
[2:08:15] everything under control okay he said no
[2:08:18] remember to bring he said when he put
[2:08:19] the seed in the Earth
[2:08:21] he said the seed can only come forth
[2:08:23] with the power of life within it to
[2:08:26] transform it from a seed to a plant
[2:08:30] or whatever it was see his transforming
[2:08:35] power he said now God put the seed in
[2:08:38] there
[2:08:39] with potentials that it would be what he
[2:08:41] said to be
[2:08:43] and as long as it stayed in its right
[2:08:45] category
[2:08:46] it would be just exactly what God said
[2:08:49] it would be he said it had to be that
[2:08:51] way because he had made it that way and
[2:08:55] he made a channel
[2:08:56] that anything that stays in his channel
[2:09:00] in his line of word it would have to
[2:09:03] bring forth exactly like his word said
[2:09:06] it would do
[2:09:07] it cannot move from there its Channel
[2:09:11] just exactly right isn't that right it's
[2:09:14] not mixed with any interpretation it's
[2:09:16] not mixed with any funny thought it's
[2:09:18] not mixed with any funny idea isn't that
[2:09:20] right but it's exactly what his word
[2:09:22] said it would be in the line of his word
[2:09:24] isn't that right
[2:09:25] he said it cannot move from there it's
[2:09:26] China just exactly he said so with
[2:09:28] everything in his Trust of his own son
[2:09:30] that would be that way he said it's all
[2:09:31] good okay
[2:09:32] and he said each one
[2:09:35] he said God said it's all good so I'll
[2:09:37] just rest and each one of those seeds
[2:09:40] had power in itself
[2:09:43] to transform itself into the species
[2:09:47] that I desire it to be he said that's
[2:09:51] what it must be because I have given
[2:09:54] every seed transforming power to make
[2:09:58] out of itself in its potentials now to
[2:10:01] make out of itself exactly what I want
[2:10:05] it to be
[2:10:06] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:10:10] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:10:12] hallelujah hallelujah he said and God
[2:10:15] has never changed this is just the same
[2:10:17] way today
[2:10:18] as he was then
[2:10:20] God is determined to do something he
[2:10:24] said the prophet said he will do it
[2:10:26] nothing is going to stop it he will do
[2:10:31] it hallelujah hallelujah isn't that
[2:10:33] right
[2:10:34] oh my so every seed has transforming
[2:10:37] power in itself to transform itself into
[2:10:40] what it's supposed to be isn't that
[2:10:42] right and for every age there were seeds
[2:10:44] that come forth to that age in Luther's
[2:10:47] day Luther was sent to a group of seeds
[2:10:50] that were to receive that message of
[2:10:53] justification they couldn't receive any
[2:10:55] other message and no other message could
[2:10:58] give them what they needed to perform
[2:11:00] for that day and that hour isn't that
[2:11:03] right they were the siege of
[2:11:04] justification for that hour and when
[2:11:07] they heard the message of Luther
[2:11:08] something inside of them stepped out and
[2:11:11] was identified with that message and
[2:11:13] they produced justification
[2:11:16] it's not right in Wesley's day there
[2:11:19] were seeds there to produce
[2:11:20] sanctification and they had a Revival
[2:11:23] it's not right in the age of the
[2:11:25] Pentecostal there were seeds there to
[2:11:28] bring back the Reformation of the gifts
[2:11:30] to Restoration of the gifts to the
[2:11:32] church oh Hallelujah isn't all right
[2:11:34] talking in tongues and healing a sick
[2:11:36] raise and a dead and casting out devils
[2:11:38] and there was a sea inside of them to do
[2:11:41] just what they had to do it's not right
[2:11:44] well the Prophet come at the end of the
[2:11:46] age to prophesy of another age to come
[2:11:49] he prophesied up a bright age he
[2:11:52] prophesied another people another people
[2:11:54] in the land who under their messenger
[2:11:57] would be the final voice to the final
[2:12:00] age
[2:12:06] so think it not strange tonight because
[2:12:09] no man could come unless the father draw
[2:12:12] him so you couldn't be anywhere else to
[2:12:14] match you couldn't hear any other
[2:12:16] message tonight you had to hear write
[2:12:19] what you are hearing tonight oh
[2:12:22] hallelujah hallelujah you have to come
[2:12:23] to this message you had to come to this
[2:12:26] inspiration you had to hear what you are
[2:12:28] hearing because inside of you locked up
[2:12:31] inside of you is a seed of God's
[2:12:34] potential to produce God's Perfection
[2:12:37] for this hour and for this season
[2:12:40] Hallelujah
[2:12:46] oh Amen Let me hear a piano
[2:12:49] I think I'll be on my time
[2:12:52] Hallelujah
[2:12:54] praise God
[2:12:56] Hallelujah
[2:12:58] oh my
[2:13:01] praise God
[2:13:03] thank you Jesus
[2:13:05] praise God hallelujah
[2:13:07] amen
[2:13:09] you see the hardest thing to do I've
[2:13:11] realized is the right thing
[2:13:14] the right thing is always seems to be
[2:13:17] the hardest thing to do
[2:13:19] isn't that right
[2:13:20] it was easy to heal the sick because
[2:13:22] these Aries are dead and cast out Devils
[2:13:24] for Jesus that was easy one time
[2:13:28] some people came and
[2:13:31] they're sick their friend was sick
[2:13:33] isn't that right lay him on a cut they
[2:13:36] said
[2:13:37] we love our friend and we're going to
[2:13:39] break up the roof and let him down
[2:13:41] through the roof because he has need to
[2:13:43] see Jesus
[2:13:45] oh hallelujah hallelujah that's the kind
[2:13:47] of friends to have the kind that will
[2:13:49] bring you to church they kind of bring
[2:13:51] you into the presence of God because
[2:13:53] they know God is the only one who can
[2:13:54] solve your problems they know God is the
[2:13:57] only one that can solve your situation
[2:13:59] when the situation is beyond what you
[2:14:02] can do that's when we bring it to God
[2:14:04] that's when we bring it to the Master's
[2:14:06] Hand he is able to transform he is able
[2:14:10] to recreate isn't all right hallelujah
[2:14:13] hallelujah it can change the situation
[2:14:15] and here was this friend that was being
[2:14:17] laid down through the roof while Jesus
[2:14:19] is preaching
[2:14:20] and when Jesus sees this lame man as lay
[2:14:23] before him the disciples begin to
[2:14:25] whisper among themselves Jesus said
[2:14:27] which one is easier he said my sins be
[2:14:31] take away this man's sins or forgive
[2:14:34] this man since
[2:14:35] or to tell him to pick up your bed and
[2:14:38] walk he said I could do both
[2:14:41] he said I sins be forgiven me he said
[2:14:44] pick up your pad and walk that man begin
[2:14:47] to catch all the Fate
[2:14:49] because you can't just pick up your bed
[2:14:51] and walk from a paralysis condition just
[2:14:54] like that no no no it takes fate
[2:14:57] to do what he did
[2:14:59] he began to move a little bit at the
[2:15:01] word of Jesus he began to move a little
[2:15:04] bit and that's what I needed to do this
[2:15:06] evening you just need to move a little
[2:15:08] bit if your hand could move then your
[2:15:11] arm could move and if you get the arm to
[2:15:13] move in then your body could move and if
[2:15:16] he could twist a little bit if he could
[2:15:18] jump a little bit if he could make it to
[2:15:20] put your feet into action then God began
[2:15:22] to do something for you tonight then God
[2:15:25] could begin to restore you tonight thank
[2:15:27] God they begin to heal you tonight of
[2:15:30] every Broken Heart of every broken part
[2:15:32] and of every broken life tonight
[2:15:38] Glory
[2:15:43] stuff wonderful
[2:15:47] easiest thing sometimes always
[2:15:51] you know good things it's good to do
[2:15:52] good things nice
[2:15:55] it's not right
[2:15:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:15:58] but the hardest thing is always the
[2:16:00] right thing to do
[2:16:01] amen it's not right
[2:16:04] I'm beginning to close
[2:16:06] amen
[2:16:07] Hallelujah he said which one is easy see
[2:16:10] thy sins be forgiven thee or pick up
[2:16:12] people and walk he said I can do both
[2:16:14] he said but at the Garden of Gethsemane
[2:16:17] he cried out said Lord if it is possible
[2:16:20] let this cup pass for me
[2:16:22] death was upon him
[2:16:24] the price was upon him
[2:16:26] he was about to pay the ultimate price
[2:16:28] for the world it was a hard thing to do
[2:16:31] but it was necessary
[2:16:33] death is hard
[2:16:35] but it is necessary isn't that right
[2:16:38] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:16:41] when Elisha was following Elijah he said
[2:16:43] Taria preethi said no I'm following you
[2:16:45] he followed from Bethel followed from
[2:16:49] gilga he followed to the school of the
[2:16:51] prophets but when he got to Jordan
[2:16:53] Hallelujah and Elijah said what do you
[2:16:56] want
[2:16:57] Elijah said I pray thee a double portion
[2:16:59] of that Spirit he said you ask a hard
[2:17:02] thing but nevertheless if you see me go
[2:17:06] if you stay with the word if you come
[2:17:09] with me across Jordan across the river
[2:17:11] of death across the Waters of Separation
[2:17:14] if you see it through to the end if
[2:17:17] you're willing to go all the way with
[2:17:18] God
[2:17:19] hallelujah if you're willing to go all
[2:17:22] the way if you're willing to die out to
[2:17:24] yourself if you're willing to go through
[2:17:26] the process of death to die to your
[2:17:29] thinking to die to your ways to die to
[2:17:32] what you think and what you want to die
[2:17:35] to what you feel to die to what this one
[2:17:38] say to die to what that one said if
[2:17:41] you're willing to go through this
[2:17:42] process with me I'll make it worth your
[2:17:44] while oh hallelujah hallelujah you're
[2:17:46] going to get what you asked for you can
[2:17:49] have whatever you ask for this was
[2:17:51] Elijah's promise if he was willing to go
[2:17:54] the distance if he was willing to go the
[2:17:56] mile if he was willing to go the journey
[2:17:59] he could have whatever he asked for and
[2:18:01] tonight God is asking oh Hallelujah
[2:18:04] thing tonight death is a hard thing
[2:18:08] death of a corner which people don't
[2:18:10] like to preach death people don't like
[2:18:12] to talk about death but death is
[2:18:14] necessary Paul said I died daily or
[2:18:18] hallelujah it's not good enough for you
[2:18:20] to say you have a word see but you gotta
[2:18:22] commit that word seed to the ground and
[2:18:25] die that word seed has got to go through
[2:18:27] a dying through a process of death you
[2:18:30] got to be stripped of yourself you got
[2:18:33] to forgive the unforgivable you got to
[2:18:35] love the unlovable even when you're
[2:18:38] right and when the person is wrong you
[2:18:41] have to take wrong and tired and say not
[2:18:44] by Will Lord but thy will be done it's
[2:18:47] not right God is asking for a death
[2:18:50] tonight
[2:18:52] a death of a corner wheat unless a
[2:18:55] corner we'd fall into the ground and die
[2:18:57] it abide alone but when it's high oh
[2:19:01] when it died when I go through you can
[2:19:03] play something softly when it go through
[2:19:04] the process of death it begins to bring
[2:19:07] forth much fruit oh hallelujah
[2:19:10] hallelujah it begins to bring forth much
[2:19:11] fruit God wants much food from you God
