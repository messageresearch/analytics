Lord in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen God bless you thank you so much for coming out tonight the weather was bad but we are grateful so I have three portion of scripture I read tonight Isaiah 59 one verse here verse 19 Malachi 3 verse 16-18 and Revelation 138 three scriptures read tonight read in Isaiah 59 19 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him Malachi 3 read in verse 16 then they that fear the lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written written before him for them that fear the lord and that thought upon his name and they shall be mind say the Lord of hosts Hallelujah in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spared his own son that serveth him then shall they return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not our last scripture reading from Revelation 13 verse 8 speaking about the Beast and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world let us pray father we are grateful we are thankful to be under the word Lord the word for the hour the word for this season and time you have elected us to be here for such a time as this and I pray Lord that you would open up our understanding and open up the word to us that we could strike that vein of the upper room and receive Dynamics to the mechanics granted God in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you have a seat hallelujah it's a great thing to be here it's looking forward to be here and I'm glad to be here tonight I was hoping we didn't have to cancel the service with the um weather but God is good we still some soldiers here marching on Amen praise God okay so I have a title get ready to be positionally placed Hallelujah that's the title get ready to be positionally pleased have a subject to know who God is who you are and who the devil is and I have inspiration return and discern oh praise God return and deserve let's go as Daniel heard the seven Thunders and forbidden and John heard the voices and this book was sealed and the back of the book was sealed with Seven Seals but in the days of these seals to be open the mystery of God would be finished in other words so in other words he said the mystery of God will be finished and then he is interpreting it in other words God would be known to his church yes sir do you get that God would be known to his church not in three people but as one person the mystery of God would be revealed and when that was completely revealed he's still on the Revelation line now mysty of God been revealed and when that was completely revealed then the the seven Mysteries would open to the church so he's talking about the seven Mysteries which is seven Thunders okay and when that was completely revealed then the seven Mysteries will be open to the church because in dear the church would be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and that's why he talk about divinely reveal mystery truths not just divinely reveal and then he said then the church should be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him moving in and out showing his signs of being alive and among us living among us and we are then worshiping the living Christ that's Among Us so the promise is to have that super anointing that presence that person that being the angel right Among Us Oh Glory to God so you're no longer coming to church as a church just going to Fellowship in him you're going into an atmosphere you're going into a worship you're going into a spirit atmosphere when he can move in and out and then you know is the living Christ what did Brother Bram say after discernment he said you know what I'm waiting on is the angel I'm waiting on him all of a sudden he he is here that he is here we talking about that he have to be here oh give the Lord a praise glory to God you know we say where the twos and trees that gather he's the midst we could say in the midst of us two that's the word but we not talking about that just saying where the TOs and trees are gathered he in the midst and by faith you know he's in the midst we not talking about that we talking about what the prophet had there when he said he is here now he was with the prophet preaching the word the word is God he was there with the word he was there with the Revelation but when he come to the manifestation he is here is a different thing altogether he is here means I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God because he is here not a devil move till I say so oh give the Lord some Praises do you understand what he is here we talking about now that over he is here that's the promise to be God what we made known to his church Oh Glory to God not just by the word but by the spirit and power God will be made known to the church making known is not only by Revelation the word written making known is also by manifestation oh give the Lord some Praises people keep emphasizing making known as making Mysteries known Revelations known thoughts known words known but God reveal himself in different ways by Nature by word by Power by presence is different ways he reveal himself but this he's talking about him moving Among Us not some Deacon not some Elder not some Pastor no him moving In and Out Among Us and then we are worshiping the living Christ oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God you believe that Hallelujah so what's this mystery of God to be revealed in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he ha declared what all this is about three things you got to know who God is oh praise God are you with me God sends a guide and God wants you to remember that his appointed guide we must remember him here it says Jesus said I will not leave you I'll pray the father he will send you another comforter and this comforter there's a slight Echo up here and this comforter when he was to come was to guide us to all truth and the word of God is the truth and the word is Christ I am the way the truth and the life he is the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us then if we follow the real true guide the Holy Spirit he was to tell us what he had seen what what he had heard and what he to show us things that is to come so the guide would show what was what is and which is to come there you are he's going to show you things to come and when the churches today reject that how can we ever expect to go to heaven when the Holy Spirit was sent to us for a guide who the Holy Spirit and we take some Cardinal some Bishop some general overseer or somebody like that to guide us when the Holy Spirit was given to us to guide us but it take a man to interpret what the prophet say and that becomes their guide they don't believe the message they believe the man Oh Glory they believe the prophet you know they believe the man behind the pulpit interpreting to them what the prophet say and they have eyes and ears like everybody else to read what the book say and the only way those disciples could said uh we have found them who say they Apostles and are not found them to be Liars the only way they could know that they know what Paul taught and because they know what Paul taught they got have watch them guys in the eyes and say you a liar because you're not saying what what Paul said Oh Glory to God do you believe that now and we coming right back to that if they can't say what the tape say or what the Paul said or what the prophet said they are liars because this is the original word oh give the Lord some Praises now watch this now and the Holy Spirit will always speaks of the word I've got many things to tell you you cannot understand it now but when he comes he will guide you to it then the prophet broke in that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seven seal not the beginning at the finishing of the seven seal what the mystery of God should be finished to know who God Is Right what he is how he lives his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up there by that time and he point up the pyramid up to brotherly kindness so in other words all these seals and Mysteries is not for information purposes Daniel said knowledge shall increase it's not for us to know information long time when you have encyclopedia you might one family in the whole village might have enyclopedia you want to know something you had to go and tell them and spin pages and to Mr Google and Mrs Google take over just punch it in the computer and then all the information come here well now you have YouTube you have every in you could make learn how to make a bum learn how to cook anything you want to do you can find it on the internet because knowledge shall increase and knowledge is total knowledge here now and as man release total knowledge God come with a prophet to release total knowledge oh glory to God but knowledge as information knowledge as Revelation and knowledge to come to the place to know who God is is so the knowledge is not just for information purposes the knowledge is to bring us to Revelation to know who God is and if you know who God is you'll behave yourself if you know who God is you will know he is Holy oh praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God GL Hallelujah his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up there by that time see and bring us into the full stature of Sons and Daughters of God a church that is washed in the the blood of Christ that's bought without money is paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ praise God so who God is who you are and who the devil is isn't that right so we know we have to be born again going into a place of triy add Seven Virtues and then adopted and then being positionally place isn't that right so therefore the opening of the word is to reveal who God is think about it God was unveiled to the prophet but God had to be unveiled by the word he couldn't let us come by Pentecostal and and get back in spirit Spirit Spirit without the word because the word is God and the word come to produce character and the word come to form us into the word image the Pentecostal did not have the word image because they were in the womb so they didn't come for the tongues and gifts and so on so when the prophet came he came to bring the word now so God going to use the word in the bride not you the word in you not you the pyramid is in you because he come to build another house in you oh give the Lord a shout in the house in the Pentecost he used men he used Flesh and Blood he used gifted men but the person of the word was not there because the word come to the prophet and the prophet messeng did not yet come so God couldn't send real latain because the seed was not yet there in the ground Oh Glory to God but a shame could you give me something more here so watch this here now son of man Jesus Christ he was the S of the seed then Seven Ages Son of God Seven voices and then the prophecy was in the day of the son of man reveal so them seven voices of Son of God was gathered up and bring back into son of man oh glory to God a God send Prophet failing the son of man the S himself so what the prophet unveil was the so and the so come back the original seed to bring back original bread so that's why I'm Alpha and Omega seven voices gathered up Son of God come back son and Mory into son of man Oh Glory to to bring back seed to bring back Son of God again back into a bride seven voices seven spirits seven Thunders oh give the Lord a shout in the house oh give the Lord a shout in the house is who God is he's them seven spirits yes sir Oh Glory to God is is not right hallelujah hallelujah so I believe that's as the prophet said when the church finds his brotherly love when the church finds his Hool andc when the church Finds Its place in Christ it is three stages and three steps that we have to get to place in Christ Place in Christ is the destination the journey is to place in Christ the preparation is to getting a place in Christ before you even hit Rapture you have to get your place in Christ because to overcome going down the road now you have to know who God is you have to know who you are and you must know who that devil is which is the Rel religious spirits that fighting the bright spirit in the church oh give the Lord a shout is no man with no fork and no horn is religious Spirits coming against that prde oh give the Lord a shout do you see it now so three things have to involve before we could be placed positionally to know who God is that's what the word come to do unveil for for you to know who God is hallelujah God is not church people think think God is Pentecostal Baptist Methodist and today people believe people believe God is Tabernacles and and assemblies and so on God is not that you know that church God is the word oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah so the people that know their God yes sir or let's rephrase it the people who know who God is shall do great ex exploits Oh Glory to God so to know who God is that's not enough you have to know who you are yes sir Hallelujah and then you can have faith to do great exploits and if you know who God is and who you are you still need to know who the devil is because the devil come to destroy to track you to try to get you off the word oh my and remember and we read this I want to read it again Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts and the Book of Revelation reveals that the Antichrist Christ Spirit would come into the church this message amen and defile it and make it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works isn't that right then he went on to say if the people that's you bride get a true revelation of the true churchu a revelation of it yes sir and what she is one two what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if you get if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church are we preaching it recently and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her if we don't discern Satan going to have his way we have to discern and withstand Oh Glory there so there's going to be a people that going to return and discern Oh Glory to God when God unlock your understanding and God open up the scriptures you're going return and discern and then you're going to get yourself in motion and understand it's not flesh and blood you're fighting against it's principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness trying to hinder you from coming into your place and position Oh Glory to God and going shake them Devils off and push them when it's supposed to belong amen praise God so Luke 24 amen God Jesus open the understanding to the scriptures he opened the word to them so he opened the seals I'll say this way of the Old Testament and give them a revelation of what their promises are in order to tell them go in the upper room so they had a clear understanding of who God is and who they are and what was promised and who the devil is isn't that right so Jesus unveiled the entire word to them they knew the word of God and that's why Peter when he Ste up from the upper room he said these people not drunk but this is that that the prophet Joel spake of in other words he was able to identify the Fulfillment of Prophecy Oh Glory to God he wasn't just saying we bringing a thought and bringing our inspiration he said this is that that the prophet spoke of and we going to come back to that same spot that identify this year is what the prophet William brandham spake of this is that oh glory to and if we don't have that yet we keep in this Oh Glory to God we keep in this prophecy we keep in Dynamics in the form of the spirit of Prophecy to prophesy again and tonight we're doing the same thing oh glory to God Get Ready Get Ready Get ready you are going to be positionally placed there enough devils in hell to stop that positional placing it will start with the ministry and will go to everybody else in position you want that place you're going to get that place in Christ Oh Glory to God so before the spirit fell on them they had that a revelation by the punch Oh Glory to God he didn't just run them into the upper room he took them into a room and break the word and break the seals and break and open the understanding so there wasn't in the upper room with understanding there was in the upper room with Revelation oh give the Lord some Praises without understanding they were sad they were D out Jesus died Jesus gone and he had to rebuke them all fools and slow of heart but when the Revelation hit them with joy he was leaving and they said bye-bye we know where we come from we know who we are we know who God is praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord do you get it tonight do you get it tonight when Jesus finished with them they wasn't looking to Jesus no more you didn't get me this is Messiah this is son of man this is Jesus resurrected and Jesus going and they're not sad they're not saying do go praise God praise God they're not saying do go they're saying bye-bye Jesus Hallelujah and they returned to Jerusalem with what with not Joy with what great joy they happy Oh Glory to God they happy they happy because they know what's coming they happy because they know they about to be positionally placed Peter was about to be positionally placed as the spokesman oh praise the Lord oh this is much better Peter was about to be placed as a spokesman so they were happy Oh Glory they they returned to Jerusalem with great joy and they were praising and blessing God when they feel like when they on top the mountain know they continually because they had no religious spirits on them oh glory to God when you have religious spirits on you you can't praise God you have to repent of them Spirits you have to get rid of them Spirits them Spirits say message long time saying amen the same way croing the same way carry on the same way for years when you repented them spirits and you ready come to be who you are Oh Glory to God God love love authenticity sir authent authenticity real deal that said Jacob I love Jacob was a trickster and everything God loved the man man sinc trick he Tri tricks the behavior the man sincere and go I love that because he have a heart for the birthright he have a heart for the Holy Ghost you have a heart for Revival you have a heart for breakthrough the man do all kind of crazy stuff but he love God he want to breakthrough and he only know his need when he had to go and meet his brother brother dread as ever oh praise God praise God praise God hallelujah do you believe that tonight so have got to know who you are isn't that right he this now and Satan my God makes it appealing sin is appealing and the enemy keeps finding to get a better bait he will trip a little more don't worry he will never make a completely naked but he be horrible s Satan keeps bringing sin in and that was the original sin but God doesn't have to do anything more to his to make it more appealing the only thing he has has to do is raise a standard of his own word against the enemy and the Bible said when the enemy come like a flood the spirit of God raised the standard against it and we read that scripture tonight here how the prophet interpretting it now what does he do he makes the word that he already said more positive you see the time is not yet the vision is long we have to wait but God raising a standing in your life by taking the same word you're hear in all these years and making it more positive Oh Glory to God thank you Lord Jesus oh give the Lord some Praises it's not like we a reached anywhere yet no we waiting on the promise we waiting on a promise well brother to you acting like if we reach nowh and you know where we are Wai on the promise waiting on the promise who reach let them Reach but I am waiting because God promised the Holy Ghost he promised Dynamics in the mechanics he promised Revival he promised these things things Hallelujah so let's read it again God doesn't have anything more to do to his to make it more appealing the only thing he has to do is just raise up a standard of his own word against the enemy and when the Bible said when the enemy come like a flood the spirit of God raises a standard against it what does he do he makes the word that he already said so I don't how to try to create no Revelation that you never hear before and your ears tingling tingling from more that we not coming with that the spirit the bride and the prophet says the same thing and what they say would have already been said in the word Oh Glory to God so this what prophet now God know what he said through the prophet so he taking the same what the prophet said and make it more positive is things we heard before I'm not preaching nothing in you you know it's the same message you know same message oh praise God praise God brother Bram from rising his son he said you if your spirit that's in you is reckoned dead and you Anointed with the life that was in Christ is upon you Romans 11 says if that spirit that raised up Christ from the dead Powers same he said now then that same Powers then the same beneficiaries that he had here on Earth from God he redeem you we redeem you a seed that was for known by God whose name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world amen and that the Gospel Light of this Resurrection the confirmation of the word how did we know he was the Christ because he proved what he talked about Sir How will I know the message of the hour God proves what he promised sir he talks about it that is identification and we are beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proves what he talks about what he promised to do in Christ he proved it on the resurrection what he promised to do in Moses he proved it what he promised in the days of Enoch he proved it in all the days of the Apostle he proved it now in this day he proves what he said because they are part of that seed that was represented on the book of life that he came to redeem back to God again yes sir what a message so you are seed that was represented on the book of life that he come to redeem oh praise God hallelujah glory to God and the son has got to be revealed again in the bride in the last days the quicking power has got to come yes it can't be letter only it can't be message only it can't be teaching only he said the quickening power has got to come to Quicken them out of these dead denominations we say dead Tabernacles we say dead churches we say dead groups in the message to Quicken them a power have to come to Quicken them out of these dead denominations and Creeds to a living world word of the Living Word God sir but said listen I'm trying to show you the quickening power wasn't only in their soul it was all over them so when they got the holy ghost in the upper room that wasn't a Pentecost 96 birth you know they got the token they got the person hallu they got the equ power they got the entire life they got the SE germ amen the quickening power wasn't only in their soul it was all over them not only the Dynamics come into Quicken but it quickened the mechanics which was their physical body it's only because the Rapture wasn't then that they didn't they gone you know but they had the quicking power all over them you know understand that when Elijah bone was in the grave and they dropped the dead man there the quick power was still on the bones you know the man got back to life you know this is a quicking power we talking about here you know that has bring the dead back to life you know that quicking power that was Elijah bones could be on your physical body Oh Glory that quicking power over your conscience your imagination your memory your affection your reasoning there will think No Evil Hear no evil speak no evil it'll be all over you on the inside and the outside Oh Glory to C and your physical body in between you talk

resurrection of Christ until when they lay hands they were so quicking with the quicking power when they lay hands upon their sick they got well it will Quicken your mortal body listen didn't you have to pray you know they just lay hands on the sick Oh Glory to God they just lay hands on the sick and they recover because the quicking power was in their hands it was in their foot it was in their heart that quicking power translated Phillip Oh Glory the god to the courage of that that that that African Hallelujah Oh Glory Ethiopian un know oh glory to God that quick power don't need no taxi

like a remember say have a they said come to M he said want whatever Spirit upon him had G SE G he's but not going to m m where the man of the when they bring him so the G disappears I don't know where that g come from I me man that G but but but but you had to bring it to be test so every claim had to be tested all right let's let's continue now now i' like to draw for a moment here is God God is the Eternal there's no one but him God he had attributes and this here represents the word the word of God which has made flesh and dwell Among Us in the person of Jesus now this is called the woman of the wells he's joined this is the priest Pharisee and here you see a open Blackboard means Grace and salvation now in the beginning was the word the word has made flesh and dwell among us three stages it was the attribute first was in God he Tau of himself as being human and that transmit him down to be Jesus now if you ever be dear you will what's going to be within him then for there's only one for eternal life that's God and you are to be part of God at the beginning not what you just chose down here he chose you he say oh all that the father has given me will come now look at this priest here we find his bottom part his back life his predestination back there is sinful here is held down here and this part in here that looks like the black board that represent his Purity he was a priest he was an honorable man so that is his front side that represented this he was a good man because you couldn't be a priest a bad man a bandit a rough dog guy in know be priest you see how it got it intellectual learning now this woman her first life up here she was a prostitute she was all mad up but way down in her I know when the Messiah cometh you see notice when Jesus came and manifested the word because the word discerned the torch that was in the heart St John 4:12 what happened the priest with only intellectual learning it's the devil because that's what his denomination called it what did it do he had no representation so it blacked out but this little woman had nothing to present she was filthy and dirty as she could be but notice way down in her she got representation so we Oh Glory to God so she had representation by predestination do you understand that now the priest on Earth your jacket and tie looking nice and breaking scripture and breaking the bread and everything else but back life no representation he doesn't have the predestination the woman she's back in front filthy but she have representation Oh Glory to God do you see that now hallelujah hallelujah brother Bram question and answers here this now if we were saved before the foundation of of the world were we and later on were we Spirits then and he's breaking it up now yes sir Revelation 13:8 as the scripture read and you were saved and your name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the world was ever created and he quote Ephesians 1 that we we are blessing Spirit of blessing Heaven of Christ according as they has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and blame without him having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself now in the Book of Revelation I got here 38 all that dwell on the earth whose names uh shall not are not written shall worship the Beast right next part of the question were we Spirits then no he this part we were nothing then but in God's mind we were and he spoke it amen and it materialized hallah Jesus was slain how many knows that the Bible is he was slain Christ was the lamb slain before the found of the world why God spoke it and when he spoke it it was good as finished when he saw me when he saw you before the foundation of the world we were only figurative in his mind then when we come to the world we were both man and woman male and female and he separated the feminine Spirit from the man and made a woman out of it and left the masculine spirit in a man so when you see a woman acting like a man something is wrong when you see a man acting like a I want something is wrong isn't that right but before the foundation of the world our names when the lamb was slain our names were put on the book when in God's own mind he foresaw us and predestinated Us by his for knowledge before the foundation of the world oh brother if that would make the church get up and run through the a think of it you are born again before the foundation of the world God put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life this is who you are you know this is connecting back who you are you know because Satan only come in the beginning but this identify you were before the beginning so you was before the devil was created you was before Lucifer before Satan before the world was formed you was in is thinking Glory Hallelujah so before the found of the world now this is real you know yes sir they not a subjective thought like a lecture or a University degree thing you God put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and Christ died and sent the Holy Ghost here to call you to eat in the life you receive it he sealed you you are here till the day of your Redemption you talk about holding on it isn't do I hold on did he hold on it isn't what I done it's what he has done it isn't I quit smoking I quit lying I quit stealing is he died for me he took my spirit out of me and converted me into a new creature oh give the Lord some Praises Glory Hallelujah glory to God H so you're referring to that same scripture Revelation 13 okay the devil deceive all shout out all all except those who names in the book think of it before Jesus was born 4,000 years before he came on the earth several thousand years before you come on the earth Jesus and God man died for the sins of the world but the book of life was made and your name was put on that book of life before the foundation of the world he said that is Bible truth your name was ordained of God and placed on the book of life before the found of the world you were there in his attributes you don't remember it because you are just part of his life you are part of God when you become a son and daughter of God oh glory to God notice his attribute then the attribute was first God the thought the attribute all in one without being expressed and then he Express secondarily then he become the word so first the thought then the word then the word become flesh and S John one now in the beginning was the word that is when time began that is when time began but before time before the beginning before the word in the beginning was fun of spirit it was Elohim in the beginning was the Loos but before the Loos was Elohim and Elohim was seven perfect Spirits the Loos was form into a Yony which is a word body which was Jesus Christ in the beginning was the word in the beginning was the Loos and the Loos was Elohim and the Holy Ghost was God and the word became flesh and dwell Among Us isn't that right before it was a word it was an attribute of thought then it was expressed he said now we are getting to where mesic is this mysterious person in the beginning was the word the word was with God his first being was Spirit God Supernatural the the great Eternal second he began to form himself towards flesh in a theophany it's called the word a body then in this state he was when he met Abraham he was called MDC he was in a form of a theophany now we will get to that he revealed himself in this great form of what he claimed he enm morphy himself into his servants and prove himself here he's in the form of a spirit and when he come in the form in more he PA to Abraham and mhe and when Abraham wased from the slau of the king here come mzc now we see the attribute sons of his Spirit that's us hallelujah attribute sons of his Spirit have not yet entered into this word form body but at theophany this body is subject to the word waiting for the earnest change of the body and the difference between him and you as a son he was at the beginning the word and morphe body he came and live in that the person of MDC then we never heard about no more of MDC because he became Jesus Christ Oh Glory to God you know no moreal MDC because MDC became Jesus Christ oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God mzc was a priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypass that because in that form he know all things but you have never been able to know that yet yet at that day you shall know oh give the Lord some Praises you come like Adam like me you become here from attribute to flesh to be tempted the very reason we come on the earth to be tempted Rejoice because you have been forau of God placed on the earth to be tempted bring it on oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God hallelujah you got to know who God is oh and he chose you you got to know who you are a thought Gene of God placed in Flesh on the earth to be tempted praise God praise God are you ready but when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tam could be dissolved we have one already waiting oh give the Lord some Praises l already waiting God in now making it and waiting there oh glory to God we receiving the spirit from that for that body woo glory to God hallelujah we receiving the spirit for that body Oh Glory to because we going into that body it's a body we going into oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we have never become the word we just become fleshman all right not the word now look you will never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning do you see who you are now do you see what God want you to see tonight not just who God is only but who you are you had to be a thought to become the word so when I say get ready to be positionally placed it means get ready for the unfolding revelation of your position because when you begin to see who you are who God is who that devil is is finished Oh Glory to God is finished that's why you have to return and discern discern the two Spirits working in the framework of the Christian Church Oh Glory to God working in your mind working in your life the battle in his inside your mind you did this you did that the accuser of the Brien is cast down forget the accuser the blood speaking in your behalf Oh Glory to God the blood is there for you I plead their case I die for them I pay the price for them that you could go free tonight oh give the Lord a shout in the house right here inside Revelation Glory Glory Glory to God you can't be the word unless you are thought so if you are coming into a position is because you are thought of God who he for you he called who he called he justified Justified as if you never did it as if you never sin how could men born in s shap inity be ever be justified but it is God that justify it oh God I'm getting excited tonight I'm getting a Revival all by myself tonight how could wretched Sinners Like Us ever be justified Oh Glory Oh Glory to God glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God brother Anthony just go to my room and bring phone from me please praise God somebody just come to mind you want to

want to read this for you before going further I was shocked and Confused bewildered as I entered Heaven's Door not by the beauty of it all nor the lights or its Decor but it was the folks in heaven who made me sputter and gasp the thieves the Liars the Sinners the alcoholics and the trash D stood the kid from seventh grade who swiped my lunch money twice next to him was my old neighbor who never said anything nice Bob who I always thought was rotting away in hell was sitting pretty on Cloud9 looking incredibly well I nudg jesus what's the deal would love to hear your take how all these Sinners get up here must have been a mistake why is everyone so quiet so somber give me a clue he said H child he said they are all in shock no one thought they'll be seeing you judge not remember just going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing your garage makes you a car every saint has a past every sinner has a future oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah what brand says when you get to heaven you'll be surprised who's going to be there oh hallelujah how kind of weak struggling people you be surprised judge not just pray for people amen I trust it be a blessing to you oh blessed be the name of the Lord but you see in order to stand Temptation you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin is we have the assignment tempt them temp them them and guess what they will come through you will come through you have to come through because you're going to know who God is you're going to know who you are and you know who that devil is oh the devil can win this one you only come in the beginning but you will before the beginning oh give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah you had to come down here in the flesh to be tempted by sin and if you stand all the father give me will come to me I'll raise them up in the last day you had to be first so you were before Lucifer was created isn't that right now you see come right down the regular line from attribute before the foundation of the world his name is put in the L Book of Life he become the word the theophany that would appear and disappear talking about Jesus and then he become flesh returned back resurrected that same body in a glorified condition but you bypass the theophany become flesh man to be tempted by sin and so on now look when this body receive the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you chose this body in subjection and B say hallelujah he that is born of God does not commit sin there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that's another level you know because right now we living under perfect State perfect standing under the blood when God look down he don't see no sin on you you know you could see all your fail and shortcoming but God don't see that you know amen the blood speak the blood is covering you the promise we have is not only perfect standing but perfect state that state is dynamics that state is a quickening power that state is what going to cover imagination conscious memory affection and reasoning that state will cover your five senses flesh and the five senses in your spirit Oh Glory the perfect State perfect standing perfect man oh glory god hey oh Hallelujah do you understand that that is what a perfect man means charity the bond of perfectness cover you all over now you're walking with love when brother brandham faced the bull and he he say if he had the gun he shoot the bull and God

seven colors of rainbow the bow Act cover the Earth it didn't strike the Earth praise God and all what he was perfect perfect love perfect peace perfect Joy you see who God is all those seven spirits they come out and make up God was Perfection you can't break that the seven spirits was Perfection everything else outside of that has been something has been perverted from that and the only way we could come back to Perfection is to come back to that Perfection which is God so what he saying Elohim seven perfect spirits that is perfection so we have to come back to the Elohim Spirit isn't that right then we come to Perfection then we have eternal life life Without End oh my Hallelujah so it was a theophany of God that went out the human form that didn't have eyes like you see but a better eye didn't have ears like you hear but far more hearing it was a theophany that all this rainbow condescended into a teony Oh Glory to God Elohim wrapped up in the Loos in the beginning was the word the logos and the words was with god with Elohim and the word become and the Loos was God oh glory to God so seven rainbows wrapped up in a tany is that right and all this rainbow condescended into theophany Moses saw it when it passed from The Rock he saw the back part of a man this great Forerunner has gone before us making a way he became come from Spirit the great Fountains of the rainbow of God who had no Beginning No End this ray of light when fought it was a ray of Love next one was red next color follow was blue tress next follow other colors seven perfect colors which is seven spirits of God that went from the great fountain that great Diamond that Jesus spoke of that great Diamond was chipped to reflect those colors God was made flesh and dwell among us and we might reflect his goodness and mercy Among Us by gifts Hallelujah signs and wonders that whole big rainbow had become in a theophany of made in the image like a man yet he wasn't a man he didn't have flesh yet he was at te off Moses said I like to see you God hid him in a rock and when he passed by Moses said it look like the back of a man what come to pass one day Abraham was sitting in the tent when Abraham was setting in the tent we find him out meeting Abraham before that in the order of mzc and then Abraham he had to come back and be born he wasn't born then he was created a body mzc was the king of Salem which is the king of Jerusalem king of Peace Jesus had both mother and father father and mother and a beginning of days and end of life but he was made after the order of mezc no beginning of days or end of life are you ready are you ready tonight Hallelujah he said the reason I do believe that when that bride is called out and elected and set in The Book of Life there will come a song from Heaven that will take such a baptism of the Holy Ghost into that bride it's will take you from the earth so there's a prophecy hanging over you that one day God will take you and set you in the Book of Life get ready to be placed positionally get ready to be set and God go baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire you're going to know who God is you're going to know who you are and you're going to know who that devil is oh give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God praise God glory let me see if I hit home here now my God Corinthians 51 if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved this Earthly Tabernacle we have another one we have bypassed that to come straight from God attribute to flesh to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did but when testing of his word is over then we Tak up this body that will prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is the word that we skipped to come right now here to be tempted and tested and if we come through that there have been no temptation we'll know all things that's the reason Jesus know all things because he was the word before he was flesh then we become the word oh here this bom here now brother stepen here on Earth here we are formed to the word image formed not automatic form go to shape you cut you horn you beat you file you down for oh give the Lord some praises the trial of your faith have form you tting tribulation here come please here we are formed to the word image to be partaker of the word to feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning Oh Glory to God you hear that here we are formed to the word image that's the purpose we here on Earth Oh Glory to to know God to know who we are Oh Glory to God here on the Earth all the testing if you didn't understand that you have to understand that tonight the test is to help form you into the word image because the Rapture is coming for that word image that word image is what going back to Eden it's not your image and likeness it's God's image and likeness let us make man in our image and likeness let that man have dominion and with the restoration of the word come the restoration of the spirit and that bring brings back the image what Adam had before the fall oh give the Lord a shout that same man will come back in Dominion that same man comes back in power Oh Glory to God and All Through the Ages had samples of it Moses speaking Let There Be flies Elijah open up the river Moses open up the river all kind of Miracles and signs and wonders over the time and Elijah call up in a Char of fire the anointing coming upon Elisha open up the Jordan River isn't that right Jesus come Hal Hallelujah multiply bread and fish oh gor all D had Miracles and so on brother brandham come let there be a squirrel let there be a squirrel and he stood there and said what you see manifested temporarily will be manifested in his fullness it means a more to come other Sons coming he said oh God help me live to see it oh and a manifestation of the sons of God when they could tell a brother the crop is drying and dying no son he said I send you rain in the name of Jesus Christ oh God he said there is a manifestation oh I and your oh in the name of Jesus Christ oh give the Lord I shout in the house Hallelujah missing limbs going to be restored glory to go lost one kidney I give you back a kidney Oh Glory to God let your leg grow right out oh hallelujah praise God you lose your eyes look back take take back your eyes hallelujah hallelujah creative power back in the sons of God again my God my God here we are formed to the word image to be partaker of the word to feed us on the word by being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey many of you can remember it you join a church join a church try this nothing satisfy but when day you recognize it therefore the theophany if you died and enter into that theophany what happens that theophany comes to Earth to pick up your redeemed body and if you hear in the air you take up your body to meet your theophany anywhere you're going oh those that are alive and remain shall not hinder them who are asleep Oh Glory to God if they G on before brother bam and all the others who go on before have to come back and pick up their redeemed body oh GL and we pick up the offering in the air Oh Glory to God hallelujah there's going to be a meeting in the air hallelujah oh my so brother bam says now we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives in Journey and death and where we go after we die predestination is in plain view now the n natural birth is in tree water blood spirit oh Hallelujah so God vindicates that God Vindicated to be true the predestinated is the only one that is considered in Redemption did you get it he said let me say it again the predestinated is the only one that is considered Redemption people might be making like and think they are but the real Redemption is those that are predestinated because the word redeem is to bring back to redeem anything is to bring it back to its original place so when you say positionally place is the place you had before and you're finding back your position because God bringing back to your original place oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God praise God praise God being Eternal with him almost done the eternal life that you had you thought of what you was he wanted you he wanted me to stand in the Pulpit he wanted you in that seat set tonight then we are serving his eternal purpose one that left home only one come to Earth to serve his purpose is that right and after it's finished it's brought back in a glorified State it's matured oh praise God hallelujah glory to God so God forew us that is for knowledge then God elected us and then God predestinated us and then God have a Destiny for us isn't that right right so God for knowledge praise God determines the election oh and the election of God Must Stand isn't that right and election look back to for knowledge when I look back to where I am I know God forau of me and God forew me isn't that right and then God predestinated me to a destiny it predetermined where you're going to go predeter predetermined that you will be filled with the Holy Ghost that you're going to be adopted isn't that right oh and you are predestinated to be a perfect man on the earth don't let no devil tell you otherwise you're not predestinated to be a message believer you're predestin to be a perfect man on the earth oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah now this book of life is in two parts isn't that right every life is in the book of life but there a section in that book called the Lamb's Book that's the blood section that's where your name is at not the regular section oh I don't have the time where he transfer your name from the or from the live section into the elected section Oh Glory to God my my my almost done here final quote the Bible said we predestin be sons of God right God slay the lamb in his own thinking before the found of the world to prove out his attributes when the lamb was slain we were slain with it when the blood of the Lamb was caught up in his own mind back there before the foundation of the world mine and your name were written on the book then that what reading again when the blood of the Lamb was caught up in his own mind before the foundation of the world mine and
