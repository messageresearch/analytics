here and what you do have to realize that God want you to come to that maturity where you ever see a fit plant with suckers in it and this fig Bambi gonna grow I will suck us there right and then the sick Pig come and be and it cut them that one is stuck at a spring up it's already our replacement already that's just how nature is your life come and move on and go give you a time slot for you to do your do when you're better don't miss it now you want to know your do your do you have no trying to jealous anybody you have no time to be envious anybody you are not trying to butter and trouble with anybody you want to know what God wants you to do and as long as you fulfill God's will and purpose you can be happy you could be glad you could be have comfort in your spirit peace in your soul amen this is what you want to know you're fulfilling God's program for your life hallelujah when when you get a nap Channel a fulfilling world prevalent there isn't enough Devils in hell to cancel or stop that purpose Amen now if you haven't listened to Wednesday night service please go and listen to it every service is important if you're miss it you have to listen to it we can't be going over all the thing all the time all the time you have to move outward but you have to listen to what is being spoken hallo God believe God is speaking to us amen a setter that I'm gonna be moving in total intent into the attack mode the launch out as to what the deal with what the enemy is he's not just knowing what you have to do good and what you have to do right you have to also know what you're not supposed to do what you just stopped doing oh praise the name of the Lord amen so before but I succumb and bring the word I want to read a scripture I want to read a scripture from Acts chapter 8 if you want to go play Bibles it could be seated and I want to read we read this some time ago but Philip went on the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them I want to go a little further then Philip this acts tough to eat we didn't verse 5 then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them and the people with one Accord give heed unto those things which shall have speak hearing and seeing the miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying with Lord voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with pulses and they were lame were healed and there was great joy in the city but there was a certain man called Simon which before time in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of Samaria given out that himself was some great one so he didn't wait for people to say he's great he was given out about himself how great he was to whom they all give heed that mean to listen to this dude from the least the greatest that means the top in government the lowest everybody taken on this man called Simon because he's a sorcerer so he's demonstrating demonic powers ok and but when they Philips preach him the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women then Simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued Philip and wondered behold in the miracles and signs which were done so this was Simon's attraction he believed and his eye and miracles and the power of God that is working with Philip let's continue now when the Apostles which were Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the Word of God they sent unto them Peter and John who when they come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost listen to his ways though for as yet he which is the Holy Ghost was fallen upon none of them only D were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so I specifically want identify the scripture to show you that it was a direct experience that they had to receive the people there was no need baptized in water the Holy Ghost had not yet fallen on them okay then watch they lay their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost this same Holy Ghost people didn't know about the receiver here now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given he offered them money now this is Simon who supposed to be the former sorcerer before my witch doctor before must see me demon when he see the Holy Ghost fallen by the leonov ants he offered them money listen saying give me also this power you see wonder in this poor morning he want to remain the man of the hour be the change over man what whatever post one would give me of this power that on whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghost but Peter said unto Him thy money because thou has thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money there was neither part nor lot in this matter for the Hat is not right in the sight of God this is a person I believe there's a person that baptized this the person that is following whose heart is not right Peter said repent therefore for this thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps the thought of thine hat be forgiven thee for I perceive that door what in the gall of bitterness and then the bond of iniquity then answered Simon and said pray for e to the Lord for me that none of these things which are spoken upon me upon me praise the name of the Lord so I just brought bring that the attention to show you the power of the early church on how the witness of the Holy Ghost was so powerful that characters and and what you call is here boy sneaking away : again it ever sending them sending them to infiltrate the move of God Satan himself because I want to show you that this Satan this kingdom of the devil is have a power structure it have a system in it it have a tax initiative butternut and we and you cannot be ignorant of the devices of the devil and the Prophet taught us is not how only have demons in the physical realm like cancer and tumor are all kind of sickness and condition without demons and his spiritual realm these are the religious spirits upon people that make them come to church and still and conditions and so on demons Devils yes hallelujah sure we'll be hearing a lot from me along these lines because we couldn't are some demons Oh when I say amana big we no jelly because Jesus said in my name they shall cast out devils hallelu not believers are no Devils Devils unbelievers Devils in your life yes yes demon activity that along your life hallelujah have to go so don't don't hold back the Amen oh yeah Lisa had a toast of mmm and listen press this way to get delivered and you have to want to get delivered yes yes yes you have to want to get delivered go chlorine ago deliverance has come Oh give the Lord a shout deliverance - your life has come all what you all can overcome you could overcome it all the way it would inevitably she's gonna get a bridge you all the complexes in your mind boggle undo all and complex's hallelujah so I want to read something that we have here where mom says this we believe that you receive the Holy Ghost by an experience not by a mythical intellectual conception of the Scriptures but by an experience that you alone know now if you want to know whether it was the Holy Ghost watch how your life patterns after that it will tell what kind of spirit coming to you or glory to God so we believe that we receive the Holy Ghost by an experience and you must want it Oh glory to God you must you must want it and he said blessed the day the hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled all glory that God and His lash eMac was remember it is absolutely essential and necessary and compelling and compulsory that you receive the Holy Ghost or glory that God is a Holy Ghost to receive don't let no preacher preach you out of it talk you out of it don't let nobody talk in your head out of it there is a Holy Ghost to receive there's a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost take your and dip it in the spirit when you come out there you're drunk or maybe anointed you might be speaking in tongues but every devil could be fired out of your soul I don't tell your my know their heart or glory to God you might be seated praise God I feel the spirit moving he said you are born in sin and ship iniquity in your heart of a snake you're born with that snake inside a deer or glory I sneak in your heart of unbelief inside a deer you get baptized the snake is still there they say Amen to the world is thickest in their water and moving that snake they take a fire that is like John said there's one standing among you even to baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire that fire is the bundle snake out that fire is the take out the desire to do wrong Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God you may be seated listen we don't have to stop drinking and stop smoking or glory now but when that fire come it takes out the desire to smoke the desire that tree the desire to run a woman the desire to keep the desire to light the fire does that or glory of God why attain God shed water

good and acceptable and perfect will of God I just want to read those two this is one more time again I beseech you therefore PC Chester is a cry it's almost a plea he's pleading I beseech you he's making a kiss I beseech you brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice so it means that that your very war is a sacrifice go into work it's a sacrifice coming to church it's a sacrifice is not just a sacrifice on Sunday morning or when you among brethren it's a living it's a continual sacrifice you're you're lying becomes a walking sacrifice incense is rising from your life when you wake up in the morning it's a sacrifice be for you go to bed at night is a sacrifice when you waiting for the maxi it's a sacrifice when you start your car it's a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service it's not an exceptional service it's not going above and beyond it's a reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that he may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning certainly great to be in the house of the Lord this morning and we have been having quite a time the last few weeks you appreciate but over it he has been preaching every service and he seems just as strong as when he started out huh hey man so we thank God for that and he's been on a truck for some time speaking about the restored feet and speaking about the feet and he was kneeling on her feet in a couple of weeks ago he said like a switch and he started to connect the feet to the Holy Ghost so he didn't know what I had so to him I had a thought and my title this morning is the restored feet unlocked the fullness of the transforming power the restored faith unlocks the fullness of the transforming power and a subject change from glory to glory and an inspiration and inspiration the transforming power is the Holy Ghost can the church say man you believe that this morning Amen now the word transform and by the Branham it was on September the 11th 1965 he preached on transformation then October 31st so this is in the closing chapters of parables ministry he preached God's power to transform and the power transformation in September and October of 1965 and in there he also pulled the definition of it because when I said I look at it sometimes you just hear it Church transformation the power to transform or when you dig down into the definition of it it gives you a whole different perspective on it so the transform means the change in composition or structure so if the composition change that's something the structure can also change it means a change the outward form or appearance it means a change in character or condition can the church say man it's us it's the subject of mathematical transformation it's the cause a cell to undergo genetic transformation so when we talk about God's power to transform the transformation can either be in composition it could be in structure it could be an outward form or it could be an appearance it could be in character or it could be in condition it could be mathematical or it could be genetic somebody preached back to me this morning so I started a core to the scriptures and I looked at how Jesus did a mathematical transformation but it's even tough to correct me I'm not a mathematician but in my simple mathematical understanding it's a five loaves and two fishes and it was the power of transformation that took the five loaves and two fishes and the match did not make sense because he had five thousand people and there were twelve baskets remaining if that's not a power transformation I don't know what is somebody preached back to me this morning Jesus found himself in a wedding and they ran out of wine they brought water to him he said Jesus will run out of wine he said bring some water before he even said that he said what is how is this my problem I'm just a guest in the wedding but if you ask the power of transformation to change the situation because the condition needed to be changed it's a change of condition there was a condition that presented itself they ran out of wine somebody helped me this morning so the condition another kind of transformation he said bring some water and when the Branum said that eventually that water would have met grapes and those grapes would have been fermented and those fermented grapes would have spended I am fermenting and then it'll be put in a wine jar and eventually would have ended up maybe in the wedding somewhere but Jesus bypassed the process because he was the god of transformation can the church say Amen hallelujah anybody with me this morning I just wanna encourage your feet this morning that transformation is coming your way it could be in composition it could be in structure it could be an outward form it could be an appearance God Himself transform himself from caught above us so God with us and he transformed himself God and morphe its transformation to God in us so when Jesus second little stroll didn't realize it was the same God who said let it be he's a code of transformation and the church cement and there's a promise to you and to me that we can access this power transformation not just a transformed composition or appearance but the fullness of the power transformation the fullness of the transforming power when the church Haman you may be seated [Music] transformation it means change it is unfortunate that many people come to church and they don't change let me rephrase that they are changing but not for the positive because when the Branham taught us that whenever you come to church you either get better or you get worse but a change has taken place and you have to realize that your mind has to change the Bible says be not conformed to this world conform is not transformed but a Branham said that the devil t-phones so this is you erroneous word form as a delicate issue because there are people who are being deformed their choices deform them their decisions deform them because the devil is the master of deformation the world handles conformation but Jesus is about transformation somebody reached back to me this morning you see conform and deform don't introduce a new element this is conforming when I move something it's conforming to my wishes of what I wanted to be but transformation is when I could replace this with some new elements what I can introduce a new element so where the random said you'll pick up a dirty glass he said you wash the glass you see they pour milk in the glass when he is a new elementary thing it's a whole different story can the church say man so God is interested in change he's interested in transformation he's interested in change in your walk change in your talk change oh come on somebody help me this morning so when you meet the transforming power your mind can change your heart can change your character to change your purpose could change your mission is supposed to change your motives are supposed to change your objectives are supposed to change your desires are supposed to change your passions are supposed to change your body is supposed to change your thoughts are supposed to change your nature is supposed to change your attitude is supposed to change your motivation is supposed to change your inspiration is supposed to change your burnin is supposed to change your knowledge is supposed to change how you talk to your wife it's supposed to change how you talk to your children it's supposed to change come on now somebody preach back to me God wants to move you from your currency or you'll be forced it into his desired state or your after seat people must be able to watch you and say that's not the same person that's not a person I know they have changed not change for the worse but will you look at you they must see this looks like Jesus this looks like Jesus this looks like Jesus walking like Jesus talking like Jesus come to church say Amen everybody with me this morning you remember what my title is - restored thief unlocked the fullness of the transforming power so we're trying to build to something this morning the Bible says be transformed by the renewing of your mind because before you could have a spiritual transformation check the scripture it starts with a mental transformation and brother Branham speaks of mental feat because he said faith comes by hearing and hearing the word so when God came to Cillian is a key area mighty man of Valor before Gideon could talk about power or understand power God was tryna arrest his thinking because God knew what his thinking was about himself so before God to transform his situation he had to change his thinking he said Gideon a mighty man of Valor and he called out the problem and the problem was Gideon's thinking because he made it evident by saying but I'm in the smallest tribe my family is the smallest family and if you bring the whole family it's a photo shoot and the smallest one in my family you can't be talking about me but Kaur was dealing with his thinking because before your actions could change your thinking after change your actions could never change if your thinking does not change so the preaching of the gospel is to introduce a new way of thinking because what you think becomes your actions and your actions become your habits and your habits become where you reach in life you're happy become your destiny somebody preach back to me let me say that again before you can change your behavior you have to change your thinking because your thinking becomes your actions your actions forms your habit and your habit is your character it's who you are before God could speak whether Adam taught it it was a thought before it become a whit it has to be a thought before it become an action for me to pick this up my brain had to think picking this up before my hand to pick this up when you put your hands up to worship you made a decision that you're gonna lift your hand up to worship every action physical or otherwise that's mental thought somebody preached back to me change your thinking change your action so when somebody doesn't want to worship it's not a physical issue it's a mental issue because they got to think differently if they don't understand how worship plays into spiritual experience you can't get upset with them all we gotta do is help them to understand that if they could think differently or somebody preached back to me he transformed by the renewing of your mind [Applause] you maybe see that can we talk a little bit when you computer get in trouble what do you do you reboot it you reset it because something you do so much things that you might ask they get back to the factory default settings and when every Saturday I wanted a worker punished in some maybe a loose contact information somebody help me this morning because I want to get a phone working again so God says so so so so the words ain't be not conformed but be transformed by rebooting your mind because you might have some corrupt programming some corrupt thinking and the word comes to transform your thinking so as bird always says when the Bible says husband's love your wife it is not as your father loved your mother but it's as Christ loved the church that's a thinking loop you know before that becomes something that you say well I waited for the Holy Ghost are you in video that goes to love your wife that's a mental issue your thinking needs to fix the Babis and as a man thinketh in his heart so is he if he we're dealing with people who can separate the spiritual experience from you making a choice because life is about choice and as Christians we always have a choice but our choices reflect our thinking so when we talk about transformation it has to start with your can the church same and everybody feeling fine so let me say it again your mind has to change your heart has to change your character has to change your purpose has to change your mission has to change your motive has to change your objectives have to change your desires have to change your passions have to change your body has promised a change can the church see going back to Genesis but the venom said in the message God's power to transform he said I'm thinking this morning in Genesis 1 this world was without form and it was void and darkness was upon it nothing but a complete chaos and when this world was in a condition the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and the entire picture was changed from total chaos the Garden of Eden that is transforming power of God that could take anything that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it that could transform in power and the church say man God loves it's his nature by the currents to see chaos and use the transforming power to bring order he can't help himself you know there's some people when they come to your house in might see some and it has fix it because it's in nature they want to see a certain thing in a certain way when they get to their house they said no nobody picked this or twisted it Lisa right good no because they want to see things in a certain order God is a God of order so when the earth existed when when everything existed and there was no order was chaos he had to do something about it you have to look at the chaos and the brother branham said it was a transforming power that was used to turn the chaos into order he said let there be let there be first day second day 13:40 he was bringing order order into the universe order into the stars on the earth and after the 60 he was so pleased there was nothing more to transform somebody preach back to me everything was perfect there was nothing to fix there was that adjust there was nothing to sweep there was nothing to move in place everything was in place everything was in order everything was perfect so court arrest hallelujah the transforming power could take a rest because nothing was out of order and so to the sons of God when you get closer to him you can't stand chaos you want order you want order in your life you want order in your marriage you want order in your family you want order in your workplace because you are son of a God of order and attribute sons exhibit the same type of behaviors like your father somebody's a man or somebody freaks back to me I'm better Pelham taught us that then when Adam was in his place he operated with a sixth sense and that section was fit because the problem friends is not the power the power has always been the problem has never been the power let me say that again the problem has never been the power when people say where's cord where's the miracles when if the problem has never the power the problem has always been the feet to move the power somebody bridge back to me look through history all it takes is somebody for their fleets across a level and they activate power oh I don't even have to co-sign power when faith is activated it could operate independently because it's a principle of God see it's connected to power Oh somebody happy this morning you may be seated this morning oh can I preach a little bit feet and power are correlated they move together the more feet you have the more power you movement as your feet Rises listen it's a sense it's a sixth sense people say well my my eyesight gets better they say if you eat certain things if you eat carrots I don't know how true it is but I'll tell you but I've little bit that if you eat carrots your eyesight gets better so if man is trying to find ways to improve this sense call sight when people what are these signs of not feeling well let's say you lose this before if you have the koulouri flu you say well I don't really taste it right now so your your sense of Tears could be affected when you get to call your sense of smell Kabir they say holy smokes holy food smell it well a customer right now have the call so it means has been a discussion in the use of that particular sense so when man fell there was a destruction in the use of this sense cause it the same width could interact with the world and you can know that this is something man lost the ability because he lost meet the know that there was something else out there that kind of factory around the physical realm the realm of that limited the five senses there was a greater sense somebody brings back to me this morning this sense calls it it's indestructible this sense cause it could affect the other senses or you don't hear me this morning or you don't hear me this morning this is a super sense you may be seated [Applause] this sense where the Clarence is the independent operating sense this sense has a contract with heaven that God Himself leaves to operate on its own can I see that again that sense brother handy could operate on its own quadrille even if they get in falls in the administration of that sense give me an example but the Branham was praying for the sick he's praying for the sick and there's a woman here with crutches she's just watching she says watching watching the prayer watching the healing after a while she just walks up to him and him the crutches he didn't have to pray for her because she activated something that bypass the presence of a prophet on the earth it was what was it it wasn't it you don't hear me this morning you may be seated if that's not even good for you shut down a minute this independent operating sense that could bypass the presence of Suns on the earth Jesus is ministering and they saw little need she has run out of money she has run out of doctors she has run out of friends and family to go to so she tells us she didn't ask a deacon she didn't talk to the elder she didn't get from missing from the pastor she told herself she connected with the Sixth Sense a little bit of it not even much not resource it not originally a little measure of it with a Mensa she told herself if I could just touch the hem of His garment and Jesus didn't even see it coming Jesus standing there may be seated for a minute Jesus ministry and who touched me because I felt verge you / transforming power / dynamics / charity woman the place somebody please back to me so true of the Bible what we have a people who for lack of a better explanation if this is a line that requires faith to operate above to activate power we have these aberrations these exceptions to the rule that broke past the line and in so doing the access power and Jesus LIC if you have faith like a mustard seed you could say to this mountain be moved anybody ever see a mustard seed I'm gonna get some examples of mustard seeds the city quantity of feet that it takes to move mountains I would imagine half of a mustard seed to move half a mountain can the church say Amen because any sense could be strengthened and by the Browns picks up at different levels of it for mental feet intellectual feet he said it starts here even by the bottom said intellectually you're hearing the message the conversion of that is your defeat that the message is supposed to produce it's not producing for you quit still in the intellectual stage because he has to drop to your heart and even feed crops they have their levels of that feet so he give example he said a for lepers or the lepers who are outside the city they say if we stay here we die that's logical playing mathematics if we stay here we die if we go there we die both situations have dead but if we stay here we don't get anything if we gotta be might get something let me go and but I'm gonna call it didn't she fit the lowest levels meeting enough can the church say Amen but we are in the age of not didn't see fit this is the age of the restoration of defeat can the church a man so it means that the power we supposed to access is that different kind of power come the church Haman what answer but I brought him said let me read it in Israel before the brazen serpent is that I truly believe before the church can have the rapture is got to have rapture and feet we can't even have sea for divine healing let alone rapture it got to have a feet that'll change and quicken this body and be taken away I believe there's a church on this road tonight who a power of the Living God that man will speak to will here and there a little flash like lightning and a church is coming out not a psychologist not some of this put on make-believe but a real true genuine anointed holy Eagles called our church and that's why I'm speaking to this mornin can the church say man [Applause] transforming power transforming power it takes feet to move the power that's the problem all along it takes feet to move the power so the feet you have it's connected to the world that's available to you so as the word increases to you so to your faith is supposed to increase so over all of the ages has each messenger it's time the right hand of God is bringing forth the feet supposed to be rising until this great Elisha prophet who came to turn our hats back to the feet he came to tie up all the loose ends he came to restore the fullness of the world because the word restored as the conductor moves the spirit can the church say man I know you've heard it said this way that the word is a conductor whisper but what is the conductor a conductor moves something from one place to another place so the power is there the wood is a conductor of the Spirit so when you have a little bit of the word using a very small conductors who only said the motor power could be transferred when the fullness of the word is here then you can actually move all the power but the word being a conductor is to take the power to please and a transformer also does a level of conversion to transfer the power in that watch even if you plug this camera into the power supply you know what'll happen you blow the camera so something has to be able to connect between the power supply and what needs to be operated can the church say Amen all that God was important to Christ all that Christ was a positive Church so there has to be something about that now could connect you to the power supply that you don't blow a fuse that you don't blow a gasket that you don't blow your engine but the power could be used effectively so god construct something called character [Music] because poet or character will blow a fuse he said it is with powers of clarity satanica do all can accredited but when you have character no he could connect character to the power supply and now you have PO in action power in control because Jesus was power in control he was God himself he could see Lazarus come forth and the church semen somebody reached back to me anybody in the house is spawning no you understand why we can be a Pentecostal Church if it can be any kind of a church because we have a messenger who has to tie up all the loose ends all the mysteries of the scripture all of the mission I was locked up in the Bible that we can see plainly who we are how we are supposed to behave how we are supposed to live how we are supposed to relate to each other how we are supposed to act how we are supposed to worship how we are supposed to look like in the thymus just come to church see man but a Brannon went on and God's power to transform and everything under control to bring four of its kinda remember to bring when he put the seed in the earth the sea can only come forth with the power of life in it to transform it from a sea to a pond or whatever it was his transforming power now God put the seed in here with potentials that it would be what he said it would be and as long look at the condition as it steered in its right category it would be just exactly what God said it would be it had to beat up me because he had made it that way and made a channel that anything that stays in his channel in his line of wood it would have to bring for exactly like his would said it would do it cannot move from there it's channeled exactly right so with everything in the trust of his own son that it would be that with and court said it's all good so I'll just rest so God lead every seat and in every seat was potential and as long as the seed that had potential Steve in his channel it would bring forth the way it was supposed to can the church be man once the apple or the mango seed stealing his computer's channel it will bring forth mango trees every time and Adam had the potential in him to produce sounds by the spoken word that was the potential that was in him Oh Adam I to do was T in the channel all Adam had to do a stay in the channel and it wouldn't fool the way it was supposed to because in the seed has the potential to bring for there is nothing to add to the see the seed has the potential already God is not adding the potential to the seed the word seed has the potential but the personal rapture and faith is laying in the message this seed of this message planted in your soul has the potential for you to be in the rapture this word seed sown by the Son of man has the potential for your complete healing in this seed of this message soon by the Son of man son of men fear in a son of man that's it as all the potential in that scene has seven live voices in that cedar seven thunders and that she does manifestation of the sons of God in that seat has your family in that seat missing limbs will be restored in that seat there's no doubt in that seat is only light in that see there's power in that seat is authority in that seat as concurrent Devils in that seat is putting your foot on the neck on every situation and that series your financial breakthrough and that scene is your passive and son being delivered in that seat everything is laying in that seat [Music] [Applause] [Music] but it only remains potential unless you bring it into the right channel and the right channel is the channel of the word it's not the channel of a church it's not the channel of a group is that the challenge of a Creed it's a channel of the word once you put that seed in the channel of the wood that seat does what it's supposed to do the only time the seed doesn't release the potential is when it's in another channel and that's a problem today people have their own channel just think about it what channel are you tuned into are you chewing into the wood because if it curated the wood then all the potential seek you first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added that's in the seed you know if you put on the right channel the channel of the wood then that sea just begins so your business success that you're fighting up to get is locked up in DC but what channel you're watching because the channel that you watching I wouldn't even cried out look how old are they are being successful he say have you considered the end because I was on a different channel from you you watching there you don't even watch any channel somebody please back to me other people is not your channel other people in church that's not your channel oh come on somebody please back to me what are the church's groups doing that's not your channel your channel is you would it's you and you would watching each other the world watching you and you watch in the world and the more you watch the word and you and the see in the world begin to communicate you lose all these factions you lose all our position you know what a Branham separates in a man could be so surrendered to God that he'd never don't know what to do with him did ever Scout try this I tried that but I managed switch in the channel I tried to get to know what she news but he s when she channel I try to get to the watch trump but he has switched channel he just focus on the word he wants to know what the word says about his family is that I'm watching them he watch in the world I want I don't want to watch them I wanna do other words about my son I want to find everywhere that says my son has to be delivered because if I do that that'll take care of itself cuz somebody help me they're smaller [Applause] [Music] I'll give it a business example many businesses say watch what a competition is doing that has his place but you know the most successful companies say I'd even want is it takes everything is cost enough it takes time to look at the competition so amazon.com for example Jeff Bezos is a wealthiest man in the world right now a trillion dollar company and they said that his focus was on such real endless customer satisfaction that he was they were looking at the competition but in pursuing customer satisfaction the competition got destroyed because he found something you wanted to focus on then I'm doing look at no competition forget it competition focus on being the best product having the best company having the best customer service everything will take care of itself best product yes service best delivery best product best service that's delivery and in doing that the competition is getting lick up lick up left he wasn't really take on the competition keep focus best product that's company that's customers best service and he drilled the company drilled the company and chorus in adoption perfection forget everything else holiness purity revival power see focus it's gonna happen he's never filled he is never disappointed he has never lost a battle steer focus it's gonna happen super Church super ace rise revival young people being delivered and the church say man oh come on now somebody please back to me steer in the right channel and watch every see that is granted come to pass halleluyah halleluyah somebody say men [Applause] it's about your thinking friends when you try to solve your problems you mess up God's plan because he said you can solve any way I can solve it change your mind he said cast all your cares what platter all means some some of the cares you supposed to handle somebody preached back to me he said cast all your kids all all your kids what have you cast on him you take care of it all is a big word what trouble you going through this morning what is your kids just wanna classes up on him he can handle it he could handle it this morning he could handle the problem he could handle the situation [Applause] [Music] somebody give God a shout of praise hallelujah I'm not gonna encourage you this morning because his gospel is a real gospel you may be seated I'm one of a few people wonderfully I am tired of church because church is a means to an end god I put this here to have Church you know he put us here to have power Oh somebody please back to me he put us here to have dominion when God put Adam in even in the galleys hey Adam Sunday morning at 10 o'clock I want to see you know he said Adam have two million if you see that it's molten removed whatever you name your name whatever but because man losses six cents we have to go to this process to reconnect to the sixth sense but when we come back to the sixth sense the unity of the faith knowledge of the Son of God stretch up a perfect man [Applause] I've said it a minister of the faithful is temporary it's until we reconnect the sixth sense you may be seated the sixth sense with a pop well active is my direct line the direct communication that when I speak everything else when I sign angels heaven respect my signature disease come out the doctor go and say let me get approval and if no no no no no never come out demon come out sickness come out Lazarus come forth they have to take note because a son is on the earth and the trance a man many people go to school and the despair of a great teacher is when they see a student with potential wasted I'm sure you've seen it people you know people who have potential family members neighbors disabled this boy bright why he missing school why he not be intelligent you see the potential you see his aptitude you see what he's able to do he or she or whatever it is and life is full of people who have not lived up to their potential but the Branham said it girl don't make halfway Christians God don't make halfway preachers but the Christian can be halfway appreciate to be halfway l-look at me halfway a deacon could be halfway the context of halfway means that there's more there's potential that is unused unfulfilled unrealized so the issue is not potential because there were many people who came that his messages messages power they came in and they were given the potential because the seed was there but because they didn't get into the right channel because a channel is the environment the word has his environment because a word attracts the spirit by default by default you know after propose a spirit the word attracts the Holy Ghost so we need an atmosphere of the word the Holy Ghost just recognizes something about you and him because he's attracted to his word or somebody preached back to me this morning you may be seen it for a minute what have we been taught before 1906 before the Pentecostals on the Wesleyan and the holiness and that dispensation the people was so sanctified by the word that the Holy Ghost wanted to fall they want crying out for the Holy Ghost they were not looking for the Holy Ghost they were not seeking the Holy Ghost but their holy lives what was attracting the Holy Ghost and because the word hadn't opened to them enough the Deacons were instructed whether a man put a bucket of water but Andy put a bucket of water but he'll keep a bucket of water because these sanctify people when they start to attract the Holy Spirit when he see them said to move too much shorter and that's what I did back then before the Azusa Street revival what was it they live such a sanctified life that the devil had to step out and the Holy Ghost could step in until the season change so don't give me no excuses about why you were the position that you're in because you're in the wrong channel it is not God's job to put you in the right channel it is not good job to come into your house and changee station or changing music or come on your phone and oh somebody help me this mornin [Music] that's what you have to do yourself and once you do that he sends his spirit into your living room into your bedroom into your car into your workplace can the church say Amen Oh hallelujah because you're in the channel you're in the channel you wanna get so deep in the channel that you can't come out you wanna get sauced surrounded by the wood you don't know your head from your foot all the sinners would you see yourself in the wood you see the word in you you see the world in your brother you don't see the faults in the brother you see the word in your brother you may be seated can the church say man it's a change of behavior it's a change of attitude is a change of operation when you look at the word made flesh he blows our mind with his action I think back to when Judas is there Jesus knows who Judas is and not once could you find a scripture where he he made us feel bad when the time came for Judas Ogando why do you say and let the devil in this church go and do it no he didn't say that this demon is a demon hear it no no no no he said whatever you do do quickly never I just thought he went to bring something in did you forget something on the donkey outside I know it wasn't easy for the Prophet because the Prophet sees person the people but I said many times and and they say you could not tell his enemies from his friends he would see the spirit upon the people people who shouting people who worship and people who say thank you Jesus and in there is a demon of jealousy demon of envy demon of lust demon of hatred [Music] and he had had the grace and the compassion he exhibited the same thing that Jesus did now the more you in the world you'll behavior will change because it changes your thinking when you see that in the scripture and it becomes a part of who you are then you'll be easier reflects that it is not a putana to the shows that are walking up trying to deal with this but and know something about them I trying to be with it no it becomes the expression it becomes the way you live I said it up to a year to I want to a message on your way but I random lived and show you how the way Jesus lived and to show you how far people who call themselves Christians live because it's not the same we have to be like Jesus we have to see like Jesus and when we begin to get that level of maturity you will have more love and compassion for your brother more love and compassion whenever I'm administering him he would miss it by saying you I know you don't want to be this way but it's a spirit operating upon you so he would deal with his spirit and then see the person go free can the church a man and people come to children all kind of baggage all kind of stuff but when you come into world because the devil cast down the wood he can do no he knows that he believes it but when he started expose him he has a child of friends on my outside so our job is to expose the devil at every one of his tricks and as we expose him he have no room that's why the Bible said in verse said he'll be chained by circumstance what is that chained by suitable son he'd be bound because there'll be no please phone for him in your heart if the devil is looking for some place to live today he's looking for somebody see can I find a place in his heart in heart and if your heart is closed and your hatches closed and your heart is closed then he'd ever cut fire every say listen I gotta find the next business because I have nobody to operate through can the church say man everybody feelin fine could you take some more I haven't even read II started you know I don't recognize I reach me at six just see you have 51 but then tomorrow is kind of about Monday so I wake up this morning early and Karen same a Whitner like that done five o'clock anymore because they're jumpin Isaac but we're they get energy for so nobody tired nobody knows was retired we know starting can the church say Amen we know warming up in them we ought to be the happiest people on the face of e-wallet joy supposed to be coming through your hands your pores yeah you can't wait to come to the house a lot and it can't wait to go to work to go to school to demonstrate this goodness of Jesus upon your life can the church say Amen so what are we talking about the restored feet unlocks the fullness of the transforming power and I'm making a distinction between transforming power and the fullness of it and you know I'm going because it takes a certain faith for the rapture a feat that many trees did never had the feet for the rapture because as a special kind of it give it a special kind of people can the church say Amen so but I balanced it was a transforming power that came to Abraham it Brahmas our old man his wife was an old lady not only were they old and scare in particular was all but she was also barren so she had to get double transformation God change her like a young woman and change her barrenness into a fruitful woman but but her plants it was a transforming power and by the parent said God sends his transforming power to fulfill his would and by the venom of the same God sends the Holy Ghost as the enforcer the back of the wood so will he talk about a transforming power and the Holy Ghost doesn't that a song like the same thing that something has to follow the word to bring it to pass somebody piece back to me and it transformed an old man and an old woman because he promised he would do it and what God promises to do that he'll do there's nothing any perverted thing grab court can do nothing with it but he will keep his word and he is his spirit i the lord have planted it I will water it day and night less some should pluck it from my hands all wandering stars you will desire in your heart you've got to have it or you wouldn't be sitting here this morning and the church say man and you wouldn't be in these churches and order terms of things you are in out across the land if something didn't bring you in here some person spoke to you don't go any further there's a washing of the water by the word that'll make you white as snow Ibrahim believed God and God caught any and caught anything contrary can the church say man what is it it's a transforming power Abraham didn't know how this gonna happen but God said is gonna have a son when I asked around how you're feeling God said I'm going to have a son how you feeling today Rahab God said I'm gonna have a son oh yeah feelings here Abraham go tell Abraham because God and speak to Sarah directly until he came I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah gonna have a son and the church say man and Abraham held on until one day he didn't realize what had happened he looked in the mirror I say wait a minute Abraham you're looking a bit younger than it did yesterday you feel a little bit stronger than you've had last week you ain't just last week what today you're feeling stronger what is it is a transforming power it's a transforming power that's keeping you alive that's keeping me alive we shall not all sleep but the transforming power one of these days we'll turn this gray hair back the transforming power will take this bald head and put here back on it the transforming power if we could make an old man and an old woman young again to have a son what about you and the church here in Abraham steal the bullet of the world was not even reveal but the transforming power can made him young again what about our team when we have the fullness of the world every mysterion feel oh and the church say Oh hallelujah but if I said come back to the word come back to the world yes power in the word the word has power the world if you pit even seven thunders bethe glorious wonderful rapture we are not gonna all sleep but we are gonna be changed and prophesied for me I'm speaking from my house I'm speaking for my family I'm speaking for the backsliders I have paid for the backsliders I ask for the young people who are not even in here what kind of faith the resource heap the original seed that was delivered on the day of Pentecost give the Lord a shout of praise you may be seated hallelujah Abraham was called the father of it but the feet that Abraham was and the feet that Peter had was a different kind of date somebody please back to me the flea that Iran had and the pit that Peter had was a different kind of niche because that was the fear that you referred to the earnestly contend for the fear that was delivered this was a fee that was delivered to them because the word himself had come and because the fullness of the word was there it brought with it a fullness of the faith kind of church amen Oh somebody please back to me this is our revival this is our inspiration the tightness you feel that has a subject itself but the fullness of the transforming power that sickness you feel as a subject itself the fullness of the transforming power your passive son has such as get himself little full of the transforming power [Applause] you may be seated and then already a prophet is trying to hunt and go through what you're looking for he said looking for scre he says speak and just like God in Genesis out of nothing the transforming power just like in Genesis let there be and there was a squirrel the same ago said let there be light that is fullness that is fullness power of creation power of the rapture power of healing all every promise this is the first time since Genesis that God is gonna trust the fullness of his power the fullness of his glory with somebody and the church say man this is our day our time our season I don't know how many people is gonna be but I'm one of them I have fear to believe it I have fear to say it I have to claim it I'm one of them do you know who you are this morning do you know who you are this morning make or change your thinking make or change your thinking because you're thinking determines what you see your thinking each time it's how you act for you to speak it oh come on now somebody say hallelujah but I said come back to the would take that would it'll grow it's got to grow God's transforming power that brought it up in the first place he's just on his road now taking him back again no he's going Rag back again to where it was so God is simply put the province in its transforming power is here putting things in order this transforming power is pulling the pieces of the world together and because you ain't God's thoughts the transforming power came to find you when you go to water transform empowers their situations in your life I being change a you'll even see because a child from empower is under instruction to protect you the transwoman power is under orders to guide you he said I am gonna go but I'm gonna send another comforter he's a transforming power he will guide you he will transform roads for you he led them through the wilderness he transformed the Red Sea by opening it up come on somebody please back to me somebody give God a shout of praise it's a trial you gotta understand what we're seeing this morning that everyone I tell you you did this you did that is he Satan and yes transforming power he changed Jacob to Israel that was a transforming power you may be seated hallelujah you may be seated Moses went ran for his life before he made the transforming power Moses wasn't hiding he had no plans to go back to Egypt he said go away on vacation i'm going to ethiopia I'm going to Samaria I'll go into Jerusalem but Saul sent me to Egypt but one day the transforming power transform himself you hear what I said the transforming power himself transformed himself into a burning bush he could be a cloud he could be a bush he could be whatever he wants to be even when he was speaking at me said when more they say what do I call is he I am tell him I am because I am whatever I want to be I am whatever you need I am whatever situation needs to be resolved I am your shield I reward I am your baccala I am the alpha I am the Omega I am s-shut I am Jehovah Jireh I am that I am I am the transforming power I am the Holy Ghost I am the cook that's what he is that's who he is [Music] [Applause] [Music] can I touch him anyway be seated Moses went up the burning bush the way he went up was not the way he came back down when he came back on his wife said what happened to you something happened to you listen when you meet the transforming power your wife will ask you what happened your son will ask you what happened your boss will ask you what happened come on now somebody please back to me hallelujah when Jacob met the transforming power and he wrestle all night long he end up with a different walk it was impossible for him to hide it from me hallelujah you may be seated dito Antony the opera scared the person who was hiding in fear but when the transforming power came upon pizza this same Peter who denied Christ the same pizza who say I totally message anymore this seal Peter who said I wasn't near that servants walk or sit this is that in case you don't know what this is I like this is that that's a profit so L woke up out this walk is in this movement you're seeing it's a transforming power it's a holy dose it changed me what I was this is the how I was before I used to be different I used to want different things but the transforming power [Applause] you may be seated listen you are lying if you see a car the Holy Ghost and you behavior don't change you ain't got no Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost has transformed a power you're supposed to be different [Applause] you may be seated hallelujah Peter was a no-show it wasn't no put on you know yourself you want a real change you know in situations come for you want act you don't want to act that way no more what do you need transforming power so that when will you be the same situation it don't affect you the same way it did the first time and we can feel the growth you can feel the maturity you can feel the difference anybody in the house anybody in the house James and meet you Gina meet you James I've meet you change and Mitch we were talking about because the only message listen I said somebody speaking recently about people dress and stuff and different things I say you know what God is not legalistic because if he was he never led the woman who washed his feet wash his feet because he was looking at he hat we know what the truth is there's no question about the truth but I don't want to walk around with a big stick pong in you in your head every day because you know what your behavior miwula change your behavior it's to get your mind to change to the wood for you to meet a pillar of fire because when he change your nature your cargo bacchanal oh you don't hear me if it's rules you can forget a rule but I experienced a change your walk you can't unlearn Jacob couldn't fix bugger all know that walk was with him for the rest of his life when you see Jay coming in you walk people who knew the old man said I cappuccino right now my name yes he may walk the front they call me Israel no when you see this walking in Israel you wore on the hand for Jacob Eason enemy who is that good-looking lying behind on my name that is not me my name change for change my talk change my life change my wife no mature and know the pastor no divorce no everybody must know can I trust a man the problem and the message you may be seated is that they're messy people who are a message people know something wrong with that could have no testimony with nobody else body people are wrong them so it's god bless you god bless she's fine brother as in a Muslim as a neighbor as important as in family who not in church what kind of Christian are you it's easy to see who I really was in them you never say well what's not after they come true if you hear argument if you hear what's not we have to go in another part of our host I'm not here the argument in Dale's our interests it is all over me Holy Ghost and fire keeping me alive and when they go home keeping me alive it has to be consistent you see the problem with actin is some nine years forget who you're asking for and what role you're playing in that way must be real because when you're actin so Who am I again to this listen to this one I'm a gangster this one constant one is this you forget to forget you rollerblade but consistent when it come to church that's brother so-and-so mmm glory hole things blessed and highly favored I'm not here on the head I'm not the tail a bother not be neatly no weapon formula against him no merit ravenica whyever gas food and what what what before they're done why why well let's see how Peter hardly seems innovation anyway then cockiness went up in the roof and just relax I say in the caucus but relaxing but the Holy Ghost changes your nature behavior I've preached before you take a pig could he pick nature's the mother that's what the brand said you know the difference in a pig an alarm because we know in every church there's some churches who seem to operate at they do new one kind of believer that's not in the messenger in every church up three kinds of believers in every church I don't care how unknowing to inspire the level quality of teaching in every church have three kinds of believers so I don't know who is real believers who is make believers an anomaly that's not my purview it's above my pay grade God is the author of these things so there we have three kinds of believers can the church say man you have to know how much of this is being left out in your life you have to know what you do it when you leave this place because you are you are but offenses when nobody watching when nobody else is there and you by yourself that's when you know who you really are and that's opposed such a desire in your heart because do you know God gets upset when you know better and don't do it God gets disturbed when you know better you don't do better what does it mean it means your mind hasn't really been changing because your mind changing comes back to belief because if you believe something you will act a certain way listen this coronavirus record it have people listen people believe and they belief in this thing is so serious that airlines say we don't fly in there anymore people have adjusted you don't believe now say III just driving through the city but belief affects your behavior come to church say man everybody feeling fine I still on page no idea region page 7 come back to the would take that would it'll grow it's got to go God's transforming power that brought it up in the first place Enoch was translated from dead by God transforming power so we see it true the message is consistent what did God do that for listen the Prophet is answering what God did that for and this is course this is September of 1965 what God for a type of the rapture in church that's coming so it'll take a transforming power for us to go into the rapture can the church Eamon Jesus body was quickened after it was dead and in the grave Jesus but it was quick about a word of God and transformed transforming power from a dead call a mature resurrected glorified Son of God the word has got to come to pass as gods would plant it in your heart if you want to go in the rafters anybody wants to go in the rapture anybody here wants to go into the rapture that must be your confession you know if you want to be a Christian genuine please this would as I believe it was Ezekiel God said take that school and eat it up the prophet and a wood could become the same Abraham didn't take the scientific research of his day saying I'm too old to have a baby I've went too far I've done this that or the other but he called anything that was contrary to God's Word I'll do it wasn't so everything that was negative that was not supporting his feet his belief he said it doesn't matter he's focused on what God said he counted everything contrary as doesn't matter and he staggered not at the promise of God who unbelief but was strong giving praise to God he know that God was able to perform that what he promised all wandering sons deform by the creepers of this wandering sisters that the places and fashions of this world has drawed you is that you this morning that the fashion of this world has caught your attention and has distracted you from the channel of the wood and sister there you might consider me an all crank but one of these days when you meet what Florence Shikari and met the other night that's when a sister had passed away in the church as you know when you meet that you'll find out not me but this wood is right keep out of those fashion shops keep out of those things it was a transforming power that came to Moses it was the transforming power that came to Gideon it was the transforming power that came to Peter it was the transforming power hallelujah that met the woman with the issue of blood it was a transforming power that met the servant of the Centurion and we tying it up together now I'm not gonna be too much longer but it takes feet to move the power and when Jesus was speaking to the Centurion what did you just say I haven't even seen feet like that in Israel so it was the feet that God saw it wasn't who he was it wasn't he not any message not any Church he's not even a Jew it wasn't that God look at his feet and his feet had to be ignited by a belief he would have had to heard something somewhere some words somewhere that had given him enough feet that he came with the fiddles hide a leafy Jesus had encountered in all of the teaching that it sat on the under Obadiah Zedekiah and Jeremiah let me say that again whatever word that Centurion is it was enough wood to give him a greater fit because faith comes by here in the wood so that Centurion may have heard it from a neighbor you may have heard it from the street people but it he heard it enough and because it was a seed India to respond to it that ignited a faith that was so great as a Gentile he had more fatally choose who grew up in the temple that you have not even seen sleep like this before the faith that he had defeated power how many times you'll just say your feet has made you all not how much time you attend church how long any message your faith is what makes you whole and it's God's amen and the transforming power his faith was so real as a Gentile think about it Francis people saw real and when he got back in and asked if he was healed he said what time I know his field I know that I know he's healed I wanna see hard time he was here how fastest thing does work how immediate this thing is he told you just speak the word he does what it is a speaker would and I know my civil will be healed made of hid in this church rise today that the words spoken would be all that you need to see your situation transform just feed the world richer just speak the word and I know my situation will be transformed can the church say Amen but every time goes on you see Isaiah's lips he was just an ordinary man of unclean lips he said Lord I'm among unclean people and I've got unclean lips woe is me because I've seen God and an angel came down got the fire holy fire off of God's altar and transformed his lips from the lips of a wandering man to the lips of a prophet with thus saith the Lord God's transforming power a hundred and twenty fishermen and little ole sellers of purple of woman and those goddamn themselves in an upper room and closed the doors some of them not enough education to sign their own names God transform them from fishers of men from Memphis to fishers of men from men and woman on the street the scenes of God immortal the transforming power of God may that be the record that's spoken about me also transformed from the preacher I was to our immortal creature hallelujah somebody's give God a shout of praise [Music] [Applause] Paul whatever and I went on in course poet to transform Paul a local church member Presbyterian methodist Baptist Pentecostal or something down the street he went with his great defiant spirit in him that he'd known more than any of them he had come up under gamma leo one of the best teachers there was in the land what happened on his road down to the masses anton wrote down to damascus get a bunch of people who was believing cause would he was going after people to kill them but on his road down there was tricking nominee heard a message and the message but as it transformed him from a church member and a churchgoer to a prophet of god who wrote the would've caught in a new testament from a church member to saint Oh hallelujah hallelujah can the church say man and each age the transforming power is getting stronger and stronger and stronger because as each eight progressed more and more of the word first it was Luther with the first light then Wesley with the second light then the Pentecost with the third light then the Prophet came with the fullness of the light to reveal the fullness of the word to reveal every mystery the time every loose end to let there be no doubt there'll be no question about who you are who God is his nature his being his attributes what you were born for that no devil has power over you that you were there in the back plastic was mine that when Lucifer was kicked out you were there also when you fought in my cup that you will tell also about spiritual amnesia and these things how you forgot who you were because God put you here in a place of triumph the develop character he brought on all these things to remind you just like or remind each other where were you when the sons of God shouted together and the center God's Oliver Shaw he has reminded us of who we are in the economy of God that we are not angels and we are not servants but that we are sons and daughters of the Living God and we access to an inheritance not just a natural one but a spiritual inheritance and in that inheritance is eternal life in fact inheritance is power in that inheritance is authority hallelujah can the church see man give us a fullness of the word as a conductor of the Spirit to be with a chance port to power so everywhere you call your transport and power in the form of the wood but one of these days the potential will make himself known the potential wasn't Moses from the point he was born the potential to be a deliverer was in him can the church say man from the time Killian was born the potential to be a deliverer was in him also he just didn't know it he just didn't realize it he went to school he didn't know who he was Moses grew up not knowing who he was but one tear the transforming power visited him the changes see that was in him from potential into manifestation and the same transforming power came to helium the change to see that wasn't in him as potential to manifestation and one of these days the same transforming power will come to your house will come to your street will come to your neighborhood and you'll come find you and you will check the potential in you and he will activate the seed in you and transform that seed not just as potentials hit potential first you potential no no no no it'll be a manifested reality eat living faith living with you living knowledge living temperance living patients living colonist living brotherly kindness even charity itself flowing from your being to see the potential of the rapture laying in your soul one of these days the transforming power because the rapture will be inside out Oh hallelujah the wrapped is in me right now the Raptors in you right now it's in seed form it's in potential form waiting for the Holy Ghost the transforming power to see to life is getting stronger I can feel it I can feel it I can feel the cutting of time I can feel eternity breaking upon us the blending of time it's him eternity oh my oh my oh my the musician go get ready I'm not gonna be too much longer but there Branham said it my redeemer liveth he said I'll tell you brother when I feel that resurrecting he call it the resurrect and transforming power of the Lord Jesus Christ circling through a human body that gives perfect assurance there's more joy in that in five minutes than there is an all the worldly pleasure that could be given that resurrected power but their pattern was already feeling it he said when I feel the resurrect and transforming power what was he saying it's already in me the transforming power it's flowing through my veins it's already on my cells it's on my molecules it's just my season is not yet and today I feel the resurrection power I feel the transforming

hallelujah glory glory glory glory somebody give God a shout of praise can you feel it today it's a transforming power he's been changing you from the moment you met this message he's been changing

you t by T by T every tear getting stronger every trial every time you fall down it's a transformation every defeat every victory battle scars so when you line up master David you could compare battle scars when you line up next to the heroes of faith you can look at your scars and talk about your stories of how you made it over that it was not your strength but it was a transforming power you may be seated and so is the Holy Spirit it's to be manifested it's a promise I don't know look around seeing we already had revival and I don't know I don't know I'm looking for something but ever I said this is 63 and so it's a Holy Spirit it's to be manifested when we see the Lord Jesus coming in glory and feel that transforming power and see the ten rising out of the grave and know that that second longer will be changed and have a body like his it will be made manifested then to those who rejected it will be left out who somebody saint man he's in the whole set now but Abraham speaking to us you are now living in the day of the restoration of the feet that was once delivered to the scenes living under the power of the latter rain of the Holy Ghost Church that's raising up to thee in
