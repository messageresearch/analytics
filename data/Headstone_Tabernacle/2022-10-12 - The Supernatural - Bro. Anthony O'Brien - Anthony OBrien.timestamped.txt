[31:27] we know what we worship for salvation is
[31:30] of the Jews
[31:32] but the hour coming and now is when the
[31:36] true worshipers shall worship the father
[31:38] in spirit and in truth for the father
[31:42] seeketh such to worship Him
[31:45] and verse 24 says God is a spirit and

[32:47] granted almighty God we pray and ask it
[32:50] in Jesus name amen and amen praising him
[32:53] the Lord let me have your seats here
[33:01] amen praise God so I have a thought here
[33:04] tonight my thought is the supernatural
[33:07] that's my thought amen the supernatural
[33:10] praise God and he said I've taken my
[33:13] context straight out of verse 24 where
[33:15] Jesus speaking he says God is a spirit
[33:18] and they that worship Him must worship
[33:20] Him in spirit and in truth praise God
[33:24] Hallelujah the supernatural amen that's
[33:26] my thought tonight and that's a thought
[33:28] that just kind of was dwelling on my
[33:30] mind and begin to think about how God is
[33:32] a spirit praise God he's not your friend
[33:35] around the corner he's not someone you
[33:37] know he's not a man that he would lie
[33:39] but he's a spirit praise God he's not a
[33:42] natural thing it's a supernatural thing
[33:44] praise God it come from a supernatural
[33:47] place the word of God comes from a
[33:49] supernatural place doesn't come from
[33:51] man's not man's idea it's not man's
[33:54] opinion it's not what we think about it
[33:56] but it is the thoughts of God Express
[33:58] into the word of God and that's what
[34:01] brought us here tonight not a natural
[34:04] man not a natural thing but a
[34:06] supernatural car doing a supernatural
[34:09] thing in our lives age to age he has
[34:13] remained the same and he is the same
[34:16] tonight oh we serve a supernatural God
[34:19] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and
[34:23] that's what just keep rooting on my mind
[34:25] because you know you hear it and you
[34:27] talk about it and you you've said it so
[34:29] many times before but when you really
[34:31] dwell on it begin to realize that this
[34:34] world is not your home this natural
[34:37] behavior this natural thing that you're
[34:40] accustomed to this is not where you
[34:42] belong you belong somewhere else and God
[34:45] himself is a supernatural being he
[34:48] always was he always is he is tonight he
[34:53] exists tonight he can hear you tonight
[34:56] he can hear your prayer he can hear your
[34:59] cry he can hear your plea he can hear
[35:02] the desire of your hearts and nights
[35:04] he's just alive tonight as a person son
[35:07] sitting next to you as a person standing
[35:10] in front of you or just as real as we
[35:12] are here tonight God is real and he is a
[35:16] spirit and they that worship Him must
[35:19] worship Him in spirits and in truth not
[35:23] in your flesh or not in your feelings
[35:25] not in your emotions but in the spirits
[35:29] oh John Heard a Voice said come up
[35:31] hither I have something to show you come
[35:34] up out of your flesh come up out of your
[35:37] atmosphere come about where you come
[35:39] from come out of your neighborhood come
[35:41] out of your friendships come out of your
[35:43] circles break out of the natural and get
[35:46] into the supernatural where all things
[35:49] are possible where the sick and be
[35:51] healed what a blind can see where the
[35:54] cripples can walk where the gospel is
[35:57] preaching is power that's what the
[35:59] Supernatural is oh somebody say man
[36:03] somebody say hallelujah oh I'm so
[36:06] thankful that hey I'm so thankful
[36:08] tonight Hallelujah glory to God to
[36:11] please believe in this Supernatural God
[36:14] because this natural world can't do it
[36:16] for me when this natural rule run all
[36:18] the answers when they run out of ideas
[36:20] when there's no more hope left when
[36:23] there's no more answers for the world
[36:24] left what will you look to David said I
[36:27] look into the hills from winds come in
[36:29] my help my Help Cometh From God might
[36:33] have don't come from no natural source
[36:36] my help comes from a supernatural source
[36:39] of Jacob's will could never do but I
[36:42] could draw from this well and if you
[36:46] drink from this well tonight you'll
[36:48] never tell second because it's
[36:50] supernatural there's every Power every
[36:54] anointing every presence in the
[36:56] Supernatural to heal the sick to raise a
[37:00] dead to open the blind eyes to make the
[37:03] cripples walk oh you are limited in
[37:07] yourself but With God all things are
[37:10] possible all things shall be made known
[37:13] oh Hallelujah
[37:18] [Applause]
[37:21] amen you believe it tonight
[37:23] God is a supernatural being
[37:27] Supernatural person he's not a natural
[37:30] person
[37:31] I know we hear it but I want you to
[37:34] dwell on it just long enough for it to
[37:36] saturate begin to understand is not
[37:39] natural he's not an animal he's not an
[37:41] object he's not a thing he's a spirit
[37:43] he's a real person but in a world where
[37:46] you can't see or you can't see with your
[37:49] natural eyes oh but you gotta have faith
[37:52] tonight to know that he is there that he
[37:55] is listening to you

[39:42] yourself like God if you're going to
[39:45] have the godliness if you're gonna have
[39:47] probably kindness if you're going to
[39:48] have the temperance in the midst of the
[39:50] trial when people curse in your face
[39:52] when people call you a talk where people
[39:55] say this against you that's against you
[39:57] when they try to cut you and destroy you
[40:00] and assassinate your character you can
[40:02] stand there like a Son of God and say

[40:10] [Music]
[40:11] like
[40:13] and then God takes dose of that
[40:15] and he goes back to the father
[40:17] and he says you won't believe what your
[40:21] son just said you won't believe what
[40:23] your son just did oh Hallelujah he did
[40:26] this I did this to him I did that to him
[40:28] and he still rise up God is a good God

[40:37] he's coming on
[40:39] give him some more trials
[40:42] give him a little more time
[40:44] good
[40:46] huh
[40:47] give them a little more season it out
[40:50] Joseph before his work came the word of
[40:54] the Lord Tried Him
[40:56] try Joseph Holly Joseph knew God don't
[41:00] show good just the end of the vision
[41:02] but what Joseph don't know is the time
[41:04] and the season when it will be fulfilled
[41:06] he just had a hole on my pitch and
[41:09] believed that what God revealed to him
[41:11] by a dream would be manifested in time
[41:13] and season but he don't know when that
[41:15] is so he just had to wait there he has a
[41:18] gift he has the anointing he has the
[41:21] ability to do what God called him to do
[41:24] but yet God put him in time make him sit
[41:27] down in a prison make him wait make him
[41:30] question could it be make him stay there
[41:33] wait upon the word I mean all his reason
[41:36] and fell away the only thing that
[41:38] remained was a word was a vision that
[41:42] God had given him and I tell you tonight
[41:44] when all the humanists pulled away when
[41:48] all of our thoughts all of our cares all
[41:50] of our ideas get dried out the only
[41:53] thing that will remain is this word that
[41:56] the prophet caref there shall be a pride
[41:58] there shall be oh Hallelujah a
[42:01] manifestation or oh Hallelujah Glory of
[42:04] these seven unknown Turners to wake her

[42:12] the only hope the church Got Tonight is
[42:15] a Dynamics to the mechanics it's a
[42:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire
[42:19] that's the only hope that young people
[42:22] have tonight is the Holy Fire of God to
[42:26] come down in the soul and break Lucifer
[42:29] and break demons out of their hearts
[42:32] chains of Darkness will be broken by the
[42:35] power of the Living God there will be a
[42:38] visitation to the young people don't you
[42:41] forget that

[43:18] word are we preaching tonight now we'll
[43:20] be leaving on tonight now we've been
[43:22] believing all these years that word
[43:24] didn't come from a natural place that
[43:27] wasn't written on some Scrolls somewhere
[43:28] that wasn't some guy fought it up that
[43:31] wasn't some imagination or some
[43:33] affection or some human reasoning that
[43:35] was a word of God spoken through a
[43:38] prophet that prophesied let there be
[43:41] oh Hallelujah and I tell you tonight oh
[43:46] we are Standing on the Promises of God

[48:19] right now with his wife and children he
[48:21] don't know first the power of God over
[48:23] him so he anointed over him so that's
[48:26] the supernatural that's what the

[50:31] what the good does it do
[50:33] a historical God for today
[50:36] what benefit is God of Elijah to a man
[50:39] today if he isn't the same God
[50:42] it's got to be the same God today right
[50:44] as he was back then
[50:47] people talk about what the prophet did
[50:48] but people failing to see that God is
[50:51] getting a church ready today to do what
[50:54] that Prophet did to heal the sick to
[50:56] raise the dead to cast our Devils he's
[50:59] getting a group to get up now to fulfill
[51:02] that to fulfill this pyramid here or to
[51:06] have all these virtues in her that's
[51:08] what he's preparing our pride for now to
[51:10] do the same thing
[51:12] cool same word slave same life same
[51:14] signs same wonders same Miracle same
[51:18] power
[51:18] same Supernatural presence

[51:36] not the same today then you'd better be
[51:40] you it's better you learn agriculture or
[51:41] something professor
[51:44] you wasting a Time basically is what
[51:48] he's saying he said if he's not the same
[51:49] God today if he can't do the same things
[51:52] he did yesterday or the day before if
[51:53] he's not consistently God then his best
[51:56] way golden agriculture or something or
[51:59] something that would help somebody
[52:00] is that right some kind of psychology or
[52:02] something right
[52:03] he said you'd be better off if you
[52:05] learned your children to be an architect
[52:07] instead of a minister
[52:09] if he's a historical God if he's not the
[52:11] same today what good does a god of Moses
[52:13] do Tom Hunt today if he is in the same
[52:15] God today oh but we know tonight he's
[52:17] the same God today he's the same
[52:19] yesterday he's the same today and he's
[52:22] the same forever oh he's the same God I
[52:25] walk with Moses he's the same God I walk
[52:28] with Jacob and Joseph who spoke to his
[52:31] servants throughout the ages age to age
[52:34] he's still the same just imagine Luther
[52:37] or had a church with people in it and
[52:40] they believe God for the age and that
[52:42] was so many years ago you could look
[52:44] back and look at Wesley and the people
[52:46] at their time and they had a Revival and
[52:49] that was so many years ago but they
[52:51] stood for God in their age oh what are
[52:53] we doing here tonight what are we doing
[52:55] here in this church we are standing for
[52:57] God in our age oh we are standing for
[53:01] God in our time in our season
[53:04] and the devil is very scared oh
[53:07] hallelujah what are we going to become
[53:09] because this is the final age there's no
[53:12] more ages to come so therefore this is
[53:14] the final age then that means this is a
[53:16] great Crescendo this is a great climax
[53:19] this is a great epiphany of all the ages
[53:23] of all the things that have been
[53:24] manifested before God's Gonna culminate
[53:27] God's Gonna gather them all together oh
[53:30] that was in God he poured into Christ
[53:33] and all that was in Christ what did he
[53:35] do what did he do somebody answer me
[53:38] tonight he pours it into the church or
[53:41] other church tonight is made up of
[53:43] individuals one over here one over there

[54:01] America wherever oh God has its seeds
[54:04] out
[54:12] oh that time is coming soon
[54:18] we Randall said God like to let the
[54:20] message run down until it become common
[54:23] until people relax and they get along in
[54:27] the message they get all days and Duty
[54:30] praise God and begin to say oh Lord you
[54:32] let it come in then they got to get into
[54:34] our atmosphere with his heart clown at
[54:36] one another and evil surmising and back
[54:38] Python and whatnot huh he gets so
[54:41] accustomed to not having the spirit of
[54:43] God a myths around them that they don't
[54:46] even know any disappears because they
[54:48] never had it to begin with but there is
[54:50] another people in the land tonight who
[54:52] under their under their messenger would
[54:55] be the final voice to the final age
[54:58] they're gonna live they're gonna be
[55:00] influenced by the supernatural the
[55:03] supernatural will walk with you it will
[55:05] come out of you it'll heal the sick he
[55:08] will make himself known to your family
[55:10] to your friends to your loved ones
[55:13] they're going to know a new difference
[55:15] they're gonna know when you talk
[55:16] different they're going to know when you
[55:18] walk their front even the devil will
[55:20] know when you walk different he said
[55:22] Paul I know Peter I know and he's going
[55:25] to say you I know also you gotta
[55:27] testimony that you please call
[55:31] and you have this
[55:33] in your being walking on two feet God
[55:36] will know when you've got that
[55:38] he'll try to squeeze it out but it'll be
[55:40] too late
[55:41] amen there'll be one more
[55:43] amen
[55:46] oh man
[55:49] I'm trying to get through this
[55:51] all right I had a little portion here I
[55:53] want to read
[55:54] from a guy by Dr Francis Collins
[55:57] and he's a
[55:59] big scientist guy
[56:01] and they had an article in him on PBS
[56:03] but he's also a Christian
[56:05] so he's great
[56:06] High intellectual scientific guy but
[56:09] he's also a Christian and this is how he
[56:11] describes I just want to read something
[56:13] they thought I'd Inspire he just this is
[56:15] how he describes the difference between
[56:16] God and science or between God and the
[56:21] natural he says if God is who God claims
[56:24] to be he said and who I believe he is
[56:27] then he is not explainable in natural
[56:29] terms
[56:31] he said he's outside of our natural
[56:34] world outside of space and time he said
[56:37] so if God listen to this he said if God
[56:40] choose to intervene from time to time in
[56:44] our natural world by allowing the
[56:47] occurrence of miraculous events then I
[56:50] do not see why that is an illogical
[56:53] possibility in other words he's saying I
[56:55] don't see how it's impossible for a God
[56:58] who dwells outside of space and time for
[57:01] every once in a while when he has the
[57:04] need to he could step into your natural
[57:06] world and bring divine intervention and
[57:09] to cause things that happen and bring
[57:11] miraculous events and then step back out
[57:14] and watch the scene unfold you don't see
[57:16] how that's impossible because he's
[57:18] higher than us the Bible's head is ways
[57:21] are higher than our ways his thoughts
[57:23] are high and our thoughts our thoughts
[57:25] will perish in a day but God's thoughts
[57:27] are Eternal but God thoughts the Norris
[57:30] remain thoughts one day God spoke his
[57:33] thoughts and those thoughts became my
[57:35] word and that is what we have here
[57:37] tonight so when he says I am the Lord
[57:41] that he let all thy diseases when he
[57:44] says grieve not the holy spirit of God
[57:47] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[57:50] redemption that's not man's thoughts
[57:52] that is God's thoughts being expressed
[57:55] that is him intervening in your life
[57:58] when he chooses to when he has needs to
[58:01] he will step in and he will step back
[58:04] out and watch a scene unfold
[58:06] oh somebody praise him tonight I'm so
[58:10] happy I'm so glad that I'm not leaning
[58:13] on man I'm not leaning on my own
[58:15] understanding but I'm leaning on the
[58:17] understanding of God I'm leaning on the
[58:19] supernatural I'm leaning on a being
[58:22] because God is a spirit and they don't
[58:25] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[58:28] and in truth I'm not worshiping him my
[58:31] flashlight but I have an understanding
[58:34] he has opened our understanding to the
[58:36] scriptures to understand who he is what
[58:40] he is Who We Are Who The Devil is and
[58:43] what our promises in this heart oh I
[58:47] can't settle anything less God has
[58:49] already revealed himself and to whom
[58:51] much is given much is expected tonight
[58:56] Hallelujah

[1:17:40] until the Holy Ghost came because they
[1:17:42] got in one place I'm going to call it
[1:17:44] see he said it's the atmosphere that
[1:17:46] brings the results you believe that he

[1:17:51] building this morning and I say tonight
[1:17:53] boy or girl get everything from their
[1:17:56] minds but the Lord Jesus here and he
[1:17:59] said but I believe that he's standing
[1:18:01] present right now he said if you could
[1:18:02] get into that place isn't that right he
[1:18:05] said what do you tell the prophet he
[1:18:06] said he totally Prophet if he could get
[1:18:07] the people to believe he said not even
[1:18:10] cancer will stamp in your prayer if you
[1:18:12] could only get the people to believe oh
[1:18:15] how to raise their faith up to the point
[1:18:18] where they could believe God for
[1:18:20] everything and anything or not even
[1:18:23] cancer would stand in there in your way
[1:18:26] man is not right Mine He's a little
[1:18:29] remind woman but get everything from
[1:18:30] their minds and believe believe what
[1:18:32] that he's standing present right now he
[1:18:35] said and you will see something
[1:18:37] happening he said that will cause
[1:18:39] headlines in the newspaper in the
[1:18:40] morning oh that's right pray Express
[1:18:43] Guardian news they will be reporting the
[1:18:46] pillar virus took place in Sunny around
[1:18:48] here if you could just get every man
[1:18:49] every woman every child in the right
[1:18:52] atmosphere in the right mental attitude
[1:18:54] oh you want to take place he says that's
[1:18:57] right he said it's the atmosphere oh the
[1:19:00] presence of God his atmosphere is
[1:19:02] evidence of the supernatural amen isn't
[1:19:06] that right and it takes Faith to believe
[1:19:08] in the Supernatural it's not right not
[1:19:11] our thoughts not our emotions it's not
[1:19:14] right the only thing God ever gave to
[1:19:16] the supernatural the con uh the only
[1:19:18] thing God gave to the individual tonight
[1:19:20] to contact the Supernatural is faith
[1:19:23] that's what he gave Pastor contacted
[1:19:26] isn't that right he said Divine Healing
[1:19:28] and sanitation the powers of God he said
[1:19:30] watch this the prophet said is here it's
[1:19:32] a Divine Healing sanification and the
[1:19:34] powers of God is as long as your faith
[1:19:37] lasts in it
[1:19:40] wow and I believe just before that he
[1:19:43] was talking about how uh people come
[1:19:45] into a prayer line or they sit in the
[1:19:46] audience and the Holy Spirit is working
[1:19:48] and then he speaks to a certain person
[1:19:50] said you'll come here with a certain
[1:19:52] sickness and so on stand up receive a
[1:19:53] healing right and they get healed and
[1:19:56] then maybe a year later
[1:19:58] they get back in the same condition he
[1:20:01] said why is that he said because as long
[1:20:03] as your faith lasts in it praise God
[1:20:05] that's how long it'll last but if you're
[1:20:07] getting the wrong atmosphere the wrong
[1:20:09] things begin to happen it's not right
[1:20:11] Divine Healing sanification he says it's
[1:20:13] as long as your faith lasts in it he
[1:20:16] said when your faith fails then your
[1:20:18] experience is gone
[1:20:19] see he said it's it's based that way
[1:20:22] simply on the finished works of Christ
[1:20:24] at Calvary amen no wonder God told Peter
