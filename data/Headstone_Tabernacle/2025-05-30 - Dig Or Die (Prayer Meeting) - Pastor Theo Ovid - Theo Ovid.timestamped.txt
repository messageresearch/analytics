[12:40] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Let
[12:42] us bow our heads tonight for a prayer.
[12:46] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[12:48] presence, Lord. And I pray that the
[12:50] anointing will break through into each
[12:51] home, into each heart, into each life.
[12:53] May the word spoken tonight be inspiring
[12:56] to your children, that they will dash
[12:58] into your blessings, that they will dash
[12:59] into your presence, that they will
[13:01] connect with this risen, re resurrected
[13:04] Christ, ever present to fulfill your
[13:06] promised word, looking over your word,
[13:08] looking to confirm your word with signs,
[13:10] wonders, and miracles. We thank you for
[13:12] sending this end time message. We thank
[13:14] you for sending words of life, words in
[13:17] due season. We thank you that we are, oh
[13:20] God, feasting on this unfailing bodywood
[13:22] of the son of man. We appreciate all
[13:25] what you have done for us. We thank in
[13:26] advance for what you're about to do
[13:28] tonight. We thank you in advance what
[13:29] you're going to do on Sunday, Father
[13:31] God, and throughout the week. Granted,
[13:33] Lord, that your presence be with us this
[13:34] night in Jesus mighty I ask it. Amen.
[13:36] God bless you and welcome. And you have
[13:39] your
[13:39] Bibles. I'd like you to turn with me to
[13:42] 2 Kings chapter 3.
[13:44] We want to look into that
[13:47] scripture. Read a couple of verses.
[13:49] Second Kings chapter 3, reading from
[13:51] verse one. Now Jehoram, the son of Ahab,
[13:55] began to reign over Israel in Samaria,
[13:57] the 18th year of Jehoshaphat, king of
[14:00] Judah, reigned 12 years and reigned 12
[14:02] years. And he wrote even in the sight of
[14:05] the Lord, but not like his father and
[14:08] like his mother. For he put away the
[14:10] image of Baal that his father had made.
[14:14] Note here that God made an actual
[14:18] comparison. This man is an evil man, not
[14:20] as evil as his father because he did
[14:23] this positive, that positive.
[14:25] Nevertheless, here we go. Verse three.
[14:28] He cleaved unto the sins of Jerobam, the
[14:31] son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin.
[14:34] He departed not there from. And Misha,
[14:37] king of Moab, was a sheep master, and
[14:39] rendered unto the king of Israel and
[14:41] 100,000 lambs and 100,000 rams with
[14:45] wool. And it came to pass when Ahab was
[14:47] dead, that the king of Moab rebelled
[14:50] against the king of Israel. And King
[14:52] Jaram went out of Samaria the same time,
[14:55] and numbered all Israel. He went and
[14:58] sent to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah,
[15:01] saying, The king of Moab had rebelled
[15:03] against me. Will thou go with me against
[15:05] Moab to battle? He said, I will go up. I
[15:08] am as thou art. My people as I as thy
[15:11] people and my horses as thy horses. And
[15:13] he said, which way shall we go up? He
[15:15] said, the way through the wilderness of
[15:18] Edom. So the king of Israel went and the
[15:20] king of Judah, the king of Edom, and
[15:23] they fetched a compass of seven days
[15:25] journey, and there was no water for the
[15:27] host and for the cattle that followed
[15:30] them. And the king of Israel said,
[15:32] "Alas, that the Lord had called these
[15:35] three kings together to deliver them
[15:37] into the hand of Moab." But Jehoshaphat
[15:40] said, "Is there not here a prophet of
[15:44] the Lord, that we may inquire of the
[15:46] Lord by him?" And one of the king of
[15:49] Israel's servants answered and said,
[15:51] "Here is Elisha, the son of Chaffhat,
[15:54] which poured water on the hands of
[15:56] Elijah."
[15:57] And Jehoshaphat said, "The good word of
[16:00] the Lord is with him." So the king of
[16:02] Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of
[16:05] Edom went down to him. And Elisha said
[16:08] unto the king of Israel, "What have I to
[16:10] do with thee? Get thee to the prophets
[16:13] of thy father and to the prophets of thy
[16:15] mother." And the king of Israel said
[16:17] unto him, "Nay, for the Lord had called
[16:19] these three kings together to deliver
[16:21] them into the hand of Moab." Elijah
[16:25] said, "As the Lord of hosts livesth
[16:27] before whom I stand, surely wait not for
[16:30] I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat,
[16:32] the king of Judah, I will not look
[16:34] towards thee, nor see thee. Now bring me
[16:37] a
[16:38] minstrel." And it came to pass when the
[16:40] minstrel played that the hand of the
[16:43] Lord came upon him. Let's make a little
[16:45] pause right here. The prophet here is
[16:47] upset. He is completely lose it seeing
[16:50] this guy fooling around but he respected
[16:55] Jehoshaphat and to get in the spirit he
[16:58] asked for someone to come and play some
[17:01] music a minstrip and when the minstrel
[17:04] played the hand of the lord came upon
[17:07] him so prophecies and visions can't come
[17:10] dry it can't come you solidly in your
[17:13] flesh solidly in the humanistic realm
[17:16] and looking for vision and looking for
[17:17] this it doesn't come that way. This
[17:19] prophet who have a gift of catching
[17:22] God's mind and the intelligence of God,
[17:24] he has to get full in the spirit. Then
[17:26] he said, "Thus say the Lord." This is
[17:28] God speaking now, "Make the this valley
[17:33] full of
[17:37] ditches." Verse 17. For thus sayeth the
[17:40] Lord, he shall not see wind, neither
[17:43] shall ye see rain, yet that valley shall
[17:47] be filled with water, that you may drink
[17:49] both ye and your cattle and your
[17:52] beast. And this is about a light thing
[17:56] in the sight of the Lord. He will
[17:58] deliver the moit moabites also into
[18:01] their hand. Note here how God's
[18:04] encouragement to them is, don't look
[18:06] with your
[18:07] eyes. Don't look what you see, but
[18:10] there's going to be
[18:12] water. You shall not see wind, neither
[18:15] shall you see rain, yet water. So God
[18:19] actually put them on a high level of
[18:21] expectation in faith to believe that
[18:24] this thing is going to happen. Let's
[18:26] continue 19. and you shall smite every
[18:29] fence city, every choice city, and shall
[18:33] fell every good tree, and stop all the
[18:35] wells of water, and mar every good piece
[18:38] of land with
[18:40] stones. And it came to pass in the
[18:42] morning when the meat offering was
[18:44] offered, that behold, there came water
[18:47] by the way of Edom, and the country was
[18:49] filled with water. And when all the
[18:53] Moabites heard that the kings were come
[18:56] up to fight against them, they gathered
[18:58] all that they were able to put on armor
[19:01] and upward and stood at the border in
[19:03] the border. And they rose early in the
[19:05] morning and the sun shone upon the
[19:08] water. Get this. And they rose early in
[19:12] the morning, and the sun shone upon the
[19:16] water, and the Moabites saw the water on
[19:19] the other side as red as blood. And they
[19:24] said, "This is blood. The kings are
[19:28] surely slain, and they have smitten one
[19:31] another." Now therefore, Moab to the
[19:34] spoil.
[19:36] When they came to the camp of Israel,
[19:38] the Israel rose up and smoked the
[19:41] Moabites so that they fled before them
[19:44] and they went forward smiting the
[19:45] Moabites even in their country. And they
[19:48] beat down the cities and every good
[19:50] piece of land, cast every man stone, and
[19:52] filled it. They stopped all the wells of
[19:54] water and fell all the good trees. Only
[19:56] in
[19:57] Persette left there the stones thereof.
[19:59] How be it the slingers went about it and
[20:01] smoked it. May God bless his word. What
[20:03] a word tonight. whatever reason another
[20:06] thought I want to share with you. Dig or
[20:09] die. That's it. Dig or die. And brother
[20:14] Brandham talk about I believe it's time
[20:16] now that the Pentecostal church has
[20:19] recognized what is done. The real
[20:22] spiritfilled leaders, spiritfilled
[20:24] Christians, they recognize something
[20:27] happened. They have cooled off because
[20:29] everybody's trying to live on the
[20:32] mountaintop going off without God. What
[20:36] we need today is to get back to God. Get
[20:39] back to the
[20:42] experience. They recognize that they
[20:44] were out there without fruit, no love,
[20:48] fussing one another. your oneness, your
[20:51] triness, you belong to your assembly,
[20:53] your church of God, calling one another
[20:56] bad names and other bad names. You see
[20:59] how brother bring it? No fruit. And the
[21:01] world turns around and look and say,
[21:02] "What's the matter with them people?
[21:04] Both of them speaking in tongues,
[21:06] prophesying, and they don't even respect
[21:09] one another." We could say it this way.
[21:10] Look at them in the message. All them
[21:12] has spoken on books. All them say they
[21:13] believe Malachi 4 and look at the
[21:16] behavior. They haven't got any decency
[21:18] for each other.
[21:20] What we need today is back to the fruit
[21:24] of the spirit. Love, joy, peace, faith,
[21:29] longsuffering. God can send a gift among
[21:32] them and they will call it telepathy.
[21:34] They will call it the devil. They will
[21:36] call it something else. If one church is
[21:38] sponsoring it, the other one because
[21:40] this one has something to do with it, it
[21:41] is no good. What a pitiful condition.
[21:44] The thing of it is the church went off
[21:46] without God. They went off. They found
[21:48] the fruit of the spirit has left the
[21:51] church. Longsuffering. Some of them have
[21:54] enough temper to fight a bus. And you
[21:56] talk about the holy ghost. Now the fruit
[21:58] of the spirit is love, joy,
[22:00] suffering. So longsuffering's fruit all
[22:03] dried up. That's where the church has
[22:05] got till the fruit of the spirit is
[22:07] drying up everywhere. We see it
[22:09] everywhere. We know it is truth. Here we
[22:12] go.
[22:14] So when they came to this
[22:16] prophet, what a ri he got into. This
[22:20] might kindly hurt his sanctification a
[22:22] little bit, but he really got boiled up.
[22:24] He said to Jehoram, he said, "Why don't
[22:26] you go on to your own prophet? Why don't
[22:28] you get to your mommy prophet? Why don't
[22:30] you go to your daddy prophet? Go over to
[22:32] them formers now. You're in trouble. Why
[22:34] don't you go on to them?" But the Lord
[22:37] brought us out here. We are going to
[22:39] die. We are going to get killed. You are
[22:41] not only going to die. You're already
[22:43] dead. All the fruits are dried up and
[22:44] the spirit going on to the church has
[22:46] just become a religious organization.
[22:48] That's right. Something is wrong. If we
[22:50] can't get God back in the church
[22:53] somewhere, what are we going to do? They
[22:55] going to perish. And then this prophet,
[22:58] listen, after he got through balling him
[23:00] out, he said, "If it wasn't for that
[23:03] respected, I respected the presence of
[23:05] Jehoshaphat, that elected man, I
[23:07] wouldn't even look at you." Oh, he had
[23:09] to get his temper down a little bit, you
[23:11] know. He said, "Bring me a ministre." He
[23:13] got heat up. He said, "Bring me a
[23:15] ministre." And listen to what man
[23:18] interject here. What about some of you
[23:20] Church of Christ people so-called that
[23:21] don't believe in music in the church?
[23:24] After he got heat up, he needed a little
[23:27] music to bring the spirit on him. That's
[23:31] right. Yes, sir. Now, remember, God
[23:33] doesn't change. And if the good music
[23:36] brought the spirit on the prophet, then
[23:39] it will do the same thing today. He
[23:41] said, "Bring me a minstrel." Well, I
[23:43] ain't a prophet, but maybe you can be
[23:45] part of the minstrel. You can do
[23:48] something towards it. You got a
[23:50] testimony of something you can do. The
[23:52] Holy Spirit is run the church. So, when
[23:54] the spirit came on us, came on, what was
[23:56] the vision the spirit give to the
[23:58] prophet. What did he see? Now, take all
[24:01] your soldiers out and school them over.
[24:04] No, he said get to digging. And tonight,
[24:07] if you look closer, this is putting
[24:10] those same people to work. He didn't say
[24:12] go and get hammocks and swing. He didn't
[24:14] say go and pill your toes by the beach.
[24:17] He said don't don't just listen to
[24:18] spoken word and tapes and just relax
[24:21] yourself. It's relaxing time. You find
[24:22] that quote is relaxing time. Relax
[24:24] yourself. No, he said go and dig. In
[24:26] other words, there is something for you
[24:28] to do. He said go and dig. Get to
[24:32] digging. out in the desert. You people
[24:34] once crossed this desert. He said God
[24:37] gave it to them after grace was done. So
[24:39] I want to say tonight this grace thing,
[24:42] you know, God will work it out and you
[24:44] just dare in la line
[24:47] la land and taking things for granted
[24:51] and living an entitled life that
[24:53] supposed to work out and you don't want
[24:55] to do one thing. You're just waiting for
[24:56] the train to be moving to jump on. It's
[24:58] not going to work like that. He said,
[25:01] "You know what?" You say, "Listen, you
[25:03] know what it does to throw a log in a
[25:05] channel? What does it?" All kind of dirt
[25:09] hits against this log and washes up. So
[25:11] you have a river flowing and you throw a
[25:14] log in it, it blocks it. Then first
[25:16] thing you know, you got all kind of
[25:18] water backed up like beavers do and make
[25:20] a dam and they got nothing to go through
[25:22] it. He said, "We have got so much beaver
[25:25] preachers today trying to dam up the
[25:28] water and say this is ours. This is just
[25:31] us here. This belong to us. Then is the
[25:34] us preachers. He called them beaver
[25:36] preachers. And that's what happened
[25:38] because they limit God to their group,
[25:41] their tabernacle, their church, their
[25:42] ministry, their gift. They limit God to
[25:45] that. So they can't receive nobody else
[25:47] nor the church. They're on their own
[25:48] beat. That's what happened today. It
[25:51] become stagnated. That's what happened
[25:53] to a lot of organization. And you know
[25:54] stagnated water gets these wiggle tails
[25:56] in it. That's what the church get wiggle
[25:59] tail. these miracles pass and and and
[26:01] and and so on like that. So then the
[26:04] prophet said get down there and dig all
[26:06] them luggs out. I tell then prophet
[26:09] should we go back and have another
[26:10] mighty Russian win? Nope. Shall we start
[26:13] another latter rain? Nope. Just clean
[26:15] out the channel. That's all you got to
[26:18] do tonight church. Do you hear from the
[26:21] word? What God want is a cleaned out
[26:24] channel. Cleaned out channels. We got
[26:26] the people. Just clean out the channel.
[26:30] The people is all right. Get the
[26:32] channels cleaned out so the Holy Spirit
[26:35] can come in. All your fanatism isms,
[26:38] everything else that's in the church,
[26:40] clean the thing out. The rock is already
[26:42] smitten. The waters are fresh running,
[26:44] but our ecclesical systems have damned
[26:48] up the stream. He said, "Clean those
[26:49] things out. You won't have to have
[26:52] another rushing wind. You won't hear
[26:54] wind nor serene. But yet there'll be
[26:56] water. Oh brother, not a new system. Not
[26:59] a new system. We need what we need is a
[27:01] cleaned out system. We got not make
[27:03] another assemblies of God, another
[27:05] oneness. Get all the logs out of it. All
[27:08] the differences. You see about logs and
[27:11] you start to specify, get some
[27:12] specifics. Get all the differences, the
[27:15] fussing, the stewing. This is not only
[27:17] in church. This is in homes also.
[27:20] Husband and wife, father and son, mother
[27:22] and daughter, family stuff. Get with all
[27:25] the fussing, the stewing and thing like
[27:27] that away from them. The waters will go
[27:29] to flowing back again. There'll be love,
[27:31] joy, a joy like a river flowing over
[27:34] everybody. Just in love with one
[27:36] another. We are not divided. All one
[27:38] body. We one in hope and doctrine, one
[27:40] in charity. That is what we must do.
[27:42] That's the vision of today. That's what
[27:44] the prophet saw in the vision. The true
[27:46] prophet got the same vision today. not a
[27:49] new organization, not another group. You
[27:52] just fuss it out. One place he said is
[27:54] just taking people going from one church
[27:56] to church to next is like one corpse
[27:57] going to our next morg. It's just from
[27:59] morg to morg the shifting. I first start
[28:01] out a ministry many of them come to me
[28:03] and said well brother Brian you ought to
[28:04] start a little organization. I said
[28:06] organization but that is what I'm
[28:08] against. I said what we need is not an
[28:10] organization but clean up the things we
[28:13] have got. That's right. Clear this up.
[28:16] We need a revival. What we need is a
[28:19] digging time. So listen friends, if you
[28:23] think brother or the ministry will be
[28:25] digging for you, you you have to think
[28:28] again because each person have to dig. I
[28:31] have to dig. You have to dig. Every
[28:35] individual have to dig. This is not a
[28:37] Catholic church, a Catholic system where
[28:39] the priest doing the digging and you
[28:40] just doing the drinking and you just,
[28:42] you know, they leave it up to the
[28:43] ministry to dig water for you. It's not
[28:44] working like that. What we need is not
[28:47] an organization, but to clean up the
[28:49] things we've got. That's right. Fear, we
[28:52] need a revival. We need a digging time.
[28:55] Dig. Dig. The deeper you dig, the more
[28:59] water you're going to get. If you dig
[29:01] down and say, "Well, I just come out of
[29:03] oation and look all the stuff you got
[29:05] here. Malice, stripe, anything that
[29:07] clean out the ditch till you go plum
[29:10] down to solid rock. Get down to where
[29:13] the water can really come pouring out of
[29:16] Emanuel's vein. Dig out all the ditches.
[29:19] Get down in these valleys. You fellows
[29:21] have been trying to live on the housetop
[29:23] up there. This is interesting. I just
[29:26] love this here. He's addressing people
[29:29] who always trying to live on the
[29:32] housetop. And and this here affects
[29:36] their humility and their submission to
[29:39] God because they live in a world of
[29:41] pride where all the answers is I'm top
[29:44] of the mountain. on top of the day um um
[29:47] everything in order and you know they
[29:49] don't have this how should I say it at
[29:51] the cross experience Calvary experience
[29:54] the valley experience the humility
[29:58] experience they shun these kind of
[30:00] experiences because God would set things
[30:02] up in a way for us to be for lack of
[30:05] words humiliated or be humbled that we
[30:08] could have a humble heart humble mind
[30:10] humble thinking this is what God wants
[30:13] so trying to live on the housetop
[30:16] sometimes missing God's program. He say
[30:19] shouting, jumping, freezing, frying,
[30:21] everything else. Well, well, he said,
[30:23] "Don't do
[30:24] that. Get down here like where we are
[30:27] tonight and dig out these ditches down
[30:30] low here and get some fresh water.
[30:33] That's what we need." Almost
[30:35] done. Get down and get a hold of water.
[30:38] What we need tonight is the water of
[30:40] God. The vision absolutely interpret
[30:44] God's will to a dying perishing people.
[30:48] The vision tonight of the Lord is to
[30:51] clean out this thing. Clean out not
[30:54] start a new organization. Start a
[30:56] revival in organization. Start a new
[30:58] meeting. Start letting God come in. Dig
[31:01] out your old faultf finding backbiting
[31:04] stiff necks and superstition. Throw the
[31:07] thing out. Well, I tell you, brother
[31:09] Brandham, it would mean this. I don't
[31:11] care what it means. You either dig or
[31:15] die. That is where I get it from. Dig or
[31:18] die. All you Chicago Methodists get
[31:20] digging. Chicago Baptist get digging or
[31:22] perish. Chicago Pentecostal get digging.
[31:24] So, he's addressing all of them. Dig out
[31:26] the things. Throw it out. I will I tell
[31:29] you, thus sayeth the Lord, unless you
[31:32] dig out this corruption that's in there,
[31:35] you will perish. your fruit and church
[31:39] will dry up and die. Dig it out. So this
[31:43] word is as at it starts at a personal
[31:47] level at an individual level and it goes
[31:50] straight up to the church level. Dig out
[31:53] the corruption that is in your life, in
[31:55] your mind, in your spirit, in your
[31:56] behavior, in your attitude. He said you
[31:58] won't hear another latter rain, another
[32:00] former rain, whatever it is, but there
[32:01] will be water and peace like a river
[32:03] flowing through every heart. Yes, sir.
[32:04] You will see signs and wonders. There's
[32:06] not a if. You will see signs and wonders
[32:09] and miracles and the powers of God
[32:11] returning back into the church in a real
[32:14] flowing Pentecost just coming down. Yes,
[32:18] sir. The spirit's message we will start
[32:21] digging or start perishing. So, let me
[32:24] ask you a question tonight. What are you
[32:26] going to do
[32:27] tonight? What you going to do in your
[32:29] own heart, in your own mind, in your
[32:31] home? What are you going to do? Are you
[32:33] going to dig or you going to say well
[32:35] message you know what I
[32:37] mean hallelujah glory I ain't reaching
[32:40] nowhere after the hallelujah and glory
[32:43] you have to dig you have to dig I heard
[32:46] one time a brothers talking about the
[32:48] people in the church don't study the
[32:49] message they depend upon what come from
[32:51] the pulpit and whenever the man now
[32:54] after a while when he preaches how to
[32:55] twist things they don't even recognize
[32:58] what he's saying is not in the Bible
[33:00] what he's saying is not in the and they
[33:02] get twists a few degrees and after 10
[33:05] years, 15 years, they plum off the
[33:07] beaten track, believe in all kind of
[33:09] crazy stuff. But that is not what we are
[33:12] here about. We're here for you to dig,
[33:14] dig for your own self. Yes, sir. The
[33:17] spirit message, we will start digging or
[33:19] start perishing. And there was already
[33:21] perishing so that to dig it out. Dig it
[33:23] out. Get cleaned up deeper. More you
[33:26] dig, the better off you'll be. Oh my.
[33:29] Hallelujah. They was out there one time
[33:32] perishing the same way that you are. But
[33:34] there's channels out there. There's
[33:36] plenty of channels where the rock will
[33:37] still lay in the wilderness yonder.
[33:39] That's the vision tonight, my brother.
[33:41] Here we go. It ain't starting your
[33:43] organization. He's saying back the same
[33:44] thing. Just dig out what's in it. The
[33:47] first thing that old rotten log of
[33:50] organization, throw it out the channel.
[33:52] The channel of God's blessing is all
[33:54] stuffed up tonight. Organization logs
[33:57] laying in there. You see, if you accept
[33:59] yourself as you are and how they say it
[34:02] to me, I'm only human. I want the worst
[34:06] excuse you can tell. You're not an
[34:08] animal. I'm only human. I'm just a man.
[34:11] What you talking about? Jesus died to
[34:13] release a spirit that we could get out
[34:16] of the humanist. Not to make an excuse.
[34:17] I'm only human. All of us are human.
[34:19] We're not animals, half, half monkey. We
[34:21] are humans. That God see sinners. And
[34:24] that God sent his love and Christ blood
[34:27] to save us. not to remain as sinners.
[34:29] But when you see you get religious and
[34:32] you believe that God have to accept you
[34:34] in your condition as you are and you
[34:36] remain as you are, that's a religious
[34:38] spirit. That's a demon. You have to
[34:40] understand that whatever kicking in you
[34:43] that's off he it has to go and you have
[34:47] to fight and you have to dig. You can't
[34:50] just see because when you see you accept
[34:52] things it come like you acceptable like
[34:54] you know you know we have an extension
[34:56] now we're kind of tall. So God lives
[34:57] with us now. You know what I mean? You
[34:59] you you you have extra meat and extra
[35:01] pork and extra thing feeding your golad
[35:03] instead of cutting his head off. You
[35:05] mining golad just raising house and
[35:07] giving him height to come in and whatn
[35:09] not you because you're not tall as him.
[35:11] You letting him rule you and the prophet
[35:12] talking about the sin that rule you. You
[35:15] have to come back to rule it. That's
[35:17] what we talking about. So you have to
[35:18] begin to see that you don't want to be
[35:20] comfortable because that is what people
[35:22] want. They want to get comfort in their
[35:24] sin. They want to be comfortable in
[35:26] their attitude and spirit. Nothing moves
[35:29] them. But when your pillow come hard
[35:31] like rock and go your bed come like
[35:34] bricks like like needles like nails
[35:37] sticking you then you say you know what
[35:39] enough is enough. That prodigal son he
[35:42] took a while before he came to himself.
[35:44] You he was bluffing his way. He was
[35:47] talking his way through. You know he was
[35:49] coming to the big house and people don't
[35:51] know he live in the band behind the
[35:52] house. He was doing all kind of fancy
[35:54] stuff and things. It's still wearing
[35:55] little treads, fancy clothes and
[35:56] whatnot. But he was eating pig food.
[35:59] That is what the that the revelation
[36:01] that the others did not have of him. He
[36:02] was eating pig food. And when he come to
[36:05] the spot where he get so fed up, he said
[36:08] this didn't make any sense. Let just
[36:10] reason this out. The people in my house,
[36:12] my father's house and servant getting
[36:14] good food, getting five course menu, six
[36:16] course menu, getting dessert, getting
[36:18] everything and I eating p food here.
[36:20] This make no sense. I going back home. I
[36:21] go and repent tonight and I want to
[36:23] encourage you tonight. If you find
[36:26] yourself eating big food, find yourself
[36:28] all messed up. Isn't it time to go back
[36:30] home? Isn't it time you can't go back
[36:32] home? You got to repent. He rehearsed
[36:34] it. I was sent to my father. I have
[36:35] sinned. You know what? What's happening
[36:37] there? He's coming down now. He's
[36:39] digging for Clarence. He's digging on
[36:41] the inside. He's searching himself. He
[36:43] recognized he made an out and he
[36:45] prepared to come back as a servant.
[36:46] That's the level of humility that he
[36:48] came down to. prepared to come as a
[36:51] servant and go and and his father was
[36:54] ready to receive him with fatted calf
[36:58] hooked and a robe ready to receive him
[37:01] as a son. Isn't God wonderful?
[37:03] Regardless of what you go through, God
[37:06] comes around ready to receive you as a
[37:08] son, ready to put a robe on you, ready
[37:11] to clothe you and feed you and bless
[37:14] you. Let's close tonight. Oh, blessed be
[37:16] the name of the Lord. I trust the Lord
[37:17] that this will be helpful to you. Just
[37:19] want to finish up one part here now. So
[37:22] they they say, "Isn't there a prophet to
[37:24] consult?" And they consulted Elijah and
[37:26] we know what happened. They got water
[37:27] and so on. But a
[37:29] brand Satan has got every gun in hell
[37:32] trained on it this tabernacle. He will
[37:34] cause one person to do something that is
[37:37] contrary to what another thinks. He's
[37:39] going to do that. He's up to it. That's
[37:42] his business. If he can get somebody to
[37:45] say something, somebody to talk about
[37:47] another and listen. Did you know so and
[37:50] so did so and so? Don't you listen to
[37:52] it. Don't you listen to it at all.
[37:54] That's the devil. Don't you believe it.
[37:57] But you know what you have? You have the
[37:59] gossip and spirit. I have the people who
[38:01] love to hear gossip. So that's a
[38:03] powerful combination. That's like the
[38:05] cap. That's like mechanics and dynamics.
[38:08] The gossiper can't wait to offload and
[38:11] the hearer can't wait to hear. And that
[38:13] is a winning combination for Satan to
[38:16] make that melee a whole canal inside of
[38:18] there. The gossiper. So once you start
[38:21] to checkmate the gossipers and say no no
[38:22] no stop it, hold it. You shut them down.
[38:27] You give them no room to move. They
[38:29] either straighten up or they take the
[38:31] gossip party somewhere else. We need to
[38:34] do that. We need to shut down people. We
[38:37] need to tell them that what you're
[38:38] speaking there doesn't edify, it doesn't
[38:40] build up, it doesn't strengthen, it
[38:43] doesn't help. In other words, it makes
[38:45] no sense. You may as well kill it and
[38:47] get something inspired from God. Oh,
[38:49] let's continue here. I want to finish
[38:51] off here. Brother Brandon, if there's
[38:53] anything that somebody has done wrong,
[38:55] pray for them. Don't pray for them in a
[38:57] selfish way. I know it's my duty. I've
[38:58] got to pray for that brother. No, you
[39:00] take it to your heart really down.
[39:02] across the nation will come. Those who
[39:05] are dead in Christ will rise first. The
[39:07] rapture will take place. The church will
[39:10] be taken home. Then the tribulation will
[39:12] set. Oh my. We don't want to be there
[39:15] during that time. I don't want to be
[39:16] there in the tribulation. No. God forbid
[39:19] that any of us would ever be there
[39:21] during that time because he that is
[39:23] filthy filty still. He is holy, holy
[39:26] still. He is righteous is righteous
[39:28] still. The lamb had come forth with his
[39:31] book of redemption. The bride has been
[39:33] taken out. Those who turn it down has to
[39:37] go through a tribulation period, both
[39:39] Jew and Gentile. What a time of
[39:42] tribulation. I don't want that. Lord,
[39:46] sanctify me now. That's good Nazarene
[39:49] doctrine, ain't it? An old caller
[39:52] brother said, "Sir, I got my ticket in
[39:54] my hand. It's already punched. When I
[39:57] come down to the river that morning, I
[39:59] don't want no trouble. That's about
[40:01] right. I don't want no trouble. Hold
[40:02] your ticket in your hand cuz we're going
[40:04] over. Just think the great time of
[40:06] redemption is at hand. And this is the
[40:08] final quote. Just keep
[40:11] praying like tonight. Keep digging.
[40:16] Yeah. Don't stop. Just like when Elijah
[40:19] told them, dig ditches out there. When
[40:22] you get down, here we go. And you hit an
[40:24] old tin can. say, "I'm too tired." Show
[40:27] it out of the way and keep digging. Just
[40:30] keep digging. Cuz you've got to dig. You
[40:33] have just got to dig. That's all. Cuz if
[40:35] you expect to miss the
[40:36] tribulation, you better start digging.
[40:39] Did you hear that, church? Brother
[40:41] Brandham said, if you expect to miss the
[40:44] tribulation, you better start digging.
[40:46] So, I want to encourage you tonight to
[40:49] pray and dig. Pray for your brothers.
[40:53] Pray for your sisters. Pray for the
[40:55] service. Pray for one another. Let's get
[40:58] down in prayer. Father God, I thank you
[41:00] tonight for your spirit, for your word.
[41:03] Couldn't wait to get to deliver this
[41:04] tonight and is delivered. Father, take
[41:06] it and write it in the hearts of your
[41:08] children that each individual here under
[41:10] the song of my voice will go to digging,
[41:12] Lord. And as they dig, as room is made,
[41:15] may your spirit fill that hole, fill
[41:17] that space, fill that gap. In Jesus name
[41:19] I ask it. Amen. And amen. And God bless
[41:21] you as we get on in prayer tonight.
[41:23] Praise the
[41:42] Lord. Heat. Heat.

[1:34:43] decisions have fruits. The fruits are
[1:34:45] the results or the consequences of our
[1:34:47] decisions. And if we decide not to act,
[1:34:50] that is also a decision. But I don't
[1:34:52] think you have a choice tonight. You dig
[1:34:55] or you die. I hope that will register in
