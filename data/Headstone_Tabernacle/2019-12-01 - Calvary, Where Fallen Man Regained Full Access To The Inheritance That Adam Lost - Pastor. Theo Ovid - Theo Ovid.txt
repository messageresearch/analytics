amen god bless you thank you for coming welcome to our Sunday service and wanna go straight into the scriptures Matthew chapter 27 you want to read for 2754 Hebrews chapter 10 we wanna read verse 11 to 25 revelation 10 reading Matthew chapter 27 reading from verse 27 then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common Hall gathered unto him the old band of soldiers and they shipped him put on him a scarlet robe when they had planted a Croma thorns they put it upon his head read and I read in his right hand and they bowed and me before him and mocked him saying hail King of the Jews and they spit upon him took the reed smote him on the head and after that they had mocked him they took the rope off of him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him and as they came out they found a man of Cyrene Simon by name him they compel today his cross when they were come under pleasecall don't got a doesn't see a piece of a skull they give him vinegar to drink mingle with God and when he had tasted her off he would not drink and they crucified him and parted his garments casting Lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet departed my garment among them and upon my vesture they cast lots and sitting down they watched him there and set up over his head his accusation written this is Jesus the King of the Jews and then they were tooties crucified with him one on the right hand and the other on the left and he that passed by reviled him back in the head scene doll that destroys the temple and Billis it in three days save thyself if thou be the Son of God come down from the cross likewise also the chief priests mocking him seen what would X crime and he elder said he saved others himself he cannot see if he be the king of Israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him he trusted in God let him deliver him know if he will have him for he said I am the son of God the teams also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth now from all the sixth ah there was this darkness all over the land under the $9.00 about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli Eli lama sabachthani that is the say my God my God why hast thou forsaken me some of them that stood dear when they heard that said this one coffee lass it straight to be one of them around because punch filled with vinegar put it on a reed give him the drink and the rest said let be let us see whether he lies will come to save him and Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent and praying from the top to the bottom and it did quake rocks rent the graves are open many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went under the holy city and appeared at the many now when the Centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of God hebrews chapter 10 we were misled 11 and every priest and that daily ministering and offering of times the same sacrifice which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expect him till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he had perfected forever them that are sanctified we're off of the Holy Ghost also his witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more nowhere nowhere remission of sin is there is no more offering for sin having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way which he had consecrated for us through the veil that is to say is flesh and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of faith without wavering for he is faithful that's promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as we see that they approach it our last script of immersion 10 reading from verse 8 and the voice which I hid from heaven speaking to me again saying go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standard upon the scene upon the earth and I went into the angel and said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it heat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be 9 multitude as honey and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and eat it up it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I've eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many towns and nations and tongues peoples nations and tongues and kings may God bless the universe where you may be seated oh praise the name of the Lord it's so good to be here this Sunday morning we have a service this evening at 3 o clock so we see what the Lord will do

a possession they had never sought before and though they was dead and coarser joshua let them same people check them over for glory lord take them over [Music] [Applause] even in the land they be seized all MP was not circumcised had to be circumcised because you circumcision was an evidence of the covenant with God [Music] that was part of their ingrained culture to be circumcised that very first thing they made several who is that uncircumcised philistine the fiery army under he not even supposed to be here untrained David without the sword David nothing he's not supposed to be here because the land belong size once we are circumcised this man is odd come on priests back and he preached not to me somebody [Applause] the land belong to the circumcised and the circumcised has the authority to be in the land and the circumcised have to the authority to kick anything else out of the land now hear this one the same thing with divine healing God has power to heal you if you have got the courage to accepted but you fight every inch of the way God got Amazing Grace to save you and he will do it but you have to fight every inch of the way I have been behind the pulpit over 31 years and every inch of that has been a fight constantly Oh glory to God we must fight so we must find out what the bride has to do to make herself ready and be willing to lay aside every weight that

pure the love of God bless what could be no let a man sleep and bombs America he stressed when you have the joy of the Lord that is why when you see when things happen when you go negative and you can say rejoice regardless it confusion the devil because this job is to set your back you wanna take some more this act is a big worry you know what ill-temper does and that old temper is one of the awfulest holdings it's about 60% of the cause of you might get an area tear dump air oh god he'll ever come to you deliverance will come to her great you gonna come to your she gonna come to you because it is based upon forgiveness and that's the biggest blight in having this message on forgiving spirits people hold with bitterness and oughts and courage and hatefulness and they still in church when you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost it takes that old temper out of you it puts you on a dress and make you act like a lady it will make you quit your smokin drinkin lyin stealin and everything brother when you cut the baptism of the Holy Ghost it separates you and delivers you in the things of the world it make you love God it makes you go to church not stay home don't forsake

people who could stretch it along if you want is why somebody preaches this figure the longer they say be pulpit is more would appreciate I don't know just somehow missing I was he missing a tune you

rough and the grocery desert and all glory of God so it makes you love God it makes you better Church it makes you worship Him it makes you tell your neighbor about it it makes you live above sin that is what the Holy Ghost come to give you hallelujah but a man a beautiful gong of his promised word for the age that she livin and wrapped around her vindicating her with himself he call it the

can't miss the rapture because the rapture is in you oh let's go where Adam sinned by hidden to his wife's reasoning instead of holding the godswood that is what made Adam sin his wife reason with Seaton and then produced a product Adam I don't turn loose the word and sold out he lost also his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right to life so he lost everything his right to life his fellowship and as inheritance he lost everything and Satan waiting for the book because Satan know it have a deed it has some legal authority considered old because he is a squatter because he got kicked off heaven so he looking for some place at himself so he wanted always to be the Prince of the power of the air he wanted me charged he trial and skull up in heaven he had a lust in his heart to be like the Most High he wanted to have access to power and authority that was Satan wanted so when he form a cool and get some other bastard ninja with him to try to overthrow the throne of God Michel Fortin attacked and forth and then he got boots then he fell and he hurt and the back of angel became the back of men so he was always an agony looking at even know how godless man even when I was in spirit form in Genesis one Satan didn't Camaro Satan never come around he never come on Adam original spirit but when in Genesis 2 he formed man of the dust of the earth he push out on inside Allah and silla come along but when he Pilate by-products call Eve I went to work until the soil there come that slip devil talking to Adam life and that is hold the whole business either come inside idea that's all mine fell because Adam loved his wife and the whole tuition cell with him but God purpose to restore full access do you believe that hallelujah my God my God hallelujah praise God remember accesses permission Liberty ability to enter to approach pass to off from a place or to communicate with a person or thing so I have this written and I read this on Wednesday night and appendices on the issue has always been accessed upon Authority Lucifer he wanted to be like the Most High attempted a coup in heaven and even got some angels to make an effort a system to be in a position of authority that he can be worshipped and when the Battle of Angels fell on the earth man was no longer a spirit being as in Genesis one but now the spirit man was now in flesh as in Genesis

with woman anywhere at five Mandy once she wasn't what he is and so on he second vision he was you have seen her she see she's doing not support her family and she tells Jesus sir I perceive your profit and then Pharisees who installs for they read and listen to books and tips then being them studying whole day and night then call the devil an aroma and a woman who look and run on the outside

same one about crucifying becoming again oh then daddy eternal it is jumping on people or you think I'll make him joke with that I'm saying that you think or like preaching here is for this what to

what can I talk in the know talk when this written word becomes fresh rise up and walk in the name of Jesus great [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] America will be done this is it

Sarah look at me now although I want to examine all I see [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] already from them to get audience and I ready for them please God this preacher not easy I know I'm pissed I don't need no help so I wonder oh lord help me Jesus pray for me charity Ella calm down it paid your price suddenly Christian music on please but he did that that we could follow him what must be do the first thing I wanted you to see is this Jesus never live for himself his life was spent for others that is perfectly tuned their life when you see you go to church and you do good things and that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eaten life yet the eternal life is living for others and it proved it when it comes the Lamb of God and lift it up someone said how can you stand and let anybody call you bad names you don't lift yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you are taking Christ's place you are sons you don't live for yourself he said all my I hope this helps this tabernacle and all the people has got to and so on or praise the name of the Lord I'm gonna close the greater works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer or cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers the Holy Ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impact life that is what Calvary meant by given the Holy Ghost to obediently delivers men who owns unbelievers they made believers and impart spirit in their life so listen don't you see what the great thing is that's the greatest thing you could ever happen was to impart it in their life the people are closer to school I won't stop but I leave it alone this is super important listen close as we close that he's losin to something at Calvary God came down and took the body of his son in which he had lived he ripped it apart at Calvary his bleedin wounded cut the spear running there ripping apart his blood gushed out he said father into thy hands I commend my spirit he pulled his head and the earth shook lightning flashed and the thunder roared God was right in his everlasting covenant he took his dead body from the graves on the first day of the week and brought it up there from sack the others are the high priests of the memorial secondary forever get it out now and he sent the spirit that he taught all of that body right back down on the church and that church will have to have the same spirit that was in that body or it won't deal with it in the resurrection so the same spirit faithful to knowledge temperance patience called is political that has to be in the church same spirit to be taken away may the Lord bless you she received in prison [Music] [Applause] just raise the hands and

word I could find this morning was epic you know so I truly believe that we have turned a corner but random said anybody could build a straight wall but it take a real stonemason master Neeson to turn the corner and I believe as we come in on to the end of this season we have turned a corner and as we turn this corner I see the finish line right ahead because we don't have too much time left hallelujah and we have the access to get everything and we need to finish the rest of this journey can the church shame and hallelujah so we have some notes of praise I mean some prayer requests from Andy and sister Victoria and sister palm from mourning scenes after a wonderful service last Sunday Seaton tried to steal your joy by us being involved in a car accident on our way home but Satan is a liar he is defeated no one was hurt so we tangoed for life and faced mercy over our lives that's up that's a reason to thank God that's a reason to thank God hallelujah hallelujah and that's what a devil tries to do you know try to cut you off try to cut off Moses at the cutoff of Jesus but he can do it he could try but he can do it hallelujah hallelujah hmm another note of praise from Adam Michael Williams Tang in God after prayers was offered up for Jared Forbes last Sunday he's out of the coma home and doing well tank in the church and scenes for answered prayers still a prayer answering God never change never field seemed yesterday today and forever and whether Branham said it the same conditions are meant like wasn't a day of Pentecost it'll happen again if he did it for the sinner he could do it for you if he did it for the sick he could do it for you it doesn't matter what you did it's he doing the work and the church same and so as we approach the throne of grace we have prayer requests here for Josiah for DES there's a son of Berta Stephens friend who is severely ill is it Crohn's disease with Crohn's disease please fear for a total and complete healing and better Stephen says he believed that all things are possible through Christ and we know this to be the truth and nothing nothing but the truth and from sister Jonah who is leaving to go back to st. Vincent on Friday asking God for traveling mercies and if there's anyone in the house this morning that you didn't get to put a request but you have one in your heart that you want to show by raise of hands as we approach the throne of God collectively together this morning the Bible says if two shall agree touching anything so we come in agreement become an agreement as a church this morning no word has already gone forth and the word itself is power but this gospel is not in word only it is also in power and demonstration so we're looking for the word to be demonstrated this morning can we borrow here so we're afraid our gracious Heavenly Father we are so humbled Lord to walk in your presence a presence that we did nothing to deserve we did nothing to earn father every attempt that we have made to do right Lord has been a failure because without you we are nothing law we've thank you that Lord we could not even keep ourselves but you have been keeping us you have been holding our hands you have been guiding us how to walk where to walk when to go how to go in our moments of weakness Lord you are our strength because you taught us that your strength can only be made perfect when we are weak so we thank you for the mountains and we thank you for the valleys we thank you for the trials and the testings that you and your wisdom Lord send our way to build a character so we could be perfect and you could walk before you perfect as you said to Abraham Lord so many hundreds of years ago we thank you for this service this morning and how you use your man's servant Lord and the anointing Lord I was under word because the anointing itself is what makes the difference any man can read the structure but it takes the Holy Ghost up bring it to life a spiritual food in due season so we thank you for the spiritual food Lord that has been shared out this morning Lord from the banquet of heaven father we are full this morning and our cups are running over this morning Oh God but before we leave father we have requests that Lord have been presented to your throne for you to look over them and decide how to do father let me bring Josiah for before you Lord severely ill with Crohn's disease Lord and Lord every single disease he brought before you you had a remedy for every disease and even when Lazarus expire and tied up you were able to bring him back father so Lord as where the Stephens head we stand believing this morning that all things are possible through Christ we pray that angel of the Lord will find your side wherever years may you walk into the room where he is and may you touch him from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet Lord I made this request become a note of praise and unexplained note of praise Lord because it'll take the miracle-working power of God but transform things father me you step into this situation may you grant traveling mercies this is a Jonah as she journeys back to st. Vincent lo me you be with her I made a fire me anointing that she experiences here may she carry it with her and Lord for every hanok was raised all over the building I raised my hand also we come Lord humbly to your presence Lord taking you Lord for every promise that you have made belongs to us we hold on to the promises of God Lord for whatever our needs are this morning and we thank you in advance Lord for healing we thank you in advance for victory we thank you in advance for breakthrough we thank you in advance for working things out that we cannot fix we thank you in advance for making a way when there seems to be no way we thank you in advance for delivering our young people we thank you in advance for removing the tears of our eyes because you promised to wipe the tears away may you minister to your people may you bless Lord the remainder of the day and the services evening as we come back at 3:00 p.m. Lord for Lord a great responsibility you gave to us to do this in remembrance of you we don't want to be guilty of not remembering you father and you leave it in your word of what we must do to show that we remember you so we thank you for the service this evening Lord may you bless Lord Apostle give him strength north to come back behind the sacred desk this evening may you be with your people Lord may you bless those Lord adding up the meal between the services and so forth time be with your people in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen and amen you may be seated for a few announcements amen so service continues this evening at at 3:00 p.m. or last Lord's Supper of 2019 continues on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and Friday 7:30 p.m. and I want to encourage you as well if you have not heard last Wednesday service you need to listen to last Wednesday service and as it is approaching we're seeing something happening so can the church say Amen to save is continuous on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Friday at 7:30 p.m. and Tina's group 3pls meters by the Andy Henry after the second service evening service and so reminder to the church at large that our NFPA luncheon is on December 15 which is the two weeks away is it exactly two weeks away December 15 after the service and we really want to encourage everyone to participate for that end of year luncheon / Christmas / anniversary celebration so quite a lot will be going on a really tremendous menu and I would have said it's more than the food it's really a what a time of fellowship and coming together and Tankian God for taking us through another year and giving us the grace to see a new year and what God has in store for us as the last seconds of time finishes out as we blend in eternity amen so just as a reminder adults it's 125 for children under 10 at $70 and for children under 5 there is no charge we really want for catering purposes between this week and next week to be able to have a very good handle on the arrangement under catering and stuff like that so we really encourage you to see sister grace over it and just a crystal kindly after the service so either register or make payments so that we could have confirmation on the numbers and be able to put what is necessary for planning in place lasts and city not least one or make an announcement for all of the Sunday school children to meet right after the service downstairs there's something special planned for you so may the Lord bless you richly Deaconess ashes but I see one a man a man let's all stand one more time children meet your brother and sister the big smile very big smile really big smile this time man good to see everyone and God bless you tremendous service I bless your name [Music] I bless your name I bless your name I give you : I gave you on I give you praise I give you praise you are the life you are the truth the way the truth and the way I bless your name oh I bless your name Oh bless your name one more time I bless your name singer bless your Oh bless your day oh I gave you [Music] Lord I gave you brain oh you are the truth Lord I bless your oh yes Lord thank you Jesus amen amen you may be seated this morning OSHA's pretty good we are dismissed god bless you thank you [Music] daughter Susie [Music] Oh true oh yes for God bless your [Music] bless your name bless [Music] [Music] listen [Music] [Music] you
