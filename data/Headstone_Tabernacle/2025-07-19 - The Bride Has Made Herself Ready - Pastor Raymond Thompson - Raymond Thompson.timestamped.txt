[44:04] &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles, I'd like you to
[44:06] turn with me
[44:08] to the book of Psalms,
[44:11] reading from
[44:13] chapter 63, a couple of verses there.
[44:19] [Music]
[44:27] When you have it, say amen.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; It says, "Oh God, thou art my God. Early
[44:34] will I seek thee. My soul thirsteth for
[44:36] thee. My flesh longeth for thee in a dry
[44:38] and thirsty land where no water is.
[44:42] to see thy power and thy glory. So as I
[44:44] I have seen thee in the sanctuary
[44:48] because thy loving kindness is better
[44:50] than life. My lips shall praise thee.
[44:53] Thus will I bless thee while I live. I
[44:56] will lift up my hands in thy name. My
[44:59] soul shall be satisfied as with marrow
[45:01] and fatness, and my mouth shall praise
[45:03] thee with joyful lips.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Are you happy this morning?
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads open in a
[45:12] word of prayer.
[45:15] Oh heavenly father, Lord, we are so
[45:19] grateful. We're so thankful. We feel so
[45:21] honored and privileged, Lord, that you
[45:23] considered us to be here this morning.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Lord, out of everywhere that we could
[45:27] have been and all those who could have
[45:28] been here, Lord, Lord, that you
[45:30] predestinated us for this hour.

[45:34] you're about to do, Lord. Lord, we pray
[45:36] that that you will accept our praise,
[45:39] Lord. That you will inhabit our worship,

[45:47] we praise and we worship you. We honor
[45:50] you. We bless your name, Lord. And we
[45:52] are gathered under expectation for the
[45:54] miraculous to take place, Lord. Lord,
[45:56] have your way among us. Bless your
[45:58] musicians, singers, worshippers, Lord,
[46:01] the ministers, the the folks that will
[46:04] greet, Lord, and would share, Lord. God,
[46:05] I pray that you take full control over
[46:07] everything that is said, everything that
[46:09] is done. We want to be careful to give
[46:11] you all the praise, honor, glory, and
[46:13] worship to your name, Lord. Lord, we
[46:15] pray that you will fall down and pour
[46:17] out your spirit like never before, Lord.
[46:20] That no one will come here and leave the
[46:22] same way that they came, Lord. That
[46:24] lives will change and transformed. That
[46:26] hearts will be renewed. That minds will
[46:28] be opened, Lord. That they could hear
[46:30] direct from you. Speak lip to air to
[46:32] your people tonight, this morning, Lord.
[46:35] Lord, and I pray that you'll have your
[46:37] preeminence over everything that is said
[46:38] and done in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.

[1:16:45] scripture before we make any comments.
[1:16:47] Amen. Just want to read a little portion
[1:16:48] from St. Luke chapter 7. What it says
[1:16:51] here.

[1:17:07] unto one, go, and he goeth. Unto
[1:17:09] another, come, and he cometh. unto my
[1:17:10] servant, do this, and he doeth it. When

[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; He marveled at him and turned him about
[1:17:20] and said unto the people that followed
[1:17:22] him, I s I have not found so great
[1:17:24] faith. No, not in Israel. May the Lord
[1:17:27] as blessing to the scriptures, you may
[1:17:29] enjoy the comfort of your seats. Amen.

[1:18:05] time,
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; we in the time of adoption. God is going
[1:18:09] to do something, friends. And we're
[1:18:10] going to read a little quote here just
[1:18:11] to see a little something else for a
[1:18:12] little 10 minutes quickly that we can
[1:18:14] try to understand where we located, what
[1:18:15] God is doing right now.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; We believe that we are the final voice
[1:18:18] to the final age.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; That's who we are. The bride has a
[1:18:21] voice.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride will leave here
[1:18:25] tremendous. She will leave here with
[1:18:26] power. She will leave her with glory
[1:18:27] because God said so.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we want to we want to give God
[1:18:31] thanks. You know we had a little uh
[1:18:33] brother read a quote and he talk about
[1:18:35] uh the uh miraculous two miraculous
[1:18:38] meeting and and when God is doing
[1:18:39] something he bring it with power
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; and he said we on the verge and
[1:18:43] something is happening on the earth
[1:18:44] right now
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; and then here we had brother uh uh
[1:18:47] brother
[1:18:49] uh uh this brother Josh and he start to
[1:18:52] speak about the gentile warriors
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; and that's who we are so so everything
[1:18:56] is coming into in in in a unity amen
[1:18:59] it's coming inside us so we have these
[1:19:01] warriors Yes, that's who we are this
[1:19:02] morning
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; to bring a clean fresh drink for the
[1:19:05] king.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; And then we had brother brother Shem
[1:19:07] come and he let us know, hey, this can't
[1:19:09] work without the love of God.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; The love of God had to work this thing.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, it cannot. Amen.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; And and then we had brother Stephan last
[1:19:16] night talk about, you know, the shina
[1:19:18] glory
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; and we fellowship him with this mystery
[1:19:21] and this glory. So we we come to to
[1:19:24] continue this this this talking because
[1:19:26] I believe that the church is on the
[1:19:29] their place. She's on the verge. season
[1:19:31] and a place right now to shoot for this
[1:19:33] power that God has released to the
[1:19:35] church, friends. Amen. We don't want to
[1:19:37] just walk around and barely get along
[1:19:39] street. Amen. There's a power in us that
[1:19:41] God has invested in the church of the
[1:19:44] living God. Amen. And the devil had to
[1:19:46] flee when this bride is on the scene
[1:19:48] this morning. Amen. So here the prophet
[1:19:50] is telling us in the beginning was the
[1:19:53] word. Now as far as your mental theology
[1:19:56] could think the the the word before it
[1:19:58] was a word, there's a thought.
[1:20:00] And Moses said in the beginning
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; and John said in the beginning but then
[1:20:05] when the prophet came he said we're
[1:20:06] going to go before the beginning. Before
[1:20:08] the beginning in God's mind where we
[1:20:10] were as the thoughts of almighty God
[1:20:13] that's who we are and that power amen
[1:20:16] has invested in this bride in the
[1:20:18] thoughts and these thoughts now are
[1:20:19] manifested on the earth.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; So we've been the thoughts of God have a
[1:20:24] quality in God gene. We belong to God so
[1:20:27] so strong that we have the attributes of
[1:20:30] God in us. So we're going to be like God
[1:20:32] is a promise in the word. But in the
[1:20:34] beginning the man fell. He lost his
[1:20:37] godship. He lost his sunship. But
[1:20:39] something is happening. Amen. In this
[1:20:41] season God has sent a word. The seals
[1:20:44] has been revealed. The book has been
[1:20:46] opened. And now God a people is on the
[1:20:48] earth where God is going to deal with
[1:20:50] this people what he did what he promised
[1:20:52] in the word. She's going to have that
[1:20:54] power. He's going to have that
[1:20:56] authority. And here he's telling us
[1:20:58] here, we go right back to Genesis again
[1:21:00] in the original. What is it? It's God
[1:21:03] moving. His nature is groaning. There's
[1:21:05] crying. Everything is moving for what?
[1:21:07] The manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Listen. When true sons,
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; born sons, fil sons speak and their word
[1:21:17] is backed up. And that God is here this
[1:21:19] morning to back up your word that the
[1:21:22] bride is speaking this morning. It's
[1:21:23] moving forward with that power. Listen
[1:21:25] carefully. He had a prophet. What kind
[1:21:28] of people would we be this morning?
[1:21:30] Amen.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; He says if the brand tabernacle
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; I am saying if this headstone tabernacle
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; if this convention this morning
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; was so filled with the presence of God
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; by when you didn't even use your own
[1:21:44] mind
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; not even your own thoughts not your own
[1:21:47] alternative but there are sons of God
[1:21:51] led by the spirits of God when the human
[1:21:54] element goes out and the spirit of God
[1:21:56] fills the vacancy.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. where you are empty, empty
[1:22:01] yourself. Then will be when the church
[1:22:04] in its power of the resurrection of the
[1:22:08] Lord Jesus Christ will walk in his
[1:22:10] steps,
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; in his power, in his thoughts, in his
[1:22:13] being, in his moving. Amen. Hear what he
[1:22:16] says quickly. Now he says, then your
[1:22:18] will, your thoughts will become words
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; and your words will become material.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; That's when the church in its power.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; You believe this morning, friends? I
[1:22:28] believe to be on the road right now. I
[1:22:30] believe she's on the verge. I believe
[1:22:33] what is happening upon the earth. The
[1:22:35] bride is ready. Amen. Satan is already
[1:22:37] defeated.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Here is this brightest morning, friends.
[1:22:40] We on the road with the power of God to
[1:22:43] move all the thing that was lost.
[1:22:45] Brothers, restored his back to the
[1:22:47] church. She's here this morning to
[1:22:49] manifest the power of God again. Amen.
[1:22:51] One piece again. Here it says, I believe
[1:22:53] it's on this road.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:55] When the church will be so wrapped in
[1:22:58] Christ,
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit,
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; mankind so away from themselves,
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; he says, and their thoughts move on,
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; they refuse the things of the world.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; They just move in the spirit.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; They live in the spirit.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; They walk in the spirit.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; So fulfilling love of Christ. Then the
[1:23:18] love of Christ, here it is. Now
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; it come back. the love of Christ will go
[1:23:23] forth with the power and deity because
[1:23:27] deity will be revealed in human beings
[1:23:30] by the Holy Spirit. We believe this
[1:23:32] morning, friends, that deity is here.
[1:23:34] He's in the bride. He's moving to bring
[1:23:37] it to pass. God bless you this morning
[1:23:39] as we continue to give God the praise.
[1:23:41] He's worthy of it. Amen. God bless you
[1:23:43] this morning.

[1:31:05] kindness.
[1:31:08] So, thank you. It's all been just a
[1:31:09] blessing. Shall we bow for pray?
[1:31:11] Heavenly Father, we come in the name of
[1:31:13] Jesus. We thank you for this beautiful
[1:31:16] day, Lord, and that your church can
[1:31:18] gather in this fashion. You promise
[1:31:20] where two or three is gather in my name,
[1:31:21] I'll be there, Lord. And we just want to
[1:31:24] say thank you for your presence. We feel
[1:31:26] and fell during these meetings, Lord,
[1:31:28] another meeting. And we welcome your
[1:31:30] presence, Lord. We didn't come to see
[1:31:32] brother Raymond. We come to see Jesus.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, man is out of the picture and
[1:31:36] Christ is on the scene.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; So may the Holy Spirit take over, Lord.
[1:31:41] May the mind of Christ drop down as our
[1:31:43] brother Norris just spoke and may it
[1:31:45] speak Lord. Our thoughts become your
[1:31:47] thoughts. Our words become your words
[1:31:49] Lord. And Father, this message is
[1:31:52] anointed. So is your word. But we need
[1:31:54] the anointing of the Holy Spirit to
[1:31:56] blend in and become one with this word
[1:31:58] Lord. So bless everything that will be
[1:32:00] said and we commit everything into your
[1:32:02] hands in Jesus precious name we ask it.
[1:32:05] Amen. And the great church shall say
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; I didn't hear that. The great church
[1:32:11] shall say
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; God richly bless you. Amen.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; So uh while we standing
[1:32:22] just two portions of scripture
[1:32:29] it's uh
[1:32:32] Hebrews 12 1 and 2
[1:32:37] and then Revelations
[1:32:39] 19:7.
[1:32:44] If you have it, say amen.
[1:32:47] Wherefore seen we are compassed about
[1:32:49] with so great cloud of witnesses, let us
[1:32:53] lay aside every weight and sin which dot
[1:32:57] so easily beset us. And let us run with
[1:33:00] patience the race that is set before us,
[1:33:04] looking unto Jesus, the author and
[1:33:07] finisher of our faith. Who for the joy
[1:33:10] that was set before him endured the
[1:33:12] cross, despising the shame, and he sat
[1:33:16] down at the right hand of the throne of
[1:33:18] God.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; So, we have to lay aside
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; the weight and the sin that bogs us
[1:33:27] down. Amen.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we go to Revelations
[1:33:30] 19:7.
[1:33:32] Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:33:34] honor to him.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; For the marriage of the Lamb is come,
[1:33:37] and his wife has made herself ready. And
[1:33:40] to her was granted that she uh should be
[1:33:44] arrayed in fine linen, clean and white,
[1:33:47] for the linen, fine linen is the
[1:33:49] righteousness of the saints.
[1:33:51] Amen. And he says here, "And he said
[1:33:53] unto me, write blessed are they which
[1:33:56] are called unto the marriage supper of
[1:33:58] the lamb, and he saith unto me, these
[1:34:01] are the true saints of God."
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; So may he bless the reading of his word.
[1:34:06] You may be seated.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:14] So uh just reading the scripture brother
[1:34:18] Benham says that you are blessed just by
[1:34:21] being called.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; You are blessed just by being called.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; And I believe in this meetings there's
[1:34:28] almost I won't say it's the final call
[1:34:30] but it could be the last call
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; to individuals.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; And I this morning I want you to know
[1:34:37] I'm going to preach to individuals.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Beautiful group,
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; beautiful church. Amen.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Beautiful friends we have in the church
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; speaking to individuals this morning.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So may God bless you.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; I got a title here. The bride has made
[1:34:54] herself ready.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Now uh many times we can preach as a
[1:34:59] brother Norris and I told brother Isaac
[1:35:01] it's so easy. I have a message lined up
[1:35:03] here and I was praying till about half
[1:35:05] three this morning. Lord which way do I
[1:35:07] go? Because it's easy to say you
[1:35:09] predestinated your name is in a book.
[1:35:11] It's easy like that
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; and it's it sort of puts a general thing
[1:35:15] over you and many people feel once I
[1:35:17] hear that I can just sit back and I
[1:35:20] don't have to do nothing I'm going to
[1:35:21] heaven
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; but the the Bible says
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; now this is a bit different and I want
[1:35:27] you to listen as an individual
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; and I said Lord do I do it so easy to
[1:35:32] preach a message it just flows and runs
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; but to preach this is going to be very
[1:35:36] hard
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; but it's going to make you ready
[1:35:41] is going to prepare you.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; It's going to do something to the inner
[1:35:44] man.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; And if you take it,
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; you're going to make the rapture.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Just a little more on the on the on the
[1:35:54] speakers. Thank you.
[1:35:56] So, uh,
[1:35:59] he says here in sudden secret. So, I'm
[1:36:01] going to float on the coach because I
[1:36:03] have to preach another me message on
[1:36:05] Sunday. So, uh, I don't want to get too
[1:36:07] anointed
[1:36:09] because then I'll be going down the
[1:36:10] aisle and if you don't aim in at the
[1:36:12] back there, I'm going to come shake your
[1:36:14] hand.
[1:36:16] So, I need you to preach back to me.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; You know what brother Brandham says? The
[1:36:21] guy came to the service and he said,
[1:36:22] "Brother Brandom, I enjoyed your service
[1:36:24] until that lady screamed and cried."
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "If she didn't do it, I can't
[1:36:28] preach."
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; So, if you don't amen and do that, I
[1:36:32] can't preach.
[1:36:38] So you have your part to play. I have my
[1:36:40] part to play.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; So if you sit there with a long face and
[1:36:43] folded arms and I get mind battles.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; But when you preach back man kawa preach
[1:36:49] it then I know I can preach the word. I
[1:36:52] can say anything I want to. The Holy
[1:36:54] Spirit will anoint it.
[1:36:56] [Applause]
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; And it we should be matured Christians
[1:37:01] by now. We long in the message. We don't
[1:37:03] have to keep saying these things to the
[1:37:04] people. You should know by now. The
[1:37:06] preacher, the preacher labored how many
[1:37:09] hours to study that message. And when he
[1:37:11] comes and preach it, you sit there and
[1:37:12] look at him.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Brother, it should be a shame on you,
[1:37:15] sister. Shame on you, brother. It should
[1:37:17] be a place where we say, "Come on,
[1:37:20] preach it, pastor. I need it. I want it.
[1:37:22] I need to be right with God."
[1:37:26] Amen. We tired. We old men.
[1:37:30] But we can't at this late stage still
[1:37:32] come and uh beg people to worship,
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; beg people to come to church. And you're
[1:37:38] going to find out this message, if you
[1:37:39] don't prepare, you're not going to make
[1:37:41] it for the rapture.
[1:37:45] [Applause]
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; They have to, brother Theo. We have to.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you think it's easy for the
[1:37:54] preacher. Brother says, "Sometimes it's
[1:37:56] harder for the preacher than the people
[1:37:58] in the bench.
[1:38:00] cuz you don't know what we go through.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; And we can't tell you everything we're
[1:38:03] going through.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; So what you must do, lift our hands up,
[1:38:09] man.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; We're tired and weary, but lift our
[1:38:11] hands up. I'm lifting brother Theo's
[1:38:14] hands up. I'm keeping it there. He's
[1:38:16] tired and weary. So am I. And many. But
[1:38:18] keep the hands up.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; And while the hands is up, Israel won.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; You don't want defeat in the church.
[1:38:26] keep his hands up and you'll stay in
[1:38:29] victory.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; So he says he has sudden secret.
[1:38:45] If that isn't just about the way the
[1:38:47] world, you may see that he's saying
[1:38:48] today about the coming of the Lord. Your
[1:38:50] oldfashioned folky back numbers, what
[1:38:52] makes you dress and act the way you do?
[1:38:55] But we're looking for the secret sudden
[1:38:57] appearing of the Lord.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; For there's something in the air.
[1:39:00] Listen,
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; a message
[1:39:03] of the Holy Spirit
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; that tells us the coming of the Lord is
[1:39:06] at hand.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; So that's why I say individuals is going
[1:39:10] to pick it up. There's a message already
[1:39:12] in the air.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; It's in the air.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; That the coming of the Lord is here.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to say something. You
[1:39:19] watch nature. When winter comes, it
[1:39:22] kills everything.
[1:39:24] The leaves get dried, falls off.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; But you know what? When summer comes
[1:39:28] around, there's a silent secret that
[1:39:31] goes out.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; We don't hear it. But nature hears it.
[1:39:36] And before you know, here come the
[1:39:37] leaves. Here come the branches. Here
[1:39:40] everything. Why? There's a sudden secret
[1:39:42] message that goes out. And brother Bam
[1:39:45] says there's a message in the air that
[1:39:48] the Holy Ghost is telling us the coming
[1:39:50] of the Lord is here.
[1:39:55] So, we can't play around. We can't take
[1:39:57] chances. We can't say, "I'm going back
[1:39:59] to the world." It's too late.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Too late. Brother Goi,
[1:40:09] [Applause]
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Theo, I said at home in my time
[1:40:14] when I got saved in 1967,
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; they did the twist. You know the twist.
[1:40:19] Then this what they were doing. I said,
[1:40:21] "If I go back now, they're dancing on
[1:40:23] the head. How am I going to do that?
[1:40:26] It's too late to go back. Man, it's
[1:40:29] easier to go forward because on the
[1:40:31] other side, they're saying, "Come on.
[1:40:33] Come on. You're almost home. Keep
[1:40:35] pressing. Keep going. Keep coming."
[1:40:42] Listen what he says. You may be seated.
[1:40:44] What we need today in this pullpit is
[1:40:46] prophets of the Lord who is not afraid
[1:40:48] to blast out God's thunderbolts of
[1:40:51] judgment upon this generation of sinful
[1:40:54] people that we preach to. We need
[1:40:56] prophets like Isaiah who cried out a
[1:40:58] weaker generation how that he did
[1:41:00] condemn that generation and tell them of
[1:41:03] the coming judgments. What is it today?
[1:41:06] That education in societies and little
[1:41:08] frenentical
[1:41:10] delicate things of societies, their own
[1:41:13] feelings has took the place of the Holy
[1:41:15] Ghost in the church. Watch what we need
[1:41:17] today is cry out.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; America is a godsend, godful man with
[1:41:22] the power of the Holy Ghost who is not
[1:41:24] afraid to cry out against the thing
[1:41:26] that's wrong and warn the people of
[1:41:28] oncoming judgment.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; So I'm here to speak to individuals. The
[1:41:32] coming of the Lord is upon us. The
[1:41:34] coming of judgment is here. We need to
[1:41:36] be right with God. We can't wait until
[1:41:39] this happened. Until that happened. Come
[1:41:41] and tell you something. You may be
[1:41:42] seated.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; I was telling the brothers, you know,
[1:41:46] when you look at the political stage and
[1:41:48] you look at the world, the stage he
[1:41:50] said, brother Goki
[1:41:54] and brother Isaac that everyone was
[1:41:55] preaching on the pope and things. We
[1:41:57] preach those years back.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; We knew he's coming out of America. We
[1:42:01] knew Israel will do that. We knew
[1:42:03] America will be the image. But now the
[1:42:05] stage is set.
[1:42:07] So when we look at the stage, there's
[1:42:09] Israel. We look at the pope, there's a
[1:42:11] pope. We look at the Rome, there's Rome,
[1:42:14] the World Council of Churches. We look
[1:42:15] at America image of peace, they're there
[1:42:17] on the stage. We look at Russia on the
[1:42:20] stage. So when we look at God's stage,
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; it's complete.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Everything is there.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; But brother, I'm not worried about that.
[1:42:30] You know what I'm worried about? How to
[1:42:32] go in the rapture?
[1:42:36] How do we get out of here? This man in
[1:42:40] Rome is not for me.
[1:42:43] Russia's not for you. But the rapture is
[1:42:46] for you. There's a coming of the Lord.
[1:42:49] And we got to get out of here. And what
[1:42:52] what prepares you for that is these
[1:42:54] seven thunders that will show the bride
[1:42:56] how to go, brother. how to get out of
[1:42:59] here. That's what I'm interested in.
[1:43:02] Don't tell me of Rome. Don't tell me of
[1:43:04] the Pope. Don't tell me of that. Tell me
[1:43:07] how to get out of here.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[1:43:26] This the stage is set man.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; So so why must I go back and preach on
[1:43:33] that?
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; We just seen the fulfillment of it.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; So we can say this day the prophecy is
[1:43:39] fulfilled.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's fulfilled.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Pop out of America. Russia doing up
[1:43:45] thing. Israel recognizing the position.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:50] Brother Brim says, "And before he can go
[1:43:52] back to Israel in his fullness, the
[1:43:55] Gentile bride must get out of the way."
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; So today, you can't keep up the rapture
[1:44:01] anymore
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; because the bride that's elected will
[1:44:05] make herself ready.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; So you better be sure you're elected.
[1:44:10] Get sure that and make sure in this
[1:44:11] meetings, Lord, I want to be right. I
[1:44:15] don't want to come to another convention
[1:44:16] and go back and do the same thing. I
[1:44:18] want to go a changed person filled with
[1:44:21] the Holy Ghost, anointed with the power
[1:44:23] of God.
[1:44:26] Young man, young girl, God has given you
[1:44:28] another chance. Mother Father,
[1:44:30] [Applause]
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Brother, I came here to put my shoulder
[1:44:34] to the wheel to make this thing work, to
[1:44:37] make the people get ready. The Holy
[1:44:40] Ghost will make you ready, brother. And
[1:44:42] if you if you disobedient, he'll bring
[1:44:44] you to a place
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; where you have to heal yourself
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; and it might be a hard thing.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; You know what he says? If mother don't
[1:44:55] want to walk straight,
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; he takes the lamb.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; And then mama must look up
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; cuz God took the lamb. Cuz mama don't
[1:45:05] want to walk straight.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; It's time we line up, friends.
[1:45:09] It's later than what we think it is.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit tell us there's
[1:45:16] something there. What we need today is
[1:45:18] pulpits. He says the wicked generation.
[1:45:21] What is it today? Education in all this.
[1:45:24] We need today a cry. He says I'm not
[1:45:26] afraid to cry against the thing wrong
[1:45:29] and warn the people of the oncoming
[1:45:30] judgment.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Now you know me. I could have preached a
[1:45:33] very a positive message but something
[1:45:35] told me half past 3 this morning. Preach
[1:45:37] this.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; God won't let the church exist long
[1:45:40] under such conditions.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; And the world is corrupted. Politics is
[1:45:44] corrupted. The church is corrupted. What
[1:45:46] we need today is more to do more about
[1:45:49] it.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; God-fearing people
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; to get together and call on the name of
[1:45:55] the Lord. That's what the brand table
[1:45:58] needs to do is get together. Listen, get
[1:46:01] together and call upon the name of the
[1:46:03] Lord. So when you see these things
[1:46:06] happen, what do we do? We don't stay
[1:46:08] away from church, we don't have to beg
[1:46:10] the people to come. No, you come to
[1:46:12] church and the pastor calls a prayer
[1:46:14] meeting. You make sure you're there,
[1:46:16] brother, because the coming of the Lord
[1:46:17] is upon us.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; And the bride has made herself ready.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; We're going to find out who's bride and
[1:46:25] who's not bride, brother.
[1:46:31] He says you won't let the list Brandon
[1:46:33] Tabern Tabernacle still on the same
[1:46:36] compromising preachers. What we need is
[1:46:38] an oldfashioned God- sent heavenborn
[1:46:40] preachers who will tell the truth
[1:46:42] regardless of who it hurts. Like John
[1:46:45] said, the ax is laid to the root of the
[1:46:47] tree and every tree that bringeth forth
[1:46:49] good fruit uh bringeth forth uh fruit is
[1:46:53] bringeth not forth good fruit. It's
[1:46:55] yuned down and cast in the fire. We need
[1:46:57] precious prophets like that who will
[1:47:00] bombard and use the judgments of God for
[1:47:03] ammunition to tear out this wicked
[1:47:05] condition that we living in. And that's
[1:47:07] how I feel this morning. If you're not
[1:47:10] living right, the Holy Spirit is here to
[1:47:12] tear out that condition, break it apart.
[1:47:15] The judgment of God is here, brother.
[1:47:18] And I'm using the ammunition from
[1:47:20] Brother Brenham,
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit is here to back it
[1:47:25] up. And if you don't listen to the Holy
[1:47:27] Spirit, then you will have to suffer for
[1:47:29] it.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; But if you listen, my brother, sister,
[1:47:32] hey, if you listen, my brother, you will
[1:47:35] win, man. You will go in the rapture.
[1:47:37] You will be changed. You will be
[1:47:39] anointed.
[1:47:40] [Applause]
[1:47:44] He says you can never r sin by patting
[1:47:46] it on the back. You can never r sin by
[1:47:48] educating people. Our programs has
[1:47:51] become demolished, have failed. There's
[1:47:53] only one remedy for sin and that is
[1:47:55] Christ. He's the remedy and not Christ
[1:47:58] through intellectual
[1:48:00] confession. And that's what the Holy
[1:48:03] Spirit is busting.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Too many people know him by intellect.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; You know him by intellectual
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; but nothing in the heart.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; So you come here with your intellectual
[1:48:14] and say why does he say that? You
[1:48:16] judging with your intellectual. Judge
[1:48:18] with your heart and say God is that you
[1:48:20] speaking to me, not your intellectuals.
[1:48:23] Your intellectuals will fail, brother.
[1:48:26] But this can't fail. And if God is
[1:48:28] speaking to this, you better respond.
[1:48:31] And if you are living up here, you will
[1:48:34] walk out of the service and say, I want
[1:48:36] to have nothing to do with that people.
[1:48:38] Because you judge it with your
[1:48:39] intellect.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:43] Hallelujah.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:48:49] Away with that intellectualism.
[1:48:51] You know, brother, the preachers now
[1:48:52] want intellect. They give motivational
[1:48:56] speakers. They give lectures.
[1:48:58] They don't want noise in the church.
[1:49:00] Everyone must sit quiet. Nonsense, man.
[1:49:03] We want God's children to be on fire for
[1:49:06] God.
[1:49:08] I'm not here to give a motivational
[1:49:10] speak. I'm not here to lecture to you,
[1:49:13] but I'm here to bust that spirit. that
[1:49:16] spirit that's on you. I'm busting that
[1:49:18] spirit this morning.
[1:49:21] Go free, man.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Tell the devil, I'm free.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; No more are you going to keep me bound.
[1:49:27] No more are you going to let me be like
[1:49:30] this. I'm free.
[1:49:34] [Music]
[1:49:45] He says, "Listen here, and not Christ
[1:49:47] through intellectual confession, but
[1:49:49] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; to a new life
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; and a a generation that's that uh that
[1:49:56] that's the only remedy for sin. The only
[1:49:59] remedy for a nation is the only remedy
[1:50:01] for this church and all of us. It's the
[1:50:04] only remedy for the people. Amen.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; It's the only remedy for you that's
[1:50:08] watching on the line.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Even my church, if you're watching, it's
[1:50:11] the only remedy. We can't pat sin on the
[1:50:14] back.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; But where's Christ? Yes. Grace. He's the
[1:50:19] only one that can set you free, man.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:50:26] What we need today is is calling
[1:50:28] together, getting ready, not depending
[1:50:31] on the preacher.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; And that's a trouble in the church
[1:50:34] again. We don't come with our own fire.
[1:50:37] We don't come anointed. The chorus
[1:50:38] leader must sing us on fire. Brother
[1:50:40] Theon, Brother Isaac must preach you on
[1:50:42] fire. Man, you must have your own fire.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; We so long in a message, but we still
[1:50:47] come get to service.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; You must have your own fire.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; We must not even be able to preach
[1:50:54] because the place is filled with fire.
[1:50:56] The glory cloud is all here.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Come with your own fire. Don't depend on
[1:51:02] the preacher. depend on yourself. You're
[1:51:05] an individual. I must be on fire.
[1:51:16] [Applause]
[1:51:24] And that depon depending on the
[1:51:25] preacher, but you as an individual
[1:51:27] before God, make yourself ready for the
[1:51:30] coming of the Lord to escape the
[1:51:33] corruption.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Now you're going to find out, brother,
[1:51:36] why are you preaching like this? If you
[1:51:38] know what is coming,
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; you'll be running to this altar
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; and laying aside the weight and the sin
[1:51:45] that has so easily beset you.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; You'll be running away, friend, if you
[1:51:50] know what is coming.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Some people say, "Well, I go to church
[1:51:53] on Sunday morning. I listen to our
[1:51:56] pastor." Which is fine. Which is fine. A
[1:51:59] fine preacher. That's good. I appreciate
[1:52:01] that. And you are in America, the world
[1:52:03] way over. But takes more than a good
[1:52:06] message from the pulpit.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; It takes your life.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; It takes you to get ready.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Did you hear that? So I'm a good
[1:52:16] Christian. I come to church. I listen to
[1:52:17] a good sermon. I go back and I feel
[1:52:19] good. He said, "But that's not it."
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; You must have a change of life.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; The life must come into you. It takes a
[1:52:28] life and it takes you to get ready,
[1:52:30] brother. Oh guys, can you give me more
[1:52:34] poo here?
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; In Revelations 19th chapter 7 verse the
[1:52:38] Bible said that speaking of the bride of
[1:52:40] Christ, she has made herself ready. She
[1:52:42] made herself ready. And you as a member
[1:52:44] of the bride, you got to make yourself
[1:52:48] ready.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, how many of you all perhaps have
[1:52:52] read of the virgins? Some are wise and
[1:52:55] some were foolish.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Virgin means purity.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; And they were all good people.
[1:53:01] Now please I want you to listen to this.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; You know the five wise wasn't separate
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; and the five foolish wasn't separate.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; They were all in one church.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; So you couldn't say that's foolish,
[1:53:17] that's wise, that's fool. No, it
[1:53:19] couldn't.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; They were all in the same church.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; They were all in the message.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Please listen to this.
[1:53:37] It says everyone there with them,
[1:53:39] virgins, sanctified vessels of God.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; But those who had oil in their lamp,
[1:53:45] listen, they went in.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; The others was left out.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; They were all virgins. Everyone
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; people that you couldn't put a finger on
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; anything wrong. They everyone believed
[1:53:58] in the coming of the Lord. Watch. They
[1:54:00] were ready to go meet him.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; But some of them left. Let the oil go
[1:54:06] out.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, please listen, friend. Don't let
[1:54:09] nothing distract you.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Don't. He says, "Don't let be don't let
[1:54:14] that be your case.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Keep oil in your lamp." What is the oil?
[1:54:18] The Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit. Never
[1:54:22] let it drain from you. When you feel
[1:54:24] your love is dying away, your sincerity
[1:54:27] to Christ, he says, and quickly go to
[1:54:30] him who has the fountain of oil to buy
[1:54:33] for yourself a filling of the Holy
[1:54:35] Ghost. I say in this meetings if you
[1:54:38] feel that your oil has drained out no
[1:54:41] more joy no more happiness no more
[1:54:43] prayer revail when you feel you're
[1:54:45] losing that quickly
[1:54:48] not slowly run to him that has the oil
[1:54:52] the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:54:59] my my
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; glory be to God.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; It says here
[1:55:08] questions and answers, brothers. When
[1:55:11] you see the fig tree putting forth their
[1:55:12] butts,
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; it says here
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:55:31] Okay, it says here
[1:55:33] every one of them was virgin.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Don't let it be your case. So I said I'm
[1:55:38] speaking to individuals.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; So don't let it be your case. Don't say
[1:55:42] when I'm preaching, oh she needs that or
[1:55:45] I hope she hears it.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; I hope he heard it.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; No, brother. That's a wrong motive.
[1:55:52] But did you say Lord what about me?
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Do I have oil in my land?
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; So it takes it away from the group. It
[1:56:00] now puts it on the individual.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; You can't even speak for your wife.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; You can't even speak for your husband.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; You can't speak for your children.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; But you got to have enough oil for
[1:56:14] yourself.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; And you're going to find out there comes
[1:56:17] a time when it runs out. Now you can't
[1:56:21] wait till that time
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; because at midnight oh
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; something laying here at midnight
[1:56:28] brother Olu the bridegroom came
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; and the shout went out behold the
[1:56:34] bridegroom cometh
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; it was at midnight
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; if you go to Egypt when they apply the
[1:56:39] blood it was at midnight when the death
[1:56:42] angel sweep into the country I want to
[1:56:44] tell you friend it's about midnight if
[1:56:47] you don't have the blood I tell you the
[1:56:49] Death angel is going to take so many
[1:56:51] people out. He's already packed out so
[1:56:53] many people. They don't have joy. They
[1:56:56] don't have love. They don't have
[1:56:57] forgiveness. They're walking with
[1:56:59] malice. They're walking with jealousy.
[1:57:02] So many things are they already
[1:57:03] spiritually dead. Nothing can move them.
[1:57:06] But I'm here to tell you, the Holy
[1:57:08] Spirit is here. He moves above this man.
[1:57:11] He moves above me. He can go into your
[1:57:13] heart. Turn it around, brother. mess up
[1:57:16] that whole thing and put the Holy Spirit
[1:57:18] in there. Don't you want that this
[1:57:20] morning? Don't you want to say, "God, I
[1:57:22] want to be ready when this thing
[1:57:24] happened. I don't want to be caught."
[1:57:26] Not
[1:57:29] want to be ready, Lord.
[1:57:31] Did you ever see a wedding? How that
[1:57:33] bride dresses herself? She prepares. She
[1:57:37] gets the veil. She gets a dress. She
[1:57:40] gets all the ornaments. She's ready.
[1:57:42] Why? Because she's the bride. Amen.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; She makes herself ready for who? For the
[1:57:47] bridegroom. I want to tell you this
[1:57:50] bride. Hey, there's something about her.
[1:57:52] She doesn't care about the world. She
[1:57:55] doesn't care who's the next president.
[1:57:56] She's not worried about Mr. Trump. She's
[1:57:59] not worried what's happening and and the
[1:58:01] petrol and the inflation. No, she's
[1:58:04] worried about the husband. When he
[1:58:06] comes, will I be ready? That's the
[1:58:09] question, brother. Are you ready for the
[1:58:12] bridegroom?
[1:58:19] [Music]
[1:58:23] [Applause]
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "This generation will not
[1:58:32] pass."
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; And look at the coming revival going to
[1:58:37] the Jews. They're watching for the
[1:58:39] coming Messiah. If you look now, the
[1:58:40] Jews,
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; they're back in the homeland. They're
[1:58:42] watching for the coming Messiah
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; and the church spiritual, the bride,
[1:58:48] uh, the virgins with oil in the lambs
[1:58:51] will go into the wedding supper. So, as
[1:58:54] they are watching for the bridegroom, so
[1:58:56] is the gentile bride watching for the
[1:58:59] Oh, come on now.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; You see, there's the same thing. God
[1:59:02] can't deal, brother Olu, with the Jews
[1:59:04] and the Gentiles. So everyone is
[1:59:06] speaking of the Jewish revival.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; No, brother. They they can't have their
[1:59:11] revival before we have our revival. So
[1:59:13] we got a revival before the Jews. And
[1:59:16] there's only one revival. He promised a
[1:59:18] seven thunder revival, brother. And
[1:59:20] that's what the Gentiles is waiting for.
[1:59:22] That's our expectation. I don't know how
[1:59:25] you came to this convention, but I came
[1:59:27] to expect 100fold. I don't know if you
[1:59:30] brother, you better expect 100fold. I'm
[1:59:33] going back change. My life mustn't be
[1:59:36] the same again. Mommy don't have to beat
[1:59:39] me up to go to church. I'm going to
[1:59:41] church myself.
[1:59:43] Mommy don't have to wake you up and say,
[1:59:44] "Come on, it's church. You have church
[1:59:46] in your heart." God wakes you up for
[1:59:49] church.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Now, we must beg people to come to
[1:59:57] church.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; You're not doing the pastor a favor.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; This is a man and you're going to find
[2:00:02] out.
[2:00:03] Oh, I'm getting ahead here and I'm
[2:00:04] getting anointed.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I feel the anointing,
[2:00:12] man. I feel the power of God here. I
[2:00:15] feel the presence of God. I feel
[2:00:18] somebody's going to go free. Somebody
[2:00:20] will break through this morning.
[2:00:23] Forget about your prestige. Forget who's
[2:00:26] sitting next to you. Forget I I'm so and
[2:00:29] so. You nothing, man. I'm nothing.
[2:00:31] Everyone is nothing. Here's the man
[2:00:33] that's something. He's the man and we
[2:00:36] want to please him.
[2:00:42] [Music]
[2:00:46] Brother Stephanus, we were read in the
[2:00:48] quote. Brother Paul says, "If I'm a
[2:00:50] pleaser of man, then I can't please
[2:00:52] God."
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; So if I come in here and I'm worried I
[2:00:55] can't say this and I can't say that,
[2:00:57] then I'm a pleaser of man. But if I'm
[2:00:59] here to please God, I'm going to say
[2:01:01] what he put on my heart, brother,
[2:01:03] because we're not here to please man,
[2:01:05] brother Theo,
[2:01:10] and they get fed up for this kind of
[2:01:11] preaching. Then they leave the church.
[2:01:13] But that's okay. God will put someone
[2:01:15] else. He'll raise up a rock. He'll raise
[2:01:18] someone to take your place.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; You can't bluff God.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Listen, you can't bluff God.
[2:01:30] [Applause]
[2:01:34] God don't need you. We need God.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; He says here 10 virgins church just as I
[2:01:42] know in the 10 virgins went out to meet
[2:01:44] the Lord. All sanctified, all holy,
[2:01:46] every one of them sanctified. Five were
[2:01:49] diligatory and let their lights go out.
[2:01:52] Five had oil in the lamps and behold the
[2:01:54] bridegroom cometh. And the five that had
[2:01:57] oil in their lamps went into the wedding
[2:01:59] supper.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; And the others was left outside
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; where there was weeping and whailing and
[2:02:04] nashing of teeth.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Be ready for you don't know what minute
[2:02:08] he the Lord comes.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; What is the oil? It represent the Holy
[2:02:13] Spirit.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; So this thing is run so close.
[2:02:20] I mean other quotes are read. He said
[2:02:22] almost deceive the very elected
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; because they come so close until the
[2:02:27] wedding supper
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; brother. They come so close until the
[2:02:35] wedding supper.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; That's how close they come.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; So they be walking side by side with you
[2:02:41] all the time.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; But you're going to listen to this.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Remember the three verses. You could be
[2:02:47] inspired. Listen, the sleeping virgins,
[2:02:50] you say, could be inspired by the devil.
[2:02:53] Absolutely.
[2:02:54] Still living clear. Yes, sir. Judas did
[2:02:57] the same thing. Sanctified, preached
[2:02:59] divine healing, cast out devils. Why?
[2:03:01] He's just right straight up almost the
[2:03:04] same thing the rest of them was. But
[2:03:07] when it came to Pentecost, that's where
[2:03:09] he showed his colors. He did not receive
[2:03:11] the Holy Ghost and turn his heels up and
[2:03:13] deny the Lord Jesus. That's exactly what
[2:03:16] the church did when it come to Pentecost
[2:03:18] blessing. They got away from it. And
[2:03:21] don't you see it in this class?
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; He came right until the baptism of the
[2:03:27] Holy Spirit. And when he had to go to
[2:03:30] the upper room, you know what he did? He
[2:03:32] turned his back and he walked away. He
[2:03:34] walked out.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; But there was Peter who denied the Lord.
[2:03:38] Hey, on the day of brother
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; in the upper room, did he walk back? No.
[2:03:42] He walked in. He walked in, brother.
[2:03:45] Even if he was backsliden, it's time to
[2:03:48] walk in. Don't walk out. Don't leave the
[2:03:51] message. Don't leave the church. It's
[2:03:54] time to walk in.
[2:03:56] Hallelujah. It's time to walk in.
[2:03:59] Judas walked out, but Peter walked in.
[2:04:03] And Peter received the Holy Ghost.
[2:04:05] Filled with the Holy Ghost. He became
[2:04:07] the speaker on the day of Pentecost,
[2:04:10] but Judas walked out.
[2:04:14] And he was anointed and counted part of
[2:04:17] the disciples.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Don't you see it class? Yay. The
[2:04:21] sleeping virgin. This sleeping virgin.
[2:04:23] Now you want to know what will become of
[2:04:25] her?
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Is that it?
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; One thing I want to explain. What will
[2:04:29] happen to this churches?
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; What will happen to these people who
[2:04:33] come part of the way with Christ?
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and didn't come or did not
[2:04:40] go all the way with Christ.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Here's a big difference.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; That's why it's so hard. You must have
[2:04:47] discernment.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; They come all the way,
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; but not they come some of the way,
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; but not all of the way.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; So, this is where you must discern
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; and say, "Wait a minute. I I I can't be
[2:05:07] a foolish virgin.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Please don't whatever you do, don't be a
[2:05:12] foolish virgin.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; In Romans 1 uh I believe uh uh Romans
[2:05:18] 2:22, the Bible said Paul said if the
[2:05:20] spirit of God is not in you, you are
[2:05:23] none of gods.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; You belong to an organization but not to
[2:05:27] God.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; If the spirit of God isn't in you,
[2:05:29] you're not of God.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; You have to have the spirit of God to be
[2:05:33] of God. Certainly
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; all sanctified but five was wise enough
[2:05:38] to have wisdom of revelation. Amen. To
[2:05:41] catch the door to be filled with the
[2:05:43] spirit. They had oil in their lamps and
[2:05:46] others had no oil when they were
[2:05:48] awakened. Why? Here come them up to the
[2:05:51] them. Now here there says this wise
[2:05:54] virgins had wisdom of revelation.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; They knew the door is going to close.
[2:06:04] They knew something is going to happen.
[2:06:06] But before the door gets close, I'm
[2:06:08] putting my foot in the door
[2:06:12] and footsteps are possession.
[2:06:15] Put your foot in the door until your
[2:06:17] children comes. Keep your foot in the
[2:06:19] door until your husband come. Keep your
[2:06:21] foot in the door. Wisdom of revelation
[2:06:24] until you're adopted. Until you're full
[2:06:26] with the Holy Ghost. Until you seal.
[2:06:29] Keep your foot in the door.
[2:06:32] Hallelujah. They had wisdom of
[2:06:35] revelation. Not just revelation. You
[2:06:37] need wisdom with your revelation.
[2:06:41] Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Paul, put your
[2:06:44] foot in the door and your family will
[2:06:47] come in. My backsliden children.
[2:06:50] Brother, why are you standing there? I'm
[2:06:52] waiting for my children. I'm waiting for
[2:06:55] my grandchildren. The Bible says the
[2:06:57] promise is for you and your children and
[2:07:00] your children's children. Come on,
[2:07:02] brother. Hold your foot in the door.
[2:07:05] Stand there. Let no one pull your way.
[2:07:08] Here I stand.
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:14] Hallelujah.
[2:07:16] Hallelujah.
[2:07:17] Stand. Stand. When you done all to
[2:07:21] stand. Stand.
[2:07:26] [Music]
[2:07:36] Hallelujah.
[2:07:38] Let's give the Lord a praise.
[2:07:43] Is there a shout in the house?
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Put your foot in there. Keep the door
[2:07:51] open. They had wisdom of revelation to
[2:07:54] catch the door.
[2:07:58] [Applause]
[2:08:16] [Music]
[2:08:23] Mama, if your husband don't do it, you
[2:08:26] put your foot there. Keep it. He will
[2:08:28] come. The children will come.
[2:08:30] Hallelujah. Listen young people. If your
[2:08:33] parents are not saved, stand there. Your
[2:08:35] parents will come.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; You see, it takes one person.
[2:08:41] Just one person that can stand for the
[2:08:44] family.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; And you might be that person. And God is
[2:08:50] speaking you to this morning. He's
[2:08:52] warning you, get ready. The rapture's
[2:08:54] here. prepare. Are you ready, man? If he
[2:08:58] must come today, are you ready? Are you
[2:09:00] saying, "Lord, I'm not ready yet because
[2:09:02] so and so, I still have to." Hey,
[2:09:04] there's no time. You better fix it up
[2:09:06] now.
[2:09:08] If you got malice and hatred, fix it up
[2:09:10] now. If there's things in the world that
[2:09:13] bind you, fix it up now. Don't leave the
[2:09:16] service. Don't leave the service. Don't
[2:09:20] leave with that in your heart, man. He
[2:09:22] might come today.
[2:09:26] And that's why I believe God called
[2:09:27] these meetings.
[2:09:31] [Applause]
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:09:48] And when they were awakened,
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; why here come up them and said, "Now
[2:09:53] watch. Here come the foolish virgin
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; and they come to the wise virgin. Listen
[2:09:58] what they ask.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, give us some of your Holy
[2:10:03] Spirit.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Give me some.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Now listen. At that time,
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; there's no brotherly kindness.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; I only got for me.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; You were in the same service. What did
[2:10:15] you do?
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Don't say I must have brotherly kindness
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; because I only have some for myself.
[2:10:23] So I want to go and if I give you I
[2:10:25] can't go.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; So that's going to be a very very tricky
[2:10:29] time
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; and say this church don't have brotherly
[2:10:32] kindness. Hey, how many service were you
[2:10:34] in? How many times did God warn you from
[2:10:37] this pullpit? How many times did God
[2:10:39] speak to you and you were right in the
[2:10:41] same service but there were some who was
[2:10:43] wise that took the oil that fill the
[2:10:46] lamps. They come every service. They
[2:10:49] didn't just park. They didn't just sit.
[2:10:51] They wanted the filling of the Holy
[2:10:53] Ghost, brother. So that took them all
[2:10:56] the way to the wedding supper. And
[2:10:58] brother, when he came there, now they
[2:11:00] ask of you give us oil.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Too late.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Too late, friend. That's why you better
[2:11:09] pay the warning today.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; If if it's not today, the rest of the
[2:11:13] ministers take the warning.
[2:11:19] Don't wait and say we're not sure if
[2:11:22] which church is right.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; So we'll wait until that happened and
[2:11:25] then we'll see and then run. Too late.
[2:11:28] Come and tell you something.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; Noah it rained for 100. You remember I
[2:11:31] preached for 120 years
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; and when he went out God shut the door.
[2:11:35] Not Noah.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; And everyone was saying when the rain
[2:11:40] come then we'll run.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; By the time the rain came
[2:11:48] what happened? The door was shut.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; So, you know, it takes identification
[2:11:53] now.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; And when they ran and says, "Noah, my
[2:11:57] mother, Noah, my baby," it was too late.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; God is not going to wait till everyone
[2:12:02] is married.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; He's not going to wait till everyone has
[2:12:05] got their degree. He's going to
[2:12:07] interrupt somebody's program.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; And you better get ready today. Lord, I
[2:12:12] want to be right because if he
[2:12:14] interrupts your program today, you must
[2:12:16] be right.
[2:12:22] Oh, help us God. Helping Lord Jesus,
[2:12:25] help us, God. What a day we living in.
[2:12:33] [Applause]
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; You see, there's a thing back home. They
[2:12:36] say, "No, I don't want to be identified
[2:12:38] with that group. Maybe he's wrong and
[2:12:40] I'll identify with this guy. So when the
[2:12:41] rain comes, we'll run.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Brother M, it's too late.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; God shut the door.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Seven days it was shut. Noah was shut
[2:12:50] in. He couldn't backslide.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; There's going to come a time you can't
[2:12:53] backslide. God shut the door.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; And he couldn't even go out.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; He couldn't go out and no one could come
[2:13:00] in.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, be ready. Get
[2:13:03] ready, bride. There's coming a time he's
[2:13:05] going to shut the door. And what does
[2:13:08] that quote say? He's going to anoint the
[2:13:10] church at that time.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; He says, "And the Gentiles time will be
[2:13:14] over.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; The Gentiles is winding up." Friend, if
[2:13:20] you see it, the Gentiles is winding up.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; How long you going to play church?
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; God, help us to make our lives right.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; And not intellectually, but heart.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:37] You must have mean headful, heartfelt.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; And if you are head, you know what they
[2:13:44] say, a corner wheat when the head is
[2:13:46] full, it bows.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Very full of themselves.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; I want to fire quick here.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; You ready to see this? So listen, what
[2:14:03] is the answer? Give us some of your oil.
[2:14:06] Give us some of your Holy Spirit. Give
[2:14:07] us some.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Sorry, sister. Just got
[2:14:11] enough for myself.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; I sure ain't got any to spare."
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; So that's coming a time.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't mean we don't have
[2:14:19] brother kindness.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; We made use or the bride made use of
[2:14:23] every service.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Every service they came to, they didn't
[2:14:28] just park then. Their mind was somewhere
[2:14:29] else.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Go pray up. Listen, they said go pray
[2:14:36] up.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; So in other words, the oil that they
[2:14:39] needed was to go pray up.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; But it was too late to even pray up
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; cuz the bridegroom has come and the wise
[2:14:47] went in and the door was shut. The Bible
[2:14:49] says, brother Emmy, when they came back,
[2:14:51] they knocked on the door
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; and the door was shut.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; Now you want to wake up when that's
[2:14:59] there
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; and you didn't make ready. You heard the
[2:15:03] warning of God.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; That's why I pray today. God touch your
[2:15:06] heart.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; God speak to your heart.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; God come in there and con conflict you
[2:15:13] and say you can't run this race with
[2:15:15] that weight.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; You wait down with the staircase of the
[2:15:19] world. You're trying to run this race
[2:15:21] and you wait down with every
[2:15:24] circumstances and you're trying to run
[2:15:26] but you're making no progress.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; No progress. You're still the same like
[2:15:31] you were 10 years ago.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; No progress.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; You're still like Yahweh 15 years ago.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; No change, no progress.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; You know the branch, the bride was
[2:15:44] marching in that vision. Brother Theo
[2:15:45] onward Christian soldiers,
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; brother Olu, they were marching.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; There was progress. They didn't say on
[2:15:51] the same place. There was progress.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; But you see what has happened in the
[2:15:56] message.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; There's a thing called mark time. Yes.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; So, you're still marching,
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; but you're on the same spot.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; The pastor look at you say, "But this
[2:16:08] guy's 10 years in the message. He's
[2:16:10] still on the same spot.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; He's 20 years in the message. He still
[2:16:14] hasn't paid tithe.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; He's 15 years in the message. He can't
[2:16:19] come to church." But the bride that's
[2:16:21] marching, hey, there's progress,
[2:16:23] brother. They can see, hey, I've gained
[2:16:25] ground. I gone forward. I'm going to my
[2:16:28] objective. I'm going in the rapture. I'm
[2:16:30] laying aside every weight of sin that
[2:16:33] does not so easily beset me. You make
[2:16:35] progress.
[2:16:37] Progress, mother. Progress, young
[2:16:39] people. That's what the march is. Onward
[2:16:42] Christian soldiers marching as to war
[2:16:46] with the cross of Jesus going on before.
[2:16:50] But my time Isaac.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[2:16:55] going through the motions and we think
[2:16:56] you're marching.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; But we spiritual man. We can see.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; We can say marking time.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; We might call you sister Mark time or
[2:17:06] brother marking time.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; And brother Theo didn't ask me to
[2:17:15] preach. Listen, this is all my notes.
[2:17:21] Listen,
[2:17:25] they said go pray up. And while they
[2:17:28] were gone together, the bride came and
[2:17:30] they went into the wedding supper and
[2:17:33] they was left without where they go
[2:17:35] through the watches. They go through the
[2:17:37] tribulation.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; Watch just a little couple more verses
[2:17:42] and you'll see the right thing here.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Wise virgins. Now listen to this one,
[2:17:46] brother Theo. This one blows him.
[2:17:48] Brother Isaac,
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; he says here in in 10 virgins, he says,
[2:17:53] "There's your five wise virgins
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; who had oil in their lamps." Watch his
[2:17:58] next words, "Rapturing faith."
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; You mean the wise virgins,
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; brother Emmy had had oil in their lamps,
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; rapturing faith.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Now, what gives you rapturing faith?
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; Seven fundness. So you mean in their
[2:18:17] lambs, brother Raymond, that oil that
[2:18:18] they had was raptured in faith. Yes, my
[2:18:22] brother. And that took them into the
[2:18:23] wedding supper. Brother Brandham says a
[2:18:26] man, a church that has these qualities
[2:18:28] is a church going in the rapture. An
[2:18:30] individual that has this is an
[2:18:33] individual that's going in the rapture.
[2:18:35] So what do they have in their lamps?
[2:18:37] Come on now. Preach back, man. Preach
[2:18:38] back. They had rapturing faith and the
[2:18:42] seven thunders gives you rapturing
[2:18:44] faith. Come on my brother, sister.
[2:18:47] That's what takes you to the wedding
[2:18:48] supper. That's what takes you in is
[2:18:51] those seven thunders. Don't refuse the
[2:18:54] seven thunders.
[2:18:56] That's the extra oil.
[2:18:59] [Applause]
[2:19:00] Hallelujah.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:04] Wow.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Uh can I read it again? There's your
[2:19:12] five wise virgins who had oil in their
[2:19:14] lamp, rapturing faith,
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; believing all the signs and wonders,
[2:19:19] prophecies and everything. These five
[2:19:22] cut out from the remnant was taken away.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; So they had raptured in faith.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; Many churches don't want to pre preach
[2:19:30] it.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; They feel it's a doctrine.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; It's not a doctrine. It's a life.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; It's a life. Listen, man.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; I said back home, if it's a doctrine
[2:19:42] that makes you to be like Christ, then I
[2:19:44] want that doctrine.
[2:19:46] [Applause]
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; Don't give me some uh church theology
[2:19:49] and some uh motivational speaking.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Give me something to get me out of here.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; And if that's going to get me out of
[2:19:56] here, I want it, brother. The bride
[2:19:58] wants it. That makes you ready for the
[2:20:00] wedding supper. That takes you in,
[2:20:02] brother. So, we have to preach it.
[2:20:07] And here's the quote. They want a quote.
[2:20:09] Here's the quote.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; The oil in the lambs, brother Goki was
[2:20:14] raptured in faith.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; And they taking it out of their
[2:20:18] churches.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; No blood.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; No blood.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; That's why the premises where there's no
[2:20:26] blood, you know, the enemy can come in
[2:20:27] anytime he wants to.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; He says, I walk into that church because
[2:20:30] there's no blood.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Come on, man. But he has a blood
[2:20:34] covering over this people. Oh, this
[2:20:36] morning I see the seven color coat of
[2:20:39] Joseph hanging over this people,
[2:20:41] brother. Every demon is running from
[2:20:44] you, brother. There's no devil can
[2:20:46] overpower you. There's no demon can take
[2:20:48] your place. There's no demon can take
[2:20:50] your name off the book. There's no
[2:20:52] eraser. There's no bleach. Your name is
[2:20:55] on the lamb's book of life before the
[2:20:57] foundation of the world. You're going in
[2:20:59] the rapture. You're keeping your foot in
[2:21:02] the door. Your family is coming. Your
[2:21:04] children is coming. Why? You have a
[2:21:07] wisdom of revelation to get to the door.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:15] Hallelujah.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Gi, I feel good, man.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; I feel like running. I feel like
[2:21:24] jumping. My I got to contain myself
[2:21:27] because I know something is going to
[2:21:29] happen today. Something is going to
[2:21:31] happen. The Holy Spirit told me, "Tell
[2:21:33] them this." And someone is going to
[2:21:36] examine themselves and say, "I want to
[2:21:38] be right." You're going to run to the
[2:21:40] altar. You're going to run and say,
[2:21:41] "Brother, I want to make it. I don't
[2:21:44] care about the world. The world is
[2:21:45] fading, brother. Your money won't help
[2:21:47] you. Your cars won't help you. Your
[2:21:50] buildings won't help you. There's one
[2:21:52] man that will help you. This is the man,
[2:21:54] Christ Jesus. Hallelujah, brother
[2:21:56] Charles. He will help you. He will heal
[2:21:59] you. He will deliver you. He will set
[2:22:01] you free. He will baptize you with the
[2:22:04] Holy Ghost and fire. Don't you want
[2:22:07] this, man? Don't you want to be ready?
[2:22:09] Say, "God, today I want to be ready.
[2:22:11] Fill me with the Holy Ghost. Fill me
[2:22:14] with the power. Fill me with that
[2:22:16] anointing. Give me the oil that takes me
[2:22:18] in the rapture, Lord.
[2:22:22] [Applause]
[2:22:34] [Music]
[2:22:36] My my
[2:22:38] what an anointing here.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; I see individuals taking it.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; Mama don't mark time.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; You know why your children is watching
[2:22:50] you?
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; They see mama does nothing. So the
[2:22:53] children sit
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; cuz mama's sitting.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; And then we wonder why our children
[2:22:58] backslide because we do nothing.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; They don't amen.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; They don't shout.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; They don't worship God to be an example.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; Someone is watching you.
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; That's why you see me. I come down the
[2:23:13] aisle. I worship. I want the young
[2:23:15] people to see I worship.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; I don't only Amen. I don't I don't like
[2:23:20] uh sit there when any minister preach.
[2:23:22] I'm here down the aisle. I want to show
[2:23:24] the young people, the ministers. Amen.
[2:23:26] Also,
[2:23:29] we Amen, man. We Amen. Preaching,
[2:23:33] pastor. Preaching, pastor. I need it. I
[2:23:36] need the warning. I need the correction.
[2:23:38] I need the blasting. I need the
[2:23:40] overturning in my life. Preach it.
[2:23:43] Preach it. Preach it. God need blasters,
[2:23:47] man.
[2:23:48] Not compromises.
[2:23:51] We compromise to keep the church full
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; because so and so pays a lot of tithes.
[2:24:01] [Applause]
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; You know what? I better not say it.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; Must I say it?
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; You know when there's big tithe payers
[2:24:14] and the pastor can't see nothing
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; because that guy or that woman keeps him
[2:24:18] the pastor under his thumb.
[2:24:21] Now he must go and when he comes to that
[2:24:24] person he's got to make a you
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; brother
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; I know brother thing is not like that
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; tithe or no tithes
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; money or no money
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; the word of God and this message comes
[2:24:38] first if I'm a pleaser of man I can't
[2:24:41] please God but we're here not to please
[2:24:44] you to please our heavenly father and we
[2:24:47] preach the word with thunderbolt and
[2:24:50] Lightning brother blasting that thing.
[2:24:55] [Applause]
[2:25:02] [Music]
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close very soon. I don't
[2:25:09] like to go long.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; He says here Christ is missing. Now you
[2:25:12] say certain things will take place then
[2:25:14] it will make it then I'll make ready. He
[2:25:18] says, "Make ready now."
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; Now, you know what's happened in the
[2:25:22] message? We stand apart now. I know I
[2:25:24] got a thing with Goki.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; So, I'm waiting for him to come.
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; He's waiting for me to come
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; and nothing happens.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; But we go on like that convention to
[2:25:35] convention to convention to convention,
[2:25:38] but nothing is solved.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; Instead of me just going up to brother
[2:25:41] Goki, say, "Brother Gouki, I love you,
[2:25:43] man. Forgive me, man, for whatever I
[2:25:46] said or done. He says, he says to me,
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; I love you, pastor, with all my heart.
[2:25:50] God bless you, my brother.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; You know what it is? It's a time for
[2:25:57] action,
[2:25:59] not lip service. A time for action. Love
[2:26:03] is a word of action, brother Paul. It's
[2:26:06] a word of action.
[2:26:10] God didn't say uh uh John 3:16, "For God
[2:26:13] so loved the world that he gave his only
[2:26:15] begotten son that whosoever believed in
[2:26:17] him will not perish but have life
[2:26:19] eternal."
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; When God said it, did he sit back in
[2:26:22] heaven?
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; What did he do?
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; He went into action
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; and he came to redeem a bride. You know,
[2:26:33] we want to see the power of God in
[2:26:34] church. Make right with one another. Get
[2:26:37] over jealousy. Get out the malice. Get
[2:26:40] out the hardness. Come soft. Become
[2:26:43] sweet. Become loving. Let love take
[2:26:46] control. Brother, that's easy, man. When
[2:26:49] you allow God to come in, oh, I must
[2:26:52] make this illustration, brother Theo.
[2:26:54] And I'm going to close very soon. Listen
[2:26:56] to me, people. Watch me. Just watch me
[2:26:58] for a moment. The Bible says when the
[2:27:00] enemy comes in like a flood,
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; the spirit raises the standard. Right
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; now if you stay on the same level
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; and someone comes and says something bad
[2:27:11] it buffets you
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; now you human what do you do? You say
[2:27:15] back poof
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; and now you buffeting one another
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; left right and center
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; but if the spirit raises stand it
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; you raise.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; So what happened? You don't stay on
[2:27:26] their level.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit told me go higher.
[2:27:34] Go higher, brother. So no matter what
[2:27:37] they say, it comes.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; There it goes. Another one says it
[2:27:43] comes.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; Why? You went higher.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; That's why you got the victory.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; They scandal. They backbite. They stab
[2:27:53] you in the back. Did it affect you?
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; The spirit raised a standard.
[2:27:58] [Music]
[2:28:02] goes all the way brother Emmy
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; and they can't understand you still
[2:28:06] standing
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; he told John come up high are you John
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; come up either
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; in this meetings come up either
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; and you'll find out no criticism affects
[2:28:17] you
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; what you don't know don't hurt you
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; stop letting your ears out what did that
[2:28:24] pastor say what did that one say and
[2:28:26] before you know you can't handle it
[2:28:30] But you know, I made up my mind. I don't
[2:28:32] need to listen to nobody.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; This bride has got no headquarters.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; We don't have to consult anyone. Can I
[2:28:42] say this? Can I preach it? No.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; We get our headquarters. This is Christ
[2:28:46] is our headquarters.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Olu, we hear from him,
[2:28:50] man.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; He's our headquarters.
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; So don't make your ears a rubbish pin,
[2:28:55] man. That's right.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Then you can't handle it. And before you
[2:28:59] know, there's division in the church.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; Did you hear that one? Did you hear that
[2:29:04] one? Come on. Keep it to yourself.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; I don't even want to hear it.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:29:13] We too far up the road for those
[2:29:15] childish things.
[2:29:18] Too far out the road. We must be mature,
[2:29:21] man. Oh, I like mature people, you know.
[2:29:25] Baby still need a what you call this?
[2:29:27] New nappies
[2:29:32] pumpers
[2:29:33] nappy nippers.
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; Listen man, that time is pass
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; that we needed when we start. We had
[2:29:39] piles and piles of pampers.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; But you know what? We chucked it out.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; So if you're still a baby, you're going
[2:29:46] to stay messed up.
[2:29:50] [Applause]
[2:29:57] I tell you, I'm going by inspiration
[2:29:59] now.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; If you still want pampers and nappish,
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; you you you're going to stay dirty.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; The pastor don't have time for that.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; No sir,
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; Isaac,
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; they need to grow up.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; When are you going to grow up?
[2:30:19] We need matured people.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; This bride has made himself ready
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; by the stature of a perfect man which is
[2:30:26] the life of Christ
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; manifested in your life. Then your walk
[2:30:31] is his walk. Your talk is his talk. Your
[2:30:34] hands is his hands. Your eyes is his
[2:30:36] eyes. Then in in in uh in uh in
[2:30:39] Trinidad, there'll be a people that's
[2:30:42] anointed with a revival. Wherever you
[2:30:44] walk, angels walk. Wherever you go, the
[2:30:47] angels of God are with you, brother.
[2:30:48] Why? You're a son and a daughter of God,
[2:30:50] and you made yourself ready.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; I better close here. My, there's so
[2:30:56] much, but it's finally my my.
[2:31:02] [Applause]
[2:31:05] Please, please, I want you to listen and
[2:31:06] I want you now to zero away from who's
[2:31:09] next to you. I want everyone to stand.
[2:31:11] Even at the back there, just stand for
[2:31:13] this moment. I'm busy closing.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; And I want you to examine your own life
[2:31:16] if Christ will come today. Can you say,
[2:31:18] "Lord, I can take you right through my
[2:31:20] house, through every door. I can swing
[2:31:22] them open. I can swing the kitchen, but
[2:31:24] there's certain doors we keep closed."
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; That mean you're hiding something.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; Now, I got a I got a quote here,
[2:31:33] brother, over it. He says, you know,
[2:31:37] uh, he told that young man that
[2:31:40] proposed, you remember the rancher son,
[2:31:42] he proposed to that poor girl,
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; and he promised he'd come back
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; and all the cousins made fun of her.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; But she was getting ready.
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; Every penny she had, she bought the
[2:31:53] dress. She made ready.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; She was so under expectation.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; And they said, "What? Marry you?"
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; That church forget it, man.
[2:32:05] But she made ready.
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; You see, we got to make ready. Never
[2:32:10] mind what we hear
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; and what this church is saying about us.
[2:32:14] We got to make ready.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; You see, that church will go on and you
[2:32:19] will stuck.
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; And if you have unforgiveness, it's like
[2:32:25] you drinking poison, but you want the
[2:32:26] next person to die.
[2:32:31] Really,
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; and I'm saying this from a heart to help
[2:32:34] somebody.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; We can't walk for years with that.
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; God help me, man. I'm I'm even becoming
[2:32:46] emotional.
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; We can't.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; If we didn't mature after 10, 20 years,
[2:32:54] I there's nothing left. I can't say
[2:32:56] there's 10 years back. when you going to
[2:32:58] make it ready.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; But I know today there's grace. I can't
[2:33:03] promise you tomorrow. I know today.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; So I want to close with this.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; Brother B says they went to uh Okay, let
[2:33:09] me take Aliza quickly. So he had to get
[2:33:12] the bride for Isaac.
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; So he took with him all the garments and
[2:33:16] everything that she needed that was sent
[2:33:18] by Isaac. And when he met the damsel
[2:33:22] Rebecca, they asked, "Are you ready to
