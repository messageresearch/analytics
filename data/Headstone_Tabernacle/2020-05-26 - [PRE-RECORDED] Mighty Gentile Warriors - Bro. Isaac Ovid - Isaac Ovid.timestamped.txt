[6:28] hallelujah they were so convinced of the
[6:30] scriptures that nothing on again man the

[12:27] if you're studying what the devil
[12:29] telling you you would feel like a nobody
[12:31] forever your Fenian wooded forever maybe
[12:35] that's how David might have felt because
[12:37] his brothers of course they had this
[12:39] using a family and his brothers had
[12:42] issues where David was concerned so when
[12:45] David came on a message from his dad to
[12:52] drop some meal from his brothers the
[12:55] attitude was what you doing here
[12:59] who home with the Sheep if David was
[13:04] concerned
[13:05] about what was told him by his brothers
[13:10] he could have just taken a boat in
[13:13] dropped the meal and go back home
[13:16] but Goliath spoke and when Goliath spoke
[13:21] David heard
[13:22] David heard board set it up that way for
[13:27] David to hear when goal I had spoke
[13:29] because God was speaking for 40 days and
[13:32] 40 nights and nobody was interested or
[13:35] given a response to Galia by text by fax
[13:38] by any means whatever by smoke nobody
[13:41] was talking back to Goliath but David
[13:44] heard and they every responder who is
[13:46] that
[13:47] uncircumcised
[13:49] philistine
[13:50] he don't belong here he's done one of us
[13:53] he's not part of the Covenant he's not
[13:56] part of the agreement but God he's not a
[13:58] citizen of this country he's an
[14:01] immigrant he's an outsider people belong
[14:04] for the covenant of Israel there's no
[14:06] healing for him there's no breakthrough
[14:08] for him there's no deliverance room on
[14:11] the contrary course they run demo drive

[21:24] for your love for your mercy today and
[21:26] Lord for the grace that you have given
[21:28] us to be gathered here in your house
[21:30] Lord to be chosen in such a time as this
[21:32] Lord your word teaches that no man could
[21:35] come unless the father draws and Lord is
[21:37] a pull that has brought us here this
[21:39] morning from the east from the west from
[21:41] the north from the South law and and the
[21:43] devil doesn't like it and as a
[21:45] songwriter says Satan is man but I'm so
[21:47] glad that you chose us for such a time
[21:50] as this now as we learn and ever to read
[21:53] your word may you walk out the pages of
[21:55] the Bible may you lift the weary bodies
[21:58] may you take away depression and
[21:59] frustration and Lord may such a shout of
[22:02] the King be in the camp this morning

[22:06] control in the name of the Lord Jesus
[22:09] Christ with the glory of the Lord Jesus
[22:11] Christ and Lord we pray that you deliver

[22:16] free Lord break the chains and the
[22:18] shackles love me you heal the sick in
[22:21] our midst Lord me you restore it there's
[22:23] a backslider who happened to walk in
[22:25] here this morning media realize it's not
[22:28] by chance it's not by accident but they
[22:30] came to the right place at the right
[22:32] time Lord you know every situation you
[22:35] know every need every condition love me
[22:38] you move through the house this morning
[22:39] and minister to your people Lord me you
[22:42] take my thoughts out of the way may you
[22:44] take this message out of the way and may
[22:47] you minister to the heirs of salvation
[22:48] this morning Lord that they could know
[22:51] that there is blood for them this
[22:52] morning and the Holy Ghost says for them
[22:54] that deliverance is for them love me you
[22:56] anoint the reading of the word and Lord
[22:59] God the hearing of the word in the
[23:01] precious name of Jesus Christ and the
[23:03] church says
[23:04] amen and amen Hebrews 11 and reading
[23:07] from verse 1 now faith is the substance
[23:10] of things hoped for the evidence of
[23:14] things not seen for by it the elders
[23:18] obtained a good report
[23:20] through faith we understand it's only
[23:24] through faith we understand that the
[23:26] worlds were framed by the Word of God so
[23:29] that the things which are seen were not
[23:32] mean of things which do appear by faith
[23:36] Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[23:38] sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained
[23:42] witness that he was righteous God
[23:44] testifying of his gifts and by 80 being
[23:47] dead yet speaketh by Fiat Enoch was
[23:51] translated that he should not see death
[23:53] and was not found because God had
[23:56] translated him for before his
[23:58] translation he had this testimony that
[24:01] he pleased God
[24:02] but without fear it is impossible to
[24:05] please him for he that cometh to God
[24:07] must believe that he is and that he is a
[24:10] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[24:12] Him my feet Noah being warned of God of
[24:15] things not seen as yet moved with fear
[24:19] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[24:22] house by the which he condemned the
[24:24] world and became heir of the
[24:26] righteousness which is by feet by faith
[24:29] Abraham when he was called to go out
[24:31] into a place which he should after
[24:33] receive for an inheritance obeyed and he
[24:36] went out not knowing whether he went by
[24:40] faith he sojourned in the land of
[24:42] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[24:45] in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the
[24:48] heirs with him of the same promise
[24:50] for he looked for a city which hath
[24:53] foundations whose builder and maker is
[24:56] God through faith also Sara herself
[24:59] received strength to conceive seed and
[25:02] was delivered of a child when she was
[25:04] past age because she judged him faithful
[25:06] who had promised therefore sprung their
[25:09] even of one and him as good as dead so
[25:12] many as the stars of the sky in
[25:15] multitude and as the sandwiches by the
[25:17] seashore innumerable these all died in
[25:21] faith not having received the promises
[25:24] but having seen them afar off but were
[25:27] persuaded of them and embraced them and
[25:31] fest that there were strangers and
[25:34] pilgrims on the it but that says such
[25:37] things declare plainly that they seek a
[25:40] country and I ask the question this
[25:42] morning are you seeking a country and
[25:44] truly if they had been mindful listen of
[25:47] that country from Wednesday came out
[25:50] they might have had opportunity to have
[25:53] returned let me say that again and truly
[25:56] if they have been mindful of that
[25:58] country from Wednesday came out they
[26:01] might have had opportunity to have
[26:02] returned in other words if they were
[26:05] thinking about the country from where
[26:07] they came from they might have been
[26:09] inclined to go back but their thoughts
[26:11] were not there but now in verse 16 they
[26:14] desire a better country
[26:15] that is a heavenly wherefore God is not
[26:19] ashamed to be called their God for he
[26:21] hath prepared for them a city by faith
[26:24] Abraham when he was tried offered up
[26:26] Isaac and he that had received the
[26:28] promises offered up his only begotten
[26:30] Son of whom it was said that in Isaac
[26:32] shall thy seed be called accounting that
[26:35] God was able to raise him up even from
[26:37] the dead from whence also he received
[26:40] him in a figure by faith Isaac blessed
[26:42] Jacob and Esau concerning things to come
[26:45] by faith Jacob when he was dying blessed
[26:48] both the sons of Joseph and worship
[26:51] leaning upon the top of his staff by
[26:54] faith Joseph when he died made mention
[26:57] of the departing of the cheran of Israel
[26:59] and gave commandment concerning his
[27:02] bones by faith Moses when he was born
[27:05] was hid three months of his parents
[27:07] because they saw he was a proper child
[27:09] and they were not afraid of the Kings
[27:11] commandment
[27:12] are you with me this morning my feet
[27:16] Moses when he was come to years when he
[27:19] was old enough he refused to be called
[27:21] the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing
[27:24] rather to do what suffer affliction with
[27:28] the people of God than to enjoy the
[27:30] pleasures of sin for a season is anybody
[27:33] with me this morning and scheming the
[27:35] reproach of Christ greater riches than
[27:39] the treasures in Egypt for he had
[27:40] respect unto the recompense of the
[27:43] reward by he forsook Egypt not fearing
[27:47] the wrath of the King for he endured as
[27:50] seeing him who is invisible through
[27:53] faith he kept the Passover and the
[27:55] sprinkling of blood less he that destroy
[27:58] the firstborn should touch them by faith
[28:01] he passed through the Red Sea as child
[28:04] on which the Egyptians are said to do
[28:07] but were drowned by fear the walls of
[28:10] Jericho fell down after they were
[28:12] compassed about seven days my feet the
[28:15] harlot Rahab perish not with them that
[28:17] believe not when she had received the
[28:19] spies with peace but what shall I say
[28:22] more for the time would feel me in other
[28:24] words the right to hear Paul is saying I
[28:26] can keep going on and on and on and on
[28:29] talking about the sinkhole feat
[28:32] for the time would fail me to tell of
[28:34] gideon and of barack and of samson and
[28:37] of jeff ty of david also and samuel and
[28:40] of the prophets who through faith
[28:42] subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness
[28:45] obtained promises stopped the mouths of
[28:48] lions quenched the violence of fire
[28:50] escaped the edge of the sword out of
[28:52] weakness were made strong waxed valiant
[28:56] in fight turned to flight the armies of
[28:59] the aliens women received their dead
[29:01] raised to life again and others were
[29:03] tortured not accepting deliverance that
[29:06] they might obtain a better resurrection
[29:10] are you with me this morning and others
[29:14] had trial of cruel mockings and
[29:16] scourgings here moreover of bonds and
[29:18] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[29:20] sawn asunder were tempted were slain
[29:23] with the sword they wandered about in
[29:26] sheepskins and goatskins being destitute
[29:28] afflicted tormented of whom the world
[29:32] was not worthy they wandered in deserts
[29:34] and in mountains and in dens and caves
[29:37] of the earth and these all having
[29:40] obtained a good report through faith
[29:42] received not the promise God having
[29:46] provided some better thing for us that
[29:49] without us should not be made perfect

[30:10] that because you're supposed to read
[30:12] every single day so that reading is only
[30:15] today's reading if that's how you're
[30:16] supposed to read the Bible every single
[30:18] day because that's what you grow and get

[34:06] on the shelves somewhere there is no
[34:08] excuse this morning that's why I realize
[34:11] the wrapped is just for a few people I'm
[34:13] looking at people that spawn and only
[34:15] some will be in the rapture somebody got
[34:17] upset with me the last time I said it
[34:19] but it's still the truth because God is
[34:21] not taking everybody who comes to church
[34:23] and put them in the rapture the rapture
[34:25] is for those who fight for every inch of
[34:28] ground and you have a choice this
[34:29] morning to be a church member or to be
[34:32] in their pride but God as my witness I
[34:35] want to be in the pride is there anybody
[34:37] this morning who wants to be in their
[34:39] pride you don't want to be a church
[34:41] member but you want to be a real

[35:04] king and I know it takes something this
[35:06] time but God helped me to shut my eyes
[35:08] to the nominations and everything else
[35:11] and look to that spiritual sight you'll
[35:13] know that he's coming the king he said
[35:15] I'll serve him if it's death let me die

[37:20] bride are we gonna get it in a minute
[37:22] can it's a man
[37:24] now with a brand I'm talking about
[37:26] David's warriors in the message why
[37:30] little Bethlehem he said they knew the
[37:33] unknowing thing was on that little all
[37:34] ruddy looking fellow and they knew he
[37:37] was going to be king but even in his own
[37:40] mind was frustrated
[37:43] his own City Bethlehem he looked at when
[37:46] a great thing that taken place but he
[37:48] was not in Bethlehem
[37:50] can the church say man he knew that in
[37:52] Bethany and there was something special
[37:54] in Bethlehem and David and all this
[37:56] frustration walking back and forth
[37:58] thinking oh this D is so hot
[38:01] I've been fighting for a long time this
[38:03] day is so hot I wish I just wish if you
[38:07] had a drink of water but not any kind of
[38:09] water he wanted a drink of water from
[38:12] the well down in Bethlehem can the
[38:15] church see man
[38:16] listen soul might have come this way the
[38:20] Philistines might have come this way
[38:21] Army's around everywhere and here he was
[38:24] sitting on the Mount of a cave this is
[38:26] where the random oh can it be how can it
[38:28] be who I wish I had a drink but the
[38:31] madam said his mind goes way back down
[38:32] there by the kids of Bethlehem there was
[38:34] a well he said there just was no water
[38:37] like that water and if you ever taste
[38:40] this everlasting water there is no water
[38:41] like that water given was thirsty and he
[38:45] just wanted it he only can get a drink
[38:47] of the water from that well
[38:49] he may be see this but Abraham said you
[38:52] know Palestine has some bad water they
[38:54] have evil waters they even have
[38:56] Blackwater fever and stuff a lot of it
[38:58] is alkaline water which will kill you
[39:01] what Bethlehem is the water seat of the
[39:03] prophets there is no water like
[39:05] Bethlehem had David used to think when I
[39:08] take my sheep and start out in the
[39:10] morning and go by that all well and
[39:12] drink oh how cool and how sweet and how
[39:15] it cuenta de cuenta this and how his
[39:19] throat is going and yet anointed he said
[39:21] oh if I only had a drink of water now
[39:24] his warriors he screamed out in his
[39:26] despair oh if somebody would bring me a
[39:29] drink again from that all well he didn't
[39:32] tell nobody to do it he does that always
[39:34] somebody could just bring me a drink of
[39:36] water from that well you know at
[39:38] Bethlehem after dreaming all of the
[39:41] victories if somebody could bring me a
[39:43] drink now his warriors could not
[39:45] interpret his thinking but brother he
[39:48] loved him with all that was in them
[39:50] and when David said that but the random
[39:53] said the least of his desires was a
[39:56] command to them so tree of his mighty
[39:58] warriors pull their swords and they
[40:00] slipped away from the camp do you didn't
[40:03] even know where he went he slipped away
[40:05] from the camp and they caught the away
[40:07] trooper the rounds had 25 miles of enemy
[40:09] territory
[40:11] because their captain King he wanted a
[40:14] drink of water and they cut through all
[40:17] kind of demons all kind of enemy
[40:19] therefore to this battle and this
[40:21] struggle and you just wanna you fought
[40:23] to be here this morning you could have
[40:25] been everywhere some people gave up he
[40:27] could even make it a smaller but you are
[40:29] here by the grace of God 10 the church
[40:32] seamen
[40:34] but abandom said David no doubt he was
[40:39] wondering where they're at what have
[40:41] they done where did they go to it don't
[40:43] they know they're jeopardizing their
[40:44] life they're right in the jaws of death
[40:47] true or 25-mile I'm laying in ambush
[40:49] everywhere but they believe that the
[40:52] King wanted a drink and but the balance
[40:55] said in a message we have seen his turn
[40:57] I've come to worship he said yes
[40:59] warriors today Jesus wants a good old
[41:02] Pentecost of fresh water these
[41:04] denominational stagnated waters is
[41:07] sickening to him he said take the Word
[41:09] of God and pull it and cut through all
[41:12] these trees and things up till we can
[41:14] hit that place where there's a fresh
[41:16] drink for him a real true worship a
[41:19] genuine heart where he can pour down his
[41:22] word he said you will restore the faith
[41:25] of the people back to the father's
[41:27] that's what I'm talking about this one
[41:29] it kind of church him
[41:31] [Applause]
[41:33] but a brand a master question he said I
[41:36] wonder if the Warriors to the mi
[41:39] speaking the Warriors this morning am i
[41:41] speaking the soleus this morning we're
[41:43] not speaking a little children this
[41:44] morning speaking the soleus from the
[41:46] time you are born it's a battle from my
[41:48] time you a pawn it's a struggle there's
[41:50] something built in you to fight and
[41:52] you'll fight them for something you're
[41:53] fighting to go to heaven or you're
[41:55] fighting to go to hell but abandom
[41:57] taught us he said and God doesn't send
[41:58] anyone to hell he said you fight to go
[42:00] to hell because God puts all the stop
[42:03] signs in front of you but you cut
[42:05] through that to get to help and if you
[42:06] want to go to heaven you gotta fight
[42:08] your way to go to heaven because the
[42:10] devil is against you but you are born
[42:12] warriors there's a fight inside of you
[42:15] you might get chopped you might get
[42:17] bruiser you might get wounded but it's a
[42:19] fight inside of you can it church
[42:21] teaming
[42:23] you may be seated but the Branum give
[42:26] the story one time huh I believe Julius
[42:28] Caesar was riding into triumph into Rome
[42:31] and he wanted to put one of his best men
[42:33] next to him and all the generals and
[42:35] everybody else was thinking that they
[42:37] were gonna be the one to ride with him
[42:38] into victory and Wow Caesar was getting
[42:41] ready he saw a little stable boy but all
[42:44] kind of cuts all over him he said where
[42:46] you been boy he said I've been fighting
[42:48] for my lord out in the path of these he
[42:50] said you were a ride with me those guys
[42:52] ain't got no cuts they got no bruises
[42:54] they got no scars blood so this morning
[42:56] if you got cuts and scars and bruises
[42:58] you wanna ride with a lord you might win
[43:02] every battle but we're gonna win the war
[43:04] you might have your ups and downs of
[43:06] popular to win the war we are warriors
[43:08] of the feet just like Gideon just like
[43:11] Samson just like Jeff time we are born
[43:14] to fight
[43:15] [Applause]
[43:22] you may be seated
[43:24] why the TV's men go to battle diva
[43:28] didn't order them to go to fight but his
[43:30] least desire he took it as a commander
[43:35] how do you get that this morning there's
[43:38] a lot of stuff that David could have
[43:39] said do this to this he was in charge
[43:41] but this wasn't a command he gave them
[43:44] his least desire it was a desire
[43:47] and it took his desire as a commander
[43:51] that had to be done that had to be
[43:54] accomplished
[43:55] we have many instructions in the Bible
[43:58] we have many commands in the Bible we
[43:59] call a command a commandment and jesus
[44:02] said if you love me then keep my
[44:04] Commandments
[44:06] but this is different this is not
[44:09] talking about God seeing do this and do
[44:11] this and come this is not that this is
[44:14] his least desire my desire is to and you
[44:19] take the desire and you run with it
[44:21] nobody can tell you come to church pay
[44:23] your tithe stand up those are
[44:26] Commandments but his least desire in the
[44:29] morning and nobody else is there he
[44:30] desires fellowship with you but you take
[44:32] it as a commander you can't move unless
[44:35] you pray you can't move because his
[44:37] least desire
[44:38] [Music]
[44:40] it's like a man
[44:44] his desire is least least desire
[44:50] smallest desire is a command to your
[44:52] Murtagh mother the big Commandments
[44:56] turn with the simple things the little
[44:59] things that God expects the little thing
[45:00] that God wants to see I said I have
[45:02] desires who have plans parents do to
[45:04] prosper plans of peace that that's his
[45:07] desire that's not a command but his
[45:09] least desire that's when you really be
[45:12] coming into warrior material when the
[45:14] least desire God is a command to you you
[45:17] say yes and you respond on a report for
[45:21] duty can the church see men oh
[45:23] [Music]
[45:27] brother brother branham's and I wonder
[45:30] question if the Warriors today those in
[45:34] the message today are willing to cut
[45:37] their way through formalism what's
[45:39] formalism formalism is the routine it's
[45:43] when it's become normal that at a
[45:45] certain time you get up understand me to
[45:47] get ready for church because it's a
[45:49] formality to be in church it's done the
[45:51] fulfilling of a desire it's a ritual
[45:54] like any other religion God has no
[45:56] respect for that because it's just like
[45:58] everybody else
[46:01] but God is looking for warriors who want
[46:04] to cut through the formality you're not
[46:07] here on Sunday because it's an
[46:08] expectation that you're here you're not
[46:11] here on Sunday because you're supposed
[46:12] to be here but you are here because his
[46:15] least desire is your command and he
[46:19] desires to commune with you this morning
[46:21] not your neighbor not your friend maybe
[46:24] not even your wife or your husband but
[46:25] you as a individual
[46:28] if your wife don't want it that's her
[46:30] problem if your husband was that's his
[46:33] problem you're sure I wanted that's
[46:35] their problem but for you his least
[46:38] desire is your command
[46:44] so he desires your worship it should be
[46:48] your command to worship never should
[46:50] have minutes after say lift your hands
[46:52] to worship never should've minutes after
[46:55] see stand to your feet because you know
[46:57] his desire is to see us a penance desire
[47:00] is to see you on fire his desire is to
[47:04] see you at the Holy Ghost but Abraham
[47:05] said God wants you to receive the Holy
[47:07] Ghost more than you want to receive it
[47:10] his least desire it's not my commander
[47:13] Lord I want the Holy Ghost the streamer
[47:15] you want to give it to me
[47:18] [Applause]
[47:18] [Music]
[47:19] [Applause]
[47:25] and when you break into his least desire
[47:30] as your commander then your desires have
[47:34] to take second place because it means
[47:37] whatever the king wants you are ready to
[47:39] do whatever the King needs you want to
[47:42] put him please whatever the king and
[47:44] when the King does this you want to be
[47:46] the one to put the cup in his hand
[47:47] because the least of these desires is
[47:50] your commander somebody same oh
[47:54] brother I wonder if the Warriors today I
[47:59] willing to cut their way through
[48:02] formalism you know how many people think
[48:05] that believing on Jesus and they're
[48:08] gonna go to heaven accordingly church
[48:09] and the Pentecostal oh and they have no
[48:11] clue that there's a hell door that road
[48:14] to hell is paved with great intentions
[48:16] if in church every Sunday me so go to
[48:17] hell I
[48:22] was sharing with some young people a
[48:24] couple weeks ago that give some callings
[48:26] out without repentance as the Bible so
[48:29] you see a gifted singer gospel singer
[48:31] gifted preacher speaking and the gift is
[48:34] from God it's not their gift
[48:36] it's a gift from God but that gift comes
[48:39] without repentance that's why brother
[48:42] Branham said God don't make half we're
[48:44] preachers but a preacher could be
[48:46] halfway Gordo Nick half with Christians
[48:48] but a Christian could be halfway
[48:50] [Applause]
[48:52] can the church say man
[48:54] [Applause]
[48:55] the least of your desires he said
[48:58] there's a better manner if it's Africa
[48:59] in the episode of Street wherever it is
[49:03] the least of your desires Lord is my
[49:06] command death don't mean a thing to me
[49:09] popularity my what I am what I will be
[49:12] means nothing Lord is to fulfill your
[49:14] desires that's the Warriors but the
[49:17] Branham said that's standing by the side
[49:19] of him if they call me a Holy Roller if
[49:22] my name is scandalized if they kick me
[49:24] in the street that doesn't matter your
[49:26] desire is my command that's the real
[49:29] soldier
[49:31] from the message as a man hit a cat or
[49:33] on the light but Abraham said so is it
[49:36] today the least of Jesus is sports
[49:39] or how about his word should be a
[49:43] command to reach and how to love him for
[49:46] we know he's coming into power no matter
[49:50] how much he's rejected heavens and earth
[49:53] will pass away but this will still rain
[49:55] just the same when all of us at it is
[49:58] gone and we know he's coming into power
[50:00] because nothing will keep it from
[50:02] happening and by the Branham pacts is
[50:04] viable
[50:05] this is Christ a revelation of him and
[50:08] this is going to happen just the way the
[50:10] word says it is because he is the word
[50:13] and the least of his commands there no
[50:16] matter how little it is whatever it is
[50:18] we'll do it anyhow it's his command
[50:23] and brother Branham said the least of
[50:26] David's thoughts was a command to those
[50:27] Gentiles for their type of the Gentile
[50:30] church today gallant men see those men
[50:33] who stood by dealing with Gentiles but
[50:35] gallant men do of the illness they
[50:37] didn't even know what fear was you read
[50:40] you too scripted over the time jesus
[50:42] said fear not
[50:43] fear not fear not
[50:46] the Bible says for he hasn't given us a
[50:48] spirit of fear
[50:52] Christians are free to pray I told young
[50:55] people young people are free to pray for
[50:56] their food in the lunch rooms and their
[50:58] jobs I'm free to have a testimony
[51:01] Young's is the free to dress modestly
[51:04] why you afraid to dress as a Christian
[51:08] men are free to take a stand for the
[51:10] kingdom afraid to say no when you are
[51:14] fighting for a kingdom that is the only
[51:16] Kingdom all else is false can the church
[51:19] say man
[51:20] [Applause]
[51:22] but the banner goes on what did they do
[51:25] talking about those warriors before they
[51:26] were true until they cut it and well
[51:28] they dip the pocket of water out and
[51:31] here they come back fighting cutting
[51:32] their way from right to left so
[51:34] therefore to reach to the well I know
[51:36] that to fight their way back to David
[51:40] and they coming to the president even
[51:42] say here you are my lord oh my oh
[51:46] my what a testimony
[51:52] and what did David do
[51:54] David to say Lord be it far from me that
[51:57] I drink this these Warriors jeopardize
[52:00] their life to go yonder and bring this
[52:03] water to me he said it's too much blood
[52:05] I can't do this and he he took that
[52:06] water and he poured it as a drink
[52:08] offering as a sacrifice to God
[52:17] but if Adam said if that wasn't mean it
[52:19] was only fulfilling the Scriptures
[52:21] because although Jesus from Bethlehem is
[52:24] the bread of life he is also the water
[52:26] of life and what did he do he was
[52:29] represented in both David and the
[52:32] Warriors because he was the king and he
[52:34] was the warrior he came and broke
[52:36] through the enemy lines and I believe
[52:38] this today we wanna break through some
[52:39] enemy lines break through some lines and
[52:42] I've had you trapped for a long time
[52:44] we're gonna break through those lines
[52:45] I've just come with the church and
[52:47] having church spirit and just being our
[52:49] wayward member or just being in the
[52:51] messy we are cutting through some lines
[52:53] today
[52:54] conquered death hell and the grave
[52:56] poured out his blood that John 3:16
[53:00] might be fulfilled
[53:02] can the church same so what are we on
[53:05] the expectation for church from mighty
[53:07] Gentile warriors to take their position
[53:11] to draw their swords and fight because
[53:16] enough is enough the enemy has had his
[53:18] time for a long time and I just gonna
[53:20] touch and that's why I read the
[53:22] Scripture in Hebrews because they were
[53:23] speaking of all the dut the judges and
[53:25] the heroes of feet and the warriors of
[53:27] faith who had to fight for every inch of
[53:29] ground it was never easy for anybody so
[53:32] don't think it's gonna be easy for you
[53:35] or easy it's never easy because it's a
[53:37] war it's a battle and wherever there's a
[53:39] battle that's way there's either a
[53:41] victory or there's a loss but out of
[53:43] this battle we are gonna have the
[53:45] victory can the church say man
[53:48] and all to the blabber you look at the
[53:50] book of Judges and stuff there was
[53:52] overcharged by the name of Shambhala
[53:53] anybody ever heard of Shama Shama I was
[53:56] just here minding his own business he
[53:58] wasn't even a soldier but when you read
[54:00] about Shama the Philistines will come
[54:02] and take away the crop whenever they put
[54:05] the crop in the barn the filicide will
[54:06] come and take the crop and just take it
[54:08] away and time after time he would do it
[54:12] and it takes a special something to go
[54:14] and keep working when you work hard and
[54:17] they're putting on the enemy take it but
[54:18] I'm gonna knew he had his family to feed
[54:20] yeah people depending on him he could
[54:23] just set him on say the enemy gonna take
[54:24] it so he kept on planting and reaping
[54:27] and the enemy kept on coming until
[54:29] chakra is your party say you know what
[54:31] enough is enough
[54:33] I'm not gonna allow the Philistines to
[54:36] come here anymore I'm not gonna depend
[54:39] on anybody else but this is my house I'm
[54:41] fighting for I'm not even calling for
[54:43] backup today is the wrong day for the
[54:46] Philistines I don't care there's one it
[54:48] was a hundred it was 630 today enough is
[54:52] enough and some God he didn't ever sword
[54:55] he didn't ever she'll get a spear I was
[54:59] a farmer
[55:01] you don't hear me to spear every sinner
[55:03] Samuel wasn't doing pull-ups Samuel was
[55:06] doing push-ups Santa wasn't matching
[55:08] left right left right sham de just had
[55:11] enough
[55:13] and sometimes at all it takes for you to
[55:16] reach the spot but you see I've had
[55:18] enough I don't care how much the enemy
[55:21] treats I don't care how many so let's
[55:23] and said enough is enough and the Bible
[55:26] says hunger you took an ox gold I know
[55:30] the young people they don't know what
[55:31] the Oxford is some you don't even know
[55:32] what the ourselves but when you want to
[55:35] move the Ox this little piece of wood
[55:37] almost like a key--and almost like a
[55:39] crop stick when he shall have a Prussian
[55:41] Cutlass no piece of wood to ends like
[55:43] this anyway use it a push to push the Ox
[55:46] up a little bit this is not a weapon
[55:49] just move a little bit you said a
[55:51] portion of coccyx move come on move on
[55:54] so I'm gonna look around Emma this was
[55:56] the wrong time to Philistine shoes to
[55:59] come by sanghas house
[56:01] scum but in final hole a pickaxe that's
[56:05] a sword a gun agree near somewhere grab
[56:09] the same Gorda yet been using his whole
[56:12] life it has pushed the oxen and as the
[56:15] Philistines came one by one one by one
[56:18] one by one
[56:21] oh you know hear me this morning I don't
[56:23] care what you have I don't know what you
[56:25] use them you have no excuse the problem
[56:28] is some of you do satisfy with the devil
[56:31] taking stuff from you but this morning I
[56:33] say enough is enough don't touch my
[56:36] prayer life don't touch me this morning
[56:38] not this morning not this morning oh
[56:42] [Applause]
[56:43] you may be seated
[56:46] hallelujah hallelujah the devil should
[56:50] have taken me out when he had the chance
[56:51] but I got my hand on my ox go this
[56:54] morning you should have done it last
[56:56] year when I didn't think about the Ox
[56:58] code but this morning but it's so I got
[57:01] the up school in my hand don't mess with
[57:03] me this morning because I'm gonna defend
[57:05] my house as for me and my house we will
[57:08] serve the Lord I'm tired of working and
[57:11] the enemy taking it away but this time
[57:13] I'm gonna claim my prayer life I'm gonna
[57:16] claim the holy dosa
[57:18] [Applause]
[57:20] come on you Gentile warriors pull your
[57:23] swords out pull your up school's out
[57:25] pull your pencils out pull something out
[57:28] but don't come here with just your hand
[57:30] alone put a piece of paper out because
[57:33] when he anointed comes a cup
[57:38] [Applause]
[57:49] enough is enough enough is enough how
[57:53] long you could be up and down come by
[57:55] the church you do know where you're
[57:57] standing this week you feel like praying
[57:59] next we could ever take your prayer your
[58:01] break on your bread corn on Summerhill
[58:03] you Capri for the whole week because the
[58:05] Phyllis I took your prayer life
[58:06] [Applause]
[58:08] one weekend on fire next week your
[58:11] honeymoon for the old service who is
[58:13] that the Philistines then come and take
[58:15] your praise away how long how long will
[58:18] you take before you reach the point will
[58:21] say enough is enough some of you got
[58:23] Phyllis ain't sitting on your hand right
[58:25] now you handle even want to get up your
[58:27] hands struggling to get up your hands
[58:29] fighting to get up but I believe there's
[58:31] some up schools in the house that you
[58:33] can just pick up that's it this hand
[58:35] this morning I haven't stood up in a
[58:38] long time I will worship in a long time
[58:41] my feet had some Phyllis hands on it but
[58:43] enough is enough mighty gentle warriors
[58:46] are getting ready we are campaigning as
[58:49] mighty gentle warriors because the king
[58:52] of kings and the Lord of lords
[58:54] he is mighty in battle
[58:56] [Applause]
[59:02] hallelujah oh I don't heal this morning
[59:05] I don't hear you this morning listen you
[59:08] may be seated you ever see somebody
[59:10] about to fight
[59:12] [Music]
[59:16] you may be seated when I was younger I
[59:20] tried to learn martial arts I wasn't too
[59:23] good at it but the instructor said you
[59:25] know what when you do this make a sound
[59:28] I was like why you gotta make yourself
[59:29] he said the reason you make a sound is
[59:32] it intimidate the enemy
[59:36] if you never see that before you get
[59:39] skill
[59:42] intimidate the enemy you see when you
[59:44] reach the point where enough is enough
[59:46] you will do anything I don't believe
[59:49] when Shamgar saw these men come at that
[59:52] time he's literally watching him quiet
[59:54] you know I believe Sharma Saturday make
[59:56] some noise
[59:58] because he was tired of the entire of
[1:00:02] losing the battle
[1:00:04] [Applause]
[1:00:08] and then there was one statement I
[1:00:10] believe Shama in his hat was saying was
[1:00:13] enough is enough listen goes for the
[1:00:15] signs you may be seated have to have
[1:00:17] rare belly even attacks hunger it might
[1:00:21] have been 600 of them you may be seated
[1:00:23] [Applause]
[1:00:27] left my notes already but it balance it
[1:00:30] all it takes is one you know all it
[1:00:32] takes is one it is one person who just
[1:00:35] get fed up as you say back you're just
[1:00:38] tired of just coming to church I'm going
[1:00:40] home with no blessing you that's tired
[1:00:41] you come to take your blessing you may
[1:00:44] be seated it just seems what I'm looking
[1:00:46] for one person this morning
[1:00:47] David had three men who ate and run I
[1:00:50] know I'm one I
[1:00:51] looking for two more to go at me to go
[1:00:54] bring back the drink of water because
[1:00:57] his knees desire is my command who will
[1:01:00] call into battle at meters you decent
[1:01:08] you may be seen it
[1:01:10] you see it just takes one
[1:01:16] there's a story of course it's not true
[1:01:19] but it's a feeble or a story I guess of
[1:01:23] some nice home mouse or whatever who
[1:01:27] were under threat from a cat
[1:01:30] and somebody came up with a brilliant
[1:01:33] idea
[1:01:34] why don't we hang a bell around
[1:01:38] the neck of the cat so that whenever he
[1:01:42] comes around we'll hear the bell ring
[1:01:44] and I will know we can go and hide
[1:01:48] somebody said that's brilliant and then
[1:01:51] the next question came up who will go
[1:01:54] and hang the bell on the cat
[1:01:58] [Applause]
[1:02:08] another analogy
[1:02:10] to see if there's one man in here with a
[1:02:13] gun one man just one man and the whole
[1:02:15] crowd is there there are enough people
[1:02:17] in here to overpowered and one man
[1:02:19] but he said none who is the one to go
[1:02:22] and fight this man with the one gun
[1:02:24] because the probability of you getting
[1:02:26] killed is very high
[1:02:29] so the point is don't try to corner
[1:02:32] somebody who reads a point of
[1:02:34] frustration and frustration could be
[1:02:37] negative or frustration can be positive
[1:02:39] a lot of people say I frustrated with my
[1:02:42] job I facili with my wife or shitty with
[1:02:44] my car but nobody was having an for city
[1:02:47] with the devil somebody was frustrated
[1:02:49] with the devil is a dangerous person
[1:02:51] because you are like the cat and those
[1:02:54] Phyllis's like the mice and they don't
[1:02:57] know who will put the bail on the cat
[1:02:59] and the moment you come out it glad to
[1:03:01] go running because you are coming down
[1:03:03] with a attitude you are coming out to
[1:03:05] conquer you are coming out for victory
[1:03:07] and I'm looking for some people
[1:03:10] you don't care what your family says
[1:03:13] about you you look at what your
[1:03:14] co-workers set up out you think you know
[1:03:16] what anybody says about you you want the
[1:03:19] promise of God for your life
[1:03:22] Brenda no friend family no family what
[1:03:26] are the hotels Oman it lucky middle
[1:03:28] holding also give me that give me my
[1:03:30] promise or give me that give me your top
[1:03:33] solo give me that give me skin science
[1:03:35] team oneness seven living voices me
[1:03:39] flips you knowledge is there anybody in
[1:03:41] the house this morning
[1:03:42] [Applause]
[1:03:46] mighty warriors
[1:03:49] you may be seated and
[1:03:53] I'm highlighting these elements
[1:03:56] deliberately for a reason the men who
[1:03:59] were with David were Radical men
[1:04:02] they were just covering my different
[1:04:04] clothes there were some stories and
[1:04:06] judges one man killed another man one
[1:04:08] man took a whole animal and open it into
[1:04:10] the kind of men David had were real
[1:04:11] serious recorded serious characters real
[1:04:14] real real serious men
[1:04:17] but some guys a different scenario
[1:04:20] some guys know Saudia but the need was
[1:04:24] great the situation was grave and most
[1:04:27] importantly he had just had enough
[1:04:30] he just reached his limit and you have
[1:04:34] to reach your spiritual limit of being
[1:04:36] up down your limit of depending on men
[1:04:39] and women to support you spiritually
[1:04:41] your limit of your prayer life being
[1:04:44] variable God is the giver permanence
[1:04:47] where whenever your cup run it just run
[1:04:50] over you have to be looking in a cup I
[1:04:51] wonder if I have anything no your cup
[1:04:53] running over that's that's his nice
[1:04:55] desire is your commander can the church
[1:04:59] see man
[1:04:59] [Applause]
[1:05:01] I
[1:05:02] pray this morning that in some way this
[1:05:07] will be an encouragement to you because
[1:05:10] many of us have the misguided mentality
[1:05:13] of depending on people to fix our
[1:05:16] problems to solve our situations
[1:05:18] recently I heard a professional make the
[1:05:20] statement he said don't get upset with
[1:05:22] me with my success because I have the
[1:05:25] same 24 hours you have and if you choose
[1:05:28] to spend 10 hours watching TV 6 hours on
[1:05:31] Facebook and I choose to spend my time
[1:05:33] studying reading praying then don't get
[1:05:35] upset with me because we got the same 24
[1:05:37] hours is how you use it so when people
[1:05:40] tell me they have no prayer life you
[1:05:42] don't want to come to church they got
[1:05:43] something my brother you are making an
[1:05:45] active choice to do stuff to slow down
[1:05:47] your spiritual progress it's time you
[1:05:50] say enough is enough there's no excuse
[1:05:52] for you not being in church
[1:05:55] no excuse I
[1:06:01] [Music]
[1:06:07] wanna read how about Eminem said this so
[1:06:11] you could just appreciate it and Justin
[1:06:13] either down he told much younger I know
[1:06:16] the first thing you know coming on the
[1:06:17] road here was stumping looked out what
[1:06:19] was coming to pass they come up 600 I'm
[1:06:21] at Philistines coming up to take his
[1:06:24] whole summer store we take his food for
[1:06:26] the winter
[1:06:27] he knew his wife would be stabbed out
[1:06:30] through the winter his chillin might die
[1:06:32] they were dying from malnutrition and he
[1:06:35] knowed Debby something happened he was
[1:06:37] concerned about his family notice one
[1:06:39] thing has got to be done to take care of
[1:06:41] this situation he studied at me see wait
[1:06:44] a minute I'm not a solid this is very
[1:06:45] random I know nothing but to use a sword
[1:06:48] or anything and then 600 against me how
[1:06:50] would I ever do it I'm standing here
[1:06:52] with a pair of farmers clothes or more
[1:06:54] like overalls and they all well trained
[1:06:58] warriors great big helmets on and breast
[1:07:00] split some things tree like one big army
[1:07:02] he steady he was concerned about his
[1:07:05] family but after a while he become
[1:07:07] convinced that he had a right
[1:07:10] he was a Jew he was circumcised he was
[1:07:14] in the covenant with God through the
[1:07:16] promise that he gave Abraham and he had
[1:07:19] a right that God would protect him from
[1:07:21] his enemies and the spirit come upon him
[1:07:23] he grabbed an ox Corder that's a little
[1:07:26] thing they punch the Ox wit he took that
[1:07:29] up school and jumped out the door and
[1:07:31] slew six hundred Philistines but the
[1:07:35] parent said oh if this group of people
[1:07:37] here tonight will get that much
[1:07:39] convinced
[1:07:42] what would this church - if this group
[1:07:45] of people here tonight will get that
[1:07:47] much convinced
[1:07:49] [Music]
[1:07:51] [Applause]
[1:07:55] come a message convinced I can see him
[1:07:57] Adam Adam said God only needs one man
[1:08:02] just I didn't get one man in his hand
[1:08:06] the world will think he's crazy but he
[1:08:09] will drive home the gospel when he's
[1:08:11] thoroughly convinced that Jesus Christ
[1:08:14] remains the same yesterday too deep and
[1:08:17] forever can the church say Amen
[1:08:23] somebody worship somebody worship Him
[1:08:26] this morning
[1:08:27] [Applause]
[1:08:34] but the banner dramatizes he said what
[1:08:37] if shunga had said no wait a minute
[1:08:40] I've got to wait til I see them coming
[1:08:43] and I better go away to school a little
[1:08:45] while and learn how to make a
[1:08:47] denominational Creed deal with them
[1:08:51] he said if he had done that that's all
[1:08:54] you would have known so he would have
[1:08:55] never done the job which is dueling he
[1:08:58] just took God at his promise that he
[1:09:00] would possess the heat of his enemy
[1:09:03] aren't you convinced tonight that the
[1:09:06] Gorda was in the Old Testament is the
[1:09:08] god of the New Testament and the same
[1:09:10] God to be the Bible says in Hebrews 13:8
[1:09:14] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:09:17] and forever
[1:09:18] [Applause]
[1:09:30] some design inspire you this morning so
[1:09:32] we talked about david's mighty men we
[1:09:35] talked about sham de and i want to kind
[1:09:37] of drive home this to really bring my
[1:09:40] thought together and you find this story
[1:09:43] in judges chapter six
[1:09:45] after the bora what Deborah was judge
[1:09:48] for about forty years Israel had a time
[1:09:51] of peace but invariably after a time of
[1:09:55] peace and everything of the Ryan people
[1:09:57] begin to lower their guard and fall back
[1:10:00] and get comfortable and the Bible says
[1:10:03] in judges six and one and a churn of
[1:10:05] Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord
[1:10:08] and listen carefully and the Lord
[1:10:11] delivered them into the hand of median
[1:10:13] seven years I
[1:10:15] try to get people to understand that
[1:10:18] actions have consequences
[1:10:22] people seem to believe and if you repent
[1:10:25] of a sin it removes the unsee Oh ends of
[1:10:29] it
[1:10:36] let me see that again
[1:10:37] the blood takes away the stain of the
[1:10:41] sin but your actions have consequences
[1:10:43] because God is a God of his would that's
[1:10:46] why I say the way of the transgressor is
[1:10:48] hard so you walk out the church and do
[1:10:50] your foolishness they are still
[1:10:53] consequences even when you come and make
[1:10:55] a life right you should have to pay the
[1:10:56] price for what you did
[1:11:00] so people think they could go on to
[1:11:02] other one I see a lot of sorry I come
[1:11:04] back and then what
[1:11:05] there are no consequences
[1:11:09] I'm gonna force the issue because he
[1:11:12] will not be mocked
[1:11:16] but at random many times for people who
[1:11:18] come Richard I want to repent and go
[1:11:20] back to the same thing you don't think
[1:11:22] God will take action for that
[1:11:25] so and the children of Israel did evil
[1:11:28] in the sight of the Lord and the Lord
[1:11:30] disciplined them and delivered them into
[1:11:34] the hand of median for seven years
[1:11:36] God allowed it to happen because the
[1:11:39] more you step away from the world his
[1:11:41] principles you cut off your blessing
[1:11:44] because you are under a different law
[1:11:46] you are look at the rest of the world
[1:11:49] because you are under a covenant and God
[1:11:52] holds you to that covenant can the
[1:11:55] church say Amen and the hand of median
[1:11:58] prevailed against Israel and because of
[1:12:01] the Midianites listen we talk about the
[1:12:04] America is amor by Zeb today
[1:12:06] we're gonna bring to a heavy media night
[1:12:08] and because of the Midianites the churn
[1:12:12] of Israel made them the dens which are
[1:12:15] in the mountains and caves and
[1:12:16] strongholds so instead of living on ice
[1:12:19] houses and lawn and pulling back and
[1:12:23] whoever the fellows living in caves and
[1:12:26] whole animals torn and tree and
[1:12:32] so it was when Israel had sown that the
[1:12:35] million eyes came up with their cousins
[1:12:39] their family the Amalekites and the
[1:12:42] children of the east
[1:12:43] even did the public says even did you
[1:12:46] say this all parties individuals
[1:12:48] and they came up against them each every
[1:12:50] issue a week people
[1:12:52] just like the Midianites the Amalekites
[1:12:55] we know they're bad and even people of
[1:12:57] the issue don't even have an army come
[1:12:58] up with them - and they
[1:13:01] encounter against them and destroy the
[1:13:04] increase of the it tilt oh come on to
[1:13:07] Gaza and left no sustenance for Israel
[1:13:12] no food for Israel verse 5 for they came
[1:13:16] up with their cattle and their tents and
[1:13:18] they came as grasshoppers for a
[1:13:20] multitude
[1:13:21] for both thee and their cameras wouid
[1:13:24] outnumber and the enter into the land to
[1:13:27] destroy it and
[1:13:29] israel was greatly impoverished because
[1:13:33] of the Midianites and the churn of its
[1:13:35] will cried unto the Lord I love that
[1:13:39] because whenever you move away from God
[1:13:42] move away from God disconnects that cry
[1:13:45] from God
[1:13:47] and that's what longs for that cried the
[1:13:49] relationship that that's actor
[1:13:51] communication because a lot of people
[1:13:53] the moment that get some blessing or
[1:13:55] comforta stop praying the stop crying
[1:13:57] and stop seek Him but all of a sudden a
[1:13:59] situation got so bad that the true
[1:14:02] Devils will begin to cry to the Lord
[1:14:06] [Music]
[1:14:12] and it came to pass when the churun of
[1:14:16] Israel cried unto the Lord because of
[1:14:19] the Midianites that the Lord sent a
[1:14:21] prophet unto the children of Israel
[1:14:24] which senator them that say the Lord or
[1:14:26] a vision I brought you up from Egypt and
[1:14:29] brought you forth out of the house of
[1:14:32] bondage and I delivered you out of the
[1:14:34] hand of the Egyptians and out of the
[1:14:37] hand of all that oppressed you and drave
[1:14:40] them out from before you and give you
[1:14:42] the land and I sell at you I am the Lord
[1:14:46] your God fear not the gods of the
[1:14:49] amorite in whose land he 12 but he have
[1:14:53] not obeyed my voice
[1:14:56] so calls reminding them of how powerful
[1:14:59] he is he is reminding them of what he
[1:15:02] has done he has reminded them of who he
[1:15:04] is who they are what a relationship is
[1:15:06] but he said because you have disobeyed
[1:15:08] me this is why you going through this
[1:15:12] is anybody with me this morning
[1:15:15] and they came an angel of the Lord and
[1:15:17] sat under an oak which was in Afra that
[1:15:22] pertained under Josh the abyss all right
[1:15:25] and his son Gideon Tresh suite by the
[1:15:29] winepress to hide it from the Midianites
[1:15:33] brother thrashing wheat by the winepress
[1:15:37] to hide it from the Midianites because
[1:15:40] he can't trust you wheat in the usual
[1:15:43] areas because it merely eyes watched you
[1:15:44] go behind the winepress I'm trusting you
[1:15:47] be there and the age of the Lord
[1:15:48] appeared to him and 7 him the Lord is
[1:15:50] with thee thou mighty man of Valor
[1:15:52] what a declaration so we moved from the
[1:15:56] Warriors of David to Sangha wide enough
[1:15:59] to a man who are serious serious serious
[1:16:01] we call that identity crisis inferiority
[1:16:05] complex
[1:16:08] boy i shy I ready nothing this shortened
[1:16:12] thing I am
[1:16:14] this is as much as I will lift my hand I
[1:16:17] come from a conservative background my
[1:16:19] family we are not that expressive if you
[1:16:22] come to our house everyone just sits
[1:16:24] down and stared one another we don't
[1:16:25] laugh at jokes we don't when I went to
[1:16:28] school I was like the only person doing
[1:16:30] what I did and just
[1:16:32] leave me by myself I didn't come to
[1:16:35] church to meet anybody and
[1:16:37] and the Lord appeared unto him and said
[1:16:40] the Lord is with thee tall mighty man of
[1:16:43] Valor
[1:16:44] but get in his shop with it though he
[1:16:46] said I'm kiddin said oh my lord if the
[1:16:48] Lord be with us
[1:16:50] why then is always befallen us and we
[1:16:54] all his miracles which our father told
[1:16:58] us off seeing did not the Lord bring us
[1:17:01] up from Egypt but no the Lord had
[1:17:03] forsaken us and delivered us into the
[1:17:05] hands of the mediator in other words
[1:17:06] Gideon saying we have learned about
[1:17:08] miracles but I haven't had my own
[1:17:10] miracle I
[1:17:12] know what to go on my father's miracle
[1:17:15] my grandfather's miracle I was all about
[1:17:17] it but if you are with us where are all
[1:17:20] the miracles and
[1:17:21] the Lord looked upon him and said go in
[1:17:25] this thy might and thou shalt save
[1:17:27] Israel from the hand of the Midianites
[1:17:29] have not like Cindy
[1:17:32] and he's never my lord where it's how I
[1:17:34] see this her behold my family is poor in
[1:17:38] Manasseh now he bringing out his
[1:17:40] credentials his resume

[1:17:44] this mia want my family is poor in
[1:17:48] Manasseh and I am the least in my
[1:17:51] father's house I
[1:17:54] think you have the wrong man
[1:18:00] and the Lord said unto him surely I will
[1:18:04] be with thee and thou shalt smite the
[1:18:06] Midianites as one man can the church say
[1:18:09] man I know for the young people young
[1:18:12] people you need to get into the Bible
[1:18:13] you know I see some people looking at me
[1:18:15] in shock lady never knew this was in
[1:18:17] there
[1:18:21] and as you read that I'm not gonna read
[1:18:24] all of it but Gideon asked goes for a
[1:18:27] number of signs are convinced that call
[1:18:30] is with him and go through them with the
[1:18:31] fleece and the dry fleece and the west
[1:18:33] freezer and then verse 7 chapter 7
[1:18:36] rather then jerubbaal who is he lien and
[1:18:39] all the people that were with him rose
[1:18:40] up early and pitch beside the well of
[1:18:43] Herod so that the horse of the
[1:18:46] Midianites were on the north side of
[1:18:47] them by the hill of Moreh in the valley
[1:18:49] and the Lord said to Gideon the people
[1:18:53] are with thee are too many for me to
[1:18:56] keep the Midianites into their hands no
[1:18:59] I want you to understand how God speaks
[1:19:00] God is seen all around fight and win he
[1:19:02] said I am giving them into your hands
[1:19:04] but it's too many
[1:19:07] listen why less Israel worn themselves
[1:19:10] against me seeing my own hand had saved
[1:19:14] me
[1:19:15] now therefore go to proclaiming the
[1:19:18] answer the people saying whosoever is
[1:19:21] fearful and afraid let him return and
[1:19:24] depart Ali from Mount Gilead and a
[1:19:28] return of the people twenty and two
[1:19:31] thousand and there he made ten thousand
[1:19:33] so 22,000 soldiers say you know what I
[1:19:38] can leave no problem
[1:19:43] take early part no hard feelings and
[1:19:46] they remain ten thousand verdict angry
[1:19:49] and the Lord of the kilian the people
[1:19:52] are yet too many bring them tone unto
[1:19:56] the water and I will try them for thee

[1:20:44] water and the Lord senator Gideon
[1:20:48] everyone and lapid of the water with his
[1:20:51] tongue as a door Lapid him shadow set by
[1:20:55] himself
[1:20:56] likewise everyone that bow down upon his
[1:20:59] knees to drink and the number of them
[1:21:02] that lapped putting their hands to their
[1:21:04] mounts were three hundred men but all

[1:21:46] ten toes a member only treated only 300
[1:21:49] the water lapis they are vigilant they
[1:21:53] on point because they understand that is
[1:21:55] wharfing and amateur didn't always
[1:21:57] warfare know the conventionally drinking
[1:21:58] awesome I
[1:22:13] can be criticized for preaching a simple
[1:22:15] message but I know when Jesus came he
[1:22:17] brought it so simple that the children
[1:22:19] could understand rather preach this way
[1:22:22] and people leave understanding the
[1:22:24] gospel Jesus and the message and they
[1:22:26] hear so much complicated thing you need
[1:22:28] to go get an encyclopaedia later to
[1:22:30] process finally words
[1:22:39] and the Lord started to Gideon verse 7
[1:22:42] by the 300 men that laughed when I save
[1:22:44] you and deliver the Midianites into that
[1:22:47] hand and let all the other people go
[1:22:50] every man under his place and now the
[1:22:52] battle staff and he divided a 300 men
[1:22:55] into three companies 100 100 100 and he
[1:22:59] put a trumpet in every man's hand with
[1:23:01] empty pictures and lambs within the
[1:23:03] pictures and he said unto them look on
[1:23:06] me and do likewise and behold when I
[1:23:09] come to the outside of the camp it shall
[1:23:11] be that as I do you want to do also I
[1:23:14] want to blow a trumpet I and all that
[1:23:18] are with me then blow ye the trumpets
[1:23:20] also on every side of all the camp and
[1:23:23] say the sword of the Lord and of Gideon
[1:23:27] are you ready are you ready
[1:23:30] so Qian and the hundred men were with
[1:23:33] him came unto the outside of the camp in
[1:23:35] the beginning of the middle of watch and
[1:23:38] they had but newly set the watch and
[1:23:40] they blew the trumpets and break the
[1:23:42] pictures that were in their hands and
[1:23:44] the tree companies blew the trumpets and
[1:23:47] break the pictures and held the lamps in
[1:23:50] their hands and the trumpet in their
[1:23:51] right hands a blow and they cried the
[1:23:53] sword of the Lord and of Gideon and it
[1:23:57] stood every man in his place wrong about
[1:24:00] the camp and all the hosts ran and cried
[1:24:03] and fled that the enemy the Muslim and
[1:24:06] the 300 blew the trumpets and the Lord
[1:24:09] said every man's sword against his
[1:24:11] fellow so I want you to picture this the
[1:24:13] children of Israel children men
[1:24:15] surrounding the camp bring pictures with
[1:24:18] a lamb through it a trumpet and people
[1:24:19] fighting on the among yourself
[1:24:22] that message from last week suddenly
[1:24:25] was such a blessing and no part of the
[1:24:28] fight because God confused their metal
[1:24:30] fighting
[1:24:30] [Applause]
[1:24:32] and the trio two men blew the trumpet
[1:24:36] and the Lord said every man's sword
[1:24:38] against his fellow even through all all
[1:24:40] the hosts and the hosts fled to Bechet
[1:24:43] sir in Jared enter the board off a
[1:24:45] Belmont in other words they're gone
[1:24:50] and the men of Israel gathered
[1:24:53] themselves together out of Naphtali and
[1:24:55] out of a shop and out of all Manasseh
[1:24:58] and pursued after the Midianites and
[1:25:01] Hylian sent messengers throughout all
[1:25:04] mount ephraim seen come down all those
[1:25:06] who hide him come down all those who
[1:25:08] have had a long time come down against
[1:25:11] the Midianites and take them out can the
[1:25:14] church demon
[1:25:14] [Applause]
[1:25:19] that's the Corby sir friends
[1:25:23] from the message thy seed shall possess
[1:25:25] the gate of his enemy but the Bantam
[1:25:28] said all these great warriors
[1:25:30] Gideon David Sampson Shama had to die
[1:25:34] because they were born and sin they were
[1:25:37] born by sexual desires sheep in iniquity
[1:25:39] come to the world speaking nice but
[1:25:43] being the promise being Abraham's seed
[1:25:45] by the promise that God gave Abraham
[1:25:47] these subdued kingdoms and wrought
[1:25:50] righteousness and stopped the mouths of
[1:25:52] lions and escaped the edge of a sword
[1:25:54] moved back waters and raised the dead
[1:25:57] for they were the seed of Abraham by a
[1:25:59] promise of God
[1:26:01] what he would do for them but then
[1:26:04] finally one day come the Royal seed not
[1:26:07] born of a man but conceived in a womb of
[1:26:09] a virgin by God himself with no sexual
[1:26:12] desire holy spirit born and when the
[1:26:16] Holy Ghost overshadowed a little virgin
[1:26:18] and conceived in the air the true seed
[1:26:20] of Abraham the fear that Abraham had in
[1:26:22] God God had made a promise of this seed
[1:26:25] born of a virgin but then he had power
[1:26:28] over all the kids of the enemy when he
[1:26:30] was on earth he had the kids of sickness
[1:26:33] in his power he spoke to the sick and
[1:26:35] the gates open up and they walked out
[1:26:37] free he had the keys the leprosy of
[1:26:39] cripples of affliction of temptations
[1:26:41] they smacked him in the face and and
[1:26:43] everything by pulling beard from his
[1:26:45] face and spitting upon him I'm trying to
[1:26:47] get him to do something wrong he said I
[1:26:49] could speak to my father and straightway
[1:26:51] he'd send me twelve legions of angels he
[1:26:53] could do it but he had the power why he
[1:26:56] had the taste that all those other
[1:26:59] warriors had done victories and so forth
[1:27:01] but he had to conquer that one who could
[1:27:04] not be conquered by these men those men
[1:27:07] could have conquered all kinds of
[1:27:08] someone yet to conquer what he could not

[1:40:01] [Applause]
[1:40:09] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:40:12] hallelujah
[1:40:14] the type in scripture is so perfect
[1:40:19] I'm trying to close out somewhere
[1:40:22] the Bible says that God delivered the
[1:40:26] churn of Israel but this even into the
[1:40:28] hands of the Midianites for seven years
[1:40:31] he could have said five years you're
[1:40:34] gonna step four yet but he saw seven
[1:40:36] years there's something what's that
[1:40:38] number seven because something happens
[1:40:40] after the seventh messenger comes he
[1:40:43] couldn't do it in the first year he
[1:40:45] couldn't do it in the second year he
[1:40:47] couldn't do it in the third year he had
[1:40:48] to wait until Cillian was in place and
[1:40:51] when he was in place after the seventh
[1:40:54] year now he's ready he see the sword of
[1:40:57] the Lord and of Gideon I declare this
[1:41:00] morning it's a small of the Lord and his
[1:41:03] bride because she is in opposition this
[1:41:06] morning
[1:41:08] [Applause]
[1:41:18] hallelujah greeting a little more I'm on
[1:41:21] page 58 of 70 a doriot small pages you
[1:41:26] may be seated
[1:41:31] so just the same way God had to wait for
[1:41:35] Gideon to be in this place
[1:41:39] God uses all kinds of people don't write
[1:41:43] me off because I'm shy don't write me
[1:41:45] off because I wanna fight but when the
[1:41:48] Spirit of the Lord come upon me you
[1:41:50] don't know what problem you gonna meet
[1:41:52] them don't look at my height don't look
[1:41:55] at my weight don't look at my color
[1:41:57] don't look at my country don't look at
[1:41:59] my mistakes
[1:42:00] because Gideon he failed God Samson feel
[1:42:04] God Stanga he was no saint but these
[1:42:07] were men who knew that he was a sin
[1:42:09] yesterday the same Turkey and the same
[1:42:12] forever so don't count me out because
[1:42:15] God hasn't counted me out can the church
[1:42:17] see man
[1:42:19] [Applause]

[1:42:30] seated I just want to drive this home
[1:42:32] it's when you watch these tips again I
[1:42:34] encourage you go and watch back the
[1:42:36] services so that you keep in the spirit
[1:42:38] and you know what to expect and you
[1:42:40] could now go through your life totally
[1:42:42] differently because if you feed on the
[1:42:44] teeth of the world your life will
[1:42:46] reflect the things of the world but if
[1:42:47] you've seen the things of God it's
[1:42:49] impossible for you to reflect something
[1:42:51] else if you feed on God on his word you
[1:42:54] can only live the word out and that's
[1:42:56] what God is looking for to be so real to
[1:42:58] me so tangible and his least desire is
[1:43:01] your commander you can't wait to be in
[1:43:04] the house of God you can't wait to be a
[1:43:06] midweek service you can't wait to read
[1:43:08] the pile you can't wait to testify
[1:43:10] because there's at least desires your
