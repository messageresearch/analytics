[57:09] Samaria and they were starving them to
[57:11] death so much so until they were eating
[57:14] the backk of the tree they were eating
[57:17] the grass on the ground they were eating
[57:19] one another's children because of the
[57:23] famine
[57:25] and the King joram was the king of
[57:27] Samaria and he was the son of the king
[57:29] of and Jezebel and there were seven
[57:32] years of famine in the land and K king
[57:36] banadad of Syria had surrounded samar's
[57:39] Army and starved them to death this
[57:41] famine was so bad until they were eating
[57:44] donkey's head and sold four square
[57:46] pieces of silver and the fourth part of
[57:48] a cab of doves D for five pieces of
[57:53] silver
[57:57] so he
[57:59] said so the fine was so bad until one
[58:02] day the King was walking on the wall and
[58:05] one woman screamed to the king he says
[58:06] oh King what shall I do he says me and

[58:25] and when you get out of the will of God
[58:26] there comes a famine a
[58:29] Salvation and and I feel brother that we
[58:32] are not immune from it and you find
[58:35] people in the message
[58:36] dying people in the PS are dying I'm
[58:39] going to read the quote people in the
[58:40] church are dying
[58:43] why the prophet says here and when the
[58:46] king he rent his clo and the King sent
[58:49] this is Elijah and we must cut off his
[58:52] head and then he sent a messenger
[58:55] hallelujah hallelujah but what happened
[58:57] before the messenger came Elijah already
[59:00] knew and Elijah said yeah he the word of
[59:02] the Lord before he could come with this
[59:05] message he has Elijah with this
[59:07] prophetic
[59:09] message the Lord Brother we lay our
[59:12] lives on this man and elishah said
[59:15] behold Hallelujah thus say the Lord

[59:32] report he said how can it be when you
[59:35] look at the condition how can God even
[59:37] if he opens the windows of Heaven how
[59:39] can this be and elishah looks at him he
[59:42] says man you will see with your eyes but
[59:46] you will not eat
[59:49] thereof hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[59:53] hallelujah father let me tell you
[59:55] there's many that seen it with their
[59:57] eyes but they can't eat their

[1:00:15] could even give his message and he said
[1:00:17] even Winds of Heaven it will never
[1:00:19] happen said you'll see with the eyes but
[1:00:21] you
