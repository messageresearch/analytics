God Jesus I just want to commit myself I'm going to commit the congregation into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen you may be seated just for a short while greeting my so uh yeah I'd like to greet the convention in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ especially brother Theo brother Isaac you know the headstone Ministry they've always been a tremendous blessing to us in South Africa and I think around the world and so it's uh it's an honor and a privilege to stand here this this morning now I think maybe I should actually tell you the story of how I ended up here this morning uh I think three or four days ago I was on the airport in Milan so it was just a layover to get to the meetings and I get a message from my dad and all it says is it says the the third service chorus leader and Minister and it says Luke Thompson no no more explanation just just that message comes and then a couple of minutes after that brother Theory the same message comes from Prada and I said to myself no ways because you know mentally you try to prepare yourself if you know you're going to speak you know this is this is out of us so it was quite a surprise but uh then I was thinking to myself you know I seem to have not had any say in this it was like I decided already so it doesn't even matter if I say listen I wasn't even consulted and then I thought okay you know what if you if you're a soldier and you get a command from a superior officer all you have to do is sir yes sir so uh I mean I'm standing here feeling that you know there's so much other minutes that I'm sure is a lot more capable but uh it's full in my lot and uh I have to obey what the superior officers said so the order came through I can't say listen no you have to send this one so Lord send me you have to pray for me you have to preach with me amen my what a blessing the meetings has been thus far you know I I I've been blessed Beyond brother Peter Chandler is a master of Keynote I mean you can give him any convention any theme Master keynote speaker so brother Peter we just want to thank you for that then brother Jason played it last night I mean it's difficult to come behind veterans like these so again I'm just requesting your praise and I just want to appreciate them you know for for the labors of Love across the years and standing for this message of the hour I'm the second generation so in other words I've been born in the message and uh you know we know these men has been standing for years and years and years contending for the face so we just want to appreciate them and uh you know and I also appreciate all the ministers that had greeted before you know Trinidad has got wow fireballs wow and brother Norris thank you for that you basically preached my old sermon so maybe I should just read the scripture and go my my so thank you for that and then brother auth Neil I think your song was was On Target thank you for that [Applause] so yeah uh that's the greetings I just also want to create again like all the local ministers as well and everyone that's online on the live stream uh I know that most is Tuning In from from back home as well so on behalf of my wife the family the Palm my pastor that's here as well we want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let's rise to our feet through the scripture reading so I've got three portions of scripture the first one is in Saint Luke 24 from one to six and then we'll just go further down to verses 29 to 32 and then x18 if you want to find that said Luke chapter 24 from verses 1 to 6 reads as follows now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the Sepulcher bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them and they found the stone rolled away from the sipica and they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus and it came to pass as they were much perplexed there up there about behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the Earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the Dead he is not here but he is risen remember how he speak unto you when he was yet in Galilee and then this is go to verse 24 sorry 20 29-32 but they constrained him this is now the road to Emmaus abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is fast spent and he went into Terry with him and it came to pass as he sat at meat with him he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them and the eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures and then the last one in Acts 1 8 just the one verse but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and he shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen amen so I want to just take a title the resurrected living Jesus Christ now the scriptures that were read is normally like a Easter message so I just want to uh you know forewarn you it's not an Easter message the prophet calls it he says it's an eternal spring and uh you know looking at the inspiration of the of the convention contending for the faith and I mean the again like I said the ministers that has gone before and even the ministers that had greeted how we understand that you know even the clip that brother Isaac and then put out you it's not a faith it's the faith so in other words there's one Faith one Lord one baptism and that is what we want to contend for now if the prophet had restored that faith we want to look at what that Faith was in the alpha bride to understand what it is because in containing for the faith the prophet says we we want to we want to know what it was what did the way what were they contending for and then he goes in in that message where he talks about he says you know that that when you was on Earth he was the faith he was the representation of the faith and when he was on Earth he disrupted Satan's kingdom in other words every time he would come across a funeral procession he would raise the Dead if you come across someone that is sick he would heal the sick if he comes across someone that's got blind eyes you would heal the blinded eyes that was the faith and so with his death burial in his resurrection so he dies but there was a promise of the father that was to come after and that the prophet says was also the faith now he says now now now this was when he was that one man he wreaked havoc on Satan's kingdom just in that one man he says so in other words Satan never got a chance just to be able to sit down because he had to be running up and down because God was creating havoc in his kingdom he was running a mock on humanities from the Garden of Eden and all of a sudden this man came he came into the flesh this was the word that he had become flesh he says and on the day of Pentecost the prophet puts it this way he says when three thousand Souls came to the to the Lord he didn't move one inch Satan but there was one thing that made him jump up from his seat he says that day when Peter and John came to the gate of beautiful after the day of Pentecost what was it he realized that okay now it's not just in this one man it's now in 120 . so what are they going to be doing to Satan's kingdom that was the face [Applause] the prophet says he jumped up because he realized now that these this is the same thing that Jesus was doing and now they're doing the same thing Why by that same life by that same anointing and the prophet came to restore that and that's the reason why he said to us he said I'm not here to build an organization I'm not here to build a message organization he says but he sent me to build individuals to become what powerhouses and a Dwelling Place all the Spirit by his word because that's what they were they were powerhouses and the prophet says if I represent that Faith that's what I come to do so this is what he said he says also now remember that when they were walking with Christ for that three and a half years they were being the son of man seed was being planted into them so in other words at the time when the Dynamics coming to us to Quicken that seed that was in them and that's the reason why the prophet said he says I was zealous of the kind of seed that I've been planting for the body why because the real rain is going to come he says and when the real rain come it needs seed to fall on in order to do what to produce Sons and Daughters of God now in earnesty containing for the faith the prophet says a little while in the world will see me no more yet you shall see me for I personal pronoun will be with you even in you until the end of the world he says the faith that he represented he delivered to the church he says now that kind of Faith the things that Jesus did the faith that he had in God in other words he had that Faith the father that was in him he had that kind of a faith in God that was dwelling in him he says he delivered that same thing to the Saints so notice the things that I do shall you also and this is what he delivers to you so according to Luke 24 20 49 Terry and wait up at the city of Jerusalem before you go to all the world with this gospel I want to go up to the city of Jerusalem and wait there until I come that was the promise if he's the one that's going to be in you it was him that come in spirit form so go up and wait for I'm going to send that promise of the father Mama let's give the Lord and a praise [Applause] earnestly containing 53. and this is where I got the inspiration for this message he says they had a faith in a resurrected living Christ someone who had rose from the dead and was living amongst them he says just the same as he ever was even before he died so the day that he died the heavens declared it the Earth declared that he died he says but they were because they they were they were the faith that they had was in a resurrected Christ he says and that is what they were contending for he says it wasn't some historical affair but they were contending for a living Christ they were contending for a resurrected Christ because he was in the midst now he says they believed that what he was in the flesh he was also an even more in spirit my my that's that's a powerful one he says that's what they that's what they believed and that's what they practiced he says and that is what God confirmed [Music] so for you and I it's not just a ritualistic affair absolutely a real living reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ he is living amongst men [Applause] that's the phrase that I'm trying my best to contain for today this is the prophet that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forevermore now he says he done two things with his death he says the one was that he died for The Sinner so in other words he came to complete the Redemption plan the requirements for the perfect lamb to die he says by that second thing was to restore the faith to restore the power and to restore the authority in the church let's give the Lord and Prince in fundamental foundation for Faith he says what did Christ redeem us for did you ever think what he redeemed us for why didn't he just make you the atonement and say now there's no need of giving them deep powers there's no need in making this man a Son of God there's no need in doing that I will just ask him to believe it and write his name in the book of heaven and that will settle it he says but he gave us these redeemed blessings that we might operate the work of God that you and I might operate the work of God this is why brother Norris is speaking about he says by what by the energy of the Holy Spirit my my why because I'm the vine you are the branches and the prophet says he throws his life into the branches because you are to obey the fruit so you are to operate the work of God by the energy of the Holy Spirit [Applause] let's give the Lord and the praise now if we come to do to my subject the scripture that we read they were all Witnesses of the Resurrection in a message proof of his resurrection the prophet speaks about it this way he says the resurrection is just as vital today just as real to every human heart that believes it so in other words if we preach it and we believe it we don't deny the power thereof he says it is absolutely vital for today he says as it was to Mary Magdalene and him that stood at the grave that morning who seen him and what happened he says and there her name is called so she was a witness to the resurrection he says and when she seen him she heard her name Mary the prophet says she turned around and said rabboni or master he says that's just as real to every artist morning that is Born Again of the spirit of God by the resurrection power now as it was to that woman standing there at that morning so it's just as vital for you and I today and what happened in this day in this age in this evening time message the prophet says that he is the seals that was open in other words when you open up the seals and he preached the Mysteries did you hear your name he said not all my Neville will leave Vail the mystery was preached but what did you hear you heard your name [Applause] so you are a witness to the resurrection of God he's the same yesterday today and forever my my mind that's the scripture that's what I believe to be the truth and that's what I accept he's the same in principle he's the same in power he's the same in his love he's the same in every way that he was then now God raised him up and if God hadn't been with him he would have never raised him on the third day he says the father that sent him was always with him went with him to the grave and he says and raised him up on the third day now I want to get to the road to be amazed because that's our type and I love it the way the prophet brings this one he says now they were followers of Jesus disciples cleopas and his friend is now downhearted on the road to Emmaus a man joins them and ask him why are you so sad and cleopas and his friends turns to this man and says but are you a stranger don't you know what happened Jesus the master has died he says he was this man that was approved of God by signs and wonders he says then we were following his ministry he says but now he's dead and this man tells to them and says but don't you know the scriptures don't you know that he was to come into the world to do this he was to come into the world to fulfill this [Applause] in order to do what he says to bring back that power to the church [Applause] now he says in proof of his resurrection he says do you know that he walked out under disguisement why am I he says and he appeared to them in the form of a man [Applause] if this is our type he appeared at this end time in the form of a man [Applause] but in the evening time he made like he was going to go by what did they do they said abide with us the prophet says and as soon as they come on the inside and the door is closed he said then he made himself made manifest [Applause] then he showed [Applause] so that they were so sad that it died I'm alive today just as I was in that day now this is our type now he says he made himself known to them by the way of doing something when he took the bread and he broke it in other words the opening of the word this was Christ is the mystery of God revealed and all along the road to Emmaus he was preaching he said the prophet says that was the church ages because all he was doing to them he was showing him in Luther that was me Wesley that was me Pentecost that was me now we're here now and now we're on the inside and now he's gonna reveal himself let's give the Lord and a praise and their eyes were open and they knew him now it'll be light in the evening time and what is the prophet says the path of Glory we will surely find now that email's experience is for you and I he says we know our Lord is risen from the dead for we've seen him and we know that he is real proof of his resurrection what it is is the last days that God is going to raise men with messages with power with Deliverance with the power of the Gospel to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forevermore the prophet says I know it sounds excitable no wonder we're living in an exciting time my my yes it is we're living in the last days when God through every holy prophet through all the Old Testament through the New Testament has prophesied that in the time or in the end time the same things that took place in the beginning would happen in the end time my my and as the darkness would Fleet away and the Gospel Light will shine across the corridors of the earth once more before the coming of the Lord and that was the ministry of the Prophet at the end time and that was the faith that He restored now I want to continue in Witnesses can you just give me a bit more volume on the monitors in promise of witnesses the prophet continues there he says they heard the Holy Spirit coming like a mighty rushing wind they saw tons of fire set upon each of them and they were both in I and in ear witnesses that God had fulfilled the promise of the father so in other words they were Witnesses of the Resurrection a coming Kingdom of Witnesses in a Witnesses of his resurrection there will be Witnesses of his power there will be witnesses that he is alive you are my Witnesses according to acts 1 8 Christ spoke of of it being his kingdom that was coming in power in the 16th chapter of Matthew verily I say unto you some standing here shall not see death until they see the coming of God of the king the the kingdom of God coming in power why because you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you that's the witness that God was looking for he says a witness after the Holy Ghost has come upon you but a witness of what a witness of the resurrected king that's the True Church of the Living God now he says if there is no Holy Spirit to vindicate it then I couldn't believe the resurrection I wouldn't have nothing but the theology I wouldn't have nothing but a mental conception he says but we have a direct Witness a direct Witness he says the holy spirit is the witness of the resurrection of Jesus because that's what he sent he said it's experience that I go so that I can send the promise of my father now the very things that I shall do you will do also even greater than this why because I go unto the father now for you and I he says that's the thing tonight he says not arguing of religion he says we don't want to be arguing about different phases or arguing about different church denomination he says or arguing about our different nations what the world needs to hear tonight or needs to know tonight is that Jesus has risen from the dead and he lives amongst men my mama let's give the Lord and a praise [Applause] so as the father and it will satisfy us now this is the same life force that was that produced the fruit so in other words if we look at what had happened in the alphabra the prophet says petite was an unlearned man you couldn't even sign his own name he says but what he was endured with power from an eye he says up until the time when he was his very Shadow would heal the sick the prophet says what was that that was the Dynamics in the quickening power he says that was the spirit of Christ in the apostles what was it it was the spirit of Christ in the apostles and that is the faith that they had in other words that this was a resurrected living Jesus Christ in the apostles [Applause] and he says now the spirit of Christ in the apostles was what was doing that 33 years later Jude said continually condemned for that face my my [Applause] God's provided away that's what it is today friend so many people are trying to get in but they're not taking God's provided entrance and if you go any other way besides Jesus Christ and when the apostles come into Jesus Christ when the early church came into Jesus they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost it made them a different people it made them act different it made them live differently their whole life was motivated different they had different motives they had different objectives everything was different when they come into Christ so that's what we want to do we want to come into Christ and the prophet says how he says by one Spirit are we all baptized into that same body my mama let's give the Lord and the praise I'm trying to go quick because we got three services for today so I don't want to take up too much time the Seal of the Holy Ghost is God's true Easter seal he says it's a man's credentials so a credentials is it your qualification the Seal of the Holy Ghost is a man's credentials in in other words he says it's your Birthright Miami he says it's your Birthright it's your credential that you have passed from Death unto life and God is now working through you the same way that he did with Jesus why because that's your credentials and these signs shall follow them that believe what were they they were believers they were Believers in the living Jesus Christ a living resurrected Jesus Christ and what did God do he says he confirmed it with signs following so the Lord himself went with him confirming it what was it it was the life that was in Christ that was raised up has come now and it quickened this church and lives in the church to do the same signs my my mind let's give the Lord and a praise now the prophet says that I represent that faith in through Easter seal the prophet says this if he can reveal now he's in discernment he says if he can reveal to me by his holy spirit the resurrected Christ who come here and give me a temporary Resurrection by my spirit listen to the prophet that my spirit goes away now and his Spirit comes in then to let you know whether he is alive or not why am I I represent this Faith the prophet was demonstrating it he says he gives me a temporary Resurrection by my spirit that my spirit goes away and ye Spirit comes in and then to let you know whether he is alive or not now I don't know you he says that's me and my spirit I don't know you he says we don't know you but he knows you now he wants to just borrow my body to prove that he is the resurrected Christ my my I'm so happy to loan it to him I'm so happy to loan my body to him so that the resurrected Christ can work through me oh this is our wave Chief this is the this is the faith that He restored you are showing exactly what they were doing he says I'm so happy to loan it to him to give it to him and anything he can get out of it and then he continues in the discernment he says you've seen somebody coming from a distance but I couldn't tell just where it was at yeah it's the man sitting right here I see him now he's a stranger to me also you got gallbladder trouble sinus trouble you're not from here you from Georgia a place called like aubamol Georgia all right believe now and go back home and be healed now the prophet was showing it now again I'm firing quickly because uh I don't want to take too much time in earnestly containing 56 the prophet says if a woman touched His Garment and he felt virtue go out of him and he does this and he doesn't do the same thing today then he's not the same but the scripture says that he's the same yesterday today and forever in other words he is immutable in all his way he's unchanging and the prophet says if that same Spirit dwells in you it will Quicken your mortal body but it will also do the very same thing that he done that that Spirit done when he was in his body now he says what did they touch him with they touched him with a face touch and brother Peter touching all of this he says even with blind but the Muse he says it was a faith cry because he had faith in the living Jesus Christ thing he says and that's how he touched him in Masterpiece he says now again I want to bring it back to the to the prophet now saying that he represents his face he says no to hear the life that was in the husk and in the stock and in the tassel uh is all gathered up now into the seed and the life that was in the stock went one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost we know this quote the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again to do what to manifest itself in other words to manifest the word again and I was thinking about it this way you know if the prophet was it was was was that wave shift to bring it back and and immediately I thought of Tommy Osborne's uh uh testimony speaking on brother Branham he says I saw Christ in that man I mean this this this was the wave Chief and he was showing exactly what kind of a faith they had the hand of faith in the in the living resurrected Christ that was in them he says until until you know the the character that he that he showed Tommy Osborne said I saw Christ in that man and that is what we want to come to as the as the Omega Prime this is what we want to contend for we want to contend to have the living resurrected Christ working in this bright body he says working in you waking working through you [Applause] now through Easter seal I don't care how many seals you try to put over it and he's talking about the Roman seal at the time when they when when he died they put him in the Tomb they sealed the tomb because they knew that there was a prophecy and they were scared that okay no the disciples will steal the body and say okay he's risen the prophet says now he broke that seal of the Tomb he broke the Seal of hell he broke the Seal of death he broke the Seal of the grave and he arose forevermore and triumphed over the grave deaths held tombs every manner every man might think that there was to show that he was God and cannot be sealed away from the people anymore he cannot be sealed away from the people anymore my my now God forever he says nothing can hold him the grave couldn't he says be dug deep enough or Hell couldn't be hot enough to keep him away for he that believeth in me the works that I do shall you do also and even greater than this because I go unto my father this gives the Lord and a praise what is the works of God it's the fullness of the power of the resurrection of Jesus the light has come out and the same holy spirit is the same move that it moved in the first church in the east the Eastern people has come out at the setting time on the western people bringing the same gospel that it that that it is to say the Full Gospel the fullness of the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ we're living in the setting of the Sun in other words the same way that that gospel came to them not in word only but in power it's come to you and I in that very same way now again coming back to the prophet now he says now again in Discerning he says she's here for some purpose now God knows that I don't know but if he reveals it then the Christianity of ad33 is in operation now in 1955. that's what he was demonstrating because that's what He restored I mean we can say the very same thing that same Christianity of 1833 operation in 1955 we're looking for it to be in operation in 2023 because that's the faith that was restored and the prophecy is that the bride coming of Christ and that's what we're going to be seeing and that's what we want to see that's what we want to contend for then it is the rising of the sun he speaks about the gasoline he says well you say the power is in the gasoline brother Brennan but I don't care how much power is in the gasoline unless there's a spark to manifest that power [Applause] there's a power there to confirm that that's gasoline in other words it can be a can of gasoline but how do we know that there might be water in there he says put a spark on it and then you'll see in other words we need them the the Dynamics to make that thing come alive he says the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move so we need that Spirit to make it move we have we have put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the Dynamics it needs the dynamic power of God he says the resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon the church to do what to manifest to bring to pass that this is gasoline we want the spark to prove to Satan that this is gasoline [Applause] why because the church is the word she is him [Applause] the prophet says he says listen to this it could still be water he says but the only proof of it is put this life on it in other words bring that life and put it on top of that day he says that will prove whether it's gasoline or not he says I'm so glad that there is a ten thousand octane power the word of God and the Holy Ghost to light it up to resurrect the power of God into a man's life or a woman's life or into a church that shove that Cadillac down the road Yonder under the Dynamics power of the Holy Ghost which came back and was waved over the people on the day of Pentecost making him what the same yesterday today and forever and he was waved in our day making him the same yesterday today and forever why because it was a combination of Dynamics and mechanics now the prophet says in the rising of the Sunday has been churches churches Brides brides he says but there has got to come one there has got the Dynamics and the mechanics together there has to come a real Pride that's God booth he says it makes that church move in the power of the Resurrection [Applause] if that Pride tree ever puts forth another Branch it will be exactly the same as that first Alpha bride why because she will move in the power of the Resurrection why because the Dynamics is what's moving her and the prophet says that will prove to Satan that he's alive a resurrected God in his church until that church becomes both mechanics and Dynamics the spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders she must also he hit on 16 cylinders the bride will also eat on 16 cylinders he that believeth on me the works that I do shall you do also why because I give you my charge of my Dynamics he says into your mechanics and the world will not be able to withstand it let's give the Lord and the prison the world will not be able to withstand it he says because I give you my charge of Dynamics into your mechanics he says now remember the mechanics without the Dynamics is no good and neither is the Dynamics without the mechanics no good he says well Paul said the gospel came to us not in word only in other words not through the gasoline only but through a spark to make it move my mind there you are it came to us in that manner and that is what this old Mega bride is going to have in the mechanics and the Dynamics together I want to read this quote here he says in the bride coming of Christ the coming out of the church they will have to be a sheath waived in the last days the waving of the Sheaf the first one that come to mature is the first one that proved it was wheat and that it would prove it was a chief I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waived over the people and the first time they will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denomination will be a message [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there why because I love you will love also he says he's speaking of his wife because I love you love also what a resurrection that was he says what the resurrection this is to be quickened from dead to be made alive in Jesus in Christ Jesus by what the quickening power my my he was waved to them the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost then the word came into a manifestation and it is waved again in this day praise we almost there in a second-handed Robi says we've got Pentecost he says but where is the god of Pentecost he says what's that's the next thing in other words if the baptism of the Holy Ghost gave away for the Holy Ghost itself to step forward the person of the Holy Ghost if Elijah is out typed in what did Elijah say they said where is the god of Elijah so in other words where is the god of Elijah we want the person of the Holy Spirit to step forth into his bright body if the servant of God does the work of God he has to have the power of God my my so the quickening power is what will produce it he says watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect Promise by the perfect word he says which is sharper than the two-edges sword and a discerner and the thoughts on the intents of the heart we're coming now to the Perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the rapture that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured faith he says looking for it it means a lot of Shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we're going to make it by the grace of God that's a promise that's a promise the prophet preached in perfect faith he says together we're gonna make it by the grace of God he says the Holy Ghost he says Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues sealed in you then God is living in a tabernacle called the building he says the living Tabernacle of the living God's dwelling place that's the powerhouse that's the dwelling place that's this bright body that is going to produce himself through a body that God can dwell in he says a body that God can walk in a body that God can see in he says he can talk in God can work in living instrumentality of God walking on two feet in you the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of God he says God is walking in you for we are written a person's red of all men and if that life that's in Christ is in you you will bear that life that Christ born my my and what is it that's the Thunder that will shake the devil the prophet says a holy consecrated life he says in the very same way that he shook the devil's Kingdom that time that's the Thunder that will shake the devil and listen let's say let's stand off if the musicians can come my my I wanted to fire quick I think we went well musicians can come up I wanna end up with this one thing and I mean it's two two short quotes proof of his resurrection the prophet speaks about this and and when I came across this quote you know it really blessed me because I was just thinking of it it sounded very familiar if you go to X3 Peter [Music] Peter and John comes to the gate beautiful and they see this lame man standing there and he's begging for arms and in the Scripture it says they turned and said to him look on us and the prophet says he says he was he thought okay by them saying that like you know he was going to be receiving something why did they turn around and they said he said they said but let's he said solvent gold every nun he said but there's something that we've got they had something that they were able to depart so in other words look on us and he turns expecting arms he says but this Peter turned around and said rise up and walk in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he says that was the life that they were imparting [Applause] why because they had a faith in a resurrected living Christ the very same way he was when he was on Earth before he died he was living amongst men now then I came across this scripture and that's why I said it sounded so familiar according to X3 the prophet brother Branham is in the discernment line again in 5504-10 you can play something first that's right but you see that he has raised from the dead you see that I've told you the truth then the prophet turns around and he says now look on me sir does that sound familiar I represent that faith he was demonstrating that faith he says look on me just a minute just in order that you and I could come in contact with the Lord Jesus the resurrected Lord Jesus if I be his servant Jesus said the things that I do shall you do also a little while in the world will see me no more that's the unbeliever that won't see him no more he says they're out at the ball games and swimmings and so forth they'll never see him but ye shall see me for I'll be with you in you to the end of the world then if he's raised from the dead and he is standing here this morning this is the prophet he says he's raised from the dead he's standing here this morning in the discernment line and this anointing that I have isn't mine does that sound familiar according to X3 he says this anointing that if isn't mine but it's his then you couldn't even hide your life if you had to because we in contact with one another by spirit being if God can reveal to me what you're standing there for will you accept it with your heart the brother says yes he says you will do it and then this is my final quote the quickening power wasn't only in the soul but it was all over them not only the Dynamics comes in to Quicken but it quickened the mechanics you see what I mean they were so quick until their tongues begin to speak in another language they were so quickened by the power of the resurrection of Christ until they laid their hands they were so quick and with the quickening power so when they laid their hands upon the sick they got well it quickens your mortal body they were healed by the laying on of hands the spirit quickened their Fellowship together with God told they also was so quickened into the presence of God until when a person died their soul had gone off it could be called back to life again that is the quickening power now brother sister that deity now is in you a little while in the world would see me no more yet you shall see me for I will be with you even in you to the end of the age Christ is in a Manger no it is Christ in you we're not worshiping Christ in a Manger but Christ in you the Holy Ghost the hope of Life The Creator God himself dwelling in the human being it does not yet appear what we shall be but we'll see him as is for will be made like him the spirit in the human being the resurrected living Christ may the Lord bless you my mama [Music] [Applause]
