[14:31] amen oh thank you Lord
[14:35] Jesus
[14:38] amen you may be seated for a few minutes
[14:41] before I get to the message this morning
[14:44] are you happy to be in the house of the
[14:46] Lord this
[14:47] morning there is life in the house of
[14:50] the Lord there is peace in the house of
[14:53] the Lord there's victory in the house of
[14:56] the Lord there's an anointing in the the
[14:59] house of the Lord there is Deliverance
[15:01] in the house of the Lord there is
[15:03] healing in the house of the Lord there
[15:05] is breakthrough in the house of the Lord
[15:08] David said I was glad when they said
[15:10] unto me let us go into the house of the
[15:13] Lord are you happy to be in the house of
[15:15] the Lord this
[15:17] morning amen you came to the house of
[15:19] the Lord to be edified to be
[15:21] strengthened to be encouraged to be
[15:23] built up and to make spiritual progress
[15:27] the saddest thing is a Christian is to
[15:29] be in the same position the same
[15:32] condition that you were in last week and
[15:34] you're in the same condition this week I
[15:37] pray that that cycle is broken today and
[15:40] every day becomes sweeter than the day
[15:43] before every day you see something
[15:45] clearer every day more Revelation every
[15:48] day more faith every day your faith is
[15:51] Anointed every day you are more a way
[15:53] that you are getting out of here and
[15:56] everything around you is a distraction
[15:58] and you recogniz that you are focused on
[16:01] that prize focused on the Holy Ghost can
[16:03] the church say
[16:04] Amen what can we say about the message
[16:07] last Sunday the Tim of the Gentiles you
[16:09] appreciate the pastor brother ID what a
[16:14] masterpiece and it was really such a
[16:16] blessing to see the grace of God to us
[16:19] that God blinded the eyes of the Jews to
[16:22] graft the Gentiles in so that we could
[16:24] have an opportunity to partake of his
[16:27] goodness that we could have an
[16:28] opportunity to access his goodness that
[16:30] we could have an opportunity to be HS as
[16:33] Royal seeds of Abraham because we didn't
[16:36] have a chance to begin with but God had
[16:38] certain attributes that he had to
[16:40] express so he had to stop the Jews to
[16:42] bring you in and the time is about over
[16:45] but before we leave this place God is
[16:47] going to do something for you he's going
[16:49] to do something for your family he's
[16:51] going to do something for your house
[16:53] he's not going to leave you unfinished
[16:55] but when it's finished he's going to go
[16:56] back to the Jews but he's still working
[16:58] on me he's still working on you and if
[17:01] you don't have the Holy Ghost count down
[17:04] it's coming count down it's coming you
[17:07] may not be healed yet physically seeing
[17:10] it but he paid for your healing all the
[17:13] way back on Calvary the devil is still a
[17:16] liar this morning the devil is still
[17:18] defeated this morning the devil is still
[17:21] a bluff this morning the devil still
[17:23] doesn't know who you are this morning
[17:25] but I believe we have a revelation this
[17:28] morning of who God is who we are and who
[17:31] the devil is and with that confidence we
[17:34] could come to church boldly we could
[17:36] come to church in faith we could come to
[17:38] church to possess What God Says belongs
[17:41] to us somebody say
[17:44] [Music]
[17:45] [Applause]
[17:51] amen and uh it's really
[17:55] mindblowing I shared this in maraval and
[17:57] in kupi as well well you don't have to
[18:00] find it yet but in Matthew
[18:05] 24:3 the Bible said as and as he sat
[18:08] upon the Mount of Olives the disciples
[18:11] came unto him privately saying tell us
[18:14] when shall these things be because the
[18:17] disciples had a revelation that time had
[18:19] to come to an end everything that had a
[18:22] beginning had to come to an end and the
[18:26] disciples didn't ask Jesus the question
[18:28] when everybody else was around they
[18:30] waited until they had him privately
[18:33] because these were the same disciples
[18:35] bear in mind this is Matthew 24 this is
[18:37] after Matthew 16 who do men say that I
[18:39] am these were the disciples coming to
[18:42] make sure that they don't miss
[18:44] it they didn't want to take a chance and
[18:47] miss it so when the crowd went away when
[18:49] the make Believers went away when the
[18:51] Pharisees and the sadu sees and those
[18:54] who just come to church because they
[18:55] want to come to church the disciples say
[18:57] Jesus Hallelujah there's nobody else
[19:00] here tell us what's about to happen what
[19:03] shall be the sign of thy coming and the
[19:05] end of the world and Jesus answered and
[19:08] said unto them take heed that no man
[19:11] deceive you the first phrase he said and
[19:12] that's what I shared on Thursday night
[19:14] in canopia take heed that no man deceive
[19:18] you for many shall come in my name
[19:20] saying I am Christ and shall deceive
[19:23] many many shall be deceived thinking
[19:26] that coming to church is all that is
[19:28] required many will be deceived thinking
[19:30] that because they're in the message that
[19:32] they're okay many shall be deceived
[19:34] thinking that's doing this or that will
[19:36] be all right but he goes on and
[19:38] says for many shall come in my name
[19:41] saying I am Christ and shall deceive
[19:43] many and he shall hear of wars and
[19:45] rumors of wars see that ye be not
[19:48] troubled for all these things must come
[19:51] to pass but the end is not yet for
[19:54] nation shall rise against nation and
[19:56] Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall
[19:58] shall be famines and pestilences and
[20:01] earthquakes in diverse places so that's
[20:03] why I always say the bride is not
[20:05] supposed to be surprised because these
[20:07] things are supposed to be happening
[20:09] there're supposed to be Kingdom against
[20:11] Kingdom there's supposed to be famine
[20:13] and God will turn the heat up because
[20:15] these things are supposed to happen he
[20:16] said all these are the beginnings of
[20:19] Sorrows they shall deliver you up to be
[20:22] afflicted and shall kill you and ye
[20:24] shall be hated of all Nations for my
[20:26] name's sake then shall many be offended
[20:30] and shall betray one another and shall
[20:33] hate one another and many false prophets
[20:35] shall rise and shall deceive many and
[20:38] because iniquity shall abound the love
[20:41] of many shall wax cold but he that shall
[20:44] endure until the end the same shall be
[20:47] saved and this Gospel of the Kingdom
[20:50] shall be preached in all the world for a
[20:52] witness unto all nations and then shall
[20:55] the End come so church I believe that
[20:58] the the time has come for us to take our
[21:00] position as the bride because we are not
[21:02] waiting on the world Russia is in its
[21:05] place America is in its place Isis is in
[21:08] its place the diseases are in their
[21:10] place all the criminals and the crime
[21:12] and the evil and the lust and the
[21:14] pornography it's all in their place but
[21:16] this gospel has got to be preached and
[21:19] then the end is going to come and my
[21:21] Bible tells me this gospel is not in
[21:23] word only but it's in power and
[21:26] demonstration so the gospel will be
[21:28] preached in power and demonstration and
[21:31] then the end will come in other words
[21:33] this gospel will be preached and the
[21:35] sick will be healed and then the end
[21:37] will come the gospel will be preached
[21:40] and the blind eyes will open and then
[21:42] the end could come so the end has to
[21:44] wait this morning because there are some
[21:46] Sons and Daughters who need healing this
[21:48] morning so the end has to wait you
[21:52] didn't hear me this morning the end has
[21:54] to wait until there's a demonstration of
[21:57] the Holy Ghost in your life the end has
[21:59] to wait so don't worry about the ending
[22:02] because God is waiting on you and I he
[22:04] wants to pour His holy ghost in
[22:07] [Music]
[22:09] you oh
[22:12] Glory
[22:15] Hallelujah hallu so I'm excited this
[22:19] morning because we are here to get
[22:21] marching orders we are here to get ready
[22:23] and we are here to give the devil the
[22:25] final knockout punch and I'm here to
[22:27] encourage your faith this morning
[22:28] because many times as a Christians we go
[22:30] through our ups and downs and our trials
[22:32] and our situations but this morning I
[22:35] want to preach about the blood because
[22:37] there's power in the blood and the blood
[22:40] prevails many time we forget that it's
[22:42] all about the blood and brother brandom
[22:44] said it's only under the shed blood we
[22:46] could have Fellowship so we are Under
[22:47] The Canopy of the blood this morning
[22:50] because the blood the Bible says speaks
[22:52] better things it speaks better than you
[22:54] could speak it speaks better than your
[22:57] family could speak when you you need a
[22:58] recommendation from somebody they could
[23:00] only say certain things about you but
[23:02] the blood is the best recommendation you
[23:04] could ever get because in your sickness
[23:07] the blood speaks of your healing in your
[23:09] depression the blood could speak and say
[23:12] you're coming out of it because there's
[23:14] power in the blood there's Life In The
[23:16] Blood there's blood for you there's
[23:18] blood for your children there's blood
[23:20] for your house there's blood for the
[23:22] back Siders there's blood this morning
[23:25] there's power in the blood the devil is
[23:27] afraid of the blood but the blood is
[23:29] going to Prevail thank God for the blood
[23:33] thank God for the cleansing blood so if
[23:35] you came in this morning and you came in
[23:37] with sin and condemnation there's blood
[23:40] this morning blood for your mistakes
[23:42] blood for your past so I don't care what
[23:45] happened yesterday I don't care what
[23:46] happened last week there's blood this
[23:49] morning put it under the blood and March
[23:51] all the way to the resurrection put it
[23:53] under the blood and receive the Holy
[23:55] Ghost put it under the blood under need
[23:58] the blood where the devil could do me no
[24:01] harm no harm no harm no
[24:05] harm that's the message it's a bleedy
[24:08] bloody message that's the gospel there's
[24:11] blood for you and when I see the blood
[24:14] I'm going to pass over you we got to
[24:17] apply the blood that's what we're going
[24:19] to speak in this morning we're going to
[24:21] apply the blood because when he sees the
[24:23] blood he doesn't see your mistakes oh
[24:26] when he looks through the blood uh he
[24:28] doesn't see your failures when he looks
[24:30] through the blood he doesn't see what
[24:32] you did 5 years ago when he looks
[24:34] through the blood uh he doesn't see that
[24:36] no he looks through the blood and under
[24:39] there there's something happening and I
[24:41] believe this morning God has some young
[24:43] people he's going to raise up because
[24:45] they are covered by the
[24:48] blood you may be
[24:51] seated Oh Glory to God when you get a
[24:55] revelation of the blood you get a
[24:57] revelation the devil is finished you got
[25:00] a revelation that the devil is the
[25:01] accuser of the Brethren you got a
[25:03] revelation that the devil is still
[25:05] walking about to and he and his demons
[25:07] accusing you you did that you made this
[25:10] mistake trying to get you to forget that
[25:13] there's a blood sacrifice for you he
[25:15] walks around reminding you of this
[25:17] thought and that problem that's his job
[25:19] to remind you but this morning we are
[25:21] here to remind you about the blood
[25:24] because the blood is life and the blood
[25:26] is the word and when you apply the blood
[25:29] the devil has to let you
[25:33] go Oh Glory to God so I pray that this
[25:37] morning you get a renewal of your mind a
[25:41] renewal of your heart as David said
[25:43] restore unto me the joy of my salvation
[25:47] it's hard to have joy if you're feeling
[25:49] condemned it's hard to have joy if you
[25:52] worrying about what you did but if you
[25:54] could apply the blood this morning the
[25:56] blood makes a way to free from
[25:58] condemnation the blood makes a

[28:25] Egypt this
[28:26] night and will will Smite all the
[28:29] firstborn in the land of Egypt both man

[28:36] Egypt I will execute judgment I am the
[28:39] Lord and the blood shall be to you for a

[28:53] to destroy you when I smite the land of
[28:56] Egypt I reading from Revelation CH
[29:03] 5 and reading from verse
[29:12] 1 and I saw in the right hand of him
[29:15] that sat on the throne a book written
[29:18] within and on the backside sealed with
[29:20] Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel
[29:23] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[29:25] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[29:28] seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor
[29:32] in Earth neither under the Earth was
[29:34] able to open the book neither to look
[29:37] thereon and I wept much because no man
[29:40] was found worthy to open and to read the
[29:42] book neither to look thereon and one of
[29:45] the elders saith unto me weep not Behold
[29:47] a lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[29:50] David hath prevailed to open the book
[29:53] and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and
[29:56] I beheld and low in the in the midst of
[29:58] the throne and of the four beasts and in
[30:00] the midst of the ELD still a lamb as it
[30:03] had been slain having seven horns and
[30:05] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[30:07] of God sent forth into all the Earth and
[30:10] he came and took the book out of the
[30:11] right hand of him that sat upon the
[30:13] throne and when he had taken the book
[30:15] The Four beasts and the four and 20
[30:17] Elders fell down before the lamb having
[30:20] every one of them HS and golden vials
[30:23] full of odors which are the prayers of
[30:26] saints and they sung a new song saying
[30:28] Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to
[30:31] open the seals thereof for thou was
[30:33] slain and Hast redeemed Us by thy blood
[30:37] out of every Kindred and tongue and
[30:39] people and nation and has made us unto
[30:42] our God Kings and priest and we shall
[30:45] reign on the Earth shall we bow our
[30:47] heads for a word of prayer our gracious
[30:49] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[30:51] your grace for your love for your mercy

[32:01] cross and may you speak to your church
[32:03] in the precious name of Jesus Christ and
[32:05] the church says amen and amen and amen
[32:09] you may be seated this morning
[32:10] Hallelujah so for a title this morning
[32:13] the voice of the blood the voice of the
[32:17] blood my subject this morning when I see
[32:21] the blood and my inspiration
[32:24] apply the token
[32:27] apply the token the voice of the blood
[32:32] all that we experience now is as a
[32:35] consequence of sin that entered in
[32:38] Genesis amen and after sin and man fell
[32:43] the Bible says in Genesis 4 and chapter
[32:45] 3 that in the process of time it came to
[32:49] pass that Cain brought of the fruit of
[32:52] the ground and offering unto the Lord
[32:55] and Abel he also brought of the
[32:57] firstlings of his flock and of the fat
[33:00] thereof and the Lord had respect unto
[33:02] Abel and to his offering but unto Cain
[33:06] and to his offering he had not respect
[33:10] and Cain was very wroth and his
[33:12] countenance fell and the Lord said unto
[33:14] Cain why art thou wroth and why is thy
[33:18] countenance Fallen if thou doest well
[33:22] shalt thou not be accepted and if thou
[33:25] doest not well sin lith at the door and
[33:28] unto thee shall be his desire and thou
[33:30] shalt rule over him and Cain talked with
[33:35] abrel his brother and it came to pass
[33:38] when they were in the field that Cain
[33:40] rose up against Abel his brother and
[33:43] slew him and the Lord said unto Cain
[33:46] where is Abel thy brother and he said I
[33:49] know not am I My Brother's Keeper and he
[33:53] said what hast thou done the voice of
[33:56] thy brother's blood
[33:58] cry it unto me from the ground now
[34:02] brother brandham taught us that the
[34:03] devil hates two books of the Bible in
[34:06] particular he hates the Book of Genesis
[34:09] and he hates the Book of Revelation
[34:11] because Genesis is where it begins and
[34:14] Revelation is where it ends but hidden
[34:18] there in the Book of Genesis there's a
[34:19] phrase that I love the voice of thy
[34:22] brother's blood cth unto me from the
[34:24] ground so way back in Genesis God is
[34:27] speaking about the the voice of the
[34:28] blood so Abel was dead but there was a
[34:31] voice in his blood that was speaking and
[34:34] this morning we want to speak about the
[34:36] voice in the blood because brother
[34:38] brandham said in the token he said Paul
[34:40] tells us speaking about the blood that
[34:42] the blood could speak he said you
[34:44] believe the blood speaks he said in
[34:45] Genesis God told Cain where is your
[34:48] brother the blood his the voice of his
[34:51] blood calls out against you and now we
[34:53] also find in Hebrews the blood speaks
[34:56] better things the blood is speaking then
[34:59] the blood has got a voice and the voice
[35:01] of the blood is the word hallelujah
[35:04] that's what makes it whether it's right
[35:06] or wrong the word is identified by the
[35:10] voice of the blood remember the brandom
[35:12] goes on he says the voice of the blood
[35:14] is the holy
[35:15] ghost that brings life it is life and it
[35:18] brings life to the word and quickened it
[35:21] so sure the blood speaks it speaks a
[35:24] better thing in the Old Testament the
[35:26] blood spoke of guilt in the New
[35:28] Testament it speaks of redemption in the
[35:31] Old Testament it spoke of death and
[35:33] sorrow in the New Testament it speaks of
[35:36] resurrection and life it speaks of
[35:38] healing it speaks of Joy it speaks of
[35:41] power that's the prophet it speaks of
[35:43] life it speaks of heaven so the voice of
[35:46] the blood has something to say this
[35:48] morning and that same blood brother
[35:50] brandham said that was shed upon the
[35:52] ground that called out after his dead
[35:54] brother or called out after his brother
[35:57] had killed them the blood of Jesus
[35:59] Christ covers all of our sins and speaks
[36:02] peace and Resurrection the power and the
[36:05] life and healing and brother Brandon
[36:07] said what we need is a blood transfusion
[36:10] so right now your blood is speaking
[36:13] something your life is speaking
[36:15] something but if you get a blood
[36:17] transfusion and the blood of Jesus Takes
[36:20] complete control of you then that blood
[36:23] has a voice and that voice will speak
[36:26] and when that voice speaks everyone has
[36:29] to take note because it is the voice of
[36:31] God and brother Bram said the voice of
[36:33] God is the Holy Ghost so God wants to
[36:36] bring a transfusion inside of your soul
[36:39] put you on the operating table and take
[36:42] out your blood take out your spirit take
[36:45] out your ideas take out your feelings so
[36:48] that his blood his power his Spirit his
[36:52] word his mechanics his Dynamics can
[36:56] begin to flow through you and the church
[36:59] amen oh Hallelujah blessed be the name
[37:04] of the Lord It's All About the blood the
[37:07] devil wants us to get tied up in your
[37:09] past and in your mistake but it's
[37:11] because of the blood you don't have to
[37:13] look at your past you don't have to look
[37:15] at your mistakes even brother branam had
[37:18] forgotten for a moment about the
[37:21] blood one day he said he was hungry and
[37:23] he went into a restaurant to eat you
[37:25] know the story and he went in there and
[37:27] and he saw a young girl and he said she
[37:29] was hanging over exposing herself and
[37:32] young men were flirting with her and he
[37:34] looked to this side and there was a old
[37:35] lady with all kind of makeup on her foot
[37:38] he spoke about it makeup on her hands
[37:40] dressed with a short skirt he looked
[37:43] this way he saw this he looked that way
[37:45] he said God aren't you going to judge
[37:47] this filthy world aren't you going to
[37:49] destroy this world is this the kind of
[37:52] world that my children have to grow up
[37:54] in and God tapped him on the shoulder
[37:57] and took him up into another realm and
[37:59] he showed him the whole earth and he
[38:01] showed him a red streak over the Earth
[38:03] and he showed him that streak
[38:05] represented the blood and every time he
[38:07] sinned but the brandom said God took him
[38:10] back to when he was a young man when he
[38:12] was a young boy and he was doing things
[38:15] he shouldn't be doing but God wasn't
[38:17] seeing them because every time he did it
[38:19] it hit the blood and it never reached to
[38:22] God so it's because of the blood so
[38:25] whatever your need is this morning put
[38:27] it under the blood put your situation
[38:29] under the
[38:31] blood you may be seated because the
[38:33] blood will speak when the devil says
[38:36] you're guilty the blood is your lawyer
[38:39] the blood says not guilty I don't have
[38:41] every evidence I don't have any evidence
[38:44] because the blood is speaking this
[38:45] morning so your doctor says you are sick
[38:48] but the blood says you are well this
[38:50] morning
[38:54] the can the Church Say Amen
[38:58] oh
[38:59] Hallelujah brother brandom said we must
[39:02] believe for ourself like they did down
[39:04] there in Egypt for the house like they
[39:07] did in Egypt and Jericho and so forth we
[39:10] find out I got a scripture here acts 16
[39:12] this is where the r I'm speaking where
[39:14] the Roman Centurion was to take his own
[39:17] life and he was going to stab himself to
[39:19] death and Paul told him believe on the
[39:21] Lord Jesus Christ and die and thy house
[39:24] will be saved it's got to be a household
[39:27] so brother brandom was kneeling down
[39:29] about the blood applying to your
[39:31] household so I don't care what condition
[39:33] your son your daughter your family is in
[39:36] if you apply the blood on the household
[39:38] it covers your
[39:40] household stop worrying stop talking and
[39:43] just apply the blood it's all about the
[39:46] blood the devil wants you to look at
[39:48] them and God is only looking at the
[39:50] blood can the church
[39:52] amen listen to The Prophet what makes so
[39:56] many women on the street what makes so
[39:59] much juvenile delinquency it's because
[40:02] we're not able to get our household
[40:04] under the blood amen amen Amen brother
[40:08] Bram goes on some people say well I
[40:10] belong to church mother went up there I
[40:12] was dedicated as a baby brother brandham
[40:15] said you must display the token yes sir
[40:18] move out all the worldly trash all the
[40:21] things of the world because you can't
[40:23] love the things of the world all your
[40:25] unbelief in God's words remember he
[40:27] promised that these last days anything
[40:30] in your life that's against that move it
[40:32] out and get ready to bring the token in
[40:36] then apply the token how in prayer with
[40:39] Consecration and be convinced and
[40:41] concerned about it can the church say
[40:44] amen amen so I want you to understand
[40:47] Hallelujah man fell that's and once man
[40:50] fell sin entered in the camp and because
[40:53] of sin a sacrifice must be made because
[40:56] sin has consequen
[40:59] sin must be judged God is a just God sin
[41:03] must be judged so God is waiting for
[41:05] somebody to get a revelation to deal
[41:08] with this sin problem so by Revelation
[41:11] Abel recognized that his condition
[41:13] wasn't worthy to go in the presence of
[41:15] God he's by Revelation he recognized
[41:18] that he just he could just come to
[41:19] church with his past and his job he had
[41:22] to come to church with a certain
[41:23] approach he had to have a certain
[41:25] approach and by revelation he got
[41:27] quickened with understanding and he went
[41:30] and he looked for a lamb and he found
[41:32] one and he killed the lamb and God was
[41:34] pleased because God said yes you should
[41:37] have died but that lamb took your
[41:39] place I should have killed you but that
[41:41] lamb took the place and when I saw that
[41:44] blood I realized that I could spare you
[41:46] because that lamb took your
[41:49] place do you understand that you were
[41:52] born in sin shaped in iniquity and every
[41:55] mistake you made God had every right to
[41:56] kill you if it wasn't for the blood
[41:58] you'd be dead already but there's a
[42:00] blood sacrifice there's a blood offering
[42:03] offered for you that you could have life
[42:07] and have it more abundantly somebody say
[42:09] amen that's why brother the brandom said
[42:11] it's nothing but the grace of almighty
[42:14] God we should even be here this morning
[42:17] but he left the glory come down as a
[42:20] former from man and put his body on
[42:23] Calvary and he died and he paid the
[42:26] price and he shed his blood because
[42:28] there were some people that had to come
[42:32] forth you may be seated God was not
[42:36] going to let the devil have the final
[42:38] statement about what happened there in
[42:40] Genesis God was not going to let the
[42:43] devil have the final say God is saying
[42:46] my blood is going to speak when you are
[42:48] depressed and you can't even talk the
[42:50] blood is going to speak whenever you
[42:52] can't even worship the blood is still
[42:54] speaking because there's power in the
[42:56] blood is life in the
[43:00] blood oh
[43:02] [Applause]
[43:06] Hallelujah so Abel got that Revelation
[43:09] Kain also had a
[43:12] revelation brother brandom said they
[43:14] were both spiritual that's right Cain
[43:16] wasn't in a party Kane came to church
[43:18] that's right to bring his sacrifice but
[43:21] his sacrifice was the fruit of the field
[43:23] his sacrifice was his intellectual
[43:26] conception of what God would want
[43:29] because God is looking for fruit and
[43:31] Kain said it has to be this kind of
[43:32] fruit so he went to get all the natural
[43:34] fruit and put together nice
[43:38] presentation Hallelujah and many times
[43:40] we want to bring our beautiful idea to
[43:42] God and say Lord take this I've studied
[43:44] so hard take this this is My Sacrifice
[43:47] I've done this and done that and God I
[43:49] want you to take this and God is looking
[43:50] for the blood can the church say Amen so
[43:54] there's power this morning in the blood
[43:56] Hallelujah but the hard thing was before
[44:00] Jesus came they were under the law
[44:02] that's right that's right and they had
[44:04] to kill the Bulls and the goats and the
[44:06] law was hard in Galatians 3 Paul says
[44:10] Christ ha redeemed us from the curse of
[44:12] the law being made a curse for us
[44:16] because the law was hard do this don't
[44:18] do that do this don't do if you do this
[44:20] no one could be pure enough under the
[44:22] law Hallelujah no one could be good
[44:25] enough under the law no one could be
[44:27] holy enough to obey the law the law held
[44:31] men in bondage and showed almost every
[44:34] imperfection in humanity but the blood
[44:37] of Jesus freed us from the curse of sin
[44:40] and freed us from the curse of death
[44:42] every other day under the Old Law you
[44:44] have to kill a lamb you have to kill a
[44:46] goat you have to kill a but when Jesus
[44:48] came and shed his blood
[44:51] that took care of everything no more you
[44:55] to go through the routine his blood
[44:57] conquered everything it was no longer a
[45:00] ritual it was no longer a tradition but
[45:03] his blood broke the
[45:05] veil to the holies of holies his blood
[45:08] give you access his blood give you
[45:11] rights because when you apply the blood
[45:13] you could access your healing can the
[45:16] church say
[45:18] Amen oh
[45:22] Hallelujah I hope this trigger something
[45:24] in your heart this morning that's what
[45:26] Redemption is all about the lamb that
[45:28] was slain before the foundation of the
[45:30] world everything in the Old Testament
[45:32] with a shadow or a type of the Lamb that
[45:34] was going to come when Jesus walked the
[45:36] Earth they didn't realize he was the
[45:38] lamb that was filling all fulfilling all
[45:41] scripture he said I don't come to fight
[45:43] the law I come to fulfill the law
[45:45] because there are some people they're
[45:46] not born under the law they are not
[45:48] natural Jews but they are spiritual Jews
[45:51] but my blood will make a way for them My
[45:54] Sacrifice will make a way for them
[45:56] listen it's not how much you read it's
[45:58] not even about that but it's because of
[46:00] the blood can the church say
[46:04] Amen Adam lost the title
[46:07] deed Adam lost his right Adam lost his
[46:11] inheritance and that deed went back in
[46:14] the hands of the original own that book
[46:16] was sealed and John wept because he
[46:20] looked to the left he looked to the
[46:22] right he looked up he said in heaven on
[46:25] everywhere under the Earth there was
[46:26] nobody found worthy John by Revelation
[46:30] he knew that that book was the key to
[46:32] the power he knew that that book was the
[46:35] key to Restoration John knew he wasn't
[46:38] in the position he was born for but he
[46:40] knew way back in Genesis when Adam stood
[46:43] he could speak and whatever he said had
[46:45] to happen John by Revelation knew from
[46:48] the moment he was born there was
[46:50] something wrong with the world by
[46:52] Revelation he knew when he got sick this
[46:55] cannot be how it's supposed to be he
[46:58] knew when the devil brought thoughts to
[46:59] his mind this cannot be what my life is
[47:02] about so John wept because by Revelation
[47:06] that book held the mystery of redemption
[47:09] that book held the mystery of
[47:12] restoration in that book was the power
[47:15] that was for you in that book was the
[47:17] power for you to speak to your children
[47:19] come back preach back to me this
[47:22] morning oh you don't hear me this
[47:24] morning so John was crying John was in
[47:27] the spirit he was caught up he wasn't in
[47:30] the world he was crying he was in the
[47:32] spirit and he was waiting for somebody
[47:35] is there anybody who could unlock the
[47:37] mystery of who I am is there somebody
[47:41] who could open the book because my name
[47:43] has to be somewhere is there somebody
[47:46] who could unlock the key to my future is
[47:49] there somebody who could unlock the key
[47:51] to where I come from because I come from
[47:54] God I know I come from God I know I'm
[47:57] going back to God but I don't know
[47:59] because I can't see my
[48:04] name
[48:05] hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated
[48:09] and in the midst of John's turmoil in
[48:12] the midst of John's questions in the
[48:15] midst of John's depressions John was
[48:17] caught up in another place but he wasn't
[48:20] happy he was caught up in another place
[48:23] because he couldn't go back to where he
[48:25] came from because that book had to be
[48:28] unsealed for Redemption complete
[48:30] Redemption to take place and that's what
[48:33] we are looking for total Redemption
[48:36] Total Restoration total
[48:39] Deliverance can the church say amen
[48:42] that's what I need to go back back to
[48:45] where I would have been if Adam didn't
[48:47] [Applause]
[48:51] fall oh Hallelujah you may be seated
[48:57] hallelujah hallelujah nobody could
[48:59] redeem nothing unless there's a kinsman
[49:02] redeemer only a family only somebody
[49:05] like you could redeem you so God left
[49:08] glory and put on 16 elements and the
[49:12] Bible said he was tempted just as we
[49:14] were tempted he walked the road just as
[49:17] you walked the road he saw sin and he
[49:19] turned away he lived just as we did he
[49:22] got depressed he got upset he was hungry
[49:26] he went to a fig tree there were no figs
[49:28] on the tree he cursed the tree it died
[49:30] from the root at the grave of Lazarus he
[49:33] cried and wept because he felt the pain
[49:36] and the loss of what death represented
[49:39] but locked up in him was resurrection
[49:41] and life but he had to
[49:44] die and blood had to be shed blood was
[49:47] the password blood was the key blood was
[49:51] the key to unlock it so John he didn't
[49:53] see the full mystery but all of a sudden
[49:56] of voice screamed out stop crying John
[49:59] stop being depressed John come on John
[50:02] stop worrying about your problem come on
[50:04] John stop being upset stop being
[50:07] frustrated stop being confused of if
[50:10] you're going to get the Holy Ghost stop
[50:12] worrying about whether you're going to
[50:14] get adopted stop worrying about your
[50:16] children weep
[50:18] not weep
[50:22] not hallu Hallelujah everybody feeling
[50:26] fine this morning morning Hallelujah
[50:28] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[50:31] the root of David have prevailed and
[50:34] instead of a lion walking out here comes
[50:37] a bleedy bloody lamb here comes the
[50:39] bleedy bloody Messiah here comes the
[50:41] word of all ages here comes the god of
[50:44] creation Here Comes L Elohim Here Comes
[50:48] El Shai Here Comes Jehovah chyra here
[50:51] comes the lily of the valley here comes
[50:53] the bright and Morning Star here comes
[50:55] the fairest of 10 th Here Comes God
[50:59] himself bleeding bloody a lamb and he
[51:03] took the book he took the book he took
[51:06] the book that held your name he took the
[51:09] book that held the mystery of who you
[51:11] are because the devil could only hold
[51:14] you but once that book opens the devil
[51:16] has got to let you
[51:18] go if you don't know who you are the
[51:21] devil could hold you but when that book
[51:23] opens he has no right he has no power he
[51:26] has no Authority because if your name is
[51:29] in there if your name is in there you
[51:31] got to be over there oh you don't hear
[51:34] me this
[51:38] morning Hallelujah and the lamb he be to
[51:42] open one seal he opened another seal he
[51:45] opened another seal he opened the fourth
[51:48] seal he opened the fifth seal he open
[51:50] the six seal he opened the seven
[51:55] seal you may be seated hallelujah
[51:58] hallelujah hallelujah because of the
[52:01] blood because the sacrifice was paid the
[52:04] key to the seals were unlocked and in
[52:08] 1963 seven angels come up from eternity
[52:12] but the BAM said each angel came to him
[52:15] to speak about each Church age God
[52:17] opened his mystery to his Prophet but
[52:20] his Prophet couldn't say it in
[52:24] full every seal had a people every seal
[52:28] had a mystery first seal second seal
[52:31] third
[52:33] fourth fifth to the
[52:35] Jews come on six is the Judgment
[52:40] seal Hallelujah but when you open the
[52:42] seven sealen there was
[52:45] silence there was a mystery there was no
[52:48] noise there was no sound when you open a
[52:51] seven
[52:52] [Applause]
[52:55] seal silence
[52:57] space of half hour brother brandom said
[53:00] mystery people got confused in the
[53:03] message because everything that had a
[53:05] beginning has an ending at the beginning
[53:08] of the seventh seal it was a mystery but
[53:10] there's a finishing of the seven seal
[53:13] when it will no longer be a mystery when
[53:15] the silence will be over and there will
[53:17] be a people who were hidden under
[53:21] there hidden under that
[53:24] seal you Jesus
[53:29] you may be seated everybody feeling fine
[53:32] everybody know where they come from you
[53:34] are the Fulfillment of Prophecy the
[53:36] devil has no clue because John was told
[53:39] to seal it don't write it thank you
[53:42] Jesus because if the devil only finds
[53:44] out who the secret agents are on the
[53:46] earth who will take over who will
[53:49] overthrow the political system and the
[53:51] religious system God deployed some
[53:54] secret agents from under the seven seal
[53:57] the CIA a't got nothing on the seven
[53:59] seal the FBI ain't got nothing on the
[54:01] seventh seal secret agents predestinated
[54:05] from before the foundation of the world
[54:07] some of them don't even know each other
[54:09] but all of a sudden you find yourself
[54:11] gathering with strange people God bless
[54:14] you where you come from I don't know
[54:16] where your family is but there's a pull
[54:18] from on high something sto me when I was
[54:21] drinking one day I I read a book I heard
[54:23] a tape somebody invited me I didn't even
[54:26] know I was an agent but I have by
[54:28] Revelation I see my name on the book I
[54:32] don't know how it's all going to unfold
[54:33] just yet but I know I'm a man on a
[54:36] mission I know I'm a man on a mission
[54:38] because they are sick that are going to
[54:40] be healed there's blind that eyes have
[54:42] to open and God has no eyes but your
[54:44] eyes he has no feet but your
[54:49] feet can the church say Amen do we have
[54:53] fire in the house this morning do we
[54:55] have sons and daughters who know who
[54:57] they are this
[54:58] morning you may be
[55:00] [Applause]
[55:05] seated
[55:07] [Applause]
[55:12] hallelu Hallelujah I'm not too old but
[55:16] when I was younger I used to love to
[55:18] read books about secret agents when I
[55:21] was younger when I saw Ten Commandments
[55:24] I wanted to be Moses when when I saw Ben
[55:26] her I wanted to be Ben her when I read
[55:29] about secret agents I wanted to be a
[55:31] secret agent little did I know that I'm
[55:34] a secret I'm a mystery I come from God
[55:37] and I'm going back to God the devil
[55:40] couldn't even figure out who Jesus was
[55:43] if thou be if thou be and the devil is
[55:46] morning he's looking around he already
[55:49] has the world but he's wondering if thou
[55:51] be the bride then do this I got no
[55:54] answer for the devil I'm not argue with
[55:56] the devil there's a power coming into
[55:58] the church and now it's coming in when
[56:01] the bride will speak and whatever they
[56:03] say
[56:07] will you may be
[56:10] [Applause]
[56:13] seated so God Amen kept me from being a
[56:16] natural amen secret agent amen amen this
[56:19] country is too small anyway to have real
[56:22] secret agents
[56:26] but in the bigger countries they have
[56:28] whole secret units that go around the
[56:31] world and stuff to protect the country
[56:34] and protect the
[56:36] kingdom but what's interesting about
[56:38] these secret agents sometimes countries
[56:40] may send a child in yes at a young age
[56:44] and have them grow up in that other
[56:45] country as if they are living there
[56:47] their whole lives and they're just
[56:49] waiting to be
[56:51] activated sometimes they don't even know
[56:53] where their Heritage are they think they
[56:54] might be adopted and maybe from this
[56:56] country and that country and they go to
[56:58] school there because the country wants
[56:59] them to be like that country but then
[57:02] one day they get the instructions now
[57:04] you've been activated we need to go and
[57:06] do this and do that and do that so God
[57:08] had to find a way to slip some people in
[57:11] through the seven seal he played some in
[57:13] ARA played some in portter Spain play
[57:16] some in Maro slip them in the jobs in
[57:19] this job and in that job and you went to
[57:21] school like everybody else and you went
[57:23] to your job like everybody else and you
[57:25] ate in KF like everybody else and you
[57:27] eating chaps like everybody else but
[57:29] little does the devil know that there's
[57:31] some secret agents moving around the
[57:33] town waiting for the manifestation of
[57:36] the sons of God when born Sons filled
[57:40] Sons
[57:41] [Applause]
[57:46] speak can the church say Amen you
[57:49] appreciate the Lord this morning you
[57:51] thank God for the blood made a way for
[57:54] you to be here this morning
[57:58] [Applause]
[57:59] you may be seated we're doing good this
[58:02] morning last week the Pastor said make
[58:04] sure and eat breakfast yes and buckle
[58:08] your seats in that's right because we
[58:09] come to get ready for Spiritual takeoff
[58:12] Hallelujah spiritual astronauts getting
[58:15] ready to leave this place and we should
[58:17] at least give God a day or two or three
[58:19] in the week because we getting ready to
[58:21] get out of here so we're supposed to be
[58:22] so happy to come into the house of God
[58:25] the presence of God God we we can get
[58:27] instructions on how to Leave the World
[58:29] Behind and disconnect all the cords
[58:32] they're trying to hold their spaceship
[58:33] down you got to cut all the cords God so
[58:37] that when the magnet comes to pick you
[58:39] up there's no hindrance there's no
[58:40] obstacle your job doesn't matter your
[58:43] mortgage don't matter your mortgage is
[58:45] not your problem it'll be the bank
[58:47] problem when that time
[58:52] comes Hallelujah
[58:56] amen so listen
[58:58] carefully I believe it's March 24th 1963
[59:02] but the random said the third pull is
[59:03] coming
[59:04] up but certain signs had to take
[59:09] place now if you followed by the br's
[59:12] message in the summer of
[59:13] 1963 he began to preach certain things
[59:17] the seven seal itself couldn't break to
[59:19] the people because certain signs had to
[59:21] come forth certain people had to be here
[59:23] because every seal has a people
[59:26] so brother Brandon was speaking to a
[59:28] people that were Yet to
[59:31] Come can the church say amen and you
[59:34] have to realize that when a man speaks
[59:36] by faith like Paul Paul says we who are
[59:39] alive and remain Paul put himself in
[59:41] there he wasn't say you who are alive
[59:43] and remain he thought he was going to be
[59:44] there but you have to speak by faith
[59:47] because now Faith is so you don't push
[59:49] it to the future but you speak by faith
[59:50] so but the Bram is beginning to put
[59:52] things in place so he preaches in
[59:55] warning then judgment
[59:57] then he speaks to Third Exodus then he
[1:00:00] preaches why Christ speak he's moving on
[1:00:02] he's waiting for something to happen
[1:00:04] every message was leading up to
[1:00:06] something then he moved into a specific
[1:00:09] message called the
[1:00:11] token which by Brother bram's own words
[1:00:14] he called it his greatest
[1:00:17] message the token he said you must apply
[1:00:21] the
[1:00:23] token amen can the Church Say Amen
[1:00:27] he told us by faith to apply the token
[1:00:30] because the token is all about the
[1:00:31] coming of Christ it's all about the
[1:00:33] third pull it's all about the seven
[1:00:37] seal and the token could have only been
[1:00:39] applied after the prophet in the
[1:00:41] fullness because the Full Life of Christ
[1:00:44] the full word had now been
[1:00:47] restored and now God could come to claim
[1:00:50] his own so with said the blood this
[1:00:54] Blood we're talking about is in the
[1:00:56] person of the word so every service that
[1:01:00] you come to you are applying the token
[1:01:02] upon your house by feasting on the word
[1:01:07] in other words when you make a mistake
[1:01:09] and you fall short and you put a tape on
[1:01:11] and you get in the spirit that's
[1:01:13] applying the token hallah to your life
[1:01:16] covering your life with your blood and
[1:01:18] then all of a sudden conviction hits
[1:01:20] your heart and you say wait a minute I
[1:01:21] didn't know that was wrong something
[1:01:23] convicts you and then you repent that's
[1:01:25] the blood atonement that's
[1:01:28] right Hallelujah because this thing
[1:01:30] we're talking about there will be no
[1:01:32] impersonation to it amen hallelujah this
[1:01:35] is not something you sign up for and say
[1:01:36] sign me up sign me up put my name down
[1:01:39] no it's not that it's something that you
[1:01:41] have to do apply the blood to your house
[1:01:44] Hallelujah yourself amen I said this on
[1:01:47] Tuesday night in maraval I said the
[1:01:49] Pastor cannot apply the blood on your
[1:01:52] house Moses told the people kill a lamb
[1:01:56] prepare
[1:01:58] yourself put the blood on your house
[1:02:02] Moses had to make sure the blood was in
[1:02:04] his house that's right you have to make
[1:02:06] sure the blood is in your house that's
[1:02:08] right your children may understand it
[1:02:10] but the blood that's right has to be on
[1:02:13] the house because they can be contrary
[1:02:15] but if they are underneath the blood
[1:02:18] when I see the blood I'll
[1:02:21] pass over you
[1:02:28] somebody say Amen so this mystery is a
[1:02:32] total secret because God always had an
[1:02:35] elected bride who would hear the
[1:02:37] countdown and they would make ready
[1:02:41] hallelujah thank you Jesus it'll be the
[1:02:44] word age it'll be the bride age it'll be
[1:02:46] the call out age headd there at the end
[1:02:49] of the Le ofan age and not one word can
[1:02:54] be broken that's right many people say
[1:02:56] all kind of things in the message and
[1:02:57] they say all kind of stuff but this is
[1:02:59] still the message of Luther plus the
[1:03:02] message of Wesley plus the message of
[1:03:05] the Pentecostal plus what brother manam
[1:03:07] restored amen so the requirement for
[1:03:09] this age is everything that is gone
[1:03:11] because we have the fullness of the word
[1:03:13] and the fullness of the word brings a
[1:03:15] fullness of the atonement can the church
[1:03:17] say
[1:03:18] [Applause]
[1:03:20] Amen don't break one word of it so God
[1:03:26] hid the
[1:03:28] message he hid the blood on books and
[1:03:32] tapes prise God Waiting for the End of
[1:03:36] the Age Hallelujah waiting for the seven
[1:03:38] seal the finishing of the seven seal
[1:03:41] waiting for you to be here waiting for
[1:03:43] everything that has taken place to take
[1:03:45] place for what a short quick message
[1:03:49] that will shake the whole nation can the
[1:03:53] church say Amen so we are in the called
[1:03:56] out time and we have a hope this morning
[1:03:59] the signs are all around us and we are
[1:04:01] in the time of his coming Hallelujah and
[1:04:04] God is pulling a gentile bride into her
[1:04:09] position it is because of the blood we
[1:04:12] could have Fellowship that's right
[1:04:14] friends if under the blood of bulls and
[1:04:16] goats Moses could speak flies if under
[1:04:19] the blood of bulls and goats Moses could
[1:04:21] speak frogs if under the blood of bulls
[1:04:24] and goats Joshua could say son stand
[1:04:26] still what about our day when we have
[1:04:29] the fullness of the
[1:04:32] atonement hallelujah what power will be
[1:04:35] locked up in this bride Hallelujah now
[1:04:38] listen carefully the word in each age is
[1:04:42] the blood of that age that's right
[1:04:44] that's right so if you receive the word
[1:04:46] the blood sanctifies you the blood
[1:04:47] cleanses you but there's another element
[1:04:49] yes tell us because brother brand and
[1:04:52] through the scripture we see it's water
[1:04:53] blood spirit so God baptized the Earth
[1:04:57] in the days of Noah when Jesus came the
[1:04:59] blood fell on the earth and there's
[1:05:01] something remaining which is what
[1:05:03] fire water Blood Fire so friends the
[1:05:09] blood takes away your sin but there's
[1:05:13] still a desire in your heart that has to
[1:05:15] be changed and only fire could deal with
[1:05:18] that desire so that's why you need the
[1:05:22] Holy Ghost you need an experience you
[1:05:25] need a baptism you need fire because
[1:05:29] even though there's blood speaking for
[1:05:31] you the blood is speaking for you until
[1:05:33] you get in touch with the fire and the
[1:05:35] fire takes complete control and now you
[1:05:38] are evidence of the whole mystery of God
[1:05:40] in your life when you repent you're
[1:05:43] baptized the blood speaks for you and
[1:05:45] now fire takes over completely Burns
[1:05:48] that demon in your heart out and
[1:05:51] now you are son Pillar of Fire in your
[1:05:54] heart adopted son when you speak the
[1:05:57] Devils tremble you don't even have to
[1:05:59] speak because the light is the thunder
[1:06:01] that shakes the devil when you walk the
[1:06:03] street the devil crosses the street
[1:06:05] because you
[1:06:06] are a manifested son of God
[1:06:11] Amen that's
[1:06:14] it so the word for each age is the blood
[1:06:17] for each age which means there's a blood
[1:06:19] for our age yes because the word for our
[1:06:22] age or the virtue for our age is
[1:06:24] brotherly kindness that's it amen that's
[1:06:26] it so it's only through brotherly
[1:06:29] kindness only through the blood of the
[1:06:31] age of forgiveness we could even talk
[1:06:34] about charity
[1:06:36] Hallelujah because charity is where we
[1:06:38] need to reach because when you read the
[1:06:40] Bible you could have all kinds of gifts
[1:06:43] all kind of Revelations speak in tones
[1:06:46] amen amen and have
[1:06:50] nothing you could have an experience and
[1:06:52] you still up one day you still down one
[1:06:54] day you're on fire last week and this
[1:06:55] week the devil get run for your
[1:06:59] money under the blood you have a perfect
[1:07:02] standing but there's a perfect state to
[1:07:04] come and under the perfect state which
[1:07:06] charity brings you to the perfect State
[1:07:08] there's no more backsliding there's no
[1:07:10] more depression there's no more
[1:07:11] frustration there's no more sickness
[1:07:13] there's no more sadness because you are
[1:07:15] now totally transformed redeemed
[1:07:18] complete can the church say
[1:07:21] Amen so God wants you to not only have a
[1:07:24] perfect standing Hallelujah but a
[1:07:26] perfect State no more ups and downs no
[1:07:31] more in and out no more toss to and fro
[1:07:34] by every wind of Doctrine no more being
[1:07:38] confused no more wondering if you're
[1:07:40] going to make it no more I don't know
[1:07:42] where I stand no more fighting to get
[1:07:45] time to pray no more you don't know
[1:07:47] where your Bible is no more you don't
[1:07:49] know what the prophet said all of a
[1:07:50] sudden you have a perfect standing you
[1:07:53] have a perfect State the devil knows
[1:07:54] don't mess with that one don't mess with
[1:07:57] that one and all God is saying there's
[1:07:59] my spirit flowing freely there's my
[1:08:01] spirit flowing freely he's 12 years old
[1:08:03] but my spirit is Flowing freely she is
[1:08:05] 16 years old my spirit is Flowing freely
[1:08:07] he is 99 years old and my spirit is
[1:08:10] Flowing freely can the church say
[1:08:12] Amen hallu oh walking in charity so this
[1:08:17] message this morning is to the
[1:08:19] individual amen for every man to examine
[1:08:23] himself because they are lost sheep
[1:08:25] right here in the church people who sit
[1:08:28] and come to church every service and
[1:08:30] they have yet to apply the token the
[1:08:33] only encounter with the Supernatural is
[1:08:36] when they come to church on a Sunday but
[1:08:38] applying the token is a
[1:08:40] everyday walk hallelujah hallelujah you
[1:08:44] can't put on the blood today and take it
[1:08:46] off tomorrow because you don't want
[1:08:47] anybody to see it we may get to it but
[1:08:50] brother brandham said when they told him
[1:08:52] to apply the blood and the door post God
[1:08:54] wanted it visible
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:08:57] and that's why I say to the young people
[1:08:58] a people have to wonder if you're a
[1:09:00] Christian something is
[1:09:02] wrong because the evidence of your
[1:09:04] Christianity should be displayed people
[1:09:07] must look at you and say that one is
[1:09:09] different that one is different because
[1:09:11] the token is undisplayed the token must
[1:09:14] be displayed when I see the blood I'll
[1:09:17] pass over you so there should be no
[1:09:20] question about who your father is who
[1:09:22] your God is you are not ashamed to a
[1:09:25] testimony you're not ashamed to dress
[1:09:27] like a Christian walk like a Christian
[1:09:30] worship like a Christian pray like a
[1:09:31] Christian because you know who you are
[1:09:34] and you have applied a token on your
[1:09:38] house from the message Christ is the
[1:09:41] mystery of God revealed look only in an
[1:09:45] individual this is but random never in a
[1:09:47] group an individual not in a group his
[1:09:51] identification is with an individual you
[1:09:54] get that not not with the Methodist not
[1:09:56] with the Baptist not with the
[1:09:58] Presbyterian not with the Lutheran not
[1:10:00] the Pentecostal but as an
[1:10:02] individual and it's so important that
[1:10:05] you get grounded with this because you
[1:10:07] will have to stand alone that's
[1:10:12] right the test is when you alone many of
[1:10:15] us pass what I call the church life
[1:10:18] test that's just that's you you're in
[1:10:20] church on Sunday and everybody knows
[1:10:22] you're Christian for that period of time
[1:10:24] that you're in church that that's called
[1:10:25] The Church Life
[1:10:27] test but God is not judging you on how
[1:10:29] you are when you in church
[1:10:31] hallelujah what God wants to see is how
[1:10:34] you are on Monday how you are on Tuesday
[1:10:37] what happens on Wednesday when the boss
[1:10:39] gets you upset he wants to see how you
[1:10:41] are then that's what he's interested in
[1:10:43] when your wife says something to you and
[1:10:45] you know you didn't like it and
[1:10:47] you you have the best response ready to
[1:10:50] go but you're still your
[1:10:53] tongue and temperance takes over that's
[1:10:56] what he wants to see
[1:10:58] amen when your children get you up a
[1:11:00] wall but yet you have patience and they
[1:11:02] don't even know why you have this
[1:11:04] Comfort but you have a comforter because
[1:11:06] he promis to never leave you or forsake
[1:11:08] you to be a comfort that's what he wants
[1:11:09] to see you could wait on God to answer
[1:11:13] your prayer because God as brother over
[1:11:15] said a few weeks ago he is not going
[1:11:17] he's not here to answer your greed he's
[1:11:18] here to answer you need yes so have the
[1:11:21] things you want God said you're not
[1:11:22] getting it Hallelujah that's why your
[1:11:25] press should be Lord not my will but th
[1:11:28] will be done you will stop getting
[1:11:30] disappointed when you start to pray for
[1:11:32] his will to be done Lord I want this I
[1:11:34] want this and God say no denied denied
[1:11:36] you know you apply for something and
[1:11:38] you're waiting for approval God say
[1:11:39] denied denied not that not that because
[1:11:41] God wants the best for you he knows
[1:11:44] what's best for you he knows what you
[1:11:46] need to bring out a character in you so
[1:11:48] stop asking for stuff he not going to
[1:11:50] give you but say Lord not my will but
[1:11:53] thy will be done
[1:11:55] but what he promised you you have every
[1:11:57] right to claim it he promised you your
[1:11:59] family he promised you Joy he promised
[1:12:02] you peace he promis you the Holy Ghost
[1:12:04] he promises Supply your
[1:12:09] needs can the church say amen hallelujah
[1:12:13] hallelujah I'll take one I'll leave one
[1:12:16] I'll separate them that's right there'll
[1:12:17] be two in the field I'll take one and
[1:12:20] leave one there'll be two in the bed
[1:12:22] I'll take one and leave one it's not a
[1:12:24] group
[1:12:25] no so to go in the Rapture friends you
[1:12:29] must display the
[1:12:31] token that's the only way the token must
[1:12:34] be displayed the devil has a response to
[1:12:37] your scriptures the devil has a response
[1:12:39] to your quotes but the devil has no
[1:12:41] response to the life Hallelujah when
[1:12:43] that life tunders Out the Devil have no
[1:12:45] answer he just have to walk away but you
[1:12:47] could debate scripture all day long and
[1:12:50] that's why listen I'm so careful now
[1:12:51] people who say all kind of stuff about
[1:12:53] the prophet and the message and they
[1:12:55] have this position and this opinion and
[1:12:57] the simple basic script is they don't
[1:12:59] want to live it show me the life amen
[1:13:02] show me the life years ago brother keman
[1:13:04] said show me a church with the fullness
[1:13:06] of the signs and the wonders in it show
[1:13:08] me if not we are contending for it we
[1:13:11] are contended for the life we are
[1:13:13] contended for a manifestation so don't
[1:13:15] get upset with me when I'm crying and
[1:13:17] I'm pleading and say Get Right with God
[1:13:19] we are contending for something because
[1:13:22] judgment the Bible says begins in the
[1:13:26] sanctuary judgment begins in the church
[1:13:30] and brother brandham said God will send
[1:13:32] situations into the church send
[1:13:34] situation into your family send
[1:13:35] situation into your house just for one
[1:13:38] purpose to prove the character that you
[1:13:40] have because power has got to come and
[1:13:42] God will not give power to people with
[1:13:44] no character can the church say Amen so
[1:13:47] this morning the devil thought you'd be
[1:13:48] backslid but you are here because the
[1:13:50] blood is speaking for you this morning
[1:13:53] the devil taught you to be depressed but
[1:13:54] you are here because the blood is
[1:13:56] speaking the devil taught you to be dead
[1:13:58] but there's a blood sacrifice for you
[1:14:00] and because of that blood sacrifice we
[1:14:02] have access access rights to God this
[1:14:05] morning can the church say
[1:14:08] Amen from the message the world is
[1:14:10] falling apart but said friends we are
[1:14:13] not promised a system Jesus wouldn't
[1:14:16] have nothing to do with a system we
[1:14:18] wasn't promised a system we are promised
[1:14:20] a kingdom and how do you get into it by
[1:14:23] one Spirit we are all baptized into this
[1:14:26] Kingdom it's the kingdom of God it's the
[1:14:29] kingdom of eternal life can the church
[1:14:32] say amen and brother brandham screams
[1:14:34] out in the messenger token apply it
[1:14:37] church now don't fail will you now Jesus
[1:14:40] and brother Bram says it with emphasis
[1:14:42] don't don't don't let the
[1:14:45] sunset is this your prayer today amen
[1:14:48] don't let the sunet Hallelujah don't
[1:14:51] don't don't don't he says this four
[1:14:53] times rest
[1:14:55] day or night don't take no chance and
[1:14:59] that's why I read at the beginning the
[1:15:00] disciples came to Jesus they didn't want
[1:15:01] to take a chance they say tell us what
[1:15:03] the signs are because we want to be
[1:15:05] ready Hallelujah and butom is pleading
[1:15:07] with random Tabernacle it won't work
[1:15:09] children it won't work you must have the
[1:15:12] token you say I believe yes I go I yeah
[1:15:16] I believe the message that's all right
[1:15:19] that's good but you must have the token
[1:15:22] do you hear Bram Tabernacle and this
[1:15:23] morning I said Do you hear headstone
[1:15:25] Tabernacle Hallelujah you must have the
[1:15:27] token displayed without it all your
[1:15:30] believing is in vain that's right you
[1:15:32] know when I was sharing this week in the
[1:15:34] midweek services but brought it out so
[1:15:36] beautifully that those who follow the
[1:15:39] pillar of fire will be a persecuted
[1:15:41] Bunch
[1:15:45] Hallelujah the squeeze and the Press
[1:15:47] will come and the bride will have power
[1:15:49] to deal with the challenge it'll be a
[1:15:50] short quick message the Rapture will go
[1:15:53] and the but the said the brid A
[1:15:55] persecuted hunted group so I want you to
[1:15:57] see on the road to the Raptor and the
[1:15:59] Resurrection The Bride will almost be
[1:16:00] running power will come the devil will
[1:16:03] be after but the devil doesn't know
[1:16:05] who's in The Bride because brother bham
[1:16:08] taught us well he told us when the
[1:16:09] Dynamics stri when the spirit Falls are
[1:16:11] going to bring up false anointed that's
[1:16:13] right so he say signs and wonders will
[1:16:15] not be the
[1:16:17] evidence of who's in The Bride the only
[1:16:20] evidence of the Bride is the rapture it
[1:16:24] so understand the picture with the
[1:16:25] kangali Believers would be there all
[1:16:27] over the message Hallelujah and the
[1:16:30] devil will just be waiting my God and
[1:16:33] the bride will go and the devil will
[1:16:34] come after the remnant those who were
[1:16:37] there listen to the message and they
[1:16:39] fail to apply the token something else
[1:16:43] was more important when Moses said kill
[1:16:46] a lamb put Blood on the door they had
[1:16:48] something else to do that they thought
[1:16:51] was more
[1:16:52] important Hallelujah and this morning
[1:16:55] the CES the same cry that brother had in
[1:16:57] brother Bram had in 1963 don't fail
[1:17:00] Church apply the token because judgment
[1:17:04] is hanging over the church judgment is
[1:17:07] hanging over the world because the times
[1:17:09] of the Gentiles is about over hallelujah
[1:17:13] amen praise God without it all your
[1:17:15] believing is in vain that's right see
[1:17:18] you live a good life you listen to
[1:17:20] Listen to The Prophet you listen to what
[1:17:23] the word says you go go to church you
[1:17:26] try to live right that's fine but that's
[1:17:28] not it when I see the blood that's the
[1:17:30] token hallah don't come this far and say
[1:17:35] I believe the message you obey the
[1:17:38] messenger come into Christ well I
[1:17:41] believe every word said brother the
[1:17:42] random that's good but that's just being
[1:17:44] able to read that's just being able to
[1:17:47] hear that's just being able to be here
[1:17:49] in this service and not in a Pentecostal
[1:17:51] church or a Baptist Church but that's
[1:17:53] not good enough take the message
[1:17:56] Hallelujah take the message this morning
[1:17:58] take it into your heart that you must
[1:18:01] have the token the very life that was in
[1:18:03] Christ be in you and when I see that
[1:18:05] I'll
[1:18:07] pass over
[1:18:09] you I pray that this morning if you came
[1:18:12] in here with condemnation that you could
[1:18:14] put it under the blood amen and begin to
[1:18:17] cry out for the fire yes cry out for the
[1:18:19] Holy Ghost whatever your past your
[1:18:22] situation what you feel and fell that's
[1:18:24] what the blood is here for to put it
[1:18:26] under there and now the blood is
[1:18:28] covering that take that away now you can
[1:18:30] go and cry out for the Holy Ghost can
[1:18:32] the church say
[1:18:33] Amen so my desire My Prayer Young
[1:18:37] Brother young sister mother father
[1:18:38] neighbor friend visitor is that you come
[1:18:41] through the blood today with a clean
[1:18:45] heartall with a pure heart with a
[1:18:48] consecrated heart and you could now
[1:18:50] approach boldly the Throne of God and
[1:18:52] say Lord I've been in church a long time
[1:18:54] I've been in the message a long time and
[1:18:56] this holy ghost thing that I've keep
[1:18:58] hearing about I need it for myself I
[1:19:01] don't want to sleep without the Holy
[1:19:02] Ghost I don't want to live without the
[1:19:04] Holy Ghost I can't go back home without
[1:19:06] the Holy Ghost but I need the Holy Ghost
[1:19:09] I need amen an
[1:19:12] experience with
[1:19:15] God can the church say Amen in the
[1:19:19] message of token brother brandom said to
[1:19:21] the world it's a bunch of foolishness
[1:19:23] Hallelujah but to God is the only way
[1:19:27] the only thing that he requires is that
[1:19:29] token it must be there and you cannot
[1:19:31] have the token until the fair is paid
[1:19:34] then you are a possessor of the token
[1:19:36] butam said no matter how righteous it
[1:19:38] was but Isaac why you kneeling his down
[1:19:40] but we we know this but are you
[1:19:41] desperate for the token are you
[1:19:44] desperate for change are you desperate
[1:19:46] to get out of here or why you so caught
[1:19:48] up and building your kingdom and Earth
[1:19:50] that you miss the whole purpose that you
[1:19:51] are
[1:19:53] here brother BR said there will be
[1:19:55] people who will be in the message that
[1:19:56] would miss the whole
[1:19:57] thing he said all your believing is in
[1:19:59] vain what's the sense you believe all
[1:20:01] this years and you have no evidence Oh
[1:20:03] Praise Lord but brother Bram said you
[1:20:06] cannot get desperate until God speaks to
[1:20:09] you Hallelujah so I pray that this
[1:20:11] morning God would speak to your heart
[1:20:13] and bring you into desperation that if
[1:20:15] you need to repent and bring something
[1:20:17] under the blood you repent today you
[1:20:20] need to make something right with
[1:20:21] somebody you make it right today you
[1:20:23] need to tell somebody I forgive you
[1:20:25] today if you know you have not been
[1:20:27] living right
[1:20:29] today Hallelujah because the sealing
[1:20:32] Angel is moving through the camp looking
[1:20:34] to put a mark upon all those that sigh
[1:20:37] and cry for the abomination in the city
[1:20:39] you know what that means when you sigh
[1:20:42] and cry for the Abomination it means the
[1:20:44] stuff that's happening in the world
[1:20:46] supposed to disturb you amen supposed to
[1:20:49] negatively affect you understand what I
[1:20:51] mean we have become so insensitive to
[1:20:53] what's going on
[1:20:55] somebody dies okay somebody dies
[1:20:58] something happens it's just another news
[1:21:00] item but put a mark upon those who sigh
[1:21:03] and cry for the
[1:21:05] Abomination because death is not God's
[1:21:07] plan for people to be killing one
[1:21:08] another sickness is not God's plan for
[1:21:10] people to be sick so you are sighing and
[1:21:12] you're crying because sin has taken hold
[1:21:15] of your house you are sighing and crying
[1:21:17] because your prayer life is not an order
[1:21:19] you are sighing and crying because you
[1:21:20] are under spiritual attack you are
[1:21:22] sighing and crying you're not satisfying
[1:21:25] to just be in the message you are
[1:21:26] sighing and crying because you want to
[1:21:28] make things right you are sighing and
[1:21:29] crying because everywhere you look you
[1:21:31] see the enemy at work you are sing and
[1:21:33] crying because you need a Revival you
[1:21:35] are sing and crying because you need
[1:21:37] restoration you are sing and crying
[1:21:39] because you know you're not where it's
[1:21:40] supposed to be you're sing and crying
[1:21:43] because you know your house needs an
[1:21:45] experience with
[1:21:48] [Applause]
[1:21:49] God can the church say
[1:21:52] Amen the blood amen was the token or an
[1:21:57] identification the blood identified that
[1:22:00] the worshipper had slain the lamb
[1:22:02] accepted the lamb and applied a token to
[1:22:06] himself Hallelujah that he was not
[1:22:08] ashamed I want to say that again he was
[1:22:11] not ashamed amen he was not ashamed amen
[1:22:15] amen he was not ashamed to display the
[1:22:18] token he didn't care who saw it this is
[1:22:21] the prophet he didn't care what people
[1:22:23] said in fact this listen to the prophet
[1:22:25] he wanted everybody to see
[1:22:28] it he want everybody to know that the
[1:22:32] token is applied Hallelujah Glory young
[1:22:36] people stop hiding your
[1:22:39] testimony in your schools stop hiding
[1:22:42] your testimony in your jobsall because
[1:22:46] when you hide your testimony the devil
[1:22:47] has a room to get at you but when you
[1:22:49] display the token now you have something
[1:22:51] to
[1:22:52] defend you have a testimony to because
[1:22:54] you don't want to bring a reproach to
[1:22:56] Christ Hallelujah when you say you are a
[1:22:59] Christian that's supposed to mean
[1:23:00] something Hallelujah many people say
[1:23:03] they're a Christian when the life you
[1:23:04] live you know they're not a Christian
[1:23:05] but when you say that you are Christian
[1:23:07] you have to live something speak a
[1:23:10] certain way talk a certain way act a
[1:23:11] certain way live a certain way can the
[1:23:13] church say Amen but the B said
[1:23:16] Christianity has to display its token
[1:23:18] see publicly in public life at the
[1:23:22] office on the street when trouble is
[1:23:25] around anything in church everywhere
[1:23:27] else the blood is the token and the
[1:23:29] token must be applied see or the
[1:23:32] Covenant is not in effect can the church
[1:23:35] say Amen I'm not going to be too much
[1:23:37] longer with you the musicians can get
[1:23:40] ready Hallelujah butam said I told you
[1:23:42] last Sunday I had something I want to
[1:23:45] talk to you about he said this is it we
[1:23:48] love you the time when you just can't
[1:23:50] play with it it's got to be done if it's
[1:23:54] ever going to be done is got to be done
[1:23:57] now amen because we can see that the
[1:23:59] Wrath is about ready to pass through the
[1:24:01] land and everything from under that
[1:24:03] token will perish yes L can the church
[1:24:07] say
[1:24:08] Amen
[1:24:11] Hallelujah the said therefore as the
[1:24:13] evening Shadows are appearing and the
[1:24:15] Wrath is ready to be poured out from on
[1:24:17] high upon the ungodly Nations Hallelujah
[1:24:20] and upon the ungodly unbelievers upon
[1:24:23] the professors without a possession
[1:24:25] those who just talk about it upon these
[1:24:27] things and I've tried to unfold myself
[1:24:31] and live right among it to see where it
[1:24:33] was standing Hallelujah before I said
[1:24:36] these things now we are living in the
[1:24:37] shadows and the Wrath is ready to strike
[1:24:40] and God is requiring a token that you
[1:24:43] yourself have received his token the
[1:24:46] Holy Ghost it's the only way the only
[1:24:49] sign that God will ever pass because it
[1:24:51] is the literal life of Jesus Christ we
[1:24:53] turn back amen into the
[1:24:58] believer can the church say
[1:25:00] Amen brother Brown said in the same
[1:25:03] message the Holy Ghost is our
[1:25:04] identification amen it is what
[1:25:06] identifies us as Christians not our

[1:34:03] churches went through the cities and
[1:34:06] sealed only those who sighed and cried
[1:34:09] for the Abomination that was done in the
[1:34:11] city is that right Ezekiel 9 we know
[1:34:14] that's truth the mark and Angel went
[1:34:16] forth and put a mark on their head
[1:34:18] forehead seal them them that cried and S
[1:34:21] and after that come the slaughtering
[1:34:23] angels from the four corners of the

[1:34:27] it coming Wars moving right that will
[1:34:29] kill the whole earth Hallelujah there's
[1:34:31] nothing that they couldn't touch but
[1:34:33] them that had to Mark I wonder this
