[26:15] appreciate the Lord this morning amen so
[26:19] before you take your seats
[26:20] alight to get to the Scriptures reading
[26:23] two portions of Scripture both in the
[26:26] book of Revelation reading revelation 10
[26:28] and reading from Revelation chapter 22
[26:32] for scripture reading this morning
[26:36] looking for God to do something special
[26:38] for us in this season
[26:46] revelation 10 and reading from verse 1
[26:50] and I saw another mighty angel come down
[26:53] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[26:56] rainbow was upon his head that his face
[26:58] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[27:02] pillars of fire and he had it his hand
[27:04] little book open and he set his right
[27:07] foot upon the sea and his left foot on
[27:09] the earth and cry with a loud voice as
[27:12] when a lion roars and when he had cried
[27:15] seven thunders uttered their voices and
[27:18] when the seven thunders had uttered
[27:19] their voices I was about to write and I
[27:22] heard a voice from heaven saying unto me
[27:24] seal up those things which the seven
[27:27] thunders uttered and write them not and
[27:30] he enjoyed which I saw stand upon the
[27:32] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[27:34] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[27:37] liveth for ever and ever who created
[27:39] heaven and the things that therein are
[27:41] and the earth and the things that
[27:43] therein are and the sea and the things
[27:44] which are therein that there should be
[27:47] time no longer but in the days of the
[27:49] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[27:51] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[27:54] be finished as he had declared to his
[27:56] servants the prophets and reading
[27:58] revelation 22 and reading verse 10 and
[28:04] he said unto me seal not the sayings of
[28:06] the prophecy of this book for the time
[28:09] is at hand he that is unjust let him be
[28:14] unjust still and he which is filthy let
[28:17] him be filthy still and he that is
[28:20] righteous let him be righteous still and
[28:23] he that is holy let him be holy still
[28:26] metre Lord at a blessing to the reading
[28:30] of the word you may be seated this
[28:33] morning
[28:36] so I have a title this morning and I
[28:40] believe I told buddy Hugh on Wednesday
[28:43] night that is about true but over two
[28:46] weeks or so ago that the Lord gave me
[28:49] this thought this message for today and
[28:52] when we're over preached two weeks ago
[28:55] the last message the last Commission the
[28:59] last name I spoke with him and I said I
[29:02] know what I have is to follow the
[29:05] message and then he continued along the
[29:08] same vein last Sunday whereas I was with
[29:11] Moses so shall I be with thee but within
[29:14] that message he has a theme of the last
[29:16] message the last Commission the last
[29:18] name because the Prophet says one of
[29:20] these days a last name would be called
[29:23] dolby shot and it'll be all over
[29:26] similar to noah's d that god shut the
[29:29] door noah had no control over god
[29:32] shutting the door and last wednesday we
[29:35] had an exhortation and pre-meeting and
[29:37] we spoken come thou and thy house into
[29:41] the ark and we see the signs we see the
[29:44] political science II the economic signs
[29:46] we see the signs in disguise I believe
[29:48] later tonight or so there should be a
[29:50] total lunar eclipse call it a Blood Moon
[29:52] and they have different names for it I
[29:54] could take an hour and talk about that
[29:56] but the signs in the skies that's that's
[30:00] we have a we have the sign of the wood
[30:03] and we know that those signs in the
[30:05] skies because we're Branum taught us
[30:06] that there are three Bibles the heavens
[30:08] the pyramids and the written word and we
[30:11] want to feast on the Word of God because
[30:13] that is what prepares us we could spend
[30:15] a lot of time talking about the
[30:16] political situation and yes brother
[30:19] Branham preached on modern events made
[30:21] clear by prophecy but the word that has
[30:23] gone forth for us is not for us to labor
[30:26] on what's happening around us it's for
[30:28] us to labor and what's happening inside
[30:30] of us because we could have all
[30:32] knowledge of what's happening around us
[30:33] what's happening in the political realm
[30:35] what's happening in the ecclesiastical
[30:36] realm and still miss what is most
[30:40] important that is a change on the inside
[30:42] of us and for some reason or the other
[30:45] and it's something I believe I said on
[30:47] Wednesday night that the whole purpose
[30:48] of coming to church is for us to change
[30:50] for us to mature and the maturity that
[30:53] comes with this God saw and has an order
[30:56] for how it's supposed to take place so
[30:58] for you to even manifest the virtue of
[31:00] the age of brotherly kindness you have
[31:02] to be around people who can test you for
[31:05] that virtue to be manifested you can
[31:07] hide on a mountain and be in solitary
[31:10] confinement or self-imposed solitary
[31:12] confinement and get brotherly kindness
[31:14] because there's nobody testing you so
[31:16] God made it in such a way that you have
[31:18] to interact with people good people nice
[31:21] people Christian people wonderful people
[31:23] but they invariably have to rub you the
[31:25] wrong way God designed it that way so
[31:29] that the virtue could be manifested so
[31:30] hiding and having problem with people
[31:33] and when problems arise with people
[31:35] having positions and things to say about
[31:36] it you are actually going around away
[31:39] instead of going through the path that
[31:41] God ordained for you for your own
[31:43] perfection for your own maturity for
[31:45] your own growth and when you look back
[31:48] at your life you must be able to see
[31:50] that you are graduating from stage to
[31:51] stage to seed you must be making
[31:53] progress you cannot stay in standard one
[31:56] for all of your life after standard one
[31:58] should be standard to understand the two
[32:00] so take you all the way up to Common
[32:01] Entrance or what what do they call it
[32:03] now I see eight
[32:04] and then he's was a possum that's
[32:07] teacher another stage when I was a child
[32:10] I speak as a child but when I became a
[32:11] man I put away the childish things
[32:13] there's a time limit to the stages of
[32:15] your life and time is something that we
[32:18] will not have all the time Oh help me so
[32:23] what I encourage you this morning when I
[32:25] push you and prod you unto good works
[32:28] that's what became the church form and
[32:30] people want to bypass the process and
[32:32] the Bible says forsake not the
[32:33] assembling of yourselves together even
[32:36] as they approach him so when we come
[32:37] together it's not by accident it's not
[32:39] by chances not because we want to do
[32:42] something but because we are compelled
[32:43] to do something because God not only has
[32:46] something to say to us here's an
[32:48] experience that we have when we come
[32:50] into an upper room like environment
[32:52] because God wants a dispute his Holy
[32:55] Ghost so different individuals different
[32:57] gifts different gifts and every gift
[33:00] master find its place and every member
[33:02] of the body has something to do and if
[33:04] you don't know what you have to do yet
[33:05] wait until your change comes because
[33:07] when the Holy Spirit comes it comes to
[33:09] activate the mechanics the purpose the
[33:11] call of God upon your life that the
[33:14] devil has brought all these years to
[33:16] thwart the devlins flood all these years
[33:18] to distract you and not that you realize
[33:20] that you have a high calling that you
[33:22] may not understand but is still a high
[33:23] calling that you may not realize but
[33:26] it's still a high calling in Christ
[33:28] Jesus not for your own agenda
[33:31] not based on your own interpretation not
[33:33] based on your own ambition but based on
[33:35] what God wrote about you we are living
[33:38] out what God has written about us we can
[33:41] live nothing else but what God has
[33:43] written about us and what God has
[33:45] written about us must stand up what God
[33:48] has written about us must be
[33:49] accomplished so when the doctor says
[33:51] something contrary to what the doctor to
[33:54] what God wrote about us then that
[33:56] becomes a lie when our school teacher
[33:59] says something to us that's not what God
[34:02] said about us then the teacher is a lie
[34:04] [Applause]
[34:05] [Music]
[34:06] and the church amen hallelujah my you
[34:11] may be seated we send the pulpit to get
[34:14] miss time I'm missing I'm missing my
[34:17] space here but Anthony break free this
[34:33] is where we break free this is this is
[34:36] where we we did this is where we are
[34:38] real sell this is where who we are you
[34:40] know this is this is what we come for
[34:42] this is what we come to do when we come
[34:44] to church we are reminded of our high
[34:46] calling we are reminded that we are a
[34:48] royal priesthood we as a people a royal
[34:52] priesthood each one of us why a
[34:54] priesthood we are of the tribe of
[34:56] Levites we are royal priests doctor
[34:59] enter into the Holies of Holies
[35:01] before Jesus came only the high priest
[35:03] could go in there but when Jesus came
[35:06] the sailors rent from top to bottom
[35:08] giving everyone of us access into the
[35:11] goodness of God giving us access to ask
[35:14] what we will whatever it is what we will
[35:17] and see it come to pass and in my name
[35:23] they will cast out devils in my name is
[35:25] speaking new tones in my name there lay
[35:28] hands on the sick and these signs shall
[35:30] follow them that believe
[35:33] do we have believers here this morning

[38:31] devil can move that's the kind of trust
[38:33] we're gonna have you may be seated
[38:37] hallelujah I don't know what's gonna
[38:39] happen today I haven't even gotten to my
[38:41] title yet brother pop well but the Holy
[38:44] Ghost is in the house the angel of the
[38:46] Lord is already here the ministering
[38:48] angel is already in our camp this
[38:50] morning he's not here for me he's yet to
[38:53] deliver us he's here for all of us you
[38:56] didn't come to hear man this morning you
[38:58] can't take a direct from God may he
[39:00] speak to us this morning to show us how
[39:03] to go to show us how to leave this place
[39:06] you may be seated
[39:07] [Applause]
[39:13] God has done so much for us and it's
[39:16] doing so much for us you are blessed we
[39:20] are blessed this has nothing to do on
[39:22] the street or any other church or group
[39:24] I'm speaking to the sovereign local
[39:25] church God has blessed us that's the
[39:28] truth I can deny it I can be embarrassed
[39:32] about it he has blessed us he has
[39:34] preserved us he has kept us it's His
[39:37] grace has kept us
[39:43] and that's why you have to have a
[39:44] revelation why you're in this church
[39:46] there are many churches I'm not against
[39:47] any Church there are many wonderful
[39:49] children this morning and we identify
[39:51] with any Church and we preach the
[39:53] message of Malachi 4 without
[39:55] interpretation without applying pins
[39:57] without applying colouring and washing
[39:59] it in the full word we identify with the
[40:02] full word because we're the panum said
[40:04] there your name is not written all my
[40:06] neville or leave me l or whatever in
[40:07] there the name is the mystery of who you
[40:09] are it's all of the world identifier
[40:11] that's my identity so we see our names
[40:15] in the world we see our names in the
[40:17] structure we cannot help ourselves our
[40:19] room has been Sheela
[40:21] we have been impregnated with the
[40:23] revealed word of Malachi for in its
[40:25] entirety you cannot take it out we
[40:28] cannot take a man cheat at it
[40:30] somebody helped me preach this morning
[40:34] um you see the young people that's why
[40:37] when you go to a job and you go to
[40:39] different situations you can never be
[40:40] happy in the world because the scene has
[40:44] already been shown and that C can only
[40:46] produce itself so even when you fall and
[40:48] you make mistake that C cannot produce a
[40:51] carnal church that she produces temple
[40:53] church that C cannot introduce one of
[40:55] the Ephesians that C can only produce
[40:57] our Holy Ghost revival so even when
[40:59] you're covered in the mud and the devil
[41:01] thinks you're finished you might Oh
[41:03] shucks done finish that scene that was
[41:06] there before you were born and screaming
[41:09] out out coming out coming out
[41:12] [Applause]
[41:26] maybe see them
[41:27] [Music]
[41:30] I feel good this morning I feel good
[41:33] this morning you supposed to feel good
[41:36] too
[41:36] [Applause]
[41:46] the promise of restoration of this
[41:49] church is not to have it was 10 years
[41:52] ago not how it was 20 years ago not how
[41:55] it was in 19 or the 80s the restoration
[41:58] of this church it's not even to when the
[42:00] Prophet was here the restoration of this
[42:02] church is to the Alpha Church the
[42:06] original Church the original Pentecost
[42:09] the original Church where Peter said
[42:11] these men are not drunk as you suppose
[42:13] since that time every age has been
[42:16] pointed back to that age can the church
[42:18] shame and let me say bring back the old
[42:21] time there you don't even know what I'm
[42:22] talking about
[42:23] because we were not there but when you
[42:25] read the scriptures about what was there
[42:27] that was a different kind of Church god
[42:29] help us get that kind of a church lesson
[42:32] kind of stay in the church where you
[42:34] walk him and your sinners expose you you
[42:37] have to pray before him you don't want
[42:38] to leave your house without brand
[42:41] because you know the Holy Ghost will
[42:43] uncover whatever is in darkness will
[42:45] come to light because the season change
[42:49] can the church say men
[42:53] [Applause]
[42:58] everybody feeling fine
[43:00] Oh mine put on your seatbelts don't
[43:06] don't take a seatbelt off I told the
[43:09] Deacons a couple weeks ago
[43:10] make sure nobody just walking around
[43:12] aimlessly and no doubt poopers down
[43:13] sales and stuff make sure people keep
[43:15] their seatbelts on
[43:15] you don't want to miss the destination
[43:18] you want to miss way why you come to
[43:21] trade this isn't a social gathering you
[43:22] know this is not a club is not a
[43:25] community you know this is an army and
[43:28] every man must take his rock every man
[43:31] must be nurse please every man must be
[43:33] nez perce ition the maturing and the
[43:37] growth for us is the bring us to be well
[43:39] established in opposition can the church
[43:43] say men and something in growth because
[43:46] even my own walk and I'm looking at
[43:47] things and I'm I'm seeing a certain way
[43:49] and that's a challenge because but the
[43:51] Branum said God don't make halfway
[43:53] preachers but a preacher could be
[43:55] halfway God don't make half make
[43:58] Christian but a Christian could be
[44:00] halfway and I realize where a lot of
[44:02] people missed it because God give gifts
[44:05] but gifts our doubt repentance so men
[44:11] for years and the message that rely on
[44:14] just their gift and you can have a
[44:18] mighty ministry on just a gift but
[44:20] there's more than just a gift because
[44:22] Paul wouldn't tell Timothy to study to
[44:25] show yourself approved so even with the
[44:28] gift you have to study to see spend the
[44:31] time to get into the secret things of
[44:34] God and spend time in a secret closet
[44:37] them and you could have a gift you could
[44:38] have knowledge you could study and still
[44:40] miss the anointing because where the
[44:42] balance had got to be annoying thing
[44:44] from him for five years but when you get
[44:46] the gift with the study with the
[44:49] anointing with the grace of God with the
[44:51] seasoned the spiritually put together
[44:53] the word spiritual food in due season
[44:56] then the chains could break off of your
[44:59] life because God is a present and God
[45:01] it's not a conscious of yesterday yes he
[45:04] is that he's not just a corner tomorrow
[45:06] but
[45:07] chains are being broken today demons are
[45:10] shaking in your life and they have to
[45:12] let you go because the world is not just
[45:14] comment that's the port the waters with
[45:16] power and to have a real demonstration
[45:21] in your life and the church amen
[45:25] [Applause]
[45:27] everybody feeling fine and because of
[45:30] this week we have now understood clearer
[45:32] than before that God has an order
[45:35] there's a way that court operates and
[45:38] there's a way we have to operate in this
[45:40] army of the Lord because God doesn't
[45:42] break his order for anybody
[45:46] I'm the church say Amen
[45:48] [Applause]
[45:51] so just talk a little bit today is that
[45:54] fine from a message of blushing prophets
[46:01] and for my title this morning before I
[46:04] get to that my tattle is when time runs
[46:07] out when time runs out
[46:13] when time
[46:16] runs out
[46:19] sometimes we live life as if we have all
[46:22] the time in the world some of us we have
[46:27] an appointment to be at a certain place
[46:30] at a certain time and we act as if we
[46:34] have all the time in the world and
[46:36] that's why we're late
[46:41] when you have an exam to do there's a
[46:45] time given to an exam sometime it's 90
[46:49] minutes two hours it depends on the
[46:51] examination but after a while time
[46:55] begins to run out
[47:04] powerful thought huh
[47:07] time did not always exists because God
[47:10] is eternal so time has a beginning and
[47:15] because it has a beginning but the
[47:17] random taught us anything that has a
[47:19] beginning has to have an ending and we
[47:22] read the scripture that she a mighty
[47:24] angel come down from heaven and later on
[47:28] in verse 6 he said declare that time no
[47:31] longer no more time no more time friends
[47:41] time is coming to an end and when you
[47:47] look through history every single thing
[47:50] you thought he was gonna be Primus
[47:52] forever you know when you hit premier
[47:54] school that was world but that time run
[47:59] out and I said to somebody yesterday I
[48:02] said no matter what comes in your life
[48:04] you cannot ignore the challenges the
[48:07] situation that come you can't ignore
[48:08] them because when you close your eye and
[48:11] wake up in the morning if you don't deal
[48:13] with it it's still there what you do
[48:18] the ostrich is the animal that when it
[48:21] sees a problem you know what the
[48:22] ostriches
[48:25] it digs in a small hole puts his head
[48:30] into the hole and tries to will the
[48:33] problem a week and I don't know how to
[48:38] describe if it has a heart or what but
[48:42] if the ocean has a heart he's praying
[48:45] then when he lifts his head back up the
[48:48] problem will not be there and invariably
[48:51] when you raise the head back up the
[48:54] problem is still there anybody with me
[49:00] this morning so let me get it to my
[49:04] techs and then I'll hit my title later
[49:06] on right so in a blessing profits it
[49:08] ought to be the happiest time in the
[49:10] world for the Christian I heard somebody
[49:13] speaker miss a couple days ago and he
[49:15] said you know the problem is we have too
[49:16] many Christians who cannot inspire
[49:18] anybody because your head scrape any
[49:22] floor you sure look like something on
[49:25] your shoulder and you will wonder what
[49:28] experience you had with God because
[49:30] you're not smiling and and listen
[49:33] swelling is not based on your current
[49:36] situation smiling is based on your
[49:38] relationship with God smiling is peace
[49:44] on your perspective of your situation
[49:46] and we give the story of the person was
[49:49] complaining because he had no shoes and
[49:51] he stopped complaining when he saw the
[49:54] person with no feet his perspective
[49:57] change because he saw things a bit
[49:59] differently but many times our eyes are
[50:02] not fixed on God and our eyes and a
[50:05] pixel are calling so we look around us
[50:08] and we are influenced by these things
[50:10] and we miss the blessings that God has
[50:12] carried us through and because God is
[50:14] not obligated to explain to us all that
[50:17] he's doing for us
[50:20] can I steal it again God is not
[50:22] obligated to tell us all he's doing for
[50:25] us
[50:26] so when you miss the accident on the
[50:28] road and Court is who diverted the
[50:30] captain I'll hit you and you did reading
[50:32] your papers you missed her and you don't
[50:33] know ain't just working overtime and you
[50:35] and you wanna walk sad you wanna walk
[50:39] depressed you may be seated there are
[50:44] many stories I've heard there's one of a
[50:46] young lady she was walking through some
[50:48] area and that area there are some guys
[50:51] who are robbing the people in the area
[50:53] and she walked through and when she got
[50:57] to the other side and so on so people
[50:59] were asking well how come didn't rob you
[51:02] and when they asked the guys who were
[51:04] doing the robbing why all he didn't rob
[51:06] that little girl who was vulnerable
[51:07] is it she was not alone she was walking
[51:11] with she was walking with two other
[51:13] people I saw two big strong fellows
[51:21] walking with her we're not shopping why
[51:24] we will go and mess with her when she
[51:26] have two people with her wieners
[51:28] shopping we looking for easier targets
[51:29] listen you are not a easy target nothing
[51:32] could come your way unless God allows it
[51:35] you are like job unless God give the
[51:38] devil permission he cannot come to your
[51:40] house
[51:48] you may be seated
[51:51] so if the devil has come on your street
[51:54] to come to your house it means that God
[51:57] says it's okay to give him a shot but I
[51:59] know that that's my boy I know that's my
[52:03] daughter I know he was and I know she
[52:06] would have a testimony you can take his
[52:08] job
[52:09] you can take his family but he was still
[52:12] worship me you may be seated
[52:21] [Music]
[52:26] I pray you maybe see that this morning
[52:30] God opens your spiritual eyes when your
[52:37] carnal and it looked me in flesh you see
[52:39] everything in the flesh you see a bank
[52:41] account in the flesh you look at it
[52:44] doctor's report in the flesh listen
[52:46] there are more zeros on your account and
[52:48] you see but I say never believe man they
[52:53] don't believe me there are more zeros on
[52:57] your account and you can see because he
[53:00] promises supply all of your needs a
[53:02] quality his riches in glory forget what
[53:05] the banker telling you you have a bigger
[53:08] bank account you don't need a big set of
[53:10] money to go to the doctor you don't need
[53:13] a big settlement no because you have
[53:15] access to the best doctor you have
[53:18] access to do you know how much money it
[53:20] is to get the best doctor you initiative
[53:22] you much money it is the Heidi best
[53:24] lawyer when a situation come your way
[53:26] and you have enough money on your
[53:28] account because you have a ring of
[53:30] predestination to get the best lawyer
[53:34] somebody help me this morning to get me
[53:36] best doctor when you have a situation
[53:38] with your child is because you in your
[53:41] flesh that you try to get into the mix
[53:44] of it instead of letting God settled his
[53:47] beliefs you may be seated
[53:48] or somebody that's the confidence that
[53:55] will make the men of all said the battle
[53:57] is not it's not mine the battle is the
[53:59] Lord's and you know why he does it for
[54:03] his namesake
[54:04] because his name is important to him and
[54:07] he don't want the enemy to ever think
[54:09] that he can't keep his word he keeps his
[54:11] what about you even when you don't
[54:13] deserve it
[54:14] he keeps his word for his name sake he
[54:18] will bless you for his name sake he will
[54:21] deliver you for his name's sake because
[54:24] he is a deal to it unconditional
[54:27] covenant that's what unconditional me
[54:31] it's not based on your actions it's
[54:33] based on what he said he will keep he
[54:41] may be seated
[54:43] hallelujah you may be seated
[54:48] that's why the headstone will come with
[54:51] sodium's client grace grace grace
[54:53] because Adam proved that when it was a
[54:56] two sided relationship God didn't ban
[54:59] the corded man did man field
[55:06] and God said you know what must be an
[55:08] unconditional relationship
[55:12] his love is unconditional his love
[55:15] doesn't cheap when you make mistakes his
[55:17] love for you is just calling you back to
[55:19] repentance calling you back to Greece
[55:21] calling you back to make things right
[55:23] calling you back to say that I'm sorry
[55:25] he's not gonna allow you now and don't
[55:28] mix up his grace with you doing
[55:30] foolishness his grace is to deal with
[55:38] you when you fall when you couldn't help
[55:40] yourself not when you deliberate you
[55:42] walk in the show business can the church
[55:50] say man you can set some time ago I said
[55:52] listen even the devil game blame for
[55:54] stuff you didn't do you choose to eat
[55:58] hamburger when I hosted a papaya tree
[56:00] mne morning wake up Sunday morning your
[56:03] stomach hurts in the city devil Tiger
[56:04] Beat ever did not tell you up you have
[56:10] to know wisdom you have to know what the
[56:12] devil might try to get you to eat and
[56:14] know they say well I'm not eating that
[56:15] tonight because tomorrow is but the
[56:16] fast some of you do you even know what
[56:18] fasteners
[56:21] because you want to be ready for war you
[56:24] want to be ready for actually I want to
[56:26] be ready because you realize we're in a
[56:29] spiritual world or rest or war it's not
[56:31] carnal it's not it's not flesh and blood
[56:33] so when your wife acha by your husband
[56:35] occupied sure now it's not flesh on
[56:36] blood
[56:36] go and pray come on pray and what's got
[56:41] you in the situation around what go out
[56:43] do something
[56:45] your default response to the prayer you
[56:49] are automatic your default setting
[56:53] should be prayer when you reset to
[56:55] default prayer when you feel upset pray
[57:00] when you feel tired pray when you feel
[57:03] very pretty when you feel sick pray so
[57:13] I'm taking my time this morning go here
[57:17] in the presence of the Lord so I just
[57:19] want to lay a foundation and get to my
[57:21] thoughts and see what God will do today
[57:22] but in my heart the Lord knows my heart
[57:25] I don't want to see anybody leave here
[57:27] today deceive me that he came there must
[57:30] be a change there must be a call to
[57:32] something to move on the inside first
[57:34] accreta revival and revival is not
[57:36] started in the church it's in your homes
[57:41] but you cannot get desperate by the
[57:43] Branson until God speaks to you so may
[57:46] God speak to your heart today
[57:47] so that you could do more to see your
[57:49] family deliver to see your situation
[57:51] change because the word has compelled
[57:53] you not motivation not jumping out
[57:55] shouting but a real introspection let
[57:57] every man examine himself and see am i
[58:01] living up to the expectation as set by
[58:03] the Prophet we have a standard we're not
[58:05] trying to create a standard we already
[58:06] have a standard but abandone brought a
[58:08] standard and God does not change so this
[58:10] standard has not been lowered or dropped
[58:12] it's the same standard the standard of
[58:15] holiness the standard of righteousness
[58:17] it's a standard of purity it's a
[58:20] standard of love it's a standard of
[58:21] living the right way can the church say
[58:26] Amen
[58:26] it ought to be the happiest time in the
[58:29] world for the Christian times are going
[58:30] to change the all's going to become

[59:07] consecrated as dedicated you are yet a
[59:09] demon but you know that you're not

[59:14] supposed to be at but the man said you

[59:27] to the altar with myself I invite every
[59:29] one of you to come here and not only see
[59:31] but to stay here until God has cleansed
[59:34] your soul from everything that's unlike
[59:36] him and I was speaking about over before

[59:40] about the Azusa Street revival how
[59:42] Seymour you surprised almost five hours
[59:45] d if it's for a year or something like
[59:48] that or two years or five hours every
[59:50] day

[1:00:01] about it and people come to service on a
[1:00:04] Sunday and say well once it past hour
[1:00:06] and I have to all be we into overtime no
[1:00:08] we know that in certain five hours a day
[1:00:12] because he was looking for something are
[1:00:15] you looking for something or you want to
[1:00:18] with another crisis come to run to the
[1:00:20] church and see where the elders have
[1:00:22] oscillate hands and pray this is not
[1:00:24] semantics we are looking to leave here I
[1:00:26] am NOT taking chances with my
[1:00:29] destination I kind of for to take
[1:00:31] chances I want to be a hundred percent
[1:00:33] sure that I'm going to make it and the
[1:00:39] church amen
[1:00:40] but to stay here until God has cleanse
[1:00:42] your soul from everything that's unlike
[1:00:44] him until you can go out of here a new
[1:00:46] person not with a corn plaster or not
[1:00:49] covering up the situation but go out a
[1:00:51] with a blood transfusion that purifies
[1:00:54] your blood and gives you new life and a
[1:00:57] new hope anybody looking for a new hope
[1:00:59] a new life and you walk and you talk and
[1:01:03] you perspective a new a fresh anointing
[1:01:08] listen to the Prophet go out with a
[1:01:11] baptism of the holy spirit go out not
[1:01:14] shouting not dancing so much dem tings
[1:01:16] are all right they all belong in the
[1:01:18] church you all belong in the Bible but
[1:01:20] I'm talking about is the Holy Spirit
[1:01:23] God's love that's what we're looking for
[1:01:27] God's love come to church see him him
[1:01:29] but I Brandon in a mighty golden veil
[1:01:31] I'm identify with a group that feels of
[1:01:33] Spirit of God
[1:01:34] I'm identified with a group that knows
[1:01:35] he's unfilled that knows he's a seen
[1:01:38] yesterday today and forever and know
[1:01:40] that this is not fanaticism it's Jesus
[1:01:43] Christ is him yesterday today and
[1:01:44] forever
[1:01:45] I'm identified with that group here
[1:01:47] tonight he had they're called a bunch of
[1:01:49] heretics yet a bunch of fanaticism on
[1:01:52] account of the Word of God but I'm not
[1:01:54] ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:01:56] but it's the power of God unto salvation
[1:02:00] what are we looking for this is our
[1:02:02] promise a church that Jesus don't walk
[1:02:04] in
[1:02:04] a kind of church that God's prophet
[1:02:07] longed to see a church full of power I
[1:02:10] chose that with unite with the head
[1:02:12] stoner
[1:02:12] sous-chef know that Jesus Christ is the
[1:02:14] same yesterday today and forever I
[1:02:17] believe it all my heart and we will have
[1:02:19] that kind of a cheat can the church say
[1:02:21] Amen so for such a time as this
[1:02:26] we have been raised up God overlooked
[1:02:34] Abraham God overlooked even God
[1:02:37] overlooked Joshua God went and searched
[1:02:40] true and he saw you like Johnny said no
[1:02:41] they can't deal with this age their
[1:02:44] mission their purpose their ministry is
[1:02:46] for their time I need to find a
[1:02:48] different group of people who can deal
[1:02:50] with this age of the Internet and this
[1:02:51] interferes book and this age of
[1:02:53] technology and it's and still have a
[1:02:55] testimony and still in this it be able
[1:02:58] to tell the devil no I'm not gonna
[1:03:00] report to you I'm not gonna answer to
[1:03:02] you I don't have to explain myself to
[1:03:05] you
[1:03:06] somebody please back to me and they'll
[1:03:11] be conscious that time is short you
[1:03:17] cannot come to church like you have all
[1:03:18] the time you cannot come to church like
[1:03:22] every time any would but if I said one
[1:03:25] day be the last song song will have the
[1:03:27] last service and I preach the message a
[1:03:29] long time I go to the young people do
[1:03:31] not cross the line and but I'm and I'm
[1:03:32] talked about young people coming to the
[1:03:35] altar when I read this quote it had me
[1:03:39] spinning in fact let me see if I could
[1:03:42] pull it up
[1:03:43] quickly for you
[1:03:49] is that okay
[1:03:59] he was it a message that deity of Jesus
[1:04:01] Christ but the madam said I'm thinking
[1:04:04] of those young people that night down
[1:04:06] there at the altar listen friends at the
[1:04:10] altar trying to be saved but have
[1:04:13] crossed the line no redemption for them
[1:04:16] they were gone could not be saved and
[1:04:19] people come to church acting as if this
[1:04:22] salvation and this mercy and this
[1:04:24] Redemption is an indefinite thing the
[1:04:28] Cabrera brand said this each we are
[1:04:30] blending from time into eternity
[1:04:32] salvation is not required in eternity
[1:04:35] redemptions are required in eternity you
[1:04:37] need to be scenery team to get there so
[1:04:41] when we blend into eternity and as we
[1:04:44] are blending in there'll be a line that
[1:04:46] is drawn as we read the scripture in
[1:04:49] revelation 22 he let his filthy filthy
[1:04:52] still he that is righteous righteous
[1:04:56] still and people on ascended off time to
[1:04:58] come to church when the prophet screamer
[1:05:03] is later than we think it's got me
[1:05:05] scared have I done enough
[1:05:12] are you ready are you ready are you
[1:05:17] ready to give an account are you ready
[1:05:20] to have a testimony are you ready to
[1:05:22] answer for all the years you have sat in
[1:05:24] church under the greatest ministry of
[1:05:27] the Prophet message of Malachi 4 can we
[1:05:31] give an account for what this message
[1:05:34] has done to bring us to Christ the mess
[1:05:37] was not to bring us to the Prophet the
[1:05:39] Prophet was a sign pointing us to Jesus
[1:05:41] Christ and how desperate are we to live
[1:05:49] this before our time runs out because
[1:05:52] make no mistake about it time is running
[1:05:56] out can the church say Amen
[1:06:04] I'll take my time this morning
[1:06:06] I want is to get home
[1:06:13] but Ibrahim said in a message is your
[1:06:15] life will be to reject the day of
[1:06:18] visitation when God is making a visit to
[1:06:20] the church and to the people receive it
[1:06:23] then don't put it off till next year or
[1:06:26] the next revival that's the hour today
[1:06:28] is the day of salvation when time runs
[1:06:35] out time is running out on the economy
[1:06:41] but the Branham for toll of economic
[1:06:44] collapse economic ruin and we have had
[1:06:48] different points from history and the
[1:06:50] Great Depression and different things
[1:06:51] but this whole economic system has to
[1:06:54] crumble because it's not God's order
[1:06:57] politics has to crumble and as great as
[1:07:01] every Empire thought they would they had
[1:07:03] an end the Greeks came to the end didn't
[1:07:06] realize that time was gonna run out on
[1:07:08] them they thought it would have been
[1:07:10] ruling forever Egypt in Pharaohs they
[1:07:13] went Moses was there Pharaoh control the
[1:07:16] entire world they talked about going to
[1:07:18] be forever but time was running out when
[1:07:22] Moses came down to Egypt he came because
[1:07:24] time was running out he came to enforce
[1:07:27] the fact that time was running on Moses
[1:07:29] was the instrument Moses was what was
[1:07:32] ticking the time down or God help me
[1:07:34] this morning
[1:07:35] so when Moses hit Egypt the clock was
[1:07:39] just Pharaoh didn't know that every day
[1:07:42] Moses was in Egypt he had one day less
[1:07:44] but that time Moses was walking through
[1:07:47] Egypt to say let my people go
[1:07:51] Moses didn't come just to bring plagues
[1:07:54] and yesterday liberation of Israel it
[1:07:57] was to put an end to the king of Egypt
[1:07:59] Egypt never recovered when Moses walked
[1:08:02] out Moses ministry declared the end of
[1:08:07] Egypt and our ministry will declare the
[1:08:10] end of this world the fact that we are
[1:08:13] here this war has taken
[1:08:15] taken there's a cow known because of us
[1:08:18] this accountant who had to wait until a
[1:08:22] ministry like unto Moses like hunter
[1:08:24] Elijah a people he can wrap all of his
[1:08:27] word in in this age or somebody preached
[1:08:32] back to me Moses put the end of a
[1:08:38] political economic system but this right
[1:08:42] this elect lady will put an end not just
[1:08:46] to the political system not just to the
[1:08:48] economic system but the whole spiritual
[1:08:51] system is run by the core of this evil
[1:08:54] each Moses couldn't do it Elijah
[1:08:58] couldn't do it Jesus didn't want to do
[1:09:01] it because he knew there was a people
[1:09:03] that would come after him who were who
[1:09:06] would be equipped to put an end you may

[1:15:37] of activity because eternity wants to
[1:15:40] step in his rightful place hallelujah
[1:15:43] hallelujah in the beginning in the midst
[1:15:47] of the chaos in the midst of the
[1:15:49] darkness God said let there be light and
[1:15:51] there was light and time started to tick
[1:15:54] because God had a plan to reveal certain
[1:15:57] things from himself he longed to share
[1:16:00] certain things and when he tried with
[1:16:02] the Angels they couldn't appreciate it
[1:16:04] because they couldn't sing amazing grace
[1:16:06] he always had in his heart we hear the
[1:16:09] song amazing grace but that song but not
[1:16:12] Vince all on it that song could not have
[1:16:18] been seen in eternity at that time if we
[1:16:23] could place a sliver of time in eternity
[1:16:25] at that time but eternally
[1:16:27] nobody could've sing amazing grace but
[1:16:30] this time when time blends into eternity
[1:16:33] and we take our position we can walk
[1:16:36] with Jesus and we can walk with Moses
[1:16:39] and we can shake amazing grace up any
[1:16:41] time because we know what it is
[1:16:44] [Applause]
[1:16:51] you may be seated no one the Bible will
[1:16:57] see they'll sing a new song a new song
[1:17:01] the Angels could only sing a certain
[1:17:03] kind of song but this routine group of
[1:17:06] people who tasted time and returned back
[1:17:09] to God they will sing a new song they
[1:17:12] will sing of the goodness of Jesus they
[1:17:14] were singer of who hours long but I was
[1:17:17] now all I've never seen the righteous
[1:17:19] forsaken they could think back to that
[1:17:22] time you may be seated
[1:17:32] [Applause]
[1:17:36] [Music]
[1:17:36] [Applause]
[1:17:41] everybody with me everybody feelin fine
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:17:45] [Applause]
[1:17:50] you'll be up energy for another five
[1:17:52] hours
[1:17:53] [Applause]
[1:18:01] let me give you an illustration in a
[1:18:04] marathon a marathon runner I'm not
[1:18:09] speaking here by experience
[1:18:12] speaking my study has to practice and
[1:18:18] train together in certain rhythm set
[1:18:22] momentum
[1:18:22] and typically what happens is this
[1:18:25] marathon runner gets into a rhythm in
[1:18:28] the race
[1:18:29] some say the average about ten or so
[1:18:31] come to the mass power and they get into
[1:18:33] this rhythm because it's a long distance
[1:18:36] someone's 20 miles or whatever it is you
[1:18:39] can be speeded up in the middle of this
[1:18:42] long distance but but no matter how long
[1:18:47] you've been running in a marathon when
[1:18:50] you see the finish line come into view
[1:18:58] something happens from somewhere deep
[1:19:02] within no matter how long you were
[1:19:05] running and not matter the rhythm of the
[1:19:07] piece all of a sudden the sight of the
[1:19:10] finish line allows you to train another
[1:19:14] gear that you didn't want to use before
[1:19:16] because if we use that gear too soon you
[1:19:20] will run out the energy before you reach
[1:19:22] the finish line so a good marathon
[1:19:24] runner knows to conserve that topo to
[1:19:29] hold back that until the finish line is
[1:19:35] in view and when you need it because he
[1:19:39] said a third pole will be there when you
[1:19:41] need it when the finish line is there
[1:19:43] then the oh god help me
[1:19:46] there's a pose of the line where you
[1:19:48] don't worry about who's next to you you
[1:19:50] don't worry about who's at the side of
[1:19:52] you
[1:19:53] you don't worry about how long the
[1:19:54] journey was you don't think back to
[1:19:57] where you even started you just want to
[1:19:59] make it over

[1:20:20] an acceleration of ripening salvation of
[1:20:23] speeded can we type it in the message
[1:20:27] and when you push over there something
[1:20:29] you don't even know who else was around

[1:20:45] up you'll be surprised at who has made
[1:20:47] it you'd be surprised
[1:20:50] who has a turtle brought over the finish

[1:33:31] examples just how the Prophet would do
[1:33:33] it just take a few examples God was so
[1:33:38] sick of the sin in Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:33:42] that he hit the clock himself poop
[1:33:45] inside a cone known to destroy that
[1:33:49] abomination that was Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:33:51] God is no respecter of person so the sin
[1:33:54] the stench of it disturbed him he
[1:33:58] couldn't leave it the way it was he had
[1:33:59] to do something about it the same way
[1:34:01] like in the days of Noah God repented he
[1:34:04] made man because they're very thinking
[1:34:07] he said was evil continually
[1:34:09] except for this man called Noah who
[1:34:11] found favor grace in the eyes of God so
[1:34:15] God came down and hit the stop watch on
[1:34:18] Signum they didn't know that they were
[1:34:20] going to come to an end but judgment was
[1:34:23] already on the earth judgment was
[1:34:26] already walked into them and they didn't
[1:34:27] know it I think of people sometimes who
[1:34:31] leave their homes and they never make it
[1:34:34] back home they did not know that day was
[1:34:37] their deed he left that do you think it

[1:34:47] normal living going about their business
[1:34:50] as it was in the taste of Noah's it

[1:42:17] run out for that spirit upon him and

[1:42:40] said he got in his right mind he was so
[1:42:43] convinced that he wanted to follow Jesus
[1:42:44] you said no don't follow me go testify
[1:42:46] go tell somebody what happened to you
[1:42:50] because they will believe your report
[1:42:52] because they knew how messed up you were
[1:42:54] but your time of deliverance has come
[1:42:56] and through your life god knows what
[1:42:59] will unveil because he knew it has to be
[1:43:01] good to take you out of that situation
[1:43:03] go preach the gospel or tell somebody
[1:43:06] time
[1:43:15] I'm not gonna be too much longer this
[1:43:17] morning but Abraham said now remember
[1:43:20] one word from him will mean more than I
[1:43:23] could speak in a hundred lives and I
[1:43:26] pray this morning one word from God will
[1:43:28] touch your heart and a real permanent
[1:43:30] weight and you could see that there's no
[1:43:32] more time to play Church there's no more
[1:43:35] time to play games is only time for you
[1:43:38] to get the Holy Ghost there's only time
[1:43:40] for you to repent there's only time for
[1:43:42] to make things right there's only time
[1:43:43] to to come to the altar to see a Lord I
[1:43:46] don't want to go home the seamer that I
[1:43:47] came in the message expectation believe
[1:43:50] I said friend without the baptism of the
[1:43:52] Holy Spirit I'm afraid we haven't got
[1:43:54] very much time left
[1:43:55] I'm afraid of always near won't you come
[1:43:57] now and be save and receive the baptism
[1:43:59] of the Holy Ghost won't you do it right
[1:44:01] now this afternoon while we have plenty
[1:44:04] of time can the church say
[1:44:09] in the message the future home of the
[1:44:13] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:44:15] bride but the Branham said now in
[1:44:18] Ephesians 1:10 and it's just a later
[1:44:20] context in there it's called now if
[1:44:22] you're putting it down Ephesians 1:10 is
[1:44:24] call not a dispensation not the 7-day
[1:44:26] it's called the fullness of time when
[1:44:29] the fullness of time has come that's
[1:44:31] when time has been fulfilled so time
[1:44:34] itself is on a mission time itself has a
[1:44:37] limit time cannot go beyond what has
[1:44:40] been allocated for it because God
[1:44:42] already knows the exact point that time
[1:44:45] will blend into eternity in fact the
[1:44:47] Bible says here to cut to work short
[1:44:49] let's not be saved so he is watching
[1:44:51] time very closely to make sure that some
[1:44:56] individuals make it and he's prepared to
[1:45:00] cut the work short to ensure that you
[1:45:02] get the Holy Ghost that's the definition
[1:45:04] for the pride of making it now holy goes
[1:45:07] all the way to adoption time the church
[1:45:10] savor the Pentecost ribbon of messages
[1:45:12] we have an expectation God has laid for
[1:45:15] us and when the fullness of time has
[1:45:19] come
[1:45:19] and that's when time has been fulfilled
[1:45:21] when there's normal time then you go
[1:45:24] into eternity after the seven church it
[1:45:27] is over and it is but a plan I'm already
[1:45:29] taught what it is
[1:45:31] finish the blending has already started
[1:45:34] that's why when God drops the anointing
[1:45:36] in here eternity dropping down to give
[1:45:39] you a taste of what you will experience
[1:45:41] that's why every day that come in by the
[1:45:43] Bremen said as we near the head storm it
[1:45:46] should be a super Church a super Ray's
[1:45:48] as we near the head storm because we are
[1:45:50] planning into eternity where does that
[1:45:52] put your career what does it put your
[1:45:55] job where does that put your fussing on
[1:45:57] you're stewing and your arguments and
[1:45:59] your deep beats when he turned into you
[1:46:01] suppose that Hannah time is finished
[1:46:05] can the church seem and looters it is
[1:46:11] over as a prophet Methodist ages over
[1:46:13] Pentecostal ages over and now you go
[1:46:16] into what eternity no more sevens no
[1:46:20] more threes no more other very eternity
[1:46:22] where there is no such time as numbers
[1:46:25] and things and times you see it now tell
[1:46:29] the church say Amen everybody with me
[1:46:34] now after time has been fulfilled listen
[1:46:37] carefully all sin is gone
[1:46:39] so as time runs out it means sin also
[1:46:43] runs out somebody preach back to me when
[1:46:48] time runs out sin is finished all sin is
[1:46:54] gone taken away at the Millennium at the
[1:46:57] great white throne judgment a type by
[1:47:00] Holy Ghost by the Holy Ghost
[1:47:02] after the world is on fire and baptize
[1:47:05] its baptism of holy fire from heaven all
[1:47:08] sinners gone listen to the prophet or
[1:47:10] germs is gone all devils is gone all
[1:47:14] temptations is gone all evil is gone
[1:47:18] then what does God do he can sit upon
[1:47:21] the earth see because all sin is gone
[1:47:23] so only when all sin is gone could God
[1:47:27] sit upon the earth everybody with me
[1:47:29] this morning
[1:47:34] we're not eating cereal this morning we
[1:47:38] chopped in some meteor this morning we
[1:47:42] cut in some meat and some steak here
[1:47:44] this morning because we know what we are
[1:47:46] called to do we understand where we're
[1:47:48] going with understanding our
[1:47:49] expectations so that's the same now so
[1:47:52] better been finished explaining what's
[1:47:54] happening with now God wants to have
[1:47:56] preeminence he wants a sit on the earth
[1:47:58] but he can't sit because the earth is
[1:48:00] not holy he is a holy God yes it's a
[1:48:04] holy throne he was suspended with the
[1:48:05] holy people so something has happened to
[1:48:08] transform it against the holy it that
[1:48:11] His Majesty his glory can sit
[1:48:13] comfortably so before he can sit sin
[1:48:16] must be finished
[1:48:17] sickness must be finished germs must be
[1:48:20] finished disease must be finished lying
[1:48:22] but we finished Holly his son must be
[1:48:25] finished
[1:48:25] adultery must be finished political
[1:48:28] systems finish economic systems finish
[1:48:31] only one economic system that's his
[1:48:34] system run by the currency of fate
[1:48:36] somebody help me this mornin no more

[1:48:56] are getting back to that somebody in war
[1:48:59] a shout of praise
[1:49:00] [Applause]
[1:49:01] [Music]
[1:49:02] [Applause]
[1:49:05] dear you are solely assumptions you are
[1:49:09] sons who are soldiers angels are also

[1:49:43] million this is our jurisdiction
[1:49:45] [Applause]
[1:49:47] hallelujah
[1:49:49] you may be seated that's why the
[1:49:54] spiritual realm they recognize who you
[1:49:56] they don't understand who we are but
[1:49:59] once you get into position they know you
[1:50:01] they know you so when the sons of sceva
[1:50:04] trying to do change they say who Paul I

[1:50:27] on the earth in the spiritual realm the
[1:50:29] spiritual things of God and that's what
[1:50:32] we are striving for
[1:50:34] because builders were placed in their
[1:50:36] season and time and we are striving to
[1:50:38] be placed in our season before a
[1:50:40] terrible plague strike because when they
[1:50:42] strike it will take sons of God to
[1:50:45] instruct those Devils get out of that

[1:51:04] father
[1:51:05] you may be seated what's the context

[1:51:35] knit it feels like oh is it a tea
[1:51:37] instead it feels good enough because of
[1:51:39] eternity restore my tiredness because
[1:51:41] someone is too much in time you feeling
[1:51:43] tired but come on a tyrant is eternity
[1:51:46] where time is no more joy unspeakable no
[1:51:49] more crying no more pills no more
[1:51:52] mortgage no more traffic to move by a
[1:51:54] thought where you need to be a thinker
[1:51:59] than your there because taxi that's how
[1:52:02] eternity is like listen you ever seen it
[1:52:05] with a brand-new wife said to him when
[1:52:07] you got think until you say you preach
[1:52:08] about it but you don't even know what it
[1:52:10] is so even the Prophet with all of his
[1:52:13] revelation didn't even catch some
[1:52:15] magnitude of what eternity is like oh
[1:52:18] god help us your prints are powders we
[1:52:21] have no idea how good it is and we are
[1:52:24] blending from time into eternity
[1:52:26] [Music]
[1:52:27] [Applause]
[1:52:32] you may be seated
[1:52:35] [Music]
[1:52:37] when Jesus was here he was in a physical
[1:52:41] body living in time but it was eternity
[1:52:45] trapped in time because God is eternal
[1:52:52] he was using a body but it was eternity
[1:52:54] God him shall shaft in a time body but
[1:52:58] it was eternity nonetheless somebody
[1:52:59] help me this morning and God once again
[1:53:02] it's about to step into individuals who
[1:53:05] will be eternity trapped in time because
[1:53:11] that's how the rapture can take place
[1:53:12] because one eternity could be in the
[1:53:14] rapture or claw help us that's why it'll
[1:53:16] be on the inside coming out eternity has
[1:53:21] to be in you
[1:53:23] [Applause]
[1:53:23] [Music]
[1:53:26] [Applause]
[1:53:27] and the church team and the Ministry of
[1:53:30] the fivefold ministry will be taking
[1:53:32] part eternal life that's the greatest
[1:53:35] gift that even ever get because eternal
[1:53:38] life means you are truly connected to
[1:53:40] who you were in the thoughts of God
[1:53:43] never had a beginning
[1:53:45] never has been evening you are creature
[1:53:48] from eternity
[1:53:49] just like Jesus you committed time to
[1:53:52] prove to the devil that there could be
[1:53:54] more like him come unto the earth and
[1:53:57] take the test of time the test of time
[1:54:00] because time itself is a test you may be
[1:54:04] seated
[1:54:05] Oh hallelujah this helps somebody to
[1:54:10] break free now you can understand why
[1:54:14] true worship comes not from the things
[1:54:17] of this temporal claim but it comes from
[1:54:20] your eternal destiny an eternal calling
[1:54:24] an eternal position and no wonder pork
[1:54:27] has hit death where is your sting grave
[1:54:29] where is your victory because it opened
[1:54:32] up to him that even though he was born
[1:54:34] in that time he was really come from
[1:54:36] eternity and that awareness made him
[1:54:41] realize that if I drop this physical
[1:54:44] body that's not the end of me if I drop
[1:54:47] this physical body that's not who I am
[1:54:49] I'm inside his house God chose this
[1:54:53] house as a temporary holding place as a
[1:54:56] temporary house
[1:55:00] [Applause]
[1:55:03] you may be seated
[1:55:06] but with sin and time came the senses of
[1:55:10] the mind imagination in reasoning
[1:55:13] conscience affection these emotions and
[1:55:16] The Devil's playground was allow in your
[1:55:18] mind to try to distract you with the
[1:55:20] education and the politics and the news
[1:55:22] and the dissonant that and every time
[1:55:24] you come to church it's a reminder of
[1:55:26] your eternal call your eternal
[1:55:29] destination and the fact that you are
[1:55:32] here to restore the balance as it were
[1:55:34] because Satan in heaven The Herald but
[1:55:38] we were represented there and we kicked
[1:55:40] him out there and because we were
[1:55:42] represented they were hooking them on
[1:55:43] their core dispatch us here to finish
[1:55:46] the work that was kicked out in heaven
[1:55:47] he take the same agents that were
[1:55:50] represented by angelic beings in heaven
[1:55:52] Oh somebody help me responded who had
[1:55:54] experience fightin with Michael their
[1:55:59] belt experienced fightin with Michael to
[1:56:02] take the dragon out you may be seasoned
[1:56:05] [Applause]
[1:56:11] you may be seated
[1:56:13] but because the devil fell from that
[1:56:16] existence he cannot recall the agents
[1:56:19] who fought with Michael he cannot
[1:56:23] identify them and he has been on the
[1:56:25] lookout ever since because he
[1:56:28] understands the realm of this world and
[1:56:29] he understand the realm of the natural
[1:56:31] so when Jesus was here if thou be the
[1:56:33] Son of God a commission of inquiry
[1:56:35] started to find out if this was one of
[1:56:38] them who had kicked him out in heaven
[1:56:40] and Jesus never gave him the privilege
[1:56:44] Jesus yes was that obligated to answer
[1:56:47] he just took Scripture and responded
[1:56:52] with Scripture because our Authority we
[1:56:55] don't answer to Devils we command Devils
[1:56:59] we don't order devil an answer
[1:57:02] we command him you may be seated
[1:57:13] you may be seated
[1:57:17] [Applause]
[1:57:21] [Music]
[1:57:25] you'd be seated this plan was so
[1:57:29] articulate this plan verse what defined
[1:57:32] that you know when the US Army that was
[1:57:35] a step into an area the center
[1:57:37] reconnaissance team an investigative
[1:57:40] team the land usually is the Marines
[1:57:44] would go first to mix one set up because
[1:57:47] the ships have to come this guy just
[1:57:49] pull up on the shore
[1:57:50] yes so they got to secure the area so
[1:57:53] jesus said the Spirit of the Lord is
[1:57:54] upon me for he has anointed me to preach
[1:57:57] the gospel to open the eyes of the
[1:57:59] brighter comforter that morning and he
[1:58:01] stopped just before the acceptable year
[1:58:05] of the Lord because he was the first
[1:58:07] part of the mission the acceptable year
[1:58:10] of the Lord
[1:58:10] was the Royal Army the whole pride the
[1:58:14] people who were called by his name that
[1:58:17] he would multiply himself in when they
[1:58:20] arrived it will not the ending of time
[1:58:23] [Applause]
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:28] [Applause]
[1:58:31] [Music]
[1:58:32] [Applause]
[1:58:37] you may be seated
[1:58:39] I love this being said this morning
[1:58:41] gonna have to listen to the tape again
[1:58:42] and rejoice because I'm identifying by
[1:58:45] Scripture and by the prophets message
[1:58:47] who you are and why you kind of live in
[1:58:49] a can around you kind of live in the
[1:58:51] realm of sin and openness and gossip and
[1:58:54] backbiting you are more than that you're
[1:58:56] bigger than that
[1:58:57] you know cause for that kind of nonsense
[1:58:58] you are sons you are tortoise you are
[1:59:01] kings you are priests you
[1:59:03] [Applause]
[1:59:06] [Music]
[1:59:10] you may be seated we preach this before
[1:59:16] my oh we really need to attain our
[1:59:22] demons have no power unless they get
[1:59:26] people to work through angels have no
[1:59:33] power unless I get people to operate
[1:59:35] through that's why the Holy Ghost is
[1:59:37] looking for vessels just as the devil is
[1:59:40] looking for vessels there's a
[1:59:41] dimensional distinction that exists
[1:59:44] between the realm of heaven earth and
[1:59:45] underneath and we preach about an Easter
[1:59:48] last year I believe said God Almighty
[1:59:50] God wanted to intervene in the affairs
[1:59:53] of Man so he sent representatives
[1:59:56] that's what Abraham was just what was
[1:59:58] who's because the effect the affairs of
[2:00:00] men it has to be a kinsman it must be a
[2:00:03] man to affect the affairs of men because
[2:00:05] man was given Dominion jurisdiction
[2:00:08] power authority control over the earth
[2:00:11] the angels - that have that God Himself
[2:00:15] controls the heaven and everything
[2:00:17] Sharon but he gives man this earth you
[2:00:23] may be seated
[2:00:24] sort of affected affairs of man when God
[2:00:27] was comfortable with the Ministry of
[2:00:29] every prophet of every judge of every
[2:00:32] leader he said this in another manner
[2:00:34] but this man will not be like those men
[2:00:36] this man will not be like Joshua this
[2:00:38] man will not be like David this man will
[2:00:40] not make a mistake this man will not sin
[2:00:43] this man will not be born through sin is
[2:00:45] gonna be born through sex this man has
[2:00:47] to be a brother to my children he must
[2:00:50] be a father to my children he must be a
[2:00:52] king to my people you may be seated and
[2:00:59] to intervene in the affairs of Man God
[2:01:03] had to end morphe himself change himself
[2:01:06] transform himself in the realms of
[2:01:09] heaven you walked into the secret
[2:01:11] chamber and when he changed himself he
[2:01:14] found himself in the womb of Mary
[2:01:17] to go to the process because Adam had
[2:01:21] bypass the process but this brother to
[2:01:24] us this kinsman to us could not bypass
[2:01:27] the process you may be seated
[2:01:32] anybody sleeping everybody with me this
[2:01:35] morning you've ever seen it uh it's one
[2:01:38] the devil didn't know he was there I did
[2:01:41] too
[2:01:41] the devil didn't know he was there and
[2:01:43] it's 10 the devil didn't know he was
[2:01:45] there so secretive was this mission so
[2:01:51] perfect was this plan
[2:01:52] so ordain was this operation that when
[2:01:56] Jesus finally stepped out it was so
[2:02:04] subtle you may be seated that John the
[2:02:06] Baptist whose primary purpose was to
[2:02:09] identify this Messiah had to ask himself
[2:02:12] are you the one or should we look for
[2:02:15] another so secretive was this
[2:02:22] intervention that Jesus still didn't
[2:02:25] answer him he said tell John that the
[2:02:29] sicker healed tell John that the blind
[2:02:33] eyes are open tell John he will know
[2:02:35] what I mean that the limo walking tell
[2:02:38] John that the Thomas speaking John will
[2:02:41] know what that means he will know that a
[2:02:43] greater than Solomon is here he will
[2:02:46] know that Messiah is on the earth even
[2:02:48] though that the one who will baptize
[2:02:50] with fire just calm down
[2:02:52] [Applause]
[2:02:53] [Music]
[2:02:55] [Applause]
[2:03:05] you may be seated and all the while this
[2:03:10] is going on from since Genesis to this
[2:03:12] time the devil is thinking he has one he
[2:03:16] has the upper hand but God's great clock
[2:03:18] is counting down God's great clock is
[2:03:22] just ticking it's just ticking it's just
[2:03:25] ticking just take him and even when
[2:03:28] Jesus was here we preached this before
[2:03:30] he had yet another mystery another
[2:03:33] ministry because Adam was not supposed
[2:03:35] to die Adam was not supposed to get sick
[2:03:38] Adam as a creature of eternity place
[2:03:41] here on this earth was never sick never
[2:03:42] weak never tired never depressed God
[2:03:49] himself had to fix that situation but he
[2:03:53] couldn't go in a form he was in heaven
[2:03:54] he couldn't go as Jesus the only entry
[2:03:59] into the lower realms was true death
[2:04:03] [Music]
[2:04:06] so in Jesus in Matthew 16 when he was
[2:04:10] having this great conversation it was
[2:04:12] the first time he was revealing with
[2:04:14] clarity with distinction without
[2:04:17] hesitation with a loofa interpretation
[2:04:20] who he was he started with a question
[2:04:22] who do men say I am because he wants to
[2:04:25] reveal something to them but he wants to
[2:04:27] settle their questions you want to make
[2:04:29] sure he knew where they were he said
[2:04:31] what do men say I am and his brothers
[2:04:33] pull out their notepads some cui lies
[2:04:36] because we know your noisette son see
[2:04:38] you are like Jeremiah some and The
[2:04:40] Herald of good things to say you may be
[2:04:42] seated and then Jesus checked him he
[2:04:47] said I'm a Mac your papers no it's easy
[2:04:49] to give somebody else testimony but who
[2:04:51] do you say you've been with me all along
[2:04:53] you've been in the message all along
[2:04:55] you've been here and you've been seeing
[2:04:57] you've been tasting you been
[2:04:58] experiencing but who do you say I am and
[2:05:01] those brothers couldn't move and then
[2:05:04] Peter see throw out the Christ the Son
[2:05:07] of the Living God and Jesus still to him
[2:05:09] and say you didn't figure that out young
[2:05:11] man you didn't figure that out son blood
[2:05:14] nobody told it is but my father in
[2:05:16] heaven give you a revelation and upon
[2:05:19] that rock of Revelation that's what I
[2:05:22] build my church on I call you by
[2:05:25] revelation I call your name by
[2:05:27] revelation you may be seasoned
[2:05:35] could you take someone
[2:05:39] everybody feeling fine
[2:05:42] the Deacons have things under control
[2:05:44] along says anybody sleeping it's a
[2:05:46] simple let me know
[2:05:53] somebody's getting delivered today you
[2:05:55] know I don't doubt it one minute doubt
[2:05:58] it for one second
[2:05:59] today's a day your time has come that
[2:06:02] time for the Devon hauling you has run
[2:06:04] out we are declaring time has run out
[2:06:07] time has run out
[2:06:09] this is revival time manifestation time
[2:06:12] right time seed time adoption time you
[2:06:18] may be seated
[2:06:20] [Applause]
[2:06:23] [Music]
[2:06:26] and when Jesus died the last part of his
[2:06:30] mission because time is running out
[2:06:36] Jesus transformed himself to be able to
[2:06:39] enter into Satan's headquarters all the
[2:06:45] Devils who were sent up to investigate
[2:06:47] who this Jesus was have returned back to
[2:06:48] base
[2:06:50] because the problem seemingly had been
[2:06:53] eliminated Jesus was dead but a band
[2:06:57] said the bride the messing with her like
[2:06:59] it's washed up the mess it will look
[2:07:01] like it's finished the mess will look
[2:07:03] all messed up brother Adam said that and
[2:07:05] it's within that time God is really
[2:07:08] performing a work that was hidden under
[2:07:10] the Seventh Seal because it say I will
[2:07:13] cannot know what it is but the Branham
[2:07:15] taught us well you may be said the devil
[2:07:17] couldn't push did anything but he see
[2:07:19] the Seventh Seal he doesn't even know
[2:07:21] what it is
[2:07:21] he cannot figure it out this is beyond
[2:07:24] his education level is intellectual
[2:07:27] gymnastics he does not know what's under
[2:07:29] there the seven scene himself I drop
[2:07:33] down and knock on the door
[2:07:38] and when he entered there with a pop
[2:07:39] well those brothers you see what that
[2:07:42] looks like the wheel in the middle of
[2:07:44] the wheel that's what a prophet said
[2:07:45] that looked like the rock we need to
[2:07:47] rock that will look like the Greek
[2:07:50] Shepherd that looks like who kept Mina
[2:07:53] and the devil took and Jesus rather took
[2:07:58] the keys of death and hell you know what
[2:08:01] it is you may be seated to be in charge
[2:08:03] of a jail and it all the keys you ready
[2:08:13] have to have a second self of self wood
[2:08:15] to wake up every morning and go to work
[2:08:18] the minor prison and you ready keys you
[2:08:24] walk around town as you say scare people
[2:08:25] to keep them there you can keep them
[2:08:28] there at any point in time you could
[2:08:31] somebody could kick it open and you have
[2:08:34] no power to stop them you have no power
[2:08:36] and you know anything is when one person
[2:08:40] go free and the other people recognize
[2:08:42] her with now hold on
[2:08:48] [Applause]
[2:08:50] he out where we live and when I next one
[2:08:55] come out you see with them brothers and
[2:08:58] sisters
[2:08:59] you can come out to them you can come at
[2:09:02] their prisoner you can walk out of it
[2:09:04] today no today today today today house
[2:09:07] of hell give way to the name of Jesus
[2:09:10] that's why the prophets that you can go
[2:09:12] free if you want to go free and who the
[2:09:15] Son of man set free is what is one get
[2:09:20] another soda praise somebody give God a
[2:09:29] shout of praise I'm almost finished
[2:09:31] musicians get ready we are carry to
[2:09:34] leave this place
[2:09:35] I'm still excited I've here we are
[2:09:37] planning some time and eternity
[2:09:40] I believe that catching a revelation of
[2:09:42] who we are where we come from where we
[2:09:45] are going
[2:09:46] [Applause]
[2:09:51] [Music]
[2:09:56] hallelujah my give me that old-time
[2:09:59] religion give me that old-time religion
[2:10:03] give me that all-time preaching
[2:10:06] hallelujah you may be seasoned hito was
[2:10:11] so anointed but because listen time was
[2:10:16] not yet fulfilled he couldn't go to the
[2:10:18] rapture that's the power of time because
[2:10:25] to everything there's a timed every
[2:10:27] purposes a time is a season every time
[2:10:29] so nothing happened before it's time we
[2:10:32] preached before the people in the days
[2:10:36] of Wesley was so sanctified that the
[2:10:42] Holy Ghost wanted to pour out upon them
[2:10:44] because the sanctified life attracts the
[2:10:48] Holy Ghost
[2:10:50] so the Deacons were the Reimann and that
[2:10:52] they had a bucket of water right next to
[2:10:55] them and they were on the lookout so now
[2:10:57] whenever somebody got so anointed
[2:11:00] because of our chat in the Holy Ghost
[2:11:02] their mission was a true water on them
[2:11:04] to calm them down because the season was
[2:11:08] not yet it will be a years afterwards in
[2:11:11] God's clock ticking down that when
[2:11:13] Seymour would come and see the season
[2:11:15] has arrived
[2:11:16] I believe the seasons arrive and then
[2:11:19] the Holy Ghost poured out in the losers
[2:11:21] revival because a season unchanged
[2:11:24] somebody please back to me he may be
[2:11:26] seated God is counting now he is taken
[2:11:30] out time is running out
[2:11:32] and all of a sudden God said I can't
[2:11:34] restore it all yet because I have to
[2:11:37] send a prophet
[2:11:39] because over the years they lost certain
[2:11:43] things but I want to send not pack power
[2:11:46] I want to send all the power all that
[2:11:50] God was he put it to Christ and all that
[2:11:53] Christ was he pours into the church but
[2:11:56] in order listen carefully forgot to pull
[2:11:59] all of the spirit all of the wood has to
[2:12:03] be restored because the word is the
[2:12:06] conductor of the Spirit now depending on
[2:12:10] how big the conductor is is how much
[2:12:13] power could go through that conductor if
[2:12:18] the wire is this small only that much
[2:12:21] power to come through and over the years
[2:12:23] they had the wire or hoe because all the
[2:12:27] worries that restored so I said when a
[2:12:29] power would come and they would have an
[2:12:30] anointing but it was not sustainable but
[2:12:32] when the prophet came it was a line upon
[2:12:35] line precept upon precept all the loose
[2:12:38] ends from Genesis to Revelation in the
[2:12:41] written word was now being tied up by
[2:12:44] the Ministry of the revealed word
[2:12:45] because these son of man himself had
[2:12:49] stepped into his son of man so it was
[2:12:51] not brother Branham tying up the loose
[2:12:53] ends but it was Jesus Christ himself in
[2:12:57] another time the Lord himself had
[2:13:00] descended with a shout to allow his
[2:13:03] power he wasn't taking chances
[2:13:06] Holloman to do this somebody please back
[2:13:11] to me why you will receive him because
[2:13:17] through the Old Testament he had talked
[2:13:20] about I will be their God and He will be
[2:13:23] my people
[2:13:24] that was a different type of
[2:13:26] relationship this relationship was not
[2:13:28] people and God this was husband and wife
[2:13:31] thing
[2:13:33] [Applause]
[2:13:34] this was man and wife thing so God is
[2:13:38] not this is not court and people think
[2:13:39] this is relationship thing I'm going to
[2:13:41] say I a taking chances with no man to
[2:13:44] man having my wife I am coming on myself
[2:13:46] I was slipping here and there the
[2:13:49] whisper loves secrets to her to let her
[2:13:52] know that I love her let's unknown
[2:13:54] shoulda woulda slipped something in
[2:13:56] there so when the Prophet come good
[2:13:58] evening friends it was caught himself
[2:14:01] slipping in secrets for his bride who
[2:14:05] only she could understand what he was
[2:14:08] saying people were sitting there in
[2:14:11] Indiana sitting there in Arizona sitting
[2:14:14] there in New York sitting there in
[2:14:16] California but he was speaking to one
[2:14:18] person his bride he was speaking to one
[2:14:21] person his lady come to church say man
[2:14:28] everybody feelin fine
[2:14:30] do you know who you are you may be
[2:14:34] seated
[2:14:35] in the meantime time is Compton now 65
[2:14:40] prophet leaves have seen and this is the
[2:14:43] age the season the time go to the reason
[2:14:45] for because when the Prophet left the
[2:14:47] angel did not leave the angel is here
[2:14:52] but I ran up said fixing these around
[2:14:53] for the coming of the Lord so the angel
[2:14:55] in 65 66 67 68 69 all these years moving
[2:15:00] things around shifting things around
[2:15:02] hunting down people some people were
[2:15:05] just to get you to know who you are
[2:15:07] they won't even part of who the bride
[2:15:09] was they were just there to carry the
[2:15:11] message the way the Prophet said it so
[2:15:13] that you would be here we were not here
[2:15:15] when the Prophet was here but thank God
[2:15:17] but those who he used to get to usher
[2:15:20] because the marriage of the lamb has
[2:15:21] come and his wife hath made herself

[2:16:31] something softly
[2:16:34] [Music]
[2:16:36] I'm finished I want to leave you with
[2:16:39] something there's something softly in a
[2:16:49] message lifting him out of history as
[2:16:52] you get ready to close out but the band
[2:16:54] said we are standing tonight upon the
[2:16:56] brim and watching come to pass and
[2:16:59] unfold to great scenes and both to great
[2:17:02] scenes are these one of them is the
[2:17:04] ending of history and by the ending of
[2:17:07] history
[2:17:08] he means a closing of the pages of the
[2:17:10] written word what has been foretold and
[2:17:13] the other one is the ending of time and
[2:17:17] many great men through the ages has
[2:17:20] longed to see this power that we are now
[2:17:22] approaching and as we live in this
[2:17:24] glorious setting of mortal Sun and the
[2:17:27] breaking of the eternal light I do feel
[2:17:29] as we are living in one of the grandest
[2:17:31] ages that ever man has been permitted to
[2:17:34] live because it's a closing out of time
[2:17:36] and the blending in of eternity history
[2:17:40] only tells us what we have read what has
[2:17:42] been and what's in the future is in the
[2:17:44] hand of God or Pentecostal or
[2:17:48] Pentecostal in the messages once more
