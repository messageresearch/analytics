thus say the lord speak to your people this morning i may believe your change and transformed then jesus may ask it amen before you have your seats we have two scriptures first corinthians 14 you want to read first five to eight and first corinthians 14 5-8 and first thessalonians 4 13-18 and first corinthians 14 5. i would actually speak for tongues but rather that he prophesied for greater is he that prophesied that he was speaking with tongues except he interpret and the church may receive a defile now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine and even things without life given sound whether pipe or heart except to give a distinction in the songs how shall it be known what is fight or heart for if the trumpet give an uncertain song who shall prepare himself to the battle and first thessalonians chapter 4 read in verse 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren considering them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which alive remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall deserve from heaven with a shout and the voice of the archangel with the trump of god the dead and crying shall rise first then we which are alive very mean shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the ear and so shall we ever be with the lord and wherefore comfort one another with these words may god bless his word you may be seated good morning and god bless you and welcome so glad to have all of you out this morning that's a great sign we're looking forward to have live service wednesday coming here oh praise the name of the lord praise be to jesus so tonight this morning have a title prepare yourself for the battle prepare yourself for the battle you know as we it keeps his song repetitive but just about week or two weeks ago these people in ukraine they were living normal lives going to the bank using the bank cards go into home teach pick up the children push the prom normal living all of a sudden the bombs are flying the homes are no longer there russians in the street all of a sudden wasn't the time of peace for them is changed the time of war and we come to exhort you today prepare for the battle brother brown so you know this morning you'll get the word right i'll not come here to tell you what i feel what i think you're coming to get the word right so we're on the word this morning tension speaking of tension i was praying about it this morning what would you do if you didn't have tension just think of it tension is part of living that kind of encouraged me when i thought that if you had no tension you'd be like a rag doll you wouldn't have no feelings there'd be nothing you could work on like a husband and wife maybe if you want to do something they're trying to work together especially christians and the other one once and then you come together and you find out what she's done she finds out the tension really brings you closer together and somebody tells you well just think of a little wife that went under a lot of tension when he wasn't so good or the husband went under some tension when he wasn't so good then it's all forgiven how you feel about him my you you've got to have tension that's all and some people try to introduce christianity that you're free from worry you are not you're free from tension no no you have tension when you become a christian ten percent human you add tension is your word and if it's the word you just say amen because it's truth so you're not looking for easy way of our past or as is you god has not as is you because he could have given adam a person a gardener eden it was just you know you eat or you eat or putting a fat a nice child no he told them the day you eat that did you die and if he's god he has to keep his word is that a matter of love and love is a matter of my word so we're not here for love in that sense and you know like and love no we here to get the word the word is god love to us god so loved us he sent his word that will be delivered that will be free that we'll get a breakthrough praise god don't think bombs don't fall you know a fallen transgender spiritual bombs the enemy dropping bombs all the time it's war going on you know and some people walking naive naive like if nothing happening and you don't understand we're wrestling against flesh and blood what i think all these wars is about but isaac identified in one of the bible studies it's jealous spirits it's in satan kingdom you know and that's gonna have national national wars you know it's some demon in russia jealous some other i'm just jealous but understand the war oh hallelujah and that's so sad war in churches among ministers he said the holy ghost can't behave in one man and misbehave another man is that the holy ghost the holy ghost have behavior god behavior is this person what give the lord a shout god behave is that a man behind a pulpit god behave as this person you have to behave yourself you have to be a christian a christian not someone who come to church a christian have christ in them a christian liver christian life a christian of christian behavior if you're a love christian behave you're not a christian oh give the lord i should i don't care what you believe you can believe pope francis i believe william murray and branham it doesn't matter what you believe you have to live something and have hindus and baptists and buddha people that's like better lives than christians come on we can do better than that that's why god said activate float you full to knowledge knowledge temperance and patience and cognitives and bodily kindness add the life of christ that you can live something and shake the devil that's the tongue that are gonna shake the devil and i expect the devil to be rocking in trinidad i expect that devil to be shaken in trinidad when them thunders begin to it off the fort oh glory to god in this message for all these years for naught i'm here for all this explanation i'm here to see a manifestation he said they have no manifestation to steal the pride it will take them seven thunders and he will send it no man of bringing it he's gonna send it if god wants to send it this morning he said it down oh glory to god he is sovereign in his ways in his power in his revelation in his deliverance and his restoration in his healing what glory to god he is suffering he's a waymaker this morning he's a provider this morning oh glory to god do you believe that may be seated praise god so we're not constructed by time so i'm free this morning we're here for six hours long time we have a long service oh praise god again fighting hallelujah okay so let's go he said here right when you become a real christian every moment you're wondering am i pleased in my lord if i could hear from him it puts you in attention it puts you on god that's what makes you what you are so after all tension is a blessing it's just the way you're looking at it see when you look at it correctly the truth romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good i mean this one go on this way and dock on whatever don't fight up with nobody they can't take your blessings badly talk about is reserved in heaven for you go put a reservation and put you ever go to a place and see reserve they don't sit there have a reserve sign when god put the reserve sign on your seat with your name nobody could sit on it oh give the lord a shout did you get that this morning your seat your place have your name with a reserve sign your brother you're sitting it your sister can't sit in it your cousin can sit in it your personal in front of you can sit in it that is your seat whatever you say so that's why they don't fight upon anybody they can't take my blessing oh glory to god [Applause] you know when i come out of the house and if they couldn't beat me when i was down in the hole you could beat me without when i was in the whole diabetes time to beat me up if the devil won't destroy me a long time he had a chance now and if he had all these years he will come now it's too late we right there you know we right at the border you know for the supernatural to break in the church the whole creation is that one piece of creation is not part of creation it's the whole creation groaning and travailing to see the manifestation of the sons of god when born sons filled sons anointed sons called sons predestinated son speak and your words are created just like that your children have something coming oh glory to god daddy bringing something you never saw before oh give the lord i shout it could be

yourself a man you could be a real genuine christian oh give the lord a shout in the house we have something to live for we have something to look forward for [Applause] all them wives and mothers run out of ukraine leaving back their husbands and sons to fight the russians you think they're not looking to come back home they're running the home just think about it you here sitting in your comfort zone think about you have to run from your own house not put your foot in here not with your fridge and your stove run with whatever they can run with to get out because the bums are falling we in a battle being a warfare never want to mash up your family you want to take your soul and your spirit and your body you want to hit them with cancer hit you with diseases and we have to fight right back and mind them they shall cast out devils they shall lay hands upon the shack and they shall recover oh give the lord i shall these signs shall follow them that believe this is the gospel this is what we have to manifest hearts turn back to the faith of the fathers maybe see them a bunch of people deceived on this message you know what they see it means take it right then they're wrong deceive they see by a belief as if what they believe it takes them in and when they wrap their express you know you go to the bus stop the bus driver and they go in and they say hold holy money backstage i said no i don't want any money i want a ticket to go to the ticket you have to go to take the counter and when you pay you have the evidence of purchase which is the ticket the bus driver not authorized to receive money he only authorized to receive ticket they say my father is saying so wear a ticket my mother who my mother is where your ticket but i just go to church so i'm so wear your ticket or are you messing a long time where your ticket i want to hear how long in the message because jesus gave a problem somebody was in the early times and some people come for the last hour on the same penny same ticket save money you have to have your ticket where is press play you keep respecting all you want you have to have your ticket not press play you take it well i believe the message that's not

give the lord a shout nothing must stop him getting it oh glory to god hallelujah you understand what i'm saying you understand my david said no ten thousand follow my right side i shall not be moved you cannot say somebody stumble you somebody show you off you're crazy in this last hour bombs are falling no body not supposed to show you off you supposed to be talking ducking all the bombs that fallen and pressing your way into the kingdom of god we are striving to enter the kingdom of god before these horrible plagues strike they're going to strike [Applause] don't think because we are in trinidad what has happened quite that wouldn't affect us don't you even think that you'd be naive and foolish to think it would not affect us hallelujah every action and reaction have consequences seen and unseen known and unknown right now massacres and visa card cancelled operations in russia and that's i was talking about that the other day you could just push a car and get no money that way that means you know that what that means you know pushing power just get this reason like that you know oh hallelujah and that is not the control of anybody in russia there's master and visa card that cancelling operations in russia it affect everybody with a credit card across there do you understand what i'm saying that when this press come down and they're asking if there are six seal halves you caught a seal if you don't like brother or do you like brother you know you have not asked that you know when you press come down like press come down you know oh let's get the church foolishness all that good right out because there will be a nonsense that's just the devil giving a sideshow once we fight one another the devil sit down and he relaxing on the beat somewhere but once we get it right once we get it together once we see what this battle is all about praise god the devil will take note that there's a bunch of people in the land under their messenger it looked like they becoming the final voice to the final age it looked like they know where they come from they know what they're going they know what they're expecting and they see in the devil they're going to expose him at every one of his tricks let me be seated my lord let me skip after that brother praying bless us no lord as we approach the word god father don't know is the reason that i'm approaching the word from this scripture here because i feel to want me to do it this way and it's your divine will it's in your order it's the order of the day to let the people positionally find a place and be ready for the hour of battle you hear what he said then let the people positionally find a place what's the purpose for the hour of battle not rapture yet not raptor yet let me get that piece people want to draft them real bad but they see the raptors escape hatchet i remember in school one teacher tell me all the christians only wanting one i want to go go i'm got them go to heaven i said no i said nothing may i different i i want to be a witness down here first before leaving here because the reality is leaving here is only temporary ever it's not at what destination that's in transit we shall reign on the earth it have no scripture we shall reign in heaven this is the heavens are in transit the only reason have this six dimension where the regions of the blessed are and all them saints who died among us as is there right now is because that's a lodge in place that has stayed until until we who are alive and remain did you hear what i call you until you who are alive and remain we who are alive and remain now by somebody everybody get there you know don't leave don't go let's go just so you know everybody can't go and who will be alive and remain to pull them from everybody go the devil can be that crazy hallelujah somebody has to be here praise god for the lord himself december man with a shout and revelation 10 brought the lord himself done with the open book to call your name that you could be here in this last day to be alive and remain look at me started this morning did you hear what i just said the lord himself descending up with a church book [Applause] if you send me the book and that book had your name that when he mentioned they come to you hallelujah okay so watch what he said the order of the day to let the people positioning node and find their place okay uh uh they're pleased and be ready for all battle as our brother said in his prayer to you not long ago you have trained us so long lord now father give us our ranks put us out there to what we are supposed to do so we can be about the father's business for we ask it in jesus name thy son amen oh give the lord a shout you hear that prayer you say give us ranks glory to god you know rank represent praise god ranks me in the idiot too you have to rank the devil under your feet because you're under your toe praise god give us all ranks give us our position give the lord some shouts my god my god hallelujah old testament my kayak coming them guys figure was time to make a move to take over and they asked him and they asked and they were saying okay and when he came up here turn around to jehoshaphat and said well what did i tell you call my cat my car speak to them what what they would tell them right what the word of them he said excuse me whatever it was that guy said what i tell you the fellow would that prophecy would prophesy evil against me what i say he'll only condemn our church condemn our ministers condemn our religion what i tell you he would say it i knew him i know it's definitely before him but i'm trapped his hands together i know he's daddy for him so he said yeah i saw israel like sheep scattered about without a shepherd and so when one of those fellows had that big horns was going to push off a preacher walked by pulling my car around smack him in the mouth as hard as he could which way did the spirit of god go when he left that went out of me because he's he's a big bad man so you give my car a slap i said which way the spirit goes since he left me wait till russia is sitting out there take over the nations and things like that listen wait till russia is sitting out there take over the nations and things like that and this country because of its backsliding and you will see what was right and wrong you will see whether your lukewarm religion will pay off or not so there's a prophecy that russia will begin to make its move they can't stop them you know they could be lame but they can't stop him let this nation come to tears no but branham is trying to bring a remedy listen to his words now let this nation come to tears not come to laughter and drama let this nation come to its knees and repentance that's what we need not a revival to get a whole other people in the church we need to close every bootleg joint stop all the cigarettes smoking tear down the factory startup real old-fashioned holy ghost campaign where men and women day and night laying on their face crying i tell you it'll be the greatest shelter that this nation ever had let the branham tamil cook with his foolishness not bad tacos headquarters please pray and and they the headquarters has centered this message not that let the brahmanam time answer questions foolishness let it get back here at the altar and get right with god make up with the neighbors and so forth that's particularly right with god you have issue with this one this is that one praise god the makeup makeup makeup you can't just cut your church i have a grudge here you have a grudge here use grudgy you're showing up judge when you when you leave home you pick up your hand basket handbag you walk with your handbag grudge but brothers have somebody in my pocket in your wallet you have to get rid of those things you won't have any fussing than going on it will be a drawing spot for the world now you know that's true and this this is only invasion of united states praise god and you talk about this trumpet now if the trump givers sing song the soldiers are trained the songs i'd have a bugle to wake up in the morning a bugle to come and stand attention at ease a bugle to match so that the so they trained the soldiers to the song song to attack song to retreat so if you don't know the difference between attack and retreat if you're going forward and the beauty booklet to retreat you attack and you'll get killed because then you move forward and you're not prepared for what is ahead of you so the general blow a trumpet to re retreat because you need better weapons than that you go with pistols than my machine gun so you say retreat to gary arm then you go go forward but if you don't know the song you could get killed i want you to listen carefully if you don't know the song you could get killed it has to be a certain song you can't hear a song and you're not yeah sure of course i wonder if the music are confused [Applause] when the besieged titus besieged the walls of jerusalem compassed about with armies all those trained soldiers them disciples jesus was sitting on the mount that day jesus told him this when you see jerusalem come pastor bought with armies let him that's in the field don't return to his house to get his coat let him in the house do not go on the whole stop to come down but flee to the mountains because there was gonna be a time of trouble jesus spoke these words and when titus around them how they could move but jesus when you see them move and surrounded jerusalem but then something happened back there that had to pull titus back and when titus pulled back the true christians the true people that was hearing the certain song they run out and get to the mountains then titans come back and they eat one other children they starve them out and they died and perish in jerusalem all those escaped ones is who listened to the certain song and god sent a messenger with a message that we will not be confused that we have a certain song seven thunders gave fate because the prophet said it seven times gathered right together because the prophet said it they don't want to preach it but he still said it oh give the lord a shout and we still pump in it we are changing it [Applause] glory of god seven thunders is that a new york revelation seven thousand christ himself he came down from heaven to lord himself and open his mouth and seven thunders after their voices okay the lord i shall this is not a new york revelation this is not a revelation from new york sorry new york does not own this sorry [Music] those who have been trained to the voice of jesus they took for the mountains as hard as they could and the only ones that suffered to survive it those unprepared don't know the song when the song of the coming of the lord blast oh hallelujah why did the bible get the parable about those wicked servants that would say the lord delay is coming the lord delays coming so you can fight one another true revelation show you first thessalonians 4 the lord has already descended oh and in the settlement he does three things a shout a voice and a trump the shout is the living bread that's what you hear every sunday morning and not my message the prophet's message the seventh angel message is the living bread that's on books and tapes and we glean from that and bring present or as well spiritual food in due season not every tape is to play now and have food in it and as a pastor i have to find that food and mix it just right put it on the plate and save it oh glory to god become oh i am a servant this morning i have it on top of here oh glory to god hallelujah we come to bring your full course menu we are coming to bring you soup this morning super just part of that thing becoming on your full coast menu oh give the lord a shout he said my people shall eat and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god [Applause] the church has united itself against the message and when it does that the nations are uniting themselves in communism to destroy the church no communism is not a movement communism is a spirit you should infiltrate in america oh we think about that now not communism as a you know them as communists no a spirit [Music] nations are uniting themselves in communism to destroy the church listen let's pause just quote me a little bit israel had to turn down the message first and when they turn down the message then the military the national life united itself together and come in and destroy the church and that's why i keep saying it's enough press come down no pressure coming down nothing because the bride has to become joseph the rejected which is christ being manifested in you that's joseph and when the brethren reject the bride then it gives the the surrounding military and political and phys and spiritual force the opportunity to destroy the church or attempt to try destroy the by elect so there's a movement to take place the battle is about to start against church members against false anointed against hypocrites the battle no but we're not going to get started we're not coming outside you know we're not going something inside oh god boy go in a big walkway and break out now you know glory to god in the trumpet given uncertain song who can prepare himself for the battle but you are going to be prepared the brightest will we made ready what the bible said his wife had made herself ready she going to make us ready for the battle that is ahead oh give the lord i shall shake yourself glory to god shake yourself shake yourself this morning don't think you're in anything yet it's about to get started [Applause] coronavirus or jesus san peron you know you still buying the world for two years you see are we every nation at the bow and then delete laws and regulations and instructions and so on it have more instructions coming in there's a test run you know the devil behind the whole thing you know god allowed it but what i'll say they're gonna use it oh let's continue glory to god and now the time has come to where communism is uniting the world together against the church why because the world will unite against communism [Music] president putin never expected the west to respond like that his action brought a unity among the euro the europeans and the west like never before because all them are the issues you know they said that demons and them jumping up there don't forget but putin russia is a bigger kind of spirit that them spirits have to fight up with is war it's war remember satan say holy kingdom the mind and hear lie that is one time you tell the truth all this in my mind i have power to give it to whomever i want if you're bored and i'll give you one again russia plus again just to keep all if you want i come back and pay for it i come back and take it i come around kick you out oh blessed being of the lord so watch he said we see the united time thank you return to this message when you see these things be united why we feel to see these things you look in here in the scriptures and see where he promised what he would do and now we see it coming to pass we see nations uniting we see isn't united together we see the churches united together it's united in time it's the hour of uniting it's the spirit of the age we have got to unite everything you talk about has to be organized he said it's a united time and it's going to go through to some kind of union of some sort and that union praised god is the very team that will bring on the mark of the beast it's a united time and it's working right up into that now watch this he said the jews united himself against jesus as their messiah therefore we see what happened we see the same thing no communism uniting to destroy the church after the church has united in the workings of churches and trying to destroy the message the word of god they're trying to get rid of it praise the name united how praise god united together now trying to destroy the message how do they destroy it how could they destroy the word of god they make it of non-effect non-effective by taking tradition as did back there and making the word of god of no effect he said how shall we know the voice of god in the last days it will be a manifestation of the prophet's word the prophet's word only bring back that real supernatural gospel oh praise god you have to want that if i train you and sit now i'm hearing you're bringing notepad in here right down whole day praise god but if i want to bring you on the expectation for the manifestation then we preaching the promises of what god promised oh glory to god and god had promised no educated intellectual certain dead church god promised a church on fire for him a church anointed on commission a church that cast no devil's healing is sick praise god praise god listen to this oh glory to god oh harlow help me jesus you may be seated forget it i forgive me i get excited by myself see what's happening something when jesus come on the scene nobody never saw devil castle [Music] they only know what priesthood tall hats nice guns custom made them custom-made costumes and everybody re speaking as priests so when jesus cast of the dumb and whatnot what that was witnessing satan your kingdom is being exposed because people didn't understand dumb spirit and death spirit and blind spirit and evil spirit these were spirits in people's lives covered up you're seeing flesh over them but there's demons behind them so once the power come and begin to flick with the finger of god flick flickle devils and flick away sicknesses and flickable disease is that you are identifying that there's a higher power that is dealing with the power of darkness there's a higher power that is dealing with satanic influences and it is here it is present it is with us that is what discernment does the word deserving the thoughts and intents of the heart shows there's a higher power that going between the bone and the marrow and can tell you what's in your heart or give the lord a shout so satan didn't want to be exposed and in this message you don't want to be exposed but by the eclipse he will be exposed oh glory to god he will be exposed [Music] [Applause] but we're in a process of national disturbance we see nations are breaking relationship year by year we find this nation being swallowed up in communism this one being swapping communism and right here in our own nation is honeycomb with communism and it will take over he said watch they're united you say brother branham is that true they are coming to the battle of armageddon exactly what they will do they are uniting right now that's why we got the u.n and everything we have the western world united against the eastern world communist and so forth united together they chase the line together this is what happened right now because of russia behavior it forced people who was not together together to come together and they wouldn't stop there they come in first so quiet they're coming now you're not seeing it no in that trillion cent but that is what's going to happen oh glory to god because we are more bombs than putin you know oh glory they've got our weapons of warfare yeah we have more powerful bombs they can't touch these bombs you know this bomb making past your walls this bomb does translate you the bombs we have free praise god they say we'll be leaving glory to god will we rather leap over walls hallelujah from this natural to the supernatural what glory to god when we jump over walls of the natural into the supernatural oh glory to god maybe it could happen this morning you know glory to god and bow back that cancer out to you praise god curse that disease inside of you

lord i shout in the house hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] i have this i have that you have what glory the quarterman hallelujah [Applause] the western world uniting against the eastern world communism and so forth it's all uniting together and while it's united of nations these signs national signs we see earthquakes and diverse places the church together all these things and while all this united me going on there's another united that is going on and that is what i want to point you to god is uniting his bride she is coming together from the east and the west from the north and the south there's a united time game going on right now what is your nagging for the rapture you talk about the invisible union of the bride oh god everybody getting the union and connection invisibly but they're going to be a physical union praise god you see that social distancing and they keep us apart and you're wearing masks and so much a distance in the church and so on that coming to we're in an end right now you have to come back together together fellowship and shake hand all that coming oh glory to god praise god because they're going to be a physical manifestation of a united [Music] god is getting states will you know she's united with what but the word watch this now for heavens will pass away but my word will never pass away she denied himself with thus saith the lord regardless of what any denomination or anybody else see she's uniting herself she is getting ready why she is the bride so you mean by the over only the bride can make herself ready yes the others are just going to church but the bride gonna take the word and apply to her life she's gonna take the clothes of the word and dress herself in the gong yummy yummy of his promised word that's the exact quote she gonna wrap herself in the gong of his promised word not on filler material praise be to jesus hallelujah she's uniting herself with the bridegroom with the word the church and the bride the word is becoming so one how until the very word itself is working out the works of the bridegroom oh brother ovid you mean when the word become one you see the works you mean god is invisible until it becomes flesh and when the word comes into your flesh my flesh our flesh it began to ooze out then you see evidence of the word become flesh or the bride and the word become one yes not one in talk one in a manifestation we had talked for 40 50 years it was the time of feeding it was the time of the revelation of these things being made known it had to be made known but once it is made known it made known for us to go to get what we have to receive because jesus openly understands the scriptures he openly understands to send them to receive something and once you receive it you got it once you receive it you have it once you receive it it is yours silver and gold have i know what i have i could give do you believe that hallelujah see this bomb now and the church the bride the word is becoming so one until the very word itself is working out the works of the bridegroom amen are united not more this but flee from everything and tied to jesus christ it is a united time god uniting his bride together bringing it back uniting the words of his promise oh my so the saints that are asleep in the dust of the earth will weaken and we will unite with them the living ones with the ones that are dead so that's why you have to have people that among us who have gone on that you could recognize i said look this one here look at this one here and when they appear it gives you a faith brother the season is on they're not appearing to everybody you know they are praying to those who are about to leave oh chloe think about it you watch people die and go on that we know glory to god so when they appear to the living ones who are about to be raptured oh glory to god remember jesus ministry his post resurrection ministry was only to his disciples and the dead arose and appeared unto many oh glory to god they're going to appear to you oh give the lord a shout hallelujah time is at hand hallelujah so watch the ones that are living uniting themselves with the word those that are gone already did that it all comes together to make one great union of the united before going up there oh my communism must arise the other things has to rise the church has to unite this about yonder and the nations out there for the welcomes the churches and the bride has to unite itself under the word of god in order to do that so he is drilling don't know the bride as you unite who who will you like us somebody from jesus of course not somebody in trinidad of course not you have to get the answer from the prophet message himself how was united he said in order to do that god sent down the heavenly sign and things and prove to the church god united time he's uniting of the word bringing back the faith that was was delivered to the saints bringing back this could only be done in this day the only time it could be done right now it never was attacked anywhere else they went off on the international sprees but no it don't belong to no didn't know my nation is free so god is ensuring that this bright move doesn't belong to any particular the nomination of the spree because here we go are you ready remember last service talk about the seal of god i miss all this judgment the issue here is the seal if you've got to receive the mark listen to why god sends seven days from eternity and we have this cloud that we witness he said watch because it's time for you the 19 of men and women of every race every color every creed everything under christ by the baptism of the holy spirit and back to the word not united on the press play no this is the word here now oh glory to god that pressed praise man's interpretation of men's idea this is the word here this is the time to unite every man every woman every race every creed under christ by what by the same baptism of the holy ghost and back to the word but guess what the baptism of the holy ghost has been rejected and that is the stone that the bill is refused oh give it lord i shall the praise and the cornerstone has become the headstone and the head shall not be rejected in the early church it was the cornerstone and the end time church is the capstone it's the same stone christ is the stone and he has been rejected oh glory to god you see mankind produced that because that is supernatural okay the lord has shouted in the house we could read and preach and talk and explain and reveal and all them stuff but this part is god himself giving you fire pulling inside your heart why we can't preach that why we can't talk about that why you don't want that it will take and burn the lasso to you it will bring the cravings out to you it will bring the evil out to you oh don't you want that don't you want them sarah so come down the burners and burn [Music] never before since the early church age did we see the things that we are seeing today and this was only made possible when god send the seven seals and give us a sign by it and send seven angels don't go to heaven and come to bring back that scattered word in them denomination to tie back into the word of god to bring down his holy spirit so the object of this message is to fit the word together to pull down to bring them to pull down to bring down the holy ghost itself we're not talking about 1906. okay the lord i shout in the house you can't break this no man on earth no ministers could break this the objective of seven angels come from eternity to carry all this scattered word to bring all their mysteries written and hidden the object of it is when it all fit together it brings down the holy ghost because the word is a conductor of the spirit so the spirit couldn't be effective because the full word was lost but once that word is restored god of a channel cordova avenue god of aware he could sweep down that pipe and said dear is my spirit flowing freely glory give the lord a shout hallelujah say amen say hallelujah say glory i'm encouraging you to say glory to god you have some of this shout about let me read it again god send the seven seals and give us a sign by it and send seven angels down from heaven come to bring back the scattered word what did he say that angel came to him every night to open up the word so it wasn't his revelation things he thought was so the angels were shamed so so every night that angel come them and open this seal that sealed that seal oh glory to god and christ was the seventh seal oh give the lord a shout and the prophet said i am waiting the seven seal is open just waiting for no look the book is open just waiting for the seventh seal to be identified in the coming of the lord oh glory to god you heard what he said after the seas he said the book is open i'm just waiting for the seventh seal the last seal to be identified in the corner of the lord and when the prophet was about to leave on the message called the rapture that's where it was tied together he take the seventh seal seven thunders hanging on the gable of paper and he come and identify the lord himself as the coming of the lord and that is where the buff is at this morning he identified first thessalonians four the lord himself descended from a man with a shout then he said what is the shout what is the show he said that's the living bread that's the message to get the bright together oh give the lord a shout there are two other parts of his coming voice and trump oh glory [Applause] glory glory so we now see when they reject the thunders they actually reject the coming of the lord they actually reject the message the message just press play and play books and tapes the message is seven thunders the message is what came at christmas seven thunders utter the voices to catch the pride your name is endear your deliverance is endear your redemption is in dear your power and placement is india [Applause] what about him he's preaching what did it say malachi for would restore restore back the original pentecostal fate back to the people with the same pentecostal message with the same pentecostal sign i want speaking in tongues back i want interpolation back i want every sign i want to back in the church i want gift of prophecy gift of tongues i want every living thing that god promised back inside the church the same thing we have we want that same thing don't tell me i gotta sit and see people say amen and leave and go home oh give the lord a shout oh really the god i want that same angel that was with the prophet to come right here in this building and you feel when the angels step inside of here not that spirit move till we say so oh give the lord a shout in the house i ain't crazy we're not crazy excited but not crazy hallelujah watch watch same pentecostal evidence the same god same power same teaching with the vindication of the same pillar of fire that struck down paul saul turned the road onto damascus among us doing the same thing people want to talk about doing the same thing not just mystery talking but doing the same thing same works i do shall you do also glory to god hallelujah we see the nation's uniting we see the world united we say church united we see united by united united with the word the word is god as the bridegroom being the word the bride being the hero of the word so the bridegroom speaks and the pride hears the pride receives oh glory to god now jesus needs his bride he said i am the vine you are the branches oh glory to god because the bride will be a reproduction of the original dream oh who i feel this morning you are pregnant with god oh hallelujah praise god [Applause] watch they're uniting together putting their powers together the free world they're putting his power together communism is putting the power together with russia everybody one scared of the other that's a national sign hallelujah and god sent us a sign to a astronaut jesus christ in the form of the pillar of fire that he was in the old testament that he when he met saul and what does it do does it bring fear it brings love are uniting one of another a feeling for one another it brings the love of god so all this drama going on love's supposed to start to build back up in the church he said because of iniquity the love of many going to work school but if there's a cleanser coming if the purifier coming he shall purify with fire a purifier of silver oh glory to god he shall purify you no iniquity cleanse me lord from secret sins hidden faults oh glory to god cleansed by fire loving is appearing glory to god that makes i miss singing a little bit do you know you have to appear before he comes yes [Music] come on we appreciate this already we're not preaching something new you know we have the appearance of the lord in the coming of the lord he appear among us as a witness that he is coming you have to see him up here i am the lord you see me for years i am not he so don't try to put no crunch on me and i ain't calling myself either are you understand what i'm saying he has to appear among us that you have to know it is jesus naughty or ovid oh give the lord i shall not some fightful minister we're talking about jesus christ the same yesterday peace be unto you he came among the disciples he don't even need the usher to open the door because he could pass you was give the lord a shout in the house he doesn't need an introduction he doesn't either digging the shame his seat or shutter action into place [Music] so this uniting with the word is supposed to bring a love a love covers a martial sins who have not gossip on people but love them enough to pray for them lift your brother up lift your sister up some of them demonized but it's still your brother still your sister praise god pray for them spirits overtaking them messing them up some of them deceived they have to pray that they spiritually reception come offer them to freedom from themselves that's a big one to free them from themselves you ought to be free from you oh a personal deliverance personal demons get cast out you've seen everybody demon but yours see everybody fault but yours seen everybody history but yours you know i have a big lug in it and you're seeing all the mad sickened people like oh give the lord a praise offer don't let me go there this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah you should take out the b-more guy that you could see clearly before you talk about somebody watch your hands watch your mouth watch out what you say watch what you do watch your life and shut up make sure everything clear with you before opening your mouth oh give the lord a shout as i talk about mountain opening we have some more critics you know hallelujah you say we gonna shut them out of their critics we can't shut up and talk it's having a shot with that monetization oh glory to god this is that that the prophet william random speaker not this is that your body you already see that and brothers but you see that you know you people say that i'm a prophet [Music] forget brother to you i am not a messenger you know i push in another man's message god sent a messenger to me to the world to you we are preaching the spirit the bride and the prophet say the same thing and what they say saying the word everything we appreciate use a puzzle go back and find it you should go back and read it and listen and say praise god be saying with the tape say yes a little from here here a little there a little layer upon layer upon layer that you can get a good menu praise be to jesus they are uniting themselves one group you have to fight the other one like the message one group you have to fight the other one here the church is standing between them you watch what happens they unite them together we find out that brings fear and frustration should i keep it a secret never private revival i have a private revelation they have light and they hide in it they're all they gotta hear the other lights like by the out don't like on them but if you take the wood you see you don't take a light and put it in that bushel you put it on top because you want to see where you're going you go bounce your foot you know [Applause] might stumble and fall but the church the bride united by god under one spirit the spirit of god in one holy union of god to be one holy bride of god altogether unity of the body the body is waiting for the bright as a bride so we call ourselves the bride for you the nighting of the bride the church is so coming together it should create prophecy it should create such a love among us that we should be hardly away from one another so that is my gopher's sake they're stabbing ourselves together because you don't know when you get caught up in the love supposed to love your blindness now your brother said bid love chop down and take all the evil out say your color for me to drop down we looking for charity to drop down the law and it will help me you know if we stay with this word this prophecy have to come the back all right so let me go ahead it should have a love among us it's create a love among us that we should hardly be away from one another that's right when you just you don't have to beg people to pray we're doing that l-o-v-e you don't have to beg them to worship god what doing that l-o-v-e you don't have to beg them to do what is right they just do it in love with him till there's nothing else so no pastor bring some big stick can beat you some people like that you know they have some kind of coco thing in them like abuse they like licks they like the man common boy boy hit you from the side from the left from behind when you leave church you're bruised and they're going back for marina because really and truly the only things beat out at them and they're not dealing with themselves so they prefer external forces legislate righteousness in them that's a big one you're not going to say that tattoo tape you know whatness inside of you and you want it out and instead of seeking god to get out only tell me about you i find you're not rebuking me you're not you know you're not calling out you know what you're doing wrong i see you you know what you're doing wrong so you don't know where you're going wrong so you waited me to call so you waiting for me to call around and say brother maybe you're not called maybe just enough for you maybe you should find some other place about a church we're not holding you know me we're not trying to hold on anybody here tell somebody we don't wrestle and drag no bull goat call inside here we are wrestling and pulling them i never pressed like all these 40 plus years and i intend to do it now when you're pulling hold them coming they come here again bye bye get them drink and give them this and get them some chicken and chips and all right and then afterwards yeah bull fighting and wrestling with that bullying inside the church just leave them he said my sheep here's my voice i'm a stranger they will not follow so i not envy anybody what they have but once i'm here i have the liberty to tell the truth because truth alone is what will set you free there are some people want to hear things they want to hear like i'd rather say one time you liked it you weren't always running everybody trumpets so the first time what trump is that's in here trump in here he need a life we want trumpets he needs deliverance but he wants trumpets what do i do he leaves he gone because he won trumpets we had lasting four that silly woman laid my divers lust have an itch in the airs they can't respect the husband but it is itching to hear the latest revelation they call it israel the ground i said get your ass off the ground mind your business and serve your husband well oh give the lord some praise is that you mean to go there this morning hallelujah thank you jesus i'm assuming you're safe to watch you say wake shake yourself quick where are we at praise god we are united in time oh praise are we nothing but the bonds of his spirit oh blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus oh my listen to this song he said we hear the trumpet song then what is it awakey saints of the lord why slumber when the end is nearing let's get ready for the final call if you're feeling dull just go and see up in ukraine if you feel just go on youtube and see clips of women running and see the gun shooting and tanks and so on like that things be kind seen through that people are thanking him it's actually my sinking hole you know in big tanks in this island you might sync with it thanks something we don't know about that take a look and ask yourself if that was you if that was your family that was your neighbor how would you do it's not like if you listening they all come for me bombs are looking for who poor who rich you know there's a lot of wickedness and evil going on there you know they bum they're bombing residential areas something you know you mind a business flipping your egg and thinking about you shelling your ending like that you know think about it now you ask for the war you have beg for the war but you're in a war in a battle now that is their scene in the physical realm what about the spiritual realm the war you will maybe may not even be part of what you have done is be part of what these generations have done before you don't even know but the bible said the fathers eats our grapes and their children teeth is on edge so you don't even know what happened back there that hit your lineage and what spiritual influence upon you from what things have done before he shall visit the sins of the fathers come to the fourth generation hallelujah not the sins of the mothers the sins of the fathers so it's important what the father does it is important how the fathers live it is important for the father to say and if you don't know you can learn and get to learn what they say what to do how to live because it affects generations our actions and behavior affects things seen and unseen let me see if i can wrap up here let me see you get it home stretch here but just one guy has to press the button that is all it has to happen one man it don't have to have a thousand soldiers trained just one man with no sense just possess of the devil to press that button and that's enough we got faith united nations just as deep he said watch he says watch they were there when khrushchev take off his shoes and beaten the desk what good does that do all the different ones is the uncertainty of the united nations but there is one certain song and that is the gospel prepare for the battle that's my title you just yourself this morning ppl for what the battle what battle the coming of the lord oh glory to god the coming of the lord is yes it is and we are right in it a lot of people headed for tribulation you know because they're not leaving towards the team to take them into a perfect fit to go into the rapture there'll be two in a bed one taking i love that not two groups two in a bed one taking one left twin a fee one thing one left the individual isn't that right prepare for the battle what battle the coming of the lord prepare yourself for the battle now what against evil when evils be setting the people in every hand everything going wrong home life going wrong united nations failing nations breaking atomic bombs are wrong homes splitting up motherhood is going low immorals among the people this trust among one another all the nomination fascinating students what do you want to do be certain prepare yourself for the backer oh my he says my god the brains of the army is in his captains the intelligence romell and germany the brains in germany hitler ramel eshenhauer military men patton you see all those men in the front is a captain and we have a five-star generation general spelled gesus jesus and he has five stars on us called fait fate and he never lost a battle he conquered debt he conquered hell he conquered the grave get the devils out of the way he's the chief captain so the devil even isn't isn't in the picture we shall come up please praise god the devil that is not even in the picture oh hallelujah the greatest battle was ever rage is setting right now when i think about it i stood there i watch him reveal things and show things he's the captain of our salvation the great hour of charge is at hand soldiers armors gleaming colors streaming fate and doctors setting yourself an array in this tabernacle this morning doubt on one side faith in the other soldiers stand at your post of duty our captain the mourning star leads on he never goes back he don't

doubt between liberty and bondage the battle is on shine your spare soldiers polish up your armor god is getting his soldiers ready god anoints his army oh give the lord a shout you believe that god anointed his army oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god god does what anointed sammy let me just stick inside of here but abram said this about jesus right he said when he was inside the closed doors he did something to make them know it was he after talking with them all day long hearing him preach for three years he was on earth then after his resurrection hearing him preach they did not recognize him until he did something just like he did before his crucifixion then they knew it was him now isn't it strange that it's sometimes something on the side of the supernatural to make us understand it's him that teaching itself won't do it teaching itself won't do it he never commissioned his church to go and teach the world he says preach the gospel or manifest the gospel and the gospel came not in one only but power and demotion of the holy spirit praise god praise god for teaching all these mighty teachers everybody teach them so they need for us to do that the drama but teaching alone can do it something has to be done supernatural oh glory to god and that's the way we bring our churches today with highest deeper prettiest pew best dressed crowd that don't break the toe hole of the enemy it takes that hidden power of the spirit of god oh praise god you mean people have tied up with enemy had to be broken yes oh god and teaching doesn't do it oh glory fire does it spirit does it let him continue like peter here peter here he was he was good with the sword when jesus got in trouble he pulled out his sword he could flop anyway cut the high priest his ears off with the sword when it comes to real christian courage he didn't have it but the spiritual courage he denied the word made flesh standing right among them he was good with his sword that's right he could do a decree just as good as anybody else when it comes to spiritual courage he didn't have it he failed right there no why he only he only know one thing he screed but brother after he went up to pentecost he put on the old armor of god now watch him a different person now he put on the old armor what was it the world that he walked with was what was in him burning him up with fire in his flesh and soul he had the whole armor of god that is god's provider armor he had the baptism filled with the holy ghost what is it god makes himself ever present his own army god on the day of pentecost sent down the full arm of god on his army so what's the full lamb of god the baptism of the holy ghost little while the world sees me no more but you shall see me is not right he is the holy spirit and the holy spirit is in us which is the word made the promise manifest this is the promise christ is the word and he makes it manifest now here we go almost done the spirit quickens the word makes the words the like powder send the bullet out there and like when david met goliath with a slingshot with a rock he had one place to hit that was right between the eyes the rest of of it was armored but god got in that spirit so what he's saying god got a hole upon david stone see david if he gets started going to the rest so when god they will release the stone which has mechanics the spirit take it up as dynamics and and and was a guided missile and hit right where he didn't have that armor isn't that right praise god something is fixing to happen cause there's the word the promise the power to sling it and what we need today is a man that will take god's word with the power of the holy ghost behind him to press it out there and watch it come to pass that is god's army now here we go he presents his army in the form of five offices first prophets apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists so all those liars who want to annul the fifo ministry that's what they are they're liars that's not the word at all this is what god said he presented his army oh glory to god isn't that right that's his army here we say that's his commanding officers all with the baptism of the holy ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes upon to meet the enemy with the word of god each one back in one another not fighting up with one another backing one up so when a man fighting the gospel and fighting this minister you know he's only five ministry at all that's not the first ministry they back one up is that right watch here this part this is the most important part here each one backing up with him the chief captain not in front not up here above not back behind but in them so the fifo ministry is god veiled in men as apostles teacher prophet evangelist pastors not man saying that is that because the bible said that oh my do we believe that oh blessed be the name of the lord that's his army or with the baptism holy ghost pick up play something or where the batman really goes praise god that's his commanding officers to meet the enemy everywhere under any condition he said with him the chief captain not out here in front up here behind but but in them that's the army vindicating what his resurrection by proofs of his works saint john 14 12. he believes in me the words that i do shall you also what is it it is god in the church in these five predestinated offices backing up every word that he said with the holy spirit himself there which is the wooden manifest proven his resurrection proving that he lives russia make a little move just a little more i shouldn't say a little move they're moving a long time one time they went and take georgia a place called georgia then they take doing obama time crimea and he's setting up a definite plan now he come down and take trying to take ukraine he's not going to stop there no that spirit in him not gonna stop once he get through the air he's gonna go further that forces the unity on this side the west gets united and that going to be reflected now the church united to follow this conquest churches they're fighting communism and they fight communism and they're heaping up now and whatever go against what they believe they're going to cut off and that's where we come in now because remember this church is to be a bride of christ not one of the regular other denominations we're not supposed to be like a regular other church like pentecostal church we're supposed to have a church with a shout of the king in the camp christ walking in it could you imagine christ inside this church here walking in it cripples walking healing rocking the pentecostal hearing about it everybody hearing fire in the building crippled walking all kind of supernatural taking place you think that's easy for them to listen to and hear about they're gonna want to know what's going on then they hear them believe in a prophet called william branham they say he falls them falls and this afterwards now pressures haven't come upon them the word stop it that's what's coming right what are you gonna do since how are you going to be paying hard for that you want to be genuine you want to be sincere you want to be ready how could you be genuine and approach god and there's inequity in your heart are you going to be insane you know you haven't made things right you have to make things right when you make things right you can approach god because the end of the day is he is he want to take us out we can't take ourselves out all these ministers are saying who any bragging on it by this foolishness i feel sorry for them they have problems they have issues on the field by declaring this and declaring that come like somebody's come like this because the people commanding god i command you to do this i'll come i keep them in charge of god i'm in charge of god commanding god and telling god what to do and god nothing here them god not even speaking to them and then in their own world with the money and the whole money god's plans on and commanding gospel they're not even praying right now they're declaring the suffering i declare i declare all i'm declaring now i declare this i declared as i declared this that means the declarations declarers did not pray no more oh god i'm dependent upon jesus i pray them something praying they won't declare any clearing declaring oh god fooled you know how to close i was studying this message called uh harvest time i've listened to that message several times and somehow i just couldn't like you almost like you you know you're in i'm not getting what i want to get i'm not like i'm missing something in it at this time i pray i say lord jesus would you open up to me what the prophet said in this half this time and it was an odd scripture he read about jesus and a temptation and it's written and written and so on and i'm listening i'm listening and all of a sudden because he himself said he don't know why he's calling this message half his time he said that i don't know why i'm titled his message harvest time but this is something that's going to come in harvesting so he's going to how it is written it's written also written and so on and he was showing that in the last days when the devil recognized he can't move with this he's going to give you a supernatural offer to be somebody the people follow your ministry and and a little supernatural and that just blew my mind somehow all the time i listened to the message i never heard that part and then he went on to say he will give you a position in church or i'll put you in this place so then they gave you a decomposed elder pose at this post and that's supposed to anchor you in his kingdom and his sister and how proud you'll feel to be this and you get positioned harvest time and you have to overcome the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life what is position pride of life i'm in this position see offers come in this last day the second one is a is a weird one because the second one with jesus tell jesus they satan tell jesus but it's written that those shall you know that's yourself against the stone and shall keep the up jump offer so be careful be careful in the last days he says a razor edge it has to be the word so that's why you got to put a watchman in the tower to watch for your souls that's why you have to understand and believe that god is speaking to us by his word not what i feel but by the word so it's addressing your life addressing issues addressing challenges you have to prepare yourself do you think the people in ukraine must prepare for this war of course not but things are not normal in ukraine and things will not be normal shortly in your life and around us and
