[0:00] Well, I woke up this
[0:02] morning. I didn't have no
[0:06] doubt. I knew that the Lord will bring
[0:09] me
[0:11] out. Can I have a witness in the
[0:15] house? I went down on my
[0:18] [Music]
[0:19] knees. I said, "Lord, would you help me,
[0:24] please? I got up on my feet with
[0:27] victory.
[0:30] Victory. Victory.
[0:34] Victory.
[0:38] Victory is
[0:42] mine. I told Satan to get
[0:47] victory.
[0:52] Victory.

[1:36] victory. Oh, as I'm journeying as I'm
[1:42] journey through this bar

[2:23] mine and I will call upon the
[2:30] Lord who is worthy to be praised.
[2:37] I will magnify the
[2:42] Lord who is worthy to be
[2:47] praised for the
[2:49] Lord in it. Blessed be the rock. Let the
[2:54] rock of my salvation be
[2:58] exalted.

[4:02] If you're happy, then express it. Let's
[4:03] learn how to grace.
[4:07] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Good
[4:11] morning. If you have your
[4:14] Bibles, I like the three points of
[4:27] scripture. St. John chapter
[4:30] one, St. John
[4:33] 8 and Zechariah
[4:36] 14. Before we read the
[4:39] scriptures, shall we bow
[4:42] heads? Our gracious heavenly
[4:45] father, we come to you this morning one
[4:48] more
[4:50] time in this glorious weekend of
[4:53] meetings.
[4:56] recognizing Lord that you are the king
[4:58] of
[4:59] kings, lord of lords.
[5:04] You are our risen resurrected Lord Jesus
[5:08] Christ. We praise you this
[5:11] morning. We bless your
[5:14] majesty. We glorify your
[5:17] name. We declare you are worthy to be
[5:20] praised. We say great is the
[5:23] Lord worthy to be praised.
[5:26] We praise you this morning.
[5:29] We worship you this morning.
[5:32] We bless your majesty.
[5:34] And we come to you
[5:36] Lord recognizing Lord we are all such a
[5:40] needy
[5:41] people. And in this season of
[5:45] Christmas, we recognize
[5:47] Lord that you come
[5:49] down to take on the body of flesh
[5:55] to live where we live
[5:58] so you might know how to utterly save
[6:01] us to the
[6:03] uttermost. And that's why we are so
[6:05] confident this
[6:07] morning that we can come to
[6:10] you and find present
[6:13] help in every time of
[6:15] trouble because you know exactly how we
[6:19] feel. You know exactly what we are going
[6:22] through. So we thank you
[6:26] father once again this
[6:28] morning for the blessing for the
[6:32] privilege to come to your presence.
[6:35] We thank you Lord that we can come as
[6:38] your beloved
[6:40] children come into the heavenly
[6:43] father. We are so thankful, Father, that
[6:47] we can call ourselves your
[6:49] children, the children of the most
[6:52] high. And so,
[6:54] Father, I would ask one more time
[6:58] today that you'll give us of your
[7:01] blessings. We thank you for this
[7:04] weekend. We thank you for the services.
[7:09] We thank you that you have met the needs
[7:10] of
[7:11] people, but we
[7:14] recognize we recognize there still needs
[7:16] to be met in the
[7:18] house. And so we ask this morning,
[7:21] Father, that you will drop down one more
[7:24] time and minister to every
[7:27] need that's in this building this
[7:31] morning that we can all at the end of
[7:34] this service
[7:36] and at the end of these meetings tonight
[7:40] cry out with one loud
[7:42] voice like first two disciples on the
[7:44] road to
[7:46] Emus. Did not our hearts within
[7:49] us while he speak to
[7:53] us. Please speak to us one more
[7:56] time this morning and
[8:00] tonight. May you speak to us, Lord, a
[8:04] long life's
[8:05] way that we may find
[8:08] strength to press the
[8:11] battle that we
[8:13] recognize. There's still so much land to
[8:15] be
[8:18] possessed. Bless the reading of your
[8:20] word. Bless the preaching of your word.
[8:24] Bless the hearing of your
[8:25] word. Together all of
[8:28] us make one glorious sound.
[8:32] that will lift up your holy name
[8:35] and will join up with the heavenly
[8:37] chorus in Revelation
[8:40] five. So praise and bless the
[8:43] name of the dear lamb of
[8:46] God who came down to take on the body of
[8:49] Christ to die for us. Thank you father.
[8:54] May your Holy Spirit take prereeminence
[8:56] this
[8:57] morning over every
[9:00] spirit over everything
[9:03] and the glory will be yours
[9:06] alone. Thank you father. We'll be
[9:09] careful not just at the end of the
[9:11] service, but as long as you let us
[9:14] pray, we shall be
[9:16] careful to always give
[9:19] you all the praise, all the honor and
[9:23] all the
[9:24] glory for we ask you. We thank
[9:27] you in Jesus
[9:29] Christ. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[9:32] Before you sit down to the right hand,
[9:35] just may God bless you.
[9:40] God bless
[9:44] [Music]
[9:56] you. If you have your
[9:58] Bibles, I already give you the
[10:00] scriptures.
[10:02] Let's read from St. John
[10:18] 1. All right. Uh St. John 1.
[10:24] In the beginning was the word and the
[10:26] word was with God and the word was God.
[10:29] The same was in the beginning with God.
[10:31] All things were made by him and without
[10:33] him was not anything made that was made.
[10:36] In him was life and the life was the
[10:39] light of men and the light shineth in
[10:41] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[10:43] it
[10:45] not. John chapter
[10:47] 8 verse 12 verse 13. Verse 12.
[10:51] Then spake Jesus again unto them saying
[10:54] I am the light of the world. He that
[10:57] followeth me shall not walk in darkness
[11:00] but shall have the light of
[11:03] life. Finally, Zechariah
[11:06] 14 verse seven and verse
[11:09] eight. But it shall
[11:12] but it shall be one day which shall be
[11:13] known to the Lord, not day and night,
[11:17] but it shall come to pass that at
[11:20] evening time it shall be
[11:24] light. Amen. Amen. I think I just said
[11:27] God bless you.
[11:35] Amen. Amen.
[11:39] Well, we are thankful God to be in Ghana
[11:41] one more time.
[11:45] Amen. Amen. Amen. On behalf of my
[11:48] family,
[11:50] my wife couldn't make it. She um took
[11:54] ill just before we came.
[11:57] She sent her
[11:59] greetings. My daughters are
[12:01] here and our church is here
[12:04] also.
[12:06] Ministers, the
[12:08] chibo and our deacons are
[12:11] here. Some of the believers also and we
[12:14] are glad to be
[12:15] here. Amen. And we thank brother
[12:18] Solomon, precious wife
[12:21] James, the
[12:23] church for the invitation to be
[12:26] here and to put our shoulders to the
[12:30] wheel to help make the
[12:34] revival. Amen. Amen. For the all the
[12:38] churches that are
[12:39] here, we say
[12:42] welcome for the ministers, the
[12:44] ministers,
[12:47] welcome. We're glad you came
[12:50] so that we can so that we can have
[12:52] believers to preach
[12:54] to it's commonly
[12:59] said if there are no
[13:01] believers, there'll be nobody to preach.
[13:05] You know we preachers sometimes
[13:08] say you know if you all
[13:11] leave I still preach
[13:14] but
[13:15] truly if everybody leaves who are you
[13:18] going to preach
[13:19] to Amen. Amen. So we are thankful you
[13:22] did not leave.
[13:28] So to all the pastors and the ministers
[13:32] we thank you for bringing your people
[13:35] Thank you for being here to
[13:38] help. Amen. Amen. And I consider a
[13:41] privilege,
[13:43] blessing, a
[13:45] honor, big shoes that I hope I can fit
[13:49] in to be counted with these great men
[13:54] that have gone ahead of
[13:55] me. And I don't say that
[13:59] lightly. I don't say that for just
[14:01] saying words.
[14:04] I really mean
[14:05] [Music]
[14:07] that. Many times I think of
[14:10] myself said, "No, I can't be a
[14:12] preacher."
[14:15] Um, I get my thoughts all mixed up.
[14:20] But the brothers you have seen
[14:22] those are
[14:24] preachers and that make more sense to
[14:26] the
[14:28] world
[14:30] said that I'm only sowing a
[14:34] seed of
[14:36] men after me that will make more
[14:40] sense to the
[14:42] scriptures. So I salute
[14:45] brother Paul.
[14:48] Brother Paul tries to make me the
[14:51] bishop. I say sure I am the bishop
[14:55] but the bishop
[14:57] petit little bishop but brother Paul is
[15:01] the bishop
[15:03] lr bishop the great bishop he is the big
[15:07] bishop bishop and so the big bishop
[15:11] bishop open up the meetings
[15:14] I missed that service
[15:16] but brother theo told me that that
[15:19] service started off as though it was the
[15:22] final have it. So we shall salute
[15:24] brother Paul.
[15:26] Thank you brother Paul.
[15:30] Is it bishop or grand bishop?
[15:35] Amen. God bless you brother Paul.
[15:38] And then brother Nat
[15:43] from Jehovah to Jesus
[15:46] Christ. a young
[15:48] man going to the
[15:50] scriptures, going to the Old
[15:53] Testament and bringing out the seven of
[15:56] Jehovah
[15:58] and rolling them all
[16:01] up into his human
[16:03] name for
[16:05] redemption in the name of Jesus Christ.
[16:08] For he shall be called
[16:10] Jesus for he shall save his
[16:13] people from their sins.
[16:16] Thank you, brother Nat. I was telling
[16:18] him last night, we all guys can go sit
[16:22] down
[16:23] somewhere on a rocking chair.
[16:27] Same brother Nat, brother Naac, all the
[16:30] young men coming
[16:31] forward. And brother brother N said,
[16:34] "No, no, no. You are going
[16:37] nowhere. So we got to obey." So I obey
[16:41] that. Brother Phil, they said, "No
[16:43] retirement yet, brother.
[16:46] no retirement yet
[16:49] and um so now thank you
[16:52] terrific message
[16:54] and yesterday
[16:56] morning I mean what can I say but
[16:58] brother
[16:59] theo has already been
[17:04] spoken brother
[17:06] theo a warrior
[17:10] a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[17:14] has been a blessing down through the
[17:17] years from his
[17:20] youthfulness. He has been a
[17:23] blessing and brother Theo wherever it is
[17:27] duty
[17:29] calls he will go there.
[17:32] First time we went to Trina
[17:34] that I remember brother John
[17:38] said is this how far it is to come
[17:41] here and we tell brother to come all the
[17:47] time comes all the
[17:49] time and he comes brother will pray two
[17:55] times whatever he needs whatever duty
[18:00] calls brother has been to India two
[18:04] times. He's been there more than two
[18:07] times, but two times he's been in the
[18:09] commission all by himself
[18:12] and took the five
[18:15] services all by himself. Now that's a
[18:18] warrior of the
[18:21] faith
[18:23] Theo. Amen. Amen. And what a blessing it
[18:26] was yesterday morning.
[18:29] The spirit of the living God.
[18:32] open the words of life to you
[18:35] and in the afternoon the youth services
[18:38] the youth service those
[18:41] testimonies. Thank you brothers for
[18:44] letting us
[18:45] understand and know that this gospel
[18:49] works that the seven thunder
[18:51] gospel of Malachi's
[18:54] message really does work.
[18:58] It changes
[19:00] lives. Somebody can step into your
[19:03] life for the person of Jesus Christ
[19:07] and turn it around.
[19:10] And then brother Stefanos
[19:13] came
[19:14] after, what a
[19:16] presence, what a
[19:18] blessing. And how the Holy Ghost sent
[19:22] the word of conviction
[19:23] out the word of grace
[19:25] out. And not just the young
[19:28] people, but we older ones the
[19:31] Caleb who are
[19:33] blessed as brother Stefano spoke the
[19:36] words. And last
[19:38] night last night, the book of the
[19:43] generation of Jesus Christ and you are
[19:47] the
[19:48] continuation of the book of the
[19:51] generation of Jesus Christ.
[19:53] What a blessing. What a revelation.
[19:57] What inspiration,
[19:59] brother Isaac.
[20:01] Amen. Amen. God bless you, Isaac.
[20:05] Amen. Amen. So, you know, there are
[20:09] preachers
[20:10] and there are preachers.
[20:13] And then
[20:14] tonight, the preacher of preachers is
[20:17] calling,
[20:19] brother Raymond Thomson. Raymond
[20:21] Thomson.
[20:23] We love Brother Ray. Raymond. We
[20:25] appreciate brother.
[20:27] Brother Rey was speaking with brother
[20:28] Alfred Davidson last
[20:31] night and he hasn't been in Ghana since
[20:37] 2006 but
[20:41] he's brother
[20:42] Ray we're going to grab all we can
[20:48] tonight. So, brother Ray said while
[20:51] brother Theo was speaking
[20:54] um he said I hope you will show some
[20:56] kindness on me
[20:59] because almost all my notes
[21:03] and brother Isaac last
[21:05] night brother
[21:08] said in other words he's taking
[21:12] everything and he said brother Olu do
[21:15] you remember what I asked
[21:16] you would you be kind on
[21:20] I said I will
[21:21] try. I cannot
[21:25] promise. But he's a kind God.
[21:30] Even when I can't promise to be
[21:32] kind, God is always
[21:34] kind and he'll be kind. By the
[21:38] way, so those are
[21:40] preachers. And I'm going to try to
[21:42] pretend to be a preacher.
[21:46] So just bear with me.
[21:48] I got my notes all
[21:51] scattered. I'm the only one still old
[21:56] school have these loose sheets.
[22:00] And when I see the technology
[22:02] thingology,
[22:04] I had to spend some time in training
[22:07] that brother used to be my
[22:11] teacher, but I fired
[22:14] him. I've taken on Isaac.
[22:18] with more technology knowledge
[22:22] because brother taught me so
[22:24] long and I still have these loose
[22:26] sheets.
[22:29] So maybe if I change my
[22:30] teacher I'm sure Isaac it will be
[22:34] better. God bless
[22:36] you. I hope not belong with
[22:40] you. I will try not to belong with
[22:44] you but my title is
[22:48] um life is a process.
[22:53] Amen. You may be seated.
[23:00] Amen. Amen. And I got a
[23:03] subject the light of life.
[23:08] and my inspiration is called
[23:11] out. Now remember friends and don't you
[23:15] ever forget
[23:16] it. Life is a process.
[23:19] Everything about
[23:21] life is a process.
[23:24] Your Christian
[23:25] journey is a process.
[23:28] You're going to
[23:29] work is a process. You're getting
[23:33] married is a process. process. You're
[23:35] coming to this
[23:37] convention. It's a process. Every single
[23:40] day of
[23:41] life is a process. And if you understand
[23:44] the process of life,
[23:47] then you'll have life figured
[23:50] out. You know, brother Benam taught
[23:52] us that when you get to the age of
[23:57] accountability, something happens to
[24:00] you, you begin to get life figured out.
[24:04] Because at that time, God begins to hold
[24:07] you accountable
[24:10] for your sins,
[24:12] for the wrong things you do. But before
[24:14] that
[24:15] time, behold the lamb of
[24:18] God who takes away the sins of the
[24:20] world, every sin a child
[24:23] commit, every wrong a child
[24:26] does, the blood of a lamb wipes it out.
[24:32] But when that child
[24:34] It's the age of accountability.
[24:37] Which age is known to God alone?
[24:41] Each
[24:42] person only God knows
[24:46] that because John the Baptist at the age
[24:49] of
[24:50] nine already went into the
[24:53] wilderness. He was already aware of
[24:55] life.
[24:57] He was already conscious
[24:59] of the process of life. Of course, John
[25:02] received the bapt of the Holy Ghost in
[25:05] his mother's
[25:06] womb. When they get to that
[25:10] spot, that age of
[25:12] accountability, life begins to open up
[25:14] to
[25:16] you. Brother Bham explained, he said,
[25:19] "The serpent before the fall was an
[25:23] upright standing animal.
[25:27] The serpent understood
[25:31] the processes of life.
[25:34] That's how the devil Lucifer will use
[25:37] the
[25:39] serpent
[25:40] understood that when you introduce a
[25:44] seed, it can produce
[25:47] life.
[25:49] Understood how life
[25:53] works. So you got to understand that
[25:56] life is a
[25:57] process and when you understand that
[26:00] process that becomes a little easy.
[26:04] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Challenges you
[26:08] have, difficulties you
[26:10] have, pains you have, you can put them
[26:14] into
[26:16] proper because you understand the
[26:18] process of
[26:20] life. The devil will find it harder.
[26:24] to discourage
[26:26] you. Life is a process.
[26:29] Amen. Amen. Life is never about the end
[26:35] result. Too many people,
[26:38] too many of us, Christian,
[26:41] unbeliever,
[26:44] atheist, atheist,
[26:46] male, female, we are so focused on the
[26:50] end result.
[26:53] The end result is
[26:54] great, but you'll never get to the end
[26:57] result unless you have the process set
[27:00] out
[27:03] right. It's never
[27:06] about the end
[27:08] result. Sure, we want to get to the
[27:11] end, but we got to get the
[27:15] process, the journey to that end result.
[27:19] You got to get the journey
[27:21] right that processes the journey that
[27:25] takes you that takes you from
[27:27] here to
[27:29] there from here to that end result that
[27:33] you
[27:34] see and that
[27:36] applies in every area of
[27:39] life. So while we focus on the end
[27:43] result, the
[27:45] outcome, the goal, the target we are
[27:49] looking
[27:50] for, we must make
[27:52] sure we pay particular
[27:56] attention
[27:57] process, the journey that takes you
[28:00] there. Israel was in bondage in Egypt.
[28:04] God called them
[28:05] out and said the promised
[28:08] land I have already given it to
[28:12] you not I am going to give it to
[28:15] you I have already given it to
[28:19] you and because there was a mixed
[28:24] multitude that refused to understand
[28:28] that there's a journey to the promised
[28:30] land you don't come out
[28:34] Are you on the promised land
[28:36] tomorrow? There is a process. There's a
[28:40] journey that takes you
[28:42] there. And in that journey,
[28:45] there may be
[28:47] challenges. In that journey, there may
[28:50] be
[28:51] heartaches. In that journey, there may
[28:54] be
[28:55] pains. But if you will go through the
[28:59] process, you will get to your
[29:00] destination.
[29:03] Is it possible
[29:05] to keep you from your
[29:07] destination if you will follow the
[29:09] process?
[29:11] If you will stick with the process.
[29:14] If you will refuse to give
[29:16] up. If you will
[29:18] refuse to be
[29:20] discouraged, you will get to the end of
[29:22] the
[29:23] road. You will
[29:25] stand to the end of the road and you
[29:28] shout hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[29:31] Hallelujah.
[29:39] You may be seated.
[29:42] Amen. So in other
[29:44] words, we are looking to go to the
[29:48] end. And there's a
[29:51] journey to take us from
[29:53] here to there. And because many who came
[29:57] out of Egypt
[29:59] did not have their hearts
[30:02] set on the destination,
[30:05] they despised the process.
[30:09] And that's why they cause so much
[30:12] trouble and because of
[30:15] that they were all wiped
[30:18] out in the promised land. I mean in the
[30:21] wilderness you can't get to the
[30:23] destination.
[30:25] If you despise the process,
[30:28] it's not possible.
[30:30] Oh, hallelujah.
[30:33] Amen. Amen. In other words, the process
[30:37] is the means to the end.
[30:41] The process is what takes you to the
[30:44] future that you are
[30:46] seeking. The end
[30:48] result that you long for, the process,
[30:53] the journey that takes you there.
[30:57] The process is the now is the present.
[31:02] The destination
[31:04] is the future.
[31:06] And by taking care of the process,
[31:09] you are taking care of the future.
[31:12] You take care of the future.
[31:15] By taking care of the present,
[31:17] if you don't take care of the
[31:19] present, the future you are
[31:22] seeking will not come. Did you hear me?
[31:27] If you don't take care of the
[31:29] present, the future you are
[31:31] seeking will not come. It will remain a
[31:36] dream. It remain a pipe
[31:39] dream. You just be dayd dreaming.
[31:43] So you take care of the
[31:45] future by taking care of the
[31:47] present. That's the process of life.
[31:54] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Many
[31:57] people sacrifice the means
[32:00] sacrifice the process for the sake of
[32:03] the
[32:04] end seated. Amen. Amen.
[32:21] I said many
[32:23] people sacrifice the
[32:26] meat for the sake of the
[32:29] end. They feel once they get the result
[32:32] they're looking
[32:33] for. It doesn't matter how they get
[32:36] there.
[32:38] That's why many young folks
[32:42] all over the world, but in Nigeria in
[32:45] particular,
[32:47] I don't put Nigeria
[32:50] down. I'm a very happy
[32:54] Nigerian. I'm a very proud
[32:57] Nigerian. But the if you're very happy
[33:00] about your
[33:01] country, you speak the truth about it.
[33:05] We Nigerians can be a bit of a handful.
[33:09] Because process in
[33:11] Nigeria is in the
[33:14] picture we sacrifice the process
[33:18] once you get to the
[33:19] end. The young man wants to become
[33:22] rich. There's a
[33:24] process journey before you can become
[33:28] rich. But
[33:30] Nigeria maybe maybe you have them in
[33:32] Ghana too. I don't
[33:33] know. We have them in
[33:36] Nigeria. Amen. Amen.
[33:39] They sacrifice the process.
[33:42] They sacrifice the
[33:44] means of the end.
[33:47] I hope you're following me. What they
[33:49] want is
[33:50] money. But people who make
[33:53] money there's there's how to get
[33:57] there, but they don't want to go through
[33:59] that process. They want to short. You
[34:02] want to take a
[34:03] shortcut. There's no shortcut in life.
[34:08] But they want to take a
[34:09] shortcut. So they go into
[34:12] robbery. They go into 419
[34:15] and they quickly make money.
[34:18] That's not what we're talking about.
[34:20] Sacrificing the
[34:23] process. I'm sacrificing the
[34:25] means for the sake of the
[34:27] end. Once I get my
[34:30] result, it doesn't matter how I get
[34:33] it. No. Oh, but
[34:37] whatever is not going to work like that
[34:39] in this Christian
[34:41] race. We are looking for adoption,
[34:45] we are looking for the life of Jesus
[34:47] Christ made manifest in our
[34:51] flesh and there's a process to get
[34:54] there and we're not going to jump start
[34:57] it. We're not going to short circuit
[35:00] it. There's no
[35:03] shortcut. No adoption.
[35:05] You are going to go through the
[35:08] process. I understand a
[35:10] prophet. Take us through the process.
[35:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And we are going
[35:16] through the
[35:17] process and the
[35:19] price and it's worth his
[35:22] money on a
[35:24] journey. Adoption
[35:26] time. The devil can stop her.
[35:30] The devil is not going to tell
[35:32] her. No shortcuts.
[35:36] There's no
[35:37] shortcut. Even God
[35:41] to buy your
[35:43] redemption did not go through a
[35:45] shortcut.
[35:47] He dropped his
[35:49] robes of
[35:51] majesty
[35:53] town on that first Christmas
[35:57] day while shepherds watch their flocks
[35:59] by night.
[36:04] The very God of heaven
[36:06] come to shepherds
[36:09] like their sheep.
[36:11] The highest of
[36:13] heavens down to lowly speaking
[36:18] shepherds
[36:20] message the greatest message of all
[36:23] time. What is the message? Messiah. The
[36:28] message is here.
[36:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And so we
[36:37] celebrate Christmas.
[36:40] But don't miss the lesson.
[36:43] So
[36:44] God could
[36:46] not take a
[36:48] shortcut. So coming
[36:50] down and and putting on a body of
[36:54] flesh. And even when he came, he come at
[36:57] a little
[37:01] baby little
[37:03] baby to go through the
[37:07] process into a young
[37:10] man at
[37:11] home,
[37:13] obedient, growing in
[37:16] stature,
[37:18] favor with both God and
[37:20] man. He have those silent years.
[37:25] those 18 silent years
[37:27] where nothing was heard of him
[37:31] but he was going through the
[37:34] process in the
[37:36] process that's where something was going
[37:39] on that's why God will not allow
[37:44] you allow me allow this bride
[37:48] to bypass the
[37:51] process when you bypass the process
[37:55] journey on the road to adoption.
[37:58] You are a loser.
[38:01] But you are no
[38:02] loser. God is not a loser because you
[38:05] get a
[38:07] story. Brother told you
[38:10] that your story was
[38:13] written before the
[38:16] first and that story going to manifest
[38:20] it manifest. And when you manifest that
[38:22] story
[38:24] is going to be
[38:25] seen. The light of life is going to
[38:29] shine through
[38:30] you. The life of Jesus Christ, the
[38:34] spoken
[38:37] word come out through your
[38:40] flesh. There will be
[38:44] light. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[39:04] may be seated.
[39:06] Amen. Amen. So life is not so
[39:09] much about the end result.
[39:14] It's more
[39:16] important how you get to the end
[39:18] result. Because if you don't focus on
[39:20] the process, the journey, you'll never
[39:24] get to the end result.
[39:27] You know why? Because the process, the
[39:31] journey takes care of the inner man.
[39:35] The processes,
[39:37] the journey builds you
[39:40] up inside.
[39:43] The process, the process, the journey
[39:46] builds character in you.
[39:49] Be the man in you.
[39:51] Be the woman in you.
[39:54] Be the person in you
[39:57] that's going to be worthy of the promise
[40:00] that's going to be worthy of the end
[40:03] result. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's
[40:07] why that's why people You may be seated.
[40:10] Amen. natural types of
[40:13] spiritual. I'm trying to use natural
[40:15] example so you see what we're talking
[40:18] about. That's why when people win the
[40:21] lottery, they make so much
[40:23] money and suddenly become rich
[40:26] men because they did not go through the
[40:28] process.
[40:30] did not build up the character,
[40:33] the temperament,
[40:35] the discipline,
[40:37] the work ethic,
[40:40] the perspective
[40:41] that you build up
[40:44] on your road to becoming a rich
[40:46] man. So they make the money because of
[40:49] lottery
[40:51] and statistics show
[40:54] that within a year or two or three at
[40:56] the most
[40:57] whether they win $5
[41:00] million $10 million$2 million they've
[41:03] blown it
[41:04] all blown it
[41:06] all tell you a story from Nigeria you
[41:09] may be seated glory
[41:12] hallelujah
[41:15] Amen.
[41:18] Glory. You may be seated.
[41:25] Nigeria tell her president, I'm a very
[41:27] proud Nigerian.
[41:30] All right. So I say
[41:32] that caveat like the last say up front.
[41:35] I'm a very proud Nigerian.
[41:38] Nigeria, you can just run into
[41:41] money. You can just find some rascal
[41:45] today, become a billionaire
[41:50] tomorrow. This gentleman
[41:54] from some part of the
[41:58] country, you got
[42:00] some some allocation to lift crude
[42:04] oil. And when you lift good oil you
[42:09] run. So this
[42:11] guy this guy he he sold the application
[42:16] paper to somebody
[42:18] and he suddenly ran into money.
[42:21] He was in Abuja.
[42:23] So he went into motors that's
[42:27] brothers. He had money now. He had
[42:31] milliona. So, he bought a Rolls-Royce.
[42:35] He bought a BMW 76M.
[42:39] He bought a
[42:40] Jaguar. And I think he brought a fourth
[42:46] one in six
[42:49] months. He had run out of
[42:52] money. He couldn't even foil the cars.
[43:00] The Jaguar
[43:02] the Rolls-Royce.
[43:03] They were all sitting at
[43:06] home. No money to
[43:09] fill such
[43:11] cars because he not go through the
[43:13] process.
[43:15] God will not allow you to do
[43:19] [Applause]
[43:23] that. Let's bring it down to the
[43:25] spiritual.
[43:28] Adam Adam had greatness thrust upon him.
[43:34] Adam did not go through the process,
[43:38] Amen. Amen. of dying
[43:41] out of discipline and breaking down your
[43:44] human
[43:45] spirit. And he was so to
[43:48] speak an adopted son,
[43:51] a perfect man, an amateur god on the
[43:56] face of the earth. Adam could
[43:59] speak with name and could do whatever he
[44:03] wanted. He was he was on he was in
[44:06] charge of the world.
[44:09] of the
[44:12] earth in the place of his father
[44:15] God. But even Adam he brew it all
[44:20] away because he not go through the
[44:23] process character
[44:26] formation built up from glory to glory
[44:30] glory to glory to glory
[44:33] into the image of Jesus Christ.
[44:36] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Even though it
[44:38] was a type
[44:40] Adam going after Eve,
[44:43] but if Adam had gone through the
[44:44] process,
[44:47] I believe he would have handled it
[44:48] through a different
[44:50] way because he would have
[44:53] known that this
[44:55] hair cost God so
[44:58] much to give it to us.
[45:01] That's why God said
[45:04] from then
[45:05] on nobody,
[45:07] no seed of God, it's going to come to
[45:10] adoption again.
[45:13] It's going to come to perfection again
[45:16] without going through the
[45:17] process. And so we are here going
[45:21] through the
[45:22] process through the journey.
[45:25] Israel is our type
[45:28] called out of Egypt and the promised
[45:30] land already waiting
[45:33] and the promised land is already
[45:34] waiting.
[45:36] Your story has already been
[45:39] written before the finish of the
[45:42] world. God is the author of your
[45:45] story, but you are the co-author.
[45:49] You are the one that's going to make
[45:52] that story come alive.
[45:55] God's not going to dump that story on
[45:56] you.
[45:59] You are the one. The promised land is
[46:01] there. They have to take the
[46:04] world out of Egypt. Out of Egypt into
[46:08] the promised land. I saw you
[46:11] today. Had to take the world for you.
[46:15] process to make your
[46:18] story a great story,
[46:20] the story of
[46:22] greatness that God from the foundation
[46:25] of the world has made your story. The
[46:29] bride of Jesus Christ has a great story
[46:33] and she will get
[46:35] there. It's your
[46:37] choice whether you are going to be there
[46:40] as part of that bride.
[46:43] Because
[46:44] ultimately really what each one of us
[46:48] is a story that brother Isaac told you
[46:52] last
[46:52] night. Adam did not know he was writing
[46:54] a
[46:56] story. David didn't know he was writing
[46:58] a
[46:58] story. Tama did not know she was writing
[47:00] a story.
[47:03] H um um um what's the name now? Um the
[47:07] harlot. Rahab did not know she was
[47:09] writing a story.
[47:11] Ruth did not know she was writing a
[47:13] story. Neither did Mary, the mother of
[47:15] Jesus,
[47:17] know she was writing a
[47:19] story. But you know
[47:21] now every day of our
[47:24] life is a
[47:26] story that we are reading now. We become
[47:30] written epistles.
[47:32] read of all men.
[47:35] So you
[47:37] know, Amen. Amen. Every day you are
[47:41] writing at every script of your story.
[47:46] What story are you
[47:47] writing? Elohim wrote a beautiful
[47:51] story. Are you going to make Elohim a
[47:54] liar? The devil is a liar.
[47:58] The devil wants to write another
[48:00] story of your life, but he cannot do
[48:04] it. And that's
[48:06] why make sure there's a process
[48:10] to redemption. There's a process
[48:14] to adoption. So you can write your
[48:17] story.
[48:18] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. What a
[48:21] beautiful story you are.
[48:24] Glory.
[48:25] Glory to God. Amen.
[48:27] So we thank God.
[48:30] We thank God to know what each of us
[48:34] really
[48:35] is what we each of us truly becomes is a
[48:39] story and we all writing that story of
[48:41] our
[48:42] lives one day at a
[48:45] time and the
[48:47] process is what takes you through the
[48:49] story
[48:50] writing. Amen. Amen. And it's a
[48:53] beautiful story you have.
[48:56] Oh, glory to God. Oh, glory to you.
[48:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, our
[49:00] Christian journey, God sent a prophet.
[49:04] We know that. You know that, don't you?
[49:08] Amen. Amen. His son is a mighty
[49:11] prophet.
[49:13] Seated. Be seated. All right. It's okay.
[49:17] The prophet,
[49:19] the prophet Elijah, the prophet William
[49:21] Brandham, the prophet William. Amen. The
[49:24] great Elijah. prophet I always call
[49:26] him Malachi
[49:28] 4 who revealed the entire
[49:34] mystery and in doing that he resurrected
[49:38] Jesus
[49:39] Christ from
[49:41] history the present tense God of
[49:46] redemption you'll see redemption so
[49:49] clear you see the story of redemption so
[49:54] [Applause]
[49:56] You know,
[49:57] God is a great storyteller
[50:02] who could write a story like brother
[50:04] Isaac painted
[50:07] yesterday man who write that kind of a
[50:11] story. It won't even cross the
[50:15] mind. Won't cross your mind
[50:17] either. Won't cross mine neither. Only
[50:21] God will write that kind of a
[50:24] story. The Bible is a book of stories, a
[50:29] story of redemption.
[50:31] And by the time you take your story, my
[50:33] story, every story from Adam,
[50:37] right down to Adam again.
[50:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. From Eden, right
[50:42] down to
[50:43] Eden. Of our
[50:45] stories will make up this beautiful
[50:48] story of redemption.
[50:52] And we thank God for a prophet that came
[50:56] to reveal this to
[50:57] us that revealed the entire mission of
[51:00] the
[51:01] Bible. And in revealing the entire
[51:03] mission of the Bible, it made the word
[51:06] of God present tense.
[51:09] He brought Jesus Christ from the pages
[51:12] of
[51:13] history in the present
[51:15] tense and told us that if we will do
[51:19] what he
[51:20] said every single day of our
[51:23] life as we go through this
[51:26] process, we also will find Jesus Christ.
[51:31] He's not a god of history.
[51:33] will find out that he is the same
[51:37] yesterday and today and forever.
[51:42] Our primary purpose,
[51:44] in this message,
[51:46] this morning, in this convention tonight
[51:51] is to raise him out of
[51:53] history like they did in the book of
[51:55] Acts. They took Moses and they have been
[51:59] with Jesus. They didn't have to say one
[52:01] word about it.
[52:03] people
[52:04] do questions. We see
[52:08] Jesus people and God sent a prophet with
[52:13] a message that you and I every day of
[52:16] our lives as we go through the process
[52:18] of
[52:19] life will raise him up out of
[52:22] history. Oh hallelujah.
[52:25] This prophet he revealed the entire
[52:27] mission of
[52:29] God for mystery purpose of God. Our God
[52:34] before the foundation of the world had a
[52:36] three-fold
[52:37] mystery to have a bride, a preeminent
[52:43] bride, his pride in whom his
[52:47] preeminence in whom his
[52:49] excellence in that bride glories, his
[52:54] preeminent nature, his majesty will be
[52:57] seen in that bride.
[53:01] Adam, Adam fell and Jesus Christ was the
[53:06] second Adam and we beheld the glory of
[53:10] the preeminences of God.
[53:12] God in preeminences
[53:15] in Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ the
[53:19] second Adam is putting those
[53:21] pre-minences in you
[53:23] by the prophet message of
[53:26] Malachi by the message of
[53:28] redemption not
[53:30] salvation but
[53:32] redemption full total
[53:36] redemption that message will bring Jesus
[53:39] Christ into your flesh
[53:42] light in the end
[53:44] time for the
[53:47] prophet. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[53:50] Malachi 4. He revealed by his message
[53:54] the way
[53:55] back to the tree of life. He revealed
[53:59] the way back to the garden of Eden. He
[54:03] revealed the way back to eternal life.
[54:06] give you the way back to
[54:09] Jerusalem. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. By
[54:12] his message, all the dynamics to your
[54:17] mechanics reveal the way back to the
[54:20] tree of life by the great mystery of the
[54:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[54:27] sensation. But the mystery of the person
[54:31] being in you and forming in you, the
[54:35] fullness
[54:36] signs and wonders are
[54:57] miraculous by this divinely revealed
[55:01] promises partaker of the divine nature
[55:05] The promises are real because there's a
[55:08] story. They are real and we are going
[55:12] through the process until the promise
[55:15] will be made flesh before our very eyes.
[55:20] Oh, the mystery of the person.
[55:23] Amen. The person is the anointed word.
[55:26] Jesus
[55:27] Christ Malachi 4. The prophet William
[55:31] Brham he revealed this person. his
[55:35] anointed word, Jesus Christ. He revealed
[55:39] him in the days of his ministry. And
[55:42] then the prophet went to be with the
[55:47] Lord. And in recent
[55:49] years, a lot of rascals are raising
[55:52] up to try to try to disprove
[55:56] them. I tell young
[56:00] people, don't even go to find out what
[56:02] they're saying.
[56:07] pornography. Pornography. You don't go
[56:09] to watch pornography on
[56:12] YouTube to know excuse me how to do the
[56:16] act or to know what they're doing. You
[56:19] don't do it. You know that. I will never
[56:22] do that. And all this talk on the
[56:28] internet. Don't do it. Don't even look
[56:31] at it.
[56:32] It will pollute your
[56:34] soul just like just like natural
[56:38] pornography will pollute your soul.
[56:40] Spiritual
[56:42] pornography wars against your soul
[56:46] spiritual. You have your
[56:48] eyes set on the eastern
[56:51] sky. You have your soul, your goal set
[56:56] on
[56:58] eternity. God said a prophet
[57:01] prophets, not these
[57:03] rascals who are not even born.
[57:06] They were not even in the queue yet.
[57:10] Where where children come from, they
[57:13] were not even in the queue
[57:15] yet. When brother Brennan left the
[57:17] scene and they have a lot to say about
[57:20] brother Brennham's
[57:23] life that Satan and Lucifer has
[57:28] happened, all his evil names
[57:31] all into one
[57:33] for you. Thank God. God sent us a
[57:37] prophet, a
[57:39] prophet with a hidden time
[57:44] light. He revealed this person of the
[57:48] word, the anointed Jesus
[57:51] Christ. And then the prophet went to be
[57:54] with the Lord in 1965.
[57:58] God, the mighty God
[58:00] was very in Malachi 4. Now St. John 1:1
[58:05] in the beginning was the word and the
[58:07] word was with God and the word was God
[58:11] and the word was made
[58:13] flesh among us. Now
[58:16] listen in him was
[58:19] life. Watch the order the
[58:22] word and then out of the word came the
[58:25] life and out of the life came the light.
[58:30] In him was the in him in him was the
[58:32] word. And in the
[58:34] word was
[58:37] life, and it in him was the light of
[58:40] men.
[58:42] And the light shines in
[58:44] darkness, and the darkness can stand
[58:48] it. And Jesus said, he that walks, he
[58:53] that follows me. He have the light of
[58:56] life. Jesus, he was the word. Out of the
[59:01] word came the life. Out of the life came
[59:05] the life. And so when you receive the
[59:08] word, the son of
[59:11] man
[59:13] forgave. It will give you a life and
[59:16] that life will be light turns in
[59:20] darkness and the devils
[59:23] recognizing even X-ray machines.
[59:28] have the
[59:29] light. Let me read from brother
[59:33] maybe. Glory. Glor,
[59:48] brother Brennham
[59:51] of the message
[59:53] the Messiah
[59:55] January 17961.
[59:58] So now we are made up we are made up of
[1:00:01] light meters.
[1:00:04] inside of us is cosmic light.
[1:00:08] Now that cosmic light
[1:00:11] is an
[1:00:12] X-ray that's coming is a light that they
[1:00:16] can take an X-ray
[1:00:19] with. The X-ray doesn't come from the
[1:00:22] X-ray
[1:00:25] light. When you go to take an
[1:00:28] X-ray, the X-ray machine shines on
[1:00:30] you. They have gone beyond the extra
[1:00:33] machine now. But let's take
[1:00:37] this raised from the extra
[1:00:40] machine get directed at you to pick up
[1:00:43] the light in your
[1:00:46] body. That's what
[1:00:48] happens when there's a
[1:00:51] disease. The light in your
[1:00:54] body gets darkened up
[1:00:57] and the X-ray machine just picks that
[1:01:00] up. photograph there's some area
[1:01:03] there dark layer and he shows there's a
[1:01:06] disease
[1:01:07] there that's why when brother was
[1:01:10] here the light you say there's a light
[1:01:13] over that
[1:01:14] person that dark light there
[1:01:19] that's cancer and he will pray and say
[1:01:23] that dark light has gone away is white
[1:01:26] light now
[1:01:28] hallelujah hallelujah the light of
[1:01:31] life. Every human being that goes in the
[1:01:35] world is like there's light inside of
[1:01:37] us.
[1:01:39] But as we grow
[1:01:41] older and death settled in the body,
[1:01:46] the light in the
[1:01:47] body darkens, darkens. But for the
[1:01:52] Christian the spiritual
[1:01:55] angle when you receive the word out of
[1:01:58] the world will come the life out of that
[1:02:02] life will come light in your soul in
[1:02:06] your natural body there's
[1:02:09] light in your spiritual
[1:02:13] body there's light of the world you are
[1:02:17] the light of the world that follows
[1:02:21] shall not walk in darkness but shall
[1:02:23] have the light of life at even time
[1:02:28] shall be
[1:02:29] light Malachi 4 and you have received
[1:02:33] the
[1:02:34] light
[1:02:37] gospel and Jesus said if your eye be
[1:02:41] single
[1:02:42] the the light in you glorious glorious
[1:02:46] but if your eye is a double eye
[1:02:50] If your eye is a double eye, then your
[1:02:52] light will be
[1:02:54] darkness. So the light in
[1:02:57] you that comes from the word is the
[1:03:00] light of the word
[1:03:03] which comes from Jesus Christ the
[1:03:05] word and that life gives you a
[1:03:08] life. the life of Jesus Christ. And
[1:03:12] that's why he said at a given time, it
[1:03:16] shall be light, it shall be light, but
[1:03:20] at a given time, the path to glory, you
[1:03:24] will surely
[1:03:25] find the light of life is the light of
[1:03:29] the world. When it shines all around
[1:03:32] you, it pushes back the power of
[1:03:35] darkness.
[1:03:37] And that's what we are doing in this
[1:03:38] convention.
[1:03:40] We know we got the light of the
[1:03:44] gospel of Malachi first message. It
[1:03:47] comes from the pure
[1:03:48] word that gives the
[1:03:51] life the life of Jesus Christ and out of
[1:03:54] that life. The prophet spoke the
[1:03:58] word that light of the
[1:04:00] world pushes demons
[1:04:03] back and as we are speaking the
[1:04:06] word pushing demons back.
[1:04:11] shall not walk in
[1:04:14] darkness. You got to go to church.
[1:04:18] I don't care how tired you
[1:04:19] are. Can you go to church?
[1:04:23] What you want to make
[1:04:24] sure if you are hearing the word in your
[1:04:28] church and brother Raymond
[1:04:30] preach coming to church. You got to go
[1:04:34] to church. When you go to church, the
[1:04:37] light of
[1:04:39] life is hanging around you. You shall
[1:04:42] not walk in
[1:04:43] darkness. No devil, your spirit will be
[1:04:48] able to stand when you have the light of
[1:04:51] life hanging around you.
[1:04:54] You may be seated.
[1:05:09] Glory.
[1:05:15] I want to follow after my
[1:05:17] brothers and encourage you. There is no
[1:05:21] condemnation. You are
[1:05:23] special. The devil's cheating you
[1:05:27] because you he lets you use your
[1:05:31] eyes and you
[1:05:34] disbelieve what God made you.
[1:05:37] You are too much for Satan.
[1:05:40] Between you and
[1:05:42] Satan, between you and Satan is a
[1:05:45] mismatch.
[1:05:47] The devil is no equal.
[1:05:53] is no equal because you got
[1:05:56] seniority over
[1:05:58] Satan. You were there when he
[1:06:02] was there when he was cast out of
[1:06:06] heaven. He tried that nonsense before
[1:06:08] with
[1:06:09] you. But he could not do
[1:06:12] it. Kicked him out of
[1:06:15] heaven because in him is
[1:06:18] darkness. Our father is the father of
[1:06:20] light.
[1:06:24] There's no darkness at
[1:06:26] all. So
[1:06:28] darkness in
[1:06:30] heaven the devil out of
[1:06:33] heaven. And that's why when you come to
[1:06:35] church when you hear the
[1:06:38] word atmosphere around
[1:06:41] you can do anything. You feel a
[1:06:45] deliverance. You feel every problem.
[1:06:50] Feel every disease can be conquered when
[1:06:53] you are hearing the anointed
[1:06:56] word in church. Don't you feel that
[1:07:00] way? You know why? He that walks after
[1:07:04] me. You shall not walk in
[1:07:07] darkness. Jesus
[1:07:09] Christ
[1:07:12] back darkness from around you. pushing
[1:07:16] back your darkness.
[1:07:24] Hallelujah.
[1:07:35] Glory.
[1:07:43] But what happens
[1:07:45] When you leave church,
[1:07:48] instead of taking the atmosphere with
[1:07:50] you where the darkness recognizes the
[1:07:56] light because light always pushes the
[1:07:59] darkness
[1:08:02] back. That's why every walk of
[1:08:06] darkness, you just feel what's wrong
[1:08:09] with me. I can overcome this sin.
[1:08:12] I can get this disease out of the way. I
[1:08:15] can get this challenge solved. But when
[1:08:18] you go out of church many times, you get
[1:08:21] right back into that old
[1:08:24] atmosphere and attack surrounds you
[1:08:27] again and you start
[1:08:29] doubting and you can't hold on to your
[1:08:32] victory because you left the
[1:08:35] atmosphere and Jesus said, "He that
[1:08:38] follows me shall not walk in darkness.
[1:08:42] And so here we are this evening
[1:08:44] over this weekend. We are destroying
[1:08:48] every work of darkness.
[1:08:50] And you shall you shall you shall every
[1:08:55] one of you, every man, every woman,
[1:08:59] every boy and girl, you shall not walk
[1:09:01] in darkness, but you shall have the
[1:09:04] light of
[1:09:05] life around you because you are the
[1:09:08] light of the world.
[1:09:10] sat on a
[1:09:11] hill not be healed.
[1:09:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:20] Hallelujah.
[1:09:24] So Malachi
[1:09:25] 4 this light,
[1:09:28] this glorious light glorious from Amen.
[1:09:33] from 1946
[1:09:35] thereabouts. He wanted to be with the
[1:09:37] Lord.
[1:09:40] But this
[1:09:41] light is coming from the
[1:09:43] word. From the
[1:09:45] word from from the word comes the life.
[1:09:50] From the life comes the
[1:09:52] light. And this light is the light. This
[1:09:57] life, this word was made flesh that
[1:10:00] dwelt among us. That's the life. The
[1:10:04] word in flesh. That's the life. And out
[1:10:07] of that life,
[1:10:09] will come the light. What is the light?
[1:10:13] The glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:10:17] father. Let me read you a quote from
[1:10:19] Malachi 4.
[1:10:21] Glory.
[1:10:35] Let me go this here. Now we are made up
[1:10:38] of light meters instead of us cosmic
[1:10:41] light. Now that cosmic light is a is a
[1:10:44] light that they can take an X-ray
[1:10:47] with. The X-ray doesn't the X-ray
[1:10:49] doesn't come from the X-ray
[1:10:52] light. It comes from your own
[1:10:57] light. Amen. Amen. So the X-ray machine
[1:11:00] just picks up areas of
[1:11:02] light and areas of darkness.
[1:11:08] They see that
[1:11:09] a disease
[1:11:12] area that is setting in
[1:11:14] there. When you look at the when you
[1:11:16] look at the negative of the X-ray
[1:11:18] machine, the disease area looks like
[1:11:22] white area looks like dark. Well, that's
[1:11:25] the negative. When you translate to the
[1:11:27] positive, negative. The disease area
[1:11:30] looks dark
[1:11:32] and the good area looks
[1:11:34] white. Cosmic light
[1:11:38] on the inside of
[1:11:39] you. The baby is born right.
[1:11:43] All his organs are
[1:11:45] perfect and that's white light that
[1:11:49] baby. You take an X-ray if you can.
[1:11:53] light but as is set
[1:11:56] in the darkness comes in.
[1:12:00] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Watch for
[1:12:04] swinging to the spiritual. Are you
[1:12:05] following me? Are you following me? I'm
[1:12:09] not making it too complicated for you.
[1:12:13] Amen.
[1:12:15] All right. And when if that now if that
[1:12:20] cosmic light say
[1:12:22] could be pushed to a
[1:12:24] place to where it's not cosmic
[1:12:28] light but eternal
[1:12:31] light that eternal light come from the
[1:12:34] word comes from the life comes from the
[1:12:39] light so that eternal
[1:12:42] light that cosmic light could be pushed
[1:12:44] to a
[1:12:45] place where it's not cosmic light
[1:12:49] but eternal light
[1:12:53] could dwell supremely
[1:12:57] when that light is in you. God will
[1:13:00] dwell supremely in
[1:13:02] Europe to do our
[1:13:06] thinking to do I'm reading to do our
[1:13:08] thinking and you are seeing it to do our
[1:13:11] walking to do our talking then it's no
[1:13:15] longer the man.
[1:13:17] It's God in the man.
[1:13:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:25] All right.
[1:13:27] Now let's go down. Eternal
[1:13:30] life is the light of
[1:13:33] God that dwells in the man.
[1:13:36] In the being was the word. As of the
[1:13:39] word came life, eternal
[1:13:42] life eternal life. In the light,
[1:13:51] eternal
[1:13:52] life is the light of God that dwells in
[1:13:54] the man.
[1:13:56] And if he the man will yield to the
[1:13:58] spirit
[1:14:02] more that man becomes unman on sinner
[1:14:05] like
[1:14:08] becomes more godlike.
[1:14:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And you got the
[1:14:14] light in you. The light of God in you is
[1:14:16] a little
[1:14:18] that comes from the seed comes from the
[1:14:20] world. In that se is the
[1:14:23] life that the life of Jesus Christ. And
[1:14:26] in that sin that life is a light and
[1:14:31] that light is
[1:14:34] fixing to go from your
[1:14:36] soul over your
[1:14:39] spirit over your
[1:14:41] flesh and the word of
[1:14:43] God. The light of
[1:14:45] God in your
[1:14:48] flesh. The light of God's
[1:14:50] word hang in your
[1:14:53] flesh and all around
[1:14:55] you will be
[1:14:57] light and demons will see the light of
[1:15:01] the glory of
[1:15:05] God in their presence.
[1:15:08] How could the demons recognize brother
[1:15:10] Brandham? How could they recognize Jesus
[1:15:13] Christ? Paul Peter, James and John
[1:15:19] those demons
[1:15:21] there in
[1:15:23] you is pushing your demons
[1:15:26] back, those
[1:15:28] devils. So you'll be scared of no
[1:15:31] devil, no
[1:15:33] disease, no pain, no
[1:15:37] habit, the blood of the
[1:15:42] world to push those devils away from
[1:15:47] you. Glory, glory, glory,
[1:15:51] oh hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:15:55] Hallelujah. Here. Not long
[1:16:00] ago, they took an extra of a
[1:16:02] man for a sick man, readers just wrote
[1:16:06] it up and found a ray of light coming
[1:16:09] from one of the
[1:16:10] men. Not all of them, but one of the
[1:16:14] men's hands.
[1:16:16] area of
[1:16:17] light when they put a piece of lead so
[1:16:20] foil beneath
[1:16:22] it the man's hand. I guess you ready
[1:16:27] yourself and they find out there's a ray
[1:16:31] of
[1:16:32] light when this man
[1:16:34] sincerely wondering what they were
[1:16:37] doing put his hands upon a
[1:16:40] man earnest
[1:16:42] prayer. They was putting an X-ray the
[1:16:45] X-ray
[1:16:47] down light coming from his
[1:16:50] hand. God knew what he talked
[1:16:53] about. When he said, "Lay hands on the
[1:16:58] sick and they shall
[1:17:00] recover. The sick is
[1:17:03] darkness. The
[1:17:05] light." That's why we have got to
[1:17:08] wait. When the light of God's
[1:17:11] word saturates this
[1:17:14] being, you won't have to pray for the
[1:17:16] sick,
[1:17:18] the demons of
[1:17:20] darkness. Oh, recognize that
[1:17:23] light and
[1:17:25] darkness cannot coexist
[1:17:27] together because the light always pushes
[1:17:31] the darkness
[1:17:32] back always pushes the darkness
[1:17:35] back. No matter how little the light,
[1:17:39] always pushes the darkness back.
[1:17:42] Darkness always gives
[1:17:44] way to light.
[1:17:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory. Oh,
[1:17:51] glory. No wonder I said they shall lay
[1:17:53] hands on the sick and they
[1:17:55] recover. That's what he was speaking of.
[1:17:59] I want to see the
[1:18:00] church press into a
[1:18:03] place where it can come like God wants
[1:18:05] it to
[1:18:07] be. Where does God want you to
[1:18:09] be? That little light in your
[1:18:12] soul that has overcome the
[1:18:15] darkness of your little
[1:18:17] habits that come the
[1:18:19] darkness of your secret smoking
[1:18:23] habit overcome the
[1:18:25] darkness of your malice, your jealousy,
[1:18:29] your
[1:18:29] anger. It was you and me to come to a
[1:18:34] spot where light was
[1:18:38] shine through our souls over human
[1:18:42] spirit and overcome
[1:18:44] affection memory reasoning
[1:18:48] imagination. Lights in your flesh and
[1:18:51] you'll be light all
[1:18:53] around. When you walk around, you shall
[1:18:56] have the light of
[1:18:57] life. Out of your light, you will come
[1:19:00] life, eternal life, healing light. Oh,
[1:19:05] hallelujah. Demons will scream in the
[1:19:09] light. Demons will scream.
[1:19:13] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Glory.
[1:19:15] Glory. Glory. Glory. Amen. Amen. Glory.
[1:19:21] Then when God was made flesh,
[1:19:23] and became the
[1:19:25] Messiah. Then if he can yield
[1:19:28] ourselves to be the anointed like he
[1:19:32] was, we will become
[1:19:35] Messiahs, little
[1:19:37] lights. That's what the church is
[1:19:39] supposed to be, lights, little anointed
[1:19:43] ones, that's God's church.

[1:19:49] in darkness. For shall have the light of
[1:19:52] life. You have the light of
[1:19:55] life. Don't let the devil tell you
[1:19:58] anything of life overcome the
[1:20:01] darkness. And the light shineth in
[1:20:04] darkness. Darkness comprehends it not.
[1:20:07] Whatever
[1:20:09] darkness, light swallows it
[1:20:12] up. Oh hallelujah.

[1:20:49] the church ages.
[1:20:51] Sometimes it almost goes completely
[1:20:54] out, then it comes back again, God's
[1:20:57] anointed one, God's messiah
[1:21:01] church, if messiah means the anointed
[1:21:03] one and
[1:21:06] king, and if the church is anointed by
[1:21:08] the Messiah spirit,
[1:21:10] He becomes a

[1:30:13] lights or darkness. Hallelujah.
[1:30:17] Hallelujah. Glory. Glory.
[1:30:20] Brother, I feel like running through a
[1:30:21] troop. You are awesome. Tell yourself,
[1:30:24] "I am awesome.
[1:30:27] You are more awesome than you
[1:30:29] think. You are
[1:30:31] special. You are
[1:30:33] undefeable. Unbeatable.
[1:30:36] You are greater than darkness.

[1:31:09] Let it get a night time here and you
[1:31:12] come in here with a little
[1:31:13] light, a little candle
[1:31:17] light. When you bring that candle,
[1:31:20] before the candle, there was darkness
[1:31:22] there. That
[1:31:24] candle
[1:31:25] separates, the light will go
[1:31:28] through. You might be a little
[1:31:31] light, a little light. Darkness pushes
[1:31:34] back in your presence.
[1:31:38] Darkness pushes back. Darkness respects
[1:31:41] you. Darkness is scared of you. Darkness
[1:31:44] knows his
[1:31:46] master. Why? Because the light of the
[1:31:50] world Jesus Christ on the inside
[1:31:52] you have the light of

[1:32:39] light. When you have light, no matter
[1:32:42] the darkness, when you have light, you
[1:32:45] have some clarity to
[1:32:47] walkity. When you have light, you're not
[1:32:50] going to trip over this
[1:32:52] speaker. How little the
[1:32:54] light little light is evening time light
[1:32:59] in a day when it shall be neither light
[1:33:02] nor day. When nobody has had light, but
[1:33:06] at even time, there shall be light. The
[1:33:09] path to glory we will surely find. And
[1:33:13] we have found the path to
[1:33:16] glory. And that light has called us
[1:33:19] out. Hallelujah.
[1:33:24] Light. Oh, glory. You may be seated.

[1:33:57] message is a message of light
[1:34:00] because it comes from the father of
[1:34:02] light and in it is no darkness at
[1:34:08] all. There's no
[1:34:10] craftiness that these guys are trying to
[1:34:13] attribute to
[1:34:15] mach that's nothing but
[1:34:18] Satan. They shall come to their
[1:34:20] folly their folly will soon be made
[1:34:22] manifest.

[1:35:32] and the rest in front of
[1:35:33] them fell behind them, Israel was at the
[1:35:37] start of their journey of their process
[1:35:41] to the promised land. And they made a
[1:35:45] problem. And those guys, those mixed
[1:35:48] multitude who did not
[1:35:50] understand, there's a process. There's a
[1:35:53] journey. They started whailing.
[1:35:57] said perish. Is it because there are no

[1:41:35] churches, the pastor, the ministry there
[1:41:39] was to feed you, to nourish you with
[1:41:43] food, a seven cut menu,

[1:42:46] You are not going to go to that promised
[1:42:48] land.
[1:42:49] Unless you are nourished, unless you are
[1:42:51] fed, unless you are child trained, so
[1:42:55] you can build up behavior. So he can
[1:42:57] build up
[1:42:58] character. So he can build up the
[1:43:01] discipline of the man, the woman that's
[1:43:05] worthy of the promise, that's worthy of
[1:43:07] standing in the promised
[1:43:09] land. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:43:13] [Applause]
[1:43:16] Glory to God. So that's the process
[1:43:20] called out then
[1:43:22] nourished after nourished while you are
[1:43:25] being nourished there's a hope to live
[1:43:28] for you don't just come many in the
[1:43:32] message just all about Malachi 4 reveal
[1:43:37] mysteries that's true but Malachi 4 left
[1:43:41] in those
[1:43:42] mysteries promise
[1:43:44] the promise for the bride
[1:43:47] A promise of adoption. We promise
[1:43:49] adoption. A promise promise of the
[1:43:51] dynamics to your mechanics. A promise
[1:43:55] promise that you are going to manifest
[1:43:57] and display Jesus Christ in your
[1:44:01] generation. And that's going to be the
[1:44:03] even
[1:44:04] timeline through your flesh. Hallelujah.
[1:44:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:44:09] Say hallelujah somebody. Hallelujah.
[1:44:14] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:44:17] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. So these
[1:44:20] three steps
[1:44:22] is what it means to be called out.
[1:44:24] Israel was called out and while they
[1:44:28] were called out, God took care of them
[1:44:31] nourish their souls every
[1:44:33] day. Angel cake, heavenly
[1:44:37] manner. And in that heavenly
[1:44:40] manner with that they looked forward
[1:44:44] to the promised
[1:45:03] landm this food to give them strength.
[1:45:08] for their wilderness
[1:45:09] journey. They might end up in the
[1:45:11] promised
[1:45:12] land. They know they need a
[1:45:14] food. So take them through the
[1:45:17] wilderness. All the trials of the
[1:45:19] way, all the problems on the way, this
[1:45:23] food, build them up, get them the
[1:45:26] character
[1:45:28] to face those problems. And in facing
[1:45:31] those problems are being built up into
[1:45:34] the character into the man the
[1:45:38] woman the girl
[1:45:41] that will stand in the promised land and
[1:45:44] they're worthy of the promise.
[1:45:46] Oh hallelujah hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:45:51] Amen. Amen. So that's what means to be
[1:45:53] called out
[1:45:56] and these same three steps.
[1:45:59] Amen. Amen. Are principles that apply to
[1:46:03] almost any area of your
[1:46:06] life. Your home life, your marital life,
[1:46:10] your school life, your work life, your
[1:46:14] play life because all of those things
[1:46:17] must go through the same
[1:46:19] process. Let me give you an example. Let
[1:46:22] me give you an example. Amen. In your
[1:46:25] work
[1:46:26] life, you get chosen for the job. You go
[1:46:29] for an interview and they pick you out
[1:46:32] of so
[1:46:33] many. You are called out of so many to
[1:46:36] be the one chosen to do the
[1:46:38] job. So what's next? I got a job now.
[1:46:42] Great. If that's your vision on the job,
[1:46:46] you will lose that job very
[1:46:47] soon. You will be stagnant.
[1:46:51] You will not move. But when you come
[1:46:53] when you come on that job, you look for
[1:46:56] the
[1:46:56] nourishment, all the nourishment you
[1:46:58] need to be able to operate effectively
[1:47:01] on that
[1:47:01] job, all the nourishment you need to be
[1:47:05] able to be the best to be on that job.
[1:47:09] You look for all the
[1:47:10] articles, all the trainings you need,
[1:47:14] internal trainings, external
[1:47:17] trainings to be able to perform well on
[1:47:19] your job. You are nourishing
[1:47:22] yourself to be the best on this job that
[1:47:25] you can
[1:47:26] be. That's what Israel was doing. Every
[1:47:30] day angel
[1:47:33] cake. Mana came from heaven to nourish
[1:47:37] them to build them up to mold them into
[1:47:42] the character of people worthy to
[1:47:45] continue this match.
[1:47:47] Not your job. What are you eating for?
[1:47:51] What are you being nourished on the job
[1:47:53] for? What are you trying to be good at
[1:47:55] your job
[1:47:56] for? Because you have your eyes
[1:47:59] shut on the future. You want to be
[1:48:02] promoted to a higher level if possible.
[1:48:07] You want to be the CEO of the
[1:48:10] company on the natural job. You are
[1:48:13] called out. You are
[1:48:15] nourished. You are tutored. You go
[1:48:18] through
[1:48:19] trainings. I have a promise to live for.
[1:48:22] If you do this job well,
[1:48:25] you will become a manager. A manager, a
[1:48:29] vice president, president of the
[1:48:31] company, president of the company. Let
[1:48:32] me give you another example. In your
[1:48:35] marriage, you love that girl. You meet
[1:48:38] her. You call her out. She agrees to be
[1:48:42] your
[1:48:44] wife. She agrees to be your your wife.
[1:48:47] She's called out. You are called out.
[1:48:50] What happens next? You nourish the
[1:48:54] relationship. You nourish the
[1:48:56] relationship to be the
[1:48:59] best boy. You can be the best girl in
[1:49:02] that relationship. What are you looking
[1:49:05] for? For the marriage. So your marriage
[1:49:09] will be able to be the best. You don't
[1:49:11] want to get
[1:49:13] engaged and you are that nasty
[1:49:15] boy. You say,
[1:49:17] "Pastor, I'm not sure I can go on with
[1:49:21] this. When you get engaged, when you get
[1:49:24] called out, you are nourishing that
[1:49:28] relationship. You are taking care of
[1:49:30] her. She's taking care of you. You can't
[1:49:33] wait for that marriage
[1:49:35] date you're living
[1:49:38] for. When you get married,
[1:49:41] marriage called out, you are now husband
[1:49:44] and wife. What do you do? You nourish
[1:49:48] that relationship. Husband and wife, you
[1:49:51] have been called out now. You have your
[1:49:53] home. You are called out as husband and
[1:49:56] wife. You are nourishing your
[1:49:59] relationship. You honor her. She honors
[1:50:02] you. You love and cherish her. She loves
[1:50:06] and cherishes you. forsaking all
[1:50:09] others. Forsaking all others, escaping
[1:50:12] and sticking to
[1:50:14] you. So long as you both shall live.
[1:50:18] What are you doing that for? For your
[1:50:21] promise, you are going to become
[1:50:23] parents so that your children are born
[1:50:28] to a home of law into a home of
[1:50:30] honor. These three steps affect every
[1:50:34] area of your life. These three steps
[1:50:38] only represent the process of life. If
[1:50:43] you get and get to that girl and not
[1:50:45] even show
[1:50:46] up, I just want to jump the
[1:50:49] process and marry her. You can get
[1:50:52] married. All right, but you won't have
[1:50:54] the greatest
[1:50:55] marriage. Once you marry, you cannot
[1:50:59] show up in the
[1:51:00] home. You are playing with the boys all
[1:51:02] the time. They want to get a great home.
[1:51:07] Do you understand what I'm saying? You
[1:51:09] get the point right? So you are you are
[1:51:11] called out,
[1:51:13] nourished, trained, tutored, children.
[1:51:18] That's what they promise to live for. So
[1:51:20] let's bring it down to our Christian
[1:51:21] world now. And I'm done. I'm closed.
[1:51:24] Maybe seated. Oh, glory.
[1:51:36] Glory. So you called
[1:51:39] out first message called you out and you
[1:51:43] in church in Ghana, in Nigeria, wherever
[1:51:48] you are at what is your job in that
[1:51:51] church? You come to church to be
[1:51:54] nourished. You come to church to be
[1:51:57] tutored. Come to church to be child
[1:51:59] trained. to be trained up into the
[1:52:02] stature of a perfect man to be trained
[1:52:06] up in Christian behavior
[1:52:09] and your behavior sets you up for
[1:52:12] adoption
[1:52:14] too many times a day you see Christians
[1:52:18] in the message it's almost like somebody
[1:52:21] forgot to tell
[1:52:23] us that your behavior has a lot to do
[1:52:26] with it
[1:52:28] we behave like rascals
[1:52:32] Once we are message
[1:52:34] people, we can leave
[1:52:36] anyhow and it's all right. No, it's not
[1:52:39] all right. The purpose we come to church
[1:52:42] for is to be tutored to be nourished,
[1:52:46] nourished by the word of the pulpit. And
[1:52:50] that's where the ministers come
[1:52:52] in. That's where Malachi first message
[1:52:54] comes
[1:52:55] in our first message. It's food stored.
[1:52:59] in the
[1:53:00] storehouse and the ministry is supposed
[1:53:03] to study the weak places of their
[1:53:07] people. Go to the
[1:53:09] storehouse and nourish their people
[1:53:12] against those diseases in their
[1:53:14] lives, those spiritual diseases, feed
[1:53:18] them with eagle food.
[1:53:23] Eagle
[1:53:24] food, nourish them, who strengthen them
[1:53:28] in the
[1:53:29] nourishment, training them to the
[1:53:32] behavior, how to live, how to walk, how
[1:53:37] to talk, how to comport themselves, how
[1:53:40] Christians behave themselves at school,
[1:53:44] at job, on the work, your Christian
[1:53:47] world, your Christian work, the work of
[1:53:51] a
[1:53:52] That's what the missions come for. We
[1:53:55] know how to behave
[1:53:56] ourselves, how to conduct ourselves into
[1:53:59] the image of Jesus Christ.
[1:54:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:54:21] Amen. Amen. Let me pass his notes here.
[1:54:23] I think you get the message. All right.
[1:54:26] So that's why
[1:54:28] ministry is so important
[1:54:30] of the ministry.
[1:54:33] Amen. Amen. Is God called
[1:54:39] men who know that they have been they
[1:54:42] have been placed
[1:54:45] in God's sheep.
[1:54:48] purchase of the blood Jesus Christ to
[1:54:50] feed them not with their own
[1:54:53] ideas. Feed them with eagle
[1:54:57] food for
[1:54:59] storehouse. And then number two,
[1:55:02] strength them for behavior for Christian
[1:55:06] living for character formation.
[1:55:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But in there,
[1:55:12] preach to them the promise of the
[1:55:15] future, they hope to live
[1:55:19] for it. And there's no promised land to
[1:55:22] go to. We just wind up in the promised
[1:55:25] land just going around
[1:55:27] and there's a promise to live
[1:55:30] for. There's a promised land to go
[1:55:33] to. We are not just hanging
[1:55:35] around. There's a promise hanging over
[1:55:37] us.
[1:55:39] And like Isaac, we are children of
[1:55:41] promise. And we live by the promises.
[1:55:45] Like like our father Abraham, he was
[1:55:48] called out of all of the Caldes.
[1:55:52] And when he was called out for 25 years,
[1:55:56] he was nourished. Amen. From El Shadai's
[1:55:59] best,
[1:56:04] I am El Shadai.
[1:56:06] And Abraham was nourished.
[1:56:08] for 25 years waiting on the promise
[1:56:13] from Elai's breast.
[1:56:15] The double- breasted one
[1:56:18] fed Abraham Abraham. The double breasted
[1:56:22] one of the Old Testament, the New
[1:56:25] Testament, the New Testament, the
[1:56:26] mechanics, the dynamics, Christian on
[1:56:29] the
[1:56:30] word of the Old Testament of the New
[1:56:33] Testament, of the word of the mechanics
[1:56:37] and the dynamics for 25 years. But
[1:56:41] also in there, Adam had a promise he was
[1:56:45] looking forward to, the promise of
[1:56:48] Isaac. And Isaac was going to come. And
[1:56:52] because of that nourishment,
[1:56:55] Abraham stagger not through
[1:56:59] unbelief. Every day was strong in faith.
[1:57:03] Give glory to
[1:57:05] God. Knowing I shall have Isaac.
[1:57:08] I shall have Isaac. The promise is
[1:57:10] coming. The promise is coming. It shall
[1:57:14] not fail. It's not going to fail.
[1:57:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. feel that way.
[1:57:20] The promise is not going to fail. And
[1:57:23] here we are waiting on the promise. We
[1:57:27] are being fed while we wait on the
[1:57:29] promise. We're not just here. There's a
[1:57:32] hope we are living for. There is hope.
[1:57:36] It's not
[1:57:37] ashamed. Let me close out here. Oh,
[1:57:41] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:57:44] Glory.
[1:57:47] Glory. Glory to God. Amen. Amen. So been
[1:57:52] fed and
[1:57:53] nourished. You're
[1:57:55] mature. You grow in
[1:57:57] grace. Maturing in
[1:58:00] grace and close fellowship with
[1:58:04] God with
[1:58:05] God with God. are getting built up daily
[1:58:10] into his character into his image into
[1:58:13] the man or woman boy and girl that's
[1:58:17] worthy to receive the promise.
[1:58:20] Amen. Amen.
[1:58:23] Child
[1:58:25] train are the seven thunders. The same
[1:58:28] message that called you
[1:58:29] out. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Been
[1:58:33] tutored trained. You are given this
[1:58:36] promise to live for.
[1:58:40] The promise gives you a reason to leave
[1:58:44] gives you something to look forward to
[1:58:45] every
[1:58:47] day. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why
[1:58:50] when people work on a
[1:58:51] job that there are no career
[1:58:54] [Music]
[1:58:59] prospects trying their best but there's
[1:59:02] no career
[1:59:04] path. They soon they get
[1:59:07] discouraged. Soon their productivity
[1:59:09] goes
[1:59:11] down. It puts a promise ahead of you. So
[1:59:15] we come to church. We read the Bibles.
[1:59:18] When fellowship with God, the character
[1:59:20] has been built up into the man and woman
[1:59:24] that's going to take that promise. The
[1:59:26] promise will live form. There's a
[1:59:28] promise ahead of us. And we're trying a
[1:59:30] promise Isaac was. Because of that
[1:59:33] promise, we wake up every day. Our
[1:59:36] promise is coming. Promise is coming.
[1:59:39] And that promise gives us strength.
[1:59:42] Gives us
[1:59:44] gives us the swagger to live.
[1:59:48] Hallelujah.
[1:59:50] The promise, the dynamics of your
[1:59:52] mechanics, the promise like Abraham had
[1:59:56] in Isaac. Shall your seed be
[1:59:59] called your seed in blessing. I will
[2:00:03] bless thee. Keep multiplying. I will
[2:00:06] multiply the Oh friends, you got to have
[2:00:10] a promise to
[2:00:11] live. You got to have a promise to live
[2:00:14] for. You got to have something ahead of
[2:00:16] you. To keep hope alive in
[2:00:20] you. Oh, you've got to have hope,
[2:00:23] friends. In the coming of the Lord, we
[2:00:26] are exalted.
[2:00:28] We are admonished to keep hope alive in
[2:00:32] the coming of the Lord. First
[2:00:34] Thessalonians 14, it says, "Sorrow
[2:00:37] not even as others which have no
[2:00:41] hope. His promise is a hope of a better
[2:00:45] tomorrow. His promise is a hope that the
[2:00:49] dynamics is going to
[2:00:50] come. His promise is a trust in God that
[2:00:55] he's going to send the dynamics. and our
[2:00:57] mechanics. This promise, that promise,
[2:01:00] amen, is a hope. Amen. Amen. Romans 5:5
[2:01:06] and hope make him not ashamed. This
[2:01:09] promise promise makes us not ashamed.
[2:01:12] We're not ashamed. I am not ashamed of
[2:01:14] the son of man. For his words, the son
[2:01:18] of man promises. The dynamics are
[2:01:20] coming. The dynamics are coming. I'm not
[2:01:23] ashamed of it. There's going to be a
[2:01:25] bride. There's going to be signs,
[2:01:28] wonders, miracles. I don't care how long
[2:01:30] it takes coming. You say, "Hope in me."
[2:01:35] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. 1
[2:01:37] Corinthians 13th, verse 13.
[2:01:41] Faith, hope, charity. These three are
[2:01:46] the greatest of these is charity. So
[2:01:49] this faith hope this hope is not hope.
[2:01:53] soul.
[2:01:55] Hope is stronger than faith. Hope
[2:01:59] this hope is a higher measure of
[2:02:02] faith. Faith is expectation.
[2:02:05] But this hope is expectation with
[2:02:09] pleasure. You are
[2:02:11] rejoicing. The promise is coming.
[2:02:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, make it not
[2:02:17] ashamed.
[2:02:19] What if it doesn't happen?
[2:02:22] But if it doesn't happen, it's going to
[2:02:24] happen. But if it doesn't happen, tell
[2:02:27] them I went down believing God and I'm
[2:02:31] going to come up again. I have that hope
[2:02:34] in my soul. That's how they went down.
[2:02:37] They went down believing the
[2:02:39] hope of the coming Messiah. Father went
[2:02:43] down believe in the hope of a dynamics
[2:02:46] of the bride that Jesus is going to come
[2:02:49] down and raise up the sleeping saints.
[2:02:53] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. 1 John 3
[2:02:57] verse two. He that have this hope in
[2:03:00] himself purified himself. There is hope.
[2:03:04] This hope is ahead of us and is keeping
[2:03:06] us pure because the same word that's
[2:03:10] forming character in us that's shaping
[2:03:12] us into the image of Jesus Christ. This
[2:03:16] hope is ahead of us. We are going to be
[2:03:19] like Jesus Christ and he that have this
[2:03:21] open himself purified
[2:03:24] himself pure.
[2:03:27] Hebrews 11.
[2:03:29] Amen. Amen.
[2:03:31] Now, present tense. Now, present tense
[2:03:35] today. Now, faith is the process. Now,
[2:03:39] faith is the substance of things hoped
[2:03:43] for, the evidence of things not
[2:03:46] seen, this process. Now, we're being
[2:03:50] nourished. Now, we have been trained.
[2:03:53] Now we are being fed from the
[2:03:56] storehouse.
[2:03:58] I hope from the dynamics.
[2:04:03] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Oh shout
[2:04:06] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:04:10] What is hope? Hope is a higher measure
[2:04:14] of faith.
[2:04:16] Hope is not hope. So may be
[2:04:20] so. has one of so many
[2:04:25] meanings
[2:04:30] has so many
[2:04:32] meanings with stronger
[2:04:34] faith expectation with
[2:04:37] pleasure is also maybe I don't
[2:04:41] know but in the Bible hope that make not
[2:04:46] ashamed is faith plus
[2:04:49] it's expectation plus pleasure
[2:04:54] the substance of what you are looking
[2:04:56] for. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. So
[2:05:00] hope while you are waiting in between
[2:05:03] time between your promise given to you
[2:05:08] nourishment and you taking the
[2:05:10] promise by
[2:05:12] hope by
[2:05:14] expectation. You are looking for it come
[2:05:18] any
[2:05:19] time. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:05:22] Tutored,
[2:05:24] child trained.
[2:05:26] The seventh on the faith is according to
[2:05:28] you. And that faith gives you a hope
[2:05:33] because that faith also gives you
[2:05:35] something, a promise to look form, a
[2:05:38] promise to look forward to, a promise of
[2:05:40] a better tomorrow, promise that all will
[2:05:43] be
[2:05:44] wellm. And thou make not
[2:05:46] ashamed because it shall come to pass.
[2:05:49] It shall not
[2:05:50] fail. Faith is the substance of things
[2:05:53] hoped for. The
[2:05:56] expectation of things not seen. Oh
[2:05:59] friends, I'm finished in all of life. We
[2:06:03] live by
[2:06:04] hope. We live by hope in
[2:06:08] school. You are hoping to go to the next
[2:06:12] class maybe. So there's a certainty. You
[2:06:16] just go through the process for your
[2:06:19] lectures, pass your exams, have a
[2:06:22] shorty, go to the next class, you go to
[2:06:25] medical school, you are hoping to become
[2:06:28] a doctor and go through the process.
[2:06:31] There's no hope. So maybe it's going to
[2:06:33] happen. It's going to happen. You are
[2:06:36] hoping you go through the process. I
[2:06:39] will come at a doctor. Hallelujah.
[2:06:41] Hallelujah. In all of life, we live by
[2:06:44] hope and hope. Make not ashamed. I'm not
[2:06:49] ashamed of the son of man by his words
[2:06:53] because they shall come to pass. Oh
[2:06:55] hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Oh
[2:06:57] hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. hoping,
[2:07:00] trusting,
[2:07:02] believing ever in your business. You
[2:07:06] live by hope of lives and errors. You
[2:07:10] live by hope.
[2:07:12] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Without hope
[2:07:14] in your life, that becomes
[2:07:17] meaningless. Oh, hallelujah. Hope
[2:07:21] because the human spirit thrives on
[2:07:23] hope. If you take hope from the human
[2:07:26] spirit,
[2:07:28] The human spirit dies.
[2:07:30] If you have nothing to live for
[2:07:32] tomorrow, becomes
[2:07:34] meaningless. That becomes hopeless. But
[2:07:37] God leaves us with a promise.
[2:07:40] A better tomorrow. There will be a
[2:07:42] dynamic mechanic. If you're not
[2:07:45] preaching that life becomes meaningless,
[2:07:49] there's going to be a prize. Don't you
[2:07:51] ever forget that. There's going to be a
[2:07:53] prize. I'm going to be better today.
[2:07:56] Amen. Better tomorrow than I am today.
[2:08:00] Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Oh
[2:08:02] hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. But when a
[2:08:04] people
[2:08:06] is bereft of hope
[2:08:09] is deprived of hope. When the spirit
[2:08:12] dies.
[2:08:15] When we bereft of hope. When hope is
[2:08:18] taken away from
[2:08:19] us. We have no promise to live for for
[2:08:23] tomorrow. We stop living.
[2:08:26] We just come to church and becomes just
[2:08:28] going through the
[2:08:30] motions. So the deacon won't come to
[2:08:32] your house.
[2:08:34] So the pastor won't say you are
[2:08:36] backsliding. But you just come to
[2:08:38] church, it loses
[2:08:40] meaning. So when you come to church, you
[2:08:43] understand. I want food for my soul
[2:08:46] today. And now my promise ahead of me.
[2:08:50] I'm going to be the
[2:08:52] Christ. Come see me. Simeon, he come
[2:08:55] into the temple every day. He come into
[2:08:59] the temple looking to see the Christ.
[2:09:02] Simeon's testimony was I shall see the
[2:09:04] Christ. I shall see the Christ. Is that
[2:09:08] your testimony?
[2:09:09] I shall see the Christ. I shall be
[2:09:12] adopted. I shall
[2:09:14] overcome every devil. I will overcome
[2:09:17] you. I'm going to live a Christian life.
[2:09:21] You can have hope.
[2:09:23] Make another shame.
[2:09:25] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Without
[2:09:27] hope, our spirit dies.
[2:09:30] Without hope, we let down the bars.
[2:09:34] Without hope, we let down our God.
[2:09:38] Without hope, we we
[2:09:41] backslide. Hope keeps us
[2:09:44] alive. Hope expectation with
[2:09:47] pleasureless.
[2:09:49] Hope of a brighter tomorrow. the mayor
[2:09:52] of the better tomorrow.
[2:09:54] No matter what the economy says,
[2:09:57] there's going to be a better tomorrow.
[2:10:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:10:02] Hallelujah. No matter decision at home,
[2:10:05] there's no decision at home. There's
[2:10:07] going to be a better
[2:10:08] tomorrow. No matter disruption in your
[2:10:11] husband, with your wife, it's going to
[2:10:13] be better tomorrow. Whether your son is
[2:10:16] in drugs or the world, I have hope,
[2:10:21] expectation. My son is coming back. God
[2:10:24] is coming back. I have Elohim's promise
[2:10:27] for them.
[2:10:28] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:10:32] Hope,
[2:10:34] expectation of a tomorrow
[2:10:37] filled with the
[2:10:39] fulfillment of all the promises
[2:10:41] of greater victories, of a brighter
[2:10:44] future. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh,
[2:10:47] hallelujah. Hallelujah. And so we have a
[2:10:50] hope
[2:10:51] today. Hope that makes them
[2:10:53] ashamed. We have a hope. Amen. That's
[2:10:57] fired. If I promise to live for
[2:11:03] wait to the seven
[2:11:05] thundersto their voices with that group
[2:11:08] as a group that can handle the world and
[2:11:11] the world will turn into the
[2:11:14] light of life in their
[2:11:16] souls and their flesh will come the
[2:11:20] glories of
[2:11:21] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Malachi 4
[2:11:24] said
[2:11:25] wait the seven thunders open the promise
[2:11:28] ahead of you putting hope in your
[2:11:31] soul thunders are going to thunder out.
[2:11:35] Amen to that bride. And there's going to
[2:11:37] be a bride who's going to jump out
[2:11:41] underneath the seventh seal of life.
[2:11:44] And out of their
[2:11:45] souls will come the light of life coming
[2:11:49] from the world of the seven thunders.
[2:11:52] And you are going to see a
[2:11:53] bride bride. You're going to see Isaac
[2:11:57] in this time here. Isaac, it shall be
[2:12:00] said,
[2:12:02] in Isaac shall thy seed be called,
[2:12:06] and thou Isaac Jesus Christ in your
[2:12:10] flesh. And you are going to have Isaac
[2:12:13] because you have the seed of
[2:12:15] Abraham and that seat in you as a
[2:12:18] promise hanging over it. Genesis 15.
[2:12:23] That's my contest scripture.
[2:12:25] I didn't get to read it.
[2:12:27] Abraham Abraham was
[2:12:30] told because you have done this thing,
[2:12:34] you have gone through this process
[2:12:36] and you have not denied my name, you
[2:12:39] have kept from me, your son, your only
[2:12:43] son, therefore I put the promise ahead
[2:12:46] of you and in blessing I will bless you
[2:12:51] in multiplying
[2:12:53] I will multiply
[2:12:57] Thy seed shall possess every get out of
[2:13:01] the enemy. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah.
[2:13:04] What is that? The word in your soul.
[2:13:08] Therefore it became what in your soul
[2:13:10] and spirit. In the beginning was the
[2:13:13] word was with God and him spirit became
[2:13:17] the word and the word made flesh and
[2:13:22] dwelt among us. And when the spirit
[2:13:25] anointed that word, that word in him,
[2:13:29] turn back into spirit again,
[2:13:32] and we beheld his
[2:13:34] glory, the glory as of the only begotten
[2:13:38] of the father. So that word in your soul
[2:13:43] is spirit. But before I became word,
[2:13:46] your spirit and now the dynamics to your
[2:13:51] mechanics is fixing is fixing is fixing
[2:13:56] to strike that word
[2:13:59] that word explode back into spirit
[2:14:02] again.
[2:14:06] And when that word explode back in the
[2:14:09] spirit, you are going to see the
[2:14:12] light. You can touch
[2:14:15] light only see light. And this light
[2:14:19] will be a
[2:14:20] demonstration of the Holy Spirit in your
[2:14:23] flesh, doing signs and wonders and
[2:14:27] miracles like Jesus did the early
[2:14:31] days in the garden of Eden.
[2:14:35] promised hands over you. Elohim swore
[2:14:39] with an
[2:14:40] oath. Abraham and you are Abraham
[2:14:45] seed and Elohim has
[2:14:47] sworn over that
[2:14:50] sitting in promise in blessing. I will
[2:14:55] bless
[2:14:56] you in
[2:14:58] multiplying. I will
[2:15:00] multiply my seed that sit in you.
[2:15:04] is going to receive the dynamics are
[2:15:06] going to be multiplied through faith
[2:15:09] into virtue. The knowledge, temperance,
[2:15:13] patience, holiness, holy guidance, and
[2:15:17] the seed will overshadow you with the
[2:15:21] light of
[2:15:22] life and that light will shine around
[2:15:24] you.
[2:15:26] the light in the time
[2:15:29] light holy spirit
[2:15:32] to bring Jesus back again.
