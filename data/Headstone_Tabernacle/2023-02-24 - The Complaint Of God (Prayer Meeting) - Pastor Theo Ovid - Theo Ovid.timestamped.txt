[11:34] welcome tonight
[11:36] and uh I finally a great privilege to be
[11:40] here they want to go to treatment of
[11:41] what we're going to share tonight
[11:43] no
[11:46] well the Brian said this in the token
[11:49] and Justin field every spiritual
[11:51] happening
[11:52] is a sign from God be careful notice
[11:56] that see what every spiritual happening
[12:00] everything that happens is a sign I
[12:03] don't know how much you have heard about
[12:05] this revival or spiritual weakness in
[12:08] this place called Ashbury in America
[12:11] where things February 8th University
[12:15] students had a service
[12:16] and afterwards it just didn't stop after
[12:20] 11 o'clock one of the guys ran out to
[12:22] one of the administrators at least
[12:24] something is happening
[12:26] uh apparently there was a move of the
[12:28] spirit of God that influenced the
[12:30] students to go to the altar and repent
[12:33] it started with some kind of conviction
[12:35] and repentance and that the prisoners of
[12:38] God move in and they they they are there
[12:41] up to now and um night after night is
[12:45] about two weeks since this so-called
[12:47] Revival has been going on
[12:49] and the city I understand is sociology
[12:51] as a place of about 6 000 people but
[12:54] they had over 50 000 and by now maybe I
[12:57] don't know what it is now but the time
[12:59] that I heard the data on it it will
[13:01] order over 50 000 people came in to that
[13:04] place to this great revive as well there
[13:06] was a great stream because another
[13:08] customer so many people but people come
[13:10] in the sea to watch the participate and
[13:12] so on like that so it's very interesting
[13:14] and I don't want you to be dismissal or
[13:17] something like this and says you know
[13:19] it's not of the Lord or what's that
[13:21] that's why I read that what I read just
[13:23] now there that every spiritual thing is
[13:24] the same it's a sign because it's a sign
[13:27] of what is to come they're going to work
[13:30] for the Bride of Jesus Christ that's
[13:32] what I believe and I will share with you
[13:34] of course if I'm all kind of cook some
[13:36] cranks and it will always have that
[13:38] around but that doesn't change the fact
[13:41] that there is something happening among
[13:43] these University students now one thing
[13:46] adults could play games and you know act
[13:48] on different endings but when it comes
[13:50] to like students and and young people
[13:54] and so on they tend to touch I've not
[13:57] touch base with reality they want a
[14:00] reality they don't want to foolishness
[14:02] they want something that is tangible to
[14:04] them this is supposed to be a Christian
[14:06] College uh uh and so on like that Asbury
[14:09] but it was brought to my attention
[14:11] something that balabana prayed in a
[14:13] message called
[14:15] scissors to Jesus he was saying Lord we
[14:18] pray it will start right here in
[14:19] Bloomington it's a Revival to see your
[14:21] great Supreme Revival he said Lord we
[14:23] pray it will start right in Bloomington
[14:25] we'll go Statewide and Nationwide Grant
[14:29] here in among these people that has
[14:33] assembled tonight in all these corporate
[14:35] and treaties that the power of God will
[14:37] be also manifested in their midst until
[14:40] they see and take new heart again Grant
[14:44] this college Lord so apparently this was
[14:46] in a college this is uh since we
[14:48] received Jesus Bloomington this is the
[14:51] ninth of
[14:52] uh April
[14:54] 1961 like every 1961. and he says um
[14:59] he said Grant this college Lord that has
[15:03] let us have this Auditorium that there
[15:05] will be a Revival breakout here like at
[15:08] Wheaton and Dong at Asbury and many of
[15:12] the other places it will be day and
[15:14] night prayer meeting Lord that people
[15:17] will come from the East to the West God
[15:20] give them an old-fashioned John Wesley
[15:23] Revival a burning Zeal of these young
[15:26] men's hearts that would leave the
[15:29] college here that they might go forth
[15:31] like another Asbury the granted father
[15:34] give us that Grace we dedicate Our Lives
[15:36] to thee and the services to thee and all
[15:39] that we have both mentally and
[15:41] physically speak to us father we pray in
[15:44] Jesus name now right now I know it's
[15:46] still live you know you have it on
[15:49] YouTube uh people have cameras there and
[15:51] still live people still go in they're
[15:53] still singing It's like a it's like a 24
[15:55] hours inspiration on the singing reading
[15:57] scriptures and different things but this
[15:59] is what I want to get through I want to
[16:00] point out 10 things
[16:03] this started suddenly
[16:05] two
[16:07] it went viral overnight
[16:09] three
[16:10] people came from everywhere
[16:12] for all testify about the atmosphere
[16:16] like but this year we need Revival now
[16:19] and I understand it is six it is spread
[16:21] into other universities seven we know
[16:24] Revival is possible
[16:25] eight we know Revival is promised nine
[16:29] we know revivals go out
[16:31] and ten I have that's what Paula Brown
[16:34] says when the power of this church Rises
[16:37] so friends it's very interesting what is
[16:39] happening now in the world today
[16:41] and anytime there's a spiritual
[16:43] awakening it means something is about to
[16:45] break okay so we want to just go in
[16:48] scriptures this tonight I will just
[16:49] background that I will go forward into
[16:51] the woods so tonight I want to read from
[16:54] Revelation chapter 3 14 to 20 Revelation
[16:57] 2 1 to 6 and Matthew 24 11 to 14 uh
[17:02] we're gonna read the scriptures tonight

[17:10] appreciate all of you making this effort
[17:13] to be here a minute praise the Lord

[17:24] true witness the beginning of the
[17:26] creation of God I know that works that I
[17:28] need a corner hot I would or that I
[17:30] would call the heart so then because the
[17:32] word lukewarm and things are cold or hot

[18:28] right these things that he that hold his
[18:31] established in his right hand walketh in
[18:33] the midst of the seven golden
[18:34] candlesticks I Know Thy Works in that
[18:37] labor and thy patients and how though
[18:40] can't not bear them which are evil and
[18:42] that was tried and would see the
[18:44] apostles and are not and has found them
[18:46] Alliance and I was born and has patience

[19:04] thee quickly and will remove their
[19:06] candlesticks open this priests except
[19:08] the return but this stuff has the door
[19:11] he tests the days of the nicolitans
[19:13] which I also heal final scripture from
[19:16] Matthew chapter 24 I read from 11 to 14
[19:19] verse 11 reads
[19:21] Matthew 24. and many false prophets
[19:25] shall rise and deceive many and because
[19:27] the iniquity shall abound the love of
[19:30] many shall back school
[19:32] he that shall endure unto the end the
[19:34] same shall be seated
[19:36] and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be
[19:38] preached in all the world for witness
[19:40] unto all nations and then the end shall
[19:43] come let's pray again father we thank
[19:44] you for the scriptures I pray that you
[19:47] Enlighten us tonight by Your Word by
[19:48] your spirit and she said we ask it amen
[19:50] and amen just remind you that February 8
[19:53] when they see the Revival broke out
[19:55] there in Ashbury spirit week and
[19:58] whatever they want to call it that is
[20:00] the same night but when the night that
[20:02] this message was preached verse 14 this
[20:05] Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached
[20:08] praise God I was that message at that
[20:10] time so I want to thank God for
[20:12] Wednesday night very Gideon he was a
[20:15] real blessed and refreshing and
[20:17] inspiring and I really appreciate amen
[20:20] it was like a living testimony that he
[20:22] gives praise the Lord like a living
[20:24] testimony you know it wasn't just like
[20:26] you know it was like a living testimony
[20:29] of his experience of having this
[20:32] headache and he shake it off and he
[20:34] presses weed and he plays music exhort
[20:38] the word of God and came out and play
[20:39] and all went well and I was blessed and
[20:42] I trust that you were blessed and you
[20:43] were inspired I like to see young men
[20:46] that have a passion for God and love God
[20:48] and want to do something for God and I
[20:50] certainly appreciate him God bless you
[20:51] but again praise the Lord amen okay so
[20:55] tonight
[20:56] I want to just export you for a few
[20:58] moments an Advertiser the complaint of
[21:01] God
[21:03] and it's a push
[21:05] to return to a full slow
[21:07] you're gonna listen to some testimonies
[21:09] from the people who went to this Asbury
[21:11] and one of the guys was really it was a
[21:13] blessing to hear it see this young man
[21:16] outside on like lawn Graf exhorting
[21:20] people about have you received the Holy
[21:22] Ghost since you believe and this is a
[21:24] promise and you have to get the Holy
[21:26] Ghost I said let's pray and he's praying
[21:28] for another category because that was so
[21:30] that was so thrilling to see that and to
[21:32] hear that because you know people don't
[21:34] talk much about getting this Holy Ghost
[21:36] and they hear a young guy on the
[21:38] University grounds talking about have
[21:40] you received on people's time of day old
[21:42] ones people come in visiting hearing him
[21:44] preaching in the corner that was just
[21:46] exciting for me so that was always good
[21:48] so this year about returning to who's
[21:52] love brother Brahman says
[21:54] you lost your full smile
[21:57] he says you can't get him to clap the
[21:59] hands I'm going to tambourine or Corner
[22:01] they just have to act like the world
[22:02] they have to dress like the world look
[22:04] like the world and the female television
[22:07] star they will stay home from Prime
[22:09] meeting and everything else to see it
[22:11] now if God had that against this church
[22:15] he's got it against that one too because
[22:17] you lost your first love I've got it
[22:19] against you this is a complete order you
[22:21] know we have complaints we have
[22:22] complained about family friends husband
[22:24] white girl this company Court of
[22:25] complaints and God of a complaint they
[22:28] say I have something against you you
[22:29] have lost your first love I have
[22:31] something against you that's my
[22:33] complaint you once had a great time but
[22:36] you let the world begin to creep in and
[22:38] you got to act in a little former so God
[22:42] is not for this formality thing he's not
[22:44] for this cold look on Delhi kind of
[22:47] thing you know you're stable in my name
[22:49] you're still doing the things that is
[22:51] right you got a lot of patience you'll
[22:53] label like a mule you live and work he
[22:56] said my you love Grace and Faith and
[22:58] Power
[22:59] to swap it for labor and works well I
[23:03] tell you brother Branham I help
[23:04] everybody can well that's a good thing I
[23:06] commend you for that but where's the
[23:08] love you once had
[23:09] it was the joy he used to have David
[23:12] said unto me oh Lord reported me the joy
[23:15] of my salvation where is them all night
[23:18] primitive tears on their cheeks my
[23:21] goodness the Bible even Dusty God cobits
[23:24] on it you read love stories and news and
[23:26] things and things that open to be
[23:27] allowed to be published to put out in
[23:29] the trash can with Pentecostal pick them
[23:32] up
[23:33] listen to this
[23:34] he said to understand this you must
[23:37] realize that the spirit is not speaking
[23:40] to the original sins of Ephesus alone
[23:42] this message is to the entire age which
[23:45] lasted about 120 years its message them
[23:48] is to all the generations in that path
[23:52] Now history keeps repeating itself in
[23:55] the generation of Israel we see Revival
[23:57] in one generation only to see the fires
[24:00] facing the next is the third generation
[24:02] Embers may be blowing slightly but in
[24:04] the fourth generation there will be no
[24:06] Vestige whatsoever of the original Flame
[24:10] then God likes the fire again and the
[24:12] same process is repeated it is simply
[24:15] the manifestation of the truth that God
[24:18] has no grandchildren salvation is not
[24:21] passed on by natural birth any more than
[24:23] there is any truth to Apostolic
[24:24] succession it isn't in the word you
[24:27] start out with truly born-again
[24:29] Believers and when the next Generation
[24:31] comes along they are no longer just
[24:33] playing Christians but they have taken
[24:36] the non-national needs and are now
[24:38] Baptist Methodist that is exactly what
[24:40] they do too they are not Christians you
[24:43] have to be born of the will of God not
[24:47] the will of man to be saved but these
[24:49] folks are all coming together by the
[24:51] will of man now I don't say that some of
[24:53] them aren't right with God The Proven
[24:55] desire to please God watch these words
[24:57] now the fruitful desire to peace going
[25:00] the passion to know his word the cry for
[25:03] reaching out in the spirit all begins to
[25:05] feed and instead of that the church been
[25:09] on fire with the fire of God in it
[25:10] that's cooled off and become a bit
[25:12] former
[25:14] now the reason that we could share these
[25:18] things is because
[25:19] that God promised a reviver
[25:23] and let me just read this here
[25:25] but I'm talking about the age that
[25:27] started at the 20th 20th century
[25:29] as it was to be the age in which the
[25:32] true church would return to being the
[25:35] bride she was of Pentecost We Know
[25:37] listen we know
[25:40] that there must of necessity be a return
[25:44] of dynamic power now you know what's
[25:47] shocking with me is how fast this thing
[25:49] spread how fast it hit the news how fast
[25:53] it was being talked on the internet and
[25:56] on social media and stuff we speed at
[25:59] which this this move one of these
[26:02] critics I call them he said what is this
[26:05] interviewing somebody what is this that
[26:06] is happening you could see it is
[26:09] something that is unknown something that
[26:11] is foreign to the new cycle and stuff
[26:14] and I could see where a genuine bride
[26:18] move the spirit of God would be
[26:20] something that out of the cycle of these
[26:23] false prophets and false manifestations
[26:25] and calls and false and false because
[26:28] God promised something genuine so what
[26:30] Abraham was seen here it was to be the
[26:33] age in which the true church would
[26:35] return to being the bride she was a
[26:37] Pentecost we knew that there must of
[26:40] necessity be a return to Dynamic power
[26:43] the believer sent this in their spirits
[26:46] and begin crying out to God for a new
[26:50] outpouring such as wars in the full
[26:52] century is it this happening again
[26:54] people sense in what about the break
[26:56] what seemed to be the answer came as
[27:00] many begin to speak in tongues and
[27:02] manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then
[27:04] believed that this was indeed the
[27:08] long-awaited restoration it was not
[27:10] October 1906 the good Pentecostal
[27:13] Revival right it was not for the later
[27:16] in which is the power that is promise
[27:18] which is the power people don't want to
[27:19] talk about they don't want to connect
[27:20] with the lettering can only come after
[27:24] the former Reign which is the spring or
[27:27] teaching ring the latter in Den is the
[27:30] Harvest rain how could this be the real
[27:33] thing when the teaching ring had not
[27:36] come
[27:36] the prophet messenger who was sent to
[27:40] teach the people until the hearts of the
[27:42] children back to the Pentecostal fathers
[27:44] had not yet come thus here we go what
[27:48] was thought to be the restoration and
[27:51] the final quickening under the Rapture
[27:53] had not come it was a mixture of the
[27:58] unrighteous partaking of spiritual
[28:02] blessings and manifesting in the Holy
[28:05] Ghost as we have kept pointing out to
[28:07] you
[28:08] in it so it had blessings manufacturing
[28:12] the Holy Ghost but in it also was devil
[28:15] power as men were under the control of
[28:19] devils yet no one seemed to realize it
[28:22] then to prove it was not real the real
[28:26] these people even before the second
[28:28] generation had appeared organized and
[28:32] wrote their unscriptural doctrines and
[28:34] build their own fences with every other
[28:36] group did ahead of them
[28:37] now what did the prophet talk about us
[28:40] he said we have the normal revivals we
[28:43] haven't had a real story no no no no no
[28:45] no no sir don't think we got revivals we
[28:47] haven't they got millions and millions
[28:50] and millions of Chief members but not a
[28:51] Revival nowhere the bride for tomorrow
[28:54] has another Revival yet see there'll be
[28:58] no Revival there no manifestation of God
[29:02] instead of bride yet we are looking for
[29:05] it one two it will take those seven
[29:08] unknown Thunders back there to wake up
[29:10] again three he will send it four he
[29:15] promised it and that is why it says this
[29:18] or we talk about Revival we're talking
[29:20] about it's a promise of God
[29:22] so brother Branham says you know that um
[29:25] okay the cool one is that to please God
[29:27] the passion to know his word the Christ
[29:30] reaching out in the spirit all begin to
[29:32] feed and instead of that church being on
[29:34] fire with the fire of God it has cooled
[29:37] off become a bit former and that is what
[29:39] was happening back dear to divisions
[29:41] they were getting a bit former the
[29:43] Abundant men to God was dying out and
[29:46] the people want to careful about what
[29:48] God taught of them as they begin to be
[29:50] careful but what the world for thought
[29:53] about now
[29:54] he says they were drifting that's what
[29:56] Ephesus mean drifting relaxed the cycle
[30:00] of Revival and death has never failed
[30:01] all you have to do is recall this last
[30:04] move of God in the spirit when men and
[30:06] women dressed by Christians went to
[30:07] church prayed all night took to the
[30:09] street corners wound ashamed of the
[30:11] manifestation of the spirit they left
[30:13] their old dead churches and worshiping
[30:15] homes in all store buildings they had
[30:17] reality but it wasn't too long a time
[30:20] until it began to get enough money to
[30:24] build five new churches but choir
[30:25] instead of singing unto God themselves
[30:27] they put guns and required they organize
[30:29] a movement ratted by man they took they
[30:32] soon begin to read books that weren't
[30:34] fit to read they let down the bars and
[30:35] goats came in took over there we go The
[30:39] Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the
[30:42] spirit was gone they kept one with form
[30:45] but the fire had died on and the
[30:48] Blackness of the ashes above all of us
[30:51] of course we realized that we are on the
[30:54] decline as far as I can see the
[30:56] historical ahead of us we are
[30:58] continually going on so every nation has
[31:00] to fall brother
[31:02] what we need tonight and what I'll do I
[31:05] will post this uh what we have in my
[31:07] notes here for you that you could read
[31:08] over yourself you can find the course
[31:09] you can read it to what we have here
[31:11] brother what we need tonight over the
[31:14] whole nation is an old-fashioned accent
[31:16] Revival and repentance here we go and
[31:20] this here is the key to January vinyl
[31:23] genuine Revival start with repentance
[31:25] people have to recognize they are wrong
[31:27] accordively
[31:29] it's not District right and that is
[31:30] wrong I can tell a brother recently I
[31:32] say what happened your church when you
[31:34] have one kind of believable
[31:38] who said that the prophet said that
[31:40] every Church of three kinds so it cannot
[31:42] be I chose that I did right you know
[31:44] foolishness that's all right every
[31:46] church has three kinds because what he
[31:49] got said so he said watch you see what
[31:51] we need it's an old-fashioned God
[31:53] temporary Bible and repentance for every
[31:56] Church
[31:57] and every individual to come back to God
[32:01] to the true and living God not the
[32:03] psychology not a theology
[32:06] what or of the church but what we need
[32:09] to come back to is the true and living
[32:11] God yet who changes the mind's heart
[32:14] changes his nature
[32:16] changes his makeup and makes him a new
[32:20] creature in Christ Jesus who kills all
[32:24] the nature of the world and makes a
[32:26] person a new creature is your Christian
[32:29] friend that's what the world needs
[32:31] tonight we don't need a program we need
[32:33] a regular program that Christ had a
[32:35] territory when he was here on Earth he
[32:37] said except I'm only born again he shall
[32:39] lose enter the kingdom what we need
[32:41] tonight we have got work on our program
[32:43] and everybody's soliciting and everybody
[32:44] he said brother the program lives right
[32:46] next to your heart Christ Jesus the holy
[32:49] spirit is trying to get into your heart
[32:51] as hard as he can and yet you shut him
[32:54] off
[32:55] listen to everything else beside the
[32:57] writing in court let the pocket of plix
[33:01] Point upon the nation business
[33:04] he says watch
[33:05] according to my we are we are the end
[33:08] right here the end time message here we
[33:11] go is to get the bride ready and prepare
[33:14] for the Rapture what can it do according
[33:16] to Malachi 4 is to bring them back to
[33:20] the feet that was once delivered to the
[33:22] Saints bring them back to the feet of
[33:24] the fathers here we go and this is how
[33:26] we identified
[33:28] bring them back to the feet of the
[33:30] fathers he said the Pentecostal part in
[33:33] the restoration time
[33:34] I will restore see of the Lord that's
[33:36] the real event in time evangelism so
[33:39] here we have ministers pastors teachers
[33:41] evangelists and everybody pumping
[33:42] Mysteries and Revelation and deep
[33:44] thoughts and all kind of stuff and
[33:46] things right and here he says bring them
[33:49] back to the feet of the fathers the
[33:51] Pentecostal path so in this message
[33:53] there is supposed to be a Pentecostal
[33:56] part that is Holy Spirit that is
[33:58] dynamics that is the power that's the
[34:01] equipment that's the final Awakening
[34:02] that's the lettering that's the
[34:03] Pentecostal part in the restoration of
[34:05] time
[34:06] I want a rapper
[34:08] Jesus ain't going to stand outside of
[34:11] your door unlock all the time
[34:13] there's a time when he will get enough
[34:15] and turn away
[34:16] then you will do the locket but you'll
[34:19] never find it come while there is time
[34:22] come while there's a luck don't you
[34:25] compromise with anything else and the
[34:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost like they got
[34:30] that Pentecost with the same type of
[34:32] water baptism and the same things back
[34:34] there
[34:35] everything okay
[34:37] acting composer so watch this here
[34:40] and sometimes I think about it I think
[34:41] about you going Ukraine winter time now
[34:44] you're fighting there's no think about
[34:46] this revival they have anything now it's
[34:48] very dear people going day and night I
[34:50] don't know what's going on with the
[34:51] students in the college and the
[34:53] teachings and what that but people pour
[34:54] in India they're singing It's like a
[34:56] permanent inspirational as far as I see
[34:58] this singing song and sing a song of
[35:00] worship and then jumping and carrying on
[35:02] but it's atmosphere that is carrying
[35:04] them through and here we are
[35:06] oh
[35:11] just can't be going through
[35:14] here it is something is pushing
[35:16] understand this it is real it is
[35:20] something that is promised it is it's
[35:22] important you expected it are you good
[35:26] piano
[35:27] so he said no you talk about and I want
[35:29] to close I wrap up here
[35:30] you talk about everything always hybrid
[35:33] the the hybrid corn he said we don't
[35:35] want nothing hybrid we want the genuine
[35:38] thing you haven't got to see the until
[35:40] it comes why accept a substitute when
[35:43] the Pentecostal sky is full of the real
[35:45] nothing hybrid he said you always have
[35:48] to spray a hybrid plant you can't keep
[35:50] the Box off it and that's the way some
[35:52] of these hybrid Christians you can't
[35:53] have to Baby them pet them promise them
[35:55] they'll be digging something else keep
[35:57] them some so they keep some really bugs
[35:59] off of them he said God here we go when
[36:02] he created his church he created a
[36:05] Pentecostal church that was the original
[36:06] not this dead seeing the amen no one
[36:10] again dry messaging no no no the
[36:12] original of the Pentecostal Church of
[36:14] Pentecostal church not denomination
[36:17] okay a Pentecostal Church filled with
[36:20] the Holy Ghost men and women led by the
[36:24] spirit of God but man couldn't leave
[36:26] that alone he wanted a hybrid a church
[36:28] he bred in the world with a theology
[36:31] denomination to make it a prettier
[36:33] church but it's different from the
[36:34] original Church we've got big buildings
[36:36] educated preachers the class of people
[36:37] if they watch polish up their
[36:40] scholarships and theology all the time
[36:41] taking them further away from God
[36:44] what foods what did he do he sent him in
[36:46] the upper room to wait there until the
[36:48] Holy Ghost Came Upon them to be ordained
[36:50] ministers of the Lord but I breeding
[36:53] bring the church to Theology and instead
[36:55] of letting the Holy Spirit leaded the
[36:57] bread and Bishops John overspears when
[37:00] the Holy Spirit is called Original
[37:01] leader of the church
[37:03] now let's take the tree our feet almost
[37:04] done let's take the tree of Fate that
[37:07] Eve taken of this forbidden tree of
[37:09] unbelief and watch Satan comedology she
[37:13] mixed it up and give it to Adam and it
[37:15] caused a hybrid fee see but I didn't
[37:16] talk about faith I talk about different
[37:18] stages and maturity and whatnot but
[37:20] there's also something called a hybrid
[37:21] feet and that's what the church has got
[37:23] today it's full country a hybrid feet it
[37:26] is liquid fears dogs frustrations it is
[37:29] if it was genuine Feast it would move
[37:31] when God's limiting it would be that way
[37:33] you see but she mixed it and that's the
[37:36] way people do it today they take what
[37:38] the Bible say and what Minds say you see
[37:40] that now that whole Library makes
[37:42] a hybrid feed when they do it makes a
[37:45] beautiful church but there's no life in
[37:46] it it's dead because of hybrid then he
[37:49] said these words I wish my words was
[37:52] wrote with an iron pen
[37:54] t with what God Said
[37:57] a truth hybrid feed says the read hip
[38:00] music level just by the scene yesterday
[38:01] and forever and then the hybrid field
[38:03] comes and say well in us 15 a week
[38:05] that's high good for you stay with the
[38:07] word
[38:08] he said what God sees stay with don't
[38:11] you interpreter with nothing I don't
[38:13] care what the bishop what he had Bishop
[38:14] what any man say stay right with that
[38:18] word
[38:18] oh my I get apart I'm gonna prove it
[38:23] wow yep
[38:25] foreign
[38:28] here we go he came to represent us
[38:32] before God
[38:34] sons and daughters
[38:36] and he sent
[38:37] his holy spirit now
[38:40] that he's brewing over the place
[38:42] trying to bring back to birth
[38:45] to
[38:47] die to ourselves
[38:49] it's a part it's the party
[38:51] to ourselves and be reborn again to be
[38:55] Sons and Daughters of God
[38:57] I think God of this world to believe
[38:59] God's word
[39:01] this is the part that is
[39:04] human
[39:06] lateral fleshly
[39:08] and our Ordinary People don't want to
[39:12] change
[39:13] they don't want to change and they're
[39:15] not seeing what they have to be changed
[39:16] too
[39:17] because change you can't just say I want
[39:19] to change or change your what
[39:21] you have to know what you're changing to
[39:23] is it giant ourselves to be reborn to be
[39:27] what sons and daughters either your
[39:30] father and mother represents you with
[39:31] Adam and Eve that's right when you were
[39:33] born in the world only were blocked it
[39:35] was ordained of God to bring children
[39:36] now you're right back to the same spot
[39:39] as in the government like the money from
[39:40] the doctors you're right back to two
[39:42] trees one of them was a tree of
[39:44] knowledge
[39:45] and the other was the Tree of Life
[39:47] he said man destroyed himself at the
[39:49] beginning
[39:50] separated himself from God from the
[39:52] fellowship by the tree of knowledge he
[39:55] left a tree of life to eat the tree of
[39:59] knowledge come away from that hybrid
[40:01] tree get over here into your original
[40:04] Fruit
[40:05] it's got life in it eat of him Jesus
[40:08] said I am the bread of life so friends
[40:11] there's a tree of knowledge tonight
[40:13] there's a tree of life
[40:15] that we have knowledge take the
[40:17] intellectual reading
[40:21] you know thinking about its side the
[40:24] Tree of Life takes one of this word and
[40:26] say I believe and they look for the rain
[40:28] to fall upon that seed of what they
[40:30] believe let's buy it heavenly father
[40:32] thank you to be here tonight and thank
[40:34] you for all those who Lord have heard
[40:37] what has been said and I pray and bless
[40:39] them Lord

[40:42] just think of a moving of your spirit
[40:45] and you are influencing the lives of
[40:47] young people in different places
[40:49] all by your grace
[40:51] and Lord your Prophet also prophesied
[40:53] that if the power of God is to come
[40:55] Among Us it wouldn't even be the prayer
[40:57] it will be the grace of God
[40:59] nobody expected what's going to happen
[41:00] that night that February 8th but it did
[41:04] and Justice as nobody could and yet we
[41:08] have the prophecies laying there that we
[41:10] can actually come on the expectation
[41:16] and
[41:19] the angel give your Prophet that
[41:22] scripture and it was praying in your
[41:24] closet that we call a toothbrush closet
