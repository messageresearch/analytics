[12:20] changing the clock is turning the clock
[12:22] of Prophecy the clock of time just over
[12:26] in Rwanda where 5,000 churches have been
[12:29] closed closed down in Nicaragua churches
[12:33] have been shut down and their property
[12:36] actually sealed and this is just a
[12:38] foraste a foreshadow of what is yet to
[12:40] come because the prophecy is that this
[12:44] type of people they will be shut down
[12:48] God we thank you for this great
[12:50] opportunity to be living in the time to
[12:52] see fulfillment of Prophecy Lord for the
[12:55] bride and for the world and we come
[12:58] together tonight
[12:59] to reassure to get reassured of the
[13:01] promises that you have made to us and to
[13:04] ask of you that you would come and
[13:06] confirm your word amongst us we thank
[13:08] you for your healing virtue and your
[13:09] strength towards all who were sick and
[13:12] you have touched Lord to kzia to Karen
[13:15] myself and all the others who have been
[13:19] attacked in some way or the other and
[13:21] Lord we have come true come through by
[13:22] your grace and by your mercy to fight
[13:25] this good fight of Fate may we not take
[13:27] things for granted Lord but may we we
[13:30] understand that this battle that we are
[13:32] in is not against flesh and blood but
[13:33] against principalities and powers and
[13:36] spiritual wickedness May each person
[13:38] here tonight be encouraged May each
[13:40] person here tonight be inspired as if
[13:43] you are dealing with them uh personally
[13:46] and individually not as a collective but
[13:50] as individuals wherever they are in
[13:52] their private room in their little room
[13:54] in their place of prayer anoint us
[13:56] tonight May the spirit of prayer and
[13:58] supplication come Among Us in a special
[14:00] way tonight that we could call upon you
[14:01] and ask of you in Jesus name you ask I
[14:05] ask it and father in meming as you told
[14:08] uh and Peter saw it when the Holy Ghost
[14:10] fell in cornelia's House of a truth God
[14:12] is no respector of persons so Bless the
[14:15] people here tonight in Jesus name I ask
[14:17] it amen and amen God bless you and
[14:20] welcome thanks for being here tonight
[14:24] and we consider this a great privilege
[14:27] this is the opportunity for us to to get
[14:30] a rope get a line that we could get an
[14:32] approach to God to call upon God we have
[14:36] all the days rest of days for ourselves
[14:39] most of the hours and time we give
[14:41] Caesar we give family and whatever it is
[14:43] the short time is to see how we could
[14:47] call upon the name of the Lord know
[14:48] tomorrow is a public holiday and we
[14:50] would see how things will go tonight
[14:53] amen you know my wife just shared
[14:55] something with me is so powerful that
[14:57] it's better
[14:59] to work with your children when they are
[15:01] small or like say for boys work with the
[15:05] boys and they're small than to try to
[15:08] fix broken men when they are adults and
[15:10] they are big the job is harder to repair
[15:13] and to fix broken men as opposed to work
[15:16] with these little guys who might be a
[15:18] little Troublesome running here want to
[15:20] settle down and stuff but as parents we
[15:23] have this tremendous opportunity to Mo
[15:25] lives they can only be m in when they
[15:28] are young when they are small all we get
[15:30] that opportunity to do some molding and
[15:32] I guess it's the same thing in church
[15:33] those are young in heart babes in Christ
[15:36] they get the opportunity to be molded
[15:38] when they miss a mark and they miss that
[15:41] balance later on you hear them talk
[15:43] about I know I'm in the bride I know
[15:44] I'll come back and they back for years
[15:47] and not come back nowhere they are
[15:49] broken they are messed up but tonight
[15:53] the bride have a Ministry that will go
[15:55] after the Lost not Eternal loss but the
[15:58] lost in this message there is a Ministry
[16:00] to those broken people some of them out
[16:02] there who are elected of God that God
[16:05] will anoint a bunch of people when they
[16:07] get to that spot and we are grateful
[16:09] tonight so tonight I have a scripture I
[16:12] can share with you from Matthew 7
[16:13] familiar scripture 78 and also from
[16:16] Jeremiah
[16:17] 33 verse3 Matthew 778 says ask it shall
[16:22] be given you seek and he shall find
[16:26] knock and it shall be open unto you
[16:29] and everyone that ask it receive it he
[16:32] that seeketh find it and to him that
[16:34] knock it it shall be open now I know we
[16:36] read the scripture before read it again
[16:38] but I hope that God shine a certain
[16:40] light in it
[16:41] tonight Jeremiah 33:3 call unto me
[16:45] that's my title tonight call unto me and
[16:48] I will answer thee and show thee Great
[16:50] and Mighty things which thou knowest not
[16:55] praise God and our last scripture I like
[16:56] to read is from Luke 6:2 speaking about
[17:00] Jesus it came to pass in those days that
[17:03] he went out into a mountain to pray and
[17:06] continued all night in prayer to God may
[17:11] God bless his word brother
[17:14] BR we are just looking forward for a
[17:16] great time in the Lord and with your
[17:19] prayers I'm sure that we will do the
[17:21] best we can for the glory of God prayer
[17:25] changes things prayer changes Deb to
[17:28] life life prayer changes sickness to
[17:31] health changes Sinners to Saints it is
[17:35] prayer you may laugh too much you may
[17:39] shout too much you may eat too much but
[17:43] you will never pray too much the Bible
[17:46] said I would that man pray everywhere
[17:50] lifting up holy hands so you will never
[17:53] be able to pray too much that's from a
[17:56] message called faith the 27th of April
[18:01] 1956 then another message he said
[18:03] friends you may laugh too much you may
[18:06] talk too much you may walk too much but
[18:10] you will never pray too much so I want
[18:14] to say tonight prayer you know people
[18:17] talk think about Ministry and who's
[18:20] pastor and Elder and Deacon and
[18:22] different offices and so on but prayer
[18:26] is one Ministry that you can
[18:30] exercise let me repeat that prayer is
[18:33] one Ministry that you can exercise and
[18:37] you can exercise that Ministry anytime
[18:40] you don't have to be a man to pray you
[18:43] don't have to be an officer to pray you
[18:45] don't have to be a Elder Deacon or
[18:47] whatever to pray it is a
[18:49] Ministry that you can exercise and you
[18:53] can have at at an exercise at any time
[18:58] so therefore
[18:59] for one of the most important thing you
[19:02] can do tonight to do as an individual is
[19:06] to humble yourself before God In
[19:10] Prayer um but Anthony s that without him
[19:13] I can't do nothing and the
[19:17] reason that this age is the way it is
[19:22] this age is the age where they say we
[19:25] have need of nothing in other words they
[19:29] say they are rich and they have need of
[19:31] nothing and they don't know they're poor
[19:33] and wretched this is the age of
[19:36] abundance the age of wealth the age of
[19:39] you know I was talking wife just there
[19:42] and thinking about I just a while ago
[19:45] before that cell phone had pages and
[19:47] when see somebody a pag that's a big
[19:48] thing could you imagine now somebody
[19:51] about Pages Pages the side of your belt
[19:54] it almost look like if that's caveman
[19:56] thing that's Bor Arrow um you with a
[19:59] page oh you have a page boy getting
[20:02] page that is so irrelevant
[20:06] now the children our children they know
[20:10] nothing uh the the the grandchildren and
[20:13] younger age they don't nothing about
[20:15] these phone you put coins and dial they
[20:18] know nothing about it that is ancient
[20:21] they don't know nothing about records
[20:23] about cassid players and so it's passed
[20:26] and it will never come again
[20:29] this age is fleeting this age is people
[20:32] dependent upon what the doctors say what
[20:35] the Medics say and they're taking it
[20:37] like if it's God say and they're doing
[20:39] things blindly and the thing of it is
[20:43] what science has presented to us is for
[20:46] us to have less faith in God and to
[20:49] trust science more if you see how things
[20:52] are unfolding they are challenging us to
[20:55] believe science to believe technology to
[20:57] believe medical breakthroughs and
[20:59] believe everything that man put his hand
[21:01] to and guess what the the what man is
[21:05] putting his hand to is the knowledge of
[21:07] Good and Evil it have good in it but
[21:09] have evil too it's not the power of God
[21:13] is not the revelation of God it is man
[21:15] at his best it is man as what he knows
[21:19] as his best just like in nimra time he
[21:21] got some great Revelation to to build a
[21:24] tower to go into heaven and and sing
[21:26] like Angel and come live like devils and
[21:28] God said this man is a dangerous man
[21:31] because they have one language whatever
[21:33] the purpose they could do they could do
[21:34] because see man was supposed to be God's
[21:36] of the earth man was supposed to be
[21:39] Achievers and yet the church is lulling
[21:41] and there are people who are stunted and
[21:43] people who are struggling to make step
[21:45] forward and this is where Jesus loosed a
[21:49] secret to us and I hope that we don't
[21:52] miss it tonight he said this not some
[21:55] Pastor say or some evangelist or some
[21:57] Apostle say he said ask it shall be
[22:00] given as a key you say seek and you
[22:03] shall find as a key this is Jesus
[22:05] speaking knock and the door shall be
[22:07] open as a key and we find out that the
[22:11] disciples seeing Jesus praying all night
[22:14] seeing Jesus pulling himself apart and
[22:17] aside to pray they recognize there is
[22:20] something about this praying thing and
[22:23] that what they saw in him because they
[22:26] couldn't ask what they didn't see they
[22:28] couldn't ask of him what they didn't
[22:30] know they couldn't ask of him what he
[22:32] didn't live they saw him living
[22:34] something praying something acting a
[22:37] certain way and that is how they came to
[22:39] this spot to say Lord teach us to
[22:43] pray because whatever he was doing they
[22:46] were not doing whatever he was doing
[22:49] they didn't know how to do it whatever
[22:51] he was doing it seemed like this was
[22:53] like a power source he was accessing
[22:56] through this asking and kn
[22:59] and seeking it is as if when he went to
[23:03] pray he got empowered he get got
[23:06] inspired he got the anointing he got
[23:09] something until they said teach us to
[23:12] pray and we know what Jesus did he
[23:14] taught his disciples to pray Our Father
[23:17] who art in heaven Hallowed be thy
[23:20] name he show where the father is he's
[23:23] not the mayor he's not the president
[23:25] he's not the Prime Minister he not an
[23:27] earth if we want his door he's in heaven
[23:30] and he deserves to be worshiped Hallowed
[23:33] be thy name our father is a king he is a
[23:36] kingdom thy kingdom come thy will be
[23:38] done on Earth as it is in heaven give us
[23:40] this day our daily bread we know to ask
[23:43] and so forth and lead us not into
[23:45] temptation and forgive us Lord as we
[23:47] forgive those who trespass against us so
[23:49] he put the brotherly kindness inside of
[23:50] there he put everything inside of you
[23:52] and rapital and say pray and that is
[23:55] what we want to seek tonight to see why
[23:57] would Jesus give this ask and it shall
[24:00] be given we could sit back and say you
[24:02] know God promised this and God spoke to
[24:04] the prophet and he said thus say the
[24:06] Lord this and does it mean we don't have
[24:07] to pray just sit down and
[24:09] wait does it mean we just get old G and
[24:12] die just waiting for God to do his thing
[24:16] while God is waiting on us to play our
[24:19] part ask it shall be given what the
[24:21] promises ask and it shall be given what
[24:24] what he promised in this Jesus told
[24:26] disciples to go to Upper Room and tar
[24:28] and then you'll get perform and high let
[24:30] me just continue
[24:31] quickly okay so
[24:35] therefore one of the greatest thing we
[24:36] could do right now is humble ourselves
[24:38] and intercede for one another pray one
[24:39] for another to enter into your secret
[24:42] closet and pray and you bring the things
[24:45] that trouble you before God bring the
[24:48] challenges you are struggling to
[24:49] overcome before God in that secret place
[24:52] ask him for help what you ask him for to
[24:55] remove in secret you can remove move
[24:58] those things in secret what you're
[24:59] asking for in secret he can deal with it
[25:03] in secret so one of the greatest things
[25:05] you can do is to pray for one another
[25:08] and a sister gave me a a powerful
[25:09] testimony I was two weeks ago we had a
[25:12] perer and something struck her and she
[25:14] begin to pray and I I'll share it with
[25:16] you tonight in a sequence she start to
[25:19] pray for the pastor then the ministry
[25:21] then the elders then the deacons the
[25:23] ushers the musician Tech Team song
[25:25] leaders car attendant Sunday school
[25:27] family
[25:29] and one by one as she see them seated in
[25:31] church and what she shared with me was
[25:34] that she couldn't run out of praying you
[25:37] know sometime people pray and afterward
[25:38] they they pray dry up like you pray for
[25:42] Tom Dick Harry and you know you pray for
[25:44] your family in Jesus name amen and
[25:46] you're ready ready to sleep but this
[25:49] approach that she took and it has held
[25:52] whether she doing this that she could
[25:55] always pray for somebody and is not
[25:57] praying
[25:59] well you're not you don't know this
[26:01] person or they're not close to you
[26:03] nothing like that just praying for them
[26:06] don't have to be emotionally connected
[26:07] to them but you're praying for this one
[26:10] praying for that one and afterwards you
[26:12] realize there's so much you don't even
[26:13] have time to pause to wait you could
[26:16] continue praying but brand almost done
[26:19] so I just want to share that with you to
[26:21] encourage you because this has been a
[26:22] real blessing and she that sister got a
[26:25] real breakthrough in taking a specific
[26:27] approach I remember one time telling you
[26:30] if you kind of run out look to see who
[26:32] online who is connected in the zoom
[26:34] meeting and begin to pray for them but
[26:36] this is a good idea also that you could
[26:38] you know meditate on the order of the
[26:40] church or whatever I begin to pray and
[26:42] you're saying bless this one Lord bless
[26:44] this one you know help this one help
[26:46] this one you're not seeing this one your
[26:47] liver and so on like that like God's
[26:49] grace but you said when a baby is
[26:52] dropped to the Earth from the mothers
[26:54] dropped as soon as the baby comes forth
[26:57] it doesn't start start crying the doctor
[27:00] of the Midwife will spank it it will
[27:02] give it a shock notice it is now she can
[27:06] be ever be so mean and cruel but just
[27:09] before the baby is born there's a
[27:12] certain kindness that sets in did you
[27:14] notice a mother when she's about to be
[27:16] mother there's something sweet about her
[27:19] she's always takes on that sweetness
[27:21] it's because that little angel that
[27:24] little spirit that little Messenger to
[27:26] this little Tabernacle is ready to come
[27:28] into the world so what he's saying when
[27:31] a child is about to be born there's a
[27:33] sweet spirit that comes around the
[27:35] mother because the body that little baby
[27:38] body is coming out and there's an
[27:41] Angelic Spirit ready to receive that
[27:44] body that Angelic spirit is what brings
[27:47] the atmosphere of sweetness around the
[27:49] mother and when this Angel comes into
[27:51] the body that's a little angel on the
[27:53] earth a spirit that is ordained of God
[27:58] to take this body so that is how the
[28:01] spanking comes in now and that Spirit
[28:04] slaps inside of there gets inside there
[28:06] and then the baby cries out all right
[28:09] watch this now he says now then that
[28:13] baby has to have a choice it makes its
[28:16] decision so when a child grows up God
[28:19] will confront that child with that
[28:22] decision now what is that Spirit atmosph
[28:24] you want to identify what is that
[28:26] sweetness that sweetness is what we will
[28:29] call today brotherly love the honey and
[28:32] brother Bram in message second Lord we
[28:34] familiar with it talking about cleaning
[28:36] because the coin is missing she had a
[28:38] house cleaning time she scub the floor
[28:40] She swept the walls she took down the
[28:41] cobwebs she kept on until she found what
[28:44] she had lost and when she did she called
[28:46] a little s sister churches to come now
[28:48] and I don't care if you a Methodist
[28:50] Baptist Pentecostal Presbyterian let us
[28:53] rejoy together then he prophesies when
[28:55] that time comes when the church is
[28:58] Bradly love when the church finds it
[29:01] holy decency when the church Finds Its
[29:03] place in Christ it will call to the
[29:05] other members of the body come and
[29:07] rejoice with us God wants the church to
[29:09] love him why would there be a need for
[29:12] the church to find brotherly love
[29:14] because it will be lost it will be
[29:16] something that is foreign they're going
[29:18] to church this saying amen hallelujah
[29:20] same book same tipes but a lot of
[29:22] bitterness anger Envy jealousy all kind
[29:24] of stuff inside of there and rotness now
[29:26] 1 John 418 says there is no fear in love
[29:30] but perfect love casted out fear because
[29:33] fear had torment hether fear it is not
[29:36] made perfect in love we love him because
[29:39] he first L us verse 19 verse 20 this the
[29:42] part we want to get to if a man say I
[29:43] love God I love God hallelujah I love
[29:47] the prophet I love I love his you know
[29:49] the message if a man say I love God and
[29:52] hated his brother he's a
[29:54] liar now we could polish that liar up
[29:58] but God says that man is a
[30:01] liar I love God and hate my brother he's
[30:06] a liar that's how God seen it not he the
[30:09] message not he in the front he he have a
[30:12] Pew or he don't miss service he that
[30:15] loveth not his brother here we go this
[30:18] is a test piece now he that loveth not
[30:20] his brother whom he had seen how can he
[30:23] love God whom he had not seen and this
[30:26] commandment have we from here
[30:28] that he who love God love his brother
[30:32] also so to me it's a a clean template
[30:36] that the love of God supposed to be able
[30:39] to be expressed by you loving your
[30:42] brother and if your brother is hungry or
[30:45] you could love him and speak the word
[30:47] only and say be
[30:50] filled that is not right so if you love
[30:54] him you would feed him if you love him
[30:56] he's naked you would clothe him if you
[30:58] love him you would help him if you love
[31:00] him if you love him it wouldn't say how
[31:02] you're going because you don't want say
[31:03] how you're going because he might say he
[31:05] had up and you don't want to hear that
[31:06] because you don't want to put your hand
[31:08] in your wallet to give him something to
[31:09] help
[31:10] him and you're talking about loving God
[31:14] God himself says if you love God you're
[31:17] supposed to love your brother also Jesus
[31:20] himself says by this shall all men know
[31:22] that you are my disciples when you have
[31:23] love one another this is not a gimmick
[31:25] this is not a phrase this have to become
[31:27] a
[31:29] life Jesus called all all the disciples
[31:32] tax collector this one that one
[31:34] fisherman and whatnot and he gathered
[31:36] all of them and even though they might
[31:37] have dislike one another and trouble
[31:39] some with each other they H say get
[31:41] along because that is what the new
[31:44] spirit is about the new spirit is not
[31:46] the Holy Spirit new heart new spirit new
[31:48] spirit is to people to get along with
[31:50] each other in preparation to receive
[31:52] holy spirit because Holy Spirit comes in
[31:56] to get us to do the will of God
[31:58] with your old heart and your old Spirit
[32:02] your blood can't take this one and you
[32:04] can't stand this one and you like this
[32:05] one and all kind of all that one thing
[32:08] you don't like and whatnot that is
[32:09] foolishness because God love that's why
[32:11] he call us each one of us and we can say
[32:14] God don't call this one don't call that
[32:15] one so if we accept that is God's love
[32:19] towards us then we have to begin to
[32:21] think different about our brother and
[32:22] sister are you getting me tonight all
[32:25] right all right let's continue
[32:31] he's talking about this and
[32:33] um in blus name you know the story he
[32:36] says
[32:37] now the message is being poured into the
[32:42] church I mean know the story the dream
[32:44] it was a box and the water was leaking
[32:47] through then he says no church could
[32:49] hold the message so when you hear a
[32:52] pastor saying that what he has no other
[32:55] church has it he's a liar when you hear
[32:58] when somebody said their church have it
[33:00] and the others don't have it and because
[33:02] he have the Revelation and the mystery
[33:04] and whatnot he is an anointed liar he's
[33:06] a man to run from and flee from this is
[33:09] it here now the message being poured
[33:12] into the church itself right and it was
[33:14] leaking right out this Tabernacle is not
[33:18] a holy ghost Tabernacle he's talking the
[33:20] building now there's no such a thing
[33:23] individuals that come into this church
[33:25] is Holy Ghost Tabernacles they are
[33:28] tacles that contain the Holy Ghost but
[33:30] not the church in a body a group
[33:33] therefore it runs out so any man in
[33:35] Trinidad out of Trinidad that identify
[33:38] or hints or try to imply that his group
[33:42] have it he's a liar he's false because
[33:45] he's saying clearly here that this
[33:48] Tabernacle not in the church or body or
[33:51] group it runs out this man who was
[33:54] pouring the water the messenger of the
[33:55] church pouring the messenger of the
[33:57] church what was the water doing it was
[33:59] boiling out the trash that was in it
[34:02] that is what the Holy Spirit does it
[34:03] boils it out so the holy spirit being
[34:06] poured out from this message into the
[34:07] churches was supposed to borrow the
[34:09] trash now here what happened next now
[34:12] the honey represent Brotherly Love
[34:15] brotherly kindness and this is the age I
[34:17] just got through telling you brotherly
[34:19] kindness is the age we live in Now
[34:21] understand this it's not Luther age or
[34:24] Wesley age this is our age because after
[34:27] ble can is what Holy Spirit as he slot
[34:30] there right so what you might say now
[34:32] look I sure like brother N I sure like
[34:35] brother Jones I don't like brother so
[34:37] and so something like that but just let
[34:39] something happen to him your heart is
[34:40] broke it just nearly kill you we can
[34:44] obtain brotherly kindness and feeling
[34:47] for one another but to maintain that in
[34:50] a group of people why do you care for
[34:52] that brother because you broke bread
[34:54] with him at the altar you fellowship
[34:56] with him you shook his hands you worship
[34:58] with him he's your brother and listen he
[35:01] might do something in the flesh that you
[35:03] would disagree with because you kind of
[35:06] stay what you oughtn't to do shunning a
[35:08] little but in the bottom of your heart
[35:10] if something happened to that brother it
[35:12] will just nearly kill you or that system
[35:15] I'm an old man I was once young and now
[35:17] I'm old I've seen it down through the
[35:19] age do that he people say I would have
[35:22] no more to do with him and something
[35:23] happened to that man it nearly kills him
[35:26] he thinks oh God and let my precious
[35:28] brother go without making friends with
[35:30] him you see his brotherly love it look
[35:33] like it won't stick but it does the
[35:36] honey it sticks and if one thing I want
[35:38] you to get tonight the honey do sticks
[35:41] second Peter 1:7 done and to brotherly
[35:43] andto godliness brotherly kindness andto
[35:46] brotherly kindness
[35:47] charity this what we quoted here from
[35:50] Jeremiah to3 he said call unto me and I
[35:55] will answer thee and show thee Great and
[35:57] Mighty things which thou knowest not now
[35:59] that in the Amplified says call to me
[36:01] and I will answer you and show you Great
[36:04] and Mighty things Fen in and hidden
[36:07] which you do not know do not distinguish
[36:09] and recognize and have knowledge of and
[36:12] understand and as we close I want to
[36:15] close with this here Ephesians 1 verse1
[36:18] 15 Paul speaking here wherefore I also I
[36:24] heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus
[36:27] and love unto all the saints so these
[36:29] were Believers that was in order these
[36:31] were the Believers that with hate and
[36:32] bitterness and so on he's talking about
[36:34] I heard up your Fai and the love of all
[36:37] the saints then Paul went on to say in
[36:39] verse 16 cease not to give thanks for
[36:42] you making mention of you in my prayers
[36:46] so you know Paul was a praying man right
[36:48] verse 17 here what he's praying for that
[36:51] the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the
[36:53] father of Glory may give you unto you
[36:57] what the spirit of wisdom and Revelation
[37:01] in the knowledge of
[37:02] him not intellectual talk not
[37:06] information not intellectual knowledge
[37:09] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in
[37:12] the knowledge of him 18 the eyes of your
[37:16] understanding being enlightened that you
[37:19] may know what is the hope of his calling
[37:23] what the riches of his glory of his
[37:25] inheritance and the Saints in other
[37:26] words Paul was was praying that they
[37:28] don't be dum
[37:30] dum they don't be baby
[37:32] Saints they have to be growing in Grace
[37:34] and knowledge verse 19 and what is the
[37:37] exceeding greatness of his power to us
[37:40] what who believe according to the
[37:41] working of his mighty power which he
[37:43] wrought in Christ when he raised him
[37:45] from the dead set him at his own right
[37:47] hand in Heavenly places far above
[37:49] principalities and powers and might and
[37:51] dominion and every name that is named
[37:53] not only in this world but also in that
[37:55] which is to come and had put all things
[37:58] under his feet and given to be head over
[38:00] all things to the church which is his
[38:02] body the fullness of him that fill in
[38:06] all in all as I close let me see this
[38:08] here so the
[38:10] disciples observing
[38:13] Jesus observing how he prayed observing
[38:16] how he had this great power they ask him
[38:20] teach us to
[38:22] pray and Jesus tell them ask and you
[38:27] shall rece
[38:28] receive seek and you shall find knock
[38:31] and the door shall be open so Jesus was
[38:35] urging them him that knock it him that
[38:37] ask it him that seeketh with a find not
[38:41] just one time but listen we have to also
[38:45] look for the Fine Line we have to look
[38:48] for what is beyond that you can't be in
[38:52] sin and pray you can't be have hate and
[38:55] pray you can't be in some kind of
[38:57] condition you have to
[38:59] repent and come out of the condition
[39:01] that you're in to get it right so with
[39:04] promises and God's words there's always
[39:07] conditions and when we meet them
[39:08] conditions it will come out right let's
[39:10] bow our heads heavenly father I thank
[39:12] you
[39:13] tonight for these things that I share
[39:16] with your people and may it find good
[39:18] ground Lord and may it grow may they
[39:21] accept your word to be true and that you
[39:23] are faithful if you said ask we shall
[39:26] receive then we could ask ask anything
[39:28] we could ask abundantly we could ask for
[39:31] big things and great things as long as
[39:34] our faith could believe that what we ask
[39:36] for it can be granted and Lord we want
[39:38] it to be according to your will bless
[39:40] them tonight as they get on in prayer
[39:42] may great faith arise in their heart to
[39:44] know that Jesus spoke to them by the
[39:47] word they don't need a tongues and
[39:49] interpretation to receive this this is
[39:51] Christ's own word ask it shall be given
[39:54] may they take it as price personally
[39:57] hold them that tonight ask it shall be
[40:00] given seek and you shall find knock and
[40:03] the door shall be open the ministry of
[40:05] prayer is here is a Ministry anyone can
[40:08] exercise it's a Ministry that belong to
[40:10] all of us may you so anoint your sons
[40:13] and daughters may they pray like never
[40:15] before may they pray for one another and
[40:17] share that love and show that love
[40:20] granted Lord in Jesus name I ask it amen
[40:22] and amen God bless you I trust in that
[40:25] these things will have been a help to
[40:26] you and a blessing to you let's start
[40:30] tonight let's start and seek the Lord
[40:33] with all our hearts God bless you praise
[40:35] the Lord so we get on in prayer right
[40:37] now
