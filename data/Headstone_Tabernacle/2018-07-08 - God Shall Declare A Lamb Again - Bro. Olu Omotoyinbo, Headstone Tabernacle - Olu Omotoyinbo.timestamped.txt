[57:55] opening batsman who can you don't want
[57:58] to get maybe the first ball he's bored

[58:06] some for some six hit the boundary a few
[58:09] times I'm gonna challenge like that on
[58:10] this team here but the channel on always
[58:12] had to like you know just grip the world
[58:15] and so it gives those of us coming

[1:03:42] preachers these brothers are but somehow
[1:03:45] it's my lot but the fume ones going to
[1:03:47] speak a little warts or a few words so I
[1:03:49] will try my best and I really feel sorry
[1:03:53] for me if you don't feel sorry for me I
[1:03:57] feel sorry for me amen well so I got a
[1:04:02] little title this morning God shall
[1:04:05] declare a lump again amen
[1:04:21] okay I'm trying to keep track of my time
[1:04:23] here so I don't hold you up too long so
[1:04:28] God shall declare lamb again and a
[1:04:30] little inspiration lamb for one house
[1:04:33] which of course but the fuels
[1:04:35] inspirational ease the inventor message
[1:04:39] is to apply the talking and we know the
[1:04:42] even ten messages brother branham's
[1:04:43] message that God sent to us through that
[1:04:46] great larger profit of Malachi 4ma now
[1:04:49] we call the message the event a message
[1:04:51] but the evening time message if you
[1:04:54] don't know what it is is to apply the
[1:04:56] talking and the main sense of trying the
[1:04:58] series of the services to like let us
[1:05:00] understand what it means to apply the
[1:05:02] talking and I'm going to carry on the
[1:05:04] same trend this morning and brother
[1:05:08] Branham said and he's been quoted back
[1:05:09] and forth so I don't really have to quit
[1:05:11] but maybe I just read to you but the
[1:05:13] velum said the talk and when you pray
[1:05:15] the talk in September 1st 1963 started
[1:05:17] talking when it came in the night and
[1:05:19] picked desperations he said the talking
[1:05:21] message this morning he said it was the
[1:05:22] highlight of my ministry is in terms of
[1:05:25] regular service preaching the message
[1:05:27] this money was the cap impact of my
[1:05:30] ministry the talking the caffeine pad
[1:05:33] amen let me just let me just get a quote
[1:05:37] for you from brother Branham here
[1:05:50] all right he said this morning the
[1:05:52] message this morning was to me the
[1:05:53] highlights measure of my internal
[1:05:54] ministry this morning she had mercy on
[1:05:57] my entire ministry
[1:05:58] some day I'll tell you how I come about
[1:06:00] and I know that everything has worked
[1:06:02] for months and months and months up to
[1:06:04] that one message
[1:06:05] moving up to come to that place that was
[1:06:07] the cap in of time of it you see and I'm
[1:06:11] sure I hope you get what the talking
[1:06:14] meant the talk is the sign that the
[1:06:18] blood has been applied now that the
[1:06:21] price has been asked require of God
[1:06:23] Jesus paid the price by shed his own
[1:06:26] blood he did that then from his life
[1:06:29] came the Holy Spirit and when the blood
[1:06:32] is applied to you the Holy Spirit
[1:06:35] talking that your price is paid God has
[1:06:38] received you and as the talking remember
[1:06:41] that is the talking now what is saying
[1:06:44] here is that God gives you the talking
[1:06:47] which is the Holy Spirit when you have
[1:06:51] applied the blood amen
[1:06:56] very simple very simple but you know too
[1:06:59] many times so many of these things
[1:07:01] become clichés tours we just say the
[1:07:03] things without really looking at what it
[1:07:05] means and if we just here's the world
[1:07:08] and you don't really apply it the Bible
[1:07:11] says if you hear the word and you don't
[1:07:14] apply it you are like a man who looks in
[1:07:15] the mirror and straightaway he forgets
[1:07:18] what he looks like so we look into the
[1:07:20] mirror of the world and see what it
[1:07:22] tells us are way cooler from there and I
[1:07:25] apply to our lives to let the word mix
[1:07:27] with our lives
[1:07:29] amen glory to God amen amen
[1:07:33] nice a product of 28 now this man I told
[1:07:35] you been not with you I thought we had
[1:07:37] another two or three our message this
[1:07:39] morning but I just got started and I
[1:07:42] thought I just carried that over for
[1:07:43] tonight but it was just such a menace I
[1:07:46] don't know what other people got it or
[1:07:48] not I hope the two every I hope they do
[1:07:52] everywhere and I hope there was some
[1:07:53] good tips on it so he can be carried out
[1:07:55] to be known that I believe it all the
[1:07:58] mister I ever brought that that that
[1:08:01] that
[1:08:02] solidly was ordained of God outside of a
[1:08:05] cause the regular Commission like the
[1:08:06] seven states and things that was
[1:08:08] directly the Word of God I'm talking
[1:08:11] about a message to preach I believe that
[1:08:14] one was it see the one that's needed to
[1:08:16] follow these seven seals
[1:08:19] now watch what's come after the seven
[1:08:22] seals that uniting of the people your
[1:08:25] Nana's signs red light flashing you know
[1:08:28] he said you know he said after the
[1:08:30] mysteries in the book of finished and
[1:08:32] finished all over then it's time for the
[1:08:35] cyst on the backside which is the seven
[1:08:38] thunders on the back of the book because
[1:08:40] Malachi fought the great and larger
[1:08:42] profit he had the authority the seven
[1:08:45] thunders and put them speaking for the
[1:08:47] back of the book in the world but it
[1:08:50] said when the inside with the mysteries
[1:08:53] are finished then it's time for the back
[1:08:56] side seven thunders so watch what is
[1:08:59] saying here he said now watch what's
[1:09:01] come after the seven seals the you none
[1:09:04] of the people united signs the red light
[1:09:06] flashing in the last days the son of the
[1:09:09] women getting prettier and man what they
[1:09:11] would do all these signs of the holy
[1:09:13] sprit leenock then come right back here
[1:09:16] to the capping off of all those messages
[1:09:19] in the seven seals is captive in this
[1:09:22] one thing the token that we are all
[1:09:25] right now put a better prick the token
[1:09:30] you can be sure you can you're talking I
[1:09:32] don't know it's all right is the right
[1:09:35] talking for the right Johnny at the
[1:09:37] right price you cannot make sure amen
[1:09:40] the talking that way all right see just
[1:09:44] check ourselves and see if we're in the
[1:09:47] faith a miracle it was a man in the
[1:09:51] Bible Jesus was called the Lamb of God
[1:09:54] when John saw him coming he said behold
[1:09:58] the lamb of God who takes away the sin
[1:10:01] of the world not the scenes of the world
[1:10:03] for the parent
[1:10:04] since the attributes of sin since a lion
[1:10:09] fornication and all that stuff those are
[1:10:12] attributes of sin but Sheen is unbelief
[1:10:15] so Jesus Christ the lamb came to picks
[1:10:19] in at its roots to get sin at its origin
[1:10:24] to uproot and root at unbelief that's
[1:10:28] why Jesus came
[1:10:29] behold the lamb of God which taketh away
[1:10:32] the sin of the roll glory to God a man
[1:10:35] when you see the lamp on the scene
[1:10:38] you're no redemption is taking place
[1:10:40] when you see the lamb in the picture
[1:10:42] you're no sin has made its master
[1:10:45] I said sin has met its master when you
[1:10:49] see the lamp of God on the sin Oh Lord
[1:10:53] oh god hallelujah amen glory the holy
[1:11:01] man so when the lamb comes in the
[1:11:04] picture you know right away it's time to
[1:11:08] be talking to yourself to be having a
[1:11:10] conversation see ugly as hell that sin
[1:11:12] has made its master seen as marriage
[1:11:15] Waterloo and to rejoice them to tense
[1:11:18] them to shout because you know the
[1:11:20] difference they're at the door the
[1:11:22] master is come and they call it for thee
[1:11:24] oh where are you here this morning
[1:11:28] you got some same problem because some
[1:11:31] pundits problem you can tell rejoice in
[1:11:33] the master is in the house master Jesus
[1:11:38] the great lamp of God is in the house
[1:11:44] behold the lamb of God we together with
[1:11:48] the scene of the world he will get your
[1:11:50] sin and it's very roots and root it out
[1:11:54] and set you free Morry
[1:12:00] Oh Laura don't call him an amen you know
[1:12:08] in the Bible when you see a lamb right
[1:12:12] down through the Bible when you see the
[1:12:14] lamb the animal the lamb is a 10 if our
[1:12:18] redemption every papal reader knows that
[1:12:20] but the bleeding blood lamb like we see
[1:12:24] in Revelation 5 that's the Redeemer
[1:12:26] because not just the lamp is the lamb
[1:12:28] that has shed his blood so the lamb
[1:12:31] represent redemption amen but the linen
[1:12:34] body lamb represents the Redeemer who
[1:12:37] are shed its blood but if people can be
[1:12:39] redeemed
[1:12:40] Oh hallelujah question why would God use
[1:12:48] the lamb and an email to the pure
[1:12:52] redemption why would God like many times
[1:12:54] use the lamb to the police children you
[1:12:57] and I why will God use even himself as a
[1:13:01] lamb behold the lamb of God which takes
[1:13:05] away the sin of the world very simple
[1:13:07] answer simply because this animal and
[1:13:12] though the critic treated it like every
[1:13:15] other sin equation but the animal of the
[1:13:17] lamb has the qualities that God expects
[1:13:22] to see in sons and daughters of God who
[1:13:26] are walking the road to redemption and
[1:13:28] that's why he uses the lamb as a symbol
[1:13:34] of redemption is the lamb as the article
[1:13:37] of redemption use the land to represent
[1:13:39] Redemption all the time that's why he
[1:13:41] call him stuff also the Lamb of God amen
[1:13:45] Oh glory to God a man I know the story
[1:13:51] another story is missing his nose
[1:13:54] already so crumb cake or sponge cake now
[1:13:59] animals I to fall bean you know that
[1:14:07] you know that's the amen Aya's don't
[1:14:10] have you all and we human beings that go
[1:14:15] use the redemption I mean they are the
[1:14:19] lamb to represent our Redemption we are
[1:14:22] three full beam we have a soul and the
[1:14:25] animal doesn't have a soul now there's a
[1:14:28] disconnect nation where all through the
[1:14:33] Old Testament years all through the
[1:14:35] course of many years from their sojourn
[1:14:37] in Egypt all the way to when they came
[1:14:39] out and God will reap our of them
[1:14:41] immemorial down through the years when
[1:14:44] they came out of Egypt the talking and
[1:14:46] in the assessment years in the
[1:14:49] wilderness years all around the world
[1:14:50] have the ceremony and every year they
[1:14:54] will come to the high priest and lay
[1:14:56] they bring their lamb
[1:14:57] leave their hand upon that lamb or he
[1:14:59] could or whatever and it would take it
[1:15:01] has seen away for one year and they'll
[1:15:03] come back again which we know the story
[1:15:05] what I'm going to show you something
[1:15:07] I want to show you something you know we
[1:15:16] know that the life of the lamp could not
[1:15:20] come back upon the believer the
[1:15:23] worshipper how many know that say Amen
[1:15:25] we know that so why will God do it when
[1:15:31] the life of the lamb could not come back
[1:15:32] simply because the lamb doesn't have a
[1:15:35] soul and we have a soul so where's the
[1:15:40] life the life can come from a spirit of
[1:15:41] the lamb into man's soul does it is
[1:15:44] connect there but God let versus happen
[1:15:47] to let you see there's a need for
[1:15:50] redeemer and this is just a substitute
[1:15:53] that we are gonna go to no pick+ gonna
[1:15:56] allow and accept and that alone lets you
[1:15:59] know there's a real thing to come in
[1:16:01] there's a real lamb coming down the road
[1:16:04] this is not the real am all those
[1:16:07] substituted autism and I'm not the real
[1:16:09] thing and there were only a super until
[1:16:11] the real lamb become a man the Lamb of
[1:16:14] God which takes away the sin of the
[1:16:15] world
[1:16:16] amen I want to follow up on the dealer
[1:16:22] and brother Peter so I'm all school but
[1:16:26] I feels trying to get me to a new school
[1:16:27] all these years and so I wonder can you
[1:16:33] give me the first pitch oh it's alright
[1:16:36] alright I do this once once before in
[1:16:39] about three years ago and some
[1:16:40] information Nigeria it feels good to or
[1:16:47] I take a look at this take a look at
[1:16:49] this an animal has a body and a spirit
[1:16:54] all animals have their own nature too
[1:16:57] just like you have your nature a lion is
[1:17:00] the king of the jungle it will grow back
[1:17:02] oh and every other animal will keep
[1:17:04] quiet and don't go back you know it
[1:17:09] could will do whatever they have the
[1:17:11] different nature's animals everybody and
[1:17:15] their spirit that's where the nature is
[1:17:18] controlled from because they have my
[1:17:21] soul but look at man that's you and I we
[1:17:25] have three compartments a body I mean a
[1:17:28] soul a spirit anybody for us our our
[1:17:35] nature is controlled from the soul and
[1:17:41] that's what the branch that the soul is
[1:17:44] the nature of the Spirit in other words
[1:17:47] the soul gives them give the spirit its
[1:17:51] nature so whatever nature you sure you
[1:17:54] have it's hiding somewhere in your soul
[1:17:57] that's the origin of the control center
[1:17:59] that gives you the attitude thing
[1:18:02] character whatever it is that you have
[1:18:04] is right in the soul is not the things
[1:18:07] that anti Amanda polluting man is the
[1:18:09] things that go from inside man to the
[1:18:11] outside are pollute him can you say Amen
[1:18:14] no God so here's the problem this animal
[1:18:24] here even though a seamless
[1:18:27] but it can transfer its spirit into
[1:18:31] men's so where men's nature's control
[1:18:35] from so all the two tools lay hand on
[1:18:39] your sacrifice identify your sacrifice
[1:18:42] and course is the innocent life of that
[1:18:44] lamb and forgive you for one whole year
[1:18:47] but because the lamb didn't have the
[1:18:49] power to transfer its own power to not
[1:18:53] sing to them they just go and I cannot
[1:18:57] show you right a few days after they
[1:18:58] were back doing the same things again
[1:19:01] back doing the same things again I'm
[1:19:05] just hoping that next year we'll go
[1:19:07] again and put a handle it was almost
[1:19:09] like a license to the scene there was no
[1:19:14] real labor and effort to like steal the
[1:19:17] tool that's why Israel so many times so
[1:19:20] many times
[1:19:22] Israel pursuing title Israel sinned
[1:19:24] Israel ditched off when Coe will punish
[1:19:27] them right after they'll go back again
[1:19:29] because the blood of bulls and goats did
[1:19:32] not have power to take over to take else
[1:19:34] in and so their men perpetually sinners
[1:19:37] can you say man and thus I was in the
[1:19:41] Old Testament years and anybody and
[1:19:44] everybody knew this cannot be the
[1:19:46] prophet pattern no it can be this was
[1:19:50] just a substitute amen to just show they
[1:19:52] had a clear conscience they don't want
[1:19:54] to do wrong and God will increase
[1:19:56] forgive them that's how it was
[1:19:58] amen onto the Lamb of God Jesus Christ
[1:20:00] came but why Israel Wow will they not be
[1:20:05] able to do the right even though they
[1:20:08] know what is the right thing to do why
[1:20:11] don't they do the right thing what I
[1:20:13] want you and I to the wrath and even
[1:20:14] though we know they were thing to do
[1:20:16] that's why the talking come class while
[1:20:19] the talking come behold the lamb of God
[1:20:22] which takes away the scene of the wall
[1:20:24] it comes to you today comes to you
[1:20:26] tomorrow come see wherever you are to
[1:20:28] take care of the same problem
[1:20:30] I'm not talking about being the message
[1:20:32] I'm talking about this same problem
[1:20:34] being taken care of because Israel know
[1:20:37] what was the right to do but they could
[1:20:40] not do it
[1:20:40] so it's not it is not knowing the right
[1:20:43] thing to do
[1:20:44] it is not knowing the message is the
[1:20:48] power to leave about the scene that's
[1:20:52] what we are talking about that's what
[1:20:54] the talking is about the swapper Roberto
[1:20:56] preached Redemption by blood and by
[1:20:58] power oh you know why Israel could not
[1:21:13] even though the new could not leave
[1:21:15] above the wrong and they say you know
[1:21:17] why the emotions the emotions università
[1:21:24] for image crumb cake
[1:21:35] thank you I know you're trying to make
[1:21:37] me feel good you are very kind of very
[1:21:39] lovely all right
[1:21:49] just bear with me my you know but I want
[1:21:57] to show you why Israel the new water
[1:21:59] ready to do and they still won't do the
[1:22:02] right thing you know when the man fell
[1:22:04] in the camera Vidan the Bible said ah
[1:22:06] nothing but a regret over the deal if
[1:22:08] somebody mention it but Adam knew what
[1:22:10] was right Adam wasn't deceived Adam noon
[1:22:14] and the same way many times were not
[1:22:16] deceived when you're too wrong you know
[1:22:19] that can I get a witness can I get a
[1:22:22] witness Adam wasn't received Eve was
[1:22:32] beguiled to see but Adam was not
[1:22:34] deceived so what happened emotions
[1:22:43] emotions the next slide please next
[1:22:49] picture all right
[1:22:56] forgive me I did a few years of medical
[1:22:58] school so you gotta forgive me I'm an ex
[1:23:05] doctor don't tell me I have a headache
[1:23:10] watch it I have a headache
[1:23:12] drinks some what a lot of water or
[1:23:15] something I mean forget it now
[1:23:17] forgetting all about medical stuff
[1:23:18] I forgot me I wasn't a good scene in
[1:23:20] school anyway so - leave it for so many
[1:23:22] years together forgotten
[1:23:23] - forgive this now Israel like you and I
[1:23:31] human beings don't make Israel they're
[1:23:33] very rebellious just like you and I are
[1:23:35] very rebellious and that's what the
[1:23:36] token each one knew was what to do and
[1:23:42] even do the right thing when Adam sinned
[1:23:44] Genesis 3 oh I didn't get my conduct
[1:23:46] Kryptos but when Adam sinned and either
[1:23:49] sin and the fair and God drove them out
[1:23:52] of the garden God said God said now that
[1:23:56] the man has become like one of us
[1:23:59] knowing good and evil
[1:24:05] let's drag him out so he won't take his
[1:24:08] him and taught you cannot achieve life
[1:24:09] and live forever and then the Bible says
[1:24:12] for eternal roaring do testament to his
[1:24:16] that know to do good and to I did not
[1:24:18] dream in the scene can somebody give me
[1:24:22] an amen
[1:24:23] no you didn't hear me you did not hear
[1:24:25] me no he did not hear me God sent Adam
[1:24:29] out because he has become like one of us
[1:24:32] the ability to be like God is to know
[1:24:35] good and evil like God looks upon the
[1:24:38] earth it is the same it is the wrong is
[1:24:41] this the fitness but doesn't kill you is
[1:24:43] he still does good all the time but
[1:24:46] landed the money come like one cost and
[1:24:48] he knows the man doesn't have the
[1:24:50] capacity to do good all the time like
[1:24:52] that and just straight his head in his
[1:24:55] political state to the tree of life and
[1:24:57] live forever
[1:24:58] don't drop him out
[1:25:03] these were only shown improve the atoms
[1:25:07] children can run by the same atomic
[1:25:10] nature that the flower brought in
[1:25:13] knowing good and evil
[1:25:15] but no ability no power no no no no no
[1:25:20] where we fell to show the wrong and to
[1:25:24] the right not just Israel using the same
[1:25:27] for today amen already talking about the
[1:25:34] talking but delay my little bad husband
[1:25:39] wife and you know your family try to get
[1:25:42] them in I'm gonna see how long they're
[1:25:44] but I want to focus on you on you to
[1:25:49] make sure that the talking really is
[1:25:51] taking effect in your life our emotions
[1:25:59] nobody teaches us how to manage them how
[1:26:02] to take care of them how to recognize
[1:26:05] them how to overcome them how to
[1:26:07] dominate them nobody teaches us that we
[1:26:10] got to school will end all the MBAs all
[1:26:12] the things i'ma go into the workforce
[1:26:14] going to life nobody teaches how to ahem
[1:26:17] let me turn on in children in school and
[1:26:19] many times on at home either
[1:26:23] but the parable says baba says paul
[1:26:28] romans heaven they love debate about
[1:26:31] paul room and seven
[1:26:32] where was he was he saying it or not say
[1:26:34] know that i'll answer that question for
[1:26:35] you know you can keep it there today
[1:26:40] Paul said what I want I would not
[1:26:47] when good is present with me when I want
[1:26:50] to do good evil is very present what's
[1:26:52] wrong with me who shall deliver me from
[1:26:56] the body of this death who shall deliver
[1:27:00] me parked right out the great Apostle
[1:27:02] Paul but we make like normal mean I'm
[1:27:05] all for calming and overcoming I'm
[1:27:07] overcoming lie
[1:27:09] many times sly know that when overcoming
[1:27:15] what brother Panza is the little things
[1:27:17] you leave undone those are things our
[1:27:19] eternal destination all right oh yeah
[1:27:26] wait Ryan bean and I said the head let
[1:27:33] you know all the senses of the body see
[1:27:38] smell taste hear feel or touch whether
[1:27:46] you recognize it or not when you see or
[1:27:49] feel or hear what happens they're sent
[1:27:52] into your body by what they call
[1:27:55] electrical impulses going to your body
[1:27:57] your body don't your body that's why you
[1:28:00] can't see my electric shock because your
[1:28:01] body's like an electric station so you
[1:28:05] can receive a shot because it get
[1:28:06] connected and you get shocked so when
[1:28:11] you see all your feelings what you see
[1:28:13] is a feeling where it talks filaments
[1:28:17] everything just the touch know is beyond
[1:28:19] the torch what you see what you smell if
[1:28:25] you smell good food it's a feeling if
[1:28:28] you taste that sponge cake mmm it's the
[1:28:31] feeling that's right if you have a sound
[1:28:37] like Braille errors causing you know
[1:28:41] boundary like a six or something and
[1:28:43] healthy push out is a feeling and every
[1:28:49] feeling what happens it pass through
[1:28:51] your body and go is going to the brain
[1:28:53] is headed for your frontal lobe right
[1:28:55] behind your forehead that's where all of
[1:28:58] the signals are interpreted I'm sorry
[1:29:03] little science labs right
[1:29:05] Oh science labs okay all right why do
[1:29:18] you do this to me so because you took
[1:29:20] you took it away like the Meccan see but
[1:29:22] delay
[1:29:22] take it away and you took their way so
[1:29:31] but delicious right for these signs one
[1:29:33] zero one class this morning so when the
[1:29:36] things they enter this is your spinal
[1:29:38] cord the comb ranchers manicott and
[1:29:40] enter through the base of your brain
[1:29:42] they're headed for the frontal lobe
[1:29:44] where you can think and this feeling is
[1:29:47] like smell
[1:29:49] well this flame is like a torch this
[1:29:51] feeling like a dish this is what I'm
[1:29:53] hearing
[1:29:53] are you with me all that is can trust in
[1:29:57] the period here in the frontal lobe but
[1:29:59] here's the problem I read this Jesus
[1:30:03] even that any much will generate by man
[1:30:06] because he knew all men and he knew also
[1:30:10] what was a man like this
[1:30:13] he made us equally knows he knows what
[1:30:16] we are made of he knows how we are wired
[1:30:19] consumerism
[1:30:21] [Applause]
[1:30:29] [Music]
[1:30:32] so all these sensations are your
[1:30:37] feelings I had a frontal lobe to
[1:30:40] interpret them he has the problem they
[1:30:44] have to pass through what they call the
[1:30:46] limbic system where your feelings take
[1:30:49] place where emotionless ticklish that
[1:30:53] were really should issue emotions why
[1:30:55] emotions take place so I spit spray
[1:31:01] Lawrence Hey and that sound comes to him
[1:31:05] as a feeling and it goes through his
[1:31:07] spinal cord base of his brain and before
[1:31:11] he gets the frontal lobe at the oh but I
[1:31:12] always talk to me for my own good
[1:31:14] it goes with emotions look at how
[1:31:16] shouted at me Cheryl I mean and if
[1:31:23] you're bad and you took back what she
[1:31:26] shot at me like that weight added to you
[1:31:30] la pata Tennessee yesterday husband gets
[1:31:33] home wife gets home while says honey
[1:31:36] great well the process in it by you it
[1:31:43] comes here enters here emotions mother
[1:31:47] and so what
[1:31:51] yes I had it so so later later this
[1:32:06] office business split second things be
[1:32:09] my field my wife is just trying to
[1:32:12] compliment me too
[1:32:13] we know how we are we do the action
[1:32:17] first stupid irresponsible and then we
[1:32:22] think later that's who we are that's who
[1:32:26] you are me I'm not like that that is who
[1:32:28] you are that's how you are wired can you
[1:32:32] say Amen I'm almost done almost done so
[1:32:56] we are wired to react before we think
[1:33:00] our emotions just reactive before we
[1:33:04] think I know what that's how animals are
[1:33:08] because the animal only has the brain
[1:33:11] don't have a soul I must have a brain
[1:33:15] and they're thinking since that is very
[1:33:18] primitive but animals are based on
[1:33:20] especially the ones close to human
[1:33:22] beings the chimpanzees and all that they
[1:33:24] are like people who study mama
[1:33:26] I mean primal behavior knows our brains
[1:33:29] that fashion the same way this primitive
[1:33:32] brain here is all about your emotions
[1:33:34] your feelings and unfortunately for us
[1:33:36] we are wired to respond by emotion
[1:33:40] before we even think and that's where is
[1:33:43] the problem that is the problem it's
[1:33:46] your problem my problem is a human
[1:33:49] problem it is not just your watch
[1:33:51] problem is your problem to you he's not
[1:33:54] your husband swap it's your problems you
[1:33:56] and when it gets this put here you don't
[1:33:59] care who else has the problem you see
[1:34:01] Lord
[1:34:01] have a problem I want my problem solved
[1:34:05] hey man so we have come to the great
[1:34:13] convention applying the talking not even
[1:34:18] to a message and we know all these
[1:34:19] things but that's here that's here the
[1:34:23] frontal lobe so won't we leave here
[1:34:26] tomorrow morning and we go home we think
[1:34:29] automatically we're going to stop doing
[1:34:31] the things no no I'm not going to pour
[1:34:39] cold water on your excitement just
[1:34:43] trying to tell you the truth because the
[1:34:49] same session would happen exactly is
[1:34:51] this a hotel her husband and that
[1:34:53] emotions can run while he's reacting
[1:34:55] he's thinking right I will have the
[1:34:56] action between this but he just can't
[1:35:01] stop himself so that's our problem there
[1:35:08] that's the problem right there before
[1:35:15] the ticket I'll just take a look at it
[1:35:16] for finish
[1:35:22] crumb cake class right just ready for a
[1:35:26] few minutes and just thinking about you
[1:35:29] all the things you've read in this
[1:35:30] minute here the boy speaking to you like
[1:35:32] that
[1:35:32] son daughter you're gonna make you got
[1:35:34] to make amends here you're gonna change
[1:35:35] here this here he's gonna stand in the
[1:35:44] way
[1:35:45] amen Thank You brothers so God knew all
[1:35:55] of this don't you that and that's why he
[1:35:59] knew men will hardly ever be able to
[1:36:06] live by the commandments of God on their
[1:36:10] own because of the way they are
[1:36:13] structured because of the way they are
[1:36:15] made and that's why he will let them
[1:36:19] come every year I wouldn't tell them
[1:36:22] that why do you do this in again no I
[1:36:23] didn't notice it again because you knew
[1:36:25] that's just how they are structured is
[1:36:26] waiting for the time when the Lamb of
[1:36:28] God who is gonna take away the sin is
[1:36:33] gonna solve for you this problem the
[1:36:37] Lamb of God will solve for you this
[1:36:40] problem can you say Amen and he has
[1:36:44] already solved that problem MA
[1:36:50] [Applause]
[1:37:02] amen
[1:37:03] so what he got do what he got do what he
[1:37:09] got you God in the beginning
[1:37:13] when he made Adam and Eve he knew right
[1:37:17] away that this year he's gonna make them
[1:37:21] have a pram with even keeping the word
[1:37:24] so what he did they had a control center
[1:37:28] outside of the brain a control center
[1:37:32] which is an S soul like the king when he
[1:37:38] speaks these ones will learn up when he
[1:37:45] speaks emotions Lana when he speaks
[1:37:49] feelings manner when he speaks reason
[1:37:52] legs up
[1:37:53] [Applause]
[1:38:03] so God you made money 3 for Ben let me
[1:38:08] have this frosted picture back again I'm
[1:38:15] in the soul of man he put the control
[1:38:19] center you know was this calm person
[1:38:21] that I put there we each know the story
[1:38:24] already God before the foundation of the
[1:38:26] world and all of that I don't want to go
[1:38:27] over that because you know that but God
[1:38:30] you put your seed which is the person of
[1:38:34] himself which is your connection with
[1:38:36] God it put that seed in the soul and
[1:38:43] that's see I don't wish that all the
[1:38:46] time but that seed is what will bring
[1:38:48] from the miracle hallelujah is not a sin
[1:38:53] like your mango seed is a seed of God
[1:38:55] and everything is in that seed and that
[1:38:59] seed will bring for his own time and
[1:39:02] it's just seed it were people of God's
[1:39:05] kind and whatever you are supposed to be
[1:39:08] is already in that seed
[1:39:12] [Applause]
[1:39:23] so what happens what happens the
[1:39:32] fillings come into your body
[1:39:35] Jai emotions we want to react the
[1:39:39] control center in the soul tells it
[1:39:41] no don't to that these are split-second
[1:39:44] things but that's exactly what happens
[1:39:47] that's what a Christians behavior is
[1:39:49] different
[1:39:49] that's why Christian doesn't you can't
[1:39:51] even explain yourself because the
[1:39:53] silicon remains in you the sinner God
[1:39:56] the sinner God contains every bad
[1:39:59] behavior until have Reaper habits let me
[1:40:06] read you some things I knew that let me
[1:40:10] do some things in memory some things
[1:40:12] here but the problem said intellectually
[1:40:22] we're hearing the message and
[1:40:25] intellectually we have heard all these
[1:40:27] things here not because we're the
[1:40:29] lecturers no it simply means by our
[1:40:31] brains we understand these things but
[1:40:34] don't let the devil fool you but because
[1:40:37] you are understand actually is automatic
[1:40:39] you will do them because your emotions
[1:40:42] are gonna stand in the way Oh glory

[1:41:41] alright let me just read this good here
[1:41:44] intellectually we have fought we're
[1:41:46] hearing the message but the Branum said
[1:41:48] here
[1:41:48] Amazing Grace this is from gospel a
[1:41:52] little washing practice of washing he
[1:41:54] said Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
[1:41:56] see just know we're ever explained what
[1:41:59] it is just take my word if you believe
[1:42:01] me he was talking about you know go me
[1:42:02] on the cotton of time be sure to make
[1:42:05] sure on every breach of the wall behind
[1:42:07] you I believe the judge is begin to hear
[1:42:11] the message and begin to understand it
[1:42:16] people say we don't have to understand
[1:42:18] it's true in other words you don't have
[1:42:20] to do intellectual honest time to do it
[1:42:23] that's right
[1:42:24] but the Holy Spirit gives you some
[1:42:25] little understanding that will help you
[1:42:27] along the way but truly we don't have to
[1:42:29] understand like you explained by your
[1:42:31] intellect and all that but instead they
[1:42:34] try to be to understand the message but
[1:42:37] friends listen but you're on your
[1:42:39] intellectually understanding we've got
[1:42:42] to lay in the prints of a song we've
[1:42:45] gotta be ripened our faith even after
[1:42:49] you read all these glorious things this
[1:42:50] weekend our faith isn't a rapper yet
[1:42:55] intellectually we're here in the message
[1:42:57] that God has given us and seen the
[1:43:00] science that is shoulders
[1:43:02] I'm proving it by the Bible is there but
[1:43:04] all how the chat needs to lay in the
[1:43:08] presence in its presently ten days of
[1:43:12] you know and gets which in the spirit to
[1:43:14] come beat down sometimes in speaking the
[1:43:17] message you get hash you'll get hash and
[1:43:21] that limbic system emotions and say like
[1:43:23] well they talking to me like that
[1:43:25] doesn't say that you know it's my good
[1:43:28] it's the message it's the talk in
[1:43:32] sometimes with a message you can hash
[1:43:39] you have to break in like that because
[1:43:42] you've got to clinch and nail to make it
[1:43:44] home but well when the chat ones gets it
[1:43:47] the locker is called out and separated
[1:43:51] then in the presence of God I know it
[1:43:53] means something like the people was
[1:43:55] there when it takes its rapture so let's
[1:43:58] have the talking deal with this problem
[1:44:01] for all put emotions in its place so
[1:44:05] that would be you know act on what we
[1:44:06] know so that we will not be found sinful
[1:44:10] because it he that knows what to do and
[1:44:12] to a did not is not iniquity the Browse
[1:44:14] it to him it is seen that's why other
[1:44:17] was driven are they got a villain and we
[1:44:19] are not going to go back to Eden doing
[1:44:21] the same thing when what's right and not
[1:44:23] ruin it expect to go back to Eden that's
[1:44:27] why the talkin share the Lamb of God
[1:44:30] that takes away all the scene of the
[1:44:33] world
[1:44:33] Oh hallelujah it will take your every
[1:44:38] problem he will deliver every package or
[1:44:42] it'll God
[1:44:46] many men all right now I emotions and
[1:44:59] sickness is a big issue because we rise
[1:45:02] and fall on the ability to control our
[1:45:06] emotions what was in first Romans 7 the
[1:45:12] emotions of sin is the emotions of sin
[1:45:16] most every sin that you and I to our
[1:45:20] emotions make us do it so they can learn
[1:45:25] to master and control our emotions we
[1:45:30] will live much better than many of us
[1:45:33] are living even though we know the
[1:45:35] message we know what other plan I'm set
[1:45:36] to do we know love your brother loved
[1:45:38] your sister we know all of these things
[1:45:40] don't mean more young people know go to
[1:45:43] school and be a Christian Brothers know
[1:45:45] grown the job and be a Christian as
[1:45:48] you're talking now they're talking don't
[1:45:50] come to pat you on the back we're
[1:45:51] talking comes my house cleaning time a
[1:45:53] man to clean the stable to
[1:45:56] apprenticeship and make sure you are
[1:45:58] right with God
[1:45:59] Oh hallelujah glory the problem is many
[1:46:16] of us don't even know that we are
[1:46:18] controlled by these emotions we explain
[1:46:22] them away we justify them sure the
[1:46:25] reason why we act before we think and
[1:46:28] because of our ego because of our pride
[1:46:30] even when we have caught ourselves that
[1:46:33] what we did or said or or acted is wrong
[1:46:36] we would not say I am sorry
[1:46:45] we will say well yeah I talk like that
[1:46:48] because of the way you talk to meet you
[1:46:51] so well you know so what about that what
[1:46:57] is it even when you know this practical
[1:47:09] Christian living
[1:47:10] that's what the talking represents glory
[1:47:13] to God amen
[1:47:15] let me let me show you something here
[1:47:18] when we talk about emotions many of us
[1:47:21] can't even explain what it is we know if

[1:52:32] never that was a for fear worried from a
[1:52:39] fear team eat fear and shame that's the
[1:52:50] last category where Isaac spoke to us
[1:52:54] and spooky elastin a I believe or two
[1:52:56] centers ago my people shall never be
[1:53:00] ashamed Shem you feel shame when you
[1:53:05] feel disgraced
[1:53:07] look anyways pastor talk to me look at
[1:53:09] the way that they can said look you feel
[1:53:16] disgraced before people shame when you
[1:53:22] even admonished for something that's
[1:53:25] your doing
[1:53:26] people just react with shame because the
[1:53:31] one is coming in and the Lummi stances I
[1:53:33] look at that is Grace in you that is
[1:53:37] Grace in you how do you talk to you like
[1:53:40] that how dare he because I'm in this
[1:53:44] church here on that church or whatever
[1:53:49] if you're disgraced you feel guilty when
[1:53:55] you are secretive like brother Isaac
[1:53:57] said when you don't things annual
[1:53:58] secretive it's change that makes you
[1:54:00] hide the things I should bring out in
[1:54:03] the open so you can get help and
[1:54:04] deliverance ship makes you had it under
[1:54:07] the table and the devil lost that shame
[1:54:17] and regret that's a big one shin regret
[1:54:22] you oh if only if only if only just live
[1:54:33] your life you look back 10 20 30 years
[1:54:36] just regrets like that Jim
[1:54:40] each of these emotions the limbic system
[1:54:44] or some day even when you know that's
[1:54:50] what was bomb said when the humanistic
[1:54:51] realm just walking by the debates of
[1:54:54] your mind you can make real progress as
[1:54:56] a Christian you were like any other man
[1:54:58] as Norfolk you are like an animal
[1:55:00] because animals only listen from this
[1:55:02] year they live from this year that's
[1:55:04] that's what you were like Amen glory to
[1:55:12] God amen
[1:55:13] and sleep by emotions you can see right
[1:55:17] away
[1:55:19] emotions can be a very very destructive
[1:55:22] force you can see in the fall in the for
[1:55:26] what happened sitting him to Eve have
[1:55:30] God said so sure what I said you shall
[1:55:33] not she's quoting from her frontal lobe
[1:55:38] what she need to be the right thing and
[1:55:40] she was right and the devil knew the
[1:55:43] Bible said but the venom said the
[1:55:45] serpent man he understood the principles
[1:55:48] of life
[1:55:49] he understood the principles of life he
[1:55:53] knew a prince that close to that's why
[1:55:56] you just a friend
[1:55:57] it was on his feet like a chimpanzee
[1:56:00] they're driven by the emotions and most
[1:56:02] are brings that close to that so what
[1:56:06] did he do to get her to drop what she
[1:56:08] knew God said what'd he do he said you
[1:56:11] shall not surely die
[1:56:12] you said no I shall die so he took it to
[1:56:15] her eyes and when she saw that the fruit
[1:56:22] the tree was Pooja
[1:56:24] and to make one wise have feelings she
[1:56:32] saw it she smelt it he put his hand upon
[1:56:36] her it felt good
[1:56:38] he felt it felt good so she began to say
[1:56:43] yeah this was good she was good
[1:56:45] disconnecting her from what she knew to
[1:56:47] be what God said disconnecting her
[1:56:51] disconnecting her and the Bible said
[1:56:53] when she tasted so it was a fruit to
[1:56:57] make one wise she took of it clean her
[1:57:02] mouth and get to a husband with her and
[1:57:08] that's how Cain and Abel came forth our
[1:57:13] parents who came straight from God could
[1:57:18] not beat this pathway and the devil knew
[1:57:21] that make them slaves to their emotions
[1:57:26] make them bound up to the emotions with
[1:57:30] any time so intellectually we have the
[1:57:34] message it's not enough that is not
[1:57:36] enough because too many things you and I
[1:57:39] know is the right to do and yet we will
[1:57:42] not do it
[1:57:44] because of our emotions can somebody say
[1:57:48] Oh hallelujah
[1:57:53] God amen amen amen
[1:57:57] Oh glory all right I'm skipping all this
[1:58:04] here amen
[1:58:06] so what are we here in this convention
[1:58:11] for we're here in this convention to
[1:58:16] meet the Lamb of God who takes away the
[1:58:20] sin of the world in other words he gets
[1:58:23] seen at these very roots no sins those
[1:58:26] that just those that just a small
[1:58:28] characteristics of sin to get at his
[1:58:32] various and I'm telling you the very
[1:58:33] roots of it know that Jesus knew all men
[1:58:36] here know what sin man then knows why
[1:58:39] they are acting the way they're acting
[1:58:41] where they are and where they are
[1:58:42] reacting where you understand these
[1:58:44] things you don't stand why your wife can
[1:58:46] get angry when there's no need for anger
[1:58:48] why your husband can be mad I mean when
[1:58:51] there's no need for it you know what's
[1:58:53] going on you know why your husband has
[1:58:56] been mean nasty the way he's or your son
[1:58:58] is just crazy the way is you understand
[1:59:00] those things because you understand
[1:59:02] these things here can you say Amen let
[1:59:13] me read you in France are you from
[1:59:14] Romans 7
[1:59:20] Paul said verse 4 wherefore my brethren
[1:59:24] you also have become dead to the law by
[1:59:26] the body of Christ
[1:59:29] there should be married to another even
[1:59:30] to him who is raised from the dead that
[1:59:32] we should bring forth fruit unto God for
[1:59:34] when we were in the flesh humanistic the
[1:59:40] motions of scenes which were by the law
[1:59:43] did walk in our members to bring forth
[1:59:47] fruit unto death but now we are
[1:59:49] delivered from the law that being dead
[1:59:53] where we were held that we should serve
[1:59:55] in newness of spirit along the ordinance
[1:59:58] of the letter let me tell you here we
[2:00:00] know those we know that Peter Peter the
[2:00:06] great Apostle Peter who would mention
[2:00:10] that Alesana many now are the christ the
[2:00:13] son of living and i just given the keys
[2:00:15] you should have the keys of the kingdom
[2:00:17] peter knew you know he had a revelation
[2:00:20] so is not it not to have a revelation a
[2:00:23] revelation is not enough because with
[2:00:27] cheapen I have a revelation and then we
[2:00:29] live anyhow the talking is coming in
[2:00:32] calling me halt to all of them Peter had
[2:00:37] a revelation but what did you Jesus want
[2:00:44] him Jordan a mystery transmitter
[2:00:45] he said not me me and when the battle
[2:00:49] came to it Peter denied the Lord three
[2:00:51] times he cursed he denied Christ you
[2:00:55] talk about Christ in the third person
[2:00:56] I don't know that man when Peter came
[2:01:01] face-to-face with death these emotions
[2:01:04] fear gripped him and what he knew he had
[2:01:08] been warned what in you
[2:01:09] he pushed aside said no no I'm not to
[2:01:11] die yet that man I don't know him and
[2:01:13] yet we have the keys
[2:01:17] you have the keys to the kingdom so
[2:01:19] don't tell me I have a revelation it is
[2:01:22] not enough in me something more than
[2:01:24] that
[2:01:25] can you say Amen glory no God in me all
[2:01:40] right what to care of this in Adam
[2:01:48] before the fall God talking to Adam soul
[2:01:53] God spirit from heaven and that's why
[2:01:58] you and I need the baptism of the Holy
[2:01:59] Ghost with other part of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:02] you don't stand a chance
[2:02:05] you don't stand a fighting chance life
[2:02:08] of the Panem said you don't stand a
[2:02:10] chance they might go ready no riddle God
[2:02:18] amen amen amen amen
[2:02:22] Oh glory well thank God this ought to
[2:02:27] make you afraid our faith is based upon
[2:02:30] his finished work because you know the
[2:02:32] reason why God he told Israel take a
[2:02:37] lamb for one house I know the reason why
[2:02:40] God he took a lamb for his own house way

[2:04:15] of the house and sharing what well the
[2:04:18] real activity was the outside was just
[2:04:20] for a display but before the display

[2:23:08] sinned and God declared lamb in Eden and
[2:23:14] Adam reached back his fellowship reach
[2:23:18] the back eternal life and drove him out
[2:23:20] if I was we stop back in flesh with God
[2:23:22] what that lamb was declared when
[2:23:25] grunting presently the libros is on the
[2:23:27] scene
[2:23:31] [Applause]
[2:23:32] when the credit lamb in Israel the
[2:23:36] talking deliverance was on the scene as
[2:23:38] well as George Minjae when he drove Adam
[2:23:46] out I've said this so many times but let
[2:23:48] me go sister a picture number three and
[2:23:50] I'm don't Lori laughing this is
[2:24:01] beautiful I wish like going about to eat
[2:24:03] in the Bible said when he drove Adam out
[2:24:11] of you didn't I say declared lamb there
[2:24:14] you drove out I'm out if you see the
[2:24:18] story of your Redemption when he took
[2:24:21] Adam out the Bible said he planted a
[2:24:23] garden eastward in Eden so this organ is
[2:24:25] on the eastern part of Eden right I'm
[2:24:30] waiting to Adam out so that Adam will
[2:24:32] not touch the tree of life again what he
[2:24:34] did he put kilims on the eastern part of
[2:24:39] Eden the the can was interest part of
[2:24:42] Eden The Tree of Life was in the middle
[2:24:44] of the garden on the eastern part of
[2:24:46] Eden and the eastern part is like the
[2:24:47] back side I damaged it all the time this
[2:24:56] Bible here you know you know is the book
[2:24:58] of symbols the book of life that she of
[2:25:00] life and if it have the Bible this way
[2:25:04] this part here is it nothing that this
[2:25:08] Perea is a self at this front part here
[2:25:11] is the Western map this back part here
[2:25:14] is the instant Roger
[2:25:15] so this Caribbeans were on the eastern
[2:25:19] pad on the back part of the Tree of Life
[2:25:23] on the eastern part of Eden those things
[2:25:27] mean something and I put Cara babies
[2:25:32] there with a flaming sword to make sure
[2:25:34] they drove Adam out and make sure Adam
[2:25:37] would not come back to that Tree of Life
[2:25:50] and I put bamboo dramatize you can see
[2:25:53] Adam walking away and going looking at
[2:25:56] his son walking away he had no uncle to
[2:25:59] go to
[2:25:59] no auntie to go to no friend he was the
[2:26:03] only man on the face of the earth and
[2:26:04] his wife have you ever thought of that
[2:26:06] was their lonesome or for Adam but he
[2:26:10] had sinned and sin has its consequences
[2:26:11] young people's sin has consequences and
[2:26:16] God drove him out too many times we want
[2:26:20] a lot more than God loves let me leave
[2:26:24] that alone
[2:26:29] so God
[2:26:30] Adam was gonna solve those Caribbeans
[2:26:33] the flaming sword I knew he couldn't
[2:26:36] strike for this end to the Tree of Life
[2:26:41] that's the place that's the place where
[2:26:43] that book because it she loved was it
[2:26:45] was the book of life the atom has open
[2:26:49] access to the book of redemption the
[2:26:52] bucola was open to him he had open
[2:26:54] access and this where the book became
[2:26:55] closed and went back to the hands of the
[2:26:58] original owner right here right here the
[2:27:02] flaming sword throw them out and seal
[2:27:06] the book on his back pad by the Cubans
[2:27:09] the cherubims drew him out

[2:27:33] killer bombs cherubims Eastwood you know
[2:27:37] the flaming sword and the lamb was there
[2:27:42] and the book went back to the hands of
[2:27:45] original owner God the Lamb of God
[2:27:49] himself
[2:27:53] and you'll see down through the Bible

[2:28:04] there were seven thousand names under
[2:28:06] the seal of life who are not bad to Bill
[2:28:08] and could open the book attempted about
[2:28:12] the book was still closed because of the
[2:28:14] key problems
