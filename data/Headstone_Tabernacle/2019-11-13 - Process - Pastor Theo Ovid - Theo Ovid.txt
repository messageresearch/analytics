========================================
[Music] hallelujah and I'm living in this moment clanging praise you - hallelujah [Music] romi Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and mercy tonight thank you for your blood thank you for the cross that give us this opportunity to come into your presence what manner of love is this Lord they can polish your sons and daughters tonight won't we thank you for your presence here tonight you can't give it a presence of your word the presence of your power here tonight I have the preeminence as Lord and as we approach your word tonight may give us insight they give us inspiration inspire every heart here and give them great comfort tonight that you are true that you are faithful that you would confirm and backup your word granted Lord in Jesus and we ask it we thank you for all who make it out tonight all to the traffic all to the condition but they are here and we are here in your presence speak to us Lord just one word from you just one word tonight then Jesus and we ask it amen and amen god bless you we have some prayer requests we'll take out the energy service but we have three portion of Scripture as we like to approach tonight from Joshua top the tree we want to read verse one to find sentence up to 12 those 20 to 24 and he wished up to 4 2011 they're just three portions of scriptures tonight reading from Joshua chapter 3 reading from verse 1 and Joshua rose early in the morning they removed from shittim and came to Jordan he and all the chin of Israel and Lodge there before the Passover in the past after treaties that the officers went to the hosts and commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests and the Levites there in it then he shall remove from your place and go after it yet there shall be a space between you on it about two thousand cubits by measure come not near into it that he may know the way by which in my school for you have not passed this way heretofore and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among us so in John chapter 12 we know from verse 20 and it was hidden Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefore to Philip which was of the Caesar of Galilee and he saw him saying so we would see Jesus and Philip commit until it Andrew and Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and jesus answered them saying they always come but the son of man should be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth own but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit our last scriptures of Hebrews and that's was from Hebrews from verse chapter 4 verse 1 let us therefore fear Lisa promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that hid it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said I've sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place on the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again he said they shall enter into Myra's see and therefore it remaineth at some may enter there in that day to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief again eliminated a sitting day seen and David today after so long a time as it is said today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts for if Jesus had given them rest then should he not have afterward have spoken of another day there a minute there for a rest to the people of God for he that has entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest least any man fall after the same example of unbelief let us pray one more time father we thank you for the scriptures and father you say all Scripture is given for anything for instructions for rebuke for guidance guidance tonight by your light by your love by your word in Jesus name bless it to our hearts amen and amen you may be seated oh praise God you love him tonight oh praise be to you so glad for you all to be out here tonight welcome tonight have a title I think is the fullest I'm using one word as the title just one word and that word is process that word is process as one would process and process means a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end that's what the word process means actions steps process hallelujah from a worm to butterfly that's the process from similar to Saint that's the process from jacob jake' grease to drill perfection that's the process this is Berta Branagh chorus of Wesley with sonification second message of the work of Greece it was a wonderful thing but after Wesley and Asbury the organizer died now in the midst of this then the Pentecost was a restoration of the gifts in the mists of all this gold is still calling a remnant out of every one of those generations and it's our time of coming out our gathering together and the gospel businessman has played a great part in bringing down the breaking down these walls there's no difference in us let us come together and worship God under one principle not under an organization if it was an organization I get off this platform right now I will have nothing to do with it what is it it's got to be a fellowship not a fellowship of some Creed but a fellowship in Christ by the power of his resurrection and that's the thing that brings life it brings birth and before bird can come we realize there has to be a debt before boot and a boot is a mess and okay what kind of blood it is is a big panel it's a mess so is the new billet it makes you do things that ordinarily you wouldn't think you will do but when you're ready to die to yourself then you are born again a new creature in Christ Jesus then the things open up and life becomes a new sight to you because you have accepted the person of Jesus Christ or even to the written word it's got to be quickened by the Holy Spirit even the text even the word is being read even the word being spoken it's got to be quickened by the Holy Spirit then he said no matter how much theology your gut is laying there dead I could have a handful of wheat until it gets into the process to where it can be quickened the we shall never live Oh glory to God genuine wheat have to come into the process where it could be quickened and you can have the doctor's degree but until the Holy Spirit comes upon that and quickens it to you as a personal experience with God then the wheat does no good he said your linen is in vain or glory the court so what you need is a quickening power and man don't have that that belongs to God go and have that so when you recognize your needy you are dependent your humbling yourself because you want him to quick and this thing to you or glory to God from you must move born again he said your approach to this boot there's not approach to it there's what there's an approach to it approach this book you've got to go to a process just like anything that lives in our lives again gotta die first and you cannot keep your same spirit or glory the ball very hard for you last for you can't keep your same spirit your vex for this one you're angry this what you can't keep us in spirit you upset for this one you upset but you can't keep that your national spirit when we have trained us for every country spirit to your marvelous forgive me our own spirit your ARIMA spirit wherever spread where my spirit whatever condition or your family spirit you can't keep that when my family so on my family so you can't keep back you have to come into the Holy Spirit they have loved me but family there's a little bit country that I wrote your background will come from doesn't you have to keep it there is an approach to it and you have to know God no need that because I'll be saying sundar when you died that breaks up any home hallelujah glory to God he said you cannot keep your same habits so you spirit up the change you have it after change and another one you cannot keep your same thoughts that means every different things you have to get new people to talk with and fellowship with because I can keep the same thoughts that can work you cannot you got to die you've got to die like he died you got to die on his Altera like a bell didn't put Islam you've got to die with your lamb you've got to die and died your own thinking to be born into his thinking so damn your blood cut taking your vex and you want the street on this one and speak by this one you oughta tell back this one that you that's not that that is hard hallelujah oh praise God yes to be born again you must go through a process of debt everything does you take the greener wheat if the corn ever expects to live again he's got to die first if the green or wheat ever expected living in the corner wheat the flower the tree the grass everything must die again how you will they escape it you have to go to the process and every one of you going to something everybody are going to something hallelujah and accorded how to you process listen carefully I call it the whole you process what you're going through you'll get the results if you're fine is not justified what you're going through yogev expect God you will get next which is this one you will blame this one and bring that one because you find it shouldn't be so but if you look at Romans 8:28 I know all things not some things even the traffic tonight even how hard it was to get here tonight all things work together for good to them that love God to them who in ours yoga with you willing to allow God to send you to the process hallelujah no adoption is a Kenan doesn't represent the mill millennium it only represent the age of the overcomer the dispensation of overcoming because in Canaan and the kill and Boonen took cities or glory to God isn't that right so in this land we talking about it upsets it have don't sense it of hills it have mounted the valley it have mistakes it have bombs it's a broken hand broken foot that walk and a condition but one thing for sure is your land Alleluia nor Philistines the tides abuse I could run you out of your own land sorry you come to take over what they have because they were squatters on it you meet demons on that plan you know that la was my empty languor give you that line of problems that time of conditions but that is the process quote put he say wouldn't get the land all who all together in one shot he said but little by little he understood the process to inherit this glorious land is occurring all the land way and then the grass I hope it can maintain it but you know a panther alone here you have some chickens here you have some time in here and there's a game drawing you're trying to get more unless you came groaning you're like God will give you more you have to maintain once again I like that you maintain watch again and God will give you more again or get the Lord Ashok maintain watch again that's again impersonal unto game it you have to say this is mines you have to cut your counseling what is not yours hallelujah think about it now so God have to give you a revelation of your possession joy is yours this is yours the deliverance is yours make sure it's yours holy versus yours your family that's just true breakthrough that's yours too revival that's yours to healing that is yours you have to know a result and begin the climate if you never claimed not instead I came tonight see from the night is my night I said in the claim because the Holy Spirit only in the sea based upon your claims if they claim nothing you get nothing that's why the Bible said when you pray come on now believe you have received and you shall receive hallelujah yes I believe you believe you have it and you will have it believe it Catherine before you get it and you shall get it that is faith back hallelujah mmm and we believe that now we know the promise in the New Testament and the Old Testament is the Holy Spirit we know that already we preach that we see that now that the promise is the promise of the Father is the holy sprit is none right now you notice Joshua before they cross Jordan Joshua say go to the mists of the camp and clean your clothes and sanctify every one of you let no man come at his rifle written three days you will see the glory of God it is a process of getting ready to inherit the promise so if you are not willing to go through the process you haven't think Sunday that God looks at the heart this is not right God came and anoint David to be king isn't that right David the shepherd boy was anointed be King when he can feel led to go up there solo since all I come from your throne they kill him he can't do that he had a weight he had to go back and see what the Sheep because he had to go to a process because even though he was anointed he was already at or chlorine approaching you should be anointed but you already yet you have to go to PR OC es s a process or chlorine occur before you sit on that throne and you know David went to hell they were hiding the kids he ever had to play mad leave another runaway develops fears but he was still king or throwing up because he was chosen of God or not because they go to a rough time not because you're running for your life you are not chosen you are not annoyed don't believe that it's a process of getting ready to inherit the promise there's three stages of the journey is not right coming out of Egypt orphan of the blood sanctifying and that significant part is when you become a pilgrim and I'll show China hope you got your second arrest on the virus and leave at the Entente stressed Oh Gloria have a restless night you have no previous traveling God set it up that way because he wrestles the end of the game and the rest is charity so he gave it to labor Oh clearly a revelation to labor Oh Chloe don't worry he'll ever to enter into that rest or chlorine ago the race is the love of God say a wrestling mat feet the rest limit virtual knowledge temperance temperance yes that's controller that is self control I don't understand sex demon is almost control you have there is something called temperance the temperance of Jesus Christ or give the Lord a show Loreena blood there's a power to overcome all them things lust of the eyes lust of the flesh the pride of life who can give God give you power when you do not pull over yourself or give the Lord a show so all these virtues here it's a high get man in subjection to the word itself virtually a weakness knowledge only ignorance and branch over your looseness or k the Lord has choked in the house this is love your temperance this is his temperance this is his patience this is his communist this is his bodily Titus this is the process Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory glory to God so people Steve stopping on the journey they stopped my justification they stopped identification

this process to process the inheritance that God give us or cattle or - oh we couldn't confirm the promise in the wilderness because the witness was not inheritance the journey is not inheritance the process is not heritance the process is make a true difference or give the Lord a shout this is a little word this is one word tonight but this is where the most powerful world that could engage your

King if you defy that you defy the king you know because the king's son that has been adopted to have the ring a signet of authority to put his thumb on any document and wanna say what he hired is

the goings get rough and things get tough hallelujah if whoever handle your process or yeah beep are going to this any possible today that will be passed on them you also hit yours yet because of scripture for you who faked and process every son that cometh to God must go true who says okay the Lord I shout does not pass the only thing there's not that many ministry only thing dies every man after go true that process hallelujah praise God could we continue tonight if we could only get the mechanics ready get our hearts right the things that we can do oh you mean the process is part the things that we can do yes God can't go and clean up you learn for you he said the land is yours and I'm Anna waiting so lord could you drop down so I'm in love with some who and some folk and aloe and Mona then big teams could be grass oh yeah almost a skeleton or a diesel you died looking for that no butter Bannon said D had was a cut the grass and done themselves understand this under will enable list you cannot no tree so God said Manor they didn't pick that go drop it on them to keep them and receive them so God sent us manna from heaven she was 20th century prophet on this journey to the promised land us speak that you ain't caught that you just pick up a book and feed on that and God give your grace go give your strength that you will be in this message will be the message you'd know it Stassi at the Lord you have your updates you have the tongued is your struggle and so on but you have manner but when you cross over into the land it's corn and wine you have to plant or chlorine of God and I'll tell you something when you cross over the Holy Ones gonna begin to plant inside of you go begin to put spirits with local seed inside of you it'll be a different annoyed altogether you know or glory to God crossing over into the land of Ephesians and we read this quote before some time ago if you get in mechanic's ready and his mechanics here he switch it not text and Colton and wood on wood no get our hearts right the things that we can do follow every word for him in baptism follow me every order he told us to do get every mechanic and stand ear then we are ready for dynamics do people preach days and hours dynamic dynamic comment on what where's the mechanics you bet the mechanics is not just preaching you would the mechanics is getting you your heart rate and and all that you can do that is the personal mechanics before the angels get breakthrough with the Holy Ghost to bring Berta Bannerman to the seventh seal he hadn't said what got all delusions and you have to gather all the illusions of your life your loosens had to be a sin sake a delusion wrong terminology here was the tie up delusions and you have to get delusions in your life tied up then don't come the angel yet tie ablutions in the world and always plug all the gaps and tie it back into the world so now the fluid restored and what a restoration of full word God could bring under full holy rose so he said it this way in uniting time and sign the seven eighty over seven eternity to gather all the scattered wood that tied back into the world to bring on the Holy Ghost so like a template wood that was missing would have Otis or what for to talk like a puzzle so when he posted got together here come the glory so the full glory come down in the message of the hour and God put the glory on sieve it into the world and let the would be preached and put the word in you know the glory in you it would form all of God's glory is in the width but put the word in you that the glory could be inside of you and the devil deceived because he think you have nothing when the secret is the word is in the bride and got at the drop that would in you my spirit spoken word that you read prophecy say what the Tipsy but the promises inside of you by these promises you become a partaker of the divine nature the whole parameters in you tonight by promised by mechanic by the water entire pyramid inside of you or pouring of God but detect equipment power glory to God Alleluia so these Greece come to see Jesus a we would see Jesus talked to the ciphers ciphers in pull them aside try to explain to them and so on psychic bring him say to Jesus look him live and Jesus they let except a corn of wheat fall in the wrong and I divide alone what is your telling them he says says you want to see me right but to see me you have to go to a process you can't see what you want to see the way you want to see it if you really want to see it take the process what that secret room because the corner we'd have to go to something in order to reproduce so if you want to see me you have to see me a Calvary where you have to die Oh hallelujah so Jesus didn't play games with them he tell them the reality of this dying out and this death is death of a corn or wheat this process that they can understand it takes a process to see him to get to him Oh hallelujah swatch get every mechanic ready understand there and when we write the dynamics to be little unique what can do that and that's the drop into your heart the feet that says I am healed that's dynamics let's look at the man who was blind and he was selling newspaper and he was a Catholic his feet had nothing to hold on to so but when he came back any peril any second time bombs I prefer you a heel he said okay see by he strikes on him so he's saying that what's happening here with him now he is saying that from a conscious position by Shah Pahlavi Bashar I'm here I saw here what didn't happen there that's by shadow he dropped from conscious to subconscious I when I hit the subconscious he and he was taken here could he jump out about out here because now it becomes fake from the innermost fade from the soul do you understand how we connected this with Sunday service this first level of faith was intellectual that is what he gave me prayer line with so he endured we get healed but he's I'm blind come back little angry and thinking not have us something happening there at the other spring claim or whatever it is he said he said no bicep your heel you are actually healed it's a manifest in reality but but that is the word so all the world until mill to it I adopted babies it they say when a woman can have a baby she just if she had up a child and I'm keep you know guessing that it will activate things and now she'll have a baby so what he did know he was he was adopting that promise by strapping on him by strap time he'll buy and they laughing at him buy from here I slept on here but you see the more he see it the more getting deeper and deeper and deeper because he's speaking something that is not as good a way he's speaking it and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit dynamics take what he had from here and drop it down here and he had it so don't be afraid to speak it because one day you're gonna drop from here and drop into here and you're gonna have it and go materialized Oh glory to God from here to here the process Oh glory to God the head and the heart looking near but sometime is so far because when you say Amen something say yeah sure or chlorine accord that's a big big distinction or but we want to close that gap tonight or chlorine is on one day it will close all together and what you say you believe what you believe you have a faith that's from the inner mold so glory to God and then you're approaching mark 11:23 if you shall say to the mountain or glory to God remove and don't talk in your heart because as the level of your subconscious Oh tonight do you see you tonight or glory no God hallelujah hallelujah the process of getting to speaking he said believe you have received and you shall receive and when you believe in your karma or if you have aught against any forgive you can't pray with that inside of you when faith is breathable forgiveness so you want to prayer to be answered there's art here there's a grudge here there's something here your code will not hear your prayer you could pray on wireless what God not here in your prayer until you get rid of that [Music] you mean that beloved sure Jesus praising your father prayer forgive them as we forgive those who trespass against us 90 pieces of yogi forgiven if you don't forgive your brother Gordon forgiving you so you pray in God and saying reset I'm going here continue let me interested

you do a combination for humble yourself if you don't humble yourself how many self means you're acknowledging God is a boss you're not in charge you're dependent upon it if you're not how many self
