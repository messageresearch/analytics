tonight Heavenly Father we thank you for your presence and we thank you for this tremendous opportunity that we in this age of overload of knowledge overload of information we could still find this space of rest this place where we could come and hide in the Cliff of the rock where we could be covered in your shadow of under the shadow of the almighty and we could get peace with you and a connection with you and a relation with you father God speak to us tonight this exaltation and as the people get on in prayer may the anointing be with them to inspire them and direct them granted God I commit this session into your hands in jesm I ask it amen and amen God bless you and it's a blessing to be here tonight now if you have your Bibles I like you to turn to James chapter 4 we want to read from 7 to 10 James chapter 4 reading from 7 to 10 the title that I have for tonight's exaltation is submit and resist and it comes right out of James chapter 4 now remember I've said it before many years over the years we don't throw words for people if we have to tell you something that you need to know we will tell you it personally we don't ever use a Pulpit to throw words like we don't know what to say and we're waiting to get the pulpit to beat you in a corner or to say and through things we have never been into that if I have to tell you something I'll tell it to your face I'll tell you direct we don't have to beat around and use the pulpit as a Pulpit a bully pulpit to bully anyone the pulpit as far as I see and this time session is to exal and to speak on the word because the word have life I don't have life the word have life Jesus have life so when we hear the word we could draw from the word and get strength if you are weak tonight the word could give you strength if you're low tonight you're sick tonight the word could heal you the word itself is what God released unto us to have power so James 4 and this is what we're about to read is the word verse seven said submit yourselves therefore to God so I have a one under submit resist the devil and he will flee to you that would resist that comes number two draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you draw nigh becomes number three cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts he double-minded we have a for and cleanse your hands be afflicted five and mourn six and weep seven let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to heaviness and you have up to eight humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up so if you reason in the order that we stated you have submit resist draw nigh cleanse your hands be afflicted mourn weep humble yourselves now in the Amplified it says this be subject to God resist the devil stand firm against him and he will flee from you come close to God and he will come close to you recognize that you are sinners get your so Hands Clean realize that you have been disloyal wavering individuals with divided interest and purify your hearts of your spiritual adultery as you drain near To God Be deeply penitent and grieve even weep over your disloyalty let your laughter be turned to grief and your merth to dejection and heartfelt shame for your sins humble yourselves feeling very and this humbly yourself is feeling very insignificant in the presence of the Lord and He will exalt you he will lift you up and make your lives significant okay let's go a question and answers here but Bram I am saved I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but how do I get away from a stolen spirit that I can't seem to break away from answer well my Christian brother or sister whoever it may be now most times when you find people that got stubborn Spirits it is usually a complex that causes this either they have inherited from father mother Uncle an grandmother grandfather somebody like that and if you trace back down to your life you I have taken this by experience and the discernment because I have met cases on the platform thousands of those that had that Spirit and the first thing you know I will chase that Spirit right back by discernment and find that there's a granddaddy or there was a grandmother there was somebody else back down there and you inherit that by Nature stubborn stubbornness is not of God and now the only way to get away from that is to have you have to have faith to overcome that let me repeat that stubbornness is not of God and now the only way to get away from that you have to have faith to overcome that you are a Christian you are son and daughter of God whichever you may be and you will never be able just to stand and rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke it it is just like tent in a rattlesnake he is laying there ready to bite you and if you just ignore him and walk away from him he can't hurt you so when you feel that you got a stubborn Spirit lay the thing on the Altar and believe God that the thing is dead and you will never have it no more and go on and don't even pay any attention to it no more and the thing will leave you resist the devil he will flee from you that is get away quickly so that would be my advice how to overcome it we overcome the Devil by faith that is what we overcome all all evil by is by faith so I hope that that question and answer would help you tonight and realize there are more depth in the word and more depth by the spirit of discernment that we think of and this is a good example because brother BR himself he dealt with these cases by the thousands and could trace them back and see the effect upon the lives of the people so sometime you may be in stuff or whatever and it's something that is dear but you have to know to lay things down you have to know how to walk away from stuff if you haven't listened to the message from Wednesday night I want to encourage you to do so the high priest of your confession because the prophet clearly states you cannot live about above your confession so if you're talking negative talking a set of foolishness about your own self you can't get very far if you say a low a d I ain't going good and whatnot you're talking a devil's language you have to begin to apply and get stronger you have to begin to apply your faith and get muscles you have to begin to do that because God want us to exit ex our fa that we could be built up God don't want with baby Fai you know it come like um a parent was saying you know the child in a lower form form one or standard one um will make small sentences but as they get older you don't want to make those baby sentences they have to begin to grow to make more complex sentences and they have to get the help necessary they have to get the books to read they have to get the understanding that you cannot make come John come and and you know here go Jane and whatnot that could work in standard one but standard four and standard five those baby sentences can no longer work so you have to be able to expand so the the Christian experien is what we had in the early years we have to be stronger now and the only way it could be done is if we get into the practice into the exercise into the push-ups into the lifting the bar which have to be stronger than you to put some pressure on your muscles that's the only way in other words pressure and stress is he help us to exercise our faith what is happening people are not exercising their faith they're letting you know the pressure just take them and crush on it so I trust and that is with help you tonight I want to encourage you to listen back to that message on Wednesday night okay let's continue what you can't have life only to Christ so time going there you can't have life only to Christ but now what does his word do here we go it builds up our spiritual body strong as we commune with him to resist the devil so what is he saying here we have to actually learn and become strong in order to resist the devil now I like how the words were phrased in the scripture the first thing the Bible exal is to submit yourself what is this going in okay here what it says here first thing submit yourselves therefore to God and then it said resist the devil because if you want to resist the devil and I read the scripture for you some guys trying to cast out devils and do their own stuff and they not submitted to God we call them jokers and devil jump on them so you cannot try to pulverize the devil overcome the devil and do whatever you think with that devil and you're not in submission to God so the first thing is to ask yourself am I submitted do you know what submission is because you have to be able to submit yourself and humble yourself all right let's continue so brother Bram says here now yes he's the word communion in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God then his body is his word because he's the word and if you abide in me and my communion my word abides in you so in other words your connection with the word give you the strength to build up a strong spiritual body you see how we take tablets zinc and magnesium and and and one a day and and iron and and whatever we take we taking those things to help our body our Natural Body our physical body especially as we get older we want to know that we you know have all the right nutrients and stuff well same similarly in the spiritual realm we have to have the nutrients that give us the strength to stand in this hour so you say we are taught brother Bram to resist the devil he will free from us not to resist is just simply to turn him down just resist him just walk away from it God said a certain thing no matter what he's trying to tell you don't even listen to him you have cars that you are ears that are death to anything else but what the spirit says amen so praise God so listen to submit means to yield to surrender something for consideration Authority or judgment so depend depending upon what is you get a different context of submission so to Authority willing to yield to authority of another to present something which is to submit is a submit like a presentation for approval or submit a document for approval right so therefore in submit means to acknowledge superiority or decision of another that is what is to submit to submit is also to surrender One Life to divine power God's power to Divine Authority now to resist means to oppose to withstand to strive against something it it means pushing back against like a force pushing back against influence pushing back against Temptation if you are not pushing back you're not resisting I repeat if you are not pushing back you are not resisting if you are not pushing back on influences whether family worthy friends workers or whatever it is you are not resisting you're just playing slide you're just going with the crowd you don't want to hurt nobody you don't want to offend nobody it come like if the the office says we having a small drink and you're not resisting and say I'm a Christian I don't drink if you say that all right they know you have a clear stand if he says nothing they will pass you a glass and you may just sip it you know and whatnot you're not resisting so again like submit that have context so so to fight against something physically or mentally to fight against Temptation or influences to fight against Authority or rules that resistant to withstand something that is harmful that is resistance but and this is a scripture I have here and this is where they were trying to get stuff without submission these guys and this from Acts 19 11 to 17 we're going to read how much time and and God wrot special Miracles by the hands of Paul so that his body were brought into the with unto the sick unto the sick hand cchs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them then certain of the vagabon Jews exorsist took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits in the name of the Lord Jesus so they want Power they want influence they want show off they want to play theel so they had they start to call on evil spirits in the name of the Lord Jesus saying we are JY by Jesus whom Paul preaching they not preaching is what Paul preaching they want to work something there and there were seven sons of one ska a Jew and chief of the priest which did so and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know Paul I know but who are ye and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them overcame them and prevailed against them so they fled out of that house naked and wounded so the spirit get them a good licking the spirit they trying to cast out jump on them and handle them and the verse 17 says and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was married oh let's continue almost done Hebrews 13:17 says obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves there are so many Christian and so many people don't want to submit theirself they don't want to submit yourself to order to church order they don't want to sub to the pulpit to the ministry they running their own show they are private operators with their own Revelations and so on they will get burned you you will get burned not they you inside of here who want to operate like that you'll get burned because the ministry is not opposed go didn't put a minister or a pastor there as just like a decoration or like a picture on a wall you put him there as a Watchman to watch over your souls and the Bible speak that listen to this obey them that have the rule over you and yourselves not just to obey but to submit for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you so in other words when God is to call the ministry to give an account of you trust is a good one it's a good report let's read that in the amplifier obey your spiritual leaders and submit to them and this is what they have in the applified continually recognizing their authority over you you see this here this is problematic there are so many Christians don't want to recognize authority authority over them and I could read for you where the Bible exort us to submit to the author ities natural authorities judges you watch your red light and says I feeling led to stop no red light who put that red light day is man put that red light and I obeying man and yeah you break the red light and you get in an accident you got a ticket charge you might even kill somebody in a car accident and whatnot because of your foolishness but the Bible said to submit why there are rules and orders to protect Christians that judges the there for until Ro make the move until the Press come down until all the dramas had to take place that a different thing then we have to resist but as for now what the Bible put over us is to submit ourselves even to the authorities so obey your spiritual leaders submit to them continually recognizing the authority over you this appli to wise too wise who bullheaded and don't want to listen to their husband and figure but they running their own show or whatnot God asking you no question you know God will ask the man or the husband the questions so he have to know what he will give an answer over on a bullhead or a wife who don't want to submit or take the husband leadership and you husbands you have to know where you're taking your wies but if you're not a leader or you don't get empowerment to lead what you're leading them onto all right so I don't mean to go there tonight but just going about Authority so recognizing the authority over you for they are constantly keeping watch over your souls and guarding your spiritual welfare as men who will have to render an account of their trust do your part let them do this with gladness and not with sign and groaning for that would not be Prof for you you ask some that question about this person oh God you're grown because a report not so good Titus 31 says put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to OB magistrates and to be ready for every good work and the last scripture I have here wow almost that scripture big scripture it says this here 1 Peter 55 likewise he younger submit yourselves unto the Elder see the spirit quality not a young person carrying on and their resp no senior person that is that is not right y all of you be subject one to another be clothed with humility for God or God has resist to you know he resist the proud and give grace to the humble so God do actually push back be proud you proud he will fight you he will push you back he will disappoint you he will shame you because of your pride I wish I could hear some amens I can't hear no amens I can't hear anything is a one traffic a one way thing here tonight God do resist the proud and give grace to the humble humble yourself therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time and this in the this is the last quote we have here likewise you who are younger and of lesser rank be subject to the elders you see this so when you want to compete or there are competitors who figure you're at the same level and whatnot you're deceiving your own self that is a level of self-deception God have Rank and God have order and structure he doesn't have the moon Fe left to be the brightest thing in in the sky the sun will St in the day the moon had to St in the night God have things set up that way and we can't change that so he said likewise you are younger and of lesser rank be subject to the elders the ministers the spiritual Guides of the church giv them due respect and yielding to their counsel clothe or apron yourselves all of you with humility as the G of a servant so that its covering cannot possibly be stripped from you with freedom from Pride oh I feel good about that tonight with freedom from pride and arrogance towards one another but God sets himself against the proud the insolent the overbearing the disdainful the presumptuous the boastful he opposes frustrates and defeats them but gives grace and favor to the humble therefore humble yourselves demote lower yourselves in your own estimation under the might hand of God that in due time he may exalt you so God call us to submit and to resist you will be a weak Christian and stay a weak Christian if you find yourself devil beating you up there's no resisting power and is because you're not really submitting you are saying pray for me but you are not willing to submit yourself what you need is a inoculation of the Holy Ghost when the nurse come in the needle or the doctor come with the needle or the pastor come with the needle you fly out the room because the needle get you frightened but what the needle has is a inoculation against sin and to strengthen whatever white Capel or whatever blood cells to fight the disease that is what that is for so the holy ghost or the baptism of the Holy Ghost is supposed to be a inoculation that gives you a greater sense of resistance against the enemy now we all born in CIP iniquity we are finished to begin with we don't stand a chance but God rich in Mercy give us this opportunity to say by I'm heal let the we say I'm strong to be empowered to be effective ow you have to clear grounds you cannot say I am weak you cannot say I'm struggling what is that what is that if people in Ukraine under bombs and right now I hear over a million people have no current do you Trinidad because Russia P some missil on them and and blow up the all the what leg thing and they have no current and right it's win time across the just in case you don't know it's win time you we have rain a rainfall and people B like going drunk but they have winter time across it real cold so I'm saying then in the world today from another perspective people seeing great Horrors we don't have that we have ly laziness laia have need of nothing throw and all of that and go trying to knock that off in order you could access him draw nigh unto me I will draw nigh onto you you resist the devil and he not going to walk away he will flee flee is the bolt but if he not getting no resistance he figure he could come nearer he could figure you could you could give him a cup of coffee and all if he ask to make one because you not resisting him you an encouraging him just now his his coffee and cake so so so so you have to show God that you mean business you have to show God that you really want this reality you not want to say God help me now oh God help you can't pray because you're lazy you can't pray because you don't want to repent you can't pray because you're proud it take humility to say I need help I want to repeat that it it takes humility to say I'm sorry it takes humility to say help me it takes humility to say I really don't know what I'm supposed to do would you pray that God send get his mind that I could know it it takes humility to admit that you're wrong and you're off people don't talk that they like to talk Mountain Top talk on top the mountain uh to bless to be stressed all the catchphrases and whatnot and that is irrelevant into the kingdom of the devil working day laughing at all of that because you're stressed you're stressed because you're not submitting you're stressed because you're not overcoming but overcoming keeps life in you and I'm no big of drama you know you have to overcome in Little Things the big things coming to overcome but you have to start somewhere start on new stop criticizing others stop trying to pull down others stop blaming others and begin to deal with you look in the mirror of the word and ask yourself am I seeing the writing to my husband to my children to the worker to my neighbor to Brethren am I being negative there are some people are negative Bas so they will always see half empty next person positive Bas say the class are full and you'll always get that coming out of the lips of the mouth what are you saying what are you telling yourself what are you asking yourself you trying to hurt you or trying to help you you trying to bring you down or you trying to pull you off trying to beat you or we trying to take authority over you what is our objective what is our motive what is my motive tonight of sharing these things with you submit and resist resist the devil he shall flee if he flee it he may come back you know but he flee might take off like a bullet you got space but some of you not resisting you need to submit you need to surrender you need to put up your hand and say I surrender you see when you're under war and pressure and you prob the White Flag it means you give up you have to put up the white flag and say Lord I commit my life into their hands I give up I try I fail I fail miserably but now I'm surrendering to you lead me and guide me let's bow our heads heavenly father I thank you tonight God for this word your word is real you said cleanse your hands you said submit yourself you said resist to death you said cry you said weep mourn humble yourself God may this be us tonight nobody else in our room in all space we want to apply this word to our hearts and and may it come out right we want to admit how much we need you we need your leadership we need your guidance we need Humble Hearts Lord strip us of ourselves I commit this time of prayer into your hands May the anointing fill the homes of your people may anointing fill their minds and their lives God I shared with them concerning stubbornness and certain traits that we have and brother BR he said you can't rebuke it rebuke it rebuke it it's not going to work that way so some some of the stuff we have to deal with takes a different approach help us Lord to have that mindset that will adjust our thinking and submit what has been revealed this last day as to how to deal with our own individual cases bless them open up to Minds give them Revelation vision and inspiration that this word is true this word is real and this would have power granted God in Jesus I ask it heal the sick in our midst strengthen the feeble needes those that need to speak right Inspire them tonight in their prayer that they will say the right thing don't talk about they weak don't talk about their struggles but say Lord you're going to provide you're going to make a way I'm going to be strengthened I'm going to exercise my faith May begin tonight to the hearts and lives of your people in Jesus I ask ask it amen and amen so God bless you Saints I trust them that these few words would be an encouragement to you and that it will inspire you as they get down in prayer that God will truly speak to your heart so God bless you as we get down in prayer praise the Lord [Music] [Music] h [Music] h [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] h [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

against the five senses against the FES senses of the flesh the senses of the spirit a fight a battle every single day we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against against principalities and Powers father God look at those who are sick you know M look at those who need a touch from you the heaven dropped down father we see it we see it through the prophet he saw hell on the Earth and Heaven came down when those angels came down to bring all the Seven Seals to release the anointing to release the power to receive the blessing of God upon the people and it was released in word form it was released on books and tapes it was released in the form of promises and now these promises are about to come alive these promises are about to be manifest these promises are about to Made Real help us Lord that we wouldn't give up we wouldn't let go we wouldn't turn back like when the children came to Kish Bia father and it was in a terrible condition and negativity and we cannot take it
