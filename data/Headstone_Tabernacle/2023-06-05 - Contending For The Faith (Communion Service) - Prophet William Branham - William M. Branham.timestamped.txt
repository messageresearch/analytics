[27:22] [Music]
[27:42] service we have a tape for you this
[27:45] evening entitled contending for the
[27:48] faith amen from God's Prophet William
[27:51] Marin Branham so God bless you as they
[27:53] get ready to put that on I mean you may
[27:55] have your seats now at this time amen
[27:57] let's put it on God bless you amen
[28:05] we do not
[28:07] we can do anything
[28:10] as our ministers Ministry doesn't
[28:12] feature Divine Healing but we believe in
[28:14] Divine Healing because it's the Gospels
[28:17] and no man can heal anyone healing
[28:21] doesn't lay in the power of man
[28:23] healingly in the power of God
[28:26] and God doesn't give man power to heal
[28:29] God only gave Christ the
[28:33] the commission to come to the Earth to
[28:36] die in our state for our sins and our
[28:39] sickness the scripture said he was
[28:40] wounded for our transgressions with his
[28:42] stripes we were were at the past tense
[28:46] we were healed and we believe that Upon
[28:50] Our confession our faith for Jesus our
[28:54] high priest has died and rose again to
[28:58] take away sin from the world
[29:00] and is sitting at the right hand of God
[29:03] the Father they are making intercessions
[29:05] Upon Our confession
[29:08] and when he died for our sins he could
[29:12] not die for sins without dying for
[29:14] sickness sickness is an attribute of sin
[29:18] now maybe you haven't sinned is what
[29:20] causes you to be sick but it was a cause
[29:23] of sin in the first place that brought
[29:26] sickness to the world
[29:28] before we ever had any sin we had no
[29:31] sickness but when sickness came in sin
[29:33] is an attribute and now you cannot deal
[29:36] with sin in any way without dealing with
[29:39] sickness or ever attribute that sin
[29:41] produced
[29:42] sin when we deal with sin we deal with
[29:44] death when we deal in sickness there is
[29:47] a the first stage of death when sickness
[29:50] takes your body in a night like this one
[29:53] little gathering two days notice for you
[29:56] people to come out and gather in the
[29:57] building tonight
[30:00] it would be hard to try to go into
[30:02] detail which we would and campaigns
[30:04] where we're lasting for weeks and weeks
[30:06] to explain what is thickness where does
[30:09] it come from there has been nothing but
[30:11] what there's a reason for and there's a
[30:13] cause and you can't find a cure until
[30:16] you find a Cause
[30:19] I was staying here not long ago if I
[30:21] went to a doctor I'm certainly not
[30:23] against doctors surgeons operations
[30:25] hospitals they're all God's planes but
[30:29] if I went to a doctor and told him I was
[30:31] having a persistent headache
[30:33] give me a aspirin say now run along
[30:35] Billy this will be
[30:37] all right that man aged me off see he
[30:40] the old a real doctor would diagnose
[30:42] lactation see what was wrong with me
[30:44] then he'd get to the bottom where it's
[30:46] at and then start working from there
[30:48] well now that's the way we had to work
[30:51] in Divine Healing or in Salvation for
[30:54] the soul if a man comes and says that
[30:56] he's Disturbed greatly about his his
[30:58] salvation the first thing to do you
[31:00] ministers do you go right down the line
[31:02] do you find back here or he sidestepped
[31:04] or what happened from there you bring it
[31:06] up that's the same thing it is in Divine
[31:08] Healing which Divine meaning is not some
[31:11] power that God has given to a man
[31:14] healing lays alone in the atonement I
[31:18] want to ask you something because I know
[31:19] there's ministers here from the
[31:21] different churches and
[31:24] how would you preach salvation for the
[31:27] soul the only things you could not say
[31:29] we say well I was converted brother
[31:31] Branham I was saved 10 years ago I was
[31:34] saved 20 years ago no that's a mistake
[31:37] you accepted it maybe 10 or 20 years ago
[31:39] but you were saved 1900 years ago when
[31:42] Jesus died of Calvary he settled a sin
[31:45] question forever there that's where he
[31:47] paid the Supreme prize made the great
[31:51] sacrifice that through his death of
[31:53] Calvary then we have rights of Salvation
[31:57] the price is paid so it isn't what you
[31:59] do it's what he does and your personal
[32:02] faith has to accept that brings your
[32:05] salvation and now that he was wounded
[32:08] for our transgressions with his stripes
[32:10] we were healed so if I've often made
[32:12] this statement that you couldn't um
[32:15] that you could not by any means uh if a
[32:18] serpent or some animal had his paw in my
[32:22] side and was cut into my side and
[32:24] killing me there's no need to be trying
[32:25] to cut his palm just to hit him in the
[32:28] head kill his head he kills the whole
[32:30] body
[32:31] well that's the way it is
[32:33] when Jesus dealt with sickness or sin of
[32:38] Calvary he has to deal with the head of
[32:41] it which was sin and doing so he dealt
[32:44] with sickness with it he didn't have to
[32:46] cut off the call he just killed the head
[32:49] and take care of the rest of it so Jesus
[32:52] come to bring to the human race
[32:54] everything that Adam's race was Adam's
[32:58] sin destroyed and the Garden of Eden and
[33:01] now we have the attributes are the
[33:04] earnest of our
[33:06] Eternal salvation as we accept Christ as
[33:08] our savior our crisis our healer we have
[33:11] those
[33:13] earnest money of our entire Redemption
[33:16] when he comes we're attempting all of us
[33:19] are tempted all of us sin there's none
[33:22] without sin every day you see Paul said
[33:25] he had to Die daily and if we say we sin
[33:28] and have no sin then the Bible says we
[33:29] make God that's alive and we could not
[33:32] do that so we sin daily and it's Grace
[33:35] God's grace that saves us and as we
[33:37] confess our loans God's just to forgiven
[33:40] and your your confession as long as it
[33:43] holds Good your salvation is perfect
[33:45] same as it with Divine Healing it's your
[33:48] personal faith and a resurrected Lord
[33:50] Jesus so tonight I thought I would just
[33:53] inherit this little time of fellowship
[33:55] with you and
[33:57] in this place where all churches can
[34:00] this little group of people can just
[34:01] gather together here and the little city
[34:04] of Georgetown and we personally want to
[34:08] be thankful to the Brother Art and
[34:10] Wright and those who made this possible
[34:12] we want to thank the school board for
[34:14] letting us have this gym room tonight
[34:16] for this service and I want to thank
[34:18] every minister of the chair and every
[34:20] member of any church whether it is
[34:23] Protestant Catholic whether it is
[34:25] orthodox a Jew whatever it may be we're
[34:28] grateful for you to be here and want you
[34:31] to know that we've got no strains or no
[34:33] attachments on anyone's religion
[34:35] whatever you believe as long as you
[34:36] believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and
[34:38] he's your savior you're my brother and
[34:40] sister and so that's the way we believe
[34:42] it and now we had his blessed word here
[34:46] before us now these any man that's able
[34:48] to to pull that back to his fingers
[34:51] could open it this way but there's no
[34:53] man can open the book to understanding
[34:55] except Christ
[34:58] the Bible was written by inspiration
[35:01] therefore shall we just our head the
[35:03] moment to speak to the author before we
[35:05] open his book
[35:08] Our Kind Heavenly Father we have
[35:11] gathered here in the name of God beloved
[35:13] Son the Lord Jesus who died freely for
[35:16] our sins and trespasses
[35:18] he died that he might save us from a
[35:21] life of sin and would take us home to
[35:24] Heaven some glorious day at his coming
[35:27] he died also that by Stripes that we
[35:30] might be healed of our sickness
[35:32] and he was wounded for our
[35:33] transgressions his bruised for our
[35:35] iniquity the chasmine of our peace was
[35:38] up on him and with his stripes we were
[35:40] healed saith the prophet
[35:43] now we pray thee heavenly father to be
[35:45] merciful to us
[35:47] and that we just had this one night of
[35:50] gathering here in this city
[35:54] we pray that you'll bless those who has
[35:56] made this possible for the Gathering
[35:58] and also those who have gathered with us
[36:00] the fellowship around the word
[36:05] and we pray father that you'll bless
[36:07] everyone that's in divine presence also
[36:10] and may it be a night to Long be
[36:12] remembered
[36:14] may it be a night like the apostolic
[36:16] Gathering of Days of Gold
[36:19] when people gather together little
[36:22] groups one night while the Saint Paul
[36:25] was preaching way into the night a young
[36:27] man we're taught fell from the epistory
[36:29] and his life was taken from him and Paul
[36:32] laid his body over the boy
[36:34] God gave him back his life we're
[36:38] thankful to have the same gospel tonight
[36:39] to preach to the people that God still
[36:42] lives and Reigns he
[36:44] he's sick he forgives all of our sins
[36:47] and father we pray tonight it's your
[36:49] blessed as a people
[36:51] and now thou has said in our humble word
[36:54] this if you ask the father anything in
[36:56] my name I'll do it
[36:58] he believed that what we ask we receive
[37:00] because it's according to his word and
[37:02] when we leave here tonight in different
[37:05] groups and going to our different homes
[37:08] will you visit us in such a way that
[37:11] we'll have a testimony in our heart and
[37:13] our conversation as we leave here will
[37:16] be like those who came from Emmaus on
[37:19] the first resurrection when they had met
[37:21] the resurrected Lord Jesus for the first
[37:24] time they said do not our hearts burn
[37:27] within us when he talked to us by the
[37:29] way may you talk to every heart tonight
[37:31] for we ask it in the name of God beloved
[37:34] Son the Lord Jesus amen
[37:42] open to the gospel of Saint Jude in the
[37:47] Bible which is only one
[37:49] book one chapter and then the third
[37:53] verse of this chapter I wish to read for
[37:57] just a little text to get a context from
[37:59] it for what I'd like to speak on for the
[38:01] next few moments then we will pray for
[38:04] the sake
[38:07] I gave all Jones
[38:10] are the common
[38:14] common to you and to exalt you that you
[38:17] should earnestly contend for the faith
[38:20] once delivered unto the Saints
[38:23] may the Lord add His blessings to his
[38:25] word
[38:26] this was wrote some 33 years after the
[38:30] day of Pentecost I said the reporting
[38:33] out of the Holy Spirit on the early
[38:34] Saints
[38:36] Jude
[38:38] calls himself a servant and brother to
[38:40] Jesus Christ
[38:42] and he wrote this book to the church and
[38:44] told them that they should earnestly
[38:47] contend the only patience sacred riding
[38:50] that's ever told us to contend because
[38:52] we're not supposed to have contentions
[38:54] among us but the earnestly contend for a
[38:58] purpose of faith that was once delivered
[39:02] unto the Saints
[39:03] and that we're not too content and we're
[39:06] not trying to contend but we are wanting
[39:09] to face this
[39:12] if I should ask tonight how many
[39:14] methodists is in the crowd how many
[39:15] Baptists was in the crowd how many
[39:17] nazarenes Pilgrim holding this Catholic
[39:19] to be hands growth and even this little
[39:21] group of people here tonight there will
[39:24] be many hands go up
[39:25] and each one of us in our different
[39:27] denominations would want to say our
[39:30] church was continuing for that faith
[39:32] that was once delivered to the Saints
[39:36] Dr Baptist Church and someone else you
[39:39] want to say it about the Methodist
[39:40] Church someone else about the Catholic
[39:42] church and some other about it would be
[39:44] that way in the little groups of people
[39:46] now I want to believe that we're all
[39:49] contending for that pain I believe that
[39:51] everyone is contending for the best of
[39:54] their knowledge to the faith but in this
[39:57] thing so many different denominations
[39:58] there's got to be something right and
[40:01] something wrong now that's the way I try
[40:04] to be my brother sister that there's you
[40:08] never seen a man Drop in sober at the
[40:10] same time you never seen a black white
[40:12] bird there's no such a thing and there's
[40:15] no right wrong mixed together it's
[40:17] either right or it's wrong and that's
[40:20] the way that I believe God if I didn't
[40:23] believe that he was the same God that
[40:26] lived in the days of Moses if he wasn't
[40:29] the same God to fulfill every promise
[40:32] that he made then I couldn't have faith
[40:34] to accept it
[40:36] now there's only that's only sensible
[40:40] and reasonable to think that what good
[40:43] would it do us tonight you're not here
[40:46] just to be seen you wouldn't come out
[40:47] this ring together in a little place
[40:49] like this just to be seen you're here
[40:51] for one purpose that's it find something
[40:54] good and I pray that God will give each
[40:56] one of you something real good that
[40:58] you'll never forget and each one of you
[41:01] Christians made me raise your joy to him
[41:04] to cause you to serve him better than
[41:06] you've ever served him and all your life
[41:09] now what good would it do to serve a God
[41:14] that served Moses
[41:16] a God that Moses served and if he wasn't
[41:19] the same God today what group would he
[41:22] do to serve a historical God if you know
[41:25] if he's powerless and gone and dead
[41:27] today I want to answer that question
[41:30] you would want to do it
[41:32] maybe at all
[41:33] if I can serve a God that's a living
[41:36] invite your presence to help me when I
[41:38] have need say what to use the serving
[41:40] God
[41:41] if he was a God but he isn't a God now
[41:44] or if he was a god of power he's lost
[41:46] his power now there's something
[41:48] weakening about that God isn't that
[41:51] right now we want to reason together
[41:54] there's something wrong if it isn't if
[41:57] he was and he is but now then there's
[41:59] something wrong with God
[42:02] if if God doesn't agree might be a
[42:06] warrior and battle and he was a great
[42:08] healer of the diseases and he was a
[42:11] great in all this tribute in the days
[42:13] gone by and then he's lost all of his
[42:15] power and he isn't the same today yet
[42:17] his word says He is the same today
[42:20] promise you do the very same thing
[42:22] through all ages until he come again
[42:24] it's undisputable in the Bible
[42:27] Hebrews did 8 13 a 13 8 whether says
[42:30] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[42:33] today and forever that's the same in
[42:35] principle the same in power the same and
[42:38] Resurrection the same and ominous the
[42:41] same and omnipresence the famous and and
[42:44] all he's just the same as he was in
[42:47] everything that he once was he is today
[42:49] the Church says that's true all things
[42:53] of him is the same now
[42:56] so if we each want to believe that but
[42:59] yet limited to a Creed well they say
[43:02] I'll go to the Baptist Church I'll say
[43:04] Baptist because that's the church I was
[43:05] already in say I uh well the Baptist
[43:08] over our Creed's right the methodists
[43:10] were still Creed right but if we live a
[43:13] God that Creed I have nothing against it
[43:15] that's all right but if we limit God to
[43:17] that Creed then we limit God and we try
[43:20] to say that you can walk this far maybe
[43:22] we don't have the faith to walk where
[43:24] Enoch did when he took a little walk
[43:26] with God one afternoon and went home
[43:28] with him without death and um and the
[43:31] barcel of Joshua who marched around the
[43:33] walls of Jericho 13 times and and shot
[43:36] it real loud and the walls fell down we
[43:38] may not have the faith to shut down
[43:41] walls we may not have faith to walk home
[43:43] with God but let's not stand in
[43:45] somebody's way who does have that faith
[43:47] if it doesn't agree with our truth and
[43:49] they ask Faith let's move right on and
[43:51] please say the Lord bless you my brother
[43:53] and though I don't regardless of what
[43:55] church he belongs to that's makes no
[43:57] difference as long as he's a Christian
[43:58] and believer and do you know Christian
[44:00] friends that's what the world wanted to
[44:02] see today I landed in Bombay India where
[44:05] I had the largest crowd of 500 000
[44:07] people I I was the Crowder Ever preached
[44:09] to him at one time in my life was in
[44:12] Bombay one on that there here comes the
[44:14] bishop of the Methodist Church and many
[44:16] of the Great churches right from the
[44:18] Archbishop it's a Hindu hinduist Church
[44:20] there and many others are great
[44:22] outstanding churches they met me out
[44:23] there where thousands of people come to
[44:25] the airport and when they come and they
[44:27] taught me after the Taj Mahjong hotel
[44:28] and they met in a room similar to this
[44:30] with all the celebrity the city in the
[44:33] ray jaws and everything and the bishop
[44:36] of the Methodist Church he said brother
[44:38] random we don't accept you as a
[44:40] missionary he said because we don't want
[44:42] to hear the word missionary but because
[44:45] you people in the West
[44:48] with your Western education does not
[44:50] understand the scripture in the light of
[44:53] an oriental book
[44:54] and that's true with all of our theology
[44:57] if you ever go to Jerusalem or to the
[44:59] Eastern country where this Bible is
[45:01] written it's a brand new book to you all
[45:04] Western ideas are far from the Eastern
[45:07] ways you can't understand The Parables
[45:10] and so forth the teachings until you go
[45:12] there and see those same customs lived
[45:14] out today and many people would say I
[45:18] have nothing against seminars and
[45:19] students and monasteries and so forth
[45:21] but all of that will never know God it's
[45:23] only known catechism and so forth like
[45:26] that to know what God is to know the
[45:28] person
[45:29] Christ himself and to know him is life
[45:33] not to know your textbook or to know
[45:35] your Creed or to know your catechism
[45:37] isn't life it's to know Christ the
[45:39] person is life eternal and that's what
[45:42] we wish to know now this bishop
[45:45] Stephanie he's irrelevantage of
[45:47] theologist that we had the Bible
[45:50] a thousand seven hundred years before
[45:53] you as a nation that's right Saint
[45:56] Thomas went down in I stood in the
[45:58] church and preached for Saint Thomas the
[45:59] original church that he established in
[46:01] India when he went down from Jerusalem
[46:03] to India and established the church and
[46:06] he said we've had the Bible ever since
[46:08] then and we've had Christianity since
[46:11] then but it's the low end in India and
[46:14] he said we have heard of Dr Reed head
[46:16] the man that came to you which was uh
[46:18] the president of the great
[46:21] Sudan missions the greatest in the world
[46:23] who came to me and he said brother
[46:24] Branham said I've got enough degrees
[46:27] plaster a wall with them after a
[46:30] theology a bachelor's degree in all
[46:33] kinds of degrees since I was about eight
[46:36] years old they said brother Brian where
[46:38] is Christ in all of it he said has the
[46:40] teachers been wrong after the teachers
[46:42] hasn't been wrong sir but what it is
[46:45] that you'll never know Christ's
[46:46] sociology Christ by education you've got
[46:50] to know christbox personally experience
[46:52] for being formed again of his spirit
[46:55] that comes down and changes your life
[46:56] and makes you a new creature in Christ
[46:58] Jesus that's what bears the difference
[47:00] that's what makes the difference and
[47:02] obvious now that's the reason we have so
[47:05] many different denominations in theory
[47:06] they're all all right but the real thing
[47:09] Jesus Christ the son of God said in
[47:11] Saint John The Gospel of Saint John the
[47:13] fourth chapter or third chapter of
[47:14] pardon me the Nicodemus except the man
[47:17] be born again of water and Spirits
[47:23] enter into the kingdom no matter what
[47:26] church you go to that Jesus Christ's own
[47:29] words now to be born means to be
[47:32] delivered from now unless you are
[47:34] delivered by the holy spirit in your
[47:38] life to a new life in Christ
[47:42] are no good but they're good they're all
[47:45] right there of all teachings and so
[47:47] forth which help us but the real
[47:49] personal Christ Jesus
[47:51] and that's what's made the meetings
[47:53] wanted husband today and swept around
[47:54] the world is because by the grace of God
[47:58] to introduce the
[48:02] SE to Jesus right now president and he's
[48:05] saying power that he ever was in
[48:08] fact we don't have to guess at it
[48:10] he said Brothers we have the Bible to be
[48:13] success in India but that what we are
[48:15] interested in is not your theology so
[48:18] what we are interested in has God's
[48:22] visit you Yankees
[48:24] with the spirit or a gift that can make
[48:27] this Bible live in
[48:29] said we know the Bible
[48:32] and said I said well you just admitted
[48:34] we didn't know it but I don't know if
[48:37] you are but I know the author of real
[48:39] well and I said that's the main thing he
[48:41] said that's what we want to know
[48:43] have you faith in us in God to make
[48:45] these Divine promises that he's made for
[48:48] that as you faith in us to make them
[48:50] reality
[48:52] I said by the grace of God God will
[48:55] and that's awesome I was entertained by
[48:57] 17 different religions that denied
[49:00] Christianity some of them worshiped Matt
[49:02] and some of them horses and some cattle
[49:04] and some Buddha and mohawans and so
[49:07] forth and they all have their
[49:08] theologists very good everything was
[49:11] worse not what you have to do do this do
[49:13] that animals no great at all
[49:20] I hope not
[49:22] but notice that night it was
[49:26] when the Lord Jesus came on the scene
[49:28] that's up to Ray Charles on their
[49:30] pillars and so forth and it was over two
[49:32] hours getting into the lineup to where
[49:34] we could get to the speaker stands and
[49:36] when the Lord Jesus came up and told a
[49:38] man that was totally blind for 20 years
[49:41] seeing the vision over him and nobody's
[49:43] going to be here I shallow devil Autumn
[49:45] to come heal the man
[49:53] thousands and thousands of change of
[49:55] Christ at one time
[49:57] there it is it isn't whether our Creeds
[50:00] were
[50:01] working
[50:03] but to reproduce the Lord Jesus and his
[50:06] promise is to know him not your Creed
[50:10] now put this to our patient and I'll try
[50:14] to be just as quick as I possibly can
[50:15] and get the line started cause it's
[50:17] midweek and you people work
[50:19] now Elizabeth
[50:21] tonight beloved I gave all them just to
[50:25] write unto you are the common salvation
[50:27] this is Saint Jude now right into the
[50:30] church 33 years after Pentecost
[50:33] and exhausting you that you should
[50:36] earnestly contend for the faith not a
[50:40] face the face that was once delivered
[50:43] unto the Saints now each one of us in
[50:45] our churches we are fine and I want you
[50:47] to be with your church and support your
[50:49] church and help it uh for the glory of
[50:52] God but now let's go back and find out
[50:54] now there's got to be something
[51:01] that was once delivered to the saints
[51:03] that was surely some way of knowing what
[51:06] we face was
[51:08] now
[51:09] let's go back in the Bible I think that
[51:12] would be logical and proof enough to all
[51:15] of us if we go back and see what the
[51:17] Saints what what kind of Faith they had
[51:20] and if we were exhausted to earnestly
[51:23] contend for this faith we find out what
[51:25] kind of Faith they have where we are to
[51:27] continue
[51:30] now we'll find out we'll find out what
[51:33] before they were ever called Saints in
[51:35] the Bible there was in the New Testament
[51:37] John the Baptist come between the law
[51:39] and Christ which was a gap of the
[51:42] Keystone that locked the two different
[51:43] stations together now we'd have to begin
[51:46] with Christ if we're going to talk about
[51:48] Christian faith because he is the
[51:51] beginning of Christian faith John King
[51:54] John the Baptist preaching the
[51:56] Wilderness of Judea and we've never done
[51:58] one Miracle never done any sign but he
[52:01] just condemned the churches and
[52:03] condemned the priests and the red eyes
[52:05] and so forth and told him I was cunning
[52:07] one and as the baptism of service when
[52:10] he was baptizing he saw Jesus coming
[52:12] with the light following him and he said
[52:14] Behold the Lamb of God will take away
[52:16] the sin of the world and Jesus is
[52:18] baptized the Holy Spirit pays him out of
[52:20] heaven and The Voice come and saying
[52:22] this is my beloved Son in whom I am
[52:25] pleased to dwell the original
[52:27] translation says in whom I am dwell in
[52:31] the world
[52:32] himself he was God in flesh now
[52:36] now let's notice what type of life that
[52:38] he did and I want to ask you for
[52:40] something you people as we're talking
[52:43] what he was then
[52:45] he should be if that's the faith that he
[52:47] introduced to the world that ought to be
[52:50] the faith that we should contend for us
[52:52] tonight is that right that's right it
[52:54] should be all right now we noticed as
[52:56] soon as he started off in his ministry
[52:58] we'll watch what kind of a Ministry he
[53:01] has we'll start from the first chapter
[53:03] of Saint Luke according it by memory you
[53:05] might read it when you wish to
[53:07] so in the first chapter it teaches that
[53:10] Jesus began to ruled out doing good for
[53:13] the people he would pray for the sick
[53:15] and they'd be healed now that's one of
[53:17] the things that he did pray for the sake
[53:20] and one day now listen to us now because
[53:22] it'll if you do not listen close to
[53:24] catch every word it'll be a stumbling
[53:26] back to you in the next 20 or 30 minutes
[53:28] when the prayer line starts
[53:30] see now listen close the first thing we
[53:33] find Jesus doing after he had chose two
[53:35] or three of his Apostles and one of his
[53:37] name was um
[53:43] and when he seen and knew that that
[53:45] wasn't Messiah because he saw his
[53:47] prayers for people and them getting well
[53:49] he went over around about 30 miles
[53:53] around behind the mountains of Judea and
[53:57] he found his friend whose name is
[53:58] Nathaniel and Nathanael is under a tree
[54:01] praise
[54:03] and he said come see who I have found
[54:05] Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and
[54:09] he said for any good thing come out of
[54:11] Nazareth Nathaniel said he says come see
[54:13] now I think that's the best answer that
[54:16] any persons could give at any time
[54:18] is before criticizing anything come and
[54:22] see it first
[54:24] look at yourself
[54:26] Lord in the light of the Bible
[54:29] no matter what it seems like and what
[54:31] others say the religion of Jesus Christ
[54:33] has never been popular
[54:37] because the world knows its own see and
[54:41] you're not of the world when you become
[54:43] a Christian you are a different person
[54:45] from the world we know that Jesus said I
[54:48] pray father that may not be of the world
[54:50] so you are not of the world the world
[54:53] the Bible says if you love the world are
[54:56] the things of the world the love of
[54:58] God's not even in you the scripture says
[55:01] that so you can't love two masters Jesus
[55:04] said you can't love God and Mammon the
[55:07] word Mammon is translated means the
[55:09] world and he said to either serve one
[55:12] and hate the other are Vice of Mercy
[55:14] Jesus said that's the same Matthew the
[55:17] fifth chapter Faith served the God and
[55:19] the world at the same time you've got to
[55:20] be one or the other and God have mercy
[55:24] that's what's the matter with our people
[55:25] it is all Christian in this this nation
[55:27] they're trying to live like the world
[55:30] and profess to be Christians and that's
[55:32] the reason the unbeliever outside has
[55:35] such a hard time to make up his mind is
[55:37] because he sees people that call them
[55:39] suspicions live no different than the
[55:41] rest of the world that's pretty fresh
[55:43] but that's truth we got to face truth
[55:45] there's probably many women sitting here
[55:47] I'll never see again until I see you at
[55:49] the judgment and I've got to be truthful
[55:52] and honest because I've got to face the
[55:54] judgment and meet my words again as a
[55:56] judgment so I have to be truthful about
[55:58] it now we noticed that that Philip as
[56:02] soon as he found Nathaniel he said come
[56:04] see who I have found and the same will
[56:07] be the righteous man a good man he said
[56:09] could there be any good thing come out
[56:11] of Nazareth Nazareth is a mean Wicked
[56:13] City very bad Outlaws gangsters and so
[56:16] forth raised up and and had outlawed
[56:19] bands in those days that come out of
[56:21] mass with very vile City
[56:31] Presbyterian or whatever Church it may
[56:33] be the first thing to do is come and
[56:37] find out now examine it not by your
[56:41] ritual not by the catechism not by one
[56:44] advantage
[56:47] or the Bible says that he's at a perfect
[56:50] way to add to anything that's in this
[56:52] book God will take his name out of The
[56:54] Book of Life
[56:55] for Revelation 21st chapter says that he
[56:59] will do that the 22nd chapter rather of
[57:01] the last book of the Bible
[57:12] and he'll be destroyed so we mistake
[57:15] exactly with what the scriptures has got
[57:17] to say now when he found Nathanael and
[57:20] he he said come see so he followed him
[57:22] now let's watch what kind of a man Jesus
[57:24] was now if we wanted to find Jesus
[57:27] tonight if we went if somebody told us
[57:30] Jesus Christ was in Georgetown Indiana
[57:32] what and he was in human flesh Like We
[57:35] Are Tonight what type of a person would
[57:37] we want to find now this may be shopping
[57:47] just like other man there's no
[57:50] difference in his dress for we come to
[57:52] find man that was um that was great
[57:55] forceful speakers
[57:57] graceful speakers no the Bible says not
[58:00] even be heard in the streets when we
[58:02] come to find a man that was a great
[58:04] poster of his great church until no sir
[58:06] the Bible spoke very different of him
[58:09] saying there's a man of sorrow and a
[58:10] queen with grief he wasn't a great fairy
[58:13] owner or blonde he was a humble man and
[58:15] he was oh he does will they find him
[58:18] among the rich people he never dwelt
[58:20] with the rich people for the design
[58:22] you'd find him among the poor he went
[58:25] down on the river and found fishermen
[58:27] think of the great Orthodox church with
[58:29] all her great priests and high priests
[58:31] and a great grammar and glory in that
[58:33] day and not one time that any Apostle or
[58:36] any man of God ever visited or accepted
[58:39] when God sent his son he sent him away
[58:42] from it and he certainly told him that
[58:44] they were in hypocrisy and told them how
[58:47] bad they were and everything that they
[58:48] said he has the devil because he don't
[58:50] even believe in our church see and they
[58:52] were the Church of the nation so you see
[58:54] you can't go by church you've got to go
[58:56] by God that's where you head and but
[58:59] Christ now when Nathaniel came up in the
[59:02] Lord I will see what he found he found a
[59:04] man standing there doing something
[59:05] contrary to what the church's teaching
[59:07] the church thought that the days of
[59:09] Miracles was passed but whoever Jesus
[59:11] sending that performance I don't care
[59:13] where you're at just raise up your hand
[59:15] say God for this I want you to heal me
[59:17] God thank you
[59:18] that's not just about General everywhere
[59:20] I'll tell you what you do I told you
[59:23] that Jesus Christ the son of God is here
[59:26] in the form of the spirit of God is that
[59:30] right how many Christians believe that
[59:33] let's see your hands that's fine and if
[59:36] he is sure and he's the same Lord Jesus
[59:39] they've been stopped his duty down to do
[59:42] the same thing is that right now he said
[59:45] he couldn't heal the father showed him
[59:47] and he did what the father said is that

[1:11:40] that the Lord Jesus
[1:11:42] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:11:44] took bread
[1:11:47] and when he had given thanks he broke it
[1:11:49] and said take eat
[1:11:52] this is my buddy which is broken for you
[1:11:55] this do in remembrance of me
[1:11:59] after the same manner also he took the
[1:12:01] cup when he had stopped saying this
[1:12:05] copies the New Testament in my blood
[1:12:08] this Duty as often as he drink it
[1:12:11] in remembrance of me

[1:12:23] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:12:25] this cup of the Lord unworthily
[1:12:28] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:12:31] the Lord
