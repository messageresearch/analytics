[53:58] God walking in the garden in the cool of
[54:01] the day and Adam and his wife hid
[54:04] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[54:05] God amongst the trees of the garden and
[54:10] the Lord called unto Adam and said unto
[54:13] Him where art thou and he said I have
[54:17] heard thy voice in the garden and I was
[54:19] afraid because I was naked and I hid
[54:23] myself and he said who told me that thou
[54:28] was naked has thou eaten of the tree
[54:31] whereof I commanded thee that thou shalt
[54:34] not eat this 23 therefore the Lord God
[54:39] sent him forth from the Garden of Eden
[54:41] to till the ground from whence he was
[54:44] taken so he drove out the man and he
[54:49] placed at the east of the Garden of Eden

[57:04] his name Lord God it's in the word of
[57:08] ill Allah Elohim which means herself
[57:11] existed on and there was nothing else

[57:22] nothing else it was God and God alone
[57:25] thank you around today man what a song

[57:29] is gone but inside of this great Elohim
[57:34] was an attribute let me say this rare
[57:37] nature inside of him was a nature to be
[57:42] a father but he's a self existent there
[57:47] isn't anything for him to be a father to
[57:49] and down inside inside of him there was
[57:53] something else he wanted to be a god a
[57:58] god is an object of worship
[58:00] yet he was self existent a man how could
[58:03] we be God if there was no one to worship
[58:06] Him amen
[58:09] again inside of him he was a savior but
[58:12] there was nothing loss to be saved
[58:14] a man inside of that nature he was a
[58:19] healer but there was nothing sick to be
[58:21] healed can we say man glory to God if he

[1:20:06] two things happen they lost the
[1:20:11] requirement to access God's prison
[1:20:13] so all fellowship was cut off on their
[1:20:16] side
[1:20:17] the second thing God Himself no matter
[1:20:23] how much he wants to he cannot
[1:20:26] fellowship outside of holiness that's
[1:20:30] just who he is
[1:20:31] it's his nature he is constrained by his
[1:20:35] own law a man a man brother outside of
[1:20:42] Calvary this is probably one of the
[1:20:45] saddest scenes in the Bible
[1:20:49] Jehovah excitedly coming down looking
[1:20:52] desperately for his children come on
[1:20:55] Adam I don't where about I've come to
[1:20:57] have church I've come for fellowship
[1:21:00] Adam you usually have I know where are
[1:21:03] you a man but Adam is hiding brother
[1:21:07] branham said as soon as Adam realized he
[1:21:10] had sinned he should have been running
[1:21:12] through the garden screaming father
[1:21:14] father where doubt but instead it was
[1:21:18] God screaming Adam Adam where the Oh God
[1:21:22] my mercy Lord he said man at no point in
[1:21:28] time or in any age ever sought after God
[1:21:32] it was always God seeking after man are

[1:22:05] lord thank you lord thank you lord
[1:22:10] Adam is afraid first time ever fear
[1:22:15] strikes faith of every man Adam tries
[1:22:22] his own thing to save himself he uses
[1:22:25] fig leaves to cohesin a moral religion
[1:22:28] to cover his sinful nature but when he
[1:22:32] came face-to-face with God do you
[1:22:34] recognize that he was lost his efforts
[1:22:38] were no good his religion could not
[1:22:41] bring him into the perfect fellowship
[1:22:43] with God and God rejected his religion
[1:22:48] because the sin itself was still there
[1:22:51] and God cannot dwell outside of holiness
[1:22:55] can he say man Amen so God has nothing
[1:23:00] to do with religion whatsoever
[1:23:02] religion has nothing to do with God Amen
[1:23:05] hallelujah and God flee is a sheep and
[1:23:11] wraps the skin around them as a
[1:23:14] temporary covering but he had already
[1:23:17] given them his world and he is
[1:23:21] constrained by his old world because the
[1:23:24] world is God amen and the wages of sin
[1:23:28] is death the day you eat dog shall
[1:23:32] surely die amen and Adam died after 930
[1:23:37] years which was less than a thousand
[1:23:39] years or one day he died the same day
[1:23:43] the day that you eat you shall surely
[1:23:47] die
[1:23:50] but it was also a spiritual separation
[1:23:53] which meant separated from God or cut
[1:23:57] off from the presence of God hallelujah
[1:24:01] they lost their claim to eternal life
[1:24:03] and the inheritance and life itself
[1:24:06] praise

[1:52:57] he saw how big God is he saw his
[1:53:00] holiness he saw him high and lifted up
[1:53:03] and immediately isaiah became so aware
[1:53:08] of his wretchedness his sinfulness his
[1:53:13] unholiness his righteousness became as
[1:53:17] filthy rags before the lord's presence
[1:53:20] by Isaiah cry out who owes me for I am
[1:53:25] undone I am a man of unclean lips Lord
[1:53:29] the people are also unclean yet Bob Arum

[1:54:43] begin to confess the sin and you tell
[1:54:47] him how great he is and how old he is
[1:54:52] and watch the angel of his presence come
[1:54:54] over to you with the coals of fire where
[1:54:57] is God and give you a cleansing
[1:54:59] experience you will never be the same

[1:56:15] to him do you feel that way too small
[1:56:18] do you feel that way too small Jesus he
[1:56:27] said when I got into his presence I
[1:56:29] realized that there was somebody who
[1:56:31] loved the unlovable that's me that's me

[1:59:54] individual what about the church from
[1:59:59] the message plan to divine and a way to
[2:00:00] plant it he says people don't believe in
[2:00:04] Shelton the thing of it is they haven't
[2:00:07] got spiritual joy hallelujah and the
[2:00:12] joys of the waters of life can flow
[2:00:15] through that's a whole lot matter with a
[2:00:18] Branham Tabernacle because of unbelief
[2:00:21] the case of the world had bound the

[2:00:26] growth that's the matter in our nation
[2:00:29] that's the matter with our churches they
[2:00:32] have no joy and the joy of the Lord has
[2:00:34] departed Ichabod in Hebrew which
[2:00:37] actually means a presence of the Lord
[2:00:39] has departed so the Prophet links the
[2:00:42] joy of the Lord with the presence of God
