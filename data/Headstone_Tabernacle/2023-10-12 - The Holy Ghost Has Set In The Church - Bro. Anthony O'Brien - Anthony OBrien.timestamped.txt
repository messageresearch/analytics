[37:51] continue to remember them in your hearts
[37:52] amen as we continue on tonight well
[37:55] praise God we
[37:57] uh thank God for his presence so I have
[38:00] a title tonight amen just for a few
[38:01] moments as we uh earnestly contend for
[38:04] the faith amen I have a title the Holy
[38:07] Ghost has set in the church that's my
[38:10] title tonight amen the Holy Ghost has
[38:14] set in the church amen and I'm taking
[38:17] that directly out of that quote that we
[38:20] all know from adoption 1960 the prophet
[38:24] says here how that God has s
[38:27] some in the church through the labor
[38:30] pains oh they get tremendous sometime
[38:34] but when a church is groaning under the
[38:37] persecution of the outside world so
[38:40] God's going to bring on a persecution
[38:43] that's going to bring on a groaning amen
[38:45] and that church has got to groan through
[38:47] that isn't that right Hallelujah God's
[38:50] people have always been persecuted
[38:51] throughout the years amen isn't that
[38:53] right persecution on the outside world
[38:55] Believing on the Lord Lord Jesus that
[38:57] the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[39:00] real to us as it was to Pentecost how
[39:05] they groan and cry under labor pains oh
[39:09] but when they are born and positionally
[39:13] born so the prophet bringing out two
[39:15] births here first born and then
[39:18] positionally Born Into the kingdom of
[39:21] God then he says the Holy Ghost has set
[39:25] in the church some Apostles some
[39:28] prophets some teachers some pastors some
[39:32] evangelists he said and then he give
[39:35] into there speaking with tongues
[39:38] interpretation of tongues knowledge
[39:41] wisdom Gifts of healing and all kinds of
[39:45] Miracles amen amen do you believe it
[39:48] tonight praise God hallelujah so I chose
[39:51] for title the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost
[39:55] has set in the church and I know many
[39:58] times we read this quote amen and we go
[40:01] over it and we enjoy it but there's a
[40:03] word I wanted to zero in on and that
[40:06] word is to set praise God the Holy Ghost
[40:09] has set in the church praise God Amen
[40:12] isn't that right yes sir he set in the
[40:15] church hallelujah praise God and to set
[40:18] means to play something in a fixed
[40:21] position in order to establish it can we
[40:25] say Amen right hallelujah hallelujah God
[40:28] set you up oh Hallelujah god Set you in
[40:31] there praise God hallelujah amen isn't
[40:34] that right so it fixs of being it it
[40:36] speaks of being in a fixed position and
[40:40] that is what we are stressing and
[40:41] striving to get into now that's what all
[40:44] this fuss is about for us to get into
[40:47] our place in Christ into our position in
[40:50] Christ God actually wants to set you in
[40:53] there amen isn't that right you come in
[40:57] sometimes your state is variable you're
[40:59] up one day and you're down the next not
[41:01] every day is a wonderful day some days
[41:03] you have good days and some days you
[41:05] have bad days isn't that right some days
[41:08] you feel happy and some days you feel
[41:10] sad some days you feel angry but what we
[41:13] talking about is fulfillment what we are
[41:16] talking about is purpose oh hle because
[41:19] happiness could come sadness could come
[41:21] and go happiness could come and go those
[41:24] are just fleeting moments but what you
[41:26] are are striving to get into tonight is
[41:28] to find your purpose in God oh it's to
[41:32] find your position in God is to find out
[41:35] what God has for you to do hey for you
[41:38] to do your job and for you to do it well
[41:41] and for you to run your way like Paul
[41:44] said I run my race I finished the course
[41:48] I did the thing that God sent me to do
[41:50] oh Hallelujah now there's a crown laid
[41:53] up for me to them that overcome it they
[41:57] will go no more out oh but God has a
[41:59] fixed place for you to be in tonight oh
[42:03] and that place is your position that
[42:05] place is your inheritance that place is
[42:07] where God has for you tonight oh
[42:09] somebody say Amen oh hallelujah
[42:14] hallelujah can we give him praise
[42:15] tonight Glory Hallelujah
[42:23] [Applause]
[42:25] Hallelujah
[42:30] [Music]
[42:34] so I feel this is very important amen
[42:37] because it's like the desire God has a
[42:39] desire friends Hallelujah a deep desire
[42:43] for you to find your
[42:44] place because remember man fell out of
[42:47] place when he was in the Garden of Eden
[42:49] isn't that right and he took up the tree
[42:51] of knowledge and so for like that and
[42:54] when man fell through Eve and Adam and
[42:55] everything that happened there what
[42:57] happened man fell out of his place isn't
[43:00] that right so now God's desire for you
[43:03] and I here tonight is to find back get
[43:06] back to that place get back to that
[43:09] place where you once was amen amen
[43:12] before there was a moon before there was
[43:13] a star God has a place for you God
[43:16] actually predestinated a place for you
[43:18] to be whatever that place is God knows
[43:21] what that place is I can't place you but
[43:23] the Holy Ghost is what set in the church
[43:27] some Apostles some prophets God has a
[43:29] place for you oh Hallelujah isn't that
[43:33] right God will adopt the farmer he'll
[43:36] adopt the housewife he'll adopt the
[43:38] maids oh Hall adopt the women the men
[43:41] the husbands the wives oh hallelujah
[43:43] praise God adoption is for you tonight
[43:45] if you could walk by faith oh Hal a
[43:48] closer walk with the oh Hallelujah a
[43:51] closer walk with Christ on that third P
[43:53] third
[43:54] phase Hallelujah is that right then you
[43:58] can come into this positional placing so
[44:00] that's why I feel tonight amen that God
[44:02] has a desire for this it's almost like a
[44:04] father wanting to have a desire for his
[44:07] children to come into their own to come
[44:10] into their own and begin to understand
[44:12] things so we can have deeper
[44:14] conversations with them they can't talk
[44:16] to a 5-year-old about real estate they
[44:18] don't understand that they're not at
[44:19] that Neville they don't understand that
[44:21] they can't impart that kind of knowledge
[44:23] to them but when they grow up and they
[44:25] learn a few things and they experience a
[44:27] few things and they get through a few
[44:29] difficulties and challenges and
[44:31] situations and they learn how to manage
[44:34] finances now you can have deeper
[44:35] conversations with them oh Hallelujah
[44:38] now you can understand why the Bible
[44:40] said be no more children tossed to and
[44:42] fro by every wind of Doctrine oh
[44:45] Hallelujah but for you to come into the
[44:47] fullness of the stature of the measure
[44:49] of Christ oh Hallelujah that's what God
[44:52] wants for you for you to be growed up in
[44:55] Christ amen for you to make the kind of
[44:57] decisions that would make the father
[44:59] please oh Hallelujah H say here is my
[45:02] spirit here is my son here is my
[45:04] daughter I am pleased to dwell with them
[45:07] I am pleased to dwell with him I am
[45:10] pleased to dwell with her oh Hallelujah
[45:12] because about everything else they chose
[45:15] love they chose a more excellent way oh
[45:18] above all that they could do they decide
[45:20] to choose forgiveness they decide to
[45:22] choose repentance they decide to choose
[45:24] Hallelujah
[45:26] because of the nature in them that's
[45:28] reflecting Christ amen amen you could
[45:31] make the kind of choices and decisions
[45:33] that will make the father proud amen
[45:35] that's what I believe that's what we
[45:37] want to come into praise God that's the
[45:39] desire that God has for God to
[45:41] positionally place his church praise God
[45:44] Amen and every member of the body would
[45:46] find their place isn't that right
[45:50] remember the prophet talking about how
[45:51] he looking up at the stars one night and
[45:53] he saw all the stars in their place
[45:56] every Star was in its place and he was
[45:58] reflecting talking about how in Noah's
[46:00] day that if the moon was ever to change
[46:03] course or Direction it would affect how
[46:05] the water or the tides would move on the
[46:07] earth isn't that right everything has to
[46:10] be in its place and and brother Brown
[46:13] said if that great Celestial body if the
[46:15] stars has to be in its place then that's
[46:17] what the church have to come into that
[46:19] condition where you could find your
[46:21] place in Christ amen amen hallelujah
[46:24] where you could find your position
[46:26] oh you could stand in your office in
[46:28] your seat praise God the one that God
[46:30] ordained for you to stand in because
[46:33] when you come into that position no
[46:35] devil could stand before you no devil
[46:37] could deny you praise God Amen oh you
[46:40] have a right to
[46:42] everything oh
[46:44] hallelujah amen isn't that right so
[46:47] that's the condition I feel God wants us
[46:49] to come into as a desire for us to do
[46:51] that so right now we in this variable
[46:53] State up one day down the next and and
[46:55] that's all for a season because it's a
[46:57] season of molding in that time you're
[47:00] you're you're you're you're you're going
[47:02] through things through phases he can't
[47:04] set you yet because you're not right yet
[47:06] to be set if you understand what I'm
[47:08] saying you're not right to be fitted in
[47:11] it's like the Box Car the man come
[47:13] around sealing the box cars He shake it
[47:15] first to see if it's ready to take
[47:17] sealing if he shake that and the
[47:19] packages in there not R if it's rattling
[47:22] if it's Out Of Tune you say pack it over
[47:24] again because it needs to be properly
[47:26] before it can be sealed but that's how
[47:28] your life is you can't have things
[47:30] rattling you can't have things shaking
[47:33] you can't have things loose it's got to
[47:35] be right in order to be sealed oh and
[47:38] God wants to seal you up but you've got
[47:40] to get right first you got to get
[47:42] everything lined up with the scripture
[47:45] you got to get your life lined up with
[47:47] the word in order for you to be
[47:50] set in the church in the position that
[47:54] God has for you to be in Hallelujah
[47:56] isn't that right do you believe it and
[47:59] this church we're talking about is not
[48:01] this physical building church it's not
[48:03] even this group the church we talking
[48:05] about is a mystical Body of Christ my
[48:08] one Spirit we baptized into that church
[48:11] and God sets you in there the holy ghost
[48:13] sets you in there amen he places you
[48:17] positionally praise God as whatever you
[48:19] supposed to be in the body isn't that
[48:21] right and each part will work according
[48:23] to his effectual uh working praise God
[48:26] according to his power isn't that right
[48:29] oh my so God set some in the church
[48:31] through their labor pains but then the
[48:34] Holy Ghost come he come around the end
[48:35] of the quote he said that the Holy Ghost
[48:37] come and set the chch set in the church
[48:40] this
[48:41] Ephesians uh Ministry that we're looking
[48:44] for isn't that right so this is where we
[48:47] at friends so now so to set means to fix
[48:51] to establish isn't that right 2 Peter 1:
[48:55] 12 12 says wherefore I will not be
[48:57] negligent to put you always in
[48:59] remembrance of these things though you
[49:02] know them but to be established in he
[49:05] said the present truth oh Hallelujah so
[49:08] Peter had a desire amen hall for the
[49:11] people to be established in the present
[49:13] truth amen isn't that right to be
[49:15] established in other in other words you
[49:17] drive a Stak in the ground and establish
[49:20] something establish the truth amen stand
[49:23] for the truth or obey the truth doesn't
[49:26] matter if other people aren't doing it
[49:28] it doesn't matter you have a divine
[49:30] revelation from God what the truth is
[49:33] and because you have a revelation you
[49:34] can stand on what God Said oh somebody
[49:37] help me say oh Hallelujah somebody help
[49:39] me tonight amen oh hallelujah
[49:43] hallelujah you can stand on what God
[49:45] said because it's a established it's a
[49:47] truth it's the truth and you're standing
[49:50] on it isn't that right oh my so to set
[49:54] in the church God wants to set you in
[49:56] there right now watch he said now watch
[49:59] now 2 Peter 1:13 he said yay I think it
[50:02] meat for as long as I'm in this

[50:08] putting you in remembrance so that's
[50:10] what they're here to do tonight we're
[50:12] here to stir you up oh to get on fire
[50:15] for God oh how to get on fire in your
[50:18] homes in your prayer closets in your
[50:19] life and put you in remembrance of these
[50:22] things praise God because we don't have
[50:24] all the time in the world
[50:26] Peter knew that he was going to die so
[50:28] he put this word in Earnest so that you
[50:30] could remember these things so that you
[50:32] could be stirred up so that you could
[50:34] get on fire for God so that you can get
[50:36] desperate oh and don't waste the time
[50:38] that you have here on Earth oh
[50:40] Hallelujah but spend the time with God
[50:42] every day getting closer to your goal

[51:19] is it just to occupy a Pew is it just to
[51:21] warm a bench or is it to do you have a
[51:24] purpose beyond that oh because despite

[51:33] put in your heart for you to attain oh
[51:36] Hallelujah sure we have bad experiences
[51:38] sure we have up days and down days but

[52:10] Hallelujah God put it upon God's servant
[52:12] Elijah to pass by there and Elijah was
[52:15] just an ordinary guy plowing the field
[52:18] and doing his thing and doing his 9 to5
[52:21] and paying his taxes and paying his

[58:50] [Music]
[58:52] Hallelujah so don't get weary friend
[58:56] friends we still have our ways to
[58:58] go God wants to set you in the
[59:01] church set you in
[59:04] there God actualizes himself as many
[59:09] things isn't that right sometimes he's a
[59:11] lamb a lion a dove isn't that right but
[59:15] one of the most interesting
[59:16] characteristics of God is when he comes
[59:19] down in the form of
[59:21] fire that's the most interesting
[59:23] characteristic to me because when you
[59:25] talk about this setting in the church
[59:27] hallelujah it's almost God wants to
[59:29] actually burn something down in there
[59:31] that when it's fixed it does not come
[59:34] out when you fix it down inside there
[59:37] and you burn it down inside there that
[59:39] ain't coming out again oh that's what
[59:42] God wants to do with you you're up one
[59:44] day you're down the next but when God
[59:45] Burns something down there inside of
[59:48] your soul it's fixed not coming out
[59:50] anymore oh hallelujah hallelujah God
[59:53] wants to set you tonight tonight in your
[59:56] place in your position as a Son of God
[59:59] as a daughter of God in the kingdom of
[1:00:01] God hallelujah representing all that God
[1:00:04] is all of his love all of his power all
[1:00:06] of his blessings God wants to set you in
[1:00:08] there as a pillar and you go no more out
[1:00:12] you are set in there by fire Holy Ghost
[1:00:16] Fire come in your soul and burn
[1:00:18] something down inside of you oh
[1:00:21] Hallelujah you can't be the same again
[1:00:23] you can't go back to be normal you can't
[1:00:26] go back to being human you have
[1:00:28] Supernatural take over and burn
[1:00:31] something in your soul Fire coming
[1:00:35] there
[1:00:37] Hallelujah fire
[1:00:40] caramelizes it does aall a unique
[1:00:44] job it does something water cannot do it
[1:00:47] does something sand and wind cannot do
[1:00:50] fire hallu actually distorts Hallelujah
[1:00:55] and
[1:00:56] forms and and and
[1:00:59] formalizes and sets conditions hallu
[1:01:02] fire does that hallu when Fire Hits
[1:01:06] it you have to break that thing out
[1:01:08] today to get out God praise God and what
[1:01:11] God established no man can
[1:01:13] remove isn't that right this is not
[1:01:16] man's fire it's God's
[1:01:20] fire when God's fire does the job oh H
[1:01:23] but it's better than any that we could
[1:01:25] scratch together brother amen that's
[1:01:28] what we want tonight call on the fire of
[1:01:31] God Holy Ghost Fire is what sets in the
[1:01:35] church some Apostles but it's a process
[1:01:38] T that Prophet talk about labor
[1:01:41] pains isn't that right and he said they
[1:01:44] get tremendous sometimes
[1:01:47] laboring why because you're bringing
[1:01:49] forth
[1:01:50] something isn't that right I remember
[1:01:54] take taking pictures of my wife when she
[1:01:56] was having her her children our children
[1:01:59] isn't that right Ezra and Eden and
[1:02:03] clearly you could see there's a
[1:02:04] difference when the child is in the womb
[1:02:07] and when the child comes out isn't that
[1:02:10] right in the womb the child is veiled in
[1:02:12] there all right you can't see anything
[1:02:14] all right it's mysterious all you know
[1:02:17] that that bump is getting larger it's
[1:02:19] getting bigger and something in it is
[1:02:21] forming you don't know how it forming
[1:02:24] all you do is praying in the night you
[1:02:26] praying at all the fingers and toes and
[1:02:28] on all the spinal column in the right
[1:02:30] place but that is up to God you put that
[1:02:33] in God Hand and say God I trust you oh
[1:02:35] Hallelujah and you just praying praise
[1:02:37] God H that the life in her will come out
[1:02:39] the right way oh hallelujah hallelujah H
[1:02:42] isn't that right but it's a journey that
[1:02:44] a woman takes H to bring a child into
[1:02:47] the world takes a long time takes 9
[1:02:50] months for it to form oh and all of a
[1:02:52] sudden there come the time for labor
[1:02:54] pains oh H the prophet said they get
[1:02:57] tremendous sometimes oh Hallelujah Hal
[1:03:00] groaning crying screaming oh Hall
[1:03:04] discomfort something in them is moving
[1:03:07] the water bag has already burst and some
[1:03:10] is ready to press out dilation not all
[1:03:13] the whole process oh the whole bloody
[1:03:15] thing but that's a process that it takes
[1:03:18] to bring a Manchild into the world and
[1:03:21] God typed this thing as labor pain oh oh
[1:03:24] Hallelujah come on now in other words
[1:03:27] it's ins of there something wants to

[1:03:48] it'll be unveil he's going to show the
[1:03:51] whole world what this product
[1:03:53] is

[1:04:10] faith and virtue and knowledge and
[1:04:12] Temperance we're actually going to
[1:04:13] produce that but it's not going to come
[1:04:15] easy it's going to come by labor pains
[1:04:18] labor pains labor pains groaning crying

[1:04:52] revelation of what you had to bring

[1:05:07] they didn't know she had an encounter
[1:05:09] with the Supernatural and that is what
[1:05:11] made the difference and that is why this
[1:05:13] bump inside me is growing but not

[1:07:15] promised word isn't that right oh my wow
[1:07:19] thank you Lord hallelu well
[1:07:25] okay so we can skip all this I think
[1:07:28] we I think the word is God
[1:07:32] home all right hallu should I read this
[1:07:35] here okay let's go to Paradox so watch
[1:07:37] Prophet said here vers uh paragraph 89
[1:07:41] we know this but I'm just reading for
[1:07:42] context tonight because we I want to
[1:07:44] drive this in but we're promised
[1:07:46] according to Revelation 10 and according
[1:07:49] to Malachi 4 and St Luke 22:17 and so
[1:07:52] forth that there's God to come and
[1:07:55] Ephesians to this amen there is promis
[1:07:58] it friends the prophet said there must
[1:08:00] come and Ephesians to these Sevenfold
[1:08:03] Mysteries of the word of God must be
[1:08:06] unfolded and it's in the loud deian age
[1:08:10] that this takes place and I believe that
[1:08:12] we're there isn't that right so the sful
[1:08:15] mysteres of the word had to come in
[1:08:17] there a revelation of how to go of how
[1:08:21] to uh translation Faith isn't that right
[1:08:24] seven tunders seven voices seven Church
[1:08:26] ages isn't that right a revelation come
[1:08:28] in there show you what you how to
[1:08:30] prepare show you how to get ready for
[1:08:34] his soon coming isn't that right oh
[1:08:36] Hallelujah and then it's going to come
[1:08:37] into a manifestation because God call
[1:08:40] you out of loud decent age to make up
[1:08:42] the headstone between brotherly kindness
[1:08:44] and love there was a gap there isn't
[1:08:47] that right but by revelation we
[1:08:49] understand that God caps this pyramid
[1:08:52] hallelujah it's a seven T of a caps
[1:08:54] isn't that right Hallelujah isn't that
[1:08:55] right so as we come up through laia
[1:08:58] praise God got to H stones out of Leia
[1:09:01] to fit up into that bright age that Holy
[1:09:04] Spirit so that we could catch the
[1:09:07] headstone which is love coming down
[1:09:09] Hallelujah he can't come down on
[1:09:10] brotherly kindness love wants to come
[1:09:12] down on something so God had to call a
[1:09:15] group out Hallelujah to make up the
[1:09:19] headstone so he can come into it and
[1:09:22] finish it
[1:09:24] the Cornerstone become the chief of the
[1:09:25] corner he come and he kep the whole
[1:09:27] thing isn't that right oh my so watch um
[1:09:32] where was I right so Ephesian to this
[1:09:34] got to come in Ephesian to this right
[1:09:36] had to come back to another original
[1:09:37] church just like it had a Pentecost
[1:09:40] isn't that right praise God that's what
[1:09:42] Christ will come down upon Hallelujah
[1:09:45] not this loud this age but it's already
[1:09:46] SP over his mouth isn't that right but
[1:09:49] he calling a bride out of that sir to
[1:09:52] make up the headstone and that's who you
[1:09:54] here are tonight that's why we've got to
[1:09:56] fight and strive with everything in us
[1:09:59] to find our place in Christ hallelujah
[1:10:01] hallelujah praise God so that we could
[1:10:02] do the work that he sent for us to do
[1:10:05] and each one of us have a job in there
[1:10:07] Hallelujah I can't tell you what it is
[1:10:10] God will reveal it he will show it you
[1:10:13] just walk with him praise God H and as
[1:10:15] you walk more will unfold as you walk
[1:10:17] more will unfold isn't that right Oh my
[1:10:20] he said I believe we're right in the
[1:10:21] shadows of the coming of the son of God
[1:10:23] and as Joshua just before the Ephesians
[1:10:25] raise up so did John the Baptist raise
[1:10:28] up just before the next Ephesians yes he
[1:10:30] said and then we promise another another
[1:10:33] Ephesians is predicted here in scripture
[1:10:36] therefore he said I think that we are
[1:10:38] living in the Ephesians again says it
[1:10:41] here back again to he said we promise
[1:10:44] that what was left off those through
[1:10:45] those uh Seven Ages he said now you
[1:10:48] can't add nothing to the book or take
[1:10:49] nothing from it Revelation 2218 says so
[1:10:51] who will ever add one word or take one
[1:10:53] word his part will be taken from the
[1:10:55] book of life now we cannot add or take
[1:10:57] see so therefore we know that Luther
[1:10:59] Luther couldn't get into it Wesley and
[1:11:01] so forth the reformers KNX finny Calvin
[1:11:05] on down so forth they didn't get it all
[1:11:07] but when they what they had was the
[1:11:09] Gospel truth amen amen amen isn't that
[1:11:13] right they had the truth for their age
[1:11:15] isn't that right but it all add up
[1:11:18] because when you look down you see what
[1:11:19] he was doing all the way coming up isn't
[1:11:21] that right and it took a profit at the
[1:11:23] end time to reveal what God was doing
[1:11:26] all throughout those ages when we didn't
[1:11:29] understand isn't that right my God so he
[1:11:30] says now in the last days we're given to
[1:11:32] understanding by the word he said that
[1:11:34] we're going to understand it because it
[1:11:36] will come an Ephesian age to it oh
[1:11:39] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen
[1:11:42] so your promise to understand it friends
[1:11:45] there comeing Ephesians AG it it will be
[1:11:46] revealed it'll come out of the womb
[1:11:48] praise godall and you'll see it for what
[1:11:50] it is Christ in his fullness Hallelujah
[1:11:53] when it's in the womb it's a mystery a
[1:11:54] mystery something coming out you're not
[1:11:56] sure but you're groaning you're crying
[1:11:57] you're praying you're pressing looking
[1:11:59] for it to come forth but when it comes
[1:12:00] out it's undeniable brother oh
[1:12:03] hallelujah it's a real life baby brother
[1:12:05] praise God it's a real
[1:12:07] reproduction a genuine image amen coming
[1:12:10] out of the amen into the open praise God
[1:12:14] Amen then the Holy Spirit come down and
[1:12:15] say Here's uh is my beloved Son my
[1:12:17] beloved daughter praise God they've come
[1:12:19] through the processes amen amen isn't
[1:12:22] that right you can't hide that under a
[1:12:24] Bushell now praise God Amen that comes
[1:12:26] out into the open praise God the whole
[1:12:28] world will know that you had been with
[1:12:30] Jesus because you'll be written Epistles
[1:12:32] read of all men praise God do you
[1:12:34] believe it tonight so we're going to
[1:12:37] understand it it come to Ephesians 8 to8
[1:12:39] I we here now he said now a paradox he
[1:12:41] said now I'll leave that let that hang
[1:12:43] because I just got about 10 more minutes
[1:12:45] and then we have the prayer line praise
[1:12:47] God Amen Hallelujah so he left it there
[1:12:50] prophecy so we got to come to this isn't
[1:12:52] that right amen oh my oh my so when I
[1:12:55] thought about set in the church the
[1:12:58] inspiration come to me about The
[1:12:59] Potter's House amen isn't that right how
[1:13:01] God took his servant down to The
[1:13:03] Potter's House isn't that right
[1:13:05] Hallelujah and when God was molding the
[1:13:07] when the Potter was molding the clay
[1:13:09] isn't that right shaping it forming it
[1:13:12] changing it spinning it on the wheel
[1:13:14] Hallelujah we are the clay tonight and
[1:13:17] he is the Potter taking the clay of our
[1:13:19] lives and he is molding it wetting it
[1:13:22] shaping it into something isn't that
[1:13:25] right so you have to go through a
[1:13:27] process in order to come out the way he
[1:13:29] wants you to come out and sometimes it's
[1:13:31] not what you like but it's what he needs
[1:13:34] for you to go through right now in order
[1:13:36] for you to become a vessel of Honor you
[1:13:39] have to go through the process oh
[1:13:42] Hallelujah a process that shapes you a
[1:13:44] process that molds you a process that
[1:13:47] bends you oh and if you get broken if
[1:13:50] you spin off the wheel don't worry
[1:13:52] nothing nothing is is cast in stone just
[1:13:54] yet God can still pick up the pieces of
[1:13:56] your life and put them back together
[1:13:58] again and spin you back on that wheel oh
[1:14:02] Hallelujah isn't that right Pottery is
[1:14:05] amazing to look at praise God whether
[1:14:07] you're looking at it up close or uh on
[1:14:09] on YouTube I had the privilege of doing
[1:14:12] both and it's so interesting to see how
[1:14:14] the Potter does it some sometimes just
[1:14:16] take a finger and just do so and the
[1:14:19] whole shape change so he take a few
[1:14:21] fingers and do this wet his hands and
[1:14:23] and the whole thing goes up it goes down
[1:14:25] he puts his hand inside it Bellows out
[1:14:27] into a bowl he's shaping he's forming
[1:14:30] he's molding it's such a mysterious
[1:14:32] process mysterious because the Potter
[1:14:35] knows what he's going to create amen
[1:14:37] isn't that right the clay cannot say I
[1:14:39] am this I am this amen isn't that right
[1:14:41] just like Paul says no he has to put his
[1:14:44] his life in the hands of the Potter and
[1:14:46] the Potter has to shape it into
[1:14:47] something that'll be worth anything you
[1:14:50] think we worth anything we were just

[1:29:25] hear your voice and your life ends up

[1:29:54] the city no he said he said that's no
[1:29:56] great mystery to see a man do that he
[1:29:58] said Samson was not a big man at all
[1:29:59] Prophet said all the scripture declares
[1:30:01] him to be a little shrimp a little bitty
[1:30:03] fellow and he was blessed why he was
[1:30:05] born that way he said that's the way you
[1:30:07] get blessed is when you're born that way
[1:30:10] not when some priest bless you or when
[1:30:12] some preacher baptizes you but when God

[1:30:45] so Sams Samson let go and he let
[1:30:47] whatever it was take over is basically
[1:30:48] what he's saying is that right and it
[1:30:50] wasn't Samson it was the hidden power in
[1:30:52] him the prophet said it isn't some magic
[1:30:55] word it isn't rubbing a rabbit foot
[1:30:56] behind your ears not spitting on a
[1:30:58] horseshoe or throwing it over that makes
[1:31:00] the magic it isn't that isn't what makes
[1:31:03] a man live a different life no more than
[1:31:05] joining church or putting your name on a
[1:31:07] book or being baptized look what the
[1:31:08] equated to trying to do something to get
[1:31:11] favor with God isn't that right amen he
[1:31:13] said but what makes a man is when God by
[1:31:16] a birth gives him the hidden power and
[1:31:18] blesses him by the holy spirit in his
[1:31:21] life on what makes him what he is
[1:31:24] Prophet said and then Samson walked out
[1:31:25] there the lion come towards him oh my

[1:32:25] to a close here amen let me try to wind
[1:32:28] up oh glory to God do you love him
[1:32:30] tonight amen amen he said now when
[1:32:32] you're a while ago when you're a
[1:32:33] Christian you made a Christian what what
[1:32:36] made you a Christian he said because God
[1:32:37] called you before the foundation of the
[1:32:39] world to be a Christian and you become a
[1:32:42] Christian amen and then you got saved
[1:32:44] filled with the Holy Spirit and you got
[1:32:46] eternal life why did he give you the
[1:32:47] Holy Spirit he Prophet said as a seal of
[1:32:50] your faith you had had Faith first and
[1:32:52] then he seals it isn't that right he
[1:32:54] said now if you say if you say well you
[1:32:56] say a while ago about uh Billy Billy
[1:32:59] Graham and them hollering well now how
[1:33:01] many wants to accept Christ as a
[1:33:03] personal savior raise up their hand he
[1:33:04] says he says all is that all right he
[1:33:05] said okay certainly that's all right
[1:33:06] that's good he said but that's just the
[1:33:08] beginning Prophet said he said then if
[1:33:10] you really believe it and you really
[1:33:12] accept it in your heart that you are
[1:33:14] taught right then the holy spirit will
[1:33:17] come as a circumcision that he gave
[1:33:20] Abraham after Faith as a
[1:33:23] confirmation amen amen amen the Holy
[1:33:26] Spirit comes on as a confirmation amen
[1:33:29] he says he goes on he says now you say
[1:33:31] well people let's have a taring meeting

[1:33:34] let's t for the Holy Ghost he said
[1:33:35] there's no such a thing T don't mean to
[1:33:37] pray tar means to wait how many knows
[1:33:40] that that tar means to wait Jesus said
[1:33:43] wait up there in the city of Jerusalem
[1:33:45] until I until the promise is given to
[1:33:48] you he said I don't know what they were
[1:33:49] doing he said they were probably play
[1:33:52] praying I don't know but never did they
[1:33:54] have to wait after that because he said
[1:33:56] while Peter spake these words the Holy
[1:33:57] Spirit fell on them and all down and
[1:34:00] then when the Paul laid hands on them
[1:34:01] the Holy Ghost Came Upon them he said is
[1:34:04] that right see no more waiting he said
[1:34:05] now the Holy Ghost was there and give
[1:34:08] them the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a
[1:34:10] confirmation of their faith amen the
[1:34:14] faith that they claim to have God
[1:34:15] confirm it with the fire of the Holy
[1:34:18] Ghost amen and that's what we're looking
[1:34:20] for tonight a confirmation of our faith
[1:34:24] of our seven tunder Faith God's going to
[1:34:26] pour out a Revival upon the bride in the
[1:34:29] last days to confirm the faith that you
[1:34:32] have in God the faith that you have in
[1:34:34] Malachi 4's revealed word oh he'll send
[1:34:36] the fire of God to confirm the faith in
[1:34:39] your soul and caramelize it and fix it
[1:34:42] down in there air go no more out amen
[1:34:46] amen do you see it now amen oh we struck
[1:34:49] it wonderful all right we why now now
[1:34:52] amen and God had Abraham circumcised the
[1:34:53] confirmation of his faith what was it
[1:34:55] was the Holy Ghost was it the Holy Ghost
[1:34:57] he said somebody tell me what the Holy
[1:34:58] Ghost is for he said it's a sign is that
[1:35:00] right he said was what's the
[1:35:02] circumcision it's a sign it that's right
[1:35:04] yeah it's a sign God gave a sign that he
[1:35:06] had accepted Abraham for circumcision
[1:35:09] and when you say Prophet said I believe
[1:35:11] God I believe Jesus Christ then God
[1:35:14] gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:17] as a sign that he has accepted your
[1:35:19] faith Hallelujah and that your SE into
[1:35:21] the kingdom of God not till the next
[1:35:23] Revival but until the day of your
[1:35:26] Redemption Ephesians 4:30 says grieve
[1:35:29] not the holy spirit of God whereby you
[1:35:31] are sealed until the day of your
[1:35:34] Redemption oh do you believe it tonight
[1:35:36] amen glory to God hallelujah
[1:35:39] positionally born talking about
[1:35:40] positionally born two more minutes God
[1:35:42] adopted his own son when he took him up
[1:35:44] took Peter James and John as a witness
[1:35:45] in the mouth of two or three Witnesses
[1:35:47] let every word be established isn't that
[1:35:49] right he went up there and God
[1:35:51] overshadowed Christ and the Holy Spirit
[1:35:53] overshadowed Christ and his rign and
[1:35:55] shine as the sun isn't that right and
[1:35:56] God himself said this is my beloved Son
[1:35:59] hear ye him in other words there it is
[1:36:02] he says all of it and there whatever he
[1:36:04] says is all of it isn't that right and
[1:36:06] then he was given equal and of course it
[1:36:08] was God but it was God In the Flesh of
[1:36:10] Jesus Christ manifesting himself to the
[1:36:12] people and there God adopted his own son
[1:36:16] he said in the in the Old Testament when
[1:36:18] a son is born in a home it's a son
[1:36:20] because he's uh it was a son it was born
[1:36:22] in a home my son is my son when he was
[1:36:24] born to Me Prophet says he gives a
[1:36:26] reference he said when the Pentecostal
[1:36:28] Church gave birth or found what they
[1:36:30] call the birth the new birth or the Holy
[1:36:31] Ghost Church they were born into the
[1:36:33] kingdom of God well now in the Old
[1:36:35] Testament in Ephesians first chapter it
[1:36:37] said we are predestinated unto the
[1:36:39] adoption of sons unto the adoption of
[1:36:41] sons he said look at that unto the
[1:36:43] adoption of sons yes sir and a man in
[1:36:45] the Old Testament when he had a son born
[1:36:47] in his house when he had a son when he
[1:36:48] was born there the tutor raised that
[1:36:50] child until he come to a certain age and
[1:36:53] then if the tutor brought word to the
[1:36:55] father that this child was worthy and
[1:36:57] all right and everything uh is that
[1:36:59] right then he was adopted into that
[1:37:01] family and he said many of you old test
[1:37:03] reading know the scripture on that right
[1:37:05] he said but if he wasn't he still remain
[1:37:06] a son but he just wasn't adopted oh
[1:37:09] Hallelujah so there's a difference
[1:37:11] between born and positionally born oh
[1:37:14] I'm trying to differentiate that here
[1:37:15] isn't that right so they are sons and
[1:37:17] then they are adopted Sons when you're
[1:37:19] born in a family you're born you come in
[1:37:21] praise God you're come in a child but
[1:37:23] then you have to be tutored child
[1:37:24] trained in order to handle the father's
[1:37:26] business now you comeing to the adoption
[1:37:29] and that's a different thing oh
[1:37:31] Hallelujah you know in part you
[1:37:32] prophesying part but when that which is
[1:37:34] perfect is come that which imp part is
[1:37:36] done away with now you're adopted into
[1:37:38] the family praise God hallelujah amen
[1:37:40] and your your name is just as good as a
[1:37:42] father isn't that right on the check
[1:37:44] isn't that right amen then he's adopted
[1:37:47] in that family uh isn't that right he's
[1:37:49] still he's still a son but he's not
[1:37:50] adopted
[1:37:51] oh Hallelujah so what we want to come
[1:37:53] into tonight is adopted sons in the last
[1:37:56] days amen that's what God wants that's
[1:37:59] what his desire for us I truly believe
[1:38:01] that amen musician can get ready and
[1:38:04] then if he was adopted he was brought
[1:38:05] down on the street put on a robe on him
[1:38:07] ceremony was made and then this boy's
[1:38:09] signature under check meant just the
[1:38:11] same as his daddy's just the same for he
[1:38:13] was adopted into the full Fellowship of
[1:38:16] the family oh Hallelujah isn't that
[1:38:19] right praise God so uh said about the
[1:38:21] Believers on adoption he said here the
[1:38:24] Caleb and Joshua outfit that was going
[1:38:26] on to the promise they moved on over
[1:38:29] into the land and they took the land and
[1:38:31] settled down in the land as a possession
[1:38:34] here's an encouragement from the prophet
[1:38:35] he said and we never stop at
[1:38:38] justification or sanctification he said
[1:38:40] let's go on to the baptism of the Holy
[1:38:44] Spirit he said let's not stop at
[1:38:46] Believing on the Lord Jesus or being
[1:38:48] baptized let's not stop because he Clean
[1:38:50] us up just from a life of sin but now we
[1:38:52] press on into a position to a promise of
[1:38:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost for Peter
[1:38:59] said on the day of Pentecost for This
[1:39:01] Promise is unto you and to your children
[1:39:04] and to them that are far off and even as
[1:39:07] many as our Lord Our God shall call
[1:39:09] isn't that right so Ephesus here sets us
[1:39:13] like Joshua positionally and he said and
[1:39:15] you notice Joshua after crossing over
[1:39:18] into the land take the land he divided
[1:39:20] the land Ephraim here he said Manasses
[1:39:23] over there this one over here G here
[1:39:26] Benjamin here he divided the land oh you
[1:39:28] can begin PR something softly and notice
[1:39:30] he said and this just burns our hearts
[1:39:33] each one of those Hebrew mothers hey
[1:39:35] it's Clos as we coming into this now
[1:39:38] giving birth to those children she spoke
[1:39:41] the very place in her labor pains amen
[1:39:44] where they would be positioned in the
[1:39:46] promised land oh so they actually come
[1:39:48] into their position through literally
[1:39:51] through labor pains oh hallelujah
[1:39:53] hallelujah no wonder the prophet brings
[1:39:54] it here like this he said oh it's a
[1:39:56] great study if you could get into the
[1:39:58] details and so on he say it'll take ours
[1:40:00] but someday when we get our church fixed
[1:40:04] the prophet said I'd just like to come
[1:40:06] and take a solid month or two just stay
[1:40:07] right with it he said but watch when
[1:40:09] each of those mothers come when she
[1:40:10] called out Ephraim when she was in labor
[1:40:13] she positionally placed him where his
[1:40:15] feet was setting in oil just exactly uh
[1:40:19] every one of them they were at and
[1:40:22] Joshua knowing this not knowing this not
[1:40:24] knowing this sorry but by inspiration
[1:40:26] LED of the Holy Spirit after being in
[1:40:28] the promised land give each man his
[1:40:31] promise exactly according to what the
[1:40:33] Holy Spirit promised through the birth
[1:40:35] back there and then he come back into
[1:40:37] this the quote again we read at the
[1:40:39] beginning so I'll round it up with this
[1:40:40] how that God set sumon the church
[1:40:43] through those same labor pains oh he can
[1:40:46] begin to stand do you see those layer
[1:40:47] pains now he said and they get
[1:40:49] tremendous sometimes when that church is
[1:40:51] groaning under the persecution of the
[1:40:53] outside world and believing on the Lord
[1:40:56] Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:58] is just as real to us as it was to
[1:41:01] Pentecost oh Hallelujah there's a place
[1:41:03] for you oh God knows it hallelujah oh
[1:41:06] he's predestinated for you but you got
[1:41:07] to come through that process of Pains of
[1:41:10] possessing the land of fighting for your
[1:41:12] inheritance of coming into your own inch
[1:41:15] by inch tap line by line here a little
[1:41:18] there a little oh till you come oh into
[1:41:21] your Perfection oh Hallelujah isn't that
[1:41:23] right inch by inch mile by mile

[1:41:27] foot tread upon that have I given to you
[1:41:30] you're coming into it amen isn't that
[1:41:32] right Church groaning and then the
[1:41:33] promise of the Holy Ghost just as real
[1:41:35] to us as it was a Pentecost how they
[1:41:37] grown and cry and the labor pains but
[1:41:38] when they're born and positionally Born
[1:41:41] Into the kingdom of God then the Holy
[1:41:44] Ghost has set in the church some
[1:41:47] Apostles some prophets some teachers
[1:41:49] some pastors some evangelist and then

[1:42:08] is now now this is my purpose of doing
[1:42:09] this the church always trying to take

[1:42:15] place in Christ positionally take it he
[1:42:19] said oh it gets deep and Rich when you
[1:42:20] get in here
[1:42:21] how that God puts one in the church to
[1:42:23] speak with tongues and another he said
[1:42:25] and no we've been taught many times we
[1:42:26] have to speak with tongues he said
[1:42:27] that's wrong we don't we we we don't all
