was so blessed thank God for the elders and the deacons and the it was so beautiful executed I felt pleased I felt thrilled to know that I'm out and everything is spot on listen to see the Jews in order we just want to get things line up so I appreciate you and the support from First Peter chapter one we want to read 15 to 20 then we have our seats and then we will read another scripture taken from Leviticus 25. okay Peter chapters First Peter chapter one verse 13. thanks for coming out tonight we're for good up the loins of your mind be sober hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the form of lust in your ignorance but as he which I'd call you to be who is Holy so be holy in all manner of conversation and that good conversation you and me keep saying it is not talk that good conversation means manner of life who's 16 because it's written be holy for I am Holy and if you call on the father who without respects of persons judge it according to Every Man's will pass the time of your Social Children Here In Fear for as much here we go you know that you were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by the traditions of your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish without spot who verily was foreign before the foundation of the world that was manifesting these last times for you father God let's pray father God we thank you for your word and that prayer blessed interpreters tonight and confirm the word tonight with signs one of the Miracles I ask in Jesus name amen you will be seated so I'm going to read this same thing we read here first and the amplifier that we're going to go forward so this is firstly the amplifier to T so brace up your minds be sober circumspect morally alert set your hope holy unchangeably on the grace Divine favor that is coming to you when Jesus Christ the Messiah is revealed live as children of obedience to God and hear this do not conform yourselves to the evil desires that govern you in your former ignorance when you did not know the requirements of the Gospel but as one who call you is Holy you yourselves also be holy in all your conduct and manner of living that's what called conversation beholding your conduct and manner of living for his written be holy you shall be holy for I am Holy and if you call upon him as your father who judges each one impartially according to what he does then you should conduct yourself with true reference throughout the time of your temporary residence on Earth weather long or short you must know or recognize that you were redeemed or ransomed from the useless footless way of living inherited by conditions from your forefathers not with corruptable things such as if and gold but you were purchased with the precious blood of Christ the Messiah like as of a sacrificial lamb without Flemish or spot it is true that he has chosen and forede and this time and foreknown for it before the foundation of the world for he was brought out the public view made manifest in these last days at the end of time for the sake of you so Christ's coming is for you to redeem you amen say love him tonight I wonder if everybody buyers want to look at it Leviticus chapter 25 want to read verse 8 and we want to read down from verse 8 Leviticus chapter 25 and though shall number seven Sabbath of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 40 and 9 years then shout out caused the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound toward all your land you shall hallow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty showed all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and he shall return every man unto his possession and he shall return every man unto his family and after this verse here was 10 I took a title and he shall return every man unto his possession verse 11 Jubilee shall that 50th year be unto you he shall not so neither reap that which great of itself Lord gather The Grapes of it of divine undressed for it is a jubilee it shall be holy unto you he shall eat of the increased thereof out of the field and the year of this Jubilee He shall return every man unto his possession and if those cell ought unto thy neighbor and biased or alter thy neighbor's hand he shall not oppress one another according to the number of years shall the Jubilee shall go buy of thy neighbor and according number of years of the fruit she shall sell unto thee let me just skip them a little bit here now verse 19. all right let's skip a bit all right verse 20 and he shall say what shall we eat in the seventh year behold we shall not sow no guard in our crease verse 21 then I will command my blessing is a commanded blessing I will command my blessings upon you in the sixth year it shall bring forth for three years you shall sow the eighth year eat of the old fruit until the ninth year until her fruits come in you shall eat of the old store the land shall not be sold forever so this is God's law right here listen carefully to this part you know the land shall not be sold forever for the land is mine for you are strangers and satinas with me and in all the land of your possession you shall Grant a Redemption for the land this is God's law he's presented to the people you know are you with me verse 25 If thy brother be waxing poor and had sold away some of his possession if any of you is a skin or family come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which his brother sold if the man have none to redeem it and himself be able to redeem it let him count the years of the seal thereof restored over plus unto the man to whom it has sold it that he may return it until his possession so if you could do it yourself you had a money to pay for your stuff your perfect you get back and stuff all right verse 20th and if he be not able to restore it to him then that which his soul shall remain in the hand of him that bought it until until the Year of Jubilee and in the Jubilee it shall go out and he shall return unto his possession so God lord definitively states that they could only keep it until he actually if there's no family to redeem it if you can't redeem it yourself when that Jubilee time comes it has to return back to your possession to inheritance all right let's continue and if he was not able to restore it to him verse 28 that which is soul shall remain in the hand of him that was bought it until the Year of Jubilee it shall be a jubilee it shall go out all right praise the Lord amen praise God and he shall return of this decision on this possession verse 29 if a man sell a dwelling house in a wall City then he will redeem it within a whole year after they sold within a full year may redeem it and if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year then the house that is in the world city shall be established forever to him that bought it toward all generations it shall not go out in the Jubilee that is property in world cities but the houses of The Villages which have no all around them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be redeemed they shall goat in the Jubilee so isn't that something are we going to find out the prophet like that as well in them churches and Bong in them groups and tired but big walls all around them I don't really come in for them fully loaded all right okay revelation 5. saw a strong Angel Pokemon Lord Voice who is ready to open the book to Lucy thereof no man in Heaven and Earth under the Earth to look there on we say weep not the land of tribe but Judas prevailed to lose the Seven Seas is that right and then in the midst of the throne Comfort what a lamb sling blood bleeding to redeem you and I we know that right but all that Redemption plan all that burden sacrifice was to bring about the names that was in that book because your inheritance was in that book what you have to go back to his written in that book and we were waiting for that book to be unsealed that we could go back to get our Redemptive rights and go back to pick back up what Adam lost positionally and he was supposed to reproduce other Sons but because we fell and so long in the sex a humanistic realm in that sense then God had to come with a message you must be born again to bring us back by word and spirit back to full Redemption even the Redemption to with our Redemption of our bodies to bring us back to Eden so the object is to bring yourself straight back from where they fell from or give the Lord some praises Oh Glory to God so when the Angels were had flaming swords got in the tree of life to block Adam from his condition to partake of eternal life now the Angels trying to get us back because that tree of life is guarded it is still guided tonight that tree of life has to do with the altar that you have the life have to do with the presence oh glory to God hallelujah so God guards his presence and you have to be prepared to enter into presence okay the Lord send Praises nobody can just go there you know you have to be prepared to go into presence oh glory to God they were cherubims he said they were not men neither they were Angels they were not Angels they were cherubims we found them in the Old Testament with the ark we find them in the New Testament we fight him in the coming of the Lord cherubims guarding The Mercy Seat The Mercy Seat which no one could approach unless there was an atonement there for that person it was sprinkled with blood then it becomes a mercy seat it was a judgment seat actually but the Blood Naked The Mercy Seat so God sees it really a judgment seat but the Blood on the Judgment seat making some mercy seat and that is where we found Mercy all glory with blood on the Judgment seat or get the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah he said the Chairman's first mentioned was the East Gate of garden going four ways and the cherubims remember is cherubims and they were to guard the tree of life that was the god the way of the tree of life the way who is the way Jesus isn't that right now watch here now okay let's get down here now now you see these cherubims John saw they must be interested in keeping the Tree of Life he saw one face with a man of a of man face a man of an eagle a lion and so on right isn't that right praise God watch and I want to show you and make this show it's an altar this must have been an altar at the Garden of Eden I'll tell you why do you remember what Kieran Abel came here to worship so that shows that God's altar was moved and set here at the Garden of Eden and the only way back to Eden is by the altar so you see this lack of heart was it hard gospel heart stirring something wrong because the gospel have to bring it to the altar the gospel to bring in the presence and brother kangly what happened when Isaiah who was living on King uziah come into presence it showed up himself he could not talk about the other brethren Oh Praise he said woe is me for I am undone I am a man of unclean lips oh glory to God now who falls who is shocked off and this one off this one is not in the bride instead of nonsense praise God they have not come into presence the message world has not really come into presence yet because president trips you presence humble you presence bring it up to the Cross oh give the Lord some Praises Prime presence bring you down to the altar oh get the Lord some Praises real presence not feel good thing not bubble dancing real presence bring it on like John I felt as I fell as one dead like Daniel like amen like Paul all of them he said he was numb for days you say you know your blessings but you don't know what presence oh praise be to Jesus the only way back to eat it by the altar here you see it again back to Eden through the Altar and they were sent to God it until his order was covered blood he said oh God can people see it nothing but the blood there has to be an atonement a mercy seat there this altar of judgment must become a mercy seat and when this alt if the blood lifted they will stand on the Judgment Day the fire of God's Wrath to God the tree again the only thing will enter the Eden again will be through the blood of Jesus Christ oh praise God God in this gate King and Evil coming to worship so notice he said watch Cain went out from the presence of the Lord has a scripture you know Genesis 4 16 and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and prevent a land of not he actually walked from the presence and dwell in London and become a scientist and make computer and chips and technology and everything else foreign they trust in science that is cane lineage with all this cell phone and technology and computer the bringing man to trust Chuck just science now they have full confidence that they could do it could do this they could do that all things are possible with them scientific brain and we come to say all things are possible to them that believe what God Said so because men pick up the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil be making electricity electric there's all kinds of things listen it in the last 15 years Things That Never Was has been in technology and the church still coming along well I hope that we do a make a revolution by believing and taking God out his word to know that God can't lie and there's gonna be a bright Revival there's going to be a super Church a super race as we hear the headstone you have to be convinced of that Glory listen man no believe they could do anything you know because of technology and the prophet had a vision before Jesus come again that they will reach where he saw he saw the car with no steering wheel and it was driving with a power and a force they have reached there he said science read so far they have breaking the cross Laboratory o praise God praise God so Kingman off from the presence of the Lord At the Gate of the garden so the presence of the Lord must have been at the altar and the altar was at the gate it is God's Dwelling Place presence of God is where at the altar hallelujah praise God and the devil will fight you from getting to the altar fighter at your home altar family altar any altar that God supposedly you're supposed to have never gonna fight you there because you know there is where you get in power that is where you get in strength that is where you're getting me anointing that's the way they gave God favor praise God praise God another songwriter say I want I want that kind of blessing that sees and keep and Satisfy My Soul when Jacob met the Lord upon that night Hallelujah wrestle alone oh hallelujah praise God praise God so hear this bomb he said so they were sent to God The Mercy Seat the god The Mercy Seat where God is in a Shekinah Glory where was it she kind of Glory at The Mercy Seat the god the Shekinah Glory then it goes to show that every scallywag can't commandeer and think of that you have got to be prepared before you come into the presence of it this of it is not an apostle this of it is not a Prophet this of it is not a picture or evangelist or pastor this is him so God shipped more there for 40 years and when Moses saw the burning bush and got there he said take off the shoes because that wronged his holy grounds I want to talk to you but first you have to recognize who I am and then you could reference my presence so when you go down to the people you know what you're talking about or give the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah and in type he said Aaron how do I start bells and pomegranate and everywhere he walked it played holy that's what that was the representation of the Bells and the pomegranate the playing holy holy unto the Lord he had to be Anointed with a certain oil perfume with a certain perfume made of the rules of sham and Jesus was the rules of shine is that right and the rules had to be crushed and then the perfume is squeeze on the rose and Jesus in his life was the most beautiful life ever lived but he couldn't remain that way because he had to anoint his church to approach his holiness oh that's why he was crushed yes he had to anoint his church that puts his Holiness so his life was squeezed out and the same Holy Ghost was upon Him is put upon the church and he makes him the same yesterday to them forever the rules of Sharon the perfume thereof the person that's approaching into the holies of holies has to be Anointed with the same Holy Spirit Oh Glory to God give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah praise God praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah all right so therefore the mercy seat is in the heart the seat where The Shining forth of his glory in all of his children the Shekinah Glory in the human heart here's the human heart is that right is that The Mercy Seat how do you come true into that to these different systems through self-will self-will comes into tear true deer comes out what Shekinah Glory what is Shekinah Glory is God's presence how you get there you have to desire God's will desire God's plan when God take bomb the snake out of Peter's heart and he's sitting in the mercy see the throne into Peter's heart a nice a NASA safaricom line he said he enlighten me like holy ghost something Beyond Peter was operating to say you know what that that's not good you're dishonest and they were judging the church because they thought like brother Peter they'll see when God slipped down and said a throne was in Peter's acting pillar fire was hanging there and he said we'll have to come back again because why are we going back to the original faith of the fathers and the region of Faith was pillow fire veiled in the sons of God oh every devil in hell knew was the pillow fighting Saturday Peter I know he know they know because they've encountered it already or give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah Glory all right here we go no one could stand the judgments of God only thing we can look for is Mercy not judgment we cannot approach his Justice he will have to keep his word and keeping his word the day you eat thereof that day you die who would want Justice I don't want Justice I call for mercy let the mercy of God The Mercy Seat sprinkled there was a time of the cleanses of the sanctuary when it was a judgment seat as long as blood was off the sea prophecy we are approaching that time now we are now approaching in this age a cleansing of the sanctuary and judgments coming upon the Earth as long as blood is there here we go listen to this as long as blood is still God cannot destroy the Earth as long as blood is there nobody is a sinner before God this is bigger do you get this as long as blood is there nobody is a sinner before God everybody is right because there's an atonement for everybody but if you fail to accept that atonement and go into his presence then you are sinner so when God look on the earth there's blood coming here everybody have an opportunity to access mercy and Grace because of the blood when somebody die and they go beyond that and they have not received that blood they have to be judged that is where they sin apart is made manifest do you get that now so the blood is speaking for everybody as long as your crossover unsafe let's read it again as long as the blood is dear nobody is a sinner before God everybody is right because there's an atonement for everybody but if you fail to accept that atonement and go into his presence then you are a sinner you are beyond that Mercy then you have judged yourself but know why there is Mercy when the cleanse of the sanctuary come blood goes off The Mercy Seat and then the wrath of God falls upon the Earth he say oh my God be merciful to us that we be not in that day form without the mercies of God o praise be to Jesus hallelujah hallelujah praise God Hallelujah all right skip what I see represent a finished work okay I know it's jumpy tonight but bear with me here he read the scripture in whom you also trusted after you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom after he believed you were sealed without Holy Spirit of promise it's the Holy Spirit of what say it he promised you the Holy Ghost is the Holy Spirit The Promise you already born with the train United Spirit United Self you're a human Spirit you had an ego he had the pride and everything else he's not promised that now you're born with you know yourself he promised Holy Spirit he promised fire baptism to burn the snake out your heart to burn your ways to change you for you to come to a recognition that you have been bought with a price you are purchased being oh he pay a lot for you Hallelujah you appear to redeem you he prayed that you can get your individual Jubilee and come out from where you're at to go back to your possession your cop didn't come out to go into something because Redemption have two packs coming out of and going into people can watch a Baptist and Methodist and Pentecost and all kind of into the message but what have they gone into they come from One Piece internet kitchen members like taken taken Corps from one mock to bring in the next mug is corpse moving I said that dead people switching churches switching groups I said that dead people from mock to mock to mock oh praise the name of the Lord watch in whom after you believe you were sealed with that Holy Spirit I promise after you believe he said oh my Baptist brother how could you say that isn't so you say you receive the Holy Ghost When You Believe he said after you believe then you were sealed a promise he said which is the earnest of inheritance until Redemption of the put his possession we find out deceiving is a finished thing it's a finished work all that if only call all he call is Justified he said what a beautiful thing he said we are predestinated with the lamb the holy spirit is our seal the earnest means more is yet to come [Applause] it's the earnest of our adoption amen the holy spirit is now the earnest of God in our hearts the adoptions of sun waiting us at the end of the road this is a beautiful quote there's a Powerhouse praise God hallelujah it's a donkey man it's like you close the mortgage without getting the full thing yet you have to make a down payment on the property but the whole thing is yours but you get that down payment or more Is Yet To Come and the Holy Spirit no is the earnest of God in our hearts sealed the adoptions of sun waiting for us at the end of the road what could he say the Dynamics of this church will be refilling the holy ghost that we have worked in a small measure by the Capstone coming down where the Capstone is the end product love is the Fulfillment of the law repressed into the rest or give the Lord a shout faith is a revelation and you press my virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and coldness straight up to the rest charity is the rest we'll get the Lord some prison glory to God you have to enter into his rest Oh Glory to God and he said one day again one day we'll be in a jubilee and it'll be relaxing time oh give the Lord I pray when when you are all right oh wait nothing nothing embodying you nothing and troubling you anointing over your conscience your imagination your affection your reason the same anointing that you feel now over your mind over your heart over your spirit over your body or give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen Glory hallelujah hallelujah let me say it again it's a dumb payment that holds it that secures it that anchors it so no one else can touch it it's the earnest of our adoption it's the earnest how you can be adopted with all the Holy Ghost it's the illness of the is the down payment that the rest is yet to come what the tongues told the Prophet this in itself is weapon make and come to pass the tremendous Victory you love divine what did they say before a huge portion of Heaven awaits deal he said I always think as you portion across they know it's here it's a huge portion of adoption oh give the Lord a praise God in other words you're going back to your inheritance the portion that God lives out for you hey what can the Lord some presents tonight what did Caleb said when they cross over and they fight and they settle down Caleb come to Joshua and tell her what Caleb said give me my Mountain you know my Muslim God spoke to me he said amen I've been more than able to drag them Giants out give me my Mountain Caleb comes for his inheritance he comes from his portion he represents the True Believer in the last day that savior the Holy Ghost Joshua okay the Lord some Praises Caleb represent the True Believer that stays with the Holy Ghost Joshua not stay with headquarters not stay with some man stay with the Holy Ghost that unfold in the word word by word by word by word Revelations up a revelation upon a revolution Oh Glory to God Hallelujah he says no we have the earnest of our inheritance what do we have we have the evidence that God lives we have the evidence that God is with us we have the evidence that God has not forsaken us that is we are his and he is ours because we in our bodies we are now Tabernacle the holy spirit of God that Christ what our father there is nothing that can take that away we are Anchored In Christ now the trees does not have it nature does not have it and yet we are still grown in with them because as yet we we haven't received the fullness of our adoption but we have the illness of it that we were picked up from the things of the world and now become Sons and Daughters of God what kind of people should we be think of it we have the illness our Spirits grown in for full adoption but now we have the earnings of it as we receive the Holy Spirit it is the earnest of our complete adoption or complete salvation huge this is big you know this is this is not skin milk you know this is as we receive the Holy Spirit it is the earnest of our complete adoption or complete salvation and salvation means Deliverance salvation not using I am saved salvation really means Deliverance when you are fully delivered in mind and spirit and body Oh Glory to God Paul was so delivered he said death where is this thing gravy is a victory or give the Lord some Praises Paul was so delivered he said I finished my course I kept the faith Oh Glory to God and I know there's a strong reason for me oh give the Lord some Praises that is when a man comes to the full end because it is finished because it is done that's what Jesus said Oh Glory to God my work is that the meat is the finished work that he has set me to do and when your work is finished it is finished oh give the Lord some presents tonight hallelujah hallelujah praise God the prophet we are waiting for the fullness of adoption this will take place when at the first resurrection when our bodies will be changed from this Vibe creature we are we'll have a body like his own glorious body for we shall see him as he is and we will be like him when he appears we appear in his likeness we will have a body like his a glorious glorified body and all trials and struggles of life will fade off into a little mist and will blow away never to be no more and these Earthly Tabernacles which we've now grown in we are waiting for that illness for the Salvation fully is in its fullness to come but knowing these Tabernacles of clay we have something that tells us that we have raised the fire so far what is the illness it's a little down payment that holds it or once we will love the things of the world once we sinned and went doing things of the world and cared not for God we were eliminated from him without god without Christ in the world and now God sent his Holy Spirit and through that we are lifted above these things now we have the illness and we know we are past some death until life I was trying to show you here's the ordinary sinner down here on the bottom now the Christian goes a lot hard on this he rises above that stuff that is the illness of salvation on this Earth with all kind of issues and gaity and play and what kind of thing like that God brings you up you're in but not of you're in the world but God quickly above we were all Sinners you know we were born in sin shape iniquity but God come and Quicken you and raise your above so you floating yeah Hallelujah walking through hell on this Earth by the quickening power oh praise God now we are waiting for that Resurrection now do you understand say amen he says say Amen what I mean by the earnest the consciously amen we know we have passed from Death until life because we are lifted up we are lifted up not in ourselves but lifted up from the things of the world and we love everybody oh there's a huge one but yeah imagine this message we know the people that love everybody they watch everybody stop talking to you they're crossing the street under any message Liars they are liars there's no messages so you could love me freely I available to be loved [Laughter] glory to God so watch we are lifted up not in ourselves but we live from the things of the world that we and we love everybody and God loves us and we know it and we watch our lives and see that is in the it is in the holy spirit because we don't no more care for the things of the world there you are as long as you love the world or the things of the world then the love of God's Not in you yet as long as you above that then you know you have an inheritance and you're on your way to full Redemption I could drop a bomb right here you know he said you are here what you are somewhere else yeah [Applause] so therefore as we get nearer we're supposed to be shaking of things as we get nearer to The Headstone that we said we get the bright get near The Headstone super Church super race as we near him so as we near him we are getting lighter not heavier with the things of the world not burdened down but cares as we go on approaching him we get enlightened light and lighter because we have to live here ready or not we have to live here hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen all right now you see something that was lost that God has to redeem us what are we what are we redeemed from something we must have lost before you can be redeemed there must be something that redeem us back and all the inheritance that we had had been had to be redeemed back then we must have had something one time that we do not have now but this lamb come to redeem we had something we lost from now notice what did we lose it was given to Adam to have eternal life as long as they eat from the tree of life eternal life we notice again that Adam he inherited the Earth he was like amateur God over the Earth the Earth was his everything was given to his hand he could do whatever he wanted to he named it called it done whatever he wanted to he was truly a Son of God now in the fall Adam forfeit the title did to that so that is where the book comes now the authority do you see it and that is what the voice said who is willing to take the book because what you're doing now you're getting access to the deed the scriptural authority to run this water out nobody could run Satan out Satan didn't buy here you know he was kicked out and fell on the earth he has no deed for The Sinner he has no evidence to purchase you know he is an executive squatter on this land with him controlling the entire world let's read on watch this yeah this is good he said no Adam forfeit that tightly to that he forfeited to Satan Satan took the title deed Adam was thoughtful but he did not redeem his rights for he could not redeem his rights but Satan which does not rightfully own it but he possesses that foreign he is the God of this Earth the Bible said so he possesses that not because he really rightfully gets it but he possesses it now do you get it he's breaking it down now Satan possesses that he holds it into his hand debt is in his hand the Earth is in his hand the world belongs to him every nation belongs to him he governs and controls the whole world everything in the world Satan does you could pick which party you want as we see Satan only Democrats and Lucifer only Republicans that's what I'm saying then whichever you want say this again this is what's saying again Satan he holds it into his hands what in his hand death is in his hands Earth is in his hand the world belongs to him every nation belongs to him including Trinidad that's a lion that's the secret I don't talk about children especially Trinidad in case you didn't know now you know tonight all right he governs and control the whole world and everything in the world Satan does thank God we are not of the world no I don't mean the church he don't control the church he doesn't control the world talk about bright yourself because you never come to decision and brings a condemnity imagine on water and some crazy Force anointed once and so on all right they said he's a god of the world Jesus said he is the God of this Earth has blinded the eyes of the people the God of this Earth he's he God is the god of Heaven okay and he okay so Adam forfeit the title lead to it and we know what happened Satan couldn't hold the title lead so it went back in the hands of the original owner God himself and for hundreds of years nobody can access it because our price had to be paid so the only prophecy saying about lamb come and lamb come and lamb coming Abram Faith Isaac love Jacob Grace to Perfection profit after Prophet build a body word building a pyramid and then come to John the Baptist the next part to introduced the head back Jesus Christ come and cap of the Old Testament become the Cornerstone of the New Testament then he started with Paul and then get Seven Ages to come down to this last age to bring back the Capstone up on a Capstone bride that's where you stand tonight glory to God so we have to go back it is impossible not to go back go glory to God there is going to be a people without spark without breaking our church without spot without Rachel washing the blood of the Lamb there will be a people whose hearts and back literally to the faith of the fathers I ain't talking no spoken with books I have a book I have a tape I'm not talking about that I'm talking about exactly what Peter had what Paul had what the early church have we have to have is the original okay the Lord some praises glory to God hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen [Applause] was the mission of God being revealed Satan wake up from his sleep brother said my name was The Upper Room staggering and whatnot

body with that as far as he consumers speaking in tongues they're dancing and they're shouting and whatnot he ain't bothered with that he said that the whole new wine all is the distance that the purpose makeup with that each other remember can't sleep but when the man the crippled man walked when Peter said stand up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ they say no no no no no that is named

try to purify this world how much we try to make fine homes and things it still doesn't belong to Adam seed it did not go to Adam's seed because Satan took it Lock Stock and Barrel I am really Selena he says Lock Stock and Barrel Adam forfeited it he possessed it but he does not rightfully Own It Satan does foreign he possesses it but he doesn't rightfully Own It Satan does when the rightful owner lost it there's only one way that it can be redeemed to one year Kingsman and that's what we read in the scripture Leviticus they take a Kinsman that's why God couldn't remain God he has to become man okay help me tonight help me tonight help me preach back to me tonight he couldn't remain as Elohim he couldn't mirror the self-existent one he had to connect with us to redeem us and the word became flesh and thrilled Among Us oh I could close us right here tonight oh get the Lord I shout you will see Calvary different you will see the cross different you will see the lamp and the price

tonight Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God not not you may be seated he said there was no man from worthy and our Angels worthy but they know what Kinsman them Angels wasn't one like us but there was no man worthy it had to be a man it had to be a man and the world will become flesh and Jesus Christ had to be a man just like us to redeem us and he went down to the lowest hell and gave Satan a kick where it hurts the most and take the keys of that and hell and he come to release you and set you free I am here that was dead but now is alive have the keys of death and hell will give the Lord a praise offering Tonight death had no power over the blood wash ones oh I feel real Pentecostal right now Lord Give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah death had no power

Lamb redeem to his infinite Mercy his child and forever I am I am redeemed Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb God if this man got poor and lost everything to another man the only way it could be redeemed would be a near Kinsman this man only hold it for a second amount of time it must come back to the original owner it must come back that's why we have to go back to good health that's why the gray had to come back black that's why they'll go back to youth again that's why we'll go back to Eden we must go back to the original no more Oh Glory to God hallelujah that is only a profession God has allowed to bring his children into eternity what can the lots and praises oh can the Lord some praises when God ready to call his children he opened my door contact and you break through the breaker day tendency get the loss on Praises Oh Glory to God your queen back for where you come from oh give the Lord some presents tonight Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God he said if it was letter to his father then it was to him some near Kingsman could come and take it no nobody else they could hold it they could hold the deed on it they could hold the deed until that was paid but when the right man come along for instance if I own a piece of property and I lost it I sold it over to berlinville which is another tribe or a solitaire alien rightfully own it he said they could only for so long and when I try and put the song you had to give you had to come back he said come back you can stay here no more the law of God said you had to move out what about sickness what about diseases what about blindness what about whatever condition inside your body Devil's only having so long that's why you have to be healed forgot to vindicate he's a Healer sick all the time blind all the time

my God oh praise God all right Glory let me continue be going good tonight all right so watch this Jubilee in this Jubilee every man that had lost his inheritance by some means if he was a Freeborn true blooded Israelite no matter who held the possession it had to go back to him free did you hear that like you ain't here free you don't train I like three things it's free you know they paid for already you know Oh Glory to God and we were telling you now the gospel trumpet blowing because night is every time they come to church it's a jubilee being so big you know the gospel is the Jubilee

Pharaoh no more that's ever beaten here go free tonight [Applause] some praises Hallelujah let me continue here now this is important no matter who well The Possession it had to go back to him free he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't have to do a thing just stop what he was doing and go back inheritance stop what do you say stop what he was doing oh dig are you digging foreign job Fork drop everything are going back to my inheritance and and nobody gets up here it is guaranteed by the law of God you could tell God his law said that and according to his law you're coming back so that is why Samson didn't say oh God they got a long time his prayer was not Delilah he wasn't paying whole longer back so God is five years about so God can't take them all alone oh Jesus Hallelujah 10 years ago I feel sorry for them they mess up in the head Samson said avenge me of my two eyes he had a revelation them feelings like I give him their minds is God giving them ice interfere with the eyes that God gave him [Applause] let God judge a man them judging man unto God the eyes he said my two eyes are my son he went past the failure he went past the fall he tell the young man lead me to the middle of the pillar there are you gonna destroy him what I couldn't do all these years now the prophet said God will do in one year what all this theologians fail to do in 2000 years he said give me a church full of the Holy Ghost not for our message Believers you know full of the Holy Ghost not full of mysteries at all full of the Holy Ghost not fill our Apostles and pastors and teachers you know follow the Holy Ghost Hallelujah God will do it one year you wait till them seven Thunders altered their voices the tap group for Glory a slice and cut Hallelujah they all want to wait they had to wait because coming you want a hustle to say the right and they're in front and who in front and who behind them what not nonsense that's all right I know what the prophet said he said he will speak for itself we'd rather raise no flag if we speak for itself not you speak it will speak well glory to God when Peter was on the mountain what the voice said this is my beloved Son in whom is shut up yeah it will speak for itself God will speak you're walking Mickey Mickey and God putting a big thing over here the whole world know he said let the whole world know when you're hiding hide inside that so God put your thing on you I said look at me look at me yeah sure he signal Satan Satan went far far from the corner you know we're going Greenland or wherever you're going two and four over here God said come come come come look at that Mania there's my money man named Joe this is because God know the fate of God is in job oh God you can't own that you can't strike that out job was how he is because of what he is what's inside of him not what's around him he ever swimming pool you have house you have three story house you have car you have everything you think about but he has something more than that she promote everything he will still stand okay the Lord some praises glory to God hallelujah and he proved to Satan that Satan will live still Continental being so stripped his wife tell him why your Curse God and dead and he said though the skin worms destroy my body yet in my flesh I shall see God for myself [Applause] that is the faith of the fathers that other fathers just talk how do you talk what are you speaking are you speaking positive are you speaking and glorifying God are you speaking your weakness and you're speaking the Bible says let the weak sea let the week say let the weak say you still have to say the right thing get the Lord some Praises tonight so that's why you come to church that's why I listen to the tips that way I come to service that you could know how to think and how to talk like your mind can be renewed if your mind no change due to change there are some people do accept responsibility for nothing only making excuses so instead of talk them correct them they won't get excuses only blocking on bobbin waste of time no help for them none waste a type I will tell them like a Jason they'll get plain from me flat nothing and nothing are telling you exactly what eating is wasting your time you have to want to change what's that self-will I want the will of God foreign Still Waters He restored my soul he gives me the path of righteousness for his name's sake yeah though I walk through the valley of the son of No Evil and Joshua say they brought word as what I was in the heart I see yeah God you see what the people God has forced the issue what in the heart does come out all the all the front and the hard and facade and whatever they have in front of them pretending this I'm going to make sure what they had come out they have to bring with us in your heart that's why I praise God but I'm saying when you have sin or your field falling repent God unseat already he see what happens inside their heart they don't they ask God for his Mercy already oh glory to God let me see if we can wrap up here now but see me come here we go now so he just have to stop what he's doing go back to him hear this part he has a right to it so you cannot go and pray soon I pray if you're going to redeem now as a son your Redemption is to bring you back to what you lost so if you go back to sinner while you need to get saved but a random message was the message of salvation the message was a message of Redemption to restore you back to your inheritance that means you had it I don't want a bigger amen than that that means you had it you can't talk I am not worthy we're not talking that talk that's not the language of God that's not the language God wanted to talk I'm not worthy you know you're not worthy don't go there don't go there because where I go in here it doesn't connect with that let me read this back again if he was a Freeborn Israelite no matter who held the possession it had to go back to him free he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't have to do a thing just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance he had a right to it shout outright it was a god-given right do you know this Holy Ghost inheritance is your god-given right over here so I hear from your soul tonight I hear it from your heart tonight glory to God watch it was a god-giving right because he are you ready by Grace had inherited it this inheritance is not my works this inheritance is my grace he inherited it it should have been given to his fathers and had it on year after year no matter what taking place if he lost it it must go free it meant Grace is the way provided for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance that's why God put the claws of Jubilee in this whole thing so if the kage Kinsman brother or family yeah and you don't want to pay to restore you and the redeem you just just leave you alone Jubilee coming in making style beating money you're making style everything whatever you have leave him alone when you're Jubilee come you walk through at your property leave you have to leave [Applause] watch this what a picture give us tonight of the church in this last day you see what man can do and you see what God does What man does is feeling and will feel and us feel always will feel but what God does is eternal forever remains nothing can ever take it away God gives it it is his free gift and by suffering foresight so it and place it there is nothing can move it it is there eternally and the Jubilee was God's manner of expressing Grace to his people for restoring or brought back to the rightful position we need to go back to the power of God and something that can do the same thing today persecution always gives strength to the church we had it too easy we get thoughtful we get to a place where we don't want to move on it's just hand it to us it takes sorrow and tears and sweat and prayer and faith and promise to move forward in the power of the Holy Spirit [Applause] we're after them talking about in this message they have no Rapture to go through they rapture you could sleep pillow put it on the head and cover and put blindness over it you could plaster the horses plastic outside too tightly spoken books you know they take the Holy Ghost to take it up you have to be magnetized to the headstone to go in the rapture not so much I'm here sometimes who is that people people they're just dead stone Dead coming to church Walking Dead Living Dead we get Slot full we get to a place that's the entitlement part so some people they entitled in a message figure because they believe they deserve to go to Rapture so the fears are meriting they're not racism and they win against no it's not that he said we get to a place where we don't want to move on because everything is handed to us it takes sorrow and tears and sweat and prayer and faith and promise to move forward in the power of the holy spirit that seal and power that they had in those days has long time vanished from our assemblies I'm afraid if the windows are shuttle tonight people will run everywhere and never come back you talk more than damn days they were shooting some sisters praise and worshiping God and the bullets fall of their clothes not bullet spells yeah you know people again that shoot that under Fire oh here we go another thing is too bad to think of those things happening like that or yet it proves that God that was in the old days is still got today the God that was ever remains God expect his people to keep their vows and their promises but when we get everything so easy we just slip along and the first thing you know we gone out from these things losing our inheritance did you notice someone close did you notice that if a man bought a property property inside a walled City then he had wanted to redeem that back if he sold it and if he didn't redeem it back that property it was inside of the wall had to stay in there couldn't go free it was bound to stay there they were over the wall then he say what it is I'm so afraid of the things that we had in the beginning the old timers the world city I'm afraid that too many of us too many our Pentecostal people God has got walled into some denomination and will never hear the sound of the Jubilee never come again back to inheritance if this applied to the message some of them people can't even get to the inheritance any message but no inheritance they come out but they are going in do you see God bring out a Catholic Baptist Methodist Hindu Muslim whatever God call you out not to call you out Redemption is two parts come out to go in to go anywhere inheritance let's put it back in the Bible they came out of Egypt to go where into Canaan land what was that what was separating them from Jordan what Jordan represents that that across Jordan to go in the land and when they get Inland they have to fight to possess it and then they get the rest divided because the Joshua's comments mission was to take them over and give them their inheritance divide the people their portion after the fight not before you fight you're laughing and you're fighting and you're looking to get inheritance they're not gonna work it takes sweat prayer labor is that people like the community and in partner Victory part oh my Hallelujah remember the ones that was involved it never got to go free there were Bond slaves the rest of the time the owner owned them or if they had inheritance and the city that was Walden but outside little bitty cities I wasn't holding it was concerned like the planes now we find out that in these last days in our organization of Pentecost that we have come in and organized ourselves and rejected the leadership of the Holy Spirit by the wisdom of some groups of people instead of having fellowship with one another it divided us and separated us into several different organisms of people and in doing so it has broke up our inheritance that's how God interprets all these divisions all these bad seeds and ministers putting out to the people to fight this one and fight that one and they buy me past a fighter they're fighting on the government fighting the pastor and you say my people love to have it so all I know there's a requirement here to make that rapture there's a core requirement here to get prepared and nobody have the license on that requirement is right in the word everything for the bride to be made ready isn't the message Oh Glory to God and we have to fight to find it fight the preacher fighter get it come on [Applause] now these walls inside if we ever get walled into a place where we can't accept the word and the Holy Spirit and have to take Creeds and so forth of a church instead of the power of the Holy Spirit the Jubilee will never mean nothing to that person no matter how much you can say mother left you your inheritance daddy did that and you sold out and walled up and come into a Creed accept this Dogma that was injected into your fellowship instead of being free and in Christ and letting the Holy Spirit lead us now a man and his family could go back to the original inheritance if they could hear the Jubilee a trumpet song and the trumpet is the gospel and when they hear it they know what it means and they know that that's inheritance no matter where they lost how far they went back whatever they had to do they had the privilege to come and receive inheritance the whole family could come and receive their urgence I'm going to close with this so tonight so tonight men and women here of Louisiana that knows the things that we do know and have heard from our brothers and different ones of our Pentecostal experience of years ago and we have walled off we haven't walled ourselves away from it so far as we got to hear what somebody says instead of what thus say the Lord is no is the O of Jubilee I'm going to close to this come back to your original inheritance to a real Holy Ghost again you mean the real Holy Ghost yes is inheritance yes remember he can go free you didn't have to pay nothing and after do nothing just get up and go oh my my my the church knows like Israel the tradition like Israel when it come out of Egypt when Israel was done in Egypt God buys marvelous Grace without any organization he called Israel from his out of Egypt he called them to the inheritance hear this part Grace foolish I'm a prophet Grace give them a pillar of Fire Grace give them a lamb sacrificial lamb Grace give them power Grace give them Deliverance Grace give them Victory Grace give them all these things they dance in the spirit shouted praise God about it and little did they know when they were dancing on the banks of the Jordan 40 years away from the land there was there was about five days away but they make a mistake Exodus 19 where they accepted law instead of Grace remember it's been man's idea that's the nature of man when he was lost instead of going back to God's for Grace he tried to make himself an apron and ever since then he tried to have something to do with Redemption when Redemption is a free offer of Grace by God there is nothing you can do to save yourself God save you know yet all you can do but man wants something to do into it Allah [Music] oh worship Him [Music] thank you I remember Oh Glory Hallelujah [Music] let's sing Lord Lift Me Up
