[1:20:34] made announcement for your launch and I
[1:20:36] know there was launched but he was like
[1:20:38] you know so I want to correct this
[1:20:41] because I was discussing with brother
[1:20:43] Moses there is breakfast for those of
[1:20:46] you that really are not opportunity to
[1:20:48] have your breakfast in the hotel here
[1:20:50] and then you can have your breakfast a
[1:20:53] detains between the hours before the
[1:20:56] service or the doors are opened and then
[1:20:59] after that we also expect usually we
[1:21:04] feel that when the service the morning
[1:21:06] service is over we don't have enough
[1:21:09] time so and like today the door we open
[1:21:13] by 1:00 p.m. I want to give back our
[1:21:15] time and make it very lighter for
[1:21:18] everyone so because of these I had
[1:21:22] announced yesterday that I'll be
[1:21:23] launched I know also that that was food
[1:21:26] lunch was ready as at that time so
[1:21:28] please what I'm trying to say is if we
[1:21:31] finish very late and then you are too
[1:21:33] hungry to eat you can make some
[1:21:35] exceptional requests to that effect
[1:21:37] maybe because of your health or whatever
[1:21:39] we wouldn't like anybody to stop all be
[1:21:41] hungry but we are looking at a time and
[1:21:44] then we want to really achieve the
[1:21:46] purpose why we came here so that will be
[1:21:48] launched by Adina as usual that will
[1:21:52] also be bright fast I know some of you
[1:21:54] also had your breakfast and please in
[1:21:58] your hotel rooms try to make them clean
[1:21:59] as you stay because it will be very nice
[1:22:03] the Bible say cleanliness is next to
[1:22:05] godliness I know it's not been very easy
[1:22:08] for you or try your best to make an
[1:22:11] environment clean and you should you
[1:22:14] have any question or you have any
[1:22:16] problem or whatever please meet any of
[1:22:18] the diggings I'm sure we would do the
[1:22:21] March we can the best we can to make
[1:22:24] your stay here very comfortable so we
[1:22:26] thank you so much for your cooperation
[1:22:29] go richly bless you
[1:22:31] [Applause]
[1:22:37] so what can I say we have to get into
[1:22:46] the Department of the word praise God a
[1:22:50] man and the man I want to bring to the
[1:22:56] pulpit is not a stranger to you he is
[1:22:59] being among the gods generals that have
[1:23:02] really been in the battlefield over
[1:23:05] decades of the case of periods of times
[1:23:09] and there we are we have the pleasure to
[1:23:13] bring to the pulpit the man of God
[1:23:19] another person than pastor Reverend
[1:23:24] doctor but our reality
[1:23:36] [Applause]
[1:23:40] I don't know what else to say I love him
[1:23:43] so much from my heart just wait a minute
[1:23:48] I don't want to take your time but you
[1:23:49] know it's good to say something good
[1:23:52] about somebody I remember when I left
[1:23:58] colaba and then I came to a new group I
[1:24:02] was born and brought up in Legos anyway
[1:24:06] my parents home I stayed here my people
[1:24:08] still live there for those of you who
[1:24:10] know they're for coming back every
[1:24:14] holidays our Legos was my church and
[1:24:17] then I go back to school and ubu happen
[1:24:20] to be my church for you some of you
[1:24:23] young people when you go to school maybe
[1:24:26] outside of your home church nobody sees
[1:24:28] you around in any fellowship
[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:32] [Applause]
[1:24:36] [Music]
[1:24:38] when I would when I would come now we
[1:24:42] have more beautiful churches now in
[1:24:43] those days we don't have anything in
[1:24:47] fact is when you set in and you see the
[1:24:49] church you will believe what the people
[1:24:51] have told you they call us all kinds of
[1:24:53] name in those days and if you ever we
[1:24:56] enter such places you will just turn
[1:24:58] away and say look at how their church
[1:25:00] look like but that was not what I was
[1:25:03] looking for I was looking for the world
[1:25:06] and then I could come to a fellowship
[1:25:10] whereby I will be fed not only being fed
[1:25:13] that day as I'm going home I'll be
[1:25:16] giving one terms of assignment and that
[1:25:20] is for me to go and feed more at home
[1:25:22] those are the things that mode me
[1:25:24] they're more than me so what a ministers
[1:25:30] come here preaching to you read your
[1:25:32] Bible really summon books they are made
[1:25:36] more accessible to you
[1:25:38] health care is a difficult thing in
[1:25:41] Nigeria today because it's not made an
[1:25:43] easily accessible but the Word of God is
[1:25:46] made is they accessible to all of us so
[1:25:49] why can't we get more and more of it and
[1:25:51] give strong for the Lord and I want to
[1:25:55] let you know I can't tell it all if
[1:25:57] you're tell me to talk about the
[1:25:59] testimonies of the blessings I received
[1:26:01] under brother always ministry I believe
[1:26:04] that I would not be able to finish it
[1:26:07] till I die it is not just to over say
[1:26:11] something but is to tell you the truth
[1:26:13] and the blessings are still what is
[1:26:16] bestowed and they are still what you are
[1:26:18] saying
[1:26:19] and he's been a blessing not only to me
[1:26:22] to my family and I say is he going that
[1:26:26] and on and on and I want to say brother
[1:26:29] all would thank you for giving to the
[1:26:31] Lord

[1:34:49] you and it's been many of us have been
[1:34:53] isida from way back and coming to these

[1:34:57] made quite a few more brothers precious
[1:35:00] brothers who we didn't get a chance to
[1:35:02] know before but since we got to know
[1:35:04] them fernanda they're really lovely
[1:35:07] brothers you know kindred spirit and we
[1:35:09] thank you for being here again this year

[1:35:14] spoken ahead of me who wanted to thank
[1:35:16] you for your reward for your messages
[1:35:19] for testimonies and I have to run pick
[1:35:24] up the crumbs this morning and
[1:35:27] transforming into crumb cake so I trust
[1:35:32] that go help me I always do that because
[1:35:34] a minute not because I'm trying to talk
[1:35:36] nice and be humble I really wish that
[1:35:40] was true but really when you come up to
[1:35:44] this message here it's tough to you it's
[1:35:50] tough to find anything else left to say
[1:35:51] but anyway trust that God will help us
[1:35:55] again this morning anyway I I have a few
[1:35:59] conduct scriptures Isaiah 55 I think
[1:36:04] it's verse 7 maybe let me read that
[1:36:06] brother over the thing read that
[1:36:07] yesterday because I want to cut this
[1:36:12] subject of sowing and reaping from a
[1:36:16] little different angle
[1:36:28] alright let the wicked forsake his
[1:36:30] thoughts now let me read it from verse 6
[1:36:32] the thing that's way brother theory from
[1:36:34] last night seek ye the Lord while he may
[1:36:37] be found call ye upon him while he is
[1:36:39] near let the wicked forsake his way and
[1:36:42] the unrighteous man his thoughts and let
[1:36:45] him return unto the Lord and He will
[1:36:47] have mercy upon him and to our God for
[1:36:50] he will abundantly pardon I like the way
[1:36:53] the babble is you know resist things and
[1:36:56] is a is a rich guys and abundant God and
[1:36:59] he he has all the works and he and he
[1:37:02] means every single thing that he says he
[1:37:04] is an abundant God is a God of abundance
[1:37:07] so he will pardon
[1:37:09] there is nothing there's no sin no wrong
[1:37:13] that he can't he doesn't have the
[1:37:15] pattern for his pattern is abundant
[1:37:18] oh my verse 8 for my thoughts are not
[1:37:22] your thoughts neither are your ways my
[1:37:24] ways hear the Lord for as the heavens
[1:37:27] are higher than the earth so are my ways
[1:37:29] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[1:37:31] than your thoughts that's really saying
[1:37:35] something I forgot to say that his
[1:37:38] thoughts and our thoughts on a totally
[1:37:40] different level so I got a little for
[1:37:44] this morning and a little excitation to
[1:37:47] admonish you to think different and I
[1:37:51] trust and pray and hope that by the time
[1:37:55] this convention is done and I know girls
[1:37:57] really tremendously a bit blessed us in
[1:37:59] a tremendous manner I wasn't here the
[1:38:02] first day so means for the Akers message
[1:38:04] but I suffered a chalice message online
[1:38:06] when we were coming and I think he was
[1:38:09] low here is it for you
[1:38:12] totally outstanding and then yesterday
[1:38:16] morning brother Isaac there's some that
[1:38:21] there preaches and there are approaches
[1:38:23] there are those of us who pretend to
[1:38:25] preach and they are those who real
[1:38:28] preach and brother Isaac is one of them
[1:38:31] ma and Cheri is here to reap
[1:38:34] and the yesterday afternoon the test
[1:38:36] mention on the brothers button and a sub
[1:38:38] so wonderful wonderful so good to meet
[1:38:41] you to know you but little was with you
[1:38:43] last year right and so so god bless you
[1:38:47] brother so glad to meet you and to know
[1:38:49] you and thank you for those words
[1:38:51] brother brother LAN C and brother Emil
[1:38:55] thank you so much for your words also
[1:38:57] and last night they rely on the word
[1:39:06] thank about the fear for those lovely
[1:39:08] words last night so I who are in a
[1:39:13] convention after Trina who are in
[1:39:15] brother Wes estimation in West Palm
[1:39:17] Beach and brother Theo was there myself
[1:39:20] but array thumbs in for that chance we
[1:39:23] are a tremendous John Cena was totally
[1:39:25] of the chats but the orbits Commission
[1:39:27] totally of the chats and then when who
[1:39:30] west bumping the fallen weakened and
[1:39:31] immobile Wesco many of Ross member was
[1:39:34] performing way back in the past and he
[1:39:36] have this convention he was absolutely
[1:39:39] mind-bending stuff
[1:39:41] it was totally outstanding also and
[1:39:44] brother fuel myself brother Ray were
[1:39:46] talking and said we really thoroughly
[1:39:48] enjoyed the convention I know because
[1:39:50] we're not preaching so just come for the
[1:39:53] service like you do and you go to the
[1:39:56] room you relax and you come back and you
[1:39:58] come in start getting the service when
[1:40:01] you have to preach and you see your
[1:40:04] notes being taken away from you
[1:40:06] word on top of world on top of water on
[1:40:09] top of world it's tough to enjoy the
[1:40:11] convention that way so anyway proof for
[1:40:15] me I don't have much of a message but I
[1:40:18] so pretend like you I hear any message
[1:40:21] okay I don't change you tell a lie so
[1:40:25] just pretend like you're having it
[1:40:27] you're in a message okay will you do
[1:40:29] that for me
[1:40:31] all right so the preachers are already
[1:40:34] preached all right and the preachers are
[1:40:37] coming after me to preach so both for
[1:40:39] those of us who try to make like we are
[1:40:41] preachers just pretend like you are
[1:40:44] hearing a message okay all right
[1:40:46] say preaching Jesus the Bible said when
[1:40:49] he met those two hundred emails and he
[1:40:52] was going he made like he was gonna go
[1:40:54] beyond because he's decent
[1:40:57] he won't say I'm gonna come to your
[1:40:59] house now have any meal for me you
[1:41:01] wanted them to invite him so just do
[1:41:04] like Jesus be just make like you are
[1:41:07] enjoying the message okay all right so
[1:41:11] my tattoo is a little unusual and I hope
[1:41:15] I will be able to like you know get my
[1:41:20] thoughts together my child is thinking
[1:41:23] differently thinking differently and I
[1:41:28] will chose had this inspiration are just
[1:41:33] like we came from trina and OVD you know
[1:41:36] the the harvest and it was really
[1:41:39] totally tremendous and and but the child
[1:41:43] you know grows here with sowing and
[1:41:46] reaping they were so in tears shall reap
[1:41:48] in joy and it's a bit about sowing and
[1:41:52] reaping is more important to you than
[1:41:54] you possibly will ever realize but a
[1:41:58] choice and hope that through this course
[1:41:59] of these meetings from other channels I
[1:42:01] mean brother acres message through the
[1:42:02] channels you are getting a bit of a
[1:42:04] glimpse of what it is all about showing
[1:42:08] unripened because it's a is a principle
[1:42:11] of life that affects you more than you
[1:42:14] would ever think of it's affects you
[1:42:16] more than you catch you understand or
[1:42:19] care to like you know or you might know
[1:42:22] maybe not maybe you care but you might
[1:42:24] not realize the effect is so much like
[1:42:26] that so just want to talk to you a
[1:42:27] little bit about that and how that you
[1:42:29] know all put together into you thinking
[1:42:32] differently thinking differently as a
[1:42:33] Christian as a believer as a minister
[1:42:36] whoever you are whatever your life's
[1:42:38] purpose because that's how you are going
[1:42:40] to come to perfection
[1:42:41] amen you can do this
[1:42:44] regular thing like everybody else is
[1:42:45] doing and then hope to be you know in
[1:42:48] the rapture it's not gonna walk that way
[1:42:50] the price a little different like what
[1:42:52] the channel said super rich super
[1:42:54] piranhas are a super brother super
[1:42:56] sister so we're super we're a little bit
[1:42:58] above the regular shade amen you were
[1:43:02] not like everybody else you were
[1:43:04] different from them amen and I can't say
[1:43:08] that our are strong enough for young
[1:43:12] people because there's so much attack on
[1:43:15] the message these days that you really
[1:43:17] wonder and you see the cooling off
[1:43:20] especially among the younger folks but
[1:43:21] everybody just if you can if you there
[1:43:23] but Moses said we will not leave one
[1:43:25] hoof behind so even if it's one person
[1:43:27] it's a concern to us but if you
[1:43:31] understand and know and believe the
[1:43:33] revelation of God in his word that you
[1:43:37] are different you are not like everybody
[1:43:38] else God has a special purpose special
[1:43:42] place for you in bringing you here if
[1:43:44] you really understand and believe that
[1:43:45] and shake yourself and pull yourself
[1:43:48] back the you might begin to understand
[1:43:51] like that is a privilege the hanno to be
[1:43:53] calling to this intimation of the hour
[1:43:55] Amen because this message is not for
[1:43:57] everybody this makes for a special breed
[1:44:00] a special group of people and you are
[1:44:03] that special group of people
[1:44:04] Oh glory to God amen amen
[1:44:09] let me get my but a few is not seen me
[1:44:12] so let me get my loose sheets together
[1:44:14] here with you you're not looking okay
[1:44:20] this one is you know I mean I'm struck
[1:44:23] with this one here okay let me let me
[1:44:25] let me remove my jacket can I thank you
[1:44:38] it used to be years ago I would preach I
[1:44:41] won't even put on the jacket but I grew
[1:44:43] up and became more cultured so Ryan put
[1:44:45] a jacket on I want to go in the pulpit I
[1:44:47] remove it so my jackets last a long time
[1:44:49] okay no seriously sir so don't feel sure
[1:44:59] for me oh but although he's gonna I
[1:45:01] gotta get my jacket don't don't don't
[1:45:02] spare yourself the thought my jacket
[1:45:05] feels very very new so anyway sowing and
[1:45:11] reaping and I just talked to you is the
[1:45:13] principle of life like I said that means
[1:45:15] motive I could maybe you realize because
[1:45:19] we had got seed and Jesus said the Word
[1:45:23] of God is a seed and seats as sown and
[1:45:28] planted not the words sown and planted
[1:45:31] there's a showing that they planted the
[1:45:33] two different things a little different
[1:45:35] a little different and what is soul you
[1:45:39] are going to reap Amen so this principle
[1:45:42] yeah you wanna apply it in every single
[1:45:45] area of our lives more than we ever
[1:45:47] might understand or realize because this
[1:45:51] principle comes from before the
[1:45:52] finishing of the wall comes from God's
[1:45:54] mind before the foundation of the wall
[1:45:56] and this principle is table is a
[1:45:58] standard is a principle that permits
[1:46:01] every single area of life this place
[1:46:04] will produce the creation this principle
[1:46:06] of sowing and reaping produce a perfect
[1:46:09] world a prophet earth that God created
[1:46:11] this principle of sowing and reaping
[1:46:14] produce a perfect Garden of Eden with a
[1:46:17] perfect man there is son of God on the
[1:46:19] face of the earth standing there and I'm
[1:46:21] achieve God on the face of the earth
[1:46:23] which talking about power God's or Adam
[1:46:26] and reaped a prophet man because Adam
[1:46:29] was a seed of the words and God read a
[1:46:32] man a son of God that became the flesh
[1:46:36] of the world the Word made flesh was
[1:46:39] sowing and reaping amen amen
[1:46:42] so this is a very powerful thought here
[1:46:45] it may be called it comes from God's
[1:46:46] mind
[1:46:47] this principle produced a prophet man on
[1:46:51] the face of the earth
[1:46:52] amen this boot on Adam from his seat of
[1:46:55] the world into the flesh of the world
[1:46:57] the world made flesh
[1:46:59] a perfect man stain on the face of the
[1:47:01] earth this principle here made Adam the
[1:47:04] Supreme Being the sprinkler the top of
[1:47:07] God's creation on the face of the earth
[1:47:09] and this same principle is here walking
[1:47:12] on you and I and you know turn ours
[1:47:14] amen into the capstone bride of Jesus
[1:47:16] Christ the top of God's creation in the
[1:47:20] seven church age is sowing and reaping
[1:47:25] amen if we go in Eden but the Bronco
[1:47:28] actually called Genesis the seed chapter
[1:47:31] of the Bible every seed was planned in
[1:47:33] Genesis
[1:47:34] amen and that's what that's what I
[1:47:36] prophet him to show us to let us know
[1:47:38] that every seed was then Genesis because
[1:47:41] before if you want a manifesto of
[1:47:43] anything it's gotta be planted somewhere
[1:47:45] there's gotta be a sowing frost before
[1:47:48] there is a manifestation or a reaping
[1:47:51] amen glory to God amen glory to God amen
[1:47:56] amen so sowing and reaping is an eternal
[1:48:00] truth of God amen that works in all of
[1:48:04] life it works within the church it works
[1:48:06] without the church unbelievers used the
[1:48:09] principle and it works for them
[1:48:10] Christians used the principle and it
[1:48:12] works for them the husband used the
[1:48:14] principle arranged is what you works for
[1:48:16] him wife usually works for her the
[1:48:18] businessman usually works for him the
[1:48:21] student usually works for him is the
[1:48:22] principle of life because God put it
[1:48:25] there if a Christian from a source and
[1:48:28] it was necesitas he will reap a harvest
[1:48:31] if an atheist farmer source and observe
[1:48:35] the same principles he will reap the
[1:48:36] same average is that right can I get a
[1:48:39] witness back amen amen
[1:48:43] so this principle is not for believers
[1:48:46] alone though we are focusing on the
[1:48:49] believers because that's what we are by
[1:48:51] the grace of Almighty God but I'm just
[1:48:53] going to show you this principle is the
[1:48:54] principle that comes from God and God
[1:48:57] put this principle there to work for men
[1:49:00] and walk in man and walk through
[1:49:02] and is by this principle value and I had
[1:49:04] today
[1:49:05] the people are sowing and reaping amen
[1:49:10] now Jesus said the soul went is sow the
[1:49:16] seed I have but the rail read a quote
[1:49:21] one time differentiating sowing and
[1:49:25] planting your sewing is more like
[1:49:30] topsoil it doesn't go so deep but
[1:49:34] planting goes much deeper and that's
[1:49:38] what we are America for planted and
[1:49:40] sowed the seed of the entire Bible so
[1:49:44] whether it's planted or sword it up to
[1:49:47] you you can change that and the Bible
[1:49:51] says nothing but the Oviedo somebody
[1:49:53] coulda died yesterday so break up your
[1:49:55] fallow ground so you have to see it is
[1:49:56] sword and ready
[1:49:57] break up your fallow ground for it's
[1:50:00] time to seek the Lord because as you do
[1:50:02] that then the city goes down deep down
[1:50:04] and takes root in your soul and out of
[1:50:08] your belly shall flow the Tree of Life
[1:50:10] growing again or hallelujah glory to God
[1:50:15] amen
[1:50:16] sopia decent man I was talking about the
[1:50:18] sewing gather in my name and sowing and
[1:50:21] reaping amen amen
[1:50:26] produce a harvest in Eden and Adam was
[1:50:29] the full of the harvest and this same
[1:50:34] principle will produce in this end time
[1:50:35] here a bride a bride and that's why God
[1:50:39] has a caller after the Prophet
[1:50:40] initiative saw the word to go into the
[1:50:44] prophets message and amen and check off
[1:50:47] his words that he already sold and take
[1:50:49] the same words and and speak them back
[1:50:51] to you and what are those words those
[1:50:54] seeds with tears of revelation and
[1:50:57] inspiration think people over there was
[1:50:59] so much clearly last night oh it's
[1:51:01] beautiful
[1:51:01] those beautiful bringing the seed the
[1:51:03] watering Amen for the preacher the
[1:51:06] watching by the praises outstanding so
[1:51:09] much clarity on the world support melaka
[1:51:12] for brought the world
[1:51:13] he brought the revelation and we come
[1:51:15] a minister commenting on the prophet and
[1:51:17] with tears of Revelation inspiration
[1:51:20] they have watered the seats in your soul
[1:51:22] and you take the same word and pick up
[1:51:25] your final crown of your heart and let
[1:51:27] the word go down deep because if the
[1:51:29] series tops all you are not going to
[1:51:31] last much longer
[1:51:33] you are not going to last very long if
[1:51:35] the series topsoil thus it can be the
[1:51:37] best seed if you take a good seat and
[1:51:41] put on this ground here and put some
[1:51:43] soil here on this gun here you have you
[1:51:46] have sowed the seed but for that seat to
[1:51:49] really become what it's supposed to be
[1:51:50] you need to break up this ground and let
[1:51:53] that sit go down deep but God
[1:51:56] cut the so of the preacher like who this
[1:51:59] convention shows the world
[1:52:01] Malekith already solid so we just come
[1:52:04] back to recycle it back so the word and
[1:52:08] when you what comes to you in frozen
[1:52:10] different kinds of a hearts different
[1:52:12] kind of sorrow but you how to take the
[1:52:15] words the seed and say no this is not
[1:52:18] gonna be topsoil
[1:52:19] you'll break up your fallow ground and
[1:52:22] drink up the word of the Spirit and the
[1:52:25] word goes down deep in your soul and
[1:52:28] begins to germinate because the TIC
[1:52:30] roots and you begin like solid and no
[1:52:34] man can shake here no man can talk about
[1:52:36] that word because only certain your soul
[1:52:39] is planted in your soul
[1:52:41] so I say Monica for already come and
[1:52:44] soared and planted the seed of the
[1:52:47] entire Bible and it's in your soul this
[1:52:50] morning can you say Amen
[1:52:53] amen you may be seated
[1:52:58] Susu inner reaping produce in Eden a
[1:53:03] perfect man on the face of the earth
[1:53:05] Adam with preeminence sees on the face
[1:53:09] of the other working my subject really
[1:53:11] ISM living in preeminence easy amen so
[1:53:19] serene reaping producing Adam a perfect
[1:53:24] man who was living in preeminence ease
[1:53:26] and this same principle Parisian the
[1:53:29] bright at the ends I'm here a prophet
[1:53:31] bright living in preeminence ease
[1:53:34] you're gonna find out what it means to
[1:53:36] live in preeminence is Amen before we
[1:53:38] finish shows that God will help us amen
[1:53:44] sowing and reaping you wanna hear today
[1:53:47] Justin leaving believe in God that we
[1:53:52] will be harvested like Adam was a
[1:53:54] perfect man on the face of the earth
[1:53:56] even because the seed has been playing
[1:53:58] our souls and we are respond to that
[1:54:01] seed and we are doing all we know to do
[1:54:02] to pick up a fallow ground so that sheep
[1:54:05] goes deep down and takes root in a
[1:54:09] source on our hats Oh hallelujah
[1:54:12] unlike pathological charities get a reap
[1:54:15] and Charlie will reap all of God's
[1:54:18] Saints that been planted and sewed by
[1:54:20] Malecha for and you are one of those
[1:54:23] season up in plan and super melaka for
[1:54:25] so by this principle amen so in a
[1:54:28] reaping man in every area of life
[1:54:31] achieve the purpose that desire every
[1:54:37] purpose of managership by this principle
[1:54:40] in all of life's areas inside the church
[1:54:43] outside the church you're unbelievable
[1:54:45] friends everybody because man is wired
[1:54:48] by God to live by the principles of God
[1:54:50] whether they acknowledge God or not
[1:54:51] because the one the rules and reigns in
[1:54:54] the affairs of men he created man and
[1:54:56] this Pebble watch
[1:54:59] these gospel works even when they don't
[1:55:01] acknowledge it is you what's in their
[1:55:03] lives
[1:55:04] glory to God amen oh brother
[1:55:09] amen amen so by this principle here amen
[1:55:14] sowing and reaping the Prophet Malachi 4
[1:55:18] has come and a sword and planted the
[1:55:21] seed of the entire Bible in order that a
[1:55:24] perfect brow will come forth and by this
[1:55:26] same principle this bride is gonna be
[1:55:29] reaped have a said like Adam Wars by
[1:55:33] charity which is had a reap now
[1:55:36] amen you know repay a perfect man stand
[1:55:40] on the face of the earth in the beauty
[1:55:42] of his audience don't ever let the
[1:55:44] message become a cliche to you
[1:55:45] just words that are spoken don't let it
[1:55:48] become a cliche to you and the way to do
[1:55:51] that is gonna break up your fallow
[1:55:52] ground your shallow ground break it out
[1:55:55] let the seat go down deep you can't
[1:55:59] afford to be a so-so believer you can't
[1:56:02] afford to be a wishy-washy Christian you
[1:56:05] cannot afford to be a fellow crime
[1:56:06] believer you cannot afford to be a
[1:56:08] shallow ground believer you gotta break
[1:56:10] up your fallow ground leather watch
[1:56:12] accrues if you are the only man in your
[1:56:15] school only get on your street amen your
[1:56:19] Jutes are deep and your roots are deep
[1:56:22] and they go way back into Elohim is mind
[1:56:24] and the devil can shake here the devil
[1:56:28] can shake here you believe that glory so
[1:56:41] like I said sowing and reaping is a
[1:56:44] simple principle of God and it comes
[1:56:49] from way before the finishing of the
[1:56:50] world
[1:56:51] is it full of God and God her thoughts
[1:56:55] thoughts thoughts on his mind and soon a
[1:56:59] ripping he was one of his thoughts one
[1:57:01] of his principles amen and God's
[1:57:06] thoughts is there are not our thoughts
[1:57:09] his ways are not our ways
[1:57:13] as you prefer the richer you say my
[1:57:15] thoughts are not your thoughts in other
[1:57:17] words my thoughts on sowing and reaping
[1:57:22] and not the same as your thoughts on
[1:57:26] sowing and reaping and I prove that you
[1:57:28] in a minute if some my thoughts are not
[1:57:32] your thoughts neither are your ways my
[1:57:37] ways because you have thoughts and then
[1:57:40] you have ways to make thus those
[1:57:43] thoughts come to pass
[1:57:44] amen and God said for as the heavens are
[1:57:50] high above the earth so are my thoughts
[1:57:53] higher than your thoughts and my ways
[1:57:56] higher than your ways I have thoughts I
[1:57:59] have ways of going about my things that
[1:58:02] are so much higher than your ways and
[1:58:05] your thoughts but if you take on this up
[1:58:07] here you will never understand what I'm
[1:58:12] about and that's why Jesus came those
[1:58:13] religious people were so earthbound they
[1:58:17] could never figure him out and that's
[1:58:19] why people cannot figure this message
[1:58:20] out because this message is the manna
[1:58:23] God is the Son of God from the
[1:58:25] foundation of the world in so much
[1:58:28] higher than anything this world has ever
[1:58:30] found a man you may be seated
[1:58:43] if you understand what you are received
[1:58:47] what this message represents and I hope
[1:58:54] God will help me to be able to show you
[1:58:55] I hope I don't keep it till 1 o'clock to
[1:59:00] where you will understand and know that
[1:59:05] the Christian life is easy
[1:59:10] say easy it's easier than leaving I
[1:59:14] don't believe in life he say it's hard
[1:59:18] life is hard
[1:59:20] you may be seated life is hard
[1:59:23] go as the baby in the womb way it's
[1:59:26] protected everything it wants to eat it
[1:59:29] kicks his mother some more makes the
[1:59:31] mother feel hungry the mother eats food
[1:59:32] and the baby gets fed but once the time
[1:59:37] comes the baby comes of age that baby
[1:59:39] comes on the face of the earth here it's
[1:59:40] very fast second on the earth you say
[1:59:44] welcome to the world baby is it to fall
[1:59:46] you are in so don't tell me Christine is
[1:59:49] tough because going to school is tough
[1:59:50] going to work is tough going to the
[1:59:53] family family stuff everything is tough
[1:59:55] life is tough but compared to all of
[1:59:59] that this cosplay is easy because God is
[2:00:03] your enabler combated easy for you to
[2:00:07] live a Christian life unless you don't
[2:00:09] want to is not hard but unders it's easy
[2:00:14] can I use your MA
[2:00:17] already you may be seated
[2:00:32] it'll be so out of character for God to
[2:00:36] make live in a Christian life for a
[2:00:39] surgeon or is it difficult
[2:00:40] so out of character for God you say he
[2:00:43] will abundantly pardon he said I come
[2:00:47] that you might have life and have it
[2:00:48] more abundantly
[2:00:49] so he's here to give you a point on here
[2:00:52] you are the only one in your school is
[2:00:55] he here to give you a pond on hell what
[2:00:56] you cannot do for use that the
[2:00:58] practicality for yourself he cannot do
[2:01:00] that for you because you can plant a
[2:01:02] seed and pick up the fallow ground in
[2:01:05] your natural and the natural one and put
[2:01:07] a seal in there but if the seed has to
[2:01:10] do some things of itself you pour water
[2:01:13] and over but that's it has to break out
[2:01:16] itself die and Jesus says and John 12:24
[2:01:21] I believe except they color with
[2:01:23] fall into the ground and die it abides
[2:01:27] alone boy refers to the granite I shall
[2:01:30] bring forth fruit and more fruit a much
[2:01:33] fruit that's your you get a break up
[2:01:39] your fallow go yourself and do the dying
[2:01:41] yourself I can't do the time for you you
[2:01:44] can do the time for me your pastor can
[2:01:46] do the time for you you can do the damn
[2:01:49] for yourself for anybody else you go to
[2:01:51] the time for yourself
[2:01:53] that's a break up your fallow ground
[2:01:54] break up your spirit break up your own
[2:01:57] ways break up yourself Styles break up
[2:02:01] your spritz upon you you can do that
[2:02:05] yourself you may be seated
[2:02:14] Oh glory amen
[2:02:20] so like Adam where God's seed got seed
[2:02:25] of his word
[2:02:26] I like Adam we're gonna be reap as the
[2:02:31] flesh of the world the Word made flesh
[2:02:34] and that's why I say Malaka for already
[2:02:36] sold and planted the seed of the entire
[2:02:40] Bible and we have the see we have the
[2:02:43] word I'm people GMI but an analyst
[2:02:46] yesterday how dare you speak against the
[2:02:48] message but if you want to go on ahead
[2:02:50] but the angels here in it not
[2:02:52] threatening you not wouldn't fail you
[2:02:54] but the angel is hearing it when Ottoman
[2:02:58] is so way higher than the closest know
[2:03:01] which is panic oh so much higher they
[2:03:04] are fine painting cross-reference fine
[2:03:05] the pretty water God you here wow this
[2:03:08] is incredible this is great but when it
[2:03:10] comes to it is top speed yo it stops
[2:03:12] here it doesn't go way back but for the
[2:03:16] function of the world
[2:03:16] only one man William Branham have the
[2:03:19] ministry
[2:03:21] privation one if you say snow william
[2:03:26] branham you gotta find that man or you
[2:03:28] are going to say earthbound because
[2:03:30] Jesus the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:03:33] which God gave to him and which is sent
[2:03:36] by his angel unto his servant John
[2:03:39] you've got to find who that angel is if
[2:03:43] you say something like a four that's
[2:03:44] fine but you got a friend that angel
[2:03:46] because that revelation is going to show
[2:03:49] you things that are to be things that
[2:03:52] were before the words were from things
[2:03:55] that are the things that are to be no
[2:03:58] man no other man has that ministry to
[2:04:01] check into the mana card and bring costs
[2:04:04] Austin to you and I so we are the
[2:04:06] preview like this morning we have the
[2:04:08] thoughts of God in the form of a message
[2:04:11] so far higher than anything this world
[2:04:15] can ever produce so far higher than
[2:04:19] anything regular Christianity can never
[2:04:21] produce that you say
[2:04:23] [Music]
[2:04:23] [Applause]
[2:04:39] so let me show you that God's thoughts
[2:04:43] are so much higher than our thoughts so
[2:04:48] much higher than our ways because I'm
[2:04:52] got sword I'm planning his world he
[2:04:57] ripped perfection he saw his word let
[2:05:01] there be light and there was light
[2:05:04] and he has never had to make this Sun
[2:05:06] any better since he did it one time it's
[2:05:10] been as perfect as puffer could be if
[2:05:14] man could touch the Sun they would have
[2:05:17] changed it but God made sure you can't
[2:05:19] touch the Sun you just bask under the
[2:05:23] glories of the Sun God spoke let there
[2:05:26] be light and there was light and he's
[2:05:29] never had to walk on it
[2:05:30] his sword I'll read right away a profits
[2:05:36] earned that's been there ever since and
[2:05:39] the Bible says I believe in in Sam
[2:05:41] something he said he said as for God his
[2:05:45] way is perfect
[2:05:49] so when go saw some plants he always
[2:05:52] comes forth on the other side are they
[2:05:54] harvest with perfection is that clear
[2:05:57] do you believe that the source he plans
[2:06:01] it comes out with a prophet fruit
[2:06:05] perfect harvest glory
[2:06:09] Oh glory but us nothing man does is
[2:06:19] perfect the same principle sowing and
[2:06:22] reaping God applies the principle
[2:06:24] becomes a perfect world first day God
[2:06:28] created at the end of the day God saw
[2:06:30] everything he did was good in other
[2:06:32] words was perfect second day God said
[2:06:35] let there be this and let the other
[2:06:37] bring forth and all that and God saw it
[2:06:39] was good in other words was perfect
[2:06:42] because sword and the spoken word is the
[2:06:45] original seat that is sword the sword
[2:06:48] let their animals comfort let me let me
[2:06:51] let the sea bring for you whales and all
[2:06:53] of that and God saw that it was good
[2:06:57] every soil and plant in God did was
[2:07:00] perfect and good so why is I also
[2:07:03] implying not producing the same results
[2:07:07] because we are on a different plane from
[2:07:10] him or rather is on a different plane
[2:07:12] from us say as they have reserved of the
[2:07:14] earth
[2:07:15] so my waist up of your wish I my foot
[2:07:19] above your thoughts Oh God Almighty
[2:07:24] already glory so each time God sort his
[2:07:33] word he said he reflects in every single
[2:07:37] time and we also saw in reap but unlike
[2:07:41] God with already perfection nothing man
[2:07:45] does is perfect amen but like some 18
[2:07:51] and verse 3 says as for God his way is
[2:07:54] perfect but we have never been able to
[2:07:57] come to that yet and welcome to that
[2:07:59] because he is sent a word the maracas
[2:08:02] for certain planning all of that a
[2:08:04] perfect bread will come forth to where
[2:08:07] she will speak under Warwick reserve
[2:08:10] just like that and you will see and see
[2:08:14] that it is good exactly what you spoke
[2:08:16] will come to pass
[2:08:18] Laure widow got a man that's why when
[2:08:21] got a precious gift in a proper whoever
[2:08:24] there's no margin of error
[2:08:26] wanker splits into a profit is exactly
[2:08:29] on the spot if it doesn't happen one
[2:08:32] time it's a problem there and these guys
[2:08:35] are spend all their lives trying to show
[2:08:37] and see where but the Brahma said
[2:08:38] someday or not happen you won't find it
[2:08:40] you can cook stuff up and disappear all
[2:08:44] who are children of disobedience while
[2:08:47] you will not see the bride because the
[2:08:49] bride shall never be deceived a man or a
[2:09:09] god swords and rips
[2:09:12] perfectional the challenge we sow and
[2:09:15] reap and with our perfection it means
[2:09:18] therefore the gosset thoughts also in a
[2:09:19] ribbon with superior to a thoughts on so
[2:09:24] in a ribbon far higher than our thoughts
[2:09:28] on sowing and reaping does that make
[2:09:31] sense to you or hallelujah
[2:09:35] nor will God so God's thoughts are
[2:09:38] totally on a totally more elevated level
[2:09:42] than our thoughts because it's those
[2:09:45] produce a perfect health is those
[2:09:48] produced a perfect camera villain is the
[2:09:51] produced a perfect creation
[2:09:52] it starts produce a perfect man stand on
[2:09:55] the face of the earth
[2:09:56] Amen now we've never been able to do
[2:09:58] that just yet little God now that's the
[2:10:01] difference between your thoughts and
[2:10:03] your thinking let me make that clear
[2:10:04] before I go on
[2:10:07] but as I'm speaking I'm using them
[2:10:10] interchangeably but there's a difference
[2:10:12] very bit differently your thoughts and
[2:10:13] your thinking we obviously I have
[2:10:16] thoughts first in my mind I'll show you
[2:10:19] how those thoughts come but God had
[2:10:22] thoughts on his mind
[2:10:23] how thoughts in mind I was not clear the
[2:10:26] world what was gonna be like first in
[2:10:28] his mind who was gonna be saved who
[2:10:30] wasn't gonna be saved but that wasn't
[2:10:31] his thinking
[2:10:32] thousands thinking the file is a
[2:10:43] powerful thing but the thinking is not
[2:10:45] powerful I wasn't reading scripture I
[2:10:49] think I forgot let this mind be in you I
[2:10:52] believe it's Philippians the second
[2:10:56] chapter verses 5 to 11 you can read when
[2:10:59] you get home asked if it was on my
[2:11:01] context and one of my scriptures let
[2:11:03] this mind be in you which was also in
[2:11:07] Christ Jesus who thought it not robbery
[2:11:11] to be equal with God that's a very
[2:11:16] perplexing scripture but I'll show you
[2:11:18] the scriptures speaking about nothing
[2:11:20] about the three for mystery of God
[2:11:22] because it's only by the three for
[2:11:24] mystery of God that you're gonna see
[2:11:25] like that it's not robbery to be equal
[2:11:27] with God because God did tell me before
[2:11:30] the nation of the world God in Christ
[2:11:31] Christ in the bride going back to Eden a
[2:11:34] perfect man on the face of the earth I'm
[2:11:36] mature God's on the face of the earth
[2:11:38] so that was the three for missions was
[2:11:41] misspoken out there Jesus Christ
[2:11:43] sorry no robbery to be equal with God he
[2:11:49] needs something I just go and take it
[2:11:51] something that your labor and fight for
[2:11:55] it's not a gift it's something you labor
[2:11:58] and fight for but it's already given to
[2:12:01] you you might oh my lord so your
[2:12:05] thoughts all kinds of first come in your
[2:12:07] mind you can say I have thoughts I have
[2:12:09] bad thoughts that's the devil's job to
[2:12:11] put bad sauce in your mind
[2:12:13] but if you don't understand that's what
[2:12:15] you're thinking the devil will fool you
[2:12:17] because that is not your thinking amen
[2:12:20] another scripture says Amen I believe
[2:12:24] there is a Philippians 4 and verse 8 say
[2:12:30] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[2:12:33] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[2:12:35] honest whatsoever things of a good
[2:12:37] report in other words there are
[2:12:39] different thoughts pure thoughts

[2:20:54] [Music]
[2:21:06] so welcome to the Lord the Scriptures
[2:21:09] and join us to let this mind be in you
[2:21:12] which was also any question who would
[2:21:14] fight now robbery to be equal with gonna
[2:21:17] like I said that's speaking right there
[2:21:18] of a 3/4 ministry of God that was the
[2:21:22] only revelation that will make Jesus
[2:21:24] Christ then nothing is robbery to be
[2:21:26] equal with God he knew the process you
[2:21:28] don't just break in and get the
[2:21:30] character of the Son of God he knows the
[2:21:32] process the steps the procedure I know
[2:21:35] that God by spearonation Amen shows with
[2:21:37] him before the formation of the world
[2:21:38] and he knows the priesthood not to be
[2:21:41] equal with God when his wasn't robbery
[2:21:43] he was president miracle with God but I
[2:21:45] know he's not robbery there's a process
[2:21:47] that the step in successive steps now to
[2:21:49] get there and jesus knew that so that's
[2:21:51] speaking about the fee for ministry and
[2:21:53] when we become a Christian I said when
[2:21:55] come in this message here we enjoined to
[2:21:57] get rid of our thoughts and begin to
[2:22:01] think his thoughts because we're going
[2:22:03] back to Eden amen
[2:22:06] we've got to go back first to the
[2:22:08] thoughts and the thinking that produce
[2:22:10] Eden in the first place or we'll never
[2:22:12] go about there that's what won't you
[2:22:15] everybody else talking the my vision is
[2:22:19] always a very popular topic um offer any
[2:22:20] courses mentioned songs I've gone I'm
[2:22:22] supposed to go like but the fuel pellets
[2:22:23] and they can have like tempura already
[2:22:25] power but permanent power stays with you
[2:22:27] the only caused by the same thinking the
[2:22:30] produce it in the first instance but the
[2:22:32] perm said if you split the world by the
[2:22:35] same thinking that produce the world in
[2:22:38] the first place you will get the same
[2:22:41] resource and this process here is about
[2:22:45] God walked in on the inside of us to get
[2:22:48] us to move our thinking to a totally
[2:22:51] different level by his preeminence is in
[2:22:54] our souls in our hearts in our lives the
[2:22:57] water God living in you and I in
[2:22:58] preeminence Oh
[2:23:01] hallelujah hallelujah oh mama amen lorry
[2:23:14] let this mind be in you which was also
[2:23:17] in Christ Jesus whatsoever things appear
[2:23:20] think of these things because the man
[2:23:24] thinketh in his heart so he adds and
[2:23:27] leaves so is he your thoughts your
[2:23:32] thinking that's your inner man that's
[2:23:36] your spirit man on the inside of you
[2:23:38] that's a spiritual heart on the instead
[2:23:40] of you I don't which flow all of your
[2:23:42] life all the issues of the life come
[2:23:45] from that thinking in that spirit man on
[2:23:48] the instead of you Oh unfortunately too
[2:23:53] many of us funny very difficult to
[2:23:57] elevate our thinking to God's level of
[2:24:00] thinking does never love thinking for
[2:24:03] you your circumstances your life your
[2:24:06] job your Christian walk your family your
[2:24:09] career your job for every area of your
[2:24:13] life we find it so difficult to elevate
[2:24:17] our thinking to the level that goes is
[2:24:21] my thoughts are higher than your
[2:24:23] thoughts
[2:24:23] I'm always higher than your ways and
[2:24:26] when you come up to his level of
[2:24:27] thinking you will see the way how he
[2:24:29] achieves that thinking to make it coming
[2:24:32] to a manifestation but why are you
[2:24:34] staying your level of thinking you'll be
[2:24:36] struggling against the booze and trying
[2:24:39] to make those thoughts come to pass
[2:24:41] I'm a Christian and you are struggling
[2:24:44] there's no struggling Christian if you
[2:24:46] are struggling as a Christian some is
[2:24:47] not right young man hear me young woman
[2:24:50] hear me if you are struggling as a
[2:24:51] Christian something is not right the
[2:24:55] only way a Christian struggles you
[2:24:57] struggle in prayer with God to get on
[2:25:00] your knees baggy at the knees during
[2:25:02] labor in solo travail with God but a
[2:25:06] Christian don't struggle to not sin
[2:25:09] Laura door goddamn man can I get a
[2:25:12] witness back I can't hear you a
[2:25:14] Christian don't struggle to not sin
[2:25:17] because the speed of God this speeder
[2:25:20] cut off a came the devil how are you
[2:25:22] going to struggle against the devil
[2:25:24] anymore
[2:25:26] the daily struggle against Goliath
[2:25:29] Israel struggle but not David they will
[2:25:33] run into the army
[2:25:34] grunting aloud with confidence that's a
[2:25:37] fast shadow of a Christian hallelujah
[2:25:39] there's a challenge we don't deny that a
[2:25:42] challenge there but we'll face it an
[2:25:44] elevated level of thinking a good level
[2:25:47] of thinking and we said to every
[2:25:49] challenge this Egyptians your city there
[2:25:52] you shall see them no more forever you
[2:25:59] say like David you come against me the
[2:26:02] name of your gods but I come against you
[2:26:05] in the name of the lord god of the
[2:26:07] heavens and earth whom you have defied
[2:26:09] don't you understand
[2:26:12] you may be seated don't you understand
[2:26:17] you may be seated
[2:26:21] [Applause]
[2:26:30] don't you understand that every
[2:26:32] challenge that comes at you to make the
[2:26:36] Word of God looks like it's a lie don't
[2:26:38] you understand that that challenge is to
[2:26:41] find the god of the heavens and the
[2:26:43] earth and David without the Holy Ghost
[2:26:48] he said I will not stand for it I will
[2:26:52] not let you to find my god or defy his
[2:26:56] armies and David went to face Goliath
[2:27:01] every challenge I was like a Goliath you
[2:27:04] face it at an elevated level of thinking
[2:27:07] we are not going to print like Israel
[2:27:09] we're going to face it and we're gonna
[2:27:11] profess how's it going you'll fall at my
[2:27:13] feet
[2:27:14] those are not man's words as my thoughts
[2:27:17] are higher than the earth so are my
[2:27:20] thoughts on my ways higher than your
[2:27:22] ways
[2:27:23] [Applause]
[2:27:35] proceeded israel and saw their thoughts
[2:27:41] where grasshoppers before Goliath to
[2:27:45] forego lieth you need years of
[2:27:47] experience that's the way to to bring
[2:27:49] this victory the comparison is years of
[2:27:51] experience you need this ammo that you
[2:27:54] wear the ammo you are called by
[2:27:58] everywhere that's man's thoughts and his
[2:28:01] ways to achieve what he thought what
[2:28:05] needs to be achieved but come to a man
[2:28:08] who has reached that level the elevated
[2:28:12] level of thinking thinking differently
[2:28:15] than the rest of the group who care
[2:28:17] nothing about being popular with the
[2:28:19] rest of the group
[2:28:20] mi wash can alone if you have to stand
[2:28:23] alone stand alone hallelujah and David
[2:28:30] came he began to speak like no no other
[2:28:34] manner ever spoken baby said your
[2:28:39] servant so I am your seven but is on
[2:28:44] second self listen I will go and fight
[2:28:46] him I will kill him today so cringe
[2:28:51] don't talk like that young man don't

[2:28:54] don't talk like that he's a man of war
[2:28:57] from his youth oh not just a small boy
[2:28:59] because he was living at this level here
[2:29:01] I wanted to keep David at that level of
[2:29:03] thinking don't let them do it to you
[2:29:05] don't let no challenge no circumstance
[2:29:09] nothing keep you have a level of
[2:29:11] thinking you a needle flop your eagle
[2:29:15] wings and soar into the heavens you are
[2:29:18] not kicking you wanna add one creature
[2:29:20] flying to the skies where thoughts are
[2:29:24] high

[2:29:28] man's ways hallelujah
[2:29:30] [Applause]
[2:29:44] there is bogus votes and it showed us
[2:29:50] ways of confronting the challenge my
[2:29:56] thoughts are not your thoughts my ways
[2:29:59] are not your ways my thoughts are we
[2:30:03] higher on a different level I think
[2:30:05] different than you think are my ways are
[2:30:08] different than the way you would do it
[2:30:10] my way me look stupid but they are so
[2:30:14] different for me always you will never
