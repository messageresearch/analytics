[42:33] unreasoning - of the prophetic word a
[42:37] spoken word is yours not see he said now
[42:39] watch this word of god is eternal he
[42:44] said on God being infinite he cannot
[42:45] speak one thing and then later on change
[42:48] it to something else - some better
[42:50] decision no see because why because
[42:53] every decision of God is perfect every
[42:57] decision is perfect so when he chose you
[43:00] it was a perfect decision when he chose
[43:04] your soul from the beginning hallelujah
[43:06] hallelujah hallelujah make a mistake he
[43:09] knew you'd fall he knew you'll hardly
[43:11] have your trials or struggles but he

[43:15] you tonight and he made a way that you
[43:18] will come to perfection that you would
[43:20] come to your season that you would be
[43:22] saved he knew you would make the right
[43:24] choice amen he cannot once his word is
[43:32] spoken it could never die it lives on
[43:35] and on and on the prophecy and it cannot
[43:38] can never die because it is God and His
[43:43] Word car no more die than he can die and
[43:46] if he can't die his food candy
[43:48] hey man that's it see so that's the
[43:50] reason we read and push John or Saint
[43:52] John or first chapter that in the
[43:55] beginning was a word and the Word was
[43:57] with God and the Word was God
[44:00] that's right you may and the wood was
[44:02] made flesh and the same God that was
[44:04] spoken in the beginning with his eternal
[44:06] purpose came on over and was made flesh
[44:09] and dwelt among sea man he changed his
[44:12] form a man from thought to flesh Eman
[44:16] became God's Word manifests a man now we
[44:19] could handle him he said here my hands
[44:21] here my feet here's my side touch me it
[44:24] is I Jesus be not afraid
[44:26] hallelujah be not dismayed he breathed
[44:29] upon them receive the Holy Ghost shall
[44:32] surely come to pass on upon you
[44:35] hallelujah oh you're gonna receive power
[44:37] from on high
[44:38] yeah many men glory is now right it was
[44:41] God's wood okay prophet said some years
[44:44] ago he said that a woman he said no this
[44:47] may not be authentic he said he said but
[44:49] he said that licked her tongue in Radium
[44:50] he said while mixing it to put on hands
[44:54] of dials of clocks and watches and stuff
[44:56] you say apparently it killed a woman but
[44:59] years later it when when they kept her
[45:02] skull for an autopsy
[45:04] and like they said they said you could
[45:06] take instruments he said whatever they
[45:08] use he said but they put it against that
[45:10] skull Boone and with a rumble he said
[45:14] you could still hear the radium going on
[45:16] in a skull and he said now after she'd
[45:19] been there yes he said but a radium
[45:22] continually goes on it's not right he
[45:25] said the interaction she had with you
[45:28] would be with
[45:28] it would really do the uridium amen
[45:31] it still went on him after she launched
[45:33] after she died he said in the word is
[45:36] the same way he said the word of God
[45:38] continually goes on a man a man
[45:40] continues on hallelujah amen regardless
[45:43] of what's teaching the word goes on he
[45:46] said now I'm told he said now I'm told
[45:48] that if we could pick up an instrument
[45:49] that could catch it he said talking
[45:52] about our man's voice she said when you
[45:54] speak he said I'm told you could get an
[45:57] instrument pick up an instrument I could
[45:59] catch it he said my voice that I speak
[46:01] today is now right and he's talking back
[46:04] in 1962 and he said my voice that I
[46:06] speak today he said ten thousand years
[46:08] from now he said you could still pick
[46:11] that up in the air he said it's like
[46:14] dropping a petal in the middle of a pond
[46:17] he said under teeny little waves after
[46:20] they failed to be seen by the eye he
[46:23] said they continued on until it hits the
[46:26] bank and the airwaves of our voice
[46:28] continually travels around around the
[46:30] world
[46:31] I said therefore then our voice he said
[46:33] then what we see he say will be our
[46:36] judgment oh so this very ties in any
[46:39] alarm is that we get to see now we're
[46:40] gone hallelujah
[46:42] can actually play back the tape of our
[46:43] lives because we think that it hasn't
[46:46] that always have stopped here but it
[46:48] will stop here it continues on somewhere
[46:50] else and God's instruments while at the
[46:53] end of the judgement picks up every word
[46:56] we've spoken in our natural lines and
[46:59] place it back for us in the judgment
[47:01] holiday that's all that's why it's so
[47:03] important what you say what are we
[47:07] talking about tonight if you shall say a
[47:09] man early on death and life lies in the
[47:12] power of the tongue is that right listen
[47:14] so let's listen to what he said you know
[47:16] he said now the airwaves continue on our
[47:19] voice continually travels around around
[47:21] the world is that an N or voice what we
[47:23] see will be our judgement or testimony
[47:26] will rise against us our own voices will
[47:29] echo in our own ears at the judgment bar
[47:33] of God a man or when it's great
[47:35] instrument catches every voice that's
[47:37] been spoke every word that's been
[47:38] muttered he many men that's why it's so
[47:41] careful
[47:41] man to see the right thing it's not
[47:44] right well it's not right me to think
[47:47] about that story with Jesus when that
[47:49] woman come before him and worship and
[47:50] was giving glory and say our daughter
[47:52] was vexed with the devil it's not right
[47:54] and she's a tuna and tolay he said woman
[47:56] is not fit to take the children's bread
[47:59] and cast it to dogs
[48:01] isn't that right but that woman stood
[48:02] her ground she stood right there because
[48:05] she had a need and she didn't let what
[48:08] he said disturb her spirit oh and she
[48:11] said Lord he's made this if it's sold
[48:13] and that's fine I'm ok with that but
[48:16] even the dogs could get the crumbs from
[48:18] ulta master's table and jesus said
[48:20] before this scene delivered it may you
[48:26] could see the right thing tonight or on
[48:28] an access the power of God your words
[48:32] could change the course of events your
[48:36] words could change what's happening here
[48:38] tonight well if you launch out and feed
[48:40] Lord John and believe something that
[48:43] you've never believed before only the
[48:44] quad is able to deliver God is able to
[48:47] restore rise up and claim it speak it
[48:49] sick pod is evil hallelujah I believe
[48:52] the word that's written in this book I
[48:53] believe the word that's written in this
[48:55] fiber oh god I'm coming off off coming

[49:10] hallelujah hallelujah a man your voice
[49:12] could change the course of the events no
[49:15] I was like marry a man and Lazarus was
[49:19] dead for days Jesus come back he said I
[49:21] could wake him he was there waiting
[49:23] there in a week and so on and they came
[49:26] to him said lord if you had been here my
[49:28] brother would not have done hallelujah
[49:30] but even sue holler even now longer you
[49:34] are able to do something you hallelujah
[49:36] you can restore right there with those
[49:38] words she changed the course of events
[49:40] she threw him into a case that I am the
[49:42] resurrection and the life hallelujah
[49:45] glory to God amen amen have somebody
[49:47] began to turn why because she said
[49:49] something hallelujah
[49:51] that stirred his faith she said
[49:53] something that registered in heaven but
[49:55] words didn't just affect what was
[49:57] happening unnatural her words went up up

[50:38] it's God's faith in you tonight Oh
[50:40] glory glory email a little more I'm
[50:43] finished Eman he said no he said no
[50:45] therefore voice he said what we see
[50:47] would be your judgment or testimony or
[50:49] rise against us or own voices will echo
[50:51] in our own ears Wow
[50:53] something huh a judgment bar of corn
[50:56] amen and when it's great instrument
[50:58] catches every voice has been spoke every
[51:01] word has been muttered and now he said
[51:03] there's only one way to stop that voice
[51:05] that's wrong he said and he said that's
[51:08] to repent
[51:09] amen amen hallelujah it's only one way
[51:12] to stop that voice those idle words that
[51:15] you spoke and those things that you said
[51:17] in your anger and in your jealousy or in
[51:19] your hatred there's only one way to stop
[51:21] that voice that's the blood of Jesus
[51:23] Christ when you repent
[51:25] hallelujah I say Lord I turn around I
[51:28] turn my mind around I turn my heart
[51:30] around I want to follow after you honey
[51:32] I repent in dust and ashes then God the
[51:35] blood goes after that voice and stops it
[51:38] from meeting you other judgments hollow
