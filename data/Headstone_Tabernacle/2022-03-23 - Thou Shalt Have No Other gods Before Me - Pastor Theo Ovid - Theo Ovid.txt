lord and speak to us tonight and jesus may ask it amen and amen god bless you and thanks for coming tonight uh what a blessing to be hearing from the lord sunday service amen praise god and unchanging god a changing world are changing people thank you brother isaac tonight we want to return to three portions of scriptures mark 7 1-9 exodus 20 2-7 first kings 11 21-37 mark seven we want to read one to nine we thank you for being here dudes connected to us live god bless you we appreciate amen that you want to hear and receive the word reading mark 7 1 then came together unto him the pharisee and satan of the scribes which came from jerusalem and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defile that is the same with unwashing hands they found forth for the pharisees and all the jews except they wash their hands oft eat not holding the tradition of the elders and when they come from the market except they wash they eat not and many other things there be which they have received to hold as the washing of cups and pots and braising vessels and of tables then the pharisees and scribe ask him why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread but unwashing hands he answered and said unto them well are they prophesied of you hypocrites how this is written these people honor it me with their lips but their heart is far from me how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men for laying aside the commandment of god he hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such things that you do and he said unto them full well ye reject the commandment of god hear why that he may keep your own tradition exodus 20 reading from verse 2 i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt and out of the house of bondage thou shalt have no other gods before me thou shalt not make unto thee any grieving image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that isn't it beneath or that is in the water under the earth thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god i'm a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain first kings chapter 11 we want to read from verse 31 to 37. then he said to jeroboam take the ten pieces of thus ten pieces for thus saith the lord the god of israel behold i will rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon and will give ten tribes to thee but he shall have one tribe for my servants david seek and for jerusalem's sake the city which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel because that they have forseeked me and have worshipped astareth the goddess of the siddhurians kemosh the god of the moabites milkon the god of the chain of ammon and have not walked in my weeds to do that which is right in my eyes and to keep my statutes and my judgments at the as the david his father how be it i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but i will make him prince all the days of his life for david my seven sake whom i choose because he kept my commandments and my statutes but i will take the kingdom out of his son's hand and will give it unto thee even ten tribes unto his son will i give one tribe that david my servant may have a light always before me in jerusalem the city which i have chosen me to put my name there and i will take thee and thou shall reign according to all that i so desired and shall be king over israel may god bless this word you may be seated o blessed be the name of the lord so tonight i i suspect it's going to be like a part bible study but we will see what the law will do in it the title i have tonight is from the scripture we read in exodus uh 20 the title is thou shalt have no other gods before me that's the title though shall have no other gods before me okay let's go saint john four the woman of the world was renting our fathers worship in the mountain and he say that jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father ye worship you know not what but we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father secret such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth this is the god that said i am the lord beside him there is none else have no other gods before me all glory to god and lucifer wanted that worship that god deserves he wanted it now revelation 18 13 8 says and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so this whole beast system is connected with worship that's the objective in all all the powers and all the weapons and what that is connected to worship oh hallelujah it went on further he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed and he calls it all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive the mark in their right hand or in their foreheads that no man might buy or sell see if he'd have the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name so the b system itself is connected to worship that is why they're going to have the mark that is why they're going to kill and the prophet said in the dark ages there or forget the pope what was who legalized murder that is okay to kill people that don't believe what you believe hallelujah and they was getting authorization from the church and that same thing going to happen again slaughter them kill them in the name of god oh blessed be the name of the lord do you believe that tonight under the angel of the church of tight i write these things said the son of god who had his eyes like flame of fire his feet as a fine brass this is the same jesus coming forth in judgment eyes of fire flames like a brass isn't that right listen to this i have been he said i have been bringing to your attention all along that i will kill a children with death and all the churches shall know i am he which searched the rings and the hearts i have been saying right along there are actually two churches though the spirit speaks to both of them in each age as though they are a one here it is plainly stated that they are churches and it states just plainly that some of those churches most evidently do not know that he is the one that suited the reigns and the hearts he is going to prove to them that it is so now then what churches will be those that do not know this truth of course it is the fourth vine group because the true believers certainly know that judgment begins at the house of god and there being god-fearing judge themselves that they may not be judged so when you are true believer you can look into the mirror of the word and judge yourself oh glory to god because judgment begins where in the house of god now why does god call these churches his churches even though they are the false vine the truth of the matter is that they are christians and they are not christians of the spirit they are christians of the flesh they bear the name in vain and he quotes mark 7. how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men so now we find out tonight they are christians of the flesh and they are christians of the spirit and god recognizes both he addresses both the word goes out about and both of them will respond to the word a certain way oh glory to god do you believe that now he said watch in the same way a christian is a christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that jesus is the son of god born of the virgin crucified and died and rose again etc and that is how god sees them now why do we say this because as we pointed out in the study of the fourth age that was jezebel was a sidonian the daughter of ethbal who was the king priest astati he was a murderer this woman married ahab king of israel for political expediency she then took over the religion of the people murdered the levites erected temples wherein he she caused the people to worship astati venus bial sun god she formulated the teaching made a priest teach it and then in turn made the people accept it there you can see exactly what the nominal church was in the dark ages they left the word of god entirely except for names and titles of godhead a few scriptural principles they twisted what they did take out the bible by changing its meaning the college of bishops wrote vast treaties their popes declared themselves to be infallible and they received revelation from god and spoke as god to the people all this was taught to the priests who true fear made the people believe it the dissent was debt or excommunication which might be worse than that it was now the church with the assured voice that took over and while with power they drank the blood of the matters until the true christians were all but exterminated but there was hardly any word left and little manifestation of the holy ghost but the true vine struggled and survived the divine watch struggled and survived god was faithful to little flock in spite of what rome might do to their bodies rome could not kill the spirit within them and the light of the truth shone on backed by the holy ghost and power this is a good place to make an illuminating observation look the deeds and doctrines of the nicolaitans the doctrine of balaam and the teaching of the false prophetess jezebel do not constitute three spirits or make three spiritual principles these three are about the various manifestation of the same spirit as it go from depth to depth what it is all is the antichrist spirit of organization in three stages once here we go the clergy is separated themselves which is the ministers and organized themselves they oppressed the people by leading them into and binding them to organization also this organization was based upon creeds and dogmas which they taught instead of the pure word of god oh so you have pure word yes what is pure word thus saith the lord what is pure word what comes out the prophet's mouth because man shall never bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of god so every word that comes at the mouth of the prophets are pure with it's thus saith the lord there is no variable necessary with it there is no change in it it's god speaking to the mouth of these men isn't that right so watch this ritual and ceremony was given an increase in pattern worship and so this whole system was a militant and diabolical power that did its best to control all to the persuasion of discourse or literal force it received its energy from its own false prophecies the false prophecies anointed them so they could believe a lie oh hallelujah not the word of god it was up it was no absolutely antichrist though it came in christ's name what is it idolatry idolatry what is idolatry and the definition of having a dictionary the worship of a physical object as a god that's one to a moderate attachment or devotion to something extreme admiration love or reverence for something or someone so when we first hear about idols the impression we get is some physical statute that's external things a statue or some created image that god said or make is something external that could be identified as an idol but what about the internal ones the internal images the internal statutes because this bees have an image that will get a life because idols and whatnot is all that is forms of worship because they call it a god and all the god won't worship all the gods need worship oh blessed be the name of the lord so watch this brother brown as you can see by reading of the scripture where i am placing my thought this morning upon idolatry first to begin with there's little wrote about idolatry there's not many books to explain idolatry what is idolatry and yet the world is full of it i think the reason of it is because it has never really been explained to people not knowing what it would be and it's been my privilege and my great privilege in my life in traveling to see some idolatry to know what it is then in studying idolatry the last few weeks mythology greek mythology roman mythology it brings me back to see whether they still keep the same thing alive to see whether if idolatry remains as it was in the beginning today in travel seeing idolatry and then seeing the way it began reading how it began back in the early days i see that it hasn't changed oh hallelujah because anything that please come between you and your god is an eye dog anything be it wife husband money house family job whatever it is once it come because see what it does it it competes with attention from your heart that's supposed to be going towards god oh glory to god because he that what and the father secret who to worship him worshiping and what in spirit and in truth and the only way you can worship and truth you have to get the idols out of your heart oh give the lord some praises people let's continue here notice air married jezebel junior time of the great dark age of israel he brought idolatry into israel a very type of today just in the dark age when we come out to the early apostles he says fifteen hundred years as he had married jezebel and brought idolatry into israel so did the holy ghost church marry into isms and brought idolatry back and today it's a form well when i read this this blew my mind it's a form of christianity just very dark so this idolatry is a dark form of christianity hallelujah but i hope god help us this evening i don't know how things will unfold the way i'm seeing it and it's it's scary let's continue to the great climax to the lukewarm church comes like lukewarm laurisia what a horrible age we are living in just as israel come in its beauty back in the beginning of abraham come down to the patriarchs and in the day of ahab it went into the dark ages the darkest age of church scene went out there and at a time of year married jezebel brought idolatry into the orthodox church the same thing protestantism married romanism in the fifteen hundred years of the actions in the pergamos church and they come up with idolatry under the form of christianity going out into the lukewarm age coming before us so idolatry bring on that lukewarm because idolatry take away your love and worship to the true unliving god and give it to other gods small god oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah praise god you you yourself could be an idol you could actually be a lover of your own self oh glory to god you yourself become an idol you become a god in your own eyes a god in your own thinking according your own approach oh blessed be the name of the lord knowing that church is they became coming they went into idolatry and watched and he said we are fading away until we get down to the last age now the modern church which we call denomination holiness people we call them the modern he said they're not getting anywhere now wait a minute what have we got we got nothing no more than they got that's exactly right as long as we fuss and skew and carry on among one another we still work as men until a man can get down at the altar and get right with god till he can overlook little things and move on like a christian or two until he can overlook what little things little things binding you and turn you up you have to overlook that overlook your better fault overlook your brother's failure overlook this one mistake and what happened forget it the grace of god is for all of us the blood is for all of us and all of us have to deal with the b system that is already on its way oh give the lord some praises glory to god until a man can get right down at the altar and get right with god till he can overlook little things and move on like a christian author but can't get called kettle black don't holla at them let's clean our own step first and i say the same thing don't bother but nobody else mind your own business let's clean our own step first oh give the lord some praises glory to god hallelujah praise god so this whole idolatry thing started off with nimrod the son of ham to idolatry to bring idols to worship idols now who's behind that idol worship satan who's the who's behind everything to get you to cut you from god satan be it movies be it whatever it is money whatever it is it's satan trying to shift your view shift your heart away from god and as you shift you get lukewarm you get cold you see what god did to solomon god said go rent the kingdom from him i'll just leave one thing with him because of david why because he worshipped this god he's going after this god god hates that idolatry spirit he said i am the lord have no other god before me oh glory to god i am a jealous god because idolatry means that you're being unfaithful you say you marry to him you say you love him you say amen that's your husband but you're really serving somebody else i am the lord have no other gods before me or give the lord some praises tonight praise god to put no manners no god no man be pulpit behind your butt god don't idolize no man or give the lord some praises but many times they idolize pastors idolize this one idolize that one oh glory to god and then take the place of god oh hallelujah when john praise god was getting all these revelations from the angel he said he fell along to worship and that angel said don't worship me worship god i am one of thy fellow servants the prophets worship god and i say it tonight there's gonna have some true worship in the last days oh glory to god the oil they're gonna have the wine they're gonna have the stimulation of revelation and they're gonna have the holy spirit too and they're gonna literally worship the true unliving god oh hallelujah the devil have no power over the blood washed ones oh glory to god the devil have no power over the blood washed once and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony we will not bow down to any image even the peace image we will not bow down there's another image that we come to call oh glory to god is the perfect man that's jesus christ the same yesterday didn't there ever be unchanging god oh give the lord a shout i am god and i change not have no other guts before me oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah go put your wife before god don't put your husband before god don't put your children before god don't forget your work before god you could lose your job you could lose your wife you could lose your husband you could lose your children god have to come back first first in the church first in praise first and worship whatever you do he comes first have no other gods before me glory to god hallelujah hallelujah remember remember remember the definition of the lottery extreme admiration love or reverence for something or someone the holy spirit separates us from the things of the world from the cares of this world and our whole affections is set on christ jesus whole affection why should he deserve less he's the one giving you a breath that you breathe he's the one giving you your health he's the one blessing with job he's the one kept here all these years and you're jinxing on him hallelujah on your and you're sidetracking him and he written days i'm a jealous god oh glory to god i created you i put you on the earth i bless you and look how you're treating me oh hallelujah praise god that's why he's a jealous god he will visit the sins of the fathers upon the first and fourth and unto the fourth generation oh glory to god is not brother to you you're saying that this is god saying that hallelujah i am god and i changed not he can't change for anybody he deserves our worship he deserves our praise when the lamb took the book john said all in heaven all under the earth heard i praise god saying blessing another might and power don't mean and unto the lamb forever for what would you take the book until lucis seems thereof millions were lost when you were saved praise god how can you be a stale dead christian all caught up in loudly say a quarterback kind of foolishness you can't put movie before god in your movie hollywood is your god oh glory to god you put money in front money is your god you put your business in front business is your god that's your idol hallelujah whatever whatever hole in your heart because what idolatry really is is things really conquering you is you really coming into captivity because your heart not on god your heart and other things and jesus when they talk about washing putts and asking jesus the question how come he disciples to wash hands and watch hands he said you're exhausted all you hypocrites he said would you mount your enemy but your heart is far from me but he's the god that search not your mouth he searched the reins of the heart what is your intent what is your desire not how much books you read because your god could be knowledge and your god could be information when this hit me so i shot off the news and all right we imagine what's going on outside and the place comes silent because they have a country continuously you know when you hear this you'll hear this you hear it and they pull it is it do you have a real name that was social media come all these gods you know all of these idols you know don't talk about the cell phone oh man watching that as if that is god almighty and you know when that ring is like go talking you know idolatry facebook become an idol that's right social media become an idol wheeling in one story one kicks one this one that and they're pulling you and pulling in caught up in that are you not caught up in the things of god i sign up putin you clean all them sign them off send out everything because i don't want no other gods i i connect with this and i checking every idol in my heart and my spirit in my mind and i i will get it you know he said burn them throw down the altars mash them up don't play with them you know oh destroy them glory to god he said when we go get the descriptions when he gets in that land he said those tried he said your daughter's married and people you know because he will lead them astray from god don't tell your sons take them wise or no because they could take them away from god oh glory to god i call it to be a peculiar people his object is to bring you to him and the devil object is to take you away from him and anything that taking you away from him is the next idol oh glory to god i am the lord thy god have no other gods before me mine here was a borderline believer just a fellow that believed enough to make him miserable did you ever see people like that they have a conception that they should like to go to church and do right they feel like it will make them better social persons who share lives and maybe for the sake of their children they think they ought to maybe belong to a church if that isn't the most miserable person i know of i tell you it's better cut loose all the lines and launch into the deep or don't at all go just simply stay home either you go all over christ god wants somebody who is really want to go all the way give your soul your body your spirit to the service of the lord and this borderline believer as i call him a few moments ago he kindly had a mental conception of his theology he thought well there's god but maybe big lamb is god too like people are saying you know jesus is the way but he's not the only we here i mean he must have other ways that's only logical donkey logic is very logical but god do you say i am the way not a way he didn't say a wee so any any any any smoothie style some style balling he's one of the ways they are liars a satan talking through them he said i am the way and he means that hallelujah i am the way i am the truth i am the door i am the life and we have to believe it that way and when you believe that way you get the power of the revelation of what he said that he is oh glory to god i am that i am whatever you need me tonight to be that is what i am i could be your deliverer tonight your baptizer tonight your healer tonight whatever you need me that is what i am to you tonight how do you want me to be tonight oh give the lord some praises oh glory to god hallelujah praise god you say you know boys i'm telling you tonight you young ladies be careful who you marry you'll have a broken home the first thing you know is it's not good for sinners and christians to marry together don't be unequally yoked cause that's what ahab she was pretty little paint over her face i like a lizard but he marries shay no watch the most wicked person there is a man or woman that professes christianity just got enough to make them sick to make them say i'd like to do that but my religion won't let me do it the most miserables i think of he said but ahab had knuckled down to this idolater wife brought all israel into idolatry you say then brother branham you compared it today to our nation yes our nation is greatly covered over with either the tree we might not lose dealing with it and get known he said we might not worship wooden animals and so forth as we want to think of idolatry but that's not all idolatry consists of we sometimes make our automobiles so long he's drilling down now our clothes and the things that we do we put as idols then he said this anything between you and god is an idol if you put the church between you and god that's an idol if you put a pass in it that's an idol if you worship the cherubim i don't do this there are films if you say gonna worship you 24 elders like the idol too it's worship but who are worshiping they're not god anything between human god is an idol sometimes we make our churches idols so i i didn't say that the prophet said that sometimes they make the churches the idol they may start in the living god you know they started in the church so that's why the pharisees and sadducees had the people in a bang and jesus was rocking the whole system because he was not dealing with the tradition of the elders because for them to get the traditions they have to leave the word that they forsake the commandment to get to do their own thing you cannot believe the devil's lie unless you reject god's truth oh give the lord some praises people let me say that again you cannot receive the devil's lie until you reject god's truth oh glory to god when you reject god to then they could take the devil's life but tonight give him back glory lord god says satan you are liar every time you open your mouth i believe what god said i will have no other gods before between him and me oh glory to god hallelujah praise god hallelujah deuteronomy 7 verse 1 when this is god speaking when the lord thy god shall bring thee into the land whether thou goes to possess it and has cast out many nations before thee the hittites the glitchites the amorites the canaanites the parasites the hivites the jebusites seven nations greater and mighty than thou and when the lord thy god shall deliver them before thee thou shalt smite them utterly destroy them thou shalt make no covenant with them nor show mercy unto them neither shall thou make marriages with them thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son for they will turn away thy son from following me you know who he is he said i am a jealous god he said don't do that from following me that they may serve other gods so will the anger of the lord be killed against you and destroy this suddenly but thus shall you deal with them you want to know how you shall destroy the altars break down their images cut down their groves and burn their grieving images with fire and tonight whatever idol is in your heart in your life whatever image you have to destroy it you have to break it down you have to burn it you're not going to leave you're with it oh glory to god hallelujah give the lord a shout my god is in the word tonight hallelujah for dawah the holy people unto the lord thy god the lord thy god had chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth the lord did not set his love upon you nor chose you because you were more in number than any people but ye were the fewest of all people but because the lord lord love you because he would keep the oath which he swore unto your fathers had the lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeem you out of the house of bond men from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt no therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god oh god that helped me tonight hallelujah he call himself the faithful god he will keep his word to you he will keep his covenant with you i will never leave you to forsake you but i'll be with you within you oh glory to god no you therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations and repeat them that hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slack to him that hated him he will repay him to his face though shall therefore keep the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which i command me this day to do them wherefore it shall come to pass if you hack into these judgments and keep and do them that the lord thy god will keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sway unto thy fathers he will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee he also will bless the fruit of thy womb the fruit of thy land thy corn thy wine thine oil the increase of thy kind the flux of thy sheep in the land which you swear unto thy fathers to give thee oh god i feel good tonight hallelujah shall be blessed above all people there shall not be male nor fear burn among you among your cattle and the lord will take away from the old sickness i will put none of the evil diseases of egypt which don't know is upon thee but will lay upon them all that hate thee but those shall consume all the people which the lord thy god shall deliver thee thine eyes shall have no pity upon them neither shall thou serve their gods but they shall be or for they shall be asleep unto thee oh my hallelujah a lot of stuff have become snails the christians matthew 6 24 jesus speaks no man can save two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he would hold to one and despise the other you cannot serve god and maman the amplified says no one can save two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other he will stand by and be devoted to one and despise and be against the other you cannot save god and mama deceitful riches money possessions or whatever is trusted in oh my gosh the bible talked about a married woman can't get remarried until she was husband died isn't that right and he was talking about this the bible really said here her first husband must be dead not just put away not just divorced but dead and he was bringing a point here he said now to be married to the second adam christ the word you must separate yourself by death from your first denominational husband because there isn't one of them that can take all the word just show me where that is so he's making a point you can't be married to christ and had the old husband you might have two men you know your loved one that can't want her to die the old man are not hearing you the old man after die you have to put and see that have to

your heart and win you away from god oh glory that he told jesus all these kingdoms i will give you hallelujah if thou would bow down and worship oh glory to god he's still lusting for worship he

of god and save a man made a denomination at the same time oh glory to god hallelujah that's why he's always troubling when men have more influence over the people than the word of god oh harlow very very troubling have to be the word praise god as well when samuel come and they say something you come come as all peacefully that time samuel commented go anytime you see a prophet coming he's troubling them prophet is coming bringing with that comfort you know you're coming to bring dusty as the lord they come as all peaceably he can you come to bring the word hallelujah praise be to jesus when saul when he come to check saul and saul savin i said a sheep and he's supposed to kill saved some of these good ones to offer make an offering for the lord you know that end up afterwards god repent he puts all there giving man a chance just to keep that word oh my praise god judges 10 reading from verse 6. tell your partner bible study so we just read churches 10 university and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord saved balaam ashta's watch the gods of syria the gods of zidon the gods of moab the gods of the children of ammon the gods of the philistines and forsook the lord and save not him so they're going off key and off track that was a you know backside right away in church another for a long boom and they and they caught from collecting outside you know just die slowly when somebody dropped the church they died in a long time when you miss them if they call the funeral box take them off stone dead and the question is how many more must die why are people dying see he said because iniquity will bond the love of many with back school iniquity is knowing to do right and not doing it so god gave us a chance to get cleansed and cleaned up that we could have a heart to god that we could correctly worship god he said the father seeketh such it have a search to worship him not just worship because of those who in vain do they worship me so it's not vain worship you don't want the ways to worship you want the father the worship that what the father seeking he seeketh such to worship him in spirit and in truth not in spirit and in error in spirit and in truth and to get the truth now it has to be revealed has to be unfolding so gosh and our messenger in his last day william marion branham to bring the truth with the promise that the spirit will come oh glory to god that he could effectively worship because this will be our worship back later that's why the beast system being going to be a force because they want worship they can still want that and he even belong here he can be boots and get kicked out of heaven and land on the earth this is our earth here that's what we have to reign on the earth this is not it and hostile he got kicked out and fell on the earth oh glory to god and interfere in the garden of eden but we can get back to eden and he get more boots to get he have like a fire they go to or give the lord a praise offering glory to god either he ever know no man's land hell will he have no fixed place of abode that's why he asked that wherever he's at to and fro all over the earth he have no fixed place of abode looking to do mischief but god say heaven is my throne that is my footstool what hoax will you build me but a body has thought prepared and god is repairing a bright body that he can step into it oh glory to god then you will see true worship king lamb worship or give the lord a shout to the house before we leave here we're gonna have genuine kingdom worship or glory not with your mouth only but with your heart also oh glory to god amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god and but isaac brought her on sunday this is the story of the bible they serve the lord and the backs and then they go on anything in bondage they repent and they come back and that's recycled over and over their cycle hour cycle and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he sold them into the hands of the philistines into the hands of the children of ammon and that year they vexed and oppressed the children of israel 18 years no there's not did you ever people you know these gosh people you know do you hear how long there was an oppression 18 years can i continue all the children of the other of israel that were on the other side of jordan in the land of the amorites which is gilead moreover the church of amman passover jordan to fight also against judah and against benjamin and against the house of ephraim so israel was so distressed and the children of israel cried unto the lord saying we have sinned against thee both because we are forsaken our god and also balaam and the lord senator of israel did not i deliver you from the egyptians and from the amorites from the children of ammon and from the philistines the zodians also the amalekites the meonites did oppress you and you cried to me and i delivered you out of the hand ye yet you have forsaken me and save other gods wherefore i will deliver you no more you know what the next line says god say go and cry unto the gods which you have chosen let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation you know what you want to save that let them deliver you don't come to me i wonder if this time coming around now because i will not deliver you i'll leave you up with your god you want you want yourself the god of your imagination the god in your own heart what you think he is what you feel he is what you feel he is not go and cry unto the gods which you have chosen let them deliver you in a time of tribulation and the church of israel i said unto the lord we have sinned do don't want us whatever seem good unto thee but deliver us only we pray thee this day and they put away the strange gosham among them and save the lord and his soul was on give the lord some praises people this is the word of the lord psalm 16 4 their sorrows shall be multiplied that he stood after other another god sorrows this looks nice that you start but you get a multiplication of sorrow by seeking after other gods you put money as your goal or business as you go to put anything in front of god god may let the business crash get the supplement that happened that happened to make sure you get it right don't forget the god that brought you out of egypt he told them didn't i bring you out i deliver you from this i bring you from this i break i look what you're treating me you already said he's a jealous god oh glory to god so we have to if we have to get it back right we have to come back to be becoming faithful because idolatry is really being unfaithful to god so it has to come back to our kind of faithfulness i want to be faithful in love faithful in obedience faithful to his word faithful to do what his word said to do put aside your feelings because your feelings could become a god and you're saving your feelings instead of the word you go in by your flesh instead of the spirit word oh glory to god you have to leave your feelings sometime you know you're feeling will lead you astray you know you have to bind that feeling and bring your flesh and subjection to the word you know oh glory to god you can't go by how you feel or what you think you have to go by what god said just before the coming of the lord jesus he sent the holy ghost to the church in this last day and the holy ghost has been a witness of his resurrection and prove that he lives and he's coming and the church gets himself ready and as we see the church making himself ready abstaining from fornications listen his wife had based already right listen to her i'm drilling on it now abstaining from fornication abstaining from idolatry abstaining from lust deficiencies and all the works of the flesh we the church and the people see the little congregation getting together stopping their drinking stopping their lying stopping their tackling stop everything that's of the flesh making themselves ready so you expect god to pull up with a pants and you'll put socks and shoes and jess here and then your ball you'll make yourself ready he said but his wife had made us already oh glory to god there's must be something for you to do this unchanging god-giver unchanging word and leave it here to see what we will do with his very word or give the lord our praise that's why he took the prophet off he have confidence that we're gonna make it you have confidence we will come to our senses like that prodigal son did he came to his senses he had enough big food ketchup and the pepper wasn't making it better it was still pig food making themselves ready screaming to the top of their voices and clapping their hands and shouting the victory that's the bride you know so if you're not screaming and shouting and praising god you have some works to do there's some ideas to get rid of there are some behaviors and some attitudes and some stuff that have to get burned out break down the altars praise be to jesus hallelujah hallelujah but the indians out in southwest they used to worship idols they had what they called the rain god it was a matata the node he lived down in the rain and tung in the earth and they believed that god of the rain comes down into the mud turtle in old pagan rome they used to have jupiter and many of other gods they would come they will say that those gods live and when you study mythology and so forth he said now how did they did it they had a big altar this statue stood upon it the worshipper coming he paid the priest for a candle and they went down to the temple sometimes there were several gods he sat in the altar and the god would find his way to his right image and they set it down and lit this candle then the worshiper the priest got some fruit ready made a sacrifice brought wine and he actually had communion with the idol and then he prostrated himself before the idol he laid there in such a stupor until the imaginary god that looked like the image that he had built come got into the idol and talked back to him through the idol so this image this idol speaks back to the worshipper but there's another image oh glory to god faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness probably kindness oh glory to god the image of jesus christ and you prostrate and borrow me for that and that that could speak to glory they've got the beast maker image and life had to come into that image that that image could speak but god of an image are going to be in the bride and that image will speak oh glory to god hallelujah the imaginary god the thought through an idol that he was able to hypnotize this god with his offering his burning candle into this god and then his soul got entangled with that you see it's the devil and he would think that god spoke back to his conscience through there and it was actually a god to him now how the prophet brought that type and he switched it over and out to the positive now god was going to show what a real god was and on the day of pentecost they prostrated themselves for 10 days another imaginary became a song from heaven like a russian mighty wind and it filled all the house with a living and god never took an idol he took a living man and placed himself by the baptism of the holy ghost into this man not imaginary god not imaginary thing but a reality of the real god in a real man and when this man rose up he worked the works of god oh glory to god oh glory to god give the lord a shout tonight strange that he did that strange that he didn't take some smart men that knowed something about that they tried to figure it out but he took a bunch of ignorant fishermen and put them up there and they prostrated themselves on the promise of god for 10 days and nights and then the god of heaven came and dwelt in those men and jesus said a little while and the world see me no more yet he shall see me i'll be with you even in you oh glory to god that's the reason he said in mark 16 these signs shall follow them to believe it was a living god in a man that could lay himself before god according to the word and the word of god may manifest in them it's a paradox and every time you see a man receive the baptism of the holy ghost it's a paradox how the god of heaven makes himself known in this man talking through him working through him living through him it's a paradox and we are in the image of god and god took his own image and brought himself into the image of his own image that he made he stepped into his own image okay the lord i shout what is it a paradox and course in a word message to put the image inside of you that that image is the body that he gonna step into air to a glory to god what a paradox glory to god the true worshipers gonna worship in spirit untruth oh my we are about to close first john 5 21 says little children keep yourselves from idols and the amplified it says little children keep yourself from idols false gods from every anything from everything that would occupy the place in your heart due to god from any sort of substitute for him that would take first place in your life so let it be first corinthians 10 14 wherefore my beloved wherefore my dear beloved free from idolatry the amplified therefore my daily beloved shun keep clear from avoid by flight if need be any sort of idolatry of loving or venerating anything more than god amen if you put this spoken books above god is idolatry when i'm saying you know you're not really praying you're not communicating with god you're just reading reading reading and reading you have to meet the god that what you're reading oh glory to god hallelujah describing pharisees had the books in them they were reading or when the living would come they rejected it hallelujah you can put anything as a god colossians 3 verse 1 says if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitted on the right hand of god set your affectionate things above not on things of the earth for you are dead and your life is healed with christ in god musician please when christ who is our life shall appear then shall he also appear with him in glory listen to this mortified therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil conspiracies and consciousnesses which is idolatry he actually say conversation senses which is idolatry and consciousness is a strong desire to possess or have something especially something that belongs to someone else that's confidential you're not it's confident because that person have it and your eyes long it's got a long eye you want it after it and that passion that i was driving you that's what happened yeah god said don't take nothing from them they don't take the silver don't take the gold ache and eyes see it and he tells he said boy there's a good investment you know it was in his heart just like locked wife heart wants to look back in aiken's heart he coveted that that babylonian garment a garment that garment he coveted that and his whole family gets stolen he died they fight him out tried by tribe family my family man by man because god is the god that switched the reins of the heart if you give away don't touch it don't touch it it's babylonian garment don't touch it return more influence upon those things that you take more demonic influences it will affect the family it can affect your house for which king's sake okay so watch evil cos persons con constance covetousness which is idolatry all right for which things seek the wrath of god comment on the churn of disobedience in the which he also walked some time when you lived in them but now you also have to put off these things now he's not talking to non-christians here he's talking to christian believers who have stuff to deal with so you say you've got to put away watch he said he said no you put off anger rat malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth lying at one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him wherefore there is neither greek nor jews circumcision or uncircumcision barbarian skintion born or free but christ is all in and all right oh my so when you talk about uh uh um what what scripture is that here five mortify and the amplified it says so kill deaden deprive of power the evil desire looking in your members those animal impulses and all that is earthly in you that is employed in sin look at that employees sexual advice impurity sensual appetites unholy desires and all greed and confidences for that is idolatry the define of self and other created things instead of god the defining of self and other things praise and be to jesus hallelujah galatians 5. you're almost done galatians 5 13 says for brethren you have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love save one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself and if you bite and evolve one another take heed as he be not consume one another then i say then walk in the spirit you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusted against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary one to another so then you cannot do the things that you would but if you be led by the spirit you are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest and he's going to identify what it is which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lazy viciousness idolatry so isolator is a work of the flesh witchcraft hatred variance emulations rats strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revelants and such like of which i tell you as such i've told you in times past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law and they are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust and if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another and envying one another oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah so tonight we address what i will call the internal idolatry what desires we have on the inside oh praise beaten jesus do you believe that so what is in your life that has taken you away from god hallelujah praise god what are you putting first sports first movies first social media fools what surfers pawn face job first children first monitors what do you have in your life oh praise god do you have love of family love of self love of knowledge and final scripture and jesus said this after he said no man can save two masters he said therefore i say unto you take no taught for your life you begin to pray something what you shall eat what you shall drink no yet for your body what you shall put on is that life more than meat this is from matthew 6 and the body in one and rain man behold the falls of the air they sow not neither do they reap nor garden to bands yet your heavenly father feeded them are you not better than they which have you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature why take his thought for reignment considerably the field how they grow the toilet need to do this spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was never read like one of these therefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which the day is and the more is cast into the oven shall he not more clothe you or you have little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink where till shall we be clothed for after these things the gentiles see for heavenly father know it what you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall
