[1:03:52] harvest as well as you represent
[1:03:54] sleepless on the harvest and what song
[1:03:57] it represents many things like for the
[1:04:00] channel said ukridge Tom took there's a
[1:04:02] very vast subject you should preface
[1:04:05] because it covers the whole of human the
[1:04:07] human race from Ethan - Ethan again a
[1:04:12] little from eternity past to Eternity
[1:04:15] again has the story and said these are
[1:04:19] the harvest this was so fast it's so
[1:04:23] massive the see it's so it's so it's so
[1:04:26] expanses I see it don't you that's what
[1:04:28] the harvest represents or the prison but
[1:04:31] we can narrow it down to just a few
[1:04:34] words that tell to move so we can bring
[1:04:36] a message together
[1:04:37] the hobbits represents llama so deeply
[1:04:41] time of rewards harvest represent
[1:04:44] fullness amen there are in my scriptures

[1:05:48] 13 okay so I'll run through them quickly
[1:05:52] Genesis 1 this scripture here talks
[1:05:55] about because Isaac said statically
[1:05:56] Japan and brother Vincent Rev energy
[1:05:59] they the harvest began in Genesis and
[1:06:04] you want to understand everything use in
[1:06:06] Genesis 264 Genesis confirm the fact
[1:06:11] part of God's mind and I went what were
[1:06:14] Genesis is illusionist that's when it
[1:06:16] entered the luckiest to the realm of
[1:06:18] human existence where the average man
[1:06:21] can read blah blah blah here these
[1:06:23] crutches here and possibly try to
[1:06:25] understand the compromise is one here

[1:06:33] earth bring forth grass the herb
[1:06:35] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[1:06:37] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[1:06:40] is itself upon the earth and it was so

[1:12:16] one that's what they harvest represent
[1:12:20] participate numbers for the it
[1:12:21] represents abundance represents
[1:12:24] expansion represents growth represents

[1:26:57] taste the owner of the harvest a little
[1:27:00] poop is they create all the happy this
[1:27:03] idea a loss of a harvest come from in
[1:27:06] the first instance anyways come from you
[1:27:09] know from the great famine your
[1:27:11] countrymen come from the great famine or
[1:27:17] anywhere oh the very idea of a hammer
[1:27:21] stood up what song from God himself
[1:27:24] because God has the truth is the lord of
[1:27:27] the harvest and it's the rule of the
[1:27:29] habit in other words principles or they
[1:27:33] haven't simplistic to the principles
[1:27:34] that govern any harvest and shut what
[1:27:37] this concept the concept of contents of
[1:27:40] the harvest contest you'll open concept
[1:27:42] of a harvest once at all
[1:27:44] so the principles of a habit is
[1:27:46] principal source of the half-brothers

[1:30:52] consequence big crime big consequence
[1:30:57] from the principle of the bible met the
[1:30:59] principal many times if you see of one
[1:31:01] what you saw the Cuckoo's is more a bit
[1:31:05] compared to the consequences that you
[1:31:06] reap property or consequence could
[1:31:08] replace the one major principle that
[1:31:11] recovers human existence ego in genesis
[1:31:16] with the ocean nor seek god it's a lot
[1:31:19] of the habits to see that principle
[1:31:21] everywhere he lost a principle to a call
[1:31:24] a son into action
[1:31:26] seriously let's happy light yellow and
[1:31:29] that was like a joke in Nigeria yeah

[1:32:24] so anyway the to transfer so God did you
[1:32:28] when it came down
[1:32:29] don't let this because she's a lot of
[1:32:31] the harvest you were limited to no more
[1:32:33] honey planted a synthesis let the earth
[1:32:36] be cooler brings forth to reproach so
[1:32:39] the seed who can world who is the
[1:32:44] original see in a civil suit planted
[1:32:47] desires in the trust of the ground the
[1:32:52] papal share into season Alice's into
[1:32:57] 1000 every see super sort of its kind
[1:33:01] slipper to distress is wrought for fruit
[1:33:04] every fruit seed very simple same and I
[1:33:09] can be planted against the most a man so
[1:33:13] you see right there super useful a great
[1:33:15] husband man good a lot of a hybrid
[1:33:18] riding Genesis the principles that
[1:33:22] coffin Lee have hallelujah hallelujah
[1:33:26] glory to God you are as usual because a
[1:33:29] lot of average only need to go to him
[1:33:32] fully understand the paper is Harris as
[1:33:36] you see the number see some origins
[1:33:44] [Music]
[1:34:47] so fully honest and we understand their
[1:34:51] origin is in the harvest dude up once we
[1:34:53] have got to go to the Lord of the
[1:34:55] harvest Holly to let us honest anybody
[1:34:59] origin what it represents it Kelly
[1:35:02] please don't worry me see you don't
[1:35:05] think I look because jesus said species
[1:35:21] diversity
[1:35:22] I'm one since the end of the world in
[1:35:23] our faith wounds amen I mean now this
[1:35:26] means many things so that people of amen
[1:35:31] a spiritual eye to look at the Word of
[1:35:35] God they can be a parolee length the
[1:35:39] breath
[1:35:39] DUSU flu they'll they hide loose oof now
[1:35:43] what the depth of a life to get a
[1:35:45] bird's-eye view of Wow
[1:35:48] a few of the word of God
[1:35:51] holiday to to another word Penelope like
[1:35:54] a Seventh Seal
[1:35:55] except sue that shoots I won't stab more
[1:35:58] from that one stab goes on another
[1:36:00] factor computer 12 from each that goes
[1:36:02] and the five pieces it is split seconds
[1:36:06] time is she was said you have covered
[1:36:08] all my stairs
[1:36:09] ooh that's the power of a single
[1:36:13] passenger silly to you that's a power
[1:36:17] set up whistle or the scripture the
[1:36:19] liquid to when Jesus said here since
[1:36:21] you're the harvest is the end of one so
[1:36:23] setup of the world how people that means
[1:36:26] many things sum total of it is this to
[1:36:30] the harvest is the end of one so
[1:36:33] cellophane of course Jesus was speaking
[1:36:35] she super lay about the great average to
[1:36:38] pilot the end of the age but how you can
[1:36:43] or even know mokuba's cook with so dope
[1:36:46] listen that is the principle completely
[1:36:51] Polly thanks about people from Genesis
[1:36:56] all the way to Revelation from way back
[1:37:01] in eternity Jesus was speaking she pilot
[1:37:08] the harvest is the end of the world
[1:37:09] wasn't enough anymore
[1:37:10] but here's the point here Memphis to the
[1:37:12] point was principal the principal of the
[1:37:15] high branch do no more so is that the
[1:37:16] harvest is the end one song along from
[1:37:19] the coin it has an end to this
[1:37:21] automatically follows Masuda it has a
[1:37:23] beginning much cuba
[1:37:24] solution so the principle here see the
[1:37:27] prints it isn't as the beginning like
[1:37:29] como Sumer and an end so everything in
[1:37:32] this wall here below such shows she said
[1:37:35] prepare in other words put the harvest
[1:37:37] number says the end of the world in a
[1:37:40] fateful they can also be translated to
[1:37:41] mean so that poses the harvest to
[1:37:44] Nebojsa is the end elephant of
[1:37:46] everything in this world the touch so
[1:37:48] she she Saturday they harvest the most
[1:37:50] so represents the present end
[1:37:53] feel anything you beginning this is the
[1:37:56] average that's how they harvest but
[1:37:59] super passes influence is say in every
[1:38:04] single area of your life to position
[1:38:07] that's why they have a swell up what
[1:38:09] does it say in every single day of your
[1:38:13] life suta parties whether you realize it
[1:38:15] or not
[1:38:15] hopefully really do and you are writing
[1:38:17] your story if you are writing your
[1:38:20] harvest stories they keep it but this
[1:38:22] working on what's one little action Oh
[1:38:26] hallelujah amen and is this very simple
[1:38:33] principle is a principle that there's a
[1:38:35] beginning
[1:38:35] you know come on Sue got an end to
[1:38:38] everything in this wall shows no subbu
[1:38:40] is this principal the princ amix the
[1:38:42] harvest he preaches origins goodies
[1:38:45] concepts or constraints practice that's
[1:38:49] what makes it the story of us what is
[1:38:50] the key because every single day but
[1:38:52] still shut Jewish that's something to do
[1:38:54] physical in something it's not and the
[1:38:57] shoes is the big one is coming the final
[1:39:01] harvest is coming off you are super
[1:39:05] rotten you have a story to call it Oh
[1:39:13] every single one of you every man every
