[23:41] I believe we are in fragration this
[23:43] morning
[23:44] do you believe that
[23:46] you appreciate
[23:50] [Music]
[23:51] [Applause]
[23:56] for love
[23:58] and appreciate our precious brother
[24:00] for the great stand he has taken and the
[24:03] blessings that he has been to me
[24:07] as an individual
[24:09] and to the body of Christ
[24:12] over the years
[24:14] ever and
[24:16] um in the message seven Church ages as
[24:18] you get ready to come the
[24:19] um the revelation of Jesus Christ
[24:21] said elevation 15 3 it says and they
[24:25] sing the song of Moses the servant of
[24:28] God and the song of the lamb saying
[24:31] great and marvelous other works Lord God
[24:34] Almighty
[24:36] just untrue other ways Thou King of sins
[24:41] the prophet said you see it the lamb the
[24:44] high priest holding his blood as an
[24:47] atonement of The Mercy Seat for our sins
[24:51] is the Lord God Almighty
[24:54] the lamb the high priest holding his
[24:56] blood as an atonement or The Mercy Seat
[24:58] for our sins is the Lord God Almighty
[25:03] that is his present office that's what
[25:06] he is doing now
[25:07] building his blood for us but one day
[25:10] that lamb will become the lion of the
[25:12] tribe of Judah he will comfort in power
[25:15] and glory and take his authority to
[25:18] reign as king
[25:20] he is the coming king of this Earth
[25:24] and he said of course that does not say
[25:26] he is not King now
[25:28] for he is our King
[25:30] King of the Saints
[25:32] oh can we say Amen
[25:35] right now it is a spiritual Kingdom
[25:39] it is not of this world system even as
[25:42] we are not of this world
[25:44] that is a reason we act different from
[25:47] the world
[25:48] our citizenship is in heaven
[25:51] we reflect the spirit of the world of
[25:54] our rebate where Jesus is the king
[25:58] that is why our women do not dress
[26:01] immense clothing
[26:02] or cut their hair or use all those
[26:06] cosmetics
[26:08] and other things that the world like so
[26:10] much
[26:13] that's a reason
[26:15] that is why our men don't drink and
[26:18] smoke
[26:18] and carry on a sin
[26:21] our Dominion is the dominion over sin
[26:25] and it is enforced to the power that is
[26:29] in the spirit of Christ
[26:31] that dwells that indwells us and he said
[26:34] every Kingdom on Earth is going to be
[26:37] torn down
[26:39] but our kingdom will remain
[26:43] charity never sell it
[26:47] our kingdom will remain
[26:49] hallelujah
[26:51] amen I pray that the Lord will bless you
[26:54] this morning
[26:55] and give us a mighty time in his
[26:57] presence and I know he will meet every
[27:00] need
[27:01] in our lives this morning you appreciate
[27:03] the Lord Jesus

[27:07] sins

[31:58] careful not just at the end of this

[32:10] all the glory for we ask you with
[32:12] Thanksgiving to the glory of God in the
[32:15] name of Jesus Christ a risen resurrected
[32:18] Lord and Savior and Redeemer and the
[32:20] people of God said amen
[32:22] amen God richly bless you so we can go
[32:25] into the world this morning so let's
[32:27] send the prayer feeders away from the
[32:28] scriptures amen
[32:34] all right I'll actually invite attention
[32:36] to um
[32:37] three portions of scripture Isaiah 9.
[32:41] uh are we from verses six and seven
[32:43] Saint John 1 and verse 12.
[32:46] and acts 1 and verse 8.
[32:53] Isaiah 9
[32:56] um
[32:57] reach on these wires
[33:00] For unto all the sun is born unto us his
[33:04] son is given
[33:05] and the government shall be upon his
[33:07] shoulder
[33:08] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[33:10] counselor
[33:12] the Mighty God the Everlasting father
[33:14] the Prince of Peace
[33:17] five descriptions there of this son of
[33:20] this child who becomes a son
[33:23] amen and you know you know right away
[33:25] there there is there's something he's
[33:28] trying to tell you that there because
[33:30] you can't put the weight of government
[33:33] upon the shoulders of a child
[33:37] the child will crumble under the weight
[33:39] of the government
[33:42] amen
[33:43] so you can see it's telling you this
[33:45] child has become a son who can carry the
[33:50] weight because the weight of going upon
[33:52] his shoulder means Authority
[33:54] rulership Dominion even power amen
[33:59] wisdom maturity that's what it
[34:01] represents verse 7 of the increase of
[34:04] his government and peace there shall be
[34:08] no end so it only receives the
[34:09] government it increases in power it's
[34:12] still upon the throne of David and upon
[34:15] his kingdom to order it and to establish
[34:19] it with judgment and with Justice from
[34:22] henceforth even forever
[34:25] not you but the Zeal of the Lord of
[34:28] hosts will perform this amen now I know
[34:32] this is speaking about Jesus Christ
[34:34] specifically but like brothers
[34:36] scriptures apply to you at least two
[34:39] different ways but many times in so many
[34:42] different ways and because that's
[34:43] speaking about Jesus Christ Our Lord Our
[34:45] Redeemer thus speaks about us and
[34:48] brother Benham said if you have the
[34:49] faith put your name in the scriptures
[34:51] and so we know this child this son is
[34:56] speaking about us also amen and acts 1
[34:58] chapter 8 Acts chapter 1 verse 8 I'm
[35:01] sorry
[35:02] but you shall receive power after that
[35:04] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[35:06] shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[35:08] Jerusalem and in Julia and in Samaria
[35:11] and onto the ultimate Spirits or the
[35:13] most part of the earth amen Lord Irish
[35:16] especially what God bless you and be
[35:18] seated
[35:37] thank you
[35:40] all right
[35:42] um God bless you I will travel over here
[35:44] too long so
[35:46] um but I got a job this morning uh my
[35:49] child is
[35:52] killed children are born
[35:54] but sons are given
[35:57] [Music]
[36:10] um just bear with me I'm trying to get
[36:11] my notes together here
[36:16] [Applause]
[36:19] all right
[36:21] I have a few that scriptures
[36:24] um and I'll read one of them Galatians 4
[36:26] verses 107. and um also Ephesians 1
[36:30] verses 46.
[36:34] and um
[36:36] Genesis 1 verses 26-28 and Genesis 2 7.
[36:40] Galatians 4 verses 107 reach on this
[36:44] wise you don't have to get it already
[36:46] now I see that the air as long as the
[36:48] child
[36:49] different nothing from a seven though he
[36:52] built the Lord of all
[36:56] the child is on the tutors and governors
[36:59] until the time appointed of the father
[37:03] even so we when we were children wine
[37:06] bondage under the
[37:08] elements of the world elements of the
[37:11] world the lust of the eyes the lust of
[37:13] the Flesh and the pride of life because
[37:16] that's how we come here and that's
[37:17] that's in us from
[37:20] um childhood all the way up until we
[37:22] meet the Lord Jesus Christ and his
[37:24] Spirit comes into our souls and that
[37:27] changes us from inside out
[37:29] and something else happens on the inside
[37:31] of us and we can live a different life
[37:32] in control and authority over the
[37:35] elements of the world
[37:38] verse 4 but when the fullness of the
[37:41] time was come
[37:43] God sent forth his son switching over
[37:45] from child to the son now man of a woman
[37:49] made under the law to redeem them that
[37:52] were under the law that we might receive
[37:55] the adoption of sons
[37:58] and because he has Sons God has sent
[38:01] forth the spirit of his son into your
[38:05] heart's crying Abba Father
[38:09] wherefore that abnormal is sovereign
[38:13] not a child no more
[38:15] because the child differed not
[38:17] information he told us earlier on in
[38:20] verse 1.
[38:22] wherefore that abnormal A7 no more child
[38:25] but a song and even son then an air of
[38:29] God through Jesus Christ
[38:31] adoption time amen God bless you amen my
[38:36] inspiration is
[38:39] in blessing I Will Bless thee in
[38:43] multiplying I will multiply thy C amen
[38:47] until I want to read that from um
[38:49] Genesis chapter 22.
[38:55] I may not get to it but um I just read
[38:58] it all the same Genesis 22 and verse 15
[39:00] through verse 17.
[39:03] and the angel of the Lord called unto
[39:05] Abraham Out of Heaven the second time
[39:07] and said by myself have I sworn
[39:11] uh um say of the Lord
[39:13] for because thou has done this thing and
[39:17] brother Malik has spoke about Brokenness
[39:21] you've got everything before you can
[39:23] claim any access or expect any access to
[39:27] his glory and power at all
[39:30] by myself have I sworn say of the Lord
[39:34] for because thou has done this thing and
[39:37] has not withheld thy son
[39:40] thine only son
[39:43] that in blessing I Will Bless thee and
[39:46] in multiplying I will multiply thy seed
[39:49] as the stars of the heaven
[39:52] and as a sandwich upon the seashore and
[39:56] thy sea shall possess the kids of his
[40:00] enemies amen and invite see shall all
[40:03] the nations of the earth be blessed
[40:05] because thou has obeyed my voice amen of
[40:11] his holy words amen God bless you
[40:13] so um
[40:15] post um
[40:19] um when Paul came
[40:21] the Bible says the book of Hebrews and
[40:24] historians let us know that the book of
[40:26] Hebrews
[40:27] delved Moon until the mysteries of God
[40:31] as they were revealed through the Old
[40:33] Testament years and Hebrews lets us see
[40:36] a whole lot of what you know wasn't a
[40:39] man of God for the New Testament
[40:40] Christian Church
[40:42] now because in Isaiah speaking about the
[40:46] common Messiah it has been spoken that
[40:50] unto all the child is given
[40:54] unto us a child is born and unto us a
[40:57] son is given and the government shall be
[41:00] upon his shoulder and his name Shall be
[41:03] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[41:07] God the Everlasting father the Prince of
[41:11] Peace amen house
[41:14] Christianity doesn't see the son as the
[41:17] father really beats my imagination even
[41:20] from that from this verse verses alone
[41:23] you can see that Jesus Christ
[41:26] or the New Testament
[41:28] Jehovah of the Old Testament
[41:31] it's so obvious but that's not our Focus
[41:34] this morning so under all the childish
[41:37] born and was and was his son is given
[41:40] now notice even though many times we use
[41:43] the words child and son interchangeably
[41:47] and it's okay to do so
[41:49] you can go or dedicated the baby son
[41:53] daughter
[41:54] you know a child is the same thing but
[41:57] in the context of scriptures when you
[42:00] read in between the lines like brother
[42:01] Graham explain to us
[42:03] there's a little difference between a
[42:05] child and a son amen
[42:09] now
[42:11] so even though we use the words
[42:12] interchangeably there's a little
[42:14] difference between the two words
[42:16] and many words in scriptures were used
[42:18] like that for example we talk about our
[42:21] salvation but really
[42:24] Our Gospel is a gospel of redemption
[42:27] salvation is only a part of redemption
[42:31] but many times it's usually a lot about
[42:33] salvation and Redemption and it's all
[42:35] right once you understand the context of
[42:38] it is okay once you understand when
[42:41] we're talking salvation we're not just
[42:42] talking about getting saved and giving
[42:44] your heart to the Lord we are talking
[42:46] about going all the way to adoption time
[42:49] to where you will stand on the face of
[42:52] this Earth amen the spirit of God
[42:55] anointed again into the Flesh of man to
[42:59] wait you will have thus saying the Lord
[43:01] or keep still to where God will have
[43:03] three more words to you here ye him
[43:07] adoption
[43:10] if you understand that then you can
[43:12] interchangeably use salvation and
[43:14] Redemption but Pentecost the Baptist the
[43:17] preach salvation but Malachi for he
[43:20] brought a gospel of redemption
[43:23] Hallelujah
[43:24] you may be seated
[43:27] amen and Redemption Malachi for Taurus
[43:31] is an inheritance that was lost but has
[43:35] not been restored back to us that's not
[43:37] salvation that is redemption redeemed
[43:41] when the Seven Seals were broken redeem
[43:44] amen when I saw my name in the book read
[43:48] them from the father foundations of the
[43:50] world I'm sure that's your song Too Many
[43:54] that's your song Let me hear you say
[43:55] Amen
[43:57] are you in church are you in church this
[44:00] morning amen I hope so you maybe see
[44:03] that
[44:03] amen amen so in the same way in the same
[44:08] way like salvation and Redemption same
[44:10] way
[44:11] child and son they say shuttle
[44:14] difference there but God veiled that in
[44:18] the scriptures but Malachi for that
[44:21] great Elijah prophet of America he
[44:23] unveiled on their tallest seals open and
[44:27] make God In Plain Sight Jordan plain
[44:30] size
[44:31] oh you thank God for that great larger
[44:33] prophet glory to God amen amen so once
[44:38] we understand the context we can use
[44:40] child and some the same way like in
[44:43] Ephesians 4 Paul talked about the
[44:46] adoption of children by Jesus Christ but
[44:48] when you look into the context of
[44:50] scriptures from Genesis to Revelation
[44:52] let the message of Malachi for explore
[44:55] explain the scriptures to you and I then
[44:58] you'll know what he's talking about
[44:59] there is the adoption of sons like he
[45:02] said in so many other places even in
[45:04] Ephesians and all through his Epistles
[45:05] amen
[45:07] you may be seated Hallelujah
[45:14] so once we understand we can use the
[45:16] phrases interchangeably amen excuse me
[45:30] [Applause]
[45:40] Hallelujah
[45:56] thank you
[46:03] so when it was a child is born and unto
[46:05] us his son is given so children are born
[46:09] but sons are given amen
[46:13] what's it what's the difference what's
[46:15] the Gap I already said
[46:17] from what he said in Isaiah
[46:21] on was a child is born and towards the
[46:24] son is given and the government shall be
[46:26] upon his shoulder
[46:27] a child cannot carry anything cannot a
[46:31] child is carry you carry a child
[46:34] but for the child to carry something
[46:36] that child has grown to become a song
[46:37] I'm not sure with morsels and everything
[46:40] so he's telling you something there
[46:42] between the child and the son there's a
[46:45] gap there's this case of time a span of
[46:48] time
[46:49] and when that child goes to the span of
[46:52] time and becomes a son he can be given
[46:54] authority to pick the government upon
[46:57] his shoulder amen gonna give an
[47:00] authority in the kingdom of God and then
[47:02] his word is as good as the father
[47:04] amen thus say of the Lord or keep still
[47:08] can I get a witness from somebody
[47:11] amen
[47:13] amen
[47:15] so the difference is
[47:17] children are born but sons are given at
[47:21] Birth you are a child and infant a baby
[47:25] and those who teach us those things let
[47:27] us know when a baby is born between the
[47:29] first two years of a baby's life is
[47:31] called an infant
[47:33] when it starts to work and fall and walk
[47:36] when it stabilizes feet a bit it's
[47:38] called a toddler yes and then the child
[47:41] grows up tomorrow and gets into that age
[47:43] amen where he can converse with you and
[47:46] then you know this child is growing
[47:48] amen you can't put anything on that
[47:50] child
[47:51] no he's not responsible no he's not
[47:54] aware enough he's not conscious enough
[47:56] even of the world around him for you to
[47:58] give him that kind of responsibility so
[48:00] the child needs to grow
[48:02] amen amen amen oh Hallelujah so you were
[48:08] born and after you were born as a child
[48:11] an infant you need some growing up to do
[48:14] before you you become somebody that can
[48:18] be given sonship
[48:20] amen amen
[48:24] send you one of us did I read that no no
[48:27] I didn't I'm so sorry
[48:32] I didn't read my scriptures but have
[48:35] mercy I must be getting old
[48:39] wow
[48:41] it used to be that you know
[48:43] I could I could memorize all my
[48:45] scriptures and come to preach for
[48:48] I won't tell you
[48:50] so so you won't think Lord help us let
[48:54] that anointing not come upon him from
[48:55] the old gems and he preaches those long
[48:57] hours so but I used to be able to
[48:59] memorize my scriptures and just just
[49:02] just read off it but you know I'm
[49:04] getting old so uh
[49:06] so these young men tell me that you know
[49:08] you're not looking all are still them um
[49:10] um I'm following your footsteps
[49:13] if you are not old I am not old
[49:15] but I'm sorry just um open your Bibles
[49:19] or if you if you can let me just read it
[49:21] send John chapter 1 and verse 12. but as
[49:24] many as received him to them give him
[49:26] power to become the sons of God are you
[49:30] reading that
[49:30] even to them that believe on his name so
[49:33] they believe on his name first and then
[49:35] they are given power to become Sons
[49:39] give even something Sansa given even
[49:44] power to become songs right in plain
[49:48] sight can you say amen amen
[49:52] and acts 1 8 here is our promise that we
[49:56] are going to be receive the same thing
[49:59] ye shall receive power after that the
[50:04] Holy Ghost is come upon you and he shall
[50:07] be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem
[50:09] and you know Judea and in Samaria and
[50:13] you know uh
[50:18] and onto the ultimate Spirit of the
[50:20] Earth
[50:21] amen Lord are His blessings of his holy
[50:24] watch
[50:25] amen so Psalms children are born by sons
[50:29] they're given and like uh uh the Apostle
[50:33] John let us see there
[50:35] will receive him
[50:37] believe on him
[50:39] become a child of God I know we are
[50:41] given something to help us to become
[50:45] sons of God and when we get to that spot
[50:48] brother Brown said a man can be
[50:51] something and then if God I don't
[50:54] actually quote now but I mean I'll read
[50:56] it but Mom said God calls you Assad and
[50:59] give you something
[51:00] to shake the nations with that song's
[51:04] been given something amen
[51:09] amen hallelujah
[51:12] amen
[51:14] so we start as as children and then
[51:17] about sons that can be evenly given
[51:20] songs
[51:22] amen and that side is with everything in
[51:25] life
[51:26] almost everything in life your status a
[51:28] little child and then you go up there
[51:31] amen you go through the process of
[51:33] growth and maturing amen and tutoring
[51:37] and training and character formation
[51:40] until you get to the spot to where you
[51:44] are ready for promotion to the next
[51:45] level
[51:46] amen
[51:50] you don't go to school and start from
[51:54] ss1 no you start as a child in js1 you
[51:59] don't go to medical school and start at
[52:03] seeing patience no you start from a
[52:06] child and then you take some training
[52:08] and some tutoring and then you come to
[52:11] where it is someone a doctor an engineer
[52:15] that can be given
[52:17] your degree given authority to see
[52:21] patience and see clients and represent
[52:25] them in court before the judges children
[52:27] are born but sons are given is the
[52:30] principle that runs throughout all of
[52:31] life
[52:35] [Applause]
[52:38] and while you are going through the
[52:40] training you might not see the need for
[52:42] some other things like for example I
[52:44] really
[52:45] up till now I'm still trying to make
[52:47] sense of some of the stuff that I
[52:49] learned in medical school in the early
[52:51] years I don't see their relevance to
[52:52] medicine at all
[52:55] I don't I still don't but I subscribe to
[53:00] the superior knowledge of those who from
[53:03] the curriculum that they know better
[53:04] than I mean that I needed those things
[53:07] so while the child is going through
[53:09] their process of training they think
[53:12] many things they don't need as a
[53:14] manufacturing when get to a spot to
[53:16] where they think they know everything I
[53:18] call it the age of infinite wisdom no
[53:21] you have gone through that with your
[53:22] children and your children are going to
[53:24] go through the center of their own
[53:25] children because that's just the way
[53:27] life is that's just the way we are the
[53:30] child gets to where he thinks he knows
[53:32] everything but a child that can take his
[53:35] training and if the trainer is a
[53:37] masterful trainer under the guidance of
[53:39] the holy spirit that child in due
[53:42] process of time will come to the spot to
[53:45] where they can be given something and
[53:48] trusted with authority trust them with
[53:50] responsibility trusted to carry out the
[53:53] father's will and you say Amen
[53:57] you may be seated amen
[54:01] oh Hallelujah
[54:03] amen children are born but sons are
[54:06] given and sonship speaks of an
[54:09] inheritance
[54:10] that is given given that inheritance
[54:13] given a position given Authority given a
[54:16] responsibility amen sonship speaks about
[54:19] inheritance given to Sons
[54:23] amen it also speaks of
[54:26] adulthood somebody who's responsible
[54:29] mature enough that has taken their
[54:31] training and you can trust them with
[54:34] responsibility
[54:35] amen amen amen
[54:38] [Music]
[54:39] so therefore there's a space a spinal
[54:43] time between the child and the son
[54:47] in the Bible context
[54:50] amen
[54:53] in the corners of scripture there is a
[54:55] space
[54:56] and even your own natural experience too
[54:58] there is a space
[54:59] amen and I should run through a few
[55:02] examples for you I'll try not to hold
[55:04] you too long because I have these things
[55:06] to be a long whiny preacher and you know
[55:09] all that but
[55:10] after all that has been spoken I don't
[55:12] really need to say much
[55:13] but anyway just you're happy to get a
[55:16] context of this because the Basic
[55:17] Brothers here and say charity never feel
[55:19] it should let me see how we come to that
[55:21] school child never feel it shiny never
[55:23] flood means that he never fails he's
[55:25] always successful in every single thing
[55:27] Charlie doesn't feel and if you're if
[55:30] you apply the principles of Charity to
[55:32] everything that you do you will always
[55:34] come out right
[55:35] you'll come out right in your Christian
[55:37] Life you're coming right in your walk
[55:39] with God you come out right in your
[55:41] relationships you'll come around in your
[55:43] business life you're coming right in
[55:44] your school life you're coming right in
[55:46] everything because charity never fails I
[55:51] don't know what other pill you can apply
[55:53] that doesn't fail at all in anything man
[55:56] some things that work in the church I
[55:58] mean that works in the in the home may
[56:01] not walk in the church
[56:02] something that work in the office may
[56:04] not walk in your village may not walk in
[56:06] my Village but charity works everywhere
[56:09] the same way every time because charity
[56:12] never fails can you say amen and you say
[56:17] charity never failure
[56:20] nobody never fail at no no no no father
[56:23] bam said there is one thing God cannot
[56:25] do
[56:27] that is he cannot fail so you know
[56:30] charity is God himself
[56:33] oh Hallelujah so when we are talking
[56:35] about the power of the spirit we are
[56:37] talking about the power of God to bring
[56:40] you to the spot to where you will never
[56:43] fail because charity is dwelling in you
[56:46] with a speed of believing God in
[56:49] fullness and the authority and power of
[56:52] Jesus Christ
[56:54] amen amen amen all glory to God
[57:00] amen and then if I should skip this here
[57:03] Oh Glory
[57:05] but anyway
[57:08] a few examples should let you see the
[57:11] Gap fill the Gap in for you
[57:14] when a woman takes in seed we call that
[57:17] conception the meeting of the male and
[57:19] female eggs
[57:21] and that's
[57:22] a baby conceived in the womb there
[57:25] but that's not a child yet
[57:28] Medical Science fetus brother Charles
[57:31] right
[57:33] Medical Science course the defeaters
[57:35] where is Dr enoka
[57:37] as you know
[57:41] oh you just stepped I don't care right
[57:42] because when I'm talking those talk to
[57:45] things I I'm very careful so
[57:48] the doctors don't tell me that
[57:51] way you talk so anyway
[57:53] so the doctors I mean Medical Science
[57:55] will call that a features it's not a
[57:57] child yet
[57:59] the fetus
[58:00] and doesn't even have life until like
[58:02] about three four five six weeks really
[58:05] because when the blood cell breaks
[58:07] that's when life comes flowing through
[58:09] that thing in the mother's womb because
[58:11] the life is in the blood
[58:13] amen
[58:15] glory to God Amen
[58:19] amen
[58:23] so conception first
[58:26] and then when the the baby is conceived
[58:30] and blood is Flowing then the parts are
[58:33] formed
[58:34] fail after sale after sale is formed and
[58:38] forms the baby in the mother's womb and
[58:41] one of the mysteries of creation that it
[58:43] really
[58:44] amazes me is like Solomon said after
[58:47] maybe Ecclesiastes 11 or somewhere
[58:49] around there Solomon said that
[58:53] my bones in my mother's womb
[58:56] how God can hide our poems our bones can
[58:59] even be bent but God can God's wisdom
[59:02] can hide them in our mother's womb what
[59:04] a mighty God we share
[59:06] oh truly we are fearfully and
[59:09] wonderfully made
[59:11] Hallelujah
[59:15] [Applause]
[59:18] right
[59:19] and if he can do that
[59:21] surely he can take good care of you and
[59:23] me they can heal every disease they can
[59:27] heal every cell he knows yourselves by
[59:30] name he can heal every single ailment
[59:33] and if you went through that prayer line
[59:35] last night amen the angel is about to
[59:38] visit your neighborhood
[59:39] Hallelujah
[59:43] [Applause]
[59:48] the angel is going to visit your
[59:50] neighborhood I felt such a prince of the
[59:53] Holy Spirit on that prayer line last
[59:55] night I couldn't help the tears running
[59:57] down my cheeks and brother Pam said when
[1:00:00] you feel that way the angel is there
[1:00:02] somewhere around there and know the
[1:00:04] angel is here today the angel called the
[1:00:07] holy spirit is there he's walking up and
[1:00:10] down his eyes he's walking up and down
[1:00:13] from Heart to Heart from Ben to bench
[1:00:15] from Hallelujah the angel is here and if
[1:00:20] he's here what deep demon what devil I
[1:00:23] double deer
[1:00:24] Spirit to try to stand in his presence
[1:00:28] they cannot
[1:00:30] you may be seated
[1:00:33] Oh Glory
[1:00:37] [Applause]
[1:00:39] so the baby is considering the womb and
[1:00:42] then the pastor added
[1:00:44] the baby grows up in the womb
[1:00:49] amen matures
[1:00:51] and girls
[1:00:53] onto a child that's fully formed
[1:00:56] and then the child is born
[1:01:00] conception and the child there's a space
[1:01:03] and that same principle carries on even
[1:01:06] when the child is born the child is
[1:01:08] still growing
[1:01:09] amen Medical Science says when the child
[1:01:13] is born all his parts are not fully
[1:01:15] developed yet
[1:01:16] African Northern medical school stuff
[1:01:18] but I still remember that they don't see
[1:01:21] too well yet clearly yet
[1:01:23] who are some parts of their bodies they
[1:01:25] start learning the environment trying to
[1:01:27] get some awareness as early as six hours
[1:01:30] after they are born
[1:01:34] but some parts of them are not fully
[1:01:35] from yet like you know
[1:01:38] the eyes are not fully formed yet
[1:01:41] that this training them Uncle bones not
[1:01:45] fully furnished so they can walk here
[1:01:46] and so many things like that and they
[1:01:48] grow and grow and grow and grow and grow
[1:01:50] and become like I already said from a
[1:01:53] from an infant to a toddler to a child
[1:01:56] and then to an adult so even after the
[1:01:58] child is born it still goes through the
[1:02:00] process of growth a process of God
[1:02:02] that's a span of time to where the child
[1:02:04] matures amen into adulthood and sonship
[1:02:07] that you can trust with some
[1:02:10] responsibility
[1:02:11] you won't keep your little baby with a
[1:02:13] two-year-old brother because he is not a
[1:02:16] son yet that you can be given
[1:02:18] responsibility that can be given
[1:02:21] responsibility no it's not yet so the
[1:02:25] child matures until he gets to a spot
[1:02:27] and a place in town where it can be
[1:02:29] given some restaurants but that's when
[1:02:30] you can say in the natural
[1:02:33] my shop my my child that's brought to me
[1:02:35] has become a son I've been given a song
[1:02:39] that I can give some responsibility to
[1:02:41] oh Hallelujah say Amen somebody
[1:02:45] amen amen
[1:02:47] I'm the same way
[1:02:50] the breath of
[1:02:52] wow
[1:02:55] is it
[1:03:07] all right God bless you
[1:03:09] I'm sorry
[1:03:10] um
[1:03:12] so um so I said I was giving you a few
[1:03:14] examples even the birth of our Lord
[1:03:17] Jesus was on this wise a child and a son
[1:03:20] and same look one
[1:03:22] um um I don't let me get it let me get
[1:03:26] it so I will make it uh pulling to you
[1:03:29] because people say that after you say
[1:03:32] brother Panama
[1:03:34] brought us back to this Bible so we
[1:03:36] should not forget about the message and
[1:03:38] I'll read some books anymore and go in
[1:03:40] the Bible
[1:03:41] I don't even worry with people like that
[1:03:43] they just they just they just don't
[1:03:45] believe I mean what what would you
[1:03:47] bother with with that
[1:03:48] unbelief doesn't hinder God it only
[1:03:51] hinders the unbeliever but if you
[1:03:54] understand there's no dichotomy between
[1:03:56] brother benham's words and the
[1:03:57] scriptures because brother Venom shine
[1:03:59] light on the scriptures because the four
[1:04:02] beasts said come and see
[1:04:05] shun some light on the scriptures
[1:04:10] amen
[1:04:11] [Applause]
[1:04:13] all right let let's focus on ourselves
[1:04:16] let's leave those guys alone all right
[1:04:19] all right send Luke chapter one
[1:04:22] the breath of Jesus Christ was on these
[1:04:25] wise
[1:04:28] all right
[1:04:32] um
[1:04:33] verse 26.
[1:04:35] and in the sixth month
[1:04:37] the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
[1:04:41] a city of Galilee
[1:04:43] amen Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a
[1:04:47] man whose name was Joseph of the House
[1:04:50] of David and the virgin's name was Mary
[1:04:53] and the angel came in unto her
[1:04:57] and said
[1:04:59] thou that thou that at highly favored
[1:05:03] the Lord is
[1:05:05] with thee blessed are among women and
[1:05:09] the angel from God called the prophet of
[1:05:12] Malachi for the seven angels to the
[1:05:15] church ages has come to us with the word
[1:05:18] of the Living God and all of the same
[1:05:19] world president thou Pride among the
[1:05:22] bride there has been bribes Brides
[1:05:24] churches churches Brides bride but
[1:05:25] there's coming one The Pride that's
[1:05:28] gonna bring them the resurrection and
[1:05:30] the Rapture of the going home
[1:05:31] [Applause]
[1:05:33] among women you are highly favored amen
[1:05:38] amen amen and
[1:05:42] and and uh verse 29 and when she saw him
[1:05:46] she was troubled at his sin and casting
[1:05:50] her mind what manner of salutation this
[1:05:52] should be
[1:06:13] all right
[1:06:16] okay
[1:06:17] um
[1:06:18] okay and the angel students were a fan
[1:06:20] of Mary
[1:06:21] for that has found favor with God and
[1:06:23] behold Here original here it is now and
[1:06:26] behold thou shall concede in thy womb
[1:06:31] why is that conception coming from I
[1:06:33] already told you Medical Science the way
[1:06:36] you and I were born mother's egg that is
[1:06:40] egg mother's egg and we were conceived
[1:06:42] in the womb and that's where our life
[1:06:45] started from
[1:06:46] but Jesus Christ was not conceived that
[1:06:49] way because he was too he was told his
[1:06:52] conception was totally Immaculate
[1:06:54] totally God had nothing of man at all
[1:06:59] many people think God's spirit anointed
[1:07:03] the egg in Mary no no Mary's egg had
[1:07:07] nothing to do with this
[1:07:10] he was fully God
[1:07:12] [Applause]
[1:07:14] it wasn't the mixture of Mary's egg and
[1:07:17] God's spirit no this conception was
[1:07:20] totally God
[1:07:21] God's spirit the seed the Gin the
[1:07:24] theophany of God come into Mary's womb
[1:07:30] and the Word was made flesh and dwell
[1:07:33] among us but that word came first into
[1:07:35] Mary's womb as a conception you may be
[1:07:39] seated
[1:07:45] [Applause]
[1:07:47] so number one Thou shalt conceive in thy
[1:07:51] womb God's spirit come in there
[1:07:55] and then after that you bring for the
[1:07:58] Sun
[1:08:01] and shall call his name Jesus
[1:08:04] he shall be great what what qualities it
[1:08:08] shall be great and shall be called the
[1:08:11] son of the highest the Son of God he's
[1:08:14] talking about sonship here
[1:08:16] shall be called the son of the highest
[1:08:19] and the Lord God shall give unto him the
[1:08:23] Throne of his father David and he shall
[1:08:26] reign over their house
[1:08:28] of Jacob forever and of his kingdom
[1:08:31] there shall be no end shouting like
[1:08:34] Isaiah 9 6 amen
[1:08:40] then sent Mary unto the angel here's
[1:08:43] what I'm what I'm telling you
[1:08:45] how shall this be sin I know not a man
[1:08:52] and the angels sued for the light on how
[1:08:55] this son is going to be born
[1:08:58] how this conception is going to become a
[1:09:00] song that's going to sit upon the throne
[1:09:02] of David and have all of this quality
[1:09:04] and greatness and and power and Glory
[1:09:09] the angel answered and said unto her the
[1:09:12] Holy Ghost
[1:09:15] shall come upon thee and overshadow thee
[1:09:21] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[1:09:24] and the power of the highest
[1:09:27] shall overshadow thee
[1:09:29] therefore shall overshadow thee some
[1:09:33] Shadow means there's some light there
[1:09:36] when lightning meets our flesh which is
[1:09:38] all Darkness it casts a shadow for the
[1:09:41] problem explained so the latter gospels
[1:09:44] so over shall so come upon you Mary amen
[1:09:47] and overshadow you amen amen so watch
[1:09:51] the order Holy Ghost shall come upon you
[1:09:53] with the power of the highest
[1:09:56] and overshadow you totally take you over
[1:10:00] therefore also that Holy thing we shall
[1:10:04] be born of thee shall be called the son
[1:10:08] of God
[1:10:09] amen
[1:10:11] Hallelujah the Son of God oh very
[1:10:15] important words there amen the oppressed
[1:10:18] but with this child turns to the Son of
[1:10:22] God oh hallelujah amen so the angel
[1:10:27] explained to Maryville and Mary Shaw an
[1:10:31] understood how this child is going to be
[1:10:34] pronounced that's what we you and I need
[1:10:35] to understand in this age here there's a
[1:10:38] process amen from the scriptures how the
[1:10:43] Son of God will be born
[1:10:46] up
[1:10:47] when I was in Pentecost one of the most
[1:10:49] popular
[1:10:51] um topics for ministers to preaching
[1:10:54] when they have a power conference is the
[1:10:56] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:10:59] and they just tell you about faith and
[1:11:01] all that but there's a process to it
[1:11:04] just like in the natural so it is in the
[1:11:06] spiritual and the angel told Mary
[1:11:09] the process to it
[1:11:11] in other words
[1:11:13] the process to form the Son of God is by
[1:11:18] the Holy Ghost
[1:11:20] overshadowing the seed of God in Mary
[1:11:24] amen
[1:11:25] the seed then grows a man amen to the
[1:11:31] son of God
[1:11:34] you see it grows and grows and grows and
[1:11:36] grows from glory to glory to produce the
[1:11:39] Son of God simple process but the spirit
[1:11:42] of God
[1:11:44] that's why you
[1:11:49] are you and all the way you can become a
[1:11:50] son of Son of God
[1:11:52] you are a child of God about to become a
[1:11:54] son that can be given Authority given
[1:11:57] sonship you need the power of the Holy
[1:12:01] oh Hallelujah
[1:12:04] in other words it takes the power of the
[1:12:06] Holy Ghost upon the sea to produce the
[1:12:10] son of God
[1:12:11] like Saint John 1 and for us to have
[1:12:13] already told us receive to them that
[1:12:16] received him
[1:12:18] receive him first
[1:12:20] amen and then power is given to become a
[1:12:25] Son of God power is given
[1:12:31] sons are given oh Hallelujah so he
[1:12:35] checks the power of the spirit of God to
[1:12:38] be given sonship it takes the power of
[1:12:41] the spirit of God to come into your
[1:12:43] sonship inheritance
[1:12:45] amen it takes the power of the holy
[1:12:48] spirit of God and time holy ghost power
[1:12:51] unveil and revealed by the Seven Seals
[1:12:54] of redemption oh my
[1:12:57] amen acts one age Jesus told them you
[1:13:02] shall but you shall receive power before
[1:13:04] you go to the Lord you shall receive
[1:13:05] power after the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:13:08] you
[1:13:09] then you'll be my Witnesses you'll
[1:13:12] represent me you speak it will be like
[1:13:14] me speaking after after
[1:13:17] the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:13:20] oh Hallelujah so Jesus told them to
[1:13:24] tarry in the city of Jerusalem I want
[1:13:26] you to be endured with power from on
[1:13:29] high it was for this same reason that he
[1:13:32] told them that because he had spent
[1:13:34] three and a half years showing the seat
[1:13:37] of the world in their souls and the seed
[1:13:40] of the world was a conception of God in
[1:13:44] this world
[1:13:52] like you and I today they were fisting
[1:13:55] on the unfailing Bodywork of the son of
[1:13:59] man Jesus Christ himself
[1:14:01] Hallelujah the unfailing body world
[1:14:04] Hallelujah
[1:14:07] the unfailing body what he cannot tell
[1:14:10] it cannot fail can you say Amen believe
[1:14:14] us though this
[1:14:16] it cannot fail Hallelujah
[1:14:20] up
[1:14:21] here
[1:14:24] so Jesus for three and a half years what
[1:14:28] on top of water on top of water on top
[1:14:30] of a world into their souls to from the
[1:14:33] seat of the world on the inside of them
[1:14:37] sure there were seeds of God but they
[1:14:40] are to identify their own day and age by
[1:14:42] receiving the seed of God from the
[1:14:45] messenger of their age like one of the
[1:14:47] brothers said
[1:14:49] you believe in God believe also in me
[1:14:52] people said they believe God you got to
[1:14:55] believe his messenger believe God
[1:14:57] believe His prophets you believe in God
[1:15:00] believe also in me Jesus said you
[1:15:03] believe in God believe also in the
[1:15:04] prophet Malachi fall
[1:15:09] no we're not worshiping a man I'm
[1:15:12] pulling the scriptures to you from the
[1:15:14] man Christ Jesus from the man Christ
[1:15:16] Jesus who was fully God and fully man
[1:15:23] [Applause]
[1:15:28] so Jesus breathed upon them the promise
[1:15:31] of the Holy Ghost amen acts 1 8 what for
[1:15:35] you may be seated to create sons of God
[1:15:39] Amen to write a book of Acts behind them
[1:15:43] oh my same way this age here
[1:15:49] amen amen has breathed upon us the
[1:15:53] promise of the Dynamics that's why
[1:15:56] mechanics the power of God in this end
[1:15:58] time Church the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:02] to take awesome to the Rapture of the
[1:16:04] Skies the power of the Holy Ghost shall
[1:16:06] come upon You Like It Came Upon the
[1:16:08] early brother panickers wrought for to
[1:16:11] create again
[1:16:12] sons of God in this last day to write
[1:16:16] another book of Acts amen like the
[1:16:19] Battle of Pentecost teach they wrote the
[1:16:21] book of God behind them and we are going
[1:16:23] to write another book of Acts
[1:16:25] today this is a
[1:16:27] amen whether you believe or you don't
[1:16:29] believe it doesn't matter God is going
[1:16:31] to do his work
[1:16:32] whether it's gonna happen or not that's
[1:16:34] not the point your job is to make sure
[1:16:37] you are part of it my job is to make
[1:16:39] sure I'm part of it Hallelujah
[1:16:44] there's gonna be a bride Hallelujah you
[1:16:48] may be seated oh Hallelujah
[1:16:52] Malachi 4 has given us the promise of a
[1:16:55] Dynamics to our mechanics
[1:17:12] the Pentecostals had them what about our
[1:17:15] day
[1:17:16] this church should be fully grown with a
[1:17:19] manifestation of every Divine promise
[1:17:22] that he promised to be in this pride and
[1:17:26] be worshiped in this great church of age
[1:17:28] all the Dynamics of our mechanics Amen
[1:17:32] to create again sons of God that will
[1:17:35] run another book of Acts like the Battle
[1:17:37] of Pentecost wrote a book of Acts behind
[1:17:39] them oh my and then we shall go all the
[1:17:44] way back to Eden where the original Son
[1:17:47] of God Adam was created through the same
[1:17:50] process you may be seated
[1:17:55] foreign
[1:17:57] [Applause]
[1:18:03] that's why this this bride here
[1:18:07] is President will be greater than the
[1:18:10] better Pentacles because the better
[1:18:12] Pentecost got to a spiritual Eden
[1:18:16] but we are going back to a spiritual
[1:18:18] Eden
[1:18:19] as well as a physical Eden and there
[1:18:23] without us cannot get you there physical
[1:18:25] even so they are waiting and resting and
[1:18:28] waiting on us
[1:18:30] that's why this bread is greater that's
[1:18:32] why there was never a gentile Prophet
[1:18:34] like Malachi 4. amen send me the message
[1:18:38] to normally prepare a prayer for the
[1:18:40] Rapture but to bring on a race God
[1:18:43] Garden of Eden on the face of the earth

[1:19:01] shall stay with the lamb and a little
[1:19:04] child shall live there
[1:19:07] try try to make that right to make the
[1:19:11] rapture
[1:19:14] Hallelujah
[1:19:15] you may be seated
[1:19:17] oh brother we have gone all the way back
[1:19:20] to Eden we are going back to where our

[1:20:24] Glory
[1:20:25] [Applause]
[1:20:29] Oh Glory so friends we are going back to
[1:20:32] Eden
[1:20:33] to where
[1:20:34] the original Son of God on the face of
[1:20:38] the Earth Adam was created through the
[1:20:41] same process Adam was the original Son
[1:20:44] of God on the face of the Earth Jesus
[1:20:46] was the original Son of God the Lord
[1:20:48] before the foundation of the world but
[1:20:51] on the face of the Earth Adam was the
[1:20:54] original I created Son of God let us
[1:20:56] make man in our image after our likeness
[1:20:59] amen and Adam the original Son of God
[1:21:02] demonstrated
[1:21:04] the power of give
[1:21:07] a gay son has been given some amen
[1:21:10] given the inheritance amen and the and
[1:21:15] the power of the spirit of God was
[1:21:18] evidently accidentally evident in his
[1:21:21] life
[1:21:22] Adam
[1:21:24] was given sonship and in there he
[1:21:28] exercised Dominion Supreme control over
[1:21:31] the Earth over the domain of the Earth
[1:21:34] and he lived and walked in a world of No
[1:21:37] Limits
[1:21:38] all things are possible there was not a
[1:21:41] doubt nowhere in his soul
[1:21:44] amen
[1:21:45] we have failure was not an option he
[1:21:50] lived a war where charity never fail
[1:21:54] [Applause]
[1:21:56] Hallelujah
[1:21:58] oh Hallelujah glory to God
[1:22:02] so how did Adam
[1:22:05] are the part of the spirit from Adam
[1:22:08] into a son of God
[1:22:11] by two-step process
[1:22:14] Genesis 1 26-28
[1:22:17] the spirit of God so let us make man in
[1:22:20] our image
[1:22:21] a spirit that has no certain form so it
[1:22:24] can have an image to have an image
[1:22:26] there's going to be some setting form so
[1:22:28] brother says so the sweet Elohim started
[1:22:31] to form toward flesh his his goal was to
[1:22:35] make a mind his image but firstly he
[1:22:38] needed to have a representation to where
[1:22:40] he can now make an image of
[1:22:42] saw him form himself into a body like
[1:22:45] not a body like this body but a
[1:22:48] supernatural
[1:22:49] Spirit body called the theophany the
[1:22:53] word
[1:22:55] that had informed that he can now make a
[1:22:59] Man In His Image so Elohim poured into
[1:23:02] the Lord of us and then could make an
[1:23:05] image of the Lord was quoted an image of
[1:23:07] the world and that's where you have it
[1:23:09] the word image the image of the world
[1:23:13] that's what Adam was what image so
[1:23:17] Genesis 1 26-28 was the falling of the
[1:23:21] one image
[1:23:23] all right
[1:23:28] and the word image is not work it's
[1:23:30] spiritually is not it's not a word it's
[1:23:33] a what body but it's also spirit
[1:23:38] so the word image is Spirit Genesis 1 28
[1:23:43] is Spirit
[1:23:46] but the word is the seed that the spirit
[1:23:50] comes upon the seed of God that Adam was
[1:23:55] the spirit of God pulled out of that
[1:23:58] seed the seven spirits of God the spirit
[1:24:02] of God from the back of the Bible from
[1:24:05] the back parts of God's mind to form
[1:24:08] Adam into an image
[1:24:11] like God
[1:24:13] amen the water image amen and then
[1:24:18] that was the word image was the one that
[1:24:21] God spoke to to be fruitful multiply it
[1:24:24] demonstrated and that's what the plan
[1:24:26] said Adam even though in the spirit like
[1:24:30] the Holy Spirit leads us today he left
[1:24:32] those animals through the Garden of Eden
[1:24:34] even though there was no flesh man Adam
[1:24:36] yet but the one image was not in flesh
[1:24:39] yet in other words but the spirit of God
[1:24:42] had formed Adam into an image like God
[1:24:46] himself
[1:24:47] but then
[1:24:49] the goal is to make man in the flesh
[1:24:53] and so Genesis 2 7. God took that what
[1:24:57] he makes spirit for the image I'm
[1:24:59] placing into flesh in other words he
[1:25:02] anointed that or image Spirit into the
[1:25:05] Flesh of man Adam became the word made
[1:25:10] flesh
[1:25:11] Hallelujah he became a son he was given
[1:25:14] sonship the word with flesh Adam had now
[1:25:18] had hands her legs had feet to walk not
[1:25:21] to speak and betray the Earth like the
[1:25:25] Son of God that he was he was given
[1:25:28] sonship an authority to rule on the face
[1:25:31] of Israel but the power of a spirit of
[1:25:35] the Living God
[1:25:36] oh Hallelujah
[1:25:39] [Applause]
[1:25:43] the spirit of God the spirit of God
[1:25:46] United with the Flesh of man to make a
[1:25:51] song
[1:25:52] given
[1:25:54] his son that was given Authority and
[1:25:56] dominion and Power on the face of the
[1:25:58] Earth
[1:25:59] oh Hallelujah
[1:26:02] and that represented Genesis 2 7.
[1:26:05] representative Adam's adoption time
[1:26:08] represented sonship inheritance given to
[1:26:12] Adam to rule and reign
[1:26:15] over all the jurisdiction of the earth
[1:26:18] oh my
[1:26:20] god let's run here
[1:26:22] then the fall came and the word image
[1:26:25] got infer from the glory of God the word
[1:26:27] image was what is the glory of God the
[1:26:29] theophany
[1:26:31] was the glory of God signs wonders
[1:26:33] miracles was the glory of God Genesis 1
[1:26:35] 26-8 Jesus said father glorify thou me
[1:26:39] with the glory that I shared with you
[1:26:42] before the definition of the world and
[1:26:44] this Glory I have given unto them the
[1:26:47] glory of God failed in the water image
[1:26:50] will in the world
[1:26:52] the water image of Jesus Christ
[1:26:55] oh my
[1:26:57] God because the devil came at the fall
[1:26:59] to attack
[1:27:00] that one image because that's what was
[1:27:02] happening that flesh into their flesh
[1:27:04] and I'm attacking the word image it was
[1:27:07] all in God's plans
[1:27:08] attacking that what image
[1:27:11] became reduced again to a little seed a
[1:27:14] little bottom and that's how we come
[1:27:16] here the seed of God in us we don't come
[1:27:19] like Adam no more
[1:27:21] fully formed statue of a perfect man we
[1:27:25] come as a little seed tucked in the very
[1:27:28] sockets of our soul but the spirit of
[1:27:30] God shall overshadow thee Mary and walk
[1:27:32] on that sea and act of that she will
[1:27:35] pull out the spirit of God the image of
[1:27:39] God put it out of your seed all you need
[1:27:42] is in the seed of God on the inside of
[1:27:44] you we just come as ministers and and
[1:27:47] preachers to pour it back into you to
[1:27:50] advance your promises to you so you know
[1:27:52] your day your season your time and your
[1:27:55] hour so you can Dash into the blessings
[1:27:58] of almighty God hallelujah
[1:28:02] all right
[1:28:04] [Applause]
[1:28:07] so when Adam fell
[1:28:09] the water he made became a little
[1:28:11] in Adam
[1:28:12] and in his seat
[1:28:14] after him since the fall that's you and
[1:28:16] I we come here with a little sheet of
[1:28:20] God in us but that's enough
[1:28:22] amen
[1:28:24] the story of redemption has been God
[1:28:26] looking for a road to bring sons of God
[1:28:30] back to that spot again to where they
[1:28:33] can be given sonship
[1:28:35] Amen to be given sonship inheritance as
[1:28:40] sons of the Living God for this end time
[1:28:42] here and the prophet Malachi for a
[1:28:45] prophet like like unto Elijah a prophet
[1:28:48] like unto Moses the great larger prophet
[1:28:51] of Malachi 4. amen how we thank God that
[1:28:56] a prophet has indeed come to know this
[1:28:58] year and has called us out in this last
[1:29:02] closing days of time

[1:29:07] bring back sons of God again

[1:29:15] call up the resurrection bring on the
[1:29:18] Rapture coin the Rapture of these guys
[1:29:19] and come back on the face of the Earth

[1:29:24] the nations with the word of iron on
[1:29:25] that white Throne amen and quench every
[1:29:29] rebellion of all the devil and his
[1:29:32] subjects that he goes to again and that
[1:29:35] was one judgment to instigate them to
[1:29:38] fight against the Judgment of God you
[1:29:42] can fight against the Judgment of God
[1:29:43] and God will come you and I on the
[1:29:46] breath of the earth while he deals with
[1:29:48] them and he will send them into the lake
[1:29:51] that bonds with fire and brimstone where
[1:29:54] hell itself is in oh Hallelujah
[1:29:57] Hallelujah for we shall bring on a
[1:30:01] physical restored Garden of Eden on the
[1:30:04] face of the earth a spiritual Eden has
[1:30:07] already begun first started in Malachi 4
[1:30:09] and that's going on right now but we are
[1:30:12] precinated to bring on a physical Garden
[1:30:15] of Eden
[1:30:17] she's on the other side of the Rapture
[1:30:18] on the other side of the rapture
[1:30:21] [Applause]
[1:30:23] we're charity
[1:30:25] never failures
[1:30:29] you may be seated
[1:30:31] [Applause]
[1:30:40] so Malachi Frozen with a message
[1:30:43] to bring back sons of God
[1:30:45] will be given sonship
[1:30:48] will be given sonship inheritance amen
[1:30:54] by the Dynamics
[1:30:56] which is the promise of the outpouring
[1:30:58] of the power of the Holy Ghost to create
[1:31:01] the bride you and I into Sons and
[1:31:04] Daughters of God like they had on the
[1:31:07] day of Pentacles to take us back to a
[1:31:09] spiritual Garden of Eden but beyond that
[1:31:12] to take us into the Rapture in the sky
[1:31:15] shouting on the inside of you the view
[1:31:17] that's gonna have Rapture in power
[1:31:19] that's gonna take you up in the skies
[1:31:21] Pizza did not have that Paul did not
[1:31:24] have that but Malachi 4. he came with a
[1:31:26] message
[1:31:27] beyond beyond the seven age particular
[1:31:31] Rapture in the skies
[1:31:33] and I believe
[1:31:35] tell these seven age
[1:31:37] man that's coming
[1:31:39] seven mysterious Thunders and they will
[1:31:41] reveal surprise Faith to go in the
[1:31:44] Rapture in the sky
[1:31:53] we're going out of here
[1:31:59] you may be seated
[1:32:01] oh Hallelujah so quickly like 10-15
[1:32:06] minutes now close out amen quickly
[1:32:09] malaka remember
[1:32:13] amen with a message to call us out
[1:32:16] and after we are called out that's the
[1:32:19] problem that's why many people and we
[1:32:22] preachers are the ones to blame in my
[1:32:24] opinion for all of that because some of
[1:32:26] these guys just going around attacking
[1:32:28] brother Branham here and there I always
[1:32:30] say they are wise
[1:32:32] they're very wise because they wanted to
[1:32:34] make sure brother was gone for 50 some
[1:32:37] years before they sell original
[1:32:39] challenging everything challenge the
[1:32:41] clouds challenge these Miracles and
[1:32:43] telling all that stuff
[1:32:45] they're very wise
[1:32:46] [Applause]
[1:32:47] because they know this but the bam I
[1:32:50] just wake up I'm not saying you wake up
[1:32:52] until the resurrection but they you know
[1:32:54] people believe that I'm coming coming
[1:32:55] back and all that they feel like maybe
[1:32:57] he might wake up and and find out all
[1:33:00] these lies they are speaking against him
[1:33:03] brother in the world the Tommy osbornes
[1:33:07] they're all robots all of them were
[1:33:08] there tell me what
[1:33:11] you want that Vision ever failed one
[1:33:13] time
[1:33:14] and all these Rascals all these Rascals
[1:33:18] who need a full dose of the Cross have
[1:33:21] the gumption how they take marriage how
[1:33:24] they how they are
[1:33:26] how the gall the nerve to telling the
[1:33:30] prophet of God
[1:33:33] [Applause]
[1:33:38] but too late too late too late a prophet
[1:33:43] has been in the land
[1:33:45] this is Malachi for land
[1:33:48] I don't know about you but I heard the
[1:33:50] voice of God she talking through a
[1:33:53] prophet that was God very God fell in
[1:33:56] William Branham speaking for saith the
[1:33:59] Lord first say of the Lord
[1:34:03] and unbelief does not hinder God it only
[1:34:07] hinders the unbeliever
[1:34:16] according to that world
[1:34:21] hallelujah amen
[1:34:27] [Applause]
[1:34:34] look at your friends you ever see that
[1:34:35] it's very simple it's a very simple
[1:34:38] process
[1:34:41] God is not complicated
[1:34:43] we over complicate the simple
[1:34:47] very simple
[1:34:50] let me see that
[1:34:57] what didn't Jesus say my yoke is what
[1:35:01] easy my body is right it's not difficult
[1:35:04] the gospel young man young woman is not
[1:35:08] difficult no it's not
[1:35:11] life is hard tell that baby when it
[1:35:15] comes when you came out of your mother's
[1:35:16] womb your father is a totally different
[1:35:19] ballgame
[1:35:20] it's tough in the world there's no easy
[1:35:22] no free lunch in life
[1:35:25] Jesus said my yoke is if there's a yoke
[1:35:28] that's a yoke he won't deceive your body
[1:35:30] it's an easy yolk
[1:35:32] and my burden is light
[1:35:34] but the button of sin is heavy
[1:35:37] it crushes you but this button is light
[1:35:42] oh Hallelujah
[1:35:52] you may be seated
[1:35:55] so Malachi for call us out but that's
[1:35:58] where I find many people in the message
[1:36:00] get lost
[1:36:02] and forgive me I don't say that
[1:36:03] disrespectfully but just something I've
[1:36:05] noticed them through the years
[1:36:08] the people come in the message and you
[1:36:10] just hear
[1:36:12] ministers and Believers and you get a
[1:36:15] lot of young people I mean feel a color
[1:36:17] go in their hearts and we don't have
[1:36:19] enough ministers still yet we don't
[1:36:21] because Jesus said the Harvest is right
[1:36:24] onto Harvest but the laborers are few
[1:36:27] but with everything you have got to be a
[1:36:30] child they groom trained to be able to
[1:36:32] be given son as a minister as a as
[1:36:36] your responsibility to preach and God
[1:36:38] can trust his word with you so you will
[1:36:41] not use the appropriate for a bully
[1:36:43] pocket
[1:36:44] you and I will not use the property to
[1:36:46] settle all scores
[1:36:48] you and I will notice the prophet to
[1:36:50] create the essentials in the church you
[1:36:53] and I will not use the puppet to favor
[1:36:55] some and disable sound because Mary the
[1:36:58] bride has found favor with God
[1:37:03] there's no favor no unfavored all of us
[1:37:07] are found favor with God
[1:37:11] children
[1:37:21] all of us are from favor
[1:37:23] [Applause]
[1:37:24] and you may be seated
[1:37:36] my friends
[1:37:38] after you are called out we're corner
[1:37:40] from Pentacles
[1:37:42] only Penny consciously on the left side
[1:37:44] and the Hebrews legalistic speech on the
[1:37:48] right side called into the middle of the
[1:37:50] road the foot of the cross amen
[1:37:53] were called out into the bride
[1:37:57] just to hang around no just to preach
[1:38:00] Acts 2 38 that's probably but that's all
[1:38:02] there is to it and I see many people
[1:38:04] come out into the message and don't know
[1:38:06] what next to do maybe see that and I
[1:38:08] don't say that it's just not fully maybe
[1:38:09] she did
[1:38:12] but we're on a journey when we see that
[1:38:15] we are going to the promised land
[1:38:18] Israel came out of Egypt
[1:38:20] cross the Red Sea baptized in the boxing
[1:38:24] of Moses cause the rest of your
[1:38:25] Redemption baptized into the person of
[1:38:27] Malachi for about the Seven Seals right
[1:38:31] sea of redemption
[1:38:33] how many people lose their way
[1:38:35] like the mixed multitude like
[1:38:37] Pentecostals and that's why they Wonder
[1:38:39] for 40 years because they did not have
[1:38:42] the promised land in their view but
[1:38:44] Malachi 4 said we are going somewhere
[1:38:46] we're going to a promised land and so
[1:38:50] when we come out we're coming into our
[1:38:52] Wilderness life and what is that
[1:38:55] we come to be nourished to be tutored to
[1:38:58] be child trained amen for behavior for
[1:39:02] character formation amen that's the
[1:39:05] second thing I've only come out we find
[1:39:08] a church maybe see that
[1:39:13] when you come in the message find a
[1:39:16] church
[1:39:17] where the man of God is preaching the on
[1:39:22] fairly realities of the Living God Amen
[1:39:26] the unfailing body water of the sons
[1:39:28] man's message amen from Malachi first
[1:39:31] message of the Seven Seals and the Seven
[1:39:34] Founders and you stay in that church to
[1:39:37] be filled to be child trained to be too
[1:39:39] dark
[1:39:40] Oh Glory to God Amen for character
[1:39:44] formation
[1:39:45] amen before the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:49] amen for sonship is given because power
[1:39:54] without character is satanic

[1:40:12] middle of the road amen like I said many
[1:40:16] many don't know uh what's next how do
[1:40:19] they come out but what's next is you
