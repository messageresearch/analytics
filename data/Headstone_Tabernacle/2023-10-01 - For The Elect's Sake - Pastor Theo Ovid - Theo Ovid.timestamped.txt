[58:24] shall be shorten and if any man shall
[58:27] say unto you Lo here is Christ or there
[58:29] believe it not for there shall arise

[59:03] the firstborn of among many Brethren
[59:06] moreover whom he did
[59:09] predestinate them he also called and
[59:12] whom he called them he also Justified
[59:14] and whom he justified them he also
[59:16] glorified what shall we say then to
[59:19] these things if God be for us who can be
[59:22] against us he that spared not his own
[59:26] son but delivered him up for us all how
[59:30] shall he not with him also freely give
[59:33] us all things who shall lay anything to
[59:36] the charge of God's elect it is God that

[1:01:07] um so I'll be reading some scriptures if
[1:01:09] you could find it if you want to find in
[1:01:10] the Bible and uh this is from Ezekiel
[1:01:12] chapter
[1:01:15] 36 uh moreover this from verse 16 of
[1:01:17] Ezekiel 36 moreover the word of the Lord
[1:01:19] came unto me saying son of man when the
[1:01:22] house of Israel dwelt in their own land
[1:01:25] they defiled it by their own way and by
[1:01:27] their doings so sometimes your destiny
[1:01:31] have to do with the choices and decision
[1:01:32] you make the actions you take there are
[1:01:36] so many people blame others for where
[1:01:38] they are at and they have nobody else to
[1:01:40] blame but themselves let me say it again
[1:01:43] there are so many people blame others
[1:01:45] for where they at and they have no other
[1:01:46] person to blame but
[1:01:49] themselves this is God saying but they
[1:01:51] defiled it by their own way and by their
[1:01:54] d jins their way was before me as the
[1:01:57] uncleanness of a removed
[1:01:59] woman wherefore I poured my Fury upon
[1:02:04] them for the blood that they had shed
[1:02:06] upon the land for their Idols where it
[1:02:09] they had polluted it and I scattered
[1:02:11] them among the Heathen that they would
[1:02:13] disperse through the countries according
[1:02:15] to their way according to their doings I
[1:02:17] judged them and when they entered unto
[1:02:20] the Heathen whether they went they
[1:02:22] profane my holy name so he say you run
[1:02:24] out and when they go out the Heathen
[1:02:26] they still car with their foolishness
[1:02:27] they profound my Holy Name are you with
[1:02:31] me and they said to them these are the
[1:02:34] people of the Lord and are going out
[1:02:35] from his land the people busting them
[1:02:38] these are the people of the Lord I look
[1:02:40] they out of the land now but verse 21
[1:02:43] but I had pity for mine holy
[1:02:47] nameall which the house of Israel had
[1:02:50] profaned among the Heen wether they went
[1:02:53] therefore say unto the House of Israel
[1:02:55] thus sayeth the Lord God I do
[1:02:58] this I do not this for your sake
[1:03:02] amen oh House of Israel but for my Holy
[1:03:06] Name sake which you have profaned among
[1:03:09] the Heathen whether you went and I will
[1:03:12] sanctify my great name which was profane
[1:03:15] among the Heathen which you have
[1:03:17] profaned in the midst of them and the
[1:03:19] Heathen shall know that I am the Lord
[1:03:23] sayth the Lord God
[1:03:25] when I shall be Sanctified in you before
[1:03:29] their eyes the same people that was run
[1:03:32] out the same people when they own way
[1:03:34] and carry on he said I will be
[1:03:35] Sanctified in you before the Hidden Eye

[1:21:06] you want to want you want to turn to
[1:21:07] Romans 4 we're going to go into Romans 4
[1:21:09] a little bit and verse one what shall we
[1:21:11] say then that Abram our fathers
[1:21:13] pertained to the flesh had found for if
[1:21:15] Abram was justified by works he had we
[1:21:17] of the glory but not before God but what
[1:21:19] said the scripture Abraham believed God
[1:21:21] it was counted for him for ousness and
[1:21:23] to him that worketh is reward not record
[1:21:26] of Grace but of debt but to him that
[1:21:28] worketh not here we go but believeth on
[1:21:31] him that justify the
[1:21:34] ungodly his faith is counted for
[1:21:36] righteousness sir God has do what
[1:21:39] justify the
[1:21:40] ungodly Hallelujah even as David also
[1:21:43] described the blessedness of the man
[1:21:45] this is verse six unto whom God imputed
[1:21:47] righteousness without works without
[1:21:49] works saying blessed are they who in
[1:21:52] iniquities are forgiven and whose sins
[1:21:55] are covered remember what we said in the
[1:21:58] exaltation on Friday about the Publican
[1:22:00] and the Pharisee Pharisee went to pray
[1:22:02] both of them went to the house of God
[1:22:03] you know one went inside one was outside
[1:22:06] and the Pharisees said Lord I commit
[1:22:08] adulter forn I know fornicator know liar
[1:22:11] and whatnot I doing all my stuff and
[1:22:12] thing I righteous and what not I'm not
[1:22:14] even like that man outside
[1:22:16] there he's
[1:22:18] a a Publican a sinner man the man having
[1:22:22] head bow he said Lord help me have mercy
[1:22:26] upon me a sinner Jesus watching both
[1:22:29] praying hallu Jesus seeing both
[1:22:33] praying and Jesus said not me he said
[1:22:36] that man on the outside went
[1:22:39] away what say it out loud
[1:22:44] Justified that's as if he never did it
[1:22:46] in
[1:22:48] him do you realize his charges have been
[1:22:51] dropped but Lord have mercy upon me a
[1:22:54] sinner you realize God drop it as if he
[1:22:57] never did anything at all you realize
[1:22:59] that man leave there free without a
[1:23:01] Bible without sitting inside the church
[1:23:04] you realize he Ain get baptized in Jesus
[1:23:05] name and he free well give the Lord a
[1:23:08] shout you realize that Pharisee inside
[1:23:11] was not justified he's a sinner on the
[1:23:14] inside oh phes actor he acting you
[1:23:20] know bless that they whose iniquities
[1:23:23] are forgiven whose sins are covered
[1:23:26] blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
[1:23:28] not impute sin come at this blessedness
[1:23:31] then upon circumcision only or upon
[1:23:33] uncircumcision also for we see that
[1:23:35] Faith was recogn reckoned to Abraham for
[1:23:38] righteousness Faith was counted as
[1:23:41] righteousness all right how was it then
[1:23:44] reckoned when he was in circumcision or
[1:23:46] in uncircumcision not in circumcision
[1:23:48] but in uncircumcision and he received
[1:23:50] the sign of circumcision a seal of the
[1:23:54] righteousness of the faith which he had
[1:23:56] being
[1:23:57] uncircumcised so before he got the Holy
[1:23:59] Ghost he had a faith to pull down the
[1:24:02] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost confirmed the
[1:24:04] faith that was in him because the Bible
[1:24:05] say Abraham believed God not man abrah
[1:24:08] believed God not his flesh Abraham
[1:24:10] believed God not his wife Abraham
[1:24:12] believed God come on now come on get get
[1:24:14] preach back to me somebody do you see
[1:24:16] what what just said there he didn't
[1:24:18] believe his flesh he didn't believe his
[1:24:20] age he didn't believe his wife condition
[1:24:23] he didn't believe what the doctor said
[1:24:24] he believed
[1:24:27] God oh give the Lord some Praises who do
[1:24:31] you believe this
[1:24:34] morning some of you believe in you
[1:24:37] that's why you say Amen you believe in
[1:24:39] your doubts you believe in your fears
[1:24:41] you believe you're not going to make it
[1:24:42] you believe that that's why pride is
[1:24:44] such a terrible thing because pride has
[1:24:46] said is
[1:24:49] self-powered that's why money sometimes
[1:24:51] make people proud
[1:24:53] because they know others do have and
[1:24:54] they have and they get arrogant and
[1:24:56] proud and God has judged that after a
[1:24:58] while hallelujah what God looking for
[1:25:01] what kind of man and woman God looking
[1:25:02] for God looking for a man and woman that
[1:25:04] the more He blesses is the more humble
[1:25:06] he becomes tough to find that oh give
[1:25:09] the Lord some praise is tough thing to
[1:25:10] find it's a tough combination the more
[1:25:13] He blesses God pouring pouring pouring
[1:25:15] look at David they said my cup run it
[1:25:18] over surely goodness and mercy shall
[1:25:21] follow me all the days of my life th
[1:25:23] preparest a table for me in the presence
[1:25:25] of my enemies my cup run it over God
[1:25:27] want to pour it and let it run over or
[1:25:29] give the Lord some shouts inside this

[1:55:12] Glory are you ready I was a I was
[1:55:15] born in sin shape iniquity come to the
[1:55:17] world speaking lies born among Sinners
[1:55:19] father mother I whole family Sinners I
[1:55:21] was a Cocker bill but all of a sudden I
[1:55:23] become a wheat green how did that happen
[1:55:26] what is that election God before the
[1:55:30] foundation of the world elected that a
[1:55:33] was to become a grain of wheat now
[1:55:35] I know I'm a grain of wheat because I am
[1:55:39] saved how do I do it look back and see
[1:55:41] what he predestinated long time ago by
[1:55:44] for knowledge he seen that I would love
[1:55:46] him so he made appropriation to his own
[1:55:49] son and through him that I might become
[1:55:51] from a to a green of wheat now
[1:55:54] where am I at now I'm saved I'm walking
[1:55:57] in the grace of God what does
[1:55:58] predestination look to Destiny where
[1:56:00] will he take me to where am I going
[1:56:03] there you are according as he has chosen
[1:56:05] Us in him before the foundation of the
[1:56:07] world is Ephesians that he should be
[1:56:08] holy Without Blame before him in love
[1:56:10] having predestinated us unto adoption
[1:56:13] predestinated unto the adoption of
[1:56:15] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:56:18] according to the good pledge of his will
[1:56:19] what did he do he by for knowledge
[1:56:21] forsaw us knowing that he was a savior
[1:56:24] there was no Angels Elohim the
[1:56:26] self-existent one what and he was but in
[1:56:29] him was to be a savior what is he going
[1:56:31] to save there's nothing lost knowing
[1:56:34] that that he know that this great
[1:56:36] attribute in him would project something
[1:56:39] out yonder that he could save then when
[1:56:41] it did that by for knowledge he looked
[1:56:43] down he saw everyone that would accept
[1:56:46] it he saw it ahead who would accept it
[1:56:51] and then by doing so he said to save
[1:56:53] that and only way I can do that will
[1:56:56] come down myself and made flesh and take
[1:56:58] the sin of man upon him and die for him
[1:57:00] that I might be the one that's worship
[1:57:02] and he is God the object of worship
[1:57:04] isn't that right he becomes that lamb
[1:57:06] isn't that right so he saw the
[1:57:08] deceitfulness of Satan that what he
[1:57:10] would do so he put your name on there
[1:57:12] and he said that the Antichrist would be
[1:57:14] so religious so good such a fine fellow
[1:57:16] smart man righteous man that he would
[1:57:18] deceive the very elected if it was
[1:57:20] possible and it's impossible because
[1:57:22] their names were for ordained before the
[1:57:24] foundation of the
[1:57:26] world excuse me by election he chose
[1:57:29] them so you didn't just land in church

[2:24:27] and there's no baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:24:29] So based upon the word they have their
[2:24:30] own interpretation and they're running
[2:24:32] with that isn't that right praise God
[2:24:35] hallelujah there it is the days of the
[2:24:38] voice of the seventh angel when he begin
[2:24:40] to song The Mystery of God should be
[2:24:42] finished there it is he is sending a
[2:24:45] Vindicated Prophet he's sending a
[2:24:47] Prophet after 2,000 years he send
[2:24:49] someone so far from organization
[2:24:51] education world religion he will turn he
[2:24:54] will be God's mouthpiece and he will
[2:24:56] turn the hearts of the children back to
[2:24:57] the fathers he will bring the elect of
[2:25:00] the last day and they will hear a
[2:25:02] Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth
[2:25:05] as it was with Paul he will restore the
[2:25:07] truth as they had it and those elect
[2:25:09] with him oh glory to God those elect
[2:25:12] with him will be the ones who truly
[2:25:15] manifest the Lord and be his body and be
[2:25:18] his voice and perform his works there's
[2:25:22] a bunch of elected people that God has
[2:25:24] brought out with this Prophet messenger
[2:25:26] Oh Glory to God the church is no longer
[2:25:28] the mouthpiece of God it is his own
[2:25:30] mouthpiece so God is Turing on her in
[2:25:32] the message he will confound her through
[2:25:35] the prophet and the bride for the voice
[2:25:36] of God will be in heard for Revelation
[2:25:38] 17 says the spirit in the bride say come
[2:25:41] once more the world will hear direct
[2:25:43] from God as at Pentecost but of course
[2:25:45] that bride will be rep created as of the
[2:25:47] first age he has cried out in this age
[2:25:49] you have the word you have more Bible
[2:25:50] than ever but you are not doing anything
[2:25:52] about it except dividing and hackling
[2:25:54] into pieces taking what you want leaving
[2:25:56] on what you don't want you are not
[2:25:57] interested in living it but debating it
[2:26:00] I would soon had a hot or cold if you
[2:26:03] were C and rejected it I would stand for
[2:26:05] that I would stand that but if you could
[2:26:07] get white heart to know his truth and
[2:26:08] live it I'd praise you for that oh
[2:26:10] praise God God still have a voice for
[2:26:13] the people of the world even as he has
[2:26:15] given a voice to the bride the voice of
[2:26:18] God will be in the bride oh I'm almost
[2:26:20] closing in very PL language the True
[2:26:23] Body of Christ is in the mind of God
[2:26:25] eternally do not express until each come
[2:26:28] forth in his own designated decrete
[2:26:30] season each must come in what own
[2:26:33] designated season as each member come
[2:26:35] forth and become expressed and took his
[2:26:37] place in the body thus this bride is
[2:26:40] literal spoken word seed bride Oh Glory
[2:26:43] we did not come become seed by the
[2:26:45] rebirth we were seed and therefore we
[2:26:48] were reborn for only the elect can be
[2:26:51] reborn oh give the Lord some Praises
