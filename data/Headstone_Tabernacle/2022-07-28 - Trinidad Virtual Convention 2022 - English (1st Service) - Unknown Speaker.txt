this one body in a Victorious body body in a body that cannot fail hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen so but let me just take the take the second to to to to to to to give you these words and this greeting and it's the first time without our precious um pastor and brother Sigmar then I would I give this greeting to a to her to a convention worldwide and um sure he was a man that was influenced by the Holy Spirit he was a man that had surrendered his life to his word and his life spoke louder than words it was a life lift for the true Gospel of Jesus Christ and it became a light for many people a light here a little light here a little light here but it became a light because it was a life that was lived according to the word and this life that was lived according to the word became a light and we could see a light in our church church and we were happy for that and we are blessed for that to have that light Among Us amen praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you for all your prayers thank you for all your encouragement thank you for everything you have done for our church and for our family we truly appreciate it amen praise the Lord so today we are standing with my brother Johnny and the brethren in the church amen and we are focusing on the promise of God like Elisha did to the promise that Elijah has given him for a double portion for a double victory for this battle that we're gonna go out Victorious and we are focused and stay in line with that promise amen amen praise the Lord so the inspiration of the convention amen is preparing for the battle and there's many battle going on praise the Lord but there's one battle it's a battle between the darkness and the light that's that great battle that is going on now before the beginning we read in first John 1 5 this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all so in God there's no battle in God there is peace in God there's all victory in God there is no fear in God there is no enemy in God it's all over in God full satisfaction in God Perfection hallelujah praise the Lord and we are returning back to God we are coming from God and we are returning back to God hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Jesus amen and we go to the beginning and in Genesis 1 3 God said let there be light and there was life tired now a creation of light is coming forth and God saw that the light was good and God divided the light from the darkness so what happened at the beginning God made a law and to know this law is so important the law says Darkness cannot stay together with light there has to be a separation amen they cannot stay together it's a law of God so this law of God is still working and it's still in progress praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah and brother praying I mean a message question an answer on Hebrews chapter 3 says Darkness and Light cannot dwell together which is the most powerful brother brand name is asking the question what is more powerful the power of light or the power of darkness and he said it's the power it's the light and when the light shines forth the darkness has to flee Hallelujah in your life when the light shines forth in your life then the darkness it has to flee it's a law of Separation it's a law and Satan cannot interrupt that law it's a law of the king and when we yield ourselves to that light and say Shine On Me Lord Jesus Shine On Me father that light is gonna go in progress and darkness has to flee hallelujah praise the Lord I know the spirit of God is here I know he's movie where the spirit of God there is Liberty hallelujah praise the Lord amen praise the Lord my God has decided he has made a decision and he chose you and Peter picks it up and he said he has called you out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light and when he has called you into this Marvelous Light they know Darkness can be there no Darkness can stay where light is hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen and Paul writes to the Romans the night is far spend and the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light so God has given you a armor of light he has given you something to fight the darkness and he said Put it on put the armor of light on put an armor of Life on what is the armor of life it's a portion of that same great life it's a portion of that same great light hallelujah hallelujah and David picks it up in Psalm and he says for thou Wilt light my candle Lord Jesus you have given me the ability you have made me a candle baby it's not lit long maybe it's not lit strong but Lord let it stronger make it stronger put more fire on my candle let me light let my life Shine the gospel of this day Let It Shine Lord Jesus and you watch the darkness fleeing the darkness has to flee because God has set a law that Darkness cannot stay with slide amen amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord where's the great Light breaking force and brother Branham he picks it up in the denominatory Physical Realm he says the great light is breaking forth from the kingdom of God where's the kingdom of God brother and sister where's the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is within you Hallelujah and that's the place that the great light is breaking forth in your life around you in your family the great light is breaking for us how will it break for us we want the victory we want overcoming we want to see a resurrection we want to see a Rapture that's all talking about victories we want to see adoption that's a victory we want to see a life we want to see a Perfection that's a victory and we're gonna see the victory praise the Lord how it's gonna break it for us how is it going to break it for us and brother Branham says in there is a man that can turn on the light he said God separated Darkness from light all light from darkness and he separates death from life and he does it by his word hallelujah so simple if you have a question if there's Shady places in your life is there some Darkness around and you cannot get over it praise the Lord you go to the word because in the word it separates the light from the darkness Hallelujah that's the key it's his word amen and brother praying himself life comes only by the word of God made manifest so he says the life he said it comes when that word he said that word is dead it's written letters but it's it's dead but there's spirit and there's life in this word amen and when we take the word and we get it in the right channel then this word starts to become alive it starts to become a manifestation and then this word is becoming a light in your life hallelujah praise the Lord so we believe every word and as we believe it gets a Harmony the rain is coming down the rain is falling the rain is falling on the word it always follows the word and you start to believing and says thank you Lord Jesus thank you for the word you start to understand this word speaks about you this word speaks about the decision God has made for your life and a face is created and it starts to get in progress and it becomes alive and that life is the light and that light will cause the darkness to separate and to flee Hallelujah the darkness has to flee praise the Lord praise the Lord I'm coming to let me come to an end amen what does the word say about you today what does it say get your face connected with it first Thessalonians 5 5 Paul says you are the children of light you came in this world speaking lies shaped in econiquity speaking lies making sin brother but it looked all dark it looked all dark and Satan saw it all dark but one day the light of the Gospel it struck your seed and that little candle started to get light that candle started to burn and at that moment the battle was going on it was a battle because of a candle that was lit and Satan who wants to keep the darkness but praise be to God that light that is burning and this light is gonna build more and more and it's getting stronger and stronger and stronger because why the Bible says the word says ye are the children of light if you are the children of Light No Doubt Darkness has to go because you are the children of the light hallelujah praise the Lord and the Bible makes it not more clear we are not of denied and we are not of the darkness this puts all fear away this puts all doubt away this puts our Focus right to say Thank you Lord Jesus there's this Victory before me because you have called me to be a child of the lion amen praise the Lord the greatest battle between Darkness and Light a separation has been done at the beginning and Satan tried to mingle it up brother Branham says he says Satan tries to pervert he's tried to deform the word he's tried to deform the life to death he's tried to deform Health to sickness he's tried to deform it all but we are coming back to the life and to the light may God bless you as the convention goes on as the minister comes forward there's a final Victory the light's Gonna Shine once again it's Gonna Shine bright there is light in the evening time it's Gonna Shine all over this Earth Jesus is the light of the world and if he lives in US and if he's manifested we're gonna be the light of the world and his light is going

when it becomes a live battle praise be to God so we give God the glory and may God bless the entirety of the convention which will be virtual um uh this time around amen now we give God all the glory as we turn to my title and which comes from our prophet the hour of charge amen when you are uh it is a special moment when you have everything else is behind you and you are not thinking anymore you are fighting only the hour of charge are you ready by Junior amen may God bless our translators very much today and we want to start with these scriptures keep thy heart says Proverbs 24 23 sorry 2 4 23 keep thy heart with all diligence watch out what goes on here for out of it are the issues of life amen so be careful with this heart be careful what you let in and be careful what you don't let in because it's like a womb and you've got to be careful and watch that heart with all diligence Matthew 16 18. and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not Prevail against it Hallelujah amen Romans 10 10. for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation a Man 2 Corinthians 10 3. for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh Ephesians 6 12 finally for we rest so not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places in a word of prayer dear God we want to thank you for this hour we are living in a strange time Lord we look to the left and we are horrified we look to the right and Lord we are amazed Lord we realize it's time to go home new things are being revealed help us Lord to realize that you sent a prophet that we could hear these new things he said the Bible will become like a new book how we thank you for these things Lord Lord may you people be blessed locally and online and strengthen them in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen you can be seated Saints God bless you richly hour of charge amen because there's a great battle and when you uh when you think about it it's a a an atmosphere that we could all feel when an aircraft is coming into land at Heathrow and the pilot he reduces the the thrust the plane goes down then he turns to line up for landing and then he goes down lower then maybe there's a gust of wind you see the phone turbulence everybody in that plane feels it they don't say it they don't say the planes going down but they all feel it they know in their gut that something's changing and although we may not talk in our gut we know something's changing something is moving you every time you hear news something's changing it's time to go Church it's time to get out of here and I want to dedicate this message to our young people because they're fighting a big battle amen I give God thanks for such a relevant Adult class this morning he took my quote as well appreciate that brother Gerard and they're so meaningful we all know that the enemy is fighting we can feel things happening something in our heart tells us no no it's not like it was before it is changing and we give God the glory for the opportunity for this hour of charge amen and I I pray that this hour of preaching will be an hour of charge for you when you go down in prayer don't just go down like uh like a civilian go down for an hour of charge pray like you're charging the enemy praise be to God Amen may that be your hour of charge here in church [Music] when you go to your prayer room charge hey man let's talk about it in the world of uh martial arts when they strike somebody they don't do it quietly they scream with everything and there's a reason for that it's called a Kia and it has there's many reasons they do that but the main one to confuse the enemy to discourage the enemy he not only gets a fist on his nose but he said what's going on because you're screaming when I bid you to shout you shout amen will just confuse the enemy and the walls will come down Jericho had the hour of charge don't shout till I say Shout amen and that shout was just a in in time there's a little pictorial uh image of of an army and maybe think on these things deeply the great I hear it is the great hour of charge is at hand and not uh when you are being led and uh still small voice led by the dove that's great but there comes a time when it's not just follow follow charges when you are attacking you're not just learning but now you're attacking the enemy for yourself because you can see them you can see their eyes see their weapons and you are attacking them not being led the trumpet has sounded and now you're charging the great hour of charge is at hand you can feel it in your gut It's Time new things are being revealed Hallelujah soldier with armors gleaming color streaming every color of the rainbow red and orange and yellow and green and I'm talking a seven color S no not a six color talking seven color rainbow Covenant is on you color streaming faith and doubt setting themselves in a ray in the Tabernacle this morning my God doubt on one side I better not do this amen and faith on the other soldiers standard of poster Duty Hallelujah stand at your post of Duty praise be to God what can we say to these things when the hour of charge comes amen you don't stop you you attack until you kill and you just keep on cutting he says Don't Stop that's what uh that that the young girl did stopped and she went to the Disco and she got possessed by a demon young people don't stop the hour of charge keep cutting you make a mistake repent keep on fighting you say something wrong forgive me keep on fighting keep on cutting keep on going forward don't go back praise be to God

keep on cutting keep on chopping keep on praying keep on forgiving just keep on going go forward amen if you understand that can you shut a man praise the Lord now let's let's look at something amen you know Israel started out they charged out of Egypt bye-bye pharaoh they charged over the Red Sea and I played uh what a tambourine Miriam prayed the tambourine but now Israel started and I could say the same thing 2 million charged out of Egypt but it ended up with two men okay let's talk about it it was not in their heart it was just an emotion enthusiasm which is fine but it must be in your heart so when you charge it must be real there's no impersonation to the third floor two million and the two men two men they they saw the works they saw the manifestation of the spirit Mighty miracles done in Egypt but it wasn't in their hearts you bet you better guard your heart because out of it are the issues of life be real be truthful be transparent if you have to say stories say sorry if you have to say hallelujah say hallelujah hey man if you have to say I forgive you mean it I forgive you come from here he said but two men it wasn't in their heart they didn't overcome their battle they just came out but Redemption is in two parts out of in two but they just come out and Jesus said they perished in the wilderness and are eternally dead when you charge out of Egypt make sure you charge into the Promised Land blessed be the name of the Lord you can start out make sure it's here make sure it's real you've got something to make right make it right and you can't be going by hope well we we're hoping to make the Promised Land God hope for the promised amen now Faith is Bully strong aggressive powerful how I like to think faith hope faith charity these three things what a beautiful thing hope is a little timid hope lovely and sweet but for this battle she's the greatest enemy whoa she's the greatest enemy that faith has that's right the greatest enemy that faith has got is Hope the hour of charge is here hey man brother when you believe charge you might be standing in your In Your House like Father Gerard said charge Satan get out of our house leave my shooting alone charge praise be to God something happens it's a it's radical charge you're not thinking you're running you're running at the enemy David charged that Goliath right through the Bible hey man the woman charged for Elijah it's all well all is well all is well all is well she was charging you God Amen you can't pretend to charge something takes over and you're charged it might happen to you when you get home it might happen tomorrow morning when you feel the charge charge but don't go in Hope well we hope to make it look Hope has its place but faith does not eat that need that enemy faith claims it now [Music] faith says God said so and it's mine that settles it that's it that's it hey man that settled it I don't care if I'm still crippled I don't care if I'm still blind or if I'm still sick that don't have nothing to do with it I believe it anyhow charge it's mine right now God said so that settles it that is faith can you see why hope is the enemy Faith doesn't hope it knows faith is the substance of things hopeful the evidence of Things Not Seen glory and with the heart man believes with the mouth confession is made that is faith praise be to God now when it comes to reality reality check your mind opens it up watch what goes on here because your mind is a womb don't just say well it doesn't matter it does matter some things you have to say no guard your heart some things you have to say yes yes or yes be yes and you'll know be no and then there's sometimes you have to say no to the postman I'm not receiving this you can take that package back Hallelujah we are not opening our heart to that package mine either accept oh it rejects it that's it friends in other words that is the battle that is your what you let in because what you let in will become you know when when the serpent faced Eve he didn't attack Eve the first thing he attacked it was the word that's God that's his first attack it's got to discredit that young people do not believe your weapon sorry disbelieve your weapon don't disbelieve it it is powerful the name of Jesus is powerful use it wherever you go it's more powerful than you praise God he says he says that your mind either accepts oh it Rejects that's it and they said that's it friends that is the greatest battle and try Satan is trying to make you accept the wrong thing as Eve did more on that just now God let none of them miss it see it's your mind that opens up the door tell that gossiper to get away if the Mind opens up the door oh hey man that's not a play play thing hey man thanks for the confirmation my God you better destroy your enemy praise be to God it either accept or not because in the Garden of Eden let's take it a bit deeper when you you knowing better by the word of God watch a very big words here by the Intercourse of the Mind very big words you take in a lie of the devil against the word of God that exactly what evening and with a spiritual intercourse our first that came by believing Satan's lie into the womb of her mind nothing physical not physical it was a spiritual her her spiritual virginity what's broken or her spiritual virtues was broken and the womb of her mind received a lie from The Serpent and he was very polite very courteous nice guy we better understand how Satan operates hey man it's not like like the cartoons okay he's a reality okay with a with a spiritual intercourse that come by believing Satan life into the womb of her mind okay that polluted her soul because this is the gateway to the soul watch it okay the gateway to the soul it set death in the soul so the the spiritual uh adultery took place spiritual virtue was broken and a spiritual mind received the seed then the natural Act s took place and the natural world and the natural virginity that all followed amen but the battle started here that is the chosen place be careful what you think be careful what you receive give us the word Say Amen if it's reasoning say no I reject that amen then the natural Act but watch what happened it was a spiritual what uh yeah spiritual intercourse first now this great contest has been going on for many years I need it is a poor Satan is trying young people to pull you into his prior and it's been going on for many years in fact it started in heaven Satan was kicked out but up there he had a contest and he pulled a certain percentage of the Angels with his uh tail with his life he was kicked out get out then he became an enemy to God's people down here says and since then he's used all his strengths and his strategy to pull God's people across the fires or into his fire using his tail his story to get you pulled but thank God he is the strength of those virtues Hallelujah he is our strength the Lord is my strength and you may get me but you won't get God in Me amen praise be to God young people be careful the prophet gave a story of a certain snake who was watching a bird and as long as the bird kept watching [Music] amen the snake had a power over that bird and the only way the bird was mesmerized it was hypnotized by the eyes of the snake the only way to escape was to break the contact and to look away look away to Jesus stop looking at that thing what's the name of that snake maybe Mr Netflix you're gonna you're gonna break the game break the Gaze Mr Hollywood you've got to break that game Look Away to Jesus praise be to God thank you Jesus get into the message get your eyes on Jesus Christ Hallelujah she is going to be liberated she's coming back and those two meet again they met once already but those two meet one another on the battlegrounds Lucifer and Michael again can we all Shout again they already met up there now they're gonna meet again so Lucifer has come down Michael is here the prophet said is Christ of course amen they said they've been bound for 2 000 years almost 2 000 years more than 2 000 years but now they're here we've been through Ephesus Simona pergamos Philadelphia 2 000 years now Michael is here and Lucifer's here and the battle is on another battle like it was up there and what you did up there you're gonna do down here hallelujah hallelujah some instinct will guide you and say no Satan this is the hour of charge those that know their joyful sound charge we will charge him again [Applause] God 2 000 years and now here comes Satan amen he has come down and and and Christ is here he's come down Hallelujah it is souls in prison amen but right at that time when he brings restoration to his bride so what happens to people so what's going on there is an excess pressure because say what something's going on you can feel it we're all looking nice but their life is hard how many times come on come on come on come on pressure pressure we're all guilty the prophet said he's guilty pressure pressure we can feel it the plane is moving we feel it in our gut something is wrong something is changing pressure is on you excess pressure and before I go any further let me say this I believe it's the enemy Lucifer coming down and pressing I believe it's the devil we can feel it in our guts something is changing something is happening and he says we as We Know the Lord is at hand and the Bible would go about like a roaring sorry that the devil would go around like a roaring lion and if he could get you under pressure running over something you will make decisions that you wouldn't make if you sat down and think it over or can I say stand still and see the salvation of the Lord let off the pressure go into some prayer have an hour of charge your battery amen hallelujah charge from your theology charge praise God if he could get you under pressure you need to let off the pressure amen let off the pressure let it all out you can't go around pressurize and blaming people yeah let off the pressure beep beep and there's no reason you know they're under pressure I should let off the pressure come to church and repent amen the pressure but you'll be under pressure see it's a nervous age [Music] what is it then I give this solemn morning to the church stand still foreign still God commands to stand still before he does anything stand still yeah shut up stand still lift your eyes to Jesus let off the pressure I'm gonna win this battle I've already won this battle I'm gonna win it again stand still amen churches is it a neurotic stage every Church is personalizing stealing sheep pulling flushing steering it's a neurotic age but stand still that's the message notice Caleb here all the people who are going crazy Caleb says shut up our God is able the Giants watch Caleb people that just come back amen they were spies there was at Kadesh banaya at Kadesh paneer you have to make decisions let off the pressure let off that pressure don't don't don't don't don't be fooled and you watch what the enemy does you go shopping somebody will punch you and steal your wallet it is the devil yeah so you come home and then you find that you forgot your key what is it the same devil but he changed horses so you have to take a walk down and some pretty girl hi what is it the same devil learn from the Seven Seals it's the same devil but he comes in different horses he will attack you with a thief he will attack you with a pretty girl then you get a phone call no it's the devil again it's a scam but he's changed horses he's not a horse of violence oh now he's on the horse of uh illusions you know he changes horses so don't think that heaven is just this you change horses to suit whatever horse will bring you down he's riding that horse watch it this battle is very subtle and many are deceived and they went to Carriage party let's move along look when you come to Christ all your troubles begin when you come to Christ if up if you just come to Christ your troubles is finished come and join us we're all trouble free I tell you when you come to Christ they then begin when you put on a uniform and you take a gun and you enter the battlefield this Christian Road is not a flower bear of ease it is a battle from the very hour that you start until your spirit set free by Death you are not at a picnic you are on a Battleground Egypt and Palestine you have to fight and keep fighting and then fight more because you're on a Battlefield praise the Lord forever if if we live right it doesn't mean that we are immune from trouble I'm a I pray I won't have any trouble it means frankly reality check all troubles are directed your way he is too happy happy happy send some Troubles Down if I if he says he said many of the afflictions of the righteous but God delivereth him out of all of them [Music] out of all of them sorry amen praise God Amen he says I'm gonna jump anyway as long as the Dead levels can make you believe that the trials you go through is God punishing you it's not young people I don't care what you're going through God is Not punishing you he's trying to show you something trying to show you hey man he was not punishing job he was trying to joke to show himself and job realized amen and then he said I hate myself praise be to God I hate myself and then he began to deal with his all his accusers with the right attitude oh what can we say to these things God is Not punishing you God let that big bad shine hey man that little policeman there look at him he's got no power but every car stops it's not him that's powerful but he's got a badge let that big bad shine in the name of Jesus Christ let that big bad shine it ain't you I can't stop that devil you did nothing you prayed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let that bed shine Hallelujah that's the battle and the authority you have anything got your strength it wasn't about you you can't do nothing he said but look at him the little weak guy but let that bed shine let him raise up that hand he may not have the power but he's got the authority young people you may not have the power but you've got the authority then you hear the break squeak oh and run sideways because he's got Authority now watch I don't have power you don't have power but we've got Authority amen the badge of faith hanging on the word I believe it it's the truth that's what's up Glory that's what stops praise be to God what can we say that's what gives us boldness to walk in the face of demons and opposition because we know can you say I know I'm covered with the blood the blood of the Lord Jesus which is the Divine powers in the blood of Jesus what can we say to these things Hallelujah it gives us boldness hey oh you did that no I'm covered by the blood Hallelujah cover covered cupboard oh man what do we say to these things but watch unconfessed sins because you can pour oil on your head a gallon and uh you could Stomp and kick and snort whatever and run across the platform and scream and holler like the prophets of Baal he says the devil will stay there because he's got a right to a legal right to stay there but as long as as long as he's got the right to stay there he will hold his ground amen so be it assured unto you that that thing will hang right over you as long as you have unconfessing you you won't win any

what they call a no-sum game one loses and one wins so you've got to fight this battle with all that you can praise be to God amen he says now this uh revelation it exposes Satan he fights that you asking the message fights us because he cannot stand it he knows from this rock he knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for she can do the Greater Works hey man Hallelujah she will be an invincible Army charge yes Satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us we will

let's get something straight wisdom can you tell me the title anybody wisdom versus faith what a battle that is wisdom can we all say together wisdom has reasoning faith has no reason my that's probably powerful faith has no reasoning imagine Abraham what a situation he could have reasoned oh come on but faith has no reason he obeyed God and then he possessed the gates of his enemies because wisdom has reasoning faith has no reasoning you've got to watch for a reason is so easy you've got to say no and to say yes to Faith I believe that don't be uh I hope you've got to go further it's got to be in your heart faith has reason wisdom has reasoning of course he went to Genesis 3. when wisdom comes to you it will bring these vitamins vitamin P pleasure popularity that's in his wisdom he said it had vitamin C common sense huh it makes reason yeah at Vitamin r which meant reasoning be reasonable see yeah he could reason but that won't work vitamin B which is beauty you better paralyze
