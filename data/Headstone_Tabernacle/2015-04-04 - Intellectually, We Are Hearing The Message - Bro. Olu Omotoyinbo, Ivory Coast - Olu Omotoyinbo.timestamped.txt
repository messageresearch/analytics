[12:42] attention to a few of
[12:46] scripture
[12:48] joh
[12:50] 2 First
[12:53] Corinthians and Ephesians
[12:58] 4 you got to pray for me this
[13:01] morning because I came here to a
[13:04] coast to preach on the call to the
[13:09] resurrection but but hearing brother the
[13:12] over yesterday
[13:14] morning and remember Journey last
[13:17] night I began to have second
[13:20] thoughts because they spoke about
[13:23] things I've been speaking about in our
[13:25] church in recent times
[13:27] [Music]
[13:29] so I thought maybe the holy spirit will
[13:31] have
[13:32] me speak on a few things also this
[13:35] morning when
[13:37] Johnny was speaking last night about the
[13:40] emotions and I've been speaking a lot
[13:42] about that in Lagos in recent
[13:45] times about the emotions because brother
[13:49] bam said
[13:51] intellectually we hearing the word of
[13:54] God the
[13:56] message the message that God has given
[13:59] us and he L up for
[14:02] us and he said but we've got to lay in
[14:07] the Pres of the song to let it B
[14:10] down in other words intellectually
[14:14] hearing the
[14:15] word not
[14:17] enough amen so I thought I would just
[14:22] speak along the same lines this
[14:25] morning amen so this morning I to put a
[14:29] few notes
[14:32] together um on some loose shet
[14:37] here brother over you got to teach me
[14:39] I've been begging you you got to teach
[14:40] me how to use
[14:42] that that tablet thing to preach teach
[14:47] me so if you have your
[14:49] Bibles I'll just pray for me this
[14:52] morning I just I'm not preaching I'm
[14:54] just going to talk to
[14:56] you amen from my heart
[14:59] I like to do it that
[15:01] way John
[15:03] 21 this talking about Peter's
[15:08] denial you know many
[15:11] Christians brother brother preached one
[15:14] time
[15:15] message why do many
[15:19] Christians find it hard or
[15:22] difficult to live a Christian
[15:25] Life and he tried to show us because
[15:28] friends
[15:29] it's not about talking
[15:32] Mysteries it's not about believing the
[15:35] Mysteries it's about the Mysteries
[15:36] coming
[15:37] down from God as the word of God and
[15:42] your soul grabbing that word and that
[15:46] what mixing
[15:47] up with the elements of your
[15:50] life and
[15:52] outcomes a life like Jesus Christ
[15:56] because this is the age of personal life
[16:00] your own life cannot make
[16:02] it your father's life cannot make it
[16:05] your mother's life cannot make it the
[16:08] life in your family cannot make
[16:10] it it's got to be his personal
[16:13] life the personal life of Jesus Christ
[16:16] why do so many
[16:18] Christians find it hard even basic
[16:22] Christianity and you take a look you
[16:25] know that's a that's a that's a
[16:26] Christian that's a saved man
[16:29] said boy or girl or
[16:31] woman so why they find it
[16:34] hard and here is Peter
[16:37] here here he was but always spoke about
[16:40] them yesterday
[16:42] morning they were disciples at this
[16:45] time they not yet been commissioned as
[16:48] Apostles
[16:49] yet but Peter had had a
[16:52] revelation the keys had been given to
[16:55] him and even though he did not know it
[16:59] God had a future ahead of
[17:01] him an important part in the kingdom of
[17:05] God but here is Peter at the at the at
[17:09] the at the crucifixion of
[17:12] Jesus and this is Easter
[17:15] weekend right about this time 2,000
[17:19] years ago Peter was warned by Jesus by
[17:25] Jesus you're going to deny me three
[17:28] times
[17:29] and Peter said they can all deny you see
[17:34] that self there they cannot they can all
[17:37] deny you but I will not I will follow
[17:40] you to the death
[17:42] intellectually he know the right thing
[17:44] to
[17:45] do but when Peter was
[17:48] called but when Peter was called to put
[17:51] into practice what he knew
[17:55] intellectually he failed he lied
[17:59] a cursed your intellect will fail you it
[18:04] failed the great
[18:06] Peter it tell
[18:08] Peter even with a spiritual
[18:11] revelation of the seven Thunders the
[18:14] seven voices of the of the future coming
[18:17] seven Church
[18:19] ages amen St John
[18:21] 21 I read from verse
[18:24] 15 so when they had died Jesus said to
[18:28] Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas lovest
[18:31] thou me more than
[18:33] this he said unto him yeah Lord thou
[18:36] knowest that I love thee he said unto
[18:39] him feed my
[18:51] Lambs to him again the second time Shon
[18:54] son of Jonas lovest thou me he said unto
[18:58] him yeah Lord thou knowest that I love
[19:00] thee he said unto him feed my
[19:08] sheep he said unto him the third time
[19:11] Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me Peter
[19:14] was grieved because he has said unto him
[19:16] the third time lovest thou me and you
[19:19] know you you know the
[19:21] story Jesus asked him the first two
[19:24] times in a
[19:26] gapper a gapper love because when you
[19:29] have a spiritual
[19:31] Revelation like Peter heard in Matthew
[19:36] 16 part of the the package
[19:39] comes with a gap of Lord love to God
[19:44] with all your heart with all your soul
[19:47] with all your might with all your
[19:50] strength and the second
[19:52] commandment love your neighbor as
[19:55] thyself AAP love the love of
[19:59] God
[20:00] Amen is packaged with a spiritual
[20:05] Revelation and that's why
[20:08] Jesus in
[20:11] AAP do you love me do you love me with
[20:14] AAP
[20:16] love because if you really do AAP Love
[20:20] Never
[20:21] Fails because that's
[20:23] charity never
[20:25] fails you love
[20:27] MEAP Peter said yes Lord I love you he
[20:31] wasn't very sure because the thoughts
[20:32] came on his
[20:34] mind that if he really loved
[20:36] him he swore love to him but he denied
[20:41] him and Peter was
[20:44] grieved this third time because Jesus
[20:47] changed the
[20:49] words the English language says
[20:52] love but the Greek let you understand he
[20:55] said Peter do you like me
[20:59] are you fond of
[21:01] me like you are fond of a
[21:04] friend you just like me don't talk love
[21:09] Peter because if you loved me you would
[21:13] not have denied me that
[21:14] way Peter understood those
[21:17] things that's why he was
[21:20] grieved he wasn't grieved at the Lord he
[21:23] was griefed at
[21:25] himself Jesus was probing Peter's love
[21:29] Jesus was was trying to get Peter to
[21:34] understand
[21:36] a is the only
[21:39] thing that God requires in Christian
[21:43] service that's the only acceptable
[21:46] motive in Christian
[21:49] service feel your love will fail you it
[21:52] will lie Peter it will steal it will
[21:56] cheat it will curse
[21:59] it will commit fornication it will
[22:01] commit
[22:02] adultery it will do
[22:05] drugs Peter was grieved at
[22:08] himself at the life he had
[22:11] lived failing the Lord the way he failed
[22:13] the
[22:14] Lord he wasn't gried another man he
[22:18] wasn't blaming some other
[22:21] man
[22:22] Peter Peter was not in that
[22:25] game of blaming the Lord
[22:29] or some other man for his failings for
[22:33] what he did wrong Peter was man
[22:36] enough to say I did it I'm griefed at
[22:41] myself I am sorry Lord he said yeah Lord
[22:46] thou knowest all things you know my
[22:50] weakness you know my weak spots I need
[22:53] your help thou knowest all things can
[22:57] you say that this morning
[22:59] Hallelujah hallu glory to God
[23:02] Amen verse
[23:05] 17 he said unto him the third time Simon
[23:07] son of Jonas lovest thou me like do you
[23:10] like me Peter was grieved because he
[23:12] said unto him the third time lovest thou
[23:15] me and he said unto him Lord thou
[23:17] knowest all things thou knowest that I
[23:19] love thee
[23:29] J Jesus said unto him feed my
[23:34] sheep verily verily I say unto thee when
[23:36] thou was young thou Gest thyself and
[23:38] walkest with thou wouldest but when thou
[23:41] shalt be old he's talking about maturity
[23:43] now when you were
[23:47] child now you're coming to
[23:50] maturity and when you old when you are
[23:54] old thou shall stretch forth thine hands
[23:56] and another shall gu thee and carry the
[23:59] whether thou wouldest
[24:01] not you ready you are ready to submit
[24:06] then take my hands precious
[24:09] Lord you're tired of leading
[24:13] yourself you want another to lead
[24:16] you to a death to the death of a car
[24:21] weight amen amen this SP he signifying
[24:26] by what you should glorify God and when
[24:29] he had spoken this he said unto Peter
[24:31] follow
[24:37] me amen First
[24:40] Corinthians chter 13
[25:05] May though I speak with the tongues of
[25:07] men and of angels and I have no charity
[25:09] I am become a son Andra or a tingin
[25:23] symbol and though I have the gift of
[25:25] Prophecy and hon understand all
[25:26] Mysteries and all knowledge and though I
[25:28] have all Propet so that I could remove
[25:29] mountains and have no charity I am
[25:40] nothing and though I be sure all my
[25:42] goods to fear the poor and though I give
[25:43] my body to be born and have not charity
[25:46] he profited me
[25:54] nothing charity is a Greatful
[25:56] love only
[25:59] motive in Christian in Christian
[26:02] service verse four charity suffers long
[26:06] and is kind Char EnV not Char not itself
[26:10] is not puffed
[26:16] up does not behave itself unly she not
[26:20] her own is not easily provoked think of
[26:22] No Evil
[26:29] re rejoiceth not in iniquity but
[26:31] rejoiceth in the
[26:35] truth beareth all things hopeth all
[26:38] things endureth all
[26:42] things charity never faileth but whether
[26:45] there be prophecies they shall fail
[26:48] whether there be tongues they shall
[26:49] seize whether there be knowledge it
[26:51] shall vanish away
[26:58] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[27:06] part but when that which is perfect is
[27:09] come then that which is in part shall be
[27:12] drawn
[27:17] away here this again Jesus told Peter
[27:21] when you were young you could do
[27:24] whatever but I'm calling you for a
[27:26] higher level of existence
[27:31] a
[27:32] growth a growing up into him in All
[27:36] Things Christian
[27:38] maturity when I was a child I spake as a
[27:42] child I understood as a child I thought
[27:44] as a child but when I became a man I put
[27:48] away childish
[27:50] things for now we see through a glass
[27:53] Darkly but then face to face now I know
[27:56] in part but then I know even as also I
[28:00] am
[28:07] known and now abide faith hope charity
[28:09] these three but the greatest of these is
[28:16] Charity amen
[28:20] amen my scripture here Ephesians
[28:26] 4 verse 26
[28:44] be ye angry and sin not let not the son
[28:48] go down upon your wrath
[28:51] neither neither give place to the devil
[28:55] [Music]
[29:01] let him that steal steal no more but
[29:03] rather let him labor walk with his hands
[29:05] the things which is good that he may
[29:07] have to give to him the
[29:14] needed let no corrupt communication
[29:16] proceed out of your mouth but that which
[29:18] is good to the use of edine that may
[29:21] Minister Grace unto the her
[29:30] and grieve not the holy spirit of God
[29:32] whereby you sailed onto the day of
[29:40] redemption let all
[29:42] be and I get to your emotions let all
[29:45] bitterness and wrath and anger and
[29:48] clamour and evil speaking be put away
[29:52] from you with all malice
[30:04] and replace those evil emotions with
[30:06] these other emotions
[30:08] here vers 32 and be ye kind one to
[30:12] another tenderhearted forgiving one
[30:15] another even as God for Christ's sake
[30:19] hath forgiven
[30:24] you amen amen may the Lord his his
[30:29] hly bless
[30:42] you
[30:44] intellectually we're hearing the
[30:49] message is is a quote from
[30:52] B I'll get it the quot
[30:56] later but if you know
[30:59] the Bible in Old Testament
[31:02] times tells us about the Jews God's
[31:07] people how God how God in his Covenant
[31:11] with
[31:13] them that they would kill a
[31:17] lamb to atone for their
[31:21] sins year and year
[31:23] out there was a day of atonement
[31:28] where the people led by the high
[31:31] priest would come before
[31:34] God and take a
[31:36] lamb and slay the lamb to take their
[31:39] sins away and they release the
[31:42] lamb and the lamb will car the sin far
[31:45] away from
[31:47] them but it was only question of
[31:50] time before those same
[31:53] sins that the lamb took away from
[31:56] them ENT
[31:58] lamb it was only a question of
[32:01] time before they were back doing the
[32:03] same things
[32:05] again or even
[32:07] worse and that was the
[32:10] Dilemma that God's people the
[32:13] Jews were in in the in the Old Testament
[32:18] days and brother explained to
[32:21] us like many Bible scholars
[32:24] know that what it
[32:26] was man's
[32:28] nature is inherently
[32:32] evil there's no good
[32:34] thing in our flesh in our
[32:38] nature and Paul said that what I would I
[32:43] would not and sin taking advantage of my
[32:48] weak
[32:49] nature deceive my
[32:52] nature because I know in my flesh there
[32:55] lies not one good thing
[32:58] so in the Old
[33:00] Testament jaring year
[33:03] out they kept coming
[33:06] back the lamb will take their sins
[33:09] away and they will come back before they
[33:13] knew it they were doing the same sins
[33:15] all over
[33:17] again that was the Old
[33:19] Testament but
[33:21] strangely many Believers are still in
[33:25] that same spot
[33:27] it's as though is the lamb lamb in the
[33:31] Old
[33:32] Testament that took their sins
[33:35] away it's like they don't have the power
[33:38] they haven't found the
[33:40] spot to live a Victorious Christian
[33:44] life but brother Bram he explained to
[33:49] us that the
[33:51] lamb the natural lamb in the Old
[33:54] Testament could not take away sins
[33:59] could not really atone for
[34:02] sins because the lamb was an
[34:06] animal that had no
[34:08] soul it had a spirit and a
[34:12] flesh and man the Jews that were placing
[34:17] their sins on that animal why a three
[34:21] four
[34:23] being they had a spirit and a flesh like
[34:28] lamb but they also had a
[34:31] soul which is where the nature is hiding
[34:35] at so the the the lamb could not really
[34:39] take away their
[34:41] sins the lamb paid the P paid the price
[34:44] for their
[34:46] sins because lamb was
[34:48] slain but to give them the
[34:51] power to live about that
[34:54] sin the innocent lamb could not do it
[34:59] because even though the lamb was
[35:00] innocent it was
[35:02] sinless the life of that lamb could not
[35:06] come upon human
[35:08] beings because the life of human beings
[35:11] hid in their
[35:13] souls that's where the nature
[35:16] hides so the lamb the natural lamb can
[35:20] only take sins away for a short
[35:24] while and that's why year after year
[35:28] they had to come to make an atonement
[35:32] for their sins but one day one day
[35:37] another lamb came thank God for
[35:40] Easter thank God for Easter another lamb
[35:44] came it wasn't a fleed
[35:47] animal but he was the Lamb of God John
[35:51] said Behold the Lamb of God we taketh
[35:56] away the sins of the world he has
[35:59] carried your sins so far
[36:02] away you don't have to carry them no
[36:06] more did you hear me the Lamb of God has
[36:11] carried your sins you don't have to
[36:14] carry them
[36:17] again you don't have to be a slave to
[36:20] your sin to your evil nature to sex to
[36:25] drugs to Habit
[36:28] the Lamb of God has carried your sins
[36:32] away that's what Easter was
[36:35] about that's why he went to
[36:37] Calvary so one time not year after year
[36:44] one to take your sins nail them to the
[36:48] tree every habit every sin yesterday sin
[36:54] today sin future sins
[36:57] to the
[36:59] tree and you are
[37:06] free how many are
[37:08] free say I am
[37:11] free the Lamb of God Jesus Christ he set
[37:16] you
[37:24] free amen you be seated amen with us
[37:33] so when Jesus
[37:35] died God
[37:37] finally had the
[37:39] answer the
[37:41] solution to man's constant sin
[37:45] problem because Jesus Christ being the
[37:48] Lamb of
[37:49] God was a man he was fully God and he
[37:54] was fully
[37:55] man Hallelujah
[37:58] he went through everything you went
[37:59] through he suffered everything you
[38:01] suffered he was tempted in every point
[38:05] he was not
[38:06] pretending he was tempted he was tempted
[38:09] to do wrong things like you were
[38:12] tempted but he found the spot he found
[38:16] the spot to
[38:18] overcome
[38:20] Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah
[38:27] and what he
[38:28] did the power that L within him in his
[38:34] life within his soul this was a lamb
[38:37] that had a
[38:38] soul that life in his soul to come back
[38:43] upon us and come into our souls and give
[38:47] us the power within us the power of an
[38:52] unending
[38:53] life the power to overcome that's why
[38:57] Paul cried out who shall deliver me from
[39:02] this body of death I thank my
[39:06] God Hallelujah for Jesus Christ who
[39:10] gives me who gives all of us always the
[39:15] victory through Jesus Christ say that to
[39:18] yourself God gives
[39:20] me always the victory not today Victory
[39:26] tomorrow you are down
[39:28] you have the
[39:29] victory
[39:31] always hallelujah hallelujah you are
[39:34] just got to change your thinking about
[39:36] it brother spoke last night you got to
[39:40] take Lucifer and squeeze him
[39:43] out because you know who you are you
[39:46] know that you know that you know you
[39:49] going begin to wave your
[39:51] sins you can begin to wave your
[39:54] habits no matter how powerful they are
[39:57] they are coming off of you this
[39:59] morning whatever was left from yesterday
[40:01] morning yesterday
[40:04] night they are coming out this
[40:06] morning because he who the son of man
[40:10] Jesus Christ the Lamb of God I set free
[40:15] is free
[40:16] indeed say it say I am free indeed
[40:22] [Applause]
[40:30] this is not the pastor setting you
[40:32] free this is not the bishop setting you
[40:34] free there is not the king set
[40:37] fre there is not any
[40:39] reverence any evangelist no Apostle no
[40:44] preacher no Prophet setting you free for
[40:48] the son of man Jesus Christ God himself
[40:53] setting you free his life coming to you
[40:57] sets you free you have Elbow
[41:04] Room you say
[41:06] brotheru but I'm not
[41:09] free I'm not free I still do wrong
[41:12] things because the devil is deceiving
[41:15] you the devil is taking advantage of
[41:18] you of your ignorance on the
[41:21] world but not
[41:23] anymore these meetings these meetings
[41:27] are
[41:27] out more than a
[41:30] conqueror more than a
[41:32] conqueror more than an
[41:41] overcomer you might as well Rejoice
[41:44] might as well shout shout it from the
[41:47] rooftops Glory
[41:55] Glory see that
[42:02] so and see brother con was speaking last
[42:06] night speaking to his young people and
[42:08] the church about
[42:14] life about
[42:17] life how life is
[42:20] important many times we forget the pro
[42:23] said we're two two four beings one on
[42:26] the earth to die
[42:28] want one in heaven to
[42:29] live this life here is with death that's
[42:34] why Jesus
[42:36] said Peter when you were young you did
[42:40] what you wanted you but now you are old
[42:43] one going to take you by the hand and
[42:46] you're going to mature you was telling
[42:48] Peter because the Bible said he was
[42:51] telling him by what death he should die
[42:55] to glorify God
[42:57] in other words when you are maturing is
[43:01] a death process in there you got to die
[43:05] you and I can't stay in the same
[43:07] shape and think because and think
[43:10] because
[43:11] intellectually we are hearing the
[43:13] message that makes us Christians that
[43:16] makes us example
[43:18] Believers no don't let no man deceive
[43:22] you
[43:23] brother let no man lead you to error
[43:27] the Mysteries is no words the Mysteries
[43:32] hanging in the heavens but brother Pam
[43:35] said Seven Angels Came From eternity
[43:39] came down with the Mysteries the
[43:42] Mysteries come down from God the
[43:45] Mysteries don't stay up they come down
[43:49] [Applause]
[44:00] if I preach and your head is all
[44:03] scattered you don't even what I'm
[44:05] talking
[44:07] about most
[44:09] likely the
[44:11] Mysteries I'm not bringing them
[44:14] down to you as the word of God because
[44:18] the Bible said Jesus Christ is the
[44:22] mystery of
[44:23] God Christ himself been the mystery of
[44:26] God
[44:28] it should be the
[44:29] one that people will hear and say wow
[44:34] such great
[44:35] Mysteries wow but that was how the
[44:38] Pharisees spoke that was how the sades
[44:42] spoke because they fail they thought
[44:46] that by speaking such great great great
[44:48] sounding
[44:50] words that's going to maintain their
[44:53] position that's going to make the people
[44:55] respect them
[44:57] but Jesus the greatest
[45:00] mystery the mystery of God itself he
[45:03] brought the mystery
[45:05] down the Bible said the common
[45:09] people had him
[45:11] gladly in other words the common people
[45:15] have Jesus Christ speaking the mystery
[45:17] of God breaking it down at their
[45:21] level understanding and they were happy
[45:24] they rejoiced because the Mysteries
[45:28] broken down to them as the word of God
[45:31] give them hope give them a hope give
[45:34] them a confidence they can live this
[45:37] life and they were happy the Common
[45:40] People heard him gladly they cried out
[45:44] never a man spake like this man never a
[45:49] man did the things on this Earth that
[45:52] this man and his words were as beautiful
[45:56] as his miracle
[45:57] he didn't speak as the scribes and
[46:00] Pharisees with their High sanding
[46:03] Mysteries brought the Mysteries down as
[46:06] the word of God the Mysteries come down
[46:09] to us at our intellectual
[46:13] level let me say that again the
[46:16] Mysteries come down to us at our
[46:18] intellectual level as the world of God
[46:22] that's where it starts from because
[46:24] intellectually Mal said we hearing the
[46:27] word of God somebody shout
[46:31] [Applause]
[46:42] hallelujah amen
[46:48] [Applause]
[47:03] GL are you happy glory to God
[47:09] Amen so the
[47:11] proof the proof is not in speaking
[47:16] words that people don't understand or in
[47:19] speaking Mysteries that Mal is not even
[47:22] speak
[47:24] about that's humanistic
[47:27] but the secret seven angels come down to
[47:31] Malachi and brought the Mysteries down
[47:34] to him Hallelujah and brother bam said
[47:38] those Seven Angels Came From eternity
[47:41] and brought the Mysteries down to me as
[47:43] the word of God hallelujah and he said
[47:47] what those angels pick him up into the
[47:51] Pyramid of themselves the mystery word
[47:55] that those angels brought
[47:57] those mystery words that those angels
[47:59] brought were broken down to the
[48:02] prophet and the effect of it was it
[48:05] lifted him up above the Earth above his
[48:09] weaknesses above his failures above his
[48:12] Temptations the Mysteries come down to
[48:14] us as the word of God
[48:17] [Applause]
[48:31] Glory so
[48:34] personally I'm so focused like brother
[48:36] was speaking last
[48:38] night on my young people in
[48:41] particular understanding that this
[48:44] gospel here is no Fable is no
[48:48] fair you can leave this
[48:51] life oh yes you
[48:53] can oh yes you can say to yourself say
[48:58] to yourself I can live this
[49:01] life hallelujah hallelujah no matter
[49:04] your weaknesses no matter your
[49:07] Temptations because the Lamb of God that
[49:09] takes the sins of the world away has
[49:12] appeared to you
[49:13] already take away your sins your
[49:16] weaknesses your habits the loss of the
[49:19] flesh the loss of eyes the pr of Life
[49:22] the where you will overcome them
[49:25] constantly
[49:27] even as by the spirit of the Lord glory
[49:30] to God Amen because that's how God
[49:33] intended it to be glory glory to God
[49:37] Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah because
[49:40] because know what happened just
[49:43] quickly what happened when God created
[49:47] man in his own image after his
[49:51] likess amen Genesis
[49:54] 126 that was God creating man and when
[49:58] he created Adam he created you the same
[50:02] way he created Adam directly Out of the
[50:05] Dust of the ground in
[50:07] Eden and he he creates you the same way
[50:11] out of the Dust of the
[50:12] ground and I hide you in your mother's
[50:16] womb because life is precious to God so
[50:21] God hides you in your mother's bosom and
[50:25] you grow up under her
[50:27] heart under her heart her heart her
[50:32] lungs her vital
[50:35] organs who are protecting
[50:38] you you are
[50:40] created a creation of God from the dust
[50:43] of the ground like Adam was and in in
[50:47] Genesis
[50:49] 126 God he took his own image let us
[50:53] make man in our image so God created man
[50:56] his own image it took his own image
[51:00] seven perfect
[51:01] Spirits because before the
[51:04] beginning Elohim seven spirits and he
[51:08] had a desire to make M His
[51:11] Image so he formed himself into the
[51:14] theophany the logos word that will have
[51:18] an
[51:19] image and off of that logos word which
[51:22] was seven spirits he created an image so
[51:26] the image he put in Adam in Genesis
[51:29] 126 was the image of the logos was the
[51:33] image of seven
[51:34] spirits it was a word image was a word
[51:38] SE was Adam's theop that he bypassed
[51:43] that God put into him in seed form
[51:46] Adam's seed was in Genesis
[51:49] 126 let us make man in our image and
[51:53] that image was seven perfect spirits
[51:57] a seed in Adam's soul and that's why
[52:02] your theop as a seed of God Amen your
[52:06] soul is your
[52:08] theophany SE
[52:10] form God
[52:12] condescended the seven spirits of the
[52:15] theop that you
[52:17] byass God sended it into your soul as a
[52:21] little button and that's where Victory
[52:24] lays that's where your victory
[52:29] too late
[52:30] Satan the seat of God is in me and if
[52:34] you understand if you ever understand
[52:38] that the seat of God rests in you you
[52:41] will know that he that is B of God does
[52:46] not commit
[52:48] sin because he cannot
[52:51] sin why the Bible provides the answer
[52:56] because
[52:57] the seat of
[52:58] God
[53:02] in so the devil has been lying to you
[53:07] that's why you struggle with sin that's
[53:09] why you struggle so much with sin
[53:11] because Lucifer has been lying to you
[53:14] he's a liar he's the father of Lies
[53:17] every time he opens his mouth he is
[53:20] telling a
[53:21] lie but you shall know the truth and the
[53:25] truth set you free you are free this
[53:31] [Applause]
[53:40] [Music]
[53:43] morning amen amen so God he created
[53:48] Adam and put the image of the theophany
[53:53] not the theophany he byass his theophany
[53:57] but was an image of the theop an image
[54:01] of the word the theop it was the word
[54:03] image Adam Soul hallelujah
[54:09] [Music]
[54:13] hallelujah and that's the same thing you
[54:15] have in you if you are a seed of
[54:18] God that's what you
[54:20] mean when you say I'm a seed of
[54:23] God Seven Perfect spirits
[54:27] seven perfect Spirits is in
[54:30] you that's all once that's in
[54:34] you you shall
[54:36] overcome oh hallelujah hallelujah
[54:39] hallelujah those are the same seven
[54:42] spirits in the
[54:44] logos that overcame Lucifer in heaven it
[54:49] could not fall for his
[54:50] lies it could not fall for his
[54:53] tals it could not fall for his errors
[54:57] it could not fall for his false
[54:58] teachings it could not fall for his
[55:00] false
[55:01] doctrines it could not fall for his
[55:04] manipulations it could not fall for his
[55:06] tals that the in heaven the seven
[55:10] spirits that overcome in heaven is on
[55:13] the inside of you that's why you
[55:15] overcome false
[55:16] PRS false prophets false teachings false
[55:20] teachers false doctor hallelujah
[55:22] hallelujah
[55:27] that's why you overcome them all they
[55:29] cannot touch you hallelujah hallelujah
[55:32] provid teachers they cannot touch
[55:36] you glory
[55:38] glory because the seat of
[55:41] God the
[55:43] sit that overcame Lucifer's tales in
[55:46] [Music]
[55:49] heav and so
[55:52] God before he ever got in the flesh
[55:55] before
[55:57] form the Flesh and his
[55:59] creation what did God say what did God
[56:02] do he began to speak to this soul to
[56:07] speak to the soul be
[56:10] fruitful
[56:12] multiply subdue replenish began to speak
[56:16] to it God didn't speak to it maybe maybe
[56:21] not it was a no soul it was a positive
[56:25] assurance
[56:26] be e be an
[56:29] overcomer be fruitful
[56:33] multiply the Earth
[56:35] overcome be absolutely Total
[56:40] Control in your soul that's in your soul
[56:44] to
[56:44] sub Hallelujah to overcome to be
[56:48] fruitful to be
[56:50] productive glory to God every single day
[56:53] of your life am amen amen that's the
[56:57] real you and then after God had spoken
[57:03] and put all the Victory
[57:06] Secrets in the
[57:08] theop in Adam's
[57:11] Soul it formed the body of
[57:14] Flesh around
[57:16] Adam so why should any real
[57:20] believer who follow brother who follows
[57:22] brother br's
[57:24] message have a struggle with their flesh
[57:27] the flesh was not even in the
[57:31] picture God never spoke to your
[57:34] flesh God never spoke to Adam's flesh he
[57:39] spoke into his
[57:40] soul spoke seven spirits seven voices
[57:45] seven Thunders into his soul as a little
[57:48] seed of the
[57:50] world and then he formed the
[57:52] flesh around Adam and Adam
[57:56] became a living
[57:58] soul and in Adam in the Garden of Eden
[58:02] we saw the
[58:04] effects of that Soul living out of Adam
[58:09] Hallelujah soul to subdue to multiply to
[58:15] reproduce was in the Garden of Eden he
[58:18] was in absolute total control of the
[58:21] earth it could speak it could name it
[58:25] could control all nature
[58:27] he could do whatever he wanted to
[58:28] do because in his soul was a seat of
[58:32] almighty God Seven Perfect
[58:35] Spirits Hallelujah because notice notice
[58:40] when Adam was
[58:41] formed Adam was Adam was first
[58:44] created and then
[58:46] formed and you are also created as a
[58:50] little BR in your mother's womb and then
[58:53] the flesh is formed around
[58:58] [Applause]
[59:13] that because when
[59:15] Adam the
[59:17] creation God don't have anything to do
[59:19] with form he a
[59:21] Creator he's not a he's not a former of
[59:24] things he's not for reformation
[59:27] with his
[59:28] creation and his
[59:30] creation his
[59:32] creation what lucier could not create
[59:35] Lucifer can form things but the creation
[59:40] was a seed in the soul Lucifer could not
[59:43] touch
[59:44] that and God deals with his creation and
[59:49] if you know if you understand you are a
[59:52] creation of God your flesh is only a
[59:56] formation of God but your soul is a
[59:59] creation of God in other words only God
[1:00:04] Only God can create that not your father
[1:00:09] not your mother not Lucifer could create
[1:00:12] your soul
[1:00:14] [Applause]
[1:00:26] so what happened that
[1:00:28] Soul became a living Soul that's what
[1:00:32] lived it wasn't the flesh the flesh just
[1:00:36] followed where the soul gaed it to go to
[1:00:41] Hallelujah the soul the seven spirits on
[1:00:44] the
[1:00:45] inside was the controlled Tower to
[1:00:48] control the
[1:00:49] soul because when God Genesis 2:7 breath
[1:00:54] into Adam the Breath of Life the Bible
[1:00:59] says Man became a living
[1:01:06] Soul the seven spirits began to live it
[1:01:11] only needed the body to carry out its
[1:01:16] functions and Mal explained to
[1:01:19] us when Man became a living Soul at the
[1:01:23] same time a spirit
[1:01:26] and a and a soul of this world a nature
[1:01:31] of this world also came into
[1:01:35] Adam hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:38] Glory Hallelujah because you have to
[1:01:40] have a nature of the world to pick up
[1:01:44] his Cutlas and Ste the
[1:01:47] garden and make things right in the
[1:01:51] garden to be a husband to
[1:01:54] Eve and what ever need to do as a human
[1:01:58] being he needed a nature of the
[1:02:01] world Earthly human
[1:02:03] nature to do all that but that human
[1:02:06] nature was in absolute
[1:02:10] subjection to the nature of God in his
[1:02:13] soul which was a seven perfect
[1:02:16] spirits and Man became a living Soul his
[1:02:21] soul lived out seven spirits lived out
[1:02:24] it was perfection it was Authority it
[1:02:27] was signs wonders Miracles it was spoken
[1:02:31] what power it was th sayth the Lord or
[1:02:35] keep
[1:02:36] still a tree never died before Adam Adam
[1:02:41] could name Adam could speak Adam could
[1:02:44] do whatever I wanted to do why the
[1:02:48] nature of God Seven Perfect Spirit the
[1:02:51] word image have been anointed into his
[1:02:54] flesh in Genesis 2:7 Hallelujah and that
[1:02:59] was the original Son of God on the face
[1:03:01] of the Earth
[1:03:03] [Applause]
[1:03:10] Hallelujah we live beneath our
[1:03:13] privileges we let this flesh this flesh
[1:03:17] controls us so much whereas in God's
[1:03:21] program whereas in God's program this
[1:03:24] flesh is only a s
[1:03:26] to the seed on the
[1:03:29] inside but I'll but I'll show you what
[1:03:34] happened glory to God Amen and that's
[1:03:37] how Adam and Eve lived they had
[1:03:41] instructions from God to subdue the
[1:03:44] Earth to be fruitful to multiply to go
[1:03:48] about their normal
[1:03:50] duties prove to Every Creature
[1:03:54] around that there were the
[1:03:56] Pinnacle of God's
[1:03:59] creation and those instructions were
[1:04:02] given to his soul and the flesh only
[1:04:05] carried out the
[1:04:07] instructions hallelujah hallelujah the
[1:04:10] flesh was
[1:04:15] [Applause]
[1:04:20] [Music]
[1:04:22] bound maybe she catch some breath she
[1:04:31] [Applause]
[1:04:52] are you understanding about the seven
[1:04:54] spirits
[1:04:56] the seven voices the seven Thunders it's
[1:04:59] more than a
[1:05:00] Doctrine it's more than it's not it's
[1:05:03] not any man's
[1:05:05] Revelation it's not even brother bram's
[1:05:08] Revelation is a revelation right stra
[1:05:11] from the man of
[1:05:13] Elohim so you have got to preach them
[1:05:16] seven voices them seven spirits
[1:05:25] there is no other way to
[1:05:27] overcome glory to God Amen So
[1:05:31] Adam amen he went about the
[1:05:35] garden
[1:05:37] overcoming and the devil didn't like
[1:05:40] didn't like that he had been kicked
[1:05:43] out he understood
[1:05:46] enough to know that in Adam in Eve was
[1:05:50] the same theophany that King out of
[1:05:53] heaven but he felt he had a chance here
[1:05:56] because he could sense they had a human
[1:05:59] nature to do things on the face of the
[1:06:02] Earth so the devil knew he couldn't mess
[1:06:05] around with their
[1:06:07] souls so he was going to come some other
[1:06:10] way and try to see if we could get them
[1:06:13] to
[1:06:14] fall what he tried in heaven he did not
[1:06:17] succeed here he was trying to see if he
[1:06:22] could succeed this time around so he
[1:06:25] came
[1:06:26] he came again a test of the
[1:06:29] word hallelujah hallu it wasn't Adam
[1:06:34] Adam could not be
[1:06:35] deceived but Eve was a
[1:06:39] byproduct
[1:06:41] Hallelujah and while men
[1:06:45] slept while Adam men
[1:06:48] slept it didn't mean was physically
[1:06:51] sleeping it means why you are not on
[1:06:54] your toes for a minute
[1:06:58] when you're a little
[1:07:01] slack when you let your discipline go
[1:07:05] down when you let down the
[1:07:08] bars when you go Carill us for a split
[1:07:12] second when you're not on your toes when
[1:07:15] you're not watching like you ought to
[1:07:17] watch the enemy comes in and it came to
[1:07:21] e watch watch
[1:07:25] the way he came to Eve that's the way he
[1:07:28] comes to you that's the way he makes
[1:07:30] many of you to fall
[1:07:32] down and bat your nails and feel you
[1:07:36] never had an
[1:07:38] experience and make the young people to
[1:07:41] feel this gospel doesn't
[1:07:43] work but Malachi for cried
[1:07:46] out let these virtues let them work in
[1:07:49] me oh lord is my
[1:07:52] prayer because the virtues work
[1:07:55] these virtues
[1:07:56] work the seven fund virtues they
[1:08:00] work Hallelujah they work in Adam and
[1:08:05] Eve before the fall and they work in you
[1:08:10] if you can only
[1:08:12] recognize Hallelujah
[1:08:14] [Applause]
[1:08:26] glory to God Amen so Lucifer came to Eve
[1:08:30] and said have God said it is not equal
[1:08:33] the
[1:08:35] scriptures so don't tell
[1:08:37] me it's quoting the scriptures or
[1:08:40] quoting the
[1:08:42] quot Lucifer in the serpent quoted the
[1:08:48] scriptures even Lucifer the Bible says
[1:08:51] has appeared as an angel of Light he
[1:08:54] appeared as an angel of of light in Eden
[1:08:58] like a
[1:08:58] friend Eve had God said going about
[1:09:04] going into homes and houses and churches
[1:09:07] to leave silly women
[1:09:10] astray Hallelujah told Eve God
[1:09:16] said and he said God said she quoted it
[1:09:20] was a quote
[1:09:23] War if quoted exactly
[1:09:27] said Malachi first said this is the
[1:09:32] quote so and so
[1:09:35] Hallelujah God
[1:09:37] said of every tree in the garden we
[1:09:41] should eat we should eat butn that one
[1:09:46] in the middle we should not eat so the
[1:09:49] devil that's right Prophet quote truth
[1:09:54] man he told he said but you know but you
[1:09:58] know he was getting to her he was
[1:10:02] working on her
[1:10:04] emotions he was working on her
[1:10:08] [Applause]
[1:10:14] emotions the devil if you're a SE of God
[1:10:18] he will never get you on the
[1:10:20] world he will have to manipulate you in
[1:10:23] your emotions
[1:10:25] that's who he is he's a liar he's a
[1:10:29] manipulator he takes the word of God and
[1:10:32] manipulat it manipulates your
[1:10:35] mind getting your
[1:10:40] [Applause]
[1:10:42] emotions got in our
[1:10:44] emotions and said God knows you'll be a
[1:10:48] Creator God knows you know it's true God
[1:10:53] doesn't want you to take the fruit
[1:10:56] or that tree in the middle but you know
[1:10:59] one thing God did not show
[1:11:02] you one thing God did not show you let
[1:11:05] me go with Mysteries above what he not
[1:11:07] show you let me show you what God did
[1:11:10] not show
[1:11:11] you he's a liar and the father of lies
[1:11:16] don't you believe it say what the
[1:11:19] prophet
[1:11:22] said Glory say what the prophet
[1:11:27] said be
[1:11:29] dogmatic be
[1:11:30] fanatical say only what the prophet
[1:11:33] said don't let no man no Pastor no
[1:11:38] minister no Sleek talking person take
[1:11:42] off of that word death L on that on that
[1:11:46] road spiritual death place on that
[1:11:51] road if the prophet did not say it don't
[1:11:54] you receive it
[1:11:56] don't use 10 for it don't use
[1:11:59] stand for these crazy
[1:12:02] interpretations hear me real
[1:12:05] good I said don't you stand for these
[1:12:09] crazy
[1:12:11] interpretations and I'm watching my
[1:12:12] words here I'm conscious of my words
[1:12:16] exactly this
[1:12:18] interpretations do nobody any
[1:12:20] good that just talize your mind
[1:12:25] and put an arrogant Spirit on
[1:12:27] you to cancel people
[1:12:31] out to validate
[1:12:33] Yourself by pushing other people
[1:12:36] [Music]
[1:12:37] down to valid so so Lucifer the serpent
[1:12:43] told Eve this is one thing God kept away
[1:12:46] from you that one thing is
[1:12:52] what you are going to be a creator
[1:12:56] he said God told us that but said we
[1:12:58] should wait until the
[1:13:01] seven their voices yes you've been
[1:13:04] waiting you have been waiting for so
[1:13:06] long this is how it is done and began to
[1:13:10] touch her her emotions
[1:13:27] and the Bible
[1:13:29] said when she
[1:13:31] saw she saw her eyes the lust of the
[1:13:36] eyes the emotions it made her feel good
[1:13:41] she saw it was a tree good for food he
[1:13:45] felt good about it her emotions was all
[1:13:48] over say wow this feels
[1:13:53] good whatever controls your
[1:13:56] emotions controls
[1:13:58] you and the devil knows that if you can
[1:14:02] only get your
[1:14:04] emotions he will control
[1:14:06] you
[1:14:08] how amen amen how about all the boys all
[1:14:13] the young
[1:14:14] girls all the Believers that do wrong
[1:14:18] things take for example
[1:14:21] fornication people you know it's wrong
[1:14:25] you know you should not do that but the
[1:14:27] boy touches the girl she feels good in
[1:14:31] her mind she knows I should not be doing
[1:14:35] this but her
[1:14:37] emotions is under the control of another
[1:14:40] man's touch and whatever controls your
[1:14:43] emotions controls you you'll tell the
[1:14:46] word of God to wait a little bit I will
[1:14:50] repent later but this feels too
[1:14:53] good this PR to
[1:14:56] good whatever controls your emotions
[1:14:59] controls
[1:15:00] you hallelujah hallelujah but you shall
[1:15:03] know the truth and the truth shall set
[1:15:06] you
[1:15:18] free so after the
[1:15:20] fall what
[1:15:22] happened if took the fruit
[1:15:25] her emotions what God said not to do
[1:15:30] intellectually she knew the right thing
[1:15:32] to do but what her emotions were
[1:15:36] compromised she let down the bars and
[1:15:39] took the fruit and that's why we're in
[1:15:42] this problem till
[1:15:43] today and the Bible said she gave also
[1:15:47] to her
[1:15:48] husband and he took the fruit with her
[1:15:51] and the Bible father said Adam was not
[1:15:55] deceived
[1:15:57] intellectually Adam knew what was right
[1:15:59] to do he knew it was wrong to take the
[1:16:03] fruit yet he still did
[1:16:06] it oh hallelujah hallelujah let somebody
[1:16:10] shout hallelujah me
[1:16:19] Hallelujah
[1:16:22] glory
[1:16:23] amen what happened right away right away
[1:16:28] when they committed that sin the Bible
[1:16:31] said the day you eat of that fruit that
[1:16:34] day you die
[1:16:37] instantly they died death enter the
[1:16:40] human
[1:16:41] race and that nature of the
[1:16:44] world became a nature of
[1:16:46] death and from that time there was a war
[1:16:49] of two
[1:16:51] Natures in Adam and
[1:16:53] Eve in every man woman boy and
[1:16:56] girl the G of
[1:16:59] Eden Hallelujah Glory you may be seated
[1:17:05] [Applause]
[1:17:29] glory
[1:17:31] amen so after the
[1:17:33] four another
[1:17:35] nature is activated in Eve
[1:17:38] now brother con was talking
[1:17:40] yesterday
[1:17:42] activating the spiritual
[1:17:45] pathway another pathway an evil nature
[1:17:50] pathway was activated in the human race
[1:17:53] then hallelujah hallelujah and you saw
[1:17:56] in
[1:17:57] Eden that pathway of human nature
[1:18:01] operates
[1:18:03] mostly through the
[1:18:05] emotions to get you off of the
[1:18:08] wrong to get you to get you into the
[1:18:10] wrong
[1:18:12] rather it comes at the at your
[1:18:15] emotions and that's why the Bible has a
[1:18:18] lot to say about your
[1:18:21] emotions you and I can't really can't
[1:18:23] really Define what emotions really
[1:18:27] are nobody has been really able to
[1:18:29] Define emotions
[1:18:32] perly but we all experience
[1:18:36] emotions and the Bible talks about a lot
[1:18:38] of emotions anger
[1:18:42] jealousy
[1:18:44] Las feel the leing feel the
[1:18:48] leaving L of the eyes L of the Flesh of
[1:18:52] life
[1:18:55] our
[1:18:56] emotions things that we
[1:18:58] feel once the devil can get us on that
[1:19:03] rout he'll get us to do
[1:19:06] anything to God Amen sure amen when you
[1:19:12] and I when we behave
[1:19:15] badly when we be badly
[1:19:19] if we're only
[1:19:21] going by human reasoning because the
[1:19:25] devil going into our emotions and going
[1:19:28] into our mind to reason the word of God
[1:19:31] by her
[1:19:32] mind what she
[1:19:34] intellectually to get her to
[1:19:37] understand intellectually we hear the
[1:19:39] word just to understand the word so he
[1:19:43] can drop into your
[1:19:45] soul the devil got her to be reasoning
[1:19:49] the word so it gets your emotions first
[1:19:52] and then you reason it away
[1:19:55] the boy or
[1:19:56] girl the boy or girl that commits
[1:20:00] fornication knows it's wrong but when
[1:20:03] our emotions is all through
[1:20:05] [Music]
[1:20:07] it she begins to reason the
[1:20:10] word she tells herself or he tells
[1:20:14] himself after all I'm going to marry her
[1:20:18] I will marry her so it's all
[1:20:22] right he tells himself
[1:20:25] God will forgive me God understands I
[1:20:29] didn't want to do it but I just fell it
[1:20:32] begins to
[1:20:34] reason this brother so and so that big
[1:20:37] Minister that big brother he also fail
[1:20:41] so it doesn't matter if little me Falls
[1:20:45] God understands God will forgive me also
[1:20:48] the devil gets your emotions and it
[1:20:50] binds up your
[1:20:52] reasoning he winds you up in your your
[1:20:56] reasoning but he who the son of man sets
[1:20:59] free is free
[1:21:01] indeed glory to God
[1:21:05] [Applause]
[1:21:07] Amen so what are you saying

[1:21:12] here the devil amen guess our emotions
[1:21:16] first and guess our
[1:21:19] reason that's how this evil nature

[1:26:07] intellectually first you have to
[1:26:10] understand before it will become a
[1:26:13] spiritual Revelation intellectual
[1:26:16] understanding mental
[1:26:19] Faith mental faith
[1:26:23] [Applause]
[1:26:27] GL to God
[1:26:28] Amen I feel
[1:26:31] religious but too many
[1:26:33] people feel because intellectually they
[1:26:38] understand the message that spiritual
[1:26:41] Faith said no that's mental Faith mental
[1:26:46] Faith brings you to a
[1:26:48] recognition that you a sinner you you
[1:26:50] need Christ but that won't get you saved
[1:26:54] just recognize it a spiritual faith that
[1:26:57] can push you beyond the Realms of mental
[1:27:01] Faith mental faith can only go so
[1:27:05] far but spiritual faith is what takes
[1:27:08] into the Realms of God into the ramps of
[1:27:11] the
[1:27:12] Overcomer
[1:27:13] Hallelujah so don't think church because
[1:27:17] you understand
[1:27:18] intellectually that means you are the
[1:27:21] message a Muslim a Muslim will
[1:27:26] understand what I'm saying what
[1:27:28] yesterday morning what last night
[1:27:32] because it's spoken in a
[1:27:34] language that he
[1:27:36] understands there are words and human
[1:27:39] beings that we
[1:27:41] are we live in a world of words that's
[1:27:46] how we
[1:27:47] communicate words are the medium of
[1:27:50] exchange the medium of
[1:27:52] expression speak words that's how we
[1:27:56] understand one
[1:27:57] another so if a Muslim hears me this
[1:28:00] morning he understands what I'm saying
[1:28:03] or does he make him be in the
[1:28:07] message does that put him in the
[1:28:12] message
[1:28:14] intellectually we're hearing the message
[1:28:17] does not put us in the
[1:28:18] message
[1:28:20] intellectually we understand the
[1:28:22] Mysteries
[1:28:25] does not mean we have the
[1:28:27] Mysteries that's only the
[1:28:30] intellect to help you
[1:28:33] understand can somebody shout
[1:28:37] [Applause]
[1:28:46] hallelujah
[1:28:48] so we operate at an intellectual level
[1:28:54] and any word at
[1:28:55] all not just the message we understand
[1:29:00] at an intellectual
[1:29:02] level I can put it this way
[1:29:05] intellectually we are hearing
[1:29:08] words from
[1:29:10] school watch from our
[1:29:13] parents watch from our
[1:29:15] jobs watch from our subjects in school
[1:29:19] intellectually we understand those
[1:29:22] things and intellectually we understand
[1:29:25] school work the was in
[1:29:28] school every word in every field of
[1:29:30] human
[1:29:31] endeav we have to understand
[1:29:33] intellectually
[1:29:34] first and you students that go to school
[1:29:38] and you want to be a doctor and they
[1:29:41] begin to teach you about the things of a
[1:29:43] doctor about the anatomy of the human
[1:29:48] body and the physiology of the human
[1:29:51] body intellectually you understand it
[1:29:55] but does that make you a doctor right
[1:29:58] away no it does not it just giving you
[1:30:02] an
[1:30:03] understanding to help you to become a
[1:30:06] doctor so
[1:30:08] intellectually understanding the
[1:30:10] message doesn't give us a revelation
[1:30:13] it's just mental Faith to help us on our
[1:30:17] journey to a spiritual revelation
[1:30:22] [Applause]
[1:30:27] how many you understand say
[1:30:29] Amen oh let's try and wind down here
[1:30:33] glory to God Amen and when you live at
[1:30:36] that intellectual
[1:30:38] realm you will think because I
[1:30:41] understand
[1:30:41] intellectually the Bible said thou shal
[1:30:44] not steal thou shall not lie that shall
[1:30:48] not commit fornication that shall not
[1:30:50] commit adultery that shall not bear
[1:30:52] false witness
[1:30:54] thou shall not cover thy brother's
[1:30:56] Goods thou sh not take the name of the
[1:30:58] Lord th God in
[1:31:00] vain and all those instructions in the
[1:31:03] Bible intellectually we understand
[1:31:06] it and you will think automatically we
[1:31:10] should just
[1:31:12] comply and do what we know to be the
[1:31:15] right because
[1:31:16] intellectually we know what is right to
[1:31:19] do because intellectually we have
[1:31:22] understood thou sh not
[1:31:25] steal we know it is not good to
[1:31:27] steal it is not right to do these
[1:31:31] things is not right to hate your
[1:31:35] brother it's right to cover another
[1:31:37] man's Goods we know all these
[1:31:40] things so why don't we do
[1:31:43] them why when it gets to their
[1:31:47] actions what we know to do when it's
[1:31:50] time to act and do them
[1:31:54] we do
[1:31:55] them it's very simple the Garden of
[1:31:59] Eden because when you are that
[1:32:02] intellectual
[1:32:03] realm your intellect and your
[1:32:07] emotions what you know to be the right
[1:32:09] thing and your emotions are fighting for
[1:32:14] control is the war of your evil
[1:32:18] nature your evil nature is at war with
[1:32:20] the
[1:32:21] S what you know
[1:32:24] the young boy is telling
[1:32:26] himself I should not do drugs I should
[1:32:29] not commit adult I should not commit
[1:32:31] fornication I should not steal your
[1:32:35] emotions is telling
[1:32:37] you never
[1:32:39] mind never mind so there's a war your
[1:32:43] emotions passes what you know your
[1:32:47] emotions your reasoning
[1:32:51] poers and because human beings the way
[1:32:54] we are made the way we are constructed
[1:32:57] and Lucifer knew
[1:32:59] that science tells you
[1:33:03] that I don't want to get into that but
[1:33:06] the way we are wired the way we are
[1:33:09] constructed and Lucifer knew that that's
[1:33:12] why he went for the
[1:33:14] emotions Lucifer knows that the way we
[1:33:17] are
[1:33:19] wired we experience things emotionally
[1:33:21] first
[1:33:24] before we reason them
[1:33:26] out we experience things emotionally
[1:33:31] first before our reasoning kicks into
[1:33:35] place many times you're going to a
[1:33:38] restaurant or you young children you
[1:33:41] come back from
[1:33:43] school you you get get in the house you
[1:33:47] smell your mother's
[1:33:49] cooking once you smell the
[1:33:52] food you feel like
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:33:56] you haven't even Reen yet what food is
[1:34:00] that your all Factory
[1:34:03] senses your taste senses start feeling
[1:34:07] the saliva in your
[1:34:08] mouth spoking to your mother at all
[1:34:12] because your
[1:34:13] emotions are
[1:34:15] aroused before you know what food it
[1:34:18] is the devil knows our emotions
[1:34:23] will always almost all the time
[1:34:27] overpower our
[1:34:29] reasoning that's why intellectually
[1:34:32] knowing the word is not
[1:34:36] enough because most of the time your
[1:34:39] emotions will overpower the
[1:34:42] reasoning will overpower your
[1:34:45] intellect if
[1:34:47] emotions overpowered
[1:34:50] Reon overpowered what she need to be the
[1:34:52] truth
[1:34:54] so it's not
[1:34:56] enough to intellectually know the
[1:34:58] truth you have to go beyond
[1:35:01] that when you are that realm of
[1:35:04] intellect you are the humanistic realm
[1:35:08] and what happens you in a
[1:35:10] war what is right to do your
[1:35:15] emotions F your intellect back and forth
[1:35:18] and back and
[1:35:20] forth example I just told you about
[1:35:26] Peter we read
[1:35:28] about I'm fix the
[1:35:30] cloth
[1:35:32] Peter in the
[1:35:34] Bible Jesus told
[1:35:37] him you'll deny me Peter before the
[1:35:42] crows no he said he said one of one of
[1:35:46] you is going to deny me three times
[1:35:49] before
[1:35:51] theup Peter said
[1:35:54] you know Peter was very
[1:35:56] self-sufficient very of
[1:36:00] himself I love the Lord I love the
[1:36:03] message nobody can tell me I know what's
[1:36:06] right to do he won't even take it from
[1:36:08] the
[1:36:09] word Jesus said he said
[1:36:12] Lord and he was the
[1:36:15] one Jesus didn't mention his
[1:36:19] name if they all all of us
[1:36:23] I know they don't love you like I
[1:36:26] do they don't love the message like I
[1:36:29] do they're not loving their Apostle like
[1:36:31] I
[1:36:32] do they're not loving all your ministers
[1:36:35] like I
[1:36:35] do if they deny you I will not deny
[1:36:40] you Jesus knew Peter was
[1:36:44] oscillating between an intellectual
[1:36:46] understanding and a spiritual
[1:36:49] Revelation even though he had a
[1:36:51] spiritual revelation
[1:36:55] so having a spiritual Revelation doesn't
[1:36:58] keep you immune from the devil's
[1:37:01] attempts to pull you out of
[1:37:04] there how much less if all you have is
[1:37:08] an intellectual
[1:37:09] understanding so Peter said if they deny
[1:37:13] you I won't deny you and you said Peter
[1:37:17] you the man before the crosss you
[1:37:21] shall Den me three times
[1:37:23] me Lord not
[1:37:25] me if I will have to I will die for you
[1:37:30] that was Peter's
[1:37:32] desire he wasn't lying that's what he
[1:37:34] wanted to
[1:37:35] do hallelujah hallelujah Peter
[1:37:38] intellectually
[1:37:40] knew he should not deny the Lord
[1:37:43] intellectually
[1:37:44] knew that it was wrong for him to deny
[1:37:47] the Lord Peter was warned that you are
[1:37:51] warned not to do the wrong things that
[1:37:53] you do
[1:37:55] sometimes Peter was
[1:37:58] warn before they wrong ever confronted
[1:38:03] him and yet when they wrong confronted
[1:38:07] him watch what happened his emotions
[1:38:11] kicked
[1:38:12] in his emotions kicked in the young M
[1:38:16] said aren't you one of them Peter was
[1:38:20] faced with death he was faced with death
[1:38:24] his emotions
[1:38:26] fear the fear of
[1:38:30] [Applause]
[1:38:32] death and his
[1:38:34] emotions
[1:38:36] overpowered his intellectual
[1:38:39] understanding and his emotions control
[1:38:41] his
[1:38:42] behavior his emotions him to
[1:38:46] lie emotion him to tell a lie to curse
[1:38:50] to deny Jesus Christ to commit
[1:38:52] fornication whatever it is you atted to
[1:38:56] do and Peter said me I don't know that
[1:39:01] man a young girl a young girl and he had
[1:39:06] the Keys of the
[1:39:08] Kingdom a young girl could make him lie
[1:39:12] to make him curse to make him deny the
[1:39:15] Lord how many times you deny the
[1:39:19] Lord and you feel it doesn't matter how
[1:39:22] many times
[1:39:24] we let the fear of friends the fear of
[1:39:27] our boys and girls in
[1:39:29] school on the job in the
[1:39:33] neighborhood overpowers our
[1:39:36] emotions and we deny the
[1:39:39] Lord we curse we lie we do things we
[1:39:43] shouldn't
[1:39:45] do because we are afraid to be
[1:39:49] different the
[1:39:51] Lord another saw him
[1:39:54] and immediately Peter knew I Den the
[1:39:57] Lord he had warned me Peter fa next time
[1:40:02] I'm going to
[1:40:03] stand I going to stand
[1:40:07] intellectually he had heard the
[1:40:09] words his his intellectual
[1:40:12] Powers when play now when you operate
[1:40:17] realm you will always
[1:40:19] lose because your emotions will always
[1:40:23] over overow your intellectual
[1:40:27] understanding hear me real good your
[1:40:30] emotions will always overpower your
[1:40:34] intellectual
[1:40:37] understanding so right
[1:40:40] away
[1:40:43] another G I know you you are one of
[1:40:48] them
[1:40:50] fear fear shame of been a Gile been
[1:40:55] identified with Jesus intellectually he
[1:40:58] knew what was right intellectually he
[1:41:01] knew I should die for him I should say
[1:41:04] yes I'm one of them intellectually knew
[1:41:08] that but intellectual
[1:41:10] Powers were no match for his emotional
[1:41:16] Powers again Peter said no I don't know
[1:41:20] that
[1:41:21] man Jesus that man to him he wanted no
[1:41:27] identification your emotions will always
[1:41:30] overpower your intellectual
[1:41:33] understanding youve got to go beyond
[1:41:38] [Applause]
[1:41:45] that and Peter
[1:41:48] said it will not happen the third
[1:41:50] time isn't that how you are you do wrong
[1:41:55] nobody needs to tell you intellectually
[1:41:57] you know it's wrong to do those
[1:41:59] things you have been too well
[1:42:02] taught by the seven series and seven
[1:42:06] message of Malachi 4 to know the right
[1:42:10] thing to know how to think how to be how
[1:42:15] to speak how to behave
[1:42:18] yourself how you sisters to
[1:42:20] dress what company should keep you
[1:42:22] brother
[1:42:26] how you should be in the
[1:42:28] neighborhood and Peter fail is not going
[1:42:31] to happen
[1:42:32] again but while the emotions were not
[1:42:34] taken care
[1:42:35] of it happened the third
[1:42:38] time and when it happened the third
[1:42:41] time felt such a
[1:42:45] hopelessness it felt so
[1:42:47] useless I feel the
[1:42:49] Lord I feel the Lord
[1:42:53] let him
[1:42:54] down he saw Jesus walking up calvary's
[1:42:58] Mountain 2,000 years ago this
[1:43:02] Weekender
[1:43:04] WEP he said look at me that my is carry
[1:43:08] up carrying up the
[1:43:10] mountain and just to stand for him he
[1:43:13] wanted me he told me and I couldn't
[1:43:17] stand for me what's wrong with me what
[1:43:21] is wrong with me and P we bitly Peter
[1:43:25] was grieved at
[1:43:27] himself he was grieved at
[1:43:30] himself but being grieved at himself
[1:43:33] will not solve the
[1:43:35] problem being gried at yourself will not
[1:43:38] solve the problem because Jesus already
[1:43:41] solved the
[1:43:43] problem and
[1:43:44] Jesus the
[1:43:47] resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:43:49] Christ on Easter Sunday morning
[1:43:53] Easter Sunday morning up from the gravey
[1:43:56] AR with a magic triumph over his Force
[1:44:01] he arose a Victor from the dark
[1:44:05] domain to raise Peter up to raise Peter
[1:44:09] up hallelujah
[1:44:12] hallelujah and when he rose from the
[1:44:14] dead he knew Peter he knew Peter loved
[1:44:19] him he knew Peter didn't want to do the
[1:44:22] wrong
[1:44:23] he knew Peter needed an
[1:44:26] understanding of how to
[1:44:28] overcome of how to
[1:44:31] overcome so when he rose from the dead
[1:44:34] he said go tell
[1:44:36] Peter and my disciples that I will meet
[1:44:39] them in
[1:44:40] Galilee he's given
[1:44:43] Peter here's your lord is the god of the
[1:44:48] Second
[1:44:49] Chance is the god of the second chance
[1:44:54] he's going to give Peter a second chance
[1:44:58] he's going to try him
[1:45:00] again he's going to try him again if you
[1:45:04] have failed if you have failed the Lord
[1:45:07] don't be mad at
[1:45:09] yourself
[1:45:11] Joseph Joseph told his
[1:45:14] brothers don't be mad at
[1:45:16] yourself he said come near to
[1:45:19] me I am Joseph your brother
[1:45:24] I am Joseph Perfection your brother
[1:45:27] don't be M yourself come near to
[1:45:30] me and Jesus the reason resurrected Lord
[1:45:35] Jesus Christ the lord of isas said this
[1:45:39] morning Easter
[1:45:42] again it's Easter
[1:45:45] again is a resurrection morning in your
[1:45:48] soul a
[1:45:50] resurrection is here for you
[1:45:54] and you and you is is
[1:46:00] [Applause]
[1:46:08] again the
[1:46:10] reason resurrected Lord came to Peter to
[1:46:15] show him the victory how to overcome his
[1:46:19] emotions how to keep emotions under
[1:46:24] to get rid of the sex of the fornication
[1:46:29] of the L
[1:46:31] the
[1:46:33] Hallelujah
[1:46:36] again again tell your
[1:46:39] neighbor again tell your neighbor the
[1:46:44] resurrection morning is here
[1:46:47] [Applause]
[1:47:20] is it's sh
[1:47:21] again the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:25] the reason reason resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:47:30] Christ came to Peter and the same way he
[1:47:34] comes to you this
[1:47:36] morning he wants Peter to
[1:47:39] understand it's going to take
[1:47:41] more than your intellectual
[1:47:45] understanding that's only mental
[1:47:49] Faith this goes for the minister and the
[1:47:51] pulpit
[1:47:53] goes for the pastor go for the
[1:47:55] evangelist go for
[1:47:57] everybody go for the young Bo go for the
[1:48:00] young girl
[1:48:04] int is to help you on your
[1:48:08] way spiritual
[1:48:10] understanding because the victory the
[1:48:14] victory is hidden it is spiritual
[1:48:18] understanding spiritual
[1:48:20] Revelation which is real faith
[1:48:23] that
[1:48:24] recognizes only the word your
[1:48:27] intellectual understanding recognizes
[1:48:29] your emotions your intellectual
[1:48:31] understanding recognizes how you feel
[1:48:34] you like this one you don't like this
[1:48:37] one you feel good this one don't like me
[1:48:41] your intellectual understanding
[1:48:42] recognizes that but your spiritual
[1:48:46] Revelation your spiritual understanding
[1:48:49] recognizes only the word of God the word
[1:48:53] says and the word of God holds your
[1:48:56] emotions
[1:48:58] captive hold your reasoning Powers
[1:49:01] captive and your emotions line up behind
[1:49:04] the world your reasoning Powers line up
[1:49:07] behind the world oh hallelujah oh
[1:49:15] Hallelujah so Jesus he came to
[1:49:19] Peter and told him in the words
[1:49:23] that a spiritual understanding gives
[1:49:27] you because
[1:49:29] Peter in s Luke 16 Matthew
[1:49:32] 16 had a spiritual
[1:49:36] Revelation but here was Peter living
[1:49:39] like one who have no spiritual
[1:49:43] Revelation so even though you have a
[1:49:45] spiritual
[1:49:46] Revelation you still got to be on your
[1:49:48] toes it doesn't automatically
[1:49:52] make whatever you do to be
[1:49:55] right or whatever you say or whatever
[1:49:58] you
[1:49:59] preach spiritual
[1:50:01] Revelation recognizes only the word of
[1:50:06] God hallelujah it makes your emotions to
[1:50:09] shut
[1:50:10] up and recognize the word of
[1:50:13] God spiritual
[1:50:15] Revelation changes your
[1:50:18] thinking because as a man think in his
[1:50:20] help so is here
[1:50:23] spiritual Revelation aligns your
[1:50:26] thinking behind the word of God the word
[1:50:29] of God behind becomes your
[1:50:30] thinking not your emotions not what you
[1:50:35] feel not what you think somebody does to
[1:50:38] you but from the inside in your soul
[1:50:42] spiritual Revelation takes
[1:50:43] over from your control
[1:50:46] tower
[1:50:48] Hallelujah glory to God Amen so Jesus he
[1:50:53] told Peter when you were young when you
[1:50:56] were
[1:50:57] young you could do anything you want to
[1:51:01] do your intellect all the intellectual
[1:51:04] understanding thing is a lack of
[1:51:07] maturity because it only help you to
[1:51:10] understand that's not the end Insight

[1:52:32] emotions want to
[1:52:34] go and make your intellect to follow
[1:52:38] it for a spiritual
[1:52:40] revelation will lead you where the word
[1:52:42] of God wants you to go a spiritual
[1:52:46] Revelation changes your thinking a

[1:53:23] I can I will I can live this
[1:53:30] life
[1:53:32] because Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God
[1:53:36] that has returned to me as a revelation
[1:53:40] of the word of God of the seven spirits
[1:53:44] from the back of the Bible as my soul
[1:53:48] and is guiding me leading me to a death
[1:53:53] leading me to where I would not normally
[1:53:55] want to go but leading me into the
[1:53:58] statue of a perfect
[1:54:00] man Hallelujah Jesus was trying to show
[1:54:05] Peter feel your love feel your love will
[1:54:09] fail

[1:54:23] group you love those in your
[1:54:26] church you don't like that other
[1:54:29] Church your church is better than that
[1:54:32] other
[1:54:33] Church Lord that's what
[1:54:36] many of us Ser god with your love for
[1:54:41] the love of God he makes his son to
[1:54:45] shine on the just and the unjust he
[1:54:49] loves every man he loves everybody
[1:54:52] whether they in your group or they're
[1:54:54] not in your group whether they in the
[1:54:57] Thunders or they are not in the Thunders
[1:55:00] you love everybody the love of God
[1:55:03] that's
[1:55:04] maturity that's maturity GR in Grace

[1:55:12] spoke evil about
[1:55:13] you you should not love him you should
[1:55:17] avoid
[1:55:17] him the Holy
[1:55:20] Ghost love
[1:55:22] just F Your Love reasoning and emotions
[1:55:26] to shut up your God your father loves
[1:55:31] the just and the
[1:55:34] unjust your father tells you as much as
[1:55:37] he lies within you to live a peace with
[1:55:40] all
[1:55:42] men
[1:55:45] Hallelujah
[1:55:49] Hallelujah Jesus was showing Peter here
[1:55:52] because the third time Jesus asked him
[1:55:55] in feel your
[1:55:56] love do you like me because that's the
[1:56:00] life you leing Peter but want you come
[1:56:02] up
[1:56:03] either into aapa Lord charity that never
[1:56:09] fails Peter you've got to come up feel
[1:56:13] your love will always faill you love

[1:56:31] you feel your love will sin feel your
[1:56:35] love will
[1:56:38] rationalize love will give
[1:56:41] excuses but love a spiritual
[1:56:45] Revelation gives no
[1:56:47] excuses because it recognizes only the
[1:56:51] word of God and whatever is going to
[1:56:53] take is going to die that death
[1:56:58] of Glory to God
[1:57:00] Amen Oh Glory GL let me let me close
[1:57:04] this quot
[1:57:06] here
[1:57:08] H glory to God amen Amen brother bam is
[1:57:14] said here excuse me let me find this
[1:57:19] here uh
[1:57:24] Glory the message God provide a place of
[1:57:28] worship
[1:57:29] Lana
[1:57:32] 11265 I believe the church is beginning
[1:57:35] to hear the message and begin to
[1:57:37] understand it but friend listen we've
[1:57:40] got to lay in the presence of the
[1:57:42] son intellectual understanding lay
[1:57:46] that's that's to bring you in go further
[1:57:49] lay in the pr of the song
[1:57:52] nobody can do that for
[1:57:54] you you got to do that yourself we've
[1:57:57] got to be
[1:57:58] ripened
[1:58:00] maturity what Jesus was telling
[1:58:02] Peter our faith isn't
[1:58:05] ripe your mental Faith isn't ripe our
[1:58:09] faith isn't ripe we've got to lay in the
[1:58:11] Pres of the S we've got to be ripen our
[1:58:14] faith isn't ripe intellectually we
[1:58:17] hearing the
[1:58:18] message intellectually we are hearing
[1:58:21] the message that God has
[1:58:23] and seeing the signs that he showed us
[1:58:27] I'm proving it by the Bible it's there
[1:58:31] but oh how the church needs to lay in
[1:58:34] his
[1:58:35] presence till it tenders
[1:58:38] up you know and get sweet in the
[1:58:42] spirit so that he can B
[1:58:45] down sometimes in speaking the message
[1:58:48] you'll get H how to break in like that
[1:58:53] how's it breaking like that because you
[1:58:56] got to clch your nail to make it whole
[1:58:59] for once the church once gets
[1:59:02] it once the church once gets it that
[1:59:06] your intellect will faill you all the
[1:59:08] time because your emotions will always
[1:59:10] override
[1:59:13] it once you know that from here on out
[1:59:17] your emotions need to understand the
[1:59:20] word of God also
[1:59:22] your emotions to be under the control of
[1:59:25] the word of God and that
[1:59:27] happens by changing your
[1:59:30] thinking to begin to think from your
[1:59:34] soul from the word of God not from here
[1:59:39] whatever the word says that's what it
[1:59:42] is the word says sin shall not have
[1:59:47] dominion over
[1:59:49] you your emotion says that's not
[1:59:53] possible but the word says oh yes that
[1:59:56] is
[1:59:56] possible and that's what you
[1:59:59] say hallelujah and God will make your
[2:00:04] body obey your
[2:00:06] confession because when you say it once
[2:00:10] you say it your intellect lines up your
[2:00:13] emotions line up and you obey the word
[2:00:18] that's how it starts that's how it works
[2:00:22] you change your thinking of the
[2:00:23] matter where the devil tells you you
[2:00:27] cannot do it you cannot live above sin
[2:00:30] what does the word say the word says sin
[2:00:35] shall not have dominion over
[2:00:37] you you
[2:00:39] confess what the word says and when you
[2:00:43] say that God will make your emotions
[2:00:47] obey your
[2:00:48] confession God will make your intellect
[2:00:52] obey your confession and your body will
[2:00:54] line
[2:00:55] up where your emotions doesn't want to
[2:00:59] go your spiritual Revelation on the word
[2:01:02] of God gues it to go where the word
[2:01:05] wants you to
[2:01:06] go the statue of a perfect man oh
[2:01:10] Hallelujah we got a king's message is a
[2:01:13] king's message friends let's recognize
[2:01:15] it we have been called together together
[2:01:18] for the sign of the trumpet Glory God
[2:01:21] Amen
[2:01:22] hallelujah hallelujah said here
[2:01:25] hallelujah hallelujah amen is said too
[2:01:28] much of our faith is on Blasphemous
[2:01:32] names and the biggest part of our faith
[2:01:36] of all these Revelations we are talking
[2:01:37] about is mental faith and intellectual
[2:01:41] understanding you can explain all the
[2:01:44] Thunders all the seven Spirit from the
[2:01:46] back of the Bible the prophet said a lot
[2:01:50] of it
[2:01:52] mental
[2:01:53] Faith by hearing the word of God it
[2:01:56] brings us to a mental recognition of
[2:01:59] God same thing intellectually we
[2:02:02] understanding the
[2:02:03] word but but if this coming from above
[2:02:10] coming from charity above that se in the
[2:02:14] soul seven
[2:02:16] perfect a spiritual
[2:02:19] Revelation Glory father if that re ever
[2:02:23] strikes this there a Godly spiritual
[2:02:27] Faith then what does that Faith do what
[2:02:31] does that spiritual Faith
[2:02:33] do that Faith recognizes only the word
[2:02:36] of God no matter what anything else
[2:02:40] says it only recognizes the
[2:02:42] word because in the beginning was the
[2:02:44] word and the word his God and the Word
[2:02:48] was God and the word is still God and
[2:02:52] the Word was made flesh and dwell Among
[2:02:56] Us and when the word
[2:02:58] itself when the word itself when the
[2:03:02] word itself is
[2:03:04] pouring into a spiritual Faith like it
[2:03:08] was pouring into Adam's spiritual faith
[2:03:12] in Genesis
[2:03:14] 126 and mental Faith becomes a spiritual
[2:03:19] Revelation so understanding the word by
[2:03:22] mental faith is to bring you to this
[2:03:25] spot to where your mental Faith changes
[2:03:29] into a spiritual Revelation and a
[2:03:31] spiritual Revelation only recognizes the
[2:03:34] word you don't stand for no falsehood it
[2:03:38] don't stand for no false teachings it
[2:03:40] don't stand for yourself doing wrong
[2:03:42] stuff
[2:03:46] either and Jesus said Upon This Rock
[2:03:51] upon this I'll build my
[2:03:52] church see not upon a mental conception
[2:03:56] of church
[2:03:57] joining not upon a mental conception of
[2:04:01] that but upon the
[2:04:04] Revelation when them streams of
[2:04:06] Grace are SP into that mental
[2:04:10] faith that intellectual understanding
[2:04:12] that you've
[2:04:14] got upon
[2:04:16] this when the spiritual
[2:04:19] Revelation takes over your mental faith
[2:04:23] Hallelujah and the word of God
[2:04:26] hallelujah amen then upon this spiritual
[2:04:30] Revelation I will build my church and
[2:04:33] the Gates of
[2:04:35] Hell cannot Prevail against
[2:04:38] it loss of the eyes loss of the flesh
[2:04:41] the pr of life will never Prevail
[2:04:44] against you that's not your pastor's
[2:04:46] words that's the words of the Lamb of
[2:04:49] God who takes away the sins of the world
[2:04:54] fornication adultery evil suing habits
[2:04:58] drugs never Prevail against a spiritual
[2:05:03] revelation God Amen oh

[2:05:20] faith recognize only the
[2:05:23] word you fish out the false word you
[2:05:26] don't stand for
[2:05:30] it no matter what anybody else says it
