three ministering Brethren brother Andrew alasa we have a brother Elijah Akin Yi and we have brother Pastor olulu so we greet you all we welcome you all in our little humble [Applause] Tabernacle we have brother Brent here also from maruga God bless you [Applause] brother so the scripture that is most convenient tonight is Ephesians 4:11 and he gave some Apostles and some pastors and some evangelists uh some Prophets he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers that the most for the perfecting of the Saints everybody that is the scripture that we are gathered here under so I came to the Lord in I was baptized in 1974 November and in 1975 October brother Carl the pastor was asking for some young Brothers to give an exhortation who feel they have a call on their lives and so Brothers went up and I was the last one I went up October the 10th 1975 so that's less than a year in the message went and give a little exhortation and they found it was the Lord had helped me by God's grace and then another one in December there and uh in January I can't remember the date of 76 that just a year and a couple months in the message I came we had five Services a week in them days all right Saturday was a a prayer night for who wants to come Saturday evening we had Tuesday Thursday Friday Sunday and Saturday so Friday night I came into the service and uh when I came into the service I realized that bral wasn't there the pastor wasn't there and they said that he has uh he left the church with in my hands oh my I Minister twice I exalt a year and something in the message he left the church in my hands so I had to carry on that night by Grace by God's grace and we were studying now because one of the nights Thursday night was like tape study so we were studying blasphemer names right so I had to carry home the tape now in them days a tape is a big player player is a big thing that you had to live LIF up and you have big reels on it everybody know the big reel that in them days January 76 so I carried it home to study blasphemer names because I had to continue from where Bara left off he will play a portion and then explain give some light on it and so I for me have to try and do follow suit so I carried it home and when I put it on it had a a I don't know if it's a interpretation of tongues or some prophetic utterance but there was something in the beginning of Blasphemous names on that old big reel that is not on the present day one and it was a commission and with my with with my little where I was there it was like something talking to me calling me now into the ministry now brother da on Saturday night ministered a masterpiece for those who were there it was a masterpiece and the title was the title was the shepherd's business and and that is why I was studying Lord what could I say to introduce brother Dy and then I something said the commission go to the commission so I'm going to play the commission for you tonight and that is my little introduction of brother da and for the service here tonight how many love the Lord Jesus Christ let's just bow our heads almighty God as we thank you for your divine presence thank you for brother ID Lord bringing the ministers down here to have this little time of rejoicing with us thank you for all the local ministers assembled Lord may you bless them all bless their wives bless their congregations and bless our time in your presence may you anoint your man servant in a special way and use him Lord like a ball of fire for our hearts here tonight how we love you we give you all praise and thanks may you forgive us all our trespasses and may the blood of the Lamb cover us from all unrighteousness and cleanse us from all unrighteousness we ask all this in Jesus Christ love and adorable name amen how many can say Amen here tonight how many can say Amen one more time glory to God in the highest glory to God in the highest so this Commission started with I'm calling for Shepherds my son so that is why I was there saying I wonder if I will be a Shepherd one day so that is why I'm playing it because his message was the shepherd's business his message on Saturday night the shepherd's business lifting the great Shepherd and then showing us that we as sheep have something to do also so this is just in honor of the Holy Spirit using him on Saturday night so God bless you as you listen to it this is the introduction for brother da so we just have some of the words there as far as we could catch the words these are the words so God bless you I'm calling for sheph my son to go out and gather my sheep into my PO that I might have a time of rejoicing I come to receive my people but my sons accept you hear my call and come before me and dedicate your to me your talents your gifts and the callings I've given to you truly my sons I cannot bless I cannot send those that will not come under my jurisdiction I cannot send those that will not be obedient to my calling I cannot send the ones that have not believe my word I cannot send the those that will not accept the challenge that I'm putting before my church from day to day and from time to time I'm calling my son withold not from me the challeng that I bestowed upon you because I have no one to stand except you go I have no one that I can put my hand on except you put your your vessel in my hand that I might look into it and see if there's anything unclean that I might rebuke it and cast it out as you come before me in confession and repentance of the things that you have done so my son dedicate to me a new this day your spirit your mind and your body that you might be a chosen elect and called out because I Desir my son to stand out from this of people are Mighty of sech of my spirit to take this message of faith and deliverance and healing in this last here at your mou because I have need my sons of many to speak my word many have fallen away my sons and I have brought my my R against them because they have fallen away once having tasted the truth and KN my word yet they have fallen away because their hearts are F because they fear man more than they fear of me so

help us oh Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] amen the Lord bless you all amen amen glad to be in the house of the Lord uh tonight uh I we humbly request that we read our Bibles then we can take the comfort of our seat and we trust the Lord for what he has for us amen if you have your Bible with you please stand with me to very familiar scriptures Romans chapter 8 verse 28 and then we shall also read Proverbs 1921 Romans chapter 8 verse 28 if we are there say amen amen and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God Amen to them who are de called according to his purpose amen amen yeah Proverbs 19 Proverbs 19 just one verse verse 21 it says there are many devices in a man's heart nevertheless the counsel of the Lord that shall stand amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his holy word God bless you you may please be seated all right so tonight if the Lord will be our he which I trust to him a will I just want to uh encourage us on something the Lord impressed strongly upon my heart and uh the prophet in one of the messages call it the beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God yeah when it was describing it he said the purpose of God can never be defeated and they call it the beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God so I want to speak on the purpose of God tonight I know many years ago I spoke on a subject I'm sure maybe it will be at Bethlehem Tabernacle on that the purpose of God might stand but tonight we want to speak on the purpose of God itself amen and I trust that the Lord will bless us all right uh before I start jumping or running I want to patiently read one or two quotations here for a background uh in the message Expressions 62- 0313 62- 0313 paragraph 10 if it's the same the prophet said and everything is here to serve a purpose everything amen even in this room tonight everything you are seeing here they weren put here for a decoration amen they are put here because they have a purpose they are serving they have a function they are performing from the mic to the pulpit to the speakers to the pianos to the instruments to the uh what you call it the technology here everything is here to serve a purpose even the air conditioners it serving the purpose cooling us just as we are here to serve a a purpose amen we are all here for a purpose of God we are all here for a purpose of God now I want you to watch the language of the Prophet here he said if we can find what that purpose is and then serve it well you and I are not going to invent a purpose for ourselves we are not going to design a purpose for our lives purpose is beyond you the reason we burn energy and we waste our time and life becomes frustration is because we are trying to do what God has already done the domain of God is developing or designing a purpose for every life please underline it in your heart and to make it simple for you I will make it easy now this mic that I'm holding in my hand is not the one that created or manufactured itself are you with me sir a producer produced this mic now what informed the production is a need to be met somebody sat down and say if we can make create something or produce something that can amplify the voice of a speaker it will make a large audience to hear him without straining his [Applause] voice I want to make it as simple because I've got friends here who must get it they've been encouraging me since we came they will come and tell me I enjoy that service you made it so simple so I'm conscious of them I'm now our reviv is under 20s so if you are above 20 you would need to come down to our level all right okay God bless you all right but I hope you are getting it now they said let's make something that we amplify people's voice now when they were conceiving this this has not been made but it was that conception that fashioned this it was that conception that invented the production of this so the purpose of these existed before it was made are you with me and if I bring it to you because all I'm saying tonight is a story of your life life if I bring it to you amen God who created you and I found a gap or a void to be filled and he looked in his eternal touch because brother Braham said purpose is an eternal plan and you will agree with the prophet because we also thought that everything God wanted to think about he thought before it started time in other word before Genesis 1 that says in the beginning God created heaven and earth in the beginning shows the beginning of time are you catching it before that beginning everything God wanted to have he already had [Applause] God is not presently thinking and the thought he has had cannot be improved upon cannot be adicted cannot be cannot be Abed or upgraded amen if it's suceptible to death then God will not be God it is those who know better that upgrades their thinking God does not know better he is the Ancient of Days so before he started time all the thinking he wanted to have he already had so each day is an expression of his eternal thoughts and I'm so happy to tell you tonight that you were part of that thought but God doesn't think God doesn't think for nothing he thought of you because he has the purpose for you to serve your purpose was the reason you were here when God looks he said okay there must be somebody to F this gap for me and you see each person is unique in its own purpose that is why I don't believe in accidental birth or a conception by mistake that is the thought of a man those things don't come by mistake they comes by God's [Applause] predestination you did not happen by accident you came because God wanted you to come there couldn't have been enough contraceptives of Family Planning that will have prevented your birth because God has a purpose for you to come and [Applause] serve so your purpose was the reason that you were created your purpose existed before you exist you were only brought to fill in that purpose and don't just think about it spiritually even physically in all your daily work of life amen the Reason God brought you is because there's a purpose that you must serve now if you agree with that then it follows that I am not responsible for my purpose somebody is responsible for it so I Will Not Waste My Time designing one or trying to invent one what I need to do is to find let's bring that quotation and see what the prophet said you must discover your purpose it will make life a lot easier for you okay bring the quotation my brother God bless you it said we are all here for a purpose of God yeah if we can find what that purpose it not if we can design one not if we can develop one you don't make yourself who you are the one who brought you made you who you are and he made you uniquely amen and let me tell you it doesn't have replacement for you it doesn't have he doesn't have an alternative I'm not fantasizing you I mean every word of that you know it is human being the concept of Alternatives shows human limitations because we are not in charge of every factors of life but we are dealing with somebody who knows the hen from the beginning we are dealing with somebody who has the length and breadth of all situations so if it takes a decision it is permanent that is why King Solomon said whatsoever the Lord has done it shall be forever no man can Hur to it no man can take away from it but God has done it that made me fear before [Applause] him so if we can find what that purposes and serve it well that is always a challenge of mankind brother Braham spoke of Daniel he said Daniel had only one purpose he said he purposed to do the purpose of God that's a quotation he proposed to do the purpose of God that whatever God has ordained me for whatever he brought me here for brother brah said somebody is responsible for your in [Applause] [Music] here so what you and I need to do is to go back to him if times are blurry if the road is not clear why am I here and brother brah said in the in the message I have Sinister star he said for an act that will be honest sincere and will believe God has a way of revealing his mind [Music] [Applause] oh what peace we often forfeit oh what needless pain we bear oh what struggles we make because we did not find our purpose we are just we are just working let me tell you when God give rest he gives rest he said come unto me all you that labor and a Heavenly Laden and I will give you rest he said for my yoke is easy and my burden is light if you want an easy Yol if you want a light burden you must come to Jesus to find out the reason that he brought you [Applause] [Music] here you love him all right I will hang it here first I will hang it here first but don't take it away if we can find that purpose and serve it well now every creation under Heaven God brought them for either of these two things you are either brought for the purpose of God or brought for a purpose for [Applause] God all is purpose you are either brought for a purpose for the purpose of God or for a purpose for God don't worry I will prove my case in the message Christ is the mystery of God God revealed the prophet said God has a three-fold purpose is that right he wants to reveal himself he wants to have preeminence in the body of those who accepted the revelation of himself and by that preeminence he will restore them back to Hidden are you C it threefold purpose so if you enjoyed all the three lessons you are not enjoying it by chance you are enjoying it by predestination you are in the purpose of God because God is using you to express and to tell the story of his Redemption [Applause] plan is that clear enough but now there are those who will make this expression these manifestations necessary because God in the beginning the prophet taught us that before we could even call him God he had at the back part of his mind a desire to be God then he wasn't he didn't have people to worship him neither Angel no people like me and you amen but he also desire them to be known Beyond being God because when you know him as God Alone the relationship will be a bit formal but he wants something personal something Beyond formal something that you can relate [Applause] with so this is why he decided that apart from being known before be be as God I also want to be known in all my abilities which in spiritual language we call attributes what are his abilities he has the ability to save he can heal it can redeem it can deliver and many more it can provide but you see God is a god of perfection amen and it takes imperfection to make those ability [Applause] necessary are you catching it it takes imperfection to make those abilities attributes necessary so what will God do he must design a creator for a purpose of bringing imperfection to make the expression of his attribute necessary now the Creator that will make it necess necessary will not be a partaker of the blessings of it amen but those who are in the purpose of God will be the beneficiaries of every attribute from their soul to their Spirit to their body are you catching it so that was God's Divine Design and that is why you will hear the prophet say and when Satan has brought to pass that which is necessary to the purpose of God Satan bringing to pass that which is necessary to God's Own purpose but Satan will not be a partaker he will not be a beneficiary but it will make it necessary so Satan is designed for a purpose for [Applause] God okay let me bring it let me bring it a little home to you again you remember in the first Exodus God was going to bring Redemption the prophet said he going to bring Redemption by power he going to he going to bring Redemption by Blood and by power but here was a people dwelling so much at peace and do not feel the need for a redeemer because life was good economy was prospering there was no time they were crying up onto God then the Bible said for this cause I raised Pharaoh a pharaoh was raised to not know the blessings of Joseph and he started afflicting afflicting the people of their benefactor and that made Israel to start crying brother brah said it started from the house of amam and jobed and I trust to God that we will be proper influences somebody had a burden for the entire church and he started praying the prophet said his wife was saying why does it have to be you alone and he said but it's got to start with somebody I want that kind of Revival a a Revival that start with somebody a Revival of prayer a Revival of holy living a Revival of having burden for lost souls committing to spiritual things it started from the house of hram and brother Braham said it began to spread from family to family and as it was spreading the power of prayer were gathering momentum and Defying Gravity and Defying Gravity until God said in Exodus chapter 3 or chapter 12 that I have had the [Applause] Cry of my people and I am come down he came down to bring Redemption because Pharaoh upset so Pharaoh was in the purpose for God to make the purpose of God fulfilled in the life of Exodus [Applause] people you see when you understand this as a Believer you don't even have problem with anybody you know why no matter what they do amen is just pushing you to your blessings if you want the virtues of God God will bring certain people in your life to try you to give you a push to give you an Affliction and in the process you are developing attitude for prayer you are cultivating attitude for patience you are becoming more temperate Hallelujah they are designed for a purpose for God so that the purpose of God could be done in your life are you getting it because you must know the side you belong in this whole program amen you are hinder in the purpose of God in the purpose of God or in a purpose for God wonderful you love him all right amen so I'm talking to those who are in the purpose of God tonight let's leave the other guys because their life does not give us more virtues but the life of the believer will provoke us unto good work Holiness and righteousness now in this design God also design your abilities this is why all of us will not be the same but guess what our reward is the [Applause] same you know why in your unique design your job your function your purpose is as important as the other fellow let me take it back to physical again so you can relate when they designed vehicles for horse they had the purpose that we need to get something mechanically they can move people from one point to the other isn't it all right then they began to look at it we need to move five people with their little luggages we don't need more than a four-cylinder engine okay if we we want to move something more maybe not necessarily H more passengers but more load or we want it to be a bit balanc and faster six cylinder then it came to 8 cylinder for those who like to tow their what do you call it doing Towing you know the all those mobile houses and everything you tow it says start from eight cylinders then you have the ones that are 24 verbs 12 cylinders and he could even go as far as 26 28 30 something cylinders each of them is unique in their own way and they are brought to serve different purposes no one is much more important than the other amen the one you get is the one that suits your purpose are you catching it that is the way it is also in the kingdom when you understand that there will be no competition you will realize that that transmission gear is as important as the O2 sensor or the O2 sensor that may sound insignificant it can stop your vehicle on the road and you will need a specialist to move it because it's as important as the other one this is the way it is also in the body of Christ no one is insignificant brother brah said there is no useless part in God's body if you are not a preacher maybe you our prayer [Applause] Warrior when King David when David received the revelation of this he said Lord I'm even pleased to be a door match if that is my purpose let everybody step on me to come into the house of the Lord that's a man who understood the revelation of [Applause] purpose don't forget also when made those Vehicles they make them to have endurance capacities because that is why some are designed for rough terrains you will call them 4 by4 with propensity to even lift up when the terrain gets so bad it's a design for its own purpose each of us as we're here tonight we have gra capacities to manage successes of our purpose and endurance capacity to manage challenges and temptations and trials that come with our purpose so this is why when certain things are happening to you and is not happening to the other person tell your soul right it's because of my purpose hallah did you hear me did you hear me liberate your heart tonight let the word set you free tonight in the body of Christ there's no pity party whatever comes your way is because of the purpose that you are designed for some through the waters some through the fire some through the flood but all through the blood it's all about [Applause] purpose your challenges do not come because it is you my brother they come to attack your purpose [Applause] when God rearranged oh man okay when he arranged the blessings of the first born in the matter of Reuben I mean know Reuben was the first born of Israel but because of immoral living oh don't be immoral Brothers don't be Mar sister there's direct warnings from the scripture he said do not be a profane person or a fornicator like Esau we should still preach that uhhuh hujjah we should still preach that because in the body of Christ don't worry about my throwing jacket I'm not going to I'm fighting the devil we should still preach that because in that body of Christ Holiness will not be a phrase in their mouth it will be their way of life and it is the word that purifies it is the word that cleanses amen let's keep our vessels pure unto the Lord he said do not be a profane person or a fornicator like Esau now Esau did not commit fornication but he was very profane profanity is taking Divine instructions lightly it say it doesn't matter and a lot of us are on that lane and that is why we turn more to the word than to the to the world than to the word there's a difference in there the hell that makes the difference is the life the life you live this way tells if you are in the world or in in the world are you following all right we must take Divine instruction strictly we must embrace it even if your life is not matching on meet truth first brother brah said when the Lord spoke about that coporation woman he said she said true Lord he said Faith admit the word is the truth it is the admittance of truth that will set you free so even if your life is not right admit the word is true you are wrong you on your road to recovery God bless you God bless you God bless you but Reuben was guilty of fornication and when he became guilty of that being the first born God took all the three blessings away from him a firstborn in Israel by the law of God had three inheritances the birthright the priesthood and the rulership is got those three things the birthright will make him to be the provider and the soer for the entire family are you getting it so but Reuben lost the three according to the scriptures first or 2 Chronicles chapter 5 you will find it there if God help us along the line we could dwell more that now he lost the birthright to Joseph he lost the priesthood to Levi and he lost the rulership to Judah at the end of the day he had nothing this is why you must sh the wrong and do the right some things may not tamper with your eternity listen to me church but they will cost you a great deal in [Applause] life all right so when God announced the reassignment of birth right that announcement was the reason for Joseph seeing the dreams that he saw because if you read in the blessings of the birth right that Isaac placed upon Jacob he said let all the your brethren your de the the children of your parents bow down to thee be thou their soer be th their provider that was what God was simply announcing and that thing alone the purpose that Joseph will serve exposed him to Danger all the problems that Joseph went through in life was because of that purpose all the challenges that you will go through is because of your purpose that is why yours may be peculiar from mine but I want to give you this Comfort all of us are under the blood as long as remain under the blood we are covered how come how come it was when Moses was born that Pharaoh suddenly said go and kill all the male children he had an idea that his Nemesis has been born but he's not a good sniper Satan is too dull for my liking if he was a good sniper you know what he should have narrowed it to the person but he killed several children in the hope of getting Moses and he never called Moses but why was that challenge coming simply because of his purpose I'm saying it again the reason you go through things you go through is because of your purpose but I have a good news for you the one who created you for that purpose has also put it in you the endurance capacity the rugged capacity the great [Applause] capacity you see you see the faithfulness of the scripture when Paul was talking to the church he said there's no temptation that comes unto you that is uncommon he said but God is faithful how many say God is faithful tonight how many say God is faithful God is God is faithful who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able to [Applause] Bear did you catch something there you already won before the Temptation came because God allowed it because he knows you can handle it when he created you he knew what he put in you the enduring capacity the grace for it God will not design you for a purpose without God giving you the ability to handle the purpose is that the Scripture it will not allow you to be tempted above what you can bear that is why Christians will laugh in the face of their adversary they will laugh in the face of their Temptation they are bold to say Satan bring it on if God I permit you it's because it's in me and he that is in you is greater than he is greater than that sin is greater than that besetting sin is greater than that trial is greater than that trouble I'm just trying to make you see your [Applause] inheritance don't you see how positive Mo Joseph was throughout his trouble nothing could break him they they threw him in the dungeon when they F him out it was still the vibrant Joseph that was why wherever he went the Seal of God the beauty of God the Excellency of God was going with him if he has become a pity party a degenerate he will not be attractive for potifa no his wife but he looked at his problem in the face I said Lord I may not know why I may not know how but I know one thing all things work together this is why Paul said and we know it's a revelation it's a knowing that all things must work together for your good look let me tell you friends when you when you show a positive attitude to God he will reveal your purpose and he will give you strength he will give you Grace look when the Brethren of Joseph came come on God with tell their eyes but God opened the eyes of Joseph he could recognize them is that right and the word of the Lord began to fulfill they began to Bow as God said he will amen now you will say maybe it was because they didn't know him that was why they did that amen but after their father died and they buried their father and they came back they formed an association of guilty brothers who found it out to accept their forgiveness it's in your Bible they said now that the common denominator the common thing between us and Joseph is dead he will not visit us over our over what we did and they formed an association of guilty Brothers walking softly and humbly and knowing Joseph was Joseph they still bow because do here the Lord can never f the purpose of God can never be defeated there are many devices in the heart of man but the counsel of God it shall stand and here is a beautiful one you know what Joseph told them Joseph told them he said Brethren you are taking this thing too far you are taking it too far I have long forgotten about this matter how long will you hold yourself in guilt God has long forgotten you forgiven you stop holding yourself in guilt those of you who are waiting for Audible Voice you will be difficult to accept your forgiveness you know why because what God wanted to do for you he has already done brother Braham said if he came here tonight and you will walk up to him and say Lord Heal Me or Lord forgive me he will not mind you and if he Minds you at all he will say what you want me to do I have already done what you need to do is to accept accept tonight accept Hallelujah accept your forgiveness accept your pardon so you can serve your purpose let me tell you if God designed you for anything that thing is undefeatable your ignorance your ignorance May afflict you your target missing may suffer you but you will still do it Hallelujah Joseph told his Brethren I understand what was happening you thought you persecuted me but guess what all that you did come on was the way of God sending me it was the Lord sending me to come and preserve your lives and those of your family once you have that Revelation you will have no problem with any man it will be easy to forgive and difficult to be bitter can we begin to look at the benefits in our adversaries can we begin to look at it because God may allow somebody to do something to you just to watch how you are going to react and your reaction will tell the father is growing or he hasn't learned his lesson don't stunt your growth because there are grounds to possess so we'll have capacity to deal with our purpose and this purpose can never be what Defeated come on brother brah said nothing can destroy us so your purpose will preserve [Applause] you you are preserved by your purpose he said nothing can destroy us until the purpose for which God brought us here for is accomplished if we are destroyed before our purpose is done God failed and God cannot fail do you see what they put there and if we are put here for a purpose then there is nothing that can destroy us the fire couldn't destroy the three brw children the Lions couldn't hit up [Applause] Daniel because of purpose when Pharaoh went on the Rampage and he started killing the male children God came to the family of amram and J be he said you've kept that boy long enough I want to take the battle higher I'm taking the battle to the enemies Camp I want to tell Satan that is not in the picture I am the one that let it I am the one that refused to let it is my counsel that shall stand he said release the boy to me brother brah said AMR will be like eh and God will say if you keep him you will lose him but if you leave him for me you will have him and the family released the boy amen they put him in a crib in a basket crib and put put him on Riv Nile River Nile is a river of crocodiles I don't know where the crocodiles were or what they were looking when Moses helplessly was gliding through River n purpose purpose your purpose will protect you your purpose will preserve you nothing can destroy you nothing can harm you don't live in fear stop living in fear stop living in anxiety amen if God has a purpose for you he will equip you he will supply all that is necessary to serve your purpose by the way by the way remind me I will come to Moses I must come back but by the way if you bought a car uh-huh is it the car's problem to worry about fil is it the car's problem to worry about service oil change repair whose problem your own problem my my my my so you know that but you cannot also conceit to God to take his own problem they the car will serve you as long as you are taking care of it amen the car will serve its purpose as long as you are taking care then we have God who promis to take care of us he said I will never leave you nor forsake you I will be with you even to the end of the world he said take no thought for what to eat what to drink where which shall you be clothed he said your heavenly father knows that you need these things can't we trust [Applause] him hallu will maintain you for the purpose he brought you to serve you see if we don't get right we will be sweating for nothing but if we can find the purpose of God oh it is you season and God working through you I'm telling you you must come to that level of Grace in faith that you look up to him for every need and whether you say it 10 times or just one time you know he's taking care of it if God can take you to a level that you don't even pray about it you just wake up and say I know he will take care he will fix it you will tell your soul don't worry the Lord will make a way Som that is a level of relationship that he wants to have with you trust me did he not say cast all your cares did he not say so how come we take our B to the Lord and take it back he said take your burden to the Lord and leave it there in the court of God there is no appeal find Grace to hand it in don't struggle with God he will do what he has to do it's a promise are you worried about your life let me tell you it is your purpose that purifies you did you hear me I mean every word of that God brought you here to serve a purpose what did Jesus spoke about the tree he said let us PCH the tree that he may bear more fruit is that scripture because the purpose of the tree is to bear fruit for whatever purpose God has for you he is ready to clean you he's ready to keep you holy and in the shape to serve that purpose if you dress right your dressing right is not what makes you holy it is the purpose that dressing right is serving to show to the people of the world that there's a generation that will not defile themselves that will not be vulgar your life preaches to your environment and the prophet said through your testimony your environment will be brought to judgment the Judgment of God is your own word against the [Applause] [Music] unbeliever oh God have you and I God help you and I amen GL now God was taking Moses all the crocodile in River went asleep they went into coma even Miriam a young lady perhaps barefooted in the water they a crocodile should have smell a passive her and say Here Comes our food free of charge but let me tell you tonight both of them are not crocodiles meat they are a carrier of purpose and they must accomplish it otherwise no way and guess what we we get we God let Hallelujah this God is too how do we describe him now he L the creep straight to the enemy's camp and he made sure he made sure it was the daughter of the enemy that discovered the crib and God went further he did not hide the identity of that boy he revealed to that woman he said this is an Hebrew child an Hebrew child so how come she did not strangle her how come she did not suffocate her how come she did not order her to be cut into pieces because that is a child that is an enemy of the Kingdom but because of purpose that can never be defeated instead instead of killing the boy the Lord sent a spirit of love he said this one won't die he's my own [Music] let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me his wonderful passion and Purity oh thou Spirit divine all my nature refine your purpose will preserve you nothing can take you until what God brought you here for is accomplished I'll have le you I have m you are precious in the sight of the Lord and like I said God is not going to replace you you say prove that did he replace Moses No Moses started it and he started it wrong is that the scripture because what Moses wanted to do will have broken the word of God I call your attention to this in Genesis chapter 15 when God was conventing entering into convenant with Abraham he told him your children will sojourn in a land that is not theirs for 400 years did he say so then he said after words in other words 400 years must be complete then maybe 41 402 or 400 years and 6 months or even 500 years that is afterwards I must clear that because some people are preaching that there's a possibility for do the Lord to fail to me that is [Music] Blasphemous they said because God said he will deliver them 400 years but they spend [Music] 430 God didn't say we deliver them on 400 years he said they will soj for okay God bless you is it this and he said unto them uhhuh and they shall afflict them how many years did he say so all right bring it up again give us the next let's continue and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and what and shall they come out with great substance so 400 years will be fully right anything can now happen after 400 100 years is that the scripture but now when Moses failed is that right and it went away for how many years0 40 years if you take 40 years out of 430 what will you have 390 so Moses wanted to deliver Israel before the appointed Covenant time God watches over his word to perform it that will have broken the scriptures that will have broken the Covenant and that was why God said Cal down you see you can never love the people of God more than God loves them to Moses to Moses God was too insensitive how could he be seeing what's going on and and not do anything about it he will do it he will do do it he's watching his word everything must come in order hallelujah amen so when Moses left for 400 years for 40 years the matter passed God could have found somebody he never found nobody amen who was taking care of Israel in those length of time the same God because in God's touch the plan he designed for it was Moses and he must come back to do that job you will do your job I don't care how long some of you stray out let me tell you young people your destiny lays in this [Music] message did you hear me your destiny your success Your Glory your fulfillment lays in this message you were not brought into heat either by bet or by strin inside for nothing I don't care how many years you wonder when the Lord is ready he will bring you back and perhaps it's ready for some of you tonight come home son come home daughter because you are only wasting time you are only afflicting yourself amen the purpose of God for your life can never be [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] defeated I think we've got to some climax let me be winding down GL Glory Glory Glory don't tempt me brother I can preach till the next morning this is the only thing I do in my life and I enjoy it so much you love him sometimes sometimes listen to this God finds on you usual part God use unusual method I'm going to startle you now to bring his purpose to pass when God was sending Jonah to ninev the purpose of God in God's mind was for Nev to be saved right right right he only wanted Jonah to go and give them a message of shaking to bring them to awareness look at the body language tongue language of God he wasn't interested in the destruction of ninev but he was using dealing with a servant who had problem with that you say how do you know read your Bible Jonah said so Jonah was a man of God who wanted to preach Hellfire Brimstone and judgment and see it happen right there to him it should be the Vindication God said okay that's fine that's fine so that was why when God when he repented Jonah was not happy is it not in your Bible he said I know this is what was going to happen oh God help us Servants of God now we must preach with the love of God in our heart you know brother Braham said it can be frustrating when you preach and do all you can and people are not changing it's a quotation it said it can be frustrating but you see God has called you into the ministry because he knows you have the capacity to deal with the frustration open yourself open yourself to Grace and everything will be all right these were the frustrations that made the prophet to call some of those children rickes and Rickers shut up and God had to come and say ah please I beg of you they are my children don't call them Ricky and Rick find a better language brother said I was getting into complex you see if the great prophet of God would experience that I need to ask for Grace every [Applause] [Music] day anyway anyway God's purpose Hallelujah cannot be defeated and cannot change so here is God sending Jonah but as a gods to the B off now you will say Jonah disobeyed or went out of the will of God it is you saying like that there's no quotation from that no the message as a matter of fact the prophet presented it very rudely to us he said it was never out of the will of [Applause] God and I kept following that statement until I saw where the Prophet said it was God that told him to enter the ship to [Applause] tou yeah I will show you if you want he told him to enter the ship [Music] so Jonah felt pleased he was in the ship to Tes but do you know what God wanted to do because he was determined to save the people of nin brother Brown made a powerful statement he says sometimes you do things and you are wondering why did I do such a thing you even think maybe is wrong and yet it is God working come on now the way God knew Nev will get the message to bring repentance is the way God was fashioning if Jonah entered the ship to Nev direct and he got there the wish of Jonah will come to pass because Nev will never accept the gospel so God said go to Tes and the man was pleased enjoying rejoicing in himself that last what nonsense I won't go waste my time but as they go the Lord who told him to enter the ship to tou allow the wind and storm to be released because the real transport that will make the job effective so when the storm was going on everybody was doing all they can the Man For Whom the storm was happening was as cool as cucumber he was even sleeping until they say who is this unusual passenger you mean this storm is not your own headache say it's not my headache being prophet in knew what was happening and he gave them solution they felt more spiritual than the solution he said if you want this storm to come throw me into the water they say God forbid you better do what the prophet says to be spiritual is to be scriptural [Music] and they kept suffering until they said Lord it is the man who said we should put him there don't require his Blow from our hand and when they throw him the prepared vehicle to take him to where God wants to make the ministry effective just [Applause] came if you think the mouth of a whale is too small it's a special wh amen if you think it's a sharkk it's a special one whichever way you call it all I know is that God sent a fish and he swallowed Jonah when he swallowed Jonah God was working on him for three days and three nights mellowing him with the me with the grace the compartment to handle the sermon with a passion now in the land of Nev what they worship is fish God the prophet does the story are you with me what they worship is fish God so as they saw a big God of theirs approaching majority of them gathered to hear what the God will say and when the god came small small god brother brah said he opened his mouth and released his tongue for a breach and Jonah walked out and started preaching repent repent hey it's a Cas the God had spoken God had spoken God has spoken and everything and everybody repented Hallelujah was the purpose of God not accomplished he was in unusual way in mysterious ways is wonders to perform that explains sometimes the unusual things in your life that brings you to a point you said I did not know how I got here it is God working all the [Applause] time anything that serve the purpose Glory will have a resurrection amen I say this as I close whether you serve the purpose of God or a purpose for God you will be resurrected amen it's scripture now the good and the bad will also be resurrected but the question is in what Resurrection uhhuh because the Bible in Hebrews 11 told me that those who serve the purpose of God those who repented tasted Redemption and God through their life expressed himself he said they will obtain a better isn't that the language of the scripture a better Resurrection amen so there's a better resurrection and when you want to if there's something better it shows that there you are comparing between two things so there's a resurrection and a better one Hallelujah the better one is the first resurrection because it has many packages that the second one does not have if you come up in the better one the first one you will make the Rapture you will be in the wedding supper you will enjoy the Millennium in the white Throne judgment you will sit on the throne to judge the heart and when ity Rose in you will live in the new capital you will live as a first class citizen in eternity may God help you may God help me to find our purpose and to serve it wholeheartedly brother Braham found EAS and when he saw it fully accomplished he brought a tense given message invisible union he said God sent me to establish a relationship between God and man the Earthly bride and his Heavenly brid grown and when he saw that purpose accomplished Oh my he offered the Thanksgiving and brother Abraham said when my purpose is accomplished there's no reason to stay any longer he preached that in November 65 in December the Lord took him away as an evidence that he accomplish his purpose amen may God help you may God help me to accomplish ours God bless you Saints let's all stand this tonight hallelujah hallelujah glory be to God in the highest so we give you praise and and Glory thank you for your word thank you for your servant thank you for wonderful words alive tonight thank you for the way you use your

purpose we give you praise and thanks refill your servant Hallelujah receive honor and Glory unto thyself is our prayer as we come in the remaining portion night into your hands for your honor and glory in the name of Jesus Christ we pray may we all say Amen tonight amen amen amen many many many many many many manyen Oh Glory all I want to do is love him so glad he gave his life for me let's
