India and there was a man that was blind and he had no [Music] shoes and the first thing did was to take off his shoes to see the man put on his shoes he was SE for the man he was having compassion some sense of feeling the man is already blind but he has no shoes and eventually God healed the man got back his sight I had a testimony or somebody came up to and they had no eyes born without eyes and when the prophet spoke a light begin to come and begin to form the eyes and the midst of that the prophet said I forget to ask you what color do you [Music] [Applause] wanted what color and the

is the only thing that is not written in the book The Seals these seals on the backside of the book and the time of the seven Angel is sounding all the Mysteries that are written in the book is completed so there are mysteres in the book and there are seven voices outside the book and these voices going to seal youto the Rapture these voices going to shake the devil's Kingdom those voice are going to do that hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise God you may be seated now the scripture we read Jesus was saying but at that day that hour no man but my father only oh praise God

this if the good man of the house had known what what the teeth would come he would have watched therefore be also ready but in such an hour as he think not the son of man coming you may be seated let's continue and there's a mystery right here in verse 45 he said who is that faithful and wise servant whom his Lord will made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season so now he is bringing in a fold Ministry real servants not men who looking for Fame and Fortune but men who have a heart of servanthood you know a servant has come the [Music] tree not not some big shot and a thr

he's not away off and shall cut him and appoint him with his portion with the Hypocrites and there shall be weeping and willing and Nation you may be seated and the there's a message the second coming of the Lord and that message he describe at that time they didn't have a wedding ring for a woman to wear sh a wedding Banner on her head and in the band have coins that represented different virtues and if she was caught in adultery or caught un clean living they will take her to the priest and they will take out that particular coin and when her husband comes home and see the coin missing he will divorce her and put her away so the prophet says he took the scriptures which woman having nine coins or whatever wouldn't lost one and and seek diligently until she find it and he took that scripture and identified the bride in that [Music] scripture he was saying a husband was coming now the husband of course represent Jesus and the bride must have all the coins so this woman she knew she lost one and she began to uh clean up the finance he was talking about she had to light a candle and she had a broom and she went to house cleaning now you know if you're cleaning your house and you don't want your neighbor to know you're cleaning your house or you clean quietly you might push some dirt under the carpet you're moving very [Music] easy because you don't want to beor to know your house is dirty but this woman she wasn't like that she was dra on the caret got to find that coin find that coin every huah when you behave like that that you don't care who in front of you at the side of you you don't care who is behind you you praise God anyhow you pray anyhow oh Hallelujah you cry out anyhow but abam said she had a read house clean and time brother we the Church of the Living God we need to check up and go before God the church has no conscience no more you could hardly wake them up the Bible say they would come in that condition when they will say the Lord delay is coming and they'll be fighting one another Oh Glory to God praise God praise God he said the Lutheran Church lost his [Music] light Methodist Church lost a light she had a house cleaning time she scrubbed the floors she swept the Ralls she took down the C webs she kept on until she found what she had [Music] lost and when she did she called her little sister churches come now come now up out and then here is prophecy he said I don't care if you are Methodist Baptist Presbyterian let us rejoice together are you ready for this [Music] prophecy when that time come when the church finds his sply love then the church find his holy decency then the church find its place in Christ people call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us God wants the church to love [Music] him you may be seated oh praise God oh give him praises give him Praises him glory to God hallelujah hallelu you know be season when the church finds his brotherly love the church find his holy decy and the church finds his place in Christ seated let me share a testimony with you may be seated 1981 [Music] 1981 we had a little church in a country [Music] area uh at that time we were worshiping a little house a wooden house there was no electricity there was no running water just maybe about six eight people and we used to pump gas lamp to to to to have services and go to a well to get water and one night we had a prayer meeting and I was praying and a vision broke the first Vision that I saw a sheet dropped down I saw the second coming of the Lord and when I and when I came out of of [Music] it I wanted to know if bam preached on this when I searched out I found he did preach in it message called the second coming of the Lord so I begin to study that message and when I came to this quot here this prophecy I said church this is a prophecy here this must be revealed now I know what was in my heart who ignored me and treat me badly in Trinidad I knew I had ill feelings towards them because they didn't try to understand or know me or meet me they just say what they want to say sometimes when people don't know you and you hear negative things it can affect you and give you a complex so when I found this here this prophecy I began to preach on it and preach for about forgiveness and one day I was behind the ppit and I said God forgive me of my sins why can't I forgive you and then the Holy Spirit brought to us in in [Music] Trinidad revelation of Brotherly kindness now at that time I've never seen the spirit pour out before we preached the word and share the word and so on and I came from a Catholic background not Pentecostal so I don't know about worship and all this sort of things but when brotherly kindness broke the Holy Spirit poured out and it was quite an experience to see the spirit pour out upon the people now that changed me and all the issues that I had in my heart left I had no ODS against anybody [Music] later on I understood the prophet said faith is based on [Applause] forgiveness so if you want to be healed you can't have oughts and grudges but but I want to show you this in this age God put brotherly kindness as the blood as the door so he put right here that's you that's what you have to manifest regardless of how Brethren treat you what your wife do husband do children it doesn't matter you have to forgive yes why yes why brotherly kindness give you [Music] access Holy [Applause] Spirit [Applause] do you see it so there Spirit of [Music] forgiveness has to be there to break into that Holy Spirit be seated or I can put it this way the book of Jude small book is just before the Book of [Music] Revelation that book of Jude and in that book of Jude Jude said and of some have compassion making a difference and Jude was [Music] teaching that their Believers their people who might be weak in the [Music] flesh deser the difference be between people who are weak and people who are badp spirited people that don't care so there are people that do wrong things and they don't want to do wrong things have compassion they have a heart for [Music] God but they have different weaknesses so Jude brought brotherly kindness that book just before Revelation so before you move into real Revelation Book of Revelation you have to get into Jude and compassion but you have the opportunity to get into brotherly kindness not as a Doctrine but I'm talking about brotherly kindness the spirit of it not the text of of it not not not not speaking lovely the truth but speaking the truth in love it is not the same so we need to get in the spirit of Brotherly kindness to have true brotherly kindness one more when brother Bram came to the church and the two people was making love in the church begging stop it please please stop it don't do that here and all of a sudden Holy Spirit dropped down and say whatever you say it going to happen to them if you say that they will die if they say blind they will go blind he gave the prophet [Music] options option one option one option two option two option three option three and he shows none of them he said I forgive [Applause] you and God was [Music] pleased I forgive you because he knew he did things that needed forgiveness I'll give you one more you be seated but abam had services and he went to a restaurant hungry and when he went to the restaurant he saw this woman with some men music playing and everything else and he said God is this the world that you're going to have here now daughter to grow up [Music] in why don't you judge and destroy it he felt a top of his shoulder call him aside then God gave him a vision and the vision was him as a young child young [Music] boy everything he was doing wrong was going up to God and Jesus blood were like a bumper pumping it back off keeping it from going to the presence of God in the vision he saw God took his sins and right pardon put it in the sea of forgetfulness and God told him I forgive you and you condemn her the Lord Praises did you get that he said I forgive you you are condemning the woman hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I don't know why I'm going there Hallelujah I don't know why I'm saying these things soam went to the woman said woman I was just condemning you and the Lord show me my own sins that he forgave say I was a [Music] Believer and things went [Applause] wrong and I'm all messed up and right there brother went on his knees he and that woman he prayed and she was restored Oh Glory to God give the Lord some Praises one more one more one more let's take Jesus now Jesus Jesus they call him one day they said this woman was caught in the very Act of adultery Moses law her and all these guys with their long beards and tall hats their stone for the woman Jesus didn't watch them the woman was so [Music] ashamed her head is all bowed and Jesus said no problem with Moses problem with the law problem with your big Stone one of you without sin cast the first stone which one of you without sin pass the first stone all of a sudden somebody says I have to pick up his child from school I have to go and buy some potatoes I have to get a taxi has to go now one by one they begin to leave one by one to leave and all of a sudden Jus said Jesus said Jesus said woman are your accusers she said no my Lord no here Jesus said neither do I condemn thee you are free woman go and no more go and sin no more somebody goinge inside hereu [Applause] Hallelujah that that's that's the power of forgiveness That's The Power of forgiveness Oh Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah let me see if I can close off here God you may be seated praise God God glory to God hallelujah so the promise of his coming is Malachi 4 Revelation 10:7 the promise of the shout that came to the prophet of Seven tunders and Seven Seals and he says here watch in the last days there's got to be a place prepared for the word to be made manifest listen to these words now and we are now living by the evidence of the new [Music] land so William Bram Ministry the words on the books and the tapes is not a man it's is the son of man and that son of man is evidence of the land where we going [Music] through remember this remember this Israel was in Egypt 400 years God promised to deliver them Egypt was not their land even if you build a three story building in Egypt it's still not your land that is Egypt so let's say Egypt is here let's say the land is across there God sent Moses to take them from here to get them to across there we know the story two million people leave Egypt and out of two million only two made it because of unbelief so God was [Music] interested children that those mothers were having on the [Music] journey because God was raising up a new generation to take them into the land so when Moses died God told Joshua Moses my servant is dead take these people over and let me prophesy there's going to be a fold Ministry a new generation to take the people over give the Lord some prais you are going over into your land Oh Glory to God hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah listen to this notice the coming of Jesus is so close at hand until the spirit justification [Music] sanctification just Spirit justification sanctification the church has got to be so perfectly like Christ and hear the prophecy now we have got a Ministry coming that's exactly like the Life of Christ what does that Ministry identify the coming of the Lord behold the com listen there's a prophecy that Jesus Christ Ministry there will be among us not not my Ministry not his ministry not his ministry not the their Ministry Jesus ministry work to them that's the promise Christ own Ministry brother Bram identified a [Music] shout he did that in rupture message he said three things happen when Jesus is descending and Jesus does all three shout a voice a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears so he's explaining here a shout what is the shout it's the message going forth the living bread of life bringing forth the bride you has been feeding on the sh message oh glory to God hallelujah isn't that right watch the first thing comes when he stands descends from Heaven is a message to get the people together what is that message seven tunders GA has the bright again together so the shout and the Seven tenders is the same thing the Lord himself in Revelation 10 descended and seven Thunders utter the voices here we go he starts sending right it's a shout it's a message to get the people together a message come forward lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps see inspiration lamp triming time the come rise and trim your lamp lamp triming time the second is the voice the voice of the Resurrection getting the bright together then the resurrection of the dead and then the trumpet isn't that right oh glory to God skip quickly here now Hallelujah glory to God thank you Jesus glory to God hall hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah to God oh let's head home chch now he said what he called the elects to the Lutheran he called the elect out of the Lutheran to make the [Music] wesan he is calling the elect out of the Pentecostal to make the headstone to come into it now Hebrews tell us they without us are not made perfect so you are say the catstone bride and you going to connect with the rest of the body and pull them out from the grave so you make up the headstone and Christ steps into it then you connect with the rest of the body and the sleep Saints and the living Saints take up in the air oh praise the name of the Lord isn't there something there oh glory to God let me see we close here right now he said now appearing and coming appearing and coming is two different words to appear and then to [Music] come now is the appearing he already appears in his last days it's a sign of his coming he's appearing in his church in the form of the Holy Spirit showing that it is him because people cannot do these things and the final quote I have here with this remember appearing and coming is two different [Music] words he's appearing now in the church show himself alive so before Jesus comes he has to appear Among Us let me say it again before he comes he has to appear Among Us and once he appears Among [Music] Us you will see evidence of the operation of his Spirit could be all [Music] stand I begin to Worship the Lord let's pray father we thank you for your presence we thank you for your people may anointing break through upon them and give them Victory after Victory as we look forward that you will visit us this evening that prayer line Lord that you will appear Among Us and heal every sick person that passes through that line every be captive free Jes I ask amen amen God bless you you have been a wonderful audience [Applause] Hallelujah that sh [Music] [Music] hallelujah oh part [Music] Hallelujah oh again [Music] oh she
