[25:00] to see you brother samuel
[25:01] amen so if you have your bibles i'd like
[25:03] you to turn to two portion scriptures
[25:05] tonight
[25:06] deuteronomy chapter eight
[25:08] and first corinthians chapter nine
[25:11] we want to read the whole chapter of
[25:13] deuteronomy chapter eight
[25:15] and you want to read first corinthians 9
[25:17] 24
[25:18] to 27 i think i
[25:21] i read that sometime before
[25:24] in the past
[25:26] this is deuteronomy chapter 8 reading
[25:27] from verse 1. all the commandments which
[25:29] i command thee this day
[25:32] shall be observed to do
[25:34] that you may live
[25:35] and multiply
[25:37] and go in and possess the land which the
[25:40] lord sway unto your fathers
[25:42] and thou shalt remember all the way
[25:44] which the lord thy god led thee these 40
[25:47] years
[25:48] in the wilderness
[25:49] to humble thee
[25:51] and to prove thee
[25:52] to know what was in thine heart
[25:55] whether thou would keep us
[25:57] his commandments
[25:58] or no
[26:00] and he humbled me and suffered into
[26:02] hunger
[26:03] said thee with manner which thou knewest
[26:05] not neither thy fathers know
[26:07] that he might make thee know
[26:09] that man shall not live by bread alone
[26:12] but by every word that proceedeth
[26:15] out of the mouth of the lord that man
[26:17] live
[26:18] thy arraignment wax not all upon thee
[26:21] neither did thy foot swell these forty
[26:23] years
[26:25] thou shall also consider in thine heart
[26:27] that as a man chased not his son
[26:30] so the lord thy god chastened at thee
[26:33] therefore
[26:34] thou shalt keep the commandments of the
[26:36] lord thy god to walk in his ways and to
[26:38] fear them
[26:39] for the lord i god bringeth thee into a
[26:41] good land
[26:42] a land of brooks of water fountains of
[26:44] depths and spring out of the valley and
[26:47] hills
[26:48] a land of wheat and barley and vines and
[26:50] fig trees and pomegranates a lot of oil
[26:52] honey olive and honey
[26:55] land where it thou shalt eat bread
[26:57] without scarceness
[26:58] thou shalt not lack anything in it
[27:00] a land whose stones are iron and out of
[27:04] whose hills
[27:05] thou mighters dig brass
[27:08] when thou has eaten
[27:10] are not full
[27:11] then thou shalt bless the lord thy god
[27:13] for the good land
[27:15] which he had given thee
[27:16] beware that thou forget not the lord thy
[27:19] god
[27:20] in not keeping his commandments and his
[27:23] judgments and his statutes which i
[27:25] command it is the
[27:26] least
[27:28] when thou has eaten and had full
[27:31] and has built goodly houses and dwelt
[27:34] therein
[27:35] when thy hoods and i flocks
[27:37] multiply and i silver and thy goal is
[27:40] multiplied and all that thou has is
[27:42] multiplied then thy hearty lifted up
[27:46] and thou forget the lord thy god which
[27:48] brought the fort out of the land of
[27:50] egypt from the house of bondage who led
[27:53] thee through that great and terrible
[27:54] wilderness wherein were fiery serpents
[27:57] and scorpions and drought where there
[27:59] was no water who brought the
[28:01] water out of the rock of flint
[28:03] who fed thee in the wilderness with
[28:05] manna which thy fathers knew not that he
[28:07] might humble thee
[28:09] that he might prove thee to do the good
[28:12] at thy latter end
[28:14] and thou shall say thine heart my power
[28:16] and the might of my hand had got me this
[28:18] wealth but thou shalt remember
[28:21] the lord thy god for it is he
[28:24] that giveth the power
[28:25] to get wealth
[28:27] and that he may establish his covenant
[28:30] which he sway unto thy fathers as in
[28:32] this day and shall be if thou do all at
[28:35] all forget the lord thy god and walk
[28:38] after other gods and save them and
[28:40] worship them i testify against you this
[28:42] day you shall surely perish
[28:45] as the nations which the lord destroy
[28:47] before your face your child you perish
[28:49] because you would not be obedient unto
[28:52] the voice
[28:53] of the lord
[28:54] your god and from first corinthians
[28:56] chapter 9 11 verse 24
[29:00] paul speaking
[29:01] knowing not that day which run in a race
[29:03] run all but one receiver the prize so
[29:06] run
[29:07] that he may obtain that's a message we
[29:09] preach
[29:10] a couple of
[29:11] weeks ago
[29:12] and every man that strived for the
[29:14] mastery is temperate in all things now
[29:16] they do it to obtain a corruptable crown
[29:19] but we are incorruptable i therefore so
[29:21] run
[29:22] not as uncertainly so fight i
[29:25] not as one that beated the ear
[29:27] but i keep
[29:29] under my body and bring it in subjection
[29:32] least by any means when i have preached
[29:35] to others i myself
[29:37] should be a cast away and i think i want
[29:40] to just
[29:41] look at that scripture again first
[29:43] corinthians chapter 9
[29:45] and you want to just read it
[29:47] in the amplified you say but like a
[29:49] boxer i buffet my body handle it roughly
[29:53] discipline it by hardships and subdue it
[29:56] for fear that after proclaiming to
[29:59] others the gospel and things spitting
[30:01] into it i myself should become unfit
[30:05] not stand the test be unapproved and
[30:07] rejected as a counterfeit let's bow
[30:09] heads one more time heavenly father we
[30:11] thank you for your word we have read it
[30:13] and only you could interpret it to our
[30:14] hearts lord and you know what's upon my
[30:16] heart to share with you people tonight
[30:18] mew inspired lord i i trust you tonight
[30:21] and i have confidence that you would
[30:23] come down among us and speak to our
[30:24] hearts and and change and transform our
[30:26] lives in jesus name i ask a team and you
[30:28] may be seated or praise god i certainly
[30:30] appreciate the bible study we've got to
[30:32] steve muller very uh last night
[30:34] o praise the name of the lord
[30:36] uh that was a nice word for us amen
[30:39] praise god so this will tie into that
[30:41] and tie into uh the last message that we
[30:43] preach also
[30:44] okay
[30:46] so i have a title tonight the cost of
[30:48] freedom the cost of freedom
[30:51] of a subject discipline as a price
[30:54] and an inspiration freedom is not free
[30:58] or praise the name of the lord
[31:00] and uh romans itself tells us romans 8
[31:04] 14 for his mayors are led by the spirit
[31:06] of god they are the sons of god
[31:08] you have not received the spirit of
[31:09] bondage again to fear but you'll receive
[31:12] the spirit of adoption wherever you
[31:14] crave a father could imagine from coming
[31:16] from sinners god could release not the
[31:18] spirit of bondage
[31:20] but the spirit of adoption
[31:22] that you call abba father it circumvent
[31:25] all the little mary's and all the
[31:27] secretaries and all the in between he's
[31:30] cut all that off it brings you direct
[31:33] access to god
[31:34] because you're not crying about pastor
[31:36] abba evangelist i'm an apostle you're
[31:37] crying about father
[31:39] direct
[31:40] direct to your lord you're not coming to
[31:42] a man you're coming to direct source
[31:45] spirit of relation crying about father
[31:47] and you have received again the spirit
[31:48] of the cover the spirit itself buried
[31:51] witness with our spirit that we are the
[31:53] church of god and if turin and ears ears
[31:55] of god join there with christ so he's
[31:57] laid it out if if heirs is of god
[31:59] joining with christ if so if so if so
[32:02] that we suffer with him
[32:04] that we may be also be glorified
[32:06] together if i reckon that the sufferings
[32:08] of this present time are not worthy to
[32:10] be compared with the glory we shall
[32:12] reveal in us so if you can't suffer then
[32:14] they carry with him there's a price
[32:16] there's a cost we're going out somewhere
[32:18] this night amen for the earnest and
[32:20] expectation of the creature waited for
[32:23] the manifestation of the sons of god and
[32:25] then it went on to talk about the
[32:27] creation subject of vanity but i want to
[32:28] jump into the amplified for the whole
[32:30] creation all nature waits expectantly
[32:33] and longs earnestly for god's sons to be
[32:37] made known
[32:38] wait for the revealing or the disclosing
[32:42] of their sonship
[32:43] it's almost as god's sons are hidden
[32:45] they're veiled but the nato itself is
[32:48] waiting for them to be unveiled
[32:50] oh glory to god for the creation which
[32:52] is nature was subject to frailty watch
[32:55] not because of some intentional fault of
[32:58] its part but by the will of him who
[32:59] subsubjected it yet at hope the nature
[33:03] of creation itself will be set free
[33:06] from its bondage to decay and corruption
[33:10] and gain entrance into the glorious
[33:12] freedom of god's children
[33:14] so we are promised what the bible called
[33:17] the glorious liberty of the sons of god
[33:20] hallelujah hallelujah from this bondage
[33:24] of corruption into the glorious liberty
[33:26] or the glorious freedom of the sons of
[33:29] god we wasn't made to be bone we wasn't
[33:32] made to be tied up we wasn't made to be
[33:34] tangled up we wasn't made to be in a
[33:36] prison we were made to be free
[33:38] in the image and likeness of god that's
[33:40] how god placed us in the garden of eden
[33:43] in the original
[33:44] oh give the lord a shout that's original
[33:47] commission oh let us put man in our
[33:49] image we have nothing on earth like him

[33:56] lord some praises he made a spirit man
[33:59] oh glory to god no no flesh man the
[34:01] flesh ain't nothing and a child he made
[34:03] a spirit man and said what's good he's
[34:06] in my image and likeness and in genesis
[34:08] 2 he put a dust man and put the spirit
[34:10] man in that dust man man became a living
[34:13] soul oh glory to god give the lord a
[34:15] shout because there was no man to tell
[34:17] the soil but we are going back to our
[34:20] sonship we are going back to inheritance
[34:22] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[34:25] do you believe that
[34:27] amen
[34:28] so we know the whole creation grown and
[34:29] travail it and pain together not only

[34:33] full suit of the spirit even we
[34:35] ourselves growing in ourselves waiting
[34:37] for the adoption to with the redemption
[34:40] of our body
[34:42] now this word discipline
[34:44] it as a system means that i got got
[34:48] of it it means control gain by enforcing
[34:52] obedience or order
[34:55] that's what discipline means
[34:57] orderly or prescribed conduct or pattern
[35:00] of behavior
[35:02] training
[35:03] that corrects
[35:05] molds
[35:06] or perfects the mental faculties or
[35:10] moral character
[35:11] that is what discipline is about you do
[35:13] this up in your childhood run away bad
[35:15] behavior
[35:16] and that small child become a big big
[35:18] problem in society later on
[35:20] because there's no discipline but you
[35:22] know god doesn't have his sons running
[35:24] in discipline we know every son that
[35:26] committed god god has handled them a
[35:28] certain way
[35:29] because there's god you're talking about
[35:30] you're not talking about a man you know
[35:32] doty grandfather all he needs to sons
[35:34] and daughters hallelujah real life
[35:36] grandchildren and so on we love that but

[35:58] mother and father and husband and wife
[36:00] you're watching generation upon
[36:01] generation hallelujah what is it the
[36:04] seed of the righteous because god knew
[36:06] there was a serpent seed on the earth
[36:08] now going to pervert and table with
[36:10] judgment and everything else
[36:11] and they will so corrupt the earth that
[36:13] the seat of the righteous will get left
[36:14] and less and less and less so god has to
[36:16] preserve the seed of the righteous
[36:18] oh glory to god so he put something
[36:20] inside of you that you could respond to
[36:22] the word in your time in your generation
[36:25] in your season he put that inside of you

[36:52] hallelujah hebrews 5 8 talking about
[36:56] jesus though he was son
[36:59] yet
[37:00] learned he obedience
[37:02] by the things which he suffered
[37:04] so he suffered he learned obedience
[37:07] about that so we're not born obedient
[37:09] children
[37:10] we learn obedience just as jesus had to
[37:12] learn it we have to learn it too
[37:14] and there's a way god will
[37:16] instruct and bring guidance and so on
[37:18] isn't that right first peter four
[37:21] 1 2 says for as much as christ
[37:25] had suffered for us
[37:26] in the flesh
[37:28] i am yourself likewise
[37:30] with the same mind for he that suffered

[38:03] likewise with the same mind for he that
[38:06] suffered in the flesh that ceased from
[38:08] sin
[38:09] that he should no longer live the rest
[38:11] of his time in the flesh the lusts of
[38:13] men but to the will of god
[38:15] first peter 2 21-23
[38:18] it says here for even here unto were he
[38:20] called because christ also suffered for
[38:23] us
[38:24] leaving us an example that we should
[38:26] follow his steps who did no sin neither
[38:29] was god found in his mouth who when he
[38:31] was reviled reviled again when he
[38:33] suffered he threatened not but committed
[38:36] himself to him that judge it righteously

[41:40] be one feeble person left as soon as you
[41:44] walk out on the platform everyone get
[41:46] all the wheelchair cuts and stretchers

[41:55] beginning of the ministry before there
[41:57] was anybody else on the field it had to
[41:59] be kind of let down for a while and then
[42:01] everybody it was new and the people were
[42:03] just expecting anything now if you will
[42:06] have the same expectation you'll get the
[42:08] same results
[42:10] so nobody can tell me that was when the
[42:12] prophets are wrong and he reported him
[42:14] as you know if we get the same
[42:15] expectation we'll give the lord a shout
[42:18] we will have the same results because he
[42:21] is jesus christ the same yesterday today
[42:24] and forever

[45:29] church it's hard to tell what they will
[45:31] do they might want to speak me out of
[45:33] existence they have somebody you like my
[45:34] head so god can't put power on all of
[45:36] that that crazy stuff you have to go and
[45:39] see what's in their heart
[45:41] oh glory to god when the children of
[45:43] israel wanted the freedom go deliver us
[45:46] god deliver us
[45:49] but again good food
[45:51] philosophy them to the full
[45:54] isn't that right
[45:55] they were feeding them to work hard
[45:57] to build cities
[45:59] gods and moses to deliver them
[46:01] what a jubilee to leave egypt hallelujah
[46:04] now they're going where they don't know
[46:05] two million people
[46:07] god sent manna and he had the bible
[46:09] study but brother isaac talking about it
[46:11] when man of all the people find me by
[46:12] the light it tastes like coriander seed
[46:17] and in egypt they had meat
[46:19] in egypt they had this
[46:21] it wasn't so hard as it was in egypt
[46:23] they're studying the bondage
[46:25] they're studying the lakes
[46:27] they're saying all of that they're only
[46:28] studying oh they can't handle what god
[46:30] given them now
[46:32] and all god trying to get them to is to
[46:34] the promised land
[46:35] all of this is journey
[46:37] manner is journey
[46:38] hallelujah what in the rock this journey
[46:41] hallelujah all this thing is journey you
[46:43] see what i've scripted i read he said

[46:52] brought you out when you build your big
[46:54] hopes when you have your money when you
[46:56] have your car you better don't forget me
[46:58] because i am the one who brought you out
[47:01] and empower you to get what you get
[47:03] or give the lord a shout in the house
[47:06] oh
[47:07] hallelujah praise god hallelujah
[47:12] you say how could a father trust his
[47:13] business with a boy that might simply
[47:15] pollute his whole inheritance he can do
[47:17] it the church has got to come to a place
[47:20] to where it is disciplined
[47:22] god's on the work right now discipline
[47:25] he took that son out made a ceremony
[47:27] this is my son i adopt him and watch he
[47:30] was take that to jesus right and jesus
[47:32] had pleased him he took him up took
[47:34] three or three witnesses peter james and
[47:35] john he called it hope faith and charity
[47:38] and brought moses and elijah down to
[47:39] witness this great adoption
[47:41] what was he done there is something
[47:43] special here tonight what we're going to
[47:44] see here tonight the bible said
[47:48] he was transfigured
[47:49] and his rainman shine like the sun a
[47:51] special robe
[47:53] listen to these words
[47:54] a special robe a special anointing
[48:00] oh glory to god a special robe
[48:03] a special anointing
[48:05] and when they looked up they saw him
[48:07] shining in the glory of god and the
[48:08] voice said this is my beloved son here
[48:10] in him what god wants to do with the
[48:13] church tonight he wants to do with an
[48:16] individual is to find somebody the holy
[48:19] spirit is searching to find men
[48:22] that he can take out to a certain place
[48:24] and speak to that person anoint them and
[48:27] give them something special
[48:30] great powers and gifts to work his will
[48:33] and to do his will
[48:35] not to stand up and just talk behind
[48:37] pulpit or give the lord some praises but
[48:40] great powers and gifts
[48:43] to do his will
[48:44] and to work his will
[48:46] so what am i supposed to expect more
[48:47] talk
[48:48] oh glory to god how can he do it
[48:52] if he constantly has to come and say oh
[48:53] it's terrible they just run after this
[48:55] they run after error they won't go to
[48:57] church look at what the conditioning
[48:59] church is if god can't do it to the body
[49:01] he will pick up individuals and do it
[49:03] god is able to rise children unto
[49:06] abraham
[49:07] oh glory to god
[49:09] so when we spoke the last message we
[49:10] talk about entitlement right
[49:12] and paul was showing that he didn't
[49:14] consider himself entitled and he
[49:16] considered himself pressing towards the
[49:18] mark he considered himself going amen
[49:22] are running a certain way because there
[49:24] are no shortcuts
[49:25] hallelujah and he said therefore so run
[49:29] not as uncertainly so fight eye as one
[49:31] that beats the air but i keep my body
[49:34] and bring it on subjection so what he
[49:37] was saying that he was keeping in the
[49:38] discipline
[49:39] in order to win
[49:41] in order to stand
[49:43] in order to run
[49:45] oh give the lord a shout you see some
[49:47] people just think they are just
[49:49] predestinated and they sit back
[49:51] and tight entitled to the rapture and
[49:53] that's a lie from the pit of hell
[49:55] you can't overcome a full-time devil
[49:58] being a part-time christian or give the
[50:00] lord some praises and this devil not
[50:02] don't have corona virus and you don't
[50:03] know quarantine or give us some praises
[50:06] he is actively bringing unbelief to
[50:09] people's mind he is actively depressing
[50:11] and frustrating and dropping darkness
[50:13] upon people you have to be actively
[50:15] pursuing the promises of the living god
[50:18] come on preach back to me somebody you
[50:20] have to be active in your pursuit to the
[50:23] mark of the high calling in christ jesus
[50:26] let's continue he said you know what i
[50:28] believe
[50:29] he said people are not convinced that
[50:31] jesus is coming soon
[50:32] i don't believe that the people are
[50:34] convinced he's coming in this age
[50:35] i believe the reason they are not
[50:37] confirmed concerned is because they're
[50:39] not convinced fully convinced
[50:41] they're not convinced he's with them
[50:42] that's a big one
[50:44] they're not convinced he is with them
[50:48] if they will they will come back to the
[50:49] word
[50:51] is the same god that we read in the
[50:53] bible
[50:54] is the same god receiving you know
[50:56] it's not a different god you know it's
[50:57] the same god of moses isaac are you same
[51:00] one you know another modern one we have
[51:02] you know the same one you know
[51:03] oh hallelujah they'll come back to the
[51:05] way that's right how many people might
[51:07] misunderstand it he said love
[51:10] is
[51:11] discipline
[51:13] that's a big one
[51:15] love is what
[51:16] discipline
[51:18] you must discipline people if you love
[51:19] them
[51:20] if your little girl was sitting out on
[51:21] the road as i said this morning making
[51:23] mud kicks if you really love her you
[51:25] will get off that road
[51:27] so love is discipline
[51:29] as many as i love

[56:09] glory to god
[56:12] sometimes
[56:13] we get motivated we get inspired
[56:15] and after we get inspired the fire lasts
[56:17] for a week two weeks afterwards they
[56:19] just go out
[56:21] and something struck me
[56:23] and i wrote this down
[56:25] the flames of motivation will go out
[56:28] unless the wood of discipline is placed
[56:30] correctly under it
[56:33] you ever had to fire and put kerosene on
[56:35] it you put flame blood bloosh
[56:38] and just die out
[56:40] i have no wood
[56:42] you have nothing for the fire to catch
[56:44] you take it and you're poor
[56:46] the gasoline and it blow up
[56:49] but there is nothing there
[56:51] to maintain and sustain that fire
[56:55] how much people want to lose weight
[56:57] and they get excited
[56:59] join gym
[57:00] and after two three weeks
[57:02] all the excitement god
[57:04] because they have to go into a
[57:05] discipline
[57:06] to really get it done
[57:08] oh hallelujah the muscles on the and
[57:11] dropping it doesn't come overnight
[57:13] but you have to stick with it
[57:15] discipline brings it through
[57:17] there's a price
[57:19] for everything the students who want to
[57:20] be successful are the exams there's the
[57:22] discipline
[57:24] hallelujah they want to play but they
[57:26] have a cost to pay
[57:28] if they want to get these subjects
[57:30] take two students one discipline do
[57:33] their homework
[57:34] do the work instructed to them
[57:36] flip 30 years on that and you'll see
[57:38] where they're at another student playful
[57:41] playful playful not focused
[57:43] flip the script 30 years after that and
[57:45] see where they are it's two different
[57:47] roads
[57:48] two different directions well his sons
[57:51] everywhere
[57:52] sons of god but this message come to
[57:55] produce
[57:56] adopted sons
[57:58] vindicated sons manifested sons
[58:01] oh glory to god disciplined
[58:04] sons
[58:05] could we give the lord
[58:07] some praises
[58:08] glory to god and this message can't
[58:10] bring us in discipline we just sons
[58:12] but we will not be placed
[58:14] oh glory to god are you with me tonight
[58:17] hallelujah
[58:19] so the word of the word
[58:21] represent that discipline
[58:23] that effect upon your life
[58:25] that must harness you to the word that
[58:27] you could put yourself your feelings
[58:29] aside and be committed to what you are
[58:31] responsible for
[58:33] oh glory to god here feel like you feel
[58:35] like i'm not feeling low and i feel what
[58:37] are the ranging
[58:39] jesus and go by felix
[58:41] he was tired
[58:42] he was wary but he did what he had to do
[58:46] oh give the lord a shout you think he
[58:48] wasn't tired in the garden of gethsemane
[58:50] but he did what he had was to do you
[58:53] can't tell me that disciples was more
[58:54] tired than him he said country watching
[58:56] me one hour
[58:58] oh glory to god he comes on to the end
[58:59] of his ministry now he needed a final
[59:02] encouragement and support from the man
[59:03] who was around him to three and a half
[59:04] years and he was killing sleep
[59:08] because he didn't have the burden
[59:10] i didn't recognize the costs and the
[59:12] price that he had to pay
[59:13] but he set himself
[59:15] the bible said he's such a face toward
[59:17] jerusalem he set his face towards the
[59:19] cross because his mind is made up now
[59:22] he knew where he was going
[59:23] oh glory to god he's going to pay the
[59:25] price
[59:27] god in service to die gold frankincense
[59:29] and myrrh
[59:30] god and service to die hallelujah his
[59:33] debt was to pay the price for our
[59:35] liberty tonight his debt was to pay the
[59:38] price for more freedom tonight all glory
[59:41] had cost him and it will cost us
[59:44] all glory to god to see you through for
[59:46] others there is no shortcut there is no
[59:49] other way
[59:50] face up to it
[59:52] oh glory if you are a slacker and you
[59:54] don't want to study the word yourself
[59:55] any man could deceive you
[59:57] because you're leaving up to him to
[59:59] interpret the word to you and god sent a
[1:00:01] messenger with a message that is thus
[1:00:04] here the lord lord inaudible interpret
[1:00:07] it for you when it's written inside a
[1:00:09] deer check what the man preaching by the
[1:00:11] word
[1:00:12] oh give the lord a shout don't be though
[1:00:14] dead and lazy that is a man of god and
[1:00:17] you might not go check him out
[1:00:19] try the spirit see if they of god
[1:00:21] oh glory to god and trust in no man
[1:00:24] i trust in god
[1:00:26] are taking the word and checking every
[1:00:28] spirit out
[1:00:29] oh because many false spirits have come
[1:00:31] into the world
[1:00:32] unless that i'm lying all over the world
[1:00:34] right now
[1:00:35] same line spirit that drop upon 400
[1:00:37] prophets i feel you have over 10 000
[1:00:39] false prophets in this world and more
[1:00:42] and the same spirit anointing all of
[1:00:44] them
[1:00:45] lying prophets
[1:00:47] oh because they're not speaking
[1:00:48] according to the word
[1:00:50] every man would be a lion man be true
[1:00:52] wow wow wow wow
[1:00:55] so paul
[1:00:56] was under discipline
[1:00:58] that's why he could conduct his bodies
[1:00:59] roughly
[1:01:00] probably he didn't want to be a cast
[1:01:02] away he didn't want to be after he
[1:01:04] preached a gospel he ended up on the
[1:01:05] scrap heap
[1:01:06] baram said many ministers would end up
[1:01:08] on scrap heap because they didn't end it
[1:01:10] right they're trying to work the works
[1:01:11] of christ before having the life of
[1:01:13] christ and that can't work there's not a
[1:01:15] pentecostal age that i got given all
[1:01:17] this length of time
[1:01:19] and there's eight times of lingering
[1:01:21] waiting not for congress churches and
[1:01:22] press here waiting for them you know he
[1:01:24] reading verse
[1:01:25] god is waiting on you and i adoption
[1:01:28] time when god could pour out his spirit
[1:01:30] oh god paul is putting a bunch of
[1:01:32] nonsense you had to get the word right
[1:01:35] the foundation right the mechanics right
[1:01:38] oh give the lord some praises
[1:01:40] oh glory to god
[1:01:42] so what is a disciple what is becoming a
[1:01:44] disciple a disciple is a follower
[1:01:46] a student of christ
[1:01:48] christ being the master and luke 9 23 he
[1:01:51] said unto them if any man will come
[1:01:52] after me
[1:01:53] let him deny himself take up his cross
[1:01:56] and follow me
[1:01:58] my
[1:01:59] i miss hold something if anyone will
[1:02:01] come after me come after which is a
[1:02:03] follower which is a disciple let him
[1:02:05] deny himself and take up his cross daily
[1:02:08] i want to underline that word
[1:02:10] daily
[1:02:12] that means is a daily walk
[1:02:15] daily talk
[1:02:17] that's a choice you know you have to
[1:02:18] make you know
[1:02:19] to make it daily reading the word daily
[1:02:22] praying daily applying daily fighting
[1:02:25] daily pressing daily a christian every
[1:02:28] single day
[1:02:31] that's why obama said make yourself a
[1:02:32] christian make yourself a christian is
[1:02:35] that no it's not holy water to drink and
[1:02:37] they become a christian
[1:02:39] you make yourself a christian
[1:02:41] luke 14 and whosoever does not bear the
[1:02:43] cross and come after me can i be my
[1:02:45] disciple
[1:02:46] bear the cross and come after
[1:02:48] bear it and come after go get a cross
[1:02:51] and you have to come after he says sit
[1:02:52] down
[1:02:55] oh we have to follow yes
[1:02:57] who the pastor no him yeah they can
[1:03:00] follow me as i follow christ
[1:03:02] you have to know that you're following
[1:03:03] christ but the key is christ
[1:03:06] paul said follow me as i follow christ
[1:03:08] conditional
[1:03:10] okay
[1:03:12] he said now watch whoever does not bear
[1:03:13] his cross and come after me cannot be my
[1:03:15] disciple for which of you
[1:03:17] come on now
[1:03:18] intend is to build a tower
[1:03:20] sit knocked first and come to cost
[1:03:22] whether he has sufficient to finish it
[1:03:25] at least happily after he had laid the
[1:03:27] foundation he's not able to finish it
[1:03:29] and all the people beginning to mock him
[1:03:30] saying this man begin to build
[1:03:33] and he was not able to finish
[1:03:35] what did the prophet teach us is that
[1:03:36] him who starts
[1:03:38] is him who finish
[1:03:40] you have to count the course
[1:03:42] oh if you will finish
[1:03:44] he's a witch man he said what or what
[1:03:46] king going to make war against another
[1:03:48] king sitting down first and consulted
[1:03:50] whether he be able with ten thousand to
[1:03:52] meet with him he's coming against him
[1:03:54] with twenty thousand or else which the
[1:03:56] other is a great way of extended
[1:03:58] ambassador and desired condition of
[1:04:00] peace
[1:04:00] so likewise here we go whosoever he be
[1:04:04] of you that forsaken not all he had he
[1:04:07] cannot be my disciples
[1:04:09] so jesus was clearly defined defining
[1:04:11] discipleship
[1:04:12] who's going to make it as a disciple
[1:04:15] of christ
[1:04:16] the price of separation
[1:04:18] mother father brother uncle or whoever
[1:04:20] it is
[1:04:21] and follow me after me
[1:04:22] so you can't let them throw you off
[1:04:24] nobody must throw you off the atmosphere
[1:04:26] may not be an anchor in your spirit not
[1:04:28] wife not children not grandchildren not
[1:04:31] family nobody must throw you off
[1:04:34] i wouldn't allow anybody to interfere
[1:04:36] with my space i began to thank god for
[1:04:38] removing people out of my space
[1:04:41] glory to god to take them out of my
[1:04:43] space it gave me more room

[1:06:32] freedom of faith freedom to spend with
[1:06:34] who whenever however
[1:06:37] his money ran out
[1:06:38] with the freedom
[1:06:40] his freedom behind him
[1:06:43] his freedom put him in bondage
[1:06:45] his freedom conquered him
[1:06:47] you want freedom
[1:06:49] freedom is not free
[1:06:51] oh glory to god freedom come with a
[1:06:53] price
[1:06:55] you know why them trainers just said
[1:06:57] well imagine they were crying in a camp
[1:06:59] fire come down and judge them
[1:07:01] and they were crying for meat
[1:07:04] because they eat to the full in egypt
[1:07:07] they were saying it's better we was in
[1:07:09] bondage
[1:07:10] they were telling god if that they
[1:07:11] didn't deliver us
[1:07:12] if you are in this light manner
[1:07:15] yeah they was throwing back things in
[1:07:16] the face of god and god was angry
[1:07:18] and when god dropped all them quails and
[1:07:20] all their meat on them so while they
[1:07:22] eaten judgment took them
[1:07:25] they didn't couldn't even chew it
[1:07:27] judgment struck them
[1:07:30] hallelujah god hated that
[1:07:33] you think people are still living from

[1:07:42] not back to normal for you
[1:07:45] i hope you realize freedom is not free
[1:07:47] and that is why a nurse and safari could
[1:07:50] be killed in the church
[1:07:52] because freedom is not free
[1:07:54] to have a price for the behavior and
[1:07:56] attitude
[1:07:57] oh glory to god
[1:08:02] you can't say nice peter he's a
[1:08:04] fisherman i know him long time and what
[1:08:06] we are in the school peter no he's not

[1:08:09] soul and god is veiled inside the deer
[1:08:12] oh give the lord some praise and that
[1:08:14] same god coming back to veil himself in
[1:08:16] sons and daughters of god be careful

[1:12:43] because you want to bring them to the
[1:12:44] promised land to show them he is god and
[1:12:47] he keeps his word he asked them
[1:12:49] ministers to go and bring a report and
[1:12:51] then boxing men in moses message brought
[1:12:55] back our evil report god judge all of
[1:12:57] them for that

[1:19:22] us to get a revelation of the plainness
[1:19:24] of god to know how to behave was that
[1:19:26] romans 12
[1:19:28] present your body is a living sacrifice
[1:19:29] about this even say which is a
[1:19:31] reasonable service the lowest level
[1:19:33] hallelujah that they may prove what is
[1:19:34] that good acceptable
[1:19:36] of god
[1:19:37] hallelujah
[1:19:43] hebrews 10 and every priest who is 11
[1:19:46] standard ministering and offering off
[1:19:49] times the same sacrifice which can never
[1:19:51] take away sins but this man like that
[1:19:54] after he had offered one sacrifice for
[1:19:57] sin
[1:19:58] forever sat down at the right hand of
[1:20:00] god
[1:20:01] from henceforth expecting till his
[1:20:04] enemies will made the footstool for by
[1:20:05] one offering he had perfected forever
[1:20:08] them that are sanctified
[1:20:09] oh my do you believe that tonight oh
[1:20:12] blessed be the name of the lord o praise
[1:20:15] god hallelujah hallelujah i'm about to
[1:20:18] close oh my
[1:20:21] butterburner let us examine the first
[1:20:23] phrase that means i love in the greek
[1:20:25] the emphasis is upon the post not
[1:20:26] pronounced i
[1:20:28] he does not say as many would feel he
[1:20:31] should say as as many as love me no sir
[1:20:34] we must never try to make jesus the
[1:20:36] object of human love in this verse
[1:20:38] not is as many that are that are the
[1:20:41] loved ones of god it is his loving
[1:20:43] question
[1:20:46] ours
[1:20:47] so once again we find ourselves glory in
[1:20:49] his salvation
[1:20:51] his purpose and his plan and we are
[1:20:53] confirmed even more strongly in the
[1:20:55] truth of the doctrine of the sovereignty
[1:20:58] of god
[1:20:59] even as he said in romans 9 13 jacob
[1:21:01] have i loved does it not obtain that he
[1:21:04] also loved only the many is he therefore
[1:21:07] in the state of complacency awaiting the
[1:21:09] love of those who have not drawn nigh
[1:21:10] him by no means is this so for he
[1:21:13] decided in romans 8 9 13 he saw have i
[1:21:15] hated
[1:21:16] and in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls
[1:21:18] out for the children not being born
[1:21:21] neither have done anything good or evil
[1:21:23] that the purpose of god according to
[1:21:25] election might stand not of works but of
[1:21:28] him that call it
[1:21:29] this love here we go as we close tonight
[1:21:32] is elective love
[1:21:33] it is his love for his elect
[1:21:36] and his love for them is apart from
[1:21:39] human merit
[1:21:41] nothing you could do
[1:21:43] could deserve this love
[1:21:45] it is his love
[1:21:47] it's a path
[1:21:49] from human merit
[1:21:50] for it says that the purpose of god
[1:21:53] stands in election which is exactly
[1:21:55] opposite to works
[1:21:57] or anything manning himself because
[1:21:59] before the show were born he had already
[1:22:01] said jacob have i loved
[1:22:03] and he so have i hated
[1:22:06] and now he said to his own
[1:22:08] as many as i love a rebuke and jason
[1:22:10] to rebuke is to reprove
[1:22:13] to reprove
[1:22:16] is to expose with a future correction
[1:22:20] jason does not mean to punish
[1:22:23] it means a discipline
[1:22:25] because the subject amendment is in mind
[1:22:28] this is exactly what we find in hebrews
[1:22:30] 12 5 11.
[1:22:31] for you have forgotten the exaltation
[1:22:33] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[1:22:35] my son despise not the chastening of the
[1:22:37] lord nor faint when thought rebuked of
[1:22:39] him for whom the lord love it he
[1:22:42] chastened it
[1:22:43] and scorch it every son whom he receive
[1:22:45] it if you end your chaste and god david
[1:22:47] with you as with son for what son is he
[1:22:50] whom the father chastened not but if he
[1:22:52] be without chastisement where
[1:22:54] all are partakers then your bastards are
[1:22:57] not sons furthermore we have had fathers
[1:22:58] our flesh which corrected us and we give
[1:23:00] them reverence shall we not much more
[1:23:02] rather be the subjection of the father
[1:23:05] of spirit live
[1:23:06] for they verily for a few days
[1:23:08] chasteness after their own pleasure but
[1:23:09] he for our prophet that we might be
[1:23:11] partakers of his holiness now not
[1:23:13] chasing for the present seemed to be
[1:23:15] joyous but grievous nevertheless
[1:23:18] afterwards it healed the peaceable fruit
[1:23:20] of righteousness unto them that are
[1:23:22] exercised nearby
[1:23:23] hearing is now set forth the love of god
[1:23:26] he desired in love a family of his own
[1:23:29] a family of sons
[1:23:32] sons like himself there before him lies
[1:23:35] all mankind has one lump of clay
[1:23:37] out of the same lump
[1:23:39] he will now make vessels under honor
[1:23:42] under dishonor
[1:23:43] the chosen will be his own chosen
[1:23:46] then those chosen ones
[1:23:48] born of his spirit will be trained
[1:23:52] watch to conform to his image
[1:23:55] in their walk
[1:23:57] he reproves them
[1:23:58] with all long suffering and gentleness
[1:24:00] and mercy he chastened with neil's guide
[1:24:03] hands
[1:24:04] sometimes his spotter must take the
[1:24:06] vessel he's working on totally break it
[1:24:08] down in order that he may rebuild it
[1:24:10] exactly as he desires it but it is love
[1:24:13] that is his love
[1:24:15] another way of his love there is not
[1:24:18] there cannot be let's all stand
[1:24:23] [Music]
[1:24:30] oh how he loves me
[1:24:33] [Music]
[1:24:34] oh
[1:24:35] how
[1:24:36] he loves you and me
[1:24:44] wow
[1:24:45] he loves you
[1:24:48] and me
[1:24:50] [Music]
[1:24:52] oh wow
[1:24:54] he loves you
[1:24:57] and me
[1:25:02] he
[1:25:02] gets his life
[1:25:05] what more can he do
[1:25:10] oh how
[1:25:14] [Music]
[1:25:17] he loved me
[1:25:19] oh
[1:25:20] how he loved you and me
[1:25:27] oh my
[1:25:28] it's my head
[1:25:29] keep on playing
[1:25:30] [Music]
