[13:07] amen and amen amen
[13:09] certainly great to be here tonight and
[13:12] thanking god for another opportunity
[13:15] it's a humbling experience to
[13:18] stand before you or sit before you or to
[13:20] meet in this way
[13:21] um in such a time as this and uh trust
[13:25] in god
[13:25] that he could help us tonight uh i
[13:28] covered over a short while ago
[13:30] uh somehow the internet these days i
[13:32] don't know
[13:33] i guess everybody connected to something
[13:35] so um
[13:36] i was having some connectivity
[13:38] challenges but we are
[13:40] trusting god tonight and um
[13:43] so we will go as long as he wants us to
[13:45] go and
[13:46] we will fellowship around the world
[13:47] tonight and uh trust that you're
[13:49] encouraged
[13:51] i trust that you're on fire i trust that
[13:55] you're looking the trials square in the
[13:57] face
[13:58] i trust that you're not letting these
[14:00] situations knock you out
[14:03] i trust that you're seeing what's
[14:05] happening around you as
[14:07] as a training ground this is not the
[14:08] final test huh
[14:10] there's a difference between the
[14:11] training ground and the final exam
[14:14] you know this is this is not the final
[14:15] exam this is all training ground
[14:18] this is still beer and lion category
[14:21] um goliath's still coming so i want to
[14:24] challenge your feet
[14:25] i want to encourage you that you are
[14:27] stronger than you realize and it is only
[14:31] the experiences of life can show what's
[14:34] in you
[14:36] and in this study tonight by the grace
[14:38] of god we
[14:39] might see one or two things that deal
[14:40] with that but i realize more and more
[14:43] um as i look into the word
[14:46] is the more i realize how much i don't
[14:48] know is the more i realize how
[14:50] insufficient we really are without god
[14:54] um and that we need him more more than
[14:57] we even realized
[14:58] you know there's a saying you you don't
[15:00] know what you don't know
[15:01] you know and i was having a conversation
[15:03] with over a day or so ago
[15:05] and i was saying the more i study it is
[15:08] not that
[15:08] you end up with more questions but you
[15:10] realize how god
[15:12] thinks so way above our thinking in so
[15:14] much of the bible say his thoughts are
[15:16] above our thoughts
[15:17] now when you start to look and say i
[15:18] wonder why god did this and
[15:20] and and not everything you could figure
[15:22] out because the
[15:23] secret things belong to god and he
[15:26] chooses from his secret things
[15:29] to reveal things to us the things that
[15:31] we need to live and those things which
[15:33] are revealed
[15:34] they belong to us and they belong at our
[15:36] children
[15:38] and it's an encouragement to us that he
[15:40] sees
[15:41] more than we could see you know our our
[15:44] site will always be limited
[15:46] you know sometimes it's only in
[15:48] hindsight when we look back
[15:49] we could kind of figure things out but
[15:52] he doesn't have to wait on hindsight he
[15:54] has
[15:54] for knowledge which is foresight the
[15:56] ability to see before it even plays out
[15:59] and knows how it connects
[16:00] and all the pieces would connect and
[16:02] that is where fate and trust comes in
[16:05] that we could trust him when we cannot
[16:06] see because if we could see everything
[16:08] there will be no need for faith
[16:09] but faith is needed because we have not
[16:12] been given that sight to see
[16:14] everything before us and even to his
[16:16] prophets we saw it with brother ranum
[16:18] we saw it even with elisha with the
[16:20] shunammite when he openly declared
[16:23] the lord did not show me this i don't
[16:24] know what this is so he himself
[16:27] is not that because he was a prophet he
[16:29] was given
[16:31] the the sight for everything around him
[16:33] god
[16:34] knew and god knows what he wants to show
[16:37] and what he doesn't want to show
[16:38] you know so but certainly those things
[16:40] which are revealed to us those things
[16:42] which are made clear to us
[16:43] you know we have a certain attitude
[16:45] about it a certain approach to it
[16:47] a certain way we approach things because
[16:49] once your eyes are open
[16:51] uh you cannot go back to where it was
[16:53] before it's like a chicken
[16:55] you know or a bird that breaks out of an
[16:57] egg once you break all the egg
[16:59] shell there's nothing you could do to
[17:01] put that chicken or that bird back in
[17:03] the shell anymore because it has reached
[17:05] a point where it has outgrown that shell
[17:07] you know and when the revelation of the
[17:09] word has come to you to such a spot
[17:12] that you realize that you are more than
[17:14] a conqueror and greatest
[17:16] in you and you break out of the shell of
[17:18] fear and you break out of the shell of
[17:20] doubt
[17:20] and you break regularly shell of of
[17:22] being insecure
[17:23] like oh gideon felt felt you know and
[17:26] the least
[17:27] tribe believes in my family and and but
[17:29] when he broke out of that
[17:31] and and god said use your name as well
[17:33] the sword of the lord and of gideon
[17:35] you co-sign in this thing you know that
[17:37] is a level of
[17:38] of confirmation that your calling your
[17:41] predestination your election
[17:44] has nothing to do with you and that to
[17:46] me is something that is encouraging to
[17:47] us
[17:48] to us all our calling our election our
[17:51] predestination
[17:52] we have nothing to do with it it is all
[17:54] by the sovereign
[17:56] grace of god not just the grace of god
[17:58] you know the sovereign grace of god
[18:00] and i said it in in praying his
[18:02] sovereignty and his grace doesn't need
[18:04] permission
[18:05] you imagine if god choosing you needed
[18:07] permission from somebody
[18:11] think of somebody who who who you know
[18:13] get along too well with
[18:14] who you know really wouldn't have me
[18:16] they may not have the best thing to say
[18:18] about you and god went to them and say
[18:19] should i
[18:20] like this one you know some of us
[18:21] wouldn't be in this room you know
[18:23] but god suffering grace he didn't look
[18:26] to anybody else
[18:27] when he picked us when he chose us when
[18:28] he called us you know so
[18:30] by the grace of god tonight you know i
[18:33] was
[18:33] kind of you know trying to find trying
[18:36] to catch the mind of christ for what
[18:39] what to do tonight and um so
[18:42] um i have personally found um every
[18:45] bible study to be different
[18:47] and it will continue to be different and
[18:49] i realize that you can't
[18:50] even start to even exhaust this thing
[18:52] but tonight i want to
[18:55] i want to call it at the at the risk of
[18:58] getting myself in trouble because i i
[19:00] remember i did a study of danielle and i
[19:03] call it part one
[19:04] and part two has not yet arrived um but
[19:07] it's because i know that that you can't
[19:10] call it just a study of danielle because
[19:11] there's so much to it
[19:12] you couldn't cover it in one sitting you
[19:14] know but tonight
[19:16] i want to call it a study of peter part
[19:19] one
[19:20] because i know it will have more to it
[19:23] but i want to just have a conversation
[19:25] about peter around peter um
[19:29] and kind of look at the life of peter a
[19:31] little bit is we don't have the time to
[19:33] delve into it tonight
[19:34] you know there are many characters in
[19:37] scripture
[19:38] that we speak about in passing even the
[19:41] last
[19:42] few sessions we did kind of revolved
[19:45] around the life of elisha
[19:47] but there is only so much we have of the
[19:50] life of elisha itself you know
[19:52] emphasis is placed on yeshua might woman
[19:56] there's more focus on
[19:57] what's around the prophet than the
[19:59] prophet himself he's a common theme in
[20:01] these situations but
[20:02] a lot of time and effort and energy is
[20:05] spent
[20:06] around him when you look at the old
[20:08] testament there are many
[20:10] biblical characters that we know just a
[20:12] snapshot of their lives
[20:14] you know and and it's one of the reasons
[20:16] i really like the story of david
[20:18] because david is somebody we see as a
[20:20] little boy we see him growing up we see
[20:22] him as a king
[20:23] and we see him all the way as an old man
[20:25] you know on
[20:26] on on his dead bed as it were we get a
[20:28] whole you know
[20:29] a whole fifty thousand foot view of his
[20:32] life
[20:32] and and i find in the new testament
[20:34] peter to be something like that as well
[20:37] um out of all of the disciples who were
[20:40] there with jesus there is no one
[20:44] to whom more attention is given
[20:48] than peter and i find peter to be an
[20:51] interesting
[20:52] study and and to kind of get into it
[20:54] tonight
[20:55] i want to kind of start closer to the
[20:57] end before we rewind a little bit
[20:59] so i want us to start uh from actually
[21:02] first peter
[21:04] uh first peter verse one and i just want
[21:07] to kind of lay a context
[21:08] and then kind of go back a little bit to
[21:11] kind of pick up some points in his life
[21:12] and then
[21:13] one specific incident that took place
[21:17] that i want us to just look at and see
[21:20] how
[21:20] we see our own life and our christian
[21:24] journey in that particular situation
[21:26] so this part is a i find it to be a fate
[21:30] building part um and then we're going to
[21:32] kind of get into
[21:34] more of a you know meditating pattern on
[21:37] what the word is trying to show us here
[21:38] so
[21:39] we're going to read from first peter 1
[21:42] and from verse one peter an apostle of
[21:46] jesus christ
[21:47] to the strangers scattered throughout
[21:51] pontus
[21:52] galatia cappadocia asia
[21:55] and bifinia and
[21:58] i i i like it because when you look at
[22:01] this in
[22:02] the the amplified um let me just read
[22:05] verse two before i go there
[22:07] elect according to the full knowledge of
[22:09] god the father so he is
[22:10] he is speaking on the recipients of this
[22:13] letter
[22:13] he is calling the elect according to the
[22:15] full knowledge of god the father
[22:18] through sanctification of the spirit
[22:20] unto obedience
[22:22] and sprinkling the blood of jesus christ
[22:25] grace unto you
[22:26] and peace be multiplied what a
[22:28] salutation
[22:29] what a way to introduce a letter what a
[22:32] way to place in context
[22:34] the grace of god the mercy of god and in
[22:37] the in the
[22:38] in the amplified it says it like this
[22:40] peter an apostle
[22:41] and it goes on special messenger
[22:44] personally chosen
[22:45] representative of jesus christ so those
[22:48] elect
[22:48] listen here now both jewish and gentile
[22:51] believers
[22:52] that that he's calling their strangers
[22:55] who live as
[22:56] exiles scattered throughout pontus
[22:59] galatia cappadocia asia minor and bithya
[23:03] who are chosen according to the full
[23:05] knowledge of god the father
[23:07] by the sanctifying work of the spirit
[23:09] listen
[23:10] to be obedient to jesus christ
[23:14] you see what we are called to to be
[23:16] obedient to jesus christ
[23:18] and and and verse three so now he's
[23:21] going blessed be the god and father
[23:23] of our lord jesus christ which according
[23:26] to his abundant mercy
[23:28] had begotten us again unto a lively hope
[23:32] by the resurrection of jesus christ from
[23:34] the dead
[23:35] so that lively hope is by the
[23:37] resurrection of jesus christ from the
[23:39] dead
[23:40] two verse four an inheritance
[23:42] incorruptible
[23:44] an inheritance that cannot be defiled an
[23:47] inheritance that cannot be
[23:49] destroyed that cannot be changed in the
[23:52] ambition
[23:52] on the fallen on feeding so it is value
[23:56] that your dwarf will wonder about
[23:57] can the church say amen to an
[23:59] inheritance incorruptible
[24:01] and undefiled and that fear is not away
[24:03] reserved in heaven for you
[24:08] you know many times i get caught up in
[24:09] what's going on here and you realize you
[24:11] have an inheritance reserved
[24:12] you ever went to a place and and you say
[24:14] i could sit here they said no that city
[24:16] is reserved
[24:18] that no matter what time the person
[24:20] comes for that reserve seat
[24:22] they got to worry about where they sit
[24:23] down because it is reserved
[24:25] so to your inheritance is reserved in
[24:28] heaven for you
[24:29] that is that should we warming up with
[24:32] them so if if
[24:33] if that ain't making you rejoice yet
[24:35] we'll go into more rejoicing stuff
[24:37] but just know just know if you didn't
[24:39] think about it for the entire day
[24:41] and if you first time here infidelity
[24:43] you have an inheritance with your name
[24:45] in it it's reserved
[24:46] it is not for an angel it is not for
[24:48] another brother it's not for another
[24:50] sister
[24:50] it is an inheritance that reserved for
[24:52] you so i do have to look at your
[24:54] inheritance
[24:55] because i have my own inheritance i'd
[24:57] have to wonder but by the mic
[24:58] inheritance because i have my own
[25:00] in it i don't know what what about
[25:01] brother popular inheritance because i am
[25:02] minor
[25:03] i want my inheritance anybody with me
[25:06] tonight
[25:08] first five who are kept by the power of
[25:12] god
[25:12] true faith unto salvation ready to be
[25:15] revealed
[25:16] in the last time so so this is showing
[25:19] sister pauline that the
[25:21] keeping the keeping who is keeping you
[25:24] is not yourself
[25:27] there's nothing you and i could do to
[25:28] keep ourselves but i say who are kept by
[25:31] the power of god
[25:33] true faith under salvation ready to be
[25:35] revealed
[25:36] in the last time all right we're warming
[25:38] into something here
[25:40] wherein he greatly rejoiced though now
[25:43] for a season
[25:45] if need be ye are in heaviness through
[25:48] manifold temptations
[25:50] so so peter is saying even though now
[25:53] for a little while if necessary you have
[25:55] been distressed
[25:56] by various trials is there anybody
[26:00] distressed by various trials
[26:03] peter is saying that is just for a
[26:05] season the distressing of these
[26:07] various trials is just for a season
[26:10] these
[26:11] trials are just for a season and and it
[26:14] also has
[26:15] has a purpose verse 7 that the trial of
[26:19] your fate
[26:20] being much more precious than of gold
[26:23] that perish
[26:24] it though it be tried with fire might be
[26:26] found unto praise
[26:28] and honor and glory at the appearing of
[26:30] jesus christ
[26:31] can the church say men amen amen amen
[26:36] so i just want to kind of kind of skip
[26:38] down because i want to what i'm touching
[26:39] on is a couple high
[26:41] points of peter before we kind of go
[26:43] back
[26:44] a little bit right so i want to go
[26:47] now to
[26:50] to a familiar scripture let's go to
[26:52] second peter
[26:53] a very very familiar scripture to us ii
[26:56] peter
[26:57] verse uh chapter one verse one
[27:03] simon peter a servant and an apostle of
[27:05] jesus christ
[27:06] to them that have obtained like precious
[27:09] fate with
[27:10] us through the righteousness of god and
[27:12] our savior jesus christ
[27:14] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[27:17] through the knowledge of god and of
[27:18] jesus our lord
[27:20] according as his divine power had given
[27:24] unto us all things that pertain
[27:27] unto life and godliness so
[27:30] this is past tense a half-given is past
[27:32] tense
[27:33] given unto us all things that pertain
[27:35] under life and godliness
[27:37] through the knowledge of him that had
[27:39] called us
[27:40] to glory and virtue so through the
[27:43] knowledge of him so the more you get to
[27:44] know him
[27:45] is how you access this that he has
[27:47] already done which is why it's so
[27:49] important
[27:50] for us to come into fellowship like this
[27:53] to
[27:53] read study and meditate the word because
[27:56] the
[27:56] final objective is to read that level
[27:58] where you could meditate
[28:00] until this word becomes your word and
[28:02] you can't meditate on what you don't
[28:03] know what you've never experienced or
[28:04] what you never read about
[28:06] so by us coming together in these
[28:07] studies and you're coming to service
[28:09] and you're connecting and you're reading
[28:10] the prophets messing on the books
[28:12] is to come to an awareness of the
[28:14] knowledge of him not as just
[28:16] have knowledge but to know him as in by
[28:19] experience as well
[28:20] because once you get to know him and you
[28:22] have the knowledge of him
[28:23] now he can access that which he has
[28:25] already done given us
[28:27] all things and whenever the bible say
[28:29] all is not some
[28:30] all things put into life and godliness
[28:34] not godliness only but life and
[28:37] godliness
[28:38] god is interested in your daily walk
[28:41] he's interested in your daily life
[28:43] he's interested in what happened this
[28:44] morning he's interested in how you're
[28:46] when to work he's interested if you're
[28:48] working from at home
[28:49] he's interested in how you pay your
[28:50] bills he's interested in whether you
[28:52] have a mortgage or not having a mortgage
[28:54] all of these things are important to god
[28:56] because you're part of his family
[28:57] anybody with me tonight
[29:01] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[29:03] great
[29:04] and precious promises that by these ye
[29:07] might be partakers
[29:08] of the divine nature having escaped the
[29:11] corruption that is in the world through
[29:13] lust
[29:14] and now we come into our scripture and
[29:16] besides this
[29:18] giving all diligence add to your faith
[29:20] virtue
[29:21] and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[29:23] temperance
[29:24] at the temperance patience and the
[29:26] patient's godliness
[29:27] and the godliness broadly kindness at
[29:29] the barley kindness charity
[29:31] for if these things be in you and abound
[29:34] they make you
[29:35] that he shall neither be barren nor
[29:37] unfruitful
[29:38] in the knowledge of our lord jesus
[29:40] christ
[29:41] but he that luckett these things is
[29:44] blind
[29:45] and cannot see afar off and had
[29:47] forgotten
[29:48] that he was pulled from his old sins
[29:51] wherefore the rather brethren
[29:53] give diligence this is what we're doing
[29:55] to make
[29:56] your calling and election sure for if
[29:59] you do
[30:00] these things you shall never fall
[30:03] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[30:05] unto you
[30:06] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
[30:09] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[30:11] wherefore listen i will not be negligent
[30:15] to put you always in remembrance of
[30:17] these things
[30:18] though you know them so i'm speaking to
[30:20] you do you know them
[30:22] i would not be negligent to put you
[30:25] always in remembrance of these things so
[30:27] peter is saying
[30:28] forgive me but i will be reminding you
[30:31] and i will be reminding you
[30:33] even though you know it already i i will
[30:35] not be
[30:36] negligent to come back and remind you
[30:38] though you know them
[30:39] and be established in the present truth
[30:43] yeah i think it meet or fit as long as i
[30:47] am in this tabernacle meaning as long as
[30:49] i am in his flesh
[30:50] to stir you up by putting you in
[30:52] remembrance
[30:54] listen knowing that shortly i must put
[30:57] off this my tabernacle even as our lord
[31:00] jesus christ had showed me
[31:02] moreover verse 15 i will endeavor
[31:06] that ye may be able after my decease in
[31:09] other words peter is saying after i am
[31:11] gone
[31:12] to have these things always in
[31:15] remembrance
[31:16] so peter was so passionate about what he
[31:20] was talking about here
[31:21] he said while i'm here i will be
[31:24] reminding you
[31:25] constantly and even when i'm gone
[31:28] i don't want you to forget these things
[31:30] i want to put things in place
[31:32] that you will always be reminded of
[31:34] these things
[31:37] 4 16 we have not followed callingly
[31:40] devised fables
[31:42] when we made known unto you the power
[31:45] and coming of our lord jesus christ but
[31:48] were eyewitnesses
[31:49] of his majesty for he receives from he
[31:52] received from god
[31:53] the father honor and glory when there
[31:56] came such a voice to
[31:58] him from the excellent glory this is my
[32:00] beloved son
[32:01] in whom i am well pleased and this voice
[32:04] which came from heaven we heard
[32:06] when we were with him in the holy mount
[32:09] we have also a more sure word of
[32:12] prophecy
[32:12] where unto ye do well that you take heed
[32:15] as unto a light that
[32:17] shine it in a dark place until the day
[32:19] dawn and the day start arise in your
[32:21] hearts
[32:22] knowing this first that no prophecy of
[32:25] the scripture
[32:26] is of any private interpretation for the
[32:29] prophecy
[32:30] came not in all time by the will of man
[32:33] but
[32:33] holy men of god speak as they were moved
[32:36] by the holy ghost may the lord have a
[32:40] blessing
[32:41] to the reading of his word
[32:45] we're not finished so
[32:48] i'm reading this here and if you
[32:52] didn't know the story of peter and you
[32:55] just read
[32:56] and that's that is just two parts of two
[32:58] chapters of first and second peter
[33:01] peter this man we read in this peter who
[33:06] is speaking
[33:06] under inspiration has such a story
[33:10] that took him to this place of such
[33:12] confidence and that is what
[33:14] to me is a great encouragement to us all
[33:17] because the peter who is speaking here
[33:19] is not the peter who this is not the
[33:22] same way peter was when jesus
[33:24] first met him so i want to make the
[33:27] point that
[33:28] the person who jesus met the first time
[33:31] and this
[33:32] man who is speaking here it looks like
[33:34] the same peter
[33:35] was a different man on the inside
[33:38] and if i want to talk about peter it's a
[33:40] story of great
[33:42] transformation peter is one of those
[33:45] peter is a such a
[33:47] it's almost like there's this contrast
[33:50] on the one hand
[33:51] he seems as he makes a a irrational
[33:53] decision
[33:54] on the next hand he ready to say lord
[33:56] did i you bid me to come
[33:57] he he is a mixture of so many highs
[34:01] and lows and emotions that i believe he
[34:04] can be an encouragement to us all
[34:06] tonight
[34:07] but before i go a bit deeper there's a
[34:09] quote i want to read from the prophet
[34:11] from the message here he him and in it
[34:14] is something that
[34:15] is a quote that always stuck with me and
[34:17] it kind of lays
[34:18] a bit of of something i wanted to touch
[34:20] on before we kind of dig a little bit
[34:21] more into in the life of peter
[34:23] in the message he him but ibrahim was
[34:25] speaking here about adoption he said you
[34:27] know what happened then
[34:28] when that child come to a certain age
[34:31] that that boy that had he
[34:33] had been a bad boy and was not exactly
[34:35] what he found that could trust him
[34:36] he never had any inheritance at all you
[34:38] brethren know that from the scripture
[34:41] but if he was an obedient son and when
[34:43] he become to a certain age the same son
[34:46] was taken out
[34:47] into a public place before the public
[34:50] and he was put up on a high place
[34:51] and there the father put a robe on him
[34:54] and he adopted
[34:55] his own son into his family and on this
[34:58] placing of this son the son's name
[35:00] was just as good on a check as his
[35:02] father's was
[35:03] because he had been proven he was
[35:06] obedient
[35:07] and his name was good just the same as
[35:09] the father
[35:10] that's what jesus meant when he said ask
[35:12] the father anything in my name i'll do
[35:14] it notice then
[35:16] god never asked anybody to do anything
[35:19] but what he did at first he pronounced
[35:21] death upon the human race he was made
[35:23] flesh
[35:23] and taken death for us now he was going
[35:26] to adopt his own son
[35:28] into his family he took him up on mount
[35:31] transfiguration
[35:32] a high place before the public he
[35:34] brought three
[35:35] witnesses of the earth a tree is a
[35:37] confirmation we know that
[35:39] he had three witness of the earth tree
[35:41] witnesses from heaven
[35:42] and there he clothed christ he
[35:43] overshadowed him and his raymond
[35:46] shine like the sun in the middle of the
[35:47] day that road he placed in him showing
[35:50] that he had accepted him he was about
[35:52] the father's business
[35:53] he did just what the father showed him
[35:55] god was with him
[35:57] peter said at pentecost jesus of
[35:59] nazareth a man approved of god
[36:01] among you by signs and wonders oh
[36:04] wouldn't it be
[36:05] wonderful if the church was in that
[36:07] condition to be
[36:08] obedient to the father reverent and
[36:11] placed in the holy ghost
[36:13] in those tight places when you're afraid
[36:16] to speak up
[36:17] if like a gentleman you stand where you
[36:19] should stand like a lady
[36:21] you take the place not with the world
[36:23] but with christ
[36:25] reckoning yourself dead to the things of
[36:27] the world and in conferences and
[36:29] gatherings
[36:30] where you ministers stand and your
[36:32] conference begins to talk against the
[36:33] supernatural
[36:34] against this or this was for another age
[36:37] take your stand
[36:38] god will honor you oh my thought goes
[36:41] out to that day
[36:42] that david danced around the ark and his
[36:44] wife laughed at him but god said he's a
[36:46] man
[36:46] after my own heart sure you can't stand
[36:49] with men
[36:50] and god too if you're a servant of god
[36:52] you can't be a servant of god if you're
[36:54] serving a god you won't be a silvante
[36:56] man
[36:57] no i want to come down to my point here
[37:00] now notice let's drop back time's about
[37:02] go on but i want to get something you
[37:04] peter got all excited the supernatural
[37:06] had been done
[37:07] there stood moses and elijah both been
[37:10] there for years here they were standing
[37:12] alive standing there with jesus
[37:14] witnesses two of the mightiest prophets
[37:16] that ever walked
[37:17] standing by the side to watch god adopt
[37:19] his own son it gave him all the powers
[37:22] in heaven and earth
[37:23] give into his hands and this is the
[37:25] quote here
[37:26] he will do for you the same if you
[37:29] stand after you receive the holy ghost
[37:32] and make yourself a christian
[37:34] and act like a christian should
[37:37] and that quote always blessed me
[37:40] because it said after the holy ghost you
[37:44] still
[37:44] make yourself a christian he said you
[37:46] stand after you receive the holy ghost
[37:49] and make yourself a christian and act
[37:52] like a christian
[37:53] should and it connects into this the
[37:56] fact that you knew birth
[37:57] as an experience but abraham put it like
[38:00] you're born as a spiritual being
[38:02] and that being has to grow and grow and
[38:04] grow and grow into
[38:06] maturity spiritual maturity but
[38:08] abandoned gives you type of feeding on
[38:09] your word
[38:10] and you grow he said you drink a little
[38:12] more and you grow and you drink a little
[38:14] more
[38:14] and you grow and you drink a little more
[38:16] and a lot of people
[38:19] really have a have an experience and
[38:21] they don't have growth
[38:22] and the growth and the experiences that
[38:25] come after experience after experience
[38:27] is what really develops the
[38:28] character in you so this message
[38:32] or this teaching tonight is about
[38:34] character
[38:35] development and the story of peter
[38:38] and the lesson of peter was one of
[38:41] character development
[38:42] because god took a man who was we know
[38:45] it peter
[38:46] wasn't a learned man he wasn't like paul
[38:48] he wasn't an academic
[38:50] he was a man with no education he wasn't
[38:53] off no fancy
[38:54] job or profession in that time he was a
[38:57] fisherman
[38:58] and brother branham brought it out he
[38:59] was a simple man
[39:01] but god came and took this simple man
[39:05] and through his experiences one after
[39:08] the other
[39:09] god began to mold and shape this man
[39:12] into what we just read where to this day
[39:16] we can look at the scripture and still
[39:18] say add to your faith virtue
[39:20] and the virtue knowledge this is the man
[39:22] we're reading from
[39:24] that this scripture is is what we want
[39:27] to
[39:28] be able to live out faith virtue
[39:29] knowledge temperance patient godliness
[39:31] probably kindness
[39:32] but this man had his own struggles
[39:36] this is a man who never thought he would
[39:38] deny christ i want you to
[39:40] just kind of we're just talking about
[39:42] peter tonight
[39:43] he never thought he would deny christ he
[39:45] never thought he would see what he would
[39:47] see
[39:49] and i realized that it is easy to look
[39:51] at peter and say but peter deny christ
[39:54] but many times experiences in life comes
[39:57] and many times you don't know how you
[40:00] will deal with the situation until the
[40:01] situation comes
[40:05] because peter himself didn't believe he
[40:07] would deny christ
[40:10] in fact when jesus told peter that he
[40:12] will deny me peter said no that can
[40:14] happen that's not happening
[40:16] peter himself did not believe that he
[40:19] was going to deny christ
[40:22] that is why when he end up denying
[40:23] christ he wept bitterly
[40:25] because the reality was he didn't
[40:28] realize how vulnerable he was
[40:32] and despite that god was showing peter
[40:36] that my four knowledge
[40:39] my predestination is bigger than your
[40:41] mystique
[40:42] i already see you deny me i already see
[40:45] you restored
[40:47] anybody with me tonight peter
[40:50] is a testimony of god's foreknowledge
[40:54] being bigger than every mistake that
[40:56] peter made
[40:59] you know peter was so
[41:02] such a special character you know he
[41:04] rebuked jesus
[41:08] you you know what the audacity is to
[41:12] rebuke jesus
[41:15] it is i think is it mark let me go to
[41:19] mark i have different scriptures here
[41:24] mark eight
[41:28] this is jesus and um
[41:32] this is similar to matthew 16. so what
[41:35] is the way any word
[41:36] is is written in him he said this is
[41:38] mark eight and verse one
[41:39] and he said unto them but whom say he
[41:41] that i am and peter answered and said
[41:43] unto him thou art the christ
[41:44] and he charged them that they should
[41:46] tell no man of him
[41:48] and he began to teach them that the son
[41:50] of man must suffer many things and be
[41:52] rejected of the elders
[41:54] and of the chief priests and scribes and
[41:56] be killed and after three days
[41:58] rise again and he speak that openly and
[42:02] peter took him and began to rebuke him
[42:08] it takes a special kind of man to pull
[42:10] the lord jesus answered the rebuke you
[42:11] know
[42:11] you know to rebuke him
[42:16] but this is peter operating in what he
[42:19] understands he's operating
[42:21] with his understanding he's operating
[42:23] with his feeling
[42:24] with his emotions with what he's going
[42:26] through and he find that
[42:28] jesus shouldn't do that i want to start
[42:31] to work with it for a minute to
[42:32] understand in
[42:33] our own lives because he doesn't have
[42:36] the
[42:36] understanding of what this all means so
[42:39] because he is limited
[42:40] in his understanding he is judging it by
[42:43] his understanding
[42:44] but he is fearless and taken action and
[42:47] has the audacity to rebuke jesus
[42:49] and the next verse says and when he had
[42:51] turned about and looked at his disciples
[42:53] he rebuked peter so jesus now returned
[42:56] your rebuke to peter and say get thee
[42:59] behind me satan
[43:01] for those savories not the things that
[43:03] be of god but the things that be of men
[43:06] so in this case here this same man peter
[43:10] who we just read and that's why i
[43:11] started i started at the end
[43:13] so work how you reach there
[43:17] because nobody starts there anybody with
[43:20] me
[43:21] all right so we are on our road to
[43:24] adoption
[43:25] we're on the road to perfection we're on
[43:27] our road to transformation
[43:29] so along the journey this is the
[43:31] encouragement to us as believers of the
[43:32] church tonight
[43:33] along the journey they are stumbling
[43:35] points along the journey
[43:37] there will be things you don't
[43:38] understand yet but we have an
[43:40] encouragement
[43:41] because we see in the grace of god and
[43:44] if the same grace
[43:46] that god extend to peter could apply to
[43:48] your life then you could be encouraged
[43:50] tonight
[43:50] that he was able to transform peter
[43:54] peter was with his excitement and his
[43:56] excitement with his lack of knowledge
[43:57] through
[43:58] and god could say listen this is the man
[44:01] that i want to use to do certain things
[44:03] this is the same peter here who get the
[44:06] behind me satan for those savories the
[44:08] things that be of
[44:09] that that service not the things that be
[44:11] of god but the things that be of men
[44:13] so at that time god was saying peter you
[44:16] cannot
[44:17] know
[44:20] but the encouragement here is peter's
[44:22] change was yet to come
[44:24] anybody with me peter's change was still
[44:27] coming
[44:28] and whenever whenever situations happen
[44:30] in your life right now
[44:32] i want you to have the positive fee to
[44:34] say my change is still coming
[44:37] god is not finished with me yet
[44:41] my story is not over yet my story is
[44:44] still being written
[44:45] anybody with me tonight my story is not
[44:49] over
[44:53] anybody with me
[44:57] so peter we know jessica cannot touch
[44:59] and i want to it's a specific situation
[45:01] i'm trying to come to
[45:03] trust will be a blessing to you peter
[45:06] had a great privilege
[45:08] to be able to be part of quality
[45:11] the circle around jesus
[45:14] without a big education without being a
[45:17] big family
[45:18] he was called as a fisherman to be
[45:20] official of
[45:21] men even peter being called
[45:25] had testimonies in there because the
[45:28] bible said that when jesus
[45:31] people were coming to him and he decided
[45:33] to continue
[45:34] teaching he was by the sea so he stepped
[45:36] on a boat
[45:38] happened to be peter's boat and jesus is
[45:40] teaching from peter's boat
[45:43] and peter there washing here he had been
[45:45] washing his neck he was frustrated he
[45:47] didn't catch anything at all
[45:48] and jesus told peter cassian plural
[45:52] plural on the other side
[45:55] peter could be so such a character
[45:58] he didn't listen full obedience he cast
[46:01] the bible said annette single
[46:03] singular and in ned brook
[46:06] and over and over you see situations
[46:08] where peter
[46:09] was either doing part is either he do
[46:11] something kind of reluctantly you didn't
[46:13] have it or you didn't
[46:14] so much like a lot of is you build me to
[46:16] come and he jumped on it in the water
[46:18] until he realized well i cannot i cannot
[46:20] over
[46:20] over jump a little bit but i have to
[46:23] give peter credit
[46:24] because peter wasn't afraid to try
[46:28] peter was enough for it to to put his
[46:31] action where his belief was
[46:34] up until the point that a situation come
[46:37] that
[46:39] makes him go through something or feel
[46:41] something or experience something
[46:42] that he never experienced before or
[46:44] never dealt with before
[46:46] and this is the thing about life friends
[46:47] and when i look at the gospel and
[46:49] and i look at the word because you have
[46:52] not experienced every situation in life
[46:54] there are things that are in us that you
[46:56] don't know there
[46:58] i'll say it one more time
[47:01] there are things in us that you don't
[47:03] know there until
[47:04] the experiences come to show what's
[47:06] there
[47:07] and god allows situations to unfold to
[47:10] reveal what's in us
[47:12] everybody with me building a little bit
[47:17] so peter as we know he became almost the
[47:20] we call it the informal leader of the 12
[47:23] he was always like the first to give a
[47:24] response
[47:26] to to to make a statement to say
[47:30] something it would seem at times he
[47:33] didn't
[47:33] he didn't think too much before he spoke
[47:36] he was prone to get very excited
[47:38] that is not necessarily a bad quality
[47:40] but his excitement got him in trouble
[47:42] plenty times
[47:44] he had the the best of desires
[47:47] but under pressure
[47:50] so we see when jesus said wouldn't you
[47:53] watch with me
[47:54] when people will be watching peter
[47:56] sleeping
[47:59] when the when they came to get jesus
[48:02] he's the man who pulled his sword out
[48:03] and chop of the ears
[48:06] so we see a level of of of ups and downs
[48:10] with peter
[48:11] when i guess the greatest trial for
[48:13] peter being peter's denial
[48:16] of jesus and i want to suggest process
[48:19] that for a little bit
[48:21] because the denial of jesus came
[48:24] this is close to the end of jesus
[48:27] ministry
[48:28] so peter would have seen all the
[48:30] miracles
[48:32] he would have witnessed he'd dead being
[48:33] raised he would have witnessed
[48:35] feeling of the five thousand he would
[48:37] have witnessed miracle after miracle
[48:38] he would have been a witness at hmong
[48:40] transfiguration
[48:44] and under pressure when he never told
[48:47] that he
[48:48] didn't have it in him to backslide
[48:52] pressure brought something out of peter
[48:54] that he didn't know he had
[48:58] so i want to encourage us tonight
[49:01] throughout every trial and situation
[49:03] that you go through
[49:04] that you have to look beyond your
[49:07] failures and your mystics
[49:08] to see your spiritual encounter
[49:12] you have to look beyond your up and
[49:14] downs to see the upper room
[49:17] and you have to see that when you have
[49:20] that
[49:21] experience with god that there's still
[49:24] the making yourself a christian because
[49:27] one once you even have the holy ghost
[49:30] you have life to deal with you know
[49:32] the holy ghost doesn't remove your bills
[49:34] you know
[49:38] so let's let's let's put it so
[49:42] so you think adopt be being adopted with
[49:45] with with suddenly the bank the mortgage
[49:47] you build windham
[49:53] there has to be a balance with your
[49:56] spiritual growth spiritual maturity
[49:58] spiritual inheritance and still being
[50:00] able to live in this world that we don't
[50:01] know
[50:01] until such time as god calls us out of
[50:04] here you know
[50:06] so it means that even when as you grow
[50:09] in the spirit
[50:10] you will still have frustrations
[50:14] uh-huh oh some of you told that when you
[50:17] have an encounter with god
[50:18] there's no more frustration
[50:21] oh you told that that as you're pushing
[50:23] towards and you're striving
[50:25] and you're climbing higher that suddenly
[50:27] is a stress-free life
[50:29] is that anywhere in the wood
[50:34] so it is not as if a spiritual
[50:36] experience or adding
[50:38] suddenly means that that your credit
[50:41] card bill
[50:42] mp anymore you know
[50:48] but your spiritual maturity and your
[50:50] spiritual experience
[50:52] repositions your glasses with how you
[50:55] look at situations
[50:57] and it increases your trust in god and
[51:00] your reliance on god
[51:01] with how to approach different
[51:03] situations for him to now lead you in
[51:06] places that
[51:07] you may not even be comfortable to go
[51:09] and we're going to get into
[51:10] the teaching because i do it all it's a
[51:12] billion dollar situation
[51:14] around peter's life that we cannot we
[51:17] talk about it but we kind of glaze over
[51:19] it a little bit
[51:20] to see that people who have an ex a
[51:23] spiritual experience
[51:25] you have to make sure but the brandon
[51:27] presented it as as doors indoors
[51:30] he said listen you could bring the lord
[51:32] into your living room and leave him
[51:34] right there
[51:36] he said when you invite a guest you
[51:38] could choose to keep on living but you
[51:39] don't want them going to the kitchen at
[51:41] all because then they get into the
[51:42] kitchen and they open your fridge
[51:44] you know all your all your food might go
[51:46] or what whatever the situation is i
[51:48] don't know
[51:49] but he says the more trust you have in
[51:52] somebody
[51:53] is the more rooms in your house you're
[51:55] comfortable for them to go into
[51:57] anybody with me tonight and the reality
[52:01] is
[52:01] god wants all of us every single part of
[52:05] us
[52:05] not 80 percent so so god must be able to
[52:09] walk into your office
[52:11] sit on the desk next to you and you
[52:14] supposed to be able to operate the way
[52:15] you normally operate remember pause
[52:17] there a little bit
[52:20] i can say that one more time he's
[52:22] supposed to be able to walk into your
[52:24] workplace
[52:25] and sit in the desk next to you and you
[52:28] operate or you normally operate in other
[52:31] words
[52:32] you're not supposed to change your
[52:33] behavior
[52:35] because he is there now your behavior
[52:38] supposed to be the same way because
[52:41] you're
[52:41] conscious of his presence anybody with
[52:44] me
[52:45] so this is how the spiritual maturity
[52:47] comes because
[52:48] if you do have a bill to pay as a son of
[52:51] god there has to be an approach
[52:52] repeating the bill you can't be
[52:54] flying on the handle because when it was
[52:56] time to pay the bill god was interested
[52:58] in it too you tell them go catch a fish
[53:01] and and when they catch the fish and
[53:02] they did the work to catch the fish
[53:04] and they cut it open and they had the
[53:06] coin in there
[53:07] anybody with me so it's not as evide
[53:10] and and for that brief moment you forget
[53:13] you're a christian
[53:15] anybody with me i'm trying to bring the
[53:18] reality of
[53:19] life and living in the spirit living
[53:22] with the spirit have any spirit
[53:24] and living in this world that we are in
[53:27] and maintaining a testimony
[53:35] some years ago i preached a message
[53:36] between sundays
[53:39] i think i did as a youth service and i
[53:41] mentioned it to you saying
[53:42] the real christian walk is what happens
[53:44] between sundays
[53:47] because on sunday oh forget it talk
[53:50] about anointing
[53:52] talk about inspiration talk about leave
[53:54] and charge your battery full
[53:56] on 100. but by the time you meet your
[53:59] boss you're encounter your tire went
[54:01] flat
[54:01] you're building something happens
[54:03] something happened your whole testimony
[54:05] is now uh you remember when it used to
[54:08] be
[54:09] because you reach so far out of the
[54:11] spirit
[54:12] anybody with me so let me get to
[54:16] the the teaching i wanted to get to
[54:18] tonight
[54:20] all of this here was a little background
[54:22] uh to kind of place context
[54:24] on this so we're gonna touch on an
[54:26] experience that peter had because
[54:27] we're holding in on peter in a certain
[54:29] experience and i want to bring it to us
[54:32] because this part in part came out of a
[54:35] question about
[54:36] one after he getting hold he goes he
[54:37] make himself a christian and two
[54:40] a lot of people wonder how could people
[54:42] claim to have the holy ghost
[54:44] or have an experience and behave the way
[54:46] they do
[54:47] anybody ever thought about that
[54:52] people claim big revelation big
[54:54] experience when they
[54:55] when when when you see them in operation
[54:57] you see it now
[54:59] something wrong and the issue is not so
[55:02] much about something wrong you know
[55:04] the issue is there's a lot more growth
[55:07] to do
[55:08] and the reality is you can't lay back
[55:10] and rest
[55:11] on an experience so there are a lot of
[55:14] people who rest on
[55:16] you remember how it was you you're
[55:17] remember 83. you remember oh and you
[55:20] remember this experience i remember when
[55:21] we were in this meeting and remember
[55:23] this is it but the reality is this
[55:25] if you don't stay in the spirit
[55:28] there much people have testimonies of 83
[55:31] and yet and they're not nowhere near
[55:33] christ
[55:33] right now
[55:36] because life has gotten in the way
[55:40] situations have gotten in the way and
[55:42] they've had experiences that challenge
[55:44] their work or their thinking or they
[55:45] believe about something
[55:47] or they have allowed people in the world
[55:50] or in church to move them from their
[55:53] place of personal revelation
[55:56] so let's kind of drive home a little bit
[55:59] acts 10 so we're now going to look at
[56:02] peter
[56:03] from the book of acts and for those who
[56:05] familiar with it then we're going to end
[56:06] up in the book of galatians
[56:08] all right acts 10
[56:11] said there was a certain man in caesarea
[56:14] called cornelius
[56:16] a centurion so he's not a jew he's a
[56:19] gentile all right
[56:20] a centurion of the band called the
[56:22] italian band
[56:24] or what would be a band in this context
[56:27] is regiment
[56:28] so he's of of of the of the italian
[56:30] regiment would be
[56:31] the actual word all right so
[56:37] a devote man so here it has so
[56:40] this here is is a transitional state a
[56:42] transition has taken place
[56:45] all right because we know that jesus
[56:47] came to his own and his own
[56:48] refused him all right so god is already
[56:52] beginning to now work with the gentiles
[56:54] and we know that paul is the messenger
[56:56] of the age he's the one to
[56:58] really bring the message home but
[57:00] there's a transition taking place
[57:02] all right so god is also using peter
[57:05] in a ministry to the gentiles as well
[57:09] so here is this man and and this is a
[57:11] testimony for us all
[57:13] and this year is a powerful teaching
[57:14] here in cornelius because
[57:16] he still didn't come to a fullness of
[57:18] the revelation of who jesus was
[57:20] but the bible can say he was a devout
[57:22] man
[57:24] with the little that he knew i wanted to
[57:26] drive his home a little bit
[57:27] with the little that he knew he was
[57:29] devout about what he was convicted about
[57:33] i want to drive this home a little bit
[57:34] more so everybody in this room tonight
[57:38] no matter what stage you are in in your
[57:41] revelation of this message you have
[57:44] enough
[57:44] to be qualified as devout with what you
[57:46] know
[57:49] in other words nobody has an excuse to
[57:51] have a testimony of being devout
[57:54] because we would find out cornelius had
[57:56] an appointment
[57:57] with finding out who what this thing was
[57:59] really about but he had a testimony
[58:02] before he even came to the fullness of
[58:05] the revelation
[58:06] of who jesus was anybody with me
[58:09] a devout man and one that feared god
[58:12] with all his house
[58:15] so it takes great wisdom
[58:19] to be able to bring your house
[58:22] to appreciate what you believe so not
[58:25] only
[58:26] are digging down here a bit not only was
[58:28] cornelius devout and he believed
[58:32] but he was able to persuade he was able
[58:34] to convince he was able to encourage
[58:37] he was able to inspire he was able to
[58:40] motivate
[58:40] he was able to push he was able to lead
[58:43] he was able to guide
[58:45] he was able to influence you see all
[58:46] those words there
[58:49] because it doesn't happen by accident
[58:53] it doesn't happen by chance
[58:57] one that feared god with all his house
[59:00] so he is being
[59:01] the head of his home all right so i'm
[59:04] pushing now i'm pushing i'm pushing
[59:06] somewhere
[59:07] and i'm pushing to how god is still
[59:09] working he's working on him
[59:10] he's working on pizza he's working on
[59:12] you he's working on me
[59:14] cornelius is a fantastic display of
[59:17] being head of his home
[59:21] and this speaks of the responsibility of
[59:24] the leaders of houses
[59:26] leaders of homes it is something that
[59:29] many have abandoned a long time ago
[59:30] where the bible said we are kings and
[59:32] priests
[59:33] and i preached to the young people about
[59:35] two or so years ago
[59:36] that read the old testament there's no
[59:39] king
[59:40] who was also a priest
[59:43] because to be a priest he was a son of
[59:45] aaron he was of the tribe of the levites
[59:47] and the kings
[59:48] came from other tribes in particularly
[59:50] the tribe of judah
[59:52] but with this new covenant you are both
[59:54] a king
[59:55] and a priest so as a priest because the
[59:58] bible said he
[59:59] jesus is the high priest you can't be a
[1:00:02] high priest
[1:00:03] unless they are serving priests so it
[1:00:06] means that this is a meeting tonight of
[1:00:08] priests
[1:00:09] but it's not only a meeting of priests
[1:00:12] with he as the high priest
[1:00:14] it's also a meeting of kings because we
[1:00:16] are kings and he is called the king of
[1:00:18] kings
[1:00:20] so you have to understand your authority
[1:00:23] you have to understand your rank
[1:00:25] you have to understand your position and
[1:00:27] you cannot be a king without a kingdom
[1:00:30] and a kingdom is your domain or your
[1:00:32] dominion and your first domain or
[1:00:34] dominion is your home if your family is
[1:00:36] your house
[1:00:37] anybody with me it is your place of work
[1:00:41] not that you're ruling your boss but if
[1:00:43] you're on a desk that desk is your
[1:00:45] kingdom
[1:00:47] you could choose what you put on that
[1:00:49] desk
[1:00:50] what is in your domain your computer
[1:00:52] your phone your laptop all that is yours
[1:00:55] you can choose what you watch what you
[1:00:56] do let's bring it personal
[1:00:59] who you message what messages you
[1:01:01] receive
[1:01:02] you have influence authority and power
[1:01:05] but you don't realize it and you allow
[1:01:07] other things to influence you but let's
[1:01:10] keep going
[1:01:11] a devout man lord help me to be a devout
[1:01:14] man
[1:01:15] i challenge you tonight to be a devout
[1:01:17] man i challenge you to be a devout woman
[1:01:20] let these be words that describe you let
[1:01:22] these be words that describe
[1:01:24] me a devout man a man one that
[1:01:27] feared god with all his house
[1:01:30] which gave much arms to the people and
[1:01:33] prayed
[1:01:33] to god always can this be said about you
[1:01:38] bear in mind he didn't have an
[1:01:40] experience yet
[1:01:42] i'm building and i'm trying to move
[1:01:43] because i'm trying to get something i'm
[1:01:44] not dealing with cornelius
[1:01:46] i'm dealing i'm trying to deal with
[1:01:47] peter i'm still trying to get back to
[1:01:48] peter we you're studying how god used
[1:01:50] this and other situations
[1:01:52] to keep working on peter so
[1:01:55] because he was a devout man because he
[1:01:58] was praying
[1:01:58] because he was seeking god will not
[1:02:01] allow somebody to seek him
[1:02:03] because he said if you seek me with all
[1:02:05] your heart you will find me
[1:02:07] so this man don't know what you're
[1:02:09] really looking for but you know it had
[1:02:10] to be something out there
[1:02:11] there's a deep calling to her deep oh
[1:02:13] come on now so there got to be a deep to
[1:02:15] respond
[1:02:16] so this gentile this man who was not of
[1:02:20] the royal covenant
[1:02:21] he didn't know what the royal covenant
[1:02:23] was he was not of any tribe
[1:02:25] he is a gentile a centurion of the
[1:02:27] italian
[1:02:28] so by by saying italian ban he had no
[1:02:31] connection to the abrahamic covenant
[1:02:33] anybody
[1:02:34] with me tonight but he prayed always and
[1:02:38] he saw in a vision evidently
[1:02:39] about the ninth hour of the day which is
[1:02:41] like 3 p.m
[1:02:43] an angel of god coming into him and
[1:02:46] saying unto him cornelius
[1:02:48] and when he looked at him he was afraid
[1:02:50] and said what is it lord
[1:02:52] my my my mind and he said unto him thy
[1:02:54] prayers
[1:02:56] undyne arms are come up for a memorial
[1:02:59] before god
[1:03:02] can your prayers and your arms form a
[1:03:04] memorial before god
[1:03:07] anybody with anybody with me tonight
[1:03:11] what kind of memorial would we find in
[1:03:14] heaven
[1:03:16] for your prayers and your arms what
[1:03:19] actions are you taking because you
[1:03:20] already want
[1:03:21] you already want to be a christian
[1:03:23] anybody
[1:03:27] and now so based on what you have been
[1:03:30] doing
[1:03:32] in other words it's not just a desire he
[1:03:34] had but
[1:03:35] based on what he was doing he said
[1:03:39] now send men to dropper and call for one
[1:03:42] simon whose surname is peter
[1:03:46] so this cornelius is living his life
[1:03:50] searching for god and because god has
[1:03:53] men
[1:03:53] on the earth i want you to catch this
[1:03:55] now because god
[1:03:57] has men on the earth god will use who he
[1:04:00] has
[1:04:02] can the church say amen
[1:04:06] now send men to japan and call for one
[1:04:08] simon whose name is peter
[1:04:10] he lodged it with one simon a tanner
[1:04:13] whose house is by the seaside he shall
[1:04:16] tell thee
[1:04:17] what thou art is to do now
[1:04:20] it really takes you to trust god because
[1:04:24] god is speaking to him and god chooses
[1:04:26] to not tell him what to do
[1:04:28] i want you to catch this god talking to
[1:04:31] him what can i tell him go and do this
[1:04:33] no no no no but god i do that he said
[1:04:34] listen
[1:04:35] i'm talking to you now and my
[1:04:36] instruction is going to talk to one of
[1:04:38] my sons
[1:04:39] now no god is already dealing with simon
[1:04:43] peter because simon is by
[1:04:46] simon ditano
[1:04:50] and i want us to catch that if you read
[1:04:52] i think it's leviticus
[1:04:55] i think it's a little bit limited
[1:04:56] because 10 11 the bible speaks about
[1:04:58] anybody who deals with the skins of
[1:05:00] animals that are eaten it's unclean
[1:05:02] so god was dealing with peter because
[1:05:05] peter
[1:05:07] reach a point to be stained by somebody
[1:05:09] who was a tanner
[1:05:11] but god is pushing because he's getting
[1:05:13] ready to deal with the gentiles
[1:05:15] so there are these hints that god is
[1:05:18] beginning to deal with peter
[1:05:19] and his ministry to the gentiles all
[1:05:21] right so peter rage as far
[1:05:23] as staying by the house of atana right
[1:05:27] he shall tell thee what orders to do and
[1:05:29] when the angel
[1:05:30] which speak on two cornelius was
[1:05:33] departed
[1:05:34] he conned us called two of his household
[1:05:37] servants
[1:05:37] and a devout soldier of them had waited
[1:05:40] on him continually
[1:05:41] and when he had declared all these
[1:05:43] things unto them he sent them to dropper
[1:05:46] all right i don't know if i'm going to
[1:05:48] get to finish it all tonight but i
[1:05:49] really want to try
[1:05:51] on the morrow as they went on their
[1:05:53] journey and drew nigh
[1:05:54] onto the cet peter went up upon the
[1:05:57] house stop
[1:05:58] to pray about the sixth hour
[1:06:01] the six hour is midday all right so
[1:06:04] when last have you prayed at the six
[1:06:06] hour
[1:06:09] anybody just encouraging you know this
[1:06:12] is i'm not
[1:06:13] another bikini i guess just a question
[1:06:16] when last have you prayed that he's sick
[1:06:17] so
[1:06:20] cornelius was pregnant at the ninth hour
[1:06:22] you know he
[1:06:23] had where are the times you know you
[1:06:25] know you have to know what hour what how
[1:06:26] are you praying
[1:06:28] all right so and he became very hungry
[1:06:34] and would have eaten but while they made
[1:06:36] ready
[1:06:37] he fell into a trance so he was hungry
[1:06:41] he would have eaten but while they were
[1:06:44] me ready he's selling her trance and i
[1:06:47] want to now i want you to see this
[1:06:49] jesus is already crucified
[1:06:52] resurrection this is this is later on
[1:06:56] so upper room already take place many
[1:06:59] ship so i wanted to see the context
[1:07:01] right
[1:07:02] and he fell into a trance and saw heaven
[1:07:04] open and a certain vessel descending
[1:07:07] onto him as it had been a great sheet
[1:07:10] knit at the four corners and led down to
[1:07:12] the eighth
[1:07:13] wearing were all manner of four-footed
[1:07:16] beasts of the earth
[1:07:17] and wild beasts and creeping things and
[1:07:20] falls of the air
[1:07:22] so peter is seen like a vision as it
[1:07:23] were in a trance right
[1:07:26] and there came a voice in him rise peter
[1:07:28] kill and eat
[1:07:31] now i want us to understand something
[1:07:32] and this to me
[1:07:35] i'm not teaching doctrine but to me now
[1:07:38] i see him but wait a minute
[1:07:39] this is peter who was upper room peter
[1:07:42] this is peter who preacher 3000.
[1:07:44] this is peter who says silver and gold i
[1:07:47] don't have such as i have i give unto
[1:07:49] you
[1:07:49] this is peter there's nobody would
[1:07:52] question if peter had an experience with
[1:07:53] god
[1:07:55] there's nobody would question if peter
[1:07:57] heard from god
[1:07:58] there's nobody without it but here it is
[1:08:02] peter encounters something that
[1:08:06] in his mind and in the context of his
[1:08:08] experience
[1:08:09] he currently do it i want us to
[1:08:11] appreciate this
[1:08:12] in other words there was a part of the
[1:08:16] house of peter
[1:08:17] if i use any analogy of doors indoors
[1:08:20] there was a room in peter's heart
[1:08:22] that was yet to be consumed
[1:08:26] can we drive home with this so
[1:08:29] a lot of peter was under the control of
[1:08:32] the holy spirit
[1:08:33] but we are seeing here as we go further
[1:08:37] there came a voice in him rise peter
[1:08:39] kill and eat
[1:08:40] but peter said not so lord
[1:08:44] this is just a little bit above when
[1:08:48] peter was saying
[1:08:49] rebuke the lord this is peter directly
[1:08:53] or how are you going to say kind of
[1:08:54] rejecting what god's saying to him
[1:08:57] i want us to questions and pete is not
[1:09:00] rejecting it out of
[1:09:01] wanting to so just reject whatever you
[1:09:04] say to be rejectish you're not just
[1:09:06] trying to reject
[1:09:08] he said not so lord for i have never
[1:09:11] eaten anything that is common or unclean
[1:09:14] so peter pulling out a quote
[1:09:17] come on now he's pulling out the
[1:09:19] levitical law
[1:09:21] he's pulling out once again based on his
[1:09:24] understanding anybody with me he is
[1:09:27] pulling out based on the limits of his
[1:09:29] knowledge
[1:09:30] of what should be eaten and he's saying
[1:09:33] i already know if you're comfortable
[1:09:34] with this one oh lord
[1:09:37] and the voice speak unto him again the
[1:09:40] second time
[1:09:41] what god had cleansed that call not
[1:09:44] doubt come on
[1:09:45] in other words if i cleanse it you do
[1:09:48] have permission to now say this unclean
[1:09:51] but what struck me here and this is
[1:09:54] where when i say you slow down the
[1:09:56] scripture you get to process it
[1:09:58] the bible said this was done thrice
[1:10:01] three times that what's right means and
[1:10:04] the vessel was received up again into
[1:10:06] heaven
[1:10:07] no if somebody tells something once
[1:10:12] and you act on it then you get but here
[1:10:14] it is peter was so
[1:10:16] stubborn on this issue that god had to
[1:10:19] do it three times
[1:10:21] for this message to stick so
[1:10:25] when you look at this now it means then
[1:10:26] that
[1:10:28] and i want to bring it to us many have
[1:10:30] had experiences with god
[1:10:35] peter was holding on to a tradition
[1:10:39] he was holding on to history he was
[1:10:41] holding on to what he believed to be
[1:10:43] something to hold on to
[1:10:45] and god was showing him let that thing
[1:10:47] go
[1:10:49] and god had to repeat it repeat it
[1:10:51] repeat it and peter hardy holy ghost
[1:10:55] can i push can i push can i push
[1:10:58] so holy ghost phil peter god have to
[1:11:01] have him repeat first here
[1:11:02] repeat for us here repeat first say he
[1:11:04] can't graduate
[1:11:07] because something about his history his
[1:11:09] knowledge how he was raised can we push
[1:11:12] a little deeper
[1:11:13] his belief system how he tinctured
[1:11:16] supposed to be oh gosh let's let's let's
[1:11:17] push now
[1:11:18] how he think the minister supporter
[1:11:20] approached it how we supposed to do
[1:11:22] a service how we supposed to the way it
[1:11:25] was done for so many years was this way
[1:11:27] that he said it can't be the lord in him
[1:11:33] can i push can i push and peter has the
[1:11:36] holy ghost
[1:11:37] this is not an angel coming to him this
[1:11:40] is the lord coming to him
[1:11:42] dealing and the issue being dealt with
[1:11:45] is
[1:11:45] the interaction with the gentiles
[1:11:51] what god is dealing with god is showing
[1:11:53] him that
[1:11:54] listen i have a place in my kingdom
[1:11:57] for the gentiles how could you call them
[1:12:01] unclean when i give them clean space in
[1:12:04] this economy
[1:12:05] in this kingdom under this covenant
[1:12:08] you don't have a right to push them out
[1:12:11] come on now because if i let them in you
[1:12:14] have to drop whatever your perception of
[1:12:16] them are
[1:12:17] because i am welcoming them in and if i
[1:12:19] welcome them in
[1:12:20] you have to do it also and god have to
[1:12:23] give this servant multiple times him to
[1:12:25] get your message
[1:12:27] if peter didn't accept this lesson the
[1:12:30] dentist would have begun that would have
[1:12:32] never gotten place
[1:12:33] i wanted to catch us so i want to drive
[1:12:36] this home now
[1:12:37] to long-held beliefs that people have
[1:12:40] about who
[1:12:41] god will choose and how god will use and
[1:12:43] if god could bless and
[1:12:45] you you see how this turns this upside
[1:12:47] down when you say
[1:12:48] god kai use somebody or gokart turn
[1:12:51] somebody around or go can
[1:12:53] this just disrupts the whole thing all
[1:12:55] right i want to kind of speed here
[1:12:58] now why peter adopted in himself what
[1:13:00] this vision meant
[1:13:01] so after the three times he stepped
[1:13:03] doubting no no
[1:13:05] he wrestling with how heating
[1:13:08] distinction unfold
[1:13:09] and who he believed jesus come for all
[1:13:11] right
[1:13:13] don't worry peter doubted in himself
[1:13:14] what his vision which he had seen should
[1:13:16] mean
[1:13:17] behold the men which was sent from
[1:13:19] cornelius had made
[1:13:20] inquiry for simon's house and stood
[1:13:22] before the gate
[1:13:23] and called and asked whether simon which
[1:13:26] was surnamed peter were lodged in
[1:13:28] while peter taught on the vision the
[1:13:30] spirit said to him behold
[1:13:32] three me three men seek thee so the
[1:13:34] spirit is guiding peter now
[1:13:35] arise therefore and get thee down and go
[1:13:38] with them
[1:13:39] doubting nothing for i have sent them
[1:13:43] then peter went down to the men which
[1:13:45] was sent unto him from cornelius and
[1:13:47] said behold
[1:13:48] i am he whom you seek what is the cause
[1:13:51] where for you
[1:13:52] have come and they said cornelius a
[1:13:54] centurion
[1:13:55] a just man and one that feared god
[1:13:58] and of good report among all the nation
[1:14:01] of the jews
[1:14:02] was worn from god by an holy angel to
[1:14:04] send for thee
[1:14:06] into his house and to hear words of thee
[1:14:09] then call he them in and lodge them and
[1:14:12] on the morrow peter went away with them
[1:14:14] and certain brethren from joppa
[1:14:17] accompanied him
[1:14:18] so other brothers went with him too and
[1:14:21] the moral after they entered into
[1:14:23] caesarea
[1:14:24] and cornelius waited for them and had
[1:14:26] caught together his kinsmen and their
[1:14:28] friends
[1:14:29] and as peter was coming in cornelius met
[1:14:32] him and fell down at his feet
[1:14:34] and worshipped him but peter took him up
[1:14:37] saying stand up i myself also am a man
[1:14:41] and as he talked with him
[1:14:43] he went in and found many that will come
[1:14:45] together
[1:14:46] so cornelius was so convinced
[1:14:49] of what god told him he called his
[1:14:51] family he called his friends
[1:14:53] he called his relatives he called his
[1:14:55] neighborhood he said god
[1:14:56] gonna do something for me if you want to
[1:14:58] be part of it come and see that
[1:14:59] you you you see this man still i meet
[1:15:02] god yet
[1:15:03] he hunting he's searching but he's
[1:15:05] convinced of the answer
[1:15:06] so peter is blown away because peter
[1:15:08] coming commits an audience
[1:15:10] and listen to verse 28. so this is peter
[1:15:12] beginning to connect the dots he said
[1:15:14] he said unto them you know that it is an
[1:15:17] unlawful thing
[1:15:18] for a man that is a jew to keep company
[1:15:22] one or come unto one of another nation
[1:15:26] but god had showed me you
[1:15:29] you see now we understand what it is now
[1:15:31] everybody
[1:15:32] with me but god had shown me that i
[1:15:35] should not call
[1:15:36] any man coming or unclean
[1:15:41] you see that now this is a whole deep
[1:15:44] teaching we can't get into all of it
[1:15:46] tonight but be very careful because
[1:15:48] there's no man that you can call come on
[1:15:50] or unclean
[1:15:52] all those in the message who want to be
[1:15:55] pushing people out and saying
[1:15:57] one of the worst things that has plagued
[1:15:59] the messengers people in the message
[1:16:01] acting as if
[1:16:01] they have the monopoly on how god will
[1:16:03] operate with the rapture and how god
[1:16:05] will operate with a lot of things
[1:16:10] and you god is suffering god could save
[1:16:14] who we want he can deliver who he wants
[1:16:16] how he wants to do it
[1:16:21] and and people want to cut this one off
[1:16:23] this one
[1:16:24] finish they could never make it
[1:16:27] there's no room that that's before
[1:16:30] peter's experience
[1:16:31] that's what peter thought that these
[1:16:34] gentiles or let's change it these people
[1:16:37] who didn't believe the way he believed
[1:16:39] come on now these people who are
[1:16:41] different customs from his customs
[1:16:44] these people who are a different family
[1:16:45] they want for different race they were
[1:16:47] different
[1:16:48] but god is saying i am including them in
[1:16:50] my covenant
[1:16:52] let's race here because i need to get to
[1:16:53] the next section before my time is up
[1:16:57] but god had shown me i'm in verse 28
[1:17:00] again that i should not call any
[1:17:02] man come on or unclean verse 29
[1:17:05] therefore came i unto you without gain
[1:17:07] seeing
[1:17:08] as soon as i was sent for i asked
[1:17:11] therefore for what intent
[1:17:12] you have sent for me and cornelia said
[1:17:16] this is cornelius without an experience
[1:17:19] cornelius with all the fullness of the
[1:17:21] revelation
[1:17:22] four days ago i was fasting until this
[1:17:25] hour
[1:17:25] and at the ninth hour i prayed in my
[1:17:28] house and behold a monster before me in
[1:17:30] bright clothing
[1:17:31] and said cornelius thy prayer is heard
[1:17:33] and thine arms
[1:17:35] are hard in remembrance in the sight of
[1:17:37] god send therefore to joppa
[1:17:39] and call hither simon whose surname is
[1:17:42] peter he is lodged in the house
[1:17:44] of one simon at tanner by the seaside
[1:17:46] who when he come and shall speak unto
[1:17:48] thee
[1:17:48] immediately therefore i sent to thee and
[1:17:51] thou has well done
[1:17:52] that dawah come now therefore are we all
[1:17:55] here present
[1:17:56] before god to hear all things that are
[1:17:58] commanded be of god
[1:18:00] and then peter opened his mouth and said
[1:18:02] for truth i perceive that god is no
[1:18:04] respecter of persons
[1:18:05] and in every nation he that feared him
[1:18:08] and working righteousness
[1:18:10] is accepted with him that's why when the
[1:18:12] prophet say he's gonna call from the
[1:18:13] methodist he quoted me baptist he's
[1:18:15] gonna call he said it'll be a great
[1:18:16] united
[1:18:17] time we don't know how it's gonna happen
[1:18:19] but we have to trust god
[1:18:21] the message needs to stop acting like
[1:18:23] they're better than anybody else
[1:18:25] the same grace of god that reach you
[1:18:27] that reach me
[1:18:28] could reach anybody we are no better
[1:18:30] than anybody i am no better than anybody
[1:18:33] can the church say amen
[1:18:36] oh hallelujah hallelujah and if you
[1:18:39] adopt that attitude
[1:18:40] god could begin to use you for his
[1:18:42] kingdom how can you help somebody
[1:18:44] if you operate like you're better than
[1:18:46] them that's how peter was before he had
[1:18:47] his encounter
[1:18:48] but let's push in every nation he'd have
[1:18:52] feared him and worked
[1:18:53] righteousness is accepted with him and
[1:18:56] the word which god sent
[1:18:58] unto the children of israel preaching
[1:19:00] peace by jesus christ he is lord of all
[1:19:02] that would i say you know which was
[1:19:04] published throughout all judea
[1:19:06] and began from galilee after the baptism
[1:19:08] which
[1:19:09] john bapu john preached how god anointed
[1:19:12] jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost
[1:19:14] and with power
[1:19:15] who went about doing good and healing
[1:19:18] all that were oppressed and of the devil
[1:19:20] for god was with him and we are
[1:19:22] witnesses of
[1:19:23] all things which he did both in the land
[1:19:25] of the jews and in jerusalem
[1:19:27] whom they slew and hung on a tree him
[1:19:29] god raised up the today he preached a
[1:19:31] whole message there
[1:19:32] and showed him openly not to all the
[1:19:34] people
[1:19:35] but unto witnesses hallelujah chosen
[1:19:38] before of god
[1:19:39] oh hallelujah so not everybody can see
[1:19:42] this but unto witnesses
[1:19:43] chosen before of god even to us who did
[1:19:46] eat and drink with him
[1:19:48] after he rose from the dead and he
[1:19:50] commanded us to preach unto the people
[1:19:52] and to testify that it is he which was
[1:19:56] ordained of god
[1:19:57] to be the judge of the quick and dead to
[1:20:00] him
[1:20:00] gave all the prophets witness that
[1:20:02] through his name
[1:20:04] whosoever believeth in him shall receive
[1:20:06] remission of sins
[1:20:07] and while peter yet speak his words the
[1:20:10] holy ghost fell on all them
[1:20:11] with heard the word so by virtue of
[1:20:14] cornelius
[1:20:15] being persuaded to invite his family and
[1:20:18] his friends
[1:20:19] and his relatives as peter yet speak
[1:20:21] these words so when you hear the
[1:20:23] preacher say it this is where it comes
[1:20:24] from
[1:20:24] and as peter yet take these words the
[1:20:27] holy ghost
[1:20:28] fell on all them which heard the word
[1:20:30] and dear listen
[1:20:32] and day of the circumcision in other
[1:20:34] words the brothers
[1:20:35] who came with peter which believed were
[1:20:38] astonished
[1:20:39] so god shocked them hallelujah may god
[1:20:42] shock
[1:20:42] some more believers with who god will
[1:20:45] use hallelujah
[1:20:46] may god shock some believers with how
[1:20:49] god will take
[1:20:50] anybody and bring them into the economy
[1:20:53] of god
[1:20:53] and they of the circumcision which
[1:20:56] believe were astonished
[1:20:58] as many as came with peter because that
[1:21:01] on the gentiles
[1:21:02] also was poured out the gift of the holy
[1:21:04] ghost
[1:21:06] for they heard them speak with tongues
[1:21:08] and magnify god
[1:21:09] then answer peter can the church give
[1:21:12] the lord
[1:21:12] some praise god is sovereign
[1:21:16] his grace is wonderful so i want to kind
[1:21:19] of bring it a quick close
[1:21:21] but i want us to see then because we
[1:21:23] still now this is peter
[1:21:25] still learning still growing so peter
[1:21:28] with the holy ghost still being led
[1:21:30] and he is coming to a deeper revelation
[1:21:32] of how big god is
[1:21:34] because prior to this he was at the view
[1:21:37] that jesus only came to the jews
[1:21:39] come on now before this experience he
[1:21:42] was actually limiting god
[1:21:44] anybody with me before this experience
[1:21:47] he didn't know that god was bigger than
[1:21:49] his family
[1:21:50] bigger than his house bigger on his
[1:21:51] tribe bigger than the whole core of
[1:21:54] israel
[1:21:54] and god was interested in more than he
[1:21:56] even understood
[1:21:57] anybody with me tonight my last reading
[1:22:01] tonight is going to come from galatians
[1:22:04] and i want to kind of drill down now
[1:22:06] because you know with peter in
[1:22:08] particular
[1:22:10] peter is the man who said call me and he
[1:22:13] walk in the water
[1:22:14] and then peter fall in the water peter
[1:22:17] is
[1:22:17] is a is an interesting character in his
[1:22:19] journey so he's growing
[1:22:20] but he's growing in an interesting way
[1:22:23] now
[1:22:24] so a main reference that peter where the
[1:22:27] holy ghost
[1:22:28] wanted to tell him three times threw him
[1:22:30] three times him to accept this thing
[1:22:33] now this is the encounter now with paul
[1:22:37] and peter and i want to read from this
[1:22:39] is galatians 2.
[1:22:41] so this is paul speaking now and i want
[1:22:45] to
[1:22:45] just bring us our consciousness now
[1:22:48] of how it is so important
[1:22:52] for you to be able to stand by
[1:22:53] individual revelation
[1:22:57] so galatians 2 and verse 11.
[1:23:01] but when peter was come to antioch we
[1:23:03] could call this the antioch situation or
[1:23:05] the antioch incident
[1:23:07] but when peter was come to antioch i
[1:23:10] would stood him to the face
[1:23:12] because he was to be blamed in other
[1:23:13] words when peter
[1:23:15] was come to antioch i had to face off
[1:23:18] with peter
[1:23:21] for because for for before that listen
[1:23:24] to this
[1:23:25] certain came from james now bible
[1:23:28] scholars would know that at this time
[1:23:30] james was the pastor in jerusalem
[1:23:34] so brothers from the jerusalem church
[1:23:38] had come to visit antioch in good
[1:23:41] fellowship
[1:23:42] in good greetings to see all the
[1:23:44] brethren doing
[1:23:47] prior to those brothers coming from
[1:23:48] jerusalem brother clarence
[1:23:51] peter the bible says for before that
[1:23:54] certain came from james he did eat with
[1:23:57] the gentiles so
[1:23:58] peter is now totally
[1:24:01] accepting the gentiles he eaten with his
[1:24:03] entires he
[1:24:04] fellowship with the gentiles he would
[1:24:06] have had an experience with cornelius
[1:24:08] what can i differently call god taking
[1:24:09] him to our journey now so i want to kind
[1:24:11] of kind of bring this
[1:24:12] up close and to leave it to think a
[1:24:14] little bit but
[1:24:15] when they will come so when the brothers
[1:24:18] from
[1:24:19] the church in jerusalem reached
[1:24:22] he withdrew and separated himself
[1:24:26] fearing them which were of the
[1:24:28] circumcision
[1:24:30] so i want you to see something here now
[1:24:32] to make it this is the same peter
[1:24:35] god meets you on top of your house
[1:24:39] give you a revelation of having
[1:24:41] fellowship
[1:24:42] of feasting and and blessing but listen
[1:24:45] to
[1:24:45] i wanted to drop this here his fear
[1:24:48] of the brothers from jerusalem
[1:24:53] was greater than his experience
[1:24:57] i don't need time tonight to finish it
[1:24:58] but let me let me just kind of drive
[1:25:00] this home a little bit
[1:25:01] in other words he let them brothers
[1:25:04] make him forget his experience with god
[1:25:09] did him come to accuse him they didn't
[1:25:11] come
[1:25:12] soon he heard his brothers come he leave
[1:25:15] the table is that even sitting on a
[1:25:16] table with with some people eating
[1:25:18] i went in here with any brothers from
[1:25:19] jerusalem you mean from james
[1:25:24] you mean the brothers from you know
[1:25:25] james church
[1:25:28] [Music]
[1:25:30] um
[1:25:33] it's not you it's me it's not you is me
[1:25:35] and brother peter got up
[1:25:38] from eaton with i want you to see the
[1:25:40] context
[1:25:42] so this is not peer pressure from the
[1:25:44] world
[1:25:47] this is not peer pressure from the world
[1:25:48] now this is now
[1:25:50] inside the thing this is inside the
[1:25:52] message now this is inside the church
[1:25:53] now
[1:25:54] this is the lord because if you're not
[1:25:57] already show you something
[1:25:58] all right let's push home a little bit
[1:25:59] right is
[1:26:01] so i'm showing you how and this here is
[1:26:04] a city
[1:26:05] because anybody only when his situation
[1:26:08] come
[1:26:08] peter see what was still in him you know
[1:26:10] anybody with me
[1:26:11] if the brothers from james did not come
[1:26:14] let's push us home
[1:26:15] peter would have still been sitting
[1:26:16] eating with them normal
[1:26:19] but god raised up a situation
[1:26:22] so that peter could still see but
[1:26:24] whitner it's still a little in me in
[1:26:26] other words i'm valuing the opinion
[1:26:28] of the brothers from jerusalem a little
[1:26:31] more than what he lord show me about the
[1:26:33] gentile dispensation you know
[1:26:35] you see that there so listen to this
[1:26:39] as i wind along into a close this has so
[1:26:41] much
[1:26:42] spin off on it but i want to leave it in
[1:26:44] your mind this is the same peter
[1:26:46] walking water he's seeing peter who was
[1:26:48] there who preached on the day of
[1:26:50] pentecost the same peter called me the
[1:26:52] money house the same peter went to
[1:26:53] cornelius he's seen peter
[1:26:55] has a revelation god already dealing
[1:26:57] with him but he is still
[1:26:58] vulnerable to the opinions of man
[1:27:02] come on now the issue that paul
[1:27:05] had with him this is what it means it
[1:27:08] comes
[1:27:08] to he withdrew and separated himself
[1:27:11] fearing
[1:27:13] fear fearing them which were of the
[1:27:15] circumcision
[1:27:16] he allowed fear to be more to be greater
[1:27:19] than his experience
[1:27:22] and the other jews listen now the other
[1:27:25] jews
[1:27:25] december likewise with him in other
[1:27:28] words there were other jews just like
[1:27:30] the brothers who went
[1:27:31] to with him to cornelius who suddenly
[1:27:34] got a revelation at the holy ghost upon
[1:27:36] other people too
[1:27:37] there were other brothers there who when
[1:27:39] peter pulled back from the gentiles
[1:27:41] they pulled back also and to paul shock
[1:27:44] paul's complete shock he says in so much
[1:27:48] that
[1:27:48] barnabas also was carried away with this
[1:27:52] dissimulation
[1:27:54] the paradox of this as barnabas had
[1:27:56] worked with paul directly for 14 years
[1:27:59] dealing with the gentiles
[1:28:00] and barnabas i don't see them brothers
[1:28:02] from jerusalem i'm coming oh i can't eat
[1:28:04] i can't even return there no more
[1:28:09] so i want to know bring home we'll be
[1:28:11] studying peter and this is not just
[1:28:13] peter not because peter also has
[1:28:14] influence
[1:28:15] come on now so when you're in a position
[1:28:18] of influence
[1:28:19] so peter by his action in in a certain
[1:28:22] sense in strong words
[1:28:24] he almost had to lead him but at the
[1:28:25] backslide because this is why paul
[1:28:28] gets so upset listen now but when i saw
[1:28:31] that they
[1:28:31] walk not uprightly in other words
[1:28:35] this behavior was not upright behavior
[1:28:38] paul put under the gun peter all them
[1:28:41] brothers and man of us
[1:28:42] he said when i saw that they walk not
[1:28:45] uprightly
[1:28:46] according to the truth of the gospel
[1:28:48] what was the truth of the gospel the
[1:28:50] truth of the gospel
[1:28:51] was there was room for the gentiles and
[1:28:54] that the gentiles were not subject to
[1:28:55] the law of the jews
[1:28:57] so there should be no issue with with
[1:29:00] paul
[1:29:00] and peter and the gentiles and the jews
[1:29:03] god was dealing with them all
[1:29:04] she said when i saw that they walk not
[1:29:08] uprightly according to the truth of the
[1:29:10] gospel
[1:29:10] i said unto peter before them all
[1:29:14] so here paul peterson in front of them
[1:29:17] all
[1:29:17] if dog being a jew leave us after the
[1:29:20] manner of gentiles
[1:29:22] and not as do the jews why compel us
[1:29:25] though the gentiles
[1:29:26] live as do the jews for we who are jews
[1:29:29] by nature
[1:29:30] are not sinners of the gentiles knowing
[1:29:33] that a man is not justified by the work
[1:29:35] of the law
[1:29:36] but by the faith of jesus christ even we
[1:29:38] have believed in jesus christ
[1:29:40] that we might be justified by the faith
[1:29:41] of christ and not by the works of the
[1:29:43] law
[1:29:44] for by the work of the lord shall no
[1:29:45] flesh be justified and he goes on and
[1:29:47] i'm trying to close out here
[1:29:48] but i want to bring this down to a close
[1:29:52] as you go through life it is showing
[1:29:55] here that
[1:29:55] that peter was still growing he was
[1:29:58] still learning
[1:29:59] even with his spirit god was guiding he
[1:30:02] was still being rebuked as if jesus
[1:30:03] himself was there
[1:30:05] he was still being advised as if jesus
[1:30:07] himself was there because
[1:30:08] until his complete transformation
[1:30:11] until god was finished with him he still
[1:30:13] had growing up to lose i want to see
[1:30:15] with the take on the life of peter
[1:30:17] because many times a lot of people end
[1:30:19] the story with well peter was heading to
[1:30:21] the upper room
[1:30:22] and and he denied christ but he had the
[1:30:24] upper room coming and sure
[1:30:26] and god but really coming after the
[1:30:28] upper room
[1:30:29] there was still work going on after the
[1:30:31] upper room god still dealing with peter
[1:30:33] even so much that paul
[1:30:35] who was a messenger of the age had to
[1:30:37] straighten out peter
[1:30:39] and say peter you have to do better than
[1:30:40] that you know you can't be living
[1:30:43] this way with and when brothers come
[1:30:47] is it a genuine revelation that you have
[1:30:50] so as we close out friends
[1:30:52] i want to encourage you because this is
[1:30:56] a paradox i want you to meditate on it
[1:30:59] the brothers from jerusalem wasn't
[1:31:01] coming to lead them down no wrong road
[1:31:03] or no
[1:31:05] peter's fear of what they would think
[1:31:09] led him to be a certain way
[1:31:14] so i want us to be very conscious
[1:31:17] of other people's opinions and how the
[1:31:20] only opinion that matters is god's
[1:31:22] opinion
[1:31:24] that's the only opinion that matters
[1:31:28] because god deals with people in
[1:31:31] different ways
[1:31:33] god never dealt with the church in
[1:31:36] under james the way he dealt with peter
[1:31:38] and paul and the gentiles
[1:31:40] those brothers in jerusalem was never
[1:31:43] given the insight
[1:31:44] to see what god was doing and they still
[1:31:47] had the blessing of god
[1:31:48] god still work with them but god chose
[1:31:51] who to show
[1:31:52] what he wants to show
[1:31:56] you have to walk uprightly with the
[1:31:59] fullness of the revelation as revealed
[1:32:00] to you
[1:32:01] because you cannot get anything more
[1:32:03] than what god will reveal to you
[1:32:07] let me say that one more time you can't
[1:32:09] study what god will not reveal to you
[1:32:12] and this is why you could have no
[1:32:14] insecurity in your
[1:32:16] faith in god and his word because god is
[1:32:19] sovereign
[1:32:20] he said flesh and blood did not reveal
[1:32:22] this to you peter
[1:32:23] but my father in heaven in other words
[1:32:24] the revelation you have you didn't
[1:32:26] acquire it
[1:32:28] it is the father who gave you the
[1:32:30] revelation but the
[1:32:31] the encouragement tonight is if god has
[1:32:34] given you a revelation stand by the
[1:32:38] revelation
[1:32:40] that's what i want to drive home tonight
[1:32:42] because a lot of people
[1:32:43] have had experiences and i've had a
[1:32:45] revelation from god
[1:32:46] and allow the opinions of man in other
[1:32:49] words i wonder why he brought us a
[1:32:50] little thing boy
[1:32:52] wherever jerusalem may reside now i
[1:32:55] don't know where jerusalem is
[1:32:57] and whoever james may be or the number
[1:33:00] of people who hold the portfolio by
[1:33:01] james
[1:33:02] that could have influence
[1:33:06] for uh a man as strong as peter peter
[1:33:09] led them brothers from james
[1:33:11] put them under some manners and it's a
[1:33:13] great lesson to us all
[1:33:15] that peter his whole life that is live
[1:33:17] before us
[1:33:18] is a lesson of what to do what to avoid
[1:33:22] what to see what not to see the grace of
[1:33:24] god
[1:33:25] and at the end of it we can look now at
[1:33:28] and i'll close with this in first peter
[1:33:32] we started reading it in uh
[1:33:42] look at the exact first
[1:33:49] first peter verse 1 verse 10 of which
[1:33:52] salvation the prophets have inquired and
[1:33:54] searched diligently
[1:33:55] who prophesied of the grace that should
[1:33:56] come unto you searching
[1:33:58] what or what manner of time
[1:34:01] the spirit of christ which was in them
[1:34:04] that signify when it testified
[1:34:05] beforehand
[1:34:06] the sufferings of christ and the glory
[1:34:08] that would follow and peter is going on
[1:34:10] that's going on
[1:34:11] and uh i want to get down to
[1:34:16] substitute
[1:34:18] unto you therefore which believe he is
[1:34:21] precious but unto them which be
[1:34:23] disobedient
[1:34:24] and he goes on to bless nine but ye are
[1:34:26] our chosen generation
[1:34:27] by the time peter is writing this he's
[1:34:29] writing to a
[1:34:31] primarily to gentiles but ye are a
[1:34:34] chosen generation
[1:34:35] a royal priesthood and holy nation a
[1:34:38] peculiar people
[1:34:39] that he should show for the praises of
[1:34:41] him who will call you out of darkness
[1:34:43] you know talk about jews there
[1:34:45] into marvelous light which in time
[1:34:47] passed listen
[1:34:48] were not a people but are now the people
[1:34:50] of god
[1:34:51] which had not obtained mercy but now
[1:34:54] have obtained mercy
[1:34:55] you see the encouragement you see by the
[1:34:57] time peter finishes transformation
[1:34:59] hopefully they could preach
[1:35:02] daily beloved i beseech you as strangers
[1:35:04] and pilgrims abstain and he goes on
[1:35:06] having your conversation honest among
[1:35:08] the gentiles and he's speaking to
[1:35:10] so many lord richard bless you tonight
[1:35:12] in this little study of peter
[1:35:14] maybe an encouragement to you to have
[1:35:16] faith to keep pressing
[1:35:18] to stand by a revelation and if you're
[1:35:20] fall
[1:35:21] don't hesitate to get back up don't test
[1:35:24] me to be like peter
[1:35:25] and say save me i'm drunk then i stepped
[1:35:27] on faith and i need
[1:35:28] i needed to pull him up and he said
[1:35:30] jesus pull his hands up
[1:35:31] water know the encouragement that
[1:35:33] although peter was going to deny christ
[1:35:35] there was still a promise over him and a
[1:35:38] place for him
[1:35:39] that this denier of christ who slipped
[1:35:41] and felt so many times
[1:35:42] god is going to use him to say this is
[1:35:44] that which are spoken by the prophet
[1:35:46] joel
[1:35:47] these men are not drunk as you suppose
[1:35:49] and to see god saying listen peter
[1:35:51] i still have more for you to do because
[1:35:52] when you finish preach you have a work
[1:35:54] to do with the gentiles
[1:35:55] god knew that peter was the one to go to
[1:35:57] cornelius god knew he was he want to
[1:35:59] open certain doors
[1:36:00] god knew he god is so good may the lord
[1:36:03] is the bless you can we bow our heads
[1:36:05] for a word of prayer tonight heavenly
[1:36:07] father this
[1:36:08] little bible study around the life of
[1:36:11] peter a study of peter
[1:36:12] lord to see so many lord aspects of his
[1:36:16] life
[1:36:16] lord to see his ups and downs to see his
[1:36:19] encounter with the supernatural
[1:36:20] to see you trying to lord get more and
[1:36:23] more
[1:36:24] control of him lord to see how he can be
[1:36:26] used lord
[1:36:27] lord his ministry lord that was to the
[1:36:29] jews and then that switch
[1:36:31] lord where you begin to work with the
[1:36:32] gentiles to see how it is not easy for
[1:36:35] people to change
[1:36:36] it is not easy for people to adjust but
[1:36:38] it takes the spirit of god
[1:36:40] lord to open our understanding lord to
[1:36:42] see beyond how we
