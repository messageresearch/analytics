Revelation the devil jumped on Peter and Jesus rebuked that Spirit Get Behind Me Satan Jesus wasn't against Peter Jesus knew a spirit Came Upon him that was telling him something contrary to you the will of God for his life do you get that the will of God for his life was to die the will of his God for his life was to go to chemistry and her spirit will say no no don't go this dinoting enough for

so when the current went yesterday I said we'll tell us even go straight to come and read the scriptures and read it when they couldn't come back I said my this like like the Lord wants only know something out of this year because we bring any word you know I ain't bringing no dream from last night over here is the world because they can't overcome my dream you know but this word is assured that word is a short shout out sword I saw this cartoon Satan experience your soul already you know it is written it is written it is also written praise God this sword is dangerous you know oh glory to God because between the bone and the marrow and he's in the torturing intense of the heart oh praise God so God's church have a strength he said I want to speak of the strength of God in his church and this great contents have been going on for many years it started in heaven and Satan was kicked out into the Earth and he become an enemy to God's people and since then he used all of his strength and his strategy to try to pull God's people across the fires into his fire and we know who has the most power God does and God when he give the people the best thing that he could come back Satan with was his word the best thing the best thing there is a liar the best thing not smoking not drinking not piping yeah and you have to go and take a bath might be or something like that praise God and when some contrary close no no no the best thing God give us his word could somebody say Amen no because the word is God oh glory to God do you get that now the word is God the devil don't want you to know that the word itself is God the word itself is God in print praise God God big enough to guard that word praise God that every Prophet every messenger is subject to the word of God there's no man above the word praise God you can add or take away from the word every Ministry is subject to the word of God Oh Glory nobody is above the world or give the Lord a shout that means we are free praise God to preach the word and the word only I am subject to the word you are subject to the word everyone is shouting to this word or give the Lord some Praises this is not your house praise God

Direction inspiration discernment and leading how to operate inside our ear we have to line up with the word I'm gonna read up court amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah the word is God and the word becomes our strength God in the church becomes its strength to pull Satan to his own fires Jesus said in Mark 16 in my name they shall cast out Devils so when you recognize God as the word and the word is God then you are confident that God is with you because you have the word with you praise God you have the word with you then them Old Testament Saints didn't have the Holy Ghost but he had god with them Holy Ghost because Holy Ghost wasn't given yet but he had this Spirit upon them Samson didn't have the Holy Ghost but the spirit of God Came Upon Samson Samson did this and did that and he took it for granted he thought he was ordinary he was not the Holy Ghost upon him made him a different man the Holy Ghost upon Him gave him the strength to fight the enemy the Holy Ghost upon him give him the strength to find them filling things and Demon and so far the Holy Ghost upon you has given you strength to fight but the Holy Ghost is going to come in you they go to dwell in you you're going to become a dwelling house a Berlin Temple a place for God that God could abide in and walking and talking and living on two feet in Trinidad praise God I'm not talking about nowhere else you're going to be God praise will be failed inside of you in you in you foreign understanding and Define revelation of where you come from of where you're going who am I talking to tonight praise God hallelujah praise God Amen [Applause] let's go maybe seated I belong with you people don't believe even demons in this day that's why Halloween is a sport and a commercial thing the most ugliest faces the Hideous skeletons and everything about and the children will not get in frightened because that Halloween and all them all those um skeletons or them frightful looking things they not Lucifer you know that's how he used to be long time mostly that same devil has disguised himself in deceit and deception as the spirit of ever says the spirit of Truth because truth is not just a letter word you know there's a spirit of Truth Bradley kindness is not a quote or saying you know there's a spirit of forgiveness what does God say I desire truth from where from the inward paths who give the Lord a shout in the house Oh Glory to God he has said truth from the emotional he said is that truth from where the inward parts that mean inside of you should have to come forward when he told a woman I will go call your husband she said I have none he said truth you spoke the truth because you had five and he won you're living with it's not yours oh give the Lord Ash praise she was honest she was sincere she was truthful and she got delivered praise God so people don't believe in demons in this day but the thing to do to my opinion is not your enemy do you know your enemy know your enemy and know your enemy and train for the contest that you're going to have when you meet him because you are going to meet him ready or not prepared or not you're going to meet him so if you have to meet him you may as well be trained trying to get slammed chain they get punched when Buddha banana was boxing he said that man want to kill him he would cough him and knock him out straight out of the ring he said but you don't have to do it so hard he said bill this is practice right now he said in the ring you have to be able to bounce back and come back up really fast you have to be able to take a punch some people believe there was a Christian they have no punch they get that's a lie the devil lying to you you have to know how to bounce back from the punch praise God because our punch is coming praise God you have to have belly to take it you have to have guts to take it you have to have something to take it glory to God you have to be able to take a hit okay the Lord and shouting the house I don't know why I'm coming here to see all of this tonight praise God but if God wanted it said it's going to be said you have to be able to take a punch and get back up praise God don't stay long get back up again or give the Lord some praises here the Lord I shout in the house gotta know your enemy train for the contest and you're going to have to when you when you meet him because you are going to meet him and know him know his how what his strength is then train for this contest when you go to meet him for it is a schwanting sure you're going to meet him so train for the contest so if you look at nothing else in this service get this you're gonna meet him one and you have to be trained to meet him but if you train you can fight back Oh Glory to God Jacob knew he was licked when he got to this place where he allows to meet his brother all the time you're feeling strong you know you have different money bank account you have flux you have goats you have this here why you feel like you know but the nearer he gets to his brother is the less confidence he feel you know he said no Messenger to send gifts for his brother so much of this and that is different things coming you know with how much how much hundreds are men when he had flux and he have wives and children and whoever turning up he said they come in here they're riding they're coming that's when all strength leave him that's when money couldn't count that's when his family couldn't count on his car and his house couldn't come he said oh God he said oh God you sent me you tell me to come back to my family I freed my brother but yes right now ready to say afraid not God help me Jesus and that confession tracked the angel to come to him because God told him to go back and meet his brother and God told us to a prophet to have a Revival God told us to a prophet that we could be a super Church a super praise God told us to get back to this scriptural land this word land and be getting back to it no devil is going to stop us is every place you put your foot is yours Oh Glory to God hallelujah Philistines in the land jebusize and hit us and amorites but there's still our land oh God we are sickness we are heartache we are problems we are children problems family problem but this is still our land and tonight we wrestle against flesh and blood we must see in Flesh and Blood we only see what God has said we have a promise to go back to Eden we have a promise God can have the preeminances we have a promise that your head stood because they come down and cap off this Pride we have a promise has so Tabernacle of a holy ghost Revival no devil in Trinidad Alta Trinidad go ahead and stop that Revival that's a seven Thunder Revival that's a Revival of the Justice Justified okay the Lord a shout yes Lord bless Lord yes Lord glory to God Hallelujah Hallelujah training for a contest it's just like a boxer his enemy is going to meet out there in a contest to fight a real good fighter usually knows and studies his opponent have you ever studied your opponent he studies his licks he knows where he fights whether he leans forward hangs back fights right-handed or left-handed he studies all this and if he's a good smart fighter he gets him a sparring partner that will fight just like the opponent and he will know all the licks when he get to that place so God has given some spying partner sometimes something inspired father might be a wife might be a husband might be your son might be a daughter they are not the enemy but they aspiring partner might be a brother in the church might be a sister in the church might be your aunt might be your uncle you don't know who God put as hisparent partner but that person is not the enemy we rational against flesh and blood that person is not the enemy God training here how to fight because a bigger enemy coming we have the world come through our churches we have the Press that's coming we are looking at demon activity but today we rational against flesh and blood finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the Palm is might a glory to God I see no weakness there I ask he not tiredness there I have seen no weariness here come on you young men God call you because you're strong finally my brethren be strong [Applause] [Music] [Applause] be strong [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you have to train to hit the enemy not discuss with notice how the Bible is in my name you shall ask Satan to leave that's not what the Bible say no flinging out boot him out cast him out elbow him out hitting my ass and try him out but cast him out no discussions but the devil no discussion with cancer tumor leukemia blindness death no discussion in my name they shall cast out Devils we'll give the Lord a shout this is God's Army on the move this is God Church on the Move we've got to get going let's start tonight let's start in this service let's start and disservice today [Applause] let's get a Revival rolling [Applause] all right we must remember that God uses his word to defeat his enemy if God could think or give his people anything better to defeat any of it he would have done it so as I've always said what God makes the first decision is the best he can't alter his decision now watch we have to study a strategy so the best thing God could have give us what's the word if everybody leave here with our word Consciousness but the word is God whatever problem you have there's an answer inside of there maybe you have Financial but it's there don't let the devil tell anyone it is right inside the idea because the Devil Himself went insideable it is written to Jesus and Jesus it is also written he can't know all the words he's not the word he can only quote part of it but he can't know all of it but pray that that you shall know I'm in the father you and me and I and you are that there praise God you're gonna have perfect realization you will be anointed appointed Vindicated and manifested you could be a true son a born son of Phil's son a seal son anointed son spoken word son Oh Glory to call the galatian son a Heir a Superman a god man oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah say that everything twice before tampering with you say don't think twice before interfering with you oh glory of God you are a man of God you are a woman of God you are a child of God you are a daughter of God you are a son of God oh glory to God Sons and Daughters is just like God they're just like their father [Applause] [Music] all right [Applause] my God you feel that fire in the building there's fire in the building have to come into you the fire here have to come inside of you Gloria remember season Lucifer a serpent was the most subtle of all beasts he had all the knowledge understand and craftiness brother Branham said he studied distracted each approach Eve strategy he understand the principles of the senses and he decided to tap into the reason senses he brought logic yeah she's only fantastic you know he said what did God say and she was glad to give her testimony I was in our service last night and God spoke to me he told me I could eat of every tree but the tree You're Gonna Miss in the garden he said I shall not eat for the day I eat there of that day I die and even a smile on fire with the testimony and Satan to the serpent said amen but one thing though you shall not surely die because God knoweth of the street you shall know more things more stuff is trying to hide from you are some Mysteries hidden and instead of Eve said shut up Satan God said so God can't lie I never hear it so and he punks your head with some more things to hear and after she yeah enough that's how she falls child of a mind trapped down in our spirit and he was gone Adam come and fall down too and here we are we getting back what is God using the channel of your mind to change your mind that you could be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you could get off this sluggishness the laziness the deadness and to let other people ride your horse and you're looking to jump on the carriage but you have the help of the horse too you have to help with the wheels turning this revival is that a pastoral Revival no man could bring the Revival the Revival of the come by the people you have to understand the path you have to play Every Praise every day man every Glory when you raise your hands you are part of it look at the Lord a shout when your prayer when you cry out when you fast when you seek God you are making yourself part of it well glory to God you've got to be part of it not just watch it but become part of it [Applause] becoming a part is a choice just as you have a choice to turn the hand and let Jesus in because he's knocking on the door and you only you can open that door being a part is your choice you could pull yourself aside you could just look at looking and looking and looking some people like like a look the question is when you're local do you see if they sit back and look you're looking at each other you think you think you think people when you Rapture selfish I can't see yourself in Rapture I'm looking for me and my family is that right you hear the testimony in your heart before he left he had this testimony that he he please who Jesus said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples when you have loved one for another you don't have love you ain't showing love you have one to show love and you expect to go away You're Going Back so I'll never understand so if you want to go in the Rapture you want to make things coming Lord you have to wonder this year you must want to love you must want to forgive you can't wait for somebody to forgive them two women two women two women on that you're soft you're so full of Honey anybody

let me hear what God's going and say he said repent ance all the time he duck in this repentant message but this time here holding back you know repent everybody repent horse dog cat everybody was repentant Oh Glory God forgive me never oh give the Lord some praises and if we come to that spot where the true spiritual repentance began to hit you hit this church from the pulpit to the back pens God we have sinned we have failed we have fallen short we need your mercy send on your power send on your glory once more Lord strip us hallelujah break us melt us mold something gonna break Something's Gonna take place let me see if I get out of here so Satan studied Eve he had the best strategy he could use upon her what a reason with the word now you never want to reason with God's word just believe it don't try to explain it don't try to figure it out you know many people say today there's no such thing as a devil they believe that the holy spirit is a good thought the Devil is a bad thought but if you notice when the Bible speaks of the Holy Spirit it says when he the Holy Spirit has come and he is not pronoun so he is a person and the Devil is a person and demons are persons and those persons are personalities different demons have different personalities there are demons they come in many ways whenever the spirit is speaking he speaks through the scriptures oh my that's how God you know God's speaking when you can find it back in the scriptures and people like Revelations who not in the scriptures God tell me and God tell me go tell them not any scriptures so you know what happened there go they tell them nothing it's a lying spirit that no scriptures complicated impact of it see oh my hallelujah praise God we're going to finish all right I'm thinking he went to India and he talked about I show you the Creator could speak and I could have said that and if the vision hadn't been dear by no means but if the one let him be God come and give him his sight the blind man was in India he said now I challenge any priest or Raja or holy man or any that may be come give him his sight and I'll follow your philosophy and you've made a converge he said that was the quietest bunch of people I ever heard man blind from worshiping his son he said challenge him come on come on openness and I said what is required about I see the reason you are because you can't you can't I hear him now neither can I but the god of Heaven who raised up his son Jesus Christ whose servant we are has just showed me a vision that the man is going to receive his sight and I said now if that be not so then you can order me out to India but if it is so every one of you owe your life to Jesus Christ I would like to ask you how many here would give their life to Christ if this blind man receive his sight you see your priest nobody come up here why don't they come they told you their religion is so big and great why don't somebody come and say something nobody come then you people out here if you see this blind man standing here the doctors examine his eye he's blind as he certainly is blind and if God give him his sight how many of you will serve Jesus Christ and just as far as I could see oceans of black hands as I said Lord Jesus let it be known that thou art God the man grabbed me around the neck and there said the male Bombay sitting there grab him around the neck and see as good as anybody he said what is it it's actually a power I know letter Dino mystery word and I see it so and how I see a show he says actually a power God is God and Satan is Satan oh if you don't believe in the devil he said when I first started I rod and headlong into him every day don't tell me there's no devil because I know better I have to fight with him every day I have to fight with him I have to fight with him I have to fight with him shout out every day we wrestle not against flesh and blood [Applause] every day and you must be trained Nations come up please and you must be trained when you meet him not training psychology not training education but trained by the Holy Spirit God's power in his word to make it manifest know your enemy what a cruel thing he is the same thing exists today they are devils and Jesus said you give the church Authority cast out devils in my name I hear his partner as a close he cast Seven Devils out of a pretty woman one day what kind of woman Pretty Woman sweet I am shooting an organizing pretty but Seven Devils inside of there if they married act they marry a woman with Seven Devils they're taking Seven Devils at home plus the woman oh God help me Jesus I hope I'm preaching I'm preaching this evening Seven Devils plus she she's a character woman she's the first you have seven dollars [Music] know your enemy I know your enemy is when you're telling the enemy oh there's segments like that and you like that and you went after that you see my difference inside of that come on come and bring for me let me come to my Devils inside earlier you need somebody with this image any discernment that's why I had to pray about every single thing you don't want to get to happy Devils you're married until death do us part you know till death do that and same level spot you know we'll give the Lord a shout in the house Oh Glory to God let's get them Devils cast out let's get the Revival inside of here oh glory to God in my name is Russell is not against flesh and blood Oh Glory let me finish here he's gonna watch they're bringing similar levels watch okay let me see he can't stand there All the Pretty Woman one day he said when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walks in dry places returning back bringing seven mother Devils with him so the man having a rent-free occupation in people's lives one devil and when he get boots he saw God no place to rent when you go here no not available that person have no heart whatsoever because you like what you know anytime you see us open there's a vacancy you know that's like the whole window open devil sit down inside the house oh God it's get clean when you boot him out he gets seven mother Devils worse than himself so it has different degrees you know principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness you know it have one who worse than the other one he gets seven margins seven High ranked spirits to come back in that house so he said we are moving wait is that restaurant the building they're building apartments they are the whole house the command because you're just laughing there's a thousand reason I don't know they're inviting others to come to join them but my Bible said in my name they shall cast out Devils become the castle Devils this evening well glory to God become for Saint Mark 16 this evening yes because of Revival is even well glory to God Hallelujah now watch yeah we almost there we're almost there now watch no that goes to show that if a man was clean of devils there was something that was in him that went out a devil had gone out and when the devil move out that gave God the opportunity to move in so when he goes out let the Holy Spirit come in don't just leave it there if you just repent of your sins and go on you're going to be worse off than ever but get that place where Satan once lived occupied and filled with the holy spirit of God and then you'll have the strength of God's word manifested cast out
