Heavenly Father we thank you for your presence and we thank you for guiding us together tonight that we can cry out and call upon your name we are such a needy people and we are going Upstream against the current against the tide against the current of entitlement against the current of laziness forness tness weariness and indifference we're going against all these currents Lord to press towards this Mark of the high calling speak to us by your word and may your truth be made known by Revelation in Jesus I ask it amen and amen God bless you and welcome tonight we so glad to have this privilege and opportunity that we could Fellowship around the word and get on in prayer it's part of the Christian experience is part of our connection with God is part of being able to look back and see what a week we had and to be grateful to God and thankful to God for keeping us and that we are still alive in the land of the living I have one scripture I like to read uh from Acts chapter 13 we want to read verse 46 to 52 Acts chapter 13 verse 46 to 52 praise the Lord and verse 46 read then Paul and bamas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye have put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life L return to the Gentiles for so hath the Lord commanded us sing I have set thee as a light of the Gentiles that thou should as be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed and the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region but the Jews stood up The Devout and honorable woman and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them out of their Coast but they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came to ionium and the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost amen let us pray one more time father we thank you for your word bless it interpret to our heart in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen Sunday service will be a special time Sunday we are actually celebrating 28 years since our church was dedicated and we're looking forward for a wonderful time in the Lord a special service we going have this coming Sunday we have two services at 10: and at 3 the communion service this book of Acts is a strange thing that I got tonight the title I have is low we turn to the Gentiles now I titled it that but we're going to flip it we want to see what happened here and see how God is about to flip it to turn to the Jews so in this acts 36:46 in the Amplified it says and Paul and Barnabas spoke out plainly and boldly saying it was necessary that God's message concerning salvation through Christ should be spoken to you first but since you trust it from you you pass this judgment on yourselves that you are not Unworthy of eternal life and out of your own mouth you will be judged Now Behold we return to the Gentiles the Heathen so we know the story the Jews who came on his own and rejected him by this rejection in Acts 13:46 Paul got the commission to turn to the Gentiles that is why we are here tonight because God's Own chosen people using that word rejected him and give us an opportunity note how it was placed to them that it was necessary that this they get this word first but seeing they don't want it they push it away from themselves now we turn to the Gentiles I want you to think this entire message has been here with us over 50 plus years it has gone around the world several times in books translated in every way possible to get this to this end time people I wanted to see how God would be angry and how the Judgment of God would be so harsh as this Gentile age closes because when Jesus was on Calvary the Jews cried out May his blood be upon us and our children for that statement for that rejection for that attitude they were scattered they were killed and so on we know 6 million Jews that died under Hitler and I man and Stalin and so on and to this day they under that pressure because of what happened 2,000 years ago what do you think this God of the Bible note god of the Bible who give us Gentiles the opportunity to be grafted in what would that God think about this Gentile Bunch rejecting and turning down this Holy Ghost Gospel and I want to encourage you tonight to cry out to call upon God because we are fighting we are fighting to live we are fighting to die we are fighting La slothfulness lishia we are fighting attacks on slaugh of the enemy we are fighting for our families you have to pray we have to fight so Lord return to the Gentiles Revelation 7 famar scripture after these things I saw four Angels standing at the four corner of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth and we know that's the wars they're holding back that they should not hurt the Earth the sea nor any tree so what is to come is to affect everything Earth see the trees that means nature verse two I saw another Angel ascending with from the East having the seed of the Living God and he carried a law voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the Sea hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees for till we have sealed the Servants of our God in your foreheads and I heard the number of them that were sealed and there were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel now under the fifth seal we know that the Jews were under there crying out how long they were saying how long Lord how long Lord right the Jews were crying out under the fifth seal and the prophet was revealing it here he was saying that I will not Brethren that be ignorant of the mystery least at any time you be wise in your own conceit the blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles come in so once the Gentile agid is made up or complete or is fulfilled God ready to go back to the Jews the last gentle bride be brought in for the bride the blindness come to Israel for that purpose so all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of Zan a deliverer that shall turn away the ungodliness of Israel now they are Israel that's under this altar watch Israel was blinded for the very purpose for us being being saved Who blinded them God God blinded his old children his own children no wonder Jesus standing there at the cross and them Jews hling for his blood his own kids he was the scripture he was himself the word and here he is knowing that those people would have gladly received him and that's the reason he blinded them so they wouldn't recognize him he come in such a humble way blinding them to it that they wouldn't receive it the scripture said they would do it he was blinded he blinded Jesus peed them even said father forgive them they don't know what they doing notice now I want you to watch this read close they were given robes they didn't have them they were given robes white robes each one of them now the Saints already have one but they were given robes the Saints already have deers but this this on the fifth seal they had not a chance because they were blinded and so by their own father here we go so the grace of God could be fulfilled to the bride so I want you to notice this is not your right we didn't earn it it's a gift it's a Grace and that's why we should be thankful every time see in other words it is predestinated to them it's the scriptures now they got robes 144,000 to be called out notice thy Breen had to be yet to be killed which means here we go the 144,000 yet to be called in the tribulation the 144,000 is called and they'll be killed which we had some time we might get it tomorrow night if the Lord willing that before he said they have to be matured these Jews they have to be marched by the Antichrist we just come through and notice his last ride where he breaks the Covenant with them Jews down there and she goes these Jews 144,000 is to be called out notice these souls are to wait a little season for the 144,000 to be mared so these Saints these Jews that are the elected of God they have they have been still paying a price and that is why the Judgment of the Gentiles will be so har and that is why we need to shake off this how could I say it this entitlement it just stuck on me you got to forgive me sometime I want to know if I go in off you know am I tripping or what but this entitlement where God have this certain obligation to us and I said no God came to the Jews and they got blinded that we get an opportunity don't mess up don't throw away opportunity you'll be judged let's continue along with you brother brand ENT evangelism we are going to end right here he said the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture according to Malachai 4 bring them back to the feet that was once delivered to the Saints and then he is drilling down into it now bring them back to the fate of the fathers the Pentecostal part in the restoration time I will restore see the Lord that's real end time evangelism what is evangelism what is the fate of the fathers the Pentecostal part in the restoration time this restoration didn't come through Luther or Wesley or Pentecost which is Pentecostal denomination William brandham the prophet of Malachi 4 he brought the restoration according to the scripture Elias shall first Truly Come and restore all things so this restoration only come by this end time word message but it has a Pentecostal part of it which is the spirit part which is the oil part and he is praying here in Junction of time our heavenly father we thank thee for those who have raised their hands a while ago seeing the desire to be born again they wanted to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and be sealed into the kingdom of God now right here in the neighborhood right around the places here where these people come from here are pastors your Shepherds Lord who are feeding their flock and they're standing there not ashamed standing boldly in the presence of God to let people know that they believe in this marvelous old gospel they believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost they believe in the second coming of Christ they believe that they are in the end time and they are trying their best Lord in their corners of the World to Win people to you oh Eternal God bless their min hisory abundantly I pray here we go that you will anoint them with preaching power with healing power and the virtues of God and this part I want to get to until their little churches will cry out great signs and wonders will take place and may there come an oldfashioned Revival out of Sturges here that will sweep the whole state Grant it Lord give give them an oldfashioned ooing of the Holy Ghost made start from this very gathering together and we know this quote we read it I believe Wednesday night or some time before in two signs Overlook when he said let the people talking about Elijah atomic bomb scared people scared and so on he said let the people let that little flock that little Remnant that God will give him let that little remnant go to calling out to God and Watch What Happens listen when the people begins to pray when you want to pray and begin to pray something will take place it will affect your life it will affect your family it will affect your business it will affect your walk your talk because you are tapping into the supernatural you are tapping into the Living God by having a communion and a fellowship with him let that Remnant go to calling upon God Watch What Happens there'll be a national Showdown there'll be a power that they have never seen before the trouble of it is this time is going to be too late for them the doors will be closed so remember we are the end time pray Prophet speaks we got programs around here revivals people asking if you accept Christ as your personal Sav yes I do two or three days after that the devil got them out of there again what they need today is an oldfashioned godsent s Paul Revival and the Holy Spirit would get men down at the altar like their mother and daddy used to do and cry out on the altar until God gives them the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's the truth my Christian friend here we go and about to finish you'll be kicked out some of these days from these in National like this it will come a time this is prophecy it will come a time time when you will have to belong to an organization or you can't worship as you know the scripture say it will be they just make fun of you now listen to these words they just make fun of you now but there will come a time where there will be a boycott for the mark of the beast must come you'll either belong to the confederation of churches the Beast like it is in Rome or you don't push up at all that's what the scripture says that is when you'll have to cry out like Isaiah did so so he is saying right now they're laughing at you making fun making mockery but things is about to change and will change now Saints let me say this here you sit here tonight you have your bills you have issues in your family in your home whether with wife husband children with with boss on the job whe they heading for retirement whe they not applying a job you have your own personal life and God is conscious of that you may have health issues health challenges God is aware and he's conscious of that as much as he cares about you about what you're going through cares about the challenges that you have and he wants to meet your needs the overall aring of things is that God has his plan and his program that is above everything else don't ever forget that with all your plans and ambition and all your aims and what you want to do in life and everything else and what you are seeing and so like that remember there is still a program of God when those three men came walking to Abraham they didn't come for a lime or just come to eat and and go back they came with a message they came to tell Abraham judgment is about to strike son I I come to tell you plus I come to let you know that your body is going to be changed that the time of life is coming so two things that play here life to Abraham and Sarah transformation by time of life judgment to Sodom and family is there so I want you not to stay at the caral level or the natural level of your mortgage and your bills and your payments which is part of life but you have to be able to take a peak now and again and more now and again to see what else that you have to observe in this program of God because in Prophecy Jesus said the bill this they they they given in marriage normal living until something just happen and break so when things begin to break and I believe things will break suddenly not gradually suddenly overnight you cannot be caught una a ways you cannot say you did not know you cannot say why is brother fing and presenting and preaching this way why is he doing that you cannot you cannot say you didn't hear let's just continue finish then you talking about when the boycut everything else that is when you'll have to cry out like Isaiah did and he got down in the temple he realized then he raised his hands he said oh Lord I'm a man of un lips you think you're good but wait till that time come I you see brother B is injecting it you think you're good but you wait till that time come I dwell among a people of unclips what did he he got desperate and when you get get desperate about this thing something will take place you are not desperate enough now we know that a birth I don't care is a a baby born in a shock pile hard floor pink decorated hospital is a mess and the new birth is nothing less than a mess but people are so starchy watch that word starchy you'll go over there where they shake hands so the people will prefer humans humans a a normal Church shaking hands saying amen hallelujah we are the Mysteries and we are the best teacher and the unfolding of the word and no noise no sort of crazy people and Hallelujah glory and none of that but here what he's saying here now we will go over where they shake hands we will go over where they don't ball and cry and beat on the Altar and cry out listen to The Prophet words now you want to be too human we need a are dying out to bring forth life if you love God everything that's it us should be in the love of Christ amen he said we set so full we said so unconcerned and I see this word here unconcerned many of us in that category we come in the church not you don't believe but what do you have a burden do you have a concern set UNC concerned when the world is dying under our feet we set so unconcern about it as long as we belong to the church that's all we think that makes a difference that's a sad part with people in this message he said right now we're in a time of investigating judgment remember what we said on Wednesday night he said the two Spirits are marking their people now for future judgment in other words God is investigating us to see who he will seal and who he will judge are skipping quickly we are living in terrific times you see these things that we are in now we studying right now the church is done going and these things are in the tribulation period And I think it ought to be truly settled in every believer heart that this church never takes the tribulation period you cannot put nowhere the church in the tribulation you can put you could put the church there but not the bride the bride is gone she's done she she's not one sin nothing against her the grace of God has covered her and the bleach has took sin so far away there's not even remembrance of it oh here we go it ought to make the bride get down on her knees and cry out to God oh Hallelujah could you just give God some Praises as I close is the final quote and we go straight into prayer there's some trial 27th of April 1964 prophecy what one of these days men and women will cry out it will be too far it will be too late the door would be closed and Jesus said it would be that way the virgins come and knocked on the door and said let us in they wanted to get some oil but they ought to have had got the oil when the oil was being given out the knock on the door they were cast into outer darkness and there was weeping and willing a national fee I'm only trying to make that little sideline of Defense to the cours Now by his way and this is it for tonight a lot of Brethren feel entitled The comforted of what they believe and what they know but they short on this oil there will come a time when churches pastors ministers in this message will realize they need something more than Mysteries information knowledge and 4our 5 Hour Services they need something more than that they really need the spirit when they begin to cry for that it just might be too late Saints tonight now begin to cry out you're individual in God this is not a church thing this is not a headstone Tabernacle thing this is a God promised thing Jesus died and the cross brought a channel to bring in the Gentiles he said L Paul said let's turn to the Gentiles God is about to turn to the Jews when God does that listen not one more Gentile will be sa the Gentile age will be completely over you can't say God um once more a whole on no this is the time he give us this is the space he give us the times of the Gentiles let's B it Heavenly Father such an odd exaltation tonight to bring a word and then flip it over to see how these Jews turn you down and they see the cost and the penalty and the years and the anguish what will happen and the prophecies already deal of what will happen to this Gentile dispensation father you said behold I send you Elijah the prophet before that great and terrible of the Lord father May the Believers be conscious may they be aware you're not trying to frighten them and scare them we just going to tell them the truth because the truth make them aware and be sensitive in making decisions and taking actions that will bring the correct results here we tonight God may you take out all shame and all embarrassment they in their own homes they have this opportunity to cry out unto you help me Lord Deliver Me Lord take away all me from me Father fill my soul with the fire of God send on the burners send on the seraps they have the opportunity to Crow like Isaiah did when he as a prophet say wo is me I'm undone of a man of unclean lips is something else when we come into God's presence it is something else where we feel stripped where we feel naked where we feel all alone oh Jesus come and comfort the people tonight Inspire them Lord in their closet Inspire them Lord in their homes may they raise up for a moment above their bills above their mortgage above their payments above the issues around them and may they turn to you tonight may they not look at their bank account or their house and their car whatever they have natural that keep them pinned down to the earth oh God you give that Parable Jesus about this the wheat being choked with cares of this life oh Jesus this opportunity given to us this Friday is to break out of the cares of this life all what has happened for this whole week May we just loose ourselves in you and lose our faith in you to trust you and to believe you that you will catch us up in your spirit and take us up into that anointing of your glory of your presence Grant it father as the people get on in prayer right now may you be with them may they be inspired Lord May their Spirit be stirred Lord may they be motivated and inspired to crowd into you you once more once more another book of Acts once more another day of Pentecost once more another Revival once more another acts to oh God send down your spirit and fill your people again in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you Saints as we get on in prayer may the God be with
