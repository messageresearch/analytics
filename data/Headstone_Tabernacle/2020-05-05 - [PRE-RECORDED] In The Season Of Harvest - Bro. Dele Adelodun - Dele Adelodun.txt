when the service is Ruby Hoover would have cause to give you praise will give you glory and we shall count our blessings and our coffers will be so full grandly towards master as we commit ourselves thy Ward and this time the atmosphere and the environment into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen god bless you charge it feels good to be in the house of the Lord tonight requests that will reach the scripture then they are after will take the comfort of our seats we'll get acquainted and go into the message so when we read the scripture together my accent my tour nation will be clear will be understood by those who are strange to me so let's just read our Bibles god bless you you're welcome tonight if you have your Bibles please stand with me to the book of John we're going to read from few places if you don't mind we'll start from the book of John chapter 12 John since John chapter 12 I would like to read from the 28 verse down to 24 John 12 22 24 then we shall also read from the book of Matthew chapter 27 to 28 somewhere there if you have the sa hey man and there were certain Greeks among them that came over to worship at the feast the same came therefore to Philip which was of Bethsaida of Galilee and desired him saying sir we will see Jesus Philip , tantalate Andrew and again hundra and Philip tell Jesus to come that his son of man should be as set a corn of wheat fall into the ground and if it die it bringeth forth much fruit the wake on of weed econ can ever multiply itself it's by dying I will come back to that god bless you Matthew chapter 27 this might be a very hot text now in Matthew 27 for the kind of the theme of our program but you bear with me as we see we are it matches Matthew 27 I like to take from the 60 second verse 62 now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days our eyes again I'm sure you know they are referring to command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first Pilate said unto them ye have a watch go away make it as sure as you can so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone and setting a watch I will continue to 28 the first six verses in the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn towards the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and such upon it he didn't just roll it away is such his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white us no and for fear of him the keepers who have meant to be on guard with the seal with all the cameras did shake and became as me to come to Trinidad to be of service trusting to God that song we along the line we can be of a blessing I very much appreciate the support of my dear friend and brother Isaac it did all he could to get me down here without frustration so maybe not bless you sir and in absentia I want to appreciate past Oulu Emoto for only support for me to be done here he hasn't come yet boy in this great product in love and kindness it was a boot Oh underway so I pretty low blessing very much and there I appreciate all the servants of the Lord pastors both those that will speak and those that were supports the speakers I appreciate every one of you for your grace for your humility for your support for your kindness and for your generosity to come and be part of these meetings I pray the Lord bless every one of you appreciate the entire church for coming like I've always said when a preacher comes to town it is not our intention to come and preach to chairs and benches the gospel is not meant for them the gospel is meant for human beings so it's always a blessing and an encouragement to a preacher when the Lord give us people to speak to so we will never take your kindness that gesture for granted so we'll trust to the Lord that somewhere somehow we'll be of a blessing to you so thank you for coming tonight thank you for coming in the morning I'm taking an advance for how the community we do throughout these meetings may God bless you I bring greetings from Nigeria all the saints the pastors and everyone and my own pastor and all the brethren knew of my comment told me to give you a very kind regards to all the Saints here and my wife and children also requested that I greet every one of you everyone is doing fine and I'm sure they will be glad to know that the believers are doing when he made a lot bless you [Applause] and I sincerely know that all of you appreciated the service this morning the yielding trees atishoo to us that lessons and not being protected that was something and when Pastor crimp read in the morning it said we are unprotected here protected and I find our protection to be that perfect law if we can be yielding and yielding and yielding it will be taking us from glory to glory but that was something to my heart this morning and I pretty low bless you sir bless the family the ministry and the flock of God Park and England amen god bless you all if I do not if I do not greet anyone I shall have greeted forgive me it is not out of rudeness it's just because this is so much I can do right now god bless you so if the Lord will be our help tonight which I trust a will I want to speak on the subjects that I caught in this season of the harvest like pastor Chambliss said this morning that the harvest time is a very broad subject and it can be approached from several many angles because there are a lot of things that go into the harvest what I'm trusting to God that you know the scripture says the body of Christ is compacted together by what every joint supply so if the two of us tonight are not able to give adequate supply don't worry there are still five more supplies coming and I'm sure they will be able to fill in you wouldn't miss anything you watch to receive through these meetings so be less than short of that may I start even this other subject by saying that all your efforts to come and everything that you put in to come is like seed sowing that's what the Prophet said brother Brahm wants to preach in a place in Canada very remote many years ago and there was telling the church before he went is a see those brethren they and their remote parts and they do not have much so for them to make it to the meetings because of the value they attach to those meetings some of them would love to sell their horses there are cut rules and so forth some of them will have to each Ike some of them will have to come by transportation with element of walking in order to get to the meetings and the prophet tour discharge is that you see that is how to get much out of it because what they do goes with one form of sacrifice or the other those that sow in tears most certainly reap in joy so it's that they are putting in so much because of the value they attach to that program and I said that is the reason they usually get so so much so I want to tell you for all the sacrifices you have made you will get so so much the harvest will begin with you your coffers shall be full by the time their missions are over you will count your blessings and it will surprise you what the Lord has done just open your hearts to receive the blessings of God if you have a spiritual niche the law will may teach you say why because you have son you've got to ring if you other the physical needs the law will meet it cavalry takes care both way brother Bram said if he can save your soul it can also heal your body it can meet your needs it can fight your battles so let loose in his presence and I'm sure there'll be a lot of others [Applause] you love him tonight I was thinking of the men that brother Bram called John cherish just bear with me this is how I feel like going and when the Prophet met this man it was such a poor man it wasn't only poor life was unfair to him it was married but he had no child so everything to the negative was the portion of this brother but brother bran made some a statement that was very remarkably by John Terry's is that when this man eats the world it believed everything [Music] and that power of the fridge in the world began to propel in John Charlie was no longer himself then you know it was living like in a two room house that he has used all his entire life savings and walking to acquire but then because of the value attached to the gospel a man of God came into the town to settle down and spread the gospel if an LED of the Lord this will sound unusual to many of us it will sound like a man out of his mind people take out of what they have but John chariot was gonna take out of nothing she was gonna be like that with a woman she dropped all our two minds that's all she had and jesus said she went for much more wattage than those who brought millions it's because the Armenians came out of their billions in support this one came out of nothing it is true - true it left her with zero but because of the value she attached you do open things etana Oh glory to God John chariots left his house and brother Bram said is got a very godly wife who made life easy for him they left the house completely not a saloon or say range they undead it completely as a gift to the men of God without a plan for where they we pass the night the man of God struggle to refuse it but John said the Lord told me to do this so John stood right there and he had to I Burnett squatted somewhere for the night and when a woman who never knew God she wasn't a Christian when she saw them and said I was going on here it's a it was happy to declare testimony the Lord told me to do this and I've done so what is left for you John it had nothing it said okay you know what I will give you my garage to stay if you will pay the wages of dressing my cutting so it's going to cultivate dress and make the garden okay but the payment he will receive for dressing the garden will be the garage is given to leave John gladly accepted it and the John will dress the garden and in the evening you know and after doing that they will go and look for something to do in the evening it will sit somewhere by the compound of the house and start reading his Bible then this woman begins to pay attention to John what was in that book that makes this man so loved and so interested every time without John Charlie's saying one word his life began to preach and the woman you know peeps to see what book he was reading and it turned out to be a Bible and the woman went to the shop to buy a severe Bible and started reading also I want to know what was John's interest what was attracting John in that book and she started reading Bible and by the time she started reading Bible the lot began to minister to her and that opened up a channel for this woman to hear from God and the same God who spoke to John spoke to her and and is that God give John $10,000 and this woman who has never been to church never hesitated she runs the attack and came to John is a God who told you to leave your house told me to give you two alone you $10,000 John said to watch is that I don't know you go ask him and John went and asked the Lord because he hasn't seen such a money before together and the Lord said to him okay you start a building business a property selling business go look for a property you sell in a urinal vated salad and like that and this brothers started that and the breath of God began to come upon it and the breath of God began to come upon it and the orphan started expanding started expanding and it has it has banded so much until when the Prophet was telling the story of this brother is a right now John cherished as 1,500 actors not a COS actors and is employing more than 15,000 Mexicans to work on that farm and hardly be paid four million dollars to the cause of the gospel and as a right now right now brother John has got so a lot of children until is beginning to has got to slow down is that as I'm talking to you now the reason John couldn't be in this mission is because the weather's just put too bad [Music] that was a woman who was Barrett and brother Brad middleman he said see what 15 years see what difference 15 years a in the life of that man he said because that man switched to the Lord and is ripping bunch of alarbus so whatever you are dream for the Lord don't slack don't be discouraged I'm declaring harvest because there shall be and harvest amen nobody plant one seat and leave just one seat a first time is always an interesting time plans to be sure harvest [Music] [Applause] you love him tonight okay [Applause] I just thought your sense that maybe it's going to help somebody maybe it's going to encourage somebody okay let's make that our background and look at the glitch husband man himself the Lord Jesus of the Gentiles maybe complexes of thinking about this pasta or dis man called Jesus but anyhow the things that we are saying was too attractive for them to ignore Jesus so they decided to take a trip anyhow whether they understood the program or not when I do understood what he preached or not whether they understood this instruction or not it doesn't matter they wanted a taste and the Bible says they devised a plan to approach Jesus and they went through some of the Apostles as an excuse me sir can you oppose booked an appointment and the man said - who - pastor Jesus who are you we are Greeks I would love to tell my fellow colleague and unroot elytis to another person and the two of them came and say pastor the Greeks are interested in seeing you amen now when you see the Prophet preached I will see Jesus is not preaching just seen him as a person they want to see the working of Jesus [Applause] that is a meaning of sass we will see Jesus and you know Jesus when asked that request is said now it's my time for purification you won't understand - it won't be glorified until he dies if the Gentiles are beginning to have an awakening that they need me they want to enjoy my walking they want to see my power they want to be a my effect then something has gotta take place now then Jesus give them a parable he said except a corn of wheat dies if we abide a law that one con will remain one come and if it says long that one can we be hedging and it should be depreciated but if that one con will produce ma is got to be ready to die so God believes in harvest amen it's as long as such this one con dies it will abide alone by itself the disciples may not understand what he has passed a message then gradually the one con began to talk about his death and like you add in the morning Pizza will say over my dead body will you die you got a lot of zeroes people in the church it's fine it will get better with them as they keep growing in the Lord Peter thought was doing crazy people but I didn't realize that by that it was trying to stop God's program anyhow the divine program couldn't be stopped it came to that particular day our Lord went down the reason it went down is to be able to multiply so God knew that if you plant one seed of kin you are going to get up he's a cop even not to cops I'm gonna cop you have many seeds of come a local challenge now I'm preaching this because this is the kind of advanced God preached this is the kind of others Jesus our Lord preached this is the kind of average brother Brahm preached FS is not the rapture I Fest is something that will take place before the rapture it might sound strange to you but that is the truth okay let's go on alright so when he died settin knowing that if this man get off there's gonna be a problem is it I don't know when Christ was alive his life was a problem when he died it was a problem when a rose brother it was also a problem but is there a problem to you it's just aside you belong now these people watching while alive now he has given up the ghost year that of the ghost they confirmed it's themselves they were the one who handed over the body to be buried and when it was buried they came back to Pilate excuse me Pilate excuses governor you see this deceiver then we are actually afraid because they know that everything I had ever spoken nothing has ever filled and while he was alive he told them I have the power to lay down my life nobody ever talked like that because nobody lived by himself nobody exists by himself the only one qualified to be hello him is the one who come in the body called Christ I am was before hey bruh he rejoiced to see my day before Abraham was I have the knew everything he had spoken had come to pass and you watch the politics watch something he said that deceiver when he was alive since that we were raised on the third day and we know that we seem to have an idea that it will not happen hmm but so we want you to let I am more amore and security and seal the place so that nobody will come and tell our story now these people are bad politicians and they are very wicked do you know when you tell the truth you will be consistent but because be these people we align they couldn't be consistent I will show you the align now one of the reasons they killed Jesus Christ was to say that he said if we destroy our temple and on the touch day it will Reza talk they pretended then as if they did not understand what jesus H so this their position is against their better judgment then knew that wasn't what Jesus Christ said Jesus wasn't talking of destroying physica temple he was talking of the temple of himself but when it was convenient they came to use it as an exhibit in order to get him crucified then why did they change the story of the crucifixion to say that this man said on the touch they realize oh he didn't say it twice is that it at the same place that the Miskin truth the only thing that can make you constant is if you tell the truth so it's just that these people we Elias these people we are deceivers they understood better what Jesus said but because of the needs to gather false accusation against him they said easily with destroy a temple now they are no more talking about the temple they are now talking about himself [Applause] [Music] yes brother we exposing the devil and the governor said I don't understand you people again when this man was alive it was your problem now is dead is your headache excuse me you have the Lord you have the enforcement agenda police and everything and the soldiers go on attend to eat as much as you wanted you know what was happening the devil was using those guys to disrupt the arrests the ones that planted seeds to die and rotten and never bring forth life but there is nothing that can stop God's program the law of God is does the soul in tears mas reap in joy nothing can stop it nothing absolutely can stop his resurrection it has done be spoken it must come to pass [Applause] so excuse me so what happened they went to the grave they put several Roman seals that is one other time let's leave that one but they put to those hills and the I admin machineries and soldiers yes looking guy with sophisticated weapons to do what to block the office because they know if Jesus ever rise up according to his principles of John chapter 12 there's going to be problem Satan was contending with just one man but is now after is not going to face many member body of the same one can you catch that that is God's harvests so they put everything in there but I like it when the scripture said on the tenth day the angel of the Lord came down where were these guys that didn't sleep that we are wide awake God kept them wide awake to see everything that happened in there being wide awake that we are shaken that we are shaken and this angel came he broke the seal and erode away the stone and is such upon ease tryna challenge try me if you can we tell your weapons we tell your palms we tell your tillery's try me if you can and the sergeants couldn't they couldn't do it then they can do it nothing will stop this office nothing will stop your body change nothing will stop your resurrection nothing will stop your abduction because it has been squirted it must come to pass having a natural pass away God's Word can never pass away there is not enough demons in hell that can stop it they can stop your display they can stop your demonstration we have a promise a quick short walk will take place in here we have a promise there will be another outpouring brother prams head in our spiritual race listen to me is that the vehicle of the bride ad outrun that of the Antichrist in the message looking away to Jesus is that what we are doing now is to slow down and waiting for them to catch up he said when they catch up watch the truck pull them what you see temporarily manifested will come in its fullness the trouble is in existence right now but it will not come in a great measure until that time something will provoke it the Antichrist will provoke it and we are waiting for them nothing will stop our demonstration let me remind your church this is not the edge of horse so no sacrificial animal here this is the edge of he go when the enemy comes like a float we have a promise the Spirit of the Lord will raise a standard when a stand that is risen it goes above the floor come on friends and wonderful time is ahead don't worry don't worry brother Brahm said this quiz will be here fellowship in like these will become fond memories he said is gonna put a pressure on us until we are almost pressed out is that what you've got nothing to be afraid of because at that hour oh there's gonna be a revival of the jaws there's gonna be another pouring it's a promise it will never fail only believe all things are possible this is the office we are talking about [Applause] so the hinges sat on it and it was watching what the soldiers will do instead of the soldiers are talking they were so scared until when does environment settle down they took to their heels they run for their dear lives and I watch where did they go - they went to other people their principals who engage their services and where they got their that determines was as a massage except without TC Vasa we saw him who did you see that's a man the man you call the deceiver we saw him he was out everybody ought to know who our Lord he's evil Satan we testified we saw in usage Jesus yessuh he came out so what did you do what can we do the glory was too much the power was too much the presence was too great for element of Fez - [Applause] yes I problem now there quickly someone that comes you it's all is it or getting a church members when they want to do bad things they don't they need only short notice you see them gather gossip as don't need long notices together but bite has don't need luck it's it's so easy these guys quickly gather what must we do now watch conspiracy that started from the church against their own conscience these guys are going to bypass their conscience dangerous fellows too old unto a lie and make their chemistry believe it is the truth bribery started from the church the purple sighs okay okay okay okay we have a don't don't say it again don't say it again don't say it again so what must be see where Kentucky we are going to organize a press conference and we're going to give you a prepared written script and you are going to read it out whether you feel it's correct or not just bypass your conscience and say what we tell you and if you can assert that the deal is two million dollars yes that now you are talking you are talking agonize the press conference they organize the press conference the Pro Sky News CNN BBC all kind of all that to give a wide international coverage and they told them you see friends we did our job but somewhere along the line they know their lies won't sell and they know that it was going to embarrass the Iraqi of the harming so they told them in advance you go ahead with the press conference if the governor is annoyed we will secure emotion this is the church talking this is not business this is not politicians this as they charge come on friends charge talking and they organized a conference and they told the ally this man did not resolve it was stolen and they have done it so well that they were no Ally a reporter to interview them to interrogate them so one reporter got up to say what were you doing when it was so how can you be sleep say we won't entertain questions because it's actually shameful for a soldier to be sleeping at such a critical time so they they had it all arranged and the Bible said the news that it was stolen started travelling further than the news that it resurrected and you say you would have expected Jesus to do something about that look at that you would have expected him to come out and organize a counter press conference some of us that is what we will do but that is not what Christ will do adoption material amen take something from here he does allow the news to be going he knew that nobody can blight his name and it didn't even make it easy at least appear to some few public people let them testify even if they will call it apparition if they will call it illusion let them call it what appear to somebody the Bible says Jesus never did that he appeared only to those who shared connection I guess those news were going around do you know what he chose to do silently it began to empower an army because now what the devil was pushing him to do will have broken the scripture the seed of corn has died it is rotting and it has come back alive it's coming back alive is to reproduce himself in plentiful so it is not longer it is no longer the Ministry of Christ to defend himself it did all that the proof is point before it died after is dead and resurrection it is left for his body to stop giving the proof that is not dead [Music] this was why Jesus refused him is not that empowering is before it started empowering them they disciples I see what they are saying is that don't worry we shall apply them we shall apply them you get this you catch this you catch this and it was fortifying them when they finish the fortification is that the ceiling of your fortification is the apparel you can stay there when that power comes you will be my witnesses those lights they are talking it will never take you one week to change the story I am giving you what it takes to change the story so don't mind what they are saying the devil cannot make me obey him he wants to push me to take over your own ministry Christ is not going to take away yours he has done is it is not for you to take it over from there this was why he refused to reply he refused to all the press conference there on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost fare the Holy Ghost fell with the falling of the Holy Ghost came the understanding of the way because by - Pizza understood what Matthew 28 was he knew it wasn't in titles it has got to be in a name so the first salmon was a salmon with revelation in the name of Jesus Christ and they keep in ansan they charge and the people began to look at them very differently then one day Peter James and John the sons are walking they want to go to the temple and one man who has always been there everybody knew him the critics know him the believers know him the unbelievers know him so if something happened to him it cannot be said it's a lie because everybody knew him and this man began to look at this tree James remain as if to get something from them he wanted a little TT dollars to service problem temporarily but inside this earthen vessel was a deposit of permanent solution was a deposit of eternal life my goodness inside this earthen vessels is a deposit of eternal life to give life to give healing to give deliverance to even give salvation [Music] so Peter said look on Hoss TT dollars u.s. dollars British pounds we don't have as old as you people are well-dressed gentlemen you don't have sometimes it's like that we don't have [Applause] but such as we have this is the obvious now this is the harvest now such as we have will give unto you they did not even breathe they only spoke this what as Christ's such as we have will give unto you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and the Bible signs the man the man the man is status now what began to work upon him and it began to get estranged and in such a got enough and it begins to walk and to live and to praise the Lord what in lipping pressing the Lord walking limping pressing [Applause] they're such is a stitch that's what the album's in anyone has did such no one that enhance York when the people shot these people as a little forget it this guys are christ-like in haha watch this if planting of Christ as we produce many Christ this is the harvest [Applause] oh and guess what up on top the news of this Reviva went everywhere they haven't seen anything like blood and be some guys who were critics it gots to them so with the way this team is going but we suppress we put so much millions for the press to suppress this news and yet this news is traveling Jesus is wiser it doesn't only talk a Hawks the gospel is not just in watch there must be a demonstration oh it doesn't only talk he hacks then they called the disciples what they were afraid to hear that we hear it now watch in Acts chapter 3 said by what power and what name did you do it Peter is an opportunity I wanted I wanted my lord to organize a press conference long time ago he didn't do it now you people have organized a press conference and I will take advantage okay all of you listen now listen now you see the same Jesus whom you crucified hallelujah you crucified Him but God rest him it aside we saw him with touch him we felt him we impressive and we know that in resurrected nothing Jesus fetch in his name heal this man who can challenge such a press conference so Jesus was defending his integrity in his many member bodies that is the Amish [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that is why brother Brown says the first office was Pentecost is a quotation etc is that the first of s was Pentecost if there was an harvest of Pentecost that means there was a situation to bring about our harvest then is there after Pentecost when she cost itself by the Apostles became another seed swing [Music] because it starts at the beginning of many members body whereas it was always one person it has now become the body of that one person with many members are you catching the Church of the Living then it became the new deposits for another office brother Brahm said this new deposit which is not the deposit this soil of the bridegroom now but of his bride was buried at listen cancel so the truth was held until the edges of the charge went into the dark era that's what is saying and it looks like that is the end to each but bring the principle of John chapter 12 again for any sea to multiply itself which the multiplication is the average there must be a plant in fresh God wasn't satisfied with the number he gathered in Pentecost he wanted more but soffits that we don't want less men we one warm that's inspiration from God so you know what it is what was buried all of a sudden in luta started giving a shoot so this one is not actually dead and gone it was all God's program those thoughts are not a mighty Reviva [Applause] now lucha didn't carry the entire picture of the siege don't take it off when the seed is buried to the ground if you are digging it off you are gonna kill it completely just leave it if you have a moment it looks like nothing is happening or will ever happen when you just leave it as long as it is an original seat The Sun will be just right for you then what I will be just right for it God is never a loser is the best farmer I ever knew you know again in that dark in that period again the devil went on a rampage and he started accusing God the silence God gods did not respond as usual God allow him to be making his noise then a looter he gave a shoot which is a sign that in life that was buried under a started his journey of physical manifestation now that life which was a stock moved from the stock into tassel amen brother Bramson lucha was like a former in then Wesley became its lottery then from that tassel it moved into the shock Tasha was Wesley now all these stages stages of the potential siege but it is not the seat yet the profits that if I need an oak tree and you give me a seat of oak potentially I have my hope tree now the husband man must be patient to plant a seed and to do the work of conservation and induces it will get the Hope tree it is only impatience to with process life all right so it moves gradually the life left the stalk it came into the tussle and from the tussle it moved into the shop now the short it's always looking like the real thing but it is not the real thing hey what the shot is necessary to certain times I'm sure you enjoy the blessings of the morning and that is why in this age called loud this year the first move of God in loud dision age was a Pentecostal move we are bringing it up to us now this age started as a Pentecostal age that was the period of the shock Laden CEA's got two phases for the believer underline the word for the believer for non-believer is just got one face but for the seed of God in this hour there are two phases the Pentecostal experience is very important it is your shock experience to prepare you for the real thing that's what the prophets taught by a brother Graham says for you to get their wish you must pull the shop away or the grain must abandon the shock [Music] that was what we have been told in the morning and it was simplified to even our personal lives you catchin it why you must agree with the shock because the shocks protection will not facilitate ripening it's a good protection to keep this grain till certain stage but in the hour of a vest for the entropy harvest some Tomas happens to the shop are you catchin it and this is why if you look at certain stories of redemption you will realize that the journey of redemption always starts with two categories let's go to the Bible do you know the roof was brought into the economy of redemption in Israel in the season of badly arrests aha the Prophet said we're bring my understanding from the scripture is to do types and shadows we are not geologists so we can do tessaro's and all kind of this but we'll bring the pattern from the scriptures are you following now roots book of you and her it's a perfect time because Ruth was a Gentile who was brought to enjoy the blessings who was brought by kinsman-redeemer she into the economy and the blessings that used to be the preserve of Israel and it was important for roots to come [Music] the design for roots to be in the picture was necessary to give you a perfect shadow otherwise you will not be able to relate with your Redemption now [Applause] roots coming into the economy of Israel wasn't an accident brother Brant preached why it had to be Bethlehem and it told us in that message that before the foundation of the world God has designed and arranges program and part of that program is to include the Gentiles in the salvation plan as a matter of facts the true women the buttes to the sensory of Jesus we are gentle women you talk about rare and you talk about Ruth come on friends I feel so good I'm a 10 time and look out beautiful disease God took people who look worthless Moab was almost an abomination to Israelites you know their background they came out of instance she was living oh my and whatever rare that woman who was so much in prostitution until a lot became a sunny gray up the a lot do you ever notice annamaria a lot was a surname but messy rewrote their lives it is not in the wheelage not in their own age oh man it is God as you add message the race is not for the Swift's not a batch of artists wrong [Music] hallelujah Ruth can aim in the season of others and when she started that journey to come she didn't stutter alone she didn't start alone she started with another lady who looks like ah they were both called daughters-in-law one was upper one was Ruth and the boats decided hallelujah I'm pretty pastor the boat's decided to come with Nami in the season of Ava's hey hey I'm gonna touch someone's now for you to know that whatever is happening along the message today shouldn't discourage you oh these are things that are to be if the picture will be perfect you have some people who are previous message for 40 years and today they are talking the same message they never attacked it in 1965 they never attacked it in 1962 what they are talking it now because it is the season of the office [Applause] and the picture must become perfect I've got no apologies for such nonsense whether I believe this I know Dutch design I don't care [Applause] somebody once told me United States you say you could be shot for that as a just one bullet if God allows you but you cannot suppress me from saying the truth I am a witness of the resurrection and the power of the Lord Jesus Christ I must add press conference all the time [Music] it is a season of a novice and up as Monsieur hawk it wasn't easy to get up out of the journey she travelled very far Alleluia until now me preached a message of up lessness because it is all about what they can get out of it if they can no longer catch anything then nothing is longer the truth they told women not to wear trousers but the moment they denied a message there was not that we are in pants what has been their value for 40 years nonsense [Applause] Nermin looks are there two of them is the excuse me ladies maybe you don't understand what is happening I'm saying that I'm an old woman I'm saying that there is no more child in my womb let's even say God allow me to am a child and they it becomes a son or two boys or twins now you people are maybe I don't know that you're twenty late twenties and before this boy can marry you you will have become fifty and you will become will you wait for them till that along opposite that make sense [Applause] is a that made sense that made sense so many nonsenses are making sense toward you opposite of this our today he wasn't there when when Wendy Wendy Wendy Ringo of cloud appeared that makes sense he wasn't there it's not a news who was the first person who told you it wasn't there it was brother Brown because you don't read your message correctly curly the message three kinds of believers it's a decision upon it at two days before I got there or two days after I went there it was brother Graham who said we didn't plant it in the tapes from day one that was his first public commentary so it is not news for you to come and tell us that we have discovered his life he never lied but what you cannot deny is the fact that that happened because witnesses a bunch today only prophet told to take cover while the angels came down if you think it was after it got there brother Bram said it was the angels departing after their message if you say it was before it was after it was before he got there it was the angels lowering down to give the message he already said that so you are not telling us something new but for the Hoppus of this hour it makes sense it will look so real to you but you know us certain things are written in order to take care of Appa in the message of villain of God brother Bram say we have to say things deliberately sometimes and he said it is intentionally safe it will cause some to ponder it will cause some to sit down and say lord have mercy upon me it will cause him to stumble out and they will stain the compound wondering whether to come back or to square wave and if you make some to go completely away but the Prophet said that is done intentionally because every seed line must be taken care of come on friends the dynamics of the true church and the false charge is in the end of one man [Applause] brother Ram said The Messenger of God will speak for God to puts the true church and the first church but it is actually a messenger to the true church but since God does not have too much he's gonna use only one mouthpiece that one mouthpiece we bring the light for the hour and every plantation vegetation whether good or bad they need sunlight sunlight is not going to change your seat what is going to transform that seat through different stages to come to its maturity and achieve its purpose so Judas Iscariot being part of Christ disciple was not accidental Jesus chose him listen to me he chose him and from day one I knew who he was several times II told him who he was somebody will deceive me and somebody will deny me somebody will betray me this was a mighty one a very one when it comes to Judas it douse it in another day he said the man who is dependent with me now but do you know what he couldn't do that betrayal until Islam was right then they waited for his dynamics who gave him his inspiration the Lord Jesus Christ Himself Jesus look at him one day and said that which thou do it too quickly it was a first charge but it was inspired by Jesus come on friends to do his own work there are not too light in this hour whether they accept or deny the message of the hour is God's light for today and whatever city you have where the tears or which you must interact with the message this is what there is no problem in the message brother Brahm said many will come within the range of the message the range is defense of the message is about only few people with a special hearing ability which is otherwise called revelation will come inside you love him tonight amen so up mama's always be here and Ruth will be here they were priests they were preached the same message nama didn't isolate Ruth to preach one message and isolated Appa just as God never isolated Cain and Abel all the seed line started from Genesis brother Graham said the planter was from Genesis and throughout the ages we have seen the seed line that we come to final events in this last hour Jesus God told Cain and Abel offer me something token it was fruits he never brought something bad it brought the best what a like the revelation of the blood to Apple it was the blood that is why we think I know it was there I know it was it's annoying what's a message different reactions you already hacked by your seats type send message to hapa and Toulouse it makes sense I gotta go back now and now mister what's going on Ruth your colleague at gamba what are you doing excuse me mama from today don't talk about it we make it what a revelation in treatment not stroke forsake you because you are wasting your time doesn't that look like John chapter six and search you eat my flesh and you drink my blood tsunami was preaching the tour pool there and said you eat my flesh and you drink my blood no life it makes sense we cannot be cannibals pasta the last time you visited my house what did I give you you give me a stick and the steak I wanted to define a property what part of sick it was there lying does it have finger lies no no no it was the Lord thank you very much I taught you exactly with the fingers of a human being you have just called those cannibals now and also eat your flesh and to drink your blood when we are not vampires and they are left there took offence unto Christ you guys are cerumen I see you want you also good reason why are you talking like this dopes are we good 90s that you are the one who has the words of eternal life whether we understand or not Peter and the rest of this comes to Revelation Jesus can never be wrong and this is a revelation that is keeping you on high it is not how much we understand it is how much we can believe be it unto me [Applause] and friends in the season of the others Ruth came into the economy of Israel she came to spies she came without a right welcome but she stood there something told her that's a blessing ahead just give angular just keep standing just keep believing friends there are blessings ahead keep believing keep Odin arm you had a quote read for you in the morning they are betrayers they are with temptations there are be persecutions there'll be challenges but for the believer to them who are called according to his purpose all things work together for good there is one pound of the devil's activity that can send them to hell they are bound to arrive [Applause] she endures the contradiction and she started walking the professor Naaman never needed to tell her go get something she knows she must water this message she must support this message she must take care of this message she must never allow any evil flies to fetch on each she must keep this endtime consecration which are purity and she was doing our best then one day the Lord of the harvest Bors was passing by and I said who is this young lady who is this young lady The ministers are you here you go to introduces young ladies to the Lord ha ha ha the young man said that is the levy we've been telling you about the one that came with your kinsmen now me for pious that was so good that was so hard-working that was so faithful that was so loving that was so caring taking care of my relative oh my is a blessed out my daughter and I say blessings be on to you tonight it's a bless now my daughter Ruth was so shocked how did you take notice of me is that it has been reported to me Ruth is going for adoption it's been reported to me Alleluia the Holy Ghost has been given reports of our you are fearing of your hand words of your labor of your activities of your faithfulness in the season of others it was reported oh this is why you take knowledge of me let me tell you he's taking knowledge of you two now do not be weary in well-doing keep holding on keep serving him keep trusting him keeping faithful is taking notes oh you know what watch out this he said okay you know what I'm gonna do for you you took the right decision to come with my relative and us serving behind your decision you got to get some rest then it told the young man said listen to me none of you must touch this girl the husbandman deaf grateful my never said with in the recess of his art he was interested even but anyhow started becoming protective it started telling our boundary lines don't go beyond dear I don't want anybody messing around you you just keep here an asana watch it is that whatever she does PR wages but every once in a while beyond a level beyond the effort giver and Fulham Pappas give up on Asus brother Bramson so the roots can know that our Christ is still in a mission and we are enjoying the and fulness brother Prancer the top bull is in existence but it will not come in greater measure amen because it's been thoroughly identified when God started it it in pocket or in left it here that is why once in awhile we break through the channels and we say things your friends need rain have syndrome given even right now with our prayer there unfold on purposes I've seen without hands hands that are meant for oppression I've sinned rose and stretching out we just wedge there and Fulham by the word of the Lord absent women receive their babies without one prayer a handful of Papas [Applause] [Music] brother brems have what we have watch in this mum there's a presence of each did we only come to fullness in the destiny ahead don't touch the wine don't touch the spirit don't take it away from God's people the chapel is here and full of bubbles give us she's coming to fullness or it's God's program you don't bother yourself and Ruth was enjoying it and she will pockets and go home and go and give now me not merely say which side did you work today I just wanna go and just one day can you can we try this and full on this is why sometimes go just look at you it was send some blessings and you are wondering why how did you come about this and full of Papa's sometimes you do things beyond your monthly salary and yet you didn't still and you are wondering how it came about and full on papa [Applause] sometimes you end the house of the laws you went into the cloud of God's glory when you came back you don't know how you I even feeling you've just seen many things disappeared in your life and food on purpose because you are the roof of this hour Oh glory to God [Applause] and now missing in the season of the service is that is a Ruth I want to give you permanent rest I want to unite you with your head I want the picture to be perfect hallelujah so you don't just look like him you become in the think it's not possible it is the rising of the Sun is that this bride will be what of his watch power of his power life of his life in fact she will be in so whatever scripture I apply to him applies to her come on friends that's redemption story does the harvest of this hour and is that the husband man tonight is gonna celebrate a service roof will you do just one more thing for me if my look shameful but you got to do this because if you miss this decision of others hey don't miss it French it's the season of others Redemption must be completely you've got to be totally married they've gotta be united with your hands hallelujah to bring a glory that will even bring resurrection of those who had gone that's what the word says ma this is the route sir whatever you say I will do so you know what you're gonna do for me go Mac really tonight you just Mac really and don't go too easy just a defeat that man is a righteous noble man when this is that in knows what to do and when Rose did that boy say instead of calling Ruth a prostitute or somebody's making an unusual advance it said that even more virtuous now ha video bible in that you did not take a decision to go with all this young man Alleluia no young man died for you didn't catch that man no young man can redeem you know pastor died for you not Minister died for you that was brother promise type of the young man don't carry the image of the holy man come to the Savior make no delay it is your fence man redeemer you have to be united with price desire and follow the young man you don't carry the image of the holy man you are subject to the truth you wanted the whole wash all mine is I would do the right thing I will do what I need to do he went to a kiss man who seemed to be nearer the kiss man said I cannot do it is that no problem because for him to do it is gotta take it now me is that I don't want that is that okay we don't wonder how we do it and they called for the elders and right before they held us he said this day everything now me had i redeemed hallelujah and for my bonus I got you ruthless my bride and all the women catalog and semi couple as the woman they were pleasantly prize you were receiving blessings to be fruitful to multiply to be prosperous inside may God bless that woman that is coming to your house may God make her like Leah may God make her like a chair met two women that beauteous of Israel dude outwardly in Bethlehem and they said hey man and was too crude for why ellebra became the facility Oh glory to God up a story of redemption oh yes oh yes I'm a child of a thing hallelujah [Applause] [Music] and when she became United with a head she brought for Christ for that how hey cheerilee produced him again and they come together and from there they give birth to a child cause obey and from a bad care Jesse and from Jessica and David and from David Camm the Lord Jesus Christ roots generation are you here in the season of the Havas now let me close with this Robitaille the 12 spies in the first Exodus a man realized when the deadheads arose when the TEDx arose the first Exodus the second Exodus and this is the third one I must not fail to say this so bear with me all right in the first Exodus God was taken in nation out of a nation the second was taken a charge out of religion and this last one is taken the bride out of the church is taking the bride out of the shock because they with cannot mature in the Pentecostal age of love this year okay this then these 12 spies I'm gonna close on this and I would trust the Lord to walk in the spirit through the rest of the men of God these twelve spies they were sent out for spying in a vest season this other season is something you were really inspired me for roach it was bunny events this one it was the address of grips yeah and as you can watch again the two lines we obvious by the time they were coming back ten we on one side which it will report so much you will report along the message to them but that's fine the shadow says it the reality was showing but no matter how bad it is there will be the two again who we say we are modern able not just that we can make it we are mortal they will never be negative they will remain positive the Giants don't matter Caleb such they're bred for us I wish I eat them [Applause] the challenges don't matter they are bred for us and we shall hit them this quiz will not matter it is bred for us because we know that ten elders are warming up in the Pentecostal age of the church to unleash terror to this bright economy but we are waiting for them they are bred for us and we shall each them for watch this watch this when they came back the gospel of we cannot make aids made more sense to majority much more than the minority think about that for a minute men die but the spirits that propel them don't stop this spirits issue with us today that is why you are seen so many fallen away after all Jesus and Daddy of the Lord shall not come true Peter on TV as they fall in a wave it runs through the time people will become something else even our Lord said except the Debbie shortened no flesh shall be saved but yes we have winding it down when they we are preaching the gospel the whole that people felt the new better said preach for the younger people I want to be a young fellow right now this is not our kind of gospel then when Joshua and Caleb took over as a man a brother you have only had one side please listen to the other side but you know how much and influence that gospel of we cannot make heart in the life of this people but Isaac it was so impacting it makes so much sense until these folks we are willing to travel back two years into Egypt and they started looking for instead of going two weeks forward into opinon you go look at the map brother Brown said it's five days from Kadesh into Canaan less football so - let's make it proposed to its maximum people we are willing to god two years backward instead of two weeks forward in the season of the harvest because the best range goes well think about you of life tonight said let us make captain who's gonna be our captain they started shopping for captain there's no misfortune verse 4 let us make up you see a lot of people have evil in their heart they are only looking for out for a model said let us make captain Bowie take us back to Egypt and just run collapse and Lord this can be you have only heard one side have you forgotten the power of God in Egypt have you forgotten the power of God in the Red Sea have you forgotten how we are hungry and he gave us a manner we are thirsty gave us water we have a lost one bathroom for my soul bless the Lord and forget not his benefit have you forgotten all those things never mix with faith India when just run killebrew's off to save the situation they were so influenced by the gospel of we cannot make it until they pick up stones and we're ready to kill Joshua killer and the glory of God is sending friends at that moment it was too late one of these days is gonna be too late brother Bram said the Spirit of the Lord will be withdrawn he that is only will be holy still he that his fealty will be filled this year he told us of a time that church will be here for a while even it's not to do what to be a testimony he said if bread Falls is a middle receive a testimony minister of testimony like love art like this one heart if so be there in each themselves at that time preacher won't save nobody the silent act was the final phase of the judgment of the people God shuts the AK but Ren did not fall immediately for the next 10 to 40 days the ik was there bridging two souls that are eternally lost souls who are imprisoned think on your way when the glory of God descended God said everybody started trying to behavior said it's too late as you have spoken in my ears so will I do to you all of you from above 20 you said you cannot make it you will never make it because I'm the I priest of your confession the I press will not bring your sacrifice you will bring their sacrifice my brother it is whatever you bring that it will offer on your behalf so what do you bring tonight if you bring I can make it you we offer for you you can make it if you say I can I will I do believe that is what is going to declare your behalf is about how all those twenty below who says they will make it then we enter the land that you are despised and for God to achieve that that's journey from that moment became a wandering and brother Brahm told the people sorry God told Israel is that you people will know the breach of my promise the breach of his promise is not the breaking of his promise listen God cannot break his promise but the bridge means D taken away of the promise out of the reach of the unbelievers so that only the believer can enjoy so God created a bridge of time additional 38 years forward for all the people who said they cannot make it to die read your Bible the Bible and the journey never resumed until all of them we have wiped out so much so that only those who say they can enter into the land of promise for 38 years that we starts their journey from Trinidad going to Tobago after three hours that we find himself in Chicanos or Felicity they are catching nowhere until all those people died it was a breech of time this is the reason brother Brahm preached the message when it was taught in the seven seals the first Senate priests got eaten and revealed in then they followed it with the bridge between the seven Church edges and the opening of the seven seals in other words will run to the edges of the shock the climax of the seven church age of loved Asia was Pentecostal amen but Pentecostal refused to continue when the full word of God was brought into manifestation then we are like open like the ten elders they rejected and the moment when the consolidation rejected the food world it lost every article to provide Redemption this was why God cannot retain his seat in there it came to the gate of loud this year is that the old I stand at the door what he shall have been the landlord inside why was he standing outside because when it was fully presented it was pushed out the H before allowed this year Wesley an age was the age of open door and just one my age it became a closed door not to see not to unrighteousness but to the Lord Jesus Christ the closet door to life I'm loud SEF died this is why 95 brother brahmanas love this yeah dead in 1963 impact allowed this year in that instance before it declared them passed the redemption recognizing your beyond its message in 1965 it pronounced them dead forth for since 65 till now you have been seeing that form of law this year and that is why it's not getting better with the pentacle such things are roughly and what a loss to dedicate of that simply snow you are there to call you out where did you call you into we are still in the age of love this year but we are not governed by the condition of love this year this is our harvest but the branch said the which cannot match were inside the shock it's got to come out and this is why we came out into an economy within lousy C&H which the professions have caught for us the bright age and the pride edge give us a better thinking he gave us better songs he gave us better past practice to the word of the Lord and India we are laying under the eson of God and we are wrapping gradually in fact by spiritual food in due season that
