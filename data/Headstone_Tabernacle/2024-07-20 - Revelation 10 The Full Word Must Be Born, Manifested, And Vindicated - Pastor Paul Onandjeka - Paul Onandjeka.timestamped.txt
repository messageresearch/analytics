[44:01] speaker tonight brother Paul jaica from
[44:05] put
[44:09] Le have a scripture I like to read
[44:11] before he comes is Hebrews 1 5-7 it says
[44:15] For unto which of the Angels said he at
[44:17] any time Thou Art my son this day have I
[44:20] begotten thee and again I will be to him
[44:23] a father he shall be to me a son and
[44:27] again when he bringeth in the first
[44:30] begotten into the world he sayeth and
[44:32] let all the Angels worship Him and of
[44:35] the angels He seeth listen who maketh
[44:39] his Angel spirits and his ministers a
[44:43] flame of fire amen but the
[44:47] BR we know that Paul had the Holy Spirit
[44:49] do you believe that but he was 14 days
[44:52] and nights upon the sea without any moon
[44:54] or Stars it was all dark and he went
[44:57] down into the galley to pray he came
[44:59] back and told the men be of good courage
[45:01] for the angel of God whose servant I am
[45:05] came to me last night and said f Paul is
[45:08] that right not the Holy Spirit the angel
[45:11] of God an angel of God sent from God and
[45:17] then John the Revelator the whole book
[45:19] of Revelation when it was wrote he said
[45:21] I have sent my angel Jesus did and John
[45:24] fell down to worship the angel but the
[45:26] angel said said stand up worship God you
[45:29] see a true angel of God won't stand to
[45:30] be worshiped but he said that he was of
[45:33] the prophets and was his fellow men that
[45:35] have been sent to signify these things
[45:38] therefore here we
[45:40] go Angelic

[45:46] to come to the Earth to Bear record of
[45:50] God and they work through mortal beings

[52:03] and I saw the mighty Angel come down

[52:23] book open and he set his right foot upon
[52:25] the sea and his left foot on the
[52:32] earth and cried with a loud voice as
[52:35] when a lion Roth and when he had cried
[52:38] seven tunders utter their
[52:46] voices and when the seven Thunders had
[52:49] uted the voices I was about to write and

[55:37] Jehovah he said now the reason I've

[55:49] beginning religion upon the Earth
[55:52] today is not a cult today on the Earth
[55:56] there is nothing on the Earth
[55:59] today it is the SE

[56:08] in
[56:09] Genesis that you saw that we saw son of
[56:14] Son of God and daugh of God it is in the
[56:16] Book of
[56:17] Genesis that God say let us make m in
[56:21] our image let us make man in our image
[56:26] and it is in
[56:27] Genesis that you can
[56:30] find that you can find the serpent but
[56:33] in Genesis also you will find Son of
[56:38] God of God let us make in our image let
[56:43] us make man in our
[56:46] image blessed be the name of the
[56:49] Lord as brother John
[56:52] said book went back to his honor
[56:57] and the book came
[56:59] down and the book came
[57:02] down and this is and this book gave us
[57:06] Authority this book gave us
[57:09] power this book gave us
