[21:18] He's on the move tonight. We are so
[21:21] happy to be in his presence in the
[21:23] mighty move of God. But God bless you
[21:25] this evening. And one more time, if you
[21:27] have your Bibles, we'd like to turn to a
[21:30] portion of scripture in the Psalms as we
[21:33] worship the Lord this afternoon.
[21:36] Psalm chapter 111.
[21:40] Welcome one and all once more
[21:43] to the presence of God.
[21:46] Psalm chapter 111,
[21:50] which says, "Praise ye the Lord. I will
[21:53] praise the Lord with my whole heart and
[21:57] in the assembly of the upright and in
[22:00] the congregation.
[22:01] The works of the Lord are great, sought
[22:04] out of all them that have pleasure
[22:07] therein. His work is honorable and
[22:10] glorious, and his righteousness endureth
[22:13] forever. He hath made his wonderful
[22:16] works to be remembered. The Lord is
[22:19] gracious and full of compassion. He had
[22:23] given meat unto them that fear him. He
[22:26] will ever be mindful of his covenant. He
[22:29] hath shown his people the power of his
[22:31] works, that he may give them the
[22:33] heritage of the heathen. The works of
[22:36] his hands are verity and judgment, and
[22:39] all his commandments are sure. They
[22:42] stand fast forever and ever and are done
[22:46] in truth and uprightness. He sent
[22:48] redemption unto his people. He had
[22:51] commanded his covenant forever. Holy and
[22:55] reverent is his name. The fear of the
[22:58] Lord is the beginning of wisdom. A good
[23:01] understanding have all they that do his
[23:05] commandments, and his praise endureth
[23:08] forever. May God add a blessing to the
[23:11] reading of his word this evening. Let's
[23:14] just bow our heads and worship the Lord
[23:16] in our own way as we we want to create
[23:18] an atmosphere this evening of praise and
[23:21] worship and glory unto the King of
[23:24] Kings. We're here to worship him this
[23:26] evening. We're here to bow down before
[23:28] him. We're here to acknowledge that he
[23:30] is God and he is Lord and Savior over
[23:32] our lives. We are here to declare that
[23:34] he can do anything among us. He can heal
[23:37] the sick among us. He can raise the dead
[23:39] among us. He can make the cripples walk.
[23:42] He can make the blind see. He can fill
[23:45] with the with the Holy Ghost tonight.
[23:47] Whatever your expectation is right now,
[23:49] release it in this place and let the uh
[23:53] let God hear you this evening and and
[23:55] let him answer your prayer as we cry
[23:58] together in his ears tonight. Dear God,
[24:00] heavenly father, we come Lord into the
[24:03] house of God. We are thankful for this
[24:05] opportunity once more to be gathered
[24:08] around your word, Lord. Gathered in your
[24:11] presence, Father. Lord, we know that you
[24:13] are here, Father. And we want to create
[24:15] room for you tonight, Lord, to move
[24:18] among us, Lord, Father, in a mighty
[24:21] mighty way, Lord, Father. Lord, we we
[24:24] release our faith tonight. We throw it
[24:26] out into the depths, Lord Father. We
[24:29] say, "Come, Lord Jesus. Come. come into
[24:32] this place and anoint it and inspired,
[24:35] saturated with your presence, with the
[24:37] presence of your angels, oh God. May you
[24:40] anoint your people as they sing and
[24:41] worship together, as they praise your
[24:43] holy name. May your glory come down and
[24:46] minister to each one, each heart and
[24:48] life that is gathered here this evening.
[24:50] Even those that are hooked up on the
[24:52] internet, Lord, and listening to our
[24:54] live broadcast, we pray that they also
[24:57] will be blessed by what they hear
[24:58] tonight. May they receive faith in their
[25:01] hearts tonight. For faith come by
[25:03] hearing, Lord, and make your minister a
[25:06] flame of fire tonight, Lord. As we get
[25:08] ready to hear once more, Lord, Father,
[25:10] from your servant, may you anoint and
[25:12] inspire us, inspire the word, and we be
[25:15] careful to give you all the praise and
[25:16] glory for all that you have done, that
[25:19] you are doing, and that you are about to
[25:21] do tonight. Have your way, we pray in
[25:24] Jesus Christ's precious name. Amen. And
[25:28] amen. And amen. Praise God. Do you love
[25:30] him this evening?

[25:34] Jesus. Glory to God.

[25:42] leadership tonight?

[40:27] You are on your own.
[40:30] You are God. You are God. Well, you are

[40:41] You are on your throne.
[40:44] You are God alone
[40:49] right now
[40:51] in the good times and bad.
[40:54] Oh, you are on your throne.
[40:58] You are God.
[41:02] You are God alone
[41:05] from before.
[41:09] You are on your throne.
[41:12] You are God.
[41:29] You are God.
[41:36] Oh, you are your
[41:41] God.

[42:14] the Lord? Oh, let's just give him a
[42:17] portion of praise. Say, glory. Say,
[42:21] hallelujah.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, I love you.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Let's just give him a a
[42:27] little wave offering.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. He's
[42:32] wonderful. He's marvelous.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; He's loving.
[42:39] You know, I want to sing this little
[42:41] song for the honor and glory of the
[42:43] Lord. A song we all know. The love of
[42:46] God.
[42:49] You know, when we think of the love of
[42:50] God,
[42:52] you get lost for words.
[42:55] Here standing up in front of you is a
[42:58] young man who
[43:02] Satan had planned to take my life.
[43:05] A man took a gun and he pointed at me.
[43:09] He shot me. The bullet hit here and the
[43:13] bullet came out here.
[43:16] So I supposed to be a dead man.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; But then we must remember that the
[43:21] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[43:23] of the Lord.
[43:25] So when you think of the love of God, it
[43:28] spans space, time, it it covers
[43:31] everything.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; But when you face death, you get a
[43:33] different meaning.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; How much the Lord love us,
[43:38] &gt;&gt; you know? Don't care if you make your
[43:40] bed in hell, he'll come and find you
[43:42] there.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, can we say amen?
[43:45] &gt;&gt; So I want to sing this song more than
[43:48] just words now. We want to sing it with
[43:51] a revelation
[43:53] &gt;&gt; that the love of God is rich and pure.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[44:05] I want to read something for you. Yeah.
[44:08] The prophet.
[44:09] You say, "Friends," this is the children
[44:11] of Israel. You say, "Friends,
[44:13] when you miss the love of God in your
[44:16] hearts, you miss everything.
[44:19] No matter what you've done,
[44:22] where there's tongues, they shall cease.
[44:25] Where there's prophecy, it shall vanish.
[44:28] But where there is charity, it lasts
[44:32] forever. Oh, could we say amen?
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. So, just as I sing,
[44:38] close your eyes and think about what the
[44:41] love of God has done for you.
[44:44] Think about bowels of compassion.
[44:48] And when you go in that place, remember
[44:50] it never stops.
[44:53] And may the words mean more to you
[44:57] as we come to worship him because of his
[45:00] love.
[45:01] The love of God
[45:06] is greater far
[45:10] [Music]
[45:11] than tongue or pen
[45:16] can ever tell.
[45:21] It goes beyond
[45:26] the highest star
[45:31] and reaches
[45:33] to
[45:36] the lowest
[45:38] he
[45:45] bow down with care.
[45:50] God gave his son
[45:55] to
[45:56] [Music]
[45:58] glory his
[46:01] child.
[46:03] He
[46:05] reconciled
[46:08] and pardoned from
[46:11] [Music]
[46:13] his sin. Oh, could we lift our hands and
[46:16] sing? Oh lamb of God,
[46:22] how rich and pure,

[59:26] Well, God bless you, church. It is
[59:29] certainly wonderful to be back in the
[59:31] house of the Lord tonight. And I believe
[59:34] this evening we are here to give the
[59:36] devil a knockout punch in this
[59:38] threeprong attack, this military
[59:41] intervention that God in his wisdom sent
[59:44] our way in the person of the gift of
[59:46] brother Jonathan Martin coming to
[59:48] Trinidad for the very first time. You
[59:50] appreciate God's gift. You appreciate
[59:52] God's servant. And what a blessing he
[59:55] has been yesterday, this morning, and
[59:58] now tonight for this final service. By
[1:00:01] the grace of God, we are under great
[1:00:03] expectation for what God is about to do.
[1:00:06] We certainly appreciate all those who
[1:00:07] have come for the different services,
[1:00:09] those who have connected online as well.
[1:00:12] And tonight, we want to salute and
[1:00:13] welcome our precious brother Daniel
[1:00:15] Hernandez. God bless you, brother
[1:00:16] Daniel. Certainly good to have you here
[1:00:18] with us tonight. Precious brother Norris
[1:00:20] Cummings and his wife is here as well.
[1:00:22] God bless you. Welcome. So I don't want
[1:00:26] to take one more minute than is
[1:00:27] necessary. I believe God has something
[1:00:29] in store for us. And it's the last
[1:00:31] service. There are so many other things
[1:00:34] we could be doing, but we are here with
[1:00:36] our sword drawn looking to knock the
[1:00:38] devil out of your home, out of your
[1:00:40] life, looking for power to be manifested
[1:00:43] in our walk with God. So the cloud of
[1:00:47] glorious move.
[1:00:50] Hallelujah. Move,
[1:00:52] brother Jonathan. Move with the cloud.
[1:00:56] Oh the cloud of glory is moving.
[1:01:02] Oh move with the cloud. Oh move with the
[1:01:06] cloud. Let your spirit arise.
[1:01:11] Strength be with you.
[1:01:14] Come, let us move all together.
[1:01:19] As we follow the way he leads new life,
[1:01:22] we shall receive. As we move with a
[1:01:26] clout, oh, we'll move with a clout.
[1:01:32] Well, praise the Lord. The move is on.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Following vindicated word. Hallelujah.
[1:01:41] He's never led us wrong.
[1:01:44] He's never led us wrong. It's just been
[1:01:46] from victory to victory to victory.
[1:01:50] I'm so glad for the grace of God to
[1:01:53] follow him. Follow where he leads. And I
[1:01:57] like that song. Amen. The move is on.
[1:02:01] Well, we want to say God richly bless
[1:02:04] you and uh we just greet you in the
[1:02:07] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[1:02:09] Jesus Christ. It's been a real uh been a
[1:02:13] real blessing to be here and to minister
[1:02:15] to you and uh we appreciate uh your

[1:02:57] other and uh just enjoy.
[1:03:02] Well, hallelujah.
[1:03:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:07] Amen.
[1:03:09] If if the devil's mad, then that's a
[1:03:15] that's not a bad thing. And uh because
[1:03:18] you know, the devil tries, but he
[1:03:22] doesn't have enough.
[1:03:24] And uh if there's anything that uh we
[1:03:26] know uh if if there's any any testimony
[1:03:31] that we have, the devil just doesn't
[1:03:33] have enough. And uh he fights and tries
[1:03:37] to discourage and he tries to bring
[1:03:39] afflictions and fears and nervousness
[1:03:42] and anxieties and but the devil just
[1:03:45] doesn't have enough. You can't keep a
[1:03:47] son or a daughter of God down.
[1:03:51] And uh so we just thank the Lord. Is it

[1:09:19] and uh then St. John 14
[1:09:23] and we'll read verses 16 down to 20
[1:09:29] and then Psalms 110 the first seven
[1:09:33] verses.
[1:09:41] I am the vine, ye are the branches.
[1:09:46] He that abideth in me and I in him the
[1:09:50] same bringeth forth much fruit.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; For without me ye can do nothing.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; That is a tremendous
[1:10:00] revelation for the hour that we live in.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; That without Jesus Christ we can do

[1:10:14] And I will pray the Father, and he shall
[1:10:17] give you another comforter, that he that
[1:10:20] he may abide with you forever. Even the
[1:10:23] Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot
[1:10:26] receive, because it seeth him not,
[1:10:31] neither knoweth him, but ye know him.
[1:10:34] For he dwelleth with you, and shall be
[1:10:37] in you.

[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? Amen.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; I will come to you.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Yet a little while on the world seeth me
[1:10:51] no more, but ye see me, because I live,
[1:10:56] you shall live also.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; At that day ye shall know that I am in
[1:11:00] the Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Psalms 110.
[1:11:08] And just reading the first seven verses.
[1:11:14] The Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou at
[1:11:17] my right hand until I make thine enemies
[1:11:20] thy foottool.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; The Lord shall send the rod of thy
[1:11:25] strength out of Zion. Rule thou in the
[1:11:28] midst of thine enemies.
[1:11:31] Thy people shall be willing in the day
[1:11:34] of thy power. In the beauties of
[1:11:37] holiness from the womb of the morning,
[1:11:39] thou hast the dw of thy youth. The Lord
[1:11:43] hath sworn and will not repent. Thou art
[1:11:46] a priest forever after the order of
[1:11:49] Melzdc.
[1:11:51] The Lord at thy right hand shall strike
[1:11:54] through kings in the day of his wrath.
[1:11:57] He shall judge among the heathen. He
[1:12:00] shall fill the places with the dead
[1:12:03] bodies. He shall wound the heads over
[1:12:05] many countries. He shall drink of the
[1:12:08] brook and the way. Therefore shall he
[1:12:11] lift up thy head. And just verse three
[1:12:16] again, thy people shall be willing in
[1:12:20] the day of thy power.
[1:12:23] How many would like to be remembered in
[1:12:25] a word of prayer?
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Just got a need on your heart.
[1:12:32] Heavenly Father, we surrender our hearts
[1:12:36] to you, Lord, for this service.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Father, we stand before your presence
[1:12:42] and know that you're here with us, Lord.
[1:12:44] And as we have read the word, you
[1:12:47] promised to come to us and we know that
[1:12:50] you're here, Father. You're our
[1:12:51] comforter. You're our strength, the
[1:12:54] fulfillment of every promise for this
[1:12:56] day.
[1:12:57] Father, I just ask that you minister to
[1:13:00] your people. Lord,

[1:13:04] need, you know, the that is under that

[1:13:11] your children, Father. Come in your
[1:13:13] mercy, Lord, and give strength and
[1:13:16] healing and fillings of the Holy Ghost,
[1:13:19] refillings, Lord, and just pour out
[1:13:22] yourself among us, oh God. We would ask
[1:13:25] these things in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. God richly bless you.
[1:13:32] You can be seated.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; I would like to just speak for a a text
[1:13:37] for just a few moments that the dynamics
[1:13:40] is here.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; I believe that we're living in the
[1:13:44] grandest of all ages.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And I I see I I see with uh my
[1:13:51] own eyes and my heart looking through a
[1:13:54] a a heart of understanding and faith
[1:13:58] that God has moved in his mercy upon us
[1:14:01] in this hour. Amen.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; He's moved in such a supernatural way
[1:14:07] that for that so we won't miss what he
[1:14:10] has done and what he is doing and and it
[1:14:14] is his grace upon our lives. The prophet
[1:14:17] of God would say that my mission I
[1:14:19] believe to the earth is to forrun the
[1:14:22] coming word.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. the coming word which is Christ
[1:14:26] and Christ in him has the millennium and
[1:14:29] has everything right there because he is
[1:14:32] the word.
[1:14:34] Brother Brandham would say that the
[1:14:36] message is Christ and we're not just
[1:14:40] come together to talk about the message,
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; but we're come together to get in the
[1:14:45] message,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; to get under the message.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; And again, the message is Christ. And so
[1:14:52] we we know that Satan, all of the
[1:14:55] mechanics is all in order when Satan is
[1:15:00] about to be incarnate in the man of sin
[1:15:03] and he's about to start his ride.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; And uh we we see that that last horse
[1:15:10] rider is the pale horse, which is
[1:15:13] spiritual death. And it's the blending
[1:15:15] of all of the other horses together, all
[1:15:17] of the other colors, and it makes a pale
[1:15:21] color and it's spiritual death. And the
[1:15:24] last plague to fall in Egypt in the
[1:15:28] Exodus was spiritual death.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; And we see that at the same time that
[1:15:34] that spiritual death is striking that
[1:15:37] God sends a a prophet with a declaration
[1:15:41] that I am come down.
[1:15:44] That was what Moses his message was a
[1:15:48] declaration of not just a man coming to
[1:15:52] say let my people go but it was it was
[1:15:55] who was doing the speaking
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; because it was God speaking through a
[1:16:00] prophet that I remember my promise and I
[1:16:05] am come down. Amen.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; You see, we remember that Luke the 17th
[1:16:10] chapter would say that as it was in the
[1:16:13] days of Noah and as it was in the days
[1:16:15] of Sodom, so shall it be in the
[1:16:18] revealing of the son of man. So Jesus
[1:16:22] knew that the conditions of the age
[1:16:25] would be such as it was in Sodom and was
[1:16:28] in the days of Noah. But he was speaking
[1:16:31] himself a a a a body or a a a coming in
[1:16:35] this time in this age. He was
[1:16:38] prophesying that I am going to be
[1:16:40] revealed.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; And we find that the fulfillment of that
[1:16:44] is a revelation the 10th chapter that
[1:16:47] the mighty angel has come down and the
[1:16:50] father would say only Christ it can be.
[1:16:54] You see the mighty angel descending with
[1:16:57] an open book and the mysteries are
[1:17:00] revealed at the sounding of the seventh
[1:17:02] angel's message. We find again that this
[1:17:06] day this the scripture being fulfilled
[1:17:09] is 1 Thessalonians the 4th chapter the
[1:17:12] 16th verse that the Lord himself shall
[1:17:16] descend from heaven with a shout with
[1:17:20] the voice of the archangel and with the
[1:17:22] trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:17:25] shall rise first. We find again in 2
[1:17:29] Corinthians the 3rd chapter the 17th
[1:17:31] verse. Now the Lord is that spirit and
[1:17:35] where the spirit of the Lord is, there
[1:17:38] is liberty. Amen. So it's in this age
[1:17:43] that that the Lord himself, not just a
[1:17:46] man, not not a pope, not a bishop, not
[1:17:50] just an apostle, but it is the Lord
[1:17:53] himself that has descended. Amen. It's
[1:17:57] the everpresence of himself. And the
[1:18:00] prophet of God would say that the son of
[1:18:03] man has already come from glory and is
[1:18:06] revealing himself for the past few years
[1:18:09] to his church in mercy, showing them his
[1:18:13] great presence, doing the same things
[1:18:15] that he did when he was here on earth,
[1:18:18] revealing himself like he did to Abraham
[1:18:20] before the destruction. He has come now
[1:18:23] in mercy, revealing himself to the
[1:18:26] church. It's being laughed at and
[1:18:29] scoffed at. Now you see Ephesians the 2
[1:18:32] chapter beginning at verse one, Paul
[1:18:35] would say, "And you hath he quickened."
[1:18:39] Amen. I like that. You hath he
[1:18:42] quickened. In other words, you can put
[1:18:44] yourself right there and and put your
[1:18:47] name. You He's speaking to you. It's a
[1:18:51] personal understanding or personal
[1:18:53] realization that I have been quickened.
[1:18:57] Amen. You hath he quickened, who were
[1:19:00] dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in
[1:19:04] time past you walked according to the
[1:19:06] course of this world, according to the
[1:19:08] prince of the power of the air, the
[1:19:10] spirit that now workketh in the children
[1:19:12] of disobedience, among whom also we all
[1:19:16] had our conversation in times past in
[1:19:19] the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the
[1:19:21] desires of the flesh and of the mind,
[1:19:23] and were by nature the children of wrath
[1:19:26] even as others. But God, who is rich in
[1:19:30] mercy, for his great love, wherewith he
[1:19:34] loved us, even when we were dead in
[1:19:37] sins, hath quickened us together with
[1:19:41] Christ. By grace you are saved. So Paul
[1:19:44] is showing us, amen, that we were one
[1:19:47] way. We were identified as the children
[1:19:50] of disobedience. We had our conversation
[1:19:53] in the world. But God who is rich in
[1:19:56] mercy, that means everything to us. But
[1:20:00] God who is rich in mercy. Amen. You see,
[1:20:03] the prophet of God would take that and
[1:20:06] preach God rich in mercy and show us
[1:20:09] that we were predestinated
[1:20:12] before the foundation of the world. That
[1:20:14] we were always seed, but we were in the
[1:20:18] world and we just had the muck and the
[1:20:20] filth of of the world upon us. But God
[1:20:24] who is rich in mercy had an appointed
[1:20:27] time that we would come out of the
[1:20:29] darkness into his marvelous light. And
[1:20:34] you who once were dead are now quickened
[1:20:38] and made alive. And you never become
[1:20:41] seed at the altar. You always were seed.
[1:20:45] And because you were seed, you could be
[1:20:49] quickened. Because there is nothing to
[1:20:52] quicken. Amen. You can't just quicken
[1:20:54] the rock. You can't just quicken the
[1:20:56] dirt. But it takes a seed to be
[1:21:00] quickened. And because you are quickened
[1:21:03] is an witness that this rapture is for
[1:21:07] you. This resurrection is for you. Amen.
[1:21:12] Deliverance and overcoming power is for
[1:21:15] you. It's because of God's rich mercy
[1:21:19] upon our lives. Amen. You see, I I think
[1:21:23] of how that God rich in mercy when the
[1:21:27] children of Israel in the Exodus had
[1:21:30] sinned and and and there was death in
[1:21:32] the camp. But God rich in mercy told
[1:21:36] Moses that you take a brace a brass
[1:21:39] serpent and put it on a pole. And anyone
[1:21:43] that can look and and and as they look
[1:21:46] at that brazen serpent, they'll look and
[1:21:48] they shall live. Amen. Oh, what a mercy.
[1:21:53] when death people were dying left and
[1:21:55] right. But a prophet began to tell them,
[1:21:59] you've got to look look away, amen, from
[1:22:02] from your faults and look away from the
[1:22:05] sin. And you've got to look because that
[1:22:09] is God's mercy. That is God's atonement.
[1:22:11] And if you can see it, you can live. I
[1:22:15] think of how that that angel, Amen,
[1:22:18] moved upon that pole. Amen. Oh, God rich
[1:22:23] in mercy allowed. It wasn't just a brass
[1:22:26] serpent, but it was God coming upon and
[1:22:30] moving upon something to bring mercy
[1:22:33] because he was he was showing in time
[1:22:36] what was going to happen with Jesus on
[1:22:39] Calvary. And if you can see Jesus and
[1:22:42] him crucified and you can see that he
[1:22:45] died for your sins and he took your
[1:22:48] place. And if you can catch a vision of
[1:22:52] it and and see by revelation that it is
[1:22:56] finished uh and that he died and he was
[1:22:59] buried but he rose again on the third
[1:23:01] day for your justification. I tell you
[1:23:04] friends, it's mercy. If you can see it,
[1:23:08] I tell you. Amen. There was God in his
[1:23:12] mercy and how that the pillar of fire
[1:23:15] had moved. Amen. on on that brass
[1:23:18] serpent. But now it was a time that God
[1:23:21] was that angel was coming down upon upon
[1:23:25] the waters there at the the pool of
[1:23:28] shalom. Amen. And they understood and
[1:23:31] recognized that the angel of the Lord
[1:23:34] would come in a certain season and would
[1:23:37] trouble the waters. And how they knew
[1:23:40] that the angel was moving is because it
[1:23:43] moved from the natural to the
[1:23:45] supernatural. The currents would be
[1:23:47] moving one direction, but when the
[1:23:49] presence of that angel would begin to
[1:23:51] move, the current would be changed and
[1:23:54] it would go the other direction. And
[1:23:56] then they understood if I can just get
[1:23:58] into that water, it's mercy. If I could
[1:24:02] just get into it, I know that I I will
[1:24:06] be healed of whatever affliction. I tell
[1:24:10] you, that was where the angel of the
[1:24:11] Lord was moving. But you see what the
[1:24:14] prophet of God would tell us. What are
[1:24:16] you looking to church all these last
[1:24:20] days? He's been right among us people
[1:24:23] and we forgot it. Oh, how easy it is
[1:24:26] sometimes to forget when we're going
[1:24:29] through a hard time and we're wondering
[1:24:32] how the bills are going to be paid or
[1:24:34] wondering how we're going to be healed
[1:24:35] or delivered from an affliction or when
[1:24:38] sin a maybe come into and grip our
[1:24:41] lives. And we forget that God's mercy is
[1:24:45] here among us. Uh it's the Lord himself
[1:24:48] uh revealing himself uh amen to a lost
[1:24:52] and dying world. Uh without his mercy,
[1:24:55] we would all die. We would all perish.
[1:24:58] We all deserve hell. But God rich in
[1:25:02] mercy has reached downh and give us in a
[1:25:05] lifeline that if you can see it and get
[1:25:09] a hold of it it's transforming mercy.
[1:25:13] Hallelujah. How we forget it but he sent
[1:25:17] right among us and we didn't know it.
[1:25:20] The Holy Spirit is here this morning.
[1:25:23] And maybe many will go away and forget
[1:25:25] it. Maybe many that sick will forget to
[1:25:28] believe and anchor their faith right
[1:25:30] where it should be. Now truly the pull
[1:25:34] is troubled. The waters are whirling
[1:25:37] backwards from natural showing the
[1:25:39] supernatural. The Holy Spirit is here
[1:25:42] taking a normal bunch of people
[1:25:45] intelligent sitting here well-dressed
[1:25:48] well educated looking. The Holy Spirit
[1:25:51] fall upon them and something whirls them
[1:25:55] around. They holler, "Glory to God.
[1:25:58] Hallelujah. What's the matter?" The
[1:26:00] troubling of the water. Sinners sitting
[1:26:04] there. Backsliders, prostitutes,
[1:26:07] drunkards, and everything else are
[1:26:09] saintly, godly. You can't put a finger
[1:26:12] on their lives anywhere since they
[1:26:14] receive it. What is it? The troubling of
[1:26:17] the waters. What are you looking at? the
[1:26:20] Holy Spirit fall among us. You see,
[1:26:23] amen. Those waters is a type of
[1:26:26] humanity. When you read water in the
[1:26:29] Bible, it's a type of humanity. And the
[1:26:32] angel of the Lord coming upon humanity,
[1:26:35] taking someone that was a prostitute uh
[1:26:38] and bringing them back uh to avert a
[1:26:42] righteous uh woman again in the presence
[1:26:44] of God. taking an alcoholic uh and
[1:26:47] restoring them sober, taking someone uh
[1:26:50] that is so filthy and sin. But God moves
[1:26:54] upon humanity and brings them back to
[1:26:58] being a son and daughter again. Uh
[1:27:00] that's what we are declaring. That's
[1:27:02] what we're pointing to is there is a
[1:27:04] reality to this message. It is the angel
[1:27:07] of the Lord and he's troubling the
[1:27:10] waters.
[1:27:11] [Applause]
[1:27:13] He's changing lives. He's setting the
[1:27:16] captives free. He's taking the ashes of
[1:27:20] our past and bringing a beauty out of
[1:27:23] our lives. It's the power of God that's
[1:27:26] doing it. You see, Isaiah 45 and 22
[1:27:31] says, "Look unto me
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; and be ye saved
[1:27:35] all the ends of the earth, for I am God
[1:27:39] and there is none else." You see the
[1:27:42] call for years, look unto me, ye ends of
[1:27:44] the earth. I would like to kind of turn
[1:27:46] that just a little bit and look
[1:27:49] especially unto me at the end of each
[1:27:53] world system because he always makes
[1:27:56] himself known so real at the end of a
[1:28:00] world system when it's coming to its
[1:28:02] end. Look unto me all ye ends of the
[1:28:07] world, I might say. Amen. See, look unto
[1:28:10] me. I am God. There is none other. In a
[1:28:15] time that we are living in now, what
[1:28:18] could we look to that would be more
[1:28:21] solid than God? And God is the word. So
[1:28:24] look to the word of God today for your
[1:28:27] answer. I know people's going to
[1:28:29] psychologist. I know people are trying
[1:28:32] to go from this religion to this
[1:28:34] religion and they're trying to find
[1:28:36] peace and they're trying to find a cure
[1:28:38] and they're trying to find something
[1:28:40] that will help their family and restore
[1:28:42] marriages and and will bring a peace to
[1:28:45] their lives and people are becoming
[1:28:47] neurotics. People are nervous. People
[1:28:50] the world's falling apart. But it's at
[1:28:53] the end of the world system. It's at the
[1:28:56] time of the end is when God reveals
[1:29:01] himself uh in reality. It's when God
[1:29:05] steps in on the scene and says, "Look to
[1:29:08] me. I'm your healer. I'm your deliverer.
[1:29:11] I'm your Holy Ghost. I'm your rapture.
[1:29:14] I'm the one that restores. I am God. And
[1:29:18] there is none other. I am the remedy. I
[1:29:22] am the atonement. I am the cure for your
[1:29:25] sickness. I am the mercy seat that has
[1:29:27] come down to change the situation uh to
[1:29:30] break the shackles of your life. Uh to
[1:29:33] bring transforming grace look to me and
[1:29:37] all ye ends of the world.
[1:29:45] You see usually people come to a
[1:29:48] meeting, a religious gathering. Some of
[1:29:51] them go to find a big crowd of people to
[1:29:53] sat with. Oh, I hate to say this, but
[1:29:57] it's true. Some go to church just to
[1:29:59] show their clothes they're wearing. Some
[1:30:02] goes to church because they say this is
[1:30:04] the biggest church in the city. It's got
[1:30:07] the best name. A certain class of people
[1:30:09] goes to this church. That's wrong.
[1:30:12] You're not looking to the right thing
[1:30:15] that the church is established for.
[1:30:18] You see what God promised for the hour,
[1:30:22] look for that to be fulfilled.
[1:30:25] You must look to him because he is the
[1:30:28] word. Search the scriptures. Find out
[1:30:32] what is promised for this day and then
[1:30:35] look at it under expectation for it to
[1:30:38] be fulfilled. Did he not say, "I am the
[1:30:41] God that healeth all thy diseases?" Is
[1:30:43] he not the God that said, "I will come
[1:30:45] down." Is he not the God that said, "I'm
[1:30:48] going to rapture you and you will be
[1:30:50] sinless and blameless." Is he not the
[1:30:53] God that said, "I've got the power to
[1:30:55] change things. I've got the power to
[1:30:57] transform your life. I'm the one that
[1:31:00] changes you from glory to glory to
[1:31:02] glory." You've got to look at the
[1:31:05] promise.
[1:31:09] Quit looking at your bills and look at
[1:31:10] the promise. Quit looking at your needs
[1:31:13] and look at the promise. Quit looking at
[1:31:15] your situation and look at the promise.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; You see the prophet of God in the sermon
[1:31:24] going beyond the camp says, "As I as as
[1:31:27] I look and preach across the nation and
[1:31:29] watch the people, I am fully persuaded
[1:31:32] that that the people are not getting to
[1:31:34] Christ. And I believe that it's the
[1:31:36] enemy that's throwed this hindrance
[1:31:39] because the reason I believe this is he
[1:31:41] is not the object that they have been
[1:31:44] pointed to. They have either been
[1:31:46] pointed to a dogma or a doctrine or a
[1:31:49] party or an experience or a sensation or
[1:31:52] something like that instead of being
[1:31:53] pointed to Christ the word.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; You see, you see some other finger is
[1:31:59] pointing them to someone's church. Some
[1:32:02] other finger is pointing them. you've
[1:32:04] got to believe my doctrine. Some other
[1:32:07] some other finger is pointing them to a
[1:32:09] certain sensation or or a certain theory
[1:32:12] or or a certain system or or a
[1:32:14] tradition, but you're pointed to the
[1:32:17] wrong thing. It's pointed in the wrong
[1:32:20] way because Jesus said, "I am the way. I
[1:32:25] am the truth. I am the life." I tell
[1:32:28] you, see, it's the same Jesus. That same
[1:32:32] Jesus lives. But you see, what good does
[1:32:35] it to try to get a man warned by
[1:32:38] pointing him to a painted fire? You see,
[1:32:40] that's a that's a historical fire. You
[1:32:43] say it isn't a painted fire, Brother
[1:32:45] Brandham. It's a picture of a fire that
[1:32:48] actually happened. You can't get warned
[1:32:51] by the picture. There's that something
[1:32:53] that was.
[1:32:55] What about now?
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:00] Hallelujah.
[1:33:01] You can't get warm but just a picture.
[1:33:04] Amen. But it's got to be a reality. You
[1:33:07] can't get warm. Amen. I I I love that
[1:33:11] picture. Let me just put it like this.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; I love that picture.
[1:33:17] I I've got it in my home. I've got it
[1:33:20] everywhere I go. Amen. But just see it's
[1:33:23] more than just a picture.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; It's about that pillar of fire.
[1:33:29] And this is more than just a picture,
[1:33:32] but that is Christ. It's more than just
[1:33:35] looking back, a man, back in the 50s and
[1:33:38] and saying, "Yes, we've got a picture,
[1:33:41] but what about that reality of the
[1:33:44] pillar of high coming off of the picture
[1:33:47] and saying it's now? Now is the day of
[1:33:51] visitation.
[1:33:53] Now is the time that the angel of the
[1:33:55] Lord is accompanying this message and
[1:33:58] he's proving himself alive.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; You see, always pointing to what God's
[1:34:09] going to do or what he has done and
[1:34:12] ignoring what he's doing. That's the way
[1:34:16] we get discrepancies
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; in it.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; That's from the sermon, the seed of
[1:34:21] discrepancy. You see, the prophet of God
[1:34:23] would say, "Amen, that picture," Amen.
[1:34:27] The picture that I just showed you says,
[1:34:28] "Ever since I've been out to stand back
[1:34:31] and try to keep out of the picture just
[1:34:34] as much as I possibly could so they
[1:34:37] would see the Lord Jesus." And I want
[1:34:41] you now to look to what I'm pointing to,
[1:34:44] not because I'm telling you this, that
[1:34:47] the angel of the Lord, Amen. He's
[1:34:51] saying, "I'm in the picture, but I'm
[1:34:54] trying to get myself as far away from
[1:34:56] that picture as I can because I'm
[1:34:58] pointing to the pillar of fire. I don't
[1:35:00] want you to just see a man. I want you
[1:35:03] to see who I'm introducing you to. It's
[1:35:05] Christ.
[1:35:07] [Applause]
[1:35:10] That's the answer.
[1:35:12] That's the one that we're following."
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; You see, I'm wondering today it's what's
[1:35:19] happening. Are we really getting the
[1:35:21] people to God or are we just getting
[1:35:23] them to church? We must get them to
[1:35:25] Christ. We're this quick getting power.
[1:35:28] It's good to go to church. Sure, if
[1:35:30] that's as far as we go, it's not far
[1:35:32] enough. When you come to church, that's
[1:35:34] good. But go on to Christ from the
[1:35:36] church because we must receive this
[1:35:39] quickening power. if we ever expect to
[1:35:42] be in that general resurrection because
[1:35:45] it's the only thing that will ever bring
[1:35:48] us from the dead. For if the spirit that
[1:35:51] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:35:53] you, it'll also quicken bring to life
[1:35:56] your mortal bodies. What a promise to
[1:35:58] us. You see again in the rising that was
[1:36:01] the Easter seal. This is the rising of
[1:36:03] the sun. We cannot do it by word only.
[1:36:06] We cannot do it by some tradition of
[1:36:08] man. We only reflect exactly what we're
[1:36:13] pointing to. I'm afraid today that too
[1:36:16] many of us are not getting people to
[1:36:17] Christ. We're getting them to a church,
[1:36:19] to a theory. But we must get them to
[1:36:22] Christ. He is the only one. And the only
[1:36:25] one that has life. He that has the son
[1:36:29] has life. Amen. You see, we're only
[1:36:33] reflecting exactly what we're pointing
[1:36:36] to. Amen. were pointing to scriptures
[1:36:39] such as Luke 17:30, Revelations 10,
[1:36:43] Malachi 4, St. John 12, St. John 14,
[1:36:47] Matthew 17, Joel 2, 1 Thessalonians 4,
[1:36:52] and all the scriptures pointing to this
[1:36:55] last day, and that is Christ.
[1:37:00] Every one of these end time scriptures
[1:37:02] are pointing to one thing, and that is
[1:37:05] Christ.
[1:37:08] Oh, if you can hide away in that now, in
[1:37:10] that secret place, you can eat and see
[1:37:13] the goodness and mercy of God. If you're
[1:37:16] sick, there is healing there. That's why
[1:37:19] I say there's healing in this message.
[1:37:21] There's mercy in this message because
[1:37:24] the message is not a man. The message is
[1:37:27] Christ.
[1:37:30] We're not trying to get you to a
[1:37:32] doctrine. Not trying to get you to a
[1:37:34] certain man. Not trying to get you to a
[1:37:36] personality. Not trying to get you from
[1:37:39] this church over to this church. We're
[1:37:41] trying to get you to Christ.
[1:37:46] Mercy is here. Deliverance is here.
[1:37:49] Grace, grace unto the headstone. It's
[1:37:52] Christ.
[1:37:53] [Music]
[1:37:56] [Applause]
[1:37:58] When you're eating this eagle food is
[1:38:00] the cravings from your theophony.
[1:38:03] When you're reading this message and
[1:38:05] you're in it and there's a pull and
[1:38:08] something is saying that's exactly what
[1:38:10] I needed. That's exactly what my family
[1:38:12] needs. You're hearing from your
[1:38:14] theophony and as you are feeding upon
[1:38:17] this vindicated revealed Christ. Uh it
[1:38:20] has given you strength. Uh you are not
[1:38:22] belonging to a chicken pin. You don't
[1:38:25] belong to some man. You belong to
[1:38:28] Christ. Uh you don't belong to a
[1:38:30] denomination. You don't belong to a
[1:38:32] system. You don't belong to some dead
[1:38:35] cold formal leisia. Amen. You belong to
[1:38:39] Christ. And we've heard from our
[1:38:43] theophony. We've heard the eagle scream,
[1:38:46] "Come up.
[1:38:48] Come up. There's a force. There's a
[1:38:51] magnetizing.
[1:38:53] Come up." And now it's your job. Flap
[1:38:56] the wings.
[1:38:58] Flap the wings. Now is your part.
[1:39:03] Get into the sky, little eagle.
[1:39:06] [Applause]
[1:39:06] [Music]
[1:39:10] [Applause]
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Put your faith into action.
[1:39:18] [Music]
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "The dynamics
[1:39:27] is the Holy Spirit.
[1:39:30] The mechanics don't run the church. It's
[1:39:33] the dynamics the Holy Ghost that gets
[1:39:36] into this word. It's not a seminary that
[1:39:39] teaches you all the theology and the
[1:39:41] Greek interpretations, but it's the
[1:39:43] dynamics of the Holy Ghost in there to
[1:39:45] set that a fire and bring it to pass to
[1:39:48] make it live just exactly what the
[1:39:51] promise word is for this hour. Not the
[1:39:53] mechanics, the dynamics. It takes
[1:39:56] mechanics and dynamics together. The
[1:39:59] word and the spirit, they are the one
[1:40:02] that gives life.
[1:40:07] The dynamics
[1:40:09] is the spark that ignites the word.
[1:40:14] That's why the prophet says, "We put so
[1:40:16] much emphasis on the mechanics. We've
[1:40:18] had the mechanics, but we've been
[1:40:20] waiting for the spark. And Christ
[1:40:23] himself uh has come down uh to spark
[1:40:26] your faith uh to ignite the word in your
[1:40:29] heart. Uh it'll heal you, deliver you,
[1:40:32] it'll restore marriages. Uh it'll change
[1:40:35] lives. Uh it'll preach the revival. It's
[1:40:38] the word made flesh.
[1:40:44] It's quickening power that quickens and
[1:40:47] brings resurrection life. Quickens the
[1:40:50] word into reality. manifestation of his
[1:40:54] resurrection.
[1:40:55] That's exactly what has happened in this
[1:40:57] hour. It's the quickening power is the
[1:41:00] manifestation of life upon life upon
[1:41:05] life. Hallelujah.
[1:41:07] [Applause]
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; You see, it's the person of Jesus Christ
[1:41:13] himself returned in spirit form to
[1:41:16] manifest every promise for the last
[1:41:18] days.
[1:41:20] Luke 17:30 the so shall it be in the
[1:41:23] revealing of the son of man that is
[1:41:26] prophecy but revelations 10 1-7 was the
[1:41:31] fulfillment mercy has come the book that
[1:41:34] was closed the book of redemption was
[1:41:38] that was sealed up has now been open and
[1:41:41] mercy has been released look
[1:41:45] and live look and see your mercy seat
[1:41:50] Look and see your atonement. Look and
[1:41:53] see what God has done for us.
[1:41:56] There's healing in the book of
[1:41:58] redemption. There's deliverance in the
[1:42:00] book of redemption. There's rapturing
[1:42:02] faith.
[1:42:05] [Applause]
[1:42:08] But it's more than just a book.
[1:42:10] It's more than just a title deed.
[1:42:13] But you see the abstract
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; had to come and make sure there was no
[1:42:18] leans upon the title deed.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; So God rich in mercy sent the Holy Ghost
[1:42:24] the dynamics
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; to take it all the way back. Run it all
[1:42:30] the way back before there was a devil.
[1:42:33] Before there was sin, before you made
[1:42:36] one mistake, the Holy Ghost took it all
[1:42:39] the way back to the eternal thoughts of
[1:42:41] God. and he saw you there free,
[1:42:45] delivered, righteous, perfect, already
[1:42:49] glorified. And the Holy Ghost came back
[1:42:53] upon the title deed and said, "You're
[1:42:55] free to believe it. You're free to claim
[1:42:58] it. You're free to say, "This is my
[1:43:00] rights. I'm an heir to all that God has
[1:43:05] promised."
[1:43:11] What are you looking at?
[1:43:13] You got to look at the right thing.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; If you get off of just a little bit,
[1:43:18] you'll miss it. But you got to stick
[1:43:21] with the guide. You got to You can't go
[1:43:24] around and around in circles. You got to
[1:43:26] You can't get puffed up and say, "I've
[1:43:28] got this. I know how to get out of this
[1:43:30] wilderness." You've got You're just
[1:43:32] going to be in the death march. But the
[1:43:34] prophet of God said, "I thought I was a
[1:43:36] good guide, but he just kept doing
[1:43:38] circles." And he realized he needed
[1:43:41] something greater than himself.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And church, we are tired of just
[1:43:47] denominational systems. We are tired of
[1:43:51] just man interpreting the message to us.
[1:43:53] We need the man Christ Jesus to bring a
[1:43:58] personal revelation of who we are and
[1:44:01] what we believe.
[1:44:04] [Music]
[1:44:08] We're in gross darkness.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; It's lay out a sea out there. But that's
[1:44:14] why the prophet of God said, "You got to
[1:44:15] come on up. You got to come out of the
[1:44:17] age to see what is promised for the age.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; You got to get out of the darkness to be
[1:44:23] able to see that there's light shining
[1:44:26] on scriptures for this day." There's
[1:44:28] your answer.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Am I making sense to you?
[1:44:33] You see, you got if if all you can see
[1:44:35] is wilderness, but if someone can lift
[1:44:39] you up and you have a vision to see and
[1:44:43] say, "Oh, there it is." And that's what
[1:44:46] the prophet did. An eagle power, an
[1:44:49] anointing to lift you up and give you a
[1:44:53] vision and say, "There he is. Look."
[1:44:57] Don't get your eyes on the left or the
[1:44:59] right. Look.
[1:45:02] There's the dynamics. There's the
[1:45:04] quickening. There's your mercy. There is
[1:45:07] where there's the answer for your
[1:45:09] family.
[1:45:10] [Applause]
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; God is supernatural,
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; but he can only operate in a people that
[1:45:20] believes him.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; And that's why faith is a revelation.
[1:45:26] And the son of man shall be revealed.
[1:45:28] And when you see him, it does something
[1:45:32] because you realize that's my answer.
[1:45:37] That's the Lord himself. That's the
[1:45:39] creator of heavens and earth. That's the
[1:45:41] power of his creative word that can make
[1:45:45] something out of nothing. And if I just
[1:45:48] hold to him, it'll change the
[1:45:50] situations.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; It'll change situations that look
[1:45:54] impossible.
[1:45:59] You see, Hebrews 13:8 is the same
[1:46:01] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; In other words, the In other words, the
[1:46:07] same pillar of fire that was with Moses,
[1:46:09] that came to Paul is the same one that
[1:46:12] came to William Brandom and it's the
[1:46:14] same one with us tonight.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; But where's he at? On the word. You got
[1:46:22] to believe the word. And that's why the
[1:46:24] prophet of God said, "I've come. I It's
[1:46:27] a fulfillment of Malachi 4. It's the
[1:46:29] fulfillment of Revelations 10:7. It's
[1:46:31] the fulfillment of the Leodysian church
[1:46:33] age messenger. What is he doing? He's
[1:46:35] stepping forth as a representative of
[1:46:38] the Amen,
[1:46:40] the faithful and true witness over the
[1:46:43] word. That's what the prophet is. He's
[1:46:46] only a representative of God. And in
[1:46:49] this age, it says, "I am the amen."
[1:46:53] What does that mean? I am the final say.
[1:47:02] I know the devil's been trying to tell
[1:47:03] you that he's got the final say over
[1:47:06] your life. It's a lie from the devil.
[1:47:09] It's God that's got the final say. It's
[1:47:12] this message that is praying blood over
[1:47:15] your life and saying it's God that's the
[1:47:18] author. He's the finisher. He's the
[1:47:21] absolute. He's the amen. He's got final
[1:47:25] supreme authority over your life.
[1:47:30] [Applause]
[1:47:33] That
[1:47:34] that demon that's trying to destroy your
[1:47:36] marriage, he don't have the final say.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; That demon of sickness that's trying to
[1:47:42] drag you to a premature grave, he don't
[1:47:45] have the final say.
[1:47:48] That demon that's trying to trying to
[1:47:50] work on your passion and make you lust
[1:47:53] and all these things, that doesn't have
[1:47:55] the final say.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; That spirit that's trying to just make
[1:47:59] you just come to church and go through
[1:48:01] the motion. I've been there. I know what
[1:48:03] it's about. You can shout just as good
[1:48:05] as anyone else. You can get out of the
[1:48:08] seat just as good as anyone else, but
[1:48:10] you're thinking of the next meal.
[1:48:14] I know what I'm talking about. This is
[1:48:16] more than just going through the motion.
[1:48:19] This is a revelation that this Christ
[1:48:23] that is here now present tense that can
[1:48:27] change your circumstance, change your
[1:48:30] situation.
[1:48:32] What about it, young people? You're the
[1:48:34] next generation.
[1:48:36] You're the final voice, the final age
[1:48:39] under your messenger. What about it,
[1:48:41] young people? I say this God lives. I
[1:48:44] say he still delivers from cancer. He
[1:48:47] still delivers from nervousness. He
[1:48:49] still delivers from oppression. He still
[1:48:51] delivers from depression. He still is
[1:48:54] the mighty conqueror. He's the final say
[1:48:58] over your life.
[1:49:01] [Applause]
[1:49:01] [Music]
[1:49:04] Don't let the devil lie to you
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; and tell you that whispering his lies
[1:49:11] and telling you that he's going to make
[1:49:13] you do this and make you do that. That's
[1:49:16] a lie from the devil.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; If I if I asked for a show of hands, how
[1:49:21] many time How many How many times did
[1:49:23] you think that you were going to quit?
[1:49:26] Who all thought that you wouldn't even
[1:49:27] be here today?
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Young people, I want you to look around
[1:49:32] and see all the hands. Raise them high.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; The devil has told us over and over and
[1:49:41] over, you're not going to make it.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; 43 years of my life and the devil has
[1:49:49] hounded me and fought me and lied to me
[1:49:52] and said I would never even be here. But
[1:49:55] I'm here by the grace of God to tell you
[1:49:58] the devil don't have enough.
[1:50:02] The devil's lies is not the final say
[1:50:05] over you.
[1:50:07] Look to the word.
[1:50:12] What has come in this age? Again, it's
[1:50:15] not just a man trying to preach to you.
[1:50:17] It's the divine vindicated supreme
[1:50:20] authority of God.
[1:50:24] [Music]
[1:50:27] I'm not making it up.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; I'm spraying blood over your life.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; You're healed by his stripes.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; In my name, you shall cast out devils.
[1:50:39] Those demons of oppression can't stay in
[1:50:41] your life. Those demons of depression
[1:50:44] can't hold you.
[1:50:46] Those marriage conflicts can destroy
[1:50:48] you.
[1:50:51] [Applause]
[1:50:52] I stand here, these brothers stand here
[1:50:54] as a representative of the Lord himself
[1:50:58] and declare unto you there is a bleach
[1:51:01] that can dissolve your past, dissolve
[1:51:03] your sins. It's because the quickening
[1:51:06] power of God is here to change the
[1:51:09] situation. It's his mercy upon us.
[1:51:13] [Music]
[1:51:16] I know what I'm talking about.
[1:51:18] [Music]
[1:51:19] I've been ready to throw in the towel.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; I've been so punched drunk that I didn't
[1:51:24] think I would get off the mat. But I'm
[1:51:26] here by the grace of God. It's his
[1:51:28] mercy.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; The devil hasounded me and hounded me
[1:51:32] and hounded me and beat me and beat me
[1:51:34] and beat me. And I didn't think that I
[1:51:36] would ever get off of the mat again. But
[1:51:38] yet there was the devil saying one, two,
[1:51:42] three. He was about to count me out. But
[1:51:45] then a mercy,
[1:51:47] the son of man revealing himself in
[1:51:49] mercy. The dynamics of the Holy Ghost be
[1:51:55] to move and stir my soul and I couldn't
[1:51:58] stay down. It was because there was
[1:52:00] another force. There was another
[1:52:03] something motivating me. Get up.
[1:52:08] Keep going.
[1:52:11] Keep walking. Keep fighting the good
[1:52:14] fight of faith.
[1:52:16] Don't look to the left. Don't look to
[1:52:18] the right. Don't look to the scoffer,
[1:52:20] the critic. Look to him and live.
[1:52:26] [Applause]
[1:52:27] [Music]
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:39] Every promise of God is just as real as
[1:52:42] the day he spoke them.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; It's not a painted fire. It's a reality
[1:52:48] of the living God. If you take God at
[1:52:51] his word, the prophet of God would show
[1:52:54] us, he would show us a great secret to
[1:52:57] faith that if the Lord Jesus was here,
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; he could not heal you.
[1:53:04] He couldn't deliver you.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Because it's already done.
[1:53:13] [Music]
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; You know what he would do? The Lord
[1:53:17] Jesus would point you.
[1:53:22] [Applause]
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Master, will you heal me? What is the
[1:53:27] word saying?
[1:53:30] Oh master, don't leave me in this laya
[1:53:33] of gross darkness to face tribulation.
[1:53:36] What does the word say?
[1:53:39] [Applause]
[1:53:41] Rise and shine for thy light has come.
[1:53:44] The revelation that you can't miss the
[1:53:47] rapture. You won't go in the You won't
[1:53:50] go in tribulation. You're already judged
[1:53:54] by the blood.
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:53:59] [Applause]
[1:54:04] So let me ask you,
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; if you're looking for healing,
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; what does the word say?
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; So are you healed?
[1:54:16] [Applause]
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Is there any sick among us?
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Then what does the word say?
[1:54:24] You're not looking to be healed. You're
[1:54:26] already healed.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Now, let me take it to what the word
[1:54:31] says. He sent his word to heal you. And
[1:54:36] that's not just your physical. That is
[1:54:38] your soul. It's your spirit. It's your
[1:54:41] body.
[1:54:43] Everything is covered in the word.
[1:54:48] [Music]
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Now, that's why we can't just have
[1:54:52] mechanics only. We can't just have the
[1:54:55] fundamentals of the message memorization
[1:54:58] and knowing the quotes. I believe in
[1:55:00] that. I believe in knowing what the
[1:55:02] message says. We got to be grounded in
[1:55:04] the word, grounded in the message. But
[1:55:06] you see, then it's got to take the
[1:55:08] dynamics
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; to make that flesh in you.
[1:55:15] [Music]
[1:55:21] And then in people, a son or a daughter
[1:55:24] of God that can say, "You know what? I
[1:55:26] can look in my past and I see what I
[1:55:27] used to be. I look now and I see what I
[1:55:30] am now."
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; And you know, you've been quickened.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; What it does,
[1:55:38] such a change,
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; such a change in the way we talk, the
[1:55:43] way we think, the way we act. It's
[1:55:46] because we've been quickened.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; It's because we have an understanding. I
[1:55:50] once was this way, but now I'm this way.
[1:55:53] There's been a nature change. What did
[1:55:55] it? It was because God said the
[1:55:56] dynamics.
[1:55:59] [Music]
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; And then you who have been filled with
[1:56:05] the Holy Ghost,
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; what does the prophet of God say? Then
[1:56:09] there's the power of transformation and
[1:56:11] it's just growing. Just keep watering
[1:56:14] it.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Just your h you're priest unto God. Just
[1:56:19] keep watering the word with praise.
[1:56:22] Just keep watering that power, that
[1:56:24] dynamics, that quickening power in your
[1:56:26] life. Just keep watering it. Thank you,
[1:56:29] Jesus. You're the answer. Thank you,
[1:56:31] Lord. You're the same Elohim that
[1:56:33] appeared to Abraham. The same one, amen,
[1:56:36] that appeared to our prophet in this
[1:56:37] day. You're the same one that's in my
[1:56:39] life. You're the same one that changed
[1:56:41] my name from church to Mrs. Jesus
[1:56:44] Christ. Oh, I love you. I thank you,
[1:56:46] Lord. You've never left me. You've never
[1:56:48] forsaken me. You're with me until the
[1:56:50] end of the world.
[1:56:53] Keep watering it. Keep walking in the
[1:56:56] promises of God. Keep under expectation.
[1:56:58] If God did this, he'll do it again. If
[1:57:01] he filled your watch, he'll give you a
[1:57:03] refilling because the dynamics is a
[1:57:06] refilling of the Holy Ghost. And it's
[1:57:08] refilling upon revealing upon revealing.
[1:57:13] [Music]
[1:57:13] [Applause]
[1:57:18] Hallelujah.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; The dynamics is the water
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; upon a hungry heart.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; David said as the heart penth for the
[1:57:30] water brook, so my soul penth for thee,
[1:57:33] oh God. And sometimes a Christian goes
[1:57:36] to the valley of the shadow of death,
[1:57:38] but we're not fearing any evil. But it's
[1:57:41] in that valley of temptation we start
[1:57:44] getting a uh we need a we need a fresh
[1:57:46] drink.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; We got to pull our swords and break
[1:57:50] through some demonic forces and say, "Oh
[1:57:53] God, give me a fresh drink of that
[1:57:55] Pentecostal water. Just give me a
[1:57:56] refilling of the Holy Ghost."
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; I don't care how long you've been in
[1:58:01] this message. We need the Holy Ghost. I
[1:58:04] don't care if it's your first day or if
[1:58:07] you've been here for 60 years. We need
[1:58:10] the Holy Ghost.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, give me a refilling. Give me an
[1:58:17] outpouring of the Holy Ghost. Just pour
[1:58:20] it out. Pour out the rain. Pour out the
[1:58:23] water. Open the windows of heaven. Let
[1:58:26] your doctrine fall like rain. No God.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; You see, you can have electricity
[1:58:41] and know that you got power
[1:58:44] and know that it's a good wire. I'm an
[1:58:46] electrician.
[1:58:48] I know what it is to have a man. You you
[1:58:52] you take you take that wire and you're
[1:58:55] running it through the ceilings and but
[1:58:58] then you know that after you made all of
[1:59:00] the proper connections, the last
[1:59:02] connection you make is to the power
[1:59:04] source.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; You can have all of the connections, you
[1:59:09] can have all of the mechanics,
[1:59:11] but when it's connected to the power
[1:59:13] source,
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; then you know what you do? There is a
[1:59:16] man here that can turn on the light.
[1:59:21] [Applause]
[1:59:26] When you turn on that breaker,
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you call them here,
[1:59:31] but in the United States, we call them
[1:59:32] breaker.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; We we flip that breaker and all of a
[1:59:36] sudden
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; and then you know what you can do? You
[1:59:43] just kind of sit back and look at your
[1:59:45] labor and say, "It is good.
[1:59:50] It's connected to the power source.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet of God says that
[1:59:56] it's just like the little It's just like
[1:59:58] the boy and the girl that went down into
[2:00:00] the cave and went way deep into the
[2:00:03] earth. And then all of the sudden, there
[2:00:05] was a man who turned the power off. And
[2:00:08] the little girl began to scream and cry.
[2:00:10] And but you see, there was a little
[2:00:12] there was a little brother that be to
[2:00:15] that be to cry out to the little sister.
[2:00:18] and say, "Fear not, little sister. There
[2:00:21] is a man here that can turn on the
[2:00:24] light." I know there's been people that
[2:00:27] has tried to say that the man here that
[2:00:29] can turn on the light is William
[2:00:30] Brandham. But you see, William Brandham
[2:00:32] was the brother. And our brother was
[2:00:35] speaking to the bride, the little
[2:00:37] sister, and saying, "Little sister,
[2:00:40] don't fear. There is a mighty God, the
[2:00:44] mighty one among us that's here and he
[2:00:47] can turn on the light.
[2:00:50] He can turn on the light in your
[2:00:51] situation. And I just want to declare,
[2:00:54] rise and shine. Thy light has come.
[2:00:59] There is a man here right now in this
[2:01:03] generation and he's turned the light on.
[2:01:07] Now, what are we looking at?
[2:01:12] We're not looking at defeat. We're
[2:01:14] looking at victory cuz we are his
[2:01:15] victory.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; You see now the prophet of God says what
[2:01:22] he wants is he wants his bride position
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; that his spirit can flow freely.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; The dynamics is here.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; The leadership is here.
[2:01:37] But now he's putting the word
[2:01:40] positionally, the bride positionally in
[2:01:43] the word
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; that you can believe every promise
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; that it's not. Yes, I believe that. I
[2:01:50] believe that. Oh, but I don't know about
[2:01:53] that.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; You see, before there was the break or
[2:01:57] there was fuses.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Y'all know what I'm talking about?
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Fuses. Amen.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; You see, when when as an electrician, I
[2:02:04] would go to an old home and I would go
[2:02:06] to their panel and it's old
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; and it would have fuses and they would
[2:02:13] call me and say, "My fuses are blowing."
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; And I I I I I would actually look down
[2:02:19] and there was a pile of blown fuses.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; You see what they were doing is they put
[2:02:27] the fuse in and it blew. So, they just
[2:02:29] got a new one
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; and they put it in and it blew and they
[2:02:33] thought, "Well, maybe I can put another
[2:02:36] one in and it'll hold this time."
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; So, they put it in, that one blew.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Before long, they just had a pile of
[2:02:42] blown fuses. And they and they said, you
[2:02:45] know, I don't I I can't figure it out.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; So, they called someone to try to tell
[2:02:53] them where the problem is. Amen.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; So then I begin to run the circuit and I
[2:03:00] found out where it's grounded.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it was just a broke wire that
[2:03:06] burnt in maybe a box or electrical
[2:03:09] outlet or something of that nature.
[2:03:11] So once I corrected the splice,
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; put it all together,
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; but the correct union
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; where the word and the bride are one
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; in perfect harmony.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; That the bride is not fussing with the
[2:03:30] groom and the bride's not trying to tell
[2:03:32] the groom how to run his business.
[2:03:37] [Applause]
[2:03:42] But the the the the the splash, the
[2:03:45] union has been corrected and it's right.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Then I go
[2:03:52] take the fuse.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; And it's not blowing.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says that God is
[2:04:03] tired of blown fuses.
[2:04:06] Amen.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Now, he didn't just say, "God's tired of
[2:04:12] blowing fuses and then leave us." He
[2:04:14] sent a prophet to fix it.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; And says, "Get out of those
[2:04:20] denominational ideas."
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; That's why he began to tell us, "We're
[2:04:23] turning a corner.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; We're not just building a wall. We're
[2:04:27] building a building.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; And a building is what is the temple of
[2:04:31] the living God.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; And God has sent me here." This is a
[2:04:35] prophet saying, "God has sent me here to
[2:04:37] build powerhouses.
[2:04:42] He's He sent me here to build up the
[2:04:45] individual, to build you up in the faith
[2:04:48] of the hour."
[2:04:51] [Music]
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Because under those denominational
[2:04:55] teachers, there was blown fuses all the
[2:04:56] time because you didn't know if you
[2:04:58] could believe it or not.
[2:05:01] But now the word has been given to a
[2:05:04] small child,
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; to a mama, to a daddy
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; and they can look for themselves and
[2:05:10] say, "Why I believe that?"
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; You see, the Holy Ghost has been bound
[2:05:17] up,
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; been bound up in traditions and creeds
[2:05:23] and dogmas. Those denominational rivers
[2:05:28] have withheld the Holy Ghost for 2,000
[2:05:30] years.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; But the prophet of God said, "I have
[2:05:34] come
[2:05:36] to break down the barrier
[2:05:39] to loose the Holy Ghost
[2:05:42] because my message has fixed the break.
[2:05:49] My message has been so real that it has
[2:05:53] brought the head, the bridegroom and the
[2:05:56] bride as one union.
[2:06:01] Now let the Holy Ghost flow. Let the
[2:06:05] Holy Ghost move because we believe it.
[2:06:08] We believe the word. We believe it from
[2:06:11] cover to cover.
[2:06:13] We believe it from cover to cover and
[2:06:17] everything in between. It's because the
[2:06:21] connection has been fixed.
[2:06:24] [Applause]
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; But you watch it
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; because if you're hearing the prophet
[2:06:33] say something, but then you know brother
[2:06:36] so and so said it a little bit
[2:06:38] differently, you'll break your
[2:06:39] connection again. That's right.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; That's why the final power to this age
[2:06:45] is the eagle power.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; And you get out of the word for this
[2:06:49] day, it's going to break the connection.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; But God has sent you for this age to
[2:06:55] prove to Satan that we are not like Eve,
[2:06:58] but we are following the headship of the
[2:07:02] word and we believe all of it. And it's
[2:07:05] taken us to the to the perfect Eden
[2:07:08] again.
[2:07:12] You don't have to back up for one
[2:07:13] promise of God.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Abraham refused to look at the deadness
[2:07:18] of his body. Refused to look at the
[2:07:20] circumstance of Sarah. He just kept
[2:07:22] testifying. I'm a son of God. I'm going
[2:07:25] to have that promise. I refused to look
[2:07:27] to the deadness of Sarah's womb. I am
[2:07:30] looking to a promise. I'm looking in the
[2:07:32] mirror. I am a father.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; His testimony. I'm a father. So is the
[2:07:38] testimony of this bride. I am the bride.
[2:07:41] I am pregnant. I am manifesting Christ.
[2:07:47] [Applause]
[2:07:49] Don't look at the deadness of your
[2:07:50] flesh. Don't look at your mistakes. Look
[2:07:54] to the promise.
[2:07:58] Let the blood take care of your flesh.
[2:08:02] I'm not saying live in sin, but it's the
[2:08:05] blood that breaks the stronghold.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; It's his mercy
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; that the quickening power has come to
[2:08:16] break the stronghold of unbelief in our
[2:08:18] life.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet says there is where
[2:08:25] Satan got in to make it all mechanics
[2:08:27] and no dynamics and all dynamics and no
[2:08:30] mechanics. We've got to put it together.
[2:08:32] We've got the power of the Holy Spirit,
[2:08:34] but we've got to come back with the word
[2:08:37] to feed this machine.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; You see, Satan's about to start riding.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; We've had anti antichrist teaching.
[2:08:49] We've had a pope over that teaching.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; But now, Satan's about to be incarnate.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; And it's going to be in the man of sin.
[2:08:58] It's going to be in that pope.
[2:09:00] and he's going to rule the world,
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; but I've got some good news.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; That Jesus Christ is not finished
[2:09:10] writing.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; I I I I I don't want to say anything
[2:09:14] contrary, amen, to to to any ideas, but
[2:09:17] I'm just going to tell you maybe what
[2:09:19] the way I see it
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; is because the prophet of God said,
[2:09:23] "I'll ride this trail again."
[2:09:26] And there's people waiting for brother
[2:09:28] Brandham to raise up from the dead to
[2:09:30] finish that. But I'm just going to say
[2:09:32] this Christ that he introduced us to,
[2:09:35] this word is still riding.
[2:09:38] [Applause]
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; It's riding in bride form.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; This power, this Holy Ghost power, this
[2:09:48] message is riding in bride form.
[2:09:52] The mighty conqueror is in your flesh.
[2:09:56] The dynamics have come to the mechanics.
[2:09:59] The move is on. Something's moving us,
[2:10:04] motivating us, compelling us.
[2:10:08] [Music]
[2:10:13] [Applause]
[2:10:15] They're look they're Satan's going to
[2:10:17] ride. But I'm telling you, the Lord
[2:10:19] himself is riding
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; and he's in your flesh.
[2:10:24] We've turned a corner. It moved from
[2:10:27] just the Holy Ghost, the seven church
[2:10:29] ages, to the Holy Ghost himself. More
[2:10:31] than just a sensation, more than just a
[2:10:33] baptism, more than just a good church
[2:10:35] service. It's Christ stepping into mamas
[2:10:39] and daddy's, boys and girls.
[2:10:42] [Music]
[2:10:42] [Applause]
[2:10:45] [Music]
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Deity is not in heaven. It's in you.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; I am the word. If you want deity in your
[2:10:56] midst, then welcome and receive the
[2:10:59] word.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the rest of that. Don't ever
[2:11:03] let anyone or anything get between you
[2:11:06] and that word.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; I'm closing.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm feeling good.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; I feel like we got the devil on the run
[2:11:22] and
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; and I love giving giving him a good
[2:11:27] whapon.
[2:11:29] Amen. Amen.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; You see, if you want, the prophet of
[2:11:33] God's given you a scripture now. He
[2:11:34] says, if you want to put it down, 1
[2:11:35] Corinthians 4:20,
[2:11:37] the kingdom of God is God's word made
[2:11:40] power.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; What is the kingdom of God is within
[2:11:45] you.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; The kingdom's in you. And when the word
[2:11:49] comes in there, what does this word
[2:11:52] begin? It turns itself into power.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Now catch this. now
[2:12:00] making it say just exactly what it said.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; The word coming into you,
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; the kingdom of God, the word turning
[2:12:13] itself into power. What does that power
[2:12:15] do? It doesn't lead you to go be some
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; the power of the dynamics in you
[2:12:25] gives you the power to take this word
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; and say it again.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; You see the revelation has come to us.
[2:12:37] The voice of God has spoken. The mystery
[2:12:39] is no longer a mystery. It's a clear
[2:12:41] real voice. Amen.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; But then the commission to you little
[2:12:47] bride is go to that angel
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; take the book.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Eat the book
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; because you're going to have to
[2:12:55] prophesy.
[2:12:58] And we're not prophesying anything
[2:13:00] different than that prophet
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; because he Christ the mighty angel
[2:13:08] is now in you
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; speaking exactly what he spoke to that
[2:13:13] prophet.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; And now you're not just
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; just a little housewife that has no
[2:13:20] power, no authority.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; But now the kingdom of God is in you.
[2:13:26] His word made power giving you the
[2:13:28] authority to say the same thing. You
[2:13:31] hear that prophet say you're healed.
[2:13:33] Stand up and say I'm healed. That
[2:13:36] prophet says you are the pure virtuous
[2:13:38] sinless bride of Jesus Christ. Stand up
[2:13:40] and say I am the pure virtuous sinless
[2:13:41] bride of Jesus Christ. The prophet of
[2:13:44] God begins to take us to that perfect
[2:13:46] atonement and say the covenant has come
[2:13:49] back into full effect. The same ministry
[2:13:51] that was in Jesus Christ has come back
[2:13:53] into the perfect word again. And we say
[2:13:56] amen to it.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; If he hit on 16 cylinders, the bride
[2:14:04] will hit on 16 cylinders. She will not
[2:14:08] fall short.
[2:14:11] [Applause]
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; You see, it's turning itself into power,
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; making you say amen to the word,
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; but then it's coming right through your
[2:14:23] mouth.
[2:14:25] Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; You see, I I believe that's where we're
[2:14:30] at.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; I believe that there is sons and
[2:14:34] daughters of God so full of the dynamic
[2:14:36] power of the Holy Ghost. They're saying
[2:14:38] the same thing,
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; believing it, saying it, speaking it,
[2:14:44] testifying of it, just waving that
[2:14:47] promise.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; Just waving that promise. I don't have
[2:14:51] the time to go into it, but the prophet
[2:14:53] of God and the rising of the sun, amen,
[2:14:55] takes us to that to that scripture.
[2:14:58] Amen. That that when the first fruits,
[2:15:00] they're to cut down that first the first
[2:15:02] sheath and wave it before the people.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; You see, you see the prophet of God says
[2:15:08] when you come into the position
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; that I told you,
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; you see the prophet of God is showing,
[2:15:16] I'm telling you something.
[2:15:19] I've been telling you it's coming and
[2:15:21] now it's here
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; and you're coming into the position.
[2:15:26] Then he would take us later and show us
[2:15:29] the position is mechanics and dynamics
[2:15:33] together.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; When you come into that place,
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; then the car begins to move down the
[2:15:47] road.
[2:15:51] The prophet of God said it wasn't
[2:15:52] coming. The prophet of God is saying,
[2:15:53] "I'm telling you. This is what I've been
[2:15:56] showing you.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; I've been telling you about this. And
[2:15:59] now I'm declaring this is my Easter
[2:16:02] message to you.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Mechanics and dynamics are together."
[2:16:08] [Applause]
[2:16:11] [Music]
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God is telling you,
[2:16:15] "There's your position, mama. There's
[2:16:17] your position, daddies. There's your
[2:16:20] position, preachers. There's your
[2:16:22] position, musicians, in that position.
[2:16:26] You are sons and daughters of God that
[2:16:29] have every right
[2:16:32] to stand there shoulders back and say,
[2:16:34] "Satan, you have no part of my life."
[2:16:39] [Applause]
[2:16:46] In that position
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; is where the creative power of the
[2:16:50] spoken word is.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; If God told you to move a mountain or
[2:16:59] whatever, I believe that we would do it.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you right now, this is
[2:17:03] God's spoken word.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; And I know the devil's trying to say
[2:17:07] it's too simple, but I'm telling you,
[2:17:09] it's the truth.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; You have the power. You have are in
[2:17:14] position with mechanics and dynamics to
[2:17:16] take this message and speak it through
[2:17:19] your lips and see God back it.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; See God back your claim.
[2:17:26] [Applause]
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Take some gumption
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; and st and take what the prophet said.
[2:17:34] There's a bride standing to her feet.
[2:17:38] The word is in the bride and she knows
[2:17:41] what to do with it because it's not the
[2:17:43] mind of a man. It's the intelligence of
[2:17:46] God.
[2:17:48] [Music]
[2:17:50] [Applause]
[2:17:51] So many are confused to know what to do
[2:17:53] with it. It's because we're not in the
[2:17:55] message enough. Get in the message and
[2:17:57] you'll know what to do with the word.
[2:18:06] Stay with the word
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; and it makes it power. Jesus Christ the
[2:18:11] same yesterday, today, and forever
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; if you abide in me and my words in you.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; I'm probably over time.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; Let me just
[2:18:26] My goodness.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Let Let me just put it like this.
[2:18:32] I've got so much here, but I I I just
[2:18:36] preached too much.
[2:18:40] There was a there there was a man whose
[2:18:43] car broke down
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; and he took it to a little mechanic
[2:18:48] and that little mechanic combed over
[2:18:51] that car, went through it, checked this,
[2:18:53] checked that, couldn't find the problem.
[2:18:56] Looked like there was nothing wrong with
[2:18:57] that car, couldn't find the problem.
[2:19:00] somehow or another.
[2:19:04] And after a while, he's getting nervous
[2:19:06] and frustrated and and the man is
[2:19:08] saying, "Listen, I need my car or I'm
[2:19:11] late for my my appointment."
[2:19:13] The man says, "Sir, I'm trying the best
[2:19:15] that I can and he's nervous."
[2:19:19] Finally, there was a man
[2:19:23] there was a man that was well-dressed
[2:19:28] came over to him and said, "Sir,
[2:19:31] said, "Can I help you?"
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, yeah, I mean, I guess
[2:19:38] sir, why don't you try this and this and
[2:19:40] this?"
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:19:46] When he tried that,
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; it started right up.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; All it was was just a little connection.
[2:19:57] But there was a man
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; that knew how to fix
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; the connection.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Just a little something
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; to fix that and the and then the spark
[2:20:11] would come back again. The current would
[2:20:13] come back through the automobile.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; The man had sense enough.
[2:20:20] The little mechanic had enough sense to
[2:20:23] say, "Sir, who are you?"
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; You know who he was?
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; He He was the chief designer
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; of of GM, General Motors.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; He designed the thing.
[2:20:39] [Music]
[2:20:41] [Applause]
[2:20:44] There is a man here
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; dressed in the power of his presence.
[2:20:51] [Music]
[2:20:52] [Applause]
[2:20:53] And if there's a blockage in your life,
[2:20:56] maybe you've grown cold, maybe your wick
[2:20:59] has got a little bit of crust on it, but
[2:21:01] there's a man here.
[2:21:04] All you've got to do is be willing to
[2:21:06] trim your lamp. All you've got to be,
[2:21:09] you just need enough sense to say, "Oh,
[2:21:11] God,
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; I believe you're here.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; I know you can fix my problem.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; I know you can bring the current flowing
[2:21:21] through my life.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; I know you can bring revival in my heart
[2:21:25] again."
[2:21:33] You see, the prophet would tell us,
[2:21:34] "Does the does the Baptist know how to
[2:21:37] put the bride and rapturing order?"
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; Or does the Methodist?
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; How about the Pentecostals?
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "He's the
[2:21:48] designer of this bride. He's the
[2:21:50] designer of his word.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; He knows how to put his bride in rapture
[2:21:56] order.
[2:22:02] And the Lord himself
[2:22:05] has come on the scene.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; This bride, can I just say it like this?
[2:22:10] You don't lack for anything.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; When you got the Holy Ghost,
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; healing's in there.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; Victory is in there.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Salvation.
[2:22:28] rapture,
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; adoption,
[2:22:33] [Music]
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; then the prophet of God says, "Then then
[2:22:37] what do I have to do?
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Just keep drinking."
[2:22:46] You see the little seed
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; in that tree that's growing. If he could
[2:22:51] look at that mature oak tree, he would
[2:22:53] look and say, "Well, my, you're so big.
[2:22:56] You're so tall. You're strong." And but
[2:22:59] he would look and say, "Son,
[2:23:01] you'll be me one of these days.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; But all you've got to do is just drink.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about anything. Don't fret
[2:23:10] any about anything. Don't try to work
[2:23:11] something up. Don't try to make it
[2:23:13] happen. Just drink.
[2:23:15] [Music]
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; You hear the prophet preaching. You hear
[2:23:18] your pastor preaching. Something strikes
[2:23:20] your heart. And then you just start
[2:23:22] drinking. Oh, God. Yes, Lord. That's me.
[2:23:25] That's what I want. All of a sudden, the
[2:23:28] prophet begins to speak and conviction
[2:23:29] strikes your heart and you realize that
[2:23:31] you've been doing wrong. You don't have
[2:23:33] to wallow in self-pity. You don't have
[2:23:35] to fall apart and say, "I guess I'm just
[2:23:37] not bride." No. All you do is just say,
[2:23:39] "Oh, God, thank you for revealing that
[2:23:41] to me. Lord, forgive me." And just start
[2:23:44] drinking.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; You've offended a brother, offended a
[2:23:50] sister, go to him, make it right, but
[2:23:52] don't just stay there in regrets and
[2:23:54] hate and bitterness. Just drink and keep
[2:23:57] moving.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; I wonder just if if you could just play
[2:24:05] something
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; just Amen.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe something in your heart the last
[2:24:12] service
[2:24:13] [Music]
[2:24:15] and this this Ohio boy is going home.
[2:24:21] But I I I really have I when brother
[2:24:24] Isaac asked me to come, I I felt just a
[2:24:27] burden to come.
[2:24:32] just talked to your pastor just a few
[2:24:34] moments and found out his heart was for
[2:24:37] for his people and
[2:24:42] [Music]
[2:24:43] to bring healing and
[2:24:46] whatever it is. If you're backsliden
[2:24:49] come then then it then you can come
[2:24:50] back.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; If you're a little cold, you can come
[2:24:54] back.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; If you need a refilling, you can have
[2:24:58] it.
[2:25:02] I hope we've laid enough word in over
[2:25:04] these last two or three days, these last
[2:25:06] three days,
[2:25:08] that there can be a real faith that you
[2:25:10] can just reach out and say, "Yes, Lord."
[2:25:14] Whatever your situation, whatever your
[2:25:15] circumstance, I as I've been preaching,
[2:25:18] I I I I've just seen God just dealing
[2:25:20] with different hearts.
[2:25:22] Maybe you'd like to make this your
[2:25:24] moment.
[2:25:26] Say, "God, just
[2:25:28] whatever it is, if you need healing,
[2:25:33] if you need to repent of something,
[2:25:36] if you just need a refreshing,
[2:25:39] whatever it is, the Lord himself is
[2:25:42] here.
[2:25:44] It It's not a It's not a not a preacher
[2:25:49] up here just spitting and
[2:25:52] acting like a crazy person.
[2:25:57] But if you can just realize who is here
[2:26:00] and look
[2:26:02] cuz what I'm trying to do is point you
[2:26:05] to the one who has the answer for you.
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; He's your answer.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; This word, it's your answer. This
[2:26:15] message, God's proven it's your answer.
[2:26:21] We we can see that that when God came in
[2:26:25] the book of I believe first Kings and he
[2:26:28] asked is there no physician?
[2:26:30] If there is then why is the daughter of
[2:26:33] my people sick?
[2:26:36] Brother Brandham would show us and say
[2:26:38] we've got the answer.
[2:26:40] We've got the cure for sin.
[2:26:43] We've got the way back.
[2:26:47] We've got everything that we have need
[2:26:49] of. The atonement is in full effect.
[2:26:52] Would you like to just take a few
[2:26:54] moments and just bow your head? Even if
[2:26:56] there's someone that just wants to come
[2:26:58] up for prayer, you're welcome to,
[2:27:01] but just take a few moments and just
[2:27:03] say, "Lord, would you help me?
[2:27:08] I believe that you're revealing yourself
[2:27:10] in mercy right now.
[2:27:13] And Lord, I I'm exposed in your
[2:27:15] presence.
[2:27:17] Lord, would you come and heal me?
[2:27:21] Would you come and change my life? Would
[2:27:23] you come and move in my situation? God
[2:27:26] will do it. God's merciful. God loves
[2:27:28] you. He cares.
[2:27:31] Lord Jesus, you see your children.
[2:27:34] You see the hearts they're laying
[2:27:37] exposed before you right now.
[2:27:40] I pray, Father, that you would minister
[2:27:43] to them, Lord.
[2:27:45] God rich in mercy,
[2:27:49] we would be just like the world.
[2:27:52] We We would be doomed for hell. We would
[2:27:55] be in gross darkness. We would be in
[2:27:57] confusion. We would be so overwhelmed.
[2:28:02] But God, rich in mercy.
[2:28:06] You said this is a mansized job and you
[2:28:10] come right into the fiery furnace with
[2:28:11] us. It's you who is keeping us. It's you
[2:28:15] who is protecting us. It's you who is
[2:28:19] saying, "Satan, you've went far enough.
[2:28:21] You can't go any longer. You can't go
[2:28:23] any further." Oh, God. Rich and mercy.
[2:28:28] Bless everyone, Lord.
[2:28:31] Bless their hearts, Father. Give them
[2:28:34] strength and encouragement, Father.
[2:28:37] Lord, we're looking for your soon
[2:28:38] return. We believe that any day now,
[2:28:41] Lord, that we're going to change from
[2:28:44] this old temporal body, we're going to
[2:28:47] put this old pest house aside and we're
[2:28:49] going to step into that immortal body.
[2:28:53] Lord, we don't know how many more
[2:28:55] battles we've got to face.
[2:28:57] But Lord, as long as we're facing them
[2:28:59] with you, we know we can never be
[2:29:02] defeated.
[2:29:04] We know there's not enough nervous
[2:29:06] devils to keep us down.
[2:29:08] There's not enough oppression to keep us
[2:29:11] down.
[2:29:13] There's not enough
[2:29:16] sin and unbelief in the world that can
[2:29:19] hold this bride back. And it's not
[2:29:22] because of us. It's because you're here
[2:29:26] watching over us. You swore with an oath
[2:29:31] that you would not leave us, not forsake
[2:29:34] us, but you would be with us, even in
[2:29:36] us. and you would manifest yourself to
[2:29:39] us. Bless your children in the name of
[2:29:43] Jesus Christ.
[2:29:45] Amen and amen. Hallelujah.
[2:29:50] Power
[2:29:52] break every chain.
[2:29:54] Break every chain.
[2:29:59] There is power
[2:30:02] in the name of Jesus.
[2:30:08] There is power
[2:30:11] in the name of Jesus.
[2:30:15] Oh,
[2:30:17] there is power
[2:30:20] in the name of Jesus.
[2:30:25] Oh, to break every chain. Break every
[2:30:29] chain. Break every chain.
[2:30:34] to break every chain. Break every chain.
[2:30:39] Break every chain. Keep playing softly.
[2:30:44] Oh, the altar is open this evening. If
[2:30:47] you want to become prayed for, oh, the
[2:30:51] anointing is here. We feel the power of
[2:30:53] God moving in the building tonight. If
[2:30:56] you want to be touched by the angel
[2:30:58] tonight, he's moving. Oh, if you want to
[2:31:00] be touched by the pillar of fire
[2:31:02] tonight, he's moving. If you want to be
[2:31:04] anointed, you don't have to leave here
[2:31:06] the same way. No, no. You can be filled.
[2:31:09] You can be healed. You can be delivered.
[2:31:11] You can be restored. You can be free.
[2:31:14] There is a power in this place tonight
[2:31:16] to do what only he can do tonight. He
[2:31:20] can touch. He can deliver. Oh, if you
[2:31:22] feel that tug on your heart, if you feel
[2:31:24] that call in your spirit, why don't you
[2:31:26] make your way forward tonight? Uh oh.
[2:31:29] Hallelujah. It's now or never. Oh, why
