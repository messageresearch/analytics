thank you for that god bless you and amir and i we have been a long road but uh we are certainly enjoying the lord and enjoying the the blessings of of being partners one with the other and we certainly want to give god praise for spaying all eyes and blessing us to see what we see and it's a true ending for me i love the lord i love my wife we still in love and we are grateful to god we are happy i remember years ago when i hear different brothers talking about their 31 years married 25 say whoo you know and that was a whole big thing to us and now uh she told me yeah we're looking forward for 50. so we've got terry's coming we're heading down that road and um it's a joy it's a joy uh the greatest thing is is really uh serving the lord get that call and put in god first and seeing god hand upon your life upon the years you look back and see you know that because of your stand for christ christ stands by you and stands for you and i want to encourage each one of you it is worth it all it's good as well you know like the scriptures say what shall they prophet a man if he give again the whole world and lose his soul to what shall a man give for his soul in exchange for his soul so we are grateful to god tonight and tonight we also want to announce that this is our final zoom meeting for this year um we're looking forward for next year uh i want to have maybe a prayer meeting on the 9th of january and our first bible study in the 12th so just to let you know um we have our convention coming up our uh virtual convention from ghana that will be next week and you know we will see how things go we have to work on it and prepare for it and just be us up in prayer uh it's really a powerful time we're in and um tonight i want to share something with you and we have a special guest guest speaker tonight or or somebody to share something special for us tonight and uh i hope you'll be blessed and inspired by it but before he comes i want to read a scripture and that scripture is found in numbers chapter 13 chapter of numbers one verse the titu at first if you have your bibles you can turn to it numbers 13th chapter 30 verses said and caleb still the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it and something struck me and i i find it just something worth sharing and talking about and last week the bible study was about planning god is the god of planning and order the first day second day to the day fifth day sixth day and were arrested he said what about order he orders things you want our steps to be ordered planning is is the way of life to execute uh what we need to get done and i'm thinking about how planning have a lot to do with decisions the power of decisions not so much the feelings but decisions and as christians we tend to go a lot by feelings by emotions by dreams by you know you're looking for the anointing and whatnot and it struck me that the anointing is not coming into your house to sweep your flow your anointing is not coming in your house to wash your wares your anointing of the coming house for you to paint like not every company and any on the back on it outside the house gonna change color it's not unless you're in magic or something like that it's not happening god give them the land and dear responsibility was to possess it and i realized that people could sit back relax rock back looking for the spirit looking for um whatever to do things that they are empowered to do by the power of decision and the power of will and it was an astonishing thing to look and see that caleb after spending time with grapes and everything else in the land with these other 12 guys could come back and see them in such a depressed and terrible mood that he could say let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it i think that that was not feelings he wasn't feeling he was seeing let us go up at one at once as a decision conscious of one thing for sure god said so and i want you to think about that tonight about you making a decision to obey god you're making a decision to do what is right and sticking back not saying i am weak and i'm weak and i'm waiting for strength i need strength no when are you going to decide to walk away from what you're supposed to walk away from when are you going to decide to take stock of your life because when your life in shambles i know i said shambles you know there is no order there is no structure there is no vision and as a church uh where god brought us from to where we are this journey hasn't been an uh unstructured journey it's a structure that god works with in egypt he has to get them to the promised land there's an order of how he's going to do that when moses died he wanted it to continue he said now moses my servant is dead now joshua you take the people over every place you put your foot is yours and so on there was a structure there was an order when i beat you to shout shout don't mess with the garments don't mess with the the goal i will burn it have nothing to do with it i'll be with you there is always a certain order with god kill the americans hitting jebusites when they small take them out because they will get big and they're going to put pressure on you so deal with them and this is what i want to get with you tonight but ivan says that when this battleground this this mind this this battleground was chosen god choose the bachelor was chosen was the mind human mind and here's why he says the human mind was chosen for the place of battle where it was to begin that is because decisions are made from the mind ahead so if you make a decision to pray every day that's a decision and you begin to act by will on that decision then there's nothing could stop you from praying you know because that's your choice just as you choose to go into supermarket or you choose to do this so i choose to do that you could choose to do certain things like you choose to be here it's not a spirit sweep you up and and you say well um oh i'm feeling like i'm gonna be in in bible study tonight no it's not that you made a choice i want to hear i want to receive i want to learn i want to grow i want to understand because remember we are not born in obedience we are not born with the mind of god or intelligence of god we are not born uh uh are we alone of him because he said learn of me this is what god brought the child of israel out of egypt for to learn of him this god that demonstrated in supernatural power how much power he gonna demonstrate again if they don't know his will and his word if they don't know what will please him what will offend them what will upset him the hardest to get the word so for now because faith was locked up he gave them laws and that law thou shalt not though shalt not no sharpness behave yourself your mother all of that was just what laws because he himself his blessings has an order with it he cannot break his own law he can't break his own word he told adam and eve the day you get there of that day you die so therefore god had things set up in a certain way and that plan is about to be executed no because decisions are made in the mind you have to understand the difference between waiting on the anointing and you have things to do you know it come like um as pastor you deal with different people different individuals and sometimes you give guidance and people outrightly reject the guidance i can't do that i'm not doing that they're not doing that but in service they feel annoying and they're all excited about the anointing they're all excited about the inspiration that's fine but after the anointing after the inspiration are you falling through in obedience into god's order of things this is where it is important to understand the power of planning the power of planning means that there's a structure in front of you like a vision and that structure is what you're asking god to help you guide you to set up that structure or that order or that plan and then you begin to follow a plan now if the plan going off key god could show you know not this way not this way not this way not this way and bring guidance but if there's no plan how we can fulfill it there is no plan there's no ambition there is no goal there is no zeal there is no target they have to have a target and i remember somebody asking but the brand i'm thinking was brother perry green or one of them was asking him something about if this is will of god if it's the will of god is will of god and the answer to that was do whatever in your heart and if it's going off track god will let me just to tell you when something like that and friends i believe the hour has come for some crucial decisions to be made decisions not feelings decisions joseph made a conscious decision not to fool along with bautista's wife he had every opportunity to do that and he made a choice he ran for his life he could have stand up like a man and and play games and whatnot but he choose to run it was a choice he did not want to displease god he wanted to kept him keep himself and he wants you to keep the world that choice and decision that he made land him in prison but guess what this is where god wanted him because god wanted to meet the butler and the beaker and god wanted him to be in position for the next blessing for the next session because he was going to bring up all the vision and explain the vision of years of plenty and years of famine and that is why fear could say you know what joseph we need somebody who could manage this vision we need somebody who could deal with the challenges that is yet before us and i want you to do it because you interpreted the vision you're going to have plenty are we going to have fun when you have plenty how do you store how do you plan when you have plenty because some people they when they have some some little thing i wouldn't call it plenty they spend and they operate like if it will never finish now joseph was put in a position to execute this program for pharaoh and it did a tremendous job each one of you here tonight god has blessed you if he hasn't blessed you yet in that position he will bless you in a position to see what you will do and how you will do it you say i don't have plenty well let's see how you could manage little because the bible declares he who is faithful and liberal will be faithful and much yeah some people they can't man in a hundred dollars but hoping for ten thousand dollars and the hundred dollars is given just to see how you would manage that your attitude towards that so tonight uh uh we want uh the uh get a special blessing tonight because we believe we have scripture support for prudent financial management and i want to invite uh brother andrew ovid who he worked in a bank he has been wrong in seals and everything else and i am inviting him to share something with us tonight concerning uh if i could call it prudent financial management i know it wouldn't be it cannot be a detailed session as as we would like but sometime in future maybe we're going to have something in more detail but at least this is a start isaac started last week sharing about planning how god wanted to be in planning and you know i remember amber shea knows it like we have a plan that we drop i a number of years ago in addition to the church that we have right now already drawn and i thought even we wouldn't even let the believers know about that we have no money to deal with that but guess what we have a plan i love planning i like to see a plan planning you do have to have money to have a plan a plan is a thought an idea that is written down that is structured that if things work out you could execute because what if you do get money you look at the funds you do get what you need and you have zero plan so i'm saying you are empowered by being a son of god in the image of god to have plans i have thoughts because god he had thoughts and he wanted to express these thoughts he wanted to manifest the plan and he taught them his mind and he did that so tonight i want to invite brother andrew and he's going to come on now and share some things with us hi good night to all and and god bless you i trust that what i share would be a blessing to you all um and definitely definitely i think that um the time of the year is is a good time for us to be able to chat a little bit about it and um definitely i have some scriptures put aside here that will be a blessing to us all and [Music] um well i'll just get started right so um it is christmas time and it's a time that's very dear to all of us but it's also a time where persons basically i'm like i like to say they come out like wild ants out of a nurse right you only i'm like the only thing that has changed is that they're wearing masks right now but the spending the spending that is going on i mean it baffles me right so just before i go into the scriptures i just want to touch a little bit about spending right because um there are there are a lot of um i'm like habits that we we could gain from the bible that actually helps us with prudent financial planning as as it goes along there were actually many many um many passages in the bible where there's there's been talks of men of great substance and gold and silver and cattle and wealth throughout the bible man of god um and i've been in some chats with some christians and sometimes it's it's a it's a tug of war it's a pull and a push because they sometimes believe that um christians not supposed to be not supposed to have right and well of course some people have their own i'm like ideas of it i'm like of it but there's definitely scripture right so i want to just start with one here which is proverbs 3 proverbs 3 um verse 9 and it's it says honor the lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of thine increase so shall thy bands be filled with plenty and thy presses shall boost out with new wine right so only spending for christmas it um it really does baffle me how persons make decisions the way that they do because sometimes you will see something it may be on sale and so on and stuff like that no i'm i'm in the business of sales so i know the impact that this could have on somebody psychologically and so on and stuff like that but when i when i am chatting with my team and so on and stuff like that these stories do come out so you saw something you were never gonna buy it in the first place right you were never gonna buy it in the first place however though it's on sale it's 20 percent off it's 50 off according to what it is that they put out there you're saving yourself 500 but the catches you don't know that you have um to spend twenty five hundred dollars to get at five hundred dollars in savings now if it is that you look at it you were never gonna spend it in the first place and most persons don't actually process that so when they think that they're saving five hundred dollars they could have been saving twenty five hundred dollars because it's something that we're never gonna buy in the first place right so these are things and choices that we need to think about because just like we spoke about joseph and we spoke about the the seven years of plenty and seven years of famine i i believe as well that you never know when it is that you're in the times of famine until until the famine hits which means that you need to be stowing up grain so who it is that is throwing up grain for january and june and for next year december who it is at the store and upgrading for the future and we need to be able to think because i'm like brother branham taught us to live like he's coming tomorrow but plan like he's coming next 20 years right the bible also says that a good man leaves her leaves her inheritance for his children's children right so this basically speaks about generational wealth so it speaks about us putting aside something for unlike for the future now many of us have some challenges some challenges putting aside for the present so we need to be able to take to take counsel and guidance right basically the the session that we had the bible study that we had last week was really a good platform on planning right because it spoke about console it spoke about it spoke about wisdom and spoke about keeping god in your plans and i believe that there are some scriptures that we sometimes we miss some um some things and and it's only when it is that we read it and we look at it we're like wow right these things these things are really significant to the way that things go on presently right so um i want to just touch a little bit of scriptures in proverbs right so first i want to go to proverbs 13 11. so if it is that you could find it with me so proverbs 13 11 right it goes wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished but he that gathered by labor shall shall increase right and in the english standard version it goes wealth gain hastily will dwindle but whoever gathers little by little will increase it right and i believe that that scripture is really really significant it's really significant to me because um as growing up sometimes you want to be able to put aside for the future and the way the way that i used to get paid was daily so you have to little by little inch up otherwise you're gonna you're gonna practically end up like with nothing right so if it is that you don't know how to put aside something little by little you're going to end up with nothing right so it goes well gain hastily will dwindle but whoever gathers little by little will increase it will increase wealth right so pretty much we we spoke about a diligent a diligent um approach or a diligent hand will will reap like the abundance and also luke 16 10 speaks about he that is faithful and little will be faithful and much right so basically the formula is that little by little right now keep in mind that what is happening out there right now all these christmas sales and christmas promotions and so on and stuff like that and the way that the consumerism works in this world right everybody's actually trying to gain money little by little so they are happy nobody's nobody's doing anything nobody's selling i'm like anything out there at a loss right everybody's trying to actually gain for their business little by little so whether whether they drop the price to twenty dollars to ten dollars to five dollars they actually they actually have that as part of their revenue stream as part of their revenue strategy and you have to know what is your plan to begin to reserve your to begin to stop your green you have to know what's your plan to begin to budget so we're going to touch into budgeting in a little bit right but i just want to touch on another scripture here which i believe that we are familiar with in proverbs right so proverbs 6 verse 6 it says go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise which having no guide over say or ruler provided her meat in the summer and gathered her food in the harvest right so pretty much what it also says is that hard work and putting aside putting aside basically little by little you need to be conscious of how it is that you plan for the future and basically some of the some of the generation that is out there they they act like if it is that money never dries up like if it's it's if it's an open pipe and it's all and it's always going to be flowing right and we need to be conscious of of of the need for stoner brain because there's also the story of the good um samaritan which is a story that's very dear to me because in in my heart i want to be i want to be in a position that i could give right so we don't know if the ones the ones that would have passed before yes yes it may have been certain challenges but did they have that um like did they have substance that they could give and we want to be in a position that we could we could give so um so there's also something that i want to speak about because of course well man you may know that i've been in banking right and um there's a lot of questions that have a lot to say about banking and there um there's actually script here to support a lot of stuff that goes on in banking right so for example let me just touch on this here real quickly right and proverbs 22 7 right so let me just get it here in this version very quickly so proverbs 22 7 it goes the rich roulette over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender right so and i know that a lot of successful persons right they actually believe in one major principle rule this the they subscribe to is don't over spend your income right or don't spend before you get your income right and those are things that we need to pay attention to because and this will everything is behind a behind a mask meaning that you don't you don't actually know what it's going on until until they're in it right because they make things look so appealing they make things look like i mean the bank really really does appear to be your friend and they want to help you to achieve your dream and whatnot and stuff like that but behind it they are in it to literally make money they are in it to make money off of money so i mean the bank is just printing money right but we don't want to go too much into that right but there's there's a really really nice scripture that i want to go to right so it says the thoughts in this is proverbs 21 verse 5 the thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness but ev but of everyone that is he is the only one right so it so it guides us to not be hasty in life and pretty much well i mentioned that scripture before wealthy and hastily will dwindle but whoever gathers little by little will will increase it right so little by little is really really the formula right um just to touch on a lot of what it is that we deem as success and i mean i read up a lot of um a lot about millionaires right i read up a lot about it because i actually believe well a lot of the principles that they tap into are right here in the bible as well they are pretty much biblical right so when i do read about the millionaires right there's some percentages and there's some stats that stand out to me and one is that 80 of them actually start off at zero right they actually start off from nothing so they don't they don't start off with a million dollars to become a millionaire they actually start off with nothing right so in my studies it's got it's it's basically guided me to see how christians can make progress little by little and pretty much the hastiness um like the hastiness of the young generation that we have that's always looking for quick and for also something fast we know that that's not gonna last because the script just spoke about it right um and in studying that in studying like you're wealthy and the decisions that they make you're gonna see some differences and we need we need to begin to process these things logically now because of because i've been all around the country and travel and so on and stuff have have you ever noticed um that in some of the places that we're familiar with well i'm not sure if if it is that we are familiar with it but in like um valsein and lunch park and palmies and gulf view there's there's absolutely no luxury boots there's no lotto boots have we ever had i'm like have we ever thought about it i know that we do we don't play la tour and we do gamble and so on and stuff like that but it's still something for us to think about i know right i know i know that i know that we don't really think about it like that but seriously if it is that you drive through val say you know you try you drive through gulf view or you drive through lunch park you're not going to see any lots of woods right now i i actually believe if it is that these wealthy persons believe that that system with that system of getting rich quick or that lottery system if it is that they believe that it used to work they could afford to spend money on thousands of tickets they could pay people to stand up in line to increase the line they could make those things profitable but i think that they don't believe that it worked so that's why in those places where it is that we consider like the wealthy live there's no luxury boots however do like i said i've been i've been around the country between between um pinto and santa rosa there's about there's about five between mover junction and about five minutes in there's about 10. right um there's a village right off of maracas right off of maracas beach i was stunned and i was shocked there's a lot of boot in the heart of it i went as fast bish just last week the hub they tell me go down by the hub that is where it's busy right it's a lot of buddha right there adi hub right which which gets me to thinking when it is that i read these scriptures i'm like the millennials or the younger generation they don't they don't understand the concept of putting aside little by little they understand the concept of i'm gonna try a thing here in haste i'm gonna move quickly i'm gonna try something quick right so i i have never heard persons saying that they've gotten rich because of doing certain things or or that their wealth has got has come from doing certain things basically right i've never heard i've never heard somebody say that the turning point in their life was when it is that they were able to play that lot to money mark and whatnot and stuff like that in fact i've heard a story about a guy like from lav until that one year later he was absolutely flat out broke again from winning igato which which is which is lightning basically struck him coming out of the water on a on a rainy day on the beach that is that is what when any lotto is like pretty much right but we need to understand where it is that descriptors lead us into planning into into making prudent decisions until little by little we could put aside certain things right so i'm actually going to touch on this really quickly one of the number one reasons or one of the number one things that actually hinder young persons today is actually loans is actually credit facilities right so we actually have a lot of young persons who spend money before they have it and we know we know that um we live in our social society meaning meaning that we live in society so we love to be social and we value feedback and it's one of the things that i'm glad that we could have these bible studies because we we we're all in the same zone we're all in the same room we could communicate and we could we could be able to feed off of certain thoughts but the truth is that we value feedback we value feedback so much that you want to ask like your neighbor what they think about what do you think about the new lights that you know put up what do you think about the new color that you that you're that you paint your house what do you think about the car that you're now pull up in right on support and support and we value this feedback and it actually drives us to make impulsive decisions because we wonder basically the points that we come into life we want to show everybody the success or way it is that we've we've arrived at or we wanna we wanna achieve certain things in a shorter time frame and basically society right now forces young persons forces persons to basically play that game as in you see somebody now start working their first year and by time by time the second year you know that they're driving a brand new car right by time the second year they're driving a brand new car they have a credit card they're talking about vacation loan and so on and so on and stuff like that but they haven't done the basics so the basics is what i call um well we we we talk about it i don't know if it is that um that has been discussed and fine-tuned but basically the basics is one is that you have to have what you call a rainy day fund right so i don't know how much persons know the concept of a rainy day fund right so a rainy day fund is the first among that you could put aside so whether a thousand dollars two thousand dollars right that is for a rainy day that you had a really really bad day and you were able to hit a pothole that were able to blow two tires at the same time right and that you could you could actually handle the expense from that from your rainy day fund so something pops up we know stuff always pops up in life and we want to be prepared for it right so one is that you have a rainy day fund now this is for when something pops up now after that ring day fun then we are talking about i don't know if it is that you ever heard prisons mention you need to have six to eight months living living expenses put aside or six to eight months salary put aside right so if it is that you need to transition from job to job right so actually that there is is a foundation for what for what is still the financial piece which means that you don't want to be real and you don't want to do something that you that you don't want to do right so basically um i believe that that everybody has an opportunity to have financial peace when they start off right but the decisions that we make right it comes like we are running a hundred meters race but the decisions and the choices that we make tend to verse left and right so we so we need to understand what are the impact of those decisions as we plan so for example if it is that you started working and you were able to to have that rainy day fun in place and you put aside some funds right and then you were able to have six to eight months living expenses for just in case that you need to transition just in case that's something else i'm like happiness no that is not that is not a savings that is emergency right after those things then your savings begin so when it is that persons are saving now now the young people now have a concept of saving now they would save six thousand dollars and then black friday sale it's a six thousand dollar tv that they purchase that is that is not a concept of saving because it's almost better that you didn't save because the money the money is disappeared anyway right and then and then you're back at square one so what it is that you want to have is you want to store upgrade so that just in case because we don't know what we don't know what 20 21 holes we don't know what 20 22 holes we don't even know some of us are not thinking about january meaning that when when you see them running like violence in their mass making purchases buy any stuff for their house putting up lights on me and splashing paint and so on and stuff like that i mean it's crazy it's really really crazy i try to just stay stay far from it right because i i get kind of claustrophobic with the among the persons that are on the streets right now um right so but the thing is when it is that you process it some of these persons in the moment they are not considered in january they are not considered in january any moment right i i i speak to young persons persons who have goals and ambitions and yes they work very hard but these young persons right now they're talking about four thousand dollar phone six thousand dollar phone now mind you i i deal with some of these young persons right now they send in call me requests from these six thousand dollars soon meaning that they don't even have money on these phones which is ridiculous so we need to know we need to know what what expenses are actually worthwhile is it does it does it make sense right so when it is that we look at the impulsive nature like i don't know if it is that you all are conscious of it but the government would have announced the removal of the tax concession on motor vehicles for january and what has happened i mean i never thought that i would see it but but there's a there's a popular roland rule of company by me and the lots are being emptied and filled and emptied and filled and cars are just disappearing off of the lut so listen to the logic that is happening here right process the logic that is happening i'm seeing persons with perfectly good cars right meaning that i just saw somebody who has who bought a brand new car they have that car about two years now so she has a brand new car but because the car that she likes is gonna be thirty thousand dollars more next year she spends fifty thousand dollars on another car that she doesn't need because she already has a brand new car and these decisions are what actually push us further away from being financially secure from from having financial peace like i call it or from being able to stop enough brain that when it is at your neighbor come and they ask you for something you have something that you could extend that you could lend that you could give but right now we actually have a pandemic of persons not making logical decisions but russian to make purchases because they believe that they are saving something when it is that if it is that you think about it you were never gonna spend that money in the first place you were never gonna buy a car in the first place the car only began to appeal to you when it is that you realize it's gonna be more money next year but supposing next year you are able to save a million dollars or your business yields your million dollars you could have any car that you want you could you could make decisions like you want them or if it is that you have things put aside but you can't be paying a loan on one car and because another another something appeals to you that you're rushing by it so for example um uh i'm like a colleague of mine told me there was a two thousand dollar pot set right they dropped the price of fifteen hundred dollars after she finished work she rushed home to get fifteen hundred dollars to buy the pot set she's upset right now because a month has passed and he puts it still in a box right but these are the decisions any choices that we're not thinking about because you're saving 500 but you're spending 1500 right fifteen hundred dollars that you were never gonna spend in the first place so when it is that you're able to think a little bit more logically about your choices and this is why it is that you need to be conscious of stone up green um i just want to talk to you really quick about budgeting right because budgeting is something that we that we may not know or we may not speak about but but budgeting helps us to keep in line right so when it is that you do have so for example your salary comes in your salary is a one-liner right your salary comes in then what now comes out you have probably about 20 lines of different things that comes out and then and then at the bottom which has like the equal sign for some persons there's a big zero there at the end of the month right so we need to understand the plan that budgeting plays and how it is that we can learn to budget so for example there's a saying that the wealthy persons they basically pay themselves with or they are able to put aside or they are able to save us so for example on my budget or on my list you will see one on number one and number two and number three and then all the rest could come like in order in terms of relevance after that right but we have persons making meaning that i am seeing it like actively every day there are persons making decisions and then not understanding meaning that they are persons making decisions doing purchases and then they don't have money enough money to travel to work they don't have enough money to buy lunch while it is that they're at work because they have budgeted poorly right so we spoke about the rainy day fund and and basically like emergency fund right your rainy day fund is basically topped up when it is at your salary coming so just in case that something does pop up right and two two tires boost at the same time or your glasses break and you need to dip into the rainy day fund then that's topped up when it is that your salary comes in because what you don't want to do is you don't want to be reeling from different things that happen and basically disturbing your budget so what i have the first line should be should be um third in charity and like offering then you should have like savings mapped out so you have your savings so you could have a savings line as as early as you suck line should be a savings so if you want to save 500 or you want to save 100 it should actually be taken out and put aside what it is that we tend to try to do is we tend to we tend to pay pay bills here do this here do this here i want to do this and when it is that we don't know we're trying to save what's left which is normally zero so you have to understand if it is that you want to save you need to be able to do it in an upfront manner because because it's not easy it's not going to happen by itself it's not going to translate into savings by itself right so you need to be able to plan that out and you need to put aside some of your savings first now of course stuff do pop up but when it is that you do that with the with the type of i'm like intent that you have you will realize that you're able to make progress because some persons could add up time now time and money is valuable right some places could add up the amount of time and they could say well if it is that i had saved twenty dollars for every month that i've worked i would actually have a bigger savings fund than what it is that i have presently right and the reason that you have situations like that is because police are not able to put aside their savings or what they believe is savings is not savings because it's not savings when it is that you put aside money and then it's spent on something else that is not a savings right that is that is something that you are saving for but it's not part of your savings right so we need to be able to understand that right so the last thing that i wanted to start so i want to basically wrap up here by just touching a little bit about um proverbs six right so proverbs six we we spoke about go to the ant consider hallways and be wise but i want to start from proverbs six verse one it says my son if thou be surety for thy friend or thou has stricken that in hand with a stranger all right i wanna skip to verse three do this now my son and deliver thyself when thou had come into the hand of thy friend go humble thyself and make sure thy friend right so basically um the old you old english like for surety just in case that you're not aware is for going into debt right so it's in my son if thou be surety for thy friend or if thou has stricken thine hand with a stranger so for example a stranger could mean the bank so going into debt with a bank so the bible is actually telling you what you can do it's saying do this now so verse 4 it says give not sleep to thine eyes nor slumber to thine eyelids right so it's a lot of jargon there right or or it appears to be complex give not sleep to thine eyes nor slumber terrain to thine eyelids so basically what this says is hard work you can go and relax yourself and sleep if it is that you know that you're in debt basically so for example we know in trinidad that we have cases of it you'll lend somebody money and so on and it taken ages to pay you back and then you see them up the road eating an ice cream cone on a friday night after they eat some hot dog and burger and so on and stuff like that and you're like when am i gonna get it right so what it's saying here is for give not sleep to thine thing eyes nor slumber to thine eyelids right and then verse five it goes deliver thyself as a row from the hand of the hunter and as a bird from the hand of the fowler right so it says deliver thyself as a rule from the hand of the hunter and from the and as a bird from the hand of the fowler right so basically what it's saying now i don't know if it is that that you may have seen um i'm like an animal channel sometimes but sometimes they have these these gazelles and these days and whatnot and stuff like that and you know that they're not just videotaping just please i'm like to say normally they plan those things because they know that they are predators very close that are looking to hunt and anytime that there's a day even when it is that you see it in movies and stuff like that you hear a little crackle and there the head basically goes up and they already in sprint mode they're already looking to get out of whatever circumstance that's coming their way because they not show um what is going on right so it says deliver thyself as a role from the hand of the hunter and has a bullet from the hand of the fowler so what happens is as soon as he bear or whatever creature hears the noise they basically speed off they basically begin to run for their life because they know that their life may be in jeopardy so what this is saying here in proverbs is if it is that you are gone into debt now it's not it's not saying that um that you shouldn't there there are cases this this generation actually does have it tough there are decisions that you need to make and sometimes you may need to right but what it's saying is if it is that you would have wandered into debt so just in case that you made a mistake and you get caught because they say that you could win a flat screen tv when it is that you sign up for this fifty thousand dollar loan and they say that you can get a free t-shirt when it is a you take a twenty thousand dollar vacation loan and they say that you have a chance to win a uh uh um ipad when it is that you sign up for this credit card and so forth and so forth and so forth what it's actually saying here is even if it is that you wandered into that you should be running out as fast as you can right you should be running out as fast as you can right so basically that is that is why it is that you that it banks pretty much they try to prevent you and whatnot and stuff no they are necessary stuff i mean it's it's hard for you to own a home right now with all the banks but there are other things that you need to be able to plan for and in fact the number one thing right the number one thing that actually affects young people today i could tell you is that as soon as they begin working after one year or two years they are they going to take out a brand new car right so i'm just going to touch on how this works really really quickly right so i know the mats in my head because i normally work it out i normally calculated so a 200 000 car right actually at the interest rates that are present would work out to about 264 000 when it is that you go over the spread of these seven years right but just for numbers sake just to keep it easy for us here let's just use 250. so a 200 thousand dollar car which is brand new and and just be mindful right the the reason that the bank could afford to give zero percent done on a car is because they know that it's a safe bet they know that it's really really safe for them to be able to grant you a car and sign on the loan i mean like they have like the insurances in place they basically mapped out the plan in place they they know what it is that they are doing right somebody who takes out a car they are sure to pay for it right like the only thing that has a lower unlike interest rate than a car is is house online basically right so akai is a safe bet for the bank so they could afford to do zero percent financing which gives the opportunity for a lot of young persons who have not won had like a rainy day fund or have like the emergency fund they are now able to qualify and sign up for this brand new car i'm like in essence they are spending future money money that they haven't had as yet they are booking themselves up for the future in the process so you spend two hundred thousand it's a two hundred thousand dollar car you're spending two hundred and fifty thousand dollars over seven years but at the end of the seven years it's now worth a hundred thousand dollars resale value so that's a hundred and fifty thousand dollars that's that's automatically lost because of the value of the car because of them depreciation right now some persons will say that hey i could live with that because it's the convenience of a car and so on and so on and stuff like that but there are still stuff that they are not seeing right so just like um just like in proverbs as well they say um who would build a tower not commonly cost right so for example persons don't calculate the unlike insurance 37 years they don't calculate tires over seven years they don't calculate like the upgrading rims that they want to get the upgrade any any song system that they want to do the extra tint that they want to change after three years they don't they don't consider how much gas that is gonna cost them over the lifetime of these seven years yes gas is going to be there i'm like whether it's our old car or nuka but considering you spend 250 000 for a 200 000 car you get back a hundred thousand right you're thinking that hey at least i got back something right but you're still not calculating that there's a lot of factors still so so in essence this is why it's such a setback and we don't know it because it's easy for money to disappear that way not just like the depreciation of the car but it's easy for you to have spent another hundred and fifty thousand dollars because if it is that i run running mats very very simple on on gas and i say it's 500 a week five by four that's two thousand two thousand by twelve uh that's twenty four thousand twenty four thousand by seven that's a hundred and sixty eight thousand so just in gas alone you basically wiped away like the extra hundred thousand that you believe that you're getting back right but it's get it gets better than that remember that i was talking about society and the fact that we like feedback there's a there's a great chance that after seven years we're not looking to cash in on the car and begin to walk the street then we're looking for upgrade we're looking we're looking like the elevated status at that point in time so you know what we get into another car loan which actually gives us a further setback of income right and this is basically the web that a lot of millennials or a lot of young persons are getting caught up into because it's so easy it's so cool for them to say hey i got shorter new car but they need to be able to count the cost because whatever income that you have coming in now if it is that you sell it out in the future that means that you are giving up on your economic future because you are making decisions now that will impact you later on in life right and these are choices that we need to be able to live with and these are considerations that we need to make right so nothing wrong with assessing that hey akai is to take me from point a to point b i could sacrifice because you know what there are other decisions in life that may matter more there's other i make decisions like having i'm like the emergency fund now we spoke about now mine might know nothing is wrong with somebody having a fantastic car a great car we thank god for it we bless god for it but we have a lot of young persons that are in situations now and they blame the government right the government not providing enough housing the government not providing enough tax relief the government this the government should be doing more right and so on and so on and we basically complain complain but body body body choices the decisions that we had to make that would have changed things right we didn't make those tougher decisions right so so nobody nobody will remember when it is that you drove a grover beta team for five six years when it is that you bring out a brand new car after after having an emergency fun and after have any financial piece when you drive out your brand new car they're gonna forget about all those old things right they're gonna forget all about it so this is why you need to be able to budget you need to be able to stop green which is essential it's much more essential than given upgrade for the future right so we need to be able to take consideration of these things so there's persons there's persons that take vacation loans i mean i'm like in our society they take they take loans for a lot of a lot of stuff a lot of stuff that they may not necessarily need to now think about it the same math that i would there you take a loan at a particular value you're gonna be paying back more right and it's what substance or what value that you actually get right now for business it might be totally different for business purposes and whatnot and stuff you need you need to think about that differently but whereas consumerism is and we live in a very consumerous nature meaning that we purchase to consume and if it is that you clean up your house around christmas time there's a lot of stuff that i wish that i didn't buy there's always a lot of stuff around your home that you wish that you didn't buy right so so basically like in closing i just want us to be conscious and i hope i hope that we're able to have a future conversation about about how it is that we could we could apply some budget and maybe some templates and and so on to really help the younger persons navigate because just just like there are a lot of temptations and so on in this world they are they are definitely a lot of peer pressure there's there's temptation there's there's always a temptation for you to spend money right and we need to to evaluate and look at it and look at down the road because many of us are not thinking january six months down the road one year down the road five years downgrade when it is that the bible tells us that a good man leaves an inheritance for his children's children right that that already means that we should be thinking dongnu that we should be thinking generational that we should be thinking about safeguarding safeguarding yourself safeguarding your future so just in closing i believe that this is this is this is where it is that i want to close right here in saying again i believe that we all start on a very very straight line meaning that when we start off our careers financially right there is a actually a more straight part or there's a straight part to the finish line more than you think there's actually a really straight part to the finish line right but the decisions that we make is the ones that make us very left and right and sometimes we end up spending years to to get burned and just spent up in mud and realizing that that there are certain decisions that we should not have made and so on and stuff like that so i tend to i tend to mention to to my people and so on try not to make the same mistakes in life twice there's so much stuff to do try not to make the same mistakes over and over so once you learn learn from one once you'll learn from it so that you can move on and you can make progress right so this straight line right actually gives us that path with a financial piece it's up to us to basically stay on that straight line so based on that i actually did some calculation because i i really love math because maths must kind of help me to navigate budgeting and so on and stuff like that and once i know maths is like linked to finance and to increase and we need to be aware of the flux and any cattle that we have in stock according to what it is that the bible says that means that you need to be in charge of your finances right so so i've run some maths if it is that somebody at the age of 20 years old right was earning three thousand dollars from the age of 20 to the age of 50 they would have actually earned over a million dollars right and that's at the at the average salary of three thousand dollars now we know that there's a lot more reasons we'll control far more than that now i don't expect business to save a hundred percent of your salary right but just think about if it is if it is that you could have held on to 50 if it is that you could have held on to 25 right by making wise financial decisions right then that that would actually give you some more financial peace in terms of thinking about grain that you would have stored up for when for when the farming comes up right there's actually stats that shows that um like within like the us there's more persons that are fearful of the fact that they have not planned for unlike retirement there's a lot of reasons that know that they have not saved i'm like enough and there's even more persons that are fearful of it right so we need to understand what role that it plays in terms of where it is that we go there there are scriptures that could actually guide us in terms of moving a little by little inch by inch foot by foot is how it is that we could gain grounds right and basically we can make progress so uh so i hope that what it is that i shared has been a blessing to you and i'm looking forward for if it is that we do have future discussions um on on this particular subject because while it is that we prepare for the spiritual right definitely we need to have our our affairs and finances in order in terms of planning in terms of budgeting because we want to be in a position that we could be a good samaritan we want to be in a position that when january comes and is the middle of january and some certain places don't have money to travel to work that you're able to external land in hand and so on and stuff like that we we can't all all be in the same position thinking impulsively and so what so what i'm like if it is that you have to put up the same christmas tree from last year so what if it is there you go get the splash paint this year you'll still make it through right right so thank you so much i want to pass you over um to the pastor thanks so much for the session and i hope that has been um that it's been a blessing praise the lord thank you for andrew and this time i want to put the pastor joined by isaac he has been the main anchor for the bible studies for this year and but isaac god bless you god thank you thank you brother andrew and um god bless you church and um i don't know i feel like um it's the end of the school team when will it say this is the last one for this year i feel like uh i don't know a principal or [Laughter] you know and i really want to thank um everyone for being here tonight i want to really appreciate brother andrew that was really really an inspiration and it's just really mind-blowing uh to me how god has really blessed us and you know i was just thinking there's so much in scripture and um i was sharing with brother ovid you know somebody shared something with me and when i saw it i was like whoa you know so i just want to share this with you quickly before i kind of just kind of sum up um this bible study process but in luke 2 um saint luke 2 and this i want to take it from [Music] uh luke 2 verse 40 speaking about jesus and i'm just going to give some closing comments uh before we wind down so saint luke 2 and verse 40 and the child this is speaking about jesus grew and wax strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him so this is young jesus now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover and when he was 12 years old so this is the 12 year old jesus they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast so the custom of the feasts would mean that they were used to doing this and when they had fulfilled the days as he returned so they would have left the child jesus carried behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not of it but they supposing him to have been in the company so it was a group so they made the assumption that jesus was you know within the group as they were leaving they went a day's journey and they sought him among their kin spoke and acquaintance so as if it was a caravan and jesus hadn't been one of the buses so you know and they're looking for him and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalem seeking him and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors so the king james version will call it doctors or the translation will speak to teachers both hearing them and ants and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us in other words why why are you move so with us behold thy father and i have sought thee soaring so you know we we they're stressed out trying to find out where you at what's going on why why you move so and he said unto them how is it that you sought me wistia not that i must be about my father's business and they understood not the saying which he speak unto them and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these things in her heart and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man and really when you watch luke's account of you know and this is the season you know we know jesus wasn't born in december but this is still the season when people you know recount you know quality christmas story or or you know or the birth of jesus but when you look at luke's account and luke was a doctor so he's he's very detailed in how he is narrating and expressing this after the birth of jesus this is the first you know call it public appearance was the first encounter we have of jesus are we seeing something you know and it is a statement that must be about my father's business but i want to not even focus on that i want to focus on the context of it and the reality was jesus was asking and answering questions on something and that something was scripture because that is all that there was to relate about so the very first time we have jesus saying something or an encounter was jesus was basically in a bible study it was a bible study between jesus and the learning men of the day discussing scriptures and here it is jesus at 12 is asking questions he's answering questions and he's astonishing not just those who were there but his own family as well and i'm in and i'm bringing that to before to really highlight how god has blessed us with these bible studies because bible study is something that god himself loves jesus didn't go with his parents to leave jerusalem because he wanted to have some time discussing these scriptures asking questions sharing things with the with with the learning men of the day and there's so much richness there's so much truth there's so much power in scripture that is such a a blessing and we cannot exhaust it and what is mind-blowing i said to brother over because i i spoke with andrew you know and i had that conversation with him about planning and we're just looking at the new year and stuff like that and you know as we were talking and he started share you know some things you were seeing i i called brother and i say you know i want to ask andrew to say a few words you know and and um and it really such a blessing and to see and i share with over that you know when the disciples had to pay their taxes jesus didn't tell them one pray he told me one fish and then the fish had the coin and i started to look at scripture and i said you know the bible speaks about our health the bible speaks about our families the bible speaks of our walk with god the bible speaks about your daily life the bible speaks about your temperament your bible speaks about your interaction the bible speaks about maturity and maturing the bible speaks about your inheritance the bible speaks about your purpose your bible speaks about your calling the bible speaks about god's for knowledge the bible speaks about the fact that all things work together for good so so the bible itself as as as the core instrument of life and to understanding that that we could speak scripture from a position of authority through the ministry of a prophet who was to bring that fought light to tie up all the loose ends to reveal every mystery so when we go into scripture it is clear to us we are so privileged uh to be able to see what we see so i am i am excited i am very very happy and i believe that god has shown us all so many things in this year and this 2020 has been a turning point for us and i look forward uh to what god will do by his grace in 2021 and yes brother andrew we will we will do many more sessions because i believe that god wants us to be complete christians he is entrusted with iran i'm said in every aspect of our lives and i think that is a real powerful statement so god is interested in every aspect of our lives if he can county hear on your head he's interested in every aspect of your lives and if it is written in scripture the bible said all scripture is given for encouragement for guidance for however you want to look at it so there's no verse in the bible that is there by accident in fact but ibrahim said if you don't see jesus in every verse in every word go and read it again because he is there you know so i really feel inspired and i really feel strengthened and i really believe that when you look back to i think it was daniel was one of the first studies that we did and then we went through so many uh in the new testament we went through a series in the book of kings and there's so many wonderful wonderful and i want to encourage you in in this season you know relax and go treat again take notes and and encourage yourself in the lord and we look forward for our wonderful wonderful time uh you know both for the rest of this year and into the new year so as it said um we didn't announce it before but tonight is the last um the last uh bible uh study of of this current year and um you know we are getting ready as borovid said for the virtual convention uh hosted by ghana that will be uh next week lord willing so uh this is the last zoom meeting um for this current year as well uh we look forward to having uh zoom premium in january on january 8th and then our first bible study will be january the 12th by the grace of god so be on a great expedition with that and once again i want to wish uh brother ovid and sister ovid happy anniversary today um 41 years um anniversary on behalf of the entire church uh you know that god will continue to bless your union coming to bless the marriage and the leadership and the vision and we are happy to be part of of that vision and i certainly want to continue to pray for the church so at this time let us just bow heads for word of prayer gracious heavenly father we thank you tonight lord and in this closing of this chapter of these zoom meetings for 2020 and lord to cap it off lord with lord how you are so interested in every area of our lives lord and to know that we have to be better decision makers lord it applies in the spiritual it applies in the natural it applies in our marriages it applies in our affairs on the job it applies in our finances lord and to see lord as whether andrew was speaking you know there was a study we did on the discipline of the word you know and i said you know this whole thing of budgeting and these things it comes down to having a discipline it comes down to not being distracted it comes down to having a focus it comes down to giving thought before action of not being hasty of not flying off the handle of having confidence and trust in you to know that it was little by little they were supposed to possess the land that land that joshua and and it was what there was little by little and to see the the the pattern of scripture the unfolding of your mind that our character is formed in steps add to your faith virtue and the virtue knowledge and it's not all at once but it's a step by step of adding and adding and adding and dying and dying and making progress and sometimes it's a grind sometimes it is not all about flash but it's about that discipline because it's a race and we understand the race is not for the swift but it is for those that endure to the end and lord we thank you for the vision and the inspiration lord to use the technology during this pandemic lord to be able to lord give to this sacrifice this commitment this effort lord to the bible studies and the zoom prayer meetings and the online services and all of these different things lord that lord your people have

should act lord because you have given us a rule book a playbook of you have given us lord your thoughts in word that we can lord understand your mind on every matter at any point in time we could see your thought on the different matters so help us lord through your word lord as we come to the end of this class of 2020 if i could say that lord that we could graduate from this class lord with a change in our thinking a change in our behavior a change in our thought process that we could be more sincere we could be more consecrated we could be more dedicated so lord may you bless your people lord as we go through this this season lord of of this christmas and the new year and this time of reflection and it was a burden in my heart to see a time of reflection a time of introspection and the same lord if we had a time we could we could take every topic we could take we could take every every issue and we could we could dig deeper and deeper and deeper so we look forward lord by a grace to lord what you have in store for 2021 lord we can have lord our own ideas our own plans even lord but what your purpose is is what will be accomplished so father may you bless our past in a
