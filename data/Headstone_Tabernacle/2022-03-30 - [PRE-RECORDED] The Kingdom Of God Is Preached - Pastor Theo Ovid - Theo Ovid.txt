through all my heart this morning hallelujah praise god you don't know who you are but you're to know who you are you're going to know where you come from you're going to know where you're going praise god oh hallelujah but raymond thompson was tremendous praise god we're talking about how you hear from god vertical some people only hearing only talking horizontal from man to man to man to man to man did not hear him from above oh glory to god but you had to hear from above then you could go across praise god hallelujah praise god when you hear from above then he could go across to others but you've got to hear from god as a son of god as a daughter of god you know what brother branham says the bride has the ability to hear from god so you could be vaccinated in 25 years that has nothing to do with it when god ready to speak to his son he gonna speak to his son and nobody could stop that god from speaking to his son or his daughter or his children do you believe that oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah understand this all around you is just earthly trappings environmental issues of the egyptian life so when they take moses moses was an ordinary hebrew baby but he was sealed into the hands of pharaoh and they raised him up as a prince all he knew is his royal highness all he knew is grapes and everything nice around him but that's just the ultraman that's just his human spirit that's that the gene taught in his soul no that's the trappings of egypt but when god was ready to get that man hallelujah nothing could stop it not the woman not the money not the popularity not the style of life nothing going to stop that man from coming face to face into what god ordained him to be what could stop you this morning when you ordained the comfort god grew when he was thinking about you god travailed when he was bringing you for you've got to come for okay we give the lord a shout of praise this morning you want to go into the world let's just stand up we want to sing through the blood through the blood through the blood we can come into his presence through the blood remember this friends all have sinned and come short of the glory not some all all have sinned so you really can't sit down on a self-righteous chair and judge this one and judge that one and condemn this one and ripo this one no there's a chance there's an opportunity there's a possibility that that blood could speak on that person's behalf let's close your eyes and say true [Music] through [Applause] says [Music] the blood [Applause] through [Music] jesus [Applause] before i read the word i want to raise her hand just worship him as the music plays [Music] [Music] oh glory hallelujah [Music] into his presence this morning we want to look at three portion scriptures luke 16 verse 16 luke 17 2 verses 20 and 21 and from the book of hebrews want to read verse chapter 12 verse 25 to 29. luke 16 16 reads the law and the prophets will until john since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man present into it luke 17 20 and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say low here or low there for behold the kingdom of god is within you and hebrews 12 25 see that he refused on him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not be escaped if we turn away from him that speaker from heaven whose voice then shook the earth i know he had promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifying the removing of those things that are shaking as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire let's bow our heads father god we thank you for your word and we pray that you're giving sight and inspire to our hearts and speak to us lord that will be changed and will be transformed how i thank you for the word vision that you have unfolded in this are may each plug into it and get into it that they can see themselves in the word and conduct conduct themselves correctly in json we ask it amen and amen you may be seated oh blessed be the name of the lord give the lord some praises as you have your seat oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah praise be to jesus oh glory to god hallelujah you love him oh praise be to jesus but my my my my my oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah i will context scripture here from uh this is from mark you'd have to find it mark 1 14. now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god and saying the time is fulfilled the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel o blessed be the name of the lord so this morning my title is the kingdom of god is preached and my subject is the kingdom is not in word but in power i have an inspiration striving to enter and be positionally placed so today we want to talk a little bit about this kingdom of god and how to do some search some research because in africa like in nigeria and different parts of africa they still have kings they still have chiefs and some time ago we're sharing with the brethren across there that we in the west we have no concept of that i don't know what that is we have prime minister and presidents and so on we don't know about that we have never lived in that environment of king and chiefs and and and so on we have never lived in that kingdom type thing uh the british has it they have to say of the queen and so on that's a kingdom uh the french had it different kingdoms and empire but it's not something familiar with us but we want to kind of get into it this morning a bit i have another scripture here from john 18 then pilate entered in the judgment hall again called jesus and said unto him i doubt the king of the jews and jesus answered him saying says thou distinct of thyself or did others tell it d of me and pilate answered am i a jew i know nation and chief priests have delivered thee unto me what has thou done and jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world notice we're not talking about church ah courtyard we're not talking about church you see the church part is easy you go to church you go back home but this is not church now this is kingdom he said my kingdom is not of this world watch if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence and the amplified say this way jesus answered my kingdom or kinship or royal power belongs not to this world if my kingdom or of this world my followers who have been fighting to keep me from being handed over to the jews but as it is my kingdom is not from here it has no such source or origin i kind of like that so the kingdom where i am from this earth didn't source it it didn't originate from this earth i am not from here oh glory to god hallelujah do you believe that okay just a little background we've always had to preach a kingdom as a king and the king owns everything in the kingdom including the people themselves in the kingdom the people are called subjects or citizens that's why ephesians 3 said we are no more strangers or aliens but fellow citizens of the whole show of god hallelujah are you with me and i like that the people are called subjects because they're subject to the king you don't vote the king in and you don't vote the king out it is not a democracy it's not the people's choice the king owns everything or could we give the lord a shout and pray no i don't want you to see it from a natural standpoint i want you to see from a heavenly standpoint we messiah is the king of king and he owns everything hallelujah are you with me so the definition or the subject is a person who is under the dominion or rule of a sovereign king when you live in the kingdom you are under the rule of the king in a kingdom everyone have a job or purpose to fulfill and the kingdom of god is no different the bible is all about a king his kingdom his royal children to be accepted as a child of god you must accept that he choose a kingdom rule not communism not a republic not a democracy but a kingdom rule so now you could understand when the people of israel asked for king and god told samuel they have not rejected you they have rejected me because god seeing that i am their king why should they ask for a king when i am their king they have not rejected you they have rejected me because i as king supposed to rule and reign over their lives because somebody give a lord a shelter praise hallelujah glory to god so the kingdom comes from king and domain a king have to have a domain or territory to which to rule so that's where the word kingdom come from a king over a domain isn't that right a kingdom is a governing impact of a king who will over a territory or domain his influence over the people isn't that right and a kingdom always have a king but that king is automatically a lord even up to now in england they have lord this and lord that and lord that that from way we old school there lord isn't that right and it's the quality of lordship that distinguishes a king from president prime minister mayor or governor in fact a king's lordship makes him different from any kind a leader lordship make the king unique a king sovereignty is absolute it's not it's unquestionable there's again more than 10 commandments so let it be written so let it be done to him is absolute so let it be written so let it be done their word is lord their word is god and jesus he is king and he is also lord whatever he speaks it's got to come to pass whatever he speaks it can't fail whatever it speaks it's going to go rate and create itself isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah glory to god so therefore the domain refers to territory dominion refers to the king to the king's authority so kings okay i'll just skip that all kingdoms have certain qualities i'm going to just strike some of them all kingdoms have a king a lord a sovereign amen all kingdoms have a territory all kingdoms have a constitution all kingdoms have citizenry or subjects they have laws they have privileges they have code of ethics they have an army they have a culture all kingdoms just want to strike just one or two with that i want to talk about this citizenry a little bit the citizenry is the people that live under the rule of the king amen citizens in a kingdom is not a right but a privilege as a result of the king's choice the benefits and privileges of a kingdom are only accessible to citizens that's why it's good when you become a citizen of the kingdom it means all the rights of the kingdom is available to you you don't have to access them but they belong to you you know if you're sick you can call the ambulance if you want but it's up to you to accept the health services that the government offer it's not that it's not there it is there is if you want to access it your healing is there your deliverance is there your breakthrough is near hallelujah yes your breakthrough is there it's whether or not you want to access it or you want to stay how you are but if you know you are citizen of the kingdom then you have a right to joy you're the right to peace you're a righteous ritual because you belong to the kingdom you are no longer a stranger you are not an alien you're not a foreigner you don't have to look along like if you don't belong here this is your home [Applause] oh give the lord a shout hallelujah you belong in his presence whose presence the presence of the king oh give the lord some praises people oh hallelujah glory hallelujah the king is obligated to care for and protect all citizens and their welfare is a reflection on the king himself oh glory to god it's the king responsibility the battle is not yours the citizens in the fight the army has fight for the citizens the battle is not yours it's the laws the lord will fight for us but glory to god the egyptians you see today you shall see them no more foreign come unto the lord i shout the praise we gotta know you're gonna know who you are you're gonna know who you are you are royalty oh give the lost and praise this people hallelujah hallelujah you are sons and daughters of the living god you are children of the father you are children of the king oh give the lord a shout out glory to god amen hallelujah glory glory glory the privilege the privileges are the benefits the king lavishes on his faithful citizens this aspect is different from other forms of government in a kingdom citizenship is always desired by the people because once you are in the kingdom the king is personally responsible for you and your needs and because the king owns everything within his kingdom he could give to any citizen any or all of his wealth that he desires i'm gonna leave it up today i'm gonna go forward oh glory to god hallelujah it's up to the king oh to give whosoever he will you can't tell the king don't give this one though he is the king and he is suffering grace is suffering love is sovereign heal hallelujah give the lord a shout you going to be delivered this morning oh glory to god if you want to deliver this morning is your morning today is your day for your breakthrough you're gonna know whose son you are whose daughter you are you're gonna know that today hallelujah oh glory to god amen hallelujah [Applause] how do they raise these royal children never did this before it's very interesting [Music] as reading they don't raise their children some of these queens or whatever it is they see the children one or for the day they turn a play center what they call royal nannies and tutors and people responsible for that now i understand why when the baby is born is an ordinary baby if prince william's baby was born and they send that baby to trinidad to be raised and train their parents and so on that baby will be raised like a trinidadian when he kind of talks he will talk trinidadian he will go to the school's normal normal he wouldn't even know he's a prince so when you're born you don't know you're a prince this and prince that prince the other you don't know you are kings and priests you think you are ordinary baby that's why you come to church to come on the tutors and governors come on now you know where i'm going you know where i'm going you know where i am going that's why i'm telling you you're not going to be the same after this service [Applause] glory hallelujah oh glory you see you see they have to teach the babies from small you are not like everybody else the other people are commoners the other people are egyptians [Applause] but you are jews the other people is of the eighth but you are from heaven you are not ordinary praise god you are somebody you are attribute sons of his spirit i'm not hearing you this morning i'm not hearing you this morning oh glory to god glory to god no doesn't that sound familiar to what the prophet taught us you may be seated he said when a tal is born into the kingdom he is placed on the tutors the parents don't raise him the tutors raised him and the tutors reported the father hold the sun coming along come on now come on now we talking about adoption we're talking about loyalty we're talking about the kings the kingdom oh hallelujah we're talking about whose son am i now oh give the lord a shout of praise so you leave that child alone to mix with the other children play with the other children whether england otherwise he would be just another child laughing talking whatever he would know the pics of royalty the culture what he's responsible for how he must view himself you see you have to get him into royal thinking and that's what god wanted to do to you because you are kings and priests you have to get to change your mind batman said be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god oh hallelujah hallelujah so some point in time that's why jesus oh yes you may be seated when jesus rose from the dead one of the disciples he opened up the word and he opened up the understanding to show them that their royalty to show them what they're about to receive that they want to get power they see power yet because the kingdom is not in word oh glory come on now let me preach somebody i said the kingdom my man is not in word but this is in power that's first corinthians 4 20 the kingdom [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but i've got news for you the kingdom is preached oh hallelujah glory to god the kingdom will be preached you're going to receive the kingdom you're going to have the kingdom oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah could we take some more so therefore much of the history the young children of british monarchs were primarily raised by nannies almost never mixed with commoners and spent much of their time being drilled by private tutors in history decorum and various languages they are tutored into royalty to think and act and live a certain way oh hallelujah so when they jump on them royal carriages and then chariots and everybody wave and they're supposed to get that wave because they are who they are oh coming and we are compass about with so many angels and the angel of god and compass around those that fear him oh hallelujah are you with me glory all right so that's the background let's get down into the word now hallelujah you love him love what are you going so far you realize it's not about church now oh hallelujah it's not about church now church is over oh my gosh when the kingdom come oh glory to god our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come but when the kingdom has come church over come on give the lord a shout you don't belong to no man you don't belong to this church no you belong to the kingdom of god [Applause] hebrews people say we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved okay he said oh god there's some white people talk about take me back to sheikah glory take me in the field with you i'm satisfied with jesus let me loose myself and find it in you get into the inner veil where all the wholes of the world the bible says in the last days there will come a famine upon the earth not for bread and water alone but for hearing the true word of god and people will go from the east to the west and everywhere trying to find it that hour is here here we go listen the hour is here where men are putting themselves up like gods and wanting to be glorified because the people said doctor so and so big so and so all paul said i have one fear that is except you would try to worship me instead of the thing that i'm preaching i never come to you with an enchanted word of man's wisdom but in the power of the resurrection of jesus christ gabriel instructions i understand this comes covers in the last days i understand that nation will be in against nation i understand that women will pop their head off in the last days i understand they wear short clothes walk with high heel shoes i understand that the mall will be so low i understand preachers will be false shepherds in the last days that will compromise i will not feed the people the word of god but will go after creeds and things instead but i understand that there will be a voice coming the last days crying out in the wilderness calling the people back to the original message back to the things of god i understand those things will take place i understand the last days become a famine here we go yeah the churches will be so organized so set in the last days there come a famine it will not be bread and water but for hearing the true word of god people go from the east the west the north and south seeking to hear the true word hear how they're gonna be starved out of it but the churches will be so organized and tightened that they failed to hear it they'll be settling to churchianity that's why brahma was so against organization because organization is rebellion against god because the organization makes you independent of his authority and kingship dominion hallelujah when man israel and god can rule come on wherever man is reigning god can be king an organization is man ruling and reigning over god's people that's why he says i'm gonna come now and call my sheep myself there'll be one more ride all glory to god but it will not be worth only it's gonna be power and demonstration of the holy ghost it will be the kingdom of god that has come all glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen oh hallelujah the church will be so organized tighten up that they will fail to hear it oh glory to god and i understand that by books i understand you said elijah before the day comes at the end time and rather messed it up we'll turn the half of the train back to the fathers turn them back to the original go back again to the end and start i understand that that takes place just before the spirit leaves a gentile church to return to the jews for the spirit to go to the jews have to leave the gentile church the spirit is about to leave here that's why we are striving before it leaves think about it like a tail about to leave and you are hanging inside a deer you are pressing the enter to get him and be positioned on the place before the straight splat strike oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah oh my god praise god amen from the baptism holy spirit brother brandon if the baptist turned me down the methodist the pentecostal upon the initial evidence speaking in tongues that's the reason we're not penecostals we don't believe that speaking of tongues makes you feel the holy ghost no more no you leave living in a band make you a pig all right or you standing like all right doesn't make you a cup no more than living at king's past will make you a king you could be a servant we believe you receive the holy ghost by an experience not by some mythical intellectual conception of the scriptures lord quickness to me but come to me my understanding open up no but by an experience that you alone know and if you want to know whether it was the holy ghost watch how your life patterns after that not watch so much revelation watch how your life patterns after the experience and it will tell what kind of spirit that coming to you oh give the lord a shout our praise oh hallelujah glory hallelujah you see everlasting and there's no question answers everlasting eternal is two different things and israel was cast out but not out of god's mind and paul was saying here that we gentiles have to take heed the way we walk because if god didn't spare the first branch which was the original branch and we were grafted in and israel was blinded for a season just for season is always blinded that's right but the veil will be lifted from the eyes and that is when here we go the last gentile is born into the kingdom of god then another quote he said maybe the last time i mean africa when that last one is sealed the book is closed not one more person is saved after that amen the pride will be on the earth witnessing god unveiling god because you know what adoption is adoption is unveiling god [Music] adoption without bringing tracks and courts and preaching word no man jesus didn't preach about healing he healed the people jesus didn't preach about raising the dead he raised the dead jesus didn't preach about the caster devils he cast out devils he did the job because the kingdom is not inward but in power but you have a promise acts 1 8 you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you so all the messages messages messages all the mysteries mysteries mysteries have to unlock the key to bring them the power the prophet said it is this the mystery of the thunders to bring back the power into the church the mission of the tunnels to bring back the headstone all glory glory glory glory hallelujah hallelujah glory when the last gentile is born into the kingdom of god notice not coming to the message notice not believe gods and a prophet no when that last gentile is born into the kingdom [Applause] amen amen hallelujah [Music] the gentile door is closed there is no grace left for the gentile at that time oh hallelujah five definite identification of the church but ibrano we have access to our king we have an interview with him whenever we want to call upon him we have no other intercessors no other mediator between the king and us but one man christ jesus the bible call it the messiah kingdom in other words where the messiah rules in every life in his dominion ruling the lives of his people are called our people he's the core lord one oh hallelujah now the church of god today is the same thing called out of the world called out of a religious cult call out of every religious denomination call out of every religious organization to walk with god not being governed by a bishop but being governed by christ in his messiah oh my ah hallelujah oh being gone by christ in his messiah kingdom christ is the king now you see what the church means church means call a bunch call out people that is governed by the king of this messiah kingdom oh glory to god is not wonderful no the kingdom the messiah empire the right to put it the messiah can pass so barbara doing research himself he's referring to a writer he's he like that there is that one such thing as church of the living god ever been organized organization is something that was adapted adopted to take the place of but when god was made flesh and become the messiah then if we yield ourselves to be anointed like he was we become messiahs we become little lights isn't that right god i like this messiah church so the real church of god supposed to be a bunch of little messiahs when they see you they see jesus they thought they just see jesus passed by they see another brother come and see jesus again they see your sister passed by this jesus again they said that plenty jesus no plenty messiahs plenty little messiahs little ones like him because they are they are royalty oh no they are sons and daughters of living god then you walk like a prince you talk like a prince you act like a prince you live like a priest you don't live like a dog you live right you talk right you act right give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] glory if messiah means anointed one and means king then if the church is anointed by the messiah spirit it become a lesser but still a messiah because it has his light reflecting his power reflecting his glory reflecting his dominion so it is the messiah how to reflect him in his kingdom in his domain as i told him in africa i said the destination is not heaven heaven is part of the itinerary i get problems to pronounce that one itinerary i think i see it wrong in africa heaven is part of the itinerary you go up and you come back down because god's original intent is for us to reign on the earth and the message i had was we shall reign on the earth when the lamb took the book john was shouting them all we shall reign on the earth so don't look to go to heaven as having some escape pod you're going up the comeback dog glory to god next month i'm going in there i have to leave from here go miami from miami the heathrow from heathrow to delhi from delhi to lucknow the destination is locked now india isn't that right but i have all those stops to take hallelujah so helmets are stopped glory to god come on now give the lord a shout but we shall reign on the earth glory to god you may be seated and i was telling that jesus he rained over his earth so when the spirit came upon him he was led by the spirit into the wilderness to overcome the lust of the eyes overcome the lust of the flesh overcome the pride of life till he conquered himself that he was a hot dominion over himself then he was ready for kingship you don't hear what i'm saying he was ready for adoption walk he was ready to be loosed on the earth as an example seed son or give the lord a shout because he proved we could be more than conquerous and he conquered that devil without power it's written it's written it's written oh hallelujah lord i shout oh yes yes the kingdom has come hallelujah glory to god jesus that is what he started to preach the bible said he preached the kingdom of god not church [Music] you'll be seated what difference it was gonna make this man with a beard coming amid pharisees crimes sadducees herodians essenes all kind of people churches there this man with a little beard talking about another kingdom [Music] given parables the kingdom of god is like this like that the kingdom of god is like this the kingdom of god is like that preaching kingdom talk and when he rules in acts 1 he spoke of things pertaining to the kingdom they asked him about natural kingdom he talked about spiritual kingdom he says forget about it but you will receive power after the holy ghost come upon you [Applause] so when peter man on the get caught beautiful i've [Applause] i belong to testing what i have i could give you because i believe to have the longer kingdom i have the kingdom beckham an ambassador of the kingdom i come from headquarters i am charged up silver and gold have i none such as i have i release i give oh give the lord a shout oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god glory to god glory to god you may be seasoned jesus told them if i don't go this kingdom can't come he said i am not going to leave you comfortless i'm gonna send another comforter who the world cannot receive because you see him but you're gonna know him he is with you but shall be in you oh glory to god or i feel the run around here then a little later on jesus tell them when they say law here lord they don't go there behold the kingdom is within you give the lord i shout give the lord a shout that kingdom is the holy ghost [Applause] sealing up your very life oh hallelujah oh glory to god the devil is a liar this morning the devil thought he was going to keep in ignorance yes the devil thought he was going to recognize that you were royalty the devil thought he wasn't going to access your healing and your preaching deliverers because set their hope in and wandering but not anymore you are no longer a stranger come on now you are no longer an alien but you are fellow citizens oh glory to god in this kingdom this came with my joy in it let's give them my breakthrough in it it's given my victory in it yes there's given my revival in it oh glory to god what do you want this morning soul [Applause] in that kingdom oh hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah there's so many people with a card out come join us come join us we got the biggest we got the most expensive what difference does that make all will perish but the kingdom of god is established in the heart and soul of a man by a revelation of jesus christ that's why he said upon this rock i will build my church oh i love that and the kids of hell why would man try to be that oh upon this rock remember he asked who do men say i am they say some say you are this some say you were that some say others he said no you know they don't know who i am you tell me who i am and they got caught because they didn't know all of a sudden brother peter brother peter brother peter he's going to deny christ later on he's going to cost later on but brother peter he said the son of the living god and jesus said i didn't tell you that i didn't put the paper behind your back and write that for you my father gave that to you you get it fresh you got it vertical you were getting horizontal nobody affects that to you nobody i emailed that to you nobody informed you and tell you that you get it from hearing and when it comes from heaven no man could take that that's the kingdom that cannot be moved oh hallelujah glory to god that's why the prophet said revelation is prevailing power when your title reveals after you you are being empowered and you begin to take up the authority step by step little by little but you're getting more power you are coming into power the bride will come into power oh give the lord a shout oh hallelujah because you are moving into kingdom authority [Applause] [Music] murray he was the messiah watch and he was anointed with the holy spirit and any church is anointed by the same holy spirit his messiah a little smaller one and someday when this body is resurrected i hope beforehand that god get a whole bunch of people that will manifest listen that will manifest its power in every dimension that it was supposed to be in [Music] france you hope he gets a church that he can manifest his power in every dimension over in every dimension oh hallelujah in every dimension his wife was sick with a tumor going on the operation theater and he spoke before the doctor's hand touches my wife the tumor will go down i told them in africa you'll have dominion over nothing and they just kept quiet it sounds so strange dominion over nothing there was no squirrel there there was nothing there and he said let there be a squirrel so even though there is nothing [Applause] you're gonna make something are you hearing me are you hearing me this morning oh glory to god there was nothing there and he said let there be a squirrel and it materialized oh what about the church oh glory to jesus took bread and multiplied he took fish and multiplied but the prophet said let there be a squirrel [Applause] do you understand now when the god told the prophet pick up on the right nothing will stop this bride you will not be intimidated by anything [Applause] when when that guy dropped dead in paul's preaching paul really didn't contribute like if nothing happened that was kingdom authority just rise back up and just continue preaching like that you'd have no funeral home and i'm not dial the police and an undertaker i don't have that deal it's just the living god the church of the living god with messiah with signs wonders miracles that's what we're talking about is that what you're looking for [Applause] so this kingdom is not what this message have now with the books and tips and listening to tips and books that is that's word that's not the kingdom the kingdom is demonstrating the power of god you haven't seen that yet but this is what is promised not all these bunch of groups all around the world saying they believe a prophet there you know message after 50 plus years hallelujah he said we put too much emphasis on the mechanics we need to put emphasis on the dynamics that's what we are doing because we are pressing into a position that god could say there is my spirit flowing freely hallelujah pressing the position to become a channel of communication with god to flow through men that are gonna die out [Music] christ could come alive oh glory to god the kingdom is to demonstrate the same life same sign same wonders same miracles hallelujah one time a woman missed the whole prayer line everything else she said show me when that man walk and if i walk there i'll be healed oh glory to god you want to know where brother are he said show me respect he walked that's what we're talking about hallelujah brain people came with faith to believe god for believe god for miracles to believe god for healing people sell out all the things that travel to the brown mutants because they're looking for deliverance and healing are we going to have that kind of meeting once more he said i'm going to ride the trail once more are we going to have the holy ghost so empowering our people that the crippled walking the blind sea and the death sharing held that being raised up and nobody could stop it oh glory to god they can't explain it away one time remember jesus he's a blind man and then pharisees come and say who healed you jesus he said no he's a sinner he said a man said whether he said that i don't know but there's one thing i know i once was splined but now i see hallelujah whatever right or not i don't know but one thing i know i'm free this is what we're talking about because the manifestation will be the interpretation come on hallelujah praise god i want to see sons and daughters of god rise up to know who they are where they come from where they're going [Applause] oh hallelujah glory thank you jesus let's continue oh hallelujah god's kingdom is not of the earth god kingdom is in our hearts it's a spiritual kingdom and you are born into it notice what he has told nicodemus you must be born again to see the kingdom and to understand the kingdom you must be born again to understand this kingdom he said shall a man enter his mother's room a second time no verily verily i sent to you you must be born again to understand the kingdom oh hallelujah unto you is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom but unto them is not given oh glory to god the sower so a seed that's a mystery the secret is the witness and the bride that's a mystery the spoken word original seed that's a mystery and you'll be hearing it all these years come on come on these are the kingdom of god and like a man who plant the mustard seed and it grow it he know it not how oh give the lord i shout give the lord a shout the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation but the person of christ performing the same words same times say miracles a life going inside of here oh hallelujah you are more than what meets the eye if you only know who you are oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah shake somebody hand tell them you are sitting next to royalty oh hallelujah praise god when you finish shake your hand give the lord a shout [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god glory to god you are sitting next to royalty we are royal priesthood we are holy nation we are kings and priests that would make us kings and priests unto god hallelujah glory to god amen oh glory hallelujah hallelujah glory to god you are more than meets the eye they will try with you a long time he has been pressing you a long time he thought he was going to give up he thought was going to stay out he taught you how to stay egyptian all these years but that was just your human spirit that was just your flesh but it was always an eagle hallelujah you were just among chickens but you were always an eagle once a year always an eagle because you were born an eagle oh give the lord a shout and pray hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god let me be seated so once your thinking changes your life changes your ways changes just talk changes but i'm talking about a slave in america they wanted to one man wanted to buy him because he finally so different from the rest and the slave owner said no he's not for sale man said why does he sleep in a better place no does he eat a different food no he said no he does the same like everybody else and i checked him out and i find out that way back in africa here we go he knows he's the son his father is the king of the tribe and he knows he is the son of a king and he walks like one huh he talks like what he acts like one even though you're eating the same food even though he's sleeping in the same thing even though he faces the same trials even though he's having the same tribulation he is acting different because he have a different awareness or consciousness he know he comes from a kingdom you are hearing me hallelujah he knows his father is a king [Applause] so watch you let me see that watch isn't that the environment give you the king behavior no no because he wasn't environment all the rest of slaves but it's his consciousness is his training is the tutors he had back in africa is his ability to walk oh glory to god to walk upright and all the other states walking broken and down he's walking with his shoulder up he's doing what they tell him to do but he's walking with dignity he's walking with grace he is walking with humility because he have the kingship upon him and when jesus dropped that robe that golden oil of the holy ghost that royal anointing that holy ghost anointed oh my my my my glory glory hallelujah oh do you see it this morning are you catching it this morning stop behaving how you behaving come on cm and somebody you could do better than that come on you husbands you are sons of god you could do better than that [Applause] come on new wives you could do better than that you could talk better than that you could talk sweeter than that oh yes you could talk more gracious than that oh glory to god let your words come up with kindness because sometimes you better take them back and eat it back come on you may be seated give the laws and praise this people oh hallelujah help me jesus help me here this morning oh glory to god glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my god praise god christ is the head of this messiah kingdom and you cannot organize a kingdom of which christ is the head you cannot denominate a kingdom which christ is ahead because christ is king and you cannot take the intellectuals of man and make an organization to which christ will govern therefore any companies any peoples any groups of men that tries to organize the kingdom of god is going contrary to the king and if they are going contrary to the king it will be against the king and if it's against the king it will be antichrist that's pretty rough if i had a more voice i'll make it clearer it is antichrist and an antichrist spirit tries to take a people and call them from organization to organization organize them together which will never was the will of god people has always fostered me because i struck so hard an organization it isn't the people in there i'm striking up it's that dominating spirit that makes the people think we are the people so it's a mindset that they present upon the people thinking that they are it they are it and everyone must come there to be part of it but this kingdom is the mystical body of jesus christ the people in the united kingdom in africa and that kingdom and europe and that kingdom and america and south america all around the world because the bible said dawa's redeemed us of thy blood out of every nation so you can't put anybody in and you can't take anybody out but luke 16 16 said the law and the prophets was until john and since that time the kingdom is preached and every man come on now say it lord say it lord say it lord every man press their way into it [Applause] oh hallelujah no they tell the people once they're in the message they are it that's not what the bible teaches that's not what the prophet taught he said hear me bring them tamina except you apply the token you've got to have the token to be in the entire message not join some church people just warmed out of here some people it's what you want to do hallelujah oh glory to god amen hallelujah glory to god hallelujah glory to god's people is this call of people i believed in every denomination they could be catholic listen they could be protestant they could be jewish there could be any kind of church but the real church is the mystical body of jesus christ and you cannot organize the mystical body of christ and every person that comes to christ comes out of the world comes into christ comes into that mystical body is the man right and he liking it that parable like husband and wife he calls the church the bride the bride is no longer bragging is no longer two people they're one she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone and when a man or woman is called to the mystical body of christ by the holy spirit they become a full member of his body and then they are filled with the holy ghost because god took the spirit out of christ raise up his body place it on his throne and send back listen here we go send back the holy spirit to make up the mystical body of jesus christ that's why the prophet said one day the last drop in the pocket gonna be finished because the spirit was released to make up the mystical body so every time somebody get baptized is one slot taken another slot taken another take me one day the last name on the book that would take that slot then that mystical body is complete then they're waiting for the head are you getting that we're talking about bright body but here's the head then they're waiting for the head and the head come like a magnet to take up the body oh hallelujah are you with me we on earth will be magnetized to the headstone so when the headstone come it's taking up all those who are magnetized to it so one big headstone magnet gonna be sweeping across the world picking up the elect that's the rapture oh give the lord a shout out [Applause] praise hallelujah that mean you have to have the thing inside of you to be taken up oh glory to god then this mortal put any more talents here this corruption put an incorruption we shall be changed why the magnet power of the headstone the capstone [Applause] oh glory hallelujah [Music] the kingdom of god is his word made power hallelujah the kingdom of god is his word made power say after me would made power for all these years a hearing word but that would have to be me in power hallelujah this is what brother branham was able to do demonstrate the power of god so he would preach and then wait and then he said the angel is here he's no i represent the faith but we have a divine gift there was one time that prayer cards there and a man put a wrong thing you know what it was burj george something he put on it diabetes or some kind of that and a man came up in the prayer line because the man taught burma was a gimmick he thought barbara was a fraud he thought he was an imposter and pushing it so he put some kind of contrary disease that he did not have and brahms said you're not sick he said you put that on the prayer card you have it right there you got it god judge that man right there by the time barbara said boy had close eyes there's an epileptic spirit there trying to cast out be reverent bow ahead close your eyes a bunch of people keep the eye open he begged them he pray the spirit leave this person and drop them all at them all them had it afterwards god demands respects a woman you tell her about a church dressed in church whether it is cover whatever it is and he said she wouldn't like she could take that kind of religion within 24 hours she needs hospital dying for laws understand when the king is angry you ever hear about the wrath of the king that's why god had been so angry about a man who was speaking his behalf that he did not send the anger of the king the wrath of the king is the king you talking about and i try to bring this today in this way because we don't have that concept here in britain there's a whole big thing the only pom-pom manually carried that sir them still have characters from liberty 14th or 16th or 17th how much do we have i think right now there are only certain names they could choose for cheating for the future and baby baby then choose all the cuckoo names is that elizabeth or harry william or what whatever it is but the certain names that are confined to they can't filter make up a name and say you know what chili baby you can't do that this is royalty even jesus get a new [Music] name i'm the bride gonna get a new name too because it's royalty give the lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah glory to god so god wants to promote you but before he does he had to get your mind right so let's go wrong in adoption a little bit yeah but abram's having a child is born putting a treat on the governors then he says the tutu is what speaks to the father he said how'd my son come along boy this boy is real trouble not doing his homework not listening to advice not taking console and whatnot give him some more time he must be you know hot around your neck or something like that next time how are you doing boy like a chip off the old block he acting just like you he said give him some more years give me some more yes nothing just like you okay okay okay come on come on come on business what he's too young he needs some maturity you can't put power in a young the bible says even though you are heir if you are a child you just like everybody else and you remain under tutors and governors until until time appointed by the father so even though you are son of the king you are heir to all things you have to wait [Applause] i'll be saying david look look god fed up with saul soul god had enough so set up good you know this all started good souls are very good number one he he was what he was calling for because god tells samuel listen the one they want they want a king gideon king saul tallest handsome so i'll have everything together for that just hold that but that was just a substitute until david come isn't that right when someone had a mess up god god tells samuel listen i have a son i have a king in wanna just see son go on anointing to be king because you have to be it anointed not talk this king thing you know oil has to come on you so when i when you leave here i hope i i just feel the oil dripping all down to your foot all oil all over you that's what i hope and i trust in praise god you walk out here different so you know the story saul went samuel went and and called jesse's sons not this one not this one nothing was sent for david when david come he poured hold on and even david is still a young boy but listen god see my skin [Music] so not because you're not ready god not seeing you so come on now he's not waiting for you to be ready he's ready to anoint you now you are going to be that oh give the lord a shout for glory hallelujah [Applause] watch david can't come up to saul and his soul i get to know each other that jones minds you know what's going to happen there right the bible said david lost his head you don't do that that that not even wise david already anointed he knows that look what baby said the same day he was anointed that he was picked up on soul know the cure for that is to bring a man who could play well bring some music so they went to the music classes and see who will play the best and david was the best [Music] david playing by the throne that he was sitting something david is walking through the palace that he would walk what has happened he getting training the environment saul don't know that david getting familiar to where you have to walk when he's going to be king it could be rough but he's going to get the head it could be tough but he going to get there [Applause] david young david kagon jumping through and play throne throne i'm boss now yell away tell goliath until you learn he started singing write the specials soul killer thousand and david kilten thoughts guys when souls are they get hurt when that them sister singh are wrong special that day that was just the wrong thing to sing because saul said they can fight with david now you want to tell javelin you want to do this you want to do that do you want to run for his life that's how life is he was finished and do you even know it oh hallelujah kingdom taken away and don't even know it and the church think they're in power because they have the people but they don't know the kingdom has been taken away from them because all they have is the deed but they don't have the abstract they have the word but they don't have the spirit when the spirit comes you're not talking or taken you're taking what you have to take oh glory to god are you with me when they came and said this daughter is sick then they come and say don't worry to talk brother jesus your daughter died she's dead jesus said forget that i go weaker [Music] [Applause] you heard what we're talking about his thinking of royalty and kinship and power have nothing to do with debt and sick and problems he has to do with solutions and meeting the needs of his subjects [Applause] because the king have to take care of the subjects so when he's responsible for his subjects so when he said go wake her and he meet everybody there unbelief he said get him out i see unto thee arise and he walked back it's normal to him the people five thousand people two five loaves two fishes he had to take care of his subjects he said we can't let them go hungry what do we have and i guess if there was nothing he was gonna make something you're not hearing oh that's good that's fresh if there was nothing jesus was going to have to make i don't know sulfur sandwich big chicken sandwich whatever sandwich you had to make something but a boy had five rules and two fishes that's enough just bring that to me praise god whatever you got i could multiply it i could add to it i could flavor it come on now i could change it i could transform it i could inspire it are you with me how many writers with me this morning glory to god i want your faith go up to god i want you to understand your king is your provider i want you to understand he's your lord he said i will never leave you i'll never forsake you but i'll be with you even in you god said so [Applause] the kingdom of god is god's word made power what is the kingdom of god it's within you the kingdom is in you and when the word comes in there what does this word begin to do it turns itself into power oh hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god could you take a little more what is it you've got to get with the word get yourself killed out i'm persuaded that many of us friends have received the holy ghost but we just receive enough holy ghost in us to make us to a place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but god wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to fill your thinking he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill every bit of you to make you completely dead to yourself to your thinking and surrender to the life of god that there is word making life he said no watch on the bibles in the last days there will be churches to what's the torah baby like they have a form of godliness deny the word power and the power of his word what is the word what is the kingdom of god we belong to a kingdom before we get watch get this bomb we have got to belong to the kingdom before we can be subjects of the king [Music] how do you get into the kingdom the kingdom of god is the word of god made back into power amen so there's another one arising on his son he said another message will come that the full maturity of the world have turned itself back again into power the full maturity of the world has turned itself back into power therefore i know power going to be released because it is promised i don't have to work up about it i'd have to try and say oh like you're trying to manufacture something the fish though don't try to say i'm taking a deep breath the fish swims because it's built in the buddha run like run a high rate that just to take off the bird just flies because it's built in the power is built in that word there's something built into you [Applause] hallelujah glory to god amen are you with me hallelujah praise be to jesus here where i want to get to who praised god as the head was took from the grave so the body must fall in back to eden watch where the head of the family the man the bridegroom the bride being the body of the bride remember the brain is the body called the church amen he is the head of the church therefore the head of the body but the bride is the body call the church not this physical thing that man-made thing not that the mystical body that's the real church he's upon his rock i will build my church not some pastor bill some church he promised to build his church oh glory to god and the gates of hell can't touch that wrestle with it but i can't overcome it so therefore that rock that he put inside of there he placed in your soul before the foundation of the world he put a gene inside of you he put a seed inside of you you couldn't help but come to this message you couldn't help but respond to the voice of god in the last days oh glory to god because then you had that gene that thought [Applause] glory to god that thought must be expressed and a word is a thought expressed so you were in the thoughts of god oh glory you might be seated you're in the back part of elohim's mind you were part of his thinking when he spoke he spoke for you glory to god amen hallelujah you may be seated so when you came forth he is no longer elohim he is jehovah one with his family is finally time we going back to eden but when the book came down he had to produce evidence that the book is unearthed we have to see evidence that the book is on the earth and but abraham said son come on and shine four days proving the same god that was with joshua that says son stand still that god is alive [Applause] oh glory to god my god you understand that brother branham was reflecting kingdom dominion and kingdom authority because the bible said we shall have dominion over the fish over the sea over every creeping thing so when that dead fish is a little fishy i give you back your life he was demonstrating dominion over the flesh to make another death itself oh give the lord a shout and pray oh hallelujah power over the element hallelujah power over nature power over the beast so god make him confront a killer bull you may be seated a beast of the field he forget his gun he said if he had his gun human he was gonna shoot the ball and pay for the ball but that gun was forgotten human that he don't have to rely upon human he had to rely upon divine then something happened something came over him he said bull you spoke to the bull it wasn't the words it was what came over him i'm not hearing you hallelujah something gonna come over you mary asked the question how shall this be he said the holy ghost going to come over you and you're going to produce the messiah something's going to come over you i believe it's here this morning the dynamics is here the holy ghost is here [Applause] glory glory glory glory oh glory rub your sleepy eyes wake up inside of here oh glory to god we have received a kingdom glory to god my god you may be seated the word was lost through the ages the prophet said it took seven angels to gather all the scattered word and tied back into the word to bring down the holy ghost heaven consists of the word so the kingdom of god had to come down to the earth as the word of god and the mystery of god comes strong from god as the word of god to reveal god to the people so god couldn't send the kingdom of spirit because we wasn't ready yet if the spirit came are we not ready we end up like pentecostals but god didn't want that he want the same life same signs same wonders same miracles same what same life [Applause] then because they had the gifts but not the life because the lives come by the word and the word come to the prophet and they reject the prophet [Applause] so that they couldn't go on to be adopted sons nice big pentecostal ministries and ministries and healing and signing wonders but not to be abducted sons because the doctor's son signed the check just like the father that's why you say when you see me [Music] you see the father don't even ask about the father oh hallelujah my signature just as good hallelujah just tell me how much how much you're right how much a sign on that check my signature just as good if i say higher you were hired if i said five you are fine oh glory to god i'm gonna adopt the son the father said hear ye him don't even bother with me hear him oh glory to god my voice is in him my word is in him my power in him my kingdom is in him my god i'm in the spirit now now we can understand what jesus said whatever you're buying on earth it's born in heaven whatever we do on earth reflect it in heaven because god brought heaven down to the earth he wanted earth to reflect what was in heaven that's why he put man here to bring god to the earth to bring god to man and the word was become flesh and dwell among us oh give the lord a shout of praise oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god oh praise god so brother branham he said on as long as you are pregnant with the same word which is his body you have took his body become in him and when you took the word not the creed therefore here we go are you ready that's why we seem so contrary to everything else yes what people get problems with me quoting they still complain about that channel i ain't no preacher that is true i'm a coach i'm a reader i'm an inspired reader hallelujah but all i know the spoken word is original seed so i prefer to stay with the spoken word i prefer to preach the spoken word i read the frame what i say by the word itself so here we go the body don't fail to get this brother said the body therefore cannot recognize any hatred but the word so the bride body guy recognize those headquarters in europe in america south america africa there's no headquarters to recognize the pope have that as barajan was saying in africa mr francis the catholics have mr francis in the headquarters in rome francis is like a rock star right now were you waiting for mr francis in america but we have jesus as our king [Applause] and we are about to demonstrate what kingdom we are [Applause] i from good this morning hallelujah hallelujah you know one of them guys what did herod want him wanted to do some entertainment with him he's 15 answer he's a talk and pilate recognizing the pressure palace saying like for you jesus broke his hand said no you you can't fear me you say my father put you where you are you only dear because my father put you there if i want i could call 10 post ninjas i could call the army from the kingdom you you hearing me this morning hallelujah do you love him this morning do you love this gospel this morning [Applause] and you see some armies there and he fighting after what you say finish system he's standing up still getting the performer when next i just saw the casino have a seat hold on bring some juice for you some tea you're cool now he said open this boy eyes when god take the veil off of his eyes and he saw the angels from the kingdom all around he himself said but they are more for us than against us you see is what perspective is what you are seeing is what your perception is in that drama when he is seen from the natural it looked like so much pressure and thunder and enemy and troubles but when god lift him up and see how much escort and look around he's you know man every angel is it's like everybody's drawn so you know and i feel like sit and duck down like if there is something they are always more for us than against us hallelujah satan only went with one third two thirds came out and he fell on it hallelujah there was always more for us than against us deborah's a liar he got kicked out and he cannot go back in because he is jealous of you because you are children of the king glory to god you understand he was once in power he wasn't satan he was lucifer he had a different name after when he fell he got a new name but his old name was lucifer son of the morning he was high up until he got lifted up in pride and said i'll be as the most high i want some worship and the angels represented you and me said no we are not going to worship you we are worshiping our lord our king hallelujah that is what we are doing here this morning we know what we worship we know why we worship we know who we worship who give the lord and praise his people oh glory to god how do you feel about jesus this morning hallelujah glory glory to god amen glory to god amen hallelujah hallelujah no you see the seals redeeming someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the words is him so this mysterious book that the angel brought it wasn't that's that's a book it was a book with names on it your name my name you ought to hear your name and once you hear your name by revelation it caused you to get an understanding of whose son you are oh hallelujah they will give you a wife problem husband problem mother problem father problem father no problem modern law problem daughter no problem work problem name it problem man problem woman problem what kind of problem sickness problem and devil have to give up now because he recognized you problem proof [Applause] those three hebrew boys was fire proof daniel was lying proof you

still pressing on what is in that man what is in that woman what making them act the way they act oh chloe they're supposed to be domino they're supposed to be giving up i frustrate them i depress them i send demons after them but they're still coming back they're still shouting they're still praising god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah give the lord a shout in the house glory to god glory to god this one wearing mini skirt this one went short dressed this one pregnant this one living with some man this one before this one you don't know what to make out of it i am not the judge of that let god deal with that our god is great our god is able our god could do anything [Applause] glory to god hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] satan see there's oppressive condemnation i keep reminding them what they do keep reminding them remind them and they keep shaking head like this yes yes yes until today when you go back to calvary and you see the cross and you see the blood and they see forgiveness and you see why he died and you understand that all have sinned and come short of the glory and there is none righteous no not one so you can't boast about yourself you can pretend you're more holy than though holy than this one forget about it you are not angels come on now i'm saying about it oh glory to god leave them with the wings let them fly but you are here on the earth you are flying nowhere you are staying right here and you're going to overcome the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life give the lord a shout [Applause] glory hallelujah don't try to

of god haunting the elect so jesus one man called 12 and that 12 grew and then it called 120 in the upper room spirit baptized them and then it grew tree toes and added what was god doing his spirit is now going through all the earth to gather up the elect hallelujah hallelujah when the jews finally turn it down paul turned he said turn to the gentiles they don't want it i tuned this way god ordained that the jews got blinded that paul could take the gospel to the gentiles hallelujah then the match for the gentiles is on well we have had seven ages of gentiles and we come to the end of the age before judgment strike god say behold i send you elijah the prophet oh hallelujah we coming to the end of the gentile dispensation as god about to go back to the jews oh hallelujah oh glory to god oh i'm almost done hallelujah praise god listen to the part that touch me there for the body here we go cannot recognize any of the headship but the headship of the world here we go are you ready then our hatchet is a kingdom [Applause] and the kingdom is within you the bible said we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of god made spirit and life in your own life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it is in that day when the word and god was won oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord so god said go into all the world and preach the gospel then he meant go to all the world and demonstrate the power of god to every creature in order to preach the gospel here we go this is a bomb before you can make it a gospel preach amen so the kingdom must be preached right yes but before you can make it gospel preach you have got to have the power and demonstration of the holy spirit to prove the gospel the letter kill it but the spirit make it life so the gospel is not really the gospel until it comes with power [Music] so we have a promise of power that is what you're looking for your own inheritance your own power virtue to come into your being how to fill your spirit that is what you make in preparation for oh glory to god hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah praise god isn't that right glory to god after the seed in you that seventh under seed in you is crying for the life of second peter 1 427 that you can have a living faith and living virtue and living knowledge we wanted to live it must be manifested and tested did you get that it must be manifested and tested and then it's proven to be inside the idea oh hallelujah praise god amen okay here we go praise god hallelujah did you know that men that are sons of god are amateur gods god said they were gods because they had full domain over dominion of the world he gave them dominion over all things but he lost his godship he lost his sonship he lost his domain and satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god who will come and take it back over again so this is the prophecy we are waiting for kingdom sons sons will come into position to know who they are who know the father is waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets to the top where the full sons of god will be manifested when the pyramid gets to the top isn't that right god wanted to place his church sons and daughters god help live to see me see it is my prayer so close till i could feel it with my hands almost that's what i've longed to see waiting for the time when walked down the street the earlier crippled lane there from the mother's womb silva and gold having none waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god when god will make himself known they would stop sickness they would stop cancer they would stop diseases you think can say something the bible said they come at a time when men will rot in their flesh and the buzzers will eat off their carcasses before they even die kansas are two take to what's coming but remember that horrible thing was forbidden in that day to touch those who were the seal of god and that's what we are striving for now to get in here we go that's where the inspiration comes from we are striving to get in and be positionally placed into the kingdom of god before these horrible plagues strike you have no time to be a church member jesus remember we'll get you the tribulation hallelujah the thing you're the strife force to get into the kingdom of god i want to put that as a burden upon you i want to be in that kingdom i want to be part of that kingdom people are caught up in church the ministers that make the church so nice and churchy and the history and all what they're going through and all that said that drama and whatnot all the people know his church there's nobody pastor he lied he writes everything about it all you know his church but the kingdom they don't know anything about that and that's what jesus came to introduce the kingdom of god hallelujah are you with me praise be to god hallelujah it's a king it's a spiritual kingdom isn't that right and i'm talking about the approach praise god to this new birth approach to the birth he said you cannot go to the same process you can't go to the same way at thinking he said to get this born again you have to change your thinking you have to change your way you and you know what i realized whatever you tolerate you don't change you see people are tired of themselves and your ways you haven't come to a dead end yet whatever you tolerate you're still allowed because you're tolerating it but if you get angry and you say you know this enough is enough i want a change in my life this is it it will change because you had enough of you you had enough of you you come like job i hate myself people don't talk that kind of way but that is when you come to the spot [Applause] glory that's what jacob come through jacob jacob was wealthy and he had to go back to meet his brother he got horrors he sent his wife one way family one way and jacob was caught all alone then he met the angel the angel wanted him alone because when you're with the crowd you get drifting with the people god can't get you alone that's why the gentile is individual you can't lean on your mother revelation father husband wife revelation you have to get your own revelation so when jacob was caught alone he began to wrestle with the angel he had one talk changed me that's all change me and he rest and he's holding on because this is where his blessings at give me a scripture luke 16 16 the kingdom of god is preaching every man press their way into it so here it is jacob rasmuth angel for what a blessing he wants his life change he don't want to testimony ah i touch the angel i come back senator testimony i touch the angel and your work is the same you're talking the same you don't want to touch the angel you want to touch you [Music] so jacob jacob wrestled all night long all night long that man was desperate because you see when you are desperate you can't let that injure go the angel wanted to go he said go let me go it's coming morning he said where you going i will not let you go till you bless me hallelujah then the angel touch him then he started walk different i couldn't walk with that bump no more you gotta walk with a limp now you don't look like a little old man now you had to walk a little different now hallelujah you had to walk a little different now you gotta take it easy when you're young you're feeling strong when you're young you want to do it well everything you want to do but when you're getting in the wall it's a different kind of thing so jacob walking down all the fear leave him now he ain't fear the brother because he got the fear of god upon him now you see when you conquer with god you end bother with man when centuries overcome the devil no willingness what man could stop him doing that he said go tell that fox tomorrow cast our devils praise god my always not yet come you can't stop me i called for this thing oh glory save this hallelujah give the lord some praises that's when a man encounter god it takes away fear of men the ministers association the boys the fivefold fall whoever in the fall take away from all of them praise god hallelujah who think that the angel and the ancient angel oh glory to god hallelujah are people going to run from us you know oh yes when they see us come on they will flee praise god hallelujah praise god when they say yeah yeah they're going to flee you know one time jesus went someplace and there was a christ say holy please because they recognize him come on now you don't understand what i'm saying the people the people see jesus but the devil seeing the king is wrong when the kings are wrong when the lands are wrong everybody is shut up called the land of the tribe by judah when that land anointing come everybody just shut up and that's what god's going to produce the land right but judah this bible is so annoying nothing will stop this bride fear no king fear no commandment fear nothing oh glory to god hallelujah you understand what is going to be like elijah walker didn't say not even to a rain will fall i called for it i shut the heavens up that's a man with power that's a moment of authority that's the gospel but just as elijah could shut up the heavens another man could unlock the heavens and say let it rain or give the lord a shout of praise inside of here oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god glory to god glory [Applause] so when our church has grown in under the persecution of the outside world believing on the lord jesus that the promise of the holy ghost is just as real to us as it was the pentecost how they grown and crying their labor pains but when they are born and positionally born ephraim even then god set in the church apostles and prophets and teachers and evangelists started with a man lots of money lots of big things that's the popularity all these things are dead to the believer we don't care a tent or cottage live or die i think what wrong this is the thing i'm interested in the kingdom of god whether i maintain my home whether i maintain my family whether i maintain whatever it is let me maintain christ the hope of glory build me upon the lord into this let christ be my head that's looking to me on my foundation my feet that's in him let virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness burly kindness work in me oh lord is my prayer i don't care live or die sing or drone denomination no no mission friend no friend let that work in me let christ virtue his knowledge flow out that i might be able to teach those for god has set in the church apostles and prophets and teachers and pastors and evangelists all for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it how could the ministers bring the virtues into the people if they themselves don't have the virtues these men were filled with the virtues but abraham had the virtues he had the life of christ in him they asked him a question brother branham how come you could go to all these different churches and they don't believe what you believe you say hoping someday knowledge to know what they believe temperance patience with him is the virtues inside of him this is what these brothers had they had no argument with men they did what it's supposed to do and what they published isn't that right oh glory to god blessed be so but watch it when you surrender your complete being when the holy then the holy spirit just pours through you in these virtues as a living tabernacle listen here we go i'm almost done then the people would look out and say that's a man full of virtue knowledge he believes the word temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness he's full of love of the holy ghost there he is what in the wrong a statue that unbelievers can look at and say there is a christian that's why i see people in messages they're not christians other are not christians they are message believers they believe prophet they believe ghosts christians have a christian christian is to be christ-like not the people in your church to everyone when a man possesses this all these virtues then the capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of god which is the holy ghost so on top of faith virtue knowledge temperance brother kindness you get holy spirit come and seal the whole thing but charity and paul call it the bond of perfectness then there's no leaks in your building nothing leaking out anymore you are sealed and you become a living monument you go in some of these countries you always see some bronze statue you're asking who is that there's a man some low general and whatever what can i start you so hold on some statue of this man kitchener statue this one statue that's at you them statues are dead you can't talk to that but then when you are sealed you become a living monument a living statue a statue that could walk and talk in other words you come back to eden satan in trouble because you you and satan eaten but you and your eden with dominion and authority those devils that cry out and move out of your way as you pass you have police escort natural government are blue lights you have angel likes satan know you coming because he said he enters in front royalty coming royalty don't drive alone there are people in front of people behind security in front secret inside [Applause] so after a while the angel coming to clarity wait for you because the angels are servants but you are sons come on now oh glory are you getting in there oh hallelujah oh praise the name of the lord glory to be born of the spirit is to believe and behave yourself in the spirit is to understand and believe with your heart that jesus is the christ this is his word and no other words can be added or taken from it without your name being taken out of the book of life that is a strong one that's a strong one to be born means to be booted from above right isn't that right you have to be born from up here to be born again then that kingdom is so much higher than this kingdom till this kingdom is foolish to that all right so afterwards the world become foolish to you you truly become a stranger and a pilgrim in this land hallelujah praise god and in the prayer you know the prayer doors with all the baptism of the spirit may receive it father may all the great mysteries that we are supposed to know in this age lord be unveiled to us purpose that we will see the plainness of god so that we will know how to behave ourselves and act correcting ourselves and bringing the members of our body into the

hallelujah hallelujah national force put israel in the homeland national forest will put the church in the world of churches but the power of god will put the people in the brain you want to be in the brain it will take the power of god to put you in the brain here's the dynamics jesus we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image as we see him united with us
