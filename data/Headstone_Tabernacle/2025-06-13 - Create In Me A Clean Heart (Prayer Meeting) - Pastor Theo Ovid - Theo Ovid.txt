Heavenly Father, we thank you for your presence and we thank you for this great opportunity that we could talk to you, we could commune with you. Father, I pray that you would come down in a special way tonight by your word and by your spirit and anoint your people in their homes, Lord. Those need a comfort, those needing a touch, those needing healing, those needing deliverance, breakthrough, whatever might be forgiveness, cleansing. Father God, may you come in a special way and minister to your saints, minister to your people tonight in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you and welcome. Thanks again for being here. And I would like to share some of you tonight. And I want to take a scripture from Psalms 51. You want to read from verse 1 to2. And the title of what I want to share with you tonight is create in me a clean heart. And that is from the same psalm. This is the psalm that after David fell in sin born with Bashiba. This is David's prayer unto God. And David was saying these words. Psalms 51. Have mercy upon me, oh God, according to thy loving kindness, according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgression. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgression, and my sin is ever before me. So David wasn't making any excuses. He was coming clean. I acknowledge my transgression, and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight, that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgeest. Behold, I was shaped in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me. Behold, thou desireest truth from the inward parts or from the inner man, and in the hidden part thou shall make me to know wisdom. Urge me with hiss up, and I shall be clean. Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the bones where thou has broken may rejoice. Hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free spirit. So what it is to have a clean heart, David said, "Create in me a clean heart, a heart free from gu, a heart free from rebellion, a heart free from excuses, a heart free from lies, a submitted heart. We want God to answer our prayer. We want God to answer your prayer, our prayer. We want to hear from heaven." Now Psalm 66:18 to20 says if I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me. So people pray they say words to God but it's better whether or not God will have respect to those words. What if David had gone into excuse mode explanation mode why it happened and why this happened and how this happened? No. David killed all of that and David confessed his sins and said unto thee have I sinned created me a clean heart. I want to get out of this. I want to be cleansed. P me with hissup. So Psalm 66:18 said, "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me." But verily, God had heard me, he had attended to the voice of my prayer. Blessed be God which had not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy on me. Brother, he said, you know, as a servant of God, you ought to watch what you're doing because you are written epistles of all men. You Christians always be willing to lend a hand or to do somebody or to help somebody to make life more pleasant for them. You say, "Well, I don't have any gift of healing." You don't have to have. At least offer something. Offer prayer. Do something. Make them feel. Do the best you can by them anyhow. Never turn a shoulder, a cold shoulder to anyone, no matter what it is. Even if they mistreated you, do it anyhow. If you can't do it from your heart, then you ought to come to the altar and stay till that spirit comes into you from your heart. You can love those who doesn't love you. I want to repeat that. He said you can love those who doesn't love you. That is when God will answer your prayer. So you could tie this straight into St. Mark 11. When you stand praying, forgive if you have ought against any. So what he's saying here now he continues for as long as there's anything in your heart if and he quote the scripture if I conceive iniquity in my heart God will not hear me that is what David said and that is true he won't hear you so tonight you're hearing me on the song of my voice and you know what is going on in your heart and therefore you will have to know if you need to pray that prayer like what David did or said what David said. But you cannot just have iniquity in your heart and say you're going to pray because we have a word for you. He won't hear you. What is iniquity? Iniquity is something that you have done wrong that you know better and you ought have done it. If I conceive iniquity in my heart, God will not hear me. Let's continue. But Abraham again Jesus said, "Many will come to me that day and say, Lord, Lord, after that I cast out devils and work great mighty works and wonders in your name." He said, "Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity." What is iniquity? David said, "If I conceive iniquity in my heart, God will not hear me." Iniquity is something that you know you ought to do and you won't do. You ought to do and you won't do it. You know better, but you won't do it. It's iniquity. See, you know, they should stay with the word of God, but for the church sake or somebody else sake or something else, you will stray from the word of God and do what the organization say. Well, I don't know. My church say we should do it this way and I believe it this way. See, it's right before you and you shouldn't do it. That is iniquity. Depart from me, ye that work iniquity. All right. Psalms 139. And this is a song I used to love. Um there's a song with these words, "Search me, oh God, and know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting." And these words means that you are asking God to search you. This is when you become conscious of you and your standing with God. Search me. The song used to go, "Search me, oh God, and know my heart today. Try me, oh Savior. Know my thoughts, I pray. See if there be some wicked way in me. Cleanse me from every sin and set me free. And that was such a song that was a special song to me. Let's continue. Some time ago, a minister was preaching and there was a man who attended his church quite a lengthy time. And he came that morning up to the altar and he said, "Pastor, I now wish to give my testimony and my surrender to the Lord Jesus, which I had done last night." The pastor said, "Well, I'm sure glad to hear about that, John, to know that you have decided to finally come and give yourself to the Lord because we don't want to hurt your feelings, but we know that you have been very wicked and we know that you have mistreated your family. You're gambling with your money. You drank it up. Live a horrible life and your family went without and gives and it gives my heart joy this morning to know that you have some come forward now and going to surrender yourself to the Lord to come a different person to serve him. He said, "Thank you, pastor." He said, "I just want to ask you something. What sermon did I preach or what text did I use or what song was sung in the church in the in the hymns that made you decide to do this?" And as the man looked at him in his face with tears running off his cheeks, he said, "Pastor, it was none of your sermons do as good as they were. It was none of the choir singing or specials do as good as they were." He said, "Then would you tell this congregation why you have made this decision?" He said, "I work with a man who's a Christian and I have said everything to him. I've called him holy ruler. I call him a religious fanatic and everything didn't bother him a bit. But he lived such a life till finally in my heart all along he has won a place that I want to be like that man. And that's the reason I ask him to lead me to Christ. I want the Christ that he serves. You see God does work through the pastor to get his church ready. He works through songs to get his church ready. He works through you to get his church ready. If your pastor would fail and continues to fail, you would hunt you another pastor quickly. You would do that. If your choir didn't sing right or your solos wasn't right, you would say to the director, "The one who has the music, don't let them sing anymore. They just make me nervous to sing." But what about you as an individual? How do you feel in your daily living? How do you tally up with God? What God sees for you to be a shining light that is set on a hill. No one can pass that away when around your way without knowing about Jesus. What type of life do you live? One of those types that is mean and insulting and aggravating and indifferent. Can you speak of the peace and the love that you have found in Christ? She has made herself ready. And to that I want to give an example of this man called Abraham. And this is found in Genesis 22 where God telling this man take now thy son. Next line emphasis thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee to the land of Mariah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I tell thee of. This is Genesis 22:2. And in verse 7, Abraham head up the mountain. And verse seven, Isaac spake unto Abraham and said, "Father," he said, "my father." He said, "Here am I, my son." He said, "Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for burnt offering?" And Abraham said, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering." So they went both together. Now, I want you to look at this because I want to show you somebody that is walking in obedience, somebody is walking in submission, being submissive, somebody's walking in humility. see the results of it. They came to the place where God had told him. Abraham built an altar there, laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, laid him upon the altar upon the wood. Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham, he said, here am I. Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do anything unto him. But now I know that thou fearst God, seeing that thou wil not withheld thy son, emphasis again, thy only son from me. So God is looking to see how willing we are, how submissive we are, how subjective we are to his will, which is his word as revealed to us. Because there are things in prayer that God will speak to you and show you that you need to do, show you how you need to act or whatever. And is your subjection and submission to what God is revealing by his word is how your life will unfold. And Abraham called the name of the place watch I'll skip. And Abraham lift up his eyes and looked and a ram caught in the thicket. Verse 14 says and Abraham called the name Jehovah Gyra. It said to this day in the mount of the Lord shall be seen. The angel of the Lord called to Abraham out of heaven second time. This is God speaking again and this is God pronouncing the blessing be based upon obedience based upon submission by myself have I sworn sayeth the Lord for because here we go because thou has done this thing not talk this thing this talking thing have to stop him in a certain way we talk too much we talking talking when are we going to act and do because thou has done this thing in other words I give you instruction instructions and you follow through. Give instructions and you obeyed because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son only son that in blessing I will bless thee in multiply and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven as a sandwich upon the seashore thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy. Just one more I want to show on concern then this surrender. This is David again. Same psalm but from 15 and 17. He say oh Lord open my lips. This is verse Psalm 51 verse 15 and 17. Open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise. For thou desireest not sacrifice else I would give it. Thou delightest not in burnt offering. And then David said these words, "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. Your tough spirit has to be broken. Your intact spirit has to be broken. The sacrifices of God, a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart. Oh God, thou will not despise." Okay, let's continue. What is the opposite to this humility, submission, and obedience? What is the opposite to this? We're talking about church folks now. We're not talking about unbelievers. We're talking about you and I. We who say we believe. The opposite of humility, submission, and obedience is stubbornness, disobedience, and rebellion. And the person who reflected this the most is Saul. And this is where you see partial obedience. And this is something I never struck before, but it's something I think is very important. It's lessons that we can learn, draw from here. I don't know if I will go to this further sometime to come in the future. But in s 1st Samuel 15, after Samuel give instructions, God give instructions. Samuel coming out to Saul. Now, Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto him, hear his words. Blessed be the Lord, I will perform the commandments of the Lord. Samuel said, "What meanth this bleeting of sheep in my ear, and the luring of the oxen which I hear?" And Saul said, "And they have brought them from the Amalachites. For the people spare the best of the sheep, and the oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord by God, and the rest we have utterly destroyed." Remember what David said, "The sacrifices of God is a broken spirit, broken contrite heart. Thou will not despise." This guy Saul in partial obedience did only part. He was to slay everything utterly. And he is saying that he kept this to make a sacrifice unto the Lord. This what he kept was in disobedience to instructions given to him. Then Samuel said unto Saul, "Stay, I will tell you what the Lord had said to me this night." And he said unto him, "Say on." Samuel said unto him, "When thou was little in thy own sight." Ahu. So sometimes people start off little in their own sight and then in their own sight they get big and large. Big and large. When there was little in thy own sight, was thou not made the head of the tribe of Israel? And the Lord anointed thee king over Israel. And the Lord sent thee in a journey and said, "Go and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalachites, and fight against them till they be consumed. Wherefore then does thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but this thou fly upon the spoil and did evil in the sight of the Lord?" And Saul said unto Samuel, "Yay, I obey the voice of the Lord, and have gone the way which the Lord sent me, and have brought Aog, the king of Amalcch, and have utterly destroyed the Amalachites." But the people, now he's putting blame now. He's pointing fingers. But the people took the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgar. Samuel said, "Have the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, these were the words come to obey. To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of wrath. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou has rejected the word of the Lord, he had also rejected thee from being king. Now I know we used these scriptures before for rebellion is as a sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. But let's look at that word stubbornness. Stubbornness dictionary it's a dogged determination not to change one's attitude or position on something. They have a a a sentence. The error was sheer stubbornness in refusing to admit a mistake. Stubbornness is the quality of being determined to do what you want and refusing to do anything else or being difficult to move to change or to deal with. Stubbornness refers to the unyielding resistance to God's will. A hardness of heart that refuses correction, instruction, or submission. Stubbornness, resistance that refuses correction, instruction or submission. And you know he says many as I love I rebuke and chasen. It is also linked with rebellion and disobedience. A will that insist on its own way rather than God's. 1st Samuel 15:23. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Here stubbornness is equated with a serious sense of iniquity and idolatry. Why? because it places one's will above God's will. An interesting note here in the amplified 1st Samuel 15:23 says for rebellion is a sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is an idolatry and terapim which is household good luck images the so so in other words they are individuals there are people that put their will their desire above God as if that is a god to them so it says it like a good luck image about to close. Zechariah 7:1 11-13, but they refuse to hearken and pull away the shoulder and stopped their ears that they should not hear. Ye they have made their hearts as on a diamond stone, least they should hear the Lord, and the words from the Lord of hosts at sent in his spirit by the former prophets. Therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of hosts. Therefore it come to pass that as he cried and they would not hear. So they cried and I would not hear, say the Lord of hosts. Do you see what God said here? When the prophet cried, the people would not hear. So when time come for day to cry, God said, I will not hear. Jeremiah 7:23-28. And this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God. He shall be my people, and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you. But they hark not, nor inclined they ear, but walk, here we go, in the councils, and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward. Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt, unto this day, I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them. Yet they have not unto me or incline their ear, but harden their neck. They and they did worse than their fathers. Therefore shall thou speak all these words unto them, but they will not happen to thee. Thou shalt also call unto them, but they will not answer thee. But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord their God, nor receiveth correction. Truth is perished and is cut up cut off from their mouth. Are you the person that cannot be spoken to? Are you the type of person that nobody could correct? There are people that get upset. They don't want to get no rebuke, no instruction, no correction. They get upset. They feel people attacking them. They must say what they want to say, do what they must do, and that's leave me alone. I close with these words as they close tonight. Rebellion, stubbornness, disobedience bring judgment and ruin. Why not surrender tonight? Ask God to take away that stubbornness from you tonight. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, I thank you tonight and I believe this is a word from you to your people. David could say, "Create in me a clean heart." You told your prophet, "Be more sincere." To be more sincere, it means there must be a level of sincerity that is already dear. How much more of a heart that is not even towards you and even submitted or surrendered to you in constant sin, repeated sin, repeated attitudes, repeated behavior, repeated you know display of anger and temper, whatever. And God after a while we forget about the warnings, forget all the red lights, breaking the red lights, breaking the rules, and still believe that things going to work out fine. It can't and it won't. May this be a pause in every heart here tonight that they could say, "Search me, oh God, and know my heart." Because who really know the heart of man? Man, his heart is wicked and desperately wicked. That that's man, Lord. Who who really know what's in the heart of people? But tonight, you know, and we want to lay it all upon your altar. is a song, beautiful song that said, "Is your all on the altars of sacrifice lay in your heart? Does the spirit control you can only be blessed and have peace and sweet rest as you yield him your body and soul?" Father, we are called to live a surrendered life. I think about Cornelius, the life that he lived, a man known, giving arms, free person, sharing, giving, helping. And you so bless him. You only only bless him as an individual. You bless his whole house. This is what we want to see. Blessings upon houses, blessings upon homes, not curses, but blessings. Just as there are blessings that could be this also. But Lord, we pray tonight. We want to be like Psalms 1, a man planted. Blessed is he that walketh after the counsel of the ungodly. Oh my Christians not partaking in the counsel of me ungodly nor being a stumbling block in the way of sinners. Father God bless your people tonight as they get on in prayer. May your spirit come down and speak. Speak. May your spirit come down not for jump for joy or whatever but for a heartthirst experience where men and women get right with God. We want a church that is cleansed. A church that is hungering after righteousness. church that is walking in holiness and purity, undefiled lives, walking around the world today without a blemish. Oh God, tonight create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me. This may this be the prayer of each one here that you refresh us with your presence, we refresh us with your love. We wouldn't presume anything or take things for granted, but we would seek to wait upon you with all our hearts. Bless the ministry, Father. Bless the church. Bless the service come up this Sunday. Bless brother Isaac as he's in Ghana that your Holy Spirit will be with him to use him for your honor and your glory. And Father, may our lives be for your honor and your glory. Not for our honor, our own glory, but for your honor and your glory. As brother Gideon preached the other night. God, may it be so. As we commit this whole session into your hands, each person here, may they get a witness of your spirit tonight. May they get a special touch from you tonight. May they see this not in vain. May they not see this as a negative exhortation or negative stuff. But this is just your word. This is just your truth. Lord, David said it. A broken and contrite heart. You will not despise. You wouldn't despise brokenness tonight. You wouldn't despise people at the altar in their homes. People lay that altar in their hearts and leaning before you asking for your intervention, asking for your mercy, asking for your grace. Pass me not away from thy presence, oh God. Take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of my salvation. Renew a right spirit within me. Father, bless the people tonight. I commit their lives into their hands in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. God bless you. Thank you again for being here. And I pray trust that this will do something for you that you would search yourself. You wouldn't just want to be a church member, but you really want to be what God want you to be. God bless you as we get on in prayer tonight. Praise the Lord. Heat. Heat.

You came, you spoke to us last 20th century prophet, Lord, to point us, Lord, in the right direction with prophecy after prophecy, with promise after promise. And here we are, Lord, at the very time of the end, oh God. war everywhere just this thing just burn up oh God layer upon layer upon layer help us Lord and strengthen us Lord strengthen your sons and daughters here tonight empower them with great faith Lord you purpose that you'll have a church in the last days a glorious church without spot or wrinkle you purpose that there will be a bride of Jesus Christ that will not be deceived you purpose that the bride will come into the statue of perfect man you purpose that we would live your life and the token will be on display you are purpose it father and nothing going to cancel that or change that. And you're calling for us to have a surrendered heart and life. Father, bless the upcoming convention. Father, may your presence come down and may you be magnified and glorified. Lord, we know one day you're going to break through. That love will drop down and take all the evil out. Love will drop down and transform everything. Father, we are longing for that hour. We are being long, Father. And we are believing all the promises that you prophesied through that prophet will be fulfilled. Oh God, he saw that bride coming forth. He said, I believe that bride is called. receive into the kingdom of God. He saw the dynamics coming to the mechanics. He saw a super church. He saw the super race. He saw tremendous victory in love divine. Oh God, may your people be encouraged tonight that regardless of the ups, the downs, the trials, the test, and the tribulation. Lord, that you going to make us strong and you'll make us to stand. Oh God, you're having us to stand regardless of what that we must stand. Stand by your word. Stand by what is right. To speak what is right. To do what is right. To think what is right. To act what is right. Oh God, bless your people tonight. Strengthen your sons and daughters once again. Bless the upcoming service this coming Sunday. Bless the sick people in our midst that you would touch them and heal them. Bless the parents burden for their children. Bless the wives burden for their husbands. Husbands burden for their wives. Oh God, bless the families, Father, that have issues and challenges. May you bring a great breakthrough and deliverance. Granted, God in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. Thank you, Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I trust the Lord that you are blessed tonight. I was blessed tonight by the word and um we we we don't try to bring what we feel and what we think. We try to bring what we believe that the Lord want you to hear that that God want us to get fine-tuned. And when God asked the prophet about sincerity, be more sincere. It was finetuning that coming that to perfection, that razor edge. And we can't be blunt around the edges. We have to come to that surrender. And I believe if we have to be guided through this treacherous time we living in, we have to be led by the spirit. And that the dove can't lead a wolf. The dove can't lead stubbornness. The dove can't lead rebellion. The dove have to lead a lamb. So somewhere along the line, our spirit have to break a broken heart, a broken contrite spirit. We are too strong in ourselves, too strong with our own wills and our own desires and what we think and what we feel. And we so uh quick to say what we feel and what we think and everything else. But I realize as we get into that mastery, as we get into that perfection, there'll be more temperance, there'll be more control, there'll be evidence that it is soaking in and it's getting part of you now that you cannot do your own thing, say what you want, uh go where you want, act however you want. It cannot be like that. So, God bless you. Thanks again for being here tonight and and have a good evening. God bless.
