[46:09] you may be seasoned yeah
[46:12] what want you tired of you us Philip
[46:15] enough yeah you're tired enough for
[46:17] yourself when you get fed up here do
[46:19] something the other bridge last week
[46:21] your faith is expressed by your works
[46:23] when you get tired enough and you start
[46:26] to have faith in God then you're gonna
[46:28] see words towards that God NER before
[46:32] eternity I wanna read a scripture for
[46:35] Matthew 17 you'd have to find it I just
[46:37] read it from 14 to 21 oh when they were
[46:40] come to the multitude they came to him
[46:42] at a sitting man kneeling down to him
[46:44] saying lord have mercy on my son for
[46:47] he's a lunatic so vexed for off times he
[46:50] falls into the fire and often to the
[46:53] water and I brought him to the disciples
[46:54] and they could not kill him then jesus
[46:57] answered and said o faithless and
[47:01] perverse generation how long shall I be
[47:03] with you how long shall I suffer you
[47:06] bring him is it to me
[47:08] and Jesus rebuked the devil and he
[47:14] departed out of him and the child was
[47:16] cured from Nigeria then came the
[47:20] disciples the Jesus the father said why
[47:22] could we not cast him out I like that
[47:25] they say how this thing I working on
[47:27] what we're going on here Jesus earned
[47:29] them because of your unbelief for verily
[47:33] I say unto you if you have feet as a
[47:37] grain of mustard seed you shall see
[47:42] under this mountain remove hence the
[47:44] Younger place it shall remove and
[47:46] nothing shall be impossible unto you
[47:50] howbeit this kind goeth not out but by
[47:54] fasting and praying so jesus used to
[47:57] fast and pray what are you doing
[48:02] he had works with his feet because he
[48:05] had demons to challenge but a man said
[48:07] sometimes angry Mazda Castle use a
[48:09] common terrorism afterwards Oh
[48:11] hallelujah it's spiritual warfare fear
[48:13] friends amen praise God
[48:16] umberto Burnham spoke on a message
[48:19] hybrid religion he's talking about
[48:20] hybrid feet
[48:22] but corn hybrid a mule is hybrid and
[48:25] chicken is hybrid and whatnot but
[48:27] Genesis said let every seed bring forth
[48:29] after its kind
[48:30] so God wanted things to remain original
[48:33] and when God created his church he
[48:36] created a Pentecostal church that was
[48:38] your original church our Pentecostal
[48:40] church filled with the Holy Ghost and
[48:42] men and woman were led by the Spirit of
[48:44] God man couldn't leave it alone
[48:46] he wanted a hybrid Church said I bring
[48:48] theology and doctrine and might just
[48:50] return your church and we got buildings
[48:53] and scholarships and it went further
[48:54] from God but that wasn't God's plan in
[48:57] the beginning he never sent one of them
[48:59] to seminary he sent an upper room to
[49:02] wait there until the Holy Ghost came
[49:04] upon them to be ordained ministers of
[49:07] the Lord but I Britian bring bringing in
[49:10] overseers and bishops and when the Holy
[49:13] Spirit is called original leader of the
[49:15] church so the Holy Ghost is most who
[49:18] supposed to have the preeminence is
[49:19] isn't that right thank you Lord Jesus
[49:23] so the life so the hybrid cord cannot
[49:25] reproduce itself the life isn't right in
[49:28] high Britain and God wants it the way
[49:30] he's made in the beginning so the church
[49:32] has been hybrid now we come to a place
[49:34] where the church is more like a lodge
[49:36] done a Pentecostal blessing my my my my
[49:39] praise be to Jesus it can't cross itself
[49:44] back but when a green was first planted
[49:45] the second please you hybrid it the
[49:48] first thing you know it never come back
[49:50] an ox a nice collar any church that
[49:53] leave it's from original foundation has
[49:55] never been able to come back again when
[49:58] Lootera revival scriptable
[50:00] he organized the hybrid gone Wesley same
[50:03] thing I breathe in you know Eve was the
[50:05] mother of I Breeden so that is why the
[50:08] blood is important that is why Jesus
[50:11] died he died to introduce his blood to
[50:13] correct the high Breeden
[50:17] did you get that we end up being hybrid
[50:20] born in sin though stand a chance but
[50:24] Jesus blood come to correct that to
[50:28] bring us from unbelief into fate
[50:31] [Applause]
[50:32] [Music]
[50:35] so the highway so therefore when
[50:37] somebody take what the Bible says and
[50:39] what man say it makes a hybrid feet I
[50:41] went to do that it makes a beautiful
[50:42] church but no life in it uh-huh
[50:45] so you never got much in life then yes
[50:47] it has to come back to the life
[50:49] so God said no good stay away from it it
[50:51] is evil it brings don'ts maybe I'll go
[50:54] and get heal maybe the Lord will heal me
[50:56] that's hybrid feet it's no good
[50:57] that's church feet we want God's feet
[51:00] God feet is God says something that stay
[51:03] with it my strike I'm here stay with it
[51:06] Jesus said if you are faint like a
[51:07] mustard seed why did he say that because
[51:09] you cannot mix anything and mustard seed
[51:12] you can't I breathe it it's original or
[51:16] glory to God God you promised me a
[51:18] breakthrough I'm expecting it this

[57:27] God when you begin to understand that be
[57:30] small as are you I would only say you
[57:35] have seniority to the devil because he
[57:38] only come in the beginning but he was
[57:40] before the beginning and you after that
[57:42] revelation that you have see you as
[57:44] seniority he is your junior he should be

[59:01] died that he might breathe back varam
[59:05] say hallelujah only the blood can do
[59:08] that only to the chemistry of the blood
[59:10] Jesus Christ can breed back a person
[59:14] that's one theory from what God said Eve
[59:18] showed weakness the church should what
[59:21] she did she said well maybe you're right
[59:22] maybe God would wholly responsible who
[59:25] knows what difference does it make as
[59:26] long as I'm baptized what if it doesn't
[59:28] make it snow that shows you need another
[59:30] Breeden that shows that something's got
[59:32] to come back to you to bring you to our
[59:34] feet that what God said not one
[59:38] just--all not one touch tittle shall
[59:39] pass over God's Word till all be
[59:41] fulfilled let every man would be alive
