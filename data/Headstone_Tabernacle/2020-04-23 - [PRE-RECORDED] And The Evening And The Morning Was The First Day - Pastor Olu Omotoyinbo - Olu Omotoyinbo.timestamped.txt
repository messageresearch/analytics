[37:04] let's send off Jeffrey let's let me read
[37:06] my scriptures if you have a bob was
[37:09] lucky invite attention to Genesis
[37:10] chapter 1 and our versions of a 12 and
[37:14] Leviticus 23 Genesis chapter 1 read
[37:20] verse 2 through verse 5 and that's where
[37:23] I get my charter from this morning Judge
[37:28] super 1 begin to read from verse 2 and
[37:34] the earth was without form and void and
[37:37] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[37:39] and the Spirit of God moved upon the
[37:41] face of the waters and God said let
[37:45] there be light and there was light and
[37:48] goes to the light that was good and God
[37:51] divided the light from the darkness and
[37:53] God called the light day and the
[37:56] darkness he called night and the evening
[37:59] and the morning were the first day as
[38:02] well my title is from Matata and the
[38:04] evening and the morning were the first
[38:07] day
[38:08] Amen let's go right back to your
[38:12] revelation from Genesis right down to
[38:15] Revelation in chapter 12 and this began
[38:18] about the war in heaven arre verse 7
[38:21] through verse 11
[38:28] and we have the marker you can go to
[38:30] Leviticus 23 verse 33 through 36
[38:34] provision 12 re from verse 7 and there
[38:39] was wine in heaven
[38:40] Michael and his angels fought against
[38:42] the Dragon and the dragon fought and his
[38:44] angels and prevailed not neither was
[38:47] their place found any more in heaven and
[38:49] the Great Dragon was cast out that old
[38:52] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[38:54] deceives the whole world he was cast out
[38:57] into the earth and his angels were cast
[38:58] out with him and I heard a loud voice
[39:00] saying in heaven now is come salvation
[39:02] and strength and the Kingdom of our God
[39:06] and the power of his Christ for the
[39:08] accuser of our brethren is cast down
[39:10] which accused them before our God day
[39:12] and night and they overcame him by the
[39:15] blood of the Lamb and by the word of the
[39:16] testimony and they loved not their lives
[39:18] unto the death
[39:21] finally our thin scripture for the
[39:25] convention Leviticus chapter 23 verse 33
[39:32] through verse 36 and the Lord speaking
[39:35] to Moses saying speak on to the tune of
[39:37] Israel saying the fifteenth day of this

[51:58] convocation I mean in Nigeria and in in
[52:01] the I don't know about after Africa but
[52:04] in West Africa generally when
[52:05] universities and colleges do their
[52:07] degree award programs the coil like a
[52:10] convocation like a convocation is a an
[52:12] assembly a large assembly way a lot of
[52:15] people gather may be our words and
[52:17] rewards are gonna be given out where
[52:20] people are gathered together I know the
[52:21] Americans college commencement
[52:22] ceremonies I don't know what they call
[52:24] it here but that's a convocation where
[52:27] people are gathered together is a coming
[52:29] together of people and these are holy
[52:32] convocation and it's an eighth day holy
[52:35] convocation so it's a bit specific now
[52:38] what happens in a convocation the Bible
[52:40] lets us know that the Bible lets us see
[52:42] that because 23 we read let's just see
[52:44] what happens in a convocation and follow
[52:47] me this morning
[52:47] the preachers already preached the word
[52:49] so I'm just going to you know add my I
[52:53] put my sled the wheels or the Jesus said
[52:56] is a long-running preacher I don't think
[52:59] you can take that title from me but I
[53:00] just don't even try
[53:03] don't try I'm wrong and whiny sometimes
[53:06] and one other but the old what is wrong
[53:08] with you what are you even saying so I
[53:11] just pray for me that I don't I don't be
[53:13] end up in long and winding today but
[53:15] I'll try I'll try but no what happens in
[53:18] a convocation we all want you to know
[53:20] what happens in convocation then we know
[53:21] what we are looking for here we know
[53:23] what we're supposed to be what we're
[53:25] supposed to be looking for here and we
[53:26] can with
[53:27] yes go for it amen
[53:30] in the convocation from everything else
[53:32] I just try to you know see as I go along
[53:35] what happens the convocation got to
[53:38] Moses gather people together 15 the
[53:41] other seventh month I think the first
[53:43] one is April so this would be like the
[53:44] fifteenth of October which was the
[53:47] seventh month and gather people together
[53:48] for an assembly and seven days they will
[53:53] have this assembly and on the eighth day
[53:56] is that the frost day will be a holy
[53:58] convocation to you and you shall do no
[54:01] servile work therein is not a suggestion
[54:03] is not an idea is a command you shall do
[54:08] no servile work therein amen and every
[54:12] single day of those are seven days the
[54:15] first day and then at seven more days
[54:17] you shall have a holy convocation amen
[54:22] and then on the eighth day will be
[54:25] similar to the first day and on that day
[54:27] he added some more instructions to it
[54:30] instead you do no servile work but he
[54:32] also said a man is a solemn assembly now
[54:36] this is solemn not as in morning is
[54:38] insulin as in serious it'll soon a
[54:41] machine is not a place with it don't
[54:43] take it lightly
[54:44] don't take this assembly lightly we are
[54:46] here for for serious business when I'm
[54:50] here it's not a solemn assembly like
[54:52] somebody has died and we are mourning no
[54:54] it's a serious assembly when I play more
[54:57] games here
[54:58] that's why we call this assembly or it
[55:01] Oh God
[55:02] amen kinetic on my jacket or a glory of
[55:06] God a man a man may be seated
[55:13] amen so he said it said it's a solemn
[55:17] assembly number one number two he said
[55:21] you shall offer an offering unto the
[55:25] Lord who is wanting to offer an offering
[55:28] but you qualify the offering it says you
[55:31] shall often often made by fire unto the
[55:34] Lord consumer is not hallelujah
[55:37] like for example we said can I have a
[55:39] shot in the house then I can hear you
[55:42] can have a shot in the house a man you
[55:46] may be seated
[55:47] and often meant by fire a man we put
[55:51] some fire under the offering a man a man
[55:54] glory to God a man you may be seated
[55:59] when you often often put some finding
[56:03] that makes it a sacrifice amen
[56:06] and you know the only person that offers
[56:09] is sacrifice to the Lord is a priest
[56:12] amen
[56:13] so in this holy convocation here you
[56:16] come here with the recognition that you
[56:18] are a priest unto the Lord to have your
[56:20] offering your sacrifice to offer to God
[56:23] hallelujah glory to God amen amen
[56:28] come on you priests of the Lord amen you
[56:31] maybe see that amen amen
[56:35] [Applause]
[56:36] now let's talk a little bit about this
[56:38] let's talk a little bit about this
[56:40] preach priesthood let's talk about it
[56:41] about this mission here because you know
[56:44] a priest offers a sacrifice unto the
[56:46] Lord so when God says each one of the
[56:49] house full of easel each one of us here
[56:51] will offer an offer made by five to the
[56:54] Lord is a recognition that we are and
[56:58] doesn't the public say we are kings and
[57:00] priests unto the Lord and we shall reign
[57:02] on the earth
[57:03] so something letting you understand how
[57:05] we run about a time
[57:07] tell me letting you understand this is
[57:10] what is this what this whole equation is
[57:11] about to tell me to get on my hip you
[57:14] are a priest unto the Lord you are a
[57:16] king unto the Lord
[57:17] you've got power you got Authority you
[57:19] got Dominion that's what God told way to
[57:22] tell the people get out of your ass here
[57:24] get up your money spots
[57:26] hallelujah stand on your feet you are
[57:29] gonna offer an offering made by fire do
[57:31] i apprec-- come on you priests of the
[57:33] Lord hallelujah
[57:35] or a glory look garden man amen amen
[57:42] you may be seated and then every priest
[57:47] is known body often or sulphides the
[57:51] office now Jesus Christ our Lord is
[57:56] called the high priest of our confession
[57:59] in other words what he trusted God is
[58:04] our confession he takes our confession
[58:07] and offer to God that's high becomes the
[58:11] high priest of our confession
[58:13] whatever we confess he offers you to
[58:16] thought and the happiest make sure to
[58:19] make sure you make sure we get whatever
[58:21] we confess hallelujah so in this holy
[58:28] convocation here you are going to get
[58:30] what you confess
[58:31] [Music]
[58:35] your confession is your sacrifice your
[58:38] confession is your sacrifice and
[58:40] whatsoever you convinced they have pre
[58:42] stands there to offer to God hallelujah
[58:45] and that's why in this only complication
[58:47] here there's no negative talk like
[58:49] whether it was selling last night
[58:50] there's no weakness
[58:51] there's no I can't les no he's not
[58:53] working out no sir whatsoever you
[58:56] convinced the high priest exit to the
[58:58] Lord be careful be careful what you're
[59:03] saying because your high priest is just
[59:05] gonna make sure you get what you what
[59:07] you asked for
[59:08] amen hallelujah hallelujah
[59:12] so this holy convocation here the high
[59:16] priest God is making sure our speech is
[59:20] gonna change our attitude is gonna
[59:23] change everything is gonna change
[59:26] we're gonna defy everything else where
[59:29] there is weakness when it is a Lord I'm
[59:32] so weak everything is all going wrong
[59:33] for me that's your confession
[59:36] that's your sacrifice you are bringing
[59:37] and that's what the high priest takes to
[59:39] the Lord be careful now because they
[59:42] have presets as you are setting mine
[59:44] ears
[59:44] so will I do unto you amen hallelujah a
[59:49] holy convocation Oh glory to God amen
[59:55] amen amen amen amen oh brother joy good
[59:59] to see you
[59:59] wanna see a long time no see a catchin
[1:00:02] fellowship we have some little
[1:00:03] fellowship oversee catch and fellowship

[1:00:23] you know and his remaining you remain
[1:00:25] faithful in the house of God ever since
[1:00:27] amen
[1:00:28] so anyway so this holy convocation here
[1:00:31] those four things are supposed to happen
[1:00:34] it gotten together of the people because
[1:00:36] it's sembly son assembly is a serious
[1:00:39] hour enough for people who are not made
[1:00:42] up in their minds to just go not for
[1:00:45] people who are you know just loitering
[1:00:46] around and lollygagging around or not
[1:00:49] for people who you have to tell them

[1:01:02] call the assembly and tell them this is
[1:01:05] the work of the Lord to them and each
[1:01:07] person was gonna sit up and get on the
[1:01:10] horse I know it tippy-toe message is no
[1:01:13] time to fool around here it's time to
[1:01:15] cut off every foolishness it's time to

[1:31:18] let's go through it back to China now to
[1:31:20] find out what this whole equation one
[1:31:23] really until because that was when I was
[1:31:24] in heaven when all of God's children
[1:31:26] gathered together and shouted for joy
[1:31:29] that solemn serious assembly it was
[1:31:33] serious because the destructor was there
[1:31:35] there was there trying to cause some
[1:31:38] disruption some destruction amen
[1:31:41] glory to God in Romans 8 open your
[1:31:56] Bibles
[1:32:10] Oh
[1:32:21] Romans 8:9 refers 28 and we know that
[1:32:26] all things work together for good to
[1:32:28] them that love God to them who are the
[1:32:30] called according to his purpose we're
[1:32:33] trying to trace these only converge on
[1:32:34] to the original holy convocation try to
[1:32:38] show you what the holy Commission did an
[1:32:40] establish in the Garden of Eden
[1:32:42] the eighth day hula competition and Adam
[1:32:45] lit in an Eden amen and I'm a church son
[1:32:49] of God
[1:32:50] they spend this power and authority of
[1:32:52] heaven on the face of the earth and God
[1:32:55] come down and create it and unveil of
[1:32:58] this holy convocation but let's go back
[1:33:00] and see what's all about where y'all
[1:33:02] started from so you could know how to
[1:33:04] apply this in your own life
[1:33:10] thank you very moment 8 verse 28 and we
[1:33:17] know that all things work together for
[1:33:19] good to them that love God who are the
[1:33:20] called according to his purpose we keep
[1:33:22] the time of my time here I'm doing very
[1:33:24] well
[1:33:25] all right for whom he did foreknow he
[1:33:27] also did predestinate what was what now
[1:33:29] who may live for know them he also did
[1:33:32] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:33:34] image of his son that he might be the
[1:33:36] firstborn among many brethren the
[1:33:39] firstborn among many brethren the first
[1:33:42] point among many brethren moreover who
[1:33:44] made it less innate then he also called
[1:33:46] and whom he called then he also
[1:33:47] justified and whom he justified them he
[1:33:49] also glorified in those two verses we
[1:33:52] found the whole Gospel story amen maybe
[1:33:54] see the please let's cause a little bit
[1:33:56] here
[1:33:58] in those two verses amen we find
[1:34:02] foreknowledge we find election we find
[1:34:05] predestination we find destiny brother
[1:34:09] Branham said foreknowledge looks back to
[1:34:12] you
[1:34:12] I mean lecture looks back to for
[1:34:15] knowledge our predestination looks
[1:34:17] forward to destiny and this scripture
[1:34:20] area is very common scripture very
[1:34:21] populous conforms explains those to you
[1:34:23] and I a man named and I'm gonna show you
[1:34:26] in a minute just what it's all about
[1:34:28] Romans 8:29 for whom indeed for know
[1:34:31] from for whom it is norm
[1:34:34] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:34:38] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:34:40] the firstborn among many presidents so
[1:34:42] what comes forth is the foreknowledge is
[1:34:45] what comes forth elohim running all
[1:34:48] alone by himself we always talk about
[1:34:51] the bad part of a long hymns mind the
[1:34:54] bad part of elohim is mine and if that's
[1:34:56] the back pad that's a food pad doesn't
[1:35:00] that make sense
[1:35:01] can you say Amen can I get a shot in the
[1:35:04] house because the back pad there is a
[1:35:07] firm pants now on the back part of a
[1:35:10] know his mind was his attributes he's
[1:35:13] been who is that was the premise of our
[1:35:16] thoughts that think in our spirit on the
[1:35:21] platter of his mind but in the front pad
[1:35:24] that's where the foreknowledge is the
[1:35:29] foreknowledge they note the prior
[1:35:31] knowledge the knowing before it happens
[1:35:36] amen and the full knowledge of Elohim if
[1:35:44] he was God he had to know the beginning
[1:35:47] from the end he had to know it all
[1:35:50] before it ever happened at all and many
[1:35:55] many men election looks back so for
[1:35:59] knowledge the phone Allah comes first
[1:36:01] and in the for knowledge Elohim knew
[1:36:04] everything the funnel-like wasn't on him
[1:36:06] the back pad was him the phone was just
[1:36:09] his knowledge of war was gonna be on the
[1:36:11] face of the earth from Eden Roc but to
[1:36:13] Ethan again
[1:36:15] in there in the foreknowledge he knew
[1:36:19] what was gonna be he knew every life
[1:36:21] that be on the face of the earth like
[1:36:22] put something he knew every fly and how
[1:36:24] many times oh but it's I he knew
[1:36:26] everything he knew every happened every
[1:36:30] seat every play that I'll be on the face
[1:36:32] on the earth like but the ritual has it
[1:36:34] yesterday
[1:36:34] he knew brother Paul wasn't gonna be
[1:36:36] here and as he won't take his place in
[1:36:38] the full knowledge he knew everything in
[1:36:43] the front knowledge he knew every sin
[1:36:45] every field every ungodliness that will
[1:36:48] ever take miss on the face of the earth
[1:36:49] in the for knowledge so you know the
[1:36:52] foreknowledge is not him
[1:36:54] that's not he's thinking just what he
[1:36:56] knows
[1:36:58] [Applause]
[1:37:04] no you didn't hear me human Ishida you
[1:37:06] didn't hear me
[1:37:06] no II did not hear me you maybe see that
[1:37:09] the foreknowledge when God told Adam
[1:37:20] have you ever thought God told Adam be
[1:37:24] fruitful and multiply
[1:37:26] Adam was an amateur caught on the face
[1:37:28] of the earth he was ruling this out in
[1:37:31] the place of God himself
[1:37:33] yet when Adam sinned unfair God said
[1:37:38] when he drove the man I said less than
[1:37:41] man put forth his hand and take also the
[1:37:44] tree of life and become as one of us
[1:37:47] knowing good and evil
[1:37:51] in a lot come on now I thought you said
[1:37:54] Adam was an amateur god like you on the
[1:37:56] face of the earth so how come God's
[1:38:01] saying bless the man come and become
[1:38:04] like one of us knowing good and evil is
[1:38:08] that for knowledge but the foreknowledge
[1:38:11] that's where the pradhans where your
[1:38:13] problem is that's where your problem is
[1:38:16] that's where my problem is that's where
[1:38:19] the prime of the human risk is that's
[1:38:23] what the four colors into to know good
[1:38:26] and evil to try to become God when we
[1:38:31] are not when we haven't gone through the
[1:38:33] processes to know how to handle good and
[1:38:37] evil and God can Adam from it because -
[1:38:40] before it will get back again here to go
[1:38:43] through the process is take a tutoring a
[1:38:46] care training before I will become like
[1:38:49] God again on the face of the earth
[1:38:52] hallelujah glory to talk for the phone
[1:39:01] knowledge that's where the problem is at
[1:39:02] you may be seated
[1:39:06] and that's where the devil deceives many
[1:39:09] many young people in particular but also
[1:39:12] older folks like me like a dads and moms
[1:39:16] the foreknowledge firstly you the family
[1:39:21] wasn't God the back pad was caught
[1:39:24] that's where you were hidden that's
[1:39:27] where your thought your gene your
[1:39:30] representation but we just mention in
[1:39:32] the Elohim was in the back pad of his
[1:39:34] mind but the foreknowledge but knew

[1:57:43] this challenge like a man so he had a
[1:57:48] response and that's we're going to see
[1:57:50] the different part of the book of life
[1:57:51] and go see the Elohim kept you there
[1:57:54] [Applause]
[1:57:56] he's very Tanner a section in the Lamb's
[1:57:59] Book of Life and what happened
[1:58:03] Lucifer fraud he went run run heaven
[1:58:08] with his tail like butter brahms a tail
[1:58:11] gee al I wasn't English language tal tal
[1:58:16] II live with words when we tell to tell
[1:58:20] tales on God and got some to believe and
[1:58:26] the Bible said he deceived it's a
[1:58:31] deception you know what you never did in
[1:58:34] the first place even Paul said Paul said
[1:58:37] Paul said Paul said Paul said but if I
[1:58:43] do therefore that which I wouldn't want
[1:58:44] to do is there is no longer I that do it
[1:58:48] it's that but sin that deceived me
[1:58:52] [Music]
[1:58:55] since that's working in my members it
[1:58:58] was responsible but where you have a
[1:59:04] knowledge and an honest telling of the
[1:59:07] book from the back of elohim's mind your
[1:59:10] mind is enlightened and the devil can
[1:59:14] deceive you normal Adam wasn't deceived
[1:59:18] sure can get the spot where he can
[1:59:21] deceive you normal so anyway he went
[1:59:24] around and did you teach applause ape
[1:59:27] safari cast in the church against this
[1:59:31] one against now when the case is won
[1:59:32] against that one we're getting ready for
[1:59:35] this holy convocation and the devil is
[1:59:38] going around there instead of a war in
[1:59:42] heaven a war in the church up in heaven
[1:59:46] and if fraught and my killer
[1:59:51] representing Jesus Christ wouldn't stand
[1:59:53] for the logos wouldn't stand for it he
[1:59:56] didn't start the fight we don't study
[1:59:58] fight but we never run from a fight
[2:00:00] no we never run from a fight hallelujah
[2:00:04] a microphone and Lucifer fought and
[2:00:07] Micah for a Lucifer fraud long story
[2:00:10] short over seven judge edges this war
[2:00:14] went on and at the end of the war what
[2:00:18] happened one-third of the angels were
[2:00:22] deceived by Lucifer Michael said I won't
[2:00:26] have this hear you through the matter
[2:00:28] heaven keep them out of here that's the
[2:00:32] power in the kingdom kick them out so as
[2:00:35] you have the power to kick him out of
[2:00:37] your life
[2:00:40] so what happened what happened one
[2:00:44] thought was kicked out of heaven and
[2:00:47] there I meant two thoughts a revelation
[2:00:50] there one thought
[2:00:53] two thoughts means there are three
[2:00:54] groups here that's what it means means
[2:00:58] there are three groups here one group
[2:01:03] was kicked out and one group was from
[2:01:12] the Batman versus other group here we
[2:01:14] don't know where they're coming from but
[2:01:19] the panel said there are four hats to
[2:01:21] look of life one path is not even
[2:01:24] written at all because forever O Lord
[2:01:28] the what is said in heaven all that
[2:01:31] happen in the beginning when Elohim or
[2:01:35] muffin - the logos and created angels
[2:01:37] all throughout that's all that has been
[2:01:41] happened on the face of the earth it was
[2:01:42] previewed before the foundation of the
[2:01:46] world and that's what has been happening
[2:01:48] and got preview there the fourth group
[2:01:52] serpent seed God has nothing to do with
[2:01:54] them their record is not there at all
[2:02:00] but this is the form on that plane out
[2:02:02] now in this form ology every life is
[2:02:06] their exhibition see you are there those
[2:02:10] working that are there and there is
[2:02:12] other mysterious group also is there
[2:02:14] amen
[2:02:15] so there are three groups there he has
[2:02:19] seen you and take you out of there and
[2:02:21] put you on the back of his mind
[2:02:23] so you're one group other group - its -
[2:02:27] with Lucifer and they were kicked out
[2:02:29] that's like the bottom line believers
[2:02:31] but when believers who almost mean
[2:02:37] hormones come in and the case of life
[2:02:41] they got deceived like Judas come to the
[2:02:46] borders
[2:02:48] and back off but there's this other
[2:02:53] group who was not deceived they are not
[2:02:56] from the back part of elohim's mind but
[2:02:59] why don't you see it who are they
[2:03:01] the foolish virgins the foolish virgins
[2:03:05] they are not they are not elected to
[2:03:06] being the bride so they're not from the
[2:03:07] background well in Texas or Lucifer
[2:03:11] religious Christian people good people
[2:03:14] good people they didn't get kicked out
[2:03:17] they didn't take the names out of the
[2:03:19] book when it costs for people deceived
[2:03:24] by you know our Robertson these are the
[2:03:30] different many coastal groups and you
[2:03:32] know we have many of them in Nigeria
[2:03:34] remember here so many of them know who
[2:03:36] have been taught to believe that they
[2:03:38] can live worldly and still have Jesus
[2:03:42] who have been taught to believe that
[2:03:44] they love God in their hearts they sad
[2:03:49] with God but they are not predestinated
[2:03:52] to be in the bright the foolish virgins
[2:03:56] I will take a chance are the great white
[2:03:58] throne judgment clinton's a life and
[2:04:02] another group also there is the Matthew
[2:04:05] 25 group they also did not excites they
[2:04:09] from this second group mysterious group
[2:04:12] I wasn't kicked out there was not a
[2:04:15] bright there they were the foolish
[2:04:26] virgins religious people
[2:04:28] another group amen Matthew 25 the Sheep
[2:04:32] nations who do good things to the bride
[2:04:39] who are gonna receive eternal life
[2:04:42] because their goodness to the people of
[2:04:44] culture
[2:04:46] and then also the 144 thousand fun part
[2:04:50] of this group here that's all that's
[2:04:52] gonna be that's a second group they
[2:04:54] didn't take sides with Lucifer but one
[2:04:56] obviously to be in the bright these good
[2:04:59] people do things that the people in the
[2:05:02] brand are supposed to do but they will
[2:05:03] never do people in the message rather as
[2:05:05] possible never - so what do you have
[2:05:13] three groups the bride the foolish
[2:05:18] virgins group on the borderline
[2:05:20] believers the Valen believers what
[2:05:22] kicked out so we have the two thoughts
[2:05:25] the bright the foolish virgins the stood
[2:05:31] with Michael all glory what if I was
[2:05:41] kicked out of heaven LM was done then
[2:05:46] now the book of life could be written
[2:05:49] and expressed and after the one heaven
[2:05:51] the book of life was written and
[2:05:52] expressed and forever Oh Lord
[2:05:55] the war is settled and written and
[2:05:58] expressed in heaven or glory they caught
[2:06:01] him and and they're there you saw the
[2:06:06] pride of God saw Lucifer kicked out so
[2:06:10] the capstone couple of different level
[2:06:12] of their lives saw them growing into the
[2:06:15] image of the Son of God there was a
[2:06:17] shout in heaven a shadow victory like
[2:06:20] never before
[2:06:22] and that's where the first holy
[2:06:24] convocation took place
[2:06:25] that's that where the Eternity holy
[2:06:28] convocation took place it was read it
[2:06:30] was celebrating a victory it was
[2:06:32] celebrating a deliverance who was
[2:06:34] helping a victory over Satan over
[2:06:36] Lucifer and all his works
[2:06:38] Oh glory to God

[2:06:47] brother amen
[2:06:49] Oh Gloria so what happened now what
[2:06:55] happened now

[2:07:00] the same product came down on day one I
[2:07:03] said let there be light there was
[2:07:06] darkness representing like Lucifer again
[2:07:08] let there be light and there was light
[2:07:11] and the power separated the light from
[2:07:15] the darkness they can co-exist together
[2:07:17] in the holy convocation darkness cannot
[2:07:21] coexist with light in a holy convocation
[2:07:23] the scene and the porch we cannot live
[2:07:27] in your life they cannot do it amen the
