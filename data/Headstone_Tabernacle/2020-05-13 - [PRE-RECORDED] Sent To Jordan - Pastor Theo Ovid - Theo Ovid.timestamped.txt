[12:24] you but I'll be with you even in you
[12:28] have you all the way this morning Jesus
[12:31] we ask it came enema be seated
[12:34] so we want to go into the scriptures
[12:37] second kings to want to read two verses
[12:39] there was 506
[12:41] and
[12:44] we one of reads in John 15:1 to eat and
[12:48] send John 12
[12:54] as in John 12 22 24 okay
[12:59] second Kings chapter two
[13:02] verse five and six
[13:07] and the sons of the prophets that were
[13:10] Jericho came delecia and said unto Him
[13:12] knowest dumb that the Lord will take
[13:14] away thy master from my head today on
[13:17] the unsaid he I know it wholly of peace
[13:20] and Elijah said unto him Terry I pray
[13:23] thee here for the Lord had sent me to
[13:25] Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth as
[13:28] I so live it I was not leave thee and
[13:30] thereto went on so in John chapter 15
[13:34] verse 1 I am The True Vine my father is
[13:38] the husbandman every branch in me that
[13:40] beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and
[13:43] every branch bear fruit he purchased it
[13:45] that it may bring forth more fruit now
[13:49] you are clean through the word that I've
[13:50] spoken unto you abide in me and I in you
[13:54] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[13:57] itself except it abide in the vine no
[13:59] more can ye except ye abide in me I am
[14:03] the vine and ya two branches he's it
[14:07] abideth in me and I in him the same
[14:09] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[14:12] you can do nothing if he a man abide not
[14:14] in me he is cast forth as a branch on
[14:17] his withered and men gather them and
[14:19] cast them into the fire and that burn if
[14:21] ye abide in me and my words abide in you
[14:23] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[14:26] be done unto you herein is my father
[14:28] glorified that you bear much fruit so
[14:31] shall you be my disciples st. John
[14:34] chapter 12 when I read from verse 20
[14:40] and there were certain Greeks among them
[14:43] that came up to worship at the feast the
[14:46] same came therefore to Philip which was
[14:48] abysses of Galilee desired him seen so
[14:51] we would see Jesus and Philip commit and
[14:54] tell it Andrew and again Andrew and
[14:56] Philip tell Jesus jesus answered them
[14:58] saying they always come at the Son of
[15:01] man should be glorified
[15:02] verily verily I say unto you except a
[15:06] corner we'd fall into the ground and die
[15:07] it abideth on but if it die it bringeth
[15:10] forth much fruit let's bow heads once
[15:13] more father we thank you for your
[15:15] presence and we pray that you would come
[15:16] along in your word speak life speak to
[15:19] our hearts transform us even as we wait
[15:21] on you in Jesus and we ask it Amen on
[15:24] Eamon you may be seated or praise the
[15:26] name of the Lord
[15:30] notice the cry in every age he that hath
[15:35] an ear to hear let him hear
[15:39] the group was never addressed a
[15:42] bunch of people was never addressed it
[15:45] has always been to the individual so
[15:49] this Redemption message is not to a
[15:51] group or to a church or to a
[15:54] denomination or organization it's to the
[15:57] individual so this morning a title sent
[16:01] to Jordan
[16:03] another subject the debt of a corn of
[16:06] wheat a
[16:08] corn of wheat
[16:10] hallelujah not corn the corn
[16:13] that's you
[16:15] that's the individual
[16:18] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[16:21] and I got that text from the Scripture
[16:24] we read where Elijah told Elijah tarry
[16:28] here for the Lord had sent me to Jordan
[16:32] he was sent to Jordan it represents that
[16:38] being sent to die you don't bury a green
[16:43] seed you bury a right Lucy a mature seed
[16:48] so once you become ripe
[16:51] sure you are being made ready to be sent
[16:56] to Jordan not the church you not
[17:01] everybody you
[17:04] ready amends them alright
[17:07] you didn't end the show this morning you
[17:09] had a shot you know because this is this
[17:12] is the word now Oh hallelujah praise the
[17:15] name of the Lord from the resume of the
[17:18] ages what about
[17:20] from our studies we have already learned
[17:23] that much of the revelation is totally
[17:25] misunderstood because we have not
[17:27] formally known the truth spoken of and
[17:30] spoken to in this book nor does it refer
[17:34] to the pure ecclesia the elect the body
[17:37] of Christ the bride listen but it speaks
[17:40] to the entire body of people who are
[17:43] called Christians
[17:44] whether they are true or merely nominal
[17:48] as all Israel is not Israel so all
[17:52] Christians are not Christians thus we
[17:55] learn that the church is made up of two
[17:57] vines the true and the force the two
[18:02] vines have you are motivated by two
[18:05] kinds of spirit one is the holy spirit
[18:09] while the other is endued with the
[18:12] spirit of the Antichrist yet danger CH
[18:16] both claim to know and be known of God
[18:19] both purport to speak for God both
[18:24] believe certain very basic truths and
[18:27] define others but since both bear the
[18:31] name of the Lord being watch called
[18:35] Christians and by such name Biron
[18:38] obviously claim a relationship to him
[18:42] God calls it marriage
[18:45] God now holds them both responsible to
[18:48] him and therefore speaks to each because
[18:51] of their claim God speaking to all are
[18:54] you with me we further learned that
[18:57] these two vines were grow side by side
[18:59] until the end of the ages here we go
[19:01] when both would come to purity and both
[19:04] will be harvested the false vine listen
[19:08] carefully would not overcome and destroy
[19:12] the true vine that's out of it that have
[19:16] no provision for that God didn't make no
[19:19] provision for no false line to destroy
[19:21] true vine that's not going to happen oh
[19:24] could be here gets out in that one and
[19:28] then neither would a true vine be able
[19:32] to bring the false vine into a saving
[19:35] relationship with Jesus Christ
[19:40] so don't even try because the cow in
[19:42] them they get plugged into Jesus
[19:46] because the bride will be plugged into
[19:48] her husband her mate the reveal word
[19:53] do you know why your husband is your
[19:57] husband is the reveal word butter brown
[20:00] call that your meat
[20:03] so you must know many hearing from your
[20:06] husband
[20:08] you'll be hearing the reveal word
[20:11] if you're hearing something other than
[20:13] what your husband said is not your
[20:15] husband because the word is God isn't
[20:18] that right say if your husband gonna
[20:20] send your word it has to be his word
[20:22] which is the reveal word or the Bible
[20:25] was a sealed book but it was unsealed so
[20:29] the book that we have now is now a
[20:31] revealed book because God sent a prophet
[20:33] to reveal the whole mystery of God for
[20:36] the wrapkin of the church he didn't
[20:38] reveal the mystery for us to be educated
[20:41] he revealed a mystery for us to be
[20:43] clouded
[20:46] because about us and his wife at
[20:48] Minister Freddie what's the use you know
[20:51] and you're not being made ready you know
[20:53] what's coming on you made no preparation
[20:55] the reason that you know what's coming
[20:57] is that you might be pure
[21:03] so we learn the most amazing truths that
[21:07] the Holy Spirit could fall upon the
[21:09] Unruh generated false vine Christians
[21:11] and
[21:12] manifests powerfully in various signs
[21:14] and wonders Eamon Judas had a definite
[21:17] ministry in the Holy Ghost
[21:19] though he himself was pronounced to be a
[21:22] devil but these principles in mind we
[21:25] start to trace the church to the various
[21:27] seven ages the birth of church was at
[21:30] Pentecost the first Adam was given a
[21:33] bride fresh from the hand of God was
[21:35] undefiled for a briefs man so was Christ
[21:38] the last Adam give my bright beyond
[21:40] fresh at Pentecost she remained separate
[21:43] and only five for some time and there's
[21:45] no man joined himself to them
[21:48] but God added to the church such as
[21:53] would be saved that was the bride
[21:57] nobody didn't join to them God sent them
[22:00] God said additions to the church
[22:03] hallelujah he kept a pure he kept it
[22:07] clean he kept it righteous he judged the
[22:10] wicked unjust evil to protect that
[22:12] church that was his bride or could we
[22:15] give the Lord a show
[22:18] acts 5:13 and the Lord added daily such
[22:22] as would be saved
[22:24] acts 2:47 AHA right and how long
[22:27] discontinued we do not know but one
[22:29] naeema's Eve was tempted and seduced by
[22:31] Satan so the church was contaminated by
[22:34] the entrance of an antichrist spirit
[22:37] spirit and this is the spirit of
[22:41] Antichrist whereof you have heard of and
[22:43] even now is already in the world first
[22:44] and for 3 and Jesus said considering his
[22:48] prize in this first age I have somewhat
[22:50] against thee because I was left I first
[22:52] love remember where folk where dull had
[22:54] fallen and repent
[22:57] the church was in the first age already
[23:00] a fallen woman a Satan had gotten to II
[23:03] before Adam even know Satan's he'd used
[23:05] the church the Bride of Christ before
[23:07] the might sup of the Lamb but what
[23:10] specifically was in her midst that
[23:13] caused the fall
[23:14] what what revelation 2 6 prophetess is
[23:18] reviewing it the deeds of the
[23:21] Nicolaitans
[23:22] already the first age had tuned from
[23:25] following the pure Word of God I like
[23:27] that I like how that is freeze do it it
[23:30] up your word I have mixtures
[23:34] where people add in and take an event
[23:37] subtract and shaking it up and then
[23:39] presenting it to the people
[23:42] they turn from God's demand of a church
[23:47] absolutely dependent on him that was
[23:50] costs the man to depend upon him because
[23:54] he was God of the people
[23:57] he was always one of the people
[24:03] but what came in was spirit a man to
[24:06] conquer the people and inject you have
[24:09] God but you need a man to
[24:11] God plus intellect God was human God was
[24:15] the injection of an organizational sprit
[24:18] of men
[24:20] depending entirely upon God to fulfill
[24:22] his word from start to finish apart from
[24:24] human government that were that means
[24:25] the nickel it isn't Nick elitism which
[24:29] is all
[24:30] a human government within the church
[24:34] which all governments do the legislate
[24:36] for the people they did exactly what
[24:39] Israel did they took the experiencee of
[24:43] human government instead of the word and
[24:45] spirit so Israel had pillar of fire they
[24:48] had profit and they come and tell the
[24:50] profit and we want a king he said what
[24:52] you're talking about I'm working is God
[24:55] what you want is a well the other all
[24:57] nations have King
[25:00] then got all the profit they have not
[25:03] rejected you they are rejected me give
[25:07] him a king they want a man take one and
[25:09] that's how they got sure but David was
[25:13] coming but they didn't want to wait
[25:16] dynamics is coming but they didn't want
[25:19] to wait the holy oceans coming but they
[25:22] didn't want to wait Oh hallelujah so God
[25:26] give them a substitute
[25:28] don't take a substitute it have real the
[25:32] Holy Ghost is just as real as well Peter
[25:35] received it as well although speedily
[25:38] ill-received
[25:40] [Applause]
[25:46] for the Menem
[25:49] who if anything was made in my image it
[25:53] looked like me if something I made in
[25:55] the image of the church it would look
[25:56] like the church
[25:57] something was made in the image and to
[25:59] the piece which was loo tourism
[26:02] metal ISM is I know we not get in that
[26:05] just yet
[26:07] it's almost too good to be true
[26:09] that this is oh god see see when God
[26:12] looked down upon the mother Hallett and
[26:14] see blasphemous names those names is
[26:17] represented by Baptist Methodist
[26:19] Pentecostal do with all those names are
[26:21] blasphemous names that's all it is in
[26:23] the spirit realm you see nice church a
[26:26] nice building under there 50 years and a
[26:28] hundred years when God looked dongs if
[26:29] blasphemous names
[26:32] in the junk to the Beast
[26:36] enemy of God
[26:38] hallelujah for the Antichrist spirit you
[26:43] don't want to be in that channel you
[26:45] want to be a channel for the holy spirit
[26:51] all of them isn't forming an
[26:53] organization I mean an image like unto
[26:55] the Beast do you see them but a brand
[26:57] I'm all Catholics Methodists or Baptists
[26:59] are going I didn't see that there are
[27:01] thousands and thousands and tens of
[27:03] thousands of born-again Christians in
[27:04] those churches but in their organization
[27:06] they are trying to try them to a Creed
[27:08] and they won't stand for it because when
[27:10] our church organizes it comes under a
[27:13] creed you could only organized under a
[27:16] creed or doctrine you cannot organize
[27:19] Christ because as a life
[27:22] you could build systems along it but you
[27:25] kind of organize the life the light will
[27:27] pop out and break out and move out Oh
[27:30] hallelujah that's why Jesus said upon
[27:33] this rock I'll build my church
[27:34] he had the village church on something
[27:36] that cannot fail he had to build it in a
[27:39] shuang car so he put it on revelation
[27:42] that only the spirit that bring the
[27:45] mother can stop you from getting
[27:47] revelation the person in front of you
[27:49] can't stop you from getting revelation
[27:50] not even your sins could stop you from
[27:53] getting revelation because God is
[27:55] sovereign revelation is sovereign he
[27:57] receiveth whomsoever he will that's the
[28:01] God that we serve
[28:03] [Applause]
[28:09] so do you get it now
[28:11] organizational spirit must come under a
[28:14] Creed but the brightness last day she
[28:16] has no Creed but Christ amen no book but
[28:20] the Bible the Bible has become open by a
[28:23] seven C seventh on the message it opened

[42:57] wrong that one or that one wrong that
[42:58] not wrong that one gotten wrong and the
[43:00] people will deduce well my pastor is
[43:02] right I
[43:05] said I'd be an intellectual idiot that
[43:08] think I'm the only man that God could
[43:10] use this omnipotent God
[43:12] all could uses english-speaking people I
[43:15] don't accept that it mean no French no
[43:18] Spanish neutral man no in not only
[43:21] english-speaking people go to the
[43:23] Englishman
[43:27] sorry
[43:28] he bigger than X
[43:31] but Iran say God knows where every
[43:33] flight butters I
[43:41] every flight
[43:44] not your two flights live in your house
[43:47] every fly give no one every five by the
[43:50] eye
[43:51] and
[43:53] this omnipotent all-powerful a mission
[43:57] god she's hands a short
[44:00] that he can't heal but he can deliver as
[44:05] I preached one time he wanted to
[44:07] demonstrate he's a deliverer three loose
[44:09] Moses
[44:10] to bring these people out to prove he's
[44:14] a Gordon's bringing out
[44:22] a wall John preached he didn't get no
[44:25] spoken word in Yemen fellas only Jacob
[44:28] and spoken word it's what O'Neill's
[44:30] given to Moses and Genesis and Exodus
[44:33] because it was for redemption
[44:35] Redemption by blood
[44:38] retention by power you need a spoken
[44:41] word let there be
[44:46] and if we going back to Redemption we
[44:49] need the spoken word oh my my my I was
[44:54] so tremendous Oh glory
[44:57] so therefore the power of God would put
[45:01] the people might say task me the power
[45:02] of God will put the people in the bride
[45:06] standing in the power of God would put
[45:09] the people in the bride
[45:11] don't you forget that
[45:18] so what do you come to church for you
[45:21] come to church to connect with the power
[45:23] of God hallelujah
[45:26] praise God so therefore these Greeks
[45:30] came to see Jesus script to be read and
[45:35] they came to his disciples and
[45:39] these disciples they pull them aside and
[45:43] said here what we will tell you all
[45:45] you need to know about him and the pull
[45:49] of this Greek society know that there's
[45:50] not an environment when they acts we
[45:53] will see Jesus
[45:55] disciples took them straight
[45:57] to Jesus
[45:59] no side shows
[46:02] we need people to be pointed to Christ
[46:04] not to a group not to a church not to a
[46:09] man but Jesus Christ and when they came
[46:13] to Jesus he said don't even look at me
[46:19] have a place I want to point you to he
[46:22] said SEPA corner we'd fall into the
[46:24] ground and die it abideth alone so he's
[46:26] pointing to the cross he's pointing them
[46:29] to where they will really see him he's
[46:31] pointing them to Jordan
[46:34] [Music]
[46:36] he was sending them there
[46:41] hallelujah so therefore is one thing to
[46:44] get a revelation that your corner wheat
[46:46] that's the first thing you are bought
[46:49] corn of wheat all seven hundred seven
[46:52] virtues seven voices seven revelation
[46:54] that make you God's porn
[46:56] God's corn of wheat
[46:58] hallelujah but then the next step is you
[47:01] got to die because you remain alone but
[47:05] God want much fruit and the process for
[47:07] much fruit means purge and put it more
[47:10] and so on to bring forth much fruit you
[47:13] see here is my father glorified how must
[47:15] go be glorified in us by signal and say
[47:18] we believe no we have to be fruit Darrin
[47:21] where does food come from it start off
[47:23] with the seed this see doesn't look like
[47:26] a fruit the fruit doesn't look like a
[47:28] seat but the seed is planted and your
[47:30] weight on it the seed is planted and
[47:33] truly process of time it pushed for the
[47:36] chute and everything else and bring
[47:38] forth fruit this is what God did he
[47:40] plant the seed in there Pentecost and it
[47:43] represent a church a book of Acts he
[47:46] knew that Alpha and Omega will be the
[47:48] same so God promised just as was the
[47:51] Alpha Church will be the Omega church
[47:52] same science same wonders same miracles
[47:56] same life isn't that right they were
[48:00] adopted they had the person of the Holy
[48:01] Ghost dad a personal Christ but they
[48:03] couldn't be translated because wasn't a
[48:05] seasoned time for that but we have to go
[48:08] back and pick up what they hand so we
[48:10] can go forward without picking up what
[48:11] they had because they had the held in
[48:13] they had the original put somebody say
[48:17] Amen so course and a prophet to pack us
[48:19] to point us back to the original what
[48:21] Peter had what Paul had is one spirit
[48:24] you know is that two spirits and is one
[48:27] spirit you know and they had it so we
[48:30] have the one pick up what they have and
[48:31] then come back and then go forward Oh
[48:33] glory to God because it was the coming
[48:36] of the Lord there should have gone on to
[48:38] the rapture but God had seeds that did
[48:42] not yet come God had seven ages to be
[48:45] unfolded so the early church happens to
[48:47] go down the upcoming looter come Wesley
[48:51] up company cuss and now here come you

[49:21] something better for us that we got them
[49:25] or pull them or draw them out we are
[49:30] going to be the cap magnet to pull them
[49:33] out of the ground it's gonna be a power
[49:36] coming to the church

[50:39] specifically called Lazarus by name
[50:47] no Lazarus was gonna get all and die I'm
[50:50] this time very properly
[50:55] but he proved a point that the dead
[50:58] could be raised that he could snatch his
[51:00] soul and bring it right back to a point
[51:02] that this is not the only life
[51:05] now when you leave here is another
[51:07] dimension in somewhere else this is not

[1:25:07] promises as revealed by this endtime
[1:25:09] message was to be weird over the people

[1:25:28] promised God promised her promises is
[1:25:30] here that you have to get wave over you
[1:25:33] and when it's real over you it comes

[1:26:16] so therefore going to look 1730 Malachi
[1:26:18] 4 different scriptures we acquainted
[1:26:19] with that the word again has to be over
[1:26:21] the people that the dead transition of
[1:26:23] men is dead and the Son of God is alive
[1:26:25] again with the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:28] Spirit right among us giving us life
[1:26:30] what something Jesus was son of man
[1:26:32] right after son animals what son of God
[1:26:34] holy split up Aroon we are promised

[1:26:49] of God to come back among the people
[1:26:52] notice fivefold ministry not a permanent
[1:26:55] thing the five four ministries till we

[1:27:11] people that we all come on the same
[1:27:13] level of the fullness of the measure of
[1:27:17] Christ so Christ fullness is from fatal
[1:27:20] charity and you will get a measure of
[1:27:22] that fullness
[1:27:24] there wouldn't be the whole ocean in the
[1:27:27] arrow or Manson or somewhere you have
[1:27:29] some water of abusing you'll have your
[1:27:31] measure in the capacity that God put you
[1:27:34] in say wouldn't anoint your sister to be
[1:27:36] a preacher
[1:27:38] because the feeling so spiritual
[1:27:40] befallen saying we're going to bless you
[1:27:43] in your measure Paul had a great measure
[1:27:45] because he had to bring and he was
[1:27:47] educated and God wanted that type to
[1:27:50] break the old testament and reveal the
[1:27:53] New Testament he couldn't use Peter in
[1:27:55] that capacity he educated you named Paul
[1:27:59] [Music]
[1:28:02] in a Manitoba Greek and all M languages
[1:28:05] and whatnot Paul was that man since
[1:28:07] education was for purpose his intellect

[1:28:28] shall be saved and so on like that and
[1:28:30] those who believe only receive and son
[1:28:33] like that and God unlocked the kingdom
[1:28:34] of God that's a gorgeous Peter for all
[1:28:36] of those brothers had their rule and
[1:28:38] function Jude little broker Jude he had
[1:28:41] his place in it he's the one who say
