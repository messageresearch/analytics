[14:18] so Isaiah chapter 25 verse 4.
[14:22] and it says
[14:24] for thou has been a strength to the poor
[14:29] a strength to the needy in his distress
[14:34] our refuge From The Storm
[14:37] a shadow from the Heat
[14:40] when the blast of the terrible ones is
[14:44] as a storm against the war
[14:48] praise the name of the Lord and went
[14:50] across to Psalms chapter 72
[14:53] Psalms 72 verses 12 and 13.
[14:58] it says
[14:59] for he shall deliver the needy when he
[15:03] cried
[15:04] the poor also and him that hath no
[15:08] helper
[15:09] he shall spare the poor and needy and
[15:13] shall save the souls of the needy
[15:16] amen praise God on the final scripture
[15:19] is Psalms chapter 36 9.
[15:23] forward thee is the function of life
[15:27] in thy light shall we see light
[15:31] praise the name of the Lord Lord may the
[15:33] Lord a blessing to the reading of his
[15:35] word tonight
[15:36] amen praise God so just for a few words
[15:39] before we pray
[15:42] amen so all of us here tonight as
[15:45] Christians
[15:47] are different stages
[15:50] in our journey this journey
[15:53] a journey of life
[15:56] and we go through this journey of Life
[15:59] daily
[16:01] every day
[16:03] some are born
[16:06] some go on
[16:08] sometimes we celebrate sometimes we
[16:11] grieve
[16:13] they are mountains to climb
[16:16] and they are valleys to go down into
[16:21] then there are times we walk
[16:24] on the Prairies or the plains
[16:27] and we just Coast a little bit
[16:31] in this journey of life we undergo a
[16:34] wide range of experiences
[16:38] oh my and sometimes they get tremendous
[16:42] at times amen
[16:47] so let's look at children of Israel
[16:50] coming out of Egypt and journeying
[16:52] towards the Promised Land
[16:58] when they came out well while they were
[17:00] in Egypt they cried from the whips of
[17:02] the taskmasters
[17:06] when they came out and crossed over the
[17:08] Red Sea and so on they danced and
[17:09] rejoiced when they saw pharaoh and his
[17:12] men drown in the Red Sea
[17:14] what a time of rejoicing it was for them
[17:19] they followed the pillar of fire in the
[17:22] wilderness
[17:25] but many of them perished in the very
[17:27] Wilderness as well
[17:31] due to their behavior and their attitude
[17:33] towards God
[17:36] a whole generation wiped out
[17:39] during that time
[17:42] oh the Journey of Life the ups and the
[17:46] Downs the ins and the outs the rise and
[17:50] they fall
[17:53] but threw it off
[17:55] the I am was always present can we see
[17:59] amen tonight
[18:01] Hallelujah and we're going to give them
[18:03] my title my title tonight is ill should
[18:06] I the almighty one is here
[18:09] El Shaddai the almighty one
[18:15] praise God and throughout their Journey
[18:17] no matter what in the ups and downs
[18:20] the I am was always present

[18:25] sometimes but he never leaves us
[18:28] he is the living Fountain ever present
[18:31] for his children

[18:36] can we say Amen tonight
[18:38] Hallelujah
[18:39] is the same yesterday
[18:41] to the end forever glory to God Amen
[18:45] and as Christians
[18:47] we are not excluded
[18:51] or Exempted from the rigors of life
[18:57] we go through battles and fights ups and
[19:01] downs
[19:03] sometimes we get really low
[19:06] head down against the ground Maybe
[19:09] but the I am is still ever present can
[19:12] we give him a hand of praise tonight
[19:14] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
