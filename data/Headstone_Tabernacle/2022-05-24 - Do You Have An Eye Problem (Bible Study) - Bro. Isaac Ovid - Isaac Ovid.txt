you're happy to be here this evening thank you so much brother anthony what a anointing and an atmosphere can we just bow our heads for word of prayer this evening and we want to remember brother stetson williams in prayer uh brother hugh sent in a note um he hasn't been feeling too well and um he'll be 94 years lord willing this coming sunday and that's his heart's desire to make it to that day so let's just remember him in prayer tonight and if there's anybody tonight you have a need you came in here this evening on a tuesday evening with a desire to have a closer walk with the lord you came in here this evening with a desire to uh connect or reconnect maybe you came in here not feeling well maybe you came in here feeling down and looking for something to pick you up let's just approach the throne of grace this evening oh gracious heavenly father we thank you tonight for your love for your mercy for your grace lord for your favor for your loving kindness for your peace that's a passive understanding for this opportunity to gather as believers of like precious faith to come together to acknowledge you our lord to acknowledge that you are our king to acknowledge that you are our redeemer our savior our master our guide you are the conductor of this symphony this great orchestra that is playing out lord the score that was written before the foundation of the world father we thank you for making a way for us to gather those that are here already those that would join us along the way and even those that couldn't make it for whatever reason we pray that lord of peace that to surpass it our understanding would lord reach into every home into every life into every situation father there are so many things that are happening around the world that are happening here locally that are happening in homes and happening in our personal lives the law that have an impact lord and how we interact with our environment interact with each other and further we want to make it our business lord to have you as the center of our joy the center of our hope the center of our reality father lord we come tonight lord as a needy people or they are sons and daughters here who have need of restoration need of deliverance need of lord a spirit of reconciliation needs of a time of refreshing lord need that that rustle in the mulberry tree need to hear the still small voice and lord although this may be a virtual meeting lord and a bible study we know with assurance that you were the same yesterday today and forever and you are more than able tonight to break chains and to break shackles and to turn lives around and to give us comfort in the midst of our situation so father we turn this service over to you we want to remember our brother stetson tonight in a special way lord that your healing virtue would move upon him and he would touch him from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet and lord for every need tonight that was expressed in the hearts of your people lord and father as we approach you lord knowing that lord father you are more than able to meet our needs we commit your people into your hands we commit this bible study into your hands may you take me completely out of the way and may you speak with your children father we commit this time into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen and amen so it's certainly good to be back in fellowship um in this way and um to get back into school as it were with our bible studies to encourage one another from the scriptures and to you know either get reinforcement of what we have already seen and know and understand and uh for those who have not had a time or a chance to look at things a certain way you know to get encouragement from the scriptures so that we could be better sons better daughters better stewards better parents better children better believers um better you know participants in this world that we are not of you know so that we could be equipped with the tools to be able to overcome in our daily lives i am a firm believer that this gospel is not a gospel that's limited to sunday worship or limited or wednesday night service or even limited to a bible study in a tuesday but it is a practical gospel for us to live and jesus when he was here on earth he demonstrated his interest not just in the spiritual well-being of the disciples but also the natural and it was for this reason when they had to pay their taxes he told them go fish and find a fish and there was gold in there to show that he didn't tell him go and pray about it he practically solved the issue and the need of that day which was to pay the taxes that they had to deal with so rest assured tonight and every night that the god that we serve is very interested in our well-being he's interested in your health he's interested in your wealth he's interested in your mindset he's interested in your conversations he's interested in your going out he's interested in your coming in and by the grace of god we want to endeavor into the word to find if it's one scripture one verse one word from the bible to encourage somebody tonight it is well worth it so thank you so much for being here we appreciate it we don't take it for granted there are so many ways we could spend our time on a tuesday evening but i can assure you there's no better way to spend your time on a tuesday evening than in fellowship around the word of god god loves to speak to us and he has written this wonderful very long love letter in the form of his word that we could reach into every day any day and find something to lift us up to encourage us to guide us to exhort us to admonish us to rebuke us so that we could be shaped and homes i want to challenge you for the next few minutes of this first day of class as it will um i don't intend to be too long just to kind of set the foundation for us reigniting this tuesday evening conversation but i do want to encourage you to give it your full attention don't let it be something that you you know doing as a as a as a you know we love to see we can multitask you know i'll be multitasking you know you have to give a certain level of attention to the things of god and when you really understand you know how much hours you have in a day in the week and how much you really give to the business of god's kingdom you know i could assure you that once you do the calculation we can do more you know so we want to do a little more tonight and look into his word for some encouragement from the scriptures like i said i'm not going to be too long but by the grace of god i trust that these few words of encouragement would be an encouragement to you tonight i do have a strange title tonight but i will get to it in a in a little bit all right so everybody feeling fine uh trust you have your bibles with you trust you have your some way to reference the scripture with you this evening and by the grace of god we want to turn it over to him so just to kind of layer foundation to introduce it tonight there are five natural senses that govern our interaction with this terrestrial world five natural senses that govern our interaction with this terrestrial world the sense of taste the sense of smell the sense of touch the sense of hearing and the sense of seeing and as spiritual creatures we are very conscious of that sick sense a sick sense of faith but i want to spend a little time here on these five senses to kind of drive down this road to our subject tonight these five senses taste smell touch hearing seeing work together to give us insight to give us awareness to give us consciousness of everything around us taste allows us to enjoy the fruits and good food and very often when you're sitting and eat good food you say tasting good could you imagine a life and an existence without a sense of taste that every meal that you eat taste quote unquote the exact same way that you are unable to differentiate good cooking from bad cooking you're unable to differentiate the work of a very good chef from somebody who's just starting off if without that sense of taste you know there are many things that you can enjoy with that without that sense of taste or the sense of smell that allows you to walk out in the morning after the rain falls and you get that that fresh due early morning people say they're going out to get some fresh air because we live in a world where we are trapped in offices and trapped in houses and if you have ac or whatever it is and you want to there's a difference when you have that sense of smell to smell what is fresh air from air that is not fresh these senses have an impact on our experience on our lives the sense of touch what is it to go down to a river or a beach or and you pass your hands and you feel the water ripple through your fingers there are people who can't experience that and therein lies the beauty of that sense of touch or the sense of hearing hearing birds hearing animals in the distance as opposed to hearing the engines and driving and people want to go into nature but iran himself used to go to escape into the forest into into a place of solitude because sometimes you want to not hear much and that distinction of hearing or not hearing is that sense and the ability to utilize that sense to interact with the world that's around us and then there's a sense of seeing seeing what's right in front of us seeing what's at a distance seeing what might be danger seeing what might be opportunities in isolation each of these senses have their roles to play but in combination they help paint a picture a real picture a picture that is multi-dimensional that allows us to experience the world around us they exist for many reasons to help us to protect us you're driving you're doing something and you hear a sound and you know it's dangerous warning without that you'd be in trouble you see something coming from a distance all of these things matter to us as senses that equip us and help us understand and interpret the world around us many of us we are blessed to have access to these five senses there are many people and and if you don't have a reason to thank god tonight just the ability to see or to heal because when jesus came he came to heal blind eyes he came to address people who who couldn't hear they were deaf and people who couldn't speak and and and sometimes we take these simple things for granted and i want to remind us tonight that just the ability to interact with this world around us to even hear this word tonight is a blessing because they are there those out there who can't even hear can't even see we take some of these things for granted but these things were given to us by god to interact with the world around us anybody with me tonight these senses can be both a blessing or they can be a curse it is not very common conversation to place one sense over another sense it's not something we sit down and say well i really appreciate my sense of smell more than my sense of hearing i really appreciate my sense of seeing over my sense of taste in fact in scripture in first corinthians 12 21 the bible says and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor the head to defeat i have no need of thee but when you look a little deeper ride with me tonight not going to be too long when you look a bit deeper it is not as simple as needing one more than the other the truth is some senses may be more connected to your destiny than others in subtle ways we could see through scripture references to one sense in particular that can make you or break you revelation 3 17 says because thou sayest i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knoweth not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked of all the senses referenced here it's only one blind it didn't say can't smell it didn't say it can't taste it basically said can't see i want to encourage and remind the church tonight in many ways success in life comes down to what you see choose to see choose not to see do not see and cannot see i'll say that one more time many times success in life comes down to what you see choose to see choose not to see do not see and cannot see we often hear statements such as if only i had seen who he was who he really was if only i had seen who she really was we hear statements such as i do not know what she sees in him not what she smells in him what she sees in him in business we reference the fact that great entrepreneurs see opportunities that others cannot see there are countless stories of bankers who just could not see what was in a business plan only to regret missing out on a great opportunity such is this ability to see failure to see we reference lot and we say if lot had seen what was happening to his family or what could have happened to his family would he have made the same decision that he would have made that's how powerful sight is the ability to see without a vision the people perish it doesn't say without the sense of smell or the sense of hearing there's something powerful about vision about seeing about the ability to see about understanding what you see understanding what you do not see cannot see not trained to see within recent years and as time has unfold we have seen crime and criminal activity increase and with that increase in crime and criminal activity there's a term that is referenced called situational awareness and it speaks to the ability to be aware of your surroundings the ability to be conscious of where you park how you're getting from point a to point b of observing your surroundings of not walking with your head buried in your cell phone because if your head buried in a cell phone you can't see the oncoming threat in that situation is not that you lack the ability to see it is because your forecast is elsewhere you cannot see what you should be seeing that's the danger of not understanding the power of the sense of sight and of seeing and if any natural the inability to see a threat because you are distracted by your mobile device how much more dangerous is it to not see a spiritual attack because you are focused on the wrong thing we talk about seeing red flags and and and it was plain to the eye to see what biases and history and desires and issues clouded judgment the power of seeing as i build tonight my bible study is a question do you have an eye problem does the bible study tonight do you have an i problem e y e i problem this issue of seeing enough sight and of having an eye problem goes back to genesis i'm not going to be too long with you food for thoughtful to encourage you in genesis 3 verse 6 the bible says and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food she saw that the tree was good for food what are you seeing tonight where what holds your attention what are you watching tonight what's attracting you tonight we're gonna build into something because the challenge today with people losing their love for the lord is because they're not looking at the lord when you're in love with something and it holds your attention that becomes the object of your focus your attention but but we spend more time on social media and on the news and on following other issues but when the woman saw in genesis 3 6 that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes oh yes pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did it and gave also unto her husband with her and he did it the next verse and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons friends are your eyes open are your eyes closed what's holding your attention when you go through scripture we remember the story of elisha when he was hearing the plans in the army of the syrians you remember that and he said open up this boy eyes because he couldn't see and when his eyes opened he could he could see that there were more for him than against him what are you looking at tonight do you have an eye problem we preach a message when you look what do you see this issue of seeing could impact your family could impact your life could impact your business could impact your marriage could impact your influence what you see what you do not see genesis 13 verse 10 and lot lifted up his eyes this is after the conversation with abraham and lot and beheld all the planes of jordan and it was well watered everywhere before the law destroyed saddam and gomorrah he allowed his eyes to judge even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest under zoa so when abraham say a lot lot is not good for our brethren and your president my bridge into beef and have issues and debate and argue it's a plenty enough land where you want to go lot didn't look with his heart he didn't look with his head he looked with his eyes and he looked at what was pleasing to him anybody with me tonight we said earlier that what you see could be a blessing it could be a curse your eyes can be a blessing it could be a curse genesis 13 14 and the lord said unto abraham after that lot was separated from him lift up now than eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward and we know the scripture there so these same eyes can look at the same situation the same context and see something different i'm building into something not going to be too much longer matthew 5 29. if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from v for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell i want to read that in the amplified if your right eye makes you stumble and leads you to sin tear it out and throw it away if that is remove yourself from the source of temptation for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell i'm building friends in the peak of job's response to the pressure that was upon him i believe i would have mentioned this when we studied job job in job 31 job 31 is close to the end of the back and forth debate he said i made a covenant with mine eyes have you made a covenant with your eyes have you made an agreement with your eyes i don't want you to look at this lightly tonight friends because the root of what took place in genesis was the fruit looked good it was pleasing to the eye the eyes deceived eve anybody with me this evening so job is said i made a covenant with my eyes why then should i think upon a maid in the amplified it says i have made a covenant agreement with my eyes how then can i engage lustfully at a virgin now i want to get to maybe quality substantive part of my text tonight we're going to read from the book of judges and i'm going to start by just pulling out one verse first before i get into our substantive reading judges 17 verse 6 and the bible says in those days there was no king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes you imagine a situation where well it's the way i see him it is dire why moving that that's that then i see the way you've seen it so i'm doing what i want to do well daddy i seen it so you know well wi-fi i've seen it so you know well husband i have seen it so you know well both i seen it so and the bible says every man did that which was right in his own eyes now when something is right in your eyes you judging by your past your experience your mistake what your father tell you what you went through your experiences and you judging and the fact that the bible will make the distinction every man did that what was right in his own eyes that is a formula for this agreement is a formula of a conflict it's a formula for problems because what you might think is right i might think is right and what somebody else think is right there all of us looking from our own bias our own perspective and from our own eyes and making sense because you know you every one of your ideas makes sense to you every one of my ideas makes sense to me isn't that right something wrong with us if we don't think of our ideas making sense until we can admit when you opened our new perspective or you opened a new idea when you look back at your history your story what you have done at the point in time you did something you did it because you thought that was the best move at a point in time outside of that you wouldn't have done it there is no action that you would have ever taken that you didn't think at that particular point in time with your available information you had that that was the best move you can make am i right whether you buy a house you buy a car your rent you apply for a job based on all the available information that you had you made what you thought was the best decision hindsight you've got to look back and say you know what that was a good move you know that was real stripping this i really should not do that you could look back now because you have gone further down the road you have the benefit of having hindsight to see now a now that i've learned more i realized i should have thought about this differently imagine if the church everybody wanted to do what was right in their own eyes what kind of choice we'd have this usher want to do it this way this deacon what to do with this way the piano man playing in f you get a man playing in g because it's right in his own eyes the song leader are singing in e flat because they're right in his own eye and remember the parents singing in b so now everybody singing doing what they think is right in their own eyes because they're limiting it to their decision imagine if a company everybody did what they want what they thought was right in their own eyes friends you could only see what you're trained to see let me say that again we're gonna build into where we're going you can only see what you're trained to see that's why when a situation happened and they say well hey did he catch his number plate on the vehicle most people are trained to see the number plate but if it was a police man or a security professional they would tell you that was a number plate we got a train to pick up on these things so the ability to see is greater than somebody who is not trained to see it so the danger the problem of everybody doing what is right in their own eyes we are forever limited by our sight our experience what we did in school our own knowledge our limited understanding of scripture our limited understanding of the message because we are limited by our own eyes no wonder we could thank god for the seeing eyes of a prophet who could see beyond all of us and reach into the mind of god to put plainly before us how we should walk because outside of that we'll be walking all over the place anybody with me tonight what happens if in a home in a family everyone does what is right in their own eyes isn't there a head of the home oh yes isn't there somebody supposed to have vision beyond everybody else to chat at destiny like a ship you rolling forward somebody has ruined backwards somebody you both will go nowhere or they're exercising that's that's what you're doing because you row in forward she run backwards his son ruined the right and the daughter ruined the left water just splashing this boat going nowhere because everybody doing what is right in their own eyes there must be leadership spiritual leadership there must be a vision no wonder the bible says without a vision people perish anybody with me tonight is this helping anybody what we're trying to do is see something different and more than that to not fall into the trap of our limited vision so we in the book of judges i want to know rewind a little bit to judges 13 that's the lair foundation because i know many would not have spent time reading it we're going to read this chapter in just a few points and then we're going to close out as we bring this home so do you have an eye problem are you looking at what you should not be looking at are you not seeing what you're supposed to be seeing aren't you seeing that what's happening in your job could destroy you aren't you seeing that you're missing church for the wrong reason is destroying your walk with god aren't you seeing the attack on your family let's go georges 13 and verse one and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord again seeing right in the sight of the lord they don't even conscious that god is looking i want us to see it from two perspectives here and the children visit their evil again throughout this entire book of judges we see a repeated cycle of redemption and judgment and redemption and judgment because between judgment and redemption you have the people doing what they want to do what is right in their own eyes and god having to step in and address the situation and the children visited evil again in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of the philistines 40 years to discipline them i want us to appreciate the fact that god is just he is fair he is to his word you love him you abide by his word you follow his word your followers commandments he said if you love me keep my commandments there's no rocket science in this these are principles there's blessing that is attached to that you walk away from that road and choose your own road and do what is right in your own eyes there are consequences god could forgive you now now now and still deal with consequences i want us to appreciate that point because there are consequences it doesn't mean he doesn't love you but it's just because his law is written a certain way there has to be consequences when you step outside of god's word so this should be an encouragement to us it should be a warning to us it should be a reminder to us still in verse 1 and the lord delivered them into the hand of the philistines 40 years and there was a certain man of zorah of the family of the danites the house of dhan a tribe of man whose name was manoa and his wife was barren and bear not she was barren had no children verse 3 and the angel of the lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now thou art barren and bearest not but thou shalt conceive and bear a son what an encouragement to a woman who is barren what an encouragement to a woman who undoubtedly may go through the emotional turmoil of wondering about her state has status a situation and to get a word and the right word at the right time to give her comfort verse 4 but with that word of comfort comes the admonition comes the warning comes the playbook the guide the way to live to see this thing unfold i want us to appreciate that spiritual success natural success is based on principles here the angel not only says you're going to have this or not but verse 4 now therefore beware now i don't want to understand or have to deal with the consequences of feeling to beware the promise is given but the angel is saying listen there's there's some stuff you have to do there's a value to be in bible study there's a value to be in service on wednesday night on the stream there's a value to prayer meeting there's a value to being in service on a sunday because there's something about your principles of your life and here it is now therefore be where i pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for lo thou shall conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a nazirite unto god from the womb and he shall begin on the line begin to deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines what a powerful scripture and a context so this woman who is barren who has borne no children is given a promise and is also given a rule book a guide a structure of which to live what to eat what not to eat how to move not you you understand this you understand why when you have a promise from god it's not just a promise and it just will happen just so god has his path and we have our part this is to remind us tonight verse six then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of god came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of god very terrible but i asked him not whence he was i didn't ask him where he come from neither told me his name he didn't tell me who he was but he said unto me behold thou shalt conceive and bear son and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a nazarite to god from the womb to the day of his death then manoa entreated the lord begged the lord plead to the lord and said o my lord let the man of god which doubted their sin come again unto us look at this prayer friends parents i want you to note this young people in the lord terrorists who will become parents i want you to note this particular prayer i want to read it again then menoah entreated the lord in treat is a deep word it is beyond us it is deeper than ask intrigue connotes pleading begging is a level of suffocation it's not asking a light request then manoa entreated the lord and said oh my lord let the man of god which thou did ascend come again unto us and listen teach us if you have a physical bible underline it using an app highlight it teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born parents have you ever prayed for god to teach you how to raise your children or the play book you're using is your father playbook or your grandfather playbook or your grandmother playbook or some book that you read here it is and and the desire to be taught is is deeply connected to the fact that manoa and his wife didn't expect any children she was barren how much care and attention you would give to something when you didn't expect it manoa wasn't taking chances he didn't want to raise this child like any other kind of child because this was not supposed to happen he had been living with this barren woman for some time and grace and favor came to him and he didn't want to leave him and say lord send back the man of god so he could show me how to raise this child that shall be born and that prayer connected to god because in verse 9 and god hearkened to the voice of manoa because that request was such a noble request god or not that request anybody with me tonight i don't care what situation you have with your children tonight god can still teach you how to speak with them teach you how to deal with them teach you how to connect with them teach you how to guide them you have to believe it have you entreated the lord and god hearkened to the voice of the noah and the angel of the lord came again unto the woman as she sat in the field but once again manoa her husband was not with her and the woman made haste and ran and showed her husband and said unto him be all the man had appeared unto me that came unto me the other day and manoa arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said unto him i doubt the man that speaketh unto the woman and he said i am and manoa said now let thy words come to pass look at this question friends how shall we order the child how shall we command the child how shall we train the child because if there's no order anybody with me tonight god help us have parents who looking for order looking for the right way the right approach god directed parenthood parenting how shall we order the child and how shall we do unto him and the age of the lord said unto manoa of all that i said unto the woman let her beware she may not eat up anything that comment of the vine neither let her drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing all that i commanded her let her observe verse 15 and manoa said unto the angel of the lord i pray thee let us detain thee let us keep thee until we shall have made ready a kid for thee they were the killer animal a young animal and prepared for him and the age of the lord said unto manoah though thou retained me i will not eat of thy bread and if thou will offer a burnt offering thou must offer it unto the lord in other words i am not here for the worship no glory nothing it is between you and the lord and manoa said unto the angel of the lord what is thy name that when thy sayings come to pass we may do the honor and the angel of the lord said unto him why ask your thou thus after my name seeing it is secret you see how a true angel of the lord speaks so manoa took a kid with a meat offering and offered it upon a rock unto the lord and the angel did wondrously and manoa and his wife looked on now notice to this point they thought it was a man of god they didn't realize it was an angel and manoa and his wife looked on verse 24 it came to pass when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar that the angel of the lord ascended my lord in the flame of the altar and manoa and his wife looked on it and fell on their thesis to the ground but the angel of the lord did no more appear to manoa and to his wife then manoa knew that he was an angel of the lord and manoa said unto his wife we shall surely die because we have seen god but his wife said unto him if the lord were pleased to kill us he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands neither would he have showed us all these things nor would us at this time have told us such things as these and a woman bear a son and called his name samson and the child grew and the lord blessed him and the spirit of the lord began to move him at times in the camp of dan between zorra and astral everybody feeling fine go into the next verse verse 14. and samson went down to tim nut and saw i want this on the line the word saw a woman in tim nut of the daughters of the philistines do you have an eye problem grew up in a good home grew up in a message house anybody with me tonight young people are coming for you tonight parents praying not just praying they're asking the lord how to order how to teach how to train how to guide but samson have his own eyes do you have an eye problem when he saw this girl in tim nut the parents were not there mama wasn't there papa wasn't there because verse 2 says he came and told them what he saw so let me just go back to verse one and kind of dig up in this thing a little bit your own eyes eyes in your school eyes on your job eyes in your university eyes with your friends look at this you see that girl you see this game you see this website you see this xyz whatever it is you have your eyes do you have an eye problem do you realize that your eyes could be leading you down a road that when you come to church you have such condemnation you have such issues you have such problems because your eyes jesus is like a lamp if you're taking the wrong thing you darken your whole life or you can lighten your life tonight just reading these words and scripture you are rewriting your story tonight or you don't hear me tonight just reading these words of eternal life you are rewriting your story do you know the damage all that time on social media and all this stuff does to your spiritual work i don't want to belabor it but you know what i'm talking about so let's go not going to be too much longer and samson went down to tim that and saw a woman in tim that of the daughters of the philistines and he came up and told his father and his mother and said i have seen a woman in tim of the daughters of the philistines now dear forget her for me to wife verse 3. and i won in the church tonight after we do this bible study one there's no excuse but two this is releasing clarity blessing and also judgment because the word of the lord is clear and sharp then his father and his mother sent him is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren or among all thy people that don't go as to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistines so hear me and hear me well tonight church there is no excuse there is no point suggestion recommendation you could ever make to underscore marrying somebody from the world and shame on you parents who support it there's a direct quote from the prophet under no circumstances the believer married an unbeliever it's for your protection it's to help you anybody with me this evening so look at the question there is something i say i know what my bible say is there never a woman among the daughters of thy bridging or among all my people that dog goes to like a wife of the uncircumcised philistines and samson said unto his father get her for me for she pleased at me well i want to read that in the amplified that was three but his father and mother said to him is there no woman among the daughters of your relatives who believe what you believe worship the way you worship or among all of our people that you must go take a wife from the uncircumcised pagan philistine and samson said to his father get her for me because she looks pleasing to me that is the amplified so samson wasn't judging her by character he wasn't judging her by her values he wasn't judging her by her beliefs her interests her dreams her desires her focus her ambition what she was reading what her plans were what she wanted to achieve in life it was purely based on look anybody with me young brothers brothers in general sisters whoever it is what are you judging i'll skip a bit this is a lot of food for thought some people will eat it some people will say boys this food tasting jason boy oh gosh too much too much salt too much seasoning too much why i cook something gentle i want to skip down to verse seven and he went down and talked with the woman so no this is after the parents so listen i have to give credit to the parents for trying to tell samson this boy the right thing you know verse seven he went down and talked and she pleased samson well in the amplified it says she looked pleasing to samson between the verse we read verse three and verse seven verse six says and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and you rent him as he would have rent a kid and he had nothing in his hand but he told his father or his mother what he had done this is a lion you rip the lion so i just want to say quickly here between these two scriptures of georges 14 verse 3 and judges 14 verse 7 judges 14 verse 6 right there highlights between his weakness and his eye problem the physical strength and the blessing that god gave but his weakness would be his undoing his eye problem will be his undoing i'm almost finished short lesson tonight just starting back bible study with lead ultimately to judges 16. where once again his eyes would lead him to another woman named delilah that would ultimately lead to his eyes coming out i wonder why god would allow out of all the punishments that the philistine would put samson through it would be that his eyes had to come out because when you really understand what was samson downfall it was his eyes by taking out samson eyes the problem of his eyesight and this woman he was looking at i didn't read it but between there he went after a prostitute to look good too his eyes was his weakness church do you have an eye problem are you guarding your eyes do you need to lose your eye like samson for you to understand that you need to make a covenant with your eyes like job oh my help me tonight job made an agreement with his eye he sent a contract with his eyes that he would lust jesus said pluck out your eye if you give any trouble and by pluck out you say take yourself out of the situation of temptation i don't know who this is for tonight but i pray whatever shackle holding you down will be broken tonight by the word so you could be free to worship without condemnation and make an agreement a covenant to bring your body under subjection of the word brother preach it on sunday a man that is clean waters of separation the red heifer god is calling for a clean walk a clean talk a clean life clean hands clean words dishonest they will say creating me a clean heart renew our right spirit within me covenant with your eyes church let's bring this message home tonight let's go down to verse 21 in judges 16. but the philistines took him this is after his eyes let him away from the sisters in church his eyes led him away from what his parents had prayed for his eyes led him away from the truth he grew up with his eyes led him from the reality he had known his eyes led him away from the fact that he was a miracle baby and should never have existed had it not been the angel of the lord had come and visited his mama but the philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought him down to gaza and bound him at fetters of brass and he did grind in the prison house how beard the heel of his head began to grow again after he was shaven then the lords of the philistines gathered them together for to offer a sacrifice unto diego and their god and to rejoice for they said our god had delivered samson our enemy into our hand what an embarrassment and when the people saw him they praised their god for they said our god are delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us and it came to pass when their hearts were married that they said call for samson that he may make a sport and they called for samson out of the prison house and he made them sport and they set him between the pillars and samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer me that i may feel the pillars whereupon the house stand it that i may lean upon them now the house was full of men and women and all the lords and the philistines were there and they were upon the roof about three thousand men and women that be held while samson made sport and samson called unto the lord and said oh lord god remember me i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once oh god that i may at once avenge of the philistines for my two eyes and samson took hold of the two pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was born up of the one with his right hand and the other with his left and samson said let me die with the philistines and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life i'm getting ready to close out in speaking on this and we have preached on this many times and speaking about once more lord and i just love the way the prophet brought it out that although samson lost his physical eyes he could still see and he could see the possibility i want to encourage you tonight mother father son daughter backslider strong believer can you see the possibility night tonight of a greater walk can you see the possibility tonight of our greater talk can you see the possibility tonight of a revival brother branham in this message once more i just want to close out with these quotes he said all the time while they were all standing there he's talking about that last scene and these thoughts was going through their minds i hope it sends some through yours especially if you have an eye problem they never noticed while samson his thoughts went through his mind maybe they passed the bottle took a drink again they find hollywood women stood there with their cigarettes in their mouth if it was such a thing in that day i don't think they got quite that low in that day but pushed up their hay and took another drink while all that is going on and while he taught the philistines had not noticed him this little boy had untied his hands walked back he said lay my hands upon the post there's a possibility i wish the church could see that there's a possibility of a real revival what did he do he raised up his sockets he had no eyes towards god and you know what i'm saying sometimes if love to get it that's pretty conditions will if you can't get your act together your soul is more important so important to god in fact that if you have to put you in a situation that you don't like to get your back into the house of god you do it that's what love will do he raised up his sockets towards god i'm about to close they never noticed the moving of his lips as he was sincerely confessing we don't need just a little lord forgive me we need a sincere cleaning up from the pulpit of the janitor they never noticed the tears running down from them sockets when he once had eyes they never noticed the moving of his lips his eyes briny tears streaming down from the sockets he wanted god to make his word once more vindicated to prove jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever once more he thought not a new denomination not a new sectarian but a vindicated word from you god i know you are still god i'm blind i've got off the track i'm not worthy to live let me die with this enemy you raise me up to destroy it and i failed you lord but there's a possibility you'd hear me once more lord once more in dead earnest he prayed he knew what was coming lord just once more once more let me see jesus christ as he was yesterday that's what the church needs confess you're wrong if you're out of the word of god confess it that you're wrong cry out once more lord once more once more lord once more avenge my blindness and give me strength he knew what was going to happen if his prayer was answered do you know what will happen if your prayer is answered tonight your prayer for your house your prayer for your family your prayer for the holy ghost you allow your eyes to be distracted by the world and missing the reality that the devil was creeping into your home but tonight tonight tonight tonight may god remove the scale of spiritual blindness oh god if the body of jesus christ i'm reading the same quote could stand as one and every fiber and every member begin to vibrate with the literal baptism of the holy ghost again not with new members and shaken hands and some creed as a strength began to move into those muscles every fiber began to twist he began to feel himself again feel the presence again feel the power again feel the anointing again and when he did the big wall fell all we need to do today see these denominational walls fall is to get deeply sincere before god to heal these blinded eyes that's been blinded from the word of god blinded by the distractions of the world from the word of god or pentecost or church tonight headstone tabernacle stand at your post this afternoon tonight your post of duty of god's word repent and cry lord lord god once more let me tell you something i'm reading from the prophet you have better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you that's right bring back the old-fashioned prayer meetings anybody with me tonight you see the importance of all of these services and the sighing and the crying people blinded by the news and the life and ambition and making money and doing these things and missing the truth of the reality of this hour bring back the old fashioned prayer meetings the real godly repentance the all-night altar service oh pentecost leave leave this corruption that jezebel has worked among you leave it quickly and return back to the word of the lord away from this hollywood showmanship take turn with your whole heart back to the word of god turn back to the power of the holy ghost you women dress like women you men act like men like sons and daughters of god if the church can only get in that condition if you are ready right now if you are sincere if you really mean business if your eyes are open to see what i'm trying to tell you in a roundabout way if you're sincere then say lord i don't care what it is i'm ready i see the sign i see the sign are you seeing the sign are you seeing the possibility are you seeing the signs of the time and the word being unfolded and the world and the mysteries coming into fruition interviewed now seconds from the closing chapters of this world i know that it's later and we think it's time to come then samson cried lord they poked my eyes out i know that you are god i'm still reading i know you have the power to do it i know you can set me free from these fetters just once more lord just once more lord just once more let there be a camp meeting on the side of a hill and we're in a virtual room tonight most of you i can't even see you most of you nobody could see you let this be between you and god let the holy ghost the presence of the lord fill the room that you were in forget who's next to you forget what's around you and i want you to talk to your god right now just once more as he cried in sincerity i know the price he knew there was a cost there was a cost for redemption there was a cost for restoration there was a cost to change his life around i'm finished shall we bow our heads so what afraid but iran have been closing on that message he said when he began to feel their muscles tighten with the power of god he didn't have to see what was taking place he felt what was taking place do you feel his presence tonight the holy ghost is here tonight he's moving to this virtual camp tonight he's unlimited by time distance or space tonight he didn't have to see what has taken place he felt what a secret place he began to twist his shoulders and when he did down weld the building that day he conquered he killed more philistines than he did all the days of his life once more lord we've messed up we've organized we've broke up our brotherhood we have separated our fellowship fighting one another and the devil is sitting back watching us whip one another in homes in marriages oh come on church tonight tonight tonight tonight is that a regular bible study tonight once more lord god bring back to the holy ghost
