[11:01] 10 there we put a marker by Hebrews
[11:09] 12:22 2:24
[11:25] man when I read from Genesis chapter 4
[11:29] verses 9 and 10 and the Lord said unto
[11:35] Cain where is I where is Abel thy
[11:38] brother and he said I know not am I my
[11:42] brother's keeper and he said and he said
[11:46] what has dog done the voice of thy
[11:49] brother's blood crieth unto me from the
[11:52] ground and from Hebrews 12 to Hebrews 12
[12:00] 22 to 24 but here come on to Mount Zion
[12:05] and on to the city of the Living God the
[12:08] heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable
[12:11] company of angels to the General
[12:14] Assembly and Church of the firstborn
[12:17] which are written in heaven and to God
[12:20] the judge of all and to the spirits of
[12:22] just men made perfect and to Jesus the
[12:27] mediator of the New Covenant and to the
[12:30] blood of sprinkling that speaketh better
[12:33] things than that of Abel in the Lord of
[12:37] the blessing today we know
[12:47] Almighty God
[12:50] father we are so needy
[12:54] all we need your presence to come
[12:56] tonight to complete control of this
[12:59] silver slowly without you Lord we can't
[13:03] do nothing what we regard and very few
[13:07] present or common take over the surface
[13:09] and speak dear teacher
[13:12] why I am so needy tonight Lord if I am
[13:15] bigger than sufficient than myself Lord
[13:18] has said that your grace is sufficient
[13:20] for me that his strength is made perfect
[13:21] in weakness so many common strengths me
[13:25] tonight from
[13:28] anoint your world is in my heart Lord
[13:30] I'll speak to you cheering tonight speak
[13:33] to every heart tonight leader leave here
[13:35] blessed anointed and charged with your
[13:38] presence set the captive free and
[13:41] delivered with a bomb and he loads on
[13:43] the sick and family and we be careful to
[13:46] give you all the priests to give you all
[13:47] the honor give you on the glory awesome
[13:50] Jesus Christ amen
[13:52] young obvious it's tonight tonight for
[13:58] thought I want to speak on the voice of
[14:00] the blood the blood of Jesus has been
[14:10] speaking since it fell upon the earth
[14:17] had been speaking for seven churches
[14:21] when Cain killed Abel Abel blood cry out
[14:27] from the inert and to God and so the
[14:32] blood of Jesus Christ has been crying
[14:34] out on the earth from the earth before
[14:37] God for every name that was written in
[14:42] blood from before the foundation of the
[14:46] world so that night I want to take a
[14:50] look at the natural blood and a
[14:52] spiritual blood prophesied the natural
[14:55] types the spiritual so if we could get a
[15:01] look the function of the natural blood
[15:06] then we can see the reality of the
[15:11] spiritual blood for the life is in the
[15:16] blood
[15:17] I'm go to Alec trust Israel do not drink
[15:21] blood if you kill an animal pour off the
[15:25] blood because the life is in the blood
[15:30] and your blood speaks on your behalf the
[15:36] same way Jesus blood is speaking our
[15:40] behalf so today many people are coming
[15:45] to recognize that what they taught about
[15:49] themself and who they thought they would
[15:50] they have been deceived because the life
[15:55] in the blood is speaking something
[15:57] different and what they taught with this
[16:02] thing that they have DNA testing and to
[16:08] know the generations
[16:11] you came from the blood testing the
[16:14] blood and if I not know they are not who
[16:19] they thought they would so people think
[16:25] there was pure and believed this type of
[16:29] person discovering that they are so
[16:32] mixed up that they been living a lie all
[16:37] the time because the blood now speaking
[16:40] about what is the life in the DNA in
[16:45] their blood to the ancestral DNA tests
[16:48] that people are doing today so people
[16:52] are getting shocking discoveries about
[16:55] themselves because of what their blood
[16:59] is seeing to them and so it is in the
[17:04] natural so it is in this spirit because
[17:08] people and believers and Christians are
[17:12] saying this and saying that and say the
[17:16] other about themselves but the life in
[17:20] the blood is speaking something
[17:22] different
[17:24] so they are deceiving themselves by
[17:29] believing a lie and they're going to be
[17:32] damned by it so I want to show you
[17:36] something all the natural blood God give
[17:39] us a defense system in our bodies but
[17:44] there is nothing like it no ears it is
[17:48] so efficient and it is so complicated
[17:52] they are all type of warriors called
[17:57] cells in the white blood that have
[18:01] specific function to fight off and to
[18:05] ward off infections so I want you to
[18:09] look and see what happens in the natural
[18:13] blood before we go to the spirit because
[18:17] in the natural blood your blood is fight
[18:19] now demons in the physical realm in the
[18:24] form of illnesses and sicknesses in the
[18:28] spiritual realm the blood of Jesus is
[18:31] fighting on your behalf
[18:33] all them demons and spirits but the
[18:38] Devils are released him after you and
[18:42] it's only because of the blood of Jesus
[18:45] that is speaking on your behalf you have
[18:47] protection underneath the blood that you
[18:50] could survive and withstand the
[18:53] onslaught of the Devils that I ruin that
[18:59] is why in Egypt but in that Enza was
[19:03] about to strike go to al Moses let them
[19:07] take a lamb and take the blood put them
[19:12] the lentil of the door top on both sides
[19:14] when I see the Blood I will pass over
[19:18] them the blood was speaking for every
[19:22] name that was in the house the blood was
[19:25] a protection from the Death Angel for
[19:28] every individual that was under the
[19:31] blood
[19:31] so if an Egyptian recognized what the
[19:36] Israelites was doing and he take and do
[19:39] the same thing forgetting the same
[19:41] protection recorded blood was speaking
[19:44] so you as an individual have to know
[19:50] that the blood is speaking on your
[19:54] behalf so in the natural blood when
[20:01] something invades your system there are
[20:05] blood cells one is called a macrophage
[20:08] equally rough on to the invader
[20:11] and send signals of other cells you
[20:15] started coming there'll be a series of
[20:16] attacks they have cells called natural
[20:19] killer cells will come and scoot some
[20:22] highly toxic chemicals against the
[20:25] organism you have a very high fever
[20:27] because they want to bring the
[20:30] temperature very high that this organism
[20:31] cannot survive you will lose your
[20:34] appetite in what no food is a system
[20:37] because there is a war region in your
[20:40] body after the voice over there cells
[20:44] would heat up everything else then they
[20:46] leave what is called an antibody in
[20:50] circulation the antibody that is left in
[20:55] circulation after the war in your blood
[20:57] is over remains in circulation in case
[21:02] that seemed over missing combat to
[21:06] attack you again so there is a specific
[21:10] antibody after every attack in your
[21:14] system there is a specific antibody that
[21:17] stays in circulation in your bloodstream
[21:20] so in case that particular organ come
[21:22] back I can it is yet to defeat at one
[21:25] time you won't go 26 me something my
[21:27] just feel funny time where you feel it
[21:29] you will get to this it was that
[21:31] immediately so then they could take your
[21:35] blood
[21:36] Kyle to the lab and check it out and see
[21:40] well your fought against yellow fever
[21:42] dengue fever
[21:44] can attack against this so they can
[21:46] identify already because they are
[21:48] specific antibodies against this
[21:52] specific attack that you face it remains
[21:57] in circulation to protect you
[21:59] so that is the natural blood and that is
[22:04] all the natural operate now the life is
[22:08] in the blood is what able to do a lot
[22:12] but the Brennan said the life in the
[22:16] blood cell of Jesus is the Holy Spirit
[22:21] and that life come back upon the
[22:24] believer in the form of the baptism of
[22:26] the Holy Ghost and that lies speak for
[22:30] you so when Christ died on the cross and
[22:33] the PSSI his blood came upon the earth
[22:38] this blood of God is so powerful it came
[22:43] and sanctified the entire Earth I want
[22:48] you to get this Jesus blood sanctified
[22:53] the entire when it fell upon it when God
[23:00] sent the flood it baptized in order to
[23:06] justify it because Adam for affected the
[23:09] earth and God have to redeem the earth
[23:14] and this one process of redemption just
[23:21] if we can scientific asian and then I
[23:23] have baptism and the same we didn't
[23:26] really it he deals with the individual
[23:29] so you have to go to the same process so
[23:33] when Jesus blood fell upon the earth its
[23:35] sanctify the entire everything were
[23:39] certified under the Old Testament God
[23:42] actively chose Israel
[23:43] clean and unclean meats but when the
[23:48] blood of Jesus Christ came upon it it
[23:50] cleanse every meat there was not
[23:54] complete
[23:56] that's how powerful this blood is
[24:00] because when Peeta was Ali host of
[24:03] godsend on the sheet with every form of
[24:08] creeping crawling in a meeting on the I
[24:12] tell Peter killing it Peter said not me
[24:15] Lord nothing uncommon no unclean has
[24:19] ever enter into my mouth
[24:22] the voice said what God has sanctified
[24:25] do not call it unclean because the blood
[24:28] of Jesus Christ hurt upon it all these
[24:32] things were sanctified Paul was a
[24:36] Pharisee of the Pharisees he came along
[24:40] in Timothy and said every creature of
[24:43] God is good and nothing is to be refused
[24:48] it is sanctified by the Word of God and
[24:51] pray we are people today eating some
[24:54] things that you never think or didn't
[24:57] did frogs they snake not eaten cockroach
[25:01] they wrapped they eaten everything
[25:04] because the world said every creature it
[25:09] is a summer every creature of God is
[25:12] good and nothing is to be refused it is
[25:18] sanctified by the Word of God and that
[25:24] is how powerful the blood of Jesus is so
[25:30] on the day of Pentecost the life in the
[25:34] blood came upon 120 believers in the
[25:41] form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[25:44] Jesus was made a high priest after the
[25:48] order of Melchizedek he had to do his
[25:54] priestly duty in a blind blood for the
[26:00] blood to speak the Bible said he entered
[26:02] in once within the veil and obtained
[26:05] first eternal Redemption
[26:08] he took his own blood and sprinted upon
[26:11] the mercy seat in heaven to apply the
[26:15] blood for you and me and for every name
[26:20] in the Lamb's Book of Life and that
[26:24] blood been speaking ever since so every
[26:29] attack that the devil brought truly
[26:32] Church ages the blood of Jesus Christ
[26:36] overcame and defeat the devil and left
[26:43] an antibody to extend any other attack
[26:50] of the devil that come the same way
[26:54] so he told its chains at Ephesus
[26:59] you have tried those who say there are
[27:03] puzzles and a knot and you found them to
[27:06] be liars and you have them that all the
[27:10] doctrinal eighteens but faith in the
[27:14] world in that age defeated all them
[27:19] Devils when I come to the next age they
[27:23] came up with doctrine of balaam virtue
[27:26] when thought as a thunder and defeated
[27:31] all them spirits so for seven church
[27:35] ages the blood of Jesus been defeated
[27:40] every attack but it never bought against
[27:45] the church and live in the evidence by a
[27:50] virtue that thundered against the enemy
[27:53] in average an average the voice let him
[27:58] have an air hear what the spirit said to
[28:01] the church because the Spirit was
[28:03] speaking to the blood the blood is the
[28:06] life and the life is the Holy Spirit so
[28:09] at every age the spirit that was
[28:13] released for the age was speaking
[28:16] Express
[28:18] to the church in the age and given them
[28:21] the overcoming power to become the
[28:23] spirits that was released by Sita so for
[28:28] seven church ages the blood of Jesus
[28:30] Christ means begin now we come to the
[28:34] fullness of time we come to the last age
[28:41] the age of me Odisha so the fullness of
[28:49] the blood must be applied so the
[28:54] fullness of the life that is in the
[28:58] blood have to return and brother Branham
[29:03] said at the altar of the seven seals
[29:07] revelation 10 the full Word of God is to
[29:11] be born into manifestation again and
[29:15] vindicated by the Spirit of the court in
[29:18] its full strength as it was written
[29:22] manifesting the same we are doing the
[29:24] same thing in other words the same Jesus
[29:30] that worked it and Galilee had to come
[29:35] back well as Solomon looks sent in today
[29:40] in a Solomon to manifest the return of
[29:46] the fullness of the life of the blood
[29:50] that went to the seventh eighth ages the
[29:52] blood that was speaking and every age
[29:57] the prophet said the bride will be the
[30:01] mercy seat of God upon the earth
[30:06] there'll be no mercy nowhere else but
[30:09] the bride because the fullness of the
[30:13] blood going to be in the bride because
[30:15] the fullness of the life would be
[30:18] manifested in the bride the fullness of
[30:20] the pork on both we manifested in the
[30:22] bride he said bye and true the bride was
[30:25] great to fulfill all that Ben
[30:28] side of the Virgin he said they were
[30:30] here directly from God ask what of the
[30:33] day of Pentecost because the bride were
[30:36] to be the mouthpiece of God so look at
[30:47] this here we can talk Ian prophet coming
[30:53] to the platform and same good evening
[30:57] friends and that was the voice of God
[31:03] he said come to the unveiling of the
[31:08] mighty God before us and we unveiled God
[31:14] the world Jesus Christ the same
[31:17] yesterday today and forever for the
[31:20] wouldn'ta see and they couldn't see
[31:22] Christ the professor why they cannot see
[31:29] this he said because the Scriptures
[31:33] prophesied they will be blind
[31:37] he said the blindly additions cannot see
[31:42] this anima be revealed he said God has
[31:46] come down in the midst of his people and
[31:49] performing the same signs same Merkers
[31:52] and same wonders and they cannot see it
[31:57] the same as a mental telepathy the saint
[32:01] is fanaticism and it did not recognize
[32:05] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[32:08] and forever
[32:09] but the panama's given the Ministry of
[32:12] Jesus Christ
[32:13] so all too is British coming up he was
[32:18] revealing Christ they saw so much of
[32:21] Christ in him the thought he was guys
[32:24] but Jesus Christ Himself was going to
[32:27] come as son ahmud to take up his own
[32:30] ministry as from a man he said come on
[32:33] the three sons named Solomon son of God
[32:39] and sana David he said before he comes
[32:42] as
[32:42] son of DVD millennium you have to come
[32:44] back as Solomon again she came back as
[32:48] Solomon in this generation and spoke
[32:54] spirit spoken words he said you must be
[32:58] born again of water and spirit of word
[33:04] and spirit so we've been feeding on the
[33:09] unfeeling by the word of the Son of Man
[33:17] therefore the Prophet identified that
[33:21] the foolish virgins miss the rapture
[33:27] because they reject the fullness of the
[33:30] atonement they reject the head part they
[33:36] reject the voice of the blood that Tunde
[33:40] seven times to these seven churches that
[33:44] defeated the devil at every one of his
[33:47] tricks when the two anointed word speak
[33:50] it is the voice of horde to recheck it
[33:52] is remove the candlesticks it was so
[33:57] simple that they couldn't see because
[34:01] God hide himself in simplicity and
[34:04] reveal himself in the same and they
[34:08] couldn't see the simplicity of the
[34:11] Living God standing neither man with a
[34:14] seventh grade education and no problem
[34:19] said he said before sudden boom they
[34:24] receive the last sign called will in
[34:30] flesh when he said that somebody in the
[34:36] condition said eyes not gold is he a
[34:39] saint that's not what but even : elude
[34:44] him that is God in flesh you see after
[34:49] that trouble
[34:51] and he said God has done the same thing
[34:56] this generation and to prove that he
[34:59] turn his back to the people and started
[35:02] this in the people's heart showing that
[35:06] no man could do that but God so it is
[35:09] the same chord that was here with Abram
[35:12] before Saddam boon is now stand with
[35:15] Abraham's seed and he format the bride
[35:18] doing the same thing given a promise of
[35:21] a time a life he came to Abraham I did
[35:26] my promise of a visitation in the time
[35:29] of life he give us a promise that seven
[35:32] thunders with the author's voices to the
[35:35] group who could take the word handed
[35:37] year he gave us a promise he going to
[35:39] write this trail again but they reject
[35:43] the voice of God that was veiled in the
[35:46] Prophet thundering in sweetness and
[35:48] purity and an undefined life but the
[35:51] problem was hiding a lot of things from
[35:58] those that or did not to see it he will
[36:01] settings to trough people that are
[36:05] ordained to be true love jesus told His
[36:12] disciples resume eat my flesh and drink

[36:17] who'll be called come down to the twelve
[36:21] you say I have chosen you and one of you
[36:25] is a devil
[36:30] there was a lot people I remember a
[36:32] bandit didn't know who he was
[36:34] although he was a prophet that no
[36:36] revelation what is happening wrong about
[36:40] him when brother Branham preached the
[36:46] seventh cygnets
[36:48] he what he did he said this seven seal
[36:52] when it open it is a tree full
[36:56] revelation he identified the tree full
[36:59] revelation of secretary shall fall
[37:02] sixteen I shout our voice on a job and
[37:05] he put that back on the d70 he saw his
[37:10] picture and a full of it it is the seven
[37:12] thunders banging one two five six seven
[37:16] one time underneath he said his second
[37:21] full pass across him we didn't reckon a
[37:23] great was understand but he took the
[37:31] seventh seal and identified that is the
[37:35] common of the Lord when he puts his
[37:38] tattoo a perfect man in 62 he said when
[37:41] the last seal open it reveal Leo the
[37:46] Lion the second coming of the Lord Jesus
[37:51] when the priest says is the time he said
[37:54] if it is the common of the Lord
[37:57] don't be scared he recognized it was the
[38:01] first full of the cup of the Lord we
[38:04] gotta hide it when he came and preached
[38:09] this message the message came back to
[38:17] the Jews the trump visa trumpets any
[38:25] FISA trumpets he wanted it he said this
[38:29] 7c is open it is the common of the Lord
[38:35] his
[38:36] hide in the coming of the Lord by seeing
[38:41] the Seventh Seal is moving because it is
[38:45] the coming of the Lord but when he
[38:49] preached a rapture
[38:50] you identify he said what is a shout
[38:57] this is 65 is about to leave now
[39:00] so he's clarifying so many things that
[39:03] was hidden all along
[39:07] so he's identifying this out of seven
[39:10] thunders he said it is a messenger
[39:15] getting the people together he said it's
[39:19] a message going forward to gather the
[39:22] bride and then he said seven thunders
[39:26] gather the bride so it was these seven
[39:31] thunders which was Christ the Lion of
[39:34] the tribe of Judah speaking truly
[39:39] prophet given the promise for the bride
[39:45] revival he said all revival that there's
[39:48] no revival know where all the arrivals
[39:51] are over you say there is no revival for
[39:55] the church all the revivals are over so
[39:59] they have coconut galleons and then they
[40:04] turn and say the bride hasn't had a
[40:08] revival yet has a revival yet because
[40:17] she must have the revival he said it
[40:21] will take the seven I don't understand
[40:24] because at the time it wasn't known what
[40:28] he told us was he said we'll take the
[40:31] seven thunders back there to wake up and
[40:36] many commonly forty I say wait until
[40:40] those seven thunders uttered its voices
[40:44] to the group who could take the word
[40:47] and handed here they go into cotton they
[40:49] would have sliced they shot me heaven
[40:51] they better do this do that you be the
[40:53] voice of God speaking back the world
[40:55] award they called the voice of God going
[40:57] to be in the bride so God been hide him
[41:04] and reveal himself in the message Christ
[41:09] we finished all worldly prophecy God is
[41:12] in his word hiding himself from the
[41:16] great intellectuals and real himself the
[41:19] babes such as Whitlow
[41:23] listen 98% of the people new message
[41:28] don't know what the voice spoke in June
[41:33] of 1933 when bura balan was baptizing
[41:37] the same teen they know what the
[41:44] Prophet said when the Prophet said he
[41:49] said that in order to get people off of
[41:53] him and all truly master Harry policy as
[41:58] John the Baptist sent so are you sent
[42:01] with a message the forest second command
[42:04] The Voice didn't see a single message
[42:07] before his never said that to burn
[42:12] everything he said that because if you
[42:15] take the English language as meaning the
[42:18] same way as John the Baptist was sent to
[42:23] form the first coming of the Lord so and
[42:27] I use scent to fall in a second coming
[42:31] let me add sang with another message not
[42:33] as John was sent because the scripture
[42:36] said behold I send my messenger before
[42:38] my face to be played away before me
[42:40] I mean well has to be whole I send you
[42:43] Elijah if you want to know exactly what
[42:50] the voice said about abandoned tombstone
[42:53] in his commission
[42:56] exactly what the voice said if you go to
[42:59] the den on the door there's a screw that
[43:03] said exactly what the voice said in all
[43:06] the messengers is only about three
[43:09] messages you can find about a fandom
[43:11] aptly said what the voice said never
[43:14] said a message and I am Minister Singh
[43:17] is the message not the person so that
[43:25] keeps saying it is the message and the
[43:27] message but they don't know what is what
[43:29] about a message but Abraham said this
[43:32] message is the same message that Luther
[43:36] preached with something extra added he
[43:42] said this message is the same message
[43:43] Wesley preached with something extra
[43:46] added he said this message is the same
[43:49] message the Pentecostal preached with
[43:51] something extra added the revelation of
[43:54] the seven seals because is the
[44:01] revelation of the seven see which reveal
[44:03] Christ in the Sevenfold personage of his
[44:06] being as he walked through the midst of
[44:08] the seven golden candlesticks that will
[44:10] feel every other mystery that was hidden
[44:13] in the Bible it will really seven
[44:17] spirits of God that was veiled in that
[44:20] simple man that worked in Galilee it
[44:29] reveal Christ in the fullness of the
[44:36] core he'll go to seven compound with
[44:41] them tell titles in the Old Testament to
[44:44] represent the seven spirits aboard
[44:52] and butter balance said this is the
[44:54] messenger teaching I will tidy man that
[44:58] is going to be redeemed by the blood of
[44:59] the Lord Jesus I'm going to be an
[45:01] eternal Church it at the end of the
[45:04] seals the statue of a perfect man you
[45:09] say after you have added to your feet
[45:13] these seven things seven requirements
[45:16] the same voice of the speaking blood to
[45:20] the seven Church inches that defeated
[45:22] the devil's got to be in you because the
[45:27] leader of Hell has been uncovered and
[45:29] all the devil's of the seven truth is
[45:31] he'll be released against the bride what
[45:36] a balance that this is the most
[45:37] deceitful and decision of all the inches
[45:41] because people worshipping the devil
[45:44] think in the worshipping God in church
[45:50] he said the same where Satan came and
[45:53] deceived Eve with the world she won't
[45:58] even answer is the same word that God
[46:01] gives Eve cure deceive with no cause he
[46:06] had not one would I me identify that
[46:13] Satan has his bride that she is going to
[46:18] put on this plane because he came the
[46:22] god of Edom and disrupt Adam Brad and he
[46:28] came after Jesus bride and got a tire in
[46:31] Asia Council and from them he arrived in
[46:34] this bride and as fast as they come out
[46:38] he sent his host of demons fallen angel
[46:43] spirits in the same message the tabie
[46:46] people and make them believe that they
[46:49] all right
[46:54] make them believe that they have all
[46:58] these books when they believe
[47:01] this message they have to Hollywood is a
[47:03] lie but a panel for that Baptist spirits
[47:06] for all his ministry he fought against
[47:10] that back the doctrine when you believe
[47:12] you receive then he annoyed some of them
[47:15] to say that they are holy ghost when
[47:17] they prefer that you are not the Holy
[47:19] Ghost I am NOT yolivos
[47:21] he spoke playing for everyone to see
[47:25] I know men stand abhorrent saying I am
[47:28] he who knows the devil using the same
[47:34] deception upon a burnin preach the
[47:36] message and 9:20 n times he said it
[47:39] genuine Holy Spirit upon these people
[47:43] and the force because they teach in Rome
[47:47] not the Spirit is a genuine Holy Spirit
[47:51] upon them by the teaching force in the
[48:01] message look away to Jesus
[48:04] but abandon speak about what happened on
[48:10] your high River when the voice came no
[48:12] and he said I sent the phone the first
[48:18] coming so I sent with a message then
[48:20] later down with that same message he
[48:22] said 12 years after he walk in our
[48:25] church one word I spoke in tongues one
[48:29] parental interpret he sang what they
[48:32] said was exactly what the voice say at
[48:37] the river he went to one brother and he
[48:42] oxy missus do your way she was skeptical
[48:44] about tongues interpret he said don't
[48:46] you know that brother you say no you
[48:47] ain't never know never know
[48:49] and then Peregrine's repeat exactly what
[48:53] do you say so you want to see it and
[48:56] read for yourself
[48:57] take the message look away to Jesus
[49:00] and you will see where brother Bonham
[49:02] identify what the tones and he puffs he
[49:05] said and I said Johnny back to a center
[49:08] for the first common logic so I you sent
[49:11] the phone a second coming he had to see
[49:14] exactly what the prophecy because that
[49:18] is what before he said so many things
[49:22] are said and I hid but the voice of the
[49:30] blood going to show you the middle line
[49:37] because when were repelled until after
[49:40] the seventh seal night and just
[49:42] identified the seven zero he turns the
[49:45] Seventh Seal is opened Republic and that
[49:49] two hundred people and the city seven C
[49:52] is open forever after come back to
[49:54] twenty seven C and V D seven thunders
[49:57] just by the statement to offer who will
[50:00] be cold and they believe in this return
[50:03] ministry as you have to come back by
[50:08] that statement so you have to hear the
[50:13] voice within the voice because it's the
[50:17] voice of God will in the Prophet same
[50:21] things for the elect here and to trough
[50:26] others who not ordained to hear he said
[50:32] the bride will be the final voice to the
[50:36] final age and God is going to confirm
[50:42] the fullest version but by the bride
[50:46] because the Spirit the bride and the
[50:50] Prophet to be seeing the same thing go
[50:55] be speaking the same thing the voice of
[50:58] the blood want to be speaking the same
[51:00] thing nothing different and what she
[51:06] will say would have already been said in
[51:09] the world
[51:12] so you have to hear the particular voice
[51:17] you can't take what I see in for granted
[51:20] no you have to check me out check what
[51:23] I'm saying
[51:24] a sister came to me a while ago some
[51:26] watch Eternia but Terry you know I
[51:29] didn't find me they spoke about this
[51:31] together I see well looking the third
[51:34] seal you look at it and I felt so good
[51:38] to note this sister is on the word check
[51:43] it out what is being said but some
[51:48] people they just take whatever
[51:50] administer say and educate all you have
[51:53] to be like the Bereans you have to
[51:56] search the scriptures and see if these
[51:58] things be so or not you have to search
[52:04] the scriptures listen remember abandoned
[52:07] went to South Africa and go tell and go
[52:12] to do but I spent a month and these guys
[52:16] who brought him down did made their own
[52:19] itinerary super Abraham to take tell him
[52:24] don't ever tell me this is what I want
[52:27] you to do you know what was one big
[52:32] problem with these men in that itinerary
[52:37] these Africans people what the ball from
[52:43] Germany informing nothing
[52:45] they had believed that the native
[52:49] Africans do not have a soul you know
[52:58] when by the balance financially till it
[53:00] meets in the axe we are the natives he
[53:02] did see one natively make three
[53:04] defensive is didn't see one intentional
[53:06] when they had the equipment both taking
[53:09] they take one man's attempt are
[53:10] abandoned if you take his itinerary even
[53:12] the city natives because what a panel
[53:15] went Africa without bulletins for the
[53:18] natives
[53:18] I was only in Durban that is natives was
[53:25] we able to gain because of the apartheid
[53:27] system and the first meter per rep Adam
[53:32] had when he landed South Africa the
[53:34] first vision he saw was a bus Magdalene
[53:38] and a fella were a broken foot rock
[53:41] watch comedy bus in watching any bus
[53:43] came over the condition any city fella
[53:45] and he was the first person I call or
[53:48] domiciled was on this one but I'm said
[53:51] why will they take me from a please God
[53:55] is doing so much miracles and said him
[53:58] take him out clean and same quite odisha
[54:03] leave all these native people here to
[54:07] serve their own people because they
[54:09] believe this Bluff no soul prepared to
[54:12] deal with them on that
[54:15] so people does believe what they want to
[54:19] believe but if you are Christian I
[54:24] really Bible you will see where in acts
[54:28] it the Holy Spirit to Philip from a
[54:35] revival and centered Gaza turn it yo
[54:39] plain UNEP to set him down with a
[54:42] revival to Ethiopia to Africa and these
[54:48] people believe in these that people do
[54:50] not have a soul so people believe in
[54:55] what they want to believe and the
[54:59] clayman they believe the Prophet
[55:05] this is where you got to recognize he's
[55:10] honorable say any message any messenger
[55:13] because Satan is any message making a
[55:16] mess in the very message in the very
[55:22] message you will be shocked when you
[55:26] recognize the kind of deception that
[55:30] people but a balance is not the
[55:33] bootleggers going to be disappointed on
[55:38] the yet just his the people I put on the
[55:40] time coming to church I'm singing and
[55:42] having I didn't believe that this Living
[55:43] God they are the ones going to be
[55:49] disappointed because they wouldn't
[55:53] recognize that they was deceived all
[55:55] alone because as I said you must be born
[56:00] again and to be born again is to get the
[56:07] baptism of the Spirit of Christ in you
[56:11] that the life of the blood that no
[56:15] transfused into you as the Holy Ghost
[56:18] could propels me out to manifest those
[56:22] virtues that I pledge live or die Cinco
[56:27] John let these virtues live in me this
[56:32] is what must be our prayer we got to see
[56:36] the life of the blood speaking on our
[56:40] behalf we got to recognize that there is
[56:44] something more than our human spirit
[56:47] that is in us that given us the victory
[56:53] not just living a more alive because
[56:56] people live in a more life and I do have
[56:57] the oligos when I Brown said to be
[57:01] baptized will goes 24 hours a day and
[57:03] still misses because it gets done maybe
[57:06] one spirit may get in your flesh shake
[57:09] it dance in the spirit speak in tongues
[57:11] and prophecy son he listened and
[57:12] silvadene soon
[57:17] the predestinated seed that were put in
[57:21] your soul from before the foundation the
[57:24] Wizzle the only who's got to come upon
[57:28] that seed to kick it and to make it a
[57:31] life that the voice that the blood going
[57:33] to speak on your behalf
[57:38] Paul in speaking to the Hebrews who are
[57:44] the Lawkeeper they know all along and
[57:47] Paul had to show them all these shadows
[57:52] and all the types that isn't the law is
[57:55] pertaining to this Christ died so I tell
[58:01] them in Hebrews chapter 12 didn't come
[58:05] to Mount Sinai you know where the
[58:09] thunders and the flames and the
[58:13] blackness remanded sheikha Moza
[58:15] mercy exceedingly he said come to Mount
[58:19] Zion the city of the Living God the
[58:24] heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable
[58:28] company of angels that is the city
[58:32] representative in the pyramid that is
[58:38] the city not amongst an think about it
[58:46] this is God's dwelling place this is
[58:51] what tabernacle the Most High God
[58:54] doesn't dwell in temples made with hands
[58:57] as Stephen Ottertail describes and if
[59:00] Rises it's a body God has prepared and
[59:07] by one spirit we are all baptized into
[59:10] that one body so you have to press with
[59:13] all eyes in you to be baptized into the
[59:16] body to be in the church triumphant to
[59:19] be in the serious bride there's only one
[59:22] way to anything just as it did on the
[59:24] day of Pentecost that you can become a
[59:26] live voice
[59:28] seven live voices can be done during to
[59:32] you to others it could float to others
[59:36] they got to see it flowing out others
[59:39] the life of Christ not talk I live the
[59:46] life behind the name that makes the
[59:51] demons tremble touch Thunder
[1:00:04] this is monk Sian the bride of Jesus
[1:00:10] Christ this is what you must manifest by
[1:00:19] the life of the blood being applied the
[1:00:23] token being applied to you whenever the
[1:00:26] preachments fully token coming the end
[1:00:29] of the messenger he said three people he
[1:00:31] said many of you believe you have the
[1:00:34] Holy Ghost
[1:00:35] he said about your dog have it and I
[1:00:38] know it the person of the Holy Ghost in
[1:00:43] the Prophet was telling people that they
[1:00:47] believe they have the Holy Ghost and
[1:00:49] they didn't have it and as the same
[1:00:53] thing today many people the message
[1:00:55] believe they have the Holy Ghost and
[1:00:58] they don't have it so they're not
[1:01:00] seeking faith do not crying faith they
[1:01:04] not sighs wait but what about
[1:01:06] identifying one week or habit for
[1:01:08] everything
[1:01:09] you got a sigh and I got a cry he said
[1:01:13] God put it in this way as a child he
[1:01:19] said you could get more than telling a
[1:01:20] child listen I put up bail here in your
[1:01:22] field only ring the bell see that will
[1:01:25] work when the child gets hungry they
[1:01:28] will ball and ball and ball until you
[1:01:32] come and see them and if you are child
[1:01:36] and God and they recognize you don't
[1:01:39] have the Holy Ghost Brown said okay
[1:01:41] all done both on your head and bohu
[1:01:44] whatever it is I'll do to get it you're
[1:01:46] going to do it
[1:01:47] because I recognize you've got to get it
[1:01:50] it is absolute essential and compulsory
[1:01:53] and necessary that you receive the
[1:01:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost because the
[1:01:58] always late
[1:02:00] time is short the world is falling apart
[1:02:05] friends you got to be sealing to the
[1:02:08] kingdom of God before the Harbour Bridge

[1:02:18] rest night and day until your MIDI
[1:02:21] requirements you got to meet these
[1:02:23] requirements you say when God look down
[1:02:29] and see these requirements then he see
[1:02:32] you with the true baptism of the Holy
[1:02:35] Ghost which is charged then you become a
[1:02:37] sealed unit of the Lord God Almighty
[1:02:41] then you are push on he pleased and it
[1:02:46] gives us something to shake the nation's
[1:02:48] it's individuals possessing the
[1:02:51] individual inheritance in the promise on

[1:02:59] and he saw the bride matching he said

[1:03:15] chest the Word of God for the age in
[1:03:19] which they live and every age the Word

[1:03:55] scripture in every age friends the word
[1:04:00] allotted for the age was made flesh
[1:04:07] you are the flesh of the word for this
[1:04:13] age Malachi said behold I send you
[1:04:17] Elijah before the great and dreadful day
[1:04:20] of the Lord he shall turn the hearts of
