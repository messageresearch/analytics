praise God how many appreciate about Isaac here also this morning the ministry praise God Amen we continue to remember his wife also in pray she's still uh recovering amen but Lord has put a thought on my heart this morning so if you would uh turn with me to your Bibles um I'd like to turn to two portion of scripture amen and the Psalms want to read from Psalms chapter 123 and we also want to read from Romans chapter 8 so we'll turn first over to Psalms chapter 123 and and um and we'll read there amen and then we'll read Romans okay so first scripture from the psalm Psalms 123 it says unto thee lift I up mine eyes oh thou that dwellest in the heavens behold as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress so our eyes wait upon the Lord Our God until that he have mercy upon us here's why have mercy upon us oh Lord have mercy upon us for we are exceedingly filled with contempt our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease and with a contempt of the proud and now turning over to Romans chapter 8 um I want to read from verse 14 amen amen Romans 8 and verse4 amen we know Romans 8 is a very powerful scripture but we want to read just I just want to zero in on this part here amen we we'll preach from this text this morning so Romans 8:14 says for as many as are LED led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God Amen for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God may God a blessing through his word let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we have read your word Lord and Lord it take your Holy Spirit this morning now to rightly divide this word Lord we pray this morning Lord father that your anointing would drop down in a special way and we pray a bless Lord this service is about to go forth Lord the people are in the spirit Lord they in the atmosphere of worship and praise and now God as we turn over to this portion of the service we pray anointing drop down lord and create a space where we could get in oh Father and see your your your glory Lord father to see what you want from us Lord father to see how we're Measuring Up with the gospel Lord father at this 11th Hour Lord where the Earth is falling apart Lord we want to be anchored in you tonight this morning rather we pray your Holy Spirit be with us in a special way bless us Lord bless the word as said go forth take me out of the way Lord and use me for your honor For Your Glory this morning Lord if I could be a help to somebody this morning then let your will be done Lord father we pray a special pray now for your your servant brother ID our pastor Lord and he's traveling on the fields Lord we pray keep him safe Lord he and the elders that are with him Lord father we pray keep them safe also Lord for we live in perilous times Lord but your angel is able to keep us Lord hallelujah with us soever we go as father Lord so we pray encamp around them today Father and and bless them as they travel through Kentucky Lord and through the services day we pray you bless the services there also Lord and father we pray you bless us once more now this morning as we enter your your word Lord grant it Lord in Jesus name we pray and ask it amen and amen you may have your seats this morning amen praise God hallelujah you love the Lord this morning amen amen amen praise God you know when we come in the house of God we ought to have a praise on our lips Hallelujah and a song in our heart Hallelujah because it was God that brought us out and it's God that gathered us here this morning amen amen amen the world says we're crazy this morning they said we're crazy for shouting they we're crazy for worshiping we're crazy for praising God but I don't mind being crazy this morning just let me be crazy for my Jesus amen amen let me act heretical this morning let me act hysterical this morning but I don't mind getting crazy for Jesus this morning is anybody feel that way this morning amen amen and amen so I have a title I have a title this morning which is my uh my title is coming from Romans 8 the spirit of adoption and my inspiration is the spirit itself beareth witness amen and amen isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah so Romans 8 is a very spiritual scripture it speaks about the spirit it speaks about the influence of the spirit it speaks about what the spirit is supposed to manifest which is Sons and Daughters of God in the last days we are promised to see God again in human form isn't that right God once again putting on skin God once again hiding behind human veils is that right God once again is going to pick up 16 elements just like he did in Jesus just like he did in the prophet God once again wants to put on your skin he wants to put on my skin he wants to put on your shoes he wants to wear my tie he wants to speak through your lips oh H he has no hands but your hands this morning and this spirit is useless unless it has a body to use oh can somebody say Amen oh if you could use anything Lord come on and use me take my hands take my feet touch my hearts speak through me this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Heen amen hallelujah and when you're in the spirit God could use you when you're in the spirit God could speak to you when you're in the natural you are subject to the things of the natural you're subject to the outer court if the sun shine you're happy and if the rain fall you're D and out but not those that walk by the spirit those that walk after the flesh are subject to the things of the flesh but those that walk after the spirit they don't care about the flesh to them flesh is flesh but spirit is Spirit oh is not right Marvel that I say not unto you you must be born again oh hallelujah hallelujah and when you are born again you are no longer subject to this world the devil has no hold on you the devil has no more influence on you the devil cannot play with your mind no more because there's something within you that's keeping the rains isn't that right so this morning we in a spiritual battle we in a spiritual warfare and we are fighting against spiritual debt we are fighting fighting against 200,000,000 Devils Hallelujah isn't that right spiritual charges that have been loosed in the end time against the pride with false doctrines false teachings and off the word isn't that right the devil trying to get us off of the word because the word have power in it the word have anointing in it and if you ever stand upon the word of God the devil cannot move you Hallelujah isn't that right isn't that right and when we're standing on the word of God though the enemy come like a flood we have a promise we have a promise of the spirit of God raising a standard upon that same word hallelujah hallelujah and if we stay with the word God will show us a continuation of that word oh holl isn't that right isn't that right they did miracles in the book of Acts they heal the sick in the book of Acts they raised the dead in the book of Acts but the book of Acts is not finished yet it is an unfinished book this morning the book of Acts is waiting on a group of people a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people a treasure like unto Jacob's people oh hallelujah hallelujah never was there a people like this people never was there age like this age oh hallelujah hallelujah somebody say [Music] amen hallelujah is not [Music] right Spirit has power in it the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life and if whatever you get in the spirit Hallelujah Hall then the word begins to go into action then the word that might be laying dead in the pages of the Bible but when the spirit come upon it it breathe life into it it begins to move it begins to live something come on now it begins to forgive it begins to repent it begins to drop its Arts it begins to drop everything because it is getting lighter oh the at the atoms of this world cannot affect you when you are in the spirit you begin to get lighter you begin to shake off the flesh shake off the tiredness shake off the [Applause] slackness Hallelujah isn't that right so we are in a battle this morning we are fighting a real Warfare and we are fighting a real eny enemy the spirit world is just as real as the world that you are sitting in as the Pew that you are sitting on the devil is just as real he is waiting outside the door this morning to see if you really want to be a Christian to see if you really want to overcome to see if you really praise God are going to stand for this word but there is a people in the land who will take their stand in their time and in their season hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen so I'm just prefacing message of this our lives here on Earth are subject to the spirit realm just as much as we are subject to the natural isn't that right Hallelujah and we can't see it but it is all around us amen and we are actually being influenced this morning right now by another spirit that is here with us another spirit that has given us the ability to hear from God to commune with God to have the the right nature to have the right motive and objective it take God to do that this world is so satanic this world is so evil and and and and and and and wasted that it's almost impossible for a human being to be saved in this hour Hallelujah but the Lord the Bible says they that call upon the Lord in that hour they shall be saved they shall be delivered they shall be restored there's a promise for you this morning that my people if they were called by my name if they begin to Humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then ye will hear from Heaven oh how many want to hear from Heaven this morning hallelujah praise God Amen so it's his spirit that has been here with us all the time it's a spirit that's been keeping you you couldn't keep yourself but another spirit was with you just like it was with Caleb though the odds were against you even though you saw no way out with your naturalized but God put a thirst in your heart to want God and to want his promises and to want his word in your life oh hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah isn't that right so we're here to fight to get into the spirit Hal in the spirit God could speak to us God could manifest his love to us hallelujah isn't that right Hallelujah and I love how the Bible declares that we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear so Paul is saying upfront he is actually telling us the spirit that we're not supposed to have he letting you know bondage and fear is not your promise bondage and fear is not your portion bondage and fear does not belong to you Hallelujah there are some text you just don't read There are some emails you just don't open and anytime you see a email with bondage and fair on it don't press the button just delete it get it out of your inbox you don't need that in your life that is not your promise this morning oh say Amen somebody isn't that right Devil's sending you stuff as if that is yours to keep devil sending you stuff and flooding your inbox over 2,000 emails with all kind of nonsense forget about it wipe the Slate clean let's start over this morning oh Hallelujah be strong and have a good courage oh hallelujah hallelujah have not I commissioned me oh go up at once and take the land that I have given to you it's a land flowing with milk and honey it's a land flowing with promises it's a land flowing with Holy Ghost it's a land flowing with the adoption oh Hallelujah God said my people shall eat and be satisfied they shall eat in plenty and praise the name of their God and my people shall never be ashamed oh I'm not ashamed to worship my God I'm not ashamed to praise him I'm not ashamed oh Hallelujah don't you be afraid young people anytime the devil gets a hold of you you just scream out the name Jesus and watch the sky crack open Watch God dispatch angels to fight for you oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah do you know who you are you are royal Seed of Abraham you are not anybody you are somebody this morning that God is able to use hallelujah oh I feel the anointing I

themselves begin to stoop real low let your pants legs be bagged at the knee do some neology and you begin to seek the face of God there be some glorious tale he'll take you over to the side and give

whole nation hallelujah amen and it's going in now okay so I love it up front we letting the devil know we are not of this we are not of bondage we are not of the world we are not of corruption you are not meant to live in fear but you are meant to live in fate you are not a chicken you are an eagle I don't care how much times I have to say it I'm gonna say it until you believe it you are not of this world we are not from this world we come from God and we go back to God you are created Hallelujah to so into the heavenlies to so into the deeper things in Christ to fly into the eye of the storm fearless and Reckless nothing can stop us oh hallelujah [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah God's intention is not for us to live in fear fear hinders faith faith can't move when fair is present oh Hallelujah isn't that right but if you could kick Fair aside tell fair to shut up and sit in a corner he been talking long enough he had his pce to say it's time to shut up on a Sunday morning Sunday morning is God's day this is the Lord's day this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in eyes this is the day that the Lord has made for once in your life have some fith this morning one day a week have some Faith this morning and see God move in your situation do something for God and he'll do something for you oh hallelujah praise [Applause] God hallelujah isn't that right we have not received the spirit of bondage against a fear that is not our portion amen isn't that right Bible says we're born in sin shap in iniquity comeing the world speaking lies but the law of Christ Jesus is here this morning to set us free from the law of sin and death isn't that right and in the previous scripture of Romans Romans chapter 7 some of yall know it that Paul speaks of the struggle that he faces with himself isn't that right Romans 7:2 21 he says I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man we light in the law of God we love to hear his word isn't that right but here's Paul an apostle here's he speaking here 23 says but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind Waring against the law that I know to do right isn't that right and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members so there's a war going on this morning young people you in a battle sign your shes up polish your Spears and beat your plow sheds into swords we are under attack Hallelujah man the barricades every man to his post we are under attack this morning the enemy is coming like a flood but the spirit of God is here the spirit of God the Lord himself has descended with a shout to make a way for the elect sake hallelujah praise God those days shall be shortened God's going to have one quick message short quick message to shake the whole nation and then we're out of here oh hallelujah hallelujah amen a spirit a nature in you fighting against the law of God that's what's going on that's why it's so hard to lift your hand sometimes that's why it's so hard to praise God sometimes especially when the emotions kick in especially when your mind begins to over click clicking so fast till it can't even function anymore just Frozen have to control all the lead sometimes I don't know if you understand what I'm talking about but times you have to just shut down and get away with God or you'll be overcome even the prophet himself and brother ISAC spoke about it a couple of times he said he himself when he was tested with his wife and he was tested with his child he himself his mind broke down to the point that he picked the gun up and pointed it to his head he pulled the trigger it wouldn't go off God would not allow it and sometimes you would do wrong and it wouldn't go off because God wouldn't allow it because there's something inside of you that just won't let go oh and God will not let you go Mercy said no oh hallelujah oh you are too precious Jesus left his home in glory and came down the Earth the creator of the universe bowed himself low enough to become a vagrant he was sleeping on the streets he had no house to dwell in but it gave him the ability watch to meet the needs of every person that he came into contact with that is how God needed humility he needed to become so low till he could touch the lowest person if he was too high he could only touch the high and mighty but God forsook everything to come and be with you how happy we ought to be this morning we ought to be screaming we ought to be jumping just to know him oh do you know my savior do you know my redeemer oh he's the humble one he's the lonely one oh [Applause] my was God veiled in Simplicity he hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same isn't that right Hallelujah and science know how to how to build the fastest plane they have self-driven cars they have technology and science and knowledge and so forth hallu but they don't know the Mystery of Life in a single blade of grass they miss that and yet God is hidden in that simple thing they cannot make it grow they cannot force it to grow and say now it's time to grow you have to grow no there's a law in the life of that plate of grass he knows that when his time is come he knows that when winter is over that when the dry seasons are over it's his time to shine and when is your hour come your hour come H and when it's your time to shine you will shine forth with the Praises of his glory not the works of any man lest any man should boast it is not by The Works of man man but it is by the grace of God that you made it in this service this morning because there's a law of life in Christ Jesus isn't that right Hallelujah there's a law of life in you there's a seed in you that God had predestinated to be there before the foundation of the world if it were not there you couldn't hear this message this morning with faith you couldn't respond to it you'd be cut off from it because you couldn't come to any kind of fullness or realization of truth but that seed inside of you is really what connects to the gospel is what connects to the word when preach and when we speak your name something inside of you has to respond because it is your name being spoken and only you could respond to your name when it is spoken oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right it's a natural reaction if you hear your name even if somebody have a name like your name and they call that person you can't help but look around just to make sure that it's not you they calling well that's how your spiritual name is a response when God's word is preached when you hear something about the Holy Ghost when you hear something about Deliverance when you hear something about about the spirit of adoption you can't help but look across just make sure that it's you they calling Hallelujah God's got something for you this morning respond [Music] quickly oh mighty mighty is our God Mighty Is Our [Applause] Savior Lazarus was dead 4 days when Mary said even now Lord even now hallelujah hallelujah something could happen something could take place a little spark of faith when Jesus heard those words all the time it was a natural conversation but when she said those words something triggered inside Jesus's system something triggered inside Jesus Oh Hallelujah he said I am the resurrection and the life wait wait what are you talking about there I hear some fate going off I have to respond to that I see some fire sparking off in your heart this morning that's not normal the devil didn't put that there and the devil cannot take it away praise God that's God's fi inside of you responding to the word of God oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah and the law of life in Christ Jesus defy the law of death that was already set in motion upon lazarus's body he was rotting he was decomposing his body was breaking down into bones H but when the law of life was activated in Christ Jesus by a faith word hallelujah he said where have you laid him he said show me where you laid him and I'll show you something new show me where you laid him roll away the stone hallelujah hallelujah he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live are you dead in here this morning though he were dead yet shall he live I know you haven't felt the spirit in a long time but though you were dead yet shall you live hallelujah praise God oh somebody give God a shout of praise praise him praise Him life is here this [Applause] morning amen oh my you feel a presence here right the anointing right the anointing keep right in it keep right in it we don't have to go home where you got to go my God the holy spirit is here this is the Lord's Day praise God I want to be so wrapped up in the spirit till I don't even know my own name all I know is I'm baptized with fire I want to know Fire come in my heart Fire come in my bones fire quickening me oh Hallelujah this Immortal putting on immortality amen that's what I want amen [Music] hallelujah oh my the tone of the world is changing tone of the kings of the world and the rulers are changing Hallelujah they're speaking different they're defending things that are not even written in the Bible matter of fact it's contrary to the Bible contrary living defending same-sex marriage I've seen it on the TV amen amen families and defending it and saying there's nothing wrong with that you could love who you want to love and that's so satanic and God will judge it and burn it with fire nothing's going to stop it the arrow has already been released it's just waiting to drop on Sodom and recate throughout the world and let the world know I am God and I change not just like I judge Sodom and judge the days of Noah I'll judge this earth once more and consume it with fire be zealous therefore and repent and seek the face of God while there is still time while the ark door is still open this morning young people run into the ark while there is still time run to Heaven shake the [Applause] gates Psalms 123 Glory the god judgment is fixing a strike you think Trinidad will escape there will be no safe place there'll be nowhere to run the Bible said the islands fled away judgment begins in the house of God it is starting right now it will not stop like a woman in travail it will get worse the pains will worsen she will scream birth pains but you've got to bring forth crime in this hour and in this [Applause] season my [Music] God Psalms 123 1 144 and this came to me by the will of the Lord is a plea for the mercy of God through the psalm David isn't that right and through this Psalm David are asking for God's mercy upon the people his prophecy every Psalm is prophecy isn't that right going out just like he prophesied the death of Christ saying why God why God why is that forsaken me it was hidden written in Mystery in a Psalm but when Jesus lay on the cross there was the Fulfillment of that Psalm isn't that right I will not see that Holy One to see corruption when he was Rose three days from the dead that pm came to life and there are certain words concerning us this morning that must come to life shortly thereafter the holy spirit is here this morning to make sure that that happens am isn't that right if not you then who if not now then when if not here then where brother sister now we the sons of God it do not appear what we shall be but ready we see him we have a promise we shall be like him amen is that right that's what the devil is trying to keep you away from but chop him out of your way this morning and stay in the atmosphere okay Psalm 123 it says a plea for Mercy isn't that right he's asking for God's mercy why because a spirit has fallen upon the people hallelujah isn't that right let's read it again Psalms 123 let me see if I can find it quick read it again I know it's not a familiar Psalm so we'll refresh it to your memory once more says behold as the eyes of the servants look unto the hands of their masters try and picture that scene the eyes of a servant looking unto her master for bread for meat for a meal for help isn't that right he said now as the eyes of a maiden look into the hand of her mistress so our eyes wait upon the Lord Our God until that he have mercy upon us have mercy upon us oh Lord have mercy upon us for we are exceedingly filled with contempt it's like a it's like a bucket running over hallu isn't that right exceedingly filled with contempt hallelujah our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease ease and Zion and because they're so secure in themselves they look down on others that's right because they're so secure in the church and in their group and in the organization hallelujah hallelujah they feel that they have the self-righteousness to be able to look down on others and they fail to see the approach to God they fail to see how they ought to be approaching God in this hour and season with humility and with reverence and with respect and with Godly fear that is almost absent in this loudan age that we are living in they are blind wretched miserable poor naked I don't even know it and coming to church with a nice dress with a long tie thinking they going into heaven and they have one foot in hell and the next foot in a banana peel there's almost no hope for them it's a sad situation I don't mean to make jokes but it's a terrible situation to be in that atmosphere because it's a deception and the devil actually deceived people mind into thinking that they're doing all right just keep going the way you're going just keep going to church and they're on their way to hell right they're passing all all the stop lights and all that how God tried to keep them from going into danger because God would that no one would be lost God wants to save God died for the whole world he would that everyone be saved Hallelujah but only the elect sake for the elect's sake God Will Make A Way for the elect sake the gospel we preach only for the elect sake the world once more will hear direct from [Applause] [Music] God so we better worship God this morning with all that was it was within us hallelujah because it is only the elect that are going to make it out it is only God's elect that are going to make it out alive of this hell hole that we call Earth that we call living God's about to judge it but God has a people in the land land at this time at this season and he will not leave one behind everyone that calth upon the name of the Lord shall be delivered shall be saved oh is that right he said how can I forget Israel they are engraved in the very palm of my hands every time I look at my hands I remember my my people I remember my lovely ones I remember my predestinated once and every time you go to praying you go to calling upon God God has to answer God has to respond to the Cry of his own children but there has to be a cry there has to be a cry there has to be a cry if a baby don't cry you won't know that it is hungry right [Applause] the fact that it's is crying me there is something wrong check the head check the check the joint check the back check their mouth check them but something is wrong they don't just cry just like that H is that right and you know how God knows when something is wrong with his children when you really have a need there when you really want God you begin to cry and God hears that cry and how can a mother forget her sucking child she must tend to that need and if you have a need this morning God cannot forget you if you have a need this morning if you begin to cry and go to calling out on God oh you watch God do something for you see if God don't deliver you see if God don't set you free see if God don't make a way for you that's only the devil lying to you telling you you can't make it telling you you can't overcome forget the devil this is between you and your father in Heaven he said ask anything in my name and it shall be given Satan is Mountain be moved and don't you have a doubt in your heart you will have whatever you ask for this morning begin to ask for what you want ask for your children ask for your loved ones ask for the Holy Ghost ask for the baptism of fire ask for those seven Thunder virtues to live in [Applause] you we have not cuz we ask not some people are content to come to church to go back home and to be the same over and over and over and over and over and over slowly slipping into madness madness is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result expect God to bless you in that thing that you're doing there Prophet once caught himself doing our death walk isn't that right you come wrong meet the same tree come around and he meet the same Rock come around and he meet the same Stone same piece of dirt that he passed how much ever minutes ago till he realized that he was lost and he needed a guide he realized that he couldn't do it on his own am and the funny part is he was a trained guide he was a trained professional said he know he could feel the side of the tree and whichever part the Moss was growing I think is the North side or whatever he knew all these things and yet he got lost God permitted that to show him that there's no higher than God there's no one above God straight is a gate and narrow is the way few there be that find it woo it take a guide to show you that gate a Straight Gate is a very small gate you'll miss it if you wasn't looking so many people speeding down the highway of life it's like a six Lane seven Lane highway to change lanes is a problem because there's so much people going in the same direction Bumper to Bumper heading to hell it take God to get you out of that traffic of Madness take God to weave you out of that Pitfall that rat race that is the world today take God to take you over to the s somewhere I show you a narrow road highways leading to hell highways leading to satanic destruction and all different types of things isn't that right Mayhem chaos confusion but there's a narrow way this morning and if it wasn't for Jesus who had not been on our side we would have been swallowed whole but the Lord had been with us the angel of the Lord encamp it round up about them that fear them them that fear Him and deliver them oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is a man that trusteth in him where is your trust this morning David said I can't put my trust in the legs of a man I can't put my trust in horses my trust is in the Lord my God he is my shield he is my buckler he is my exceeding and great reward W oh [Applause] Hallelujah there's a way out this morning it's only one way few there be that find it but it is Jesus he is the way out there's only one provided way and that's God's provided way Hallelujah and that's true Jesus Christ his Spirit has to Bear witness with your spirit that you are the Son of God that you are a daughter of God that you are who you say you are is not good enough just to come to church and to play Christian and go home the devil watching that life because a bunch of other people said they were doing that too and they in hell right now so what's difference between you and them you've got to have a token to prove it plenty people went to church lots of people went to church had fine churches nice devil not looking at that devil looking at her life once he see that life thundering out in sweetness and humility thundering out in this age that's what he's got a problem with he got no problem with you coming to church show people come to church people pay their tithes people do nice things hallelujah hallelujah but that's not the way H that's just only part of it that's just only the things that make it up H but the nucleus of the thing is Christ the nucleus of what we are going after is Jesus that's the thing that's the center of it all Jesus and he Remains the Same throughout all the ages Hallelujah times have changed seasons have changed technology has rapidly become better and better it's such a wonderful example existance now people just press their phone and get what they want go into the bank and take out something if they want to and everything just works you don't know how you just living and technology is making it so easy now isn't that right and and yet in all of this rapid change of time God Remains the Same his word Remains the Same his promises remain the same and his laws remain the same he said and if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you you shall find me when you seek me with all of your heart and turn away the distractions and turn away what people say and what people do forget about it run into the Ark of Safety while there is still time something else nice people who went to church but look at Israel Israel was called out two and a half million people called out wonderful dancing and shouting praising God and little did they know that later down the road they'd all die because they failed to meet God's requirement they failed to come God's way they failed to take the land that God had sworn unto their fathers that they would possess they failed to see it and God judged them right there eternally separated from God cut off isn't that right even the Pharisees and the Sadducees telling Jesus that our fathers eat Mana in the wilderness he said but there are everyone dead Hallelujah God don't care how much Mana you eat God want to see how much word you live go don't care how much Mana you eat they ate angel food I've never tasted angel food and yet they all perish for the lack of faith that's right isn't that right don't be in that condition friends we have a chance all these things happen Paul said for all restruction and Repro that we could learn from it that we could grow from it that we could not do as they did but that we could learn from those experiences and that we could strong in the knowledge of God and Chase the thing that we were born to go after isn't that right okay Hallelujah Psalms 123 the Amplified says be gracious to us oh Lord be gracious and favorable towards us for we are greatly filled with contempt our soul is greatly filled with the scuffing of those who are at ease and with the contempt of The Proud who disregard God's law it's an extension of translation isn't that right my and the word contempt means willful Disobedience or open disrespect that's what contempt means amen isn't that right Hallelujah and that word of the Lord shows the attitude of the people today isn't that right a willful disobedience are open disrespect to God's law isn't that right come to church how they want come to church when they want do what they want no prayer no sanctification no dedication no hungering for God a thirsting to come to the to the realization of the truth to to want to be a manifestation to want to see God live in their lives and to see God do something real in your heart for you to be a real Christian to do the things that you were supposed to do isn't that right to present yourself a Living Sacrifice unto God holy and acceptable that is your reasonable service that's ABCs that's Basics you're supposed to do that and yet there's a a willful Disobedience today isn't that right my God see 2 and a half million people were disobedient to God's law and we're judged for it isn't that right okay uh let me read something here from the prophet how can I overcome from paragraph 41 he says I was crossing an Old Log the other day down a wash or what is called a hollow okay and I jumped up on this log on the outside it looked good it looked like a big old beach log so he's in the woods I guess and he he jumps on top of this log I guess he's testing the strength of it or the weight of it and he said it look good it looked like a big old beach log he said but when I jumped up on it oh a great chunk of it fell off he said it was real rotten and dty I said that's the way the Christians are becoming he said they've been dead in sin and trespass so long till become Dy they can they can hold no weight at all they don't know what the overcoming means he said I begin to think of this text then see overcome what does it mean overcome means to keep life in you he said when when life went out that's what brought the log to that condition see and it made it worse than ever when it laid in the branch where the water was he's saying something here now listen close he says and then there you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian but he said let the life of God go from him and the experience the joy of serving Christ and live and and living in a church where where such is going on he says he rottens twice as quick living right under right in that condition isn't that right people com to church and they're dying people come in church and doing the same things over and over and they're slowly dying in the Pew isn't that right when you're supposed to be applying the word but the life of God is gone out of you there's no testimony anymore there's no vibration anymore there's no cry to get in the spirit a passion to know the word a fervent desire to please God all of that is is almost void and absent in the life of the so-called Christian and then it begin to wither and rotten and cave in on itself that's a condition he say that Christians are coming into today this is the prophet here he said so if we are trying to follow the message of the hour or at least part of this message he said we should live constantly in the Life of Christ see cuz if you don't you lay around and you know that these things that you're supposed to do and you don't do it the the Bible say he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it sin then you become Doty rotten when you're separated from the life of God here's a prophet encouraging you he says so strive with all that is in you to stay in the Life of Christ that you be fruit bearing he said back then the early ages a Christian could uh for his profession of in a church or belonging to Christ he said he could be beheaded for it he could be killed he could be put out of his misery and go to meet God quickly but now he said the enemy has come in the game has change he said the enemy has come in the name of the church and it's so deceiving this is the great age of deception he said when when Christ said that the two Spirits would be so close in the last days till it would deceive the very elect if it was possible see see see the prophet says see three times he said remember Christ spoke of an elected people for the last day that's you and I an elected people for the last day he said see it would deceive the very elected if it were possible so close he said that people could live uh so live people can live a clean holy life not be sinful adulterers and Drinkers and liars and gamblers they can live above that and still not with it that's right that's right he said and this is the age I love this this this phrase here the prophet says he said this is the age the age of Life personal life of Christ where the chemical of his body what was in him first under justification the water baptism second under the new birth of Wesley uh sanctification which cleanses and thirdly under the baptism of the Holy Spirit putting that Sanctified vessel into service see he said the word sanctify means it's a compound Greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service and the Holy Spirit puts it in service oh Hallelujah isn't that right so we don't just want to be set aside for service but we want to be put in service and it takes a holy spirit to do that it takes a spirit of God to do that an anointing to come upon you to live this life of Christ to act the Life of Christ to do the works of Christ it takes another Spirit to do that but you have to be emptied out and to let God come in so that he could perform his Works in you isn't that right oh wonderful can we give the Lord a praise [Applause] offering oh Hallelujah they love the Lord this morning amen I don't want to keep too long but just a few more minutes and I'll close out he said so with promise the Holy Spirit not the spirit of contempt but the spirit of sin the uh not the spirit of sin sorry not the spirit of contemp not the spirit of sin but the spirit of adoption see isn't that right now we know what adoption is isn't that right it's the placing of sons into the family of God by adoption isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah and what we are speaking of this morning is the spirit of adoption now the word of God for each age listen to this it releases an anointing that comes upon the people of that day to fulfill the word of that day isn't that right it's an anointing it's a special anointing that is supposed to come upon the Bride of this hour to help her fulfill the word for this day isn't that right to anoint what does anoint mean anoint means to set someone apart or to authorize and equip someone or him or her for a task of spiritual importance Hallelujah and there's something important that we are supposed to do and you cannot do that in your human Spirit you cannot do that in your carnal mind you have to put away your caral mind that's enity towards God but you have to put on a spiritual mind an anointing a presence has to come upon you to help you to live this thing to help you to do this thing isn't that right seven Thunders are not going to live in your human Spirit your human Spirit can't do that that it's possible to have human virtues but they won't be God's virtues and it won't be God's requirement it has to be God's virtues God's spirit meeting God's Own requirement and then when God sees that life he caps it off with charity is Charity isn't that right that's our promise an anointing isn't that right David David was anointed king by God through the prophet Samuel isn't that right and God released his anointing upon David isn't that right the Bible says so as soon as the porn of oil was poured upon David the spirit of God rested upon David from that time onward and a evil spirit took a hole upon Saul isn't that right Hallelujah Saul was was anointed all the time but when the season changed the spirit changed when the season changed the spirit made its identification with David a man after God's Own Heart God's true man for the hour isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right and David is a ruddy old fell Ruddy little fell and back there feeding the Sheep taking care of the Lambs and and nobody pays him any mind and any attention he's just a little fella nobody listens to him he's just out there you could tell by the way Jesse speaks about him that he's just in the back there you know doing his thing and he's obedient little you know I've got my other sons in the front line and they're training for the Army but David is just a little last one of them little last boy amen and he's just there feeding the Sheep but there was something special about David isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right and here comes Samuel come down with a horn of oil and God has commissioned him to go down there and to anoint one of the sons of Jesse he doesn't know which one it is he just going down there to fulfill God's commission he going down there to do what God told him to do and here he come with a horn of oil and said Jesse I come to make sacrifice and Jesse begin to he said bring him his sons and so forth and you know what happened and he brought the first son and there was no witness go God says not this one God said not that one Samuel ready to pour and God said not this one I'll tell you who it is you keep looking you keep searching and God has been looking God has been searching for somebody to anoint he have the Horn of oil this morning it's filled to the brim with all of the blessings of God and he looking to anoint and commission somebody this morning oh who's it going to be who's it going to be God is looking for a witness this morning says send for David there's a little boy in the back there he's feeding some sheep say go send for him we're not going to sit until he come then he come humble nothing much about him had his little rod in his hand he just rest his hop down on the Rock come down from off the hill and as soon as he walked in God said this is the one and Samuel run up to him and pour the horn oil Horn of oil upon him he emptied it out emptied it out if a brother wanted some oil he couldn't get none he had to go and lick it off of David because David had all the anointing God don't feel a how to bless his children God don't feel no how when he ready to bless you he going to pour it out he going to empty it out upon his sons and daughters oh all that was in God he pours into Christ and all that was in Christ he will pour into his church oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right it's a special anointing look even the Saints of old who died those Martyrs who died who died in for the name of the Gospel of Jesus Christ they were killed in amphitheaters out in the open Lions RI them away and eat their flesh that was death they were going to but a spirit Came Upon them we know now that it's an ox anointing an anointing that come upon them to give them the ability to give their lives to the gospel Steven lifted up his eyes and said unto thee I commit my spirit and he gave his life for the gospel after preaching the truth of God they were cut to the heart after preaching the word of God to them he said you stiff neck and uncircumcised a heart you always did resist the Holy Ghost and he died after his speech isn't that right Hallelujah it was anointing upon them Hallelujah hallah to suffer many things for Christ's sake Jesus said if I suffered you think you're going to escape no no no if the world hate me they will hate you also the world hate me before I even came and they will hate me long after I'm gone on but you are going to see me and because I live you shall live also oh and they were not afraid they marched into the lion's den they went willfully to be burned they gave their bodies they were sown aunder they were slain with a two-edged sword they wandered in sheep skins and goat skins they were destitute they were Afflicted they were [Applause] tormented and they were happy to give their lives for the gospel what are you doing this morning what have you what sacrifice have you made when people were slaughtered people were killed women lost their children people were cut up blood spilled innocent blood men women children it didn't matter to the Roman Empire they killed mercilessly by the thousands freely given their lives for the Gospel of Jesus Christ what are we doing this morning this message is dripping with blood this gospel is dripping with blood what burden what sacrifice what are you doing more than what you are doing now to measure up to the gospel of Christ in this hour consider yourselves oh man your days are numbered consider your ways consider what you're doing consider your approach to God it's very important the approach to God if you get anything out of the service this morning remember this your approach to God has to be a certain way Aaron couldn't go into the temple lazy and halfhazard in a Trinidad Behavior no he would have been struck dead didn't care if he was a priest it wouldn't matter if he who he was he came in there any old how he would have been struck dead because he would have come out of God's law out of God's program and out of God's atmosphere he had to be Anointed with the oil he had to have the Bells on his on his clothes riging holy holy unto the Lord it was God he was going to meet he wasn't going to the shop it wasn't some closeup Club it was the house of God and this is the house of God where the word is being preached to you what is your approach to [Applause] God what makes this place different between here and and maybe your workplace or your social club is a presence of Mighty God hallelujah that is here trying to commune with you to get you back on the straight and narrow the Holy Spirit looking at your behavior seeing you fall out of line oh it's so good to hear the gospel of Christ where we could hear that voice scream out to us get back in line get back in Step get back in God's program get back in God's movement get back in God's behavior and attitude get back in the right kind of motive the right kind of objective stop comeing to church and come to god stop coming to a building and come to the presence of almighty God stop being ritualistic and start being real stop being ordinary and start being spiritual and the world has this weird kind of thing about you know you got to be a certain age to be spiritual listen young people don't let anybody put that on you Jesus was 12 years old when he in the temple preaching the word of God isn't that right I don't think Samuel belly had a mustache when he heard God uh speaking to him Li here said I have something to speak to my people that'll make Israel ears tingle you're not too young to serve God you're not too young to hear from God you're not too young to live for God do it now while there is still time do it now while there's still an opportunity do it now before the door is shut amen just saying oh my wow I've gone way over my time let me try to close out here adoption isn't that right this is the age of adoption isn't that right and adoption is a hard process it's almost scary when you think about what God would do to a man to test him to the point of almost to the brink of of of of total Destruction when you look at job's condition boils break out upon him though he slay me yet I trust him it takes God to do that it takes a spirit to be endowed upon you and to be endued upon you to go through that what's about to come upon the Earth the prophet said a bride will be a haunted persecuted group before she goes out to meet him Yonder H isn't that right there has to be a Spirit come upon you to go through that terrible time that is about to break upon the Earth nations are breaking Israel awaken signs of the Prophet for told there's a terrible time coming but we've got to have the spirit to lead us into the Wilderness to be tested to be tried there may not be any church services in that Wilderness there may not be any encouragement there in that Wilderness of scorpions and snakes but you've got to have that spirit with you just like it was with Caleb that said now therefore give me this mountain he stood for 40 years in a hot Dusty desert with death all around him but another Spirit was with him isn't that right oh my so adoption process very hard it's terrible there's pain torture there's there there's there's mind battles isn't that right scorpions and snakes it's not a picnic it's not a walk in the par P Prophet Tau by experience let me read it here from adoption he says yep sure do said the Holy Spirit I give him test boy I tried him this way I tried him that way I throw him down Sick I put him under I stomped him I let the devil do everything to him he could and he come right back up again oh don't that sound like the bride this morning he come right back up again he come up the same he come up again here's the holy spirit said I made him sick I done this I threw him in the hospital I took him out here I done this I done that I've done this I've done that I turned his wife against him I turned his neighbors against him I turned everything that didn't make a bit of difference he said though he slay me yet I trust him I kill his family it continues yeah I took this I did this I done all of this I did this that the other this that the other he stood right up though he slay me yet I'll serve him he's mine oh Hallelujah can you take the word oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's not the devil doing that you know that's God permitting those things job God had a conversation about Job long before job had started having all these bad times and S sad times they having a conversation and God put put job to the test H boils SWS this and that he lost cattle he lost wife he um he lost his his possessions and so on his wife lost everything he lost everything isn't that right Hallelujah his wife said why you Cur go and die and he said no you speak like a foolish woman in the midst of those test God was still leaking out of job in the midst of that sorrow in the midst of that state God was oozing out of job he said though he slay me yet I trust him I serve him with all my heart and though the skin worms destroyed his body I look like I'm dying I look like I'm not going to make it I look like not many days hence but yet still I'm holding on to God hallelujah hallelujah I don't care if the world falls apart I don't care if I can hear from God the devil cannot move me musician could come and get her in the clothes the holy spirit said oh I believe we ought to call him out somewhere to a little special place and have an adoption an adoption ceremony he said now when the father in the Old Testament understood that his son was come of age and had been uh seasoned out onto adoption unto uh he said they borned a child but when they a son right then but then they they they'll never be no more than just a child see just an ordinary son until they mature and show what they are then he calls him out then now here we are church he said are you ready he said now it's a little bit late everybody got to bite your finger pinch your soul pluck your heart just for a minute he said you see now we're going to place the church he said now when the church gets to that place he says Manasses belong over here Ephraim you over there then he takes them out to a certain place isn't that right the father does and he sets him up on a high place like this and he has a ceremony and they all come around and he said I want everyone to know that this is my child and I adopt my son I want anyone to know from hence forth that his name I dress him up in a special dress on him I want you to know that his name is just as good on any check as my name is amen who he hires is hired amen hallelujah I adopt him into my family although he's been my son since he was born Hallelujah isn't that right and you've been a Christian since you come out isn't that right but he said since he received the Holy Ghost he's been my son see but now I'm going to place him positionally now in Authority what he fires is fired and what he hires is hired verily verily if I say unto you if I say to you to this tree to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said see there you are there you are see he's my son how many knows that that's the adoption isn't that right that they adopted the son after he proved to be the right kind of son isn't that right everybody ever read the Bible it's a placing of a Sons isn't that right I'm we to close you can play something softly he said now God did the same thing to his son when he took Jesus up on the mount Transfiguration he took Peter James and John up there he said that three Witnesses of the earth he said there was Jesus Moses and Elijah God upon that mountain they they stood up there on that mountain he said the first thing you know they looked and Jesus was glorified before them is that right how many knows that's the scripture what' he do he dressed him in a robe of immortality he said and his Ramen shine like the sun is that right and a cloud overshadowed him him and Peter and John and them fell on their face and they looked and there stood Moses and Elijah talking to him Moses had been dead and buried in an on Mark grade for 800 years Elijah took a chariot ride to Heaven 500 years before that but there they were still there there was he was talking to him see he had taken Jesus up to see them to see what it was all about see showing him things and they talked with him and they had a conversation then stood Peter looking back again and the glorification was off Jesus they seen Jesus and then only a voice come from the cloud and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him his name's just as good as mine now that's right hear ye him that's it adopted or plac Sons isn't that right I end this quote here the prophet says if you place your face in God's word and your eyes towards heaven and let your pants legs be bagged at the knees you understand be reverent before God there'll be someday that God will take you over to the side one way and give to you a power and a gift and that the whole world world will know that he has been with you oh hallelujah hallelujah do you believe it this morning that Spirit itself will bear witness with your spirit that you are the sons of God in other words only God can identify who you are and it takes God to show you who you are isn't that right Hallelujah if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you I'm finished may the Lord richly bless you this morning oh Hallelujah you just begin to worship him this morning you begin to praise him you begin to talk to him this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah yes Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah you just begin to raise your hands now just begin to talk to him you just begin to worship him this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh
