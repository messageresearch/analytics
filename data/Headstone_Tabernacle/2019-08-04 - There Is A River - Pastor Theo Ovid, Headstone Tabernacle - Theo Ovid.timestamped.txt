[1:07:53] just want to bring a few things back
[1:07:55] from the permiten that we had on friday
[1:07:59] with a powerful atmosphere and you who
[1:08:03] are praying you are who is holding up
[1:08:05] the church holding up this inspiration
[1:08:07] the one that are praying I'm sweating it
[1:08:10] out and so my god and the script reread
[1:08:14] was some second Kingstree 15 to 17 where
[1:08:18] Elijah was upset and the Oxford minstrel
[1:08:22] at the play and the minister I believe
[1:08:24] in the hand of the Lord came upon him
[1:08:26] and the spirit the music was able to
[1:08:31] bring him in an atmosphere so it's not
[1:08:33] just playing but the right kind of a
[1:08:35] plan in and that would bring atmosphere
[1:08:38] upon the Prophet or let's say this we
[1:08:41] bring it in the spirit so we appreciate
[1:08:43] by the Stephen this morning without song
[1:08:44] service right kind of singing atmosphere

[1:09:31] repent of my sins I'll be the first one
[1:09:34] that God sanctifies and takes all the
[1:09:37] world out of me Lord I'm a shame on my
[1:09:39] life I'm a shame of the way I've been
[1:09:41] doing I want you to take it away from me
[1:09:44] give me something so great Lord that I
[1:09:46] don't want to go back to that hog wallow
[1:09:48] again as the Bible said as the soul
[1:09:51] returned to of wallow and the doctors
[1:09:53] from it we can see Lord that many of our
[1:09:55] pinnacles of people are acting the same
[1:09:56] way come out of the world and going
[1:09:58] right back in it again God please let me
[1:10:01] not think Lord I'm trying to call them
[1:10:03] but merely trying to put the scripture
[1:10:05] in front of them that they're enough to
[1:10:07] walk over it Lord and push it aside to
[1:10:09] go any further and I pray the Lord every
[1:10:12] every person and myself all of us will
[1:10:14] take inventory of our lives and compare
[1:10:17] it with God's requirement granted father
[1:10:19] forgive us of our sins forgive us of our
[1:10:22] mistakes and our errors let the blood of
[1:10:25] Jesus sanctify the little church tonight
[1:10:27] or God may every person here get a touch
[1:10:31] of the Holy Spirit right away granted
[1:10:33] father let it come please do
[1:10:36] Lord starter revival right here in this
[1:10:39] city
[1:10:39] granted Lord make this church an example
[1:10:42] an example Church and let the people
[1:10:44] come from different paths and look in
[1:10:46] here and see the way their conduct is
[1:10:48] and hold it shut back from the things of
[1:10:50] the world and back into the real genuine
[1:10:53] Pentecostal path the genuine Pentecostal
[1:10:56] experience walking with you blameless
[1:10:58] granted Lord then other choices we'll
[1:11:00] see under it say well if that brother
[1:11:02] can have his church like that and all
[1:11:04] them people can be together and their
[1:11:06] hearts can be one then they cut the a
[1:11:08] mode for everyone and look how much
[1:11:10] difference there is in them Lord that
[1:11:12] they will hunger and kiss you said you
[1:11:14] are the salt of the earth God bring back
[1:11:16] the sour in the soil quickly or glory to
[1:11:20] God hallelujah praise God at a people
[1:11:22] might walk in the door and see the power
[1:11:25] of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:27] moving on
[1:11:28] people showing himself alive Oh glory to
[1:11:32] God hallelujah I'm almost finished here
[1:11:36] he's saying traveling I think is a great
[1:11:39] thing that I've seen missing in the
[1:11:40] church today one of the greatest
[1:11:43] hindrances in a church today that keep
[1:11:45] the revival back is the lack of godly
[1:11:47] love but Christ expressed when he was
[1:11:49] here on earth it is easy for you to love
[1:11:52] someone that loves us but what Jesus
[1:11:54] didn't have that kind of a love he had
[1:11:56] God's love and God love his enemies for
[1:11:59] God so loved the world when the world
[1:12:01] was unlovable God still loved the world
[1:12:03] Oprah is a different even in the
[1:12:05] expression of the words of filial and on
[1:12:08] a Kapo of divine love and if there's
[1:12:10] anything I believe listen listen
[1:12:12] visitors this look like simple there's
[1:12:14] no more big heart mystery that I just
[1:12:16] scratch ahead if there's anything that I
[1:12:18] believe that would start a revival Los
[1:12:21] Angeles would be a time that we could
[1:12:24] bring them all over different barriers
[1:12:25] and come together as Christians and love
[1:12:28] that's the pentecostal the Baptist the
[1:12:31] Presbyterian and all together we would
[1:12:33] Express to the world that we have love
[1:12:36] one for another and jesus prayed that
[1:12:39] prayer that we might have love one for
[1:12:41] another as he had loved us Oh glory to
[1:12:44] God amen hallelujah glory to God you
[1:12:49] believe that today let me close what I
[1:12:51] said no one could love like him you
[1:12:53] can't manufacture that kind of a love
[1:12:55] it's the gift of God that comes by the
[1:12:58] Holy Spirit the only way you will ever
[1:13:00] be able to have that love do I speak
[1:13:02] with tongues of men and angels I hope
[1:13:04] that kind of love oh my man please God
[1:13:08] oh I love him this morning you say what
[1:13:12] we need tonight is the water of God the
[1:13:15] vision absolutely interpreted God's will
[1:13:18] to a dying Persian people what did he

[1:13:27] fool you blow but I don't mess with them
[1:13:29] senses because if you're looking for

[1:18:05] carried into the midst of the sea though
[1:18:07] the waters thereof roar and be troubled
[1:18:10] but a mountains shake with the swelling
[1:18:13] thereof Silla there is a river the
[1:18:16] streams whereof shall make glad the City
[1:18:18] of God the holy place of the Tabernacles
[1:18:22] of the Most High God is in the midst of

[1:18:58] the core of Jacob is our refuge our last
[1:19:01] capture is from sin John chapter 7
[1:19:04] reading from verse 37 familiar Scripture
[1:19:07] in the last day that great day of the
[1:19:09] feast Jesus stood and cried saying if
[1:19:11] any man thirst let him come unto me and
[1:19:13] drink he that believe on me as the
[1:19:15] scripture hath said out of his belly
[1:19:17] shall flow rivers of living water but
[1:19:19] this spake he of the Spirit which did
[1:19:22] that believe on him should receive for
[1:19:24] the Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[1:19:26] that Jesus was not yet glorified let us
[1:19:28] pray one more time father we have read
[1:19:30] your word and God I need you to come and
[1:19:33] interpret these words to the people this
[1:19:35] morning take me out of the way Lord made

[1:20:21] you how you teach them are you tasty and
[1:20:27] can you swim and where are you planted
[1:20:36] hallelujah it's amazing what you know
[1:20:41] what why there was such a contrast in
[1:20:44] the scripture when he says here in sums
[1:20:48] 46 therefore shall be not fear though
[1:20:52] the earth be removed and though the
[1:20:54] mountains be carried into the midst of
[1:20:57] the sea though the waters roar and be
[1:21:01] troubled though the mountains shake with
[1:21:03] this well it means in the shaking times
[1:21:07] you have to know that there is a river
[1:21:12] that makes glad the City of God
[1:21:15] hallelujah praise God that's not a
[1:21:18] normal River you know that River began

[1:21:41] morning all glory to God amen let's read
[1:21:45] it but I said missing me and I really
[1:21:47] appreciate it when you see a servant of
[1:21:49] God get so sincere till he's on his face
[1:21:52] with his hands in the air
[1:21:54] praying to God and blushing because of
[1:21:56] the iniquity of the people then you're
[1:21:58] going to see a revival start a man
[1:22:01] cannot lay in the presence of God a

[1:27:21] Living God in the hearts of the people
[1:27:23] we don't need so much tips of the spirit
[1:27:27] or spiritual awakened we need a revival

[1:28:40] stand in puerto rico few weeks ago i

[1:28:53] the chain in under jump in what does it
[1:28:55] mean a troll or the trash out upon the
[1:28:57] bank that is what the church needs it is
[1:28:59] a revival not a revival of specialist
[1:29:03] not a resigner singing not a revivalist
[1:29:05] inspiration not that but the revival
[1:29:08] avoids the rush of the church specials

[2:12:25] all right I'm sorry don't you change
[2:12:28] bomb says be what full of strange things
[2:12:30] which we mean that eraser die if I'm not
[2:12:33] from that works perfectly for god I wish
[2:12:35] it could have been said that this
[2:12:37] addition age was the restoration instead
[2:12:40] of Reformation he said um I kind of see
[2:12:44] that the word does not call it
[2:12:46] restoration but certainly caused it
[2:12:48] Reformation had it been restoration the
[2:12:50] age would have been another Pentecost of
[2:12:51] each but it was not the best that could
[2:12:53] be said striking that which remains is
[2:12:56] ready to die there was something missing
[2:12:58] yes certainly was this age was
[2:13:00] justification but it had missed
[2:13:03] sanctification and the baptism already
[2:13:05] goes that is what God's original plan
[2:13:07] was that was what that is what they had
[2:13:10] a Pentagon they were justified they were
[2:13:12] sanctified they were filled with holy
[2:13:14] goes why listen to me the reason for
[2:13:16] being justified and sanctified is to the
[2:13:19] end that she might be baptized with the
[2:13:21] Holy Ghost
[2:13:22] that is the reason there is a church it
[2:13:24] is a temple of God sing with God even
[2:13:26] the Holy Ghost the same spirit I was in
[2:13:28] Jesus while he was on earth causing him
[2:13:30] to do the mighty works which he did back
[2:13:32] in the church at Pentecost so that they
[2:13:34] did the work that he did this aged did
[2:13:36] not have those works they had the
[2:13:38] written word but not the revealed word
[2:13:41] this was the Reformation was going to be
[2:13:44] start of it he was going to according to
[2:13:45] promise take the Tisch back from the
[2:13:47] depths of Satan in the dark ages
[2:13:49] after the depths of God that had a
[2:13:51] Pentecost and which was a few years
[2:13:53] before
[2:13:53] now be careful get this it says in this
[2:13:56] second verse and I read if I have not
[2:13:58] found thy works perfect for God do you
[2:14:00] know what the mean of not perfect
[2:14:01] radiance it is unfulfilled so he put his
[2:14:05] magnifying glass not perfect it means
[2:14:07] unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled
[2:14:10] age it was just started to get him back
[2:14:13] and that is why I said the biota calling
[2:14:15] Reformation not restoration is a static
[2:14:18] in the doctrine of justification with
[2:14:19] men salvation was all of God now Luther
[2:14:22] preaches sovereignty of God and election
[2:14:24] he knew it was all Greece he separated a
[2:14:27] church from the rule by a classical
[2:14:29] Nawrocki he taught on either he cast all
[2:14:31] confessions to the pre
[2:14:32] he's amongst the people was wonderful
[2:14:34] God had 1,500 years before
[2:14:36] luta you're gonna start things your age
[2:14:38] receipt are all unfulfilled I'm leaving
[2:14:41] that talita he knows the end from the
[2:14:45] beginning
[2:14:46] luta was his messenger it didn't look
[2:14:48] like it as we examined the floors so
[2:14:55] luta had flow and if you want to see
[2:14:59] floors you can see plenty with lutein
[2:15:01] and because he with me and everybody
[2:15:03] else do is what you want to look at are
[2:15:07] you i first continued on but it was a
[2:15:09] man called Jonah he had flaws in his
[2:15:11] life too
[2:15:11] he was a prophet door you might not want
[2:15:14] to see sue on the basis of how he acted
[2:15:16] but God knows them that are his and he
[2:15:19] has his way just as David Jonah he had
[2:15:21] his way with Luton that day and he will
[2:15:24] have his way until the consummation or
[2:15:27] Co became the Lord's Grace offering now
[2:15:31] let's look at the next step logically we
[2:15:33] think is the actual foreman and
[2:15:35] harvesting of the green the completed
[2:15:38] cycles but not sue there's another stage
[2:15:40] and that stage is when the husk or chaff
[2:15:43] is formed to cover the seed and that is
[2:15:46] exactly what happened a spiritual cycle
[2:15:48] at the turn of the 20th century in the
[2:15:50] start of the larissa age there was a
[2:15:51] widespread belief that the Holy Ghost
[2:15:53] was fallen exactly as I did at Pentecost
[2:15:55] people were talking in tongues and
[2:15:57] claiming to be baptized it already goes
[2:15:59] with evidence of speaking in tongues but
[2:16:01] I've walked to the grain fields many a
[2:16:02] times and here in summer block the heads
[2:16:04] of wheat rubbed them in my hand they get
[2:16:06] some green and to my surprise there
[2:16:08] wasn't any corner within that chef's
[2:16:10] dough indeed it looked as if weak
[2:16:12] whatever this is a perfect picture of
[2:16:14] this so-called Pentecostal move now here
[2:16:17] we go just want to get to and this is a
[2:16:20] proven fact is found in these people
[2:16:22] organized on a doctrine and bound
[2:16:25] themselves he that is were here people
[2:16:27] go off when they pinned on their
[2:16:29] doctrine and say you have to be fit like
[2:16:31] this I mean nail it down like a thesis I
[2:16:33] hung it up and unless you leave it like
[2:16:36] that you're not brothers Pharisees are
[2:16:40] the things are resisting here it is just
[2:16:42] found boss auditing
[2:16:44] so then he was a he was recognizes as
[2:16:46] far as they concerned and people had a
[2:16:48] busted out from them and he had a whole
[2:16:50] following I went him cumbersome he bust

[2:17:00] when they thought Jesus was the next
[2:17:02] kind of wanted them to start a new
[2:17:04] organization and over to a room unlike

[2:22:29] it's up here the chaff Matthew 24 dizzy
[2:22:35] vanilla if possible
[2:22:37] now here Hobart a Branham tied in this
[2:22:40] cupboard Ezekiel 47 I don't mind this
[2:22:43] chap stage was the danger period that
[2:22:46] Jesus spoke of in Matthew 24:24 this
[2:22:49] evenly vary in like it was possible all
[2:22:51] man felt that this husk the so-called
[2:22:54] Pentecostal it was a true seed but it
[2:22:56] proved to be a carrier to carry the life
[2:22:58] over to the age in which the true
[2:22:59] restoration comes and the wheat bride is
[2:23:05] manifested in the power spoken by
[2:23:07] Ezekiel 47 2 to 5 I know he connects
[2:23:12] that with the script to be ready and
[2:23:15] when the man had that line in his hand
[2:23:18] watch then he brought me out of the way
[2:23:20] of the gate northward led me from the
[2:23:22] way with out unto the utter gate by the
[2:23:24] way that look eastward and behold I ran
[2:23:25] waters on the right side and when the
[2:23:28] man had the line in his hand when fought
[2:23:30] eastward he measured a thousand cubit he
[2:23:32] brought me to the waters the waters were
[2:23:33] uncle's again he measured at Olson under
[2:23:36] water were to the means and he measured
[2:23:37] a thousand brought me to the waters to
[2:23:39] the loins I already measured a thousand
[2:23:41] it was a river that I could not pass
[2:23:43] over for the waters were risen waters to
[2:23:45] swim in a river that I could not pass
[2:23:47] over Oh glory to God he said that's the
[2:23:50] way it was done by God's perfect mill
[2:23:52] and program in the Lutheran had the Holy
[2:23:54] Ghost potentially under justification
[2:23:56] the Methodists had it potentially under
[2:23:58] sonification and today it has brought
[2:24:00] back a restoration the Holy Ghost is
[2:24:02] here so prapannam restore back a person
[2:24:06] of the Holy Ghost water to swim in or
[2:24:10] give the Lord some praises people
[2:24:13] hallelujah almost finished here watch to
[2:24:17] watch contains not only the idea of been
[2:24:20] a week but to be a little the idols
[2:24:23] express is towards watchful and
[2:24:25] strengthen to be the otherwise in sweet
[2:24:28] ensuring continuous Dean's and loss the
[2:24:30] strengthened
[2:24:32] means more than just to give strength it
[2:24:34] means to fix and establish for
[2:24:37] permanency that's deep these two
[2:24:40] commands refer to what is the left of
[2:24:43] the truth which in itself is ready to
[2:24:44] die this expression of the spirit comes
[2:24:48] before me as an illustration a group of
[2:24:51] slaves in total bondage physically and
[2:24:54] morally has risen up and escape their
[2:24:56] captors indeed this is what sadist mean
[2:24:59] the escaped ones they are pursued and
[2:25:02] their great and glorious gains are all
[2:25:04] but lost they have not been retaken but
[2:25:07] about all that they can be said that
[2:25:08] they have escaped not cleanly escaped
[2:25:10] are somewhat according to the world they
[2:25:12] are but they have lost much of their
[2:25:14] liberties now the Lord say you are
[2:25:16] potentially back in captivity see that
[2:25:19] you don't go back to keep from going
[2:25:22] back become alert remain ever watchful
[2:25:27] concerning the things of your captivity
[2:25:29] or you would lose all drinking yourself
[2:25:33] know in what you have left in such a
[2:25:36] manner as to permanently established
[2:25:39] what you have and thus insure against
[2:25:42] future loss in other words you're
[2:25:45] cutting your losses and you remain
[2:25:46] insane this will not be an opportunity
[2:25:53] to fulfill that you have not fulfilled
[2:25:55] but when they they go on no sir they did
[2:25:58] not heed this voice of the Spirit he
[2:26:01] went to another age
[2:26:02] oh my hallelujah Jeremiah 2 to 11 and 13
[2:26:06] God speaking in Jeremiah 2 here saying
[2:26:09] have a nation change their gods which I
[2:26:11] get no gods but my people have changed
