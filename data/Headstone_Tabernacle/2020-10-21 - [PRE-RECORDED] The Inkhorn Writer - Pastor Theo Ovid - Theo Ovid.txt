i'd like you to turn to three portion scriptures tonight isaiah chapter 66 one verse verse eight ezekiel chapter nine we want to read from verse one to six revelation chapter 7 i want to read verse 1 to 4. thanks for coming out tonight it's good to be here amen isaiah 66 8 who had heard such a thing who has seen such a saying shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as zion traveled she brought forth her children ezekiel chapter 9 reading from verse 1. he cried also in my ears with a lord voice saying cause them that have charged over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lie towards the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was cruel with linen with a writer's incorn by his side and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar and the glory of the god of israel had gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the churchill of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writer's incorn by his side and the lord said unto him go to the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in my hearing go ye after him to the city and smite let not your eyes spear neither have utterly old and young boat maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they begin at the ancient men which were before the house our last scripture is from revelation chapter seven you want to read from verse one and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to her the earth and the sea saying hood not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the sevens of god in their foreheads and i heard the number of them which were sealed and they were sealed a hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel may god bless his word you may be seated praise the lord my my my my it's good to be in his presence tonight i have a title the inkhorn writer that's the title i have tonight the incorn writer and an inspiration sealed in or sealed out in a context scripture i'll tell you read that scripture sunday evening first corinthians 12 13 for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body about obama prayed his prayer he said dear lord jesus we are summoned again in your name with great expectation for the outpouring of the quickening power of god to bring us into recognition of our position and place and all responsibilities of being a call people separated from the world dedicated to god grant lord tonight that the blessings of god will guide us and direct us in the things we do and see that it might bring honor and glory to your name so he was under expectation for the outpouring of the quickening power what are you on the expectation for tonight oh hallelujah you have to be under expectation for that quick 10 power from the inside man brother branham you know you would like to know what i think the greatest need of the church today would you like what i think where i think the lacking is is no soul travail the people are not broke up enough listen to those words the people are not broken up enough there is no burden seemingly you give me someone that's so tall about lost souls that they cry and are wanting a revival so bad till they can hardly eat they simply can't they can't continue if you would read the history of the world and religious history you will find out it always take that kind of spirit to bring a revival what kind of spirit brokenness broken spirit broken hearts you're feeling uh uh to pour out you want to repent you want to make things right you want to be reconciled to god you want to humble yourself to the cross you want to lay at christ's feet it takes that kind of spirit to bring a revival not arrogance not pride not you and your own self and you do your own thing people not caught up and and have a burden about jesus christ when you fall in love with the lord you want to do the things that pleases god so not your children for it's not the family first not what you feel first is what god first what jesus want first so jesus become the team of your life jesus become the center point of your life everything is wrong we run around jesus not this is me no this is though it's about jesus it's not about you oh hallelujah so let's see that's right and then he quote the scripture he read when zion travail and i think uh i i i when zion travail i think it's a better word why there's a big echo here when zion travail why she brought four children you have to be tore up the atmosphere or anything you have to be torn up so sometimes god allow things to happen to break our spirits to embarrass and shame us and mash us up so when we get broken we could cry because if god leave you intact you are fine everything is everything everything working out how your money are your house you have your car you have your land everything we're gonna find you you don't need god because things were going on nice with you but then god have to crush that break that something has to happen to break your spirit and if your spirit is not broken he will break it because there is going to be a revival praise god do you believe that there is going to be revival and you will have to get in that spirit to get into the revival oh praise anyone do you believe that but iran said you get a wrong way there are arguments you get into the type of atmosphere if there's something in the church someone who is disobedient and acting ugly in the church and causing trouble you will never be able to have a revival as long as that kind of atmospheres are wrong so all the rocks that offend god will move out all the people that want to be ugly go going to move them out run them out squat them out because god's going to have a right atmosphere for a revival oh glory to god he will bust the rocks on off his holy mountain because god going to have a glorious church without spot without wrinkles and no human ever stop that church hallelujah no pastor human no elder human no deacon human no office on human no believer human no human spirit went to stop that church from coming forth because the mount of the lord had spoke on it oh praise the name of the lord do you believe that so so watch if somebody acting ugly in the church and causing trouble you will never be able to have a revival as long as that kind of atmospheres are wrong you have to have everybody if you notice when the holy spirit came on pentecost they were all in one place in one accord waiting for the promise and when we get like that the revival will be there there oh praise god hallelujah and the reason i think we have just had protracted meetings instead of a revival because we do not have a revival nation as yet we have revival like they did in the wesley revival scotland all these revival days of wesley they had great breaking up on worldwide revival by john wesley that's when i take care of a revival i notice in my ministry and this is whatever i'm talking now the people will spiritual people and yet they will watch what god will do and signs and something that he will perform and the people sit and say well that's very fine and you'll notice go will do something else now and they will say that's very nice we appreciate that god is a good god well it's your duty god you did this as a duty no real burden you just take it for granted god blessing you you have health and strength you take god for granted if they got flattened and they're lying on a hospital bed flat then you recognize oh god what you're taking for granted that's why you ought to have a attitude of gratitude let me say it again you have to have you should have an attitude of gratitude you don't need to complain because you have faced the b system yet ufc faced depressed yet you are gone in the wilderness yet the devil take you all day yet so right now you should have an attitude of gratitude that god will open your eyes to see this end time message oh glory to god to see if you will stay with the world until your time comes hallelujah you're going to wait till your time comes we only waiting you know but one day the tea gonna turn the clock is ticking down you know time is running now oh glory to god there's going to be a revival hallelujah just when the worst earthquake to strike america struck the revival holy ghost in azusa that's true hallelujah 1906 i believe it was yes i think it was 1906. hallelujah was a great earthquake and people was blaming god for that it was a great destructive earthquake with many fires but there was another earthquake in the spiritual realm that was littered up a different kind of fire it was holy ghost fire it was a bonfire it was the association revival and i believe tonight there's gonna be another earthquake but this time will be the bright revival it's going to be a holy ghost revival he said what we see should make a church that would make up revival that people will fly from everywhere saying the seven thunders of revelation 10. that is not even written it's being manifested all glory to god so i am under great expectation tonight oh glory to god amen do you believe that brother branham says now if there really was a revival in the air when those things would take place every soul will grasp it quickly there will be no end to it it will just go from one to another from one to another it will keep moving of course you know i'm american like you are but in africa down here where they're supposed to be heathen land it will kinda wouldn't make us feel ashamed of ourselves to see how they receive the gospel when they see one supernatural thing performed thirty thousand received christ as christian savior at one time that was he means 20 000 there's no question it was just over that's all and i will tell you listen to this brother brown i think our people has relied too much on education and theology and so forth and has let it take the spirit's place so now it's the message loaded with knowledge and information and revelation and understanding and topics and discussion and fellowship and people have no faith no atmosphere loading with theology and the theology is end up a substitute for the spirit that's supposed to be here present for the spirit that's supposed to be working oh hallelujah let me drop this to you i believe in ezekiel the 9th chapter that's what we read i'm pretty sure i may be wrong i know i'm quite sure ezekiel 9 chapter when the holy spirit went forth first it was a man when fought from behind the gates with slaughtering weapons to destroy so this is these angels was coming to destroy is one among them was that one with the ink on with the right side isn't that right and that was of course scripturally applied was before the destruction of jerusalem and there was a man came forth with a white robe and an incorn by his side and the commission was given to him by god to go through the city now listen to this and set a mark upon the forehead and he call it he say it here i'm reading i'm still reading the sealing of the holy spirit they're not understanding and getting a revelation and you know the word come to me you're not talking about that now he's talking about a man do you have that mark you're talking about a mark this is not i say you should have this or a pastor say no no this is the scriptures now he says now go through listen set a mark upon the forehead the ceiling of the holy spirit a mark upon the forehead of every man or woman that sighed and cried for the abomination dead in the city so that's the quality of spirit that's a quality attitude sighing and crying for the abomination now i want to ask you if he was coming to chicago tonight how many places would he find tonight that in the home they are laying sobbing for revival just in such a travail of soul that they can't stand it any longer they just don't know what to do i wonder how many would he mark in chicago tonight of this city of almost 5 million people in it what would he mark i imagine you could cong them on your fingers hardly don't you think so the people with that type of burden and yet that was exactly he wasn't a mark no one but that type are you that type do you want to become that type do you want god to come and put that burden on you that you want to be signed and crying and groaning and travailing according to the scripture we read when zion travail zion brought forth if there is no travail nothing coming forth therefore god have to bring on a travail of soul a travail in your spirit beyond where you just have your needs met and and things being met and things working out for you something have to go beyond that that you could grasp the burden of god oh hallelujah praise god you see people individuals inside i have the individual interests and burdens and conditions we who in ministry not fortunate to be in your position amen because we have the burden of the entire church so when you study you and your family we can study our own family we have to study the entire church the burden is different the responsibility is different the weight is different amen hallelujah so you can't look for all the individual attention if this was a thousand people how much hand we will shake how much people will go home by and fellowship with it can't work it can't work you have to good up your loins and become a christian and make yourself a christian you have to do that you ain't born a christian you're born hungry and twisted after righteousness you have to be blessed jesus said blessed are they that are hungering and taste after righteousness i want god to bless you tonight that when you leave here you have a hungering in your soul that you can't even explain because god after creating that and baraban said lord created me a revival let me hunger let me taste god after creating god to create it in you if it is not in you you're only going to church your church member just a church member [Music] he wasn't a mark no one but that type a people you see what i mean he said we got to get mellowed up before god hallelujah now jesus a man went out and another man went out another hour and worked another man went out and worked and one man went out the eleventh hour and when he stopped at the 11th hour he gave every one of them the same portion 11 tower they wondered why why did he did everyone working luther worked under looted the speciation the method is shouted diarno wesley died in grace we are living in another age not back there mother used to go on an ox cat we go in a ford v8 move forward almost jet propelled we are living in a different age we are living in a different dispensation we are living in the day here we go of the restoration of the powers of god not bible textile power of god because that is what the azusa street introduced for years as bible texts hallelujah the catholic church had taken the bible from the people and when and when they had no bibles so the priest was interpreting the word to them god had the germans to invent the printed press because the bible was about to be restored so when they invented printing press the bible went on print and then wesley spread the print then god invent make science and then the audio tape because barbara branham was coming that we could get the taste of the voice hallelujah god knows what you're doing when he won the word printed he got it printed when he won the word spread he got it spread when he wanted that he got it on tape now he wanted to be seen oh go with your thoughts so that's why we have video that's why we are streaming because god wants he said the holy ghost will go across the world overnight overnight this holy ghost will go across the world oh hallelujah it will sweep across the world the latter rain will sweep the world go give the lord some praises glory to god so these four angels these angels were angels of destruction that angel to smile god is a good god every time no no not that these ancients came to destroy destruction angels they come in to destroy to hurt the earth to hurt the sea hallelujah amen angel's coming for destruction and then these four angels what hold back hold back what barman said now watch hold it until what until what hold the four winds hold back the destruction angels got to hold back destruction destruction coming you know but hold it back you know how close he was but he hold it back hallelujah earthquakes holding back hallelujah this part holding back until what until the 11th hour people would come in you know who is that that is 11 hour gentle workers do you see what god see you are this is what the bible say you are you are the 11th hour gentile workers that god everything we've waited for you everything is being held back for you all the destruction all glory to god oh hallelujah because a sealed angel is coming no no man angel are still an angel oh glory to god i said it again not no man angel i've seen an angel a ceiling they are coming to seal you the angel from the east oh give me remember the kingdom hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord the angel from the east oh my my hallelujah glory to god hallelujah holding the four winds and the earth and the wind that should not blow on the earth or the sea nor on any tree and i saw another man egypt from the east having the seal of the living god oh hallelujah because destruction coming to the earth but obama had a vision he saw it coming it was his seventh vision where america was blown up you'll get to it oh praise god so here what he says 11th hour people were coming the last calling of the gentiles mother worked there dada worked their grandmother worked back there this is our age the 11th hour world wars stopped on the 11th month in the year in the 11th day of the month the 11th hour of the day world wars was stopped in the november the 11th at the 11th hour nobody can explain how it stopped that time but god was showing a sign of the 11th hour workers gentile workers coming in isn't that right he said in the 11 minutes of the hour that 11 hour people might come in to receive the same baptism of the holy ghost that they did back there in the beginning let me say it again because this has not preached much in the message but i'm going to preach it hallelujah hallelujah the 11th hour workers is to receive the same baptism of the holy ghost that they had at the beginning that's why william branham was sent to turn our hearts back to the fate of the fathers they can't get around it preach whatever they want to preach we have to go back to the faith of the fathers and works is faith express all glory to god once the faith of the fathers is restored you have to have the expression of the works that the fathers have not talked the fathers have oh give the lord some praises hallelujah to receive what the same baptism of the holy ghost what is saying we explain that sunday same same not the explanation of the holy ghost not our understanding and theological uh theology of the holy ghost we are that not that but the same when when god finished with peter he was staggering when god finished with mary she was staggering when god finished with james and andrew and all them brothers in the upper room there was tagging like junk men we want that same one that make you drunk like drunk men oh give the lord a shout we don't want to murder the holy ghost we want to mental holy ghost we want the same holy ghost no intellectual holy ghost no explaining holy ghost oh hallelujah i am taking that [Applause] hallelujah i let a new man feed me with that talk same talk hallelujah amen amen hallelujah i want you convinced i want you to be convinced it's the same holy ghost i want you to be convinced what peter had and paul had is what you have to have i want you to be convinced that you don't want nothing less than that don't let nobody explain that away from you nobody i don't care much mysteries how much revelations how much understanding there is something called the power of god the power of god listen listen listen to receive the baptism holy ghost like they did back there in the beginning to bring back the power and the resurrection of the lord jesus same signs same wonders say miracles what is it the wars are struggling here struggling there struggling here struggling the atomic bombs everything else they are being built up but they can't do it they can't do it until the jews gets a visitation of the baptism of the holy ghost not not teachings you know i heard a voice said how much was sealed i heard a hundred and forty watt house was sealed from this tribe and that tribe sealed and before they could be sealed there's a gentile right to be sealed with the same holy ghost [Applause] not talked sealed [Applause] they can't do it until the jews get the vision of the bathroom when they goes the angels said hold it till we see the seventh not the bride the gentiles never was i said but we are sons and daughters of god that's servants the jews are abraham god's savior so you are the 11th hour workers hallelujah and god is holding back what the three and a half years tribulation from you because the foolish virgins going to three and a half year tribulation oh glory you will be escaping the three and a half years tribulation by having this seal of god that's what the seed come for for you to escape three and a half years tribulation oh that that is not a shock tonight that's enough job is it hallelujah to god that income right there is mercy before judgment oh glory to god do you believe that oh hallelujah hallelujah so before any tribulation can whatever come god have to seal you first do you believe that oh glory to god hallelujah glory to the lord so let me just break in here this is an interjection from azusa and this is all testimony from it and i hear terry talk about the choir singing heavenly music and different things listen to this especially the enchanted strange of the so-called heavenly choir or him sung under the evident direction of the holy spirit both as to words and tune trill my whole being is a testimony from azusa street it was not something that could be repeated at will but supernaturally given for each special occasion and was one of the most indisputable evidences of the presence of the power of god perhaps nothing so greatly impressed people as this singing at once inspiring by a holy oar or feeling of indescribable wonder especially the hearers were in devote attitude this one i get to divine love was wonderfully manifest in the meetings they would not even allow an unkind word said against the opposes or the churches the message was the love of god it was a sort of face love of the early church returned it was a sort of first love of the early church return the baptism as we receive it in the beginning did not allow us to talk about the baptism of the holy ghost did not allow us to think speak or hear evil of any man that was repeated that that's what repeated the baptism of the holy ghost did not allow us to think speak or hear evil of any man the spirit was very sensitive and tender as a dove [Music] [Applause] how do you like that hidden mystery that's a real mystery oh hallelujah not arrogant and proud and lose your lip and say where you're going and this is me talking this is not that the spirit sensitive as a dove one man said i would rather live six months at that time than 50 years of ordinary life i have stopped more than once within two blocks of the place and prayed for strength before i dare go on the presence of the lord was so real two blocks and he asking for god for strength to reach the place because the power of god is upon him let me read on here now the presence of the lord was so real scores of people were seen dropping into prostrate position in the streets before they ever reached the mission they would would get up speak in tongues without any influence from jesus people god had accomplished his will g h lange reports that some who came to investigate were baptized in the holy ghost in their legends scores of personal and eyewitness accounts attest that men who came to ridicule the meetings were knocked to the floor where they seem to wrestle with unseen opponents sometimes for hours these are the people coming to ridiculousness they will come you know oh yes when the spirit falls it raises up other spirits and satan will send every crackpot to see if he can disrupt our genuine holy ghost revival so listen to this these people okay these people generally arose convicted of sin and seeking god one foreign-born reporter had been assigned by his paper to record his circus-like atmosphere in a comic relief fashion so he come and looking for kicks he coming to give a report he attended a nighttime meeting sitting finally back in the midst of the meeting a young woman began to testify how god had baptized her with the holy spirit when she suddenly broke into tongues after the meeting the reporter sought her out and asked her where she had learned the language of his native country she answered that she didn't have any idea what she had said and that she spoke only english he then related to her that she had given an entirely accurate account of his sinful life all in the language of his native tongue oh blessed be the name of the lord so it wasn't a game in those days now it wasn't that play thing and but ram says the holy ghost will be back in the church and there will be anas in sapphira and god gonna deal with them one more he said we'll be a perfect church go go protect that church it will be a powerful church holy ghost in the church oh glory to god people can hide under the word word word but they can't hide on the spirit oh give the lord a shout come on give the lord some praises let me say it again they can hide under mysteries they can hide in the teaching they can hide in the word word word word but they cannot hide in their spirit because they spiritual bring this in men and the spirit will expose or give the lord a praise offering glory to god let me drop a bomb on you you ready you ready god will do in one year what all the theologians fail to do in 2000 years he said give me a church full of the holy ghost full of the old eagles full of the holy ghost god will do it one year oh glory to god i am worried i am worried at all because fire is coming power is coming oh glory to god hallelujah what we'll do in one year what all the collusion failed to do in two thousand years oh my so brother branham in uh ten virgins he was preaching this he said put you be for unbeliever fo for formal and essay for saved now in the save church they have unbeliever so we're not selling them they're formal church them tellers that don't know we're not studying them we talk about save church now oh in this saved church have have keep in mind in this safe church there's two classes in this church right here come on in the same church we talked about message church in this message we just have two classes and he saved church which is a type of christ one of them was a sleeping vision the other one had oil in their lamp hallelujah glory to god now in the days of the coming of titus after jesus left the holy spirit was that man with the incorn at his side hallelujah the holy spirit was that man with the income at his side and he went to jerusalem to set a mark upon people now i want you to notice something church member and you who claim to have the holy spirit he said don't seal any of them but then that sigh and cry for the abomination on the city now where is anybody so burdened about the world now and their condition people so selfish they can't concern about people in the church not just for the world in this condition souls going to hell and there's no testimony from you someone's going to hell and you can't even witness oh god save you somebody testified to you that is why you are here tonight you can't even testify to anybody and you're a christian no you're a church member you come to church and you go back home a christian is to be christ-like yes christ came to get sinners christ come to redeem peter come james come and you come amen [Music] don't seal any of them with them where is anybody so burdened about the world now in the condition you say i'm messing this i'm baptist so what difference does that make oh not that constant burden for the loss that sweetness don't never let anything rise up and put bitterness in your soul people angry and bitter in their soul they will get them a long time because then you're gone no matter how bad anyone ever treats you anything don't be guilty of letting that thing anchor in your soul it will grieve the holy spirit away from you it certainly will come in the church without holy spirit going home the word holy spirit going to work with the holy spirit what what kind of life is that that would be sinners living out there did you have the holy spirit you could make yourself get the holy spirit that your life could be guided by the holy spirit amen not by your human spirits on the world you're a human spiritual winner listen you have a human spirit you know you have a will of your own jesus not my will but your will be done you have a human spirit but have the holy spirit that if you yield to the holy spirit it can't lead you contrary to his word [Music] because the spirit and the word is one let's continue oh my my patience now to see whether this message we got is connected with it or not the very hour that israel was signing to be a nation is the very same hour the very same day the very same month i was at green mill indiana and the angel appeared to me and sent me out on the field with this he met me down the river and told me that would take place then commissioned me 11 years later at the same hour that israel was signing a nation it is all connected together amen the in then he made a statement and let me keep preaching something like that the angel of the lord is unhooked now he is moving around fixing everything for the coming of the lord now 1914 the world went to war there have been never had been peace since contrary swinging swinging swinging in and they're doing the very same thing yet and they was doing what holding he said oh god have mercy holding that great thing that i saw in the vision the whole team become a destruction holding the atomic hole in the wars that they don't destroy themselves until the team come to destroy it until israel returns back and get herself together and then the messenger will go to israel and she'll be sealed with the seal of the holy spirit after the gentiles is called out the people for his name's sake then israel only receives a three and six three years and six month message daniel said so there's given a space is given for the gentiles when it comes to this age he called it the times of the gentiles not even fixed just ecologists the times of the gentiles and when that time of the general is over the door is shut not one more gentile to be saved and then god go over to the jews oh my hallelujah could i read a little bit then there's three and a half years left for the jews now if we get over version 11 we'll pick it up at the end of that elijah and moses returns again and preached to the jews two men anointed with that spirit or maybe them themselves they never died so they killed them and they lay in the street called sodom where our lord was crucified jerusalem and after three days the life spirit came into them and they went up and raised up and then about a third of the earth was blown to pieces at that time [Music] you mean this is real you mean this is going to happen he said a third of the earth was blown up to pieces at that time now here the jews that come in to preach to the world cannot will not blow up one another or kill one another or destruction come until the jews come down to that place and here sets the bible he saw four angels and watch what they got to receive they have got to receive the holy ghost oh hallelujah praise god ephesians 4 30 the holy spirit sealed until the day of your redemption and they cannot do nothing until those jews return oh praise god hallelujah i love him tonight the last evening we picked up and find out that the first church how it started off it was tired of pentecost where the holy spirit was poured out upon believers and we saw the reaction of these believers and how they acted upon them nobody talks about that they explain where the holy ghost but they had an action and they did and signs and ones follow them we find out at the closing church age about 300 years they sprung up a heresy among them that doctrine was the induction of the nicolaitan we find out it was deeds to begin with in the next churches become a doctrine then they become persecution in the dark age then the other side it come protestant church martin luther watch and he's seeing the spirit of god lead him out instead of letting the people stay free he organized a church and made an image liking unto the beast you showed any spirit around what god seeing people say that church god's seen an image on to the beast and let's let's go further a political power lightning onto it instead of letting the people walk as god gives light they organize under a discipline that they have to stay to that discipline what happened in the message what happened to churches people are doing doctrine and teaching and people following doctrine and teaching hallelujah and that and and that is supposed to put them in the bride like i'm like i said on sunday there is no private bride nobody can take a church outside and like guide the brother jesus christ and then minister to the brethren jesus christ that that doesn't exist the bride of christ is a body by one spirit you are baptized into that one body nobody can hijack that bride and have that bride and a father look at hijack choose members any time you can have thousands of church members but that ride that jesus right first thessalonians 4 the lord himself descended from heaven with a shout to get that right he sent a message to get that bride oh glory to god if god called you by this message oh glory to god you are you are privileged you are privileged because the bride will not be manhandled then brighton will be flesh of his flesh word of his word spirit of his spirit oh glory to god amen god listen listen god moved right out into the methodist church the methodists had a revival that struck the world the holy spirit was with them teaching sanctification and the first thing you know they organized the church and made an image unto the beast a political organized power to bind the people that is what that anointing does it binds the people to assist them and not the holy ghost that is what we are fighting hallelujah systems binding is a power you know it's making them fall along and pack out there's no power because buying the people the people can't move the people can't worship the people can't break out there is no signs there was no wonders there was no miracles there was no power the church is dead under our power a different kind of power you see we don't see this power you don't see it as a power but it's the power i'm reading it to you he said the first thing you know watch god move over the first thing you know when they did that they organized the church made an image unto the beast that's right a political organized power to bind the people of god to a creed instead of being free to worship and walk in light as light was thrown in their path did you realize christian friends that the antichrist which is the mark of the beast aha now we come to another mark put a mark the incorn writer have a mac and the b's have a mark it's just two marks it's not 24 max it's not tattooing all over it's just two marks mark of god and mark of the beast i will say that it's just two i like that it's simple it's just two marks it's not 24 markers a buffet style max take whatever mark you want it's just two marks mark of god mark of the beast mark of god mark of the beast sealed in or sealed oh hallelujah oh give the lord a shout i will say it again either you are ceiling or sealed out there's no in between there is no in between all that well on the earth shall worship the beasts whose names are not written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world oh glory to god we are crazy we're not crazy oh glory to god we are not crazy this is the message this is the word back to the bible back to pentecost back to the holy ghost back to dynamics and we are emphasizing dynamics we're emphasizing the spirit oh my god do you realize christian friends that the antichrist which is the mark of the beast the antichrist everyone knows that the antichrist there that his mark is his power a beast is a power there is a power in the catholic church i want you to understand what the saying here there is a power in the battle in this church so it's not like they have no power you know it's what kind of power because the catholicism of millions is a power keeping them people inside the idea that's right with the two our father entry healing mary it's keeping them there you know they're not moving every sunday morning final divine have them under control church here but iran that is the beast power the baptist church is the same the pentecostal church driver witnessed all of them it's peace power you can't change up a jehovah witness unless the name on the book the stand your witness because that doctrine that bind them the following juvenile witness the following baptists tie tide ahead ring the bell that is it it's a power hallelujah but we have to get our power too our power have to be the same power that peter had because his one lord is one fate and is one baptism oh give the lord a show one lord one fate one baptism it's the holy ghost baptism and those guys had it you wouldn't have it because there's only only one it's not true it's one [Applause] don't let nobody fool you it's not peter had a kind and we really modern age and and we have a kind to no no no the words say one lord one faith one baptism that's why brother branham didn't come and bring a new faith he came to turn your hearts back to defense because there's only one faith oh get the lord assault that's the fate of god abraham had it all glory to god the early church had it only one faith going back to that faith oh hallelujah praise god praise god amen amen amen oh glory to god hallelujah praise god but abraham and this is the way i get whoo get the inspiration from if i could say that man seal of antichrist but abraham god bless you i love you and if you want to see our real genuine gifts are not impersonation if you want to see real solid christians walking so salty till the earth is twisting for them to be like them you can't go down on the street and tell what is christian anymore that's right they all go down the street they all act the same they talk the same all time around cracking all kind of jokes everything like that when god said you'll give a kong for every idol word that you speak what happened because brother you are letting the devil come in and put it over your eyes the first thing you know prophecy the time will come when god will give a message and you'll be sealed in or out the kingdom of god not join church people joining by the thousands he said a message going to come and that message going to either actually seal you in or seal you up that's right he said we need the old-fashioned gospel back in the church back to the word of god a lot of this nonsense and foolishness cut off oh my around the country the things that's done here in our country something coming here not long ago you can't even mention pentecost around our country anymore of account of it coming with a thousand times thousands of dollars taken from the poor people to buy airplanes and so forth never was a little airplane bought and all kind of stuff and get up on the platform bringing air floppers hanging down enough jewels on their fingers to send four missionaries across to the sea and preach the gospel then poor people they're starving to hear the word of god or we call ourselves christians he said brother there is something wrong we have time for everything else no time for prayer meetings the home is all butchered up the girls and boys are all going around lacking around the country mothers and fathers is unconcerned yet pentecostal what we need tonight is a home altar in the house a place where god where the bible is read and the children are taught the word of the living god oh glory to god hallelujah so the wise virgin going to be in travail oh glory to god the wise virgin will be in travail to get the extra oil because the foolish version they're all going to run out oh glory to god they get a temporary blessing he said the holy spirit oh glory to god amen what what what what what what they come to do lamb chill in time what is that the lumbar will weaken it part dipping oil and pat on fire if but george if they don't have the pattern fire they can't see nothing so you have to be the weak part of you an oil and an expert on fire that could give light isn't that right but after a while the the lambda suit up they shade the suit up then you would long time when we have lamp here they do you take the lamp and you take the newspaper and clean it out you trim the lamp you clip the wick and then light it over fresh you get nice light good light salam treatment time you have to sickly clean the lamp and cut the wick oh god lampshaming time all that part that shoot up in your life and smoking up your life that you can't give the light you're supposed to give that's how they get cleaned out all glory to god but your life had to be in oil and you had to be on fire fire on one end oil in one end isn't that right hallelujah glory to god do you believe that hallelujah so i'm talking about it's heading up to two great things coming to the end time the mark of god and the seal of the beasts isn't that right on the seal of god any minister no is a baptism of the holy ghost remember what the mark of the beast is the mark of the beast is carnal esau reject that birthright didn't he so we bitterly trying to restore that with right again but there was no place of repentance when you reject the holy ghost you seal yourself outside of god's mercy no you say brother branham you if you can tell us our diseases and so forth you are prophet well i am still the same person that's right i still got the scripture said it's exactly right it's the truth it's hearing people say there'll be a mark it's already marked just reject the holy ghost and you are marked receive the holy ghost and you are marked that's right receive it once and see what take place receive it once that's the mark of god and you are sealed to your eternal destination like the cow out on the road the inspector comes and i know if you didn't get the holy ghost last night that went in there check up the night the inspector of the holy ghost is here inspecting you over i used to work at the pennsylvania railroad we load a car with cans the inspector comes around shake everything to see if there was any looseness and that's the way god does his church he shake it to see what's the matter with it to see if there's any looseness in you before he pours his spirit into you and if the church is a little shaky he won't pour his spirit into it if you still love the world and want to do the scene of the world you will never get the holy ghost upon that you might get a confusion you might get stammering lips you might get speaking in tongues but you still that don't mean you have got the holy ghost when you got the holy ghost you are sealed by god to your eternal destination when the inspector come and check that don't go a good that car you shut the door and put a seal on it and when god sees you are ready so lord for him he fills you with the holy ghost you are sealed by the holy ghost until your destination oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah praise god praise god so we are waiting for the finishing of the seventh seal to prove who we are oh glory to god the bride get caught up at the finishing of the seventh seal and the foolish version will be exposed for the three and a half year tribulation period oh glory to god resisting the holy ghost and they will not even know it until the tribulation hit them hallelujah dance and jamborees tribulation go hit them the resistant right room oh my hallelujah glory to god that's the reason i spoke against the church there's only one church and that's the body of christ but these lodges that is called churches blasphemous name why blasphemy it is to be contrary or speak against what god said and god said come and be born and they say come and join and when the baptism of the spirit is forced he took over for water away from the catholic church he said and the protestant church an emotion in the pentecostal church instead of the person of christ coming in with all that building material instead of the person of christ coming in with all that pyramid building we had the other day after your faith virtue and spiritual knowledge peter said these things glory that's the holy ghost faith and virtue and knowledge and depth that's the holy ghost oh give the lord some praises that is what the pentecostals was short of oh my let's continue quickly the green angel of the covenant jesus christ thought not rabbiting equal with god the first exodus he brought him from a natural land to a natural land from egypt to kingdom land the second exodus he brought him out of a spiritual condition into the baptism of the holy ghost and this third one now he's bringing up from the spiritual baptism of the holy ghost to that eternal line in the millennium it has to come from the holy ghost baptism to the land of the millennium he said come out of chaos come to the living god come to the word and the word is made flesh and dwell among us so praise god talking about the virgins here five were wise had all in their lamps the other fives was pure holy had no oil they were sanctified with all the holy ghost there's treated their record on earth water blood spirit so john first john 5 7 they are treated their record in heaven father son and holy ghost these three are one they are treated their record on earth water blood and spirit they are not one they are green one you can't have the father without having the son you can't have this holy ghost to happen fathers and holy ghosts they are one they are inseparable but you can be justified without being sanctified you can be signified without having the holy ghost you can be clean live a pure life have a former godliness deny the power and everything else but there's your five wise virgins who are all in the lambs rapture and fate oh glory to god so he wrap up oil as rapture and fate which is the faith to leave here oh glory to god when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth oh glory to god rapturing faith is what it will take to leave here then he says we can't have faith for divine healing hope we gotta fear for the rapture [Applause] so the rapture

cross over to the other side [Applause] it forced jesus to go to the other side to deliver my name religion [Music] [Applause] faith is god's currency brahman said all that you are all that you ever

would not be lost but we'll go to the tribulation period okay let's wrap up now recognizing your d on this message recognizing your day and this message the seventh angel's message is to open the mystery of the seals calling the 11th hour gentile workers to receive the same pay the first of our workers got here open the scenes to say we know more than them we have seals we have mysteries open the purpose of opening the seals is to call the 11 hour gentile workers to receive the same pay say same pay same pairs the same holy ghost this holy ghost is just as real as when it fell of the day of pentecost oh glory to god same holy ghost how many wanted tonight oh glory to god hallelujah so jesus taught it somewhere in harvest and they received the same pain i'll skip them they said no watch it so perfectly all the first hour messengers with the word with the gospel with the truth they came out of their pentecost and there was a dark age that blocked them out then in the middle of the day luther wesley came in and then there is to be here we go an evening time message to receive the same thing that is at the beginning and then he said the evening time message is to be stole back again to bring back that same thing he said we say you communism 19 churches united the bride united united themselves god united why never before since the early church was the pillar of fire among the people never before since the early church did they see the things we are seeing today and this listen was only made possible when god sends seven seals and give us a sign by it he sends seven angels down from heaven come to bring back that scattered word in them denominations and tied back into the word of god again to bring down his holy spirit so all this word unfolding word revealing and words showing and would tying together the object of the tiny word together to see this big picture is to bring down very long shout it out bring down the holy ghost so the object is to bring it down oh give it a god as many as receive him to them get the power to become the sons of god it will take the holy ghost to form you into the word image oh glory to god no teaching doing that oh man you could teach a serpent yeah when i say not supernatural you could teach yourself and super into somebody's heart but i'm saying you have a secret in your heart and you're sleeping you're baptized that person is sick and still there your shaykh is hannah welcome to the church you're super silly because you're born with that serpent born in sin comedy will speak in line supernatural you

holy ghost because your daughter you receive it it's a promise and we have to preach it because it's a promise it's a promise of god if you don't preach it you can't get it you have to know it's a promise but i'm saying you have to know it's given for you oh glory to god you have to know what it is and you have to know it is given for you and we are here to say it's given for you oh glory to god let's go on crosstalk oh my my mind so seven angels come to gather this scattered word to bring the vision of what we're supposed to receive jesus did the same thing when he rose from the dead he appears to disciples and those would open their understanding and open their word that they might know what they receive jesus had to tell him nothing again he said tarry in the city of jerusalem until you endured with more revelations no that's what you give them until you endure with your interpretation no i'm telling even doing more mysteries until you get books and tapes dropping from heaven no until you get power from where from where from where from on high [Applause] oh give the lord a shout is there no man coming down from on high is only god to come and roman so jesus let them know where the power coming from this is not and oh my god when a power strike peter saw and they start up strong it was about the ninth hour the day early in the morning i wanted them for the sudden drunk so and people said these people drunk peter come and say these people i get my whole people people talking these people are not drunk as you suppose but this is that that the prophet joel spit peter peter but he couldn't walk straight these people are not drunk as you suppose and you're walking like a junk man drunk in the spirit that's how we had to come now drunk in the spirit i ain't a crazy preacher this is the same old time holy spirit that the devil won't go near it that the people that people spirit but it's good enough for me we need this old fashioned we need it i'm going to close right here oh my my my my mind oh national for us but the churches and the world cups are churches he said but the power of god will put the people in the bride no man could do that no teacher
