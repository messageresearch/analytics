tonight in the precious theme of jesus christ what an atmosphere we feel you can keep playing softly what an anointing we feel in this place tonight are you thankful that you could be in the house of the lord oh there are many people who couldn't make it to the house of the lord tonight that's a reason to be thankful to the lord and you could be in his house did you enter into his gates with thanksgiving oh hallelujah hallelujah do you have a reason to be thankful oh do you thank him for the test and the trials and the ups and the towns did you thank him that at the end of the year you made it the devil thought he could wipe you out but you made it the devil thought he could stop you but you made it oh blessed be the name of the lord amen i'm not the preacher tonight i'm here to introduce the preacher the pastor asked me to introduce him tonight so it's a great privilege to introduce our pastor i appreciate your pastor this evening amen and before he comes i just want to greet the church so if you have your bibles just one verse in first thessalonians chapter 5 just one verse of scripture we're going to read just so i can greet you and and the pastor will preach tonight so first thessalonians 5 and reading from verse verse 18. first thessalonians 5 and verse 18. and the bible says in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you i want to read it one more time in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated and certainly i want to give thanks tonight to be in the land of the living i want to give thanks tonight that we could give god worship i want to give thanks tonight that he is god and he chose me and he chose you i want to give thanks tonight that i may have fallen down but he kept me back up i want to give thanks tonight that even though we had our ups and downs we have made it to this point tonight and i was saying that you know there's so many reasons to be thankful and many of us don't understand how important it is to give thanks and many don't even realize that it is the will of god it is in his will so many times you talk about the will of god and the will of god and the purpose of god and the plan of god and we talk about adoption and we talk about perfection and that is all part of it yes but it's also a will of god that we be thankful so as a christian we identified it in bible studies a few weeks ago we cannot be complaining as a christian complaining cannot be part of your vocabulary it can be part of your daily walk god doesn't have complainers in the kingdom what he has are people that are thankful because as bad as things may ever get there's still a reason in there to give god thanks oh hallelujah so i asked i said what can i encourage the people with at the end of this year that has been like no other year is you have a reason to give god thanks through it all you could thank him through the trials you could thank him through the ups and downs you could thank him can the church say amen oh i believe one of the challenges is we don't thank god enough we don't find enough reasons to thank god i was speaking about over a few days ago the fact that you woke up this morning is a reason to thank god i can't understand christians who don't have a reason to worship and to thank and to praise god because every if you look at everything that happened to you there's a reason in there for you to thank god there's a reason we need to thank god for sending a message to catch your attention oh hallelujah you didn't find this message this message from you that's a reason to thank god you didn't oh come on now you may be seated just a few words before the pastor comes but i feel so thankful that he chose me he didn't have to do it but he did i'm one in a million and that's a reason to thank god oh hallelujah oh before you complain thank god before you get into an argument thank god before you go and bad talk somebody thank god and watch your situation change oh can the church say amen oh hallelujah you maybe see that you know we sing that song count your blessings one by one count your blessings name them one by one and there's a reason to name them one by one because if you look at the negativity and you look at all that went wrong and and this didn't work out and that didn't work out you could spend your time in that realm but if you want to spend your time in all of the reasons that you have to thank god for he didn't have to do it but he did he sent a prophet he sent paul he sent iranians he sent martin he sent columba when the devil tried to bring a negative talk you just begin to thank god he sent a prophet he sent a message oh come on now he tied at the cross for you he sent his son all of that is a reason to thank god can the church say amen oh and we can thank him for the promise the promise of healing the promise of revival the promise of deliverance the promise of adoption the promise of the baptism of the holy ghost can the church say amen you may be seated i'm almost finished i'm just a thing that even jesus when he was on the earth they brought five loaves and two fishes to him and my bible tells me i don't know about your bible but my bible says that when he had given thanks the moment he gave thanks it didn't even say he prayed it just said when he gave thanks he said go share it so as thanks is connected to power or you didn't realize this huh the moment you be that's why when the prophet was praying for people to say thank god for your healing he didn't even tell him go pray for your healing because he says go your way you're healed he said just leave your thank him just thank god for your healing walk the street and say i thank you for your healing i thank you for healing i thank you for my children being delivered and there's a prophecy over you that this gospel is to you and to your children and to them that are foul it's time to thank god for the deliverance of your family it's time to thank god for your healing can the church say amen listen when jesus went at the grave of lazarus the bible tells me that then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee so the first thing that jesus did before doing anything in that situation was a father i thank thee that thou has hurt me when how thankful are you every day there's a reason to thank god oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i'm almost done in the message expectation brother said i'm expecting great things are you expecting great things are you expecting greater than what you have seen are you expecting greater than what you have heard are you expecting greater than what you have experienced by the brahms and i'm expecting great things and that expectancy will get that unity among the people so expectation will bring unity people will be reunited because they're expecting something from god they'll be united not to hear man but to get an experience with god and listen to the prophet that's what happened on the day of pentecost what brought the holy ghost in the first place they went up there and stayed 10 days and nights until they were all in one place and with one accord blessing god for something that they did not have [Music] listen to the prophet now they were blessing god for something that they did not have is that right they were thanking god i'm reading the prophet they were thanking god for the holy ghost the holy ghost had not even come yet but they had it in seed form so they hadn't got it yet they hadn't received it yet but the thanks that they were giving was in anticipation of what was going to happen what are you expecting tonight what are you expecting this year what are you expecting for your house what are you expecting for your family whatever that expectation is i encourage you beginners thank god don't wait for 2021 beginners thank god right now can the church say amen i'm almost done in god revealing himself to his people the word is a seed is that right that a sower sword in the ground and every seed will bring forth of its kind if you need salvation the seed is here if you need healing here's a seed in the word the word of god is a seed put it in your heart don't dig it up every morning to see if it's sprouted put it in there and leave it there it's god's business to bring for the harvest let me say it one more time it's god's business to bring forth the harvest you just leave it there water it by faith and praise every day thanking god for it oh um come on now come on now come on now oh i'm about done just three scriptures psalms 100 verse 4 the bible says enter into his gates with thanksgiving so when you come into the house of the lord this will be thanksgiving all over you this will be thanksgiving all over you people ought to recognize that you have a reason to thank god and enter his courts with praise the psalmist david repeats it he said be thankful unto him and bless his name so the thankfulness was connected to blessing his name for the lord is good isn't he good for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endure it to all generations just two more scriptures and i'm done in philippians 4 6 listen to the listen to paul's letter here be careful for nothing don't be anxious for nothing all the things you're trying to put in place don't be anxious for it but in everything by prayer and supplication listen with thanksgiving so if you're praying and you have supplication and there's no thanksgiving then this scripture cannot be completed come on now somebody help me with prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god hallelujah and the peace of god which pass it all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus my last scripture first chronicles 16 34 all give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endure it forever and that's my testimony at the end of 2020 in a year that the ecclesiastical realm didn't know what to do with it the political realm didn't know what to do with it the doctors are struggling with what to do with it the world is crippled trying to figure out what to do with it we can give thanks unto the lord for he is good his mercy endure it forever he has never let his sheep beg bread he has never forsaken his righteous and those every sea that is predestinated will come to life and it is god's business i love that quote it is god's business to bring forth the harvest we can't bring the harvest it's his part to do it but what do we do we worship we praise we are thankful we thank god for the victory we thank god for victory we thank god for healing we thank god for revival we thank god that we are alive we thank god we can lift our hands we thank god we can even worship we thank god that we have a voice to say yes lord i believe we thank god for the prophet we thank god for the message we thank you for the season and the time give the lord a hand our praise oh let's all stand to our feet as we welcome our pastor tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord keep worshiping him may the lord richie

come and have the preeminencies hear your people guide it here lord speak to their hearts may their life never be the same lord the world has been affected by this pandemic and nothing is the same may they realize that the forces that has affected this is things that they cannot see with their eye oh god but they know it's dear and we have a power we have a presence we have a kingdom that we cannot see with our natural eye but we know it is there god made that anoint and come tonight upon your people lord like when he lied to save and father when he said lord open his boy eyes and when he looked around he saw chariots of fire then he said there is more for us than against us i mean the people know tonight there's more for them than against them granted lord in jesus name i ask it amen amen god bless you and welcome if you have your bibles i'd like to turn to matthew chapter 16 13 verse 13 to 18 and also hebrews 11 we won from verse 22 to 40. god bless you and welcome this is the final day of 2020 a year that everybody want disappear they want get that soon fast behind and just just just move on back but we are grateful to god of what it did for us because we survived we came through holding on and pressing on in the feet so let's look at matthew 16 familiar scripture uh when jesus came this was sitting into the coast of caesarea philippi his disciples saying whom do men say i the son of man am that they said some said our john the baptist jeremiah one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say he that i am simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus responds jesus answered and said unto him blessed are the dull sovereign but jonah for flesh and blood had not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i see unto that i say also unto thee that peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and from hebrews chapter 11 familiar scripture we want to take it from verse 22 by faith joseph when he died make mention of the departing of the children of the of israel and give commandment concerning his bones i hate moses when he was born was hit three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment but if it moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of feral daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god and to enjoy pleasures of sin for season 26 esteeming to report christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith of egypt not fearing a wrath of the king for he endured asean him who is invisible through fate he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood least he that destroyed the first one should touch them by fate they passed to the red sea by on dried land which the egyptians are seen to do were drowned by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by faith the harlot rehab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace what shall i more see for the time would feel to tell of gideon of barak of samson of jephthah of david also samuel of the prophets who threw fate subdue kingdoms wrought righteousness obtain promises stop them out of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax valentine fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens woman received their dead race their life again others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection others had trial of cruel mockings and scourging's here moreover bonds and imprisonment they were stoned one they were sown asunder they were tempted they were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheepskin and goat skin being destitute afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god having provided some better things for us that day without us should not be made perfect may god bless his word you may be seated and the emphasis there is day without us o praise god day without us all these big heroes of faith all these big testimonies day without us should not be made perfect god receives something better for us day without us you are important to god tonight day without us you got to make it somehow you got to make it amen so the title tonight the gates of hell shall not prevail against this last day bride that's the title of tonight the gates of hell shall not prevail against his lasting bride of a subject spiritual revelation of the will of god and an inspiration cry out until the promised word is vindicated o praise the name of the lord praise god hallelujah this virus has been a force a force of order a force of discipline a force of social distance in the force to sanitize to wear masks so so that because you will be at risk what about the judgments of god what about the promises of god what about the truth of god the great hour of charges at hand oh praise god but isaac preached a message in this virtual ghana convention position in place for the final showdown the reason that jesus told the disciple upon this rock i will build my church we're not talking about this church we're not talking about head stone tabernacle we're not talking about some building or some group he said upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it the reason he injected about the gates of hell because jesus knew a battle will be on oh glory to god no no picnic is a battle on this year was a battle and if you think this year easy to wait till next second a few minutes not next trump is going to blow oh glory so you have to be on you have to understand you have to be prepared for this war oh glory let me say it again you have to be prepared for this war you're not in a picnic you're in a war you're in a battle praise god hallelujah you have other saints i've caught on before they fought their way private moses prophet joseph all them healed of him by faith they pressed their way you ain't gonna sit down on the twist bent and sing about no rapture you have no rapture to go through sitting

then the bright church will mature come with the baby's stuff come up with the odds and the jealousy and the grudge and you're fighting this and fighting that you'll forget that foolishness what god

god has laid out for you tell the lord oh praise him [Applause] [Music] and the righteous will mature and the righteous shall be identification with her lord by means of the word and a head who will come to her is the mystery of godliness which indeed is christ and there's a false church with all cunning and diabolical power made up of political force physical force and demon of darkness you hear what they make up this force we fight in it make up of political force physical force demons of darkness will come against this true vang but the true vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that jesus did this you know i have books and i have tape sting the true van will do the very acts and works that jesus did oh glory there's a scriptural by the same works i do saint john 14 12 shall you do also the true bride oh glory so who is talking about where is that true bride that's not a core channel i'm talking about you come on now preach back to me somebody [Music] twenty percent say amen people looking wrong for who's the bride you're talking about it right if you it's not the bright we have to look for the bride again you know you see you looking at you i'm not looking at you i'm looking at what god promised i can't look at you oh glory to god if i look at you i get frightened but i'm looking for what god said and if god said they're going to be a brighter bride and trainer there has to be a bad intrinsic i don't care who god has to raise up i don't care who god have to change i don't care who gonna have to flip over oh glory to god the footstep of the righteous i ordered of the lord let's continue so praise do you believe that so watch the gospel trumpet the song of the trumpet and bible means get ready for scriptural war so anything come here trumpet begin to blow a scripture ago trumpet means political disturbance seals means religious statements religious disturbance a seal is the opening of messengers dropped what will happen when they step and see you start to unfold in illness in manifestation only time you talk about revelation inspiration and some thunders hanging inside oh glory to god hallelujah what will happen when the seventh seal begins to unfold in manifestation and the seventh house is under there for manifestation of the british revival for manifestation of another ephesians for manifestation of adopted sons is this war about to begin in earnest next year 2021 yeah number one we are nobody gets started we we were waiting for this hour oh god when the world reeling hallelujah hallelujah they're reeling under something they can't see something called a virus oh glory to god and then there's a bride that can't see oh glory to god because god had her covered up all along but god going to unveil this brain you're going to pull the rope off of her you you can't hide if you're the bride listen look in here look at me look look she here oh glory to god hallelujah you you see what god did to job you tell the devil say wait the have you considered my seven job how hope you're staying far from him like that he said i see other hedge around him all god's children have a hedge around them oh give the lord a shout come on now preach back to me for the angel of the lord and camp come on give me a shout [Applause] all god's children have a hedge around them why i think you're going to go so far no further i think you could do your own thing whatever i'll hedge around you that's enough time to come back home oh glory to god hallelujah and to fight this war and separate yourself from all unbelief everything that will hinder you from seeing him into the word of god you have to separate yourself from that isn't that right so he said god alone holds the key he said though has hid these things in the wise of prudent and revealed the babe such as would learn is not right because isaiah said in the spirit therefore the god of heaven has blinded your eyes you're doing like eve did accepting the intellectual side and know nothing of the spirit of god and all brother ulysses message brothers tremendously god tell eve and adam adam you can eat of all the trees that tree limits don't touch waiting satan do you get to come satan you know she said thank you lord for all these other trees hallelujah you have a million trees million fruit and that one tree that god said restrictions that would satan come and say why would he restrict you from that tree afterwards all the other trees look very unimportant all the other trees you get discontented it's true he said but god know that if you eat of this tree you shall be like god you shall have knowledge you shall know and all god wanted the heart is faith to trust because when you have faith you don't need the information when when joshua wanted to cross the jordan he needed a bridge he's a bridge across to jordan so from an intellectual standpoint you need an engineer you need somebody in the bridge building business but god does work in a different kind of a way god does wall up waters and make a way you you follow what i'm saying so sometimes god answer to what you're looking as a problem comes different from what your expectation is because you're using your head and not your heart that's why it's by faith moses by faith samson by faith all these people they're looking at the head they're looking at what god said oh give the lord a shout and i'm telling you what god said tonight he said upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell muster some pastor or some minister the case of hell must say some message pope the gates of hell shall not prevail against it when you fight with the devil who is man oh give the lord some praises come on now give me this give us some praises when you're doing battle with satan who's man man just fade away oh glory to god hallelujah my lord god alone holds the key and brother brown this is from christ's bishop god revealed he said he's never revealed this to you my father which is heaven upon this revelation here alone i'll build my church and the gates of hell will never prevail against it you see watch therefore there is no school no theologians theologians no teachings of the bible among any school that knows anything about it they cannot know nothing about it it is impossible for them to know anything about it god has hid the senses of knowing it from the very elected teachers it's a personal individual affair with the person that christ is revealed to them and if you said his reveal to me and then the life of christ produced in the bible that same life is in him doesn't produce itself and you you got the wrong revelation it's a question do you have divine revelation not understanding not to read something but have god spoke to you have you got revelation like peter i said upon this rock i built my church peter was a sinful man but he got revelation from god he didn't read it he was unlearned but something revealed to him that means god could drop revelation into illiterate you don't have to read and write and god could give you divine revelation and that revelation is the rock the devil can't take out the devil didn't put it he can't take it out he can't extract it out that rock is what caused those brothers to move how they move that rock is what called moses to reject egypt and all the money and all the women and all the throne and be identified with the mud doubles that rock is what help her that rock is make them walk amen wandering the wilderness and in caves and dents it was a revelation that they didn't belong here they were seeking a city whose maker and believer is god you're fighting to live and you're living to die what you're holding on to now oh give the lord some praises let me say it again you're fighting to live and you're living to die oh glory to god you know all these leaders and people they don't think the day is coming but the day of the lord is coming oh glory to god the day is coming hallelujah so what god is not known by education he is not known by how to explain it how to explain the mysteries how to break the histories how to include how to explain the prophet ministry how to explain the message that's not how god is known you say god is known by simplicity and the revelation of jesus christ in the most illiterate person simplicity and revelation oh glory to god so who could tell me i don't have a revelation you're nuts you're crazy you're you're what what what you you alter your head god reveals himself to whomsoever [Music] so you can be back 750 years walking here tonight and god gave you a divine revelation and people just sitting warming the church pew praise god praise god don't even know what's going on with you oh god that's why you can't write nobody off [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's why you can't put nobody in a concrete box you could imagine all the message words were going to treat saul anybody persecute the church god he finished shock that time paul is a messenger a stanley right and a god and don't know it yet you know just waiting for the pillar for to look him down you only read in schools and books on fallen theology and he's so anointed with what you read that he he willing to prosecute the church no revelation no anointing from god just what you read in books zeal pharisee and he going to a high horse going on there and god said time up when god look at the timer it was 20 21. oh glory to god he can he can continue no more than that he has to wrestle now put him on the arrest god sent on the purifier the enforcer that's what he messaged us yet know the enforcer we're talking talking will any enforcer come oh glory to god hallelujah or whatever you say the enforcer coming behind you become a dangerous man you become a dangerous woman when they stole the car and they came to budapest some poor family with the car coming to meetings and somebody's told the car and so on um i began to pray and send the holy ghost after that man dispatch the angel dispatch the holy ghost their vision broke and he saw the holy ghost coming upon the man conviction god know what's in that heart god could convict your son and bring him back tonight god could convict your daughter and bring him back tonight listen is god be talking about that man get convicted he stop the car get out the car run for his life oh you think god can send fire on the people glory to god give the lord some praises i think we give the devil too much credit [Applause] let me say that again i think we give the devil too much credit and we don't give the worship and priest unto god we ought to give they ever do this the devil do that never hindered me what are you fighting for praise god if there's a mountain you have to climb it you either go wrong it over it but nothing must stop you dear knight you must be pressing you have to fight if the pastor don't want to go past the pastor if the elder don't want to go past the elder praise god save dead bodies fall down walk over that body so they will say don't ten thousand fall on my right side i shall not be moved don't let nobody stumble you nobody must hinder you nobody was affected christianity that's foolishness that's your emotions i was devil trapped evil with her emotions she said i said get behind me satan waited my husband come back home but he gets into emotions and once you get into emotions you get messed up but once you get anchored with the word no emotion shaken you offer that you come here to praise god tonight because you know god is able to do more abundantly than you can ever ask or think but i have something to praise god gloria god amen exact praise god we have something to praise god about tonight kept us all these years call me when i was 17 years old i have something to praise god about oh god and hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he said watch by lack of this revelation is why we have so much divisions among us so much mockery so much divisions among us is because the people lack that revelation they lack the revelation the teachers very same teachers in this message lack revelation that would only have bunch of argument do revelation have to produce jesus christ when you come to equal sign up don't flip it so flip it so hot it's so boiling so bake it so at the end of it you have to see jesus if you can't love your brother afterwards what do you want if you're god you're going to love god you can't see and your brother right around your face you can't love him i ain't talking about who friendly to you you know you have to love the unlovable too that's all they predict because we were unlovable you know we were stinking written but god expresses love and send grace to us so if god had sent grace to you you have to know how to extend grace to others hallelujah praise god amen so the gates of hell he said watch babraham said the gates of hell would be against it but it could not prevail so there are things and forces against you but you have to understand tonight it can prevail either kevin was back sitting halfway back to know you by saying right now it can't reveal because god is not watching who backs it no way backstage we were all backstage we all born in sinnership inequity but our names was on the book that's why he called us oh glory to god here check your files and say oh god you think i should call god not asking the angel you think she's got he called you first put your name first then come down here and let you walk around satan's eden and satan feel you are one of his own oh glory to god but god put something inside of you and something inside of you is what pulling you that's when the word comes something pulling inside of you because you have to come and perform into the world image you bypass your theory to be tempted and tested you bypass your word body in order to come from thought to flesh to face what we're facing right now oh glory to god every man who claimed to be superman have to take a seat because the rhinovirus had them sitting down oh give the lord a praise offering they have no power they have been exposed all them lying prophets all them lying preachers all them lying teachers they are exposed but if william branham was in the earth [Music] different story altogether because everybody knew that was god called man god sent prophet but that prophet prophesied there will be another people in the land under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age oh glory to god hallelujah do you believe that tonight hallelujah praise be to jesus my lord thank you lord praise god so the church of the living god barramundi hear me is built not upon the experience of seminary or upon a bunch of men creeds it is built upon the spiritual revelation of god's word the spiritual revealed truth from god's word i can't give you revelation no man can it take the spirit to take the word that being spoken and reveal it to you and then that's the rock that the devil can't touch oh my hallelujah praise god so when king and evil was offered to worship both was sincere one was chosen the other one was condemned because one had listen the spiritual revelation of the will of god that's what they had oh my hallelujah oh my do you believe that so god vindicated one and god rejected the other one because and bhutan was in the same church both of them was worshiping but one had spiritual revelation this is past is important not of information but of the will of god because that is what faith is you're going to read it because once it's revealed to you it shows you what to do faith is not information to stick in your head and you talk it back faith have action to it when god tell noah listen flood come in you know what's the revelation build a ark on dry ground with no rain so the action of faith was displayed by noah doing something that looked almost crazy how that boat's supposed to float there's no water for it and more believe god that is what we're talking about that's what revelation is when abraham got revelation you have a son here just say our son don't talk to nobody you know because it will be old that's not how abram moved ibrahim said they get booty he must have to make crib abram getting doctor visit to see what his body feeling and whatnot the doctor said get out of the old man but abraham believed god not that doctor he said believe eric sarah sarah's wrinkle face but he believed god because god is faithful that promise oh glory to god i believe god tonight that something supernatural going to happen in your life to change your thinking because some of you you're thinking have to change [Music] you think defeat you'll lift defeat hallelujah take negative you live negative glory to god you take back sitting you live backstage you have to change your thinking that the gates of hell cannot prevail oh hallelujah change your thinking you're under covenant change your thinking oh glory to god you're on the covenant change your thinking why would god fight for people that was going to backslide and die in the wilderness a million two million people and god knew they was going to make it when they danced in the bank and they shouted and singing specials they wasn't going to make it because of unbelief because they believed 10 ministers who who paint the picture in your own mind that they are like grasshoppers nobody even painted for them they said in our own eyes we were as grasshoppers and shorty caleb he had to go and stand up on a box but he was a short man he stopped by the box and said we are able to take that land and people say look at shorty and all these ministers talking we can't take it a paradox god gets so fed up at them but they see god know that he had to keep his word right so he's waiting for them people to get pregnant and have the babies so to enforce the next generation we call them the joshua generation and i believe 2021 is the statin of the joshua generation the generation who don't know nothing about them crazies under moses or give the lord some praises it's a free generation them only going across with the holy ghost because that's what joshua is come on pray give me a shout now you know man you know holy ghost holy ghost oh glory to god we won't be long again hallelujah hallelujah but abraham said both these are in life worshiping the same god one who rejected the other receive and the only way the one that was received could have done anything different from his brother it was revealed to him could do anything different from his brother because it was revealed to him for the bible said by faith evil offered to god a more extreme sacrifice than of cain which god testified that he was righteous and jesus said blessed are dull something about jonah for flesh and blood has never revealed this to you my father which is in heaven has revealed it upon this rock i'll build my church what the true revelation of the word there is a true vine what is faith question answer faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you know it will be faith is a revelation of the will of god so when a man receives revelation nothing and nobody could dream of that thing that why joseph could tell when you see my bones i grew undead but my bones don't leave it here take it with you oh because i know resurrection coming in the promised land that is faith oh glory to god faith mother said even though lord lazarus dead and stinking even no he said i am the resurrection she not looking for apples and grapes she's looking for something to happen when lazarus is dead she's looking for resurrection promise he said i am the resurrection of life says look i know and he loves this he's already i ain't talking about that i am now oh glory to god i just need somebody to join our faith gear to activate this voice inside of me and when you say evil no lord oh glory to god he said where have you laid him for that that center next he mentioned all together because you're talking about a dead man that's thinking no you're saying i said wait what you gonna do now what you do with the dead man where have you laid him he said roll away the stone that is drama right now you're going from even no you're gone if you have not been here you're going to even know you have gone to where have you laid him you're going to roll away the stone and here come jesus oh every devil in hell surrounding him the devil was in charge of death all glory to god lazarus was dead soul traveling but when that voice oh glory to god the lord himself descends with a shout with a voice and that voice could be in the bride when he said lazarus comfort lazarus couldn't say no lazarus couldn't say i coming later lazarus can say i'm not coming now when that voice poke oh that your son coming back your daughter coming back have faith in god tonight all glory to god have faith you are going to be delivered if god bring lazarus on the dead what is cancer what is humor what is diabetes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my lord how much i could wrap up here hallelujah there's only two ways wrong way and right way god's way your way only two ways is only god and satan i know in between is that their life influenced by above or below isn't that right they've never found a better way for the chicken to get out of the eggshell than to pick his way out nature put that inside of that when the chick inside the egg read a certain stage he's got to bust some pips that hit the eggshell because god put it inside of there to pip you get out nobody here cracking if you crack it you kill it god put the pip inside the chicken to get all the eggshell what shell are you in tonight you have to pick your way out no pass there's shelling no shell over you oh glory to god this is not the every time this is mature sons and daughters of god time you have to fight for inheritance you have to fight for your land you have to fight for your portion nobody are pushing you into the kingdom the kingdom is preached and every man pressed their way into it or can we give the lord a shout in the house not to shake the pasta honey into it you press into it you come here to receive a kingdom a kingdom that cannot be moved because a shaken is coming that gonna shake this world earthquakes are coming disasters are coming and more blades coming wake up church but our bride is coming through a power is coming all glory to god signs and wonders coming too [Applause] [Music] almost finished that's the way with the christian church today it tried to accept some manufactured way instead of beating its way through to the kingdom of god so what preachers preach you're coming to the word and you know the mother you can fly over and you hear the eagles yeah you cry and you see yourself you see yourself one just like you that that's something real good but i'm not born again like intellectual gymnastics like all that flipping in your head you're assuming that peter had power you know he was given power shared power and he wasn't born again he wasn't filled with the holy ghost that jealousy and all kind of foolishness among the disciples until they hit the upper room and you're probably straight not all of them because fire come down and fire this bun fired a wet chain rice water that's water baptism fire is burned it's burned the snake out it has bun what in your system man can't take that out god had to take that out here you must woman think they could change your mind some of them married to change imagine if you mentioned that you want to change him and years later the man still he's a take got to change a man just pray for that man don't even think about it that you know what's inside that heart there you're watching face but you know what's happening you take father change you know oh glory to god god knows fire and people need you know they wanted that savior the ones that general they want somebody to master rome and god get on baby he said vision shall conceive and give him a little baby named jesus and he gonna conquer the entire world by the power of love with the power of god he's not going to do it himself he's going to empower disciples and say go and make disciples behold i send the power of my father upon you hallelujah in the city of jerusalem until you're improv god damn want you to be no repentant church member that would be preached here that'd be the catholic church house that you depend upon the priest that the priest and the priest i am no priest that kind of priest god wants you to be a powered son notice in the book of acts who was the leader in the book of acts who was in charge of the book of acts had no man in church it was the holy ghost in church holy ghostly philip holy ghost led paul holy ghost directed peter it was men led by give me your shout in the house not led by the church let by the holy ghost god wants you to be empowered son glory to god amen look a long time they had your old phone you had to stand up and put the coin you remember that young people no don't know about that at that point you can stop and wait for the post in front of you to move and your turns on your turns and does that go on now for the phone you have they could find you because they have chips there to identify almost where you are they wanted to find almost 10 meters between where you are they could find you yes they could call and find you and that is man man doing that what about god when god wants to find you oh give the lord a shout oh glory to god hallelujah man putting and phone to check you and find you wherever you go he can track you you can go back and see all the way around or where you went what country what places you go all of that that inside that that gps thing what about god gps so god wanted me to find you to send you out oh give the lord some praises hallelujah let me see if i can finish here hallelujah just 12 more minutes to the hour hallelujah are we in 2021 my god lord i thank you for 2020 oh glory to god i thank you for 2020 you know how it will be a glorious year a fighting year we did things we never did before hallelujah service through zoom we had prayer bible study we had prayer meeting oh god in the devil taught you keep us quiet when the devil thought he wanted to silence us we did something different we adapt we become flexible we are stiff church member we see the pillar of fire moving we're moving too oh can the lord shout oh glory to god hallelujah praise god amen [Applause] [Music] listen to this one there was no he said you tried to baby people try to manufacture some way oh there's no need of this and crying there's no need of this there's no need of dying unless there's a death there cannot be a birth birth only comes by substance of death let that warner we fall into the ground and die it's abided alone but if it erupts it gets into corruption and from that corruption springs fought new life no other way will work it must first corrupt and be corrupted and that's the way we must be die to ourselves and be born anew you know the no no better way for the baby to get what he wants than to cry it and as dr buzzwords used to say the baby that cry the loudest get the best of this and that's about the way it is and let that one get here and cry out like buddy robertson he stopped in the middle of the cornfield he tied up his mule he said lord if you don't give me the holy ghost when you come back you'll find a pile of bones laying right here i'm going to stay here till i get it and god gave the holy ghost to body robinson he says watch cry for what you have need of he wants you to cry out ten percent say amen you only pastor give you all right he wants you to cry out you know when god come nung when he tell moses he said [Music] i ain't heard the people saying amen you know i heard the cries of my people and i come long to deliver you want deliverance let him hear your cry god deliver me tonight god i need a breakthrough tonight hallelujah we shall come up please [Applause] peter he said cried he cried out he said i said lord save me and the eternal hand reach down and pick him up that's what the matter with the church we don't stay there long enough we don't cry out long enough we don't hold on to it if a little baby wants something it will kick and scream and turn red in the face amen all them with babies inside of here you know them babies are scary hallelujah haven't trained again for that milk my god you better hurry up you know because they're getting good they're going higher and higher and higher until they go to a fiery pitch he's a desperate here for that milk oh glory to god let's continue here cry for your needs that's god's provided way oh you mean another brother you're thinking preaching no i just read for you that is god's provided way didn't jesus explain when he said he unjust judged the woman that cried day and night how much more the heavenly father give them the spirit who cry out for it so the people in the message not cry for no spirit because he gave the holy ghost another ask him so one day they're going to wake up and say wait a minute we have all this weather no oil time to buy then the voice said go to them that sell in other words go now and pay the price because the bride will pay the price now by crying out for it hallelujah watch this is the part i want to get to cry until the promised word is vindicated then you got it oh all these years was to get the promised foot to you so now you are seated with promised wood time to cry hallelujah watch until then they got it you don't have to worry about normal with it you see the bible promise it then stay right there and crowd about it well that's the way we are supposed to do okay yeah almost there if a little baby sees a cookie and he wants it he just cry and cry and cry stick kick scream holler turn around in the face so listen if your baby is sticking screaming hollering nice whole babies as beers another christian baby you speak to reason cry i can't cry too long because my father goes to church that baby are working you know that's not built into the baby and once and may be sniffing you come back to watch the noise keep it quiet no baby just ball bring a baby right now just ball because it's a baby it warns something when you want something just bore you to cry out you say lord i want to break through i want a deliverance i want victory i want to be blessed this year materially spiritually financially every way possible that's how god want to bless you oh glory to god so hear this part that's the way god provided for his people god's provided way always is to take his word and hold on to it until it's vindicated to you do you follow me god a provided way is to hold on to the promise until it makes manifest to you now remember i'm on record just because you believe it's there that don't make it happen that's a big one how does it get to this just believe you believe it's dear that don't make it so it will happen so people in this message that don't mean you have a revival oh glory to god you've got to want a revival you've got to want your son deliverance you've got to want your daughter to deliver it you got to want it [Applause] you have got to come upon the basical promise and then upon your mental attitude towards it his word is always what he wants to see vindicated it will only be vindicated upon certain conditions and when you meet those conditions you will see people can take the word and they just make it live and others come right back with the same word and can do nothing oh my i'm gonna finish oh praise god i'm gonna be done no i had a god constructed boat oh my i went them through the boys you said abraham said they needed water and godzilla fought man in the fire the world needed our savior and god sent a baby to them oh my praise the name of the lord praise be to jesus hallelujah a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit scripture matthew 7 and neither can a corrupt tree being fought good fruit every tree bringeth forth not good fruit is tuned on and cast into the fire wherefore by their food you shall know them not every one of them that say unto me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he

from me work on iniquity therefore whosoever heard these sayings i'm closing could begin to pray something whosoever hear these sayings of mine and with them i will liken him onto a wise man who built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat up on the house and it fell not because it was founded upon a rock and everyone that hear it these scenes of mine and doing them not shall be likened to a foolish man which built his house upon the sun and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat up on the rock upon the house and great was the fall of it and it came to pass when jesus had entered these scenes the people were astonishing his doctrine for he taught them as one of an authority are not as described so friends in closing the houses were built and everybody shouted and rejoicing because the rings that come yet the storms can come here just think these storms come in and it will test what you built upon but jesus said somebody said jesus said jesus said upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall never prevail against it i want to wish every one of you all a more successful and blissful and healthy new year that i can wish to you god be with you may you grow both physically and spiritually and financially and materially everything that god could bring upon you i pray he will
