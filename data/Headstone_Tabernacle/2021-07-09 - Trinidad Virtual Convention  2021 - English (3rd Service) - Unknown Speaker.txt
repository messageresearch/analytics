praise god to get ready to come hallelujah god bless you amen and amen in jesus name amen amen says god bless you we bring you greetings in the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] so so we give we all give god praise we give more times for the invitation it's a great privilege to be invited to say something in this virtual conversation the inspiration for the convention is ephesians and ephesians is out of alignment and in 53 or 325 52 the prophet says at the end of it ephesians paul is addressing ephesians 1 directly straight to the shoulder to the church that's what he's doing this is not for babies this is for grown-ups not for babies so i want to use that a little inspiration for migrating here this afternoon directly straight to the shoulder not for babies so babies we are pumpers but [Music] in the beginning you say where were you when i had the foundation here you said good afternoons and talk to me like so paul is carrying a believer about ephesians 1 which talks about predestination before the foundation occurs so anytime you're going to foundation and predestination that is the right language and that is not for me a reason that uh you may know it intellectually when you commit a message but as you grow brother it becomes a more living reality and gives you the super faith and the super anointing to really handle situations like this part living and what is the community so the bride becomes a super racer super church as she nears the end soon this one in revelation of pre-destination before the foundation of the world and joe was called too good of himself good at his lawyers and much of goodyear who all said in the very feast of us we're good are we going to truth so looking into that direct straight to the shoulder the church brother we see that his shoulder there's a woman that comes in called in the bible in a picture with a bottle of water on her shoulder but abram has sent her away from him away from his house so she's going away from the promised land where ephesians is out of and enter she is going away from and look battle is for herself and her son she represents those in the message she has been there a long time she has a teenage son so that means she has she has had intimacy with abraham she knows the message and so on but it's not a message child she's carrying she's not invited so she is going away from but then there's another woman with a picture on her shoulder and whether she's coming [Applause] and the prophet says that he angel that was coming with eliezer entered for running his reach for the half hour before and he went to prepare rebecca's heart so that she know would make the right decision so you realize that when we talk about direct straight to the shoulder the shoulder cannot be an operation the shoulder is the strongest part of the body but the shoulder is ready when you release from the heart the sole [Applause] so you'll find that jesus when he went he left in 1909 and he went to see that lordship and they said i'm terrified so that shows love from her on terrifying and whatever that means he would go until even though he had an idea like that one meant something the last members comes in so when he got that last one when he got that last one he put it on his shoulder because uh his shoulder has struck his part everybody and came home rejoicing and called out his friends come and rejoice with me so the shoulder represents the abs right so you realize that that by the grace of god the shoulder represents in the heart not an intellectual faith but a faith that is brutally heard from a predestinated gene that you were recorded and that is why you are here now to express god and if he's happy so all the preaching we look we look at rebecca and her heart was prepared he probably said he came to us hooked up at a fair creator so with the pressure on her shoulder without this heart contact she would never give that old man that water but then she was prepared and the angel turned up terry well now when she goes anywhere the old man is there he made a request and brothers says you have to make up your mind who you're going to fellowship with so she decided the danger from the heart provider to have fellowship with his old mother that's how she end up swimming in the water so her bottle what her picture was to be put in service because eternal life is living forever it is a love gift whereas all works for herself and that perish all she ended up with is a natural will but uh [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so dwell between the shoulders when trustworthy is a lot of them in joshua 18 11. joshua says uh benjamin shall dwell between judah and joseph so judah joseph turned out to be his shoulders judah is the chief ruler and joseph is the one with the double person the genealogy not being reckoned after a good fight not return in the eyes so judah is a is [Applause] perfection before trump nation walking seven steps to perfection [Music] so it is between revelation and the other we live in their lives we have been was living at the end of it is attacked by the right that germany is in southern right now the brightest quarters have the right kind of world so ah what they see like so benjamin is delivered to dwell to dwell not to be just sometimes not to come and go and visit like a holiday but a dwell between judah and joseph so that is a revolution except uh when you look at the kenneth's in churches one the connects left and they were dwelling with judah and judah [Music] [Applause] came typing his squeeze and tribulation coming in that battle there in a judge's form brother yaya who is evan's wife who was a candidate was able to call him she wasn't afraid because judah goes forward [Applause] [Music] so she was dwelling with judah so turning their back on their father's nakedness and showing that from their heart they are turned away from immorality and pornography and they put the garbage on their shoulders so the shoulder come [Applause] so reference as i preach here in the name of the lord jesus christ the government is laid upon his shoulder and we put all our responsibility upon him and he has responsibility for us but until he put back your responsibility on his shoulder his shoulder representative right represents him so ministering reference jesus christ has put on us the responsibility of having perfection bringing perfection to the right of jesus that [Music] [Applause] lord jesus christ lord bless you and thanks for your little opportunity to say something to lift the name and lord jesus christ oh hallelujah glory to god do you appreciate that today glory to god hallelujah thank you amen hallelujah thank you lord oh

the tips together and all the specials that have been sung may the blessings of the living god be upon it amen and i trust that this convention be a great blessing to the people amen that our lives should not be the same but abraham said we keep saying it all the time but we're going to say it one time for the last time praise god so we'll keep repeating the promises we keep claiming the promises one time we'll see them the last time the god will not be here to see them will be caught up in the air to meet the lord in the air oh blessed be his mighty name so as we stand to our feet this morning shall we go straight to the world amen let's turn to the book of first peter chapter 4 romans 8 and ephesians 5. amen we want to salute all the visitors in our gates i want to welcome you in the name of the lord jesus christ and we should definitely shake your hands after service praise god so first peter 4 verse 12 he said beloved think it no strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened to you but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy if ye be reproached for the name of christ happy i.e for the spirit of glory and of god rested upon you and on their part it is evil spoke enough but on your part he is glorified but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evil doer as a or as a busy body in other men's matters yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed let him glorify god on this behalf praise god amen romans 8 15. for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father praise god for the spirit is a bearers witness with our spirit that we are children of god oh what a blessed world the spirit better witness with our spirit that we are children of god praise god and if children then ask as of god and join us with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be glorified also together for i reckon that the suffering of these present times are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall reveal in us praise god it's gonna be revealed in you now hallelujah for the endless expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god praise be the name of the lord in our last scripture reading is ephesians 5 verse 13 he said but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light and whatsoever the word make manifest is light wherefore he said awake thou that slippet and arise from the dead and christ shall give the light see then that he walks conspectfully not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what is the will what the will of the lord is praise god may the lord have a blessing to renew his word you may be seated this morning praise god so i want to take a title from what we have read amen because he's talking about something we should not fear trials we should not fear temptations praise god and we have not received the spirit of bondage to fear he's a special people now that this is talking to praise god amen but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father praise god amen oh you love him today hallelujah praise god so to this morning i want to take a title sons of the original word hallelujah sons of the original word we have not received the spirit of bondage to fear those sons they are born sons they are filled sons they are tried sons they've overcome the enemy they've overcome every trial that is put on their way because god gave them power to overcome and we have received a spirit of freedom a spirit of liberty because whosoever the son of man are set free is free indeed and we are free indeed today we are sons of the original world so what that word was in that ephesians church age we shall produce the same power we shall produce the same life we shall produce the same spirit oh blessed be the name of a living god hallelujah so we are sons of the original word and my subject is by me praise god buy me gold tried by fire because these sons must be tried they must be tested they must be proven praise god but peter said behold think it no strength containing those fiery trials brother they are going to come in double portion but we are standing by the dynamics of the holy spirit we are not afraid because we are called and tried by fire praise be the name of a living god amen and i want to take my inspiration with the inspiration of the meeting amen the dispensation of ephesians the bride's journey to perfection praise be the name of a living god amen amen we thank god for his grace so many couldn't see this day but god put us here for the papers not just to walk the world but to prove his word because ephesians is that proven seal of the bride whatever you might do you might speak with tongues you might jump and shout but you've got to come to ephesians where the love of god must be your heart it must be expressed by this will all men know that you are my disciples because the love of god is in you praise god amen the bible says that how can you say you love god that you don't see praise god you maybe see it you say you love god you don't see him praise god and yet you cannot love your brother you cannot love your sister no it does seem spirit that raised christ from the dead if that same spirit dwells in you is going to quicken your mortal body praise god it will quicken you to love it will quicken you to forgive it will kick you to hold on to the faith praise be the name of a living god amen so i certainly want to see what we can do by the grace of god on our part today amen and i certainly want to salute all the ministers that have gone before me those that are greeted and those that will greet and preach god richly bless you for your messages praise god amen now the inspiration of the convention is another disposition of ephesians and we are promised that there's going to be an official to this journey praise god every promise in the world belongs to the bride hallelujah every promise not one will fail when god told noah there's going to be a rain he instructed him to build the act hallelujah now the act was not the rain but the act was the evidence that was coming for the rain praise god and the promises today are evidence that there's going to be a bride there's going to be perfection there's going to be adoption that we shall be quickened oh blessed be the name of a living god so i don't care where you are being this morning i want to challenge your fate i want to stimulate you today to know that you are sons of the original word praise god peter had an attitude peter had a nature peter had a spirit upon him but jesus said when there are convicted strengthen the brethren peter said come on now do you doubt my faith lord you know i love you i will go with you to the death but jesus said strengthen thou the brethren when thou are converted praise god and jesus said before the cockroach you will determine three times that was believing peter that was check member peter praise god that was a disciple peter praise be the name of a living god but when peter received that spirit when he received that efficient experience when the baptism of the holy ghost caught ahold of peter peter became a new man he stood on the day of pentacles he said this is that this is that that was spoken by the prophet joel they had their ephesians hallelujah and the church was born on that day on the day of pentacles they received another spirit not a spirit of bondage to fear but a spirit of power or spirit of power where they could proclaim the word they could speak the word oh without fear without favor all glory be to the living god sons were born back to the original word sons were born back to the original faith praise god they were not afraid and we are not going to be afraid as long as noah saw the ark he knew the rain was coming the act was a testament that rain was going to fall that god had spoken the act was evidence that noah was already saved and the word of promise is evidence that is coming for the pride that's coming for the pride our pride to perfection our pride to adoption as long as the promise is there there's gonna be a rapture there's gonna be a perfection there's gonna be a pride without spot or wrinkle i don't care where you are paying i don't care what the devil has brought upon you you are under a promise oh hallelujah hallelujah and no devil out of torment can stop the bride we are predestinated not according to our will but according to the will of the father and all those who knew all those he knew he called all those he called it justified all those he justified he was already sanctified he's already glorified he's already perfected by his spirit oh i feel good this morning the shot of the king is in the camp the devil lost the bottom the fire the holy spirit is here you can receive your promise you can receive your feeling you can receive your healing we are sons of the original word the spirit is here today we have not received a spirit of bondage to fear i don't care what the devil has put on your trail the word of god is here to break it jesus break every shackle he breaks every feta i don't care what your problem i don't care what the devil is used to bind you this morning the jubilee trumpet of officials are sounded you can go free this morning the jubilee trumpet is sounding freedom praise be the name of the living god oh you maybe see that today hallelujah we are under a promise and heaven and ever pass away but the word of promise will never pass away praise god oh glory to god amen praise god we are not praised god we are not going to be cowed praise god we receive a spirit and when peter received that spirit he was no longer afraid he stepped out of the upper room by the gate called beautiful here was that layman laying there praise god peter said silva and gold i don't have pray what i have is not of this world not the riches of this world not the case of this world they will all perish brought up hallelujah oh but i received something such as i have the holy ghost itself such as i have i give unto you that was a son of the original word the word was in him the word was not just the letter but it was power praise god is spoken such as i have i have the word in me the dynamics of the holy spirit rise up and walk and that lame man rose up and walked he didn't sit back there because power was speaking to demon powers the physical eye saw him as a crippled man but in the spirit realm it was demon powers so the power the holy spirit spoke back there is signing the original word spoke back like adam spoke back like jesus christ oh and you are going to speak like that today because we are promised another ephesians oh pleasing praising oh hallelujah and i love ephesians ephesians is the proven seal hallelujah if you are not in the spirit you can't come to ephesians hallelujah or if you are not bad by the baptism of the holy ghost itself you can't come to ephesians because ephesians is the same spirit ephesians is the father working through the sun oh hallelujah the sun can do nothing but what he sees the father do so doing the sun likewise so ephesians is heavenly places it is time to get to heavenly places because the pride is promised heavenly places and we are in another disposition of ephesians where we look we walk not after the flesh but after the spirit praise god so is the time the church members are going to be fleshed out this is only the time for the pride the time for the seed the seed must come alive the seed must produce the power must produce the life must produce the spirit must produce the nature of the seed oh glory be to the living god so it is time to pick faith in the word whatever has been promised belongs to me the holy ghost is your promise perfection is your promise hallelujah and sons are here to prove that praise be the name of the living god hallelujah hey amen so we want to be adopted we want to be placed we want to be positionally put in our body in the body in our place in the body praise god that we can do the greater works that we can become sons of god because as many as are led by the spirit they are the sons of god so we've got to prove that seal now because ephesians tells you that nature is groaning i mean romance tells you that nature is grown in for the endless expectation of the creature waited they are waiting now praise god for the manifestation for you to come to another ephesians for you to come to your proven seal where there's gonna be one faith where there's gonna be one love where there will be one father of all praise god hallelujah by one spirit we can all be baptized into the body praise god where every joint supply that is being supplied is working to the effectual working of the body of christ there will not be jealousy they will not be envy they will not be about biting don't know but evil surmising they will not be hatred but there will be one love one joy and when we come together then we can see the spirit of god moving among us hallelujah hallelujah oh we are here we have arrived at that time where the spirit itself must bear witness with our spirit that we are the sons of the living god hallelujah oh you may be seated praise god abraham said here and i'm going to read a few quotes before i go on abraham said in the fourth seal hallelujah he said the battle started in heaven we are in a battle hallelujah and this battle didn't start here i didn't start the battle praise god but i'm a soldier recruited to fight in the battle so don't tell me to stop fighting because i must find my place i must get my inheritance i must possess what belongs to me praise god amen and i've been given the weapon to fight and that weapon is the word and the spirit comes to quicken that word give you power to fight so that word that is start on the earth is parted in heaven but there's a good news for you now it will be finished on the earth praise god the war will be finished on the earth hallelujah so those of you that don't want to fight brother you better fight hallelujah is a battle is a war husbands you've got to love your wives that's your battle to fight that is a vision to find your place you've got to fight to love your wives oh hallelujah do you hear me now oh preach me some mystery you've got to love your wives husbands you've got to love your wife that is what a vision says to do husbands love your wife even as christ loved the church you've got to find your place is a battle you must win to overcome oh am i talking to somebody today are you catching the mystery of his will today you've got to fight because that was started in heaven but it will finish on the earth hallelujah oh and my wife is this fight hallelujah and my wife is like that you've got to fight because you have to fight to overcome hallelujah he that overcome it praise god oh how do you fight love your wives oh hallelujah find the glory hallelujah oh glory be to the living god the battle started in heaven it will be finished on the earth in the form of the armageddon now let us watch and see it unfold let us watch and see it unfold but you and i know that we will not be here brother we shall be changed in a moment and a twinkle of an eye but in ephesians we've got to fight hallelujah in order to be placed i'm going to be placed as a husband in my home i've got to fight praise god in order to overcome wives love wives reverence your husband you've got to fight now that's televisions now children obey your parents and if you want to be placed you've got to obey your appearance you got to be pleased you've got to love your wife you want to be placed you've got to reverence your husbands praise god then the spirit will be pleased [Music] to walk with you hallelujah so the prophet said now let's watch it let's watch and see unfold he said the mystery rider watch what he does now opposed refuse to repent and go back to the original blood world the world became blood and fleshy he refused to go back to it is the antichrist the true red bride he is opposed to the two where pride so that antichrist spirit is opposed to the true word pride hallelujah oh glory be to the living god he is opposed to the true wet bride takes his own bride so this devil takes his own bride and this bride supposedly bride is still in church are you following me now but we are coming to the ephesians where the spirit will be there to prove our character praise god because adoption is not faith believing the word adoption is your character the holy spirit reporting to the father about how you are behaving how you are responding to the instruction of the father praise god that is what places you your character your conduct and behavior places you as a son when he praise god of adoption are you with me now praise god he takes his own pride and brings hair to him in a form of religion called creed and dogma that's why we have to come to ephesians because in corinthians though i speak with tons of men and of angels that is in church now and have no charity nothing praise god do i give my body to be my my body to be pain do i feed the poor without charity nothing we are looking for efficiency where the world will be in the pride and the pride will know what to do with that word and no man will let that pride do otherwise because she's established like that ephesians church she's established word of his word spirit of his spirit praise god hallelujah and he takes his own bride and brings her to him in the form of religion called chris and dogma now seeing the holy bride he is against her he forms his own bride called antichrist by antichrist teaching which is contrary to christ hallelujah which is contrary to christ that is why in ephesians 4 11 is that he gave some apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists for what for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ outside of that you can't wait for the ministry outside of that you cannot edify the body outside of that you cannot bring the pride to perfection he didn't say he gave some to play tapes praise god i've still got ministers on the earth to preach the word if they will hear they will hear them but it's got to come from the prophet's prophecy praise god back to ephesians again oh hallelujah and now praise god amen which is contrary to christ he how he how should he is and now instead of having a unity of love controlling worship under the blood he's got a denomination instead of having the word he took creeds dogmas and so forth hallelujah but thank god for the original word and there's an original bride sons of the original word to respond to that word that would be the pride of jesus christ for this day fulfilling every scripture that is written praise god hallelujah oh i love the word man amen amen the resurrection of lazarus he says them theories don't change god's word so your idea of the word don't change the word it's gonna rain in noah's day they laughed at him because the geology said it will never happen the rock formations don't look like they can even do anything to attract rain praise god and all the scientists of that day disproved it but they are curious but your theory don't change god's word the word said there's going to be another efficiency to this journey that is thus save the lord so you've got to look for that efficiency you've got to look for your place you've got to be in love you better be in heavenly places you better know that you know that you know that you are predestinated unto adoption because that's what the word says praise god them theories don't change god's word no sir god's word is eternally true and it is right our faith is based on there i am not saved because i got down at the altar and cried i am saved because the word of god tells me so the word tells me so and when i go to ephesians 2 is that a you had he quickened who were dead in sin and trespasses hallelujah there was no hope for me but thank god for the original word he had quickened me i was dead in sin i was dead in trespasses but he has quickened me onto life because one man brought sin to me but one man took away sin from me and brings me into the perfect fellowship of himself which is christ jesus himself he said wearing ye in time past work according to the course of this world according to the priests of the power of the heir the spirit are now working in children of the disobedient praise god among whom also we all had our conversation in time past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of this flesh praise god and of the mind and we're by nature children of rock even as others but god not your pastor not your church not the system but god who is rich in mercy praise god so it is not by your own righteousness that any man should pose but god who is rich in mercy for this great love wearing he has loved us even when we're dead in sin has quickened us together praise god they are squeaking us together oh glory be to the living god that's why we are baptized by one body by one spirit into one body while christ picking us together praise god so when i travel to lagos i is in same spirit i travel to ivory coast the same spirit prana we don't look funny we are hooked into heavenly places because we are in ephesians again the dispensation of ephesians is here oh hallelujah god that is reaching mercy for his great love wherein he loved us even when we were dead in sins praise god so don't tell me i can shout don't tell me i cannot praise don't tell me i cannot rejoice don't tell me i cannot be on fire because i know i overcome the wicked one that's why when i come to church i get on fire when i come to the presence i am in heavenly places i've got to praise him i've got to worship him because i've escaped the antichrist spirit oh give him praise give him praise hallelujah praise be the name of the living god and us raised us up together and made us to see together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in ages to come which is now he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith praise god that is why i rejoice i didn't save myself hallelujah and you did this yesterday thank god christ died quicken me from sin praise god to sit in heavenly places that is why i cannot hold my peace i've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb shown that my name is in the book predestinated brother and i've got a testimony now i'm a son of the original word oh glory be to the name of the living god amen hallelujah so i am not safe because i got down at the altar i'm saying because ephesians 2 tells me so praise god you got to speak back to the devil anytime he brings you a mind battle let him know that you are a son of the original world heaven and head will pass away but that word will never never never pass away praise god you shall be adopted that is a short word of prophecy you shall be sealed that's a short word of prophecy you shall be perfect that is a short word of prophecy cannot fail praise god alleluia amen you maybe see that praise god hallelujah see he said i'm sick because the word of god tells me i am saved satan can whip me around anywhere on how you feel praise god the devil cannot whip you around when you know who you are is god so satan cannot whip me around anywhere on how you feel i believe it because god said so and i accept him upon the basis of his word that is how i was saved i believe it and confess it then it works the results the first thing i am saying because god goes with teaches i am saved that is how you are saved if you are saved satan can whip you on your ideas and things but he can go around on the word of god jesus said it is written and that settles it and it is written in the scripture hallelujah it is written where in the scripture and the scripture is written for what our learning that by the scriptures we might find comfort in the scriptures to believe the word that whatever promise is in there belongs to me the devil can't beat me around the devil can't kick me around praise god my name is written there praise god oh you believe that hallelujah praise god now why must god look for you why must the spirit of god work in you because the brother said that he is filled in a man god you cannot see god but god manifests himself every day this word is written it cannot speak it needs a body to speak true praise god so he is filled in a man so if god is building you god is what god is love and if god is love and he's building you you must be what love so the world want to see god they've got to see you they want to see love they've got to see love in you praise god hallelujah but how do you express the love there's got to be a situation circumstance created for that love to project itself hallelujah the love of god must project out of you for the world to see that truly this is the love of god are you following me this morning oh glory be to the living god so he is built in a man and today we know that he is filled in the pride where do i find this god in the scripture second peter 128 that is where his bail oh glory to the living god where there's a living faith a living victory a living knowledge and living temperance and living patience a living godliness a living broadly kindness a living charity that's where he is real oh glory to god he is building a man and always was real but he was filled unto them but he was in a human temple god was in a human temple now be real careful listen now the prophet now be real careful now he's the same yesterday today and forever see god veiled hiding himself from the well filled in human being huh not just preachers now he's failing the key bodies he's building the guitarist he's building the deacon he's failed in the technician he's filled in the worship path [Applause] praise god so this god that is veiled must be made manifest praise god hallelujah so the prophet be real careful now he's the same yesterday today and forever see god failed hiding himself from the world filled in human beings he here was god those greeks saying we would see him and jesus said a corner of wheat has to fall and die we don't see the power of god because we are too alive praise god when the word comes forth instead of dying we are too alive [Music] preach me a good sermon but he said the word is also for rebuke it's for correction it's for exaltation it's all the word praise god so when the spirit has need for the church he speaks through the local elder that is god speaking because he's always failed and this is the dispensation of ephesians where the manifestation of god must be unveiled before the people praise god so the prophet be real careful now because he's the same yesterday today and forever oh are you with me today is that those like those disciples they couldn't explain about eating his body and drinking in his blood see but they had done died to those things they were dead to a principle they were dead to christ no matter what it is or how might defeat light look like he had they still believed it anyhow see they could see it in that man a man that eat drunk and fish slap everything else was born on the head walk with them talk with them wore clothes like the rest of them but that was god and the world be looking at a bunch of people praise god hallelujah that the world knows nothing about but that is god walking on the earth let me say something that would choke you he said man is omnipotent praise god hallelujah it's not your flesh now but there's a seed gemini man some seed jamming some sons and sisters on daughters that came from god and they are going back to god oh you say but why am i suffering why am i going through trials and temptations because you bypass your giovanni praise god in order to be tried in order to be tempted in order to be proven that you come from the original world or you came from god so you overcome praise god how do you overcome by the word you overcome by the word jesus come by his power he overcame by the word it is written it is written it is written satan it is written today we've got to overcome so paul said praise god [Music] think it's not strange because god is building you he must be expressing you hallelujah so we are not careful we are not wondering we are not waking up surprise why are these trials why are these false doctrines flying all over the place we are not shaken because we are built upon the doctrine of the apostles and the prophets our foundation standards sure we are not as children toast to and fro by any wind of doctrine but we are established upon the foundation of the word of the living god we know who we are we are sons of the original word oh by me of gold tried by fire oh not try by water but try by fire oh we want to see our reflection in the image we want to see our image is reflected in the image of christ we walk the images of christ on the earth reflecting faith all the way to charity praise be the name of the living god so we are not ashamed of the reproach we better reproach anyhow because god is unveiling himself praise god in some two sons some born sons some filled sons oh hallelujah one of these days they are going to look for those sons they will not see them because they risen to their body change hallelujah and we shall be caught up to be the lord in the air it wouldn't be long bride oh praise god hallelujah praise god hallelujah the prophet season the seed is not aired with a shock is that god vindicates it to be true sure it is fulfilling this age when the seven seals or just proving that the denomination has just been carriers that's another one of the father's business to prove the denominations have been carriers is one of the father's business to prove that they are not the original seed they were just carriers but the father has to prove that huh and they had to die out for the life to come back into the original psalms are you with me today praise god if that's just another one of the father's business to prove that's the father's business now is to show that you that then denominations is not his do you understand is to show you that their denomination is not his they are man-made systems that deny the word of god so everything that the prophet revealed about that pride you better grab it [Music] so when he says that the true church will be the continuation of another book of acts you better grab it go back in there and see what the spirit used them to do you better get into that spirit because anything outside that he said is the antichrist spirit coming into the church to defile the church oh come on now by making it lukewarm by making it former by making it praise god dead praise god but by me of god try by fire when you come here your character must reflect the world and fishes must be on display oh then we will know that the spirit that raised christ from the dead is dwelling in you and is quickly your mortal body it quickens you to praise it quickens you to worship it quickens you not to be dead oh come on now come on now if i walk into a message check i must be identified i must be identified because the spirit that is ruling that church proves to me that they are in heavenly places [Applause] praise god hallelujah i feel good this morning oh hallelujah we must rock you by the word we have no other thing to teach but the word the prophet said a change that is that has no noise there's no god you better get on fire it is not the preacher wanting fire you are identifying your seed that you are of the original word you know the preachers are not lecturers we don't come to lecture you will come to put fire on the word to quicken that word to you praise god oh an emotionless religion is the powerless religion represent a religion that has no emotion needs to be buried i'm not saying come and act religion but let the spirit quicken your mortal body into praise into worship into saying amen to the world into a revival because we have come to the revival of the just praise god hallelujah it is his business to prove that them denominations are dead it is his business to prove that the mr churches that reject the head part hallelujah oh glory be to the living god are dead praise god you've got to accept the full word all of the word or none of the word oh glory to god amen the first son was a spoken word seed of god he was given a pride how the problem says i'm just reviewing the spirit is not picking up what i said see to produce himself she fell the bread was given to produce himself again another son of god but she fell by high breathing like some people say when you call the prophet you are what literature reviewing that's intellectuality that's blaspheming the holy spirit because we cannot feed on nothing else but the revealed word for our day the world is the blood for your day this is a closed book it takes the prophet's message to open up this book outside of the prophet's message is a closed book no wonder they say the seals are not open because they reject the head part of it oh come on now let me not get there praise god hallelujah but there's a pride on the earth the pride was given to produce him himself again another son of god but she fell by hybrid and she produced himself but she fell caused him to die the second son is spoken seed word of god was given a brand like adam but before he could marry her she fell she had fallen also for she was put to a free moral agency like adam's wife was and to believe god's word and leave or doubt it and die are you following me now but from a little group of the true seed of the world god will present christ a beloved bride a virgin a vision of his word and through them and by them through these sons and by the sons of the original word or through them and by them will be fulfilled all that was promised for the his word in the virgin who knows no man made credo dogma the word of promise in himself like it was in mary god himself made manifest he will act himself he will act himself he will act in worship he will act in praise he will act in believing he will acting loving he will act in forgiving he will add the word hallelujah hallelujah sons of the original word when the trials come you will stand there as a son you will forgive us the son because you are being tried by fire oh glory to god a man that the character of himself will be produced when they hang them to the cross they knelt the nails into his hand they pierced his side he said father forgive them forgive them for they know not what they do he just didn't say them he meant them and those words went to fulfill the purpose for which they were spoken they were truly forgiving because jesus requested father forgive them that the scripture might be fulfilled he had to be nailed to the cross somebody had to do it somebody was predestinated to nail that nail there to pierce his hand there but he stood there father forgive them think it not strange and the pastor is against me lord help me to hold on and the brothers don't like me and this church is not something that has all kinds of things that are like stand still and believe the word oh god is proving you he is trying you he's testing you to prove your seed [Applause] praise god hallelujah oh they know no man with creed the promise the word of promise in himself like it was in mary god himself made manifest he will act himself by his own word of promise so to fulfill all that is written of him as he did when he came from the virgin womb type of merry womb now so will the virgin now accepting his word beat unto me as thou has said though it was said by an angel while it was just written in the word in isaiah 9 6 they will love him who those in the bride those original sons of the word they will love him to trust in jesus not to trust in your church not a trust in your family but to trust in jesus the word they will love him sons of the original world will love him they will love his so you cannot love him and hate me you gotta love me first they will love him they will love his come on husbands love your wife shame on you you can be angry with your wife for weeks you won't talk to him that's not the son of god that's not the spirit of god hit the altar and ask for salvation has to be retained praise god husbands love your wife they will love him they will love his huh for he is their head they are his subject subject to his head headship of christ is his [Applause] come on ephesians bright hallelujah and what would that produce when the head and the body are together it produces a harmony the oneness of christ and his church jesus never did anything until he see the father the father showed him first harmony between god and christ see john 5 19 so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her she receives it by just hearing the quote but you receive it you hear it you recognize it you hear it and you act upon the world so create that atmosphere of love create that atmosphere of joy create the atmosphere of peace in your home in your church [Music] all those groupies all those sectarian groupies in the church break them down because by one spirit are we baptized into one body if the bride gets to know who she is the rapture will be gone praise god notice christ never did anything so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again come on now and the seed of the world has been planted in the original sons of the world nothing can take that seed away from you you will produce the life of jesus christ you will produce the power of jesus christ hallelujah oh he raised up again the prophet said here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word so she does it in his name she has does serve the lord then it is dramatized so the holy spirit waters it until it is grown and serves his purpose so you are here to serve the purpose of god and the prophet said in expressions he said anything that said the purpose of god has a resurrection in the dry season they put fire in the fields bend all the grass but let the rain come you see the seed growing up again why they said the purpose of god so they've got to resurrect no matter the fire that comes to bend them [Music] so the weeds go through fire and you don't want to go through fire you want to sit in an easy bed of roads because you are brothers so no come on now thinking no strange your body no strange all his wealth all his family but job was standing there the lord given the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord church hallelujah oh let me wind down praise god brabham said amen the holy spirit what is it what is you every day the holy spirit is pouring on you watering your seed why to bring you up hallelujah until you are grown and then you serve your purpose this virus has come to try some people to test your love for god oh there's lockdown we can't go to church how are you saving your god now you're put on trial now how are you serving god in the midst of the pandemic are you at ease in zion do you go fishing like peter oh come on now you know better to go fishing you know better to stay in the world read the word be on fire in your homes why you have been put there as a testimony that you are not going to be like eve crazy oh hallelujah oh so we have come now to maturity now they do only his will the bride sons of the original will do only his will amen i believe that no one can persuade them otherwise no lockdown can persuade you from standing and believing the word of promise hallelujah praise god oh no lack of fellowship will stop you no doctrines flying around can stop you no one who can persuade them different they have thus saved the lord or they keep still then they do the works of god for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did not complete it in his days so you are here now to fulfill the word oh don't let the devil stop you don't let circumstances stop you you might lose your job that doesn't stop the word of the living god the conditions of this world will not stop the word of the living god but realize that you have a purpose to fulfill your purpose is to fulfill the word for your day praise god you are part of the body you have a function to perform hallelujah if yours is to clap your hands clap your hands if yours is to play the tambourine play the tambourine do it with all your strength do with all your might if your word is to preach the gospel preaching without fear or favor don't care who stays who goes stand there and preach that word oh because your faith is being tried even as you preach the word yours is to sit there and believe it but leave it with all your heart oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah oh yes sir brother abraham says in the london church age he said yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is his own mouthpiece so god is turning her on praise god that's why god bypassed the church picked up individuals to his name that can take the word like shadrach meshach and abednego god can take the word like joshua standing there praise god ask for me and my house in this pandemic we will save the lord i will not be dead because there's an antichrist spirit flowing in to defile the church but i will not be defiled by that lukewarm spirit by that dead spirit but a powerless spirit i will not be conquered so god is standing here on he will confound her through the prophet and the bride oh come on sons of the promised world sons of the original word god will use you to confound the world hallelujah yes it is for it says in the last chapter of revelation 17 the spirit and the bright sea come once more the world will hear direct from god as a pentecost but of course that wet bride will be repudiated as it is in the first age so that efficient church age they were a little bitty tiny minority but there were all kinds of false prophets flying all over the place all kinds of false doctrines flying over the place but they stood there and they checked the dog trees by the word and when those apostles got among them they found them to be liars and they stood on the weather and declared it to be so that is why the prophet said praise god this pride will be like the first church age will be like that ephesians church will build another christian church they were there with signs wonders and miracles they were established on the world they forsook the world 13 year olds were shaking this world under the impact of the holy spirit and we have promised another efficiency that mysteries are being unfolded the seven seals has been broken balakai 4 was sent to tie up ever loose and hidden in the world now we have no excuse the holy ghost has been released to the church the spirit of adoption was declared released to the pride we've got to come to that perfection we've got to come to that adoption but we can all come to it just by knowledge of the world we've got to come to it by the spirit we must be tried by the spirit we must be proven by the spirit the spirit itself must bear witness with our spirit that we have believed the faith that we are holding on to the word of malachi 4 praise be the name of the living god the spirit itself today must vindicate the pride hallelujah oh bless said be the name of a living god oh you love him today oh hallelujah hey amen oh glory glory glory glory hallelujah brother brown said my brother my sister today we are trying to make denominations that ephesians church at ephesus it wasn't a big church it was twice this church is twice in size or more 13 people i guess there were not many they were not up to 20 people but they believed the world they took god's word as it was written when paul heard about them praise god oh paul was so shaken about their faith i couldn't wait to be among them not like the romans every spirit that is on the head has existed before so let us go back to the world because it is written for our learning [Music] those corinthians that will come to show off i got a new tie i got a new suit i got a new dress i got a new shoe that's not why we come to church i got a new car they don't see you in church the day you release a new message is e-class that day you are first to be in church shining your car that's not why we have come that cannot be vindicated that can be manifested that cannot be displayed to the world because the world has more than you have [Music] praise god is that my brother sister today we are trying to make the nominations we are trying to build new churches we are trying to organize people educate them it's all in vain until we come back to the original world that the spirit can bear witness with our spirit that we are sons of god is all in vain until the love of god comes in you want to speak with pants you want to be like the corinthians you want to clap your hands you want to jump you want to dance you want to do certain things to make yourself a christian you will never be you will never be until the love of god takes over in your heart tears down that middle part out makes you feel for your brother that will make you act like a man like a child of god and put christ in you the hope of glory until the chat comes to that she is still a total failure and will always be praise god except the corn of wheat falls to the ground and dies it abides alone praise god hallelujah oh glory to god amen hallelujah let me close our praise god are you ready to die out the only way you can prove this god the only way you can come and manifest another ephesians is for him to express himself so it means that you must get out of the way and let him express himself and then when he came to a place of the coming age the father seen that the sun had progressed so you must progress the child cannot just be at one place they had to come out of egypt there was a racy but they were marching there because that was the route to progress they faced that red sea didn't care the fiery trials that were there praise god there were some chicken believers there moses having brought us here to die and then see praise god but moses says stance tale and see the salvation of your god and i say today stand still and see the salvation there's got to be another efficiency to this prize journey stand still and this is not going right for me everything is going wrong stand still it is god that is riding the ship he is selling the ship oh he's going to roll that boat ashore the river may be deep the river may be wide hallelujah but there is honey on the other side come on now glory to god amen hallelujah and the father seen that the son had progressed and he was where he was a wedding boy everything he did was right and right up with his father's business you've got to be about the father's business when you progress huh he wanted everything just right for the father he had no selfish motives i'm dressing to cut the eye of a sister in the church you have no selfish motive you are dressing as the son of god no selfish motives then the father taking their son out to a public place huh and the father taking the very son that was born in his family and adopted his own son that is what ephesians said we are adopted predestinated to adoption by sons by christ now that son in other words he adopted him and by this by this may he he place his son traditionally by this he placed his son positionally how did he do it then that son's name on the check was as good as the father's because he was in position the father had vindicated that that place that that had placed that sun in position and i hope you are getting it now then that son was heir to what the father had [Applause] that's why peter stepped out there silver and gold i don't have but such as i have i give to you such as that the father had he gave me lazarus come forth that's what jesus had praise god your daughter sleeping praise god they were they were crying but jesus said she's sleeping and he rose there praise god hallelujah the man was blind jesus he took sun spit him packed his eyes he was his soul he said you broke the law on the summer day you did this hallelujah that is a devil the man said whether he be a devil or not praise god i got a testimony once i was blind now i can sing praise god and we have a testimony once we're dead in sin and trespasses he walking us quicken us brought us to the saving grace of god to bring us to ephesians the placing of our bodies praise god in the body of christ for his manifestation oh my my you are up to everything so we can you can ask what you will this is the season to stick the word and speak that word praise god we have testimonies of his healing power amen he's delivering power he's restoring power why sons of god are speaking praise god oh the devil can tell us otherwise now he is with us he is with the bride and we know what to do with the world the devil can no longer toss us to and fro praise god oh you believe that oh hallelujah oh now god has many places he could please you huh god has many places he could place you some are apostles that's god's place some are prophets some are teachers some are evangelists and pastors and so forth some are song leaders [Music] [Applause] so the spirit must adopt you in your position now when you stand there to minister in songs he directs you by the word by exaltation by this by the written by the temple of the song then it begins to heal somebody deliver somebody quicker somebody so you've got to be anointed in your place heavenly places praise god oh god are so many places to please you oh god positionally pleases this son now god didn't ask men to do anything i hear it you are not asked to do anything for your pleasing only belief and let your character in contact reflect the breath hallelujah god didn't ask men to do anything that he didn't do himself so he goes up the mountain taking a witness of the earth and the witness of heaven and he took his own beloved son and stood out to them before the witness of the end and the witnesses of heaven and glorified him and the remnants shine like the sun that is where god is trying to get his church including praise god there is where he wants to get you into ephesians that is where god is trying to get his church just to say to this mountain be moved god is getting you to say to this mountain people shouldn't die of cancer and diabetes no longer god is getting you to speak to this [Music] mountain praise god oh hallelujah just to say to this mountain be moved and it will move authority sons of god you have the authority don't be waiting for breaking news there is not a government breaking news to this efficient journey praise god because he called you he called you he called you for a purpose to manifest the world i'm waiting to hear it break out here no sir that is not what i am promised creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god your manifestation my manifestation praise god be moved and it will be done it will move authority sons of god the whole creation is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god waiting to export to where the sickness will be arise sickness will be arise like peter or son of the original word arise silver and gold i don't know about what i have i give to you in the name of jesus christ pick up arise get up and walk get up and be healed get up and be filled while peter yes speak the word the holy spirit came down and filled the people praise god oh that is where we are now where sickness will be arise and it will be that way the blind received their sight the death and dump we pray for them now but then which is now you will command them don't say these things shall follow them that believe did i pray for the sake he said they shall cast out devil not i will but they which is talking about you that sons of the promised provided word of god for this day sons of that original word today you will speak to this mountain [Applause] and it will move if you say to this mountain not if i say if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart what we need is adoption we talk about adoption is like it's some big thing no it's sons and daughters in their place what we need is adoption too many sick people among us they need to be healed and you must speak to them you must cast out those demons out of them what we need is adoption are you with me now sons and daughters need adoption how many want adoption everybody wants adoption okay let's find out i'm done but how can the church we need adoption for the sick to be healed we need an option for the power to be set free we need adoption for power to come into the church but how can the church the pentecostal church the methodist church the baptist church and the message changed i'm putting that one right now and the message church be adopted until they come to discipline not mystery if it was mystery the corinthian church would have been adopted was just to be justified the roman church would have been perfected by justification praise god but it had to wait till ephesians where god had to place the body in his position but the problem said how can we come to that adoption that we need praise god hey until we come to what discipline the pastor will preach all his heart out by the word i won't act upon the prayer yeah you want adoption young people will not surrender to the word fully and be sanctified and yet you want adoption when the trials come in school they are coming to try you blessed is he that one over comment when those slick jesse bells come your way they are coming to dry you when those funny movies on your mobile phones come to try you they come to try you for you to overcome some of you will not fornicate and commit adultery but you watch them on your phones you are worse than the one that did the act we must come to another ephesians what is a disciplined son holy spirit takes the report back to the father you know these quotes praise god so what do you come and you're lying on your bed sleeping he takes that report back they stream a message for you to be in service you need to dress right sit at home in the spirit as if you were in the church under expectation some will sweep their mobile phones on and be sleeping on the bed and listening discipline the pastor is not there to see the dickies are not there to see some of you stream it off and you are roaming about in time who are you deceiving we've got to come to discipline it's an abomination for the woman to wear a command opportunity some of you will sneak through the jeans trousers in your bags you get out of here out of home in town you are in trousers to conform to the world god he that doesn't let him hear what the spirit is saying to the churches not the church the churches praise god oh my god could not trust this power with the church it's hard to tell what you would do with it how could the father trust his business with a boy that might simply pollute the whole inheritance he couldn't do it the church has got to come to a place where it is disciplined oh musicians praise god are we done are we ready to come to perfection praise god hallelujah oh buy me a good tribe by fire what is this gold gold is character character of the world so ephesians is proving your conduct and character efficiency is your discipline husbands discipline wives discipline churches discipline children's discipline we can't come to adoption with our first being what discipline so you husbands that are just tyrants dictators idioms what i say is what i'm the head of the home love your wife first if you love your wife you would not talk to her that way if you love your wife you'll not want to say anything that will hurt her the holy spirit in you will find a way seek peace and pursue it oh god wants his church god wants to do it with his church tonight was to do it with an individual is to find somebody god wants this weekend to find an individual to find a husband that is not loving the house the wife to start loving the way god wants to find somebody wants to find a white that does not reverence the husband to begin to catch a revelation love of god to begin to reverence her husband children that obey their parents god is looking for someone this weekend are you the one are you the one are you the one oh if you come he will not cast you out he's standing at the door and knocking oh if you open that door he will come in today god wants to do it with the church tonight what's to do with an individual is to find somebody the holy spirit is searching to find men he can take him out to a certain place speak to that person anoint and give him something special great powers great powers and gifts to work his will and do his will but how can he do it when he's going he constantly has to come and say oh it's terrible the husband is not loving the wife how can he do it when he takes the report back to the father and you are not ready and we are in the age of the dispensation of ephesians where you are to love your wives reverence your husbands and the church must reverence christ the word that brings us to the discipline of the word then the holy ghost can be pleased then you are ready to surrender you are ready to be led you are ready to be guided you are ready to be directed then the holy spirit will meet you at the point of your need by inspiring the preacher to bring you what you need but when you resent the word how can he speak to you abraham said in i'm done seeking after jesus the spirit he said if i if i told you the spirit of a famous mechanic you respect me to know what is wrong with your car if i told you i had the spirit of mercedes-benz you respect me to know what is wrong with every mercedes-benz car praise god if i told you brother brahm said the spirit of christ was in me i must act like jesus you must act like jesus your character and conduct must be molded like that and the holy spirit moses character conduct when he comes into you husband that cannot love your wife seek the holy spirit because the holy spirit praise god molds that conduct when he comes into you when you are really born again of the spirit of god what we need tonight is that type of a church whatever the father showed him he believed it it had to be that is what the father's word was he used the father's word to defeat satan if you believe the word you will use it to be in another ephesians your character praise god he is looking for her character the character of christ now just a moment that that is it he chooses a bride to reflect his character buy me gold tried by fire he is looking for character he's not looking for your doctrine he's not looking for the mysteries you believe you can explain he's looking for one character a vision had to do with the character of the church they stood pulled on the world and the power was pleased to vindicate them the prophet said there's got to be another efficiency to this journey this price journey we've got to come to the character of the world see he chooses a bride to reflect his character to which the modern churches of today certainly miss his program here a million miles because they denied this to be the truth how could it be now he is looking for the day for that drive to be formed god is looking for today for that pride to be formed sons of the original word to be vindicated amen hebrews 13 8 just exactly like it was like he was he's got to be in the same flesh same bones same spirit same everything just exactly built up and then two then become one until the church becomes that they are not one the character of him the word for this age must be molded she must be molded like he is oh there is a gold of god first peter 1 7 that the trial of your faith be more precious than gold that perishes the god of god is a christ-like character produced in the fiery fairness of affliction that is the right kind of a gold that's the right kind of character god is looking for when you get to heaven what would be your testimony what did you overcome what did you strive what did you overcome what did you do praise god to gain the character of god did you overcome the women do you overcome popularity do you ever come lost for money what will be your testimony what kind of goal does the church have today it has but the worldly good that will perish it is rich it is complacent it has made the affluence the major criterion of spirituality it's car competition today you buy events or buy bentley you buy bentley or buy a cadillac when i'm walking christ is walking demon powers are fallen the son of god is coming praise god oh my god it has made affluence the major criterion of spirituality the evidence of god's blessing and correctness of doctrine etc is now based upon how many rituals are involved in it i want god to give me men of faith men that will believe the word hallelujah oh are you with me praise god i'm worried i'm done praise god identification 1964 brother abraham said amen praise god i don't know so problem then say let me continue with the other one uh did you finish it is that a tent or a cottage why should i care they are building a palace for bee over there true sounds of the word original word the other city in that new jerusalem with rubies and diamonds of silvano of gold his coffees are full his riches until we are children of the king with jesus our savior i'm a child of the king let us conduct ourselves like our father knowing someday we will go home to be with him yes sir our character identification moves us to the image of what we are our character of life that is in us let us from this day walk in that efficient journey envisions the price journey to perfection our character must be molded must reflect his word praise god oh praise god musicians get ready i'm done identifications paragraph 31 you see we our character is molded by what is on the inside of us and our outside only expresses what is on the inside sons of the original word we only produce what is on the inside so we are not on the outside looking out we are on the outside looking in and the inside now brings out see oh our character is murdered by what is on the inside of us and our outside only expresses what is on the inside we are what we are how we walk no matter what we say our life speaks louder than our word does you might say i'm a believer in god i would say well do you believe all the bible well i don't know then you see your lips your your life is speaking louder than what your voice would be if you say i'm a christian i don't believe in doing this i believe in doing all that god said is truth then live that kind of a life after that see your life speaks louder than your testimony this efficiency journey leads us to adoption places us
