[43:42] thanks for coming out
[43:44] in the last day that great day of the
[43:45] feast
[43:46] Jesus student Christ saying if any man
[43:49] tooth let him come unto me
[43:51] and drink
[43:54] oh this is three simple he that
[43:56] believeth on me was 38 as the scripture
[43:59] had said
[44:00] out of his belly shall flow
[44:02] Rivers already in water this is how it
[44:05] come out of his mouth right but vistina
[44:08] explains what that is but this speak he
[44:12] of the spirit
[44:14] which didn't believe on him should
[44:17] receive so this spirit is for believers
[44:20] this big he of the spirit which did not
[44:24] believe on him should receive for
[44:27] the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[44:30] because the Jesus was not yet glorified
[44:34] acts 1
[44:36] 4 and 5. I'm being assembled together
[44:40] with them commanded them that they
[44:42] should not depart from Jerusalem but
[44:44] wait for the promise of the Father which
[44:46] said he you have heard of me
[44:48] for John truly baptized with water
[44:51] but he shall be baptized with the Holy
[44:53] Ghost not many of these hence
[44:56] and our last crypto reading in Psalms in
[44:58] John chapter 20 verse 21. this is Jesus
[45:01] resurrection Ministry then said Jesus
[45:03] unto them
[45:04] again peace be unto you as my father
[45:08] sent me even souls and thy you and then
[45:12] he had said and when he had said this he
[45:15] breathed on them and said unto them
[45:17] receiving the Holy Ghost father God may
[45:20] you bless your word and confirm it in
[45:22] Jesus I ask it amen you may be seated o
[45:25] praise God praise God
[45:27] praise God I trust them that if you
[45:29] didn't wasn't live on the prayer meeting
[45:30] that you would listen it on YouTube and
[45:33] hear about building that altar Noah
[45:35] built an altar Joshua better alter Moses
[45:38] built to alter Abraham Builder altar
[45:40] every one of them built the altar our
[45:42] altar must be built there's not any
[45:44] anything I built altar a place a place
[45:47] that appeared where you could offer up
[45:49] your Praises or for your Thanksgiving or
[45:52] for up your worship make your petition
[45:54] unto God at the altar of God Amen praise
[45:57] God and when when Elijah gave the
[46:00] challenge about let the God be answered
[46:03] by fire be God he didn't just do
[46:05] anything and just start up and say Lord
[46:07] send your fire loss and if I have no he
[46:09] built the altar he restore the altar as
[46:12] the first thing he did to restore the
[46:14] altar because the altar is our
[46:16] connection and the prophet said the
[46:18] altar by unto the altar so we get back
[46:19] to Eden you cannot get back unless they
[46:22] come to the altar that is where Adam
[46:24] that's where Abel and King brought the
[46:26] offering and that's where God accepted
[46:28] Abel's sacrifice because Abel brought it
[46:31] by Revelation not by his senses and
[46:34] intellect but by Revelation because
[46:35] something in Abel told him it will take
[46:38] blood to reconnect us to Heaven's Door
[46:40] if we take blood to get us a SIM card to
[46:43] call back Heaven it will take blood to
[46:45] reconnect us to our father Oh Glory to
[46:48] God because sin had to be dealt with
[46:49] this holy righteous just God couldn't
[46:52] stand sin any form of sin minor sin
[46:55] major sin small Sin itty-bitty Sin he
[46:58] couldn't stand it whatsoever his law
[47:01] required Justice his law required
[47:03] judgment his law required a price had to
[47:06] be paid and in the Old Testament it was
[47:08] the blood of goats it was a blood of
[47:10] bulls that foreign
[47:12] peace offering this offering because God
[47:16] had to judge the whole earth because he
[47:18] knew he himself had to come even the
[47:20] blood of Jesus the perfect lamb and the
[47:23] Bible said this man when he offered his
[47:25] blood once Oh Glory that God has
[47:27] perfected forever them that are
[47:29] Sanctified his blood is why we are here
[47:32] his blood give us the opportunity to
[47:34] access presence it's not your works it's
[47:37] not your confession of what you believe
[47:38] or give the Lord some Praises is what he
[47:42] has done that's why the word said not by

[52:57] we would not want to come by the Throne

[53:03] we could not come by the Throne of
[53:04] judgment
[53:05] we could not stand there justly we would
[53:09] be condemned because we are of the world
[53:12] Adam's phone race but we are coming
[53:16] by The Throne of Mercy
[53:19] and Jesus when he was on Earth said if
[53:22] you'll ask the father everything in my
[53:24] name it'll be granted and I am asking
[53:27] now first Lord pardoning of all our
[53:30] transgression

[53:49] originally is unbelief
[53:51] he that believeth not has come them
[53:53] already and it's unbelief that causes us
[53:56] to commit the immoral crimes that we do
[53:59] and if we only believe we would not do
[54:02] those things so I pray father that
[54:05] you'll forgive our unbelief and will
[54:08] come to each of us tonight and bestow
[54:11] upon us the feet that will answer the
[54:14] request that we have below our hands
[54:16] granted Lord in our heart we come here

[58:37] [Music]
[58:40] all right
[58:46] let me see it
[58:48] every great achievement
[58:51] is tied to an absolute
[58:54] I ain't talking about you're making it
[58:55] yeah
[58:57] every great achievement
[59:00] is tight and absolute
[59:02] you cannot run life without having an
[59:05] absolute
[59:06] you can't make an achievement without it
[59:09] being an absolute for is the final typos
[59:12] it's a place where you are tied to
[59:15] something in the day we are living alone
[59:17] everything is breaking up so fragile
[59:20] I think that this message would be very
[59:23] appropriate thing especially to
[59:24] Christians when they're going through
[59:26] deep Waters now
[59:27] the Christian church is passing through
[59:30] the deepest what it had for the last two
[59:33] thousand years
[59:34] because we are coming to a spot to where
[59:37] there is something presented to
[59:39] Christianity something they have to make
[59:41] a decision on and I think that the
[59:43] Christian Church ought to have something
[59:44] that they know that their title instead
[59:47] of floating like a leaf upon the Water
[59:50] like up on the Wind as the Bible said
[59:52] carried about with every wind of
[59:53] Doctrine the winds Come Blow This leave
[59:56] this way another wind comes not when
[59:58] South went East when West Wind you'll
[1:00:00] never get anywhere you are not stabled

[1:01:37] out you're gonna affect your life

[1:04:41] because the devil doing that you know
[1:04:43] because God can't lie God don't have the
[1:04:46] abilities alive what God speaks it must
[1:04:48] always be the truth because God only
[1:04:50] speak his word he said my word not
[1:04:52] anybody else word my word shall not
[1:04:55] return unto me void whatever God said it
[1:04:57] has to come to pass
[1:04:59] he will shifting them for your sake
[1:05:01] Hallelujah he will pull long Kings for
[1:05:03] your sake he will change government for
[1:05:05] your sake Oh Glory to God I Daniel
[1:05:09] understood by books The Prophet Jeremiah
[1:05:12] say how long we supposed to be here walk
[1:05:15] and we are getting out give the Lord I
[1:05:18] shall be getting out we are getting up
[1:05:20] there's gonna be a Rapture there's going
[1:05:22] to be a body change there's water will
[1:05:25] put an immortality this corruption will
[1:05:27] put on interruption

[1:05:34] Hallelujah
[1:05:39] right now in America I have a black nun
[1:05:41] that died I think last year two years
[1:05:43] ago
[1:05:44] and when they try to move her body they
[1:05:45] recognize your body still intact are you
[1:05:48] by not smelling anything else
[1:05:53] people touching it something like if
[1:05:55] it's
[1:05:56] decision body incorrupted
[1:06:02] to explain that you know
[1:06:05] I have no explanation for that I have
[1:06:07] not I have no experience
[1:06:11] but they say her body is interruptible
[1:06:13] and people come into respect and we have
[1:06:15] every season walking a dead person there
[1:06:18] May IMAX but she's all gone
[1:06:23] they might know where she's all going to
[1:06:28] and you know what that will do for them
[1:06:29] it gives them anchor to their feet
[1:06:31] that we have this Incorruptible thing
[1:06:33] too we have an anchor boy
[1:06:36] that's not normal that is something of
[1:06:38] power
[1:06:41] and there's so much a joker sitting here
[1:06:42] dead when ghosts are 20th Prophet 20th
[1:06:46] century Prophet Vindicated like no other
[1:06:48] man was Vindicated before and Joker
[1:06:51] standing looking like if they say I
[1:06:53] wonder and I wonder and he says oh I

[1:07:02] come
[1:07:03] there's a bride to come to Perfection
[1:07:05] there's a pride to be a Revival there's

[1:07:43] there has to be somewhere the man has
[1:07:44] got to be tied to for his eternal
[1:07:46] destination because if you're going to

[1:08:37] here if a dimension
[1:08:39] what he could have done he can't do no
[1:08:41] more now Joshua take these people over
[1:08:46] Joshua was no leader man he was Moses
[1:08:48] minister he was menacing the Moses
[1:08:50] handling Moses stuff and helping Moses
[1:08:52] and doing this and that all of a sudden

[1:09:55] became very great
[1:09:56] you hear that is waiting
[1:09:58] the man worked great and went forward
[1:10:00] some people must create and go backwards
[1:10:02] you know Isaac was going forward
[1:10:05] until he grew and became very great
[1:10:07] for he had possession of flux and
[1:10:09] possession of hurts and great store of

[1:20:32] will
[1:20:33] Oh Glory
[1:20:40] [Music]
[1:20:45] so that anointing Came Upon Jesus isn't
[1:20:48] that right Brahm said that was God
[1:20:49] separate himself then he came upon the
[1:20:50] upper room people and they were filled
[1:20:52] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[1:20:54] in tongues as the spirit getting
[1:20:56] utterance it was God separated himself
[1:20:59] God first and a great Pillar of Fire God
[1:21:01] manifesting human body now God
[1:21:04] separating himself among his people the
[1:21:07] pillar of fire break it up and setting
[1:21:10] upon each of them like four licks of
[1:21:12] Blaze clothing tongues like Forks of
[1:21:14] fire clothing tongues like a fire set
[1:21:17] upon each of them and they were filled
[1:21:18] with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak
[1:21:20] in tongues and they speak of utterance
[1:21:22] how much mystery you think Mary know
[1:21:24] no then believe Christ together with a
[1:21:28] promise and they believe they promise
[1:21:30] and they went on expectation and receive
[1:21:32] it receive what it
[1:21:34] what it holy ghost
[1:21:36] they receive it not a book not yet they
[1:21:39] hear this tape and if you don't hear
[1:21:41] this date you're not in it that is false
[1:21:44] they have to receive it Oh Glory to God
[1:21:47] and that is the word in spirit form
[1:21:51] the Holy Ghost says what
[1:21:53] word in spirit form so that's why
[1:21:56] brother Brian could tell the
[1:21:57] Pentecostals you claim to have the Holy
[1:21:59] Ghost you you can't reject this word
[1:22:00] because the spirit in the wood is one if
[1:22:03] you say you have God's spirit and I give
[1:22:05] you the word and reject it it's not the
[1:22:06] spirit of God inside of you God's spirit
[1:22:08] can reject the word this Spirit and the
[1:22:10] word is the same my the words I speak
[1:22:12] unto you they are spirit and their life
[1:22:15] word and spirit is the same and the
[1:22:17] kingdom is the working power in your
[1:22:19] life don't say you have no power say you
[1:22:22] ain't had the spirit of the word inside
[1:22:23] of you yet because the secret is the
[1:22:25] word is in the pride God puts something
[1:22:27] inside of you that's why you receive the
[1:22:29] word that's why you come to church
[1:22:30] that's why you believe the message there
[1:22:32] is something inside of you you didn't
[1:22:34] put it your mother didn't give it to you
[1:22:36] is God put that inside of you
[1:22:39] acknowledge Him worship Him and thank
[1:22:42] him he put that yes you know you're
[1:22:44] miserable yes you know you're boastful
[1:22:46] and mouthful yes you know you're angry
[1:22:48] and bitter and whatever it is but he
[1:22:49] went past that he went to see what's
[1:22:51] inside your soul okay the Lord I shout
[1:22:54] in the house that's why he offer you a
[1:22:56] new heart that all I can make it and you
[1:23:00] spirit and his Spirit Give the Lord a
[1:23:02] shout he can only offer that to you
[1:23:05] because the seed is in you
[1:23:10] how many believe that this morning
[1:23:13] the seed is in you
[1:23:17] let me let me sting you a little bit he
[1:23:19] said no man can come except the father
[1:23:20] draw him
[1:23:24] so even though you don't feel recall in
[1:23:25] a God and you don't feel the anointing
[1:23:27] and you're feeling but there are people
[1:23:28] who very ivy
[1:23:31] they wish yesterday
[1:23:33] they just wish Jesus words they wish
[1:23:35] that double scripture I think let's do
[1:23:37] this because they're not feeling

[1:26:20] the spirits in the light upon Paul and
[1:26:21] walk and terrorizing him and Paul cast
[1:26:23] said nothing because God tell him say

[1:34:36] Pastor every Minister have to come down
[1:34:38] to the pyramid to find out how to get
[1:34:40] over here you can hide from the atomic
[1:34:42] bombs you can't hide from the weapons of
[1:34:44] war the only way up is to death pyramid
[1:34:47] this being when it's completed is the
[1:34:50] servant of God in the Church of God
[1:34:52] that's good in a Rapture Oh Glory to God
[1:34:55] hallelujah
[1:34:57] maybe seated
[1:35:00] my Lord
[1:35:02] Hallelujah
[1:35:04] praise God
[1:35:06] the prophet said watch the Holy Ghost
[1:35:10] will always point to the wood
[1:35:12] if it points to our Creed or
[1:35:13] denomination it is not the Holy Ghost he
[1:35:17] couldn't do that he point away from the
[1:35:19] word
[1:35:20] he died here we go to confirmed that
[1:35:23] word and make that word positive
[1:35:29] to do what make the word positive
[1:35:32] he died so he could come himself into
[1:35:36] that word
[1:35:37] he is the quick in life that makes the
[1:35:40] word live again
[1:35:42] that was his promise of that purpose of
[1:35:44] dying and he could still project himself
[1:35:46] through his church and make every word
[1:35:48] through every Age act exactly to say
[1:35:51] it's supposed to act
[1:35:53] he is the Dynamics
[1:35:55] of the mechanics
[1:35:57] he is
[1:36:00] the Dynamics is a person
[1:36:02] he is the Dynamics not some man is a
[1:36:05] Dynamics he is the Dynamics of the
[1:36:08] mechanics the mechanics of the church
[1:36:10] what is it
[1:36:12] apostles
[1:36:13] Prophets
[1:36:15] teachers
[1:36:16] in other words the faithful Ministry
[1:36:18] becomes God's mechanics
[1:36:21] and he continued the code is the dynamic
[1:36:24] that works that
[1:36:27] So when you say mechanics and Dynamics
[1:36:28] together he is saying the minister the
[1:36:31] office of the faithful Ministry becomes
[1:36:34] the word
[1:36:35] and the Dynamics come upon him
[1:36:37] the pastor Apostle Prophet and whatnot
[1:36:40] and God speak to that Sunday of
[1:36:43] Pentecost the pillar of fire was resting
[1:36:45] on Peter's shoulder like I picked up
[1:36:47] with a pillow of his shoulder but that
[1:36:49] pillar fire was resting on Peter's
[1:36:51] shoulder and the Holy Spirit is speaking
[1:36:52] out through Peter these are not what you
[1:36:55] suppose but this is that this is the
[1:36:58] stone that you build has rejected so
[1:37:00] that God himself identified in the
[1:37:02] scripture what exactly happened then he
[1:37:05] says praise God this this is that that
[1:37:07] the prophet Joel speak of so it was the
[1:37:09] word speaking back it was the anointing
[1:37:11] speaking out and that same thing going
[1:37:14] to happen again
[1:37:15] direct inspiration there's no other name
[1:37:18] on the heaven on the wish must receive
[1:37:21] and because Peter had the key to the
[1:37:23] kingdom he said repent every one of you
[1:37:24] and be baptized and that Keyhole for all
[1:37:27] of us that key still holding because he
[1:37:30] was given the keys to the kingdom repent
[1:37:33] every one of you and be baptized in the
[1:37:35] name of Jesus Christ foreign
[1:37:44] the gift of the Holy Ghost that has
[1:37:48] always been the promise in every age any
[1:37:50] generation even Cornelius received the
[1:37:53] Holy Ghost without even being baptized
[1:37:56] oh give the Lord as praise
[1:37:58] after he got the Holy Ghost surrender
[1:38:00] baptized in Jesus name
[1:38:01] Oh Glory the god the Holy Ghost come to
[1:38:04] our right heart
[1:38:05] Give the Lord some praises
[1:38:07] glory to God a right heart
[1:38:14] so when the disciples received this
[1:38:16] promise
[1:38:17] they went into an absolute fate
[1:38:20] period
[1:38:21] where they just believe in what God Said
[1:38:23] God said so God said so God said so they
[1:38:25] locked into the vision The Heirs wasn't
[1:38:27] itching hey
[1:38:29] with the new revelation that that the
[1:38:31] Pharisee preaching though they wasn't
[1:38:33] looking from tape to tape and scanning
[1:38:34] channels you know some people scanning
[1:38:36] channels they want to hear what this one
[1:38:38] praying after this one playing at this
[1:38:39] one playing I want to finish all the
[1:38:40] Mind confused
[1:38:42] no absolute because
[1:38:44] he said so he said so he's also
[1:38:50] so they were anointed
[1:38:53] with the words of the Solomon
[1:38:55] these disciples they were Anointed with
[1:38:57] the words the son of the son of man they
[1:38:59] had what Abraham called Resurrection
[1:39:01] feet
[1:39:02] that is Faith he's reached from the dead
[1:39:04] Jesus is not in public now he's not
[1:39:07] going by the and multiplying bread and
[1:39:08] fish just among the disciples
[1:39:10] quick then power revealing Mysteries
[1:39:12] quick and power revealing the word
[1:39:15] quickton power revealing the promise
[1:39:17] that they have to receive now remember
[1:39:19] they believe Christ before he is not
[1:39:21] raised from the dead but he is going
[1:39:23] deeper to give them promises from the
[1:39:25] father so he said behold I send you the
[1:39:27] promise of my father tarry in the city
[1:39:29] of Jerusalem until you be untrue perform
[1:39:32] on high so he set them up for power they
[1:39:36] were positive Powers coming at our body
[1:39:38] today that have no deal with it positive
[1:39:40] power is coming Hallelujah well the wife
[1:39:43] haven't cooked for me this morning
[1:39:46] now
[1:39:52] these brothers in the spirit they are
[1:39:55] Vex for this and vexada everything and
[1:39:57] you're grumpy and you're grumpy look
[1:39:59] grumpy
[1:40:03] Peter wasn't in that grumpy mood they
[1:40:05] was in the spirit someone God allowed
[1:40:07] things to happen to just to see what how
[1:40:09] you're going to behave
[1:40:10] you
[1:40:16] they could do what they want it's not
[1:40:17] it's not them he's testing he's testing
[1:40:19] you okay the Lord a shout
[1:40:23] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:40:25] praise God praise God so they were
[1:40:27] Anointed with the words of the son of
[1:40:29] man the son of man give them promises he
[1:40:32] opened their understanding and he opened
[1:40:34] the word to them you have to do both
[1:40:37] because if the world is open and you
[1:40:38] don't have the understanding you still
[1:40:39] miss it
[1:40:40] if you understand it open you wouldn't
[1:40:42] open he said
[1:40:43] you need both you know your
[1:40:46] understanding to open to catch a
[1:40:47] revelation of the word being open to you
[1:40:50] and the word being open to you shows you
[1:40:52] your promise
[1:40:54] and they show you just word open it
[1:40:57] shows you what you are promised notice
[1:40:59] what happened
[1:41:00] when Jesus Peter said the word of Christ
[1:41:02] he said the word Peter
[1:41:03] in other words as he acknowledge the
[1:41:05] reverence of the word the word
[1:41:07] acknowledge Him
[1:41:08] don't ask Peter I identify you and Upon
[1:41:11] This Rock I'll build my church
[1:41:13] the word speaks back to you isn't that
[1:41:14] right
[1:41:15] oh praise God so therefore all they had
[1:41:18] was to do was to go and wait
[1:41:20] wait under the promise of the age
[1:41:22] clothe themselves but I'm talking about
[1:41:24] the brightest wrapped in the gong of his
[1:41:26] promised word hallelujah are you with me
[1:41:28] he gave Abraham that faith when he that
[1:41:31] sixth sense when he was 75 years old and
[1:41:34] Sarah was 65 a woman dead he lived with
[1:41:38] her since he was about 17 years old no
[1:41:40] children he was 75 years old good as
[1:41:42] dead and God told him he was going to
[1:41:44] have a baby he called Everything
[1:41:45] concerted as though it wasn't for he was
[1:41:47] fully persuaded that God was able to
[1:41:49] keep the word that he said he didn't
[1:41:51] just wait from one night to the other he

[1:46:21] either for God or against God and the
[1:46:23] outward expression shows exactly what's
[1:46:25] on the inside
[1:46:26] you say I got the baptism Holy Ghost I'm
[1:46:29] going to heaven that don't mean one
[1:46:30] thing that you're going to have no sir
[1:46:32] you're gonna have the bathroom Holy
[1:46:33] Ghost every hour in your life or they
[1:46:35] say be lost and go to hell the Bible
[1:46:37] says so exactly right now some pastors
[1:46:39] this this to
[1:46:42] make the Holy Ghost as non-effect you
[1:46:44] don't need the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:46:45] because I have a court
[1:46:48] they didn't sell here
[1:46:51] Jesus didn't say that you know he
[1:46:52] breathed upon them receive he
[1:46:54] the Holy Ghost no brother Branham here
[1:46:57] is talking the context of a Triune being
[1:47:00] you have a body you have a spirit you
[1:47:02] have a soul you can be baptized on your
[1:47:04] flesh you could be baptized in your
[1:47:05] spirit you could baptizing your soul
[1:47:07] yeah
[1:47:08] that's what he's talking about here so
[1:47:10] then he went on further to say this yeah
[1:47:12] look here you're an outside person you
[1:47:14] have five senses that contact the
[1:47:15] outside buddy God give you five senses
[1:47:16] not to contact him but your only home CT
[1:47:19] smell feeling here then you have a
[1:47:21] spirit in the inside of that it has five
[1:47:23] outers conscience and love and so forth
[1:47:25] and what that your spirit your physical
[1:47:27] conducts the physical your spiritual
[1:47:29] contacts the spiritual but inside of
[1:47:32] that you got a soul and that soul is the
[1:47:36] gene that come from God
[1:47:39] so what he saw it what he's showing is
[1:47:40] not the flesh part it's not the spirit
[1:47:42] part it's the gene part it's the soul
[1:47:45] part it's what you have incited here
[1:47:47] right you flick it in the scriptures
[1:47:48] because you have to tell you the
[1:47:49] scriptures Peter and Mary and John Allen
[1:47:52] at the seed in the soul and they didn't
[1:47:54] bypass the upper room he told those

[2:02:19] put man to have choices and decision so
[2:02:23] it's up to you how much you want to
[2:02:25] surrender is up to you you have to want
[2:02:28] to be a better parent
[2:02:29] you have to be one to be a better father
[2:02:31] a better mother a better husband a
[2:02:33] better wife you have to want that
[2:02:34] that doesn't come automatically you're
[2:02:36] not born a good father or a good husband
[2:02:39] and if you're a good husband you want to
[2:02:40] be a great one
[2:02:42] I will give the Lord some praises
[2:02:44] if you're a good father you want to be a
[2:02:46] great father you have good Fathers
[2:02:48] without fathers good Fathers and great
[2:02:49] fathers great fathers that the children
[2:02:51] can't forget
[2:02:55] like uh but Hashem wife died past Hashem
[2:02:59] and his son was the only one child and I
[2:03:02] wish I had his words here to read what
[2:03:04] he spoke about his mother it was so
[2:03:06] enlightening to hear his son his her
[2:03:09] name is Isaac how he spoke he's talking
[2:03:11] about how his mother loved people how
[2:03:14] the mother loves serving and she was
[2:03:16] such a giver a free giving person and
[2:03:19] she not only given things she will give
[2:03:21] of her time
[2:03:23] and listen to people and relate to
[2:03:25] people and communicate with people but
[2:03:27] he expressed how much he was in love
[2:03:29] with God's people how much he served and
[2:03:32] are sitting on hearing that and I'm
[2:03:33] watching with admiration that this is a
[2:03:35] son I'm not sure I don't think he's in
[2:03:37] church right now but this is our son
[2:03:39] expressing the love that he saw and the
[2:03:41] way his mother acted I wonder how much
[2:03:44] children could talks about their mother
[2:03:46] Hollywood talks about the father
[2:03:53] you have a choice of a wife
[2:03:55] you go out and take your wife you want a

[2:04:01] plan for your future home could you
[2:04:03] imagine a Christian man going out and
[2:04:05] taking one of these modern records for a
[2:04:06] wife

[2:07:27] the last day will arrive
[2:07:30] let us be sure now
[2:07:31] while we are in our right mind
[2:07:34] and in the church and amongst the people
[2:07:36] where the Holy Spirit has to identify
[2:07:38] himself
[2:07:39] let us be sure that everything is all
[2:07:41] right
[2:07:41] and stays right before him are you ready
[2:07:44] Church
[2:07:45] don't you stop
[2:07:48] don't rest day and night until that
[2:07:51] quickening power has brought you from
[2:07:53] the things of the world
[2:07:55] into the kingdom of God
[2:07:57] and you are truly are brought into the
[2:08:00] kingdom of God and quickened by the
[2:08:02] spirit of God how happy with tears of
[2:08:05] joy we should be on our D knees day and
[2:08:08] night thanking God for what he has done
[2:08:12] I hear the bomb we are way over here at
[2:08:15] the back of the book
[2:08:18] [Applause]
[2:08:18] [Music]
[2:08:20] does that
[2:08:23] we are way over here at the back of the
[2:08:25] book
[2:08:25] what happens if the composer writes
[2:08:27] something and we find out it isn't acted
[2:08:29] out right we find out there is something
[2:08:31] that happens there is something lacking
[2:08:33] he who composed it has made it up and
[2:08:35] rooted out and then the symphony is
[2:08:37] playing it it's a wrong note there is
[2:08:39] something wrong the director gave the
[2:08:42] wrong motion
[2:08:43] that's what the matter of the day my
[2:08:44] Lutheran Brethren my Baptist bedroom my
[2:08:46] Pentecostal bedroom all my brethren for
[2:08:48] all these nominations you're trying to
[2:08:50] give a note hit back and there's a
[2:08:52] looter Wesley or actually the music
[2:08:55] sheet here shows with another day
[2:08:57] they have played their part back there
[2:08:58] now the only way we're gonna ever get to
[2:09:01] do it by bridging impression of the
[2:09:03] world I might say there's only one way
[2:09:05] for the director to do he has to get in
[2:09:08] the same Spirit of the composer
[2:09:12] so Beethoven and all these guys who
[2:09:14] write great music they could read it
[2:09:17] it's a script it have notes it is
[2:09:21] written anybody reading them noise could
[2:09:23] play it
[2:09:24] if a man playing something different he
[2:09:25] wins something else
[2:09:27] it has to be the same note
[2:09:30] oh this symphony is in order
[2:09:32] the man the spirit brought the symphony
[2:09:35] but a Branham brought the symphony and
[2:09:37] he write the music sheet and there's a
[2:09:40] fight for Ministry supposed to direct
[2:09:41] the plate according to the symphony
[2:09:43] according to the notes we'll give the
[2:09:46] Lord I shout but men seem to be writing
[2:09:48] their own notes Oh Glory to God
[2:09:51] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[2:09:54] praise God to the directors after
[2:09:57] getting the spirit of the composer
[2:09:58] brother Branham we should be so on fire
[2:10:01] for God
[2:10:03] we should be going day and night nothing
[2:10:05] should be able to stop us
[2:10:07] yeah you're always supposed to be we
[2:10:09] supposed to be so sweet
[2:10:11] so pleasant
[2:10:13] so kind
[2:10:15] so Christ like in our lives it takes
[2:10:18] everyday life
[2:10:21] to be like that
[2:10:22] Another Sunday thing
[2:10:24] guys every day you're fighting every day

[2:10:44] shouting of every little thing
[2:10:49] I said take it easy brother take it easy
[2:10:55] Let It Go you have to know what word the
[2:10:58] fight
[2:10:59] what would the rebuke

[2:11:03] blessed be the name of the Lord like
[2:11:06] that your pressure will keep staying up
[2:11:07] right there you know and when you see
[2:11:09] alter the spirit and your body run down
[2:11:10] is a difficult thing to manage stress
[2:11:13] and I've read the scripture where Jesus
[2:11:15] told disciples come outside and rest
[2:11:17] come outside and rest we'll see how the
[2:11:18] ministry I think they come aside and
[2:11:20] rest the rest is to recharge the rest is
[2:11:23] to get empowered get back strength to go
[2:11:25] back and face the battle for you oh give

[2:11:39] Jesus
[2:11:40] specifically identified the little
[2:11:42] reveal how it grows and pours and spin
[2:11:44] so but I'm talking about the personality
[2:11:46] it's done in the muck but it's pressing

[2:11:50] pressing and that person only Sundays

[2:12:07] Hallelujah adoption placing positionally
[2:12:10] where are they at show me where they are
[2:12:12] God calling this children aside by
[2:12:14] manifestation they don't have to say one
[2:12:16] word about it watch position he plays
[2:12:19] his son getting him in order just
[2:12:21] exactly the same thing he's just as much
[2:12:24] as Authority as an archangel I'm almost
[2:12:26] finished
[2:12:27] oh my God oh praise God
[2:12:31] Hallelujah
[2:12:33] the father's ceremony is that this is my
[2:12:35] son from henceforth he's a governor he's
[2:12:38] a ruler over all my Heritage all I got
[2:12:40] belongs to him he could sign the check
[2:12:43] my God isn't that that's the time that's
[2:12:45] a prophecy over you know that you'll
[2:12:47] come to the place to sign the check just
[2:12:49] take a little more here now was the
[2:12:51] Pentecostal Church a noisy Church
[2:12:53] back at the beginning when the Holy
[2:12:56] Ghost fell
[2:12:59] the Virgin Mary she was drunk staggered
[2:13:01] on the power of God all of them like
[2:13:03] that the people said they are full of
[2:13:04] new wine that's the way the church was
[2:13:07] ordained that's the way every church is
[2:13:10] ordained every time God has a church it
[2:13:12] has to be the same kind of church
[2:13:15] and I am identified with the same kind
[2:13:18] that's the only kind that God have
[2:13:21] same kind of church
[2:13:22] let me know
[2:13:24] he said cause that ain't no answers in
[2:13:26] town uncertain song it's strange
[2:13:29] wherever he is there's always a lot of
[2:13:32] noise
[2:13:33] you know noise is a sign of life
[2:13:35] remember the high priest when he dressed
[2:13:37] and went to the holiest holies on the
[2:13:39] end of the Garment he had a pomegranate
[2:13:40] on a bell and that noise is the holiest
[2:13:43] of holies was the one way the waiters
[2:13:45] know that he was alive or not it made a
[2:13:47] noise and when they ate no noise then he
[2:13:49] might be dead
[2:13:51] and I think that's the whole matter with
[2:13:52] the churches today there is not enough
[2:13:54] noise about it
[2:13:55] not enough enthusiasm not enough
[2:13:57] something so where Jesus is there is
[2:14:00] always a noise
[2:14:05] don't tell me God in Simplicity God in
[2:14:07] silence wherever Jesus is
[2:14:10] there is noise
[2:14:12] Heavenly noise worship noise show the
[2:14:16] noise but there's never gonna be quiet
[2:14:19] is never dead
[2:14:21] Oh Glory to God
[2:14:23] you know
[2:14:25] the priest went in dress for the holies
[2:14:27] of holies on the end of the Garment in
[2:14:29] the pomegranate and a bell and that
[2:14:31] noise in the holy holies was the only
[2:14:33] way they waited knew they was alive or
[2:14:34] not praise God isn't that right I think
[2:14:37] that that time in Europe you know
[2:14:58] in heaven in heaven the seraphs saying
[2:15:03] holy holy Lord God Almighty they cry in
[2:15:05] day and night when Isaiah went into the
[2:15:08] temple and he broke into the Heavenly
[2:15:10] atmosphere and saw them seraphims and
[2:15:14] they are the burners they take the fire
[2:15:16] off the altar they will touch his lips
[2:15:19] the word cleanse you are purged
[2:15:23] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[2:15:26] so the representation of that was the
[2:15:29] Bells on Iran garment there one time he
[2:15:32] coming to Jerusalem
[2:15:33] they were screaming and hollering Who
[2:15:35] Silence of the king had come out some of
[2:15:38] those priests standing there why do you
[2:15:39] make them keep still and hold their
[2:15:41] peace and he said if they hold their
[2:15:43] peace the rocks will cry out something
[2:15:46] has got to move when he's around
[2:15:49] glory to God hallelujah praise God
[2:15:53] hallelujah hallelujah people say you
[2:15:56] make too much noise this is the quietest
[2:15:59] place you'll ever live in if you get to
[2:16:01] heaven even the angels are singing day
[2:16:03] and night holy and holy unto the Lord if
[2:16:07] they go to hell it is weapon and willing
[2:16:09] and National teeth this is the quietest
[2:16:11] place you'll ever live oh praise God
[2:16:14] praise God praise God
[2:16:16] hallelujah hallelujah you talk about
[2:16:18] woman don't want to make babies no more
[2:16:20] they will take dog and Captain so on
[2:16:22] she's a disgrace so if she did by sin
[2:16:25] loving society and so that type of woman
[2:16:27] right he said a true picture of the
