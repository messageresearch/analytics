[16:45] amen amen praise God Amen god bless you
[16:49] even get bad words are like a return to
[16:52] one portion of scripture tonight's in
[16:54] John chapter 15 we want to read from
[16:56] verse 1 to eat
[17:24] I am The True Vine and my father is the
[17:27] husbandman every branch in me that
[17:30] beareth NOT fruit he take it away and
[17:33] every branch that bears fruit he Bridget
[17:35] it that in a bring forth more fruit now
[17:38] you are clean to the word which I have
[17:40] spoken unto you abide in me and I in you
[17:44] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[17:47] itself except it abide in the vine no
[17:51] more can ye except ye abide in me I am
[17:55] the vine ye are the branches he that
[17:58] abideth in me and I in him the same
[18:00] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[18:03] you can do nothing if a man abide not in
[18:07] me he is cast forth as a branch is
[18:10] withered men gather them and cast them
[18:12] into the fire and they are burned if ye
[18:15] abide in me and my words abide in you
[18:18] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[18:22] be done unto you hiren is my father
[18:25] glorified that you bear much fruit so
[18:29] shall ye be my disciples may God bless
[18:31] rid of this word you may be seated
[18:42] mmm it's good to be here tonight it's
[18:46] always good to be in the presence of God
[18:48] and to be the hosts of God so I've a
[18:51] title tonight you are the branches
[18:54] that's a title tonight you are the
[18:57] branches
[18:57] you are the branches but a Branham from
[19:01] fundamental foundational feet message
[19:03] preached to teens of January 1955 and if
[19:08] Seaton by his power can make his laws
[19:11] work in man how much more God with his
[19:16] power make his laws work in man if Satan
[19:20] can make his laws be sure and us
[19:23] recognize it how much more gore to his
[19:25] children to make his laws be recognized
[19:28] among his people of divine healing
[19:31] revelation power gifts and manifestation
[19:35] of the Spirit the law of sin and death
[19:39] works in the people and the law of the
[19:42] liberty of Christ has come unto us to
[19:45] set us free from those things so I
[19:49] believe listen I believe this with all
[19:52] my heart I believe that we are nearly
[19:56] age when people are going to recognize
[19:59] these things we have had so much vain
[20:02] philosophy and so forth and teachings
[20:05] that ought not to be until is accept the
[20:08] human mind to a revolution of thinking
[20:11] on matters of this and that and taking
[20:13] it away from the Word of God I have said
[20:15] faith does not come by fasting faith
[20:20] doesn't come by praying or reading a
[20:23] book all of that is good fasting praying
[20:27] reading a book but faith comes by a
[20:31] settled something in the human heart
[20:34] that tells you just as sure as you come
[20:37] to this church tonight when you come
[20:39] home you tell your wife you'll be home
[20:41] after services over you do that
[20:43] unconsciously you just go out and get in
[20:46] your car and you go home no you could
[20:49] you could not do it unless you have
[20:51] faith that you could do it you never
[20:53] move on where you're sitting thinking if
[20:55] you did not fit you could raise up but
[20:57] you've done those things so much you
[20:59] just become so accustomed to those laws
[21:02] nearly become a natural thing Oh blessed
[21:05] be the name of the Lord
[21:06] do you see it tonight so he is saying
[21:09] that the faith that supposed to come
[21:11] forth is an unconscious fee it's
[21:14] supposed to be part of your being you
[21:16] know God is able you know God is not
[21:19] dead you know he's gonna heal you you
[21:21] know you're gonna restore your family
[21:23] you're not worried you know you're gonna
[21:25] get your breakthrough
[21:25] praise God your faith declares it so you
[21:29] recognize know like the Leopards know
[21:34] have mercy upon me and Jesus said go and
[21:38] show yourself to the priest they walk in
[21:40] obedience and in obedience they were
[21:42] healed there wasn't baptized in Jesus
[21:44] name there wasn't in church they didn't
[21:47] get Bibles to read they just believed
[21:50] that this man had the power to release
[21:53] them from their condition and you have
[21:57] to believe that same thing tonight that
[21:59] God is here to release you from your
[22:03] condition we believe that tonight who
[22:06] prays godless let's go to what now if if
[22:10] we control ourselves completely to God
[22:13] and his will and be lost here we go to
[22:18] our own thoughts and just let the mind
[22:21] of Christ be in us them same operation
[22:25] of the Spirit would work to us just as
[22:28] natural things does because we were
[22:33] first created for that purpose to
[22:36] control to rule and to praise God and to
[22:40] live for God did you hear that we were
[22:43] created to control to rule and to praise
[22:48] God that was the first commission that
[22:50] God deal man
[22:51] have dominion over conquer the sea
[22:55] conquer yet
[22:57] every creeping thing so you are a
[22:59] conqueror
[23:00] that's God's purpose you will build a
[23:03] rule that's why when men see them on
[23:05] Everest
[23:06] they just have taken it that man came up
[23:08] here they talk about difference they put
[23:11] the flag on company they look at how
[23:13] high dermal goodness I am man
[23:15] and I could conquer I was born for this
[23:18] even in a formal condition they know
[23:22] they could conquer or glory to God when
[23:25] polio came out man believing a conqueror
[23:28] to i'm-a-comin vaccine for polio vaccine
[23:32] for the period or glory Devon man is a
[23:34] conqueror we conquer the seas he conquer
[23:38] the air he cannot conquer space at all
[23:40] they were born to conquer we talking
[23:43] about fallen man what about the restored
[23:46] man what about a man came back in a
[23:49] channel of God or glory to God I believe
[23:52] that hallelujah hallelujah first we were
[23:57] first created I want you to take every
[23:59] word as God speaking directly to you
[24:01] when you hear it you said that I am
[24:04] created for this purpose whoa chlorine I
[24:07] got in another Church thing now this is
[24:09] an individual thing okay I already know
[24:12] because we were first created for that
[24:14] purpose the control to rule to praise
[24:18] God and to live for God know Jesus said
[24:21] I like that when Jesus saw the talk as a
[24:23] big thing jesus said if he abide in me
[24:28] and my words abide in you you can ask
[24:34] what you will and it shall be done unto
[24:37] you
[24:38] Oh pouring of God hallelujah if he abide
[24:43] in me and my words abide in you oh god
[24:47] we trust' so much a humanistic and
[24:49] natural hoping this work or than that
[24:51] work hard and there's so much power in
[24:52] the word right here
[24:54] you could acts whatever you will and it
[24:57] shall be done unto you all he asked for
[25:00] you Abidin for you remaining is that
[25:03] right
[25:03] but abandon continue though the father
[25:05] and his word is inseparable cuz the word
[25:08] is his son in the beginning was the word
[25:11] the Word was with God and the Word was
[25:14] God and the Word was made flesh and
[25:16] dwelt among us God and His Word is
[25:19] inseparable you cannot have God without
[25:21] having his word and when you have his
[25:23] word you have God give the Lord a shout
[25:30] so you see when the Parabellum says when
[25:32] the Holy Spirit call him become a tenant
[25:34] write and say the secret is the word is
[25:37] in the pride that's God in the bride
[25:40] that's true their perfection the
[25:42] capstone worth working its way out God
[25:46] put the word in you I know the word in
[25:49] you put the work its way out I am the
[26:02] vine and you are the branches
[26:05] Oh hallelujah what bears fruit the
[26:08] branches bears the fruit ok let's
[26:10] continue now hallelujah
[26:12] so if you want to go back a little
[26:14] further just as far as historical you
[26:17] could see the word in the beginning was
[26:19] the word and what is the word a word is
[26:22] a sort manifested a word is a thought
[26:27] spoken for so a word is actually a
[26:30] manifestation of a thought so God
[26:34] thought it and God spoke it and then I
[26:37] catch the word no and that is what in
[26:40] the beginning but before the beginning
[26:42] was God's thought which is this main
[26:45] which is the intelligence of God
[26:48] hallelujah
[26:49] so after man fell that ports of God
[26:53] wants to be Redeemer to be Savior
[26:56] you know man go get sick to be a healer
[26:59] or glory to God to be a Baptizer evil
[27:04] man go need power come on now so he come
[27:07] to be a Baptizer you know you're not
[27:09] caught matter so he will be a lawyer
[27:11] he will be a doctor whatever you have
[27:14] need of he gonna be whatever you have
[27:17] lead up all these was the thoughts of
[27:20] God
[27:21] so when Jesus came he said I am the door
[27:24] I am the way I am the truth
[27:27] he was the iron man I am whatever you
[27:30] want me to be that is what I am or glory
[27:34] of God and when Jesus spoke that way he
[27:38] was expressing what the I am who spoke
[27:41] to Moses when they say who shall I say
[27:43] sent me or Gloria tell em I am a up or
[27:50] glory to God hallelujah praise God so
[27:53] you I will get up employment tonight is
[27:57] that not next week tonight you will get
[28:01] our empowerment from the word itself
[28:04] because the word itself is God all these
[28:07] years the devil making people feel the
[28:09] world is just letter but the word is God
[28:12] or give the Lord a shout the word is God
[28:18] [Applause]
[28:19] Amen so what a word is a thought
[28:23] manifested
[28:24] I thought spoken for so first he
[28:27] perceives the thought then spoke it and
[28:29] it became a word and then the word
[28:31] listen became material let there be
[28:36] light
[28:37] thought will let there be light
[28:39] manifestation and there was light or
[28:42] glory to God let the earth bring forth
[28:45] thought would spoken then he would bring
[28:47] forth or glory to God are you with me
[28:50] now
[28:50] so everything that God has spoke in his
[28:53] word
[28:56] received into the right channel like
[28:59] tonight will materialize that word for
[29:04] whatever the promise behind it is
[29:07] Claude will do it he is obligated to it
[29:12] now we are getting into principles that
[29:15] will step you into a manifestation the
[29:20] world received into the right channel
[29:25] will materialize that word for whatever
[29:29] the promise behind it is God will do it
[29:32] he is obligated and then if he abandoned
[29:36] me here we go I'm I was abiding you then
[29:39] you have brought the world in you and
[29:42] you believe the world just as I believe
[29:44] God because it is gone do you understand
[29:52] no white Jesus after why he says away
[29:55] but my word will never pass away he was
[29:58] so locked up in the thoughts of God
[30:01] whatever you see has to come to pass and
[30:03] the bride will be put in that very same
[30:05] position that's why the Prophet said the
[30:10] world will hear direct from God because
[30:14] God's going to be sailing a bride when
[30:19] the bride speaks is God speaking when
[30:23] the great move its course moving or
[30:27] chlorine of God God dressing himself in
[30:31] the form of a brain
[30:33] [Music]
[30:39] now Jesus said whatever you ask the
[30:42] Father in my name that will I do
[30:45] did you ever realize what that means do
[30:50] you realize if we call before God in the
[30:53] name of Jesus it is just the same as
[30:55] Jesus himself prayin is a big one
[31:01] tonight you could take that one and put
[31:03] that in your pocket and run it up
[31:04] tonight let's go put one tonight did you
[31:07] hear that that was reason again he said
[31:12] Jesus said whatever you ask the Father

[36:59] faith created we was made for that
[37:02] purpose then true the fall why we was
[37:05] taken away from that then in Redemption
[37:08] we was brought back to it again and the
[37:13] only thing that hindered the human race
[37:15] today from being superior and
[37:18] controlling like they did in the
[37:20] beginning is because the power lines of
[37:26] the outlet of God made in the human
[37:30] being has been clogged up
[37:35] now all the wiring is there but it
[37:40] cooked up if you puke on a water just

[40:55] wireless telegram an unseen force move
[40:57] the to space that no man can catch only
[41:01] machinery can catch it because it's too
[41:03] fast for the eye yet there's a force
[41:05] that's these these telegrams coming
[41:07] right here now no here we go if the
[41:10] natural laws of God which is election
[41:14] things once handed the right capacity
[41:16] can do those things how much more could
[41:20] the power of the Holy Ghost
[41:23] once passion to the human at my feet
[41:26] what it could do now God has not
[41:30] promised us election city only just
[41:33] might have set them free
[41:35] but look what the Holy Spirit has
[41:36] promised to the believers today when we
[41:39] look back and see that God put Alisha
[41:41] see here for a season thing and science
[41:44] is moving into the field of science and
[41:46] bringing it out remember everything you
[41:48] see here it has always been here in
[41:53] science corner and bring it out where
[41:56] there was driving the horse and buggy
[42:00] chariots and things M chance you wheel
[42:03] and the wheel and they spit on you how
[42:06] they just discovered yet they hard wheel
[42:10] the odd horse but God is here if you
[42:15] only know what man was going to develop
[42:16] after all the material is steel the
[42:20] metal or whatever it is or was always
[42:23] here on the
[42:25] man is not aqueous at the creating out
[42:27] of nothing he take what God put assemble
[42:31] it together you have car airplane
[42:33] computer piano organ guitar is man
[42:38] making things by taking stuff that's
[42:43] already here now we have over 1100 books
[42:49] and messages from a prophet in the
[42:52] desert of voice of the seventh angel
[42:55] when he shall begin to song all the
[42:59] material is in the books all the
[43:01] materials in the tape and they're gonna
[43:03] take some spiritual scientists to put
[43:08] things together to get that different
[43:11] product we have to have a new product
[43:13] for this age ordinary faith can't work
[43:16] it will take rapture in faith so
[43:18] whatever we mix in and mix it what are
[43:21] we flipping on sliding whatever we put
[43:23] in you including here at the end of the
[43:25] day have to produce your actual faith or
[43:28] we won't go or get the Lord a shout
[43:33] glory of God did you get that all right
[43:37] let's continue hallelujah praise God
[43:39] watch science moving out in the field
[43:43] and bringing it oh but we as Christians
[43:46] we become too clogged up we just can't
[43:49] understand we think but the doctor said
[43:51] I can't get well as long as you think
[43:53] that you are not thinking go to the
[43:57] doctor say you can't get well that's
[44:00] inside the challenging doctor because
[44:03] the doctor says oh thanks that God says
[44:05] so doctors that God you need quarter
[44:08] talk okay the Lord a shout
[44:12] the doctor saying his best you see well
[44:20] I'm going to die your doctor said I was
[44:22] going to die
[44:23] oh all we gossiped his doctor that's the
[44:24] best of his knowledge now if he said you
[44:27] were going to die humanly speaking I
[44:29] believe the same thing but by the word I
[44:31] believe it that's right because he
[44:33] promised me whatever acts the Father in
[44:35] his name would be granted I believe that
[44:38] truth now if God could just clear that
[44:42] little channel out and run that energy
[44:45] out to that place something after the
[44:48] whole body is set together to operate
[44:52] and is that just a show and it takes
[44:54] every memory way to operate and gives me
[44:56] life so that it takes and remember the
[44:57] body of Christ to operate together to
[44:59] get it right
[45:02] Somerset's in the Church teaches
[45:04] apostles prophets gifts of healing
[45:08] miracles speaker madtown's
[45:10] interpretation and so forth all those
[45:12] things in this one great mystic body of
[45:16] Jesus Christ moving on the earth on
[45:17] Sunday I believe and I believe it's near
[45:20] at hand right now just like tonight in
[45:22] this light and that light he has given
[45:24] up little swing the role of our younger
[45:26] run that way over there that material
[45:28] when the energy goes into that wire it
[45:31] will produce just exactly like it was
[45:33] here and I believe a lot of times when
[45:35] the wiring up of God spiritual but in
[45:37] the earth I see this reverently to the
[45:40] Letitia the prominence all right we
[45:42] can't save them by water that's the only
[45:45] thing about this Odyssey if this body is
[45:49] correctly wired up and the father heaven
[45:52] turns on the big master switch
[45:57] so you don't know the promised wish all
[45:59] of this the body wired up and the big
[46:03] mark in the father heaven turns on the
[46:06] master on something is what the rise up
[46:08] if the body if the building is properly
[46:11] wired if properly taught every fiber or
[46:14] body being lost in Christ look if you
[46:17] got theology if you've got some doctrine
[46:19] if you got some superstition if they got
[46:21] some unbelief you've got something that
[46:23] stops up somewhere then the energy can
[46:25] never pull through you but when you get
[46:27] to a place where you are perfectly wired
[46:30] and the master electrician has okayed it
[46:35] by sealing it with the Holy Spirit a
[46:43] [Music]
[46:45] master electrician to finish running
[46:53] wires on your hands and when inspector
[46:56] come you feel it you need a qualified
[47:00] decision or glory regard all right but
[47:04] when you got a place where you're
[47:05] perfectly wild and the Massey logician
[47:07] has okayed it by sealing it by the Holy
[47:11] Spirit the only thing is just a tender
[47:14] switch then and there will be a light
[47:16] show and yeah the light of the world a
[47:21] city that set on a hill that cannot be
[47:24] hid and tonight we ought to be ashamed
[47:27] of ourselves and honestly and humbly
[47:31] confess our unbelief before God and ask
[47:35] him to forgive us of how we represent
[47:38] him in this life he is dependent on us I
[47:43] know you think you are dependent on him
[47:46] but he tonight yeah
[47:50] the branches and the vine here we go is
[47:54] dependent upon the branch to produce
[47:57] fruit
[48:02] you hear you have a chosen generation a
[48:05] royal priesthood a holy nation tonight I
[48:08] want you to see a certain picture I want
[48:11] you to see yourself as very important to
[48:14] the vine as the branch Oh glory to God
[48:18] hallelujah praise be to Jesus our let's
[48:21] continue all right
[48:23] the Old Testament did not have this
[48:25] presence you are aware of that amazing
[48:38] again the Old Testament people did not
[48:43] have this presence your way of that you
[48:48] refer back sometimes Elijah to Moses to
[48:50] those people Moses Elijah and those
[48:53] people were great men ordained of God
[48:55] but yet not the privilege that you have
[48:59] they haven't the privilege they did not
[49:03] have the power given them to perform as
[49:07] you have got yourself
[49:14] this something like a whole new set of
[49:17] mysteries are fully in Italy they did
[49:24] not have the power given them to perform
[49:27] as you have got yourself because
[49:29] everything that's in Christ for
[49:32] therefore shortest day and embraced it
[49:36] and believed it and look for it to come
[49:40] before it ever come and now we are
[49:43] living right in it and I'm afraid of it
[49:46] what a privilege
[49:48] now if sees and body can be operated by
[49:51] unbelief and don'ts and fears will
[49:53] produce what what the scripture says is
[49:55] will it produce sickness it produces
[49:57] after it put is all these things then
[49:59] people buy under even produce that
[50:02] shouldn't people by believing but the
[50:04] power of God harness these things and
[50:06] bring them back to correction
[50:12] now how you suppose I see yourself
[50:14] tonight as a believer you another
[50:18] unbeliever sitting here tonight you are
[50:20] believing in the night and guess what
[50:22] these signs shall follow them so it
[50:32] should not be a surprise to our shock of
[50:34] the miracles and wonders about you
[50:37] around your life or glory the board no
[50:40] shock about that because you begin to
[50:42] recognize itself as a believer
[50:44] recommending self as a branch that Jesus
[50:47] need you he's depending upon you I am
[50:51] the vine and you are the branches
[50:54] Oh glory love God hallelujah hallelujah
[50:58] I need you the same energy the energy
[51:06] come from the finest of the branch so
[51:09] you're not here to make up numbers you
[51:12] were here to be energized
[51:13] [Applause]
[51:18] all right let me go for less this is
[51:22] getting better
[51:23] Oh glory to God amen going good what did
[51:28] Christ redeem us for did you ever think
[51:31] what he redeem us for why didn't he just
[51:35] make you the atonement and say there's
[51:37] no need of giving them deep power there
[51:41] was no need and making this man a sort
[51:43] of son of God there's no need in doing
[51:46] that I was just ask him to believe it
[51:48] and write his name in the book of heaven
[51:50] and that settle it but he gave us he
[51:54] gave us these redeemed blessings that we
[51:57] might operate the work of God by the
[52:02] energy of the Holy Spirit of God by the
[52:14] energy of the Holy Spirit then he was
[52:17] break in description on st. John 15 I am
[52:19] the vine ye are the branches do you know
[52:22] that the vine can't be a fruit although
[52:28] the fruit is in the vine that's the the
[52:36] fruit is in the Fang but the Fang kind
[52:39] of been through hallelujah
[52:43] but the fruit cannot be brought forth
[52:46] from a file it has to have a branch to
[52:49] be a fruit and you are the branches
[52:54] there was no fruit with on you or give
[52:59] the Lord a shotgun back how do you feel
[53:04] about that tonight he's depending upon
[53:20] the branch to produce fruit oh god we
[53:24] get caught tonight or glory to God you
[53:27] get caught tonight
[53:28] you are going to be a living moving
[53:30] monument you are gonna be a tabernacle
[53:34] robust and living tabernacle of the
[53:36] Living God's dwelling place all glory
[53:40] hallelujah you are the branches
[53:45] no divine with all of its energy cannot
[53:52] produce anything unless the branch is
[53:55] willing to receive the energy so if I
[54:00] want to push out but if the branch can't
[54:02] receive it
[54:03] how will the food be produced you have
[54:07] to have the energy and you have to
[54:09] receive the energy or glory of God are
[54:12] you with me now let's continue are you
[54:15] ready are you ready tonight
[54:18] God is depending on you as a member of
[54:23] his body to be a fruit of his spirit no
[54:28] if he is dependent on you let's open our
[54:33] channels and let the Holy Spirit come in
[54:36] tonight and energize us and free us from
[54:41] all these fears and doubts and a revival
[54:43] come
[54:44] [Music]
[54:46] [Applause]
[54:48] what holding back remember is fearsome
[54:51] dose because what promises work I like
[54:53] Oh glory to God God promised signs and
[54:56] wonders written witnesses listen the
[54:59] Apostles had great witness of the Spirit
[55:02] confirm the Ministry of the Apostles
[55:05] there wasn't talking about the left hand
[55:06] world there was a confirmation I was
[55:08] here they believed that someone said the
[55:12] power has only given the apostles of
[55:13] those things I am a historian but I've
[55:15] read much history of the church history
[55:17] I've never seen a time in all the
[55:19] history of the world where there was
[55:21] ever was the wheels of the Holy Ghost
[55:23] ever struck the church with out a
[55:24] revival but what sign then one of the
[55:27] miracles followed it the ones the Holy
[55:30] Ghost strikes the church they've got to
[55:33] have a wave of signs and wonders America
[55:36] this is no singing revival this not
[55:42] given notebooks of
[55:49] [Applause]
[55:49] [Music]
[56:01] praise the Lord
[56:02] Oh all right let me read it again in all
[56:13] history of the world where there ever
[56:15] was the ways of the Holy Ghost ever
[56:17] struck the church we don't a revival but
[56:19] what sign that one is Americans
[56:20] following God heal the sick in every age
[56:23] I will continue to do it in every age
[56:26] where people and churches are willing to
[56:29] let loose and let the Holy Spirit take
[56:33] control of their being you have to be
[56:38] willing to let God be the boss let God
[56:41] be in charge
[56:42] let God rule and reign and get your
[56:46] fresh out of the way get your thinking
[56:48] out of the way get your toes out of the
[56:50] way and you do what the spirit see do
[56:57] hallelujah Martin Luther prayed for one
[57:01] of his close companions and he was
[57:03] healed John Wesley I believe it was
[57:06] recorded 240 cases generally praying for
[57:10] the sick and they were healed when he

[57:33] under two mu D Sankey fini all those men
[57:39] when waves of the horsemen move across
[57:40] the church there was signs and wonders
[57:42] one of them one time he said I believe
[57:45] was Moody
[57:45] there was so many people that had been
[57:48] healed in the meetin while the whole
[57:50] Smith was falling although moody didn't
[57:54] teach a doctrine of divine healing but
[57:57] he said there was so much healing taking
[57:59] place and his meetin he taught his
[58:01] church would turn into a cathedral like
[58:04] the place in France where they come down
[58:07] to be healed so many people being healed
[58:09] testifying of how the holy spirit even
[58:12] without being taught divine healing the
[58:15] Holy Spirit will do it himself if he can
[58:18] get the right it reproduce it so I don't
[58:21] see no reason why you can't be here
[58:23] tonight tonight
[58:31] [Music]
[58:34] could you take some more is the word
[58:37] going deep inside I have seen people who
[58:42] just couldn't even come for healing
[58:45] they'd just be sitting there and go home
[58:49] after being submissive to the Holy
[58:51] Spirit and then go home and be perfectly
[58:55] made whole and didn't even realize it
[58:58] the Holy Spirit is the healer
[59:03] [Applause]
[59:05] [Music]
[59:10] he said the Holy Spirit is here tonight
[59:13] to energize every life to do everything
[59:16] no we see what the basis of divine
[59:20] healing we have to draw this to a close
[59:22] but just before it's time won't let us
[59:24] speak much longer we've got to bring it
[59:26] to a close now there is something wrong
[59:30] in the beginning God has created you to
[59:36] be master of every circumstance that's
[59:46] in your DNA
[59:48] [Music]
[59:49] that's in your genetic code not I am
[59:56] weak
[59:57] that's why the Bible let the weak say
[59:59] because that is in your DNA he jested
[1:00:10] there's something wrong so he's
[1:00:12] addressing what's wrong in the beginning
[1:00:14] God has created you to be a master of
[1:00:17] every circumstance

[1:00:30] God has me oh that's God's Word no watch
[1:00:38] there was nothing nothing could happen
[1:00:41] unless you were the master of it that is
[1:00:46] what you were created for
[1:00:49] that is when when man had horse and
[1:00:51] buggy and one man said but we could fly
[1:00:54] of course
[1:00:57] people laugh at him of course there will
[1:00:59] be a modern mockery and see a plane but
[1:01:03] he tried something and and crashed and
[1:01:06] folder and keep on on it no we have jet
[1:01:09] plane because somebody said I ain't want
[1:01:12] no horse and buggy business I feel like
[1:01:15] a gold different thing altogether every

[1:13:58] use that power wit and whatever the Holy
[1:14:00] Ghost promised that is what you can do
[1:14:03] now to see the thing that delivers the
[1:14:05] word the word goes right out right and
[1:14:07] the Holy Spirit follows the word
[1:14:09] wherever the word is preached you see
[1:14:12] your pastor preach it the first thing I
[1:14:14] know he works he blows up across the
[1:14:17] building cause the Holy Ghost because
[1:14:19] it's the conductor of the word the word
[1:14:22] is the conductor of the Spirit
[1:14:25] so if I come and I set up dreams tonight
[1:14:27] no holy spit coming little dreams and
[1:14:29] coming to new ideas and I get thought
[1:14:31] and paint magazine have this and you
[1:14:33] speak of this under the papers of the
[1:14:36] Express not this and ecaddy I'm saying
[1:14:38] that no spirit passing through that it
[1:14:40] has to be the word or glories of God the
[1:14:44] word as a conductor the spirit so that's
[1:14:46] right we feel we can't preach because we
[1:14:48] cotton but I am Reverend son years ago
[1:14:53] that this is the conductor
[1:14:57] and when people begin to see the fire
[1:14:59] move to them coach and the fire moved to
[1:15:02] that world because this world is in you
[1:15:05] be then said by these promises that is
[1:15:08] why we are come to preach what revealed
[1:15:09] become the peace promises we given you
[1:15:11] promises tonight you are the branches
[1:15:14] that's a promise to produce fruit listen
[1:15:23] we not open this co-op you know we know
[1:15:26] this for happily enough if he abide in
[1:15:28] me and my words abide in you what demons
[1:15:32] standing in front of that what condition
[1:15:34] southern front to back or plural of God
[1:15:36] we talk about your Biden would you are
[1:15:39] Biden people die Biden you inside the
[1:15:43] word inside do you wanna sign up in
[1:15:46] there you were inside of you and you
[1:15:48] inside of him he's a doctor you shall
[1:15:51] know I'm in the Father he with me are
[1:15:55] you sittin cabbie feet that can tell us
[1:15:59] that or glory of God God is gonna make
[1:16:08] you a live wire it's it's untouchable
[1:16:12] get shock
[1:16:17] power inside of you and then she flew
[1:16:20] inside of you the word is a conductor of
[1:16:32] the Spirit because when the word is
[1:16:34] preached the spirit follows it wherever
[1:16:37] it goes the spirit follows the world all
[1:16:40] the way from the book of redemption the
[1:16:42] spirit follows the blood so when that
[1:16:45] will becomes blood you have the spirit
[1:16:47] atmosphere because without blood there
[1:16:49] is no spirit
[1:16:50] there's no presence there's this
[1:16:52] intellectual but blood needs your
[1:16:54] sacrifice
[1:16:55] what means you you you actually connect
[1:16:57] with the atonement or glory of God and
[1:17:00] the life of your blood the life of your
[1:17:02] opponent the spirit come back upon you
[1:17:05] as I worship herself
[1:17:09] oh wow
[1:17:17] and the message will quiet the big ocean
[1:17:22] of profit no worship no no atmosphere no
[1:17:26] atmosphere because there's no blood day
[1:17:28] they don't actually have knocks about
[1:17:30] the fullness of the atonement so there's
[1:17:33] no blood dear as long as there's no
[1:17:35] blood there's no atmosphere
[1:17:36] I'm long as there's an atmosphere a
[1:17:38] possibility there's then all glory that
[1:17:41] God of a healing of a deliverance of
[1:17:43] your ceiling
[1:17:44] woe unto us if we have not a cuisine
