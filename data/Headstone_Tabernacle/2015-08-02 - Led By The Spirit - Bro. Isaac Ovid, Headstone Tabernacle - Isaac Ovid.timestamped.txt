[17:15] day every service is
[17:18] important Thursday in canopia up here
[17:21] Wednesday in Deo Martin is
[17:23] important every service is important
[17:26] because you come to get a word from the
[17:27] Lord I'm sorry there's no self-help kit
[17:31] for your breakthrough and deliverance
[17:33] you can't fix yourself in that sense God
[17:38] have a plan and a road map to take you
[17:40] from one spot to another spot you got to
[17:43] walk on that road you got to get that
[17:46] map you got to get in God's plan and
[17:49] program if you have to get where you're
[17:51] supposed to uh where you have the
[17:53] destination as it was there's no
[17:55] self-help thing where you're going to
[17:57] fix yourself and cure yourself and do
[18:00] this for yourself and no it doesn't come
[18:01] that way there's a mind of God for every
[18:05] situation for every problem and every
[18:07] condition there's a mind of God for your
[18:09] home life your family life your own life
[18:11] there's a mind of God for that you have
[18:13] your own mind and God said it this way
[18:15] my thoughts are not your thoughts my
[18:17] ways are not your ways isn't that right
[18:20] so we are not we are here to push aside
[18:22] our own thoughts to look for the
[18:24] thoughts of God to drop down among usen
[18:26] Hal how many believe that this morning
[18:28] we are looking for the intelligence of
[18:30] God to drop down to speak to Heart isn't
[18:33] right sometime back we spoke about the
[18:35] Thornes tied up and choked up by the
[18:37] cares of this world and bring forth no
[18:39] fruit to Perfection tied up it's a world
[18:42] where it's busy everybody have something
[18:44] to do everybody has some place to go but
[18:47] yet there's a word from the Lord how it
[18:50] wasn't days a Noah so shall it be in the
[18:52] coming of the son of man amen amen where
[18:54] there'll be an elected Bunch where
[18:56] there'll be a make believing bunch where
[18:59] there'll be the sodomite Bunch as it was
[19:01] in the days of Noah so shall it be in
[19:03] the coming of the son of man where do
[19:05] you stand today you better be among that
[19:08] elected Bunch called by God elected by
[19:12] God Sodom was finished isn't that right
[19:14] Hallelujah but the people didn't know it
[19:16] sodam was already judged but he was
[19:19] waiting for to be sentenced and people
[19:21] don't even know it they're being marked
[19:22] right now you're being marked right now
[19:25] by the word marked by your attitude by
[19:28] your SP Spirit isn't that right to
[19:30] what's what being spoken to you by the
[19:31] word that's coming to you we are not
[19:33] here to entertain you we're not here for
[19:35] performance we're here to give you the
[19:37] word of the Lord that is what the sons
[19:40] of God are here for to bring the word
[19:42] because the Bible prophesy in the last
[19:44] day there'll be a famine not for books
[19:46] and tapes not for ministers and
[19:48] preachers but for the hearing of the
[19:50] true word of God are they going to run
[19:52] to the East and the west and the North
[19:53] and the South why would the Bible
[19:55] prophesy of famine in the last days if
[19:58] we have so much Bibles so much churches
[20:00] so much preachers why would the Bible
[20:03] prophesy that there will be a famal last
[20:05] days hallelujah because the word have to
[20:08] come present tense to bring the
[20:10] Breakthrough for the people so I want to
[20:13] read a scripture from Joel it says here
[20:16] this is Joel be not afraid he beast of
[20:18] the field he pass the wildness through
[20:21] spring for the tree bear of fruit the
[20:23] Fig Tree and the vine do yield a
[20:26] strength Hallelujah be then he glad be
[20:28] be glad then he CH of Zion and rejoice
[20:31] in the Lord your God for he had given to
[20:33] you the former rain moderately and he
[20:35] will cause to come down for you the rain
[20:37] the former rain and the latter rain the
[20:39] first month so first God speak to the
[20:42] field isn't that right he said is that
[20:45] right the GL going to be rejoicing isn't
[20:47] that right and the flow shall be full of
[20:49] Wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[20:51] wine and oil and I will restore to you
[20:54] the years that the Lucas had eaten the
[20:57] cankerworm the C pillar and the Palmer
[21:00] worm my great Army which I sent among
[21:02] you and he shall eat in plenty and be
[21:04] satisfied and praise the name of the
[21:06] Lord your God that DWS wondrously with
[21:08] you and my people shall never be ashamed
[21:11] and they shall know that I'm in the
[21:13] midst of Israel that I'm the Lord your
[21:15] God and none else and my people shall
[21:17] never be ashamed it shall come to pass
[21:19] afterwards that I will pour my spirit
[21:22] upon All Flesh and your sons and your
[21:24] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[21:28] shall dream dreams your young men shall
[21:30] see visions and in Revelation 10:8 says
[21:34] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[21:36] spake unto me again and said go and take
[21:38] the little book which is open in the
[21:40] hand of the Angel which standeth upon
[21:42] the sea and upon the Earth and I went
[21:44] unto the angel and said unto him give me
[21:46] the little book he said unto me take it
[21:48] eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter
[21:51] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[21:53] honey and I took the little book out of
[21:55] the Angel's hand and ate it up it was in
[21:58] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[22:00] eaten it my belly was bitter he said
[22:02] unto me down must prophesy again before
[22:05] many peoples and Nations and tongs and
[22:09] Kings may God bless his word oh could we
[22:12] give the Lord some Praises this morning
[22:15] oh hallelujah praise God Amen praise God
[22:20] so you will see some changes you will
[22:22] see some differences because we are
[22:23] still setting the church in order what
[22:26] is out of order will come in order
[22:29] what is good and right we'll keep what
[22:31] is off we will throw out so you're going
[22:33] to see some drastic things done here
[22:35] because we are preparing for a Revival
[22:38] we preparing for power we preparing for
[22:41] Dynamics you have to be a people
[22:42] prepared but today just before the
[22:45] speaker comes to us I want to just share
[22:48] something with you about being restored
[22:51] and the prophet preach a message called
[22:53] the restoration of the brid tree and he
[22:55] give a definition of restore meanings to
[22:57] return to the former owner or return
[23:00] back to the former estate or condition
[23:03] am and he went on to say to bring back
[23:05] to the former owner and if a claim is
[23:08] made on something to make a restoration
[23:11] you can enforce it to make it come back
[23:14] to its right place so he is saying here
[23:18] that once there's a promise of
[23:21] restoration you can enforce a claim to
[23:24] be restored isn't that something do you
[23:28] believe that this morning so we can
[23:31] enforce a claim to be
[23:34] restored that means as a church we could
[23:38] enforce a claim to be
[23:41] restored back to the days of the
[23:45] Apostles that is our right and God sent
[23:48] a prophet to turn our hearts back to the
[23:51] faith of the fathers a church where sin
[23:54] can't even stay in it a church that sin
[23:57] can't even walk into it a different kind
[24:00] of church isn't that right do you
[24:03] believe that so he saying now watch he
[24:06] said no watch to restore means to bring
[24:08] back to restore a claim can be restored
[24:11] to bring anything back to it rightful
[24:13] owner therefore some way it went away
[24:16] from its rifle owner and to restore it
[24:19] to bring it back to who really owns it
[24:22] in order to do this we have a right to
[24:25] enforce if there's a law to enforce C
[24:28] this rightful condition of
[24:32] restoration like if somebody stole a
[24:34] property and they're holding the
[24:35] property captive then you can take the
[24:38] law and go to this person and then
[24:41] enforce this person to restore this
[24:43] property back then we have the privilege
[24:48] to enforce upon Satan the claims that
[24:51] God give us for God has a law and his
[24:54] law is his word and God in his word made
[24:57] certain claims to the church therefore
[25:00] we have a right to enforce these claims
[25:04] upon Satan and said give it back the law
[25:08] of the land is to enforce by the land
[25:11] for the land but the law here we go of
[25:14] the spirit of God is to force Satan to
[25:17] give up that which he has unrightfully
[25:20] and deceitfully taken from God Souls of
[25:24] men he took from God Souls of women he
[25:27] took children
[25:29] sicknesses of the body he placed upon
[25:31] people where God Made Them In His Image
[25:33] to be like him and the church is given
[25:37] the rightful legal rights by the Bible
[25:40] to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this
[25:43] upon them so I want to say this morning
[25:47] that you have a right to be restored if
[25:50] you're sick you have a right to be
[25:52] restored back to good health and
[25:55] strength if you lose your desire you
[25:58] lose your prayer life you need a
[26:00] breakthrough that's your right if you
[26:03] bong you have a right to be delivered
[26:08] that is
[26:11] your right
[26:14] hallelujah hallelujah that is your right
[26:20] for Revival that's your right to have a
[26:23] passion to know the word a hungering and
[26:25] thirst that's your right to be a genuine
[26:30] Christian come on say Amen somebody you
[26:33] don't have to be halfway Hallelujah
[26:36] glory to God
[26:37] Amen oh Hallelujah you may be seated W
[26:41] beong with you brother brandham says God
[26:44] Don't Make halfway Christians God Don't
[26:48] Make halfway ministers God Don't Make
[26:52] halfway preachers but preachers can be
[26:55] halfway oh Christians can be halfway but

[27:02] see he his eyes open up Hallelujah when
[27:05] God say here his air open up God don't

[27:24] Freedom like those guys that broke out
[27:26] of prison and some got free for what
[27:29] half an hour got killed another got free
[27:31] from for 2 three hours and and another
[27:33] got free for 2 days and had to take them
[27:35] back you don't want that kind of Freedom
[27:37] where the devil is behind your back
[27:40] where the devil have a right to take you
[27:41] back into the prison that you once was
[27:44] in you don't want that kind of Freedom
[27:47] you want who the son of man set free is
[27:51] free indeed that there is no way that
[27:55] devil could pull you back in the prison
[27:58] that you were in that is why you come to
[28:01] church that the Holy Spirit could break
[28:05] the fets off of your life oh could we

[28:21] Deliverance total freedom total Liberty
[28:25] total Jubilee we have to agree on the
[28:27] word that word is God not the church is
[28:30] God not the minister is God not the
[28:33] Elder is God we have to agree that the
[28:36] word is God and all of us have to
[28:39] subject ourselves to that word because
[28:41] the word itself is God
[28:44] hallelujah that is why when God came
[28:47] down for Adam he said where are thou he
[28:49] said I'm hiding why he was he hiding
[28:52] because Adam fell from the
[28:54] word hallelujah
[28:58] because sin is what make people hide
[29:00] that's right to cover up Amen to hide it
[29:02] up amen isn't that right praise God but
[29:05] when you understand that God come to
[29:07] shine light amen Oh Glory to God to
[29:10] bring out the darkness out of your life

[29:37] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[29:40] Glory Hallelujah so we want that full
[29:44] commitment to what God Said not what
[29:46] this sister do because that sister could
[29:48] be off the word what God Said not what
[29:51] this brother do because he could be Plum
[29:53] off the word what God Said then your
[29:57] measurement is not brother or a sister
[29:59] your measurement is the word what was
[30:01] spoken by a prophet he was one of the
[30:04] eyes of the Lord Seven eyes going out
[30:07] throughout the
[30:08] Earth hallelujah hallelujah seven eyes
[30:12] to see and he saw every sin in the age
[30:16] and he put it in the books and tapes to
[30:19] expose it that we could be delivered
[30:21] from every sin every condition every
[30:25] situation Oh Glory to God and call us to
[30:28] preach the word regardless of the
[30:30] people's feelings regardless of their
[30:33] emotions regardless if they want to stay
[30:35] in a church or leave the church the
[30:37] commission is to preach the word oh
[30:40] Hallelujah to stay by the word Deacon on
[30:43] no Deacon elder or no Elder minister or
[30:47] no minister to stay with the word

[31:08] could en Force God I want my healing I
[31:11] want my break I come you see if you have
[31:13] no expectation you get what you get and
[31:15] that's the problem people just come and

[31:23] their soul the woman said if I could
[31:25] just touch the Helm of His Garment oh oh
[31:28] my Hallelujah blind Bima said Lord help

[31:36] him and somebody said you're making too
[31:38] much an noise Lord help me he didn't

[32:33] faith hit God God hit Jesus and Jesus
[32:36] came to him and Jesus didn't come and
[32:39] just lay hands upon him and say see
[32:42] because everybody could know the man is
[32:43] blind if a stick everybody know he's
[32:45] blind but Jesus ask a question what is
[32:47] it that you want me to do for
[32:53] you suppose blind but must want a
[32:56] million dollars
[32:58] and a home for the

[33:19] him that connects with what is in your
[33:22] heart Hallelujah that connects with what
[33:25] is in your spirit hallelujah hallelujah

[33:59] angel and say give
[34:01] me the book in other words you have a
[34:05] right come on now come on now maybe you
[34:08] never see that way you have a right to
[34:11] that book hallelujah hallelujah you may
[34:15] be seated it didn't say the preacher
[34:17] have to get the book John represented
[34:20] the bride and the voice told John go to
[34:24] the angel it said who to go to not go to
[34:28] this church go to that church go to that
[34:30] Bishop go to that man go to the
[34:33] Angel and the manifestation of the holy
[34:36] spirit is that angel trying to get the

[34:50] almost done get to the angel get to the
[34:52] book the book have an effect amen
[34:55] hallelujah Pleasure and Pain
[34:58] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God like
[35:01] but ULU preach the book have an effect
[35:03] Pleasure and Pain but you know what the
[35:05] Bible says the Bible called the pain
[35:07] first it's going to be bit in your belly
[35:10] but it going to be sweet in your mouth
[35:12] when you like to talk about it when you
[35:14] like to Fellowship about it when you
[35:15] like to speak it back it sweeten them
[35:17] out but when you have to
[35:20] stand alone stand against your family
[35:23] and friends when you have to stand for
[35:25] what is right when it come down to the
[35:27] Cuts that's where it's bitter when you
[35:29] have to tell the people the truth that's
[35:31] when it's bitter but you ministers here
[35:33] tell them the truth Oh Glory to God
[35:36] hallelujah only the truth which is the
[35:40] [Applause]
[35:42] word then the effect of it is don't must
[35:46] prophesy again prophesy prophesy
[35:51] prophesy why prophesy Hallelujah when
[35:54] it's fulfilled you what to prophesy
[35:56] after 25 years Abra did not prophesy
[35:58] anymore Isaac was born he said this is
[36:01] that that I spoke about for the last 25
[36:03] years it's fulfilled but God put the
[36:07] prophecy to do two things to give the
[36:11] critics something to talk about and to
[36:14] give the man who received the
[36:17] faith a means of character
[36:21] development a mean of growth and
[36:23] maturity which only the trial of your
[36:26] faith can produce
[36:28] nothing else could produce that so when
[36:31] God give a word he gave a time to that
[36:34] word within that time he test to see if
[36:36] you really believe if you truly believe
[36:39] if you're hanging in there regardless
[36:41] and the Bible said Abraham tagger not at
[36:43] the promise of God to unbelief but was
[36:46] strong giv praise to God so Joel said it
[36:49] shall come to pass that young men shall
[36:51] see Visions it shall come to pass that
[36:54] the spirit will bring prophecy again you
[36:57] you have to prophesy that you're going
[36:59] to get a breakthrough today you have to
[37:01] prophesy that you're going to get a
[37:03] Revival today you have to prophesy that
[37:05] you're going to be filled with the Holy
[37:07] Ghost you have to prophesy could we
[37:09] stand and give God a praise offering oh
[37:12] the bride going to prophesy and you

[39:45] Heavenly Father we feel your presence in
[39:47] this
[39:49] place Lord and we cry to you this
[39:53] morning of how much we need you yes Lord
[39:57] is not a want it is not Lord a frivolous
[40:00] desire but it is a need Lord we need you
[40:04] like we need to breathe we need you like
[40:06] Lord without Lord you we have no life we
[40:09] have no strength we have no purpose we
[40:11] are like a ship without a sale Lord I
[40:15] pray this morning that you would speak
[40:17] to your people who have come from the
[40:19] east from the west from the north from
[40:21] the south Lord under expectation for a
[40:25] touch from you Lord we are needy people
[40:29] Lord may you bless the reading of the
[40:30] word may you open the understanding of
[40:33] your people to Lord the time that we are
[40:36] in the the the the graveness the
[40:39] seriousness the the the the the critical
[40:42] time of the moment that this hour that
[40:44] we are in Lord where Lord as the last
[40:47] ticking of that clock of time Fades into
[40:49] eternity father when we break in that
[40:52] kind of a way from the humanistic realm
[40:55] into Revelation divine Revelation and
[40:58] into Vision this morning Father a vision
[41:01] of Revival a vision of an outpouring may
[41:03] you speak to us out of your word may you
[41:06] take me completely out of the way and
[41:08] speak lip to ear to your people may you
[41:10] bless everyone that's here this morning
[41:12] those that are connected on the internet
[41:14] and may you be with us in the precious
[41:16] name of Jesus Christ and the church says
[41:19] amen you may be seated for a few
[41:22] minutes you can keep playing
[41:24] softly you know I was there listening
[41:26] about over speak your appreciate brother
[41:28] over this
[41:31] morning and my mind is blown because
[41:34] just before he started to sing I asked
[41:37] Gideon what key is he in because this is
[41:39] the very same song I wanted to sing when
[41:41] I got up here and he started to singing
[41:43] Because I realize that if your prayer
[41:46] your desire is not I need thee then you
[41:48] have the wrong desire that is my prayer
[41:51] this morning Lord I need thee more than
[41:54] yesterday more than last week more than
[41:56] last month more than last year but this
[41:57] morning Lord I need thee amen you know
[42:00] when I had two different thoughts for
[42:03] this morning and I just feel this
[42:05] morning is a unique day
[42:09] because I had a thought and a brother
[42:11] from another church sent out a quote
[42:12] from the Prophet this morning with the
[42:14] exact same title pretty much that I was
[42:17] going to speak this morning and I was
[42:18] like how could he be connected to the
[42:20] same not so much how but the fact that
[42:23] he is is just such a confirmation of the
[42:25] season and the hour that we are in so I
[42:28] really want to encourage you this
[42:29] morning that as bovit said things are
[42:32] going to be different because we have
[42:33] not passed this way before and when you
[42:36] haven't passed somewhere before
[42:37] everything is new everything is
[42:39] different if you drive down the road on
[42:41] your way home you have seen almost
[42:43] everything before but when you are on a
[42:45] journey when you are seeing all new
[42:47] things you need to walk a certain way
[42:50] because you have not been there before
[42:52] and when you have not been there before
[42:54] you have to depend on leadership because
[42:57] you haven't been there before you can't
[42:59] walk the same way you walked when you
[43:01] haven't been there before because you
[43:03] don't know what lays ahead and if you
[43:07] don't know what lays ahead brother
[43:08] brandom said we ought to be so reverent
[43:11] so careful and I don't know how the
[43:13] service is going to go this morning but
[43:15] it's one of them kind of services I feel
[43:17] it already because there are people in
[43:19] here this morning that I know about who
[43:22] are trapped who are tied up and my
[43:24] desire is to see the chains and the
[43:26] shackles broken we have a responsibility
[43:30] and obligation to preach the word with
[43:32] such Clarity and to bring back what I
[43:34] call Holy fear because people are in
[43:36] church and they don't fear God that's
[43:39] why you do the foolishness sometimes
[43:41] that you do because there is no fear of
[43:44] [Music]
[43:46] God the Bible says that the fear of the
[43:50] Lord is the beginning of the beginning
[43:53] of wisdom that's where wisdom starts so
[43:57] the wisdom of this world and the wisdom
[43:58] of coming to church and the wisdom of
[44:00] being in the message all of that falls
[44:02] down if there is no fear of God because
[44:04] if you fear God you would walk
[44:06] reverently you would be so careful in
[44:08] what you do can the church say Amen how
[44:11] many appreciate brother Anthony for his
[44:12] message last
[44:16] week so I'm going to talk to you a
[44:18] little bit this morning I'm going to
[44:19] preach to you a little bit this morning
[44:21] but I'm depending completely and totally
[44:24] on the Holy Spirit to direct what takes
[44:27] place this morning because we have not
[44:29] been this way before you appreciate the
[44:32] musicians you appreciate the singing
[44:34] this
[44:35] morning well can we stand to our feet I
[44:37] want to appreciate brother the over for
[44:38] the opportunity to speak this morning
[44:41] we're going to go to one scripture this
[44:43] morning from The Book of
[44:45] Romans we're going to read Romans
[44:48] chapter
[44:50] 8 and we're going to read from verse one
[44:53] and we're going to take our time a
[44:54] little bit this morning
[45:02] reading from Romans
[45:05] 8 a reading from verse
[45:09] one there is therefore now no
[45:12] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[45:14] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[45:19] after the spirit for the law of the
[45:22] spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made
[45:25] me free from the law of sin and death
[45:30] for what the law could not do in that it
[45:34] was weak through the flesh God sending
[45:37] his own son in the likeness of sinful
[45:40] flesh and for sin condemn sin in the
[45:44] flesh amen and here is why that the
[45:48] righteousness of the law might be
[45:50] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[45:54] flesh but after the spirit
[45:57] for they that are after The Flesh do
[46:00] mind the things of the flesh but they
[46:03] that are after the spirit the things of
[46:07] the spirit for to be carnally minded is
[46:11] death but to be spiritually minded is
[46:15] life and
[46:17] peace because the carnal mind is enmity
[46:21] against God for it is not subject to the
[46:25] law of God neither indeed can be I want
[46:29] to say that again the carnal mind is
[46:31] enmity against God for it is not subject
[46:35] to the law of God neither indeed cannot
[46:38] be in other words it could never subject
[46:40] itself so if that is the case Paul says
[46:43] so then they that in are in the flesh
[46:46] cannot please God I want to say that
[46:49] again so then they that are in the flesh
[46:53] cannot please God but ye and not in the
[46:57] flesh but in the
[46:59] spirit if so be and this is the
[47:02] condition that the spirit of God dwell
[47:05] in you amen now if any man have not the
[47:09] spirit of Christ he is none of his so
[47:12] here is Paul makes it very clear If any
[47:15] man have not the spirit of Christ he is
[47:19] none of his and if Christ be in you the
[47:24] body is now dead because of sin but the
[47:28] spirit of Life the spirit is life
[47:31] because of righteousness but if the
[47:33] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[47:36] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[47:38] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[47:41] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[47:44] dwelleth in you therefore brethren we
[47:46] are debtors not to the flesh to live
[47:50] after the flesh for if we live after the
[47:53] flesh ye shall die but if ye through
[47:56] through the spirit do
[47:59] mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall
[48:03] live for as many as are led by the
[48:06] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[48:09] for ye have not received the spirit of
[48:11] bondage again to fear but ye have
[48:13] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[48:16] we cry ABA father the spirit itself
[48:20] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[48:22] are the children of God and if children
[48:25] then is is of God and joined ears with
[48:28] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[48:32] that we may be also glorified together
[48:36] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[48:38] present time are not worthy to be
[48:40] compared with the glory which shall be
[48:43] revealed in us for the earnest
[48:46] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[48:48] the manifestation of the sons of God may
[48:51] the Lord add a blessing to the reading
[48:53] of his word let us bow our heads once
[48:55] more Heavenly Father any man could read
[48:57] the scripture but it takes the Holy
[48:59] Spirit to bring it to life may you speak
[49:01] to your people this morning Lord walk
[49:04] out the pages of the Bible and set your
[49:06] people free this morning take me out of
[49:08] the way completely and deliver your
[49:10] people in the precious name of Jesus
[49:12] Christ and the church says am and the
[49:14] church says amen amen you may be seated
[49:17] this morning so I have a title this
[49:20] morning and my title is led by the
[49:23] spirit Hallelujah and my subject the
[49:25] Holy Spirit the comforter the guide and
[49:29] my inspiration we have not passed this
[49:32] way before can the church say Amen so
[49:36] this morning we're going to start in
[49:37] Genesis because brother bandam taught us
[49:39] the two books in the Bible that the
[49:40] devil hates the most at Genesis and
[49:44] Revelation because Genesis is where it
[49:46] all began and Revelation defines where
[49:49] it all ends but to understand the root
[49:51] cause of a problem you have to go back
[49:53] to the beginning so we're going to go
[49:55] back to Genesis for a few minutes this
[49:56] morning where in Genesis 1 and in
[49:59] Genesis 2 God is beginning the creation
[50:02] process he's putting things in place he
[50:04] said let there be light and let there be
[50:07] animals and let there be everything
[50:09] trees and everything everything the fish
[50:10] and everything and man is created in
[50:13] Genesis 1 and 2 first the spirit man and
[50:15] then the flesh man and man is in the
[50:17] image of God and that man is led by the
[50:20] spirit that man doesn't know anything
[50:23] about the flesh that man doesn't know
[50:25] anything about lust and Temptation and
[50:27] headaches and being up and he doesn't
[50:29] know anything about that he is led by
[50:32] the spirit his every desire is Con is is
[50:35] controlled by the spirit his every
[50:37] motive is controlled by the holy spirit
[50:41] because he is made in the image of these
[50:43] Spirits because God is a spirit and that
[50:46] great spirit says let us make man in our
[50:48] image so that man could not have gone
[50:50] against God in that form because he was
[50:53] just like his father can the church say
[50:56] amen so that man in Genesis 1 and
[50:58] Genesis 2 he couldn't make a mistake he
[51:01] couldn't get depressed he didn't know
[51:02] what it was to be frustrated everything
[51:05] was in order and God the Bible said he
[51:08] was
[51:08] pleased he was pleased with the trees he
[51:11] was pleased with where the sun was he
[51:13] was pleased where the stars was he was
[51:16] pleased by the fact that Adam couldn't
[51:17] get sick he was pleased by the fact that
[51:20] Adam was just like him he was happy
[51:22] because when he come down to talk to
[51:24] Adam Adam wanted to talk to him he was
[51:26] pleased the animals did what they were
[51:28] supposed to do the fishes did what they
[51:31] were supposed to do there was no
[51:32] conflict there was no confusion there
[51:35] was nothing out of order everything was
[51:37] in order because God is a god of order
[51:40] he's a god of structure he's a god of
[51:42] systems and the closer you get to God
[51:45] the more in order your life becomes the
[51:48] less chaos you're going to have in your
[51:50] life when you get closer to God somebody
[51:52] say
[51:54] amen hallelujah
[51:58] everything everything is in order and
[52:01] God decides to operate as a surgeon he I
[52:05] believe it's an anesthesiologist you
[52:07] call it the one who puts you to sleep
[52:08] and make sure there's no pain and the
[52:10] great
[52:11] anesthesiologist puts Adam to ped and
[52:14] puts him to rest and gives him an
[52:16] injection so he feels nothing and from
[52:18] Adam God becomes the first surgeon the
[52:21] first surgery ever created God Cuts Adam
[52:24] open and and extracts a rib and from
[52:26] that rib God in morph he changed himself
[52:28] again as the great Builder and out of
[52:30] man he puts a woman and the two as one
[52:33] in Genesis 1 and two God creates the
[52:35] first institution the first company
[52:37] called marriage and he said who God
[52:39] joined together let no man put a son up
[52:42] Genesis 1 Genesis 2 there is no problem
[52:45] you can't find an issue there's no
[52:47] argument Adam do have to go and argue
[52:49] with Eve and wonder what Eve is doing
[52:52] Eve is in order Adam is in order God
[52:54] speaks to Adam Adam sh it with Eve
[52:57] there's no confusion there's no
[52:59] disrespect Adam loves his wife Eve
[53:05] respects can the church say amen I don't
[53:07] hear you this morning we're going back
[53:09] to beginning that's why the devil hates
[53:12] Genesis because when when we go back to
[53:14] Genesis there's no room for man there's
[53:16] no room for interpretation it's just God
[53:19] and Adam listen you may be seated Adam
[53:22] didn't name himself God called him Adam
[53:25] in other words name in is part of
[53:27] relationship so because God knew who he
[53:29] was God say Adam listen everything
[53:32] starts right there and when god named
[53:34] him even though God knew in the back
[53:37] part of his mind what was going to
[53:38] happen you cannot separate a father from
[53:41] his son you cannot break you cannot
[53:44] break you cannot break the relationship
[53:47] between Father and Son and I don't care
[53:49] what you went through this week last
[53:51] week last month that relationship you
[53:54] have a name there's a name that that you
[53:56] have you don't know it yet but you come
[53:59] from God you come from God made in the
[54:02] image of God this has nothing to do with
[54:04] man this has nothing to do with church
[54:07] this is you and your father this is you
[54:09] and your father you couldn't come here
[54:11] this morning unless your father draw you
[54:13] here you were led by the spirit you were
[54:16] led by the spirit I can't hear you this
[54:19] morning you were led by the spirit if
[54:22] the spirit didn't lead you you couldn't
[54:24] be here this morning because no could
[54:26] come unless the father draws him and God
[54:29] the father he's a spirit and he is here
[54:32] this morning you can see him with your
[54:34] eyes but the manifestation of the holy
[54:37] spirit is that angel and he's calling
[54:40] this morning come out of sin come out of
[54:43] lust come out of depression come out of
[54:45] your frustration come out of what you in
[55:00] Hallelujah I'm just laying a
[55:02] foundation Hall I want to be led by the
[55:05] Holy Spirit I have some notes here but
[55:07] I'm very willing to come off of my notes
[55:10] because he's the one who's driving the
[55:11] car I'm in the passenger seat this
[55:13] morning I want Jesus to take the wheel I
[55:16] want him to drive me where we need to go
[55:19] because he has been this way before
[55:21] because he has made every way I have not
[55:23] been this way before but if Jesus is in
[55:25] the drive a seat I don't care where this
[55:27] car goes if Jesus is driving I could
[55:30] sleep in the car you know there are some
[55:32] people when they driving you can't risk
[55:34] falling asleep because you know they're
[55:36] not too good of a driver but if Jesus is
[55:39] driving the car I'm taking my seat all
[55:42] the way back because he's been this way
[55:45] before he felt what we felt he was
[55:47] tempted like we were tempted he was
[55:49] bruised he knows your pain he knows your
[55:52] struggle there's nothing you go through
[55:55] that he can't ident identify with and he
[55:57] didn't sin because he was the second
[56:00] [Applause]
[56:02] Adam Hallelujah you may be seated I'm
[56:06] still trying to warm up here I done
[56:08] jumped all over my notes already I reach
[56:10] the second Adam and I'm trying to speak
[56:11] about the first
[56:15] [Applause]
[56:15] [Music]
[56:17] one so in Genesis 1 and 2 man is in the
[56:21] image of God hallelujah when he looked
[56:22] in the mirror I don't know what kind of
[56:24] mirror he had but maybe he looked in the
[56:26] lake
[56:26] and when he looked he saw
[56:28] something he say I look like my
[56:32] father Hallelujah in the image of God
[56:35] you couldn't tell the difference between
[56:37] him and his father because he was a chip
[56:38] off the old block they had relationship
[56:42] they had Fellowship they had communion
[56:44] but AB Bram used the words Divine
[56:46] Fellowship that's a different kind of
[56:49] relationship that's not a hell how you
[56:51] going kind of friendship but that's in
[56:52] the cool of the evening God would come
[56:55] down and he would have communion with
[56:58] Adam it wasn't on a Sunday only it
[57:00] wasn't Wednesday night only it wasn't
[57:02] Thursday night only but every day at a
[57:06] certain time God himself would come down
[57:10] because God was alone and he wanted
[57:13] fellowship and Adam existed as an
[57:16] amateur God to have that fellowship with
[57:18] God because God has certain thoughts and
[57:21] a thought once it express becomes words
[57:24] but there was nobody to hear the words
[57:25] so God had to create somebody that he
[57:28] could speak to and that's what he's
[57:30] doing this morning he's speaking to
[57:32] somebody because God don't want to talk
[57:33] in a room by himself he's to give us
[57:36] somebody who's looking for a
[57:38] [Applause]
[57:42] [Music]
[57:43] [Applause]
[57:45] relationship you may be seated led by
[57:49] the spirit there was never a time where
[57:53] Adam felt like you know what this
[57:55] evening I don't think I want to talk to
[57:57] God no there was never a time where Adam
[58:00] say well this evening I don't talk to
[58:02] him yesterday I talked to him the day
[58:04] before I think I'm going to go out with
[58:06] e this evening and we going to cut some
[58:08] coconuts and we going to have our own
[58:10] little private dinner no because he was
[58:12] led by the spirit it was normal for Adam
[58:15] to make it his business to be available
[58:18] so when he heard the voice walking in
[58:20] the garden he could say Lord here I am
[58:23] I've been looking for you too because
[58:25] this is what I did this this morning and
[58:27] this is what I did today and this stream
[58:29] was coming here but when I took a selfie
[58:31] with the stream I wanted to move it a
[58:33] little bit this way and I move the
[58:34] stream and I wanted a lion on the
[58:36] backdrop and I wanted a giraffe next to
[58:38] him and a sheep right there
[58:41] and they had
[58:46] Fellowship but then something
[58:50] happened Genesis 3 something Hallelujah
[58:54] takes place Hallelujah and the Bible
[58:57] talks about the serpent being the most
[58:58] subtle and you know it but this is the
[59:01] part I want to get to because the
[59:04] fellowship the communion the desire you
[59:08] know how much of an effort it is for you
[59:09] to come here this
[59:11] morning how much of a struggle it is for
[59:14] you to just to wake up in the morning
[59:16] you are a problem for the devil just to
[59:17] wake up you know when you wake up it's
[59:19] like oh
[59:21] gosh and for you to make it a service
[59:23] this morning all hell is against you
[59:25] amen the devil send drivers with bad
[59:27] drives he sent all kind of problems to
[59:29] make sure you get here as upset as
[59:31] possible and you can't receive anything
[59:33] but when you're in the spirit all of a
[59:34] sudden things open up to you and Adam
[59:37] knew what it was to be in the
[59:40] spirit Hallelujah but then one day he
[59:42] comes home and Hallelujah Eve is not in
[59:46] position and Adam fell and the Bible say
[59:49] and this is the one of the most
[59:51] heartbreaking scriptures in the Book of
[59:54] Genesis and they heard the voice
[59:57] voice they heard the voice of the Lord
[1:00:00] Walking In The Garden in the cool of the
[1:00:03] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[1:00:10] from the presence of the Lord God
[1:00:14] amongst the Trees of the
[1:00:16] garden and the Lord God called unto Adam
[1:00:19] and said unto him where art
[1:00:22] thou and this is Adam's response I heard
[1:00:25] thy voice in the garden and I was afraid
[1:00:29] this is the first time the word fear is
[1:00:32] found in
[1:00:33] scripture all the time in Genesis 1 and
[1:00:36] 2 there is no fear there is just
[1:00:38] communion but all of a sudden Adam say I
[1:00:40] heard your voice and it didn't feel the
[1:00:42] same way I was
[1:00:44] afraid because I was
[1:00:47] naked and I hid myself and I was as I
[1:00:51] was reading this and I shared this in
[1:00:54] Deo mountain and in canopia
[1:00:57] that sentence is so
[1:00:59] powerful Adam and his wife hid
[1:01:02] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[1:01:05] you would expect if something goes wrong
[1:01:07] in your life you would run towards the
[1:01:12] presence of God but this was not the
[1:01:14] case but AB Bram said it should have
[1:01:16] been Adam saying Lord Lord Where Art
[1:01:19] Thou but here it is God is hunting for
[1:01:22] Adam because Adam because because of his
[1:01:26] sin is now afraid the Shina Glory which
[1:01:30] covered him is no longer there because
[1:01:32] he had just broken the Covenant amen
[1:01:35] with God amen amen and his nakedness
[1:01:38] that exposure that feeling of doing
[1:01:40] something that was wrong led him to go
[1:01:43] and hide and God is now on to hunt for
[1:01:46] him that hunt friends is not Adam's
[1:01:49] physical location God wasn't trying to
[1:01:51] get a GPS tracker to figure out where
[1:01:53] Adam was
[1:01:56] the question was Adam where are you in
[1:02:01] spirit that's right Adam where are you
[1:02:04] because the last time we spoke this is
[1:02:06] not how you were
[1:02:08] acting Adam where are you this morning
[1:02:11] because you're usually in your prayer
[1:02:14] closet but I didn't hear anything from
[1:02:17] you Adam where are you where are you at
[1:02:20] Adam maybe your friends know where
[1:02:22] you're at maybe your neighbor know where
[1:02:24] at Eve certainly knows where at go
[1:02:26] you're hiding together but I'm looking
[1:02:28] for you Adam Adam where are you this
[1:02:32] morning I want you to picture it Adam
[1:02:35] who is an amateur God who had all his
[1:02:37] power all of a sudden he feels stripped
[1:02:40] he feels naked he feels exposed the joy
[1:02:43] he once felt he no longer feels and he's
[1:02:45] now hiding in the trees hiding in a
[1:02:48] place that he doesn't want to be seen
[1:02:50] and and I say today there are people who
[1:02:52] are hiding from church and hiding in
[1:02:54] church
[1:02:56] hiding out that's right because their
[1:02:58] life is not in order hiding out because
[1:03:01] something is wrong and God is screaming
[1:03:03] out the same cry that he said back then
[1:03:05] Adam wear down this morning you're not
[1:03:08] where you are supposed to be spiritually
[1:03:11] you're supposed to be in Authority
[1:03:13] you're supposed to be on fire you're
[1:03:15] supposed to be prayed up you're supposed
[1:03:16] to be desperate you're supposed to be
[1:03:19] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:21] you're supposed to be led by the spirit
[1:03:23] because the Holy Spirit wouldn't lead
[1:03:25] you to
[1:03:26] From Me
[1:03:28] Adam where are you this
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:33] morning
[1:03:36] friends Adam was
[1:03:39] afraid Adam was hiding and he was hiding
[1:03:42] because he didn't know something he was
[1:03:44] hiding because he really thought his
[1:03:46] life was over he was hiding because he
[1:03:49] felt bad about what happened in his life
[1:03:52] and you know what brother brandham said
[1:03:53] people lose the sensitivity to the holy
[1:03:55] Holy Spirit there's something wrong with
[1:03:58] your Christian Journey if you find
[1:04:00] yourself doing the wrong things and you
[1:04:02] don't feel bad about
[1:04:04] [Applause]
[1:04:07] it Adam fell and he felt so bad he went
[1:04:11] and hide because he knew that his
[1:04:13] condition wasn't fit to even be in the
[1:04:16] presence of
[1:04:18] God he had been wrapped in the Shina
[1:04:20] Glory but the sin of his mistakes had
[1:04:24] broken the relation relationship and he
[1:04:26] wasn't free that's why when you see
[1:04:28] people come to church and they can't
[1:04:29] shout and they can't worship you're not
[1:04:31] free I don't care what you tell me how
[1:04:33] much books you read if you can't worship
[1:04:35] there's no Freedom Hallelujah and if you
[1:04:38] are not free God is crying out Adam
[1:04:40] where are you this morning because
[1:04:42] there's stuff in your life that got to
[1:04:44] be dealt with so that we can reestablish
[1:04:46] communication and reestablish Fellowship
[1:04:49] because God always wanted Fellowship
[1:04:52] somebody say Amen
[1:04:57] hallelujah
[1:04:59] hallelujah Adam is hiding and God is
[1:05:01] looking the voice of God walking through
[1:05:03] the garden and Adam don't know how to
[1:05:05] respond and butam brought it so
[1:05:07] beautifully he said that Adam didn't
[1:05:08] even know there was Grace for his
[1:05:10] situation because he had not been that
[1:05:12] way before he didn't he didn't know that
[1:05:14] there was a provision made for him
[1:05:17] before the foundation of the world the
[1:05:19] voice of God was walking through the
[1:05:22] garden and listen God is a god of
[1:05:24] judgment but on that day that that
[1:05:27] judgment seat blood was splashed on the
[1:05:30] Judgment seat that Adam knew nothing
[1:05:32] about Adam didn't know that there was
[1:05:35] Grace for his situation Adam did not
[1:05:37] know that he could come out of hiding
[1:05:40] Adam didn't realize that the blood the
[1:05:42] lamb was slain before the foundation of
[1:05:45] the world
[1:05:48] before you may be
[1:05:50] seated understand this God operates on a
[1:05:54] need to know basis there are some things
[1:05:57] you don't need to know but when you need
[1:05:59] to know it that's when he reveals it
[1:06:02] Luther only needed to know the J shall
[1:06:05] live by faith he wasn't he didn't have
[1:06:07] the security clearance to know anything
[1:06:10] more than that but when Wesley came he
[1:06:12] had to know what Luther knew and his
[1:06:15] security clearance was a little higher
[1:06:17] and he said listen sanctify yourself and
[1:06:20] the Pentecostals they got to know a
[1:06:22] little more and by the pum he brought a
[1:06:24] whole scroll to reveal the whole
[1:06:26] Revelation the whole mystery that
[1:06:29] there's blood on the mercy seat for your
[1:06:31] problems there's blood on the mercy
[1:06:36] seat and this morning there's power in
[1:06:39] the blood there's power in the blood
[1:06:42] there's power in the blood there's power
[1:06:44] in the blood you may be seated you may
[1:06:48] be seated oh somebody's going to go free
[1:06:50] this morning Hallelujah I'm not talking
[1:06:53] about power in the church I'm not
[1:06:55] talking about power in the preacher I'm
[1:06:56] not here to present a Ministry to you
[1:06:58] I'm here to present the blood because if
[1:07:00] it wasn't for the blood you wouldn't be
[1:07:02] here this morning I wouldn't be here
[1:07:04] this morning there's power in the blood
[1:07:06] for your son there's power in the blood
[1:07:08] for your situation there's power in the
[1:07:10] blood for your fornication there's power
[1:07:13] in the blood for your adultery there's
[1:07:15] power in the
[1:07:17] blood and this blood will never lose its
[1:07:21] power it's because of the blood you
[1:07:23] could be healed it's because of the
[1:07:25] blood you could be delivered it's
[1:07:26] because of the blood you can lift your
[1:07:28] hands it's not because of you you are in
[1:07:31] hiding like Adam was in hiding but God
[1:07:34] was saying Adam Adam where are you you
[1:07:36] don't know that there's blood for you
[1:07:38] now I'm letting you know you didn't need
[1:07:40] to know it before but this morning
[1:07:42] there's a mercy seat I brought grace to
[1:07:45] you I brought Mercy to you I
[1:07:52] he
[1:07:53] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:07:56] you may be seated Hallelujah friends
[1:08:00] it's a judgment seat the moment you mess
[1:08:02] up the moment you make a mistake it's a
[1:08:05] judgment seat because every action has a
[1:08:08] consequence you don't play with God
[1:08:10] that's why I say there's no Godly fear
[1:08:12] God could kill you for coming in here
[1:08:14] with unconfessed sin butam said don't
[1:08:16] walk into a prayer line if there's sin
[1:08:18] in your life because God can strike you
[1:08:20] dead it's a judgment seat but there's
[1:08:23] blood there is blood
[1:08:26] Splash on the on the Judgment seat which
[1:08:30] makes it a mercy seat and we are under
[1:08:32] Mercy this morning there's Mercy for you
[1:08:35] there's Mercy for your family without
[1:08:37] this Mercy you don't stand a
[1:08:39] [Applause]
[1:08:43] chance
[1:08:44] hallelujah
[1:08:46] hallelujah
[1:08:48] hallelujah so you could come out of
[1:08:50] hiding this morning you could come out
[1:08:52] to be identified God felt so hurt here
[1:08:55] it is he's looking for his son he's
[1:08:57] looking for his son in his usual
[1:08:59] position he looking for his son in his
[1:09:02] usual state but his son because of guilt
[1:09:05] because of shame because of condemnation
[1:09:07] didn't feel comfortable to worship to
[1:09:10] communicate to fellowship and whenever
[1:09:12] you feel your prayer life is under
[1:09:15] pressure and you can talk and you can
[1:09:17] worship and you can express it means
[1:09:19] there's something that's been uncovered
[1:09:21] but if you get the shikina glory to come
[1:09:24] over you again and if you could plead
[1:09:26] the blood on your house and plead the
[1:09:28] blood on your life you could now
[1:09:30] reconnect the phone because Jesus he
[1:09:33] didn't disconnect the phone line we are
[1:09:35] the ones who disconnect the lines but
[1:09:37] there's blood tonight to repair the line
[1:09:40] there's blood to repair the
[1:09:42] communication because I see the blood
[1:09:44] I'm going to pass over your problem I'm
[1:09:46] going to pass over your sin I should
[1:09:48] have killed you a long time but there's
[1:09:50] blood this morning and when I look to
[1:09:52] the blood I see you as a Revival group I
[1:09:55] see you on the way to the Rapture I see
[1:09:58] you on the way to the resurrection if
[1:10:00] there was no blood you wouldn't make it
[1:10:02] but when I look through the blood
[1:10:04] there's a possibility there is a
[1:10:06] possibility there's a
[1:10:08] [Applause]
[1:10:18] possibility
[1:10:20] [Music]
[1:10:22] huah Hallelujah
[1:10:25] Power in the Blood Power in the Blood
[1:10:29] people in the message they don't know
[1:10:30] about the blood people in the message
[1:10:32] forget about Jesus they're so caught up
[1:10:34] in Doctrine and teachings and and I
[1:10:36] something came to me in the car coming
[1:10:38] up the more Revelation you get the
[1:10:41] simpler everything
[1:10:43] becomes I say that again the more
[1:10:46] Revelation you get the simpler
[1:10:49] everything becomes because God doesn't
[1:10:51] need you to have a degree to understand
[1:10:54] his majesty he doesn't need you to be
[1:10:56] educated to know that he loves you you
[1:10:59] don't need to be able to write your name
[1:11:01] to know that he died for you if you
[1:11:03] could just get a revelation that you
[1:11:05] were facing judgment but then mercy said
[1:11:09] no what is your name can you write it I
[1:11:12] can't write my name but Mercy said no
[1:11:14] your honor I don't know I don't know I
[1:11:17] don't know how to do anything but Mercy
[1:11:19] is speaking on my behalf this morning
[1:11:22] and you got to let me go because Mercy
[1:11:25] said Mercy said Mercy said Mercy
[1:11:30] [Applause]
[1:11:36] said I challenge you this morning God is
[1:11:39] not going to lose one he's not going to
[1:11:41] lose one he's not going to lose one so

[1:12:52] brought the best he didn't bring no bad
[1:12:54] fruits there being no bad orange and bad
[1:12:56] apple he took the best he had but he
[1:12:58] missed the Revelation and here it is

[1:14:35] blood from the sacrifices was to cover
[1:14:38] their sin because they were uncovered it
[1:14:41] was just to cover their sin but that was
[1:14:43] not what God's plan was his plan was to
[1:14:46] take away sin not to cover up cover up
[1:14:50] cover up God was tired of covering up

[1:19:33] morning you may be
[1:19:36] [Applause]
[1:19:46] seated hallu
[1:19:58] H what are you saying but I
[1:20:02] say we are back to the leadership of the
[1:20:05] spirit on every matter hallu on every
[1:20:08] situation when we get back to the Bible
[1:20:11] every situation has to go back to the
[1:20:15] scripture it's no longer what we think
[1:20:18] it is what we feel it is it has to be
[1:20:21] tested by the scripture can the church
[1:20:24] chch say amen and listen amen a lot of
[1:20:27] people say well the Lord led
[1:20:31] me to do this and to do
[1:20:35] that that's a dangerous thing to
[1:20:38] say if what you're saying doesn't line
[1:20:40] up with the word because effectively you
[1:20:43] are lying on
[1:20:49] God and a lying tongue is one of the
[1:20:52] thing God hates right
[1:20:55] people lying on the Holy Ghost lying on
[1:20:58] the Holy Spirit the Lord led me the Lord
[1:21:01] will never lead you to do anything
[1:21:02] that's not in the
[1:21:06] scripture Hallelujah I got to say that
[1:21:08] again huj the Lord will never lead you
[1:21:12] to do anything that is against the Bible
[1:21:16] I don't care who you
[1:21:18] are because even brother branham's
[1:21:20] Ministry was limited by scripture
[1:21:25] amen because the Bible is the template
[1:21:27] for
[1:21:29] everything nothing can happen outside of
[1:21:32] scripture amen
[1:21:35] hallelujah amen so I'm challenging you
[1:21:38] now when we speak about being led by the
[1:21:40] spirit you have to have confirmation
[1:21:42] that you're led by the spirit and the
[1:21:44] confirmation has to be in the word not
[1:21:47] your interpretation of the word or your
[1:21:50] limited understanding of the word
[1:21:52] because our understanding can only be
[1:21:54] limited until God opens it you can't
[1:21:56] open it
[1:21:58] studying let me say that again your
[1:22:00] understanding cannot be opened by your
[1:22:02] own
[1:22:03] studying you have to study to show
[1:22:05] yourself approv but God is the one who
[1:22:07] opens understanding because he is the
[1:22:09] one as the
[1:22:11] revealer that's to bust the
[1:22:13] intellectuals in the message who feel
[1:22:15] studying from 8 to 4 every day suddenly
[1:22:18] makes you an authority on the
[1:22:21] prophet amen amen the only Authority on
[1:22:24] the prophet is
[1:22:27] God and only he can reveal the hidden
[1:22:30] things in there not by your studying but
[1:22:32] by you being predestinated to receive
[1:22:35] something from
[1:22:36] God and that's why I say this morning
[1:22:39] you could not even be here this morning
[1:22:41] unless you were led by the
[1:22:45] spirit can the church say
[1:22:50] Amen some I find myself in these grooves
[1:22:53] at times I was telling about o yesterday
[1:22:56] my wife was you know just quickly saying
[1:22:59] a few things about the way the ministers
[1:23:01] here speak she said brother Anthony
[1:23:03] loves to say there's more to you than me
[1:23:05] the
[1:23:08] ey and you said well brother o loves to
[1:23:11] say the devil cannot get stronger but
[1:23:13] you can so I was waiting to hear what
[1:23:16] you said about
[1:23:17] me she said and when you go up there
[1:23:19] you're saying not this church not this
[1:23:21] church
[1:23:24] suddenly I've come like the hatchet
[1:23:27] man coming with the Bazooka not this
[1:23:30] church pow po pow God's going to have a
[1:23:33] clean church a church in
[1:23:35] order but the gifts have to come
[1:23:37] together and work in harmony because we
[1:23:40] going to have a perfect Church listen I
[1:23:43] am the kind of person personal testimony
[1:23:45] I am either doing something or I'm not
[1:23:48] you don't get 70% from me it's 100% or
[1:23:52] zero
[1:23:54] I have two speeds zero or 100 I told my
[1:23:57] wife before we got before we got married

[1:24:02] doing this amen if I'm not doing it I'm
[1:24:04] not doing it
[1:24:06] amen so the fact that I'm doing this
[1:24:08] means I'm in it
[1:24:10] [Applause]
[1:24:14] 100%
[1:24:15] 40% I said to her listen I said listen
[1:24:18] if this marriage fails it's not because
[1:24:19] of me cuz I'm in it

[1:29:11] walk you will
[1:29:14] fall if you are out of Fellowship I
[1:29:16] don't care how much you read and study
[1:29:18] if you are out of Fellowship because
[1:29:20] Fellowship in the world is put there for
[1:29:22] a purpose
[1:29:24] you spend all your time with co-workers
[1:29:26] and friends on the street or friends in
[1:29:28] the school eventually those voices will
[1:29:31] have an influence and I say to the young
[1:29:34] people the devil is not going to come to
[1:29:35] you and tell you hey smoke this
[1:29:38] now he's going to come a little some
[1:29:40] easier we go and smoke you don't have to
[1:29:42] smoke but just come with us
[1:29:45] amen amen and slowly your defenses break
[1:29:49] down until you say wait a
[1:29:51] minute and you don't find nothing is
[1:29:53] wrong with
[1:29:55] it but brandom taught it like this he
[1:29:58] said if you have a question about doing
[1:30:01] something don't to do
[1:30:03] it I don't want to lay that down in the
[1:30:06] church this
[1:30:07] morning not this church lay it down in
[1:30:10] the
[1:30:12] church don't play games with your
[1:30:22] soul we have a respon responsibility to
[1:30:25] say things to you effectively without
[1:30:29] any ambiguity that's right to make sure
[1:30:32] it is very clear and but brandom said it
[1:30:35] like this he said if you are in a church
[1:30:37] and the church stands for a certain
[1:30:39] something and you are in the church then
[1:30:41] you are supposed to stand with
[1:30:43] it so if we say in this church Brothers
[1:30:47] don't do this or we do this if you are
[1:30:49] in this church you have to line up with
[1:30:51] it or you can find another church this
[1:30:54] church has never been about come now
[1:30:56] come come come do you want no God has an
[1:30:59] order God has a structure you are free
[1:31:02] because you don't belong to brother you
[1:31:04] don't belong to the ministers you belong
[1:31:06] to
[1:31:07] God and sheep are meant to be led so if
[1:31:10] you are in a leadership position then
[1:31:12] you have to question whether or not you
[1:31:13] are
[1:31:14] sheep because if you are sheep you
[1:31:16] supposed to be led by the Holy Spirit
[1:31:18] and that's what we are speaking on this
[1:31:19] morning to be led by the spirit and but
[1:31:22] the Bram challenged Bram Tabernacle he
[1:31:24] said check it by the word
[1:31:27] yourself check it by the scriptures
[1:31:30] yourself so that you know where you're
[1:31:34] standing can the church say
[1:31:37] Amen we are going to have a CH we're
[1:31:39] going to turn the heat up seven times
[1:31:42] hotter because that's the conditions for
[1:31:44] sin not to stay in the
[1:31:47] church can the church say amen
[1:31:52] hallelujah brother B say in return and
[1:31:54] Jubilee the church is a born against
[1:31:57] born again bunch of Believers that's in
[1:32:00] Christ by the Holy Ghost led by the
[1:32:03] spirit of God they are not of the world
[1:32:06] Hallelujah they are out of the world
[1:32:09] they are different from the world so
[1:32:11] friends if all of the stuff you do is
[1:32:14] like the world there's something wrong
[1:32:16] because you are supposed to look
[1:32:18] different talk different walk different
[1:32:21] act different I'm supposed to be able to
[1:32:22] identify you from a mile
[1:32:24] away
[1:32:26] [Applause]
[1:32:30] halll it's good word or hallelujah
[1:32:33] hallelujah when you give people the jump
[1:32:36] shout joy everybody say yes that's me
[1:32:38] but when it comes on to living the life
[1:32:40] the reality of life on the Monday
[1:32:43] Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday when
[1:32:45] you are not fortifying yourself because
[1:32:47] God gave Joshua the conditions for good
[1:32:50] success read and pray every day meditate
[1:32:53] on the word day and
[1:32:55] [Applause]
[1:32:57] night and like any discipline in life if
[1:33:00] you don't make time if you are in school
[1:33:02] and you don't study you're not going to
[1:33:04] achieve anything how do you expect to
[1:33:06] achieve as a Christian because butam
[1:33:09] taught us God Don't Make halfway
[1:33:11] Christians God Don't Make halfway
[1:33:13] preachers but we are the ones based on
[1:33:15] how we live manifest a certain something
[1:33:18] if you don't work at your marriage it
[1:33:20] will fail if you don't work at your
[1:33:22] schooling it will fail if you don't work
[1:33:24] at Defending Your Life it will
[1:33:26] fail you want to buy a house you have to
[1:33:29] save that takes discipline it takes time
[1:33:31] you want to be a real Christian but the
[1:33:33] Bram said the tutor monitors the
[1:33:35] behavior of the son and after a while
[1:33:38] reports back to the father hey on a
[1:33:41] Monday he does this on a Tuesday he does
[1:33:43] this on a Wednesday he does this I think
[1:33:45] this son is worthy to be
[1:33:47] adopted it's not your conduct when
[1:33:50] you're in the church Hallelujah come on
[1:33:52] now say that again it's not your conduct
[1:33:55] when you are in the church in everybody
[1:33:57] here saying right now
[1:33:59] you we see Monday when you change your
[1:34:01] outfit and you put the hair all the way
[1:34:03] up
[1:34:08] and and you listen to all kind of music
[1:34:11] but brother Isaac we the message for a
[1:34:13] long time why he saying this kind of
[1:34:14] stuff because it's the reality of the
[1:34:15] attack the devil hasn't changed his his
[1:34:17] tactics it's still music it's still the
[1:34:20] boy in the world it's still the girl in
[1:34:22] the world it's still the woman and the
[1:34:23] job it's still the man in the job it's
[1:34:25] still the clothes it's still the lust
[1:34:27] it's the same
[1:34:28] demons so we will call it what it is
[1:34:31] because big people who supposed to be in
[1:34:33] the message for a long time still doing
[1:34:36] [Applause]
[1:34:38] foolishness when I was a child I spake
[1:34:40] as a child understood as a child acted
[1:34:43] as a child but when I became a
[1:34:45] man 40 going on
[1:34:48] 12 45 going on 16 52 going on 18 when
[1:34:53] will we grow up as Christians and accept
[1:34:56] responsibility because when Adam got
[1:34:58] cornered Adam where at TH well I hiding
[1:35:01] because and is a
[1:35:04] woman his first action is not Lord I
[1:35:06] have sinned I know what I did was wrong

[1:35:14] woman no but it's you if you didn't give
[1:35:16] me h i mean be in this position wow man
[1:35:20] it is the nature of man to pass on
[1:35:22] responsibility hallah hallah and blame

[1:35:44] it when will you accept responsibility I
[1:35:47] did not tell my wife I love her for the
[1:35:48] whole
[1:35:50] week whose job I supposed to come and
[1:35:52] tell every husband he you tell why you
[1:35:54] love hallelujah hallelujah Mercy hall
[1:36:03] Hall but over and I were in a meeting
[1:36:06] and I was saying you know and I'm
[1:36:07] preaching to the church so those who are
[1:36:08] connected God bless you I'm having a
[1:36:10] time this morning Hallelujah but I'm
[1:36:13] saying that people create such false
[1:36:15] expectations Hallelujah and when you
[1:36:17] come to church you have to expect
[1:36:20] certain things from the ministry we have
[1:36:22] a responsibility but you also have a
[1:36:25] responsibility and a lot of parents say
[1:36:27] well it's youth Ministries
[1:36:28] responsibility to do X Y and Z and you
[1:36:30] don't talk to your children you don't
[1:36:32] fellowship with your children you don't
[1:36:33] say hey how are you
[1:36:36] doing how is life is there anything is
[1:36:39] there anything with thing I can help you
[1:36:41] with whose responsibility is that have
[1:36:45] to come to your house and ask your child
[1:36:46] in front of
[1:36:49] you God fought for fellowship and
[1:36:51] relationship that's the found
[1:36:54] the beginning in Genesis 1 and 2 was
[1:36:56] relationship and you have to work at
[1:36:59] your
[1:37:00] relationships both with God and with
[1:37:02] those around you that you profess to
[1:37:04] love and have it as a reality displayed
[1:37:07] and be able to multif the Deeds of the
[1:37:09] Flesh and say I have to take certain
[1:37:12] sacrifices because God is pleased when
[1:37:14] he sees certain things in action that's
[1:37:17] when you know you've been led by the
[1:37:18] spirit because your life gets back in
[1:37:21] order Bible order has husband love your
[1:37:24] wives wives reverence your
[1:37:28] husband hallah Hallelujah that wasn't in
[1:37:31] my
[1:37:34] note
[1:37:35] Hallelujah the church is a born again
[1:37:38] bunch how we doing for
[1:37:40] time could I get some more time cuz I
[1:37:42] feel like in a gar this
[1:37:45] morning Pastor said don't
[1:37:49] stop the church is a born against Bunch
[1:37:52] you know and it's so troubling to me
[1:37:56] because people have a lot of Revelation
[1:37:58] a lot of knowledge and I think of it as
[1:38:00] Paul said I do I have knowledge and give
[1:38:03] my body to be burnt and know all
[1:38:06] Mysteries and I could speak in tongues
[1:38:08] and have no charity and I realize at the
[1:38:10] end of the day God is Not marking you on
[1:38:13] what you know all right what you
[1:38:15] understand what you could explain is
[1:38:18] that charity that love that conduct that
[1:38:21] behavior he said if you have all these
[1:38:22] things and have charity you are
[1:38:25] nothing and that's why brother BR said
[1:38:28] you don't need to know the mechanics you
[1:38:30] know what the mechanics is the Mysteries
[1:38:31] and the knowledge he said you need to
[1:38:32] have the Dynamics the Dynamics is the
[1:38:34] life the Dynamics is
[1:38:37] charity and the charity is manifested
[1:38:40] and reflected in your daily
[1:38:42] walk and that's why but the brandom said
[1:38:45] your daily walk must be led by the
[1:38:47] spirit because compassion compassion is
[1:38:50] not feeling sorry for people but they
[1:38:53] said compassion is doing what the will
[1:38:55] of God so when you led by the spirit
[1:38:58] you're feeling sorry for
[1:38:59] everybody Hallelujah like I said
[1:39:02] sometime ago God break some people legs
[1:39:03] for a reason because with the two legs
[1:39:05] they was going to all the parties so God
[1:39:07] break one so they go party so
[1:39:10] now until they totally embarrassed and
[1:39:13] realize that that is not for them amen
[1:39:16] amen and if this keep going I break the
[1:39:19] other one they'll Pat in a wheelchair
[1:39:20] that's
[1:39:23] [Applause]
[1:39:33] Hallelujah but God will do what he has
[1:39:35] to do why because he wants to see his
[1:39:38] life his nature his being his attributes
[1:39:42] his conduct living through you and
[1:39:44] living through me it's a
[1:39:50] reality let me get back on track
[1:39:54] the church is a born against again bunch
[1:39:56] of Believers that's in Christ by the
[1:39:59] Holy Ghost led by the spirit of God they
[1:40:03] are not of the world they are out of the
[1:40:05] world they are different from the world
[1:40:07] that's what makes them what they are
[1:40:09] their life is dead and they're hid in
[1:40:12] Christ dead in Christ and hid and sealed
[1:40:16] by the Holy Ghost they are away from the
[1:40:18] things of the world sons of God in
[1:40:21] expectation are led by the spirit spirit
[1:40:23] of God not led by some other Fanatics or
[1:40:26] some organization or something or
[1:40:28] another they are led by the spirit of
[1:40:31] God the Holy Spirit listen carefully was
[1:40:34] given to the church to be the overseer
[1:40:37] yes sir the tutor that was to raise the
[1:40:40] children of God not our Bishops and
[1:40:43] Cardinals and so forth but the Holy
[1:40:45] Ghost amen I'm expecting this is the
[1:40:47] prophet the Holy Ghost not denomination
[1:40:50] not a bishop not a Catholic priest not a
[1:40:53] Baptist preacher or a Pentecostal
[1:40:55] preacher I'm expecting listen the Holy
[1:40:58] Ghost to come down and set in order a
[1:41:01] church that will go to meet him filled
[1:41:04] with the power and the resurrection of
[1:41:06] Christ I'm expecting that I believe it
[1:41:09] God promised it that there' be a church
[1:41:12] there without spot or wrinkle on it I'm
[1:41:14] expecting it because God said it was
[1:41:19] so somebody say
[1:41:21] amen I just want to read a few quotes
[1:41:23] and I'm going to begin to wind down
[1:41:26] Hallelujah from the message the word
[1:41:27] became flesh in the trip report but the
[1:41:29] B said if your heart listen carefully
[1:41:33] and your mind is so infilled with God's
[1:41:36] spirit until your thoughts become his
[1:41:40] thoughts there you are when your mind
[1:41:43] listen and your leading and your guiding
[1:41:47] becomes a direct place or a direct
[1:41:50] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:41:53] moving your mortal being what kind of
[1:41:55] people should we be if the very Holy
[1:41:58] Spirit has you so embodied or empowered
[1:42:02] that you don't use your own thoughts God
[1:42:03] help me you don't use your own mind you
[1:42:07] don't use your own opinion but the Holy
[1:42:10] Spirit has you so built until your
[1:42:13] thoughts and your being is God's spirit
[1:42:15] expressing itself through you what kind
[1:42:18] of a church would we be amen somebody
[1:42:21] say Amen am what kind of a people would
[1:42:24] it be this morning if this branam
[1:42:27] Tabernacle and I say headstone
[1:42:28] Tabernacle this morning was so filled
[1:42:31] with the presence of God why when you
[1:42:34] didn't even use your own mind didn't
[1:42:36] even use your own thoughts didn't even
[1:42:38] have no alternative of your own but just
[1:42:40] to be led by the
[1:42:42] spirit is that your desire this morning
[1:42:45] no alternative of my own no plan of my
[1:42:49] own no desires of my own no thoughts of
[1:42:52] my own but just to be led by the Holy
[1:42:55] Spirit can the church say hallu
[1:42:59] Amen brother B that same message says
[1:43:03] and when the human element goes out yes
[1:43:06] and the spirit of God fills that vacancy
[1:43:09] where you empty yourself is there
[1:43:10] anybody wants to empty themselves this
[1:43:12] morning you empty yourself then will we
[1:43:16] then will be when the church in its
[1:43:18] power of the resurrection of the Lord
[1:43:20] Jesus Christ will walk in his steps in
[1:43:23] his power in his thoughts in his being
[1:43:26] in his moving you see what I mean then
[1:43:28] your thoughts will become words and
[1:43:29] words will become material that's when
[1:43:31] the church is in his power and B said I
[1:43:33] believe it's on its road that when the
[1:43:35] church will be so wrapped in Christ the
[1:43:38] Holy Spirit mankind so away from
[1:43:42] themselves that they don't see
[1:43:44] themselves but they they they don't see
[1:43:46] no thoughts but to serve God no thoughts
[1:43:50] but to serve God no thoughts but serve
[1:43:54] God hallelujah and their thoughts move
[1:43:56] on they refuse the things of the world
[1:43:59] Amen they just move in the spirit live
[1:44:01] in the spirit move in the spirit walk in
[1:44:04] the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ
[1:44:06] then the love of Christ in the human
[1:44:08] heart moving in the Holy Ghost that
[1:44:11] great wonderful church will go forth
[1:44:13] with power and deity because deity will
[1:44:16] be revealed in human beings by the Holy
[1:44:18] Spirit bringing to pass the thought of
[1:44:20] their mind somebody say Amen
[1:44:23] [Music]
[1:44:24] [Applause]
[1:44:27] I want to share some stuff from the
[1:44:28] prophet because he says it better than I
[1:44:30] can amen you believe that this
[1:44:34] morning that's why we have a prophet
[1:44:37] Hallelujah no man has the ability or the
[1:44:40] authority to change what the prophet
[1:44:43] said and that's why we quote the prophet
[1:44:46] so that it's not my own thought my own
[1:44:48] idea people criticize us and say well
[1:44:50] you don't preach or quoting or don't say
[1:44:52] it so so
[1:44:53] and I have to be led by the spirit am
[1:44:57] and that's why I'm going back because
[1:44:58] God gave us a prophet not for us to just
[1:45:00] say we have a prophet but God gave us a
[1:45:02] prophet because the word of prophet
[1:45:03] brought its present tense its reality
[1:45:06] and it life to us do you feel that way
[1:45:08] this
[1:45:10] morning I am not ashamed of the son of
[1:45:12] man know of his words he may be seated
[1:45:16] amen but theam said our thoughts run
[1:45:18] different a lot of times we walk up and
[1:45:20] say how do you do brother and you don't
[1:45:23] it in your heart all right come on all
[1:45:25] right how you doing you good and they do
[1:45:28] really want to hear the answer
[1:45:32] you a lot of times we say I am this and
[1:45:35] that I will do this you don't mean it in
[1:45:37] your heart but when you become so dead
[1:45:40] to the things of the world that Christ
[1:45:43] is first Christ is all then your entire
[1:45:47] makeup is of the spirit of the Lord
[1:45:49] Jesus Christ he has full control
[1:45:51] Hallelujah that's when your thoughts
[1:45:53] will be clean and your thoughts will be
[1:45:55] pure can the church say amen amen we
[1:45:59] already spoke about this about Cain and
[1:46:00] Abel but B been led by the spirit talk
[1:46:02] about Abel being led by the spirit we're
[1:46:04] going to skip
[1:46:08] that amen led by the Holy Spirit from
[1:46:12] the message led by the spirit of God but
[1:46:13] the B said led by the ho Spirit Sons and
[1:46:15] Daughters of God led by the spirit of
[1:46:17] God Abraham didn't care what anybody
[1:46:19] else said he said now you separate
[1:46:21] yourself so he got this little group
[1:46:23] together and his wife and went out not
[1:46:25] knowing where he was
[1:46:28] going he said what do you care where
[1:46:30] you're going just keep
[1:46:32] going brother Bram said well where does
[1:46:35] it lead to just keep on walking he was
[1:46:38] led by the spirit of God and Men great
[1:46:41] men are always you don't have to
[1:46:43] question God what it's all about and sat
[1:46:47] down and figure it all up in science and
[1:46:50] how does the spirit of the supernatural
[1:46:52] being come and get into us that's the
[1:46:54] intellectuals in the message well this
[1:46:56] star with this star on this day so it
[1:46:58] means this
[1:47:00] and
[1:47:02] Hallelujah Moses was a man of God led by
[1:47:05] the spirit of God listen oh he wanted to
[1:47:08] lead himself one time Hallelujah he got
[1:47:11] all the mathematics and the militarism
[1:47:14] all in his mind he know what a great man
[1:47:15] he was so he thought he could go right
[1:47:17] out and do it himself but he found
[1:47:20] himself a failure every technique he
[1:47:23] started was wrong he slew a man that's
[1:47:25] the first thing the military cheat
[1:47:28] treats you kill somebody teachers go
[1:47:30] kill somebody else that was his tactic
[1:47:32] that's the prophet speaking so he went
[1:47:34] out on his military education and he
[1:47:37] slew a man and was a stranger among his
[1:47:40] Regin for 40 years but one day an old
[1:47:43] sheep heard her walking around the
[1:47:45] backside of the desert and the first
[1:47:47] thing you know he come into the presence
[1:47:49] of God and when he did the Holy Ghost
[1:47:52] got a fire Bush there and he told Moses
[1:47:54] more about his leading in 5 minutes
[1:47:58] minutes he had to take the military out
[1:48:00] of him and put the real genuine Holy
[1:48:02] Spirit in him so he could be led by the
[1:48:06] spirit I want you to notice Moses was a
[1:48:09] coward with all of his military training
[1:48:11] with all of his theology with all of his
[1:48:14] understanding of the Bible his mother
[1:48:16] had taught him from a child what was
[1:48:17] going to take place how he was going to
[1:48:19] be an emancipator of the great nation
[1:48:22] Israel all these things she had taught
[1:48:24] him but yet in his own mind he was
[1:48:26] unable to accomplish the purpose yes and
[1:48:29] every man I don't care how much
[1:48:31] education you got how well you know the
[1:48:34] Bible how much theology you have learned
[1:48:37] you are unqualified till you receive the
[1:48:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost and be led by
[1:48:43] the spirit of
[1:48:44] [Applause]
[1:48:46] God why are you seeing this brother
[1:48:48] Isaac cuz I want to make sure that we
[1:48:50] are grounded in the word of God
[1:48:53] that no man could deceive you with any
[1:48:56] comly devised
[1:48:58] [Applause]
[1:48:59] fabl can the church say
[1:49:03] amen amen in the message Christ is the
[1:49:06] mystery of God revealed and all those
[1:49:08] things typed him they talk about all
[1:49:10] those who gone before just in type but
[1:49:12] yet the mystery was hid them men didn't
[1:49:14] know what they were doing they only knew
[1:49:16] that they were led by the spirit to do
[1:49:18] something Hallelujah now holding it back
[1:49:20] in the last days for the great
[1:49:21] revelation but expressing it expressing
[1:49:24] himself in Moses and David and Joseph
[1:49:27] and Elijah and on down through we could
[1:49:30] take each of these prophets and bring
[1:49:31] their lives out and show it express
[1:49:33] Jesus Christ perfectly yet never giving
[1:49:36] his secret in full waiting for to make
[1:49:39] known in these last days as he promised
[1:49:42] waiting for it to be fully comprehended
[1:49:44] before he could express it because the
[1:49:47] Bible is written in Mysteries Hallelujah
[1:49:49] can the church say Amen I'm going to
[1:49:52] skip down
[1:49:53] bit and but gives a story maybe you know
[1:49:55] it talk about being led by the spirit
[1:49:57] because God friends is looking for
[1:49:59] individuals he's not looking for a group
[1:50:01] he's not looking for a church he's
[1:50:02] looking for individuals in the message
[1:50:04] led by the spirit of God the musician
[1:50:06] could get ready he said here not long
[1:50:08] ago up in my country hope you all
[1:50:10] haven't got such down there a boy got
[1:50:12] saved or got converted and went to join
[1:50:16] a certain denominational Church why it's
[1:50:18] a Methodist so he and his wife so they
[1:50:20] moved from the country and went into the
[1:50:22] city and they took their membership out
[1:50:25] of the country Methodist Church where
[1:50:26] they had salvation and went down in the
[1:50:29] big city Church where they got a lot of
[1:50:31] theology oh everything just as starchy
[1:50:33] as it could
[1:50:34] be so after a couple years brother Bram
[1:50:37] said the old mommy of the boy kept
[1:50:39] raging to him said honey are you still
[1:50:41] going to church said yes we still go to
[1:50:44] church me and Molly goes all the time
[1:50:46] said well I'm going to come down and
[1:50:48] visit you so she was way up there in the
[1:50:51] mountains of Kentucky and when she come
[1:50:53] down she wore her Kentucky clothes way
[1:50:56] high neck great big puffed up shoulders
[1:51:00] and little old shoes on re long done and
[1:51:03] when she started in the church somebody
[1:51:05] said what antique shop did this come out
[1:51:09] of now the boy and his wife didn't want
[1:51:12] to take her to church because they know
[1:51:14] she was noisy she come out of a noisy
[1:51:18] church so they was afraid it'd be
[1:51:20] embarrassed so that morning she walked
[1:51:22] in and she said well praise the Lord to
[1:51:24] the Usher at the door he said M oh
[1:51:29] my but the M said there you got it
[1:51:31] that's his theology M but the m
[1:51:34] dramatizing so she got her seat and sat
[1:51:36] down the little lady her daughter-in-law
[1:51:38] bowed her head her face red her ears
[1:51:41] could have lit a match this is the
[1:51:43] prophet now her son looking sideways see
[1:51:46] the done gut in the wrong crowd that's
[1:51:49] all that's the way you get to when you
[1:51:51] get in the wrong crowd you see it's so s
[1:51:54] it comes so cunning but you just get in
[1:51:57] the wrong place all right after a while
[1:51:59] the preacher said dear friends we have
[1:52:01] one Redeemer and that is the Lord Jesus
[1:52:04] Mama Said Amen GL preacher said M my he
[1:52:09] said and he come to Earth to save the
[1:52:10] Lord she said Hallelujah that's right
[1:52:13] amen so he nodded over to his Deacon the
[1:52:16] Deacon went over and told her now said
[1:52:18] Madam we'd like you to come to church
[1:52:20] but you're interrupting the pastor if if
[1:52:22] you don't keep still we'll have to lead
[1:52:24] you out the door Jesus all right Mama's
[1:52:27] response you might as well take me yes
[1:52:30] because I just can't sit still when
[1:52:32] you're led by the spirit of God you'll
[1:52:34] blow up if you didn't say something led
[1:52:37] by the spirit of God she might not have
[1:52:40] had her name written in who's who but I
[1:52:42] can imagine but brandom said it was
[1:52:44] written in the Lamb's Book of Life he
[1:52:46] say i' rather have it there anyhow she
[1:52:48] might not have announced to much much
[1:52:50] she she may not have amounted to much
[1:52:52] here but in heaven she was a saint
[1:52:54] because she was led by the spirit of God
[1:52:57] it didn't matter where she went what
[1:52:59] church she went to she was a worshiper
[1:53:01] because she know who her father was she
[1:53:03] know where she come from you don't want
[1:53:06] me to shout take me out of here I'm

[1:53:37] carefully look at the condition led by
[1:53:39] the spirit to challenge Ahab you can't
[1:53:41] just go and challenge unless you're led
[1:53:43] by the spirit right I and challenge that

[1:53:49] and challenge you putting yourself in a
[1:53:51] war zone you have one good and he have

[1:54:39] about the time the evening sacrifice was
[1:54:41] due Elijah killed a Bullock and laid it
[1:54:44] upon the altar walked out there led by
[1:54:47] the spirit of God and said God I've done
[1:54:49] all this at your bidding brother said I
[1:54:51] tell you Devils will tremble and sinners
[1:54:54] will wake when men and women submit
[1:54:57] themselves to God and are led by the
[1:54:59] Holy Ghost can the church say amen
[1:55:01] that's what we are looking for in this

[1:55:27] church friends we need more contact
[1:55:29] hours every week you
[1:55:30] know I don't think Sunday Wednesday
[1:55:33] Thursday is enough I think we should
[1:55:34] have a Tuesday and a Friday amen Amen
[1:55:37] brother
[1:55:41] Anthony message he him brother the said
[1:55:44] now notice talking about adoption now we
[1:55:46] read the scripture in Romans when there
[1:55:48] come the time of adoption this son
[1:55:51] received all of the rights his rights
[1:55:54] now there's where God wants his children
[1:55:57] listen carefully to a place that he can
[1:55:59] take you one by one one by one listen
[1:56:02] carefully one by one well I in this
[1:56:05] group and you in that group and I can't
[1:56:07] shake your hand
[1:56:09] and after all of that God going to say
[1:56:11] come you you in the group
[1:56:13] come take you one by one take you out
[1:56:17] before the public so you're going to
[1:56:19] have to stand your own ground your own
[1:56:21] testimony and Minister something to you
[1:56:24] that's spectacular that's the prophet
[1:56:26] speaking Hallelujah something that one
[1:56:28] of his gifts that he wants to give his
[1:56:30] church oh there's all kinds of gifts
[1:56:32] that God has for his church but how can
[1:56:35] the father listen give us gifts when we
[1:56:38] are acting the way we are
[1:56:42] acting see he makes it known the whole
[1:56:45] world everybody will see this gift
[1:56:48] manifested if God adopts you or places
[1:56:51] you possess positionally into his
[1:56:55] family so that's why I always say there
[1:56:57] can't be a question mark or H I wonder
[1:57:01] if he adopted boy you listen to what the
[1:57:04] prophet said God will make it known
[1:57:07] there will be no question the
[1:57:09] manifestation will be the
[1:57:13] interpretation you may be see it like I
[1:57:15] heard somebody say this week you can't
[1:57:16] be kind of
[1:57:18] pregnant all right all right you're
[1:57:21] pregnant or no but kind of
[1:57:23] pregnant is either you're pregnant or
[1:57:25] you're not pregnant it's either you're
[1:57:27] adopted or you're not adopted it's
[1:57:29] either you have the Holy Ghost or you
[1:57:30] don't have the Holy Ghost it's either
[1:57:32] you repented or you did not
[1:57:34] repent it's either you're hot or you're
[1:57:37] cold but if you are contending for
[1:57:40] something until you get it keep
[1:57:42] contending wait until something
[1:57:46] [Applause]
[1:57:48] happens I feel like get you want to go
[1:57:50] to wall feel you have a gun
[1:57:54] I feel I have a gun in his backpack here
[1:57:55] I go out and fight yet check the
[1:57:58] B I feel I have a gun I feel I have a
[1:58:00] grenade I feel I have something in this
[1:58:02] back here I'm going and you in the
[1:58:03] middle surrounded by you're
[1:58:06] reaching a
[1:58:08] sandwich
[1:58:11] potatoes hallelujah it's either you have
[1:58:14] it or you do have it and if it don't
[1:58:17] have it we should be desperate to get
[1:58:20] it desperate on a su
[1:58:22] desperate on a Monday desperate on a
[1:58:24] Tuesday desperate on a Wednesday take
[1:58:26] time off and work if you have to because
[1:58:28] this is more important than work Heaven
[1:58:31] and Earth will pass away but this will
[1:58:33] not pass
[1:58:34] away this is the most important meeting
[1:58:37] of your
[1:58:38] [Applause]
[1:58:39] week can the church say
[1:58:42] [Music]
[1:58:45] amen hallelujah my just a little more
[1:58:49] but said and why are we not a den
[1:58:51] domination
[1:58:52] he said now you don't read God's word
[1:58:56] just like you read a newspaper amen amen
[1:58:59] you read God's word by the Holy Spirit
[1:59:02] see because the Holy Spirit itself
[1:59:05] speaking through Christ Christ thanking
[1:59:08] God that he'd hid these things from the
[1:59:11] eyes of the wise and proven and would
[1:59:14] reveal them to babes such as would learn
[1:59:17] so you see there's no way of ever being
[1:59:20] educated there's no way of ever
[1:59:22] denominating there's only one way to get
[1:59:25] right that's be led by the spirit of God
[1:59:28] and that experience you had must cope
[1:59:31] with this word then you got it
[1:59:33] see can the church say Amen we going to
[1:59:37] begin to wind now from the message
[1:59:38] looking at the Unseen but said when God
[1:59:41] made man we back to Genesis he made him
[1:59:44] thus for he made this little certain
[1:59:47] compartment in the man for his own
[1:59:49] Throne his control tower
[1:59:52] God wants to lead man but man wants to
[1:59:55] lead himself therefore there is a war
[2:00:00] constantly a constant War a constant
[2:00:03] battle a constant challenge amen the man
[2:00:07] wants to go after what he sees listen
[2:00:09] with his eyes and that's where he is
[2:00:13] deceived that's where Satan deceived Eve
[2:00:16] by what she could see the fruit was
[2:00:19] pleasant to the eye but it was death to
[2:00:21] the Soul that's right so is it tonight
[2:00:24] today God wants to lead man so he made
[2:00:27] himself a little control tower in the
[2:00:30] midst of his heart so that a man would
[2:00:32] be led by the spirit of God amen amen
[2:00:36] getting off on his own leading is what
[2:00:38] separated him from his Fellowship
[2:00:41] looking at what he could see with his
[2:00:44] eye amen and that's where he stands
[2:00:47] tonight all those who are led by such
[2:00:50] things but the scripture says Sons and
[2:00:52] Daughters of God are led by the spirit
[2:00:54] of
[2:00:57] God your emotions is your control by B
[2:00:59] said you can notice a man or woman that
[2:01:01] tries to walk after the things of the
[2:01:03] world they never can please God never
[2:01:06] never never if you put your career above
[2:01:09] God you can never please God you put
[2:01:12] your house above God never please God
[2:01:14] how you look before God never please God
[2:01:16] money before God never please God Church
[2:01:19] before God never please God message
[2:01:21] before before God never please
[2:01:25] God but God first God thank you but a
[2:01:30] man or a woman that will not look at the
[2:01:32] things of the world but just go
[2:01:34] according to the leading of the spirit
[2:01:36] they are usually in the will of God
[2:01:39] hallelujah can the church say amen amen
[2:01:43] hallelujah man always tried to achieve
[2:01:45] something by his head he's supposed to
[2:01:47] achieve it by his heart Hallelujah
[2:01:49] that's the control tower where God
[2:01:51] controls and directs his thoughts direct
[2:01:53] his walk direct his emotions some I get
[2:01:56] so happy I just have to let loose and if
[2:01:59] I look around and see somebody then see
[2:02:01] I got my eyes on people then but God
[2:02:03] helped me to keep my eyes closed so but
[2:02:05] say listen be let and don't worry about
[2:02:07] anybody else you want to Worship You
[2:02:08] worship amen you want to testify you
[2:02:11] testify amen I just want to be led by
[2:02:14] the spirit of God that the flesh will
[2:02:17] have nothing to do into
[2:02:20] it what we need tonight brother Bram
[2:02:22] said is a unified Church filled with the
[2:02:25] Holy Ghost and power from on high led by
[2:02:29] the spirit of the Living God on the
[2:02:31] control tower that won't say because I'm
[2:02:33] a Baptist and he's a Methodist I have
[2:02:36] nothing to do with him a real true
[2:02:38] spirit of God will recognize his brother
[2:02:42] or sister I don't care what kind of
[2:02:45] brand he is wearing oh we need a
[2:02:47] leadership again of the Holy Spirit
[2:02:49] walking after the Unseen the way that go
[2:02:51] God leads us can the church say
[2:02:55] amen
[2:02:57] hallelujah glory to God I pray this has
[2:03:00] been such a blessing to you Hallelujah
[2:03:03] so that you'll be seated now with the
[2:03:04] right thing and recognize that God's
[2:03:07] standard is here and we have to step up
[2:03:08] to that standard can the church say Amen
[2:03:12] nothing less than the standard nothing
[2:03:14] less than the absolute nothing less than
[2:03:16] the word itself you may be seated
[2:03:19] Hallelujah there's a few more pages I'm
[2:03:21] going to
[2:03:22] finish up the message brother Bram said
[2:03:24] in the message of rejected
[2:03:28] King he said puts me in the mind of some
[2:03:31] of these cold formal mors that we've got
[2:03:34] today talking about churches get so far
[2:03:37] away from God you don't know how to get
[2:03:39] back you'll never come back by Creeds
[2:03:42] you've got to have inspiration to lead
[2:03:45] you brother and that inspiration comes
[2:03:47] by the Holy Ghost yes LED of the spirit
[2:03:50] Sons and Daughters of God are led by the
[2:03:53] spirit of God they love the spirit they
[2:03:55] don't try to say now wait a minute my
[2:03:57] church they don't say Amen my church
[2:03:59] never raise their hands they're very
[2:04:01] quiet why we give our pastor chills and
[2:04:03] fever if somebody holler amen well you
[2:04:05] ought to chill him up once in a
[2:04:09] while led by the spirit
[2:04:13] amen from Jehovah Gyra just if you are
[2:04:16] led by this prayer listen now just take
[2:04:19] your time until you got zeroed in if you
[2:04:22] don't you'll shoot too high or shoot too
[2:04:25] wide or something let's make it zero the
[2:04:28] Bible I believe that God wants us to
[2:04:30] zero in hallelu the Holy Spirit zeroed
[2:04:33] in with the apostles or they had zeroed
[2:04:35] in with the Holy Spirit rather and I
[2:04:37] believe we can do the same thing by the
[2:04:40] same word it hits the target and if it
[2:04:43] hit it one time dead center it could hit
[2:04:46] again but you've got to zero in can the
[2:04:48] church say
[2:04:50] Amen what we need today brother brandham
[2:04:52] said in the message God's provided
[2:04:55] approach to Divine Fellowship what we
[2:04:57] need today is a beating the gospel back
[2:04:59] in the church to straighten the church
[2:05:02] up to pull it out of the kings that it's
[2:05:05] in and come back under the Fellowship of
[2:05:08] the blood again in this Shina Glory unto
[2:05:12] a Pentecostal experience like it had
[2:05:15] back many years ago like we used to have
[2:05:17] years ago what we need like in the days
[2:05:20] of John Wesley we back in the days of
[2:05:22] Calvin KN way back all the way to
[2:05:24] Pentecost what we need listen is a
[2:05:27] relationship again with God talk about
[2:05:30] Adam right till men are willing to die
[2:05:34] out to themselves you can begin to play
[2:05:35] something softly hallelujah hallelujah
[2:05:37] die out of themselves in the secret

[2:07:17] trouble today you don't need Hallelujah
[2:07:19] no guy to guide you down the broad
[2:07:22] way you know all the alleys and
[2:07:24] everything else you know all the way to
[2:07:28] sin you've been around a long time
[2:07:30] there's no need of somebody trying to
[2:07:32] tell you about that you know all the
[2:07:35] shortcuts that's right every sin you
[2:07:37] know all about it nobody has to tell you
[2:07:39] to steal you know that nobody has to
[2:07:42] tell you how to curse you know that
[2:07:44] nobody has to tell you how to do these

[2:08:01] promised landall and that's why I took
[2:08:03] for an inspiration we have not passed
[2:08:06] this way before and if we have not
[2:08:08] passed this way before no man is the
[2:08:10] authority on how to get where we need to
[2:08:12] go it has to be the Holy Spirit itself
[2:08:15] leading us and if we can yield ourselves
[2:08:18] to the Holy Spirit then that connection
[2:08:20] is no longer you and any man it's you
[2:08:22] and God being led by the spirit into
[2:08:26] what God has for
[2:08:28] you he said if you pass this way you
[2:08:30] have to come through Holiness because
[2:08:32] it's a new land a new life a new people

[2:08:39] somebody raise him and holler glory to
[2:08:41] God hallelujah because you have not been
