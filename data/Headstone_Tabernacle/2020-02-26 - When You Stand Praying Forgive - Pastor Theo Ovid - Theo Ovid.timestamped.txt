[15:19] for coming out tonight and if avi by
[15:21] bizarre like a return to st. mark
[15:23] chapter 11 we want to read from verse 11
[15:26] he was 26
[15:27] oh praise the Lord
[15:35] and Jesus entered into Jerusalem and
[15:39] into the temple and when he had looked
[15:42] around about upon all things and how
[15:45] they even type was come he went out on
[15:48] the Bethany with the twelve under the
[15:50] morrow when they were come from Bethany
[15:53] he was hungry seen a fig tree afar all
[15:56] heaven leaves he came if haply might
[15:58] find anything there on but when he came
[16:01] to it he found nothing but leaves for
[16:04] the time of the figs was not yet and
[16:07] jesus answered and said unto it no man
[16:10] eat food from thee hereafter forever and
[16:13] his disciples heard it and they come to
[16:17] Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple
[16:19] and began to cast out them that sold and
[16:22] bought in the temple and overthrew the
[16:25] tables of the moneychangers and the
[16:29] seats of them that sold us and would not
[16:33] suffer that any man did carry any vessel
[16:35] to the temple and he taught saying unto
[16:39] them is it not written my house shall be
[16:42] called of all nations the house of
[16:45] prayer but you have made it a den of
[16:47] teeth and the scribe and the chief
[16:51] priests heard it and sought told him I
[16:52] destroy him for they feared him because
[16:55] all the people was astonished at his
[16:58] doctrine and when even was come he went
[17:03] out of the city and in the morning as
[17:05] they passed by they saw the fig tree
[17:07] dried up from the roots and Peter Colin
[17:11] to remembrance see it unto him master
[17:13] they all the fig tree which dog kisses
[17:15] with it away and Jesus answering saith
[17:21] unto them have faith in God
[17:26] for verily I say unto you that whosoever
[17:29] shall see under this mountain be thou
[17:32] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[17:34] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[17:37] shall believe that those things which he
[17:39] said shall come to pass he shall have
[17:42] whatsoever he said and therefore I say
[17:46] unto you what things soever you desire
[17:48] when you pray believe that you receive
[17:51] them and ye shall have them and when you
[17:55] stand praying forgive if you have aught
[17:58] against any that your father also which
[18:02] is in heaven may forgive you your
[18:04] trespasses but if you do not forgive
[18:06] neither will your Father which is ever
[18:09] forgive your trespasses let's pray
[18:11] father we thank you Lord and I pray you
[18:13] would breed your spirit breath life upon
[18:16] your word and I'm touches with life
[18:18] tonight and light tonight in Jesus name
[18:20] we ask at him and you may be seated
[18:22] oh praise the Lord our title tonight
[18:29] when you stand praying forgive or praise
[18:34] the name of the Lord is a great need for
[18:37] forgiveness in this our people don't
[18:40] even know how holding grudges and Ortez
[18:43] thoughts affect the person who is
[18:45] holding the Ortz and grudges more than
[18:48] the person that you hold any author on
[18:49] grudges against sometimes people don't
[18:52] even know your hole in the ought against
[18:53] them
[18:53] they don't even know what they did but
[18:55] you have something against somebody else
[18:57] and you're holding it I'm not affecting
[18:59] all your other blessings because faith
[19:02] is based on forgiveness now I want you
[19:05] to understand that faith is not just by
[19:07] here in the Word of God fit itself is
[19:10] based on forgiveness hallelujah

[47:12] this that's right and that is why and
[47:15] that is why I'm you explaining all what
[47:17] is why because you do want to deal with
[47:19] you you don't want to face up to the
[47:23] mirror of your behavior of your attitude
[47:26] of your arrogance of your pride because
[47:29] you see forgiveness that's familiar
[47:35] especially when you are right and they
[47:39] are wrong and you have to forgive them
[47:42] and you know they're wrong and you are
[47:46] right but you still have to forgive them
[47:51] no I know let's say me man
[47:54] I don't know D by a man going back ugly
[47:56] but that's a powerful one when you know
[48:02] that they were wrong and you have the T
[48:04] grow and you have to forgive them and
[48:06] drop please do forgive them not talk
[48:08] forgive you know I mean drop it
[48:10] I mean anything to the spirit of
[48:13] forgiveness then make it pop them up and
[48:15] love them up and take them and eat
[48:18] dinner with them and bread with them
[48:19] right now you do you want to shake their
[48:21] hand you didn't want to talk to them
[48:22] your caste and them if they walk inside
[48:24] your head so because if something
[48:26] upsetting your spirit we talk more when
[48:29] you drop it when they get free from that
[48:30] nothing a second your spirit you're free
[48:33] when I say a free you're free you're
[48:36] free to hug them they don't feel a whole
[48:38] you know because they know that their
[48:39] things here but you over come back and
[48:46] you have to give your testimony I love
[48:49] you brother appreciate you brother god
[48:52] bless you brother or glory to God a
[48:55] tango if we say we have no sin we
[48:57] deceive ourselves and the truth is not
[48:59] in us but if we confess our sins he is
[49:02] faithful and just to forgive us all our
[49:04] sins and to cleanse us of all
[49:06] unrighteousness
[49:07] or glory to God if we say we walk in the
[49:10] light and we hear to my brother we lie
[49:12] and do not the truth
[49:14] Oh glory to God hallelujah Oh glory to
[49:17] God praise God praise God
[49:19] yes yes yes yes yes or give the Lord
[49:23] some princes tonight
[49:24] [Applause]
[49:27] [Music]
[49:33] this on first John one that which we
[49:36] have seen and heard declare we unto you
[49:38] that ye also have fellowship with us and
[49:40] truly our Fellowship is with the father
[49:42] with his son then this is the message
[49:45] which we have heard of him and declare
[49:46] unto you that God is light and in him is
[49:49] no darkness at all
[49:52] so God not any darkness thing God is
[49:56] light in him no darkness at all okay if
[50:01] we see we have fellowship with him and
[50:05] walk in darkness we lie and do not the
[50:09] truth if we say we have fellowship with
[50:14] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[50:18] not the truth but if we walk in the
[50:19] light as he is in the light then we have
[50:27] no fellowship with one another that not
[50:31] escape together
[50:33] so evidence of you walking in the light
[50:37] you have to have fellowship one with
[50:43] another subretinal pull away yourself
[50:46] from the faith they don't want the
[50:53] fellowship be in that misery
[50:59] because if you're walking in the light
[51:03] I'm I read it again in the back of this
[51:07] one good God is light and him no
[51:10] documents if we say we have fellowship
[51:11] with him and walk in darkness we lie
[51:14] then he come down if we walk in the
[51:16] light as he is in the light we have
[51:18] fellowship one with another and the
[51:21] blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin
[51:26] because the fellowship identified that
[51:29] the blood for you is the blood for me is
[51:31] there no one blood for you and no blood
[51:33] for me the same blood that forgive you
[51:35] forgive me too and if God put the blood
[51:38] on me I could put the blood on you too
[51:39] with the blood of Jesus cleanses the
[51:46] cleansing stream I see I see
[51:49] I plunge with me hallelujah Oh glory of
[51:56] God do you see it tonight the blood for
[52:00] you is the same blood for your brother
[52:03] so don't condemn your brother don't nag
[52:06] your brother your charity believe it all
[52:08] things who pit all things you don't hope
[52:12] you better fall you know hope he fails
[52:14] you what we make it your hope he comes
[52:16] true they believe in all things for him
[52:19] you're hoping all things for him or
[52:21] glory that God you expecting the best
[52:23] for him because I see a brother anyhow
[52:26] Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[52:31] one of the big testimonies considering
[52:33] William branham's life was that you
[52:36] couldn't tell his enemies from his
[52:38] friends think about Isaac as preachers
[52:41] and he's talking about when Jesus told
[52:43] Judas whatever no do is do quickly
[52:45] these are disciples thought he was going
[52:47] to buy something for Jesus something he
[52:49] won on the Aaron they had no clue that
[52:51] he gone to get his his thirty pieces of
[52:54] silver they didn't know he done
[52:59] negotiate already and looking to go and
[53:00] collect because this man wasn't made up
[53:03] to betray Christ but Christ didn't
[53:05] expose him there was one among you
[53:09] are you watching them zoom affects a
[53:16] column visit well you know Christ call
[53:21] Judas too
[53:22] he was elected to be among them he was
[53:26] anointed only thing Judas didn't make it
[53:33] was a perimeter but he was partaking of
[53:35] the ministry and Berman said his
[53:37] ministry was not inferior to the rest I
[53:39] [Music]
[53:41] want to say that again
[53:43] Julis ministry was not cut ministry I
[53:46] was finally Kentucky boy
[53:54] I don't know uh yeah yeah II given some
[54:03] praises people

[1:04:54] spirit condensed into law was word and
[1:04:56] logos words spoken let there be let
[1:04:59] there be left to be let the be Lucifer
[1:05:02] let her be angel let there be them
[1:05:06] wasn't before you know them I know that
[1:05:07] because Lucy law was created she was
[1:05:10] created so perfect
[1:05:15] I'm music I'm new music he was
[1:05:19] infinitely quiet earlier he was in
[1:05:20] charge of running things in heavy he
[1:05:23] gets so powerful and caught up in his
[1:05:25] anointing and all his feathers and his

[1:05:46] it was the I'm an original rayman
[1:05:52] original Ironmen he convinced to the
[1:06:02] angels which is still they were heavily
[1:06:09] injured when they get kicked out they
[1:06:13] become demons they become Fallen they
[1:06:16] fall into darkness because he was like
[1:06:20] an angel of light so he fall under
[1:06:23] darkness and he drop on the earth now Oh
[1:06:26] glory to God and the power man send it
[1:06:28] back ravines and from the battle ax men
[1:06:30] so these supernatural spiritual art and
[1:06:33] battling the elect of God since that
[1:06:35] time so God had to hit the mystery of
[1:06:41] the restoration by putting a man with
[1:06:45] Abraham who stood with fate for 25 years
[1:06:48] and challenged the devil's Kingdom with
[1:06:50] all the daily know in it because he was
[1:06:53] standing with faith as a rock Abraham
[1:06:55] faith Isaac loved Jacob grace
[1:06:58] pure perfection God was doing a work
[1:07:01] right under the nose of the devil
[1:07:03] because we were reflecting a work that
[1:07:05] will be done in you do you get that back
[1:07:10] for us to go back to even we have to go
[1:07:13] back into the image and likeness of God
[1:07:15] because when God finish the earth is a
[1:07:17] lettuce bed man he has seen nobody like
[1:07:20] him and that monkey that bearded whale
[1:07:24] at that fish it of everything else but
[1:07:26] nothing like him
[1:07:27] it happy upgrades mr. Cihan - nothing
[1:07:31] like him close but not like him
[1:07:34] then Corsa let us make man in our image
[1:07:38] in our likeness and let that man have
[1:07:41] dominion and God put a spirit man there
[1:07:47] but he needed a dustman to deal with the
[1:07:50] act because he put mental Rudy edit so
[1:07:54] he put man in five senses with such
[1:07:56] sense
[1:07:59] five six cents every even atom using six
[1:08:04] cents to talk with God I don't even know
[1:08:07] he was naked every even Adam could
[1:08:09] commune with his father six cents a
[1:08:11] higher phone line a wireless connection
[1:08:17] every man have an access line to a
[1:08:20] heavenly realm of the spirit always
[1:08:24] think about that right now
[1:08:25] this thing freshmen just like you and I
[1:08:28] having direct access to a heavenly place
[1:08:32] and a spirit being room and the earth
[1:08:36] with other angels for names Lucifer
[1:08:38] looking at an opportunity hope to get in
[1:08:41] he can't mess with Adam he's had a fool
[1:08:44] with Eve
[1:08:45] Eva's by-product so he talked with Eve
[1:08:48] and ezel
[1:08:49] Adam fell and let's all sit and gain
[1:08:52] access to renal it that's all sit and
[1:08:56] get access to become the Prince of the

[1:12:00] about version six and they cried with a
[1:12:05] loud voice and Oh Lord holy and true
[1:12:06] that's out judge and avenge our blood on
[1:12:08] them that dwell on the earth and white
[1:12:10] rumors were given unto every one of them
[1:12:12] it was said unto them that they should
[1:12:13] rest a little season until their fellow
[1:12:16] servants also another brethren that
[1:12:18] should be killed as they were should
[1:12:19] shall be fulfilled not particularly that
[1:12:23] none of these under the altar were
[1:12:25] killed for the testimony to Jesus they
[1:12:27] will not like Antipas was slain for
[1:12:29] holding fast his name these are not born
[1:12:32] again one with eternal life as their
[1:12:34] possession they carve in the
[1:12:36] resurrection and received life because
[1:12:38] they stand on the word everybody edified
[1:12:40] I want to get you notice how these are
[1:12:45] crying out for vengeance they cannot be
[1:12:48] bride material the bride turns the cheek
[1:12:57] and Christ Father forgive them they know
[1:13:01] not what they do
[1:13:02] these are Jews they have to be because
[1:13:06] they are in the fifth seal and as the
[1:13:08] fourth seal the Gentile bride is gone
[1:13:10] the rapture so these Jews and born of
[1:13:13] his spirit so burner over
[1:13:16] you mean when somebody is born of the
[1:13:19] Spirit they can say father forgiveness
[1:13:23] you mean if somebody not born of the
[1:13:26] spirit of cassada no they can say that
[1:13:29] you mean is somebody call of a vengeance
[1:13:31] that is that bright material you mean
[1:13:34] there is something called bride material
[1:13:36] and bride material went by material
[1:13:38] stamp rain by material will forget Oh
[1:13:41] glory to God hallelujah praise the name
[1:13:46] of the Lord hallelujah so when the
[1:13:49] spirit Falls there will become a move

[1:13:59] rocket until they Confederate put a
[1:14:01] boycott on anybody that don't belong to
[1:14:03] them but by that time the bride will be
[1:14:05] under the anointing of the restoration
