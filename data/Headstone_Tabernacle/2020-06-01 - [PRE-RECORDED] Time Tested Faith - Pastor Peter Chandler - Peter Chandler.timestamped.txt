[2:13] I mean God bless you since we welcomed
[2:20] union name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:22] tonight we're gonna start off the
[2:26] meeting the convention with brother
[2:29] Branham with a short video clip of 10
[2:33] minutes preaching to us so we'd like him
[2:36] to open the convention and and when the
[2:45] video clip ends I'd like us all to stand
[2:49] up and welcome the presence of the Holy
[2:52] Spirit amen
[2:54] so the prophets can switch it on there
[3:05] the church today needs power in truth
[3:09] again
[3:10] Oh God raised up his son that this would
[3:13] be taken care of
[3:14] barri said on the wild in the world will
[3:16] see me no more yet he'll see me where
[3:18] I'll be with you even in you we find out
[3:20] at Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday
[3:22] today and forever we find out in my love
[3:25] hot for that he promised us a message in
[3:27] those days that would restore the faith
[3:29] of the people back to the fathers again
[3:31] he promised in the last days he also
[3:35] promised to John 14:12 he that believeth
[3:37] on me that works that I do shall he do
[3:39] also even more than this or greater than
[3:42] this shall he do for I go to my father
[3:44] he's speaking one day they said master
[3:47] show us a sign
[3:48] he said a weak and adulterous generation
[3:49] seeks after sign that's the generation
[3:51] we're living in today he said I'll give
[3:54] him aside or as Jonah stirs in the
[3:56] bennet away Oh 3 days a night so must
[3:58] the Son of Man be in the heart of the
[4:00] earth three days tonight what kind of a
[4:02] sign would a wicked and adulterous
[4:03] generation find out the resurrection
[4:06] sign that's what we're promised today
[4:09] the resurrection sign that he's still
[4:12] alive Jesus feet yesterday today and
[4:14] forever
[4:17] now after 1900 years with the church
[4:22] ages past all the things that he
[4:25] prophesied Lutheran Wesley's we just
[4:27] went through it seems draw it out he cut
[4:30] down and brought out the Lord started
[4:31] all the board here for us shorten come
[4:33] down himself and confirm the be right
[4:35] after 99 years and we're at the end I'll
[4:38] delay hacia Church age he promised in
[4:41] Luke 17 30 that this same son of man did
[4:46] promise them would be revealed in the
[4:51] days like it wasn't Sodom upon the earth
[4:53] did he do it doesn't have to come to
[4:56] that it's impossible I remember becoming
[5:00] three names the Son of Man the Son of
[5:05] God the spirit the son of David for the
[5:08] believe but in between this conjunction
[5:10] a 42 years old words in the day when the
[5:13] Son of man shall be revealed repeat
[5:16] himself as what that son of dots on the
[5:19] name will reveal yourself in a different
[5:21] way now what does that mean Malachi 4
[5:24] exactly right they the son of man will
[5:28] reveal himself not in a whole big
[5:31] denominations and things that we've had
[5:32] to the agent but he would manifest
[5:35] himself as son a man again to make
[5:37] manifest Malachi or it is that day I was
[5:42] said to you he's the height of the
[5:44] prophecy and he shall turn the hearts of
[5:47] the churn back to the faith of the
[5:49] Apostolic fathers away from
[5:51] denominationalism and come back to the
[5:53] original word again to draw out that
[5:55] last a pride tree that he posed in the
[5:58] evening time it shall be light up to the
[6:01] misty day it shall be like you'll be a
[6:03] day can be called a date or not see it's
[6:05] making up the body but the same happen
[6:09] that we're sure these days you're in the
[6:11] West again there shall be light in the
[6:13] evening time oh my I feel like singing a
[6:18] song
[6:21] [Music]
[6:33] makes the other night a prisoner to the
[6:36] word and will of God because you can
[6:38] move it so God move what your eyes like
[6:42] that
[6:52] Oh Lord your God and your God for every
[6:57] male and we are so happy to know that
[7:01] you promised that you would have a
[7:03] remnant when you come to the earth
[7:04] regardless of what goals are comes
[7:06] there's going to be people that's going
[7:09] to be ready we know that there is a padi
[7:12] that man gives to God and there's a
[7:15] tithing amongst of people perhaps maybe
[7:18] we'd say a tenth of all the world's
[7:20] harvest through the ages would be that
[7:23] elected it's been Collins
[7:24] law I believe and as a father with an
[7:29] epileptic son years the goals that help
[7:31] thou my unbelief we hear this question
[7:37] asked one day when he returns would he
[7:41] find faith he never questioned whether
[7:45] we find righteousness or where they
[7:46] would find Christians but would he find
[7:49] faith 20 returned knowing that it be one
[7:52] thing people let go on
[7:56] hearing also the Holy Spirit speaking in
[7:58] the last days at how these times have
[8:01] come man would have a form of godliness
[8:04] but would deny the power lack of faith
[8:09] we thank the Lord tonight because it in
[8:13] our hearts we feel that we have just a
[8:16] little faith and help us Lord and that
[8:19] faith may be increased the night until
[8:22] it be so high so lost and complete
[8:26] serenity Christ
[8:28] I know great mighty works will be gone
[8:31] tonight in my name cast out devils be
[9:01] for this time take up serpents and drink
[9:04] up daily saying it what's the harm they
[9:07] shall recover right anywhere easy

[9:12] audible on the earth content types

[9:21] faceless these signs shall follow them
[9:24] that believe

[9:31] find things when I return I need ever
[9:34] Sybil I find righteousness will I find a
[9:37] church well I find people he said well I

[9:45] day my neighbor my encompasses Billy a
[9:49] [Music]

[9:54] about midnight does that little pastor
[9:56] run in coffee with us they took our two
[10:00] elevators houses shook hands of them
[10:02] this and put a cart gaming instead on
[10:04] played cards of them so it is a sociable
[10:07] this is never you've ever seen so all we
[10:09] loving we wouldn't get rid of him for
[10:11] nothing
[10:11] I stood there looking on so well so
[10:15] don't you think of every church needs a
[10:17] man like that I couldn't answer then he
[10:23] said in another one place that they had
[10:24] such a lovely place this minister and
[10:26] his wife lovely people went out and deal
[10:28] with the children so much tell he had a
[10:31] Bible School instead they just had some

[10:58] hold up cried a big meanie I gets a big
[11:02] blaspheme any as somebody say something
[11:05] bad about you although we were learn
[11:06] something like that I thought about that
[11:09] this boys come to me said that man's all
[11:11] right if they're doing this but I never
[11:13] called you to do that I've told you to
[11:15] take the stories and they're like Joshua
[11:17] and chow
[11:20] the relative of society or some church
[11:23] organization but challenge the devil
[11:26] pain to the forefront make right
[11:29] Roseanna preach the word and find out
[11:32] who's got the fainting haven't you
[11:38] noticed recently it has been and the
[11:41] meetings where I've been holding all
[11:43] around nationwide and in to Juba and
[11:47] down into the islands every time an
[11:50] interpretation comes it's always if thou
[11:53] will believe my urgency believe it all
[11:57] that was a question Jesus as will I find
[12:01] fate when our return did stable on
[12:04] buying churches will I find religion but
[12:07] will I find dating not even needed
[12:11] question C R D buddy question faith
[12:14] because design in the scripture of
[12:16] Malachi for that there is to be an
[12:18] analogy come down and to restore again
[12:23] that original faith and to bring the
[12:26] faith of the people back
[12:27] the original 50 cause that makes
[12:29] possible more than ivory should not see

[12:39] then restore back again that
[12:43] fathers won't see the revelation of God

[12:46] [Music]
[12:51] he knew that these great trying times
[12:56] had come to prove all nations and
[12:59] approve all people's so therefore he
[13:03] knew that the great question made not
[13:06] whether he would rise again by whether
[13:09] ever be crucified according to the
[13:12] scriptures but not whether he would have
[13:15] sinned on high and the holy spirits of
[13:17] junk but the question was would that be
[13:23] any faith left on earth at his coming
[13:26] and where is faith comes by hearing the
[13:29] Word of God that was his question will
[13:36] there be faith on earth when I come will

[1:11:10] after years and years of brother Branham
[1:11:13] being gone for 50 something years but we
[1:11:16] are still pressing on hallelujah I don't
[1:11:21] care what the critics say the prophets
[1:11:24] message is correct
[1:11:25] [Applause]
[1:11:28] it is the sister Lord it is here and a
[1:11:33] man this message is our life I don't
[1:11:40] care what they say about the Prophet I
[1:11:42] don't care what they say about the cloud
[1:11:44] it is thus saith the Lord the prophesy
[1:11:49] to make reliever has to be here they are
[1:11:53] fulfilling Malachi 4 we are Eagles
[1:11:57] we are not sparrows the sparrow will go
[1:12:02] to the light and beat the light and beat
[1:12:05] the light and beat the light until they
[1:12:08] beat their brains out and their light
[1:12:10] dead on the ground
[1:12:12] we are not sparrows we are Eagles
[1:12:16] Alleluia amen thank God for this message
[1:12:19] I give God glory and praise to be
[1:12:23] identified with it for some several
[1:12:26] years amen god is great I want to bring
[1:12:30] a message today I'm taking brother
[1:12:33] branham's tight off it's called
[1:12:36] time-tested faith time-tested faith from
[1:12:43] his message in 1958 I believe just after
[1:12:47] he preached time-tested memorials and I
[1:12:50] praise God for brother Branham and I
[1:12:52] would like us to stand to our feet just
[1:12:55] to take a few scriptures and tonight we
[1:12:58] go as the Lord would lead us and I
[1:13:00] shan't keep you long at all I would like
[1:13:03] to I think Habakkuk 2:3 belongs in this
[1:13:07] convention with that beautiful
[1:13:10] inspiration brother Thompson a man shall
[1:13:13] he find faith I believe this belongs
[1:13:15] here and I will read this and a few
[1:13:18] other scriptures just to get us in line
[1:13:20] for the message tonight have a cup 2 3 4
[1:13:24] the vision is not yet for an appointed
[1:13:28] time but at the end it shall speak
[1:13:34] and not lie though it Terry wait for it
[1:13:40] because it will surely come it will not
[1:13:45] tarry praise be to God I would like to
[1:13:49] add into that Isaiah 55 and first eleven
[1:13:54] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[1:13:59] of my mouth it shall not return void
[1:14:03] unto me but it shall accomplish that
[1:14:07] which I please and it shall prosper in
[1:14:11] the thing we're on to I sent it a man
[1:14:16] finally I believe the scripture belongs
[1:14:19] in the message tonight 1 Corinthians 13
[1:14:22] and verse 8 charity never faileth
[1:14:29] hallelujah whether there be prophecies
[1:14:33] they shall fail whether there be tongues
[1:14:36] they shall cease whether there be
[1:14:40] knowledge it shall vanish away a man
[1:14:44] praise God Lord Jesus these few words
[1:14:47] tonight Lord only you can take the lid
[1:14:51] off the word we pray that you would do
[1:14:54] so Lord and get glory to yourself Lord
[1:14:59] as it was on the road to Emmaus when
[1:15:02] Jesus spoke to them and their hearts
[1:15:05] were burning and burning may that come
[1:15:09] to pass throughout this convention that
[1:15:11] we may know it was Jesus talking to us
[1:15:14] along the way bless every heart and my
[1:15:18] objective is to be a simple
[1:15:20] encouragement to the bride that at the
[1:15:22] end we may say I feel encouraged to
[1:15:25] pressed about all granted Lord we give
[1:15:28] you honor and praise in Jesus Christ
[1:15:30] wonderful name amen amen you can be
[1:15:33] seated
[1:15:39] of course Luke is a very central
[1:15:42] Scripture today and for the rest of the
[1:15:45] convention and he goes on to say
[1:15:47] nevertheless when the Son of Man comes
[1:15:51] shall he find faith on the earth and the
[1:15:54] amplified calls that persistence in
[1:15:57] faith amen or perseverance in faith
[1:16:00] praise be to God and so I believe that
[1:16:03] he's looking for faith I believe mama
[1:16:06] Eagle is flying over looking for faith
[1:16:09] hallelujah and he's finding faith amen
[1:16:13] the chickens are not responding but the
[1:16:15] Eagles are responding yes yes amen what
[1:16:20] you're doing I can do that as well
[1:16:22] praise be to God so we give God the
[1:16:25] glory and we give him the honor for all
[1:16:28] that he's done in our life yes it's been
[1:16:33] a long time since brother Branham was
[1:16:35] here
[1:16:36] 53 something years but we give God
[1:16:40] thanks that we are still pressing on the
[1:16:42] battle we are still fighting the good
[1:16:45] fight of faith nothing is going to stop
[1:16:47] us god bless brother thompson for this
[1:16:49] inspiration it is so powerful I thought
[1:16:53] of putting slides but it was just
[1:16:55] changing and exploding and I couldn't
[1:16:58] really structure it into a presentation
[1:17:00] but I believe it would help somebody
[1:17:03] along their way today that is my prayer
[1:17:06] what a blessing brother Thompson has
[1:17:08] been around the world in London he once
[1:17:11] preached a message called be careful
[1:17:13] Satan and we never forgot that
[1:17:15] inspiration my and we are still saying
[1:17:18] be careful Satan can be your shot be
[1:17:21] careful Satan
[1:17:24] [Music]
[1:17:26] hallelujah time tested faith now you
[1:17:33] know I realize that this the whole
[1:17:35] inspiration is about the second coming
[1:17:37] of Christ I'm just going to show you
[1:17:39] some interesting parallels with the
[1:17:46] first coming of Christ
[1:17:48] you know since Malachi 2 Matthew was 400
[1:17:55] years they call it the thank you they
[1:17:59] call it the 400 silent years how many's
[1:18:04] heard of the 400 silent years yeah there
[1:18:10] was no prophet it was just real quiet
[1:18:13] they had a long time to forget the
[1:18:17] prophets to forget the prophecies to be
[1:18:21] under no expectation at all
[1:18:25] for anything we think 53 is long what
[1:18:30] about 400 400 silent years now making a
[1:18:39] parallel with his first coming when
[1:18:42] Jesus came what would he find what would
[1:18:46] he find let me tell you God doesn't fail
[1:18:50] when he says something it has to come to
[1:18:53] pass after all that time when he came to
[1:18:58] the Virgin Mary and he told her what the
[1:19:01] agenda was and he took that old prophecy
[1:19:04] and he brought it to life Mary did not
[1:19:09] say what she said according to thy word
[1:19:12] be it unto me and that's what we are
[1:19:16] saying tonight according to my word Lord
[1:19:18] be it unto me
[1:19:20] hallelujah she was completely faith it
[1:19:24] was Mary's belief and there was no
[1:19:28] belief like Mary's belief Christ was
[1:19:31] born few people realized it Mary brought
[1:19:36] the baby into the temple everybody
[1:19:39] forgot we'll just baby baby baby baby
[1:19:42] but there was one old man oh when I come
[1:19:49] well I find faith God had revealed to
[1:19:53] him that he would not die but he would
[1:19:57] see the Lord he took that baby in his
[1:20:01] arms and he said O God let me return I
[1:20:05] can die now I have seen my salvation
[1:20:09] hallelujah glory will I find faith is
[1:20:14] that faith it was revealed to him faith
[1:20:18] is a revelation and if that wasn't
[1:20:21] enough there was an old blind lady
[1:20:23] called Anna who came walking up and she
[1:20:27] said redemption has come to Jerusalem
[1:20:30] hallelujah glory to God thank you Jesus
[1:20:34] you can't get away from it
[1:20:36] amen after 400 years John the Baptist
[1:20:40] stood there and he said behold the lamb
[1:20:44] of God was coming to take the sins of
[1:20:47] the world away behold the lamb of God I
[1:20:51] am not worthy to loosen your shoes
[1:20:54] I'm not worthy to baptize you John was
[1:20:57] in the faith and if that was not enough
[1:20:59] way over in the East there was a wise
[1:21:03] man hallelujah
[1:21:06] wise men today we would call them wise
[1:21:10] virgins hallelujah wise men brother when
[1:21:15] they came to Jerusalem they never said
[1:21:18] you know what's going on they said
[1:21:20] listen we have seen his star we have
[1:21:24] seen his star and we have come all this
[1:21:27] way to worship Him
[1:21:29] where is he King of the Jews oh you talk
[1:21:33] about a shaking or what a shaking they
[1:21:36] came they oh my god
[1:21:38] Church what a day we're living in now we
[1:21:41] have come all this way to worship the
[1:21:43] Lord I've come from London to
[1:21:46] Johannesburg to worship the Lord who
[1:21:48] feels the same way we have come from a
[1:21:51] long way we come so far so far so far to
[1:21:56] praise the Lord hallelujah I feel so
[1:21:59] good today when he comes will he find
[1:22:01] faith yes hallelujah glory let me read
[1:22:06] some quotes to you hallelujah Simeon was
[1:22:11] a righteous man Anna was a prophetess
[1:22:13] John the Baptist amen these people were
[1:22:18] looking for the coming of the Lord amen
[1:22:21] I want to pick up with what brother
[1:22:23] Thompson said he said this is where the
[1:22:26] shaking comes this is the shaking
[1:22:30] because people think it's nothing it's
[1:22:36] not nothing
[1:22:36] this is real
[1:22:39] you'll find this beautifully preached in
[1:22:41] Revelation chapter 4 part 1 he says here
[1:22:45] is where the shaking comes he says the
[1:22:48] holy spirit comes to those who God has
[1:22:52] called is that this a great shaking
[1:22:56] amongst the elect great powerful thing
[1:23:01] is going on in Johannesburg here and the
[1:23:05] world knows nothing about it but we are
[1:23:08] shouting we are singing we are glorified
[1:23:12] God is shaking we are the power that's
[1:23:17] shaking the hour I feel so happy that I
[1:23:22] know that Jesus is here Messiah is on
[1:23:27] the earth
[1:23:28] now hallelujah glory to God man it was
[1:23:35] great but they didn't know it and so is
[1:23:40] the gospel today great
[1:23:43] the gospel is shaking like it never
[1:23:47] shook before it's a shaking in the
[1:23:50] remnant but God is fixing them ready God
[1:23:55] is fixing me he's fixing you he's fixing
[1:23:59] us to be ready because the rapture is
[1:24:01] the reality we must have rapturing faith

[1:24:06] it'll be there don't worry it'll be
[1:24:09] there don't have to be anxious don't

[1:26:08] concerning me and V in Kadesh Barnea
[1:26:13] caleb was not playing games he was not
[1:26:17] playing Church Caleb didn't wait for
[1:26:19] somebody else to say hallelujah and then
[1:26:21] he said hallelujah Caleb was praising
[1:26:25] God because he knew what Moses told him

[1:26:47] Caleb as we see the Promised Land coming
[1:26:51] in sight its nearing the time to be
[1:26:54] given it's been a long time that it's

[1:28:12] they began to doubt there was a big
[1:28:13] thing and then even in the days of Caleb
[1:28:17] you know something a lot of people never
[1:28:19] possessed and they never in dude place
