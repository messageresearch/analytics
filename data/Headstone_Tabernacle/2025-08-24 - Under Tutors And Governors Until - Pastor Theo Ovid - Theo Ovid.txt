I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but holy lean on Jesus name. On Christ the solid rock I stand. All of the ground is sinking sand. All of the ground is sinking sand. When darkness seems to hide his face, I rest on his unchanging grace. In every silent stormy gale, my anchor holds within the bear. Oh, on Christ the solid rock I stand.

One more time, lift your hand and close your eyes and say, "We give you all. [Music] We worship you alone. You are worthy to be praised. Let's just worship the Lord this morning. Father, we praise you and bless you. Thank you for your presence this morning. Thank you for your spirit, Father. Thank you for the anointing that bring you may come in a special way and speak to your hearts this morning. Take me out of the way and be glorified and love it. In Jesus name we ask it. Amen. And amen. God bless you and welcome this morning. If you have your Bibles, I'd like you to turn to Galatians chapter 4. We want to read from verse 1 to6 and Titus chapter 1. We want to read verse 5 to 11. Reading Galatians chapter 4. Now I say that the heir as long as he's a child different nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all, but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. Even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world. But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because ye are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying above father. And reading from Titus chapter one, reading from verse five, Paul speaks. For this cause left ID in cree, that thou should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I have appointed thee. If any, be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot or unruly. For a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God, not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to whine, no striker, nor given to filthy Luca, but a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temporate, holding fast the faithful word as he had been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainers. For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, especially the day of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not for filthy Lucas sake. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word. Interpret it our hearts. But I know this is a special service and I pray that your anointing will come down and teach us and speak to us in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Give the Lord some praises as you have your seat. &gt;&gt; So this has been upon me for a while now. This particular message and the title I have here is under tutors and governors until. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Under tutors and governors until &gt;&gt; I have a subject. Every ear must pass through tutors and governors. &gt;&gt; That's a subject. Every ear must pass through tutors and governors and have an inspiration. And that's from Titus. setting in order the things that are wanting &gt;&gt; or to set right what was defective or finish what was left undone &gt;&gt; so we see what the Lord will take us to this morning this is a very is a teaching and um I think that um is a very very important message &gt;&gt; brother Brian the word nicolatan comes from two Greek words niko which is to conquer leos which means the lady in fact somebody was doing something in that early church that was conquering the lady. If the lady is being conquered, there must have been some authority there doing it. What was in that God hated that was happening to the church. What was going on then and is now going on today is exactly what the word nicolatan means. the people was being subjected somehow in a way that was absolutely contrary to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now to get the real meaning of what we are to go into, I must caution you to ever keep in mind that rel religious matters if you like is composed of two parts that entwine but are opposite as black and white. Religion and the spiritual world are made up of these two trees which had their roots in Eden. Both the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt their branches in inter intertwine each other. &gt;&gt; Thus in the Ephesians church is the same paradox. The church is made up of good and bad. &gt;&gt; A lot of people don't understand this. A lot of people figure the church only have good people in it &gt;&gt; and their church is the only good one or the bride one and whatn not which is the foolishness. The church here we go is made up of good and bad. &gt;&gt; The two vines make the church. &gt;&gt; They are like the wheat and tears growing side by side. &gt;&gt; One is the true, the other is the false. &gt;&gt; Now God will speak to each one &gt;&gt; and he will talk about each one. He will call them the church. But only the elect will really know which is the true spirit. &gt;&gt; Only the elect will not be deceived. &gt;&gt; Scripture Matthew 24:24, they shall rise false Christ, false prophets, and shall shows great signs and wonders in so much if it was possible, they shall deceive the very elect. &gt;&gt; So way back in the early church, the false vine got to inter intertwine itself around the true vine. And we find these deeds of the nicolatans. Yeah. And that spirit is going to be found fighting the true vine &gt;&gt; until it is destroyed by God. &gt;&gt; You don't ever find the true fighting the false. &gt;&gt; You always find the false fighting the true. &gt;&gt; It's a one-way thing going on here now. Because the devil want to out your light &gt;&gt; because God give you a light. &gt;&gt; God put something inside of you. &gt;&gt; You may not be conscious of it. You may not be aware of it. It has not been revealed to you, but it's still there. doesn't change what inside of you. What God put inside of you, it doesn't change whatsoever. &gt;&gt; Let's go. What was the spiritual climate of that church? It had left it first love. Remember the rebuke, return to your first love. &gt;&gt; It has left its first love. And the word of God revealed to us as having fallen from the original which was Pentecost. In plain English, that means this church was in danger of being taken away from the leading of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and the control of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; This is exactly what took place after Moses led Israel out of Egypt. The way of God was to lead him by the cloud of fire, prophetic utterance, miracles and signs, and God-given wonders. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was the way the church was supposed to leave. When the pillar of fire moved, everybody get up and move. When the cloud move, everybody get up and move. Nobody here at camping because they want to camp. They moving with the cloud. They're moving with the fire. They're moving with the anointing. They're moving with the prophetic utterance. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is how the church, remember, they were the people of God until they were called out. And when they got called out, become the church of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So, what's something? This was to be accomplished by God selected, &gt;&gt; God ordained, &gt;&gt; God equipped and God sent men &gt;&gt; with the whole camp being dominated by a Holy Ghost move. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; That is how God wanted it. That was God's desire that the whole camp be dominated by the Holy Ghost move. They rebelled &gt;&gt; and wanted a set of rules and quits to go by. &gt;&gt; Then they wanted a king &gt;&gt; and brother Isaac had a profile of the rise and fall of Saul. &gt;&gt; And it's an important teaching. You should go and listen back to it. How this young nice man, that's a man you would like to for to marry your daughter, &gt;&gt; goodly man, &gt;&gt; humble man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Good family, good breeding. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Start off good. Amen. &gt;&gt; End up off key because he have a issue with obedience. &gt;&gt; And through Saul's experience is where those notable words came out to obey is better than sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. When God given instructions is for you to obey, not to question, not to wonder, no, obey what God have said. &gt;&gt; And God will speak to you this morning by the word. All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's go. &gt;&gt; So they wanted to be exactly like the world &gt;&gt; and went into complete apostasy and oblivion. That is exactly how the first church age started. &gt;&gt; It will get worse and worse until the Holy Spirit is completely rejected &gt;&gt; and God must destroy the people. &gt;&gt; How it started in the early church? It was called deeds. Yes. &gt;&gt; Then it become a doctrine, &gt;&gt; a deed of the nickelian. &gt;&gt; Then it become the doctrine of the nickel. And here this part. Then it become a standard. &gt;&gt; It become an unbending way. &gt;&gt; This is how we see it in the message. The message standard unbended way. It finally took over and God was pushed aside. &gt;&gt; Now listen when you I keep your ears up now. It started so small, &gt;&gt; so quietly, so inoffensively. It looked so good. It seemed so strong. Then it caught a hole like a python and it squeeze out the very breath and kill all the spirituality there was in the church. &gt;&gt; That false vine is subtle. &gt;&gt; It's like an angel of light &gt;&gt; until it gets a hold of you. &gt;&gt; I want to say that I believe in leadership. Listen to these words now. But it is not the leadership of men I believe in. &gt;&gt; I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; coming through the word. &gt;&gt; I believe also that God has set men in the church, men who are gifted by the spirit &gt;&gt; and they will keep the church in order. &gt;&gt; I believe that also that the church is ruled over by men that God sends to take charge. But is a but with it. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; that rule is by the word. &gt;&gt; So it's not the man in charge, it's the word in charge. &gt;&gt; So if you're being taught and fed the word, you know that is God coming to you in the form of the word. &gt;&gt; The man is only a channel, &gt;&gt; a vessel &gt;&gt; being used to get this word to you. So it's not about the man, it's about the word coming through the man. [Music] &gt;&gt; I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God sends to take charge. But that rule is by the word so that it is not men really ruling but the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; For the word and spirit are one. Hebrews 13:7 says, "Remember them that have rule over you, &gt;&gt; who have spoken unto you the word of God whose faith follow &gt;&gt; considering the end of their conversation." &gt;&gt; And that word conversation knows life &gt;&gt; amplified. Observe attentively and consider their manner of living the outcome of well spent lives and imitate their fate. &gt;&gt; That's what that word is about. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now we see what's happening back there. That false vine was getting a hold and it was teaching that rulership by man was right. It taught that the church had to be governed. It taught a control over the people. But instead of doing it God's way, they simply took authority and vested all the spiritual powers in their own hands &gt;&gt; and came out with a holy priesthood &gt;&gt; standing between God and the people. &gt;&gt; So that is why you have ministers have hold the keys to your life which is foolishness like them is some T key or something. So &gt;&gt; them have the key and unless you you come through them you wouldn't get the key. &gt;&gt; Is that right? That is that what Jesus told Peter? He said, "Upon this rock, &gt;&gt; what was just revealed to him, I will build my church." That mean you could be backs in 50 years. You walk in here this morning and God could give you a revelation. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; That is God speaking to you. God dealing with you. God revealing himself to you. God freeing you. &gt;&gt; That is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] And the beauty about that, he doesn't have to ask anybody permission to bless you, &gt;&gt; to deliver you, to heal you, &gt;&gt; to free you, to revive you. He doesn't have to ask anybody permission to do that. You could be delivered this morning. &gt;&gt; Your mind battle, your fears, whatever you're going through, God could break that off of you this morning. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus never asked anybody how long in that condition. Praise God. He never asked anybody how long you're sow, how long you're blind, how long you're crippled. He said, "Loose them and let them go." Give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said, "Pick up your bed and walk." He not asking how long you're in that bed. You're not asking how long you up. You're not asking how long you b you want to go free this morning. You could go free this morning. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Imagine this what Abraham saying they went back to the old ironic system. &gt;&gt; They became antichrist for the dispose of his leadership and imposed their own and God hated that. &gt;&gt; Anytime the man come between God and the people, God hates that. &gt;&gt; The Ephesians hated that. And any true believer will hate it too. &gt;&gt; We would find we have to be stone blind to see that the same thing to at work at through the ages and right now is the worst of all. What was it? Organization &gt;&gt; that separated the people cause God's people are supposed to be one. But the ministers, the pastors, the bishop, the so-called &gt;&gt; niko &gt;&gt; separating the churches &gt;&gt; by their teachings and doctrines that they right and this one wrong, this one wrong, this one wrong, this one wrong. And when they talk about this one wrong, this one, this wrong. What they really telling people without saying it, I right? You know, every wrong &gt;&gt; and the people afterwards their brain get washed, that we get brainwashed. When their brain get washed with that enough, they actually begin to believe &gt;&gt; that what they're receiving and hearing is right. &gt;&gt; In other words, they are deceived &gt;&gt; by what they believe &gt;&gt; because you're supposed to believe the word &gt;&gt; what God said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why do you say about because the prophet said the spirit and the prophet &gt;&gt; and the bride will say the same thing &gt;&gt; and what they say will be already said in the word. [Applause] So you not hearing any new thing this morning. I'm not bringing a new revelation like you never hear before. This is the same thing to put you in remembrance of these things that you may know what you're fighting against, what you're battling against. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hear this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's people are supposed to be one. &gt;&gt; Yes. By one spirit are they all baptized into one body. &gt;&gt; Not join church. &gt;&gt; Baptized into the body. &gt;&gt; We preach on that the other day. Play body. &gt;&gt; Baptiz. &gt;&gt; All right. Now watch this part. But by one spirit they all baptized into one body. And everyone shout out everyone. &gt;&gt; Everyone &gt;&gt; is to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's not a pastor thing. &gt;&gt; There's not a elder thing. There's not a deacon thing and usher thing. &gt;&gt; Everyone. &gt;&gt; Shout out everyone again. &gt;&gt; Everyone &gt;&gt; is to be moved upon &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And everyone &gt;&gt; is to participate &gt;&gt; in the worship of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm a elder. I can't praise God. &gt;&gt; I'm a pastor. I can't worship. &gt;&gt; I higher than that. Is that right? I ain't seen that in the word, you know. Because when the lamb took the book, the elders showed down the crown. They said about worthy is the lamb. Blessing and honor, might and power, dominion. And when John saw his name, he had a shout. [Applause] When you see your name, I don't time to fix your hair or or fix your tie. It's time to give God praises. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Watch this. &gt;&gt; Everyone is to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost. Everyone is to participate in worship of God. But men wanted the preeminence. &gt;&gt; So they took over control. &gt;&gt; And bishops become archbishops. But the bishop a short title put an arch on top of that. &gt;&gt; With opposing titles, they bypassed the word of God &gt;&gt; and taught their own doctrines. &gt;&gt; So now all them is own prophets. They bringing their own revelation. &gt;&gt; One time I hear pastor say pick up a pack of cigarette and preach thinking man filter. So he could pick up &gt;&gt; a chewing gum. &gt;&gt; He could pick up eating and preach on it. &gt;&gt; Yes. They're the own prophets. Watch. They got the people to obey them &gt;&gt; until the time came that their way of worship did not in any way at all resemble the early days after Pentecost. &gt;&gt; These deeds were beginning of the apostolic succession. From apostolic succession, it was one easy step to church membership &gt;&gt; as a means of saving grace. &gt;&gt; The word was reduced to a creed. &gt;&gt; The antichrist spirit by his spirit was predominating the church. &gt;&gt; Now, this is Bible preaching. This is Bible teaching that people with jacket and tire, but it's devil behind there. &gt;&gt; Lucifer behind there to wreck the church. The church not supposed to be cold and formal and dead. The church should be a channel of power. When devils come and devils tremble because of what the church supposed to be, how the church supposed to be and the atmosphere the church supposed to be in. &gt;&gt; That is why we have to fight. I am in the message. &gt;&gt; I'm a believer. Believer of what? The devil believe too. Which one are you? You have to fight for more than that. &gt;&gt; All this is a backdrop you know to where we going you know &gt;&gt; because you have to begin to see if a son then an heir. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; If you are son you have property. &gt;&gt; If you are a son you have inheritance. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; If you're a church member you don't have to kill. But if you are son you are heir &gt;&gt; because your father is the boss. Your father is in charge. Your father is the king. Your father have a kingdom. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Your father have the power. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. &gt;&gt; But nic means to conquer Leo the lady. Now, why is this such a terrible thing? It is terrible because God has never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership which moves with political mindedness. &gt;&gt; So, what he's saying, these men become church politicians, &gt;&gt; parliamentarians, that where they're supposed to be &gt;&gt; in government. He has placed his church &gt;&gt; in the care of god orained &gt;&gt; spiritfilled &gt;&gt; word living men. &gt;&gt; Listen who lead the people through feeding them the word. &gt;&gt; So you can't come expecting what I dreamed last night. &gt;&gt; That can help you. You can't come and get I expect some revelation I have about Ukraine and Russia and and and and &gt;&gt; Mr. Harif. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the prophet carefully place these things. God ordained. &gt;&gt; That mean he's not there by accident. &gt;&gt; It mean the people are finding tall looking this. Aha. Let's get in there. No. God ordained, &gt;&gt; spiritfilled, &gt;&gt; word living, &gt;&gt; who lead the people through feeding them the word, &gt;&gt; not feeding them the man's ideas. Well, a feeling and a feel what what you're feeling hand on the field is what God said. &gt;&gt; If ea told that devil what God said and stayed there, the devil is on a chance, you know. &gt;&gt; But the devil come and say, "God knows. God knows &gt;&gt; that if you eat this tree, you'll be wise to be just like God. That was the attraction. &gt;&gt; That was the motivation to get more knowledge, to get more wisdom, to get more understanding. And the Bible speaks in the last days there will be people with itching ears, &gt;&gt; for new revelation, &gt;&gt; for more revelation, because the vision is true, but the time was long. Oh, give the Lord a shout. This prophetic vision released by Malachi 4 is true. But the time was long. So people get weary and tired of hearing the same old promises. But Peter said by these promises we become partakers of his divine nature. Oh the Lord a shout in the house. Oh glory to God. My God. My God. My God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I feel the anointing in this place. The vision is true, but the time is long. Look how long brother Brandham said. When they take the pope out of America and put it in the Vatican, it has come to pass. Or give the Lord a shout. The vision is true. The vision is true. [Music] [Applause] He had a vision. He said the bride had no revival yet. It will take them seven tenders to wake up the bride. He will send it. He promise it. He will send it. He promise it. The vision is true. The time might be long, but the vision is true. He promise it. He will send it. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Let's go. [Music] Over [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the years, &gt;&gt; we have encountered message people &gt;&gt; who donkey ears in churches 10 years, 15, 20 years. &gt;&gt; And when they start to speak certain things, they're clueless. &gt;&gt; You want to know what on earth they hearing? &gt;&gt; What on earth they being taught? &gt;&gt; They're being taught. Yes. &gt;&gt; They're being preached through every Sunday, every Wednesday or Thursday, wherever. But not the message, &gt;&gt; not the promise. All kind of cuckoo thing. &gt;&gt; This may sound like a joke, but not a joke. This a serious thing. &gt;&gt; A brother give a testimony of the pastor say when he watch his father foot, he recognized his father too and his two is the same to &gt;&gt; adoption time. I would be so embarrassed to even speak that. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine that? &gt;&gt; You watch your father turn look at your toes. I trust on my father that there's a message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We read the scripture. The son &gt;&gt; even though he's a son, &gt;&gt; even though he's a heir, &gt;&gt; is under tutors and governors &gt;&gt; until &gt;&gt; the time appointed by the father. &gt;&gt; So a child is no different from a servant &gt;&gt; because you cannot give a child inheritance. You cannot give a child position. The child have to be trained &gt;&gt; or tutored or directed or guided until the child come to maturity to handle responsibility. The Bible said this way. When I was a child, spake like a child, taught like a child, understood as a child, but when I become a man, I put away. Glory to the Lord. I shout in the house. There are too many people not putting away stuff. You got to put away. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God, let me let me hit you a little bit now. God is not coming to put away for you. that come like you have the broom and man if I have dirt in the house and you asking God angel hallelujah glory hallelujah angel would you come down in the name of Jesus and take that boom and give me a sweep &gt;&gt; angel will tell my job &gt;&gt; talking to the wrong man &gt;&gt; I a come to sweep no broom &gt;&gt; I dirt it yet &gt;&gt; I had the dust Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Clean up the room, Jesus. Hallelujah. Glory to the angels. &gt;&gt; Angel will come now, you know, and show which the broom is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Obviously, you forget where the broom is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The rise and fall of King Saul. &gt;&gt; What is astonishing is when they're looking for Saul and calling for him, &gt;&gt; he hiding. God to find him. He be behind you here. &gt;&gt; Saul don't want to be identified. Saul don't want to be called out. Saul humble in heart. &gt;&gt; He's hiding &gt;&gt; from the ministry God called him for. &gt;&gt; His problem wasn't woman like Samson. &gt;&gt; His problem was obedience. &gt;&gt; His problem was patience. &gt;&gt; His problem was waiting on God &gt;&gt; and waiting for God. And the prophet said waiting on God and waiting for God is where perfection lies. &gt;&gt; Because in waiting is where your faith grow and mature. &gt;&gt; That's why God will give his children everything they want, when they want, how they want it, he make it a wait. That's why the Bible says under tutors and governors until &gt;&gt; you can't tell the father hey until &gt;&gt; because there was a young man who told his father an in entitled in disciplined young man &gt;&gt; who wants his or now he said I ain't wait for the dead no daddy &gt;&gt; he could have told his son son you're not ready &gt;&gt; you're not mature you want to flirt with your friends you want to buy a fancy car painted in a fancy color and You want to beat yourself all around the country that you have better than them. &gt;&gt; That young man said, "Give me my portion." Now that is getting inheritance. Oh, glory before maturity &gt;&gt; before the time. &gt;&gt; Now tutors and governors and we will get into it. The tutor part is to teach your character, &gt;&gt; behavior, and attitude. The governor is the trusty part that holds your wealth, that takes care of your business until you come to maturity, until you could handle, until they could sign or get the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; In the Greek is not the same word. It said tutors and governors. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your blessing could be delayed, &gt;&gt; but it can't be denied. Oh, preach back to me somebody. Preach back to me somebody. It could be delayed but not denied because you are son and if a son then an airmen. [Music] &gt;&gt; It means you have an inheritance. &gt;&gt; God set it up that way. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; What a brother. He has not separated the people into classes &gt;&gt; so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood. &gt;&gt; It is true that the leadership must be holy but then so must the whole congregation. &gt;&gt; Further, there is no place in the word where priests or ministers or such mediate between God and the people. Nor is there a place where they are separated in their worship of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So people worshiping but ministers taking notes. &gt;&gt; They could take your notes in the stadium room but they don't want to worship. That's a problem. &gt;&gt; The hands stiff &gt;&gt; not with writers &gt;&gt; but with no praise demon to lift their hand and give God glory and shout. &gt;&gt; David was different. When David saw the ark coming down the road, David forget he was king. David forget who his wife was. David forget the throne he was sitting on. He was forgetting the castle he was coming in. He said to dance and dance and dance. His prim and proud wife just got a fresh dress from the same stress. Just tried it on looking to see have a husband how it looking on me and she to look through the window and see him dancing. She felt embarrassed and ashamed. &gt;&gt; So when David come into the house, she wanted to give him mouth. &gt;&gt; She wanted to tell him how she was so embarrassed to say you are the king like you recognize your position in the world. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Recognize who you are. David said, "Woman, you ain't see nothing yet. Come back tomorrow. Come back when this revival strike. Come back with them seven thunders. Utter the voices to that group who could take the word and hand it to them. Give the Lord a shout. You come back. Make a spin and come back. Make a turn and come back. Seven thunders is not dead. It's alive and kicking in Trinidad. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. It's alive and kicking in the bride. &gt;&gt; It's a bright promise. &gt;&gt; Are we not moving from it? &gt;&gt; Give the Lord some praises. [Applause] [Music] They call fire pastor a dead preacher. &gt;&gt; Dead congregation. &gt;&gt; Frozen preacher. &gt;&gt; Congregation frozen to you know &gt;&gt; iceberg preacher. People just cold ice is iceberg. You say no iceberg. &gt;&gt; I am moving &gt;&gt; stiff. The church needs some fire. You know, &gt;&gt; melt the ice. Yes. &gt;&gt; Your fire. You s my next iceberg there. &gt;&gt; Your fire around you burn that ice there. &gt;&gt; Brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What God wants all to love and serve him together. Amen. &gt;&gt; Nicolitism destroyed those precepts &gt;&gt; and instead separates the ministers from the people &gt;&gt; and make the leaders overlords &gt;&gt; instead of servants. &gt;&gt; And years ago, God opened something unto me about servantthood and minister. And I shared with Bleman and he said that is something. I was telling him how the Lord showed me anybody could be a minister. take Bible and preach text and quote and read and have congregation. Anybody could do that. But servant is different. &gt;&gt; Anybody could preach. Anybody could minister. Anybody could start a group and whatnot. But servantthood is when you put on that robe. &gt;&gt; When you have the trade to come to serve, that's servantthood. &gt;&gt; That's a different category altogether. &gt;&gt; Jesus demonstrated it when he says, "Let him that is great among you, let him serve. Jesus demonstrated that [Music] &gt;&gt; when he went and wash your feet &gt;&gt; because that was a servant's position. &gt;&gt; When you come to the house servants, it must wash your feet before you enter into the inner court. [Music] &gt;&gt; Cuz all the street have donkey mess. All the street have horse and all kind of stuff on the street. So when you're walking with them long garments, all your robes have a lot of stuff on it. your foot filthy because in them days didn't have them shoes you have here right now. Them shoes I make yet is sandals. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; So when Jesus come into the man house, his foot sticking up with all them dirt on it and mud on it &gt;&gt; and them slackers they even get somebody to wash his feet &gt;&gt; which was the rule in that day. &gt;&gt; You don't go any man house and just walk inside with a dirty feet like that. There are people with basins to wash your feet &gt;&gt; before you enter into the house to get some food or something like that. &gt;&gt; A prostitute woman see Jesus through a window and wash his feet and say good. The wicked &gt;&gt; them looking at she as wicked. And she said the wicked &gt;&gt; them wicked men inside her there go let the master come and sit down like that. &gt;&gt; When she studied that conviction hit her heart. She had to feel filthy. She start to feel convicted of her sins. She begin to cry. She she she get inside the room. Begin to cry at Jesus' feet. Take her here and wipe his feet. Clean up his feet. And Jesus is saying nothing. Sometimes you're doing something and God is saying nothing. He said look in silence and she is doing her stuff. &gt;&gt; And them big shots. If he only know who kind of what kind of woman is this, he would have never let her do that. If he only know if he sho &gt;&gt; when the woman finished, he broke the Simon with words. &gt;&gt; Simon, I have a word for you. You know, &gt;&gt; I come in here and here and wash my feet. &gt;&gt; This woman whose sins are many, &gt;&gt; so he's showing them he know her condition. &gt;&gt; Her sins are forgiven. &gt;&gt; She is free. I don't know about yours. But this woman here who crying, whose sins are many, who have serious conditions, she free to go. &gt;&gt; And you know who the son of man set free? &gt;&gt; It's free indeed. Oh, get the Lord a shout. I don't care what the church members say. I don't care what people say. I don't care what your neighbors say. Who the son of man set free? &gt;&gt; It's free indeed. Give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. All right. &gt;&gt; Now, this doctrine actually started the deed in the first age. It appears the problem lays in two words. Elders, prospertors, and overseers, bishops. True scripture shows that there are several elders in each church. Some begin inacious among them to teach that the idea of bishop is one of preeminence and authority and control over the elders. &gt;&gt; Now the truth of the matter is the word elder signify who the person is. &gt;&gt; While the word bishop signifies the office of the same man. &gt;&gt; The elder is the man. Bishop is the office of the man. Elder has always and always will refer simply to a man's chronological age in the Lord. He is an elder not because he's elected or ordained, but because he's older. &gt;&gt; He is more seasoned. &gt;&gt; He is trained, not a novice. He is reliable because of experience and longstanding proof of his Christian experience. But no, the bishops did not stick to the epistles of Paul, but rather hear what they do. Rather, they went to Paul's account of the time he called the elders from Ephesus to Miticus in Acts 20 in verse 17, the record said elders were called. Then in verse 28, they were called overseers and bishops. &gt;&gt; So these bishops, they find the right quote. These bishops no doubt politically minded and anxious for power. This is what is lurking in these men. &gt;&gt; So that's how where they connected that &gt;&gt; what politically minded anxious for power insisted that Paul had given the meaning that overseers were more than the local elder with official capacity owning his own church. To them, bishop was now one with extended authority over many local leaders. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This denies the leadership of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; who said, "Separate me Paul and Barnamas for the work where unto I have called them." &gt;&gt; This is anti-word and antichrist. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. We getting somewhere. &gt;&gt; Yes. When Adam sinned by heeding his wife reasoning instead of holding to the God's word, he lost Adam turned loose the word and sold out. Here what he lost. He lost his inheritance when he lost his fellowship &gt;&gt; and right to life. &gt;&gt; So when he lost his life, he also lost his inheritance in life. &gt;&gt; God was the God of the universe. But his son had this earth under his control. He could speak, he could name, he could say, he could stop nature. He could do anything he wanted to. See, but when he did that, he lost his inheritance. &gt;&gt; So that is why this is very important. God restoring man want to restore not only your life but restore your inheritance &gt;&gt; in life. So then this story in the Old Testament when a son is born in a home he is born he's a son of the father but yet here we go before he fell heir to the kingdom of his father or the possession the first that son had to be raised and tried. &gt;&gt; He had to find out whether this son was a true son or he was simply a rostabout. And this son would never be heir if he wasn't qualified &gt;&gt; to take the father's place. &gt;&gt; So this air thing have to do with being qualified for. &gt;&gt; And the only way we could get qualified for is if we go through process. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Let's go. But if he was qualified and took the father's place, then all the father had was given to his son. There is where I think that many of us Pentecostal people have made a mistake. We think here we go. As soon as we become sons and daughters, that settled it. &gt;&gt; We just come but we just come into a place of trying. &gt;&gt; The Methodist said as soon as they shouted, they settled it. &gt;&gt; The Lutherans believe in faith. No matter what kind of position God put you in, you are still growing &gt;&gt; towards perfection. &gt;&gt; So you don't talk about I have arrived. &gt;&gt; Paul didn't talk that way. He said I press &gt;&gt; towards the mark of the high calling &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. Talk like Paul. I press &gt;&gt; now in England he talk about the father. As soon as this child was born, the father being so busy with other things, he sought out a tutor or a razor of his child. Then knowing this child was in line of air of everything he had, his property, his good name, everything he had would go to his son, he sought the very best school teacher he could find to teach the child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Best tutor. &gt;&gt; So, so does God does the same to his children. When a man is born into the body of the Lord Jesus become the son of God. God has sought the heavens for the best tutor he knows to put over his children. And it's not a bishop but it was the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; God put over his church to raise his church to believe in spiritual things and supernatural things. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So people say the days of miracles is passed and all that supernatural is gone. God wouldn't do that. The Holy Spirit was sent to govern and guide the church and God give it to the Holy Spirit to do this. He's got a man that will tell the truth &gt;&gt; for he wanted to know exactly the will for that boy at all times. &gt;&gt; Sometime we ruck on family to lie for us or say the story or twist it a little bit to make it look good and whatn not. So this one say it so and so but the Holy Spirit will always tell &gt;&gt; the truth. &gt;&gt; He has no authority to as you passing it back pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass. See we we do that. Pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast pass nobody see &gt;&gt; everybody supposed to get one slice of cake but take take two tuna nobody &gt;&gt; it's one man &gt;&gt; but you want two and somebody you know who's serving hey feeling cakeish feeling see for more cake but God is not like that he the Holy Ghost will speak the truth &gt;&gt; that's what God did he never trusted with any pope bishop anything else therefore the Holy Spirit will be honest with God how this razor this tutor was supposed to come and bring word to the father how the child was progressing, how the tutor must have blushed if the child was misbehaving itself, how the little boy was not interested in the things of his father, farm or kingdom. So what is a tutor? Tutor a person charged with instruction and guidance of another such as a private teacher. So let's look at Galatians again. I say that the air, as long as he's a child, as long as your behavior is immature and childish, as long as you're not ready yet, you have to be, you must be under truth and governance. Amen. &gt;&gt; So all them believers who sitting home right now self-taught and think they're going in the bride, you know where they going, &gt;&gt; they have a ticket to the tribulation &gt;&gt; because you must be &gt;&gt; under tutors &gt;&gt; and governance &gt;&gt; until the time appointed by the father. &gt;&gt; You must be &gt;&gt; a student can homeschool by yourself. A homeschooling you reading your own book, you doing your own stuff. No, even if somebody's homeschooled, somebody will teach them in that home school. &gt;&gt; They said to be taught because they have an exam coming up &gt;&gt; is not what you know, it's what you have to pass as an exam, &gt;&gt; as a test. &gt;&gt; And a faith that cannot be tested cannot be trusted. &gt;&gt; So when God give you a faith, you have to test that &gt;&gt; to trust that. &gt;&gt; What he give you, you have to test that. &gt;&gt; Not the pastor testing you, God testing you. The issue here is not whether you're a son or not. That the issue is whether you're coming to inheritance. [Music] &gt;&gt; You're not fighting to be a son, you know. It's what kind of son are you? &gt;&gt; I can't say that. I can't say this one is bride. I That's foolishness. I I I picking that. &gt;&gt; I had the book for that. &gt;&gt; God give me a book about bride whose bride is not bright. You are not bride. This one is bride. I am not in a position of that &gt;&gt; because if if you're looking from the eyes of man and you watch Saul who became Paul you will and he was persecuting the church you'll say that man is not no part of a sinner &gt;&gt; Saul Saul riding to kill the Christians and all of a sudden God pillar fire and knock him off &gt;&gt; and but who art thou Lord he come to church now &gt;&gt; he coming to church now &gt;&gt; yesterday he persecuting riding for church next Sunday he in church and &gt;&gt; blind as a bat. Give the Lord a sh [Music] &gt;&gt; and anas have to lay hands upon him for him to get back his sight. &gt;&gt; That is good. &gt;&gt; Bringing a son on the preachers. &gt;&gt; I have an ass from his left hand from his right hand. But an ass have the Holy Ghost. What can the Lord has shouted the house? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I don't care who Saul think he is, what he is, he still have to subject himself to the order that God put there. Holy Ghost, God ordained, spiritfilled, word living men or give the Lord a shout in the house. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Watch this. His calling &gt;&gt; is higher than all those brothers. hard and and yet he have to come through that process. [Music] &gt;&gt; He got come in there blind like a b. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. &gt;&gt; He will come out coming blind and walk out blind. You know, &gt;&gt; so this man called Saul &gt;&gt; had to humble himself. &gt;&gt; Get hands laid upon him. Have believers don't want to shake his hands &gt;&gt; because in he was former &gt;&gt; killer and murderer former &gt;&gt; church persecutor former former &gt;&gt; that is what it is former you have a former life but when God transform your life all the devil talk about former the things I used to do I do them no more the places I used to go don't go no more the things I used to say, "I've been changed." Changed. Change. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; I feel a rumbling in the camp. &gt;&gt; I feel revelation breaking upon you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let me see this. &gt;&gt; After Paul get his eyesight. will ministry. &gt;&gt; I come for it. &gt;&gt; Remember years ago a man say you want back the pulpit. &gt;&gt; I didn't take it. &gt;&gt; If I said I tell you the kind experiences we have been through &gt;&gt; after Paul come through. He going in the desert &gt;&gt; for years &gt;&gt; under the tutor theship of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He never walked with Jesus. &gt;&gt; He never lived with Jesus. He never feed and sit down by Jesus feet. &gt;&gt; Peter did. &gt;&gt; Andrew did. John did but not Paul. But when he went in the parks in the desert, Jesus pillar of fire struck him and give him revelation. When Paul bounced back, so Paul said, "I Paul, prisoner of Jesus Christ. I Paul, an apostle. I Paul, if you don't believe what I say is the commandments of God, let him be ignorant. Paul to the Corinthians church. Paul to the Hebrew church. Paul to the Galatians church. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Come on you sons of God, under tutors, under governors until the time appointed. And when your time come, God will pull you out. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; This is a special service. [Applause] You must be under truth and governors. &gt;&gt; Not them nicolatan spirits. Not them men who taking power over people's lives and controlling what they buy, where they go. I'm not talking about that crazy stuff that we have here in Trinidad. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about that. &gt;&gt; An air. A heir is a child who is legally the future owner of the father's estate. &gt;&gt; Tutors and governors are guardians, stewards, &gt;&gt; overseers who manage the heir's life, &gt;&gt; education, &gt;&gt; and estate. &gt;&gt; So sometime when you have something for a child, you can't give the child. You give the child to in a trustee. &gt;&gt; I forget what form they have in my legal term. I'm not a legal person. But they put it in a way when the child reach 21 years old, &gt;&gt; they have access to it. &gt;&gt; So you could cry at 19 you have to wait &gt;&gt; at 20 and a half you had to wait. &gt;&gt; It's only when you're 21 years old. &gt;&gt; You could walk into the bank or walk in and say yes. &gt;&gt; I want my father left for me my uncle or whoever leave for you. &gt;&gt; But you have to wait. under tutors &gt;&gt; and governors &gt;&gt; the tutor I'll be saying already when prince I can't who they have now prince prince I don't know I don't follow them England thing prince Charles and who the children is and whatn not but when the child is born &gt;&gt; those prince and queen whatever they call them right they born understanding what going on if they born and pack them to train they talk they go taxi and they drop and what normal normal you know If you leave them here, they talk, act, live, stand up to the flag and everything normal, normal, you know, &gt;&gt; but they're not Trinidadians. &gt;&gt; They born to uh uh high lineage or whatever it is. But so, so therefore, they have to train those children &gt;&gt; in the ways of kingship or queenship and the history and lage and they they see all the crowns and your mother was the queen and this and that and that etiquette, how to cut it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some people don't no don't know how to handle that knife and fork. &gt;&gt; Got to know how to do the thing and thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're not willing to learn knife and fork, you can't qualify. You have to learn the etiquette. &gt;&gt; So when they start to take pictures of them after you take picture, you have to don't take picture with child on this side here. &gt;&gt; Afterwards, the children understand pictures is where they go. &gt;&gt; Amen. The paparazzi always following them. Clicks, clicks, wear pink shoes, brown shoes, they like the shoes, all kind of thing. That's news. So they afterwards they get they have this royal kind of life but because of the thinking change because of the tutorship because of the discipline bringing them listen &gt;&gt; the names of these children you can't just pick any name in some cu name they have l you can't put that on princ they have certain names Andrew um Charles certain spec you got to pick one of them you know &gt;&gt; so you can feel led I feel like my my son I want to call him XY and Z cuz nobody have that name. No, it doesn't work. So, so I want to show you something that discipline and restraint is necessary &gt;&gt; in order to get you to the place that God want you to be. God can't risk you being loose &gt;&gt; and give you inheritance. Because I could show you, I've seen my own self that promoting people before time could destroy them. &gt;&gt; Putting power on people before time could wreck them. &gt;&gt; Not everybody could handle power. &gt;&gt; Not everybody could handle money. &gt;&gt; That why some people don't have &gt;&gt; I don't mean that as an excuse or a joke. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't manage 100,000 &gt;&gt; scripture. You have a scripture for that. Sure. He who is faithful in little &gt;&gt; will be faithful in much. &gt;&gt; So God has test your first with little &gt;&gt; to see how you manage. &gt;&gt; It's only 100. How much you want. &gt;&gt; We want to see how you're managing $100. &gt;&gt; You manage it well, you can handle a,000. 100,000 well they get 110,000 &gt;&gt; and because they 10,000 they get 100,000 &gt;&gt; and that's how you can get the million &gt;&gt; the people light face light up already I have no problem with you light up for the million or no &gt;&gt; but the point about it you have to start with 100 &gt;&gt; and many times people don't want &gt;&gt; to go to the hund mind running &gt;&gt; look at Esther Queen Esther Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Modi was a tutor. &gt;&gt; Modi was a governor. &gt;&gt; Modi was given her guidance. &gt;&gt; Morai was saying, "Esther, don't tell them who your people are. &gt;&gt; Keep it locked down. &gt;&gt; I'm feeling led. Hush your mouth, sister. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; Them wild kind of loose lips. &gt;&gt; Esther was going to damage the whole thing earlier. Clock. &gt;&gt; Don't say where your lineage at." Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep quiet. &gt;&gt; Stay humble. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'll get it. &gt;&gt; But under Morai directions, Esther got the breakthrough. &gt;&gt; Esther got the victory. &gt;&gt; How could you get the victory without tutors and governors? &gt;&gt; Without guidance and direction. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Don't fool yourself. There no DIY. DIY, &gt;&gt; do it yourself. &gt;&gt; A lot of things is DIY now. When you do it yourself, plumbing, do yourself this until thing going real bad, you call a real plumber. &gt;&gt; Careful with DIY. You know, &gt;&gt; if a fire start do DIY and say, well, you know, watching it, your house will burn down with that DIY. You know, &gt;&gt; don't do it yourself. God have no do it yourself and be adopted. You're home. You're getting revelation. You're going to fight with brother. You ain't going to that church. You're going to fight. God send me to fight you. &gt;&gt; Do you ever put that in your heart and mind? You're foolish. Lord, &gt;&gt; God have nothing else to do but to send me to fight you. &gt;&gt; See, no, when you think about it carefully, we have one enemy. &gt;&gt; That's the devil. &gt;&gt; We fighting him every day. Your enemy and my enemy is the same enemy. I am not your enemy. &gt;&gt; This word I'm preaching applies to me. &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching down to you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Bible study on Friday. Isaac show is not gift. It's not anointing. It's not testimony. Paul could Saul could say I was anointed by power. who we Samuel himself put the horn of oil upon me wasn't a false prophet was a true prophet anointed me yeah but then when Samuel gave instructions to obey he disobeyed &gt;&gt; and Samuel told Saul you acted foolishly &gt;&gt; you're not a priest you're not a prophet who you offering &gt;&gt; well the people and they get frightening and notice he not accept responsibility &gt;&gt; that is part of the insecurity inside of him &gt;&gt; and when people insecure they can't handle criticism You have to put up your defenses and make excuses, &gt;&gt; blame somebody. &gt;&gt; You misunderstand why I say all kind of excuses. You have to just admit it. &gt;&gt; And if he fail at that, he was a bigger failure for the next test &gt;&gt; cuz the next test God come and tell him kill everything. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Goat, cattle, sheep and don't just don't hold nothing from them people. Every man &gt;&gt; when the battle over Samuel come he say hallelujah glory Bible says you know he said I I have done the will of the Lord and then Sam said what is this bleeting I am hearing &gt;&gt; I ain't supposed to hear nothing bleeding &gt;&gt; I hear bleeding there will be there whose sheep is that he say we save the best to offer to Lord. &gt;&gt; And we have King Aag. &gt;&gt; Big King Agog, &gt;&gt; alive and kicking. &gt;&gt; He come to sacrifice. &gt;&gt; And God tell him kill all. &gt;&gt; Kill all. &gt;&gt; Friends, we have to get more serious about what God saying. If I could fade away and all you could hear is what God say. It is rocking. You know &gt;&gt; I some thunder last night. I know it was raining. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you heard it too. &gt;&gt; That was serious thunder. You know &gt;&gt; I didn't look out. &gt;&gt; I might see lightning to hearing it was good enough. &gt;&gt; Think about it now. &gt;&gt; That's natural thunder rocking hard. No rain falling you know. But you telling yourself rain falling somewhere. That noise upstairs is mean something happening elsewhere. &gt;&gt; It might be by your house but it's elsewhere. &gt;&gt; Well, God coming in thunders just now &gt;&gt; and the thunders going to be judgment &gt;&gt; because the mercy seat is a mercy seat because it have blood on it. &gt;&gt; It's really a judgment seat. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord us praises in his life. So this tutorship, guardianship, &gt;&gt; overseers, over the air's life is for until he comes to maturity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A maturity is when they could move from I have to to I want to. &gt;&gt; Why? Why I had to do that? People young people say it's pulling teeth. Well, I I used to understand that expression. Now I'm learning about it now. trying to pull my teeth. You know was trying to force issue trying to force me to bend and force me and and you see you want to do your own thing. &gt;&gt; That's not what God say here. &gt;&gt; Maturity is when you begin to accept responsibility and you want to do what God wants you to do. [Applause] &gt;&gt; All right. So this until the time appointed &gt;&gt; this and I like the words how you see this D I call it delay. This delay in your blessing or delay in your getting your portion is really to enact development &gt;&gt; until your time appointed. Amen. &gt;&gt; So waiting on God and waiting for God is the process of character development. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; So when God give you a delay is not oh God why you denying me what kind of thing is this you want to give me pressure. No what he wants to do is to bring a development a transformation a change in your life because you're about to be promoted. You have to be able to handle more. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ask all them workers. Look, I see Jason hand there. They will always tell you how the company will send for training and more training and more training. It's not that the company feeling trainish, you know. It's because they are different levels of responsibility &gt;&gt; and some of these jobs are dangerous. &gt;&gt; Turn the valve 10° to the right or the left and you feel turn it more and blow up the whole company, whole place. There's too much people feeling led &gt;&gt; not to subject yourself or obey. &gt;&gt; You can't do your own thing. &gt;&gt; You have to follow instructions. every air &gt;&gt; must pass through tutors, governors, mentors, pastors, &gt;&gt; elders, &gt;&gt; learning, obedience, &gt;&gt; growth through discipline &gt;&gt; and guided by rules. I was listening to something where they saying the young people today have such short attention span. I was telling my wife I want to see a man have sing the road and instead of he hold his juice or whatever he used to sell he on the phone everything set up there he spinning he caught up with whatever he's spinning on his phone. He not bothering with what selling the selling &gt;&gt; and next person hey Three, &gt;&gt; two for five. But I punch you over the thing. &gt;&gt; Two for five. Three for 10. And he pushing the side of the road. And this man spinning the phone. He's a big shot. You are to want it to stop in front of you. I pass him like a full bus. Yes. Now with social media and all these immediate things to get you speedy that is why they end up with the priesthood you know sorry the Catholics love the church you know the priest do a little thing so and sprinkle things so some holy water thing people feel holy after that &gt;&gt; they don't need to repent just &gt;&gt; they even know where that thing come All that ceremony stick all that dipping stick they don't where I come from the siminies witchcraft all can't even mix up in one you know springing thing and the cup going I know you know I was once in that you know so this not here say I reading a book you I was there helping priest thank you Lord [Applause] &gt;&gt; thank Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; I met a priest who all you know &gt;&gt; I tell you one day I read the Bible say call no man father say how the man was father Leo I said father Leo the Bible say father give me one clout behind my head escape down the altar that was the last time you see me you know because I was giving father Leo the word I was going St. Steven's College and they used and somebody the Gideonss people I think they from around the world they used to give out free Bibles and whatnot. I had friends put their Bible in the garbage and whatnot. I started to read a little little New Testament. I said to read it and man that was book was light up my life. &gt;&gt; One scripture Matthew 5:48. Never forget that. Be there for perfect be perfect as your father was perfect. I felt that speak to me. I'm to be perfect. My God I wasn't even repenting yet. I wasn't I was still a sinner but something tell me I am to be perfect. It was something in my soul. Oh glory to God. My friends couldn't stop me from reading that Bible. My friends couldn't stop me from going this way. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Don't let your friend stop you. You be a leader, not a follower. Give the Lord a shout in the house. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't escape this path. The Bible says though he was a son &gt;&gt; Hebrews 5:'8 yet learning obedience &gt;&gt; by the things which he suffered. &gt;&gt; So Jesus learned &gt;&gt; the Bible talk about he increase in wisdom and knowledge &gt;&gt; and found favor with God and man. &gt;&gt; Jesus wasn't a clong. He wasn't a fool. &gt;&gt; He learned how to find favor &gt;&gt; with God and man. &gt;&gt; Some people so spiritual they get manve vex neighbor vex. Everybody vex. and they going to church. &gt;&gt; Joseph love of the father &gt;&gt; hated of his brothers. Father gave a quote of many colors. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He getting visions &gt;&gt; of they bowing to him. He getting visions of power. Visions. And what happened to Joseph? Let me thrown power all your command bow &gt;&gt; he can't work sir they sell him out 14 years old 15 years old to Egypt I had to learn a new language and guess what there's some people when things go negative or things go contrary that's it no they give up you know I learn languages speak my own language speak your own language you'll be like a fool &gt;&gt; how would you be wise how will you get through life &gt;&gt; you have to learn. &gt;&gt; To learn is to grow. &gt;&gt; You have to read. You have to study. Some people are reading nothing. &gt;&gt; What they know is what they have learned for the last 30 years, 40 years. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Learn of me." &gt;&gt; He comes in the learning of his word. &gt;&gt; And I can't bring to you my own thoughts and ideas. I have to bring to you his word that you could learn his word. That's why he take them out of Egypt to bring them to this mountain that they could get a revelation of who God is, &gt;&gt; his ways, his being, how he lives. If you try to serve God outside his word, you serving God by the imagination of your own heart. &gt;&gt; You trying nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The president of America recently said he understand that he's loading on the top pole to go to heaven. So he want peace with Ukraine and Russia because that is increases odds chance of going to heaven. I can't make that up. He here he low down and he want to make it to heaven. A president talking that talk. He hoping if you do a peace deal if he could save 500,000 or 5,000 lives a day from being killed, you know, he stand a chance. &gt;&gt; This say how to stand a chance. &gt;&gt; Repent every one of you and be baptized. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, Joseph dreams and visions didn't have an immediate fulfillment. God put time on it &gt;&gt; because Joseph certainly wasn't ready. &gt;&gt; He had to be sold into Egypt. &gt;&gt; Pressure. &gt;&gt; Learn language. Pressure. Behave well under pressure. &gt;&gt; And still be blessed &gt;&gt; in pressure. &gt;&gt; Okay. Help me somebody. Help me preach somebody now. &gt;&gt; Are you under pressure this morning? &gt;&gt; My God, you're just like Joseph. &gt;&gt; He get blessed to be in piva house. Portifa gardener &gt;&gt; working so good he get promotion &gt;&gt; and promotion sometime is troubling her &gt;&gt; because wife was trouble &gt;&gt; she push Joseph Joseph run out straight out &gt;&gt; he had to know he went to stand when to run he run a man &gt;&gt; a man knows when to run Joseph ran and he end up in prison God bless him in prison &gt;&gt; but he is there somebody could tease him what about the vision get an email Joseph what about the vision you have going hey &gt;&gt; two years pass three years us. &gt;&gt; He didn't give the vision. &gt;&gt; God give the vision. &gt;&gt; The vision is true. &gt;&gt; But the time is long. &gt;&gt; He had to wait until &gt;&gt; the time appointed. &gt;&gt; He interpret the dream of the bottle and the baker. He knew the bottler was going to be restored. &gt;&gt; He said, "When you're going to power, remember me." &gt;&gt; Soon as the man hit that wine and hold that glass, he forget Joseph. &gt;&gt; God wanted the man to forget Joseph &gt;&gt; because Joseph wasn't ready yet. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; And if you're not ready yet, you're under tutors and governors, you're under pressure, you're under trial, you're under testing, you're under tribulation, give the Lord some praises in the house. [Music] &gt;&gt; He said Joseph had to shave &gt;&gt; his beard grow out &gt;&gt; and he said Joseph had to get shave him &gt;&gt; before he was presented. And you say God have to shave us, shave our wills, shave our ways, shave our attitudes. God have to shave us. And when the time come, God gave Pharaoh a dream. &gt;&gt; And when Pharaoh say I will cut off all all your head, all you playing wise men, all you playing this, all you praying spiritual, all you wise men, all on the payroll for so long with all your meek, interpret that for me. &gt;&gt; They say tell us a dream. Say I can't remember. Amen. &gt;&gt; They say if you tell us we he said no all spiritual &gt;&gt; I didn't say I didn't claim that &gt;&gt; only the message long time only inspiration only this and that all they see mysteries and thing &gt;&gt; when that butler recognized that men go and lose their head he remembered Joseph &gt;&gt; he said a man in the prison interpret dreams to me and it was correct &gt;&gt; send for Joseph Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a praise in the house. &gt;&gt; That man coming out of prison into power. &gt;&gt; Open the prisons. And here come brother Joseph coming out to interpret the dream for Pharaoh. Oh, give the Lord a shout. He said the dream is certain and the interpretation sure. Oh, give the Lord a shout. There is a God that they can interpret the dreams. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What I love about Joseph, he was so wise and instructed and in this the midst of things, he said, "Here, what to do? &gt;&gt; Get a man, &gt;&gt; a wise man &gt;&gt; that could handle what is to come. &gt;&gt; Set him over this thing &gt;&gt; as ruler to govern the penty part and the famine part." &gt;&gt; Pharaoh say, "You had a man." Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. on the tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. And when your time come, no devil could stop you. When your time come, nothing present, nothing past going to hold you back from coming into position that God raised you up for, that God ordained for you. Do I hear a shout in the house? &gt;&gt; Devil's a liar this morning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God is the one &gt;&gt; that uses time, &gt;&gt; uses delays, &gt;&gt; uses tribulation &gt;&gt; and all of that to bring us into leadership. &gt;&gt; Abraham had 25 years &gt;&gt; to believe God with a wife that didn't have a revelation, &gt;&gt; that did not hear from God. &gt;&gt; And he couldn't divorce her &gt;&gt; because God tell him through Sarah. You couldn't say I want a young thing. I want a young girl and what not. I want No, no, no. Sarah. &gt;&gt; So, you had to stick with that &gt;&gt; because God said through Sarah, &gt;&gt; I don't care how she behave. &gt;&gt; I don't care how she act. &gt;&gt; I insecure, insecure mom. Oh, God. Sarah, you know why? Oh, see, pray for me. Take your wife for God. She ain't cooking. She not Abraham. &gt;&gt; He was strong in faith, &gt;&gt; giving glory to God. And he was fully persuaded. Are you fully persuaded that what God promised, he promised to heal you. &gt;&gt; He promised to seal you. He promised to deliver you. What God promised, he is able to perform. No man could hold back your blessing. &gt;&gt; No man could take your blessing. Your blessing reserves. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. It like a seat mark reserve reserve for you. It have your name on it. Nobody can put their name on that seat. That is your place. That is your position. That is your portion. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The governor Yes, &gt;&gt; the manager out there is steward overseer over the property and the finances. &gt;&gt; That's the governor. &gt;&gt; So in other words, when the child is small, the child not ready yet, the governor will ensure his right investment place. The money is growing. &gt;&gt; You're not burying it in a hole. &gt;&gt; Things are covered. So the father leave 100,000 and by the time the child is air is 600,000 &gt;&gt; 700 because he have right trustees right governors &gt;&gt; not to manage the inheritance until the child is responsible &gt;&gt; and could account and take responsibility. &gt;&gt; So why would God give rascal's power &gt;&gt; when the throne is guarded? &gt;&gt; The guardians of the throne. A face of a man, a face of a lion, a face of a ox, a face of a eagle guard in God's presence. Oh give the Lord a shout. He said God have guardians that no scaly had good access. Oh give the Lord a shout of So your father have a farm, &gt;&gt; a big kingdom of business &gt;&gt; and you don't care. &gt;&gt; You ain't getting educated. &gt;&gt; Your father have a water business &gt;&gt; but you doing I don't know selling candles. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Or if I have a farm and you didn't know what a couple you didn't know what what name cutlas. You ever see a tree cocon? You have to look up and see, oh, is that that coming from &gt;&gt; the son who's interested in the father's business, know what the land is, know where the market is, know when you're planting, when you're reaping, when you're sewing. He understand the feel what's going on inside of there &gt;&gt; because the father himself looking for somebody to take over. &gt;&gt; The father here gray. &gt;&gt; He on his way out &gt;&gt; and he looking to see if anybody could take his place. Next one stock machine. &gt;&gt; He he gambling. He he father money. So he have the downward pull. He pulling taking father money and going them Chinese have some machine all over the place. Anytime you see a Chinese sign machine spin wrong. Remember going to the zoo one thing long time have them people under lucky over seven underlucky over seven po and they doing a cup under lucky thing so and you're losing like crazy say lucky cup there have a next one a ball day cup there and you looking so you think it's so and you put your money so think so &gt;&gt; and they have a assistant a man he's one of them you know and he putting money brave and he put the money where he know it is. &gt;&gt; So he seen you get money $10, he got $20. Woo! &gt;&gt; But that man working with that other man &gt;&gt; once he played he winning &gt;&gt; when you playing you losing &gt;&gt; on the lucky over seven unlucky thing you know. So the tutor &gt;&gt; dealt with the child's training, discipline and character &gt;&gt; education &gt;&gt; studies. &gt;&gt; The teacher doing that &gt;&gt; because the teacher want you to be successful. &gt;&gt; The teacher want you to take over. [Music] &gt;&gt; I know men who start businesses by inspiration, prosper, and when their sons take over, the whole thing crash. These sons never got equipped &gt;&gt; to handle the challenges of the business that their father start without education &gt;&gt; but fulfilled by inspiration &gt;&gt; because for business now you can't be a fool. &gt;&gt; You got to be hit on a feeling feeling the amount of companies I see crash. There was a one company um just tell my wife about this strange enough was um Blockbuster. &gt;&gt; Blockbuster used to have people borrowing videos time was VHS cassette and thing. They have uh buildings all over America. All over Blockbuster you had to go and return back the cassette and borrow and borrow and all over all over was Blockbuster. Next company called Netflix then put everything online. Blockbuster got busted. There was no more blockbuster on the bus on on the block. Every single one of them closed down. &gt;&gt; Gone completely out of existence. &gt;&gt; I can tell you over and over but different companies. And what what the phone one again? Blackberry. Long time we out a berry. Blackberry. You have no berry at all. That was the phone until the iPhone come. Blackberry just gone black out. Just get wipe out. Think about it. When God gives Saul the pink set that he was out of power, he stayed 15 years and not thrown him. &gt;&gt; But God not with him. &gt;&gt; God finished with him. &gt;&gt; God show I find a better man. &gt;&gt; I was hoping you to be that kind of man, but I found a better man. And I'm going to show you. God always looking. If the son don't want to be the air, he find somebody else. So if you don't want it, there's somebody going to take it. There's somebody going to give it. Get serious this morning about this thing. This is real. Give the Lord a shout in the house. The prodigal son brother, the older one who never went and gamble, who never went and flirt and everything else. When he heard the fat going on and the party going on and he come and say, "What going on there?" He said, "Kill the fatted C. Your brother come back, hurt his heart, break his spirit." He said, "Not going inside." All the time he's brother this and brother this, you know, you don't know what post he had in church. Sincere brother he going say he vex we vex so he rascal brother he have a pain now his brother come back there some people only see what in them when you see other people get back in &gt;&gt; I can tell you something scare you there's a sister who when her husband back sitting she on top of the mountain we &gt;&gt; she inspired that's how husband doing encouraging him when he got back on track and try to sell his home order. She will stay away from church, &gt;&gt; break him down until he come back right back out. I could tell you some stories here. &gt;&gt; I'm not making it up there. &gt;&gt; Ask my wife real stuff, you know. &gt;&gt; Time she say she had a dream. She dreamed me and she a brown man toilet and she want things. So when I had to straighten out and I start to talk to her, I said, "I'm the brown man. &gt;&gt; That's your dream." She said, "Not at all. Not at all. all the time she said you &gt;&gt; but when it come for correction &gt;&gt; instruction bringing guidance she rejected it &gt;&gt; she's no longer in this world so the air though the Bible call it lord of all is restricted by tutors and by governors until they reach maturity restricted. And this is what a lot of parents don't do. &gt;&gt; They don't bring their children under discipline or restrictions &gt;&gt; because they catering for their feelings. &gt;&gt; Whether you say amen or not, &gt;&gt; this word still coming through &gt;&gt; because remember they not just pastor over this is also a parent over it. &gt;&gt; And I know how I deal with my sons. Somebody let your children get away with too much of stuff &gt;&gt; because they're not ready yet. &gt;&gt; So they can't dictate if they're under your roof, they're under your roof. &gt;&gt; And if they're under your roof, they're supposed to behave a certain way. &gt;&gt; If they don't want to behave that way, get out from under my roof. That is all. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I am seen about the house. &gt;&gt; I am responsible for the house. I don't care what you're going through. What your friends telling you? What peer pressure and whatnot? Long time peer pressure was I putting pressure on my peers. &gt;&gt; I thought I was supposed to be &gt;&gt; no peer pressure. They putting pressure on me and &gt;&gt; we need leaders. &gt;&gt; We need true influencers, not what they have right now because they're trying to influence your children off the word, &gt;&gt; off the beaten path. Amen. &gt;&gt; We want you to take the courage and give them the confidence and the inspiration that God is with them, that God is for them, that God called them. &gt;&gt; Oh my time just running. &gt;&gt; All right. So therefore, the restriction on the inheritance, I want my money. I want it now. That that rascal entitled guy we call the political son, he got it. You know I think his father might have been reluctant but the father of him ready but the father give him he say father give me now no I don't want you wait to dead give me no &gt;&gt; I think I could manage and he couldn't &gt;&gt; you know what convince him pick food &gt;&gt; pig food &gt;&gt; living in the band behind the white house &gt;&gt; when people think he dropping off there and that house is his own is the back he rented big food. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But that guy somehow we came to himself. &gt;&gt; And I hope this message you come to yourself and stop this baby stuff as if he's supposed to baby you and wet you and encourage you and put man on you and spray you every morning and whatnot. Chip ch all kind of thing bugs and thing on you. That's not what God set up. You know, &gt;&gt; when God put something you you come bug resistance, you know, bug bite, but you take your bite and you move on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're Sophie and your father have a farm and you go on a farm and mosquitoes had to put some bites on you and some fleas and all have all kind of cow itch and all kind of things that you run back straight back out the far &gt;&gt; but the farmers will put you to school. The farmer will have your car the farmer was build your house but you're running from the fleas and the bite say in the forest mosquito biting him and all kind of thing affecting him just before he get a breakthrough just before all hell seem to send and whip up all kind of thing to hinder you. You have to bust through that. Give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To the tutors responsible for the upbringing, discipline, education, the child's character. Tutor come like the mentor. In England, they will talk they will talk about a nanny. That's the word that we use. So therefore the tutor will be restrict would be responsible for restricting the child's life that the child could sit in order and be disciplined to learn the courses and to learn the work and to get the education that they need to be that type of a child. &gt;&gt; So when the father come and ask the tutor how is my son doing &gt;&gt; how is my daughter doing &gt;&gt; the father could this tutor could give a good report. Amen. I work in schools &gt;&gt; and when exam time come I like to see that when the exam results come out some fellas is bad boy whole five years is bad boy &gt;&gt; final year now so that the final time of badness when they come to the office they trembling you know because they know the results is fs &gt;&gt; they have nothing to get &gt;&gt; you understand I'm saying then so what I'm saying then all their badness is for five years afterwards he had a bad outside &gt;&gt; no longer in school &gt;&gt; but I'm saying you have to consider &gt;&gt; rejecting short-term pleasure &gt;&gt; for long-term gain &gt;&gt; through discipline. &gt;&gt; There are many people going for short-term and this is what Esau end up doing. He come home, he hungry. He have the right to the birthright. He is the firstborn. He has a positional place and power. &gt;&gt; And his brother cook a good pot of lentils. &gt;&gt; He said hungry. He said birthright. &gt;&gt; Do you get that? &gt;&gt; He sold out his inheritance. But the country &gt;&gt; sold out his birthright &gt;&gt; for pleasure &gt;&gt; for a bowl of soup. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Lentil peas &gt;&gt; soup &gt;&gt; with pigtail in it. &gt;&gt; There's addition that we put inside that tast good &gt;&gt; when you smell that pigtail. He despised the birth right &gt;&gt; shortterm pleasure &gt;&gt; short-term boost &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know if I read it the Bible talk about when he started with tears &gt;&gt; he couldn't get it back &gt;&gt; there are certain decisions God don't want you to make certain paths God don't want you to go because there is no getting back &gt;&gt; that prodigal son got himself back. &gt;&gt; I will arise. I will say to my father, he got himself back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll read a scripture from Esther 2:7 says, "And he brought up Hadassa talking about Morai. &gt;&gt; Esther his uncle's daughter, for she had neither father nor mother. And the maid was fear and beautiful whom Modi when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter." So that's how we saw Esther as my daughter. &gt;&gt; Esther 2:20 says, "Esther had not yet shown her kindred nor her people as Mordei had charged her. &gt;&gt; For Esther did the commandment of Mori like as when she was brought up with him." &gt;&gt; So Esther was obeying instructions &gt;&gt; from her tutor Mori. &gt;&gt; Modi leave Esther after that and Esther get promoted to be king's wife. But when Hmon coming to kill the Jews and Morcai start to lament in front because listen a man get promoted, a man get big house, he have car, he have servants and all kind of thing but he can't handle Modai not bowing. &gt;&gt; That affecting his ego &gt;&gt; he have ministry, &gt;&gt; he had church, &gt;&gt; he have everything &gt;&gt; but boy not bowing by your God. Kill him. &gt;&gt; Kill his people. &gt;&gt; Morai sent a word to Esther. You think you safe inside of there &gt;&gt; because you the queen there will come for the people. And then Esther come to terms to herself. Let me fast and pray. &gt;&gt; Fast with me. I will go into the presence of the king &gt;&gt; without being called. &gt;&gt; And if I perish, &gt;&gt; that is courage. I perish. &gt;&gt; Do you have courage this morning &gt;&gt; to go be on you? Let me see if I can wrap up to go beyond yourself. Come on now. You have family you want to see delivered. Go be on yourself. Stop being so selfish. Come on, press your way. &gt;&gt; Go further. She said, "If I perish, I perish." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But she was dressed right. &gt;&gt; She was anointed right. She had the right motive and objective. And when the king saw her, he put out his scepter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is Esther power for you? &gt;&gt; Power to you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So before Joseph was promoted, he was imprisoned. &gt;&gt; David anointed &gt;&gt; and David still subject himself to the courts of Saul. &gt;&gt; Still play the harp and he know the anointing upon him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David &gt;&gt; humble heart, &gt;&gt; humble soul, &gt;&gt; knowing that throne is his &gt;&gt; the palace he's walking into that's is his &gt;&gt; but you know how tough it was to David to get there &gt;&gt; tutors &gt;&gt; to shape your character &gt;&gt; through correction discipline and Bible say all scripture is g by inspiration for God for correction &gt;&gt; isn't that right &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; so governance is to protect your inheritance to make sure you have what you're supposed to have. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Get what you're supposed to get. &gt;&gt; Protect it from you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because people could destroy themselves by accessing things. That's why all them lotto winners, you see what happen? They never earn it. They never achieve it. They buy a ticket standing in line. They stand in line to come in church &gt;&gt; standing for lotto play and whatever thing &gt;&gt; when they win it. So I remember I move over 11 until a man wash his car with I think was whiskey champagne. &gt;&gt; It had no water in the pipe. He buy a case of champagne and wash on his car. &gt;&gt; He thought the money was going done. When the money finished everybody laugh at him. &gt;&gt; Money is done. You know &gt;&gt; because they didn't earn it they waste it. &gt;&gt; So sometimes God program may look like it's restrictive. It look like things are holding you back and they holding me back. &gt;&gt; But God is protecting you &gt;&gt; from you. &gt;&gt; Could somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; God is protecting you from yourself. God is protecting you from self-destruction. &gt;&gt; Look at Samson. Look at Samson. Gifted man, &gt;&gt; anointed man, inspired man, working for God and killing and all kind of thing. &gt;&gt; But he lose. lost his eyes of foolishness. &gt;&gt; Lost his eyes &gt;&gt; because he after a woman. &gt;&gt; You give power prematurely and it destroys. I note a lot of these rich people they lose their children by suicide. &gt;&gt; Why the children have car, house, land, money, no problem. But the children are not going through discipline or process. &gt;&gt; So afterwards they do drugs because they don't know what to do with the money again. They have the shoes they could buy. They have the plane. They have this that that everything. They don't need anything really. &gt;&gt; Afterwards the devil bring the anointing upon them. Hey, you know what I mean? All find yourself in all kind of stupidness. Eventually we take the self out the world. &gt;&gt; We can't I think brother Isaac talked about it &gt;&gt; in the prayer meeting. &gt;&gt; Parents are not teaching their children for failure in the real world. &gt;&gt; They're setting them up &gt;&gt; as if it's supposed to work out this way or that way. &gt;&gt; We have to prepare them for failure, &gt;&gt; for challenges, &gt;&gt; for the real world. &gt;&gt; And we can protect them. That's a mother's only hovering hovering over like helicopter parents. &gt;&gt; Like drone over the children. &gt;&gt; Bible say shall this go shall a man leave his mother and father. Parenting is to bring the children to maturity that they could go on their own. &gt;&gt; And if you don't understand what I mean, see a chicken a mother hen. Chick just have your little chicken there. It's scratch. Feed them. Feed them. Feed them. Two, three days afterwards they decid to pick them. &gt;&gt; In other words, I show you what to pick up the food. &gt;&gt; Go and do go down and do likewise. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to go and go through with you all that. Go down and do likewise. &gt;&gt; I have all them chicks that morning owners grow on their own. &gt;&gt; We want a baby and baby. That's why God put the first man Adam there. Adam falling a perfect man. No bar, no risky, no rum, no mar nothing fall. God said not that happening again. You know start the process over now. &gt;&gt; Birth and growth, &gt;&gt; birth and process, &gt;&gt; seed process, &gt;&gt; fruit. &gt;&gt; If any man get fruit, I'm going to prune him. &gt;&gt; When you bear fruit, &gt;&gt; see the big shares coming. Hey, hey, hey. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now starting the beer. He come to prune you &gt;&gt; to bring forth more fruit. &gt;&gt; He want much fruit. So don't say God don't prune me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now this is part of the process &gt;&gt; on your way to your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Let's see if we can wrap up here. &gt;&gt; So Samson had power &gt;&gt; but he lacked discipline &gt;&gt; and character. He broke his covenant with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he squandered his gift. &gt;&gt; Saul, &gt;&gt; he lacked obedience &gt;&gt; and patience. &gt;&gt; And that is what brother Isaac brought out. And listen to the one read verse. This is from uh Hebrews 12. I'm going to wrap up. We shall come up please. Follow peace with all men and holiness. This is Hebrews 12:14. Without which no man shall see the Lord. looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God. Least any root of bitterness bringing up trouble you, thereby many be defiled. Least there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. For you know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected. &gt;&gt; For he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully &gt;&gt; with tears. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he despised his inheritance, his birthright for a temporary mean satisfaction, &gt;&gt; immaturity, &gt;&gt; immaturity want instant gratification, &gt;&gt; instant pleasure, &gt;&gt; maturity can wait &gt;&gt; because you know God will give you the best. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So when loss, shame and destructions come to those who get inheritance before maturity. Let me see wrap up here now. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; But I'm talking about all skip that. Skip that. Notice what if the boy was a good boy. how the teacher would show over his chest. Walk up to the father say, "I am so glad, sir, to bring you the message of how your son is progressing. He's as smart as he can be. He's just like you. We will call him a chip over the block. He's exactly like you. He loves the same thing you love. He does the works just like you have done." That's the kind of church that the Holy Ghost likes to witness before God. &gt;&gt; But if that child did not obey and was not obedient child, it never was no more than a son. It remained a son yet had no inheritance. But when this boy if he come up that way did not become obedient did not have the action of his father did not try to carry out his father's business on the way his father did another brother had to take its place &gt;&gt; so God is saying that son you he wayward what word and whatn not and end no net somebody else &gt;&gt; will take that place and today if we try to take the church before God under common church creed or theology not the way Jesus took the church before the father god wants the church to be filled with the holy ghost doing the same works he did when he was here on earth. That's the kind of church that the teacher want to present before God. Now, if that child didn't obey and was not about the father's business, God would raise him up another son. Now, he is saying that for a purpose. We repeat it for a purpose because here where he's going. I'm going to finish up here now. Watch. And that's the way he's done. He raised up Luther, raised up Methodist, raised up Nazarene, raised up the Pentecostal. He will keep on raising and raising and raising until he gets one. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God ain't stopping because people need bribery message. No, he want the perfect church and he's going to have it. &gt;&gt; God, brother, I hope to live to see that church when she rises in the power and the beauty of the resurrection. Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So now the father sure proud of that son. You know what? when he gets to school in his training yet he might he might not be able to exercise all authority he hasn't got it yet he is still a son but he hasn't been placed and then if the son proved to be the right kind of son the father put him in a high place clothe him beautiful garment he had what they call an adoption of a son or placing of a son positionally what he was they had a ceremony and when the father said this is my son I adopt him or place him positionally If they had checks in those days, the son name on the check would just be good as the father &gt;&gt; because he was placed. Now Jesus had proven to God he'd be right on a son. And then you know m transfiguration and then he said this here that's the same thing God will do to his sons here on earth someday. He will call you aside church if you only obey him and stay on the word and believe it. He will place here we go into the church before the coming of Christ before the coming. We can preach coming coming. But before that, we have to have this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before his coming, we have to have this. Here we go. Watch. He will place into the church. All the powers that Christ had in him will be in the church. All that God was, he poured into Jesus. All that Jesus was, he poured into the church. God wanted to work done, he sent into his son. The son wanted to work done, he sent into the church at that day. Because the same power was in Jehovah God rest in Jesus Christ. Here we go. And the same power that rest in Jesus Christ rest in placed sons in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; We have to see that before we leave here. &gt;&gt; We are going up yonder and we see that here. You have no yonder. You're saying right here yonder until we see this. &gt;&gt; This we have to say this is that &gt;&gt; that the prophet spoke of &gt;&gt; a power in the church. &gt;&gt; A power in you, &gt;&gt; a power in me, &gt;&gt; a power in us. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. If you count me to be a fan from this night on, that very same thing I'm speaking of will be done. &gt;&gt; There will be a power put into the church. And now it's coming in that the Holy Spirit, here we go, &gt;&gt; will so anoint the people till they will speak the word. &gt;&gt; And it will create itself right there. &gt;&gt; We haven't seen powers like that coming into the church now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, as we close, let's talk about Jesus a little bit. Jesus, age 12, we know about my father's business. 12 to 30, Jesus going to the temple. Jesus is listening to the word. He's under tutors. He's under the word. He's learning his calling and everything else. And then what happened? Filled with the Holy Ghost at the bank of the Jordan River. Led by the spirit to where? To show off for Instagram to get pictures to put himself on papers to say I am Jesus the Messiah? No. led by the spirit into the wilderness to face Lucifer one-on-one. &gt;&gt; Overcome the lust of the eyes, overcome the lust of the flesh, &gt;&gt; overcome the pride of life, &gt;&gt; get back to the temple and find the place where it is written, the spirit is now upon me &gt;&gt; because he had anointed me &gt;&gt; to bring good tidings. &gt;&gt; So Jesus is now anointed with God. &gt;&gt; He just overcome the devil. &gt;&gt; Devil can't stop him now. Now he know he now getting started. &gt;&gt; So God held back Jesus 18 years of silence. Give him a time when he must step forward. He couldn't go out prematurely. He went at the appointed time. John was so convinced. He said there is one standing among you. &gt;&gt; He going to baptize you with Holy Ghost and fire. &gt;&gt; That one coming. He's coming. He's coming. John know he had introduced. He said he is here. &gt;&gt; I don't know who it is yet, but he is here. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; And I say this morning, he is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother Bam, lots of time where many of us Pentecostals has made a mistake and think, well, the Holy Ghost is poured upon me. Glory to God. That's all I have to have. No, you're just getting started. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have gotten started. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I spoke so hard against modern trend. Women cutting their hair, men carrying on wearing moral clothes and things. I get so much criticism over that. But what is it? I'm trying to save that church. I'm trying to get them up here to the word. &gt;&gt; All right, I'm closing. &gt;&gt; Galatians 6:1 says, "Brethren, if a man be overtaken of fault, you which are spiritual, restore such a one, here we go, in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, least thou are also tempted. Bear ye one as burdens, so fulfill the law of Christ." If a man think himself to be something, when he's nothing, he deceive himself. But let every man prove his own work, then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, not in another. For every man shall bear his own burden. Let him that is taught in the word, that is you, communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. Be not deceived. God is not mocked. For whatsoever man, that shall he reap. For he that sweth his flesh shall reap of the flesh corruption. And he that sw to the spirit shall reap of the spirit everlasting life everlasting. &gt;&gt; Let us not be weary in welloing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We keep reading about Hebrews 13:7. Remember your leaders and superiors in authority for it is they who brought to you the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. observe attentively and consider their man of living the outcome of their well spent lives and imitate their fate. Hebrews 13:17 I'm closing just two more scriptures. Obey them that have rule over you &gt;&gt; and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls and they must give an account that they may do it with joy not with grief for that is unprofitable for you. In the amplified, this says, "Obey your spiritual leaders and submit to them, continually recognizing their authority over you, for they are constantly keeping watch over your souls, guarding your spiritual welfare as men who will have to render an account of their trust and so on." Last scripture, do we want to play something, brother, Steven? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:24, Paul said, "Solute all them that have rule over you and all the saints." the amplified. Give our greetings to all your spiritual leaders and to all the saints, God consecrated believers. May God bless you saints of God. The ears must be under teachers and governors. &gt;&gt; All these self-style believers who want to just do their own thing. I want to put that correctly for you. When a centrist is about to sew that dress, she has a pattern. &gt;&gt; The cloth is a material. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The pattern is what she's cutting from. &gt;&gt; She rest the pattern. &gt;&gt; I begin to cut. &gt;&gt; She's cutting that dress according to the pattern. &gt;&gt; What remains outside of the pattern is the remnant. &gt;&gt; You don't want to be that. &gt;&gt; You want to be the one that is being cut. &gt;&gt; Cut means you're cutting according to God's order, &gt;&gt; God's plan. If you choose to just be the cloth and you want to remain as piece of the remnant of that cloth, that's your choice. &gt;&gt; But you have a choice. The foolish virgins, they do their own thing. The foolish virgins are self-willed. They going by their own feelings and emotion. They know they needed oil. They choose not to get any extra. When the cry came, the bride would come and go to meet him. They asked the wise, give us some of your oil. The wise said not so. The wise was wise tell them not so. All these years you have chance to get oil. You come to harass me for oil. No, it's time to go. &gt;&gt; You can't get none of kindness. Wrong scripture. &gt;&gt; Don't quote that now. You have a problem. &gt;&gt; You had a chance to get the oil. You had a chance to pay the price. You had a choice time chance times to seek God. You did not. That's what I have been doing and now I'm ready to go. Bible said those who already went out to meet and let's all stand lead. I will go lead me Lord. Lead me Lord. [Music] Lead me Lord. I will go.

Heavenly Father, we thank you for your visitation this morning by your word. And God is such something that was moving upon our hearts for a while now under tutors and governors. And when I saw it, it was such a a a sight to see is not what people think it to be, is what you have ordained. And must come through churches and governance. best part of your program in getting us to where we want where you want us to be and getting us to the place that you want us to be because you said power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule and if you have to endure this with power it means that you have to have us in character and character is not a gift character is a victory. So that means we have to go through stuff, go through things that would hone us and shape us and mold us and that that we could reflect you and that you could trust us with your presence and power. So as your people go to their homes, may they meditate and think on these things. I ask in Jesus name I commit their lives into their hands the entire church from the eldership straight down. Oh God to each one be with them in a special way. Bless the upcoming Wednesday service. Bless the Friday Zoom meeting. Bless the three-day prayer and fast Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and bless the special services coming Sunday. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord.
