younger brother this eulogy was prepared by myself and his polar brother joel who resides in england it is so unfortunate that his relatives from england can be present namely on kukuti aunty linda aunty becky and his brother joel due to the challenges and restrictions of this pandemic in this time of grief by all extension to other family members and friends jason was born on september 27 1980 at portland spring general hospital he was born to the parents of sandra disease and doug nader his given name was jason subash andrew jason spent infancy and part of his early childhood years at number 24 lower symbols hill belmont porter spin together with his mother ella brother joelle grandparents monica and carlton dillion bodhisees aunties angela rebecca uncles kurtie and gerald during this time jason's early spiritual journey began where he and joel would accompany their grandmother mother and aunties to fellowship at berlintown street located on frederick street border spin i too would accompany them sometime thereafter on some mornings is uncle cootie often would stroll along patreon strips to drop off jason and joel for school jason was always a spritey lad and light on his feet always trying to skip over the flight of four stairs as he walked but couldn't one morning whilst walking along the set steps a neighbor's dog began barking at jason he got scared and quickly ran off jumping over the flight of four steps and there is somersault in the process landing on his feet he looked at uncle coty and started laughing as uncle kurti relates at nine years old jason did that example 91 to talk to me in roshani gandhi with his parents and other siblings his spiritual journey continued as our family began to fellowship with brother o'bid at cinema sani grande jason finished his primary schooling at sunny granny hindu school [Music] and passed for arima government secondary school as brothers we always look forward for weekends and all school vacations to visit our family in belmont because of the bond and love we shared we often pick oranges lemons grapefruit and portugal's with our dad from his estate and carried it to belmond jason and i would walk around with two market bags containing citrus selling to our friends and neighbors this was all jason's idea and we supported him eventually we had a little stall on a belmont circular road full of citrus fruits and it was very successful one of the favorite sports in belmont at the time was football the three young boys and other children our age we were the bald boys watching our uncles play football on the hill waiting for the ball to come our way we also enjoy playing cricket panhoop and even driving scooters down the hill with our auntie becky and uncle kirti i clearly remember one day rain began falling on the hills and jesus and i started playing in the rain jason sat down in a canal and the water pushed him straight down the hill i tried it after we did it a few times when jason turner wrong his short pants were top was torn apart exposing his cheeks mother dealt with us accordingly jason loved sports at an early age as we could often as we would often go with uncle cody to the queen's back savannah to play football with our cousins and friends jason also acquired his healthy appetite as he enjoyed besides mummy cooking his grandmother and auntie angela roti and good or his grandfather barbecue at our regular family gatherings jason graduated from arima government secondary school with a full certificate i remember at times when we had our choice to do at home jason always would be studying so mummy wouldn't ask him to do any chores he was always a studious person at a young age after secondary school jason began working at family's supermarket now for extra foods he was never a person to stay home and sit back whilst in his late 13 years he went to roy tech and continued to work at the supermarket jason began working in the ministry of oaks as a clerk in stanley granby he still maintained his passion for sports especially football as his favorite footballer was roberto boujou badgio sorry at age 23 jason began his career in the public service and worked at nine district courts throughout trinidad and tobago as well jason continued to work part-time at extra foods supermarket jason continued to strive and succeed in all aspects in his life he was the wife the live wire in our family gathering with a great sense of humor making funny faces and the energy that he brought as brothers growing up as brothers growing up we had our struggles and hardships faced many challenges emotionally psychologically and financially throughout the years this only made us stronger as we grew with the love and support from our family and the ever-fighting spirit and love from our mum kept our boys intact there is no question about the fact that the love and bond we shared as a family was instrumental in carving all the character of jason for who he was jason started traveling in his mid-20s visiting several caribbean islands united states and uk united states of america uk and canada json trip to canada was based on a promise and soon endured several hardships when auntie angela found out about this she engaged other close friends and family living abroad and they reach out extending the same gratitude as if was her as jason journey throughout his life continued approaching his thirties we both shared a passion for performance vehicle he bought his subaru forester and i anal teaser he would often tell me stories of his races on the highway and one what stood out the most was recent bikes on the solomon ho choi highway he said son them bikes does have to slow down you know rain reaching kyroni fly over because it have a big drop but not me my cars does go air my car does go airborne and land back good and i gone he would laugh telling me these stories i remembered driving his car a time while sitting in front he was sitting in front passenger seat in the vicinity of trinity westbound lane a mitsubishi evolution six passes speeding we look at each other and he smiled and said take him i didn't hesitate and kicked on and we both flew back on our seats jason was offered a role of santa claus at extra food supermarkets which he continued to play for several years he would start about 10 days before christmas distributing toys to all locations jason would come home at nights with large garbage bags of toys which took up the entire living room and dining room area and i would sometimes help sort them out he would try and hide from his nieces and nephew but one night his eldest niece woke up and saw him packing toys she was amazed and surprised his response was i am santa's helpers i am santa's helper as he looked on with his smile his love for children was unquestionable as for to his nieces and nephew as he played an active role in their lives he will always minister to them about god the importance of going to church and praying jason was now promoted several times at his job as it had will continue to pay it off in his mid-20s he met crystal and fell deeply in love they got married and shortly after crystal was pregnant i'm sorry got pregnant they had a baby boy named j chris after which short tragedies dropped and only a month after his son had passed away this drove jason into deep grief and sorrow as he always wanted his son a year after tragedy struck again our mother passed away after battling cancer still struggling open and grieving from the first tragedy jesus yet had another on his plate jason faith and desire the surfboard grew stronger as he interceded for his family as time went by jason and his wife traveled to europe the usa and some of the caribbean islands shortly after crystal got pregnant and in 2020 gave birth to jesus son mission his level of happiness rose to a static when he got his son misha aka shaki was his pride and joy [Music] on some saturdays jesus would bring shaki over for his nieces and nephew to play when crystal was when was at work jason said he always wanted him to grow up with them a few weeks before his unfortunate passing jason told us that shaq he wasn't on well the he was unwell and in abundance of portion he will not come over he still pass and stop on the roadway for a short period to say hello when i learned about jason contracting kovid i visited him visited him home to drop off medication and some supplies tuesday december december was the last day i saw my brother the center of his eyes was jet black with no sense of direction or focus the stair was hollow inside he looked in my direction [Music] and didn't blink as he sat in a chair as if he was in a gaze this look reminded me of the night i last saw my mother alive tears came to my eyes as i doubted myself i urge you all let us not be reckless and true caution to the wind our brother the husband a nervous son a father lies a victim of proven we all [Music]

last few months spent with my brother i saw in him an even deeper desire to get closer with gordon he became in different things which previously he held onto it was as if he wanted nothing to hold

dad pleasure jason was my best friend when i started off in life on my journey you could have never i could have never had a friend such as jason rajkumar we started in family supermarket pushing old trolleys and he was like my big brother we you know we had a journey where we would have would have taken care of all the customers customers used to look fast sometimes one line needs to market to be way down to the back and the manager go to the the manager go to the customer and ask the customer why are you lining up in this line and customers say well jason rajkumar and danielson is here packing and we want jason and austin to take their groceries because we had fun serving people jason had a lot of love in his heart for people and he go all the extra miles so on our journey he would have branched off in into doing different things and i would have seen him one at one time we taken his mother's car to drive and go all over the other time we we were doing all sorts of things together but he always had my back and i always had his back we we had a journey where we were boys at one time and the general wanted me to script after us we became men we didn't know when that happened but we became men my first date jesus was the it was not out of my back and the same thing for him as well there were three times in jason's life where he was extremely happy the first time was when he met crystal and he told me he was getting married and he went to wrap things up with crystal and he was real happy with crystal the second time is when he married crystal the third time was when he had his first baby only time after that was when mishap was born in a true jason life all he wanted was to be happy and to be a father and to really add back to society jason was a giver jason used to become the santa claus at extra foods and i had one time where we would have um someone would have come to us and told us that they don't have a santa claus and they have a children's home that they want to um they want to give a few toys to and they asked if you could have used the actual food santa claus and i said well no problem you go wrong at that time i had a crv and i had like a sunroof and jason with us going to the sunroof pop his head out and say ho ho ho merry christmas merry christmas to all the boys angels and sometimes all each other and run along the van because a lot of toys is santa claus but in that home it had one little girl who didn't believe in santa claus for whatever case but that year jason would have practiced magic magic tricks and that year that little child who didn't believe in santa claus and didn't really wasn't coming towards santa claus because she was afraid oh she didn't believe in santa claus jason did a trick and pull out coins out the nose or something like that and then she said no no no that's really santa claus it's really santa claus and she was so amazed she was so amazed at all the time she was afraid to hug him up and all of that i don't believe i have a pet yeah i'll post it a bit later on facebook where that child hugged jesus hug jason as if jason was her father you know he had a heart of gold he would have done anything for anyone and it didn't have to be a millionaire for jason to do anything for you he was a man on the ground and just as jason was a man on the ground we must remember to always keep our feet on the ground and to serve each other and to love each other and take care of each other because this covered 19 virus have shown us that although we need to be a part we still need to hold on to one another and encourage each other life is short but in times ideas we need to come together and spread the love of christ and spread the christ like love that jason would have had to all of us and we cannot let his light burn out today because our journey have not yet attended our journey is still written based on what god wants and for everybody inside there right now what jason would want today is that we keep his legacy going we keep what we have started going i don't allow it to end you have me shot there and we need to look after me shot as well too i already told crystal that mishak is my son too he cannot be a best friend and and having his son here and i i can't visit his son check and make sure he's okay friends family members all of us have a responsibility all of us need to come together and make things happen and spread christ like love throughout you ladies and gentlemen and have a wonderful evening that was really beautiful we appreciate that so much can you get another handclap for that for those words thank you so much we appreciate that and i definitely believe it is a true reflection of jason rajkumar here and his life that he has shared with us and we are so honored and privileged to celebrate and be a part of this afternoon amen now this time we just have a tributary song i believe or oh sorry i believe if okay sure um as he would come we just want the father of the deceased to say a few words on behalf of his of his son right here with this fellow mourners i will say i take this opportunity because the opportunity to come so regularly in our family to say a few words on behalf of my son i am his father dr rajkumar and my wife was sandra rashkumar a staunch believer who are fanatic to the institute and the kid of god i have a teacher and we have two children together normally am i here i usually team lion but i should call my wife brian and she had three children and those future and i call them cubs joel jason and sunil

verse 18 to 22 just a few verses and you'll have your seats and this was joel being tested uh the devil god asked the devil about job there's none like him on the earth and god uh the devil god challenged the devil that job would not bow and break by his soul's condition and he was allowed to give job such a great trial and test but job stood but listen to this here in verse 18 while he was speaking this is sad news after sad news there came another and said thy sons and i daughters were eating and drinking wine in the eldest brother's house and behold there came a great win from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house it fell upon the young men and they are dead and i am escaped the only one escape alone to tell thee then job arose rent his mantle shave his head fell down upon the ground and worshipped and said naked came i out of my mother's womb naked shall i return thither the lord give the lord are taken away blessed be the name of the lord in all this job sin not nor charge god foolishly let's bow heads heavenly father we thank you for your presence and the greatness of your grace towards us father we pray in a special way that you minister to crystal father may your mind drop down upon her father that she will know that truly all things will work together for good to them that love you father be with your people here now those that are connected to us those that would listen and learn listen and receive father have your way i pray in jesus name i ask it amen you may be seated there are certain things in life we can't explain you can't explain when things happen when you wasn't expecting that it just happened things just happen sometimes but job was amazing and it reminded me something jason ann said in the zoo meeting we had and a tribute to him she talked about when the baby was being buried and it was covered up that jason fell face down on the ground and bowled hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he didn't say why he didn't say how he didn't question god he just bald hallelujah and i know that all is well with jason and with his son by god's grace now naked came into this world and where you are going you can't take anything of this world with you and many times and you know funerals are so important it reminds us not just our humanity and our frailty and the fact that we are here for a specific period of time and we have boundaries that we cannot cross but we cannot take anything in this world with you and today if i want to put a title to what i'm going to share with you for a few moments i won't be long i'm going to call it between the regions of the lost and the regions of the blessed this is where we are at here right now on earth between the regions of the lost and the regions of the bliss we know where jason gone too he's gone to the regions of the blessed but just as sure as there's the regions of the blessed there's also the regions of the lost the currency here of wealth fame health and fortune don't work over there when you go overseas you can't use your own currency you have got to get your money converted or changed you cannot take your tt dollars and go into the u.s and say you're gonna buy this and buy that it just won't work it has to be converted if it is not converted it has no value and jesus the first sermon he preached he said i say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he's old can he enter his second time in his mother's womb and be born and jesus said i say unto thee except a man be born and he defined it of the water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of flesh is flesh that was born of the spirit is spirit marvelous but i said unto thee you must be born again now genesis 1 when god made man it was a spirit man that man couldn't tell the soil genesis 2 god take dust and form the man that's in that box right there because what jason was living in was a house so that flesh man that had five senses to contact this world is what god put a spirit man inside of that flesh man and man become a living soul so the jason that you know physical he was just beyond physical in other words the only reason cats and dogs and monkeys and and whoever is not inside of a church is because they don't have a soul but you have a soul and the fact we are here today is because of one thing because of sin it wasn't a bad it wasn't outside woman outside man is what adam and eve and a word from god the day you eat thereof that day you die that was the word from god people have i call it the god of their own imagination they have a thinking of what god is but the god that i know is a god that keeps his word it was a man and his wife you tell them the day you eat thereof is nothing that a nice child you know that day you die they eat of that tree and that's why we have a funeral today if adam didn't do it we was gonna have a funeral today because adam did it but christ came and paid the price that we could be restored back and that is what this whole gospel is about born again not catch phrases god is a good god all the time that's a nice phrase but it's not to go to the bible god of the bible keeps his word born again not saying catch phrases but to be changed to be transformed just as it changed tt dollars to u.s to be effective and they go to the states you to be effective going across there have to be changed and they call a conversion two parts word and spirit isn't that right and the bible talk about being born again of the not of the corruptable seed but of the incorruptible by the word of god and delivered to ever so the conversion must take place on this side to be recognized on the other side right now we are in a holding room this it a holding place a waiting room to see at the end of your thoughts words decisions and actions at the end of it you will either go in the regions of the bliss or the regions of the loss jesus said luke 13 strive to enter into the straight gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able when once the master of the house is risen up and had shut the door and you begin to stand without and to knock on the door saying lord lord open unto us he shall answer and say unto you i know you not whence you are then you shall say we have eaten and drunk in your presence and thou has taught in our streets he shall say i tell you i know you not whence you are depart from me all the workers have iniquity you know remind me the story the bible story about the wedding and it happened i travel and in africa i saw it i couldn't believe it but in those days you were given the garment to enter the wedding so everybody looked the same and i was there african wedding and everybody had the same color material and it looked as if they will give to the guests what kind of material to buy so everybody look the same way so you can't go on i say crush the wedding as such and the bible gave a description because the eastern book and the man everybody had the same garment and one man was dressed differently and the man come and say friend how did you get in here because once i come to the door you will give him a garment so you know who rich who poor who have who don't have everybody wear the same garment and that man didn't have the garment he said buy name foot he called him friend and there shall be weeping and wailing a nation of god and nation of teeth so i want to say today during the home stretch of what we want to say this is not a game the reality of debt is because of sin or unbelief or disbelief of god's truth because you have to disbelieve god's truth before you can accept the devil's lie let me say that again you have to disbelieve god's truth before you accept the devil's line god is a good god all the time we talk about that it's like whistling in the cemetery tonight and saying you're not frightened you are frightened that's why you're whistling go to adam the day you eat that day you die god kept this word and adam died and god get out of the boots and kick him out of the garden put angels to god away back to the tree of life this is the god of the bible oh my here you are on earth between the regions of the lost and the regions of the blessed oh my if a man die shall he live again is a question and jesus brought back the answer he brought back the evidence by him not just being raised from the dead but to release his own spirit upon the lives of individuals and charms transform lives from sinner to a saint i am not talking about going to church i am talking about your life being changed not you stop doing this and stop doing that you know something happened on the inside take out the lust for this and the desires for that and something is just happening inside and your life is changed the holy spirit comes back upon the believer and the effect of it produces a changed life so you're not like you're trying something i said drinking or stop drinking no i'm not talking about that that's you stopping that you stopping smoking now you stopping limit i'm not about what you could do i'm talking about when god does something in your heart and in your life like his dad said something about his wife so powerful he admire the way she raised her children unto the lord is it something that he could see with his eyes he is not talking on truth he is talking the truth is something he witnessed it's something he saw is something that happened and this is what has to happen to us a change oh my a changed life is evidence there's another world you hear on the tape jason hallelujah that is from another world because amidst trials amidst dark hours he could say hallelujah it's a evidence that that shout that hallelujah is some around the world we don't belong here we are only journeying through here you can't take your money with you your car with you your land with you your house with you your car even take your family with you but we are journeying through here oh my our lives watch jesus himself said my kingdom is not of this world he said there's another kingdom there's another place jesus said i go to prepare a place for you and you are here what you are somewhere else our lives now are reflects where we are going let me say that again good our lives now reflects where we are going don't roll the dice jason wasn't gambling he was unashamedly a worshiper unashamedly loved the lord or my shame he will tell you about jesus he was just like that it was real to him and that is why he could express it from his heart he wasn't talking from his head and trying to be pretentious or he wasn't hypocritical he was genuine he was authentic he was original that's why he's just a unique kind of person and god made him thus oh hallelujah so this watch this our lives are reflects on where we are going the evidence of a transformed life is the witness that we have of a place on the other side this is what the resurrection is about this is what christianity is about this is what jesus being raised from the dead is about it's not about going to church but a transformed resurrected life by the spirit of god coming upon the human heart oh my if a cat had a soul a dog or a soul that would be in church here in the word of god but man have a soul a conscience and a subconscious you don't even need the bible to be judged you just need your own conscience god could take out your own conscience when you lie when you steal when you do something adultery or whatever it is you know in your heart you're wrong all god has to do is take it out and put it in this whole camera and his old theater and play back your own conscience to you and your own conscience will condemn you your own conscience will condemn you and that is why you need to repent and let the blood of jesus come and cleanse your past and cleanse your sin oh my hallelujah you not only is flesh and blood you have a body you have a spirit you have a soul your body contacts the earth here oh my and sometimes in your spirit you want this and when you get this you'll be happy when they get a husband they'll be happy when they get a wife you'll be happy when they get a child and as you get things and you start to get happy the the goal keep moving the posts keep moving because the devil keeps shifting things around thinking but you see happiness have to come on the inside if not the thing is going to get you happy is that what you possess should get you happy is what you have on the inside is what's going to get you happy oh my i'm going to close that don't change you it's only changed where you go where you live whatever you are here when you cross over you'll be just that scenery if you're a liar here it will be a line across there if you're born here we bang across here you have to change here this is the place you have to change not church i'm not talking about church i'm talking about change oh hallelujah here's what people don't get when you die your human spirit breaks up that human spirit is where you feel short of your money where you might be a ceo where you have your degree where you have your doctorate where people look up to you that all that is in the human spirit and when you die it breaks up and your soul comes up and whatever your soul is that is what stands and i'll give you an example there's a woman she taught she was saved she was going to church she thought she was fine she was thought she on her way to him and she was dying and as a spirit begin to break up she started well i'm lost i am lost you see after a while all this i am this and i have so much and all what the things you have begin to break and fade away just recently somebody died in this church and he was telling me and i know he loved electronics he loved disney love a lot of stuff he said bertillo he said all the desire for these things has gone he was leaving and as he was leaving the desires it just i know him i know him for years over 30 40 years and it just left him because you know why he was preparing to leave here who thinks about that when i had my child i didn't understand that that child already replaced me i didn't get that it was my little child i'm rocking there but actually my little baby was a replacement it just took 30 40 years to show up that no one's have no babies no more have big men who have their own children no my gran i'm a grandfather no but that is life you see it doesn't stop it goes on so people are deceived in the human spirit this is where you have all these i am this and i am that and you're proud and whatnot but that breaks up and your soul comes up and if your soul is not right it is condemned because your soul not your conscious your subconscious is the real you hallelujah that woman when it hit her nobody has to tell you no she knew she was lost it was too late then they gave us some kind of inoculation and she get conquered she died she was lost there's some place called the regions of the lost and there's another place called the regions of the blessed and you are in between i'm gonna close revelation 19 says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife had made himself ready he said unto me he said blessed are thee which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb he said unto me these are the two sayings of god i'm going to wrap up here now luke chapter 16 there was a certain rich man which had clawed in purple and fine linen feared sumptuously every day and there was a certain beggar named lazarus which had laid at the gate full of sores and desiring to be fed and the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licked his swords it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into ibrahim's bosom what is that the regions of the blessed all right and the rich man died and was buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torment and see it abraham are far off and last rush in his bosom where is he in the regions of the lost and he cried saying father abraham have mercy on me send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue if i'm tormented by the flames so this is another dimension now on earth rich american style here dropping nobody crumbs the beggar but but this change now both of them is dead one in the region of the blessed the other in the region of the lost he said no watch he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of a thing in water and cool my tongue if i'm tormented in this flame and abraham said son remember that though when thy life thing received thy good things and likewise lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and dawah tormented and besides all this between us and you there's a great gulf fixed so that they would not pass hence so that you cannot neither can they pass to us so they can't cross there's a gulf between us right that they would come dance then he said i pray thee now listen to this request imagine a man in hell he's the reasons of the loss he have a concern for his family here his request he says he said i pray to their forefather that dog would have sent him to my father's house for i have five brethren that he may testify unto them least they also committed this place of torment ibrahim said unto him they have moses and the prophets let them hear them he said near father abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they would repent he said unto him if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded even though one rose from the dead so you are here where you are somewhere else that don't change you it just changes where you go to god will not be mocked this virus that kills is not to be mocked it's a sign of judgment to the entire world here you are on earth between the regions of the blessed and the reason of the loss you know i realize people don't talk about the lost and hell and damnation they tell public too blessed to be stressed and god is a good god you can work out everything fine and on them nice talk thing but the truth is there's a regions of the blessed and there's the reasons of the loss what are you holding on to in this word your subjects your job your money what are you holding on to why don't you give your life to jesus christ amen let's borrow heads heavenly father i thank you lord this few words on what you give
