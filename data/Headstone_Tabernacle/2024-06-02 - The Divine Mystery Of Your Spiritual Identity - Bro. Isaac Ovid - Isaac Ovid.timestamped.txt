[1:09:31] things for us than we could ever speak
[1:09:34] for ourselves Lord we are unworthy to
[1:09:37] stand here in your presence but Lord
[1:09:40] your blood made our way possible Your
[1:09:43] Grace made it possible your mercy has
[1:09:46] made it possible we stand naked in your
[1:09:50] presence Lord as Isaiah stood as a
[1:09:53] prophet he thought he was okay until he
[1:09:56] came into presence Lord and in lord your
[1:10:00] presence he said wo is me he saw
[1:10:03] something he didn't see before because
[1:10:05] Lord your presence makes everything
[1:10:06] plain Lord your presence uncovers
[1:10:09] everything Lord and we are so grateful
[1:10:11] this morning that we could be in your
[1:10:13] house and be in your presence that you
[1:10:15] could speak to us that we could look
[1:10:16] into the mirror of the word Lord and see
[1:10:19] the word being in formed the word image
[1:10:21] being in formed that shaped as your
[1:10:23] servant brother Anthony spoke last week
[1:10:25] Wednesday Lord father we are here this
[1:10:27] morning looking for more shaping some
[1:10:29] more molding some more cutting some more
[1:10:31] changing Lord until what we see
[1:10:33] reflected is a stature of a perfect man
[1:10:37] Lord may you bless us as we go into your
[1:10:39] word this morning may you walk out of
[1:10:42] the pages of the Bible may you break
[1:10:44] chains and shackles Lord may you restore
[1:10:46] and bring comfort and peace Father may
[1:10:49] you take me out of the way completely
[1:10:51] and speak directly to your needy
[1:10:53] children father we commit the service
[1:10:54] into your hands and the reading of the
[1:10:56] word into your hands in the precious
[1:10:58] name of Jesus Christ and the church says
[1:11:01] amen and amen I greet you this morning
[1:11:03] in the precious name of Jesus Christ you
[1:11:05] appreciate the song service this morning
[1:11:07] weing the
[1:11:09] musicians amen so if you have your
[1:11:12] Bibles would you turn with me to two
[1:11:14] portions of scripture reading from The
[1:11:16] Book of Genesis and reading from the
[1:11:18] book of
[1:11:22] Jeremiah Genesis 1
[1:11:25] and Jeremiah
[1:11:40] 1 reading Genesis 1 and reading verse
[1:11:46] 26 and God said let us make man in our
[1:11:50] image after our likeness and let them
[1:11:53] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:11:56] and over the fowl of the air and over
[1:11:58] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[1:12:00] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[1:12:03] upon the Earth so God made so God
[1:12:05] created man in his own image in the
[1:12:08] image of God created him male and female
[1:12:11] created he them reading Jeremiah 1
[1:12:14] reading from verse 4 brother
[1:12:17] Gideon reading Jeremiah 1 verse4 then
[1:12:20] the word of the Lord came unto me saying
[1:12:22] before I form thee in the belly I knew
[1:12:27] thee and before thou camest out of the
[1:12:30] womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained
[1:12:33] thee a prophet unto the nations may the
[1:12:35] Lord add a blessing to the reading of
[1:12:37] his
[1:12:42] word amen you may be seated in the
[1:12:44] presence of the Lord are you happy to be
[1:12:45] in the house of the Lord this morning
[1:12:48] amen what a time to be in the presence
[1:12:52] of the Lord we see the world falling
[1:12:54] apart
[1:12:56] we see the economic system failing the
[1:12:58] political system failing the health
[1:13:01] system failing the scientific system is
[1:13:04] failing and you know over the last few
[1:13:07] Services brother ID has uh spoken about
[1:13:10] the all the artificial intelligence and
[1:13:12] these things and I saw an article this
[1:13:15] week that there are some scientists who
[1:13:17] are a bit concerned because uh the they
[1:13:20] have now realized that artificial
[1:13:22] intelligence can now confuse humans and
[1:13:25] trick humans and they seem to be
[1:13:27] starting to have somewhat of a mind of
[1:13:29] its own so it's quite an interesting
[1:13:31] time that we are living in and I was
[1:13:33] sharing with my wife how the same way we
[1:13:35] have gotten used to living with the
[1:13:37] refrigerator and these technology that
[1:13:40] artificial intelligence and these things
[1:13:42] are becoming more of a way of life and
[1:13:45] within this context of the
[1:13:47] normalization of technology and these
[1:13:49] things all the way back to Genesis when
[1:13:52] they try to build a tower to reach to
[1:13:55] the heavens man is building to his own
[1:13:58] destruction he's building to his own
[1:14:00] demise it will seem convenient but
[1:14:02] within that convenience has its own
[1:14:04] challenges and we see as brother
[1:14:06] brandham typed out when there was the
[1:14:08] horse and buggy age and the car age and
[1:14:11] the and the the aerplane age and now
[1:14:13] we're in the astronaut age he said that
[1:14:15] the church is moving too
[1:14:17] slowly you know and we see the unfolding
[1:14:19] of the natural and we know that the
[1:14:20] natural types spiritual so there's a lot
[1:14:22] that's happening now and more than ever
[1:14:25] we live in a world of of
[1:14:27] Crisis you know there's economic crisis
[1:14:30] there's Health crisis there's financial
[1:14:32] crisis there's there's military crisis
[1:14:35] you know we are somewhat
[1:14:37] sheltered from some types of Crisis here
[1:14:40] on this small island but if you live in
[1:14:42] the Middle East or certain other
[1:14:43] countries where you wake up in the night
[1:14:45] because there's a bomb exploding around
[1:14:47] the corner it's a different kind of life
[1:14:50] that you liveing but to every single
[1:14:52] person on the earth they have their own
[1:14:53] form of a crisis to come or a form of
[1:14:57] Crisis to deal with family crisis
[1:14:59] marital Crisis crisis with the school
[1:15:02] the education system a crisis on your
[1:15:04] job and that's the nature of life it's
[1:15:06] mountains and valleys and through it all
[1:15:09] we have to learn to trust in the Lord
[1:15:11] and knowing that God is in control of
[1:15:12] all these things so we thank the Lord
[1:15:14] for his grace because I believe that now
[1:15:16] more than ever we have to rely on the
[1:15:19] who we are in God not rely on our
[1:15:23] thinking our imagination our reason ing
[1:15:25] our own understanding of things but it
[1:15:28] is more important than ever before to be
[1:15:30] grounded in who we are in the Lord
[1:15:32] because our comfort comes from who we
[1:15:34] are our faith comes from who we are our
[1:15:36] identity comes from who we are so may
[1:15:39] the Lord richly bless you to uh this
[1:15:41] morning how many appreciate by Anthony's
[1:15:43] message last Wednesday what a
[1:15:46] tremendous message from the Lord I was
[1:15:49] not brother Anthony speaking that was
[1:15:50] the Lord speaking to his bride and I'm
[1:15:53] under great expectation for God to do
[1:15:54] something special for us this morning so
[1:15:56] thank you so much for being here this
[1:15:58] morning both those who are here live and
[1:16:00] those who are connected online so for a
[1:16:02] title this morning the Divine mystery of
[1:16:07] your spiritual
[1:16:08] identity the Divine mystery of your
[1:16:12] spiritual identity can the church say
[1:16:15] Amen you know you're a mystery
[1:16:18] right Hallelujah sometime you're a
[1:16:20] mystery even to yourself but on the very
[1:16:23] simplest levels brother Nathaniel you're
[1:16:25] a mystery to the world you're a mystery
[1:16:27] to your family you're mystery to your
[1:16:29] company and you're sometime you're a
[1:16:30] mystery to yourself you're not a mystery
[1:16:32] to God because God is the one who
[1:16:34] created the mystery but you are a
[1:16:36] mystery not just any kind of a mystery
[1:16:38] you are a Divine mystery there's the
[1:16:40] mystery of the stars and the Mystery of
[1:16:42] the earth and the Mystery of gravity and
[1:16:44] all these things that is they discovered
[1:16:45] over time these were natural Mysteries
[1:16:48] Hallelujah but there there's also a
[1:16:49] Divine mystery Divine as in desided by
[1:16:53] God thought of by God planned by God
[1:16:56] unfolded by God and there's nothing that
[1:16:59] you could do about it there's nothing
[1:17:00] that the devil could do about it there's
[1:17:02] nothing your family could do about it
[1:17:04] there's nothing your past could do about
[1:17:05] it it is part of a Divine mystery a
[1:17:09] Divine story is unfolding Hallelujah
[1:17:12] he's the author and he's the finisher
[1:17:14] and the story of your life has already
[1:17:16] been written you are walking through the
[1:17:19] pages of a story that has already been
[1:17:21] written the conclusion of your story has
[1:17:24] already been written the final chapter
[1:17:26] of your story has already been written
[1:17:29] your story ends with shaking David's
[1:17:31] hand and your story ends with shaking
[1:17:33] Joshua's hand and your story ends with
[1:17:36] you dancing and shouting the end of your
[1:17:38] story doesn't have gray hair in your
[1:17:41] head the end of your story doesn't have
[1:17:43] any sickness in your body the end of
[1:17:45] your story doesn't have your high blood
[1:17:47] pressure higher than it should be in
[1:17:49] fact you won't even be dealing with high
[1:17:50] blood pressure or low blood pressure the
[1:17:52] end of your story doesn't have a natural
[1:17:55] pest House of a body the end of your
[1:17:57] story is a Eternal being that rotated
[1:18:00] off of the presence of God the end of
[1:18:02] your sto oh you don't hear me this
[1:18:05] morning and even that statement but the
[1:18:07] thumbs about the end of your story is
[1:18:09] itself a mystery because you have no
[1:18:11] ending it's the natural story I'm
[1:18:13] talking about but you come from God and
[1:18:15] you're going back to God you are an
[1:18:17] eternal being trapped in time Hallelujah
[1:18:21] and one day time has to let you go time
[1:18:24] has to free you from this prison of time
[1:18:27] to get back into eternity only in time
[1:18:30] is sickness only in time is depression
[1:18:32] only in time is the bills and all these
[1:18:34] things but you are really an eternal
[1:18:36] being you are bigger than time you are
[1:18:39] more powerful than your circumstance you
[1:18:41] are bigger than your situation in your
[1:18:44] story there's no depression there's no
[1:18:46] frustration that's a product of time but
[1:18:49] you are a creature of
[1:18:51] Eternity Hallelujah you may not know it
[1:18:54] you may not recognize it but that's all
[1:18:56] right because there's nobody who was
[1:18:59] born who understood their purpose until
[1:19:01] God revealed it to them Hallelujah it
[1:19:04] took the revealer to reveal to each
[1:19:06] individual their purpose nobody was born
[1:19:09] knowing who they were it took a
[1:19:11] revelation from the revealer himself to
[1:19:14] make it known unto each individual what
[1:19:17] they were born to do what they were born
[1:19:19] to achieve here is God in the scripture
[1:19:21] we read to Jeremiah then the word of the
[1:19:24] Lord came unto me saying in other words
[1:19:27] Jeremiah you don't even know but I want
[1:19:29] you to know before I formed the in the
[1:19:31] [Applause]
[1:19:33] belly before I formed thee in the belly
[1:19:36] I knew thee I'm not now getting to know
[1:19:38] you I'm now now getting to meet you I'm
[1:19:41] not now looking at you on this Sunday
[1:19:42] morning but before you were formed in
[1:19:44] the belly I already knew you I know what
[1:19:47] you'd want to eat and know what you'd go
[1:19:49] through and know your struggles and
[1:19:51] before thou camest out of the womb I
[1:19:55] sanctify thee Hallelujah and I ordain
[1:19:59] thee to be a prophet unto the
[1:20:02] [Applause]
[1:20:03] Nations do you understand that you are
[1:20:06] part of the same genealogy you are part
[1:20:08] of the same lineage you are part of this
[1:20:11] same DNA before you were formed in the
[1:20:13] belly God knew you hle and he put you in
[1:20:17] this age he put you in this day

[1:21:33] more because you're coming into a
[1:21:35] greater realization of who you are you
[1:21:37] are coming to a recognition that you are
[1:21:39] royalty Hallelujah I said in Nigeria
[1:21:42] that when Prince Charles or Prince Harry
[1:21:44] when they were born they didn't know who
[1:21:45] they
[1:21:48] were they just born like any baby but

[1:22:13] clothes that already taken care of
[1:22:15] because of who you are there's land

[1:22:29] certain benefits certain privileges
[1:22:32] certain expectations certain promises
[1:22:35] certain entitlements certain things will
[1:22:38] happen to you just because you don't
[1:22:41] have to earn it just because you don't
[1:22:43] have to fight for it just because you
[1:22:46] don't have to save money for it but just
[1:22:48] because just because your father is a
[1:22:51] king just because your mother is a queen
[1:22:54] [Applause]

[1:23:28] hallelujah that is by
[1:23:37] [Music]
[1:23:39] Design I shared in Nigeria said
[1:23:42] listen I'm not into the politics but the
[1:23:45] royal family has worked to try to disown
[1:23:47] Harry to some extent because of his
[1:23:50] choice in marriage they stripped some
[1:23:52] kind of military title from him they but
[1:23:54] but the reality is nothing they do could
[1:23:56] take the media off of him because of who
[1:23:59] he
[1:24:00] is they could pull piece of the land or
[1:24:02] the title but the reality he's still a
[1:24:06] son he make bad decisions in their books
[1:24:09] but he's still a son if they could have
[1:24:11] erased the fact that he was born in the
[1:24:13] family maybe they could do it but they
[1:24:14] can't do it because he was born into the
[1:24:18] family and many of us we have made
[1:24:21] mistakes but you know what we've been
[1:24:23] ped family you might have lost this you
[1:24:26] might have lost this you might have lost
[1:24:28] that you might have lost this but you
[1:24:29] were born into the family and the devil
[1:24:32] oh come on now he wish he could take
[1:24:34] your name but your name is written in
[1:24:36] the Lamb's Book of Life In The Blood
[1:24:43] section can the church say
[1:24:45] [Applause]
[1:24:51] Amen it's more important brother she to
[1:24:54] have faith in your account and money in
[1:24:56] your
[1:25:03] account it's more important to have joy
[1:25:06] in your account and money in your
[1:25:07] account because the joy of the Lord is
[1:25:10] your strength the faith of the Lord or
[1:25:12] the faith in the Lord could take care of
[1:25:15] with the doctor the biggest doctor bill
[1:25:17] that you could ever have that money
[1:25:18] could try to address put Faith to deal
[1:25:20] with the bill and what's Faith bypass
[1:25:23] the bill go to the problem and heal you
[1:25:25] in your body that the bill is no longer
[1:25:27] necessary and it's because of who you
[1:25:29] are it's your spiritual
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:34] identity listen when the children of
[1:25:36] Israel left Egypt they really didn't
[1:25:38] have a big relationship with God in know
[1:25:41] they had been in bondage for so long
[1:25:43] that they had lost certain things but
[1:25:46] God said because you are my people when
[1:25:47] you walk your shoes wouldn't go down
[1:25:51] when he get sick I'll put a rod there
[1:25:53] and put sinks around rod and when you
[1:25:55] look and you could look and you could
[1:25:56] live he know was all kind of Believers
[1:25:59] in there but because of who they were he
[1:26:00] said I put I put put food for you every
[1:26:03] single day can the church say Amen what
[1:26:05] is it it's a Divine
[1:26:10] mystery it's a Divine mystery that's why
[1:26:12] you could be happy when the devil
[1:26:14] expected to be
[1:26:16] sad you know what reasons you have this
[1:26:18] morning to be
[1:26:21] upset punch much reasons if they asking
[1:26:24] much reasons you have to be upset and
[1:26:26] frustrated and upset you could come up
[1:26:27] with a whole
[1:26:28] list but I could guarantee you if you're
[1:26:31] right all your problems on on one
[1:26:33] side and look on the other side and turn
[1:26:36] the page I had to write all the benefits
[1:26:38] and the blessings I could guarantee you
[1:26:40] you will find more on the side of
[1:26:42] blessing than the side to
[1:26:44] complain you know that song Count Your
[1:26:47] Blessings name them one by one when last
[1:26:49] you count your blessings and you name
[1:26:50] them Lord I Thank you for waking me up
[1:26:53] that itself is a blessing I could lift
[1:26:55] my hands in the house of God that itself
[1:26:57] accounting that one too accounting the
[1:26:59] fact that you put my name on the book oh
[1:27:02] you don't hear me this morning
[1:27:03] accounting the fact that I could sing I
[1:27:06] might sing the best but I could sing and
[1:27:08] accounting that blessing too can the
[1:27:11] church say amen I thank God for my
[1:27:13] family I thank God for the Holy Ghost I
[1:27:15] thank God for salvation I thank God for
[1:27:17] the prophet I thank God for the message
[1:27:20] I thank God for the church I thank God
[1:27:22] for the pastor I thank God for every
[1:27:24] trial send my
[1:27:26] way to form and to shape and to cut and
[1:27:30] to
[1:27:34] mold I'm just talking to the church this
[1:27:36] morning just encourage you along this
[1:27:39] life's
[1:27:40] journey because it's a Divine
[1:27:43] mystery God could have done it in many
[1:27:46] different
[1:27:48] ways I talked about Matthew 8 and
[1:27:51] Matthew 14 how God unfolding this divine
[1:27:54] mystery to his own disciples because he
[1:27:56] is preparing them for tough days
[1:27:58] ahead and I've said before if you don't
[1:28:01] become unbreakable life will break
[1:28:05] you so the training we go through in
[1:28:08] life is for us to become unbreakable we
[1:28:11] need to be flexible enough that we can
[1:28:14] move without
[1:28:16] breaking so Paul say to the strong I
[1:28:19] became strong to the weak I became weak
[1:28:22] he said I know what it is to have and I
[1:28:23] know what it is to not have and in all
[1:28:25] this thing are giving God
[1:28:28] thanks so he not letting no money in his
[1:28:31] pocket affect his Joy his praise His
[1:28:33] worship he not allow allow his
[1:28:35] environment well it's because of this is
[1:28:38] why I'm not in church and because of
[1:28:39] this is why he seeing me
[1:28:44] no he has become
[1:28:46] unbreakable nothing can move him nothing
[1:28:49] could shake his feet though this person
[1:28:51] walk away this person nothing because
[1:28:53] he's not in church for the people he's
[1:28:54] in church to meet the
[1:28:57] Lord his faith is not in his office his
[1:28:59] faith is in who he is can the church say
[1:29:03] amen and okay if you're Deacon Usher
[1:29:05] Minister it doesn't matter your
[1:29:07] confidence in God is Not based on your
[1:29:09] position your title it's based on your
[1:29:11] identity because the title and the
[1:29:13] position comes based on your identity if
[1:29:16] you are not in the family you can't get
[1:29:18] anything that's why when you're in the
[1:29:20] body there's a measure of Grace for you
[1:29:22] in the body
[1:29:23] [Music]
[1:29:26] and by one Spirit we are baptized into
[1:29:29] the body our place in the body is by
[1:29:32] Spirit not by attendance but by Spirit
[1:29:35] can the church say Amen can you take
[1:29:37] some more this morning I'm still warming
[1:29:41] up from the message Christ is the
[1:29:43] mystery of God
[1:29:44] revealed but the bandam said now God had
[1:29:47] a purpose and a hidden Mystery and
[1:29:50] that's what I want to speak onto the
[1:29:51] church this morning the hidden Mystery
[1:29:53] of God that he had had in his mind
[1:29:54] before the world ever began and how that
[1:29:57] it's unfolded itself right down to this
[1:30:00] present hour that we are living amen
[1:30:04] then you'll understand clearly this
[1:30:06] mystery of God friends this mystery of
[1:30:10] God cannot be found in a
[1:30:11] university it cannot be found by reading
[1:30:14] academic exploits and academic books
[1:30:16] this mystery comes to you by an
[1:30:19] interaction and an encounter with the
[1:30:21] revealer of the mystery it comes from an
[1:30:24] experience with the Lord himself and
[1:30:26] that has been one of the biggest
[1:30:27] challenges we have is that people don't
[1:30:29] know the Lord they know the church they
[1:30:33] know scriptures but to know him is life
[1:30:36] to have a relationship with him is life
[1:30:38] and if you ever meet him then it doesn't
[1:30:40] matter what anybody else does because he
[1:30:42] reveals himself to you whether you're
[1:30:45] sick whether you're up whether you're
[1:30:46] down your relationship with him
[1:30:48] supersedes everything else that
[1:30:50] revelation of who you are is what makes
[1:30:52] you stand under pressure
[1:30:55] isn't that right young
[1:30:57] people it makes you dress a certain way
[1:31:00] it makes you speak a certain way it
[1:31:02] makes you live a certain way it makes
[1:31:04] you resist what the enemy presents to
[1:31:06] you because of who you are that
[1:31:08] recognition of who you are says you
[1:31:10] cannot do certain
[1:31:12] things I heard an interview with
[1:31:14] President Obama when he was in office or
[1:31:16] he was speaking about when he was in
[1:31:17] office and he said as the President of
[1:31:19] the United States he was he was not
[1:31:21] allowed to drive
[1:31:26] because the office required a certain
[1:31:28] type of driver he can't just Ops and get
[1:31:31] up and I go for a
[1:31:33] spin so he had to adjust his behavior
[1:31:35] because his office required him to live
[1:31:37] a certain way he can't feel say
[1:31:41] drish and he related a scenario where
[1:31:43] one of the officers on the White House
[1:31:46] property got an electric vehicle and he
[1:31:48] said he saw it he liked it he say can I
[1:31:50] can I test drive it so the officer said
[1:31:53] well go ahead he said the moment he
[1:31:55] stepped in that vehicle and start to
[1:31:57] move a little bit this is on the grounds
[1:31:58] of the White House Secret Service lock
[1:32:00] down lock down they say he couldn't get
[1:32:03] to move far because he was out of his
[1:32:09] office because of the office do you know
[1:32:12] that if the president his life is in
[1:32:14] danger and he say well I want to go into
[1:32:15] the Danger The Secret Service is
[1:32:16] authorized to knock him out
[1:32:19] unconscious and move him out of the
[1:32:22] danger he wanted be brave heart he want
[1:32:24] to
[1:32:25] be some hero and run into danger they
[1:32:28] say no you need to go down in the bunker
[1:32:31] we have soers for
[1:32:32] that so if natural man could put things
[1:32:35] in place to protect a natural office
[1:32:38] against themselves what do you think God
[1:32:41] will do to protect do you realize that
[1:32:44] you are the royalty on the earth more
[1:32:46] Royal than the you I don't think I I
[1:32:49] don't think you get what I'm saying this
[1:32:52] morning man sitting on and putting
[1:32:54] measures in place to protect the
[1:32:56] bloodline of royal families in the Dutch
[1:32:59] in the the Spanish the English and all
[1:33:01] these traditional monarchies do you
[1:33:03] realize you're part of a
[1:33:04] monarchy and there's a king of
[1:33:07] kings and that King of Kings says that
[1:33:10] you are Kings and
[1:33:12] Priests and that you are going to rign
[1:33:14] on the earth and because you're going to
[1:33:16] Reign on the earth there are certain
[1:33:18] powers that are given to you that
[1:33:19] whatever you bind on Earth Bound in
[1:33:21] heaven whatever you loose on Earth is lo
[1:33:23] in heaven that if you will pick up
[1:33:25] deadly things it wouldn't harm
[1:33:28] you because of who you
[1:33:30] [Music]
[1:33:33] are so how could somebody in royal
[1:33:35] family end up drunk on some corner
[1:33:42] somewhere you trying to sneak out the
[1:33:44] White
[1:33:45] House you trying to sneak out because
[1:33:48] you you want to go and meet some friend
[1:33:50] and
[1:33:56] because your royalty you have to I want
[1:33:58] to speak to the young people can I talk
[1:33:59] to the young people a little bit and it
[1:34:01] might apply to some many calebs too who
[1:34:04] not fully sure of their
[1:34:07] identity their spiritual
[1:34:11] identity there's a reason they write
[1:34:13] speeches for presidents and kings and
[1:34:15] monarchs and thing because they want to
[1:34:18] make sure they don't just say anything
[1:34:20] because your words could start a war
[1:34:22] your words could end a war your words
[1:34:24] your words are powerful where you go who
[1:34:26] you meet with your conduct your
[1:34:28] etiquette you where you dress your
[1:34:30] mannerisms you go to different countries
[1:34:32] different count different norms and
[1:34:33] Customs so there's a protocol officer
[1:34:35] who's there to prep the president when
[1:34:37] you go into this country don't extend
[1:34:39] your hand this way they bow this way
[1:34:40] they do this because all this is conduct
[1:34:43] befitting an
[1:34:45] officer and the word comes to us to
[1:34:47] shape us but the Anthony says to mold us
[1:34:49] so no matter what situation is you
[1:34:52] conduct yourself in a way yeah that
[1:34:54] speaks to the office that you are in we
[1:34:57] are all in an office we all have a role
[1:35:00] to play and when you are in your school
[1:35:01] on your job you are walking in the
[1:35:04] office can the church say
[1:35:06] amen I heard a brother say yesterday
[1:35:09] that we are
[1:35:12] ambassadors of the kingdom and when an
[1:35:15] ambassador Walks In A Country he is
[1:35:17] representing the country he
[1:35:20] represents the US Embassy in Trinidad is
[1:35:23] America in Trinidad and the Trinidad
[1:35:26] Embassy in the next country is Trinidad
[1:35:28] in that next country that's why if you
[1:35:30] are in a foreign country and there's a
[1:35:31] Trinidad Embassy there you could be
[1:35:33] running for your life the moment you
[1:35:35] cross into your Embassy nobody could
[1:35:36] follow you because that ground of the
[1:35:39] embassy is the ground of the country
[1:35:42] even though you're in another country
[1:35:43] it's recognized and respected as such
[1:35:46] and they have to say well you are under
[1:35:47] the custody of your
[1:35:50] government can the church say
[1:35:52] Amen there's diplomatic
[1:35:55] immunity because of who you are not to
[1:35:58] do the wrong thing but to realize that
[1:35:59] you are an Untouchable because you are
[1:36:01] being represented by another nation and
[1:36:04] here we are representing an eternal
[1:36:06] Kingdom in a Time
[1:36:09] Kingdom and I know you don't realize it
[1:36:11] but you have diplomatic immunity all you
[1:36:14] have to do is get on the safe ground of
[1:36:16] your Embassy and when you touch your
[1:36:18] Embassy all these soldiers all the this
[1:36:21] is why you have to be on your ground
[1:36:24] your Embassy is not the club you have no
[1:36:27] protection when you go to the club oh
[1:36:29] you don't hear me this morning now you
[1:36:31] now I want you to connect the dots when
[1:36:33] you go to Carnival F that's not your
[1:36:35] ground you are off of your protection
[1:36:37] but when you are in your environment
[1:36:39] when you're in your safe place the devil
[1:36:41] have to watch you but he can't touch you
[1:36:44] he said put the blood on the doorpost
[1:36:46] and when I see the blood I'll pass over
[1:36:49] you the enemy can't come onto your
[1:36:51] ground that's why you stay away from
[1:36:53] from Shady
[1:37:00] places
[1:37:02] listen look back through history there
[1:37:04] are very few if any instances of
[1:37:07] embassies that have been invaded by
[1:37:08] other
[1:37:09] countries it don't just happen like that
[1:37:12] because it triggers global war if the
[1:37:14] Russians try to enter the US Embassy in
[1:37:17] Russia you know much problem that is
[1:37:19] because the whole host of the government
[1:37:21] all the warships go on Red Alert because
[1:37:24] they don't want to cross the line to say
[1:37:26] if the American has made it to their
[1:37:27] Embassy we can't touch them if they step
[1:37:30] out the embassy they fair game pick them
[1:37:31] up so they're waiting around the corner
[1:37:34] they're looking around this side if you
[1:37:35] slip up and get out that's that's on you
[1:37:37] but if you stay inside your Embassy and
[1:37:40] you go under the authority of your
[1:37:42] protectors then no devil could come near
[1:37:44] you and I want to encourage you this
[1:37:46] morning stay on your safe
[1:37:49] ground don't go onto the enemy's ground
[1:37:52] unless God says to go
[1:37:54] that's why David asked the question
[1:37:55] shall I
[1:37:57] pursue he said because Lord if I don't
[1:37:59] get a word I'm not moving I want to stay
[1:38:01] on my safe
[1:38:02] ground and David put on the ephod and
[1:38:05] David began to pray to the Lord he said
[1:38:07] the enemy came to our ground and took
[1:38:09] our our eyes and he said Lord shall I
[1:38:11] pursue and God tell him pursue in other
[1:38:13] words if I give you the permission to
[1:38:15] pursue then the host of the armies of
[1:38:17] the Lord are with you then no weapon
[1:38:19] formed against you could Prosper no
[1:38:21] demonic attack could prosper no devil
[1:38:24] could stop you because you have Divine
[1:38:26] Authority by a Divine mystery based on
[1:38:29] your spiritual identity to go into the
[1:38:32] devil's camp and take back what the
[1:38:34] devil stole from
[1:38:36] [Music]
[1:38:37] [Applause]
[1:38:44] [Music]
[1:38:46] you brother brandham gave the story of
[1:38:48] the young lady who was delivered and she
[1:38:50] went back into the barn and Spirit came
[1:38:51] back upon her
[1:38:54] why you trying to expose yourself do you
[1:38:56] understand that the music you listen to
[1:38:58] the places you go the conversations you
[1:39:01] have the movies you watch the books you
[1:39:03] read the clothes you dress all these
[1:39:06] things have an impact on the ground you
[1:39:09] represent if you have never thought
[1:39:11] about it that way and you know this
[1:39:13] gospel to be the truth recognize that
[1:39:15] you as an individual are an ambassador
[1:39:18] for the
[1:39:19] kingdom your words represent a kingdom
[1:39:22] the way you rest represent a kingdom
[1:39:25] where you go represent a kingdom not
[1:39:28] your mother's house not your father's
[1:39:30] house but your heavenly
[1:39:32] father there are many people who will
[1:39:35] Who are looking to see Jesus and the
[1:39:37] only Jesus they will see is the Jesus in
[1:39:40] you your testimony could change
[1:39:43] someone's life your humility could
[1:39:45] change someone's life your prayer life
[1:39:48] supposed to change somebody's life your
[1:39:49] humility your forgiveness your purity
[1:39:53] your desire to serve God supposed to
[1:39:55] radiate something that the enemy knows
[1:39:58] that this is somebody different they
[1:39:59] have been touched by the Master's Hand
[1:40:02] they come from God and they're going
[1:40:03] back to God can the church say Amen it's
[1:40:06] a hunger for Holiness it's a cry for
[1:40:09] Purity it's a
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:40:16] desperation you represent a kingdom why
[1:40:18] do your fingers look like
[1:40:20] that you represent a kingdom why does
[1:40:23] why why why does your hair look like
[1:40:24] that is that the
[1:40:28] kingdom should I keep driving or should
[1:40:35] I some people say reverse some people
[1:40:37] say drive in every Church three kinds of
[1:40:40] Believers you know but I only have one
[1:40:42] Authority this morning to speak what the
[1:40:44] Lord put upon my
[1:40:45] [Applause]
[1:40:47] heart because when President Obama went
[1:40:49] to the car he was in his Joy of a
[1:40:52] electric vehicle you know
[1:40:54] he didn't think it was wrong but his
[1:40:56] secret service was there to say you
[1:40:58] can't do that to know and so too the
[1:41:00] tutor the Holy Ghost is here to say you
[1:41:02] can't do that to know you might want to
[1:41:05] do it you might desire to do it but
[1:41:08] because of who you are you cannot do it
[1:41:11] because of who you are that music you
[1:41:13] like you can't listen to it maybe it was
[1:41:16] part of what you did but not because of
[1:41:18] this office because you're in this
[1:41:19] office because you're in this office
[1:41:22] because you are son of King because you
[1:41:24] are daughter of the king the things you
[1:41:26] used to
[1:41:27] do you cannot do them no
[1:41:31] more the conversations you used to have
[1:41:34] you cannot have them no
[1:41:37] more you can't say the first thing come
[1:41:40] to your mind because you're in our
[1:41:41] office your words have gravity if you
[1:41:44] shall say to this mountain that the kind
[1:41:46] of words that he canot powering
[1:41:50] you everybody to P your words up
[1:41:57] powerful I was having a conversation
[1:41:59] with someone and they're speaking about
[1:42:00] the fact that your words are so powerful
[1:42:03] so you don't say I am
[1:42:06] sick you don't speak that words the
[1:42:09] doctor
[1:42:12] say is a big difference you
[1:42:17] know the doctor report saying something
[1:42:22] but I say I'm
[1:42:25] Healed by his stripes I'm
[1:42:28] [Applause]
[1:42:29] Healed your words are
[1:42:35] powerful that's why let you weak say
[1:42:38] you're strong you don't have to accept
[1:42:40] what is said or there are others some
[1:42:43] say Jesus say what who do you say I am
[1:42:46] what is your testimony what is your
[1:42:48] declaration what is the words that
[1:42:49] coming out your mouth people say so much
[1:42:51] negative things about themselves
[1:42:55] yeah but I want to encourage you this
[1:42:57] morning the negative things you say
[1:42:59] doesn't change your
[1:43:01] identity you could be a depressed son
[1:43:03] you're still a son you could be a weak
[1:43:05] son you're still a son you could be a
[1:43:07] son who has lost their purpose but
[1:43:10] you're still a son you're still a
[1:43:12] daughter you lost your way like The
[1:43:14] Prodigal Son the fact that he was eating
[1:43:17] pig food but the George didn't change
[1:43:18] the fact that he was a son he was a
[1:43:21] messed up son but he was still a son
[1:43:24] and we have some messed up sons and some
[1:43:26] messed up daughters but it doesn't
[1:43:27] change the fact that you are still a son
[1:43:29] still a daughter and God is here to
[1:43:32] restore listen I had no plans to see
[1:43:35] this this morning but if this is for
[1:43:36] somebody I don't know who it's for then
[1:43:38] I pray to God that you get a revelation
[1:43:41] of who you are whose you are and you
[1:43:43] walk out of whatever prison has you
[1:43:45] bound can the Church Say Amen
[1:43:54] Hall so Because of Who You Are Young
[1:43:56] Brother young sister don't follow the
[1:43:58] Playbook of the world because they are
[1:44:01] following their playbook their dreams
[1:44:03] their hopes their ambition their dress
[1:44:05] their fashion their Styles the societal
[1:44:08] pressure the social media influence
[1:44:10] these things will destroy your
[1:44:14] faith can the church say
[1:44:18] amen God is a mystery and because you
[1:44:22] are part of God you are also a mystery
[1:44:25] God in his great desire to express
[1:44:27] himself We Know It This is not new to us
[1:44:30] God has existed alone he was the
[1:44:32] self-existent one he couldn't even be
[1:44:34] called God because there was nobody to
[1:44:35] worship him we know this so when when
[1:44:37] God created the angels and they start to
[1:44:39] say holy holy holy are you Lord then God
[1:44:42] becames God because God means object of
[1:44:44] worship so is he your God if you're not
[1:44:48] worshiping that's why I said worship has
[1:44:51] nothing to do with you praise you praise
[1:44:54] God for what he has done but worship is
[1:44:56] based on who he is so you praise him
[1:44:59] because he help you with a job but you
[1:45:01] worship God because he is God you
[1:45:03] worship God because he is bigger than
[1:45:05] your
[1:45:06] problem you worship God because he is
[1:45:09] God he is all by himself though he slay
[1:45:12] me yet I'll trust him but he is still
[1:45:14] God and he is the object of
[1:45:17] worship worship him when you're sad
[1:45:19] worship him when you're happy worship
[1:45:22] Him in the morning worship him in the
[1:45:24] evening worship him when you can't see
[1:45:26] your way you still
[1:45:35] worship the Divine
[1:45:38] mystery of your spiritual
[1:45:41] identity God wanted to express himself
[1:45:44] an omnipotent God an omnicient God an
[1:45:48] all powerful God had to find a way to
[1:45:52] express
[1:45:54] a Divine
[1:45:56] mystery all the books in the world could
[1:45:58] not contain
[1:46:01] him he was just too big too powerful he
[1:46:05] could do anything he's too Sovereign you
[1:46:08] could write and write and still can't
[1:46:09] write enough about him but God always
[1:46:11] wanted to express himself he didn't want
[1:46:14] to remain a mystery the mystery of God
[1:46:17] was so great God had to take centuries
[1:46:19] to slowly reveal himself layer after
[1:46:22] layer page after page story after Story
[1:46:25] son after son daughter after daughter
[1:46:28] all part of the expression of God
[1:46:31] hallelujah God put man in the Garden of
[1:46:33] Eden as an expression of himself but
[1:46:35] that man couldn't even express all that
[1:46:37] God was because God couldn't Express who
[1:46:39] he was to that man until that man fell
[1:46:41] oh you don't hear me this morning he was
[1:46:43] just a father to Adam but when Adam fell
[1:46:45] he became more than a father oh you can
[1:46:48] I say that one more time he was a father
[1:46:50] to Adam but when Adam fell now we could
[1:46:52] be a SA avor now we could be a redeemer
[1:46:54] now we could be a restorer now we could
[1:46:56] be a deliverer and sometime God send us
[1:46:59] through some stuff to be more to us than
[1:47:02] he was to us
[1:47:05] before some of us if you never got sick
[1:47:07] you don't know him as a Healer oh you
[1:47:09] don't hear me this morning I don't think
[1:47:11] you hear me this morning if you never
[1:47:13] knew sickness you would never know him
[1:47:15] as your healer you could always say he
[1:47:17] you know you healed that person but when
[1:47:19] you went through sickness now you can
[1:47:21] say the Lord is my healer when you go
[1:47:23] through weakness you can say the Lord is
[1:47:25] my refuge he is my strength when you go
[1:47:28] through crisis he hides me in his pilion
[1:47:31] not he hides my brother or my sister
[1:47:33] this is now my testimony oh you don't
[1:47:35] hear me this morning David could now say
[1:47:37] the Lord is my shepherd maybe he was
[1:47:40] brother pun Shepherd but now he's my
[1:47:42] shepherd because as a sheep I know what
[1:47:44] it was to be lost and God found me oh
[1:47:46] you don't hear me this morning he
[1:47:48] becomes a personal
[1:47:51] God it becomes your
[1:47:56] testimony so don't look at your trials
[1:47:59] and your situations as as poor me no
[1:48:02] this is God's ability now for you to
[1:48:04] write more about him that is your
[1:48:05] personal
[1:48:08] testimony So Daniel could say he was
[1:48:10] there with me in the fire in in in the
[1:48:11] Lions
[1:48:14] then listen some of us have to work in
[1:48:16] our testimony to meet Daniel and and the
[1:48:18] Hebrew boys and them know
[1:48:25] we need bigger trials to get bigger
[1:48:28] testimonies can I say that one more
[1:48:31] time the woman who was about to cook the
[1:48:34] last meal She Was preparing to say let
[1:48:37] me cook my last meal then we're going to
[1:48:38] just die and then Elijah happened to
[1:48:41] pass that
[1:48:42] way and say bake me a cake
[1:48:46] first and she had a testimony I was just
[1:48:49] here about to cook my last meal to bake
[1:48:51] me a cake first and for three and a half
[1:48:54] years whenever she dipped for meal there
[1:48:56] was meal when she dipped for oil you
[1:48:59] know what her test for Years brother you
[1:49:01] know what a testimony was this food
[1:49:03] never run out to no in the famine God
[1:49:05] found a way to Min that was now her
[1:49:08] testimony and you know the Bible say
[1:49:10] they overcame by the blood of the lamb
[1:49:12] and the word of their testimony So Young
[1:49:15] Brother young sister you have to have a
[1:49:16] testimony of how you overcame and what
[1:49:19] you
[1:49:21] overcame so don't look at me when you
[1:49:23] have a trial or a test or a situation it
[1:49:25] is a reason for you to build a testimony
[1:49:28] and for God to be more to you in that
[1:49:31] particular area than he was to you
[1:49:32] before can the church say Amen so God in
[1:49:36] his great plan could we could we take
[1:49:38] some more I haven't even gotten the
[1:49:40] message yester
[1:49:42] now I'm on page four of 25 and I have
[1:49:45] two other
[1:49:47] sections pursue I like
[1:49:51] that God want to express himself he
[1:49:54] wants to express himself in your
[1:49:55] marriage he wants to express himself in
[1:49:57] your situation on your job he wants to
[1:49:59] express himself in your business he
[1:50:01] wants to express himself in your school
[1:50:03] he wants to express himself when you're
[1:50:06] back against a wall and you feel like a
[1:50:08] run out of options he wants to express
[1:50:11] himself as God to you this great message
[1:50:14] that came through this great prophet
[1:50:16] messenger of Malachi 4 is not for us to
[1:50:20] be caught in a mystery that can't relate
[1:50:22] to this world is for the mystery to
[1:50:23] become flesh to deal with the situations
[1:50:26] that come our
[1:50:27] way to deal with the frustrations and
[1:50:30] the but man PR message why are we so
[1:50:33] tossed about and letting off the
[1:50:35] pressure this message is to let off the
[1:50:39] pressure this message you to live life
[1:50:42] with a smile with a confidence that when
[1:50:44] you don't have it all figured out he
[1:50:50] does God didn't want to a mystery the
[1:50:53] mystery of God was so great God took
[1:50:55] centuries to slowly reveal himself he
[1:50:58] didn't want to be complicated he didn't
[1:51:00] want to be misunderstood he didn't want
[1:51:02] you to need a degree to understand him
[1:51:04] that's why he could take a simple
[1:51:06] uneducated prophet and bring the
[1:51:08] greatest mystery and tab all he Loose
[1:51:10] Ends but bam had no big education but
[1:51:12] God could take a simple man this is a
[1:51:14] simple
[1:51:16] message people want to make it
[1:51:18] complicated but it's a simple message
[1:51:21] sir he wanted anybody to talk to him
[1:51:24] that's why when the veil was Ren from
[1:51:26] top to bottom it was to allow you to
[1:51:28] have Divine access you didn't have to go
[1:51:30] to anybody you could access the Lord
[1:51:32] yourself because you were a son or
[1:51:33] daughter you don't have to go to the
[1:51:35] priest you don't have to go to a father
[1:51:36] you can say Lord here I am I'm in
[1:51:38] trouble I'm messed up I made a mistake I
[1:51:40] want to be restored heal me touch me
[1:51:42] reconcile me help
[1:51:46] me God had to find a way to take this
[1:51:49] mystery of who he was and bring it into
[1:51:51] simplicity
[1:51:57] and throughout scripture I've preached
[1:51:59] this before but I really want this to
[1:52:00] resonate with you in the middle of your
[1:52:03] trial in the middle of your uncertainty
[1:52:06] and when you're back against the wall
[1:52:08] and you feel like giving up you
[1:52:09] recognize that none of those who went
[1:52:11] before knew at the point in time what
[1:52:14] they were
[1:52:17] unfolding they were all born just you
[1:52:19] don't realize Elijah David all them were
[1:52:21] born just like you and I
[1:52:24] without until they came to a full
[1:52:26] realization of who they were they had no
[1:52:27] clue more than that they died without
[1:52:30] even understanding the part of the story
[1:52:32] that they were
[1:52:33] playing because only when you look back
[1:52:36] you could see all the pieces connected
[1:52:38] didn't the prophet teach us
[1:52:42] that all of those Heroes of Fate Heroes
[1:52:45] of
[1:52:48] old they didn't know what they were
[1:52:49] living out
[1:52:52] God spoke lip to air to Moses and
[1:52:55] Moses went on without seeing the whole
[1:52:59] picture the whole mystery unfold because
[1:53:01] God they couldn't show him the whole
[1:53:04] mystery yet still God as a deliverer in
[1:53:07] expressing himself as a deliverer used
[1:53:10] Moses to display that attribute of a
[1:53:14] deliverer so if you want to see what a
[1:53:16] deliverer looks like and what God as a
[1:53:18] deliverer looks like just look at Moses
[1:53:21] that's a reflection all peace of God the
[1:53:23] same material of God but it's a peace of
[1:53:26] God because Moses was not God but God
[1:53:28] was in
[1:53:30] Moses can the church say Amen when God
[1:53:33] wanted to express himself as a shepherd
[1:53:34] He gave us
[1:53:36] David as a Shepherd the same material he
[1:53:39] was a part of God an expression of God
[1:53:42] an expression of the thought of God for
[1:53:44] his day and his time but when you begin
[1:53:47] to connect Moses to David and you bring
[1:53:49] the shepherd and the deliverer together
[1:53:50] you get a closer picture of how God
[1:53:53] is can the church say Amen when God
[1:53:56] wanted a warrior he look at Joshua he
[1:53:58] say who best exemplifies Warrior he said
[1:54:01] let me find somebody and he found Joshua
[1:54:03] he said Joshua I want you to be a
[1:54:04] warrior take the people over into the
[1:54:06] promised
[1:54:07] land wherever you put your foot every
[1:54:11] inch that your foot shall tread upon
[1:54:13] that is your land as an example to us of
[1:54:16] what a warrior a conqueror a possessor
[1:54:18] looks like can the church say Amen when
[1:54:20] God wanted to find a prophet like a to
[1:54:22] himself here he is looking at Elijah we
[1:54:25] have five types of the prophet of Elijah
[1:54:27] throughout
[1:54:30] scripture can the church say amen and
[1:54:33] here it was Elijah wasn't God but God
[1:54:36] was in Elijah a piece of God an
[1:54:38] expression of God a gene of God all
[1:54:41] through scripture every single person
[1:54:43] expressing a part of God a mystery of
[1:54:47] God an expression of God can the church
[1:54:49] say Amen but when Jesus came
[1:54:53] he wasn't a part of God he wasn't a
[1:54:55] piece of God he wasn't an attribute he
[1:54:57] was God himself all of the mystery that
[1:54:59] was laid out through all the Ages was
[1:55:01] finally wrapped up in a body called
[1:55:04] Jesus he was the mystery of God himself
[1:55:06] revealed Hallelujah he was the wheel in
[1:55:09] the middle of the wheel he was the great
[1:55:11] shepherd He was the Savior the Redeemer
[1:55:13] the master the priest the prophet he was
[1:55:15] the king all wrapped up in one all that
[1:55:18] was in God was pour into Christ and
[1:55:20] because of that Christ because of that
[1:55:22] Messiah because of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:55:24] all that was in him is now poured into
[1:55:26] us so we can continue the expression of
[1:55:29] God on the earth God will always have a
[1:55:31] witness in David's day he was the
[1:55:33] witness in Moses day he was the witness
[1:55:36] in Joshua's day he was the witness and
[1:55:38] in our
[1:55:39] day I'm looking at the witness this
[1:55:42] morning I'm looking at the expressions
[1:55:44] of God the Divine mystery of your
[1:55:46] spiritual identity
[1:55:56] Hallelujah a mystery to your friends
[1:55:59] friends young people you know too much
[1:56:02] now to be able to fit into the world you
[1:56:05] know I preach this to the young people
[1:56:07] years ago you know too much you can't
[1:56:09] dance like the world you can't fit into

[1:56:13] try to fit in they know you don't
[1:56:17] belong there used to be some sing for
[1:56:19] the kids one of these things just don't
[1:56:20] belong there when you go into the world
[1:56:21] they can tell you don't belong there so
[1:56:23] stop kidding
[1:56:26] yourself as much as you try to fit in
[1:56:29] you a whole big eagle in a ban of a
[1:56:31] chicken when you walk you bouncing down
[1:56:33] things and you're trying to fit in you

[1:59:34] that high can the church say amen
[1:59:37] hallelujah somebody give the Lord a
[1:59:39] shout of
[1:59:40] [Applause]
[1:59:42] Praise Is this helping anybody this
[1:59:46] morning there's a simple thought to
[1:59:48] encourage you this morning along the
[1:59:50] journey to remind you because that's the
[1:59:53] that's the great thing H but the B said
[1:59:55] the moment that the bright gets to know
[1:59:56] who she
[1:59:57] is then the Raptor going to go so the
[2:00:00] whole journey of the word is about
[2:00:02] revealing who you are and like that
[2:00:05] great sculpture who sculpt uh was
[2:00:07] Michael Angelo also he said when he had
[2:00:09] a cut he was cutting away everything
[2:00:11] that was not
[2:00:12] David cutting away everything that was
[2:00:15] not Elijah cutting away everything that
[2:00:16] was not the
[2:00:18] image he wasn't trying to form the image
[2:00:20] he was cutting the image out from the
[2:00:23] Rock by cutting away everything that was
[2:00:25] not supposed to be there so when you
[2:00:27] begin to cut away the things that don't
[2:00:28] belong to the image what will be left
[2:00:30] will be the image can the church say
[2:00:32] Amen so when you cut away your envy and
[2:00:35] your lust and your backbiting and your
[2:00:36] no prayer life and your not in the word
[2:00:38] and all them things that to disappear is
[2:00:41] only one thing is going to be left it's
[2:00:42] a statue of a perfect man because we're
[2:00:44] cutting away everything that's a shaping
[2:00:46] that's going on Lord take away my Envy
[2:00:49] cut my lust cut my whatever it is take
[2:00:51] it away this morning morning oh my lack
[2:00:53] of Desire help me get back to F and
[2:00:55] desire to please you Lord I give you
[2:00:57] permission shape mold cut make this
[2:00:59] morning take everything out that doesn't
[2:01:05] belong my pride my ambition whatever it
[2:01:08] is cut it this morning let my desire
[2:01:11] only be your desire let your desire be
[2:01:13] the least of my command can the church
[2:01:15] say Amen oh
[2:01:18] Hallelujah so you are mysterious people
[2:01:21] we some sometimes try to explain in
[2:01:23] message to people and people just can't
[2:01:24] get
[2:01:25] it and they can't because your mystery
[2:01:29] and if it's not reveal to them that they
[2:01:30] can never get it but to you it's a
[2:01:32] revelation of how you're going to go to
[2:01:34] the Rapture for you it's a revelation of
[2:01:36] how you're going to get to the other
[2:01:37] side and access things like perfect love
[2:01:39] and charity you talk to your family
[2:01:41] about charity and perfect love and seven
[2:01:42] tunders and Dynamics and and shaping and
[2:01:44] forming of the word image not they look
[2:01:46] at you like you're
[2:01:48] crazy brotherly kindness on some of
[2:01:51] compassion
[2:01:52] and forming of the word image and dying
[2:01:55] out to yourself and this Mortal putting
[2:01:58] on immortality a body changer the rapt
[2:02:00] is on the inside you walk the street now
[2:02:02] and tell people the rapt is on the
[2:02:05] inside they're going to want to register
[2:02:07] you somewhere but nothing wrong with you
[2:02:10] nothing wrong with me it's a mystery
[2:02:12] it's a mystery to the world the reason
[2:02:14] your young s have to dress modest and
[2:02:17] stay pure and stay chased and these
[2:02:19] things it's it's confusing to the world
[2:02:21] but it's a
[2:02:22] mystery the reason why you're smiling
[2:02:24] and you just lost your job and you're
[2:02:26] still happy what is it it's a mystery
[2:02:28] they can't understand you can the church
[2:02:30] say
[2:02:31] Amen they don't get
[2:02:37] you can the church say amen amen
[2:02:41] Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the
[2:02:42] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[2:02:45] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[2:02:47] be finished as he had declared to his
[2:02:50] servants the prophets
[2:02:52] when you were saved
[2:02:53] friends that was only part of the
[2:02:56] mystery this is not a Pentecostal church
[2:02:59] this is not a a a Christian this is know
[2:03:02] that because Christianity is being
[2:03:06] Christlike we have to go beyond
[2:03:08] salvation Salvation is just a step you
[2:03:10] know when you came into the message
[2:03:12] that's only part of the mystery so you
[2:03:14] can't say well I'm saved and I'm in the
[2:03:16] message that's only part of the mystery
[2:03:17] of who you are your spiritual identity
[2:03:20] is more than you being being saved or in
[2:03:22] the
[2:03:23] message can I say that one more time
[2:03:25] your identity is bigger than being in
[2:03:27] the message or being
[2:03:28] saved you being here this morning is
[2:03:31] only part of the mystery because the
[2:03:32] unfolding of the mystery of who you are
[2:03:34] entitles you to Perfection and adoption
[2:03:37] you are not predestinated to Salvation
[2:03:39] you are predestinated to adoption that's
[2:03:42] scripture so do they St and say well I'm
[2:03:44] saved I'm saved save is ABC you
[2:03:47] know you have to go beyond salvation all
[2:03:50] the way to adoption and adoption is a
[2:03:52] power and authority speaking the word
[2:03:56] the your signature just as good as the
[2:03:57] father's
[2:04:00] signature now right now you're praying
[2:04:02] for your son but when that time come you
[2:04:04] speak and say come forth and like
[2:04:06] Lazarus whether they're dead or Not Dead
[2:04:09] or Alive they have to come Jesus already
[2:04:12] demonstrated it dead or alive but the B
[2:04:14] say the pillar of fire will rest on the
[2:04:16] shoulders of the pre oh the adopted Sons
[2:04:20] you are not predestinated to to
[2:04:21] Salvation you are predestinated to
[2:04:26] adoption that's the Divine mystery of
[2:04:29] your spiritual
[2:04:33] identity right now some of us we save
[2:04:35] some of us go to different thing but but
[2:04:37] your name should be this is a saved son
[2:04:39] this is a redeemed son this is an
[2:04:41] adopted son this is a perfect son but
[2:04:44] call it born son fill son play
[2:04:48] Sons that's the unfolding of your
[2:04:50] spiritual identity brother the Jo
[2:04:52] and when they reach that point and they
[2:04:53] look at you they recognize but wait a
[2:04:54] minute we thought Jesus dead because you
[2:04:57] know when Jesus died they thought he
[2:04:59] dead know until Peter walked by the gate
[2:05:01] called beautiful and he had walked there
[2:05:03] many times before but this time was
[2:05:05] different he must have reached in his
[2:05:07] pocket I don't know and he recognized he
[2:05:08] don't have anything he says silver and
[2:05:09] gold I don't have but such as I have
[2:05:12] this was his identity now he says such
[2:05:14] as I have he didn't say such as somebody
[2:05:17] else you know say such as I have it's
[2:05:19] part of me it is my identity because I
[2:05:22] have it I can give it to you oh come on
[2:05:24] now somebody preach back to me such as I
[2:05:26] have I give unto you rise up and
[2:05:29] walk Peter was in his identity he was in
[2:05:32] his place he was in his
[2:05:35] position and Bram taught us perfect
[2:05:38] faith is based on your
[2:05:45] [Music]
[2:05:47] position can the church say
[2:05:50] Amen when people see you they must see
[2:05:53] Christ in
[2:05:54] you it don't take no explanation it
[2:05:56] don't have business card to say you're
[2:05:58] adopted you no they will see they will
[2:06:00] take
[2:06:00] note that you B with Jesus they will
[2:06:03] know you're medip pillar fire they will
[2:06:05] know you have a prayer closet they will
[2:06:07] know you cut out the world they will
[2:06:08] know you living a Sanctified life they
[2:06:10] will know you cut out certain things
[2:06:12] because you have not come to a
[2:06:14] realization of who you are can the
[2:06:16] church say amen
[2:06:20] hallelujah come we take some more from
[2:06:23] the message Witnesses brother the ROM
[2:06:24] said Jesus Christ is in a building
[2:06:26] tonight to perform
[2:06:28] Miracles but he does it through his
[2:06:30] church his people he said they shall lay
[2:06:32] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[2:06:35] in my name they shall cast out evil
[2:06:37] spirits is that right the commission is
[2:06:39] given to the church that's what the
[2:06:42] matter with the church today it doesn't
[2:06:44] know its
[2:06:46] position so not knowing your position is
[2:06:49] not knowing your identity but the B said
[2:06:51] if you know positionally who you was and
[2:06:55] what you are tonight there wouldn't be a
[2:06:57] feeble person in here in the next five
[2:06:59] minutes can I say that one more time if
[2:07:01] you know positionally who you was and
[2:07:05] what you
[2:07:08] are can I preach a little bit is there
[2:07:10] anybody in the house this morning if you
[2:07:12] know who you are and what you are oh you
[2:07:15] are not just a human you are not just
[2:07:17] somebody walking the street if you know
[2:07:19] who you are that you are Son of God and
[2:07:22] what you are you are in the bride if you
[2:07:25] know who you are you are born for such a
[2:07:27] time as this and what you are you are
[2:07:29] predestinated for adoption if you know
[2:07:32] who you
[2:07:33] [Applause]
[2:07:35] are butam said in 5
[2:07:38] minutes so when you look at this brother
[2:07:41] asby you can see why the enemy whole job
[2:07:43] and mission is to get you to think you
[2:07:45] somebody else it is why brother brand
[2:07:48] will preach a whole message called
[2:07:49] spiritual amnesia amen because people
[2:07:52] have forgotten who they are that's why
[2:07:54] God had to ask job job where was thou
[2:07:57] when I laid the foundation of the earth
[2:07:59] and the morning star sang together he
[2:08:01] had to remind job job listen shake off

[2:11:29] identity is a seed that you didn't put

[2:11:34] you are not even the
[2:11:36] believer but the word in you The Germ in
[2:11:39] you the seed in you even when you were
[2:11:42] backslidden that seed was believing even
[2:11:45] when you fell in sin that word seed was
[2:11:48] believing
[2:11:52] you have to forgive
[2:11:53] me it's my
[2:11:55] [Applause]
[2:11:58] testimony I'm trying to find a place to
[2:12:00] close out
[2:12:05] woo it's Sunday morning brother Clarence
[2:12:08] brother clar say don't close
[2:12:10] out blame blame brother
[2:12:13] Clarence he say pursue so we pursu in
[2:12:18] until you get a revelation that there's
[2:12:20] no excuse for you to be sad there is no
[2:12:23] excuse for you to be depressed there is
[2:12:25] no excuse for you to be frustrated I
[2:12:27] don't care what your husband did what
[2:12:29] your boss did what the government did
[2:12:31] what your neighbor did it doesn't matter
[2:12:33] there's a seed in you that's greater
[2:12:35] than the world there's a power in you
[2:12:38] that's greater than your
[2:12:40] situation bigger than your sickness
[2:12:43] bigger than your financial problem
[2:12:45] bigger than your family problem bigger
[2:12:47] than your lust problem bigger than your
[2:12:49] sin
[2:12:51] is a previously hidden truth now
[2:12:54] divinely revealed but which is a
[2:12:57] supernatural element Still Remains
[2:13:00] despite this
[2:13:02] Revelation so you are a mystery it means
[2:13:04] you are
[2:13:07] scripture previously
[2:13:11] hidden so you are the expression of
[2:13:17] scripture just like Mary was not named
[2:13:23] the Bible just said a virgin shall
[2:13:25] conceive and but Hugh it sat there for
[2:13:29] years nobody understood it it sounded
[2:13:32] crazy because craziness and mystery is
[2:13:35] closely
[2:13:40] connected every Prophet sounds crazy
[2:13:43] when Noah say it's going to rain it was
[2:13:45] going to sound crazy because it never
[2:13:46] rained
[2:13:48] before but when Isaiah say a virs shall
[2:13:51] see they say Isaiah just lost it but
[2:13:54] Here Comes Mary and Mary is born and
[2:13:57] that scripture lifts off of the
[2:14:00] Bible the scripture just raises off the
[2:14:03] Bible and the moment Mary is born sister
[2:14:06] oliv that scripture drops down above
[2:14:09] Mary Mary is going to school Mary is
[2:14:12] growing up and that scripture can't
[2:14:14] separate itself from Mary because she is
[2:14:17] the very manifestation of that scripture
[2:14:22] can the church say Amen when with the
[2:14:25] Bram was born the scripture Malachi 4 5
[2:14:29] and six lifted off of the
[2:14:32] scripture found its way to Kentucky
[2:14:35] found itself over a prophet St Luke
[2:14:38] 17:30 raised up from the scripture
[2:14:41] Revelation 10 raised up from the
[2:14:44] scripture and they all came in one place
[2:14:47] because somebody was on the earth who
[2:14:49] was a manifestation of their
[2:14:56] scripture I wonder this morning what
[2:14:59] happened when you were born

[2:15:09] kinds of scriptures start to fly off the

[2:15:33] mystery of your
[2:15:36] spiritual

[2:20:08] of your
[2:20:13] identity your identity is a real you I'm

[2:20:22] parents the identity is you real
[2:20:25] you I always say it you real you is when
[2:20:29] nobody else
[2:20:31] around is he in church oh
[2:20:34] go as if we had the Oscar and the
[2:20:37] Grammys and thing if they really come
[2:20:38] here we we we win you
[2:20:41] know we have good actors and good
[2:20:43] performers you
[2:20:44] know God bless
[2:20:47] you shake your hand and think normal
[2:20:49] normal I love you brother
[2:20:51] watch now and ni just performance you
[2:20:54] know performance that we have it locked
[2:20:56] down I don't think anybody else can
[2:20:59] compete people come and dress up for
[2:21:01] church on Sunday morning and but God
[2:21:04] help you if you see them on a
[2:21:06] Tuesday is a whole different
[2:21:10] person and the problem with that that's
[2:21:13] why you call identity
[2:21:15] crisis you're in crisis you already
[2:21:19] here it has people they leave the house
[2:21:22] husband and wife leave the house smiling
[2:21:23] watch now when I tell you is work it's
[2:21:25] work to acting acting is
[2:21:29] working because after by when the hours
[2:21:31] pass so and you get tired of acting then
[2:21:33] some point be really you show up that's
[2:21:36] why companies have
[2:21:38] probation because you could act for a
[2:21:40] week or two weeks three weeks but after
[2:21:42] 6 months
[2:21:44] probation some point in time over that
[2:21:46] six Monon probation you really would
[2:21:48] have show up
[2:21:52] Hall I remember when before I got
[2:21:54] married but a h came and give me some
[2:21:55] advice I hope I could say
[2:21:57] it but you I don't but you remember the
[2:22:00] advice you give me this is before I Get
[2:22:02] Married the elders speaking to the the
[2:22:06] Juniors you tell me but Isaac make sure
[2:22:08] you know how she is when she get
[2:22:13] angry whether he was don't know if you
[2:22:15] remember
[2:22:19] tell because CU When You're cting and
[2:22:21] thing people just put their best when I
[2:22:23] tell you their best foot if was your
[2:22:24] right foot the right foot all the way
[2:22:29] out but after they tie the
[2:22:32] nut then they see the left
[2:22:37] foot because at some point in time the
[2:22:40] real
[2:22:41] you will'll always show up
[2:22:53] and the thing about it is and this is
[2:22:55] where it gets
[2:22:57] interesting it is easy to mask who you
[2:23:00] are when things are going
[2:23:02] well because when things are going well
[2:23:04] you're not under the pressure of the
[2:23:07] external world or the inside
[2:23:09] world but under
[2:23:11] pressure the real you always
[2:23:17] appear and under pressure it's only when
[2:23:21] you could see things about yourself that
[2:23:23] you didn't even know was
[2:23:26] there and we have many examples in
[2:23:29] scripture just take the prodical Sun but
[2:23:31] preach a whole message on this the older
[2:23:33] brother up
[2:23:35] until the younger brother returned had a
[2:23:38] certain testimony in church you
[2:23:40] know fine Brother this brother is a
[2:23:42] blessed brother Deacon in the house of
[2:23:44] the Lord always there everything was
[2:23:47] fine when he younger brother went and
[2:23:49] think he shine even more more he's the
[2:23:51] one who stay in
[2:23:53] church he faithful faithful unto the
[2:23:56] Lord then young people and them is
[2:23:57] trouble young brother
[2:24:01] gone and I sure the older brother felt
[2:24:03] good but I still standing my poster Duty
[2:24:07] I just want to have testimony to thank
[2:24:09] God that I still had my poster Duty you
[2:24:11] know how those who stayed a
[2:24:14] songer but when the younger brother
[2:24:16] come that day is the day the Deon come
[2:24:19] late to church
[2:24:20] and he say what is that noise going on
[2:24:22] in the
[2:24:25] Tabernacle they say well your brother
[2:24:27] come back he said the
[2:24:31] Rascal and
[2:24:34] where where the cow that was chain up
[2:24:38] there where the Cal the calf was there
[2:24:41] last week somebody moved the Cal wa who
[2:24:44] who which did did he had Deon say move C
[2:24:46] well they say your father killed the
[2:24:48] calf he said the fatted one the one I
[2:24:50] was feeding for this last few
[2:24:54] years and he say I'm not going any
[2:24:58] service the Deacon didn't make it
[2:25:01] inside because under the pressure of and
[2:25:04] this wasn't this wasn't losing money
[2:25:06] losing car losing a job this was
[2:25:09] somebody being celebrated that was not
[2:25:12] him you see that situation this wasn't a
[2:25:16] sick my wife in the hospital this wasn't
[2:25:19] none of that you know this this is
[2:25:20] somebody come back to church who was not
[2:25:22] in church and I'm going say I'm not
[2:25:24] going
[2:25:25] inside all this time I hear they kill
[2:25:28] one calf a small calf the Big Calf that
[2:25:30] I was feeding they going to kill that
[2:25:32] for this Rascal the father have to go
[2:25:35] outside and say listen W to you all that
[2:25:38] I have is yours I need to tell you that
[2:25:40] you've been faithful oh go celebrate
[2:25:42] with your
[2:25:42] [Music]
[2:25:44] brother and that situation showed
[2:25:47] something in the older brother that had
[2:25:49] to be a
[2:25:53] addressed and many times situations come
[2:25:56] to us for us to know what we need to
[2:26:00] address it happens between mother
[2:26:02] daughter father brother sister employee
[2:26:05] coworker and God help us because some of
[2:26:07] us in the workplace we have no
[2:26:12] testimony because a testimony your
[2:26:15] identity is supposed to be your
[2:26:16] permanent character whether you're in
[2:26:19] the workplace whether that's
[2:26:20] said I respect the garbage collector I
[2:26:23] respect the male man that's the
[2:26:24] prophet's
[2:26:26] words he said if you don't respect the
[2:26:28] man I disrespect the office all this he
[2:26:30] taught us because is the way he lived
[2:26:33] and we are being challenged now to adopt
[2:26:36] and realize and walk in our true
[2:26:38] spiritual identity because it comes with
[2:26:41] an expectation of a certain kind of
[2:26:48] behavior you talk nice to the Casher you
[2:26:52] talk nice but your wife forget
[2:26:57] it greeting sister in church God bless
[2:26:59] you God bless you your wife God bless
[2:27:05] who I'm not talking to anybody in the
[2:27:08] church I'm just painting a picture of
[2:27:11] what not to do versus what to
[2:27:14] do but if the cap float around and fall
[2:27:17] anywhere and it fall on your head let it
[2:27:20] let it fit nicely so you could address
[2:27:22] the issue because we want to have the
[2:27:25] spiritual identity to make it to the
[2:27:27] other
[2:27:29] side it might sound somewhat comical but
[2:27:32] the reality is this gospel this message
[2:27:36] is to really produce a behavior
[2:27:39] change after all is said and done if
[2:27:42] your behavior a change have you really
[2:27:45] met the
[2:27:46] Lord because there are people who have
[2:27:48] sat with the books and tapes for decades
[2:27:50] and the behavior changed for 40 years 30
[2:27:53] years 20 years 10
[2:27:57] years and but Bram himself said he could
[2:28:00] preach blue till you BW to the face
[2:28:03] until it's revealed to you for you to do
[2:28:06] something about it because I can come
[2:28:08] into your house and deal with it from
[2:28:10] where I sit there certain things I can
[2:28:13] see brother Anthony but over but stepen
[2:28:15] the ministry God gives us ises certain
[2:28:18] things I and you imagine even the
[2:28:20] prophet but the brandham stood there
[2:28:23] seeing spirits issues challenges on the
[2:28:25] people and he still have to deal with
[2:28:27] them a certain way Jesus knew what Judas
[2:28:30] was and Jesus with his identity say
[2:28:33] whatever you do do quickly he even
[2:28:36] expose him man you say gun from here and
[2:28:38] just go and finish just go and
[2:28:40] no go and do what you
[2:28:43] do you don't know stabing remember back
[2:28:46] all the time and Jesus not pray them
[2:28:49] thought he was going to buy more
[2:28:51] bread because he didn't let out any
[2:28:54] animosity and we have heard it said
[2:28:56] about brother random you couldn't tell
[2:28:57] his enemy from his
[2:28:59] friends some of us we know who your
[2:29:01] enemy is you don't even discern you
[2:29:03] don't even need
[2:29:06] discernment there's some things we need
[2:29:08] say we don't even need we know who your
[2:29:10] enemy is and we know who your friends
[2:29:12] are what will it take for us to reach a
[2:29:14] level of maturity that that you begin to
[2:29:16] treat everyone like a child of God
[2:29:20] with love with Mercy with Grace that's
[2:29:22] why we preach don't write off anybody do
[2:29:24] you know when Paul was converted them
[2:29:26] brothers read the Bible had a problem
[2:29:28] with
[2:29:31] Paul and these are things that have to
[2:29:33] be addressed in the
[2:29:35] church because Paul was Saul who was
[2:29:39] killed brother Steven who was the Deacon
[2:29:41] them brothers brother Tony had some
[2:29:43] serious them other deacons so your
[2:29:44] comrade Brothers like this brother now
[2:29:48] come we know God to save everybody here
[2:29:51] but bearing witness with this one
[2:29:54] because they the Bible said they had a
[2:29:55] problem with
[2:29:57] him and here it was this is the first
[2:30:01] star of the ages the messenger to the
[2:30:05] Ephesians Church the one who could speak
[2:30:07] and could say withstood Peter to the
[2:30:09] face and Peter had to back down because
[2:30:12] the rules Peter wanted to implement from
[2:30:13] the Jews didn't apply to the Gen and
[2:30:15] Paul say hold your
[2:30:17] hands and his brothers had to be SP
[2:30:19] spiritual enough to put aside their
[2:30:21] differences and have respect for one
[2:30:24] another and it shows the need for a
[2:30:29] maturing and that's why at the end of
[2:30:31] the day we realize we still really need
[2:30:33] to grow up you
[2:30:35] know we need to grow up that's the real
[2:30:37] issue we need to grow up as children and
[2:30:40] even as adults because we have reach
[2:30:41] anything yet we will always be learning
[2:30:44] Paul could say I Die daily in other
[2:30:46] words daily every day I'm finding
[2:30:48] something I need to
[2:30:51] fix I approach it wrong and it takes a
[2:30:53] big man and a big woman to say I'm
[2:30:57] sorry I didn't mean it that way I didn't
[2:31:00] get it that way even the prophet made
[2:31:03] his own mistakes and God say you can't
[2:31:04] do you have to make things right and
[2:31:06] told the prophet you need to be more
[2:31:08] sincere oh God help me if God can tell
[2:31:11] the prophet you need to be more
[2:31:13] sincere I can't even stand up in the
[2:31:18] book so it's an encouragement to us to
[2:31:20] be more sensitive to our spiritual
[2:31:23] identity and for us to really grow
[2:31:25] beyond the simpler things oh gosh you're
[2:31:28] still fighting up with clothes and ha
[2:31:33] and first year you have first year
[2:31:35] second year then standard one then to
[2:31:37] standard five then secondary school and
[2:31:40] then University and then
[2:31:42] work how long you stay in first year you
[2:31:45] still fighting up with yeah really have
[2:31:47] to cover really to cover my knees
[2:31:58] when I was a child I speak as a child I
[2:32:00] act as a child a child but when I became
[2:32:02] a man I put away childish things we
[2:32:05] talking about possessing The Inheritance
[2:32:06] the Holy Ghost Land we talking about
[2:32:08] dealing with not the outer man anymore
[2:32:10] the outer man is easy the Bible say
[2:32:12] bring your body under subjection we
[2:32:14] didn't know with the inner man is the
[2:32:15] harder project you know but say the
[2:32:17] Philistines is them inner them inner
[2:32:19] issues the real issues you know none the
[2:32:21] things on the outside are we we trying
[2:32:22] to get beyond that young people to get
[2:32:24] to the man on the inside to put the Holy
[2:32:27] Ghost on the control tower of the heart
[2:32:29] because that's what happened to Peter
[2:32:30] when ananas and Safa came they didn't
[2:32:32] meet Peter no
[2:32:34] more the Holy Ghost was on Peter's
[2:32:37] Throne so Peter was talking but it
[2:32:39] wasn't Peter
[2:32:40] talking it was the angel of the Lord and
[2:32:43] then he say didn't lie unto me if it was
[2:32:44] me I might to give you a BL but you lie
[2:32:46] to the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost
[2:32:48] makes his own decisions on how to deal
[2:32:50] matters in the
[2:32:53] church so this is for us to be sensitive
[2:32:55] because it's going to come a day when
[2:32:57] the man of God will step behind the
[2:32:58] pulpit and it could be anybody it could
[2:33:00] be brother Anthony brother Steven
[2:33:01] brother Gideon brother over s anybody
[2:33:03] and it's no longer the minister speaking
[2:33:06] is the pillar of fire has taken his
[2:33:09] seat and say you haven't lied to me but
[2:33:12] the Holy Ghost dealing with you he
[2:33:14] promised that judgment will begin where
[2:33:15] in the sanctuary checking your attitude
[2:33:18] your approach he say enter into his
[2:33:19] gates with Thanksgiving enter into his
[2:33:21] court with praise leave your cares and
[2:33:24] your issues by the
[2:33:25] door you need to get pray the door ask
[2:33:27] the Deon say pray for me before you walk
[2:33:29] inside but come into the house of God
[2:33:32] with a desire Lord I want to be changed
[2:33:34] I want to be
[2:33:36] transformed we all have issues Jesus
[2:33:38] came and said they that are well have no
[2:33:40] need of a physician but I come to those
[2:33:43] that are broken I come to those that
[2:33:44] have struggles I come and he said come
[2:33:46] unto me all ye who are Laden and heavy
[2:33:49] laden
[2:33:50] and I will give you
[2:33:52] rest Amad over so beautifully preached
[2:33:55] it he said my yoke is easy and my burden
[2:33:59] is light the Bible never said there's no
[2:34:02] yoke and there's no burden there is a
[2:34:05] yoke there is a burden but my yoke is
[2:34:08] easy and my burden is
[2:34:10] light your office requires a certain
[2:34:14] Behavior your office that's the
[2:34:17] Yoke that's the burden it's the burden
[2:34:20] of leadership it's the Yoke of your
[2:34:23] office it's your testimony being put on
[2:34:26] trial because it's an expectation of you
[2:34:28] from the word with how you deal with
[2:34:30] situations I'm guilty you are guilty we
[2:34:33] are all guilty to say Lord help us to
[2:34:36] carry this
[2:34:38] yoke to carry this burden anybody with
[2:34:41] me this morning can the church say
[2:34:44] [Applause]
[2:34:46] Amen the musician get ready let me
[2:34:50] great to close out I didn't get to
[2:34:51] finish but I believe the Lord will have
[2:34:53] it that I could continue a part two to
[2:34:55] this brother
[2:34:59] Clarence your identity is the real
[2:35:02] you your identity is beyond your
[2:35:04] physical
[2:35:05] appearance if you were to go and change
[2:35:07] your face you know people do and do
[2:35:09] facial surgery and thing it doesn't
[2:35:10] change who you are you change your face
[2:35:13] but the Envy still there the lust still
[2:35:15] there the anger still there the
[2:35:17] animosity is still there the the you
[2:35:19] still there that's why I've preached
[2:35:20] many times before you could take a pig
[2:35:23] from out in the pig sty bring him into
[2:35:25] your house put a bow tie upon Him spray
[2:35:28] him down with deodorant put cologne upon
[2:35:30] him put a pig pants upon him put a nice
[2:35:33] Pig bed with air condition put him in
[2:35:35] your room and he will behave
[2:35:38] himself for as long as you keep them
[2:35:40] locked up in the house that's what
[2:35:42] legalism is because the nature hasn't
[2:35:44] changed so he's now walking around in
[2:35:46] the house he's sitting on on the table
[2:35:48] he's he's but the day you forget it door
[2:35:52] open he leave the AC he leave the the
[2:35:55] nice mat he leave the color and he dve
[2:35:57] dve straight into the mud and start to
[2:35:59] swim he say oh gosh I missed this thing
[2:36:01] boy this thing went this mud good
[2:36:03] because the nature hasn't changed but
[2:36:05] but the Bram said put a lamb and when a
[2:36:07] lamb fall in your body you know what the
[2:36:08] lamb does it bleeds it cries because he
[2:36:10] knows that's not his atmosphere his
[2:36:12] environment and I say that's how you
[2:36:14] know a son or daughter not that they
[2:36:15] don't fall but when they fall they say
[2:36:17] oh God I'm sorry oh God forgive me oh
[2:36:19] God change me not that they don't fall
[2:36:21] into the mud but the attitude in the mud
[2:36:23] is different say Lord I'm messed up
[2:36:25] again oh God help me pull me out take me
[2:36:28] out deliver me this is not me this is
[2:36:30] not who I
[2:36:33] am can the church say
[2:36:38] Amen I'll
[2:36:40] close with this last point
[2:36:46] and Hebrews 11
[2:36:55] 23 by faith
[2:36:57] Moses when he was born was hid three
[2:37:01] months of his parents because they saw
[2:37:04] he was a proper
[2:37:06] child and they were not afraid of the
[2:37:09] king's
[2:37:11] commandment verse 24 by faith Moses when
[2:37:15] he was come to years and this is the
[2:37:18] scripture I want to get to you at with
[2:37:20] respect your identity he
[2:37:22] refused to be called the son of
[2:37:25] Pharaoh's
[2:37:26] daughter choosing rather to suffer
[2:37:30] Affliction with the people of God than
[2:37:33] to ensure to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[2:37:37] for a season in other words Moses made a
[2:37:41] choice and his revelation of his
[2:37:45] identity brought him to a spot that he
[2:37:48] refused to be called he said don't call
[2:37:50] me
[2:37:51] that that's not who I am That's Not My
[2:37:55] Name he chose the Bible said choosing
[2:37:58] rather to suffer Affliction with the
[2:38:00] people of God Moses had a choice he
[2:38:03] could have say I'm not answering that
[2:38:04] call he could have been like
[2:38:06] Jonah but he made a choice to suffer the
[2:38:09] Affliction than to enjoy the pleasures
[2:38:12] of sin for a season Young Brother young
[2:38:14] sister mother father the pleasures of
[2:38:17] sin is for a season and after that
[2:38:20] season is
[2:38:22] death I want to encourage you to refuse
[2:38:26] to be called the son of Hero's daughter
[2:38:28] refuse the identity the world wants to
[2:38:31] put on you refuse the identity of this
[2:38:35] Modern Life and this Modern influencer
[2:38:37] Age where people are being influenced by
[2:38:39] all kinds of things but not by God I
[2:38:42] want to encourage you to accept your
[2:38:45] spiritual identity that only comes from
[2:38:47] the revealer of the word which is a
[2:38:49] Divine mystery that you are part of God
[2:38:52] predestinated before the foundation of
[2:38:54] the world to be an overcomer to be a
[2:38:57] worshipper to be a saint to be a son and
[2:38:59] daughter of God to identify in this day
[2:39:03] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[2:39:05] today and forever that the devil could
[2:39:07] get most but he cannot get all that
[2:39:09] there are Sons and Daughters of God who
[2:39:10] will refuse what the devil's offer is
[2:39:13] they will refuse the things of the world
[2:39:15] they will refuse a life of sin they will
[2:39:17] refuse a life of lost and animosity and
[2:39:20] envy and they will say Lord I want the
[2:39:23] cross I want the blood I want a change I
[2:39:26] want a transformation I want seven
[2:39:29] Living Voices I want the virtues to be
[2:39:31] expressed in my life I want to forgive I
[2:39:33] want to drop o if you have a ought this
[2:39:35] morning I want you to to drop
[2:39:38] it refuse it refuse the ought refuse The
[2:39:42] Grudge refuse the life of sin refuse the
[2:39:45] animosity refuse your past refuse your
[2:39:48] mistakes that's not who I
[2:39:51] am when Jacob wrestled with the angel he
[2:39:55] say what is your
[2:39:57] name and when you over came he say your
[2:39:59] name will no longer be called Jacob
[2:40:01] it'll be called Israel that was a
[2:40:03] personal experience but the PO anybody
[2:40:06] who met him after that encounter was
[2:40:08] going to call him Jacob because that's
[2:40:10] what they knew his name to be and he had
[2:40:12] to say that's not my
[2:40:14] name my name is no longer Jacob call me
[2:40:18] Israel call me Israel the man you used
[2:40:21] to know that's not me anymore don't call
[2:40:23] me Jacob I don't know who you're talking
[2:40:25] about anymore because I'm a change man I
[2:40:27] met the angel of the Lord I met the
[2:40:29] pillar of fire I had an experience and
[2:40:32] Moses had an experience enough to say
[2:40:34] don't call me pharoh's daughter don't
[2:40:36] call me Jacob don't call me Saul I'm now
[2:40:38] Paul don't call me Simon I'm now Peter
[2:40:40] don't call me Sarah I'm now Sarah don't
[2:40:42] call me Abraham I'm now
[2:40:45] Abraham because I've gone through a
[2:40:47] change the old man is dead and a new man
[2:40:50] is now alive and that man is called the
[2:40:52] Holy Ghost and he's birthing something
