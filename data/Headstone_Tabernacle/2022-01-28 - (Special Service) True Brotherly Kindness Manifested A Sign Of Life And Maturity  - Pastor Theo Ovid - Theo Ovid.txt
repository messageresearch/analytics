service i pray that you would inspire word to our hearts may the word truly become flesh but the bible becomes a fresh book a new book where we see clearly the vision of god granted father in jesus might ask it amen and amen but god bless you and welcome welcome thanks for taking the time off to be here with us tonight i certainly appreciate um the bible study on tuesday about dealing with conflict i think that if god would help us and to get to deal with things not just like preaching and teaching and so on but the practical part of life about isaac will often see we would see things present in life and godliness and um we want to continue on a certain vein tonight um and i trust it will help you and you know in this hustle and bustle of life sometimes we we're just speeding we're just pissing on the road not taking time to observe to look to read to read again to listen again and when we begin to listen and slow down we see things a bit different we have to and it reminds me of life in your youth you operate with peace and as you get older you find it's not that you can't do peace and push but you find yourself being thrown down so you get slow down your whole beat and rhythm make it things through a lot of things and that is why i think he was asked what age you would like to be and it's something like in late 70s or whatever it is because your past really you can pass through so much of an experience you would be a learned person by them an experienced person right there you would have your regrets you would have your failures you would have your fears and all what you have been through but you were able to look back at life and see you know where you could have done better where you didn't do your best but as we are here tonight we are here to share um i have some stuff i can read but i don't know what god will do tonight i'm open and i trust them that you get the help because that's what we come here for tonight you know to get help help from god all of us so i want to kind of connect a bit with what isaac said because when he was preaching about conflict i couldn't help but think about this scripture from genesis to thing and i'll just read it out to you before we go into our thing tonight and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the salt and abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold and he went on his journey from the south he went to bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between battle and high unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and abram called the name of the lord on the name of the lord another also which went with abraham had flocks and hoods and tents and the land hit us was not able to bear them not because they were small they they had a lot also had abra with abram had flocks and hoods and tents so there was big movement and big multiplication and growth on on these two sides of this family here lot labor the land was not able to be at them vi that they may dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was a strife between the herdsmen of abraham's cattle and the hood men of lot's cattle and the canaanites and the paris i dwelt down in the land and iran said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my his men and i heard them for we be brethren but isaac was talking about being a peacemaker and wanted peace and bible speaks about as much as possible live peacefully with all men both of these guys are rich both of these guys are qualified do they do both of these guys have more than they could you know manage and haven't surrounded and and because of that that greatness and have issues among their herdsmen and look at abram's attitude ibrahim said let there be no strife i pray between me and thee between my husband and that husband for we be brethren it's not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou will take the left hand i will go to the right if they'll depart to the right i will go to the left so he was very open he wasn't saying god called me you know and remember you talk alone and remember remember because i'm blessed you are blessed remember you had it had to stay in the back yeah you had to take a sight no abraham wasn't in that beat it was in that zone he says the whole land separate yourself lest you take left right right you're right it's up to you lot so you put the choice over the lot lot lifted up his eyes the senses is all activated now and beheld the plane of jordan it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed solomon gomorrah this verse is so well written it's just a class act in writing so he says it all over was well watered everywhere and he had insert now before the lord destroyed some gamora even at the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest resort then lord choose him or the plane of jordan allah during the east and they separated themselves the one from the other abraham dwell iran of canaan blood dwell in the cities of the plain pictures tend towards some but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly another interjection and the law answered unto abraham after the blood was separated from him lift up now thy eyes and look from the place where thou art not with and southward and eastward and westward for all the land wish taught see us today will i give it until i see it forever and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise walk through the land in the length of it and the breath of it for i will give it unto thee and abraham removed his tent and came and went in the flame of mambury which is in hebrew and built the an altar unto the lord it remains then with all the money and wealth with all that he had he chose after god spoke to him to build an altar the bill of altar and offer prayers and praise to god and this is how we have to become things so connected that you have your own altar altering your heart to give praise and thanks to god in the good times in the bad times you are grateful you are thankful so tonight i have a thought and i'll just put a title here true broadly kindness manifested a sign of life and maturity i want to revisit broadly kindness tonight i want to revisit this terminology this thing called broadly kindness and i want to read two portions of scripture from mark 11 22-26 and ephesians 4 36-32 if you have your bibles you want to read it so this is where we get going tonight uh mark 11 verse 22 to 26 and ephesians 4 30-32 reading from verse 22 of mark 11. and jesus answered says unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall see unto this mountain be thou removed and be outcast into the sea i shall not doubt in his heart which i believe that those things which he it shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he's he's here so what he gives here is like the two prophets then he say how to get to dear we go down to step number two therefore is unto you what things so ever you desire when you pray this is the way now believe that you receive them and you shall have them so that's the second ladder of the wrong of the ladder then jesus is drilling down further when you stand praying so in other words uh you have to get to speak the word but before you can speak the word you have to pray now how do you pray when you stand praying forgive if you have an ought against any reason that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses and we want to read ephesians 4 30 from in the scripture and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all marriage and be kind one to another tender hearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake had forgiven you let's pray again heavenly father i pray that your presence would come now upon your word and upon your people right where they are visit them lord with inspiration with revelation with this illness granted father and jesus might ask it email me this here ephesians 4 50 was from i want to read this in the amplified and it says here and do not grieve the holy spirit of god do not offend or vex or sadden him by whom you were sealed marked branded as god's own secured for the day of redemption of final deliverance through christ from evil and the consequences of sin here we go let all business and indignation and wrath passion rage by temple now bear in mind he's not talking to sinners here he's not talking to wooly people here he's speaking to the church he's speaking to lies he's speaking to families he speak until hearts little bitterness and indignation and wrath passion rage bad temper and resentment anger animosity and quarrelling brawling clamor contention and slander evil speaking abusive or blasphemous language be banished from you with all malice that is spite ill will or business of any kind and become useful one and helpful too kind to one another tenderhearted compassionate understanding loving-hearted forgiving one another readily and freely as god in christ forgive you and that's the key right there as god in christ forgive you now when they asked jesus the teachers to pray and he began to say our father and heaven will be thy name and he went through that and even praise give us his holy bread and then he brought that part on top there and forgive us of our sins this is christ now teaching the disciples to pray as we forgive those who trespass against us and they come back to what isaac was sharing and teaching on tuesday that conflict is part of life anguish disappointment hurt uh upsets people do you wrong and i was thinking because one or two people point out something that i spoke when i talk about tips and so on life things depends in life and godliness about communication something struck some of the people on communication and i would just like to do something on that it is a deep topic actually communication is a study all by itself people actually get a degree in communication they go and study and get qualified in this thing called communication and i was thinking about it you know sometimes we think communication is talk and you know sometimes i just put it in a flat way which is not really very light the way i might present it um from where the studied people were presented from like i guess i would say communication is when what you speak has reached the person in the same way that you meant it and sent it and but what i recognize now though is that we have how to see it it's almost like if words is like encoded words have to be decoded and everybody have their own encoder inside and it's almost as if we could be hearing the same thing but processing it differently and it's mind-boggling that it's even even possible and what came to my mind is the story of uh being described about the eagle and the chicken how an eagerly an egg and among some chickens and the egg was hatched and the ego was different from the rest of chickens of course and then the great mother eagle passed by and scream out and that eagle recognized that that being that fly over him or something like him and he finally looking just like him and the mother said come on you could fly you could do it and it was a comparison of eagle and chicken and of course we know the story the eagle jump in the barnyard and fly will fly off and so on and somebody heard that story and one person said my i am an eagle and the next person said my that man called me a chicken no it was the same story but whatever is in your system processes it a certain way so like the scripture i actually have it to the pure all things are pure but if there are issues on the inside let's say you're negative then you would be hearing the negative part and you'll be taking something off of that instead of trying to get to the positive part so it really it really takes the holy ghost it really takes a holy ghost to translate that is where we really need divine revelation we need to really hear from god and in sessions like these where things are more caught than taught you have to have an inner ear to listen and to hear what you can learn but you can benefit from them but you can draw from them you know i like as i say when i go to do marital counselling or with a couple or whatever it is i like to carry what i call a toolbox and i would hear the complaints or hear the issues and challenges and said okay let's see if we could look in the toolbox and get some tools and we have a toolbox the two boxes of the bible and that bible have different things that we can look at and go into and um so this one here on broadly kindness forgive us because we have sins we have failures we have short comments we do mistakes we say things we're not supposed to say and we act a certain way we ourselves you yourself would need god's pardon unforgiveness because remember because you are born in sin shape iniquity we are we have a let us say a default world mode a default sin mode a default unbelief mode if i could use that terminology that is why the bible talks about putting you on your lord jesus it's not just well you're waiting for the court to fall on you there are things you have to do in terms of an effort you have to have an intent to change there's some people they love themselves like the story of the woman she husband died when he died he said she said he did and he couldn't change me you know and she's proud of that and she was unchangeable and she will pay the penalty of that kind of attitude and wage of course but the thing of it is all of us like i can say i was a hot tempered person i was a 50 person and over the years i learned to wait i learned to be patient i grew into patience i could wait a long time for things i'm not history or anything and i remember in my early christian experience um coming from a catholic background and um after a while i was going in the wrong direction not even knowing i was going in the wrong direction i love the lord i went to church i'm i believe bible the read scriptures but when my parents and family talk to me and tell me anything it's like i don't have to bother with them because they they don't know what i know they don't understand what i understand and one day my sister told me you are so hard like nobody can get to you and then it hit me that this is not the right direction and i said to her sorry please forgive me and she was in shock and i was in shock that she was in shock and i would never forget that experience she was in shock she said i never knew you could see that and sometimes i'm wondering how hard it is to say i'm sorry forgive me how hard is this to see you know i was wrong i thought wrong i acted wrong i was wrong about this forgive me i'm sorry i had the wrong thoughts about you and but this to me i see it as something almost impossible for somebody to go through a christian walk on christian life without being able to express those words i remember a service i was a young christian wasn't minister just a normal believer and the pastor came and preached and he was speaking against another minister and i just came in and i just taken what he's seen not knowing he's putting seeds against another brother and i find myself disliking not having anything to do with that minister brother and so on like that and afterwards i recognize but this can't be right i don't even know the brother he doesn't i i why would i why would i think so but you see words are powerful and seeds are powerful words we speak to our children words we speak to ourselves words we speak to others words are seeds because a long story short i don't know why i'm introduction this during the testimony but that same brother that i had an issue with without a cause if i could use those words eventually he actually became my pastor i actually had to go to him and repent of course because that's what we have to do when things are not as it's supposed to be we supposed to say sorry i was wrong i shouldn't have done that and i didn't even have a clue that he one day would be even my pastor but that is how life is i'll just say that with you that this thing called forgiveness it is real and um you have to experience god's pardon to get a grasp of how god wants you to pardon others and to forgive others if you yourself never had an experience and i use the word experience of god pardoning grace i don't know how you would be un to understand what it is to partners the bible give a parable you know the problem the man who was forgiven for a small stuff he was in prison and got released and then he he come like he got free for a hundred dollars and then he comes and locked my neck for ten dollars and they said buying him bring him back inside because he qualified and we have to be careful there are lots of quotes but i'm talking about you're standing over here on on one ought you're dangling over hell or against your brother the doctor begins a brother could be against your wife you could think of your husband because your children could be those in your family that embarrass you and if you feel embarrassed and hood and you more you you are more caught up in your own embarrassment than the condition of that person that you embarrass about whether it's your wife husband children family doesn't really matter remember dear sinners gesture and it's not dear sir so you can't feel guilty for their behavior at you what you have to find yourself having an anchor point is what can you do now you would find that many times i'll talk about there's no school of parent there is no school of marriage there's no school that that trains us to be a great husband not good great husband a great wife you know there's no school that does that the wife who could cook could cook cook but she has a husband the husband who lazy lazy and here but he has a wife and we go through stuff and learn stuff sometimes hard way but eventually you know it comes true and that is why um you know for this question a man leave his father mother and cleveland to his wife and this is why from whom how as parents we supposed to be we're supposed to have these children come and raise to a level of maturity that they could stand on their own this is what life is about reproducing reproducing off his kind coming to maturity and so on so this is the title of what i have tonight is true brotherly kindness manifested a sign of life and maturity what god wants us to get is the material mature but brown said something that blow my mind you talk about when you newly get married love your wife and everything and afterwards if something happens like you want to turn and finish and whatnot but as the years rolled by and as the two parties blend into one another he says they can kind of do without each other it's like you press osterize press the machine and it can't separate it anymore it's just a blending that is steel and i think time and life time produces that level of maturity now i am saying that because he went on to say when he started in the ministry anybody do something off he's like cut them off he finished and whatnot but as time ruled on so he took that parallel and bring it into his own growth as a minister in ministry as time grew on he recognized he needs the brethren and that is where we have to start who is the person next to you in front of you behind you who's the person you shake your mind abraham had every reason to pull rank unlocked he could have embarrassed lot he could have put pressure on a lot to say well you know you are loafing on my blessing or you your blessing is because of me and this court called me god spoke to me and me and i in the iron story but he didn't do that he was very very gracious extremely gracious he could have even told lot look go ahead and go so and point in where he's supposed to go and if he led blood should go that way no he didn't even do that he was the one that was elected abraham was the one that was called amen was the one that heard god's voice and yet he's the same one that said look listen if you go less i go right you go right there go listen you choose wherever you want to go and my goodness when you see now you see it is what is on the inside that choice that look picked it was based upon the encoder if i could use that word or whatever things inside of him that he could look around with his eyes and say you know what they were watered so it appeared that abraham was dealt a hard hand because he was facing more like wilderness and and please that doesn't have the water and something like that and yet when they were separated god for labor but east west north and south all his euros so now we fight for things and is is really axis of what are you fighting for what are you fighting to prove what are you heightened to accomplish because if you just take a time and pause a little bit and do what god tell you to do you would hear god say if not and salt is always yours your blessing or your inheritance is already reserved for you having jealousy and envy and malice and evil intent and i'll do this and would do that it doesn't make any sense when your your thing is reserved brotherly kindness is a big thing in god's plan and program it's a key it's on the preaching it's not as human it's not something that is highlighted much because you cannot fake it you can't fake forgiveness so so you say somebody doing something right and you say you forgive them by talking to tom dick and harry and you tell them you know i forgive her for for doing this that is not how it's supposed to be your forgiveness should come freely freely from in your heart from your mind from in your spirit hope i'm not rambling but brother branham said this now and this is a message perfect fate now fate is based on forgiveness let's stop right there what will take us to the rapture rapture in faith and faith is based on forgiveness so how could we have faith for divine healing if we have oughts grudges and that is why god will judge those pastors and ministers that are sowing evil seeds against other ministers and this to their congregation they will pay for that i can guarantee you that not for me i'm not paying my not i'm not the judge because it's god's people and um what we're supposed to show is for the kingdom of god so that is why i don't buy any pastors fight ministers fight apostle prophet preacher evangelist fight nobody's right if you are probably somebody else and we are friends i am not going to promote that person because your problem with them that is you and them that have none of me i am not a nobody fight that is politics and i refuse to be a politician i am not into politics because this wonder why you go here you have a friend with this one don't talk to this one the doctor no no no school tell your story walking everybody must have their liberty everybody will have the liberty to love to forgive to have fellowship this is what god wants this is what wants on us you see so faith is based on forgiveness now this so okay so the majority of times the emphasis is faith um your faith comes by hearing the hearing the word of god so you're pumping word fake number hearing i mean mysteries come along on the word and we gotta bomb some mysteries and you get faith but you're born in glory of the mysteries i never ordered against your brother and sister glory and halloween mysteries and wife faced that way on the bed and he has mentioned that anybody glory hello to the mysteries and white's not talking to husband with your service in the car glory hallelujah see and yet fate is based upon forgiveness no just hope are not just rambling but i always have a problem with brothers who don't treat their wives nicely and might talk to their wife however and we'll talk to other sisters other people nice and what i believe that that is that is that is nuts to me i believe charity begins at home i believe that that love have to start at the whole level love god love your wife love your family you know and i always say not as your father your mother but as christ loved the church i am not jesus christ i can't love you like jesus christ jesus might love the church i will tell you my righteousness are not churches sorry who want to make sure you're right that is the business i am not into that i don't preach that i don't teach i believe clearly but i'll make a pointed reference you know the wife husband choice like the rights of the past and so on men take that and take that overboard and make a big old seed and watching with that they'll be people stunned it's like they want to get rid of the husband they have and they can't move can they marry to him but i don't see me bible god didn't teach that i am not into that i have one wife her name is anne marie that i'm still in love with so christ god wants you to love him this is what it's about love for god so when you begin to exercise just being affectionate being kind you have to start somewhere because some some of us have some temper spasms not right here someone's then you know baron says sweeten your temper with prayer it's not like you can't have them bible say let your son go now you let his son go in a rut not that you won't get angry and something that you're really i mean it just took pay off but is how do you manage the internal conflict and the external conflict and if you have the internal right you could handle the external so much better so really and truly it is coming along to our own self so fate is based upon forgiveness and then you know what he said as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostle times moving among us that is what we all hunger it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it we want it to flow and it will be a hell to us to flow out to others so could you imagine but a brahmana speech in perfect field he slips in there a key this key is forgiveness very simple and he says no we want to have apostate times we want it that it could flow to others what the flu to others this quality of faith that is based on forgiveness so faith really is a key this brotherly kindness is what will mashup satan's kingdom of jealousy and hate the commitment to love the brethren um i try to second there's going to be a united defeat because i have to believe what god said there is no unity of churches there is no unity of ministries there will be a unity of defeat there will be a ministry of affection which is the fifo ministry minister of jesus christ that will be in unity because the broadband said they'll be backing one of them up not cutting one another down it means that these brethren will not be insecure because part of cutting others tongue it shows up your insecurity because sometimes people believe by breaking down somebody they are putting themselves up if you have the assurance of the lord in your heart there's no need to break anybody's down because in the world today there will be always people greater than yourself and lesser than yourself just like the bible talk about great servants and small citizens the major prophets and minor prophets in life there'll be always people don't forget that now greater better stronger wiser have more money whatever it is than you and they're all people have less than you have shoes some people have none some people have tons of shoes you see what i'm saying now so when you accept your state in life not that you have to stay where you are then you let others live without being jealous without being envious without being hateful and you have to know that nobody could take what god has ordained for you and you can't really take somebody's blessing i've seen over the years people try to out this one light and you know even my own personal experience which i wouldn't talk about and i see it as all failed because they missed god's plan they miss that what god has blessed no mango kids they missed the thing what god has blessed no man could curse you see so when there are those who thought i was finished do you finish i was just laughing so you're done i have a revelation of my sonship early um i used to get really battles as a christian if i'm cold i want to read investigates but boy i had a fight i believed that did everything want to tell me i'm a discipline all kind of torture bang my mind and one day i got a revelation of my country and the devil never brought that back to my mind again at all so i was liberated from any negativity about my calling and god and everything else and that freed me so therefore whatever has sealed me over the years has been put in this way i have used as wind so i could fly [Laughter] i used it as wings that i could soar when people thought i would sit down i stood up and people thought i was keep silent i spoke when people thought i would disappear i made myself very present and um as completely opposite to the grain of my whole and sometimes that's what fate does fate does make you do things and operate in a way that is not even natural to you and that is how you know it's the lord and i challenge you tonight to step up step up step up from a church membership step up from you know uh just hearing you want to be able to apply you want to be able to that it could flow through you so this key the verb i'm dropping in perfect fit here is powerful because this is the thing they're going to you know break up the the walls and the partitions that the enemy has put there there's a scripture you have to find it i just want to in hebrews 12 and it says here looking to follow peace with all men and holiness without wish no man shall see the lord looking diligently least any man feel of the grace of god please here we go any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled least there be any fornicator or profane person as etho who for one muscle of meat sold his boot right for you know that afterwards when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears let's take a peek of that in the amplified strive to live in peace with everybody pursue that consecration and holiness without which no one will ever see the lord exercise foresight here we go and be on the watch to look after one another oh my my pause here you know how god loves when we have a genuine interest in one another to look out for one another you might not know what the system might be going through my brother you pick up your phone and say how you doing i began to talk and you don't know how that just slide right in but they help that person and you don't know it's god love god's grace upon your life to encourage somebody and try to lift them up these are age where people tend okay so in this age the default is to criticize that is the default position so you see somebody of challenges and instead of trying to reach out to help you talk about that person with somebody and then you have a supporter there and that's how click does that you know you see what you're doing you see how you're moving you see this you see this and i am challenging tonight to get rid of all those things see each other as two brethren even people not in our group on our church are not in our ministry they are brethren regardless of what they think and they feel that's how you should see them there are people that are striving for the kingdom striving to make it in striving to get it right nobody's trying to go to hell him everybody's striving to make it you know and like us thinking that as we get older the challenge is sickness the challenges is the creaks and the cracks and the different pains and and tiredness and weariness the young man he personally figured you know he young fellow i was like that you know you tried 21 forever is that changing the data change until it didn't change so much are they black and grey so the point about it is this we have to have a care one for love we don't have to wait to refuse all to do that but we could start now we could start when we pray sometimes you know there's a lot of prayers why you don't want a person to prove these are the proof of people you can run out of premiums you could tarry there and really pray and ask god to help this sister hey brother look at this one here you know different struggles and so on like that different health issues different challenges that we may not even give away the medium come forward and see it but we could really begin to pray them through or praise the lord so yeah let's exercise foresight and be on the watch to look after one another to see that no one falls back from and fails to secure god's grace is a merited fever and spiritual blessing in order in order that no root of resentment ranker bitterness or hatred hatred shoots forth and causes trouble and bitter torment and many become contaminated and defiled by it i have seen believers get defiled and contaminated i have seen people who want used to love want use the care turn bitter and angry they go to other churches of course and they are seen down they wherever they are but in reality they intercept because they haven't cleared up the business in their spirit and their souls in their heart they can't react in love they don't even want to shake your hand they will cross the street they want a doctor and they are seeing somebody in some other group some other church that is not the christian work that this prophet brought us he brought us into true discipleship to follow after jesus to follow his word okay so let's continue here now that no one become guilty of sexual advice and become a proofing godless and fake religious business he's did who sold his birthright for a single meal for you understand that later on when he wanted to regain title to his inheritance of the blessing he was rejected disqualified and set aside for he could find no opportunity to repair by repentance what he had done no chance to recall the choice he had made although he sorted carefully with bitter tears just a few the bad answer this year now there's so much in the day we live in patented gifts so many people judge people by this what they have i believe that these are gifts i believe that what we see take place is gifts they are god-given gifts but that's a butt coming you know if we do not use them in the right way that god intended them to be used then we can do more harm with the gifts than we could if we didn't have the gifts and that applied to gifts in in the church and ministerial gifts let me say it again good if it is not used in the correct way harm than good is done false doctrine and false teaching kills let me say that again it's not a matter of just force doctrine is a spirit behind false doctrine it's a spirit of error and and behind the right teaching is the spirit of truth and the spirit of truth will produce the fruit of that spirit long suffering meekness gentleness humility it will it will produce it because it's the spirit of truth and just as a spirit of truth there's a spirit of error okay so let's continue now brother brown if we do not use them in the right way that god intended them to be used then we do more harm with the gifts than we would if we do not have the gifts the other night i made a statement on the pulpit saying this i would rather see broadly love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of healing or anything else see we must know what these things are for why would the prophet say that he had a gift of healing he know the burden of people with cancer and what kind of conditions at that time and yet he could see he rather see broadly love why would he do that why didn't he say a water we have a lot of divine gifts our healing gifts no that is what they had at that time or roberts the whole pentecostal field was laden with gifts tommy hicks and all kind of people out there praying for these sick and different kind of things like that but he talked about this thing called brotherly kindness but about come with it love the world is dying today for love christians today we have got fines called literatures wonderful buildings but we got weak pulpits yes from the wrong the congregation don't feel to one another like they used to there is something missing the word is look into that christians what we need today is a baptism of love for one another this will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another so we can see clearly the mysteries the tear plane all this word word word hasn't done it it will take something more than that so the tape playing of the word you preaching the mysteries all these mighty gifts if it doesn't lead us into this love divine or divine love or this experience that we could express god love as god loves us we can express that to others it's not going to happen it's not going to make it because told him his wife that died and went on before it take perfect love to enter here so some way along the line we have to connect back to this to this main vein so then when you get into corinthians do i speak with a tongue feminine angels do i have give my body to be burned do i have all knowledge one no all mysteries two including new name seven thunders fires woes all mysteries and have this thing called l-o-v-e which will express itself to the brethren i am not nothing nothing okay let's continue so he said now what we need today is a baptism of love for one another this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have love for the other now no matter okay escape that is where the church is at that's what the matter they have lost their broadly love they have lost the feeling for one another they are so much mockery people say i'm a christian i believe in the value but act different he said but brother i rather give you a little correction now than when i come to the judgment you say brother branham i'm so glad you've done it it's too late then what we need is love and respect for god and for his people listen no matter what they belong to this is the part i am not talking about love for god and love for the people in person i am not talking that jesus busted his own disciples you know he accepted righteousness exceed that describing pharisees he said god they love one another he told them he has a lot better than that you love more than that you know so try to say you know like people say that they're the best church we are the best minister we have the best pastor and the lady bishop in tongue and you have all the mysteries and you have all your word you have all these singers you have all required you have all the music you have everything we are it that is when you're not it how when you know the gods they're off anytime you're somebody say they're it and this is it here you run now you can do it don't don't stop no that's right keep running because you have to have determined to know that can't and won't be it the bible gives a template of what it looks like in this kingdom jesus said peter come paul this one come james come what not tax collect everybody come they didn't choose each other because if we were given to choose the other who would we choose family and our friends people like us people that who we harmonize with we say come graduate but what jesus did he call them from different walks of life and call them together and say you are my disciples and you have not chosen me i have chosen you so when they look at each other [Music] is who jesus chose yes he even chose judas [Laughter] did you know he choose to do that joshua selected him he chose him no it was us i know jesus wanted to to to even let him come to him come to that door but not jesus but you just have to do what jesus do but jesus do what jesus do we can't stop the crooks trunks cooks and not for coming to church understand this let me say testament good teal ovid canister cooks cranks crazies crazy house or you want to call them from coming to the church i could stall them a little bit like one time again a pulpit sister walking to the church right after service i walk in the in the room and me was there me like a relationship just walking into it i'd smell them i could sense them i still look look one walking interesting i never talked to her because i'm a sinner i could tell her well two to form after what she stomp out or kind of a real character let us pick it up over the years so much power to us we we know we're sensitive to them that way they don't touch them you know that's it i don't drag it nobody i don't press the lights i don't pull it because i know rashford no this has been my my thing so that's why braham says you cannot say this this is a holy church he said the holy ghost can be preached in it but in there you'll find good bad indifferent he said the holy ghost is ported on individual childhood individuals in your house say individuals so you could tabernacle the holy ghost not the church as a group and the vigilance is that in uh sister shepard's dream and that's famous means the messenger poured his water and the water was the worst and no church could have hold the word the water leaked out but then the messenger went and get a big bucket of what honey and honey was what brotherly kindness and he poured that he said it will hold this so the church can hold broadly love it's not something that we cannot get it's not something that we cannot get connected with we can it needs to be revisited this thing called bloody love okay so what he says now what we need is love and respect for god and for his people no matter what they belong to the denomination oh i know i keep interrupting because trying to finish the school by clarence and keep erupting because i couldn't share my own experience and i tell you i had a good portion of watch in my heart and a solid a solid big portion and here's why because i felt that the ministers and trainers didn't give me a fair chance they condemned me because i'm actually in new york all i must watch with people all overseas but they would they would do like if we from hell you know and i find it was really nonsensical and nobody would invite or fellowship with anything like that and i had that and well you know my testimony 1981 uh i saw a vision and a sheep drop down in a prayer meeting in cairo and i saw the second coming of the law and i went to find out where that message was at and whether mr program preached and when i went through that message so i went to that message by vision i'm gonna begin to preach from it and i begin to say when the church finds his brother love and whatnot and you know when i will testimony burly khan is broke and the strangest thing about it when it broke i said god forgive me of my sins why can't i forgive you of yours and that just freed me and all the different things that was in my system just disappeared and then the spirit poured out and since that time i knew by revelation we have access to that holy spirit sword so that is why the anointed atmosphere that's why i believe it's in the church you see because we have partaken of this revelation but we want a manifestation of this thing called broadly love you see and that to me will be a great sign of spiritual maturity that god could trust you to love the brethren trust you to handle others right for example when the two people came making love in the church but ram was preaching and he begged them he said stop it and they carrying on the kissing one and i said god that's not right and whatnot and then the holy spirit dropped down and said whatever you say will happen to them they say blind they'll go blind you say that they will die you know all the options there he choose none of that he said i forgive you and when he said i forgive you the holy spirit portal which was pleased because he said he'd done things that was wrong he said this is where you get conscious of your how to say it of your mortality of god's redeeming love for you of course lucy towards your life and as god extended to you you feel comfortable and very free to extend it to others you know in a pure reason in a genuine sensory that you could extend this thing to others this this this what god has accepted to you oh my lord not all right so no matter what they belong to denomination we will say the groups were churches fellowships as long as they are brothers they are brothers we need a love for one another and love will contact when nothing else will do now all right so let's get down now sorry all right here this one is a big one you remember in the blasphemous name he said honey looked like a one stick but it did stick it with stick all right now if pentecost was god's vine which was the new vine that was grown up when these four destroyers had sent it to vinyl let's find out what pentacles had and find out what we are got lacking the first thing that pentecost produced was bradley love now he's talking about pentecost the first thing that pentecost produced was bloody love it tore down the middle wall of partitions and made a brotherhood to such a way that they had everything in common in bible days a brotherhood they sold their stuff everybody had food shelter clothing the bible said they had everything in common that is what it produces what produces that pentecost what is that dynamics what is that the holy ghost what is that the power of god what is that lovee this is what it will produce but ivan says the first sign of the holy ghost is humanity the first thing he said you could talk i could talk to somebody in five minutes and know if they have to worry how much mysteries a man could talk in five minutes it's not your words it's not what in your head is what spirit is in your heart at the end of it all we have to be magnetized to the headstone to go in the rapture i keep saying it's not really you in that sense when the rapture is the spirit inside of you and your body wrapped around that that taking you with it too when the big magnet come and you're you are magnetized you have to go so that's why i keep saying the rapture is not outside in his insider you're looking for the rapture i would say you rapture had been saudi enoch mechanics became dynamics and god took him so if we can't get this right we don't have an opportunity to go you know friends we have known to be tribulation things i am not joining earlier i don't want to be any part of the tribulation states you know people trouble you know when then men have problems in their life and marriage something let's go and drink and they like to drink one another and clung their glasses and so on i don't want to be with tribulation scenes crying glasses but we miss it why because you hate somebody because you can't drop your arch and whatnot in your busy the hoop is so bad and they hurt you and you're hurting you all the expression they hurt you and you know you people just talk about other people so much and they can't see themselves it's like to blindly oneself blind to you and weakness could you laugh at yourself is that people who can't laugh at themselves you know they're so stiff they can't laugh at this and say when you could laugh at yourself man that is so good that is so healthy you make a relative a goof maker you could laugh at yourself you could be true to yourself you could be true to others see so to me this is what it's all about okay let me just wrap up here this boom so the first thing they produced on pentecost was bubbles right paul spoke of this brotherhood and he gave all the gifts of pentecostal church and then said in 1st corinthians 13 do i speak with tongues of men and angels and have not this love which brings the brotherhood this is by the brand now this is 20th century prophet viewering and putting a a a microscope on this thing do i speak with tons of men and angels i have not this love which brings the brotherhood i am nothing and do i have knowledge to understand all the mysteries of god i am still nothing without love the love of the brethren so show me a mighty man whether in trinidad the west indies usa europe africa or south america show me one mighty man with his mighty revelation with the love of the brethren i'm not about his own behavior love of the brethren have a burden that the people that the believers that lives emanate others brother branagh this word reading again this one i don't think i've ever read this quote before though i speak with tongues of men and angels and have not this love which brings the brotherhood i am nothing and do i have knowledge to understand all the mysteries of god i am still nothing without love the love of the brethren and jesus said this shall all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one for the other pentecost had that i am speaking pentecost meaning the first group of the apostles so he's not talking about 1906 okay and they had that bloody love here we go they wasn't greedy they sold everything they had for the furthering of the church they were so together until even when one heard the other one died they said let us go and die with him such a feeling now jesus spoke of this paul says let very love continue and you're only preparing this tonight i was talking about thinking about the scriptures let brothers continue i say but you can't continue if it's not even there you could only let one love continue if it hadn't if there was no very love it didn't continue no way how did it start so before we hit that scripture so are you reading the scripture let by love continue no we're just like well get my love going and when by love going then you could actually talk about continuing afterwards right now in the pentecostage of the day comparing the two if you notice the routine of the gifts the first of the gift is wisdom thank you the first is the gift of wisdom that is the best gift of the group and if you don't have wisdom you won't know how to use knowledge that is the second gift and if we can't use the second gift without wisdom how are we going to use the last gift interpretation or the next the last speaking in tongues our zealous eat up our wisdom our zeal for our denomination our enthusiasm has eaten up the wisdom of of divine bloodly love but this is what my mystical i will restore okay that's where he said let's take an example if a man don't believe the same as i do i'll go right into this coronation and preach with him just preach what he believes go right ahead and let it go because i love it right there fruits you know that if they don't believe it they haven't got brotherly love they drop out disagree fall away i have nothing to do with it why don't you come to me and talk to me about it you don't know what i believe see what difference does it make anyhow what i believe it is who i believe jesus christ i have never left a meeting yet with bad teeth as i know wolf but you see broadly love has all wheels has listen just a moment i would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with christ i'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operated in the church now that my son had in a pentecostal group but i would rather have it where there is gifts they would feel when there's gifts they'll bring confusion whatever is gift they can be questioned but there is where there is love it's perfect that's right if you have perfect love you'll have perfect gifts that's right so work first with love that brings fellowship and fellowship brings gifts work with love that brings fellowship fellowship brings gifts if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we would confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and if we see it all the words see it then through the blood of jesus we are fellowship one with another so the blood is connected to fellowship and the blood is connected to love so evidence of blood applied is expressed by the fellowship that we have with the brethren if there is no fellowship well you know i think the kangaroo moaning worm that was anointed and commissioned to already eat down the fruits of the tree and the first treat that womb beside the head because brotherly love you know eat it because after you hit bloody love as the fruit you hit the leaves of fellowship and barramundi the fellowship is he clapping his hands it turns out atmosphere you want to get good shade so then when that fruit eat away no residue and sit down stiff no clap no praise no worship you saw the devil wicked you see all the fighting worship and fighting is the devil and was lucifer himself you know hiding behind what mysteries hidden and more hidden than hidden and work on the mysteries and they find to you over always beaten ministries yeah i've beaten the intellectual part of this message i have to beat it because this has been binding people from the reality of the experience of christ so here we have the word with perfect vindication and whatnot so nice very intellectual i went brown forget the gun by defense and passenger killer bull he says something came over him wasn't that thought was not mystery wasn't some knowledge is something he said i wish it happened all the time it was an experience go give the lord a shout of feeling good now i'm free to jump onto this chair right now hallelujah praise god now i see we have to come to a spot where we could speak language the language that the bull understood wasn't violence plagues mystery seven thunder seven seals it wasn't nothing about the pope about rome dr fausti or imaginations it was nothing about that the language people understood was the language of love and this have to come back but ram didn't fake it he had it that's why he could speak to the bull and said go and lie down let's see if we could wrap up this thing oh blessed be love and tonight i hope this is a refined to you so here we go again first work with love love brings fellowship and fellowship brings gift oh my yes i'm gonna conclusive oh yes lord he's talking about a pregnant woman he said did you notice around the mother seems a sweet feeling what is it it's a spiritual body spiritual life waiting to come into that little body as soon as this is born now it's only begotten or when it is born it is born now on wednesday night service in the preaching and that was the perfection of the saints if you haven't heard it go back and listen to that listen to it once twice three times it's an important message it's solid stuff inside of there baron was talking about sanctification the baby's begotten and he's comparing that to word on top of word on top of a word in you when the baby comes through which is water then blood life another spirit life grabs that baby and that's gonna be born okay so the muscles quivering and jumping on the inside under sanctification is not the birth even though there are experiences on the inside but that is still begotten when it comes true it is born okay so now tonight we want to go a little further a little deeper he's talking about the atmosphere around the mother before delivery what kind of atmosphere is around the mother before that delivery so here we go hear what he's saying here now he says now you notice you can take a woman if she is so full or evil or wicked or whatever but when she's become mother a little while before the baby is born there's a kindness about the woman get around her there's always something more tender why there's an angel spirit waiting to receive the natural body and as soon as it is born the bread of life comes into it and god breathes it in there and it becomes a living soul now just as this baby is being born there's a spiritual ability to receive so he's going down something like that oh my praise peter jesus we're almost through here my lord so why did you say that brotherly kindness is a sign of life because the woman about to produce this baby means that she comes a full term a full nine months she is the baby is ready it's mature and evidence of that that the mother is about to give birth is this sweet spirit that comes around and i want to identify this sweet spirit as the spirit of brotherly kindness before the birth of the manifestation of charity the love of god so if you see and you see that kind of lion and i've seen a kind of kanga and a wolf you know the baby are far off the baby was being born yet and you start running it it didn't know eight months six months it wasn't started but i'm saying that once the woman is heavy with child at some point in time that gives a signal of life a sign of life a sign of maturity that a bird is beginning to have why are you saying all this tonight but over because i would know not just you walking into church and and seeing amen but how your life is being changed and that spirit atmosphere of sweetness coming around you is a sure sign to us that a recreate seven thunder holy ghost pride revival is about to break because that sweetness of drastic kindness is around you just how fusion are we gonna close here for the brother i think i'm going to wrap up with this here all right he's talking about 60 there's some stratography man the bible says add in broadly kindness now that's a good one here all right when we get to that burly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter what to do before you criticize before you complete before you find fault with your brother put yourself in this place put yourself in that sister's place if it was me i wasn't going to do this it was me you know i hope but as i was saying and i know that's so true when somebody started talking to school and whatnot and somebody come and say you taking that my wife was next door to me when this he was preaching and i said were you taking that that was so you know this was the thing to hype you up you taking that put yourself on in your brother's place on the better and you could feel for your brother and you see i'll tell you something it's very hard to be angry and say evil to what somebody that you pray for is very hard it's very hard to be bitter to what somebody that you really sincerely pray for and love and in concern you can't do that and that is where we have to grow a little more this seemed a lot okay that pictures tend to watch sort of end up inside we know the story i'm not going to go down here but the point i want to bring is this when god reveal the mysteries and unveil the seals to abraham and show him destruction is next to sodom abraham then say yeah god my nephew don david think no that was a lot of attitude you see lot wasn't religious religious spirits don't care about the family they care about their conviction and what is seeing and what the catching and the revelation their care but they found i'm going to go to hell they just pray they don't care the spirit abraham stood there and said lord there's 50 righteous what is he doing he's interceding because lot is down there that's the spirit of christ that's the love that he had lot abraham had dynamic dynamics he had an experience he had a supernatural encounter he had that and you could see it reflected moses god determined god moses so god so angry go tell moses move aside i will kill them what they say before i kill them kill me but i'm saying the spirit of christ standing in the camp there people were miserable enough it was troubling it wasn't easy and yet he stood for them i'm going to close broadly like probably kindness he says no my brother sinned against me said peter shall i forgive him he said seven times a day he says empty time said burnley kindness if a brother is allowed to tune don't don't be impatient with him see be kind to him go anyhow somebody said not long ago how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the assemblies of god the oneness all the rest then see he's talking his own experience now see well the kindness open someday patient with him temporal enjoined with him knowledge to understand what he believes meekness with him having faith that someday god will bring him in broadly kindness the seventh thing and closing are close to me conclusion prayer from the second coming of the lord this is the message that i got inspiration from 1981 talk about the woman lost a coin there was nobody ringing those times with a banner on her head every coin represent different things one of those points was barely love she lost it she said she had a husband time she scrubbed the floors she swept the walls she took it on the cobwebs she kept on so she found that she had lost and when she did she called her little sister churches to come now and that's the way the prophecy came in i don't care if you're a methodist but this pentecostal presbyterian come let us rejoice together when that time come prophecy it says prophecy when the church finds his brotherly love when the church finds his holy decency when the church finds its place in christ it will call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us god wants the church to love him god bless you and thank you tonight for being such a a fine audience as bowers heavenly father i thank you lord for revisiting this land of berlin this inspiration this revelation of godly kindness and i pray god that it will be something special to your people here tonight and those that would hear this message and hear this special service father god may they check them themselves check their own hearts to see if they're in the feet load if this is what it's all about burnley kindness the blood of the age bloody crime is the age we're living in burial as a key a key to unlock the open skies of the holy spirit father god you said wait till then seven thunders out to the voices of that group that can really take the word and hand it to you oh god how you warned a prophet a test laid for you i challenge his head of you and lord he said i forgive you to the people making love and then to the to bind a mamba the snake wasn't affecting him it was a second other brethren and you said to told the prophet to be more sincere help us tonight lord and give us that depth of sincerity that you require oh god we are needy people tonight forgive us or sins or fears or past and bless our future father sanctified this bunch here tonight sanified the church the people that they can be so prepared for our great mighty breath of the holy spirit and all porn of the love of god we thank you for the brethren i pray bless the service oh god coming up on sunday may you inspire the service lord and pour out your riches blessing upon your people become idealized unto you in jesus name we ask it amen god bless you as church god bless your saints i appreciate you i love you and thank you so much for being here tonight have a good night god bless
