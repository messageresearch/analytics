to see the mind of God and I want to preach on the uh our holy convocation on the eth day may God help us that we can break the word amen let's stand and turn our scriptures first of all to the Book of Leviticus 12: 1-3 acts 7 6-8 and then we'll read Revelations 23 I want to put some scriptures to get about four of them short ones and then we will pray levius 121-3 the Lord spoke to Moses saying speak to the people of Israel saying if a woman conceives and bear a male child she shall be ceremonially unclean seven days as at the time of her ministration she shall be unclean on the Eighth Day the Flesh of his forkin shall be circumcised amen acts 7 6-8 and God spoke on this wise that his seed should sojurn in a string land and that they should bring them into bondage and ENT treat them evil 400 years and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge says God and after that shall they come forth and save me in this place and he gave him the Covenant of circumcision and so Abraham beg Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day Isaac beg got Jacob Jacob he got a 12 patries finally Leviticus 23 35 and 36 on the first day shall be a holy convocation you shall do no civil work therein 7 days you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord God on the Eighth Day shall be an holy convocation unto you you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord it is a solemn assembly you shall do no civil work therein shall we bow our heads we pray Lord your Prophet taught us that when the Holy Spirit comes into a man's life we cease from our work because now we are taking your rest may you come as we have met may your promise word in this hour in this age living our lives so true Lord many of your children have come with needs may you Lord reveal and touch them those who need healing may you touch them those who have come Lord in a special way but you open our eyes of understanding that we get closer to you Lord I pray this hour father you bless the local Pastor here the ministers who have traveled far to be here those who have traveled from overseas to be here Lord from Africa and the United States Lord and different parts of the world to be here may you bless each and every one of them from the United Kingdom I pray for your blessings upon the lives of your children that Lord by the time we live here your anointing and your grace will rest upon us in Jesus Christ's name we pray with Thanksgiving amen amen our final scripture before you sit Revelations 81 but Norris was hitting on that one as well to some people uh we should never read Revelations 81 because to them yeah it's a closed book still oh my but according to our Bible and our scripture when he had closed the seven no sir no sir that's good you reading with me then that's very nice so when they had opened the seventh sealah there was silence in heaven about a space of half an hour Glu we see the church now this Gathering here is not a political event this Gathering here is not a gathering of a soccer game this Gathering here all is not a sport event it is a convocation amen amen and one of the definitions of a convocation means that it's a summoned assembly yes sir it's called a holy convocation as commanded in the Mosaic law amen and these convocations had special days that they were held yes sir and it requires a gathering of God's people in fact some translators also call it a holy convocation or a sacred assembly now we know that any gathering without a true revelation of who Jesus Christ is is a bunch of drunkers who are meeting because whever two or three are gathered the Gathering must be God's provided place where he has chosen and the place must have his name at the [Applause] Gat praise the name of the Lord there are many churches many organizations some of them claim the worshiping God yeah but to them it might be an intellectual God it could be the god of science but we meet at the name of Jesus Christ because that is the revelation of God's name given to what so once we have gathered two or three in his name this is a solemn assembly hallelujah amen amen it's a gathering yes sir of Sons and Daughters of God Amen for one purpose just to come and worship the Lord in spirit and in truth and God plays special attention to this convocation yes sir that it must be done on the first day and the eighth day amen amen as a matter of fact the first day is the Eighth Day yes sir and the eighth day is the first day amen meaning when we get to the point of our life that we know what God has done for us we move from time to Eternity and as we are seated here today we may live in time but we are Eternal beings praise the name of the Lord now there was a reason why the Lord was giving these Feast to Israel in which they have to do these observations now Israel as a nation met in certain of these days we as God's children must have our scriptures under which we come to meet the Lord amen if if if if we don't do that in the context of God's word then we are out of context but we need to be in God's program so the first time that the number eight was given was when God after Walking With Our Father Abraham for years when he was close to about 99 years old in Genesis 17 yes sir amen the Lord appeared to him and God began to tell him that he's going to bless him and give him a son Hallelujah Abraham let let's go to Genesis 17 for a second Church how many love the Lord thank you Brothers amen watch this and when Abraham was 90 n was 90 years old and N or 99 years the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect amen and I will make my Covenant between me and Thee I will multiply thee exceedingly yes and Abraham fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shall be a father of many nations am neither shall thy name anymore be call Abraham but the name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee and I make thee exceedingly fruitful I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of thee and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee sir and thy seed after thee in their generations for an Everlasting Covenant Amen to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after theee all Abraham's seed will worship the god of Abraham amen I will give unto thee andto thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God yes and God said unto Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generation amen and this is my Covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and ye shall circumcise the Flesh of your forkin and it shall be a token of the Covenant between me and you and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child your generation he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must on these be circumcised and my Covenant shall be in your flesh for Everlasting Covenant look at verse 14 and the uncircumcised Man Child whose flesh of his forkin is not circumcised that Soul shall be cut off from his people he has broken my Covenant and God said unto him Abraham as for sarahah thy wife thou shall not call her name Sarah but Sarah shall be her name and I'll bless her and give the a son also of her I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings of people shall be of her amen then Abraham fell upon his face watch this and laughed said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is 100 years old and shall Sarah that is 90 years old bear and Abraham said unto God oh that ishma might live before thee and God said Sarah thy wife shall be the a son indeed and thou shall call his name Isaac and I will establish my Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant and with his seed after so just let's enjoy these blessings a little bit yeah so here is the father of our faith the men that was seven Idols who never knew that there was any God hallu the god of his father Tara was to make Idols of stones and wood and brass and so in fact Abraham was an idol salesman right that's right that's right if I want to put in the plain language he was selling C and all kinds of Idols to people but even in that state he was a seed of God for 75 years he could not find his way but God reach him Mercy reached down to Abraham and pull him out of idol worshiping and many of us Church Hallelujah have gone on maybe 30 years maybe 40 years maybe 50 years maybe 20 years but God reach him Mercy reach out wherever you are and God pulled you out of the condition am from the god of Idols to a living God it wasn't Abraham looking for God it was God who appear to him it wasn't us looking for God it was God looking for you you are here today because God came looking for you God was hunting wherever you are it's all by [Applause] [Music] Grace Hallelujah and when God now started with him he been walking God told him I'm going to bless you and give you a child they've been waiting for you Years brother they been waiting for years until he's 99 years Sarah is 89 years and God now comes and says that you walk before me become perfect I will EST my Covenant with you I'm going to bless you with a child I'm going to bless you with a son Hallelujah then Abraham laughed that's right can a 100 year old man have a child and Sarah 90y old that was what he was saying but praise the name of the Lord he also knew the Bible now the Bible said Abraham never started you know why when he laughed God just said my son I will prove to you that I am God so God did not take whatever he did into consideration because his Covenant with him can never be an Hallelujah and many at high church we do stupid things we do crazy things and many a time God just have to because you are his son look over it so that his promise will come through you now this Covenant is going to give him amen where the Covenant of circumcision Hallelujah before Isaac was born God has already told him that I'm going to give you something to give your Generations what I'm going to bless you will extend to the generations of your children the sign I'm going to give you is going to be the sign of circumcision and every M child must be circumcised if you are not you're not part of me it said if there a stranger that come to your home if you bought with money they come to your home they must all have this sign of circumcision therefore if an Egyptian is in Abraham's house like Eleazar of Damascus was in elzar's house remember he was of Damascus and we were born in the house of Abraham so the man was circumcised which means there's one thing that when you have to common common to everybody is circumcision if you're in Abraham's house you might be circumcised just like he is you must be and when you come to the message it doesn't matter where you are you must have the Holy Ghost now when God use the word there'll be no Civ work or C work translating says that Civ mean there be no partiality there be no discrimination you cannot give a partial judgment you cannot prefer one upon the other and the only thing that bring us all together and make us one is the holy spirit so let's enjoy the 8 day now eight is not numbered with the regular days because we only have seven days in a week and God is giving numbers now in the Bible we don't have things like Tuesday Monday Wednesday Thursday these are Roman names right are you with me and the month of August and July and and June are all Roman names that's right but we use them and it's good we use them we still have to use them but when God is using his numbers God goes from the seventh he goes to the eighth and because there's no more number after seven you got to bring eight to be number one so eight start again meaning that eight is actually back to the [Applause] beginning Hallelujah and brothers and sisters in the beginning God did certain things in the beginning he was a creative voice calling his children or the seed that should be wherever they were that they must come into manifestation amen and so when we are talking about the eth day we are talking about God bringing his word into manifestation in his [Applause] people we're going to read some uh uh scriptures just to give us some uh uh uh anointing you know for for us to uh get get a word of God going now remember that the Lord Jesus Christ according to the scriptures was raised on the eth day or the first day of the week amen and because he was the first fruit that rose up he Jesus became the wave sheath amen amen so the wave sheep is time of the Resurrection which mean the resurrection of Jesus took place on the Eighth Day hallelujah amen and every child of God who is seated here must also be raised as Christ was [Applause] raised you who were dead in sin and trespasses you has he quickened amen brothers and sisters when you have the Holy Ghost you are quickened when you have the Holy Ghost you are an eternal [Applause] being now from the web sheath God told Israel to count seven sabbaths until p Pentecost which will be the 50th yes so the prophet of the age came back and told us that seven sabbaths is actually seven Church ages that's right right I want to take my time here now church it's seven Church ages yes sir now in those Church ages the prophet taught us that Jesus was in the office of the Son of God right amen It Go are you with me church and according to Leviticus as you read when a male son is born he stays with the mother for seven days am but on the eighth day amen hallelujah the mother has to bring the child into the temple for circumcision amen so he moves from the matter from the seventh to the eth by circumcision Hallelujah but God is saying is that through the seven Church ages it was the Church of Ephesus it was the Church of smina it was a church of pagamos it was a church of Tia it was a church of sadis Church of Philadelphia Church of lodia but we got to move and get into another place where now the church belongs to God and so I want to put it blunt yeah tell us us we are not in a Son of God dispensation we are under the dispensation of the son of man that's right it means then that the ages are going on but the bride is not there God pulled us out and now we are in the bright [Applause] age and in the bright age the child is now belong to God we have left organizations brothers and sisters we are the Lamb's wife we belong to him he is our everything let me put it another [Applause] way when Jesus rose he walked on the earth for 40 days now his first two pools healing and discernment was a public show that's right all right he healed all man of sickness all man of diseases he raised all man of [Applause] dead but brother when he rose from the dead come on come on but Jesus never went back to the public he never healed one person in the public he never went in 40 days time he never went to caas he never went about to anybody out there he said but what are you trying to say the ministry of the res Resurrection was to open the understanding of God's children so who was he working on two brothers come on who never understood when he told them that destroy the temple and I'll raise it up it pass over their head when he told them that as Jonah was in the belly of the whale you know the Jonah said it was a fish special fish Jesus said the fish was a whale that's right then people get confused like you don't understand when make a statement here he said he been a mistake yeah come on well if a wh is not a fish Jesus said the wh is a fish amen so what John was experiencing in his day he was experiencing because Jesus will come someday to reference that that's right for his resurrection you know the word Resurrection is not in the Old Testament it's not there you can't find it one place there not one way Resurrection there but when Jesus came he used it and he us it in types that's right he used it in types yeah as Jonah was in the belly of the a COR of GRA fall to the ground it Abid alone destroy this Temple I'll raise it up so is the rapture it is not in the Bible stated Rapture but God has seen it in the word Enoch Was raptured Elijah was raptured Jesus was raptured and we shall be raptured yeah you know there are some people if they don't see the word rapture in the Bible they don't believe it so if they don't see seven Thunders they don't want to believe it but brother Thunders is the word come on Amen are you with me amen all right so the uh sisters came early morning to the seara with embalming fluid yes yes they were coming to to keep Jesus in the grave so that he he will never resurrect and if Jesus remains in the grave we are finished Paul said if Jesus did not rise from the grave we are all miserable men he said but because he rose we shall also rise glory be to God Amen Hallelujah so our sisters never had the true Revelation you think the sisters did not have it what about Peter in fact one place he went a fishing he was even naked in the sea Hallelujah and then two brother were going to ouse then they were just talking on the road they felt so miserable that Jesus is dead they've killed him a man doing so good is dead and Jesus appeared to them in their ignorance walking with them haven't you heard what has happened how the high priest have killed the people while they were going you know Jesus just the Bible say it says you Fo slow to understand all that the prophets have told you brothers and sisters in fact Jesus is trying to say that just don't be dull amen all the time you got to sharpen your Revelation and he was with them talking until they invited him home still in the ignorance yeah and they brought Bread and Wine come on and when Jesus Took the bread and broke it they realized there's only one man who can break the bread like this he was the man we are talking about only him and when he realized that they saw him he disappeared at the breaking of the word they saw Jesus at the breaking of the word we see Jesus just when we see Jesus at the breaking of the word now you can worship him I think in Luke 24 45 it says that Jesus was for fulfilling all that the prophets the Psalms was was was was given right and the B said he opened their understanding that they will understand the scriptures which mean they walk with him for 3 years and a half they understood nothing and it is possible you could be in church never understand is preaching what we are preaching what we are talking about you have no clue but if God is merciful to flueless people he can be merciful to us this morning and open our eyes that we can understand [Applause] him so the circumcision of the Old Testament of the flesh is no more valuable now amen in fact Paul said circumcision is nothing now when Paul was saying that he was saying that with the understanding that we've changed dispensations from law to Grace amen now there are scriptures to compound Revelation anti typ to typ and there are many things fulfilled in the New Testament that the Old Testament will never be able to pass through for instance in the Old Testament if you're a left-handed man you can't be a priest yeah hello I said if you're a left-handed man you can't be a preacher if you have flat nose you are out if you have scy in your face forget about [Applause] [Music] it if you are shot out you know how many of us will be disqualified but thank God for Grace I thank God for Amazing [Applause] Grace in Leviticus 2327 Hallelujah uh God specifically told Israel that on the seventh month on the 10th day of the seventh month was to be the day of atonement it looks like Revelation 10:7 to me amen that God is bringing the word to his children in this age now when Jesus walk on there for 40 days he told the disciples the day of his Ascension Christian that you don't go out and preach don't go in your might don't go in your strength go and wait wait until you are endued with power from on high hallah brothers and sisters the Holy Ghost is power the Holy Ghost is dynamic the Holy Ghost is a talking the Holy Ghost is the fire of God the Holy Ghost is the Breath of God the Holy Ghost is the water of God the Holy Ghost is the river of God hallelujah the Holy Ghost is the Fountain of God yes when you got God's spirit inside of you there are no demons from the Catholic Church no demon for denomination no demon from hell can come to any believer fill with the Holy [Applause] Spirit and he didn't tell them when it is coming he said just go wait wait until I Endure and he said go to the upper room and wait and on his day of Ascension the Bible say about 500 people saw him go yes 500 people more than all of us here I don't we 500 but imagine 500 people see the man breaking the law of gravity and then going through yeah said go wait for me man would have said why don't we run let's all rise to the upper room but by the time they went in there 380 disappeared yes only 120 went which mean there are some people in life they are only interested in phenomenal they want to see how many more cripples will walk how many more Blind Eye will see then they will say God is in the [Applause] church I could see the public saying well since we killed Jesus we have not heard nothing from him what happened to him everybody's quiet we don't see the disciples out anymore what happened to them this 40 days Jerusalem is quiet they not blessing anybody else they not saying nothing to anybody Hallelujah and then Jesus ascended 10 more days more quieter and brothers and sisters in the silence something about to take place in the silence God is going to come down so they were there they could be singing some songs they could be saying that oh how good he was I could see Thomas saying that well I was the one who said I will never believe nothing nobody is telling me until I put my hands in his flesh and when I saw it myself now I know it was in the upper room now and then the women were there too in the upper room because there'll be no Civ no partiality all the putting women at the back side of the church is no more they are now in the upper room Mary was there Mary was there salom was there with the apostles they were there Hallelujah and then the first day second day Third Day fourth this time they have patience nobody's rushing anybody because the master said wait I don't want to go in my own power wait I don't want to do my own strength wait wait wait wait and brother they were waiting for the promise of their day and of all of a sudden there was a mighty Russian wind that FW all house and clothing TS like fire filed 120 in the upper room brothers and sisters they were so filled with power power that they could not contain them in the room the power brought them out people say hey the the church have been quiet for 5050 days what happened today you know what Peter said Peter said today you were not with me to see the experience of the pill of fire what I'm going to tell you today is that Hallelujah Jo's prophecy has been fulfilled in our lives they were rejoicing because of the prophecy of Jo taking place in their lives and brothers we are rejoicing today because there a promise in Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 being fulfilled and taking place in our lives today now so on the 50th day Hallelujah is also called the day of Pentecost that's right amen Pentecost means 50 yes sir it also means Jubilee yes sir which means the disciples are going to be free free from fire see or sad to see and see L are you with me they going to be free from all these discouraging demonic f Spirits because they going to have a jubilee Pentecost Jubilee yes sir setle free there's no Civ work no discrimination God is Raising fishermen God is Raising people who were not from the tribe of Levy not to establish his kingdom he's moving from the Mosaic law now to the Grace and Truth by Jesus Christ [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah now if if Jubilee and Pentecost means you are free am but explained this way he says it's like the slave master has you know occupied your land because you owe him debt and he's farming on your land and in fact you can't pay him so he actually took as a slave to farm for him because you owe him de there's two ways to free you either a king Redeemer accounts or you find some way to open your ear to hear the trumpet sound on the day of Jubilee am so on the day of Jubilee by God's law yeah every land you have if you give it away because you could not pay you owe some debt that land is never supposed to to to to to disappear permanently amen it only has a temporal hold not permanent no sickness no disease nothing against you is permanent everything is temporal your problem are temporal your deaths are temporal your sickness is temporal Hallelujah one day you got to tell them all off brother brother says that when you hear a trumpet sound said that just walk out straight yourself and go to that Master and tell yes uh did you hear that trumpet yes sir I want you now to get out of my [Applause] land he goes he says uh yesterday you couldn't talk to me like that yeah yesterday was yesterday today is another day I said get out of my land and church we are here to tell the devil get out of our land maybe you are saying brother John I got some headache the devil plag upon me yeah why don't you tell him now take your sickness back devil today I'm free now again on that day of Jubilee is a day of restoration sir where the man is restored back to the family back to his possession yes back to what belongs to him that went out temporary it was his first but he lost it he's coming back to what he lost and we are going back where we came from but but this is the truth the Jubilee trumpet sounded on the eighth day amen it sounded on the morrow after the Sabbath yes sir not on the Sabbath the morrow after the Sabbath which means the Holy Ghost fell on Pentecost on Jubilee on the eighth day it brought Freedom it brought Liberty it brought God's Own possession in their own [Applause] lives hallu so I'm going to give a quote here if you can put a slide on on uh number 28 on the future home but Bram says that but you see there is no such a thing as eight days you go back to the first day again see the first day now the Sabbath speaks of the Old Law which was to pass away the keeping of a Sabbath which was pass away all I have said said changed to another yeah it didn't pass away but it changed from Old Law of keeping a certain day of the week amen and now they're getting into God's rest yes sir you enter into life not keeping a day or Shadow right that's right Paul said in Hebrews the 4th you keep days and shadows and things like that I'm scared of your experience we don't pass in to certain days and orders you pass from Death onto eternal life not days and times you pass into eternity that is the holy convocation amen glory 7 days what which pass away all I have said will change to another 8 Days deals with New Creation not old creation eight his new creation amen hallelujah and so Jesus when he rose brothers and sisters it was a new beginning for many of us to have faith in the resurrection am and because he rose now listen to me carefully Church each and every one of us right now is rising with him now for it was on the eighth day that our Lord raised from the dead yes sir there is other convocation the Holiness not conc the Sabbath at all or the Feast of the Tabernacles or the Feast of Pentecost Jesus raised from the dead for our justification on the eth day amen after seven Sabbath or seven Church ages Jesus raised from the dead amen eight which is a holy convocation which is the first day see you done had passed through time and dropped into eternity again not keeping of days and keeping of sabbaths and new moons and things like that but have pass change your form not anal Glory but pass from Death onto life eternal what the bible teach us pass from one to another I like that church yeah God has changed you from what you well to what you [Music] [Applause] are eternity is like a ring you cannot find no corners you can't find no stopping place in the perfect circle amen I don't care how far you go you are still going you can't start going around like this and go through through far on the earth and go beyond the Earth you are still therefore what I'm saying is that when you have the Holy Spirit nothing can stop you from serving God how can you come this far and say I stop worshiping [Applause] God there is your holy convocation not having anything to do with the literal things is beyond that is into the kingdom of God with eternal life amen with a predestinated that never did starts it never started on any day you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved Jesus just came to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with let's enjoy the one more what carefully see eight cannot be counted with a week you can't do it because there only seven days in the week count it anywhere you want Sunday the first day of the week see you count seven you go back again and start over the prophet is bringing something here and we live through these types here but when you hit e you go into eternity you don't come by laws and rituals and orders you come by predestination there is a genuine holy convocation and we are ending the seven Church age the Pentecostal Church age yes sir do you see it we are entering into that Holy convocation we are entering into that really General eternity where the church is called not to some station some denomination but into eternity with the Eternal King we don't have it at all no such thing as days and times your pass into it ity where you come from you was there to begin with if you got eternal life there's only one form that is God and you are an expressed attribute if you are not you are not going to be there no one can come to me except my father trust him amen all these old things but these don't see it speaks of Eternity the Holy Ghost is eternal you are in eternity where you was all the time you just recognize what happened you were made for an eternal purpose the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that that thought of you and express you and he made an earth took you out to make you a human being sin come along and perverted his way Hallelujah you come [Music] anyhow but you were lost with the world so he come and redeem you the express attributes and also redeem this Earth by the same way his purpose rolls on oh Hallelujah that that is so good think of what just LS ahead one it's a Cher coming I love it in Ephesians 1:10 if you putting it down it is called not the dispensation of the seven days called the fullness of time yes and when the fullness of time has come that's when time has been fulfilled when there's no more time that you go into eternity amen after the seventh Church age is over and it is Hall Luther's age is over meod age is over Pentecostal age is over now you go into what eternity no more sens no more threes no more there are in eternity where there's those set as numbers and times and things you see it now oh after time has been fulfilled all sin is gone taken away at the mum at the white Throne judgment a type A type by the Holy Ghost amen after the Wonder and fire and baptized is baptism with fire and all sin is gone all gem is gone all devil is gone all temptation is gone all evil is gone what does God do he cannot sit upon the Earth sea and watch this do the same thing he does when he gives you the Holy Ghost baptism he can come and dwell with you we can sit in Heavenly places in Christ because we are already in him not we will be we are now sitting in Christ Jesus how do we get into it by one Holy Ghost baptism by one Spirit we are all baptized into Christ which we are now won't be in Christ we are he is the great spiritual King over the spirit that is in us because we are all in him at the beginning [Applause] how many love [Applause] him now I want to bring two characters that were there on the eth day when Jesus came for circumcision Hallelujah let's take Luke chapter 2 and ver 21 and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcision of the child his name was called Jesus which was so named of the Angel before he was conceived in the womb how many know that your names were in the land book of life before your father knew your [Applause] mother G my father called me John my name on the book may not be that the prophet say your name on the book is not like on manev your name on the book is a mystery when the mystery of the age is unfolded and You by Revelation catch a glimpse of it God is calling you by your Revelation by your name and when the days of a purification according to the Lord Moses were accomplished they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord as it is written in the law as I read every male that open the womb Shall be Called holy to the Lord and to offer a sacrifice according to that which he said into the law a pair of turtle do watch and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon Hallelujah and the same man man was just and devout amen waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he has seen the Lord Christ and brother it have been revealed by the holy ghost that we shall not all die he came by the spirit yes sir into the temple on the eth day when Jesus had be circumcised on the eth day and when the parents brought a child to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him upon his arms and blessed God and said Lord now let thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for my eyes have seen thy salvation Hallelujah but I want to stop it for a second this is an old man a sage led by the spirit blind there could be many kids that day getting circumcised yeah but when he had Jesus on something came upon him and he began to bless God I said now I can go in peace for my eyes oh yes brother the eye was not a physical eye it was not a 2020 Vision it was the eye the eye to see God and as you are seated today God has opened your eyes that you can see God you can see the revelation of who Jesus Christ is my eyes have seen thy salvation so salvation is not a thing salvation is not a myth amen salvation is a person the person of Jesus Christ with thou Hast prepared before the face of all people now what this verse 32 a light to lighten the Gentiles amen Simeon was prophesying of you and me coming to receive the [Applause] light Jesus is the light of the world and the word made flesh in your day is the light of the day I know some people want to be Jews you can please yourself but I'm so happy that I am counted in the promise of God as a gentile and the glory of thy People Israel and Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him and Simeon blessed them said unto Mary his mother behold what this this child is set for the fall and Rise Again of many in Israel amen and for a sign which shall be spoken against a sword shall pierce through your own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed amen s was telling Mary Joseph says this child is set for the rise of many and the fall of many the message of the hour has also come for the rise of many and the fall of [Applause] many you know brother Bram was told he went to God one time when people were trying to make him God and all kind of things that would be and he said I'm going to close church and I'm not going to preach again I'm going to sit down somewhere and then and the Lord say said you try that if you try that you'll be a bomb like your brother-in-law yeah the prophet look said what when he look at where God had blessed him with and because of accusations from people you're going to stop if you stop it you that have indicated the message I'll make you a bomb now this is to tell every everybody else and I'm not I'm not I'm not curing or saying anything but I'm telling you that you live this blessed word you become a [Applause] BM watch all those pastors that God gave them Ministries who walk away from the message thinking they going to raise some big churches what has happened to them they become scrap keeps yeah bumps on the but I know better I'm going to stay with [Applause] this so simeon's eyes though physically were blind Simon praise God Amen he said Lord according to your word you may now dismiss your servant in peace my eyes have seen your salvation Simeon was also saying already the promise that was made to Isaiah All Flesh will see the glory of the Lord amen John the Baptist came in the desert to Proclaim All Flesh will see God's salvation amen now Simeon s God's salvation was not a metaphor he was actually seeing the salvation of God in every concr sense Jesus means uh savior or sin God or Jesus is himself the salvation of God [Applause] hallelujah Simeon proclaimed our well with Jo let me ask if a blind old man Hallelujah led by the Spirit come into church with joy what make you come to jch joyless why are you coming to church not glad when David said I was glad when they said un to me let's go to the house of the Lord the joy of the Lord is my strength we are strengthened this afternoon with the joy of God in you oh sometimes some old people can Rejoice better than we young people Sister Miriam Moses senior sister when he saw Israel cross the Red Sea and saw all the Egyptians dead she to the tambourine and began to praise God oh 90 something year old lady worshiping God and began to dance began to praise God hey sometimes we got to worship we got to praise [Applause] God brother religious Authority may seem gentle loving until when they contradicted when the religious authorities thought that Jesus Christ was revealing their hearts Amen brother they became hosti to kill him and any time that the God's word is been revealed trouble hat people that's right what Simeon saw that day was that Jesus was himself the word of God who had come to us people were seeing a baby but Simeon saw God Simeon had some inherent superpower that made it stand out from everyone else he saw God in Jesus because the spirit of God gave him eyes to do so but when God wants us to see his salvation he will nobody can stop you from seeing [Applause] God and there was another lady called Anna Anna means or Hana the grace of favor she's identified as the daughter of penuel now penel means the face of God his name may be in plain words since Anna was among the first to recognize the face of God when she saw the Infant Jesus hallelujah [Applause] amen in other words when you see the face of God it bring Grace and when we saw the face of God in the cloud it brought grace to the church because the head son is descending with a shoutings of Grace Grace Grace you know when Joshua was crossing Jericho the message he gave the final message after 6 months on the seventh one it said just give a shout just give a shout just give a shout just give a shout and BR they shouted and the W of Jericho fell we see now the headstone is coming down with a shout of Grace the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout oh CH Shout Shout Shout Shout you got to PR Shout say hallelujah To His holy name blessed be the name of the Lord the message is the truth amen give him praise Give Him Glory Hallelujah [Applause] give God a praise you can't stop the [Applause] bride now let's come to our promise now Revelations 81 when the seventh seal was open I want all those outside there who do not believe that all seven cies was open according to my Bible since you want us to say what the Bible said the Bible says the seven seed was [Applause] open and because I am not a prophet God's word come to a prophet amen only a prophet can interpret am a scripture like this so brother Bram says in the message uh the Feast of trumpet paragraph 264 I want to say one more thing closely now don't miss this how striking from the seven angels that's messenger of the seven seal message in Revelation 10 that's right was the seven seal Amen in other words the SE is chapter 8 The Happening is chapter 10 amen yes sir the reason why there's a silence in heaven it because there's an activity taking place in chapter 10 amen yes am God is the object of worship and as long as God out there there cannot be silenced the angels are worshiping the sist are worshiping the CH are worshiping everything is worshiping God there cannot be silence when God is there he deserve praise if he's not there it means the object of worship has moved where was he coming to chapter 10 he's coming down with an open book Hallelujah you know he sat he sat for s ages never Rose he sat making ignorance for the people yeah interceding for their ignorance but Revelation 10 he no more sitting he rose descending coming down with a book in his hands and this book according to our Prophet is hallelujah the title deed of redemption he said Adam had it and Adam forfeited it and Jesus came by means of death and purchased the price and took the book it left Adam's hands went to the original owner Jesus by means of death take the book it left Adam went to God now the lamb had it now he's coming down with the book in his hands looking for the people who the book belongs to and Revelation 10 let's go to Revelation 10:8 [Applause] this is good and the voice which I heard from Heaven spoke unto me again and said go and take the little book which is closed which is open in the hand of the Angel We Stand upon the sea and upon the Earth no no no no watch it carefully Church yeah yeah yeah yeah the Angel come on is standing with one leg on the sea one leg on the land and we know there are two spirits that came from the sea and land yes sir yes sir one is Rome the other one is eism coming out of America he got his two feet sitting on their heads with an open book which means that every nation will be deceived but a bride cannot be deceived let's continue this is good and I went on it say we upon the upon the sea upon and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the book John was not afraid to take the book or to ask the angel to give him the book because the season and the hour has come for John to take the book blessed be the name of the Lord Brother said sisters but brother said one man John represents the entire bride John represented you you already have a representation and your representation took the book so in reality we have to take the book now let's look at it give me a book Hallelujah and he said unto me take it it right brother John asked for it the angel said take it now with the instructions watch it come on take it and eat it up it shall make th belly bitter it shall be in th mouth sweet as honey instructions take it it take the book so the book left Adam's hands yes went to the hands of the original owner yes came into the hands of the Lamb yes now it's no more in the hands of Adam no more in the hands of the original owner no more in the hands of the lamb in fact it's no more in the hands of the Lion now it is in the hands of John separ what are you saying the revelation of the seals the Lamb's Book of Life is now in the of God's manifested sons and daughters on the [Applause] earth what John he said to be sweet and Peter and I took the little book out of the Angel's hands and ate it up brother John took it and he ate it how do you eat a book come on because see the problem in eating was an eating problem and we got to fix it by eating so we add the tree of knowledge to bring the problem we are eating the Tree of Life [Music] joh said when he ate it it was actually sweet in his mouth amen when you came to the message you thought everybody was an angel you thought you go to a people where nobody will say nothing about you that every brother is sweet every sister is nice which of course it is but I'm also here to tell you that your bitterness and your trials will come around ranks of your own so when somebody is trying to make you bitter refuse it but let him understand that this word is sweet in my mouth and we must all go to trials let me repeat I wish I can tell you that uh brother John you know God love you so much that you will never have trials right come on Trials are the only way to bring the you out one time somebody was talking to a brother he said that uh you are very very fortunate if not for God because God has changed me you actually seen what I've done to you God have mercy right we don't want to go back there so you can never show longsuffering until somebody make you suffer long you claiming her patience how do you deal with your wife and your husband and brotherly kindness is not a [Music] phrase charity is not a phrase you can only show these things with a character inside of [Applause] you you know so sometime when you say Lord give me patience God said that you need more trials because only trials can break through patience and let me put it this way before I go onto my next one before I close character is not a [Music] gift character is a victory we don't have anything called gift of patience that's right and gift of longsuffering there's nothing like that amen amen oh this is is called patience called Grace it doesn't mean that because of their Nam they are not veryy name but sometimes sister patience and sister Grace can really make you understand that you have to see the grace of God in your life amen with me Church am so John to the book John at the book yes sir and he was told by the angel Amen to prophesy to the Masons Kindred and tongue because in the Holy convocation there's no civil work yes sir God by the message of the hour has broken the barriers of discrimination racism this is not a black man's gospel it's not a brown man's gospel it's not a white man's gospel this is God's word God's spirit moving we don't know anybody by the flesh who is a Jew but one with the spirit brother when you are in Abraham's house whether you are bought to the price whether you are servant in his home you must be circumcised if you are in the message get the Holy Ghost Hallelujah get the word of yahwah how many love him hour that we are living in church us we

eighth day are you with me the Pentecostal uh anointing fell on the day of Pentecost the 50th day is the tomorrow after the Sabbath on the e8th day the trumpet of Jubilee must sound on the eighth [Music] day and God has pulled himself out of the church yes he is standing outside the church he was walking in the midst of the church before he's no more in the church God organizations is over he's not standing outside and if you want to meet him you cannot meet him in denomination you got to come out and that's why we have taken the book but I'll read Revelation chapter 4 and we close with
