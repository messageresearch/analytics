[13:48] i see you looking wonder strong you know
[13:50] struggling on your struggle i know
[13:51] you're struggling
[13:52] supposed to be struggling because you
[13:55] are jacob
[13:56] they're going to come to perfection your
[13:58] worms are going to be turned into a
[13:59] butterfly
[14:00] you're not a butterfly yet you're worm
[14:03] you're struggling up and down you don't
[14:04] know but that don't mean you're not
[14:06] gonna make it
[14:07] that difference a liar this morning not
[14:09] because you're struggling you're not
[14:10] gonna make it
[14:12] not because in your mind probably not
[14:13] gonna make it not because
[14:17] you're not gonna make it you're gonna
[14:19] make it
[14:31] feel the spirit inside of here please
[14:33] jesus christ just please
[14:35] um praise god just tell my wife and say
[14:38] no i
[14:39] love progress i love to see people
[14:42] achieve i love people to want to change
[14:48] i hate people who don't like challenges
[14:52] there's some people praying praying
[14:53] praying pray oh god and they can't
[14:55] follow instructions when they come out
[14:57] of the prayer
[14:58] and god bring a word for them they can't
[14:59] follow that but they pray oh jesus
[15:01] jesus said i'm coming to help you i'm
[15:03] sending a word for you i want the word
[15:05] come for you i can't do that
[15:06] i don't want to do that you we sing your
[15:08] prayers
[15:09] you say your own prayers locking up your
[15:11] blessing because all you've got to do is
[15:13] to obey
[15:14] and follow what god wants to give you
[15:16] that's all you got to do
[15:18] hallelujah you could paul you could
[15:20] scream you get nothing
[15:21] if after you come out of that you cannot
[15:23] follow simple
[15:24] instructions because the word come to
[15:27] give instructions and guidance
[15:29] and many times it's contrary to what you
[15:31] think what you feel
[15:32] how you feel is going to be like god
[15:34] love to raise the pressure
[15:36] [Applause]
[15:38] we can say some things here i can drop
[15:40] it on you i'm going to drop it on you
[15:42] but if i say when the press come now and
[15:45] the coaching or the press have to press
[15:47] half the breath
[15:48] have to press half the press they don't
[15:51] want to say amenities
[15:52] because they're hearing about the press
[15:55] not depressed
[15:58] when the press come down so therefore
[16:01] the press is very important in your life
[16:03] you don't even know how much that's
[16:04] important in life you leave people as
[16:06] they are in the comfort zone they do
[16:08] nothing
[16:08] they stay right there they are safe you
[16:10] see right now
[16:11] the budget is on one price the oil
[16:13] change and what not that is
[16:14] circumstances that train that cannot
[16:16] control
[16:16] the world cannot control that is
[16:18] external circumstances
[16:20] and that's what's gonna happen if love
[16:21] doesn't get you desperate external
[16:23] circumstances

[20:52] [Music]
[20:52] [Applause]
[20:56] so jacob was caught alone angel came to
[21:00] him
[21:01] and jacob saw the way out he had to get
[21:04] rid of everything
[21:05] including the family circle to be alone
[21:07] with god
[21:08] all this comfort around him is gone now
[21:10] stripped how many are you feeling

[21:17] you're not stripped yet
[21:18] yet yet but you're coming everybody got
[21:19] to be stripped and and then when jacob
[21:22] felt all alone and
[21:23] and the angels started to wrestle with
[21:25] an angel he said i will not let you go
[21:27] till you bless me
[21:28] oh glory to god and god tested him on
[21:30] his own words
[21:31] it was a big fight going on with the pup
[21:33] realm jacob wrestling with the angel
[21:36] locking the angel neck rustling rolling
[21:38] down all
[21:39] night long it wasn't a five-minute
[21:42] wrestle it wasn't a 10 minute wrestle
[21:44] it was all night long until the end
[21:47] let me go let me go you're looking a
[21:49] little desperate let me go
[21:51] you look like you really want to be
[21:52] changed let me go because i'm not
[21:55] letting you go
[21:56] and you say let me go he said no come on
[21:58] see him
[21:59] that's what we're talking about
[22:03] [Music]
[22:05] you see and some of us not fed up enough
[22:06] we're not tired enough we're not wearing
[22:08] enough
[22:08] we're not moving off for transformation
[22:10] they're moving enough to be so desperate
[22:12] and say lord
[22:13] i'm not going to let you go till you
[22:14] change me i want to walk out here
[22:16] different and i came inside of here
[22:22] hallelujah and we know what happened the
[22:24] angel touched him
[22:26] and immediately he walked differently
[22:29] he couldn't walk with that proud
[22:30] arrogant look he woke humble
[22:32] he walked with a limp not that that was
[22:35] something caused
[22:36] that it changed it
[22:40] changed his walk and then god changed
[22:43] his name
[22:44] [Music]
[22:45] he didn't have the same name so if you
[22:48] have a new name and you have the same
[22:49] life something
[22:49] wrong gotta check back that name because
[22:51] when his life was changed his name was
[22:53] changed come on see him at somebody you
[22:55] can't have a name and your diaper
[22:58] change glory to god a changed life you

[32:13] is restoration of all things that's my
[32:14] title this morning restoration of all
[32:16] things
[32:17] and my inspiration is back to the bible
[32:20] back to the word and i'm dead serious on
[32:23] that one because you have to go back to
[32:24] the bible
[32:25] you have to read the scriptures you have
[32:27] to get back in the bible you see this
[32:29] book is sealed
[32:30] and what the prophet came to do was to
[32:31] unseal it that we could know what is it
[32:34] a lot of people can say what i'm saying
[32:36] but they don't know what the bible say
[32:37] so they can't tie it back into the bible
[32:40] but we have to be able to take the
[32:41] scriptures
[32:42] and tie back into what god said here
[32:44] then it becomes alive
[32:45] then it becomes quicken then it becomes
[32:48] scripture i think brother george tell me
[32:50] that brother branham said
[32:51] jesus believe a drunk man it was that
[32:54] brother george
[32:56] but jesus believe a backseat and
[32:58] preacher who he's talking about david
[33:01] david said i i shall not see my suffer
[33:03] my holy one to seek corruption
[33:05] or see leave a soul in hell david said
[33:07] that i'm calling
[33:10] and jesus believed that word because
[33:12] that word was god
[33:14] forget that brexit and preacher forget
[33:16] that
[33:17] but when that man moving the spirit and
[33:20] spoke by your spirit
[33:21] that was not the man come on get lord
[33:25] come on now come on now when the spirit
[33:28] of god came
[33:29] upon that man you cannot touch what's
[33:32] coming out out here
[33:34] when that voice of god rose out
[33:40] hallelujah okay
[33:43] praise god bro praise god
[33:46] but abandon said no doubt march of the
[33:48] lamb
[33:49] your lovely pastor's approach the
[33:51] subject many times and i know that
[33:53] there's going to be a bride
[33:55] and that there's going to be a wedding
[33:56] supper silver in the sky just as sure as
[33:58] god is because it's his word
[34:00] and we know that those that are going to
[34:01] make up the bride is going to be his
[34:03] church
[34:04] and they're going to appear before him
[34:06] without spot or wrinkle
[34:08] and they're going to have listen watch
[34:09] ha here we go are you ready
[34:11] and they have the material on earth now
[34:13] to make themselves ready
[34:22] they have the material here on it now to
[34:25] make themselves ready because the
[34:26] battery said his wife
[34:27] had made herself ready here we go notice
[34:31] it
[34:31] said she has made us afraid so many says
[34:35] if the lord will take this evil spirit
[34:38] from me
[34:39] from drinking from gambling
[34:42] from lion or stealing i'll save him
[34:46] but that's up to you
[34:48] [Music]
[34:50] you have got something too didn't
[34:53] overcome shall inherit all things
[34:55] did it overcome you
[34:59] have power to do it
[35:02] but you must be willing to lay it down
[35:06] she has made herself ready i like that
[35:08] word
[35:09] you see god here we go could not push us
[35:12] through a little pipe
[35:14] and pull us out on the other side and
[35:16] then say blessed is he that overcome it
[35:20] god cannot push you through the pipe and
[35:23] then come around and pull you out
[35:25] and say blessed is he that overcome it
[35:28] no his blessings he that pull it
[35:32] that does not overcome it now watch you
[35:34] had nothing to overcome
[35:36] he just pulled you through but you have
[35:38] got to make
[35:40] decisions for yourself
[35:44] listen but i had to make a decision for
[35:47] myself
[35:49] and in doing that we show our faith
[35:52] and respects to god
[35:56] when it dropped on what did the voice
[35:58] said because that was chosen
[36:01] you have walked in your own chosen you
[36:03] have picked the precise and correct
[36:05] decision
[36:06] it is my way it is the harder way it is
[36:09] the narrow way
[36:10] oh glory to god because of this decision
[36:13] a huge
[36:13] portion of heaven awaits thee what a
[36:16] wonderful glorious decision that has
[36:17] made
[36:18] this in itself is what will make and
[36:22] come to pass the tremendous victory
[36:24] in the love divine at the end of staying
[36:27] with the word
[36:28] god will show you a continuation of the
[36:31] word and god will
[36:32] confirm the word to your life
[36:38] oh glory are you with me but abraham saw
[36:42] recognizing his message the seven angel
[36:44] message is to open the mystery of the
[36:46] seals
[36:47] calling the enlivened our gentiles to
[36:49] receive the same pay
[36:50] that the first hour workers got and
[36:53] jesus taught it
[36:54] he said there were some people went into
[36:55] the harvest they were hired and when
[36:57] they did early morning receive a penny
[36:58] for the day
[36:59] noon time came and work and then at the
[37:01] 11th hour
[37:02] last all the day someone come in and
[37:04] receive the same kind of pay
[37:06] that they did at the first hour of the
[37:07] day so it's perfectly the first all
[37:09] messengers
[37:10] with the word with the gospel the truth
[37:12] they came into their pentecost
[37:13] there was a dark age blocked them out
[37:15] then at the middle of the day luther
[37:16] wesley
[37:17] then there's to be an even time message
[37:20] to receive the same thing they did at
[37:22] the beginning
[37:23] this is very important not a new thing
[37:27] but the same thing here we go the even
[37:30] time
[37:30] message is to restore back again to
[37:33] bring back
[37:34] that same thing
[37:37] notice the scripture we read the
[37:39] disciples of john came to jesus and said
[37:41] why
[37:42] say the scribe these disciples came out
[37:44] disciples of jesus
[37:46] why say the scribes elias must first
[37:49] come
[37:50] the answer jesus said elias must first
[37:53] truly come
[37:54] and restore all things he's talking
[37:57] about malachi 4.
[37:58] but elias had already come and did what
[38:01] he's supposed to do he's talked much on
[38:02] the baptist
[38:03] same spirit of elijah but the first
[38:06] thing he said
[38:07] elias shall fully come first come and
[38:09] restore all things
[38:10] that means we have to see a restoration
[38:13] of the holy ghost
[38:15] back in the church a restoration of
[38:17] signs wanders
[38:18] back into the church i'm not talking
[38:20] about william branham now he had that
[38:23] because he was restored back to adam
[38:25] before the fall
[38:27] oh give the devil a shout out to pray
[38:30] brother branham was a full
[38:33] demonstration of a son
[38:36] before the fall that's why he could say
[38:40] before the doctors and touches my wife
[38:41] the tumor will go down the treatment
[38:43] goes down
[38:44] little fishy i give you back your life
[38:46] he was demonstrating apostolic authority
[38:49] and apostolic power and he said what you
[38:52] see
[38:52] gonna have more of it when the stress of
[38:56] the press come down
[39:01] come on now praise god hallelujah you
[39:04] are ready for that yet
[39:06] we are not ready for that yet because we
[39:08] have to get the test of the word
[39:11] i'm not hearing you you ride with me
[39:14] don't just watch what i'm saying i'm
[39:16] i'm speaking the word to you
[39:18] [Applause]
[39:21] i'm not talking about tests by your
[39:22] family just but no the test of the word
[39:26] when jesus got the holy ghost he was led
[39:27] to be tested alone
[39:29] here bring his elders and bring out
[39:31] possibility there we go in wilderness

[39:46] every list and come from another hold on

[57:28] and that curse was the front man to say
[57:31] these people
[57:32] are not drunk as you suppose but this is
[57:35] that
[57:36] that the prophet you see we have to go
[57:38] back to the world
[57:39] we have to be able to identify the
[57:42] manifestation
[57:43] back into the scripture jesus i want to
[57:47] find the place
[57:48] where it is written they say the spirit
[57:50] is upon me
[57:51] we have to go back to the scripture and
[57:54] the bride
[57:55] have to fight the scriptures could
[57:58] somebody say amen
[58:00] your scripture is not church member
[58:02] [Applause]
[58:05] sit down say in a minute you see people
[58:07] want to believe this message and don't
[58:09] go to the word
[58:10] is that possible yes you can believe the
[58:13] message of the doctrine
[58:14] as a teaching as a belief that is right
[58:17] but for you
[58:18] that go to the word means that you are
[58:21] applying the word to your life
[58:26] and wherever the sword falls it falls
[58:30] in other words you are not doing
[58:32] something because
[58:34] somebody else is doing it you ask what
[58:37] does the word say
[58:43] well this pastor allowing this or this
[58:46] pastor doing that
[58:48] and we should do it too no what does the
[58:50] word see
[58:51] so your measurement is not another
[58:52] church your measurement is not another
[58:54] group
[58:55] we have no mecca the muslim has mecca
[58:57] mecca is where the journey too
[58:59] that is their oh holy holy place
[59:12] we have a headquarters today
[59:15] see where going that brother until we're
[59:18] going
[59:18] but branham he says we cannot all come
[59:22] into one organization
[59:24] we cannot do that this little
[59:26] organization i think god been in it
[59:28] the whole thing but we are different
[59:31] each
[59:32] man sees different each person sees
[59:34] different
[59:35] no two minds is exactly the same no two
[59:38] people
[59:38] is the same known two noses no two thumb
[59:41] prints being made different
[59:43] and that way we should have different
[59:45] groups
[59:48] i want to hear a bigger image than that
[59:51] so we can be fighting for one group
[59:57] the group he doesn't have that
[1:00:01] watch god always works with an
[1:00:03] individual
[1:00:05] he don't save you because your methodist
[1:00:07] he doesn't save you because you're
[1:00:08] baptist
[1:00:09] he doesn't save you because your
[1:00:10] pentecostals he saves you because he has
[1:00:12] dealt
[1:00:13] personally with you and you are saved on
[1:00:16] that basis
[1:00:18] that you have accepted it so therefore
[1:00:20] god could deal with you
[1:00:21] he doesn't deal with you in the order of
[1:00:23] his church he deals with you as an
[1:00:26] individual
[1:00:28] therefore when god sent forth his
[1:00:31] prophets
[1:00:32] his messengers of the testament he spoke
[1:00:34] to one man
[1:00:36] and that man had to bring the message
[1:00:38] others
[1:00:39] went from him everywhere bringing the
[1:00:41] same message
[1:00:43] or supposed to bring us a message but
[1:00:45] there had to be
[1:00:46] one headquarters
[1:00:49] [Music]
[1:00:50] god has always had it i'm thankful he's
[1:00:53] got it tonight
[1:00:55] that's the holy ghost
[1:00:58] not some group but the holy spirit is
[1:01:01] god's headquarters
[1:01:03] that is god's messenger of the hour i
[1:01:06] want to hear how big i am
[1:01:08] so we have a headquarters this morning
[1:01:10] and we are connected to
[1:01:12] it
[1:01:20] so any group any church anyway want to
[1:01:23] be mecca
[1:01:24] for the bride that's that doesn't make
[1:01:27] sense
[1:01:28] they on their own somebody said the
[1:01:30] journey to that
[1:01:32] not me not us not the bride
[1:01:36] we have one headquarters could we say
[1:01:39] do you know the headquarters it's the
[1:01:41] holy ghost
[1:01:42] the holy ghost is god's headquarters and
[1:01:45] if the holy ghost
[1:01:46] anoint brother anthony you're hearing
[1:01:48] from the headquarters
[1:01:50] if the holy ghost i'm going but isaac
[1:01:52] you're hearing from the headquarters
[1:01:55] and if the holy ghost are not your
[1:01:56] pastor you are hearing from headquarters
[1:02:00] i say this morning you are hearing from
[1:02:02] headquarters
[1:02:04] because there's going to be a
[1:02:05] restoration of all things
[1:02:08] i am going to be your god he said i will
[1:02:10] wipe away your eye cares
[1:02:13] [Applause]
[1:02:17] how much inner pain is in the heart of
[1:02:19] people that people don't know
[1:02:21] some minutes i could write that away
[1:02:23] come to every tears from your eyes
[1:02:28] do we really know the people's hurts
[1:02:31] people fears
[1:02:32] people in a pain what they struggle with
[1:02:35] and
[1:02:35] suffer with you don't have a clue
[1:02:39] you see a bunch of weaklings a bunch of
[1:02:42] struggler people need it
[1:02:44] [Music]
[1:02:46] but lord have mercy
[1:02:52] we like to boss how strong we are yeah
[1:02:54] we like to talk about david
[1:02:56] samson josiah
[1:03:01] we hardly talk about jacob amen because
[1:03:04] jacob speaks a lot about us
[1:03:10] who preached about jacob jacob great
[1:03:12] drop affection
[1:03:13] i have to perfection no perfection or we
[1:03:15] don't even understand how revolutionary
[1:03:17] because to me if you get grace to your
[1:03:19] life it must show extending to others
[1:03:23] you cannot have a genuine revelation of
[1:03:26] god's grace
[1:03:27] and really really take it on somebody
[1:03:29] else
[1:03:30] because grace means god's blood come
[1:03:32] into your life
[1:03:34] grace means god listen but iran
[1:03:36] dramatize it he talk about a man who
[1:03:37] killed a king's son
[1:03:40] became only son not a seventh or sixth
[1:03:43] or fourth looking at one son
[1:03:45] amen the man the king came to see the
[1:03:47] man who killed his son
[1:03:50] came to the prison why have you killed
[1:03:53] my son
[1:03:54] my only son and the man very repentant
[1:03:58] so i didn't mean to do it i got in that
[1:04:00] temper and i i acted and whatnot
[1:04:03] and the man said no today you are going
[1:04:04] to be my son
[1:04:09] the king took his robe put it on that
[1:04:13] man
[1:04:14] and that man that was a condemned
[1:04:15] prisoner walk out as the king's son
[1:04:20] that is grace
[1:04:24] i'm not hearing you maybe some of you up
[1:04:27] somewhere
[1:04:29] but that is grace now this
[1:04:32] is what god wants us to extend to others
[1:04:38] you have to have more patience
[1:04:41] come on hallelujah
[1:04:45] patient like god
[1:04:48] hallelujah yes we have to have more
[1:04:51] patience
[1:04:53] yeah these are fast age fast foods
[1:04:55] everything we want now
[1:04:56] but patience must have its perfect work
[1:05:00] patience problems is perfection is
[1:05:02] waiting on god and waiting for god
[1:05:04] you're waiting you're not waiting you're
[1:05:06] struggling you're waiting you god is
[1:05:08] silent but you're still waiting
[1:05:10] you're not backsliding waiting you're
[1:05:11] holding on waiting under signification
[1:05:13] you're waiting because god gave you a
[1:05:15] promise
[1:05:15] you're waiting
[1:05:17] [Applause]
[1:05:20] jacob because he was a son
[1:05:25] he had the ability to hear from god
[1:05:31] that is tremendous he has not changed
[1:05:34] yet
[1:05:35] but he could hear from god
[1:05:40] that's why he told god you told me to go
[1:05:43] back home
[1:05:44] you told me to go back to the word back
[1:05:47] to the bible
[1:05:48] and i am struggling but i'm going back
[1:05:52] hallelujah i'm fierce but i'm going back
[1:05:57] i have challenges but i'm going back
[1:06:05] [Music]
[1:06:06] and i trust that god put upon you
[1:06:10] a burden to get back to your first love
[1:06:14] get back to our abandonment to god
[1:06:18] where you free yourself from the world
[1:06:20] and the things of the world and the
[1:06:21] environment and say god i really need
[1:06:23] you
[1:06:24] i need a breakthrough and need an
[1:06:26] infilling of your spirit
[1:06:29] i need an empowerment
[1:06:33] [Applause]

[1:06:48] my job take me to my home
[1:06:50] i want to take it to the enemy come on

[1:06:54] enemy
[1:06:55] i want to be so empowered that i'm
[1:06:57] empowered to take it back to the enemy
[1:07:00] take it to the camp of the enemy oh
[1:07:04] hallelujah look at the lord and shout
[1:07:07] the prayers
[1:07:09] for glory to god we get an insight
[1:07:13] into battle inside into spiritual
[1:07:16] warfare
[1:07:17] that you can have the victory and
[1:07:19] overcome because god wants a bunch of
[1:07:21] overcomers
[1:07:22] there's going to be i don't care how
[1:07:23] much hell is on the earth i look at my
[1:07:26] demons i'm on sex spirit how much lost

[1:09:39] hallelujah give the lord a shout
[1:09:43] you may be seated open bibles the first
[1:09:46] kings chapter 18.
[1:09:48] let's find that scripture first king
[1:09:49] chapter 18 let me get on in the
[1:09:51] scriptures back to the bible
[1:09:53] first kings chapter 18 hallelujah
[1:10:00] we want to read from verse 17. first
[1:10:02] kings chapter 18
[1:10:04] reading from verse 17 we read and it
[1:10:08] came to pass when aof saw elijah
[1:10:10] that ahab said unto him
[1:10:14] i thought he the trouble at israel
[1:10:18] are you the troubleman
[1:10:22] and he answered i have not troubled
[1:10:24] israel
[1:10:25] but thou and my father's house in that
[1:10:29] had forsaken the commandments of the
[1:10:30] lord and that was followed balaam
[1:10:34] now therefore sin and gather to me
[1:10:37] all israel onto monkana
[1:10:41] and the prophets of beia 450
[1:10:45] and the prophets of the grove 400
[1:10:48] so there's 850 prophets all together
[1:10:51] which eats at jezebel stable hallelujah
[1:10:54] you see where the prophet eating from
[1:10:56] so ahab sent unto all the children
[1:10:58] israel guided the prophets together unto
[1:11:00] monkana
[1:11:01] and elijah came unto all the people and
[1:11:03] said
[1:11:04] how long shall you halt between two
[1:11:07] opinions
[1:11:08] if the lord be god follow him and if
[1:11:11] baal then follow him
[1:11:13] and the people answered him not a word
[1:11:15] there was silence
[1:11:17] then said elijah unto the people i even
[1:11:20] i only remain a prophet of the lord
[1:11:23] but baal prophets are 450 men
[1:11:29] there's a huge comparison there let them
[1:11:32] therefore give us two bullets
[1:11:34] let them choose one bullock for
[1:11:36] themselves cut it in pieces
[1:11:39] lay it on wood put no fire under
[1:11:42] and i will dress the other block lay it
[1:11:45] on wood
[1:11:46] and put no fire under and call me on the
[1:11:49] name of your gods
[1:11:50] and i will call in the name of the lord
[1:11:53] under god
[1:11:54] that answer it by fire let him
[1:11:57] be god then the people don't get loose
[1:12:01] and all the people answered it is well
[1:12:02] spoken
[1:12:06] and elijah said unto the prophets of
[1:12:08] their choose you one bullock for
[1:12:10] yourselves and dress it
[1:12:11] first for ye are many and call in the
[1:12:14] name of your gods
[1:12:16] but put no fire under and they took the
[1:12:18] bullock which was given him
[1:12:20] they dressed it calling the name of baal
[1:12:22] from morning
[1:12:23] even until noon saying obey i'll hear us
[1:12:26] but there was no voice
[1:12:27] no any that answered and they leaped
[1:12:30] upon the altar which was made
[1:12:31] it came to pass at noon elijah mocked
[1:12:34] them and said cry aloud
[1:12:36] for he is a god either he is talking or
[1:12:39] he is pursuing
[1:12:40] or he is on a journey or perventing his
[1:12:43] sleeper and must be waking
[1:12:44] and they cry a lot cut themselves after
[1:12:47] the manner
[1:12:48] with knives landsat fell blood got shot
[1:12:51] among them
[1:12:52] and it came to pass when mayday was
[1:12:54] passed they prophesied until the time of
[1:12:57] the offering
[1:12:58] of the evening sacrifice that there was
[1:13:00] neither voice
[1:13:01] no any to answer not anything regarded
[1:13:05] and elijah said unto the people come
[1:13:07] near unto me
[1:13:09] and all the people came near to him here
[1:13:11] we go this is the part i want to get to
[1:13:13] and he repaired the altar of the lord
[1:13:18] that was broken down keep the pages
[1:13:20] right there we're not finished
[1:13:21] the first thing elijah did was to repair
[1:13:26] the altar repair it in your home
[1:13:30] repair it in your house repair it in
[1:13:32] your life
[1:13:34] repair the altar of god the place where
[1:13:37] you pray
[1:13:38] husband and wife the praise where you
[1:13:39] pray father
[1:13:41] sons and children or whatever the place
[1:13:43] where you pray repair it
[1:13:44] and bring it back bring it back in the
[1:13:47] house
[1:13:48] repair restore the altar of god
[1:13:51] back into the home back into the church
[1:13:53] we have on a parameter on tuesday we're
[1:13:55] going to repair
[1:13:56] we're going to bring back the offering
[1:13:58] up unto god incense going up unto god
[1:14:01] are you with me and elijah took 12
[1:14:04] stones
[1:14:06] according to the number of the tribes of
[1:14:07] the sons of jacob unto whom he the word
[1:14:09] of lord came
[1:14:10] saying israel shall be thy name and with
[1:14:13] the stones he built an altar
[1:14:15] in the name of the lord and he made a
[1:14:17] trench above the altar
[1:14:19] as great as can contain two measures of
[1:14:21] seed
[1:14:22] he put here we go the wood in order
[1:14:26] he didn't destroy the word on the altar
[1:14:29] he put it in order
[1:14:30] and that's why the church must be set in
[1:14:32] order that's why your life have to come
[1:14:34] into order
[1:14:35] there must be an order isn't that right
[1:14:37] he cut the bullock in pieces
[1:14:39] laid him on the wood and said fill four
[1:14:42] barrels with water
[1:14:44] pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on
[1:14:46] the wood he said do it a second time
[1:14:48] they did it the second time he said do
[1:14:50] it the time and they did it at a time
[1:14:53] and the water ran about the altar he
[1:14:56] filled the trench
[1:14:57] also with water and it came to pass
[1:15:00] at the time of the offering of the evil
[1:15:01] sacrifice elijah the prophet came there
[1:15:04] and said
[1:15:05] listen to this prayer lord god of
[1:15:08] abraham isaac and israel
[1:15:10] let it be known this day that thou art
[1:15:12] god in israel
[1:15:14] that i am thy servant and that listen
[1:15:17] i have done all these things at thy word
[1:15:21] hear me o lord hear me that this people
[1:15:24] may know
[1:15:25] that thou art the lord god here we go
[1:15:28] and that doors turn
[1:15:30] their heart back again
[1:15:34] keep your fingers right there the elijah
[1:15:36] spirit
[1:15:37] is to restore and turn the hearts back
[1:15:42] to god and this is what he's praying
[1:15:44] here now
[1:15:46] watch then the fire of the lord fell and
[1:15:48] consumed the burnt sacrifice
[1:15:50] and the wood and the stones and the dust
[1:15:54] lick up the water that was in the trench
[1:15:56] and when all the people saw it
[1:15:58] they fell on their faces and they said
[1:16:00] the lord he is the god
[1:16:02] the lord he is the god and elijah said
[1:16:04] unto them take the prophets of baal
[1:16:06] let not one of them escape and they took
[1:16:09] them and elijah brought them down to the
[1:16:11] kishon and slew them there may god bless
[1:16:15] the reason of his word before
[1:16:18] the fire fell
[1:16:22] before the fire fell the altar had was
[1:16:25] to be repaired
[1:16:27] the old heart was to be restored prey
[1:16:30] had to be offered
[1:16:31] for the guarded answer by fire let him
[1:16:34] be god
[1:16:35] and before the fire of dynamics falls
[1:16:38] there got to be a restoration
[1:16:40] of all things a restoration of the
[1:16:43] prayer altar back in the church
[1:16:45] a restoration of sign and crying and
[1:16:48] travailing
[1:16:49] and groaning for the holy ghost there's
[1:16:52] got to be a restoration
[1:16:54] because the opening of the word is
[1:16:56] supposed to bring us back to the bible
[1:17:02] the opening of the mysteries it's
[1:17:05] supposed to bring the people
[1:17:07] back to the world but abraham said this
[1:17:11] moses was the word in that day because
[1:17:13] the word was given to him for that day
[1:17:15] mo joseph was the word in that day put
[1:17:17] you in christ
[1:17:18] each one of them was the word here we go
[1:17:20] are you ready
[1:17:21] but when jesus came he was the word
[1:17:25] in its fullness because the whole plan
[1:17:28] of redemption laid in him
[1:17:30] the whole plan of redemption didn't lay
[1:17:32] in moses did elaine joseph
[1:17:34] delaney elijah they were part of the
[1:17:37] word
[1:17:38] pointing to it notice keep your thought
[1:17:40] here it comes
[1:17:41] as i see it the whole plan wasn't in
[1:17:44] them
[1:17:44] they were pointing to it therefore
[1:17:48] after him the fullness here we go we
[1:17:51] cannot point to something else
[1:17:54] it points back to him the word so when
[1:17:56] the fullness come
[1:17:58] we can't point this on man we can point
[1:18:00] to some group
[1:18:01] we have got to point to the headstone
[1:18:03] himself
[1:18:05] the capstone of divine love even jesus
[1:18:10] christ
[1:18:13] so everybody pointed out man or group is
[1:18:15] false
[1:18:16] it's off the word it has to be back to
[1:18:19] christ
[1:18:20] the fullness because you have to be
[1:18:22] brought into the measure
[1:18:24] of the fullness of the statue of christ
[1:18:27] which means you get your measure of this
[1:18:30] stature
[1:18:31] this is the fullness but you get a
[1:18:34] measure of that fullness
[1:18:36] in your life
[1:18:40] oh hallelujah glory to god
[1:18:45] so therefore the fightful ministry will
[1:18:47] take the bride
[1:18:49] back to the word back to the bible isn't
[1:18:52] that right
[1:18:53] because the bible brings on the fullness
[1:18:54] of the atonement that's what came
[1:18:56] to bring the fullness of the blood
[1:18:58] understand this the altar
[1:19:00] is where judgment strikes and because
[1:19:02] the altar has blood on it it becomes a
[1:19:04] mercy seat
[1:19:05] he said the altar was there in a
[1:19:06] gardener eden that's where king and abel
[1:19:08] come to worship
[1:19:09] he said the way back to even this by the
[1:19:11] altar and through the altar you have to
[1:19:13] come back to the altar
[1:19:14] the author is where the sacrifices
[1:19:15] approve where your life has come on the
[1:19:17] altar
[1:19:18] stripped of ambition stripped of will
[1:19:21] stripped of
[1:19:22] pride stripped of who you think you are
[1:19:25] and you say
[1:19:26] god consume the sacrifice
[1:19:28] [Applause]
[1:19:34] remember we talk about three things last
[1:19:35] sunday hallelujah three things to make
[1:19:37] fire
[1:19:38] and we talk about the word we talk about
[1:19:40] worship are we talking about
[1:19:41] signification
[1:19:43] it must have those three ingredients
[1:19:44] must be a sanctified bunch
[1:19:46] some part of this earth god going to
[1:19:49] bring a sanctified bunch true
[1:19:51] you have to be sanctified by the word
[1:19:54] god has to clean you up
[1:19:55] wash them by the washing of the water by
[1:19:57] the word and with that you come
[1:19:59] worshiping
[1:20:01] praising god oh
[1:20:04] hallelujah i i don't want to be caught
[1:20:06] in cotton coating
[1:20:08] he said the mysteries is to bring you to
[1:20:09] a spot where you have to where you could
[1:20:11] behave yourself
[1:20:12] that's what it's for nothing to go and
[1:20:14] say you have mysteries you have
[1:20:15] knowledge
[1:20:16] because paul handled that do i know all
[1:20:18] mysteries
[1:20:19] do i have all knowledge and i don't have
[1:20:21] the love of god i am not
[1:20:23] sort nothing zero neither
[1:20:26] paul hadn't let already do i have fear
[1:20:28] to move mountains
[1:20:30] nothing still
[1:20:33] [Applause]
[1:20:34] [Music]
[1:20:35] the miracles jesus they didn't do it no
[1:20:38] it was the cross that did it
[1:20:40] the power was in the cross that's why
[1:20:42] you went down the hill
[1:20:43] that's right that way you brought the
[1:20:44] resurrection he raised the dead do you
[1:20:46] think they said tank can reason they're
[1:20:47] dead come
[1:20:48] come does jesus no look home and live
[1:20:51] but abraham lived the life of christ
[1:20:52] manifest christ do some miracles and the
[1:20:54] pentecostal here to the man rejected him
[1:20:56] they still push him aside they was
[1:20:58] impressed with the miracles but that
[1:20:59] doesn't stop how they go
[1:21:01] but guess what he said the message going
[1:21:04] to
[1:21:04] get in the heart of the predestinated
[1:21:06] some of us wasn't even born yet
[1:21:08] some of us wasn't wrong but he knew by
[1:21:11] vision
[1:21:12] this word can return void god circle the
[1:21:15] earth with this message
[1:21:16] and god has to find you in trinidad look
[1:21:19] where you come from
[1:21:20] look how far you come from i don't care
[1:21:22] if it was in the bush somewhere
[1:21:24] god i could find you if your name is on
[1:21:27] that book
[1:21:28] and pull you out god couldn't let you
[1:21:30] born in some big rich family
[1:21:32] god that you're born under poverty god
[1:21:34] let you born in the struggle
[1:21:36] god that you're born wherever to make
[1:21:38] sure you get in position
[1:21:40] to hear the message this is the greatest
[1:21:42] thing you could hear
[1:21:44] this is the last message this is the
[1:21:46] final message
[1:21:47] this is a message from the angel
[1:21:54] glory glory you might be seated
[1:21:59] i'm a prophecy brahman said just say the
[1:22:02] lord
[1:22:03] russia have a bomb for the vatican
[1:22:06] it's already built it's already here
[1:22:09] nuclear bombs are going to be used
[1:22:14] the world is heading for war i don't
[1:22:16] want to be part of that
[1:22:17] it's going to affect the entire world we
[1:22:20] can't say we're in trinidad and we are
[1:22:21] immune from it
[1:22:22] the bible says every island will be
[1:22:23] flooded away and the eyes are small
[1:22:25] thing in god
[1:22:27] so if you figure you want an island here
[1:22:28] everything is safe and nice and dandy
[1:22:30] look at the prime minister the budget
[1:22:32] was the 80 dollars look at the price of
[1:22:33] oil now
[1:22:34] she can say don't let the price fall
[1:22:41] she's not controlling that and i'm
[1:22:43] telling you certain things we won't be
[1:22:44] able to control
[1:22:46] oh hallelujah did you hear that did you
[1:22:49] really hear that
[1:22:50] when the powers had to come we can't
[1:22:52] control healing the sick we can't
[1:22:53] control

[1:22:56] happen
[1:22:57] we can't control open the eyes of the
[1:23:00] blind blank
[1:23:07] but a brand of daughter died with cross
[1:23:09] eyes
[1:23:11] his baby daughter and after that he
[1:23:14] never prayed for cross-eyed children
[1:23:16] you know what he used to do just watch
[1:23:18] them and straight knuckle their eyes
[1:23:22] he had such a thing i guess that he
[1:23:23] didn't have to pray watch them across
[1:23:25] and just watch them and straighten out
[1:23:26] the eyes
[1:23:28] that our faith could do it oh yes
[1:23:31] oh yes oh yes oh yes
[1:23:35] faith could move mountains
[1:23:36] [Applause]
[1:23:43] all things are possible to them that
[1:23:46] believe
[1:23:48] fear could praise the dead fear could
[1:23:50] melt your cancer melt your tumor
[1:23:53] melt your condition fears could revive

[1:24:32] kind of drama business just just going
[1:24:34] inside the deer and say

[1:24:48] at what god say
[1:24:53] the instrument saying dying dying going
[1:24:55] undead

[1:25:25] stop sacrifice
[1:25:28] come on now come on now
[1:25:31] we're not talking about talking about it
[1:25:34] we talking about action
[1:25:40] read the bible read the bible read the
[1:25:41] bible go back to the word you may be
[1:25:43] seated
[1:25:44] you read a book on mark you only seen
[1:25:45] action words jesus healed the sick
[1:25:47] cast our devils do this do this only
[1:25:49] action not just information
[1:25:51] not just revelation you see we have to
[1:25:53] go to the revelation stage
[1:25:55] we have to go to the unfolding of the
[1:25:56] word stage but when that is over
[1:25:59] the teaching of the word time is over
[1:26:00] then it'll come the time of refreshing
[1:26:03] hope sent by god or jesus must receive
[1:26:07] the heaven must receive jesus
[1:26:08] until the restitution of all things so
[1:26:11] jesus jerome have to stay up there
[1:26:13] until everything be restored until the
[1:26:16] church is restored
[1:26:17] and we have a scripture from joel i will
[1:26:19] restore
[1:26:21] all with the conquer woman the
[1:26:22] caterpillar and the pomegranate
[1:26:25] so the scriptures itself is lining up
[1:26:28] to restore back the church
[1:26:31] to its former glory
[1:26:37] the church had a glory that glory was
[1:26:40] over the church
[1:26:41] when peter walked people were healed and
[1:26:43] peter's shadow
[1:26:44] it wasn't peter's shadow it was the
[1:26:47] shadow of god
[1:26:48] peter had a light in him that light was
[1:26:51] showing a shadow
[1:26:52] and when you walk under that shadow you
[1:26:54] have to be healed
[1:26:56] when paul touch you touch them and
[1:26:57] you'll get healed come on now they're
[1:26:59] quick
[1:27:00] and power oh
[1:27:03] i'm telling you some of you need that
[1:27:05] inside of here
[1:27:07] some of you are dead inside of here
[1:27:10] you need quick number but there's a
[1:27:12] promise for you
[1:27:14] of the quickening power oh give the lord
[1:27:17] some praises people
[1:27:19] oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god
[1:27:23] glory
[1:27:25] hallelujah
[1:27:28] blessed be the name of the lord so
[1:27:30] friends
[1:27:31] we have to go back to the word you have
[1:27:35] to go back to the bible
[1:27:36] isn't that right blessed be the name of
[1:27:39] the lord
[1:27:40] but abraham said to the lutheran age
[1:27:43] they just shall live by faith the outer
[1:27:44] court
[1:27:45] along came the methodist age
[1:27:46] signification age
[1:27:48] they call it the second definite work of
[1:27:49] grace which come
[1:27:51] in that age watch and now there's that's
[1:27:54] the alter age
[1:27:55] i like that that's the groaning that's
[1:27:58] the train that is travailing you see
[1:28:00] sanctification is what you do
[1:28:02] god has not come to come and clean up
[1:28:03] your house no angel coming to sweep no
[1:28:05] broom in your house
[1:28:06] you will clean up your house you will
[1:28:09] cut the grass around your yard
[1:28:11] you will cut the grass in your heart
[1:28:16] and you will clean up your life you will
[1:28:18] do it
[1:28:19] say after me i will do it say i've got
[1:28:22] to do it
[1:28:24] i will do it see i've got to do it
[1:28:28] give the lord a shout out
[1:28:34] so the altar age it's a signification
[1:28:36] age
[1:28:37] it's the travailing age once we're
[1:28:39] waiting in the spirit we waiting on a
[1:28:41] signification
[1:28:45] because the name is coming hallelujah
[1:28:48] now i can say dynamic issue and it is
[1:28:50] here
[1:28:50] it isn't here in the form of promise
[1:28:53] brother branham
[1:28:54] had that promise amen but identify his
[1:28:56] dynamics as the spirit
[1:28:58] of prophecy because dynamics is spirit
[1:29:01] but if the spirit is not here for power
[1:29:03] and demonstration it can only be here
[1:29:05] as prophecy which has taken the same
[1:29:07] word and prophesying it
[1:29:09] that's what we have to do from version
[1:29:11] 10 8-11
[1:29:12] we have us to take from the prophet and
[1:29:14] prophesy back to the people
[1:29:16] because we don't have our own message
[1:29:18] that's why i bring the quotes
[1:29:20] that you will know i'm saying what the
[1:29:21] tapes say
[1:29:24] and i'm inspired saying it and god is
[1:29:27] anointing it
[1:29:29] so there is no mystic i'm trying to say
[1:29:31] this i'm trying to say that
[1:29:33] i'm not trying to say anything but what
[1:29:35] the tips say
[1:29:37] come on give the lord some praise as
[1:29:38] people oh
[1:29:40] hallelujah you see i know god only
[1:29:43] confirmed his word
[1:29:45] not an interpretation of it i understand
[1:29:48] that years ago
[1:29:50] that is why i started to stay and see
[1:29:52] even if i'm preaching free
[1:29:53] i know i'm preaching what the prophet
[1:29:54] said my brother and i say come and tell
[1:29:56] him i said something
[1:29:57] and he was sketching to find it i was
[1:29:59] happy he did that afterwards he found it
[1:30:01] because he never heard it before
[1:30:02] so even though you see i'm preaching
[1:30:04] free i'm not preaching my own thoughts
[1:30:06] you could find it back in the prophet's
[1:30:07] word years ago i promised to do that
[1:30:10] we're not preaching if i'm not coaching
[1:30:12] i'm still saying what the prophet said
[1:30:14] oh hallelujah but i'm saying it three
[1:30:17] i'm saying what the tapes say
[1:30:19] i purpose that i'll do that not try to
[1:30:21] interpret it means so
[1:30:22] it means so the ten vision and this and
[1:30:24] that and twisty and twisty and try to
[1:30:26] figure it out i'm gonna figure out
[1:30:27] anything if god said it it have to come
[1:30:29] to pass
[1:30:30] god said it's gonna be revival it got to
[1:30:31] come to pass god said you will be formed
[1:30:33] to the word image it's got to come to
[1:30:35] pass
[1:30:35] you have to be formed in a world image
[1:30:37] before you're going to rapture you are
[1:30:39] not in the word image right now
[1:30:40] because your choices were going to do
[1:30:42] that and some of you are ready for that
[1:30:44] yet
[1:30:45] some of you just got a little test and
[1:30:46] you want to ball and give up hallelujah
[1:30:48] you have to go through
[1:30:49] [Music]
[1:30:52] let's call it the willingness
[1:30:55] you hear that only 10 amen let's call it
[1:30:58] the wilderness
[1:31:00] the bible said i passed them through it
[1:31:03] had a shortcut to god
[1:31:04] you know but gotten me a long way to
[1:31:06] hoping hoping
[1:31:07] that the heart gave up on egypt
[1:31:10] notice when they tried to come let us go
[1:31:12] back to egypt that's what afraid of
[1:31:14] every time something go you have a rock
[1:31:15] back it's like you have a man in the
[1:31:16] closet
[1:31:18] if you guys want to get trouble yeah go
[1:31:19] right back to that man close today he
[1:31:20] said kill him kill him kill him kill him
[1:31:22] kill him kill your first husband bury
[1:31:25] him
[1:31:26] i hope nobody handle man in the closet
[1:31:28] bury him
[1:31:29] that first husband that first flesh kill
[1:31:31] him so you have nothing that's why when
[1:31:33] the those armies was fighting and
[1:31:35] whatnot the first thing to do is what
[1:31:36] blow up the bridge
[1:31:39] no turning back these al qaeda people
[1:31:41] who get radicalized them going
[1:31:43] one way you know they may hope in the
[1:31:45] commotion are they going straight to
[1:31:46] paradise
[1:31:47] that's how they're thinking look at how
[1:31:49] some people get radicalized in this
[1:31:50] message
[1:31:52] with hate and envy and malice and water
[1:31:54] they radicalize
[1:31:55] it look like they live take a back
[1:31:57] backseat is what you're taught now what
[1:31:59] you teach
[1:32:00] it you become indoctrinating or you're
[1:32:01] teaching you're fighting for the
[1:32:02] teaching
[1:32:03] i felt every teacher have no life in it

[1:32:11] to get some stories for you of how
