[1:10] to 7 12 to 18 reading from 2nd Timothy
[1:15] chapter 3 we didn't finish 1 to 9 this
[1:18] know also that in the last days perilous
[1:21] times shall come men shall be lovers of
[1:23] their own selves covetous boasters proud
[1:26] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:29] unthankful unholy without natural
[1:31] affection trucebreakers false accusers
[1:33] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[1:37] that are good traitors heady highminded
[1:39] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[1:42] god having a form of godliness but
[1:45] denying the power thereof from such turn
[1:47] away for of this sort are they which
[1:50] creep into houses and lead captive silly
[1:53] woman laden with sins let away with
[1:56] divers lusts ever learning and never
[1:58] able to come to the knowledge of the
[2:01] truth now as Janice and Jambres
[2:03] withstood Moses sudhi's also resists the
[2:08] truth
[2:08] men of corrupt Minds reprobate consider
[2:12] in defeat
[2:13] but they shall proceed no further for
[2:15] the folly shall be manifest unto all men
[2:18] as theirs also was the Stettin of that
[2:20] same chapter but evil men and seducers
[2:23] shall wax worse and worse deceiving and
[2:27] being deceived we go to Exodus chapter 7
[2:37] and this is Moses Aaron Pharaoh was
[2:41] eight and the Lord speak unto Moses and
[2:43] unto Aaron sayin
[2:45] when Pharaoh shall speak unto you saying
[2:47] Shore miracle for you then thou shalt
[2:50] see unto Aaron take thy rod and cast it
[2:53] before Pharaoh and it shall become a
[2:54] serpent and Moses and Aaron went in
[2:58] under Pharaoh and the saw as the
[3:00] Lord had commanded an Aaron Kasden Ezra
[3:02] before Pharaoh and before his servants
[3:04] and it became a serpent then Pharaoh
[3:08] also called the wise men and the
[3:10] Sorcerer's nor the magician's of Egypt
[3:12] they also didn't like manner with the
[3:15] enchantments for they cast down every
[3:17] man his rod and they became serpents
[3:21] but even rod swallowed up the rods and
[3:24] he hadn't feels hot that he hath not
[3:27] unto them as the Lord had said so let's
[3:31] go down to verse 17
[3:38] thus saith the Lord in this shall don't
[3:41] know that I am the Lord behold I will
[3:44] smite with a rod that is in my hand
[3:47] upon the waters which are in the river
[3:50] and they shall be turned to blood and
[3:52] the fish that is in the river shall die
[3:55] and the river shall stink and the
[3:58] Egyptians shall load the drink of the
[4:00] water of the river and the Lord speak on
[4:03] the moon is seen and the iron take thy
[4:05] rod and stretch of thine hand upon the
[4:06] waters of Egypt upon their streams upon
[4:09] their rivers upon their ponds upon their
[4:11] pools of water that they may become
[4:13] blood that there may be blood trawl or
[4:15] the land of Egypt boat and vessels of
[4:17] wood and in vessels of stone and Moses
[4:20] and the Aaron did so as the LORD
[4:24] commanded and he lifted up the rod and
[4:26] smooth the waters that were in the river
[4:28] in the sight of fear and the sight of
[4:31] his servants and all the waters that
[4:32] were in the river would turn into blood
[4:33] and the fish that was in the river died
[4:36] and the river stank and the Egyptians
[4:38] could not drink of the water of the
[4:39] river and there was blood for all the
[4:42] land of Egypt verse 22 and the
[4:45] magician's of Egypt did so with their
[4:48] enchantments and Pharaoh's heart was
[4:51] hardened neither did he happen to them
[4:53] as the Lord had said let's go to Exodus
[4:56] chapter 8 we want to read verse 5 to 7
[4:59] and then Priscilla from 12
[5:08] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying see
[5:12] unto Aaron stretch for down hand with I
[5:14] read over the streams over the rivers
[5:16] and over the puns and cause frogs to
[5:20] come up upon the land of Egypt and Aaron
[5:23] stretched out his hand over the waters
[5:25] of Egypt and the frogs came up and
[5:27] covered the land of Egypt and the
[5:30] magician did so with the enchantments
[5:33] and brought up frogs upon the land of
[5:35] Egypt let's go down to verse 12 now
[5:41] Pharaoh asks for a deliverance from the
[5:44] frogs and break you from the frogs and
[5:45] this is verse 12 and Moses and Aaron
[5:47] went on from Pharaoh and Moses cried
[5:49] unto the Lord because of the frogs which
[5:51] he had brought against Pharaoh and the
[5:53] Lord did according to the word of Moses
[5:55] and the frogs died out of the houses out
[5:58] of the villages and out of the fields
[5:59] and they gathered them to get up on
[6:01] heaps on the lands tank when Pharaoh saw
[6:04] that there was a respect he hadn't his
[6:07] heart and had not unto them as the Lord
[6:10] had said the Lord said unto Moses all
[6:13] the time whatever Moses did these guys
[6:15] doing - right and the Lord said unto
[6:16] Moses say on the air and stretched out
[6:18] thy rod and smite the dust of the land
[6:21] then they become lice short all the land
[6:24] of Egypt and they did so for Aaron
[6:27] stretched out his hand with his rod and
[6:28] smote the dust of the earth and it
[6:30] became lice in man and beasts all the
[6:33] dust of the land became lice throughout
[6:35] all the land of Egypt and the magician's
[6:38] did so with the enchantment to bring
[6:40] forth lice but they could not so there
[6:44] were lies upon man and upon beasts then
[6:48] the magician said unto Pharaoh
[6:49] this is the finger of God and Pharaoh
[6:53] heart was hardened and he hearkened not
[6:56] unto them as the Lord had said may God
[6:58] bless his word let's play one more time
[6:59] father I pray that you would come down
[7:01] today and inspire a word and bring great
[7:04] deliverance to your people brick the
[7:06] hole of the enemy upon every life
[7:07] guarded here in Jesus and I ask at him
[7:10] and you may be seated
[7:10] oh praise the Lord give him a shout
[7:14] all glory to God amen hallelujah
[7:17] certainly appreciate the service on
[7:20] Wednesday night but Isaac appear in
[7:22] preparation for the comment of the Lord
[7:24] hallelujah what a inspired message if
[7:27] you haven't heard it go on our YouTube
[7:28] channel and listen to that message and
[7:31] he was saying something that's really
[7:33] striking that after they when the
[7:36] foolish virgins or when the visions are
[7:38] rules then they they got to trim the
[7:40] lamps and then they recognized the oil
[7:42] run out and they went to buy sincere but
[7:46] too late too late they went to buy and
[7:50] why they went to buy the Lord came the
[7:53] bridegroom came so it's really something
[7:56] in a shaken time preparation for the
[7:58] coming of the Lord hallelujah Slava
[8:00] title this morning prepare yourself for
[8:03] the battle I love an inspiration break
[8:09] in the hole of the devil that's my
[8:13] inspiration brick in the hole of the
[8:15] devil prepare yourself for the battle
[8:18] what battle the common of the Lord as
[8:21] the battle the common of the Lord that
[8:24] common of the Lord is 1st Thessalonians
[8:25] 4:16 so we read some scriptures what
[8:28] words could follow me behind it maybe
[8:29] get in the screen of an on but I believe
[8:33] that this last deep battle will be
[8:35] fought not on doctrine but in the realm
[8:38] of the supernatural and and based on the
[8:47] first script I read where Paul said as
[8:52] Janice and Jambres withstood Moses so
[8:56] these also resist the truth men of
[8:59] corrupt men Minds reprobate here what
[9:02] forbid about concerning defeat defeat
[9:07] and this is the same defeat that goes on
[9:11] a prophet to restores back to
[9:13] hallelujah do you get that God send a
[9:17] prophet to turn us back to defeat you
[9:19] know and last days honest and generous
[9:21] spirits they have corrupt minds
[9:24] concerning defeat or glory that God this
[9:27] faith has been delivered all glory to
[9:30] God hallelujah do you believe that
[9:33] praise the name of the Lord so I believe
[9:36] this battle so forget doctrine Resta
[9:38] forget doctrine is not a doctrine
[9:40] McLennan is the battle in the
[9:42] supernatural that means it listen you
[9:45] have to be totally convinced that there
[9:47] will be a supernatural manifestation of
[9:50] the power of God I could guarantee you
[9:53] that I don't care how you see you what
[9:56] you think what you imagine this is real
[9:59] just as Chinese and Jambres withstood
[10:02] Moses or glory to God Amen there were
[10:08] witches wizards or sorcerers hallelujah
[10:14] and I was checking what is witchcraft
[10:17] checking out what is this thing called
[10:19] witchcraft what what the butter
[10:21] encyclopedia what happened witchcraft
[10:23] witchcraft is to control people and
[10:27] events so when somebody trying to
[10:32] control people on events they operating
[10:34] under the witchcraft anointing see when
[10:39] I write under control her husband when
[10:44] passes telecon control congregations
[10:47] which graph so now I began to understand
[10:51] what I resisted I'll be checking the
[10:53] years ago because all I saw ministers
[10:57] handle people and control their life I
[10:59] rejected that and I made a pledge to God
[11:02] never to do that and I have never done
[11:04] that
[11:06] [Applause]
[11:08] you are supposed to be governed by the
[11:11] holy ghost part supposed to reign and
[11:14] rule over your life not some man God is
[11:19] the word save the worst a husband loved
[11:22] your wife if you love God you do that
[11:24] wife obey your husband if you love God

[25:27] angels but demons are just as real the
[25:32] countenance of the devil now makes
[25:33] people believe the Christian when
[25:35] they're not there's a thing continue no
[25:37] the god of this world today here we go
[25:41] the worshipped person of this world
[25:45] today is Seton and this blew my mind
[25:50] when I study in it one said this is the
[25:52] only age where he is called the god of
[25:54] the evil age the core of this thing that
[25:58] is why he's enjoying this environment to
[26:01] be in this last day because this the
[26:03] first time he has been acknowledged to
[26:05] be God because of the evil age what he
[26:10] wants his worship and that is what we
[26:13] not given him
[26:17] that is what make God God
[26:25] God is the object of worship whatever
[26:28] you worship is your God that is what
[26:31] Lucifer was lusting after that's why he
[26:33] put styles and fashions he put all kind
[26:36] of electronics all kind of stuff for
[26:37] people to worship the people are
[26:46] ignorant of worshipping Satan but it is
[26:49] sittin here we go
[26:51] impersonating himself as the church they
[26:55] worship Satan thinkin they're worshiping
[26:59] God through the church but you can only
[27:02] worship God by the word so that is why
[27:07] people love to be hiding in church but
[27:10] when you bring the word they don't want
[27:11] to take that but the word is God not
[27:17] Church is God the word is God you say
[27:28] wait a minute we preach the word look
[27:30] back at my text tonight Satan was the
[27:32] one that preached the word to Eve he
[27:33] said God had said it's a misconstrue in
[27:38] that part of the scripture that applies
[27:40] to the day he will let you know Jesus
[27:41] did perfectly well let you know most
[27:43] days perfectly well but when you take
[27:45] the promises that you gave for this day
[27:46] that was applied to another age that's
[27:48] all he has to do he said then people
[27:50] worship in season and this day thinking
[27:54] they are worshipping God but they are
[27:56] wishing him through a Creed I believe
[28:00] this I believe that and therefore we
[28:02] have fellowship that's not bright you
[28:07] know that is Lucifer oh my and he said
[28:13] no right down to the gritty deception
[28:14] the world I've ever known
[28:15] no matter how much the Word of God
[28:16] promised for this day is preached and
[28:18] vindicated they still won't believe it
[28:21] no Satan establishing his kingdom in the
[28:26] that's exactly why he's doing it he
[28:28] wants to establish his own kingdom
[28:34] I want you to get that that's his piece
[28:37] I want my kingdom I want my own that way
[28:41] less selfish incremental self fishing
[28:43] and I want to get someone pride years of
[28:45] what preach about you know but pride or
[28:47] private so evil because that is what
[28:50] comes coming Lucifer hot you know I will
[28:52] ascend be like the Most High
[28:54] they pride have a little bit humbling
[28:56] yourself on and like that God said in
[28:58] Scripture I am high and lofty one that
[29:00] dwell with him of a humble heart and a
[29:03] contrite spirit at him that trembles at
[29:05] my would let's continue as a business
[29:07] man that's not a Christian he will work
[29:09] every listen sittin he will work every
[29:14] scheme he can to make you see something
[29:17] the wrong way if he's got a put a person
[29:22] a person honking and making you doing
[29:23] that we can you see that way he will
[29:25] show you everything he can and keep you
[29:28] off from the truth of it because he is
[29:31] got a feeling only for himself so now I
[29:35] see the news people has just dumb them
[29:37] because he never was interested in them
[29:39] he was just interested and using them oh
[29:42] my hallelujah
[29:44] so no matter how much its lies and teeth
[29:46] on whatever more he's got personal gain
[29:49] and there's a religious deceit since the
[29:51] beginning of Eden that has ever been
[29:53] since now by this fall he has took over
[29:57] and possessed the Garden of Eden himself
[29:59] he took it over and now he has had six
[30:02] thousand against the deceitful rule
[30:04] deceiving the people and God's children
[30:06] because they were based on free moral
[30:09] agency to act any way they wish true and
[30:11] believing that they would act right a
[30:13] trust and they would act right and then
[30:16] it when they come with the wrong at and
[30:17] so they would try like Esau did and he
[30:20] had 6,000 years develop this even as God
[30:22] at six thousand years to bring his Eden
[30:24] to close by this seat the seat of the
[30:27] word all the people know establishes own
[30:29] Eden in the hood God's Eden was
[30:32] established in righteousness
[30:34] Satan's Eden is established and sin
[30:36] because Satan is sin and God is
[30:40] righteousness and course kingdom is
[30:43] established in righteousness and peace
[30:44] and
[30:45] and sittin is establishment is in sin
[30:47] and unreligious sin oh my
[30:51] Isaiah 14 said how I don't fallen from
[30:54] heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how
[30:56] I don't cut down to the ground with no
[30:58] weakness the nation for thou hast said
[31:00] in thine heart I will ascend unto heaven
[31:03] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[31:05] of God I will sit also the mountain
[31:07] congregation in the sides of the north I
[31:09] will ascend above the heights of the
[31:11] clouds I will be like the Most High yet

[31:16] the size of the petition they that City

[47:22] fire Sami I wish they'd given me pink
[47:23] slip he said it's all rather soul he
[47:27] said Samuel why Memphis sauce Samuel

[47:39] and when he building go up you dick
[47:40] Tomey scuffling I formed a better man
[47:50] anything does he man no I find a better
[47:52] man then he said go and anoint one in
[47:56] Santa Jesse and you may know the story
[47:57] difficult anointed but David everybody
[47:59] David couldn't say AHA again oh I did oh
[48:02] it's all pretty shown Saul was going to
[48:12] kill him in no difficulty very cheap

[48:57] comes with purpose behind it I never
[49:00] bill in the temple they have people
[49:01] anointed and brass and Ireland and
[49:03] Francie was because God wanted a Templar
[49:05] sitting away all glory to God God David
[49:08] had a heart for the hopes of God and God
[49:11] said no David your hands to bloody your
[49:13] son will do this job for me because
[49:15] Solomon was a different kind I got a guy
[49:17] hallelujah you needed a man who wanted
[49:19] peace David was a warrior
[49:21] David was a fika if it was an
[49:24] uncompromising
[49:25] Oh glory to God when you say sure that's
[49:29] David when they said right that is David
[49:31] when they said conquered that is David
[49:33] Oh glory to God that man can't be

[49:38] get wood from here you go chop this one
[49:39] down you could shut that one down you go
[49:42] push that one across but not Sonoma
[49:45] so God knew who to choose and put when
[49:49] so if God wanted you not to be here
[49:51] wasn't gonna be here that means God saw
[49:54] you and shows you an elective you for
[49:59] such a time as this

[1:01:28] Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:32] hallelujah glory to God amen second
[1:01:38] chorus is up to four I want to read from
[1:01:41] verse 1 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 verse
[1:01:45] 1 and Paul was saying therefore seeing
[1:01:47] we have this ministry as we have
[1:01:49] received mercy we faint not but I've
[1:01:52] renounced the hidden things of
[1:01:53] dishonesty but walking in craftiness not
[1:01:56] hardly would have got deceitfully but by
[1:01:58] manifestation of the truth commending
[1:01:59] ourselves to every man's conscience in
[1:02:01] the sight of God here we go but if our
[1:02:04] gospel be hid it is hid to them that are
[1:02:07] lost and this is a path in whom the god
[1:02:10] of this world has blinded the minds of
[1:02:15] them which believe not least the
[1:02:18] glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[1:02:19] image of God should shine under them the
[1:02:22] god of this world a blindness upon
[1:02:24] people what was loud ISA blind wretched
[1:02:27] miserable naked and don't even know it
[1:02:30] so that is what God brought you out God
[1:02:33] brought you out to that to bring you
[1:02:35] into light you can't go back into
[1:02:38] darkness you can't go back into law
[1:02:40] you can't go back into the nomination
[1:02:42] you can't go back to looking for a man
[1:02:44] looking for some church you have to look
[1:02:46] for Christ Christ is being preached to
[1:02:49] you you're looking for that word to
[1:02:51] become flesh in you because when that
[1:02:53] will become flesh the invisible become
[1:02:55] visible you don't have to talk and
[1:02:57] explain that if become manifest when the
[1:03:00] word became flesh and become visible Oh
[1:03:02] glory to God so how do we get evidence
[1:03:05] of this other world if God will bring a
[1:03:07] manifestation when God telling me bring
[1:03:12] him to a good land what did God do he
[1:03:13] asked them for 12 spies to do what to go
[1:03:15] into the land to bring back evidence so
[1:03:18] they have to have evidence of the
[1:03:19] supernatural and have to have evidence
[1:03:21] of where we go into and I've got
[1:03:24] evidence the power we going through we
[1:03:26] have the power coming from or glory to
[1:03:29] God that's why Jesus miracle was
[1:03:31] punishing to these to those Pharisees
[1:03:33] because they never saw anybody cast out
[1:03:35] Devils
[1:03:37] all glory they never saw power like that
[1:03:40] they were astonished at his doctrine he
[1:03:42] spoke with authority and them table so

[1:15:20] Word of God rule over them they accepted

[1:16:34] was in the box honor no he went on next
[1:16:36] ministry Oh glory to God because not
[1:16:39] some people in paradise and I've Noah
[1:16:41] and all them Bridget and Paradise and
[1:16:43] Jesus went on and open the gates up and
[1:16:45] get over here come on come on come on up
[1:16:48] empty Oh
[1:16:49] oh maybe seated
[1:16:56] I don't know how much I get you today
[1:17:01] Saul was no longer here from God could
[1:17:05] they're talking to him he had banned all
[1:17:07] witches and so on he found himself one
[1:17:10] is a get a word and he's going to go on
[1:17:16] this guy's in self and consult a witch
[1:17:20] in a cave hidin under which she cover
[1:17:27] and the rich conjure up soul Samuel
[1:17:32] Samuel the Prophet with his prophet
[1:17:34] mantle and the Samuel the Prophet would
[1:17:37] beat soul and said today you will build
[1:17:43] me then they would see but is usual you
[1:17:52] deceive me yes God not talking to me now
[1:17:57] what he was so backs didn't and the
[1:18:00] prophet reveal that because these
[1:18:06] witches Richards these wizards and
[1:18:10] witches they have a connection to the
[1:18:13] supernatural so they are the channels to
[1:18:19] get Church from these fallen angels
[1:18:22] spirits so at that time those witches
[1:18:26] had access to paradise but when Jesus
[1:18:30] take an empty old paradise they no
[1:18:33] longer have access to that realm so
[1:18:38] anybody saying they talked to somebody
[1:18:40] on top that was in hell that person not
[1:18:42] in paradise there was nothing ever
[1:18:43] denied furthermore together like spirits
[1:18:46] no or glory to God hallelujah or glory
[1:18:50] to God hallelujah and even under talk
[1:18:53] about our thing was Reader's Digest run
[1:18:56] an article on brother Branham on his
[1:18:58] accretion in prophecy and there was a
[1:18:59] witch
[1:19:00] who prophecy was also very accurate and
[1:19:03] had big advocates and both of them and
[1:19:05] so later he said you'll notice if you
[1:19:08] strip back the dollar back to the
[1:19:09] original you see Wed come from she had
[1:19:11] frolic she had jokes and everything else
[1:19:13] nothing about Christ nothing about God
[1:19:15] but she had access to that realm
[1:19:19] he said that other people try and
[1:19:21] crystal ball and their impersonators and
[1:19:22] impostors he said but she was a genuine
[1:19:24] medium and a prophet have genuine access
[1:19:28] to the supernatural realm to get the
[1:19:31] visions from God even as these witches
[1:19:34] have access to get demonic influences to
[1:19:37] put upon the earth or glory the closer
[1:19:40] is not that they're powerless and they
[1:19:42] have nothing and they have nothing no
[1:19:43] there's power but we are a greater power
[1:19:46] [Applause]
[1:19:49] those Devils are power to inflict with
[1:19:52] sicknesses but we are power the custom
[1:19:54] oh but you have to believe that you have
[1:19:57] to accept that you have to walk into
[1:19:58] that because this thing coming to a
[1:20:03] showdown and your faith will be tested
[1:20:08] within that shuttle to prove what you
[1:20:12] believe whether you believe it or not
[1:20:18] Jesus taught a very small miracle
[1:20:20] turning water into wine potentially
[1:20:24] water could become Wayne but the grapes
[1:20:27] Jesus just jump over and bypassed evil
[1:20:29] process so instead of squeezing grapes a
[1:20:32] ladle full minute long time I'm going at
[1:20:37] Wayne one time so his ministry build-up
[1:20:39] with miracles and powers and until it
[1:20:42] comes and Lazarus he's dead Joris I plus
[1:20:46] I go with him he's sleepin so in Jesus
[1:20:50] realm of the spirit Lazarus is not dead
[1:20:52] I want you to see that and Jesus
[1:20:57] understanding what the human level
[1:21:00] called dead is not dead he say I'm glad
[1:21:04] for your sakes I'm not there then he
[1:21:07] tell them Lazarus is dead

[1:29:23] it's your feet that saves you many
[1:29:26] people they're just as pure and clean
[1:29:27] yet a lot cleaner sometimes and people
[1:29:29] professed christians christians live yet
[1:29:32] they were denied the Holy Ghost we deny
[1:29:33] every operation of the power of God the
[1:29:36] unbelievers no matter what they're very
[1:29:37] religious shall we come back to this
[1:29:41] religious thing a family because the
[1:29:44] person so caught up in their religious
[1:29:45] world of what they'd seen and they
[1:29:47] believe they don't care about the
[1:29:49] children they don't care about a
[1:29:51] household they only care about the
[1:29:53] conviction
[1:29:54] so the cheiron's suffer house will
[1:29:57] suffer because they come like a sister
[1:30:00] whoever unbelieving husband unbelieving
[1:30:03] husband and there were question I was
[1:30:07] asked about the kinda behavior they
[1:30:10] would hold myself on my husband because
[1:30:12] he's an unbeliever
[1:30:13] he said no don't do that sister you know
[1:30:15] was treated with respect to them at love
[1:30:17] treat him right tell him they were right
[1:30:19] behavior nor religious spirit a body
[1:30:22] with that Sarah here same here over the
[1:30:26] church I a listen to him
[1:30:29] Christ is my head yeah
[1:30:38] now that is the religious spirit and
[1:30:42] listen it is easier to talk to a normal
[1:30:47] sinner then I really just want problem
[1:30:56] is poverty below he said rather be with
[1:30:58] a drunkard honest than a liar I like it
[1:31:03] up of human he breath will smell an
[1:31:04] angel

[1:31:10] a drunkard he was even started by
[1:31:12] drunken I'd almost a political sipping I
[1:31:16] don't know somebody that that kind the

[1:37:19] have seen them like that I have seen
[1:37:21] them look like total Isis great big
[1:37:24] spiders that with 50 pounds great big
[1:37:28] shadow and usually that's epilepsy total
[1:37:32] spirit totally shadow and said that is
[1:37:35] epilepsy it goes right over the audience
[1:37:39] and Almighty God who we are preaching
[1:37:40] about surely to be in the deepest of
[1:37:42] sincerity I have seen those things move
[1:37:45] over the audience I have seen them and
[1:37:47] sometimes when the congregation will be
[1:37:50] in one Accord they see them themselves
[1:37:53] many times hundreds of people would see
[1:37:56] it move dear for it must be the very
[1:38:00] deepest of sincerity it isn't a bluff
[1:38:03] you can't Bluff the devil at all he
[1:38:07] won't Bluff but whenever you really can
[1:38:10] produce the blood of Jesus Christ Satan
[1:38:13] can stand before that there is one thing
[1:38:17] I've always thought about that God by
[1:38:19] the power of his death at Calvary has
[1:38:22] given the church power to cast out evil
[1:38:24] spirits because marks existed in my name
[1:38:28] they shall not I will but they will cast
[1:38:32] out Devils
[1:38:33] so Calvary give us access and rights to
[1:38:37] cast out Devils Oh hallelujah praise God
[1:38:41] glory to God mark 69 says now when Jesus
[1:38:46] was recently the first of the week he
[1:38:48] appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of
[1:38:50] whom he had cast Seven Devils that's how
[1:38:55] the Bible described it
[1:38:56] I'm really good when Jesus was risen
[1:38:58] from the first of the week he appeared
[1:39:00] first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he
[1:39:02] cast Seven Devils I'm gonna ban him said
[1:39:05] Mary Magdalene she knew his power she
[1:39:08] knew there was something about him that
[1:39:10] was different from anyone else she had
[1:39:12] seven Devils cast all over everybody has
[1:39:14] ever been free from the devil by the
[1:39:16] power of Jesus Christ knows where they
[1:39:18] are standing no one can ever come in his
[1:39:20] great divine presence and ever be the
[1:39:22] same person anymore you were changed
[1:39:24] there was something happened to you you
[1:39:26] can't stand off on psychology and
[1:39:28] imagine this and accept this you know we
[1:39:30] believe in a power of the resurrection
[1:39:32] of Jesus Christ and when you come into
[1:39:34] his presence there is something that
[1:39:35] happens in your life that changes you
[1:39:38] and you are never the same no more a man
[1:39:41] that I've ever been in the presence of
[1:39:43] Christ so she at Seven Devils cast out
[1:39:45] of her and he called to pride and envy
[1:39:51] and she thought she was so pretty and
[1:39:54] there was no one like her do you think
[1:39:58] so about you any oh but when Jesus spoke
[1:40:02] is a bit o king and all that left huh
[1:40:05] you mean private a devil
[1:40:07] oh yes if you never knew that you know
[1:40:12] it now oh you mean that half the vote oh
[1:40:15] oh yes and we let the devil - oh yes
[1:40:22] you mean that have to leave - yes
[1:40:25] if you leave Mary Magdalene you can
[1:40:28] leave you another sister develop just
[1:40:34] want to make sure clarify that
[1:40:36] this pride is not assisters on leading
[1:40:38] it alright so the description I got for
[1:40:48] this witchcraft is the exercise or
[1:40:51] invocation of alleged supernatural
[1:40:53] powers to control people and events that
[1:40:58] is what that is about wantin control
[1:41:01] that's the object the whole thing is
[1:41:04] control now Galatians 5:16 to 26 maybe
[1:41:10] you get on board we can Galatians 5:16
[1:41:13] 26 this then this I say then walk in the
[1:41:17] spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[1:41:20] lusts of the flesh for the flesh lusteth
[1:41:23] against the spirit and the spirit
[1:41:24] against the flesh and these are contrary
[1:41:26] the one to the other so that you cannot
[1:41:28] do the things that you would but if you
[1:41:31] be led of this third you are not under
[1:41:34] the law know any part I want to get to
[1:41:36] the works of the flesh ADIZ most of us
[1:41:45] are manifest which are these adultery
[1:41:47] fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
[1:41:52] idolatry witchcraft hatred variance
[1:41:58] emulations wrath strife seditions
[1:42:02] heresies envyings murders drunkenness
[1:42:06] revellings and such like of the which I
[1:42:09] tell you that I have also told you in
[1:42:11] times past that they which do such
[1:42:12] things shall inherit the kingdom of God
[1:42:14] but the fruit of the Spirit is here we
[1:42:18] go love joy peace listen together
[1:42:22] long-suffering gentleness goodness faith
[1:42:26] meekness temperance again such there is
[1:42:31] no law ante that are Christ's have
[1:42:33] crucified the flesh with the affection
[1:42:35] and lust if we live in the spirit let us
[1:42:38] also walk in the spirit let us not be
[1:42:41] desirous of vain glory provoking one
[1:42:43] another envying one another
[1:42:46] Oh glory to God
[1:42:48] hallelu I'm gonna finish we should come

[2:12:10] the opportunity to gather once again as
[2:12:12] a people as a church Lord father knowing
[2:12:15] that the clock of time is counting down
[2:12:18] as we blend from time into eternity Lord
[2:12:22] will look for that day when there'll be
[2:12:23] no more sickness there'll be no more
[2:12:25] Lord pains Lord and father getting all
[2:12:29] will no longer be something that we need
[2:12:31] to talk about but we could talk about
[2:12:32] the glories of the journey Lord that
[2:12:35] only through your grace you brought us
[2:12:36] through because it was not our strength
[2:12:38] but Lord your love for us was so great
[2:12:41] and you could look true Lord and see
[2:12:43] everything unfold and you could write
[2:12:45] names in the book of those who would
[2:12:47] overcome you and write names in the book
[2:12:49] of those who were fall down but they
[2:12:51] would get back up again and Lord it was
[2:12:53] your blood that made that possible it
[2:12:55] was your grace that made it possible
[2:12:57] laughs Lord we can forget ourselves lost
[2:12:59] but you will find us because we could
[2:13:02] never find ourselves father we thank you
[2:13:04] Lord for the message this morning Lord
[2:13:07] through a son and Lord your servant and
[2:13:09] our pastor but over this morning lord I
[2:13:12] know how we labored how he wasn't well
[2:13:13] lor the last few days when Lord he's at
[2:13:16] his post of duty this morning lowered
[2:13:18] her burden for a few weeks now he's
[2:13:20] talking about going on the offensive the
[2:13:22] Lord and seasonless man but we are glad
[2:13:24] this morning because we are coming into
[2:13:26] a full realization of who we are it's
[2:13:29] morning in the economy of God so father
[2:13:32] may you visit him right now
[2:13:33] may you touch him in his body me you
[2:13:35] give him a fresh charge of the Holy
[2:13:37] Spirit may you be with your people Lord
[2:13:39] those that are here

[2:13:42] those that are even connected on the

[2:13:47] this message Lord I made it get courage
[2:13:49] and confidence and Lord comforted
[2:13:51] knowing that Lord it's almost finished
[2:13:53] it's almost over and Lord as per Ovid
[2:13:56] said may we take this anointing with us
[2:13:58] may we take this presence with us may we
[2:14:01] take this fire with us and we want to
[2:14:03] wait on you Lord here that still small
[2:14:05] voice for when you want us to move when
[2:14:08] he want us to act when you want us to do
[2:14:09] what we need to do we surrender to your
[2:14:11] Holy Spirit today Lord may you grant
[2:14:14] traveling mercies as we leave this place
[2:14:16] but not your presence lower commit every
[2:14:19] one and every Lord every situation into
[2:14:21] your hand in the precious name of Jesus

[2:14:58] night at 7:30 p.m.
[2:15:00] also on Friday night at 7:30 p.m. also
[2:15:04] so make every effort to be in the house
[2:15:08] of God for those of you who may not make
[2:15:11] it on our Wednesday night be sure to
[2:15:13] connect to the service the live stream
[2:15:16] of the service him and maintenance team
[2:15:20] group for please me to Guatemala and
[2:15:22] Alexander after the service there'll
[2:15:24] also be a very short meeting with the
[2:15:27] officers and their wives Deacon elders
[2:15:29] ashes trustees and wives after the
[2:15:32] service right after service you want it
[2:15:33] to be as quick as possible so be at your
[2:15:36] post and we also want you know the Bible
[2:15:40] said be wise as serpents and gentle of
[2:15:43] the as doves so we want to also be very
[2:15:45] conscious of the changing landscape of
[2:15:48] the world as we know it I believe was
[2:15:51] yesterday Saturday New York City
[2:15:53] declared a state of emergency I think
[2:15:56] this morning or Lydia's later this
[2:15:58] morning
[2:15:58] Italy locked down 16 million people in
[2:16:01] quarantine
[2:16:02] so people who thought they would have
[2:16:04] had maybe a service this morning can go
[2:16:07] out a service but you can't leave your
[2:16:09] house because you are in a quarantine 16
[2:16:11] million people in a quarantine and as
[2:16:15] these things unfold before us it doesn't
[2:16:17] come as a surprise to us it is it is
[2:16:19] what the scripture speaks about and
[2:16:21] different situations coming and plagues
[2:16:24] and woes and and that's not our sign
[2:16:26] because when all these things happen we
[2:16:28] look up for Redemption draweth nigh so
[2:16:30] we are not moved by it but at the same
[2:16:33] time we need to be conscious of it
[2:16:34] because we don't know what will unfold
[2:16:36] on this island we don't know what the
[2:16:38] next months will hold and we always said
[2:16:40] one day we'll have a last service known
[2:16:41] and it's somebody who may have had a
[2:16:42] plan in Italy for example to go to
[2:16:44] church this morning and just hear well
[2:16:45] you can't leave your house you know and
[2:16:47] that's that's a world we live in we
[2:16:49] don't know what tomorrow holds but we
[2:16:51] know who holds tomorrow
[2:16:52] and our faith and our confidence rests
[2:16:54] on the Lord
[2:16:56] you see people panicking and different
[2:16:58] things and you know my wife said she
[2:17:00] went to price Mart and
[2:17:01] and Lysol is sold out and this is so
[2:17:04] loud Vickers and gloves are so loud and
[2:17:07] somebody told me they need to buy Mac's
[2:17:09] for their job and they can't get it
[2:17:11] because people are stocking up on these
[2:17:12] things and and that's what the Bible
[2:17:15] speak men's hard feeling fulfilled you
[2:17:17] know and that is the reality of the
[2:17:19] world we live in so we want to be
[2:17:20] conscious of these things and take the
[2:17:22] opportunity not to go into panic mode
[2:17:25] and not to go to these things but to get
[2:17:26] drawn closer to Christ because in him is
[2:17:29] our safety but a random tow bar being
[2:17:31] hid in Christ and if you're hidden
[2:17:32] Christ in the work at him and find you
[2:17:34] because he'll just see Jesus oh that's
[2:17:36] my prayer my desire and all of that
[2:17:39] being said we cannot be negligent so you
[2:17:42] can't say well because of a Christian
[2:17:44] I'm not going to wash my hands because
[2:17:47] the health advisory recommends that the
[2:17:49] best treatment against these things is
[2:17:51] to do what is proper to wash your hands
[2:17:54] for at least 20 seconds count it say at
[2:17:58] least 20 seconds count it
[2:18:00] that is not 20 seconds so we want to
[2:18:04] also practice what is is the
[2:18:07] recommendations for best health practice
[2:18:09] so make sure in your daily lives because
[2:18:13] God is interested in every aspect of our
[2:18:15] lives and we don't want to be so caught
[2:18:17] up in a mountain that we walk up the
[2:18:19] mountain on a spiritual high and then
[2:18:21] and we do we do things that are not
[2:18:24] prudent so we want to be very conscious
[2:18:26] of environment that we're living in and
[2:18:28] while there's no confirmation of the
[2:18:32] virus here in Trinity be a go and we
[2:18:34] would pray certainly that it does not
[2:18:35] come we certainly want to be proactive
[2:18:37] in our approach in our thinking as a
[2:18:40] body of believers because it is not
[2:18:42] inconceivable if it comes that it would
[2:18:44] could order a quarantine ami Ayalon or
[2:18:46] they can see you know and they've
[2:18:48] already spoken that places where people
[2:18:49] assemble such as churches schools
[2:18:51] universities etc etc to put what is
[2:18:54] necessary in place and as good stewards
[2:18:56] we also have to take responsibility for
[2:18:58] that so we've already spoken about
[2:19:01] installing more hand sanitizers or
[2:19:03] different things like
[2:19:04] the tabernacle so we do what is what is
[2:19:07] what is required as well so I want to
[2:19:11] officially from from Robbie's position
[2:19:14] and the office of the pastor to also
[2:19:15] advise you to be conscious of washing
[2:19:18] your hands and avoiding touching your
[2:19:20] face on your nose and this also from a
[2:19:23] health perspective is not just about the
[2:19:24] corona virus but any virus for that
[2:19:26] matter it's just you know what some may
[2:19:28] consider basic hygiene but beyond that
[2:19:30] it's also being conscious that as these
[2:19:32] things are happening but amount of blood
[2:19:34] men grunting in their flesh and all
[2:19:36] these things we don't know what the next
[2:19:37] thing is and the next thing is that the
[2:19:38] next thing is so above all we need to
[2:19:40] get the Holy Ghost but we also want to
[2:19:43] be very conscious of doing what is what
[2:19:45] is necessary for your health so be
[2:19:47] conscious of this and you know many
[2:19:50] other churches and groups have already
[2:19:51] already advised if you are you know
[2:19:54] coughing and you obviously have some
[2:19:57] pockets of the flu or whatever whatever
[2:19:59] the same way a school would advise keep
[2:20:01] your child at home so as not to infect
[2:20:03] everybody else you know
[2:20:05] so Jesus the Centurion came to see if
[2:20:09] you could just speak the word my signal
[2:20:10] will be healed so you know you said I'm
[2:20:12] a prayer cast but you don't need to come
[2:20:14] and be coughing on on other believers
[2:20:18] who are coming into the shared space so
[2:20:21] we wanna be one exercise some wisdom in
[2:20:23] Africa as well so but of it has also
[2:20:26] requested that we be very conscious of
[2:20:29] personal contact at this time so until
[2:20:32] further notice the official position is
[2:20:35] we are asking that be that you know
[2:20:37] direct shaking of hands until we advise
[2:20:40] otherwise to bring our level of
[2:20:41] consciousness it's a precautionary
[2:20:44] measure and for many of us it's
[2:20:47] something that we do as a normal thing
[2:20:49] and it's just a practice that we want to
[2:20:52] implement in the church effective
[2:20:54] immediately so we want us to be
[2:20:56] conscious of that so
[2:21:00] yes so duty held in the international
[2:21:02] community and what is happening we want
[2:21:03] to be ahead of the curve with that as
[2:21:07] well so in that we also moving forward
[2:21:10] in feet with respect to our upcoming
[2:21:12] convention trusting God that David is
[2:21:14] his will it'll take place in the way
[2:21:16] that he wants it to as well so we want
[2:21:17] to encourage you to make all your
[2:21:20] pledges and support towards the
[2:21:21] convention and above all else friends
[2:21:24] stay in prayer stay consecrated ste
[2:21:27] sanctified because what is to come was
[2:21:30] stool to not come near those who have
[2:21:32] the mark the seal of God so you want to
[2:21:34] make sure that you know there are people
[2:21:36] who will be doing the natural things you
[2:21:38] know the washing hands and all these
[2:21:39] things but their heart is not right
[2:21:41] and if it's not this is something else
[2:21:42] is something else is something else will
[2:21:44] come but once a seal of God is upon your
[2:21:46] life you could walk out without here
[2:21:47] like poor when that servant when when
[2:21:50] that dot that sneak bit him and they
[2:21:52] were expecting him to die he shook it
[2:21:54] off because what was running through his
[2:21:56] veins was resistant to the poison that
[2:21:58] was in the snake what was it it was the
[2:22:01] Holy Ghost it was not a chemical it was
[2:22:02] not a vitamin it was the Holy Ghost
[2:22:04] itself that was coursing through his
[2:22:06] body and they have to take note that
[2:22:07] these men had been with Jesus they tried
[2:22:09] to boil him in oil and they were oil
[2:22:11] proof they tried to do what kind of
[2:22:12] thing to them what was it it was the
[2:22:14] Holy Ghost you can't destroy the Holy
[2:22:15] Ghost it it's a powerful Holy Ghost it's
[2:22:17] it's God himself in spirit form who
[2:22:20] wants to dwell in us and the church say
[2:22:22] Amen so stay on the firing line and
[2:22:25] we're looking for God to do great things
[2:22:26] in our myths amen and amen
[2:22:31] so that's that's the announcement so may
[2:22:33] the Lord's you best you ashes deacons
[2:22:40] [Music]
[2:22:47] to the cross where now
[2:22:52] [Music]
