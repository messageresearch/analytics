gracious heavenly father we thank you tonight lord that we could gather in this way lord at the beginning of this new year 2021 law we thank you for your love for your grace for your mercy to us lord we did not know a year ago that this is what have been how our our lives would have unfolded lord for 2020 and to see 20 21 lord is just unfolding and unfolding and unfolding and to see scripture being fulfilled and lord there's very little that could come to as a surprise us lord because father all of what is unfolding has been prophesied it's been spoken lord and we thank you lord that we have had the foresight through your word the insight through your word the understanding through your word lord to stand in such a time as this so lord as we lord start back these bible studies and these conversations around scripture and around your word lord we commit to these sessions and lord this one in particular as we start into your hands lord and we pray your bless us in a special way may you bless everyone that made the effort to be here tonight against all kinds of odds and challenges and responsibilities and different commitments and different stresses and struggles lord we are reporting the duty tonight so we commit this session into your hands we pray a special blessing on your people father there are so many situations i'm sure different ones are going through that they may not even share they may not even express they may not have the opportunity to confide in anyone and they bear lord the the weight of these burdens lord but you said in your word you'd never give us more than we could bear so lord we pray that god that you would strengthen our shoulders strengthen our minds strengthen our hearts lord as you said to peter father i prayed for you that your faith would feel not so father we come tonight for a strengthening of our faith for our lord our commitment and our zeal for your word and the things of god to be renewed lord and lord to shake lord shake away everything lord that is not of youth that would distract us that would take away our focus lord there's so much just happening around us that it's so easy to get distracted so father we want to take this space for the next few minutes lord to lord to remind ourselves of your goodness of your mercy lord of your presence of your power of your grace lord and also of your judgment lord and what's coming to this world that we want to look at our own lives to see how we line up with the world we want to look at our own lives and compare it lord because it's there the word is clear of how we should live how we should act how we should behave ourselves lord it's it's all through the scriptures from genesis to revelation it's all about producing a life lord father the same signs the same wonders the same attitude the law to replicate the same conditions that the promise of the holy ghost is just as real lord and lord this may be a bible study tonight but lord may conviction grip the hearts of those that need to be convicted lord for those that need to be more sincere may the word lord be shared in such a way that they would be more sincere those that have lost their zeal to hunger and to this after righteousness lord made the hunger and the this be built up tonight those that maybe desire in the holy ghost father lord may they be filled and may the desire be stronger than ever if there's a backslider in our midst tonight father lord may it be completely restored if there's someone who doesn't know you tonight may they come to know you by revelation and by experience father lord may you remind us all that you are the same yesterday today and forever so may you bless our efforts tonight and we commit the service over to you in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen well it's certainly a great privilege and an honor to be back in school uh again in these little bible study sessions uh to see how god has been so good to us to unfold his word uh and to show us through the scriptures and it is it is the inexhaustible fountain it it there's so much in there that that there's always something that you could find in scripture to encourage you to to keep you focused to lift your spirits to to help you to stay pointed at the right direction to lift your head up even though you might feel down at times and to see 20 21 so quickly come and you know i i you know the pastor allows me to preach uh the two sundays of this year thus far and uh you know the burden that i would have had and to see how all these things are unfolding before us in the natural and in the spiritual and to see that god is good you know we started this year talking about giving thanks and and being thankful uh for the trials thankful for the blessings thankful for everything because in everything the bible tells us to give thanks so we are thankful tonight that we could have another opportunity to have a conversation around the word of god and like i've always said bible studies is not really us preaching but it's really taking scripture and by the grace of god you know and by the leadership of the holy spirit rightly dividing the word that we could know how to live better how to act better and that we wouldn't be caught surprised because we would be prepared because the scripture comes for us to be prepared you know that we wouldn't be caught unawares you know and and the the challenge of today for us is the fact that if it's in the word and it's written and it's revealed so catch that here written and revealed then we have no excuses then then these these things that are written and revealed that are for us because the bible tells us those things which are revealed they belong to us you know and and when you talk about what belongs to you sometimes you don't see it as the word actually belongs to you but it really is yours and if you understand it is yours the same way you see well your car is yours or or something is yours and and because it's yours you use it a certain way when you catch in your heart that the promises of god are yours and what is revealed to us are yours and it is yours not for it to be declared that it is yours but it's yours to put to use it is yours to be effective in your life it is yours for your benefit i want us to catch that it is for our benefit because god did what he did for our benefit healing is for our benefit deliverance is for our benefit you know being having a good night's sleep is for our benefit you know the trials are for our benefit the testings are for our benefit so we want to see it as an and it is somewhat of a paradigm shift you know and i always say i i look for the practical side of this thing because i've seen so many people no scripture no quotes no mysteries but the practical application of life and seeing when you're reading newspaper you know putting on your spiritual glasses and now reading behind the headline reading behind the article and seeing that there's a spiritual world that is trying to to take control of everything that's around and has taken control in in this world led by the god of this evil age but we also understand that what where our role is and what our part to play is as a resistance to the enemy knowing that we have a work we have a ministry and our families are depending on us our loved ones are depending on us people are looking at us and they are perplexed they are confused they are wondering how in the midst of what is happening you could still stay positive i'm not saying you don't have days when you're you feel the true any towel and you don't have days when you're like oh gosh i don't know how much more can take and i have days where you feel frustrated we all have those days they all have experiences where oh boy it it feels like too much but something keeps holding us something keeps guiding us something keeps pushing us into our destiny and that is what the power of predestination is your destination is determined before you even knew you were gonna get there so we are here tonight one more time and god already knew we would be in this room tonight and that is something to be thankful for because he orchestrated this to be this way so we thank god for this and and before i go any further um last night or so um but i'm moving would have notified the ministry elders and deacons and the church leadership that brother rupert wasn't feeling too well and um getting some pains in his head and and some stroke-like symptoms and um throughout the leadership we we went into prayer and we have a note of praise tonight from brother rupert nigeria i'm thankful to god for his healing touch last night after being prayed for i had great relief from the pain i was experiencing on the left side of my head i'm also thankful to the brothers for lifting me up in prayer so before i go even further i just want to pray for him one more time also and pray for any person who is not feeling well tonight you may be going through some pain in your body uh some sickness whatever it is this is this is a call to prayer for healing because the enemy will try to attack your body uh we in a we know spiritual meeting tonight where we speak into your soul and we're dealing with your spirit and we deal with the affairs of your heart and your mind and there's also the issues of this pest house this body that is subject to the elements until there's complete redemption of it so we have our responsibility to do to deal with sickness and headaches and flus and viruses and all these things so let us bow our heads one more time in a word of prayer heavenly father lord we come once more as a church of the living god knowing the power and the authority that you place within this church lord that in your name lord we would cast out demons and sicknesses and diseases lord the same way you did when you walked in the earth and lord but uh rupert was not feeling too well and lord the prayers of your lord your brothers went up to you father and glory to see that he has been lord at ease in the pain and the condition lord we pray as a church as a body of believers tonight lord that you would complete the work in him that you have already started and that he will be completely healed completely healed from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet and if there's any son any daughter that's here on this call tonight and may ever hear this tape lord that they could grab a hole of feet lord as your prophet said so many times people ask him what happened he said it's not what i did but their feet made them whole their feet connected with a promise they feel connected with the word of god that was already done the fear connected with the price i was paid at calvary so father we want to connect law to what has already been done and we declare and proclaim healing upon your people whatever discomfort whatever virus whatever cool whatever pain whatever athletic pain whatever heart condition whatever demon of cancer whatever it might be female condition we rebuke and bind it tonight in the name of jesus christ and we pray for relief relief for your people heart condition mind condition body condition whatever it is lord that the doctors may be confused or they're trying their very best but tonight we come to the great physician knowing that you are more than able a lot to heal to completely heal your children that we could continue to fight this battle so we pray for your saints one more time we committed believers into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen so tonight i want to start uh this year um and i i am very excited um you know something else when you would get excited when people say i'm very excited normally it's like we're going out to people excited we're gonna do something and you know but i'm very excited because we we go and be going here into the world in a certain kind of way and i have a real burden i would say for the young people our burden for the younger in fate uh who um you know may not have the length of time that some of us may do in the message and then also i was sharing with baru with some time ago you know sometimes you know i remember when i think i was about 12 years old or so when i read the church ages and i think now to 12 year olds and i'm not sure how many 12 year olds you know are motivated to read the church ages you know so i don't want to take it for granted and um so i want to you know i told you whatever i was i was heading into the book of revelation because i believe i want to spend some time there with the church um with the young with the old with those who have heard it before as a reminder as an encouragement and for those who may not have spent the time that you should spend you know in studying and reading um because it is there for a purpose all scripture has a purpose you know and very random taught us so many things you know read from genesis to revelation if you don't see jesus through the bible go read it again because it's all about him it's all about his his nature his being his attributes and how he's trying to get that life to reflected in us and also deal with the works of darkness you know and i've had a burden to identify that that that that that that force of darkness and principalities and powers and these things so that we could be prepared so when it comes to us we would not be surprised and we know how to treat it and how to deal with it you know so by the grace of god if i were to have a title for this study tonight and i don't intend to be too long because i will call this the introductory class um because for students of scripture and the word there's no way we could take the book of revelation in one session and i am not going to make um statements like i made last year last year i you know i said i was going to continue certain things and it's on my heart to continue but the lord has a way he does take us down different roads so i don't want to see when part two will be or when part three will be it will be when the lord wants it to be but i do know it will be impossible for us to get into all that we want to get to do tonight but this by the grace of god tonight i want to call it a study of the book of revelation part one you know and we will see by the grace of god how many parts we get into um by the grace of god so if you have your bibles you could join me in the last book of the bible the book of revelation it's a powerful book it's a book of symbols it's a book of symbology some people love it some people run from it some people because it appears to be a lot of different things they don't know what it means and they just kind of leave it there but india is our story in the story of redemption and there's the story of the devil getting destroyed and there's a lot of things and brother branham you know what i've said there are two books in the bible that the devil hates you know hate is a strong word he hates the book of genesis and he hates the book of revelation so i believe as believers it is important for us to be fully rooted and grounded in the book of revelation and buddha branham would have extensively covered so many of these things that i cannot do justice to what the prophet would have done but by the grace of god in one humble way we're going to try to just take a few points here and there and keep digging and digging and digging until something breaks because something has to break friends you know all of this whole message and this whole this whole plan of god and the prophet and the reason he came is for someone to break up on us for us to leave here we have to leave here with power we have to leave here victorious we have to leave here as overcomers i think i preached it two sundays ago we're not leaving here barely making it we are leaving here as overcomers the bible says and it's repeated in the book of revelations many times to him that overcome it overcoming is a it's a powerful place to be as a believer as a believer your position is as overcomer you know so so we're not talking about halfway making it we're gonna talk about wondering if you're going to make it you have to get the tools to make it you have to get the training to make it if you're approaching a job and you want to be successful at a job it is extremely frustrating when you don't know what to do you don't have the guidance you have the equipment you know the people who at the job and the computer are working and they say working on that they're working and it's impossible for you to perform at your best if your computer is not working and the the lights are working and you know where they tell you where you're really supposed to be doing and you're not sure what your your role is and they're trying to make the best of it and for the most part i was sharing with somebody recently most people in their jobs people are going to work to feel enough people don't go to work to be a failure in the work people go to work trying their very best even if you're a halfway worker and you just want to get your paycheck you still want at least people to say well you you okay but you are severely crippled if your computer car boot up if your calculator not working and your job is to calculate things no matter how good you might be if your tools not in position for you to succeed you're not going to succeed and the reality is the word of god is is to equip us so we read in ephesians put on the old armor of god this is this is equipping this is tools this is this is the gear you need to fight you know this is this is what you need to take the battle to the enemy and to take a family from the enemy and to get your joy back and to go and into the enemy's camp and take back what the devil stole from you and to stool and sold from your family amen so the book of revelation you're going to start in revelation 1 from verse 1 and but the banner made it clear that this is not the revelation of of john but it is it is a revelation of jesus christ and that this is the only book if you read in the revelation of jesus christ any church jesus brother branham said this is this is the only book in the entire bible that is written by jesus himself appearing personally through a scribe so john is writing on behalf of jesus so this is the only book this is so this is a really really special book and because it is is that kind of a special book it is written in symbols and by the branham told us why it is written in symbols he said so that it would bypass the eyes of the wise and the prudent so so you have theologians for years you know how many documentaries and books that have on the book of revelation that way way way off for centuries people try to figure this thing out and that's why we have to be so thankful for the ministry of malachi 4 the ministry of of of revelation 10 7 the ministry of saint luke 17 30 the ministry of this great elijah messenger of malachi 4 william branham who could shine light and give us real clarity on what everything means so we are not guessing we're not wondering we're not trying to put pieces together but we understand what it is so by the grace of the god we want to take some verses in here and we'll see how far we we we're going to go and if the lord wills we'll continue in future sessions so the book of revelation 1 1 starts with the revelation of jesus christ and right there alone is is pause right there because brother branham spend length talking about the power of revelation and the revelation of jesus christ and the church is built on revelation and you would have referenced matthew 16 who do men say that i am these things we know or we should know but by the brandon was making a statement of we cannot underestimate the importance of revelation you know he said and and i want to kind of quote a couple of things from the prophet he said the importance of a revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be over emphasized so but abandoned was also typed in that when this book of revelation was being written that john was in the spirit and the only way you could process this book of revelation is you also have to be in the spirit so while we could read and we could pull verses and we can understand what things mean i want us to be very careful because this book is not like other books of the bible so when we're approaching this this is a whole different thing here right so the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signify it by his angel unto his servant john that's the first verse powerful verse now in the amplified i want to read it in the amplified because the amplified picks up a few things it highlights a few things that i want us to catch because the book of revelation as you know goes all the way to uh to to the spirit and he brides it come and it goes all the way and deal with the beast and he vials and he plagues and he wars and the bottomless pit and there's a lot and we're going to touch on many of these things as we help the in particularly younger believers and the young people understand these things right so in the father said this is the revelation of jesus christ and the amplified said his unveiling of the divine mysteries so i think this is significant because this is the unveiling of the divine mysteries and by the branham use the same reference of the unveiling or the uncovering or the revealing of what was previously hidden he said now the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of christ but it is the revelation of his future works in the oncoming seven church ages so in other words as jesus is bringing this message through john this book of revelation is really the whole story of what is to unfold so this is why when we preach in the pulpit of these things unfolding now have already been prophesied they have only already been written if you don't have one spiritual eyes and understand where we're getting it from you will look and you're living in this world thinking it's normal but the reality is there's nothing new under the sun and everything that is happening has a place in scripture so when you can identify it in scripture and now have a true revelation of the ground you're standing on then nobody could confuse you nobody could deceive you nobody could say something to you that throw you off and you can't believe anymore and you're feeling to backslide and they don't know where you're standing and these things now become become it's foolishness to you because you are grounded by revelation not just any revelation but the revelation of jesus christ so i just want to continue with here this is your revelation i'm in the amplified still on on verse one of jesus christ his unveiling so he is the one doing the unveiling his unveiling of the divine mysteries which god the father gave to him to show to his bond servants which is what the believers are the things which must soon take place in their entirety and he sent and communicated it by his angel divine messenger to his bond servant john all right now let's go into verse two king james vision who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ of all things that he saw so john is communicating in this book everything that he saw all right so this is foundational everybody should have an understanding of this now let's start a bill and see how god even layers promises in this thing blessed verse three blessed now hold on before i go to victory i want to touch and i like touching the amplified because the amplified give some body to this thing right speaking about john who testified and gave supporting evidence this is how the amplifier says supporting evidence to the word of god and to the testimony of jesus christ even to everything that he saw in his visions and now verse 3 blessed is he and read it so the fact tonight that you read in this has a blessing tied to reading it blessed is he that read it so there's a blessing just by reading it there's a comma so it goes on and there that hear the words of this prophecy so there's a blessing for those that read it there's a blessing for those that hear it and it goes on and keep those things that are written therein so it is a blessing for those that keep it now you you you would realize that this is building to the level of involvement because you can read it and you already possess it you can hear it so there's still a blessing there but most importantly and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand all right so i want to i want to read this now with the amplified it said blessed happy prosperous to be admired i like that happy prosperous to be admired is he who reads and those that hear the words of the prophecy and who keep the things which are written in it healing them and taking them to heart for the time of fulfillment is near now friends if you don't know and don't understand and you don't hear and you don't read and you don't keep them into heart and keep those things how can you keep what you don't know think about it how can you keep in your heart what you haven't spent time trying to understand because if god is unfolding his whole plan his whole divine mystery his whole program in this thing isn't it important for us to be really clear on what these symbols mean and what this thing mean and how it relates to you how it relates to me how it relates to the enemy can the church say amen all right so let's let's begin to build so i just want to take a point here from the prophet in that section on on on on verses one to three that i just read but ibraham is saying it is a revelation because the disciples themselves didn't know these recorded truths it had not been previously reviewed to them so he's saying but now after his death after jesus death and resurrection and at this particular time in his mediatorial ministry he is able to set forth in this revelation of himself to john what his glory and presence in the church would mean and do and and we keep preaching it it have churches have all kind of churches in them but if there's no presence of god in the church then what is that this is not we're not trying to have a membership we're not trying to have a social gathering we're trying to have a group you know what other things people could be doing this evening but we really want to understand how god is moving in this hour what is he doing what is he trying to achieve what is god trying to achieve in every service what is god trying to achieve in this study tonight what does god want us to know what are we preparing for what stones have been uncovered that we need to know get into our hearts so we can guard these things with our hearts anybody with me all right but ibrahim goes on in this revelation we're still building here and this is the prophet was also teaching this as well he tells us what the end of the devil is so the end of the devil we preach all the time satan finished he devils over but the end of the devil is in this book he tells us how he's going to deal with the devil cast him into the lake of fire he reveals the end of the wicked ones who follow satan and satan hates that i'm quoting the prophet have you ever noticed how satan hates two books of the bible more than all others through liberal theologians and pseudo-scientists he's always attacking the book of genesis and the book of revelation in both of these books we find satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction that is why he attacks them he hates to be exposed and in those books he's exposed for exactly what he is so the book of revelation exposes it and covers satan and when we begin to pull out of this and begin to identify where he is at and identify where the power of the church lies then satan is finished but ibraham said the moment the bride gets to know who she is then the rapture will take place so all of this is for us having a clear picture of who we are where we come from where we're going what we supposed to know what we supposed to have the power that is in us and what we're supposed to achieve listen to this when the church disbelieves satan listen carefully this is the prophet when the church disbelieves satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the gates of hell cannot prevail against us that is so powerful because the reality is satan is preaching you know let me say it one more time satan is preaching satan preaches his ideas his form of worship satan preaches how you should behave how he should act he do it in pulpits you do it outside the pulpits he use all kind of different influences to try to get his message so it's a war of a communication of messages there are many messages but i'm typing there are many influences there are many voices but branham said but there's one true voice satan will not stop talking he will not stop trying to influence you he will not stop trying to pull your attention but you have to keep focus on that still small voice everybody with me all right so let's go on verse 4 we're not going to be too long tonight just laying a foundation for us to get into the deeper things john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne i love that john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from these seven spirits which are before his soon and the prophet said it so beautifully he said now all these expressions him which is which was which is to come and fearful witness and first born and i'm gonna read among and all it's the same one it's the lord jesus christ isn't that so powerful all right and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead first begotten of the dead that is the first one who come back from the dead meaning it had more who would come from the dead it had more who would experience resurrection hallelujah and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his blood this verse alone is a verse to show because this this speaks jesus is describing himself through john to make it clear that he's the authority hallelujah from him which is present tense which was always was which is to come hallelujah brother branham said what is time to him time is nothing he's eternal and if you understand that he's eternal and you are an attribute of him that you are also eternal that you also had no beginning that you also have no ending hallelujah that you just passing through to have a testimony while you're here that you are not going to be deceived and you're going to recognize who you are and find a secret message with your name on it what a reason to shout what a reason to shout can you truth say man all right so we going we're building we're building we're building and we're going somewhere all right verse six and have made us and and and just and just to really say i want to i want to pull this from the amplified as well and to pull something a few things that the prophet said as well still looking at four on five right so john to the seven churches that are in the province of asia and better branham typed out that these were this was asia minor and that these seven physical churches were matching the characteristics or the nature or the attributes of seven church ages that would also be dispensational meaning over time so the physical churches that were there at that time were reflections of or mirror images of the similar and not to me the behavior the characteristics the qualities of the people who would exist over a certain period of time which we know the seven church ages all right so i i want to highlight here now grace be granted to you and peace listen to the amplified inner calm and spiritual well-being we talked in one of the bible saying about having good sleep and rest and in a calm but i ran a pitch why are we so tossed about he said well letting all the pressure but this whole thing is about bringing peace in a calm and spiritual well-being we're not supposed to be shaken by every news and everything that happened you get a fat tire naturally off your food born and that troy off and all simple things just you that but but peace and inner calm god give us some peace and some inner calm in this neurotic world that we live in from him the peace coming from him who is existing forever and who was continually existing in the past and who is to come and from the seven spirits that are before his throne we're going to talk about those seven spirits before the truth and from jesus christ the faithful and trustworthy witness the first born of the dead and ruler of the kings of the ut to him who always loves us and who has once and for all and this is where they want to get at freed us or washed us so it said wash us but ibrahim said that washed us actually means loosed so it's not just like i don't see that's washing but he said he loosed us from our sins broke us free from our sins freed us from our sins by his own blood and formed us into our kingdom hallelujah is that the reason to be excited it's not a reason to be excited to know that his blood is not just washed but loosed a separation a separation from your sin a separation from your mistakes a separation from your past from the seven spirits which are before his throne and by the branham went in to explain that and brought out all these seven spirits he said those seven spirits that same phrase you can find it four times in the book of revelation revelation 1 4 from the seven spirits which are before his throne it's in revelation 3 1 these things say that he that had the seven spirits revelation 4 5 and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god revelation 5 6 and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders instead of as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into holy ut so but abraham say these seven spirits is not to teach a doctrine against the one holy spirit but these seven spirits which are also called the lamps of fire burning before the lord since john always used old testament symbols in writing his book of revelation he said that the seven spirits are found to be associated with man john the baptist was called a burning light which should actually translate into burning lamp in revelation 5 6 the seventh spirit identifies as seven eyes from zechariah for who are despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet and he handles the rover well with those those seven they are the eyes of the lord it is very evident that the word there refers to men thus we see and i'm reading the prophet here that the eyes of the lord in this incident are men of course they will be anointed men full of the holy ghost for god's ministries and not in the power of men but of the holy ghost putting our spiritual discoveries together so whatever i'm saying is listen is we we we we hunt in here to connect the pieces to see what these symbols mean it is evident that the seven spirits of god refer to the continuous ministry of the same holy spirit in the lives of seven men with whom god identifies himself very closely they are his eyes they are his lamps and who these seven men are can easily be seen because the next phrase calls them the seven stars we'll see later on so we see that these seven spirits actually refer to the one spirit of god working out the will and word of god in different generations so what are we talking about paul irenaeus martin columba luther wesley and our own prophet so when you understand in scripture the way these things are placed how could somebody throw you off and how somebody could displace where the prophet is placed in your heart and and how important it is so it's not just simple as see what he tfc this is the spirits of god and the stars of god the eyes of god the lambs of this thing am i the only one as excited about how powerful this thing is i want us to realize that god put this thing so beautifully that that is why satan is so mad there's no room for the devil to move between this this thing you know because you cannot impersonate this you can't want to be this you can't try to be this you have to be called to this thing anybody with me all right and verse six i love verse six verse six and he said and half made us kings and priests in the amplified it said formed us formed us so it means that if this is not you doing this thing no anybody with me this is not you trying to be a king this is not you trying to be a priest this is not me trying to be a king this is not me trying to be a priest but he formed us he taken control of his destiny he is forming us he's shaping us he's transforming us hallelujah but ibrahim said he hath made us he's the one doing it he said salvation of the lord he redeemed us for purpose he bought us for purpose we are kings spiritual kings we are going to be kings upon the earth with him when he sits on this throne but now we are spiritual kings and we reign over spiritual kingdoms that is no you hear that no you are spiritual kings hallelujah there's an earthly kingship coming when we read an earth but even now you're a spiritual king do you realize you're spiritual king i don't think many of you realize that you're a spiritual king you know because as a spiritual king ever a certain authority as a spiritual king you have a dominion as a spiritual king you have a domain as a spiritual thing you have authority there's an earthly kingship of reigning on the earth but even now you are recognized because he ha that's past tense made us he has done it without consulting anybody without asking for permission without seeing if you're good you're bad this is this here he already did it so whether you like it or not he had already made you into a king and a priest something that in the older days was never possible and we preached on this before because the line of the kings was different from the line of the priests the priests came out of the line of levites kings came out of the regal line of the outer line of judah it was very unlikely almost impossible to find a priest and a king but when jesus came hallelujah he merged the lines and in him was priests in him was king and because of him he now has the authority to create more like him and true john he's saying he already did it so when the devil thought jesus was the only one here it is we're seeing that god already did it and that i'm speaking tonight to kings and priests together kings and priests do you accept your kingship do you accept your priesthood do you accept and realize that as priests you're offering brother say spiritual praise of sanctified lips spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him i'm quoting the prophet your life become an offering do you live your life as an offering could you offer all you are to god as a sweet offering sweet offering i know that means animosity you can't offer your jealousy and your envy and your bad behavior your cow for that but your life's sweet your life itself is a fragrance hallelujah well i said i could i could close up right here right now worship him worshipping him in spirit and in truth listen to the prophet this is just the unmade us pre-spot we still in verse six have made us kings and priests and by the random going in on this free spot he said i made us priests yes whatever i'm saying priests unto him offering the spiritual praise of sanctified lips you only want to dig deeper into that let me are your lips sanctified what have you been talking about this week oh help us lord what have you been what have you been talking about what what what what coming out your mouth are you all lip sync do you find that when people when people pull the recorder of your life huh and play back oh help us jesus they're feeling good in here tonight you know feel like we haven't having bible study pre-offering the spiritual praise of sanctified lips spending our lives as a sweet offering lord help me to live that spending our lives as a sweet offering you see the magnitude we still in verse six in them spending our lives that is our everyday thing you know spending your life as a sweet offering i'm reading the prophet unto him worshiping him in spirit and in truth interceding interceding means you're standing in a gap you have a burden for somebody so somebody not well but but you have a burden you're interceding you're standing here god for your children they don't even know you're praying for them you see somebody looking at it on you you're interceding for them you see somebody come out in a while you intercede you have a burden with them and petitioning you sending requests requests that people see and requested will not even see it but that is the priestly part of your ministry and that's all of us that is not the pastor that is not the elder that is all of us priests and kings unto our god no wonder the prophet said the world doesn't appeal to us and we are a peculiar people zealous unto good words works we have been recreated that's the forming part we have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father hallelujah help us tonight lord so we stood in verse six and had made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen everybody with me so far we're going to verse 7 behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and we'll realize that in the book of revelation everything has meaning there's no word in the book of revelation i don't have a specific meaning behold he come in with a clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen but abraham said in speaking about this specific verse he said he is coming jesus is coming god is coming the prophet is coming the priest and king is coming the all and all is coming even so lord jesus come quickly amen he is coming he is coming in clouds clouds of glory as when he was seen upon the mount of transfiguration and his garments were shining as the power of god unfolded him and every eye shall he see him that means this is not the rapture that we're talking about here this is when he comes to take over his rightful place as world ruler so we look at the first chapter of revelation already places and speaks of the rulership of jesus and coming back in power this is when listen to the prophet those who have pierced him with their creeds and denominational doctrine shall mourn and all the people shall wail in terror because of him who is the wood anybody with me so far amen glory let's go on to verse eight just just before that sorry let me just read it from the amplified to pull out another point here the holy is coming with the clouds and every eye will see him even those who pierced him and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over him listen to carefulness realizing their sin and guilt because at that point they will realize that they had rejected the truth realizing their sin again and anticipating listen this the coming round so they finally realized but wait a minute i had a chance at opportunity i didn't do anything about it no i have to give an account and this happens to everybody every i will see so it shall be all right verse 8 i am the alpha and omega the beginning and the ending sea of the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty now let's go i john so john's i think they testify now who also am your brother one and companion in tribulation two and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ i want to pause here for a minute so but iran was saying and you know sometimes people are saying they're having a hard time and and having a tough time and i get it we have tough times but this is not actual this man john was in the isle of patmos which is a prison colony for a specific reason for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ anybody come to your house and carry you and put you in prison because you believed you would listen to the prophet on this this series of visions of the revelation of the person of jesus christ was given to john while he was banished to the isle of patmos it have some people they get a little trial they kind of sing a song something go wrong and the song they even turn over music something go wrong and you can get a squeaker praise but while he was banished to the isle of patmos this small island is 30 miles this is a profit off the coast of asia minor in the aegean sea listen being rocky and infested with snakes lizards and scorpions it had little commercial value so it was used by the roman empire for a penal colony or prison colony where will house the more desperate criminals political prisoners etc you will notice that john has addressed himself to the christians as a brother in tribulation it was at this time that the early church was going through great persecutions their religion was not only everywhere spoken against so this is not just people talking that you believe something that that that but the people themselves were imprisoned and killed you see how much how different it is for us now you think tonight if if they were to come tonight to your house and actually if you believe you're going to prison anybody want to argue an activist should raise their hands but i wonder how many people tonight would say are you ready to go you know i'm hoping that everybody would say they're already ready because they believe but you have people because listen look how this thing is there peter's denial denial of christ was when they accused him of being with jesus you know and peter before he was committed sinners so denial you know sometimes people don't know they always say you don't know under whatever pressure what people can already do yeah yeah that kind of thing under what pressure under what situation you know it and it really takes pressure to show who you really are peter didn't anticipate that he would have been i want to be very careful saying he's so weak when confronted with his testimony you know because after because the lord told peter you're going to deny me and peter did not believe him i'll wait again it is so it should not have come to a surprise to peter so peter actually shocked his own self i want you to catch something here because the lord told peter you will deny me and peter say never happen so this is why after he denied and here he caught crew he wept bitterly because he came and into a confrontation with something in him a certain level of weakness in him that he didn't realize that he had anybody anybody with me so i want us to understand that you haven't seen pressure for the cause of your testimony you haven't seen it you haven't seen the kind of persecution that that philosophy would have gone through nobody come and say because they believe the bible look recently i saw somebody a church in the u.s put up an announcement they say very soon our preaching will be called hate speech so we will not be able to broadcast the way we did before when that time comes because if you read the scripture about certain issues no it is called call hate speech can you stand to defend what you believe so i want to escalate us now to john's condition his situation his challenge what he is dealing with and yet still he can find himself in the spirit so listen to the prophet continuing john like multitudes of others was now suffering imprisonment for the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ when arrested they tried in vain to kill him by boiling him in oil for 24 hours [Music] hey nice nice nice brother pop well i was driving in the car today thinking about this thing right and i said boiling in oil my picture of boiling in oil is like saying fry go when something boiling you see bubbling so i said them trying to fry jon boy i said but i just said but it's friday try to fry john and when they try to scoop john i reckon i joined a friend it's boiling boiling oil and recognized but this money boiling whatever this man into could you imagine in the midst of that god still preserved what a mighty god we serve that had to be one of the most confusing experiences in that day you know but we put a man in there we lied eating the oil boiling we put john inside and john still come outside smiling say a prisoner of the lord fellow servant and listen you don't think god will defend you when you need to be defended you don't think god will protect you when if you stand for him he promises stand for you have some guts have some courage have some strength to have a testimony it doesn't matter what the opposition is have a testimony hallelujah listen when arrested they tried i'm reading from the prophet when arrested the child and veeam to kill him by boiling him in oil for 24 hours the enraged and powerless officials then sentence him to patmos as a witch so this is how john even end up in patmos but god was with him could somebody say the lord has been with you with you through your trials with you through your testing with you every situation all of us most people i know who who who believe this thing could tell you how much time the devil tried to kill them they were trying to think all kind of situation you could look back and see how did they take you out and i see there was approach when moses was born he tried to kill when jesus was born that says nature through your life you have all kind of situations all kind of things nearly happen you're almost getting an accident you're almost thinking the thing you're all connecting happen and you see but it was the lord keeping you all the time because there's a purpose for your life and you have to believe that and walk in now can you church say amen but god was with him and he was spared to leave the island and return to ephesus where he gave where he continued as pastor until the time of his death so the visions were ibrahim said that john received covered a period of two years 1895 to 96 and they are the most remarkable of all visions in the world so what we're reading here in the book of revelation is the most remarkable of all visions in all of the world the entire book is set forth in symbols and therefore is the target of much criticism and dispute however it does have the seal of god upon it i'm reading the prophet's word right so i john who also am your brother and companion and tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the aisle that is called pacmus for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ verse 10 i was in a spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of our trumpet and but abraham said i was in the spirit isn't this that just beautiful my i love that you could just call those words the whole of the christian life if we are going to live as christians we have to be in his spirit john was not talking about being in his own spirit that would not have brought these visions it had to be the spirit of god it has to be the spirit of god with us too for all our efforts are in vain paul said i will pray in the spirit i will sing in the spirit i will live in the spirit if there is anything good that will come to be it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results it bears as surely as john needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous revelations fresh from jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that god has given to us to live by in his word for it is the same spirit and that is why so many times you see us emphasizing being spirit worship create an atmosphere and this is why we say it i can't understand how you could be in this message and read the same quote and be dead it it your match don't add up this thing is too good when you see the context of this you have to be in the spirit whether you understand everything or not you have to be in the spirit because only when in the spirit and by the brandon went on in this same message talking about if you spirit the ball game and spiritually dance and whatever it is if you're not in the spirit of something you can't get into it and friends now more than ever we have to be the spirit of the coming of the lord we have to be the spirit of where we are going we are leaving this place we have to be the spirit of heavenly places we have to be the spirit and come up hither as john was called to come up hither because we live in this world behind we cannot be in the spirit of the things of the world we cannot be the spirit of of trying to do this and trying to do that we have to be in the spirit of the lord john said i was in the spirit we're still on verse 10 on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet and brother branham said that as of a trumpet is not it wasn't a trumpet it was as of a trumpet and he was typing it as when a trumpet is blown it is blown with urgency it is blown to call your attention it is blown for it to be something that is urgent for you to pay attention wait to realize that that is a that is a serious a serious time here all right everybody with me all right so saying so this is the voice as of what trump is saying verse 11 i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto these seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus and unto smyrna and unto pergamos and onto tyre tyra and onto sardis and unto philadelphia and until laodicea and i turned to see the voice that speak with me and but ibrahim said he didn't seem to see the person who had a voice he said because he voices the person he's like tend to see the voice that speak with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks everybody with me tonight students of the world will know what the candidates represent it is said low down in scripture but the golden candlesticks are the church ages are the churches the seven are the actual churches and in the midst verse 13 in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man like unto the son of man and i want to kind of kind of hone in on this path and we get ready to close out for tonight i trust the young people being blessed i trust that those who know this being reminded and is a refresher for you and i trust again some inspiration from this tonight we're looking at verse 13 here and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man so it's a likeness of the son of man but he is clothed with a garment down to the foot and good about the pups with a golden girdle verse 14 his head and his ears were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as flames of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a fullness and his voice as the sound of many waters i want to read this one more time and then we're going to take our time and go through the symbology so we are clear on what it is all right we're going to take it from verse 12 again and we're going to go down to verse 15. and i turned to see the voice that speak with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle six and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like under the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and good about the pups with a golden girdle his head and his ears were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like under fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as a sound of many waters and by the branham taught us that every single one of these things means something so we want to make sure we all understand what these things mean tonight but abraham said how deeply moving and inspiring was the appearing of jesus to john who was in exile for the cause of the wood and behold the living word now stands before him what an illuminating vision for every descriptive attribute has a significance what a revelation of his glorious being john first notices and mentions the whiteness of his hair it was white as bright as snow this was not because of his age oh no the brilliantly white here does not signify age but experience maturity and wisdom the eternal one does not age what is time to god time means little to god but wisdom means much remember we had teachings on with on wisdom last year right it is as when solomon called to god for wisdom to judge the people of israel now he is coming the judge of hollywood he will be crowned with wisdom and that is what the white here signifies but the brandon said even the world understands this symbology for in ancient times the judge would appear and convene court dressed in a white wig and a long robe that signified his complete authority head-to-foot robe to meet our justice so but ibanez type in here that this is no longer the the priestly role that he's in here now he said he said this is the role of judgment and not just the here white as well but he said think of it those eyes we just read it here his eyes were as a flame of fire think of it and young people i want to catch this because this is important because this is the season this is the time this is all of the pieces coming together here now think of it those eyes that were once dimmed this isn't the holy prophet breaking it out tears of sorrow and pity those eyes that wept with compassion at the grave of lazarus so brother branham now is breaking out what john is also seeing here the eyes that wept at the grave of lazarus in pity and sorrow those eyes that saw not the evil of the murderers who hanged on the cross but in sorrow cried father forgive them now those eyes are a flame of fire the eyes of the judge who will recompense those who rejected him now understand this this issue of judgment and this issue of the eyes of fire look how the prophet placed it for those who rejected him of all the human emotions he manifested the most when he appeared as the son of man was this one he wept often yet behind that weeping and that sorrow there was still god those same eyes saw visions they looked deep within the hearts of men and read their very thoughts and knew all their various ways blazing out of mortal eyes was god who cried to those who knew him not for what he was like jeremiah of old so but the branham is painting this picture now of this one like unto the son of man who we know is christ he's talking about but his role has changed his responsibility has changed what he's about to do has changed is not like when he was here in ut this is him in his office of a judge he said like jeremiah of old he was the weeping prophet for men receive not the word of god and that's why we are preaching about going all the way taking all the word living the entire life stopping the foolishness because he was the weeping prophet for men receive not the word of god and thrust aside in revelation those fiery flaming eyes of the judge are even now listen carefully recording the lives of all flesh we preached about it two weeks ago about your life being recorded so you see in those eyes is what is seeing you seeing eyes of god you're seeing eyes of jesus is recording all all the activity running to and fro throughout the earth there is nothing he does not know god help us tonight in whatever condition we are in to see the seriousness of the hour to understand the context we haven't even we're still in chapter one you know of this great unfolding mystery but here it will be taking time to see how this thing unfolds and what each thing means what it signifies the impact on our lives how it should make us live differently that those fiery flaming eyes but about him said there's nothing he doesn't know he knows the desires of the heart and what each one intends to do there's nothing hidden that shall not be revealed for all things are naked before him with whom we have to do think of it he knows even now what you're thinking anybody with me tonight yes but ibanum said there he stands as judge with flaming eyes to meet our judgment the day of mercy is over oh but abraham said that men would repent and seek his face in righteousness while there is yet time that they might make his bosom their pillow here the world dissolves in fire everybody with me so we touch on the here white as wool we touch on the eyes as a flame of fire and only last one in verse 15 and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a fullness what does that mean amber branham goes into it he said on his feet like on defined brass as if they burned in a furnace he said brass is noted for its remarkable hardness there's nothing that is known that you can put with it to temper it but this brass that is describing his feet is more remarkable yet in that it has stood the test of the fiery furnace a test that no other one has gone through and that is exactly right for this brass signifies divine judgment a judgment that god decreed and brought to pass so let's get closer to what it means now he said but someday those feet of brass will stand upon the earth and the judge of holy earth he shall be with equity and perfection he will judge mankind and listen to what the brass signifies now so we know he's judged be right here we know the clothes we understand the eyes the flaming eyes the eyes of fire that's seeing everything so he's not judging from a position of not knowing he knows all even the very thoughts even very intense but this this this this brass feet fine brass he said and there will be no evading that judgment no turning of that justice there will be no tempering of it so in other words what this signifies is you know there are situations where a judge could be lenient in law there are situations where if it's a first offense you could get off a little bit easier if it's a second offense the judge had the discretion to be a little firmer with it the judge has the latitude of which to operate but in this context here this judge this brass what it means is there's no turning of that justice so there's no letting off the hook there's no well because it's you you're not gonna die i'm gonna let you live out your time this is full justice being dispensed this is this is what we're talking about here no turning of that justice there will be no tempering of it no softening of it anybody with me and look how better abandon places it he rather than just will be unjust still it's set here that is filthy filthy still yuka sweet talk the judge you can't bribe the judge you can't nobody could bring a good word for you well you're used to helping church plenty you had nice ways you never really you you really wasn't generally speaking as a good person you always believe do good unto them and the golden rule this is not that the judge has to operate under a certain approach and this approach is one where there's no tempering it's filthy filthy still righteous you go over there filthy you go over there you have no small talk to explain why they do what you're doing and why i went into adultery and why you cheat and why a lie and why and there's no explanation here now it's fine brass temple and fire judgment being dispatched he that is unjust unjust still he let his filthy filthy self the unchanging one will not change then for he never has and ever will those feet of brass will crush the enemy they will destroy the antichrist the beast and the image and all that is vile in his sight he will destroy the church systems this is this feat of brazil destroy the church system that has taken his name only to corrupt its brilliance and cross them along with the antichrist all the wicked the atheists the agnostics the modernists the liberals will all be there look how look how the significance of what iran are bringing out there death hell and the grave will be there yes they will for when he comes the books will be opened this is when even the lukewarm church and the five foolish virgins will appear he will separate the sheep from the goat when he comes he will take over the kingdom for it is his and with him will be thousand times ten thousand his bride will come to minister to him anybody with me so far and the last part of that and his voice as the sound of many waters his voice was as a sound of multitude speaking young people you with me and i want to encourage you young people parents encourage your children to be part of these bible studies don't take it for granted they feed in their minds with all kinds of let them settle down sit down and pay attention because this is eternal life we talking about the last attribute here that we read in verse 15 his feet like onto fine brass as if they burn in her fullness and his voice at the sound of many waters his voice was a son of a multitude speaking what is it it is the judgment for these listen are the voices of the multitudes of witnesses who by the holy spirit all through the ages have testified to christ and preaches gospel it will be the voice of every man rising in judgment against the sinner who would not take warning we building here the voices of the seven messengers will be heard loud and clear those faithful preachers who preached the saving power of jesus who preached water baptism in jesus name who preached the infilling and power of the holy ghost who stood with the word more than they stood with their own lives all of them were the voice of jesus christ by the holy ghost down through the ages so this voice of many waters that he's speaking with is all combined is there it's all the preachers song leaders testimonies prophets apostles all to the ages who had something to say to lift the name jesus higher and to speak against sin but ibn said have you ever thought how terrifying it is to a man drifting helplessly towards a cataract think now of that roar as he approaches his shore and sit in doom just exactly like that is coming the day of judgment when the roar of the multitude of voices condemns you for not having paid heed before it was too late take heed this very hour for at this moment your thoughts are being recorded in heaven in other words this bible study the voice of this study is part of that is part of that sound of many waters every service you go to where the truth is preach is part of that voice as the song of many waters all of the opportunities so when somebody comes and and is in the presence and you see the judge you you actually hearing all of the voices that would have actually told you turn your life around stop doing what you're doing get right with god as a voice are you saying of a cataract or this is like a waterfall are you and you're getting closer to the judgment but you're understanding why why are being judged because you were given the opportunity to get your life right with god you were given the opportunity to tell your life around every service friend don't take it for granted don't make it a light thing don't make it a a a simple thing and verse 16. let's try the final place to close up my time is already up and he had in his right hand seven stars he has preached it all the time he's seven stars he's seven the seven messengers i would talk about brother branham was a star in the right hand of god and i'm type of that that that that that right hand is is authority that right hand is power so the stanley right hand of god is very authority the very authority of god the very power of god anybody with me hallelujah there he is with these seven stars in it right then the right hand or arm signifies the power and authority of god they go forth this signifies that the very power and authority of god are behind his messengers to every age people who want to speak against the prophet they have to be very careful dangerous wrong because they go forth in the fire and power of the holy ghost with the word they are stars because they reflect light the light they reflect is his light they have no light of their own they kindle not their own fires that men may walk in the light of their sparks hallelujah these seven messengers are making god known to the people amen we're sick and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp to red sword which you know he's a word and his countenance as the sunshine in his strength i'm going to just kind of close this off here and then we could continue some of the time and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his hand his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of death and hell write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter the mystery of the seven stars which thou saw is in my right hand and the seven goal on candlesticks the seven stars are the angels we know as messengers of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thousands are the seven churches may the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word in this little introduction of the book of revelation i trust that it
