[33:56] in
[33:57] two parts if i say use two parts this
[33:59] first part i have some comments
[34:01] and something i'd like to share and then
[34:02] we'll go into what we have
[34:05] to share with you this morning so god
[34:07] bless you
[34:08] so i would like you uh you have your
[34:11] bibles to turn it to
[34:12] second kings chapter seven we want to
[34:16] read
[34:16] from verse one
[34:20] to twenty second kings
[34:27] verse second kings chapter seven
[34:31] reading from verse one
[34:34] then elisha said hear ye the word of the
[34:36] lord thus saith the lord tomorrow
[34:39] above this time shall a measure of fine
[34:41] flower be sold for a shekel
[34:43] and two measures of bali for a shackle
[34:45] in the gate of samaria
[34:47] then a lord on whose hand the king
[34:51] leaned
[34:52] answered the man of god said behold if
[34:54] the lord would make windows in heaven
[34:56] might this thing be
[34:57] so he's making a mockery and he said
[34:59] behold
[35:01] thou shalt see it with nine eyes shall
[35:04] not eat thereof
[35:05] so this is something being pronounced by
[35:08] the prophet elisha
[35:09] as seemingly something impossible
[35:11] because they were surrounded they were
[35:13] starving they were hungry
[35:16] verse 3 and there were four leprous men
[35:20] at the entering in of the gate
[35:23] and they said one to another why sit be
[35:25] here
[35:26] until we die if we say
[35:30] we will enter into the city then the
[35:33] families in the city
[35:34] we shall die there if we sit still here
[35:39] we die also now therefore come
[35:43] let us fall into the hosts of the
[35:45] syrians
[35:46] if they save us alive we shall live and
[35:50] if they kill us
[35:51] we shall but die and the rules up in the
[35:54] twilight to go up into the camp of the
[35:56] syrians
[35:57] and when they would come to the
[35:58] uttermost part part of the camp of the
[36:00] syria behold
[36:02] there was no man there for the lord had
[36:05] made the host of the syrians
[36:07] to hear noise of chariots a noise of
[36:09] horses
[36:10] even the noise of a great host and they
[36:13] said one to another lo
[36:14] the king of israel had hired against us
[36:16] the kings of the hittites
[36:17] the kings of the egyptians to come upon
[36:19] us wherefore they arose and fled in the
[36:21] twilight and left their tents
[36:23] and their horses and their asses even
[36:26] the camp as it was
[36:27] and fled for their life and when these
[36:30] leopards
[36:31] came to the uttermost part of the camp
[36:33] they went into one tent
[36:35] did eat and drink carried then silver
[36:37] and gold and rain meant went and hid it
[36:39] came again
[36:40] entered another tent carried dents also
[36:42] and went and hid it
[36:44] then they said one to another we do not
[36:46] well
[36:47] this day is a day of good tidings we
[36:50] hold our peace if we tarry till morning
[36:52] like
[36:52] some mischief will come upon us now
[36:54] therefore come
[36:55] that we may go and tell the king's
[36:57] household so they came and called unto
[36:59] the porter of the city
[37:00] and they told them saying we came to the
[37:02] camp of the syrians and behold
[37:04] there was no man dear neither voice of
[37:06] man but horses tied arses tied tents as
[37:09] they were
[37:10] and they called the porters and they
[37:11] tore it to the king's house with him
[37:13] and the king arose in the ninth and
[37:14] seventeen servants i will now show you
[37:17] what the syrians have done to us they
[37:19] know that we be hungry
[37:20] therefore they are gone up out of the
[37:22] camp they hide themselves in the field
[37:24] saying
[37:24] when they come out of the city we shall
[37:26] catch them alive and get into the city
[37:29] one of his servants answered and said
[37:30] let some take i praise thee
[37:32] five of the horses that remain which are
[37:35] left in the city
[37:36] behold there is a multitude of israel
[37:38] that are left in the
[37:39] behold i say they are all as the
[37:41] multitude of the israelites
[37:43] that are consumed let us send and see
[37:46] they took therefore two chariot horses
[37:47] and the king sent after
[37:49] the host of the syrians saying go and
[37:51] see and they went after them unto jordan
[37:53] and lo
[37:54] all the way was full of garments and
[37:56] vessels
[37:57] which assyrians had cast away in the
[37:58] haste and the messengers returned and
[38:00] told the king
[38:01] and the people went out and spoke and
[38:04] spoiled the tents of the syrian
[38:05] so a measure of fine flow a soul for a
[38:08] shekel
[38:08] and two measures of value for a shekel
[38:10] according hallelujah
[38:12] to the word of the lord and the king
[38:14] appointed the lord
[38:15] the king appointed the lord
[38:18] on whose hand he leaned to have charge
[38:20] of the gate
[38:21] and the people throwed upon him in the
[38:23] gate and he died
[38:25] as the man of god had said who speak
[38:27] when the king
[38:28] came down to him and it came to pass
[38:32] as the man of god had spoken to the king
[38:34] saying two measures of valley for a
[38:35] shekel
[38:36] and a measure of fine flower for a
[38:38] shekel shall be tomorrow about his time
[38:40] in the gate of samaria
[38:42] and the lord answered the man of god and
[38:44] said now behold
[38:46] if the lord should make windows in
[38:48] heaven might such a thing be
[38:49] and he said behold thou shalt see it
[38:51] with an eyes and shall eat thereof
[38:53] so it fell out unto him for the people
[38:56] threw them upon the gate
[38:58] and he died may god bless his word may
[39:00] be seated praise the lord
[39:03] so before we get in the service today i
[39:04] want to talk a little bit
[39:06] about this vaccine
[39:09] connected with the coronavirus i feel i
[39:13] want to address it
[39:15] and this is for this church because i
[39:17] realize there are some
[39:18] people are hesitant some don't know or
[39:21] don't want to know
[39:22] and some are taking counsel from those
[39:24] people that are not doctors
[39:26] scientists or even spiritual it seemed
[39:29] like everybody on facebook know
[39:31] that commented negatively is an expert
[39:34] and um i would say check your doctor
[39:37] but don't take consult from these
[39:40] so-called
[39:40] experts on the internet
[39:44] what i see is fear people fear this jab
[39:48] the fear they have more fear you know um
[39:52] what i want to say is that when god
[39:54] pronounced judgment
[39:55] it affect the righteous and the
[39:57] unrighteous
[39:58] when things happen that is god's
[40:02] sent or god arranged or god trying to
[40:06] perform something or get something
[40:07] accomplished it affect all
[40:09] this is not because i'm a believer or
[40:11] i'm a saint
[40:12] i'm immune saints will die
[40:16] saints will get coronavirus it's not
[40:18] that you're immune what we are trying to
[40:20] say is that you don't have to have a
[40:22] a premature debt or premature sickness
[40:26] or unnecessary sickness now i saw a
[40:28] video going wrong
[40:29] it's producing trinidad and they're
[40:31] trying to say or imply
[40:33] that since the vaccine was implemented
[40:36] in this country
[40:37] things have gotten worse and it looked
[40:39] like the data
[40:41] trying to present that and the
[40:43] conclusion is that the vaccine
[40:45] is the cause while the numbers are going
[40:47] up
[40:48] or the debts and so on like that and so
[40:50] like that but if you
[40:52] think it through you would see how
[40:54] foolish that presentation
[40:56] is and it's as if an intellectual idiot
[40:59] produced it
[41:00] so far four million
[41:04] plus people have died from this
[41:06] coronavirus
[41:08] four million millions died
[41:11] even before they had even the very first
[41:14] vaccine
[41:15] it wasn't the vaccine causing the debt
[41:17] do people die from taking the vaccine
[41:19] of course maybe one in a million two in
[41:21] a million i don't know the stats
[41:23] but people will die that's just life
[41:27] that's just how it is some people will
[41:29] die but the fact
[41:30] is the coroner virus kills
[41:34] now my concern so therefore to say that
[41:37] the
[41:38] vaccine is causing cases to rise
[41:41] just does not make sense but you know
[41:43] what
[41:44] when people have negative in their heart
[41:46] and they want the negative
[41:47] that is what they will connect with
[41:49] every negative voice
[41:51] every negative video every narrative
[41:54] armchair
[41:56] expert on facebook or whatsapp or
[41:58] whatever
[41:59] and they will pipe these things and i
[42:01] don't want anybody push any negative
[42:03] against the vaccine here or anything
[42:05] about the vaccine is the market obese
[42:07] or the vaccine have some um bar code in
[42:09] it or microchip instead of nonsense
[42:12] that is just plain foolishness or if the
[42:14] minister himself afraid of getting the
[42:16] vaccine
[42:17] he had problems he afraid hijab and he
[42:20] tell the people don't take it
[42:22] well i am not authorized to do that
[42:24] because the point about it
[42:26] ready or not it will come knocking on
[42:29] your door
[42:30] i want to say today saints this thing
[42:33] kills
[42:34] it's not a game it's not a word game
[42:37] or a argument game it kills
[42:41] it in flicks and it leaves people in
[42:43] terrible conditions
[42:45] so therefore whether it comes from china
[42:48] from a laboratory
[42:50] a conspiracy to reduce world population
[42:52] is irrelevant
[42:54] i have no i don't even want to know
[42:55] where it comes from who make it who have
[42:57] it i don't
[42:58] i'm not interested in that where they
[43:00] have a bar code
[43:02] and and all these things i find it's
[43:04] just plain foolishness to say the least
[43:06] we all have choices in life i know those
[43:10] who took it
[43:10] with high blood pressure and they're
[43:12] alive and kicking
[43:14] i know those who took it with diabetes
[43:16] they're alive and kicking
[43:18] those liquor with cancer and they're
[43:19] still alive and kicking
[43:21] those who take it with low white blood
[43:25] count and so on
[43:26] blood cells and they are alive and
[43:29] kicking
[43:30] and i'm going to close this part here
[43:32] are we going to go into the word
[43:33] but there's a reason why i read the
[43:36] scripture
[43:37] today about these
[43:41] four lepers it was terrible
[43:44] at that time brother branham said that
[43:46] was
[43:47] dingy faith that is the lowest quality
[43:49] of faith
[43:50] of faith that based on reasoning
[43:54] that's the lowest level of faith they
[43:56] say if we go into the city
[43:59] the city have a famine we will die
[44:02] if we stay here we will die
[44:06] if we go to the syrians we might
[44:09] be alive if they keep us oh they might
[44:11] kill us we still go there
[44:13] what do we do when you are confronted
[44:16] with two evils
[44:19] you choose the lesser of the two evils
[44:22] when you are confronted with things you
[44:24] have to sit down and think it through
[44:27] if you stay without the vaccination
[44:31] i am not even talking about what you
[44:32] have now as the coronavirus
[44:35] i'm talking about the variant that would
[44:37] eventually come knocking our door
[44:39] it's like like a sitting dock waiting to
[44:42] get infected
[44:44] if you don't make a choice get counsel
[44:47] from your doctor whatever it is to
[44:48] decide what you will do
[44:50] you just waiting you'll die
[44:54] or get sick or be hospitalized because
[44:57] if the vaccine is a small
[45:02] diluted version of the actual virus and
[45:04] you can't handle that
[45:06] what could happen when that virus rolled
[45:08] you over like a steamroller
[45:11] so these guys if we stay here you will
[45:13] die if we hung out here we will die
[45:15] they decide to go to the enemy camp and
[45:17] because of that
[45:18] dingy fate got some got something to
[45:21] happen
[45:22] that the syrians took off we read the
[45:24] scriptures and they had food
[45:26] and the man was making mockery of
[45:28] elijah's would perish according to the
[45:30] word of elijah
[45:31] so this i want to tell you now if you
[45:34] don't take it
[45:35] if you take it you might die if you
[45:38] don't take it you might die
[45:40] anyway you might die what you gonna do
[45:46] i wish i could say don't come here
[45:48] unvaccinated
[45:49] i'm not playing games you know that's
[45:51] why we shut down and do what we do
[45:53] because we want you to be alive the
[45:55] devil's job is to snatch you out before
[45:57] time
[45:58] don't be a foolish virgin don't make an
[46:01] idiotic choice
[46:03] what i want to say this morning is this
[46:05] to do nothing
[46:06] is also a choice and you will pay
[46:09] the price of doing nothing there is
[46:12] something for you to do
[46:14] you stay as you are you know what's
[46:16] coming
[46:17] eventually it will come knocking on your
[46:19] door
[46:20] what i understand by data is that the
[46:23] people that have vaccinated so far
[46:25] if even if they get reinfected they are
[46:27] not hospitalized
[46:28] and they don't go to the dread trauma
[46:30] that others were unvaccinated
[46:32] and when you're not vaccinated and the
[46:34] virus makers move
[46:36] then he make his melee and callaloo and
[46:39] he make his business inside of there and
[46:40] then come up with a variant
[46:42] i just hope we don't come with that
[46:43] trinity variant
[46:45] worse than the delta variant i just hope
[46:48] we don't do a mixture because there are
[46:49] people waiting
[46:50] watching you're watching watching
[46:52] watching there's people saying i'm going
[46:53] to church too you know they're just
[46:54] watching
[46:55] they're not participating they're doing
[46:56] one thing they're looking to look in the
[46:58] here and look at the conspiracy
[47:00] my ass is not for that my ears is here
[47:03] dusty at the lord
[47:04] that's why that might make much of
[47:06] elijah because it's also impossible
[47:08] but elijah told elijah told him tomorrow
[47:11] around the same time
[47:13] hallelujah bread will be selling
[47:16] oh hallelujah food next day it looked
[47:19] impossible
[47:20] because the famine was hard oh glory to
[47:23] god look impossible to talk about
[47:25] revival
[47:26] it took impossible to talk about bright
[47:28] revival super church super race but it's
[47:30] coming
[47:30] because our prophet elijah spoke it and
[47:33] so shall it be
[47:34] oh blessed be the name of the lord thank
[47:37] you lord jesus i trust
[47:39] these few words would help you
[47:42] the option before you is to do something
[47:47] if you do nothing that is your choice i
[47:50] did something
[47:51] i choose to do it i will do to survive
[47:55] and to live and to stand
[47:57] i ain't talking about fighting
[47:58] immaculate beasts and the press and he
[48:00] just said that i am not into that
[48:02] i'm into what god promised me what god
[48:04] promised the church what god promised to
[48:06] you
[48:06] and my job is to try to keep you alive
[48:08] to be one of those who
[48:09] alive and remain oh hallelujah

[51:22] so this morning god bless you we want to
[51:24] turn our bibles to hebrews chapter 10
[51:27] and we want to read verse 4 to 22 we
[51:30] have one scripture this morning
[51:32] hebrews chapter 10 reading from verse 4
[51:36] to 22 for it is not possible
[51:40] that the blood of bulls and goats should
[51:42] take away sins
[51:44] wherefore when he commit unto the world
[51:46] he said sacrifice an offering or what is
[51:49] not
[51:50] but a body has now prepared me in burnt
[51:53] offerings and sacrifices for sin
[51:55] that was had no pleasure then said i lo
[51:58] i come
[51:58] in the volume of the book it is written
[52:00] of me to do thy will oh god
[52:02] above when he said sacrifice an offering
[52:05] and burned offerings
[52:06] and offering for sin thou what is not
[52:08] neither had pleasure therein
[52:10] which are offered by the law then said
[52:13] he lo i come to do thy will oh god
[52:16] he taketh away the first that he may
[52:19] establish
[52:20] the second by the which will we are
[52:23] sanctified
[52:25] to the offering of the body of jesus
[52:27] christ
[52:28] once for all and every priest
[52:31] standeth daily ministering and offering
[52:34] of times
[52:35] the same sacrifice says which can never
[52:38] take away sin but this man
[52:40] after he had offered one sacrifice for
[52:43] sins
[52:43] forever sat down at the right hand of
[52:46] god
[52:47] from henceforth expecting till his
[52:49] enemies be made his footstool
[52:51] for by one offering he had perfected
[52:53] forever them that are sanctified
[52:56] whereof the holy ghost also is a witness
[52:57] to us for after that he had said before
[53:01] this is the covenant that i will make
[53:03] with them after those days
[53:05] saith the lord i will put my laws into
[53:08] their hearts
[53:09] and in their minds will i write them and
[53:11] their sins and iniquities will i
[53:13] remember no more

[56:02] of the children
[56:03] back to the fathers oh god
[56:06] let us return to that original day of
[56:10] pentecost
[56:12] let us come back to that great fate
[56:16] that was once delivered to the saints
[56:19] made a great bride tree of god that the
[56:22] palmer woman eaten down bring forth
[56:25] in the top of it the fruit that the
[56:28] evening lights would ripen
[56:30] for the coming of the son of god granted
[56:32] lord

[56:36] purpose

[56:44] ourselves this morning
[56:46] this synagogue into your hands lord that
[56:48] you
[56:49] your great purpose be achieved in our
[56:52] lives
[56:53] as we give ourselves holy to you

[57:05] god made our heart
[57:08] our strength our all
[57:12] our all be given to you make it
[57:15] mighty lord multiply it for the kingdom
[57:18] of god's sake
[57:20] we ask it in jesus name amen that's our
[57:23] message part of life 18 of february
[57:25] 1962 what a prayer asking god to break
[57:29] him
[57:30] mold him shape him oh let's continue
[57:34] he's speaking about uh that's the reason
[57:37] that all this snarling and
[57:39] fussing and back biting and biting back
[57:42] and carrying on
[57:43] around the church that is what breaks up
[57:45] the church
[57:46] that shows that the devil got into you
[57:49] that shows that the holy ghost left you
[57:52] now i know that's burning the towel to
[57:54] some of you but it ought to do it
[57:56] it ought to that's what it's set for not
[57:59] to be smart
[58:00] not to acute but to tell you
[58:03] where the trouble is for some day i'm
[58:06] going to have to stand and give an
[58:08] answer for you
[58:09] and the very reason the way you do and
[58:11] the way you act
[58:13] that shows what you are let me read it
[58:15] again and the very reason the way you do
[58:17] and the way you act that shows what you
[58:20] are
[58:21] if you are just a old temper that will
[58:23] fly off the handle
[58:24] just a little bit and get from here and
[58:26] carry on or criticize
[58:28] of vulgarity and stuff like that that
[58:30] shows
[58:31] where it's coming from and there's only
[58:34] one thing to do
[58:35] get that thing out of there and the dove
[58:39] will come back to your heart
[58:42] when the dove went under the ark she was
[58:44] turned out but she came back
[58:46] knocked at the arc door until noah let
[58:49] her in
[58:50] the holy ghost is here the holy ghost
[58:53] wants to come in and that's the reason
[58:56] today
[58:57] that the holy spirit he hasn't gone from
[59:00] you forever
[59:01] is just sitting out on the limb of the
[59:04] tree somewhere
[59:06] ready to fly back to come into you and
[59:08] give you love
[59:10] and peace and joy like you used to have
[59:14] praise the lord sayings how many believe
[59:15] that this morning that the holy spirit
[59:17] is there
[59:18] willing to come and give you joy and
[59:20] love and peace he's ready to do it
[59:22] he wants to do it he's longing to do it
[59:25] and you won't let him do it now
[59:29] here we go i'm not talking to you
[59:30] strangers
[59:32] i don't know what your past i'm talking
[59:35] to
[59:35] random tabernacle i am talking to you
[59:38] people
[59:39] i ain't talking to you people from other
[59:41] churches i am talking to the brand i'm
[59:43] tamaracker
[59:44] that is what the matter are wrong here
[59:47] and that is what makes the dove take its
[59:49] flight
[59:50] just let somebody just start a little
[59:52] something around the church the first
[59:53] thing
[59:54] oh is that so you mean so right then the
[59:57] holy ghost flies away
[59:59] it just can't stand
[1:00:02] that kind of spirit as long as the lamb
[1:00:07] nature leaves you then the holy ghost is
[1:00:10] gone
[1:00:10] that would repeat it as long as that
[1:00:14] lamb nature leaves you
[1:00:16] then the holy ghost is gone that's right
[1:00:19] and that's what the matter today
[1:00:21] and that's the reason the people is in
[1:00:22] the condition they are
[1:00:24] is because they let the wrong spirit
[1:00:27] come into their heart
[1:00:29] into their life we must be gentle
[1:00:33] we must be peaceful we must be alarmed
[1:00:36] what a tremendous
[1:00:38] exhortation bible study on tuesday about
[1:00:42] the study of jonah the mystery of the
[1:00:44] mercy of god
[1:00:46] and to see that jonah knowing that god
[1:00:49] is
[1:00:49] slow to anger full of mercy full of
[1:00:52] compassion
[1:00:53] jonah was concerned that god will
[1:00:55] forgive those people he run
[1:00:57] and in the belly of the fish jonah only
[1:01:00] bald because when you look up his whale
[1:01:02] belly to the left whale belly what a
[1:01:03] situation to be in
[1:01:04] up down east west north south just whale
[1:01:06] belly and jonah reached out
[1:01:09] his arm of faith to hold on to solomon's
[1:01:12] prayer
[1:01:12] if my people will look to this place and
[1:01:14] he prayed and god vomited it out
[1:01:17] but it's very noteworthy to see
[1:01:20] because of what was in jonah's heart he
[1:01:23] was like a postman
[1:01:25] delivering a letter and he didn't expect
[1:01:28] the response the people repented
[1:01:29] and he got upset he got depressed he
[1:01:32] wanted god to kill his life
[1:01:33] because he had something else in his
[1:01:35] heart so you could come to church say
[1:01:38] amen hallelujah glory
[1:01:39] but something else is in your heart so
[1:01:42] just a church member
[1:01:44] if you don't allow the word to have the
[1:01:47] preeminences
[1:01:48] in your life so he said we must be
[1:01:51] gentle
[1:01:52] we must be peaceful now remember the
[1:01:54] dove will come
[1:01:55] you say well brother man don't tell me i
[1:01:56] never received the holy ghost donde that
[1:01:58] night one night
[1:01:59] when he come in he's i felt so good i
[1:02:01] felt and so on like that
[1:02:03] he said but you see the reason he
[1:02:05] couldn't abide aha
[1:02:07] abide he was alarmed then and when you
[1:02:11] become a wolf
[1:02:12] he had to take his flight nothing wrong
[1:02:14] with the dove it is you
[1:02:16] you said you let that spirit come to you
[1:02:19] did i let it bother burnham yes
[1:02:21] when you went to listen to that gossip
[1:02:23] when you listened to that lie
[1:02:24] when you went to saying well i've got a
[1:02:26] right to you haven't got no
[1:02:28] right you are bought with a price and
[1:02:31] that was the price of his precious blood
[1:02:33] of the son of god you have no legal
[1:02:35] rights hallelujah the only right you
[1:02:36] have
[1:02:37] is to come to the fountain filled with
[1:02:38] blood that's the right that you have
[1:02:41] is to surrendered self-will to god
[1:02:44] and then god does the leading from then
[1:02:46] on and that is what caused the meeting
[1:02:49] here we go this beautiful that's what
[1:02:51] caused so many strange things
[1:02:52] the holy spirit will go to a place the
[1:02:55] holy spirit will say
[1:02:56] this is not right stop the meeting move
[1:02:59] you under
[1:03:00] i will stop it too brother and move
[1:03:01] right on that's right
[1:03:03] because you have got to be led by
[1:03:06] the spirit of god and the only way to be
[1:03:09] led by the spirit of god
[1:03:11] is to keep gentle not to know
[1:03:15] a whole lot let me read that again the
[1:03:18] only way to be led by the spirit of god
[1:03:21] is to keep gentle not to know
[1:03:24] a whole lot oh you think i know a whole
[1:03:27] lot
[1:03:27] yeah you get your brain all worked up
[1:03:31] and it can't even work itself you know
[1:03:33] all the books
[1:03:35] and all the answers and all the greek
[1:03:38] and all the hebrew and ain't got no
[1:03:40] place for the dove to roost that's right
[1:03:43] but you know it all then the dove can't
[1:03:45] lead
[1:03:46] because you know too much and i think
[1:03:48] that's a problem
[1:03:49] people just know too much the bible says
[1:03:52] knowledge shall increase
[1:03:54] all knowledge has been released by the
[1:03:56] opening of the seven seals
[1:03:58] knowledge full complete knowledge of god
[1:04:01] people just know too much and they know
[1:04:04] too much
[1:04:04] they know so much that fate is missing
[1:04:08] faith is absent the trust in god the
[1:04:10] confidence in god
[1:04:12] and he was saying here praise
[1:04:15] god that there's only one way to enter
[1:04:17] in
[1:04:18] and that gate is called self-will you
[1:04:21] know
[1:04:21] he's talking about when god come and
[1:04:23] fill your heart
[1:04:25] you see if you do something wrong you
[1:04:27] get condemned because the spirit
[1:04:29] is influencing your heart some people
[1:04:31] say don't condemn me to wear short hair
[1:04:33] you don't condemn me to wear manicure or
[1:04:35] makeup and so on it don't condemn me to
[1:04:36] go to dances
[1:04:37] it don't condemn me to tell a little lie
[1:04:39] it will condemn me to play bridge
[1:04:40] and so on he said you know why you ain't
[1:04:43] got nothing taken them
[1:04:45] that don't hurt my conscience you got no
[1:04:46] more conscience than a snake as hips
[1:04:48] he said you ain't got no conscience
[1:04:50] there's nothing there to hurt you
[1:04:51] but i challenge you to let jesus christ
[1:04:54] come in there
[1:04:55] and try to do it one time brother you'll
[1:04:56] be so condemned you'll be back off and
[1:04:58] shake ahead from that thing just as soon
[1:05:00] as i'm standing here
[1:05:01] he said how did it self-will why will
[1:05:05] you call it self-will
[1:05:06] because god put man just like adam and
[1:05:09] eve in the garden of eden
[1:05:11] self-will this one is death this one is
[1:05:14] life
[1:05:14] what's the scripture we read i come to
[1:05:16] do thy will o god
[1:05:18] as it is written of me god put you as a
[1:05:21] free moral agent isn't that right
[1:05:22] and you have your will but you have to
[1:05:25] will
[1:05:26] to do god's will you have to get rid of
[1:05:28] your own will
[1:05:29] to let god's will come in for this is
[1:05:32] the
[1:05:33] only channel that leads to the heart
[1:05:36] hallelujah this is what the only channel
[1:05:40] that leads to the heart oh you could
[1:05:42] join church
[1:05:43] you can join baptist presbyterian we
[1:05:45] could say this way you could join this
[1:05:47] group that group whatever group
[1:05:48] you this and pringleness can come to
[1:05:50] some medication but you will
[1:05:51] but you have to will to do god's will to
[1:05:54] let the holy spirit come in there to
[1:05:57] bring forth
[1:05:58] these signs shall follow them that
[1:06:00] believe oh blessed be the name of the
[1:06:02] lord
[1:06:02] the mercy seat now the mercy seats in
[1:06:05] the heart
[1:06:06] shining fort his glory in all of his
[1:06:09] children
[1:06:10] how do you come to it into that that
[1:06:12] through these different systems
[1:06:14] true self-will comes in here so you have
[1:06:16] to want god's will for your life
[1:06:18] and jesus he went to his own in the
[1:06:21] garden of gethsemane nevertheless not
[1:06:23] not my will but thy will be done and
[1:06:25] what happens
[1:06:26] you come to the shekinah glory and come
[1:06:28] straight into the presence of god
[1:06:30] when a man is walking or a woman he is
[1:06:33] reflecting the
[1:06:34] kind of glory he don't go into gambling
[1:06:36] dance carrying on
[1:06:38] denying the word no matter what the
[1:06:40] people say he's got his heart set on
[1:06:41] wanting
[1:06:42] god he is if he's truly called of god
[1:06:45] then jesus christ
[1:06:47] reflects himself through him with the
[1:06:49] shekinah glory
[1:06:50] doing the same things he did back there
[1:06:52] manifesting the same gospel
[1:06:54] preaching the same word the same word
[1:06:57] being made
[1:06:57] manifest oh blessed be the name of the
[1:07:00] lord
[1:07:01] hallelujah when we preach a message get
[1:07:03] into the golden altar
[1:07:05] that message was showing how you need to
[1:07:08] have a sacrifice to approach god
[1:07:11] that's the only way you could truly
[1:07:12] worship that's the only way you could go
[1:07:14] forward the first thing
[1:07:16] sins lead upon the altar sacrifice
[1:07:19] approved
[1:07:20] then washed then go into this holy place
[1:07:24] hallelujah one side the shoe bread other
[1:07:27] side
[1:07:27] is seven golden candlesticks and before
[1:07:29] the veil
[1:07:30] an altar altar of incense that you could
[1:07:33] pray
[1:07:34] that could commune you can't go there
[1:07:36] without going to the brass altar
[1:07:38] you can't go to that golden altar before
[1:07:40] going to the barcelona you have to pass
[1:07:42] through
[1:07:42] that brass water to get there where you
[1:07:44] could have effective prayer
[1:07:46] through the blood of jesus because to go
[1:07:48] in there you have to have blood
[1:07:50] and we can only break through that veil
[1:07:52] that next stage
[1:07:53] by the blood of jesus now let's go
[1:07:57] he's speaking here when the virgin
[1:08:00] receives the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:08:01] they said this is a summit
[1:08:03] this is all of it but brethren that's
[1:08:04] wrong there is no summit
[1:08:07] to god's power we move on and on
[1:08:10] it's the unlimited resources of god
[1:08:14] hallelujah let me say it again the
[1:08:15] unlimited resources of god
[1:08:18] has never been tapped yet blessings
[1:08:22] and powers that we know nothing about
[1:08:25] it's never even been revealed to
[1:08:28] archangels
[1:08:29] is laying just ahead for his church
[1:08:32] that will believe oh i feel like giving
[1:08:34] a shout on that one
[1:08:35] hallelujah praise god unlimited
[1:08:39] resources of god that has never been
[1:08:42] tapped yet
[1:08:43] blessings and powers that we know
[1:08:45] nothing about
[1:08:46] it's never even revealed archangels
[1:08:49] is laying just ahead for your church
[1:08:52] that we believe
[1:08:53] for i has not seen it has not heard
[1:08:55] neither has it entered the heart of men
[1:08:57] what god has in store
[1:08:58] for them that love him let's move up and
[1:09:01] claim our rights
[1:09:02] as god open the gates and swing out the
[1:09:04] welcome mat let us
[1:09:06] move into deeper depths and never
[1:09:08] colonize yourself
[1:09:09] organize yourself and get to a place
[1:09:12] where this is we believe this and that's
[1:09:15] all
[1:09:16] see let's believe this plus how much
[1:09:19] more
[1:09:20] we can hear from god and i think that
[1:09:22] ought to be the motive
[1:09:23] of every man and woman that loves the
[1:09:26] lord jesus
[1:09:27] to receive all that you can from the
[1:09:29] hand
[1:09:30] of his bountiful mercies that's oh my
[1:09:34] that's my heart oh praises now
[1:09:38] he's going deeper now and this applied
[1:09:41] to us
[1:09:42] i noticed in the bible one time in the
[1:09:45] old testament
[1:09:46] when a son is born into a home he was a
[1:09:49] son
[1:09:50] when he was born he became a son
[1:09:53] when he was born into a home and the
[1:09:56] ordinary typical oriental home in those
[1:09:58] days
[1:09:58] the son was given a place and a tutor
[1:10:01] and raise the child
[1:10:03] paul beautiful speaks it in the new
[1:10:04] testament how the tutor was to raise a
[1:10:07] child
[1:10:07] the law was a tutor to bring us to
[1:10:09] christ and then that child when he was
[1:10:11] born
[1:10:12] was in the type of church today born
[1:10:14] again by the holy spirit and i believe
[1:10:16] that god has been tutoring his church
[1:10:18] bringing it up
[1:10:19] raising it up till it's time now for
[1:10:21] something
[1:10:22] else to happen so all this tutoring
[1:10:26] is not for us to remain permanent
[1:10:29] students
[1:10:30] all the tutoring and teaching you know
[1:10:32] people say
[1:10:33] teaching places the the believer and
[1:10:35] positionally what he is
[1:10:37] what he is to do what not teaching to
[1:10:40] teach you what you are
[1:10:42] but what you are to become what you have
[1:10:44] to do
[1:10:45] hallelujah but then that child when he
[1:10:48] was born
[1:10:49] he said i believe that god has been
[1:10:51] treated in this church
[1:10:52] bringing it up raising it up and it's
[1:10:55] time now for something else to happen
[1:10:57] something else to happen the church
[1:10:59] ought to be grown by this time
[1:11:01] but many of us who ought to be teaching
[1:11:03] others are yet desiring sincere milk of
[1:11:05] the bible
[1:11:06] we need someone to teach us when we
[1:11:08] should be teachers and to
[1:11:10] that i bowl my head in shame that i
[1:11:12] should know more than gordon
[1:11:14] that i should know more about god than i
[1:11:16] do
[1:11:17] and here is one thing i do believe the
[1:11:19] bible speaks there
[1:11:20] that when the child being raised the
[1:11:22] tutor kept the father posted
[1:11:24] on the conduct of the child now the
[1:11:26] tutor in the manner here has been the
[1:11:27] holy spirit
[1:11:29] and remember the child no matter what
[1:11:31] would ever take place is born a child
[1:11:33] it will all be a child but when a man is
[1:11:35] born of the holy ghost he becomes a
[1:11:36] child of god
[1:11:37] for it is actually a second birth a
[1:11:39] regeneration
[1:11:40] that creates something in the man that
[1:11:43] wasn't there to begin with
[1:11:45] oh glory to god it creates what
[1:11:47] something in the man
[1:11:49] that wasn't there to begin with and when
[1:11:51] every man is born into the whole soul of
[1:11:53] faith he becomes a child
[1:11:54] then the holy spirit here we go follows
[1:11:57] this man
[1:11:58] and brings word to god how he's
[1:12:01] progressing
[1:12:03] so that i have no really pastor an elder
[1:12:05] and bishop and teacher and message pope
[1:12:08] that has nothing to do with these guys
[1:12:10] this has to do with the holy spirit
[1:12:12] followers that man and reports to the
[1:12:14] father
[1:12:15] all right now if you know after the
[1:12:18] child becomes of age
[1:12:19] he's still a child and if the child was
[1:12:22] reckless
[1:12:23] never paid any attention wasn't
[1:12:25] interested in the father's work
[1:12:26] that child never become adopted
[1:12:29] to that family but if he was a correct
[1:12:32] child
[1:12:33] a good child loved the work of his
[1:12:35] father
[1:12:36] i was interested and tried to do all he
[1:12:38] could to progress his father's work
[1:12:41] watch then the tutor brought the word to
[1:12:44] the father
[1:12:46] and that was called the placing of the
[1:12:48] son
[1:12:49] was paul gives it in our galatians the
[1:12:51] adoption
[1:12:53] then we are predestinated unto the
[1:12:56] adoption of children
[1:12:57] by jesus christ the adoption now this is
[1:13:00] tremendous
[1:13:01] because this is the prophet presenting
[1:13:03] the endgame
[1:13:05] i remember some time back we were
[1:13:06] speaking about the valley of dry bones
[1:13:09] and how god acts ezekiel can these bones
[1:13:12] live
[1:13:13] and how ezekiel answered down noise and
[1:13:15] god say prophesy because these bones are
[1:13:17] going
[1:13:18] to live that was the endgame that was
[1:13:21] the end product
[1:13:22] but there was a process to get it
[1:13:25] to live bones can't
[1:13:28] live like that boner to come to bone
[1:13:32] flesh had to come to upon the bone skin
[1:13:34] had to come upon the flesh
[1:13:36] and then comes the bread so what god
[1:13:38] gives
[1:13:39] is the complete vision up front of the
[1:13:42] target
[1:13:43] of the goal then he comes back and works
[1:13:46] out the process
[1:13:48] so here it is but abraham is identifying
[1:13:51] adoption adopted son but
[1:13:55] look now closer to what he is connecting
[1:13:59] to
[1:13:59] as process he said watch now now the
[1:14:02] same son
[1:14:04] that was born into a family could be
[1:14:07] adopted into the same family
[1:14:10] or placed in the same family
[1:14:14] or give a position in the family that he
[1:14:17] was born into
[1:14:18] and i do believe that that is the work
[1:14:22] of the holy spirit today among the
[1:14:25] church
[1:14:26] is trying to place in the church
[1:14:28] positionally here we go
[1:14:29] apostles teachers prophets
[1:14:33] and we have seen so many false alarms
[1:14:36] and
[1:14:36] in the message for salaam people
[1:14:38] claiming to be this
[1:14:39] clear mean to me that without a single
[1:14:41] vindication evidence only the mouth
[1:14:43] saying that and they have the people
[1:14:46] that support them like fanatics
[1:14:48] backing them in that position that's not
[1:14:50] what we're talking about
[1:14:51] there's not false alarms he's talking
[1:14:53] about the holy spirit
[1:14:55] it's a work of the holy spirit it's
[1:14:57] trying to place
[1:14:58] the church and he can't place the people
[1:15:01] first oh glory to god you have to praise
[1:15:03] a faithful ministry
[1:15:05] oh glory to god that's why i said
[1:15:07] there's a fightful mystery yet
[1:15:08] because they have to be placed
[1:15:10] positionally
[1:15:12] in the body then others gonna be placed
[1:15:14] or give the lord a shout
[1:15:17] watch and we have seen many false salam
[1:15:20] and so forth
[1:15:21] moving amongst the people which only
[1:15:23] indicated
[1:15:24] that the real genuine adoption was at
[1:15:26] hand
[1:15:27] and i believe it god has to place into
[1:15:30] the church
[1:15:31] and that is the business of god not man
[1:15:34] convention care plays that man some man
[1:15:36] over man
[1:15:37] some pope message man can't praise
[1:15:39] another man that's foolishness
[1:15:40] that's god's business oh glory to god
[1:15:43] god could take care of his business
[1:15:44] he said for god i've set in the church
[1:15:46] not man set
[1:15:48] not man appoint not man voted in for god
[1:15:51] set in the church
[1:15:52] teachers and pastors and prophets and
[1:15:53] evangelists and pastors for the
[1:15:55] perfection of the saints
[1:15:56] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:15:58] elephantine body this is this is
[1:16:00] wonderful this morning
[1:16:01] i'm enjoying the word hallelujah praise
[1:16:03] god so watch
[1:16:05] when this boy become of age and when he
[1:16:08] was ready
[1:16:09] for this adoption he had proved the
[1:16:11] tutor told the father this boy was
[1:16:13] illegible for adoption
[1:16:15] he was taken into a public place and was
[1:16:18] robed a row of honor perhaps purple
[1:16:22] some call of royalty was set up and the
[1:16:24] whole city
[1:16:25] all the people around about seeing the
[1:16:26] father adopt his own son into the family
[1:16:29] so there's not a private thing in a
[1:16:31] corner somewhere no this is going safe
[1:16:33] look him here this is my beloved son
[1:16:34] look at another one here this is my
[1:16:36] beloved son who
[1:16:37] look another one here i'm pleased to be
[1:16:39] identified with my sons
[1:16:41] oh glory to god nobody bring it with no
[1:16:43] message card
[1:16:44] and no cold card not that not that this
[1:16:47] is the father
[1:16:48] identifying his own son isn't that right
[1:16:51] he said no watch and when
[1:16:52] and when he's adopted into the family
[1:16:55] already a son
[1:16:56] already a child already a of grace but
[1:16:59] placed
[1:16:59] into the family he said you get it when
[1:17:02] he was placed in the family
[1:17:04] and given his position then that boy's
[1:17:07] name on the check
[1:17:08] was just as good as the father's name on
[1:17:10] the check
[1:17:11] hallelujah and i believe oh glory to god
[1:17:14] are you ready church
[1:17:15] that is the time that the church has
[1:17:17] arrived at today
[1:17:18] that's the next great move in the church
[1:17:21] is for god
[1:17:22] after seeing false alarms but now god
[1:17:25] will place in his church correctly oh
[1:17:29] glory to god
[1:17:30] apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[1:17:33] not man-made seminary born but god will
[1:17:36] place
[1:17:36] into the church not theology run over or
[1:17:39] overnight
[1:17:40] but god will place in the church as god
[1:17:43] has chosen
[1:17:44] as the holy ghost has tuted his church
[1:17:46] and raised it up
[1:17:48] and in there god will adopt into the
[1:17:50] position his sons
[1:17:51] they're already his sons but whether
[1:17:53] they are worthy of the position he has
[1:17:55] for them
[1:17:55] or give the lord a shout i feel inspired
[1:17:58] this morning
[1:17:59] he is nailing down about this fightful
[1:18:01] ministry
[1:18:02] oh my so here it is the prophet present
[1:18:06] this vision of adoption
[1:18:07] and this is from mexico hidden life and
[1:18:10] he's going to go deeper now he's going
[1:18:12] to go
[1:18:12] deeper in this process here is words now
[1:18:16] now let's drop back to the hidden life
[1:18:20] and find out what this
[1:18:23] is going to require to get
[1:18:27] into this place of adoption oh glory to
[1:18:29] god how to take a little walk hallelujah
[1:18:31] my lord my lord do you see it
[1:18:35] do you see it let me read it again let's
[1:18:38] jump back to the hidden light
[1:18:41] and find out what this is going to
[1:18:44] require
[1:18:45] to get into this place of adoption
[1:18:49] a hidden light we realize
[1:18:52] that in the old testament under mosaic
[1:18:54] law
[1:18:55] any reader will know there were two
[1:18:58] veils
[1:19:00] two compartments the setup of god's
[1:19:02] tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:19:04] so no he's talking about adoption he
[1:19:06] switched a hidden light
[1:19:08] he go on the old testament to address
[1:19:10] this tabernacle
[1:19:12] hallelujah and that's what we addressed
[1:19:15] in the golden altar message
[1:19:18] the first was the congregation then the
[1:19:21] holy place
[1:19:22] then the holiest of holies that's god's
[1:19:26] house
[1:19:27] that's god's dwelling please that is
[1:19:29] your dwelling please
[1:19:31] and you only live in three room house
[1:19:34] remember
[1:19:35] you may have two bedrooms you may have
[1:19:37] three kitchens you may have them
[1:19:38] a tree room house but god lived in a
[1:19:42] tree room house when god was here in it
[1:19:45] and he occupied a tree room house
[1:19:48] the body the spirit
[1:19:52] and the soul in the temporal temple
[1:19:55] he's in the congregation holy place
[1:19:59] holies of holies each one of them
[1:20:02] was separated one from another each one
[1:20:06] had different furniture in it to show
[1:20:08] the dwelling place
[1:20:09] a beautiful type he said the living room
[1:20:12] is where you commune the bedroom is
[1:20:15] where you
[1:20:15] rest and the kitchen is where you eat
[1:20:19] kitchen to eat living room to commune
[1:20:23] bedroom to rest the sinner comes in
[1:20:26] faith come by hearing the word he comes
[1:20:29] and eats the wood
[1:20:30] he's baptized into their faith and
[1:20:32] accept christ as personal savior
[1:20:34] brings them there to commune with god
[1:20:36] then he moves into the bedroom
[1:20:39] distilled quietness with god
[1:20:42] where all the things of the world is
[1:20:43] shut out he is alone in the
[1:20:46] stillness of god brethren sisters
[1:20:49] that's the place this pentecostal move
[1:20:53] ought to be today not so much babylon
[1:20:56] we are trinity we are methodists we are
[1:20:59] assemblies
[1:21:00] we are church of god we ought to be
[1:21:03] alone
[1:21:03] in that quiet stillness with god we
[1:21:06] ought to be
[1:21:08] notice when the high priest once a year
[1:21:11] entered into the
[1:21:12] first veil then the second veil on the
[1:21:15] outside
[1:21:16] the lever where they washed the
[1:21:18] sacrifice then the sacrifice was killed
[1:21:21] put on the brazen altar and the blood
[1:21:23] was put in a charger
[1:21:25] the high priest once a year walking
[1:21:26] behind the veil to make an atonement
[1:21:29] notice the dressing of this high priest
[1:21:31] before he could enter the veil
[1:21:33] he had to be stripped and dressed right
[1:21:35] to go in
[1:21:36] and that is what the churches today what
[1:21:39] it needs is a stripping off
[1:21:40] of all these cults and things and
[1:21:43] dressed in the rashes of jesus christ
[1:21:46] and ready to enter in his walk must be
[1:21:48] different
[1:21:49] along the hems of his garment he had
[1:21:51] pomegranate
[1:21:52] and then a bell and as he walked his
[1:21:54] walk was so perfect
[1:21:56] until the bells played holy holy unto
[1:21:58] the lord
[1:21:59] so when we see that natural pomegranate
[1:22:02] bell ringing
[1:22:03] in god's thinking alleluia in god's
[1:22:06] translation
[1:22:07] those bears ringing holy holy holy unto
[1:22:10] the lord
[1:22:11] hallelujah shadow a reflection of what
[1:22:13] is have in heaven isn't that right
[1:22:15] when sarah is going back and forth holy
[1:22:18] holy on the lord
[1:22:19] he said what we need today is not
[1:22:21] whether we are assemblies
[1:22:22] or church of god or oneness or whatever
[1:22:25] it might be
[1:22:25] our work must be plain to the public
[1:22:28] holy holy holy
[1:22:30] unto the lord another thing he must be
[1:22:32] anointed
[1:22:33] before he goes in the anointing oil was
[1:22:36] made with the rose of sharon and the
[1:22:39] crushing of the rose
[1:22:40] brought forth the perfume and they put
[1:22:42] it on the oil
[1:22:44] that run on aaron's beard plum to the
[1:22:46] hems of the skirt
[1:22:47] or glory to god a representation of the
[1:22:50] anointing that must be upon him
[1:22:53] before he break into this most holy
[1:22:55] place
[1:22:56] with that hallelujah with that blood oh
[1:22:59] glory to god
[1:23:00] oh my this is good this morning
[1:23:03] hallelujah all over
[1:23:04] the skirt with the anointing oil walking
[1:23:07] right
[1:23:08] living right moving right dressed right
[1:23:11] and there he was taken before him the
[1:23:14] blood
[1:23:14] and as he went behind the curtain into
[1:23:17] the third room
[1:23:18] there was a veil dropped behind him that
[1:23:21] the outside world could not see him no
[1:23:22] more
[1:23:23] and every man or woman boy or girl that
[1:23:26] ever is anointed of god
[1:23:28] listen here talk about pastor here
[1:23:31] and teacher and evangelist every man
[1:23:34] boy woman or girl
[1:23:38] that ever is anointed of god and walks
[1:23:41] behind
[1:23:42] that temple the veil of god the holy
[1:23:45] ghost puts him
[1:23:46] in a secret place the veil drops behind
[1:23:50] him
[1:23:50] and the world and all the things are cut
[1:23:52] off behind him
[1:23:54] oh are you ready church that's the
[1:23:57] reason brethren
[1:23:58] yeah we that we are holding up the
[1:24:00] adoption of god
[1:24:02] as our difference of life and
[1:24:05] fussing and quarreling amongst one
[1:24:09] another is the reason
[1:24:11] the veil can't drop behind us and we can
[1:24:15] go into that presence of god we are so
[1:24:17] interested
[1:24:18] in our denominations that's what i'm
[1:24:20] saying oh man can't take no group in the
[1:24:22] corner and talk about this bride
[1:24:24] nice bride you only push somewhere in
[1:24:25] the corner someone don't die bright
[1:24:27] because you have a bible and some spoken
[1:24:28] books and talking to
[1:24:29] a few people inside the bush or somebody
[1:24:31] in a corner somewhere
[1:24:32] have no fellowship with nobody because
[1:24:34] you alone right
[1:24:35] that is madness that doesn't make sense
[1:24:38] hallelujah
[1:24:39] we are so interested in our denomination
[1:24:42] we are so interested in what the next
[1:24:44] fellow what is that today followed on me
[1:24:47] it's an individual of fear between every
[1:24:50] minister
[1:24:51] how a minister ought to always get alone
[1:24:53] to himself
[1:24:54] even before he preaches before he prays
[1:24:57] before he does anything he should get
[1:24:59] along with god in that quiet place
[1:25:01] hid away with god oh my praise be to
[1:25:05] jesus
[1:25:06] he says he say no on the inside of this
[1:25:10] inner court called the holies of holies
[1:25:12] there was a piece of furniture set in
[1:25:14] there called
[1:25:15] the mercy seat and the covenant was in
[1:25:18] the ark
[1:25:19] and the ark had two cherubims and it was
[1:25:21] on the inside
[1:25:22] that was the furniture inside of the
[1:25:24] holy place
[1:25:26] next coming out of the golden
[1:25:27] candlesticks then onto the lever
[1:25:29] and many times people living in god's
[1:25:31] second room
[1:25:32] even in communion after they receive the
[1:25:35] word
[1:25:36] and come into the second step of
[1:25:38] receiving christ into their life
[1:25:40] and never know what that secret room is
[1:25:44] what that bedroom what that rest places
[1:25:46] yet they eat manner
[1:25:48] eating the word they're eating the seals
[1:25:50] these are mysteries and so on
[1:25:52] as we said some services are back praise
[1:25:54] god the denomination teaches the flesh
[1:25:57] so at the national spirit in the church
[1:25:59] behind your pulpit or wherever
[1:26:01] all the mysteries they pump in the
[1:26:03] combination of flesh
[1:26:04] oh hallelujah because there is no much
[1:26:06] spirit pushing that
[1:26:08] but did you notice talk about the mana
[1:26:11] now
[1:26:11] if it layed too long it finally melted
[1:26:14] out
[1:26:15] it perished away i think a lot of people
[1:26:18] had had a lot of cam-ground cramps
[1:26:20] he said now watch god said moses you
[1:26:22] make a golden pot
[1:26:23] and they had placed this manner watch
[1:26:26] it is always fresh and what he did he
[1:26:29] places into the most holy place isn't
[1:26:31] that right
[1:26:32] and the manner never went still oh glory
[1:26:33] to god is always just a sweet watch
[1:26:36] it's always fresh and new and sweet as
[1:26:38] the days went by
[1:26:39] as years went by and any man who comes
[1:26:42] to christ
[1:26:43] and hides away and the veil falls behind
[1:26:46] him he's in the presence of almighty god
[1:26:48] eating that manner day and night from
[1:26:50] one hour to another hour
[1:26:52] it's just as sweet as it was oh my
[1:26:54] hallelujah
[1:26:55] now remember you said i
[1:26:59] overcome smoking that ain't what he's
[1:27:01] talking about
[1:27:03] there's a whole lot more to go to
[1:27:04] christianity besides not smoking
[1:27:06] cigarettes
[1:27:07] or drinking whiskey he doesn't overcome
[1:27:09] and selling here at all things

[1:28:37] ask you something
[1:28:38] have you ever come to the place in life
[1:28:41] where christ meant more to you than
[1:28:43] all the arguing you could do about your
[1:28:44] church has
[1:28:46] christ meant more to you than all the
[1:28:48] world
[1:28:49] i don't mean from emotion or mental work
[1:28:52] up
[1:28:52] i mean from the depths of your heart
[1:28:55] that something
[1:28:57] settled in there something taking place
[1:29:00] and you don't know how it come you are
[1:29:03] hidden away
[1:29:04] your whole motivism of jesus christ have
[1:29:06] you entered into that place
[1:29:08] my dear brother have you come into that
[1:29:10] place
[1:29:11] where you don't care what anyone else
[1:29:13] says
[1:29:14] not to go out and act smart but till the
[1:29:17] love of god
[1:29:18] is so anchored into you that you can't
[1:29:20] see nothing else
[1:29:21] your whole motive is to do the will of
[1:29:23] god the love of god
[1:29:25] for everybody flowing freely from
[1:29:28] everywhere
[1:29:28] what a place to live that's the hidden
[1:29:32] place
[1:29:33] that's the place where we have got to
[1:29:36] come to my bedroom
[1:29:38] so this is what the prophet is pointing
[1:29:39] us to that place
[1:29:41] that's the place where god will reveal
[1:29:44] secret things
[1:29:46] that's the place here we go where god
[1:29:49] does the placing and the
[1:29:52] calling you get what i mean not the
[1:29:55] first court
[1:29:57] not the second court but the third court
[1:30:01] hallelujah the most holy place
[1:30:06] in this place he said they put aaron's
[1:30:09] rod to make a decision who god has
[1:30:11] chosen
[1:30:12] and who he hasn't and that rod
[1:30:15] was a dead stick in one night time come
[1:30:19] to life
[1:30:20] and brought buds brought flowers brought
[1:30:23] almonds
[1:30:24] it both come to life it brought blossoms
[1:30:27] yielded fruits a very typical pattern
[1:30:30] of the sinner being brought to god into
[1:30:33] the holy place
[1:30:34] now remember that road passed over every
[1:30:36] one of those other elements
[1:30:38] and it got inside the holy place still
[1:30:40] dead
[1:30:41] glory to god so it passed through all by
[1:30:44] the brass altar
[1:30:45] it passed through all the holy place
[1:30:47] with the seven candlesticks and so
[1:30:48] still then but when it went beyond the
[1:30:50] veil
[1:30:51] that two step that third place

[1:34:10] that
[1:34:11] rod was off of an almond tree and it was
[1:34:13] cut off and it died
[1:34:15] and when god man was cut off from god he
[1:34:18] died spiritually

[1:43:35] life is short paul is
[1:43:38] is he has every ephemeral like temporary
[1:43:42] i believe
[1:43:42] i have seen it in lions i've seen it in
[1:43:45] old men
[1:43:47] everyone who lives long enough will
[1:43:48] become very vulnerable
[1:43:50] at some point be humble
[1:43:54] help the sick the weak
[1:43:58] and the vulnerable and most importantly
[1:44:01] do not forget
[1:44:03] that we will leave the stage one day
[1:44:07] live consciously many men don't think
[1:44:10] they have to lead the stage
[1:44:12] but this is life someday
[1:44:16] we have to leave the stage be humble
[1:44:21] but abraham still with tempers
[1:44:24] still mean arrogant
[1:44:28] somebody says something about you you
[1:44:29] light up ready to fight
[1:44:32] and then born of the spirit of god no
[1:44:34] god's spirit don't do like that
[1:44:36] no god's spirit is humble meek
[1:44:40] sweet long-suffering that is god's
[1:44:44] kind forgiven that's god's spirit
[1:44:47] and then baram said god make me right
[1:44:52] i don't want to be arrogant selfish
[1:44:56] but the gideon spirit mixed up with mine
[1:44:59] let me read it again god make me right
[1:45:04] i don't want that arrogant selfish
[1:45:06] spirit
[1:45:07] mixed up with mine i want my spirit to
[1:45:10] be pure
[1:45:11] and clean broadly love
[1:45:14] holy with the holy spirit now if someone
[1:45:17] does something wrong to me
[1:45:18] that's all right though i might have the
[1:45:21] right
[1:45:22] to get back at them i don't want that in
[1:45:25] my life
[1:45:26] that would repeat it again that would
[1:45:29] repeat again if someone does anything
[1:45:31] wrong to me
[1:45:31] that's all right though i might have the
[1:45:34] right to get back at them
[1:45:36] i don't want that in my life no
[1:45:39] i want to have love i want to be ready
[1:45:43] to correct with love
[1:45:44] with love that absolutely anchors out
[1:45:48] yonder for us
[1:45:49] oh my praise the name of the lord begin
[1:45:53] to play something
[1:45:55] you take an old hug wash him up
[1:45:59] scrub him up manicure his toenails
[1:46:02] give it lipstick put it on nylons you
[1:46:05] want to turn it loose
[1:46:07] it will go right to the wallow and
[1:46:09] wallow scrubbing won't do it no good
[1:46:12] it's still got the nature of a hug when
[1:46:15] you take a lamb
[1:46:17] and put him in a mud hole he will squeal
[1:46:20] till you get him out why
[1:46:22] he's the nature of the lamb now the only
[1:46:25] way
[1:46:25] to keep the hug out of the mud is to
[1:46:28] change its nature
[1:46:30] that's the only way to make a christian
[1:46:33] let
[1:46:33] his nature be changed from a sinner to
[1:46:36] saint
[1:46:37] and there's only one remedy that's the
[1:46:40] holy spirit
[1:46:41] then you become a witness friends the
[1:46:44] reality is this
[1:46:45] not all who profess to be christians are
[1:46:48] christians
[1:46:49] not all who profess to be christians
[1:46:50] have christ
[1:46:52] this is the reality and you have to know
[1:46:54] what's in your heart
[1:46:56] and what's the desire of your heart if
[1:46:59] you don't have such a desire this
[1:47:00] morning
[1:47:01] won't you ask god to create a desire in
[1:47:03] you god created me a hungering and
[1:47:05] twisting
[1:47:06] after righteousness people proudly
[1:47:09] coming out from the bush coming on from
[1:47:10] wherever
[1:47:11] to declare they're coming out they're
[1:47:13] coming out to be whatever they want to
[1:47:15] be
[1:47:16] changing agenda doing this that the
[1:47:18] other but you have to come out one day

[1:47:36] them to a life
[1:47:38] a hidden life a life lord surrender to
[1:47:41] you
[1:47:42] you call them to go beyond that golden
[1:47:44] altar of incense
[1:47:46] into this most holy veil where
[1:47:49] that holy place lord where the veil
[1:47:51] drops them behind the individual
[1:47:53] father won't you call them this morning
[1:47:55] call them beyond church
[1:47:57] and maybe just maybe as they sit in
[1:48:00] their home wherever they are
[1:48:02] listening lord may they see beyond the
[1:48:05] church itself
[1:48:06] make you give them a different view that
[1:48:09] it's not church you call them too you
[1:48:12] call them into that
[1:48:13] hidden place that most holy place
[1:48:17] it's no longer for iran it's not a high
[1:48:19] priesthood be anymore
[1:48:20] each individual is ordained to get into
[1:48:23] that place
[1:48:24] you put that place as adoption you put
[1:48:26] that place at the land of adoption
[1:48:28] you put that place as the place where
[1:48:30] the hidden things are revealed and
[1:48:32] unfolded
[1:48:33] behind that veil father where the glory
[1:48:35] never failed i don't want you to take
[1:48:36] each one lord i am here father waiting

[1:48:48] the dice i'm hoping it comes out right
[1:48:50] this is your plan and your program
[1:48:54] being unfolded and jesus said i come to
[1:48:57] do thy will of god
[1:48:58] and it is written of me in the volume of
[1:49:01] the book
[1:49:02] here we are lord we cannot make the
[1:49:05] rapture
[1:49:06] in the first court we cannot make the
[1:49:08] rapture
[1:49:09] in the second court rapture is for those
[1:49:13] who can break into that third court
[1:49:15] and your city's self will lord the
[1:49:17] desire
[1:49:18] for the will of god to be applied in our
[1:49:20] lives god and i shared in the prayer
[1:49:22] meeting
[1:49:22] that if anybody had a case of complex
[1:49:25] anybody had real
[1:49:26] issues with jonah when he looked up was
[1:49:28] whale bell he looked down
[1:49:29] all around and he said lying vanities
[1:49:33] he choose to believe something beyond
[1:49:35] his present circumstance
[1:49:36] his present condition and he begin to
[1:49:39] pray
[1:49:40] and sometimes the devil want to bind our
[1:49:42] mouths that we will not pray because of
[1:49:44] the situation we're in
[1:49:45] or the condition we are in but maybe
[1:49:47] people free themselves from that this
[1:49:48] morning
[1:49:49] to know as a son as a daughter they have
[1:49:51] that option
[1:49:53] to cry out to pray to seek to ask
[1:49:56] to do something god made it just take
[1:49:59] the sales for granted
[1:50:00] or take us a light service or just a few
[1:50:02] words being said
[1:50:04] but may they take it for the weight and
[1:50:05] gravity that it should be in
[1:50:07] that they should see it that we have to
[1:50:10] break into this
[1:50:11] most holy place god in the old testament
[1:50:13] was debt
[1:50:14] oh god to go in hallelujah now is debt
[1:50:18] to be outside of your presence
