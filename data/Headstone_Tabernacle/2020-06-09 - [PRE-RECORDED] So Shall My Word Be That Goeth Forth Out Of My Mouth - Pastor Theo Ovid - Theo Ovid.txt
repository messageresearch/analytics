from equally Isis chapter 11 verse 4 to 6 wanna read Isaiah 55 60 11 I wanna read Ezekiel 12 21 to 28 it again equally Isis 11 if you're writing it down 4 to 6 Isaiah 55 60 11 and Ezekiel 12 21 to 28 acquiesce is 11 who is for he that observed the windin shall not sue and he had regarded the clothes shall not reap as don't know it's not what is the way of the Spirit know how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child even so don't know it's not the works of God who make it oil in the morning so dicey and in the evening with hole not in hand for thou knowest not whether shall prosper either this or that or whether they would be both shall be alike good Isaiah chapter 55 reading from verse 6 iike the Lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him under our God for he will abundantly pardon for my torts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your tours for as the rain come at dawn and the snow from heaven and return it not thither but water ready it and make it at bring forth and bud that is made brief seated a sewer and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing wherein - I sent it another scripture from Ezekiel chapter 12 reading from verse 21 and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man what is that proverb that you have in the land of Israel seeing the days are prolonged and every vision feel it tell them therefore thus saith the Lord God I will make this provoke to cease they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel but say unto them the days are at hand and the effect of every vision for there shall be no more vain visions of flattering designations praise God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord Alleluia praise be to Jesus there shall be no tell them for there shall be no more vain vision of flattering definition within the house of Israel for I am the Lord I will speak on the word that I shall speak it shall be prolong it shall be no more prolonged for ended in your deeds or rebellious hosts will I see the word and will perform it see it the Lord God again the word of the Lord came to me saying son of man behold day of the house of Israel see the vision that we see it is for many days to come and it prophesied of times that are far off therefore see unto them thus saith the Lord God they shall none of my will be prolong any more but the word which I have spoken shall be done see the lawless ballheads Heavenly Father we thank you for your word and we thank you for the inspiration here we target for your people and your manservants Lord I hear and come by the churches Lord may empower us to go as the laborers in your field and this time of harvest take me out to the wait tonight I may be glorified in our midst confirm your word with signs and wonders and miracles we ask in Jesus name Amen and amen so god bless you may be seated and I've been your greetings and my wife and they had some time and I got back home in Trinidad we're certainly glad to be here and all those fellow laborers here was minister of the gospel we had to put our shoulder to the wheel that we could press on towards the coming of the Lord our contact Scripture like to read it off define it it's on first Corinthians 347 and Paul was saying for one said I am of Paul another I am of apollos are we not carnal who then is Paul who is Apollo's but ministers by whom he believed even as the Lord give to every man I have planted Apollo's watered but God gives the increase so then neither is he that planted anything near the sea that watered but God that gave the increase today my context capitalist tonight and if a title so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth as the title so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth and have a subject one so it another water--it but God gave the increase or praise the name of the Lord so we're looking forward to see what the Lord will not do tonight amen praise God I love the inspiration they that sow in tears shall reap in joy and I put some time on that that was like a burden in my heart to bring to the people you have to beat reveal you have to be a groaning you have to be at revealing you have to be a crying and sign the message has become very comfortable the message have become very flat where people are satisfied to know that they believe a prophet and there are books and tapes and it will Brown message no that's not the message you know your fire coming your your challenges is coming but a Branham out to face his own and so with the bride he said I'd rather be a hunted persecuted group or say I mean better over we're not going to sit down on a church bench I'm just gonna rupture no that's not happening that is not going to happen Oh glory to God the bride will go to a rough time or glory to God but we have a word from the Lord break that his wood will not return void everything spoken about the bride will come to pass it has nothing to do with your feelings there's nothing to do with your emotions it have to do with word court have said or glory to God it has what to do what God have said and one time a prophet hadn't got angry and upset Elijah and my god want to know what's the word for the Lord what is word of the Lord and he said bringing me a minstrel because he in an upset mode and once there's a upset it has to have an atmosphere to bring the prophet in the spirit so he get the right singing and the music he said does hear the Lord dig me a valley full of ditches you wouldn't see win praise God he wouldn't he'll win you wouldn't see rain but water going to come out and and ditches don't go by your feelings don't buy emotions don't buy your feeling tonight Oh glory to God hallelujah and that's why we had that scripture he that regardeth the will shall not sow we refuse the conditions are on us we refuse to accept what does are on us we're going to do what we have to do speak what have to be spoken and it shall surely come to pass we believe that even you will be seated oh praise God so brother Branham in Revelation chapter 4 he was talking about the cherubims had a Freeman sword the Garden of Eden to keep the tree of the Tree of Life there was a Garden of Eden and this is the Cape right here swings out at the gate there was turbans it said cherubims and there was a god the way of the Tree of Life he said who is the way Jesus they kept the Tree of Life and gathered it the way of life now you must remember that there was an altar at the Garden of Eden it's an altar this must have been an altar at the Garden of Eden I will tell you why you remember Cain and Abel came to worship so that shows that God's altar was moved and set there at the Garden of Eden and the only way back to Eden is by the altar the only way back to Eden is true the altar so the way back to Eden is by the altar and through the altar and that altar had to be covered with blood he say all kind of people see it nothing but the blood they had to be an atonement they had to be a mercy seat this is the author of judgment that must become a mercy seat God in this gate so Cain went out of the presence of the Lord from the gate at the garden so the presence of the Lord must have been by the altar or glory their God where I guess in the presence of the Lord right by the altar and the altar was at the gate and it's coach dwelling place and Kim went out from the presence of the Lord from this place no God told Moses make everything on earth as a pattern after heaven so any may make that let's continue and when he did he made the Ark of the Covenant and put two cherubim cigar diac so he put two turbines like that he made cherubims representing the guards scene in heaven isn't that something there that God the mercy seat where God energy kind of glory where is the Shekinah glory at the mercy seat at the mercy seat is right the god that she kind of glory that there's a but I want to get to then it goes to show that every Scalia work cannot come in and take of that you have to be prepared before you come into the presence of it or glory to court do you get that tonight not any scallywag will access this presence so therefore the presence of God must be accessed you could read the books you could listen to the tapes but you have to be given access or glory to God because this presence is guarded Oh plural of God hallelujah glory to God amen the buff is in the mind but when that presence come into your heart it is settled the battle is over Oh glory to God once that's hip dropping in your soul your puffle is over that's like more they could tell the people the Egyptians you see today you shall see them no more forever the battle was over or glory Liguria man so you must be given access to the presence of God and right now his debt to be O sight of his presence Oh glory to God let's continue are you ready Israel was free from Pharaoh when they left Egypt the enemy Den was the system the enemy was he was Kingdom the enemy was external you could point to it you could talk about it because it is external you could discuss it you could share it with others hallelujah your enemy though excuses why it is justified what you do why you do it justified in your own mind they had an external enemy they were free from Pharaoh but were they free from themselves hallelujah that is my easy to point outside people as the enemy it easy to look at external enemies and external and this one add up 1 and up 1 and up 1 but they were free from 0 but there wasn't free from themselves a bigger past was coming it was not Pharaoh test it was that same self that put self all glory to God that message self or do I am still the truth the truth and the truth will set you free or glory to God hallelujah glory to God freedom carries a responsibility and an accountability but freedom you could lie you could cheat you could be underhand you could cut off for us you could create your own club to love your own Harley or care about your circle or your circle of family or friends and associate the wilderness Chile expose that they were free from Pharaoh but not for themselves and then first Corinthians tell us they were all baptized under Moses in the cloud in the sea they eat and drink of the same water and these things happen for examples to the intent you see the people and the message thing that they get away from everything because they are in the message listen it's not like that you know don't have a God of your own imagination you know you have to have a core of the word let me say it again don't have a God don't make your own garden you see like how better than and I talk about it having a God for this and you're carrying your own God don't do that this is the corner of the word the same people that God call out he killed this same people that he called out he destroy don't just say you're called many a call let me say that again many are called but few are chosen you want to be one of the chosen ones Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God may be seated leader these things will happen for examples to the intent we should not lust as after evil things as they lusted neither be the idolaters and some of them as written the people sat down to eat and drink and plain neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed under in one day three and twenty thousand near let us tempt Christ as some of them tempted and were destroyed of serpents need a murmur ye as some of them murmured or Gloria I was destroyed by destroy destroy all these things happen unto them therefore the examples that they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall Oh glory to God hallelujah they had no temptation taken you but such as common to man but God is faithful who will not that you suffer to be tempted above what you're able to bear but with that temptation make a way for you to escape it Oh glory to God you love him tonight Oh glory to God this is the message this is the word hallelujah hallelujah there is no free ride or Gloria what is the price to leave from Egypt to go into the Promised Land Oh hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelu may be seated glory to God hallelujah different colin is without repentance you can't make yourself something you are not but if God calls you you be the most thankful person in the world because he has called you then it becomes real to you or glory to God what attracts the Holy Ghost the character in you or glory to God hallelujah hallelujah your power must be from the source not the gift or glory to God it could have musical gift of play piano and play guitar and sing and everything else that forgived God give you a gift it could be raw talent playing the piano but if the piano player it's connected a source it's more than your talent it's the anointing Jim it's the Spirit of God or glory to God you can ever give the scene that's your gift that's your voice but if you cannot give get a power source the Holy Spirit going to anoint you and take it to another level Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God connected to the power source then the plane become inspired you may be seated but singing become inspired the preaching becomes inspired the exhortation become inspired everything you do become inspired or glory to go on the devil

Bush see the bird get not done so when Goliath coming inspire even his purpose I'll cut your head off knocking him down is not a problem but the visualize we're gonna take his sword I'm cutting it off you have to be inspired or glory to God you will be healed tonight to catch dr. got to be inspired deliver tonight Oh glory not God you may be seated you said watch but I ran on from here him if you stand I love this laughter you received the Holy Ghost and make yourself a Christian oh you mean we're not automatically Christians you mean you have to be formed in this thing you mean as many as receive him that the immediate power to become you mean we have to become in His image you mean as we add a headstone we become in this very image it is very like this you mean some people will be changed and transformed I'm not just sit in church but they're gonna press their way into a position where the spirit have the preeminence or glory their God makers of a Christian act like a Christian should and if you put your faith in God's Word on your eyes towards heaven and let your hands let me back it at the knees and be reverent before God someday someday God will take you to one side and give you a power and a gift that the whole world will know he has been with you there will be no impersonation to that or Gloria god when god bless you god bless you when god promote you got promote you and when god promote you no man could be motive or glory to God did you get that when caught promote you nothing could be more chief or make what put hallelujah glory Lagoon amen is it my brother sister it may be seated we try to make denomination we try to build churches we try to organize people and you keep them it's all in vain until the love of God comes in you want to speak in tongues you want to clap your hands you want to jump you want to dance you want to do certain things and because of a Christian you will never be until the love of God takes over in your heart that tears the middle out that makes you feel for your brother that make you act like a man like a child of God and put Christ in you the hope of glory until the church come to that she will still be a total failure and always will be and that is why the Holy Spirit inspired the Prophet to stick brotherly kindness right at the top just underneath Holy Spirit he put brotherly kindness right there because faith the pull on the cap is based on forgiveness so he put the Holy Ghost right on top of brotherly kindness there is no way you could break out or breed true without the spirit of forgiveness I'm talking about kindness - saying worldly kindness I'm not talking about app I'm talking about the spirit of it may be seated all glory to God we're moving on hallelujah God took what about to an experience he was in a restaurant condemning a woman and say God why did you destroy this place if that's the place my daughter gonna grow up in and so on like that and got tapping on his shoulder pulling my side brick a vision before him so all his sins growing up before God show the blood of Jesus like a bump up blocking them blocking on sure his name are I write a book right pattern drop in the sea of forgetfulness he said no I forgive you and you condemn her how we fixing that how are you gonna fix this thing hallelujah all of a sudden hallelujah it changes the picture because he's glad to be talking about he said my thoughts and not your toys or glory to God glory to God he said my toes and not your toys Oh glory to God you may see that woman and condemn her but what is God thoughts about her you may see Saul persecuting the Christians but what is God talks about brother Saul because so is about to be transformed even become Paul the Lord hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God let me season so we can't write off anybody we can't cut off anybody if people want to get caught of let them cut of the self but we can't cop of anybody here's why the spirit and the bride say come the spirit and the bride don't say go the spirit and the bride say come let him back here and say come whosoever will come Oh glory to God and that's why sure they've reflected perfection when those same brothers that's all Joseph when those same brothers came into the presence of Joseph Oh glory to God he said don't condemn yourself God did this all God send me ahead to preserve life they hear that him without a cause that's terrible if I do you something and you hit me that is one thing but you hit me but of course there was nothing that shows us and that sees in you that Joseph series in you there was nothing against the brain she is justified she is justified as if she never did sent or chlorine Oh God you are free tonight you are free tonight the pride is justified you may be seated you say I don't feel so I didn't invite you to express your feelings I invited you to believe what God said he said my thoughts are not your thoughts so even if you don't feel it it doesn't mean it's not so because who he foreknew he called who he called justified and whom he justified he had already glorified or glory to glory man you loved him tonight hallelujah glory to God may be seated hallelujah so in seeds is more work than reaping soin is simply the work that must be done hallelujah we gather of the issues in your life you know were said there that sow in tears shall reap in joy it's not the tears bring in the crop it's the sewing that is bringing the trouble if you try and see if you're in pain step so if your issues in your life you're still off the show [Applause] you could cry for months if you don't so you wouldn't reap but they not so intense so in pain so in its trouble so and everybody said not now is not the time to show but you not regarding the clothes you have to be got in the red you know the Bible says you may be seated what a lazy man to see he said lying in the street I can't go on you may be seasoned you can't wait for your problems to be solved too soon you have to show where they are problems whether you can't pay your bills major challenges so if we go now Reviver we have to show for that revival or glowing of God so in his heart the tears don't produce the crop you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah or glory to God but there's a different kind of tears though the anguish the tsiyon the crying the travail a soul because the tired of your condition and situation and you recognize God is your help your present help in a time of trouble and no one can help you but God you smile with that sister but inside a pain you shake your hand with that brother but it's a pest in your spirit in your heart in your soul that is what God want to hear from you not a put-on not a pretense but a living reality on Jesus he cried if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink Oh glory to God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah Marie it's impressive how God chose her you may be seated they bring a point of reference from agriculture sowing and planting to bring a word to his people it's interesting because the soy sometime is very hard and you have to break up the fallow ground when you sense put in seed and it wrong hard hard hard rock you won't shake you to check off your pride and she go to attitude and ship you but you come down like soft and mellow or glory to God hallelujah glory to God amen hallelujah you say brother over no but suffering and and all these breaking it may be seated Isaiah he shall grow up this 52 about Jesus who I believe or report to whom is the Amalur reveal he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of a dry ground he had no form or comeliness that when we see him there's no beauty we should desire him he is despised one rejected of men to a man of Charles tree I created a degree for we hid as war faces on him he was despised and we esteemed not Charlie he had borne our griefs carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and I just tighten our peace was upon him but a Branham fought you may be seated he said I always wanted Jesus Christ to be manifested without one floor he wanted to get Christ to the people Oh hallelujah Oh glory to God we believe that James 5:7 2:10 be patient therefore brethren under the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman who waited for the precious fruit of the earth and had long patience for it until receiving latter rain be also patient stablish your hearts for the coming of the Lord Joe at 9 crutch not against one another bedroom lessee be condemned behold the judge talent before the door take my breath and the prophets who had spoken in the name of the Lord for example of suffering affliction and of patience so Court have been written all these years for this glorious harvest God waited till and had his even to call this lovely bride Oh glory to God settlement and God even know God come back and sit and even to kept a lovely bride that Pratt is gonna be there you are going to make it I believe that with all my heart or glory to God so in fate and Corbin to bless sir in obedience or glory to God so in repentance so when we gnomes in the word so in charity there are so in tears shall reap in joy or glory not born 2nd Corinthians 9:6 but did I say he that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly he does sweat bountifully shall reap also bountifully Oh glory to God and the Holy Spirit was sent to water the seed and somebody read it that William Branham he was guts enter reach the entire seat think about a Peter Chandler from Genesis to Revelation the seed of the entire Bible so the entire bed would have to be new and I support up to wrap the entire vibe as a seed and put it inside you and I so God put that seed like a miracle under the Seventh Seal put seven thunders under there and tied it right up inside of that on the nail not a devil will know nothing about it silence put the seed inside of you and the devil don't know what's inside of you because he can't discern ad hoc or the thoughts inside aha so what put his seed inside of your heart no the devil can't get inside idea to mess with that seed or glory to God out see this original that see this pure all glory to God do you believe that nothing wrong with disease you know the ground becomes the issue stony ground hallelujah rocky ground tour Negro hallelujah nothing is wrong with the message nothing is wrong with the seven thunders nothing is wrong with the seven seals nothing is wrong with this message [Applause] that's why maybe Caesar don't like policy once I'm Apollo's I'm appalled and this ECI Scannell its flesh inside the way man getting in front ago to me affecting the flow of things and then he said one show one reap but one show on water but quad give the increase God is who want to bring the increase but somebody after soul and somebody after water if your so our seniors have tap water to bring it forward let's continue the Spirit of God comes forward to water the seed at this back up a bit you may be seated they don't smoke what is your own seed Jesus is the word of God and he was busted open the life is inside the seed and this life which is the spirit was water flowing over the spirit over the seed of God will bring forth the light of the seed and it bring forth something else there is some kind of seed there do you understand if the Spirit of God comes forth to water the seed if it see it is watering it reproduces the life of the sea so when Jesus died water was released which the spirit was released because seeds were coming and that water of release is to come to your seed so right now you haven't manifested what they're supposed to yet because you're waiting for the water to come to your sea and every seed will be for after its kind Oh glory to God so he said I believe the Bible is the whole truth and Jesus the word made manifest he was that seed that Eve should have produced he was the sea that Eve was to produce but she hybrid it by disbelieve in God's Word so he was the seed and the only way that life could be reproduction of life life had to come to that seed and in order to spread out the life can't you see it that is why the water was given water deceit the holy spirit that was in the Garden of Eden was the water the seed and that's what we will fight the holy spirit on the devil would fight the holy spirit and fight the atmosphere and fight the worship and have it on the connor intellectual just talk and talk and killing time with no atmosphere and the atmosphere made the difference that's why you come to create an atmosphere he said no minister grabbing a revival if the minister's can bring revival we should have it a long time ago he said every five I'll have to come by the people you have to bring revival from when you're home some in your lives and when you come and understand by revelation and inspiration that you have to bring the revival not only that you said God is written for the people to call upon God to get his servants into action or we are one of the big men and big this and big Bob's imessage Pope and who is the man of the hour and what not all that foolishness of the cut out there waiting on you if you don't pray the drive and move the way it is supposed to move but when you come under expectation when you come and begin the water with your praises and worship watch them men of God began to speak by direct inspiration what score's men or give the Lord a shock Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah since know how great the man is and oh great the pastor is and all good is evangelist is I'm hungry this one is it's not that who is Paul with the bottles one water one show but it's god but God give the increase or glory to God a man maybe sees it if you want the church start with the Word of God you want the life of God stop with the Word of God accept the word and its fullness know there is where you laughter in brothers coming up you see where you're going after a while he said no watch then the works will be manifested in him at the same for it is the same seed Word of God God son was his example seed and if his life was when that spirit world after him and his baptism and the Holy Ghost come upon him here we go the very life does he produce that same water in Spirit of the Holy Ghost will bring forth the same kind of a life doing the same thing he did if it is the same seed Son of God seeded hallelujah so let me say this now 82 so-called faithful ministers before the resurrection Jesus of these ministers if it were them the same dong disgusted in the ministers Association meeting how great day I hope hopefully earth casts on whatever say the devil devil run you know be seated you have arguments among themselves one married common and say put once animal left and put one on the right they want on who have a greater ministry and so on when somebody doing something separate out of

healing Brinson they have questions shall he live till he come and all kind of questions then get power yet what the guys didn't understand that the power that was given to these guys was temporary power it wasn't permanent power it wasn't resident power these guys were preaching cosmo devils having gifts of ensigns having wonders and was temporary because when the epileptic spirit came down the contrasted oh but he's brown say here come of a live voice here come Jesus come off the mountain and here were seven living voices when that Devil see that vultures coming down because them voices are slash them voices to speak without using words like thunder when them devil saw that life walking they begin to tremble one time or glory of God and he talked about the bride they're gonna have live voices they're gonna have the voices I gotta shake the DeMars Kingdom [Applause] maybe season so after Jesus openly understanding open up the world to them and said you shall receive the promise of my father Terry in the siege of Jerusalem until you be endued with an anointing that's not descriptors until you be endued with an apple said that not descriptors until you be endued with power from on high powerless do things in them if we involve much in this place the paw of the water will be a whole big stream a river that result it will sweep sickness out oh yeah yeah the power oh no God didn't

lot some praises [Applause] so there's a fight for ministry yet I'm people fighting that we got a priest so long maybe season fightin a preacher I've long ministry so much' years and all they're doing that God tests them if they believe the Prophet they identify with the message but in message a I've ever done yet said on a minute men identify with the message but some point in time God gonna be get the step and identify himself with you this is my son I am with him I'm anointed here devil you could watch him but you can't touch him because he is my man that I put on the earth or give the

criticize fool oh they that sow in tears shall reap in joy Oh glory to God Amen hallelujah poor glory to God just a little more oh my this one this one is something special to me once I remember he may be seated I remember still a year and six months in the book of Revelation and that is what I been teaching I love I just love teaching I think it's wonderful it gives the basis and settles the church know in preaching now there are some people are apprecia they can pick up the word with inspiration and sweet audiences that is watering the seeds that the teacher has taught [Applause] they're not soup so if we don't have an understanding of how the gifts operate we could mystic things so the teacher brings the seed and a lot of people like the boss and said you know the teacher positionally pleases you Coburn said that and the preacher the Evangelist is preached you're mine or something like that so they're making mockery in front of preachers and they have an affinity and a cruces that I want to teach us but my question is what are you being pleased for if the teacher is placing you and I then you have to be placed for to receive power not placed place that's why some of them sit in church so that night not the place the teachers need them into the place they can't move right now the taking notes in there please when they're supposed to listen to tape for my right and OSA and worship God and create the atmosphere get place [Applause] we had fifty years of work mystery mystery mystery mystery si si si where are the preachers to bring the water to the very seed one soul but God gonna give the increase my my my a little you may be seated I'm not brethren who like to see Baran say and he's almost like a mockery he's a he's a very forceful speaker and he just rocked back on a soft and a teaching and a teaching but when when a preacher come he's a very forceful you know but Rama wasn't like that good he was the Prophet yeah yeah oh watch it prophets prophesy let's continue an impression there are some people that are preachers they can pick up the word with inspiration and suite out there in places that's water in the seas that the teacher has taught now you got to put some Syrian first and then water it and the watering comes from the preaching of the word I want to hear bigger than that because if you want I could come back and teach you know I can rock back and teach teach or preach alright here we go I just teasin now watch there's a vast difference between a teacher and a preacher it is two different gifts of the Spirit altogether and as I humbly say this I have a gift of either he was a prophet he said no preacher I have no teacher but he he don't have the gift of either by two different gifts so do we get at church Mary's belief and I believe you notice one know Mary could have waited till she had some kind of sign that she was going to be mother and you could read after the meeting is over until you feel that you could move your crippled leg or a little better you could hear or that deaf air or cancer seemed to be it wasn't burn you so much that is not taking God at His Word to take God at His Word is the hairs word accepted and stop rejoicing in it your rejoice is evidence that you have to take one of this world because faith is the substance of what you open for it's the evidence of what you have not seen so once I receive it because a hallelujah thank you Lord have a healing me tonight thank every literally tonight glory hallelujah I'm somebody next to you don't know why you talking hallelujah
