[41:37] praise God
[41:39] Hebrews 12 1-2 he said we're foreseen we

[41:47] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[41:50] every weight
[41:51] and the scene which does so easily beset

[41:58] that is set before us looking unto Jesus
[42:02] The Altar and finisher of our faith
[42:05] who for the joy that

[43:10] praise God and every man does Private
[43:14] for the Mastery is temperate in all
[43:16] things
[43:17] now they do it to obtain a corruptable
[43:21] crown but we an incorruptible
[43:24] Usain Bolt is running and is the best
[43:27] runner about all the things he's
[43:29] obtaining are corruptable crowns but
[43:32] brother our race we obtain an
[43:34] Incorruptible crown I therefore so run
[43:38] not as uncertainly so fight I not as one
[43:42] that beat the air but I keep under my
[43:45] body and bring it into subjection less
[43:48] that by any means when I have preached

[43:55] Away
