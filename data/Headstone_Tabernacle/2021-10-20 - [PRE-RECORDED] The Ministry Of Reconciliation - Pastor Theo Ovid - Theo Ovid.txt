amen and amen so i believe that um you know we in for a great time and there's something upon my heart this morning that i want to get into i'm venturing into new territory so you all doing fine i want a salute by the steve manoveria i was there in the parameeting on thursday and don't you worry we have some plans in mind i have a vision concerning the permitting and those who can't make it out what we'll do how we get connected and so on but we want to do something considering that on tuesday night but permeating was really really powerful the inspiration that burst even brought it was really a blessing to me and to see the anointing of the holy ghost and what i am so excited about is that i don't have to be here the what has to be here must be the holy ghost [Applause] i want to say a big amen you see i see so many churches where is the man the man the pastor the pastor good lord the pastor died god have mercy but when you have the holy ghost is next contestant you know moses my servant is dead now joshua you take the people over but i've got time to waste god is god he's big enough he will use anybody he could get his hands on if he get his hands on little samuel he's gonna use him he gonna use hannah he's gonna use anna he gonna use whoever he gets his hands on couldn't we give the lord there's a brother there in in uh in in our church church you see a smoker for 30 years and he had lungs what had whatever lungs issue he said god healed him oh god and he was blowing brought me to tears he was blowing amazing grease within mo talking and sound like that and was

god oh hallelujah gonna be a drunkard out there a smoker out there what hallelujah dying out there where would i be but for the grace of god [Applause] so why the big shot attitude why are the arrogance why are you somebody everybody want to be somebody hallelujah say everybody want to go to heaven but nobody want to die god is good i don't feel like i'm warming up you know i'm warmed up already oh glory so this morning we want to stand thank you musician uh we want to go into the word and one two two portion scripture from ephesians two and second corinthians chapter five i think i'll do something a little different this morning we will read it together which is uh ephesians two and i will read second corinthians chapter 5. let's read ephesians 2 we're going to read the whole chapter ephesians 2 reading from verse 1. and then we'll turn over to second corinthians 5 was 14 to 21. ephesians 2. you have it amen together 3 4 and you had he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time paths he walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love where it he had loved us even when we were dead in sins had quickened us together with christ by grace he has saved and had raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and not of yourselves it is a gift of god not of works least any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god had before or deen that we should walk in them wherefore remember that he been in times past gentiles in the flesh who were called uncircumcision by ditch that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time you were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world but now in christ jesus you who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ for he is our peace who had made both one and had broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in the ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were far off unto them which were nigh for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together grow it unto unholy temple in the lord in whom he also build it together for an habitation of god through the spirit and i will read the next scripture from second corinthians 5 14 to 21 and it reads thus now he that had wrought us for the self-same thing is god who had given us the earnest of the spirit therefore okay we just stop right there let's bow our heads for prayer almighty god we thank you for divine love and presence may you send on your spirit upon your people tonight and confirm a word with signs one is and miracles we ask in jesus name amen you may be seated oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah praise god blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah just give him some praises here precious yes [Applause] yes [Applause] turn your bibles to second corinthians chapter five i know what happened something was strange i was reading from verse four something there but it's four fourteen so that's the goat of the first fourteen of of you could choose obviously ii corinthians five verse fourteen for the love of christ constrained us because we just judged that if one died for all then were all dead and that he died for all that they which live should henceforth here we go live unto themselves not live unto themselves but unto him that died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh ye though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know him no more therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature all things are passed away behold all things have become new and all things are of god who would reconcile us to himself by jesus christ and had given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ's head be reconciled to god for he have made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him now we can give god a shout of praise [Applause] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord oh it's so good to be here have a title the ministry of reconciliation of a subject fitly framed together for the habitation of god by the have spirit inspiration it's a big one to broadly kindness at charity glory that's a huge one oh praise god first peter 4 8 says above all things have fulfilled charity among yourselves four charities shall cover the multitude of sins yes you have charity that's charity on fire that is charity that you could feel it you could see it you could touch it you could know it there's not a smile like you're trying to force a smile this is charity five and charity this is the love of god express this is the love of god manifest this is not talking the talk this is walking the talk have fun charity among yourselves purpose charity gonna cover multitudes of sense hallelujah what kind of sin is going to be wrong but with the only charity will be covering the sins oh do you believe that hallelujah my my my my mind oh glory hallelujah i want to read the scripture in the amplified and uh to see where we get some there this same scripture we read from corinthians but i want to get to 18 and 1990 in particular listen to these words but all things are from god who through jesus christ reconcile us to himself receive us into favor and brought us into harmony with himself and give to us the ministry of reconciliation that by word and deed we might be aim to bring others into harmony with him this is the one i want to get to it was personally present in christ reconciling and restoring the world to favor with himself hallelujah not counting up or hauling against men their transp transpo their trespasses but canceling them oh i just love that i love that i am looking for for god to cancel what is in your life and you to cancel what is in your brother's life and that you don't hold your trespass against this one and what this one do you and what this one said to you i want to see a cancellation a cancellation of deaths of sins of of whatever hallelujah whatever transgression oh hallelujah god want to cancel praise god to justify you as if you never did it in the first place oh my god i'm going to have myself a revival here this morning oh hallelujah god has committed this ministry of reconciliation and as god was in christ reconciling the world to himself that same ministry gonna come back oh give the lord a shout in the house oh hallelujah be reconciled to god this morning [Applause] oh hallelujah let me read it watch if it was god personally present in christ reconciling and restoring and what the world to favor with himself not counting up and holding against men their trespasses but canceling them and committing to us the message of reconciliation of the restoration to favor you see when you're in sin when in a contrary condition you're out of favor with god god not smiling with you he is not with you but the reconciliation ministry bring you back in fear with god by cancelling hallelujah by canceling are you not hearing what i'm saying by canceling your trespasses oh give the lord a shout so you don't have to condemn your own self you have to accept his pardon you have to accept his grace you have to accept his cancellation of all what you owe so that's why jesus could say who the son of man set free is free indeed free indeed free indeed oh you are free this morning you are freed of worship you are free to praise god the holy ghost is here this morning anything could happen hallelujah if the holy ghost is your healing is here bridge you is here what's the sense having a dead god what's that sin having a dead message he is the same yesterday today and forever oh hallelujah what's the sense having a dead church oh glory to god amen oh

be one more ride the spirit and the pride will say come what will do that the ministry of reconciliation oh hallelujah that's a hidden mystery [Applause] had to be you may be seated all these nut cases and crazy house in this message that had to be a hidden mystery that people are going to be reconciled to god it means you would look past their sins you look past their failures you look past their fortunes you go past all of that you begin to see through the eyes of god for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son all glory to god what was it it was the grace and mercy because that's the watch that's why we are here [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah let's look at the shout out it's not here you start shouting you are shouting don't let me tell you where you started all i know you're inside here i know you didn't know start shouting because the scripture said where was thou when i laid the foundation of the earth and the morningstar sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy oh we continue to shout that we had back there even the lord he sent it with a shout out and we can't shout the message out they've got to be crazy oh hallelujah praise god i'll

quickness you can't come and let god call you you can't be even alive unless god quicken you out of your condition oh you're not hearing what i'm saying my god i want to see you put on your dancing shoes praise god how you can't dance you know but when you come into dancing shoes you will pants like miriam dance when she saw all the sins in the bank of the river when she saw all what feral all this amen in the red sea she danced on the bank of the river prophet said the reason there's no dancing they don't have enough victory praise god when they get victory you're gonna dance you're gonna shout praise god ain't no rock until praise me he gonna let the rocks praise him my god don't let the rocks cry out hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the angel told those us this woman why seek the living among the dead he is not dead he is risen i know you expect a deadness but he is not dead the seven thunders is not dead the seventh under the seven voices that conquered the devil in every age under the land anointed under the ox anointing under the man anointed under the eagle anointed there were seven voices behind all those anointed okay the lord some praises [Applause] oh hallelujah the shout out of the king is in the camp [Applause] when he pulled the first seal white horse second seed red horse then black horse then play horse devil looking to receive okay i see it i see it but he couldn't see the submarines he couldn't see the seven alarms he couldn't see the submarines that's why when god pulled these seven seals union silence that's when the devil got messed up he said there was nothing there there's no revival there there was no shouting there there was no brick you dear there's no holy ghost there but there is nothing there they can't come back but we have news for endeavor my god hallelujah hallelujah the sons of god are coming back we are back [Applause] oh what an announcement to make this morning what an announcement to make this morning we are back and hell is in trouble oh hallelujah praise god oh hallelujah praise god praise god give the lord a shout you open your mouth and give the lord a shout glory to god the sons of god is back [Applause] colossians 1 you see the people in the message don't know the bible they know a lot more about them but god told daniel to seal division and prophecy that's two different things because you have the message they have topics and seed pope rome what that's topics that's a prophecy to unveil and so on but there has to have a vision a vision put it all together that you could see where you come from you could see where you are and you can see where you're going and when you know where you come from and you know where you're going the devil is in trouble [Applause] how many understand that i know you heard me preach it but i'm gonna say it again elisha type the bride elijah was the prophet when elisha got the taste of that mantle he felt something he caught a vision he's a young man elijah was an old man he's going home god told him to pull out that young man drop the mantle and pull it off and this is what god does he put the anointing upon you and pull it off for you to go through the process for you to go through the wilderness foreign because character is not a gift character is a victory and god wanted that victory that he could shout this morning [Applause] are you with me you see when you slap up the devil over the weekend friday on saturday you're on top of the mountain on sunday morning [Applause] when the devil knocked you on your jaw and i stretch out to bring you in service we know we having a tough time you need to overcome you need overcoming no no you don't need big victories any little ones overcome the ants overcome the cockroach overcome a snake the hope the sisters will get frightened but i mean it's small things overcome the beer overcome the lion because goliath is on his way god not going to send good luck as a first trial you would your um will turn around and you will just just fall right back boop you'll be out cool you prefer to wheel yourself out than to look at that giant but when you have the experience let's experience hallelujah when

grandchildren all have to get fired all have to be sealed all have to be called all have to be anointed all because the devil ought to receive all that dwell on the earth except those whose names written and if your name is written in that lands book you gonna know it because you will connect to the word that is being spoken alive to you we're not preaching our own thoughts we are preaching thus say of the lord freshly cooked and big manner this morning you better rejoice you better shout because the bible said it'd be found in the last days not for books and tips it'd have thousands and tons of books and tapes yeah i'm not famine for that but for the hearing what is that the preaching of the prophetic vision hallelujah but before jesus come there'll be a fallen away first fallen away of people believers ministers preachers following from song doctrine into cuckoo stuff because people have itchiness they are tickling them the airs the airs all of that is prophecy in the last days of itching airs people they're not satisfied with the promised word they find it staying too long they want a preacher that could tickle their ears without tickling their heart oh glory to god the

priest jesus jesus wasn't in that gear when the leper was coming have mercy upon me though son of david help me amen lepers just say go on yourself to the priest in those days lepers had to stay fire from the people highly contagious he said go and show yourself just keep walking go and show yourself to the priest what you do in obedience to god as foolish as it might look your obedience to god brings your blessing [Applause] you cannot stay there and argue with you say jesus lay hands on me i see any hands on people i am moving but you will stay with the leprosy because you had to move in order to get healed because that instruction was move in time go and show yourself to the priest and everybody that obeyed god blessed and one man when he got his heel and he turned back he said lord i come to thank you i come to appreciate you i come to worship you i come to honor you i come to glorify you he said where are the rest [Applause] die faith hot many hall the rest just got blessed but you have faith because faith worships faith give god glory faith abraham's tagged not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god so your worship is a testament it's a testimony of your faith [Applause] that's like the first thing when you're in trouble your capri is good derpa is zipping your mouth yeah four bees 24 elders thousands and told you them

you're a big shirt you're big insane you you like yourself you don't wanna understand that we can't do anything in ourselves it's not what you can do it's what he has already done [Applause] and you that was sometimes alienated enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now had he reconciled in the body of flesh to death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight if you continue wounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and we just preached to every creature which is under heaven or of i paul i mean a minister and this he will do providing that you continue to stay with and in the faith in christ well grounded and so on oh hallelujah from paradox he said abraham election isaac calling jacob grace to the perfection nothing against him that was god working its way out so god put a seed in you [Music] his seed in you and he began to work his way out he put a seed in your soul the devil can't go there he could mess with the spirit send you mad but he can't mess with the soul did you hear that so somebody could be mental or whatever you saw that in the spiritual the mind and all kind of thing go and have nuts but he can't touch what's in your soul but once that seed inside that soul begin to press push when you come to church you get to feed that seed that's he's crying for more water that's he's crying for the world you see you're going somewhere you need to be empowered you need to be equipped and he know what his wife have need of come on say amen somebody so when jesus come on the scene he come to minister to meet your needs start to rejoice and shout because god wants to minister and meet your needs holy hallelujah nobody burn them four death messengers kill the tree isn't that right palmer lucas conqueror and caterpillar four messengers of roman devils kill that tree but god promised to restore one of those guys took the fruit one took the leaves one took the back the last one took the life kill the tree but he couldn't kill the roots [Applause] god put some hidden stuff in the roots and god said i will restore because when god put something in you deep down in the roots you see you see a big strong tree that big strong tree have some deep roots that you can't see what you can see is what make that tree what it is oh hallelujah when you see somebody standing in god it has some deep roots that the child's gonna but it can't shake you off your tree on the rock your boat going to rock but we have an anchor my god the storm may be raging the sea may be turning the boat could be

had to send for messengers of life to restore the tree luther brought justification wesley sanification pentecostals the restoration of the gifts and the holy ghost what was the thought the thought was the word therefore if we stay with the word we stay with the life because the word has the life so all these years god was getting the life in because he disguised the life as the word and the secret is the word is in the bride and what she's waiting for she's waiting for dynamics the anointing the glory the presence the shekinah she's ready for the robe she's ready for joseph rainbow coat rebecca's veil she's made with the other half of the chinese ticket however you say it [Music] in the meantime in the desert in your wilderness you're getting stronger oh my god that's what the trials is to do you know not about a week or quarter week that's a choice that's a choice there's some people like the loaf they don't want to walk they didn't have a lady she's begging america to beg him she's begging any night time dressed like an old lady but she's begging and everybody gives you money she's standing up long manhattan with all the rich people passing and whatnot all those big expensive stores so somebody decided to check this one out because she's not looking right so she had crutches and she crawling like this so let the camera fall and she every night they follow and she fall on her they see when she changed she went in a van change because she wake come on normal walk in normal walk to the house next day she come back out they track her for a while then they come camera works now really intervenor how long you're sick but we see it last night walking normal normal are she hobbling away hobbling away hopping away she just bursted con woman trickster hallelujah are people like that they intend to get by by any means necessary it doesn't matter is this principle is as right as wrong just to get the the mighty dollar that can't bring no joy and peace and assurance and whatnot and god has something without money without price what's the purpose of gaining the whole world losing your own soul so many people don't even understand how temporary you are your little child already replacing you you don't even know that hallelujah praise god and we just see them as little children and don't see them 20 years from now 30 years from now we're not seeing that like it's veal from our eyes that's his life oh hallelujah get serious folks i like to say it this way we are only here from point a to point z to do something for god for god not for yourself or your family for god for god if god come down now and say what have you done for the kingdom in the last 20 years where's your answer where i went to church is that right for the kingdom what do you do to contribute to what's the kingdom of god because all what you have in life doesn't conquer you your car your house your fridge your stove you're saying i like your stove you like it your room set you said i'm on there's a nice bed head you have that bed not going into sorry that limousine is not going we're staying right back are you with me so for the short time we have let's do our best for his glory for his kingdom that's why canada understand the parade of ministers and men trying to present themselves instead of presenting god because that's how we have mr pope because men came forward and shift the holy ghost out men overpowered the laity and it was no longer god of the audience was god the man man man pastor pastor pastor bishop bishop bishop nobody make it easy you remember the prayer you have none spraying for you you could sin and make it easy you sin you do a little hand like that shake a little water on you and you're good if that is god's program you're fine but that is not god's problem so you need the blood you need to repent you need to have a desire to get right with god isn't that right so the fourth one was the word isn't that right in the last day malachi for elijah has to come with the very word the word of god came to the prophet to bring the fourth light what was the thought was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the resurrection sign that christ here we go finally after justification being planted suffocation being planted the baptismally goes organization died out and christ here we go has again centered himself like the cap of the pyramid first line justification certification then hope button holy ghost then the coming of the care what did he say abraham fate jacob love isn't that right jacob grace jose perfection isn't that right jose perfection is the last line which is the word which is the light which is the fourth light is joseph isn't that right joseph perfection means there's nothing against you that's god working his way out what is that that is you being justified and i could read that for you justified doesn't mean forgive him justified means as if you never did it [Music] you remember when it went long the green began to ripen and watch before that green can ripen everything in that talk has to be dead can't you see where we are standing life is in the grain again what is

where you are going to be fitted in that holy spirit slot is the capstone for the bride and that l-o-v-e is christ coming down his corporal body and he is sending a spirit down into the church to

sundays when they come to church i told them in kentucky the killer bull doesn't come to church but ibrahim didn't meet the killable in church killer bulls is not found in church killable is found out in the field and you don't know when you're going to meet up you're killable [Music] oh my god the amends have to disappear you better say amen because that killable was to express something that adam had what was it he said love love love came over him he forgot the gun at the bar at the fence and the killable he forgot about the killable here come the killable what are you going to do you can't run him territory he knows his grounds he knows his ability he has killed before that's why he's called killable he has a reputation to uphold and keep he said sorry for disturbing you i'm a servant of god he's talking to the bill now what they got adam have dominion over every piece of the field that was a field there was a beast in the field and he was representing another adam god arranged the scenario god arranged him to forget the gun because he said if he had a gun he was going to shoot the bull and barbara [Music] but god arranged it that he forgot the the gun by the right back back by

lions could shut mountain or they know what to do you know when the sons of god start to come forth come on come on jordan know what to do when elijah strike the jordan didn't even talk or give the lord a shout in the house we were called to be masters of the earth we were called to be [Applause] dominators [Applause] conquerors [Applause] not not not the word that john said uh adores redeemers by their blood and we shall reign on the earth terrain is to rule to conquer to overcome to dominate that is what it is not to take what the devil give you to set it back in his face oh give the lord some praises i can see you starting to rebuke sickness rebuking diseases rebuking demon powers take back your land i want to hear a bigger aiming than that take back [Applause] take back your land revelation freedom of religion that's the lamb then the lambs speak like a dragon no more freedom they enact in laws what they couldn't do by force by by other means they're bringing it as a law this is now the law but ram saw it he said they will close down the churches because the act of the law is contrary to what god say in his word so the churches will have a choice hear what man say or hear what god say and they're going to close along the churches and he said the churches will become store houses they don't care citizens have an agenda look how foolish they come with this bathroom thing now male female they want everybody to use the same bathroom some people don't know if they're he or she call it him or she will have male female and fashion whoever else in the go there but they want to force everybody because there's an agenda agenda to corrupt the world that's lucifer again but we see him in action the prophet tell us it will come a tightening but when they start to press ourselves watch for the turtle then because god has to release a power to face beast power that's not just a beast it's a beast's power you can't feel the beast ball with a scripture or some daily word i'll show you what i'm talking about when the people got the holy ghost in the upper room bahram said those demons say they're just excited leave them alone they feel their own the dancing and shouting and have a lot of noise in the upper room that is this noise when peter make that man walk but only the devil got up and said no this is serious now this we can't let continue this we have to stop dynamic books and tapes and hand no tracks that is the same jesus you you you're not hearing what i'm saying that jesus troubled that devil you know [Applause] [Music] oh hallelujah when when when when satan and them saw the same power flowing through jesus to peter which is disciples now because because jesus was representing son of man the holy ghost is son of god son of god always follow son of man son of man is word sower bringing seed son of god is holy spirit bringing water bringing fire bringing green so son of man brought seed openly understand to the scriptures give them the full word that they have divine revelation of what to expect then they created atmosphere of worship in the upper room and then son of god came down pillar of fire giving each one their portion so now they are anointed with god the seed in them is now alive the anointing is with them fire is with them power is with them not yet expressed until the need arises so when peter was going to the gate called beautiful that man everybody knew that man even peter custom giving a man another coin or something but that day peter was broke i broke a puzzle he said silver and gold i don't have so it's okay to be broke but such as i have i give it unto you but if they could do better do better oh hallelujah rise up and walk oh give the lord a shout in the name of jesus and i tell some of you up inside of here rise up and walk [Applause] stand up and give the lord some praise right now [Applause] oh hallelujah you wanna be seated praise god [Applause] all right [Music] hallelujah oh get the lord praise his people we want that revival we're gonna have that revival a test it's a burning desire oh glory [Applause] [Music] ah some of you better pray in your heart right now god created a twist in me but it's even preaching on tuesday night i this is a painful desire he read something about a woman was so tasty looking for water look in the water and she wasn't driving his car she saw a little spool of water in some river somewhere she just jumped over the camera and straight underneath the water she wasn't even studying what kind of what it is she was just so tasty that's how you must be for god [Applause] where is your test is there any man test let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water

your sister you'll be concerned about your children you'll be concerned about your husband you'll be concerned about your wife you'll be concerned about who you are attack with there'll be a burden upon your spirit you wouldn't just walk the church and come back inside the church you'll be on fire because the world is dying glory [Applause] more diseases more bacteria more diseases more kind of thing on the earth we will need the power of god to challenge sicknesses and diseases when diseases when jesus comes when they see the sun they have to leave don't you want to see that can't you live for that can't you press for that some of you stuck in a humanistic realm but we read just no man after the flesh this is not a country church we're not in kiowa we're not in the bush this is real god bless you on the internet got a testimony for my sister quite in australia who listens to the service new zealand in new zealand she asked if i could come across here people blessed hearing truth hearing a vision yeah yeah people want to fight this fighting now losing battle hallelujah praise god because god gave us a vision and when god gave a man a vision to give him purpose give him ambition that man gonna get to where he is going because god put something inside of him that is why elijah the prophet couldn't stop elijah he said stay here the man said no i'm not staying here prophet or no prophet why because a vision was burdened into the mighty spirit when a vision breaks inside of you no money will stop you no elder no deacon no bishop no hyman law man [Applause] this is a sovereign church in trinidad we have no bishops we have no ruler we have no headquarters [Applause] the headquarters is the holy ghost when you understand that you want the contacted waters for yourself go give the lord some praises [Applause] hallelujah all things work together for good to them that love god not some things say all things shouted out all things say hello to all things all things work together for good [Applause] to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose if you feel that tug in your heart tonight to be reconciled back to god you are blessed you are blessed but some of you sitting there taking things for granted god could take prostitutes homemongers drunkards and bring them into this message and fill them with fire and the holy ghost and leave this bunch of religious people all over the world just sitting on the premises glory to god amen [Applause] trump in america he could say anything and he get more votes and he get more support he can say anything they call him a rule breaker people want change they're desperate for change do people want to give up privacy for protection are they going to do it stop this cut this off put a wall here do this yeah america once upon the time land of the free and the brave now the land of laws orders victims lamb spoke like the dragon oh yes we are going to be confronted with dragon ball amen get lighter now so you really think that all these years was the warmer to its bench and then go to glory i don't see it that way i could drop a bomb on here right now mom said the bride will be a haunted persecuted group and it's still not the tribulation yet it's just pressure heat heat heat the devil trying to raise it seven times hotter that's why you need seven thunders to fight that when the devil is of his heat we had to raise up our heat too you gotta get colder you're ever getting hotter and you're getting colder devil exposed for seven ages we could see his tricks we know what he came up with he have no more tools there weapon of war you know he manifests everything he can manifest already the last big cough is the spread of deception they knock on them and it says clean coal deceive spirited illusion knock them out with that but the bride on the word the devil know he can't get her off the word because i missed your trial you're giving away testimony the lord gave the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord the devil can't handle that when you just go wrong that go wrong your prayers got anyhow the devil can't handle that he wants you to be frustrated he wants you to be fed up you want to leave the church you want to leave god you want to leave christianity he wants you to let go that's his job to do that but our job is to stay put i said i am moving his doubles to make you fall your job is to get back up my god did you hear that you're jumping on the stairs we're gonna fall they will say yeah i'll help you and i enable you to fall but you who wants wicked in thoughts and man has he reconciled so badam says the word justified watch the word justified doesn't mean forgive him for instance if i got drunk done some evil things and everything then you come around and say to me you found out i didn't do them then you come and say brother brianna i forgive you forgive me i didn't do it but if i did do it i'm guilty you could forgive me but i wouldn't be guilty yet i'm not justified because i actually done it but the word justified is as though you never did it it's not even regarded it is in god's book of forgetfulness god have a book a sea called the sea of forgetfulness i like the name of that seed that's the about no fishing sign on it could the devil always looking to fish out something out of your life bring back some old stories but when it fall in that sea of forgetfulness not even god could remember remember [Applause] busy enough to run outside the church run around the church and get back up inside

fishing but there is nothing against you chosen perfection nothing against joseph abraham fate isaac love jacob grace truly perfection there is nothing against joseph joseph is the bride oh give the lord a shout you are justified this morning as if you never did it [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] now let's take a journey and go down to the woman at the well where jesus told his disciples he needs patrick samaria we have a woman who don't know who she is she don't know where she comes from he needs to share something with her she's in a condition she had five men and a bunch and ever it wasn't hers and jesus came to reveal her name on the book we know the story when he finished he said woman we know what we worship for salvation of the jews he said woman one jerusalem another place of worship he says the our command now is when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth no it couldn't be done before because the truth was lost to the seven ages so go send a prophet to restore back truth so know the truth is in the books and tapes and you have a ministry and ministries that brings out truth no you could worship there is no excuse you have no excuse not to worship worship is not because god gives you something what you have to do with who he is he is god [Applause] all by himself glory hallelujah he is god and god alone that's why i say worship him oh give him praise people [Applause] glory hallelujah the early church early believers they wandered in deserts caves of the earth there's hebrews 11. have a good report your fate received not the promise god having provided some better things for us that day without an austrian may be perfect you get it these people who died in here are dependent and waiting on us right now by the brand i'm written on us but a cold quran written on us all who died going and waiting on us for the dany written on us oh hell this is a cane waiting on us since there are williams waiting on us all the believers who pass on and be with the lord they're waiting on us this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection no perfection we have to wait and resurrection it takes perfection to bring on resurrection therefore we got to come into the perfection oh give the lord some praise his people hallelujah hallelujah glory to god watch watch this church is coming smaller in a minority and he's looking at the pyramid just as you see he's brought at the bottom feet virtue and i go to near to the top it's getting narrower narrower narrower less and less so as we get further up it's less and less you know going up that pyramid people slide over you know fit off keep on climbing come on now you're cast up at godliness or patience we have to say add add add until we can add to orderly kindness charity the message is in trouble because brotherly kindness is an issue big issue people have problems forgiven then how could they have the ministry of reconciliation without the spirit of you don't hear what forgiveness saying how how could the voice of the ministry of reconciliation be preeminent if there isn't the spirit of forgiveness but thank god for eagle prophet that said when the church finds [Applause] it's probably lord he prophesied that we're gonna find it now 2016 to probably live at the love of god oh give the lord praises oh hallelujah do i speak with the tongues of men and angels and have that charity it profited me nothing do i give my bodies to be burned and have not this love it is nothing [Applause] remember he sees it until the church gets to a place here we go till it's the same kind of ministry that this left [Music] that is a little more than plain tips and reading books it's a little more than that it's the same ministry hallelujah that was here has come back watch then when it comes this church has got to be honed he introduced a different word now you see you are stone that has to be cut and there's ministries that come to cut your stone because you are to be fitted in god not cutting the stone to fit you you cutting the fit into this capstone or this love stone or this headstone [Music] when the cap comes the pyramid itself the body of christ will have to be honed not only just some creed or doctrine or some other thing become true it have to be so so he is saying it clearly not doctrine not creed he said but it has to be so perfectly like christ till when he comes he and that ministry will spit smack together so he is saying the ministry of christ have to be reproduced again among god's people [Music] can we go a little further are you enjoying the word oh hallelujah question and answers i know what was the other question was i the son of man here it is i believe the son of man or was the pillar for the son of man no the pillar of fire is the anointing now that pillar of fire is the logos that went out of god which is actually the attribute of the fullness of god when man was made in the image of god then god came down in the image of man to redeem man and that brought man and god together heaven and earth hug and kiss each other god and man embrace each other fatherhood and sonship then the logos became flesh and dwelt among us now the logos that was in him which was the spirit of god the anointing amen through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought [Music] many sons to god which is anointed with the same logos on the day of pentecost it came down the pillar of fire broke apart and tongues of fire set up on each of them and an elected selected group identified by this pillar of fire showing that god had separated himself into man do you get it god the logos separating himself into men not in one person this is barbara marie he is in his church universal god was bottled and confined in one man jesus christ but now he is battled and confined in the whole universal church of the living god right now while god is speaking to us in our hearts he's in africa he's in asia he's in europe he's in england wherever believers i got it together he's in the midst of them could we give the lord praises [Applause] so anybody trying to lock god down in a group or a church they have a certain kind of deficiency in their mind [Music] they have mental problems because god is not battling himself up in no one man one man's show is over god going to use any man or woman he could put his hands on oh let god put his hands on you this morning oh hallelujah praise god then watch the works of it among us proves the same jesus that once lived in palestine the same spirit that was upon him has come to a body until it come back to headship again which he's becoming soon to claim the body the head is coming to the body you get it that will be here we go the son of god the son of man the son of david the i am the rose and sharon the leader of the valley the morning star i am not he this is bob brown the question was are you the son of man i am not he i am his servant and the pillar of fire is not he it's in spirit form which was upon the son of man has now come to anoint sons of men to bring back a ministry [Music] do you get that the same pillar of fire that was back there in the upper room has to come back and anoint men to bring back that same ministry we find out that the pyramid they never get the headstone on it why the headstone is yet to come now christ come into his body christ is the word we all know here we go the anointing is christ i love that christ is the word and christ is the anointing christ is the anointing that comes on the word that makes the word live that is the anointing christ is the anointing the spirit that comes upon the word to quicken the word and to make it live now the church has got to get to the ministry the church has to get to it the church can't stay where it is it has to get into position which is placed in christ oh give the lord a shout in the house we under something we're under something we under something now the church has got to get to the ministry until the church and christ become one get his bum he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the bible all is yours every promise of this age is yours when you get to that ministry oh hallelujah praise god praise god or give the lord some praises he said oh brother give me a church full of the holy ghost god will do in one year what all the theologians couldn't do and fought in 2000 years what the books and tapes could not do for the last 50 years god will win one year with the church full of the holy ghost oh give the lord some praises you wait till the anointing of church really strikes home then the door after the daughter of the gentile is closed god will anoint your church then he does fail to be filthy still oh my oh my oh my oh my oh my i tried to wrap up here oh glory to god for a message dedication and i wanted to get to this book of acts 7 chapter 44 verse he's reading the scripture our fathers had a tamil act of witness in the wilderness he had appointed speaking unto moses that he should make it according to fashion he had seen and which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the possession of the gentiles whom god dravel before the face of our fathers unto the days of david who found favor before god and was desires to find a tabernacle of god of jacob solomon built him on the house how be it the most high dwelleth nothing temples made with hands i said the prophet have missed my throne where is my footstool what house will you build me see the lord what is the place of my rest hath not my hands made these things and the book of hebrews 10 chapter 5 verse wherefore he cometh into the world and said sacrifices though an offering is not what it's not but a body has dope prepared me listen carefully if you notice the material wasn't found only in palestine this temple because it just wasn't there he had to go to the rest of the world the known world to find these paths that were going to the temple what a beautiful application that is that god don't just cut his material out of jews only out of the white only out of the brown or red or black or whatever colors they may be just out of united states only just over canada only he cuts his materials from all the world could we say amen to that [Applause] so no nation could claim we have all the materials no god arranged it for it to be around the world and if while they were cutting the stone a certain kind was found in such a part of the country maybe cutting a stone over another nation to fit to that stone was cut another nation it may seem to be very strange to the people the pastor i see odd looking stones being cut but god has his own way of doing something and i think he's doing the same thing today now we find out the materials being cut in their own native land was peculiar from a material cut in another native land we find out that they all transported it from oxcart and so forth some of them come by sea some by oxcar somebody floated down the dropper by raf so forth they all haul together all together they were coming to one place to one purpose to fulfill the command of god the cedars was not cut in lebanon lebanon cedars was the most noted season of the world there was one that redwood is found in california there is one they call in africa mosul bend and and cedars now the warmer country have higher timber becomes and the colder countries software becomes it have its spiritual application too cold and indifferent soft and fluted when it's warm it's spirit-filled it clings together becomes useful in the master's hand the material cut out in a native land brought into one place and when they were brought together they was perfectly fit in the space of 40 years it taken construction not one saw to be stoned to be restored these stones in different paths that were cut was so perfect they only had to assemble it oh hallelujah and many of those stones look very odd but there was a place in the temple for every odd peculiar stone god had a place for them so theowing may be very odd but god have a place for him in the capstone in the headstone in the temple and god is building a habitation with us together because one man can't make up the habitation of god or you're not hearing what i'm saying he is building a habitation for permanent dwelling oh give the lord some praises people oh hallelujah he's calling other people to make up the headstone to come into it [Applause] hallelujah oh i'm taking on the wrap-up listen to this watch when the temple the real temple we will come to a few minutes come together there will be a place for every odd acting person he moved from acting stone it's an odd acting person so you can write out all the different ones who have left hand who have right hand who tall who's short leave them alone you will make them and you cannot make them let god deal with him go heart pray for them encourage them god of all types jesus didn't call him as a group all you'll come come come everybody no peter come on andrew come this one come tax collector you come too you know the taxi like another loved man but jesus called a man straight off the tax collector and and he used to be president of the paid taxes you know and that is shake his hands go go god bless you but attack collector no no they might be enjoying shaking their hand but they had the holy ghost yet it's just men the vex the vex god called youtubers god called you here i didn't expect to see you here what are you doing here is it grace for you is it grace for me blood for you blood for me let's be brothers [Applause] let's get reconciled let's bury the hatchet let's cut the war let's stop it oh hallelujah let's be reconciled back to god let's get in the spirit of unity [Applause] watch we may look a little funny to someone else and act a little funny but remember it's a place there for us god is cutting out his church oh hallelujah notice the builders there was one stone there was actually two at the full hit so the builders rejected it and they pitched it over to the corner that stone is too out to be used there's no other place remember it's the builders who should have known the front we find out they built the building so high till they missed the stone they didn't know where that stone was the situation ships they might have run through every ox cart did you lose one on the road there's something wrong and they couldn't find it nowhere else and come to find out it was right on the ground it was the chief cornerstone that the builders rejected jesus spoke of it and said have you not read of the stone that the bible rejected was the chief cornerstone the head of all of it where is the rest of the building rested on and think the building today of the spiritual house that god worships in i think is a great big failure today among the builders we have come with our denominations we have laid them in sincerity we have sent our boys to school to educate them learn psychology by the history beautiful music and so forth of your built we find out there's something wrong we have built it out of man-made material what scholarship all these things will not work as long as we have not accepted the odd stone the peculiar stone and as the building began to materialize they realized that the hole that was left that odd stone fitted to the dirt and that is where the spiritual bill is today and that's why listen this is important that's why the bride building of christ is not ready for the bridegroom here's why is because the builders have rejected the chief cornerstone that was laid on the day of pentecost which is the baptism of the holy spirit it's been odd people act funny they don't fit in there they kicked it out it was too hard oh hallelujah brother branham said no we already have the stones the stones go for ordained we have got them all on the way from ephesus to laodicea we are only waiting for the headstone that the bill has rejected waiting for his coming and balaam said if that be so then the thunder's kept the pyramid so the seven thunders is the headstone that the penis refused but you have received it oh hallelujah praise god amen amen many many many men i'm going to skip down every single thing here oh glory to god
