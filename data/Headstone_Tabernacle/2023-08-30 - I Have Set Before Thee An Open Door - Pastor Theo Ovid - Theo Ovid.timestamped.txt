[54:54] headstone you know we there's no church
[54:56] positional this is not woman no church
[54:58] pensional this is you kept coming alive
[55:00] by Revelation you praising God by
[55:02] Revelation all glory Lord God hallelujah
[55:06] praise God praise God praise God glory
[55:09] to God hallelujah when the anointing
[55:12] begin to strike he said he won't have to
[55:14] ask the people to worship you would
[55:15] never ask them to praise God you
[55:17] wouldn't have to ask them to sing they
[55:19] can't wait for the doors to open they
[55:21] can't wait to color atmosphere they
[55:23] can't wait to hear the word go forward
[55:25] power
[55:27] my God
[55:30] Hallelujah
[55:32] Glory the court
[55:34] my God you may be seated
[55:36] with a Clarence but a client send me
[55:38] this one and I think this is goal Jesus
[55:41] being revealed to disciples the gardener
[55:43] Eden watches when Cain brought an
[55:45] offering In Worship the same as Abel did
[55:47] he worshiped
[55:48] he pays to the church he sacrificed he
[55:51] done every religious deed brighter
[55:54] better more fitted than later he had a
[55:56] better altar he made it prettier than
[55:58] water worship you see the strains still
[56:00] walk among the sons of Adam
[56:02] watch this
[56:04] there's a way that seemed right unto a
[56:08] man but what he did he worshiped true
[56:12] knowledge
[56:16] he worshiped not by revelation
[56:20] so you can worship and then he said this
[56:22] and it is possible he said get it now
[56:24] listen you can worship true knowledge
[56:27] you can go to church by knowledge
[56:30] which you should do it but going to
[56:32] church though that way is worshiping in
[56:34] vain
[56:36] you go to church because you don't want
[56:37] people thinking about science because
[56:38] you missed two Services he had to make
[56:39] up they had to come because your army if
[56:41] I say two three services they might take
[56:42] a bad side
[56:44] you have no revelation
[56:46] you are back sitting already
[56:48] because you can come here every service
[56:50] and bust it in your heart
[56:52] mission service doesn't mean
[56:56] I want to think about that now you have
[56:58] to be right in your heart
[57:01] [Music]
[57:03] so worshiping by knowledge is worshipers
[57:05] and vain that's why Jesus told a woman
[57:07] of the woman we know what we worship
[57:12] I know what you're about but I will know
[57:14] what we worship because salvation is of
[57:17] the Jews
[57:18] but then he went deeper and said woman
[57:19] the woman our common knowledge when
[57:21] neither Jerusalem not on this mountain
[57:23] We're Gonna Worship We're Gonna Worship
[57:25] the father in spirit and in truth
[57:30] thank you
[57:31] so what he did there he canceled every
[57:34] Jewish exclusive exclusion exclusivity
[57:40] he cancel all that so there's another
[57:42] Jewish thing we're talking about sister
[57:44] that there's a spirit and and one thing
[57:47] we're talking about
[57:48] so you cancel all that this is the
[57:50] mountain and Jerusalem and be elect
[57:52] people he cancel all of that and said
[57:54] y'all are common always
[57:56] and that was prophecy
[57:58] for us
[58:00] now we're getting to worshipers
[58:02] glory to God because we have the word
[58:04] and we have the spirit
[58:06] truth amen
[58:08] all right so let's go quickly now
[58:12] let's get it again you can worship
[58:14] through knowledge you can go to church
[58:16] by knowledge and you and you should do
[58:17] it but by going to church that way is
[58:20] worshiping in vain
[58:22] but when there is something happens done
[58:25] in your heart
[58:27] [Applause]
[58:28] [Music]
[58:30] when something happens down in your
[58:33] heart that makes you love God in such a
[58:37] way you can't steer from church that is
[58:40] the revelation
[58:41] that is God revealing
[58:43] because something striking tongue in
[58:46] your heart
[58:47] we are coming to church to see somebody
[58:49] here commentary because somebody coming
[58:51] to they're coming because they love God
[58:53] they love his people they love the
[58:55] atmosphere you love the word you love
[58:58] the cause
[59:03] all right
[59:05] visited
[59:08] how can you make a pig alarm
[59:11] Yuri speaks and Lamb's boat
[59:13] the pig get around eat all kind of stuff

[59:25] he could invite him over for dinner
[59:27] he wouldn't come
[59:28] because he's a pig
[59:30] you go tell him he's wrong he said bless
[59:32] God I'm a pig you on your own ground you
[59:36] go down there in the whole world if they
[59:37] want to there you are
[59:39] watch not because I quit eating money or
[59:43] make me different from a pig
[59:46] no isn't that it's when my nature is
[59:49] changed
[59:51] so you could they could dress up the pig

[59:59] suit is still a pig
[1:00:01] you can keep any hosting you know make
[1:00:04] him an executive house big but once he
[1:00:06] gets out oh my God modern manual
[1:00:11] because of his nature
[1:00:14] so the prophet said you put a fence
[1:00:16] around it back off you say watch he said
[1:00:18] it's not until it's changed but if you
[1:00:20] take the spirit out of that of a lamb
[1:00:22] and put it into a pig the pig will do
[1:00:26] the same thing the lamb Spirit of him
[1:00:27] will do
[1:00:30] so you don't have a problem it's a night

[1:02:44] and guide you
[1:02:54] Holy Ghost on Fire Holy Ghost on Fire
[1:03:02] let's go
[1:03:04] we don't believe that speaking with
[1:03:05] tongues makes you filled with the Holy
[1:03:07] Ghost no the morning we believe a ban
[1:03:10] living in a man will make you a pig
[1:03:12] servant
[1:03:18] hear what we believe now are you ready
[1:03:20] We Believe
[1:03:22] that you receive the Holy Ghost by an
[1:03:24] experience
[1:03:27] but I have shout this is not the bride
[1:03:29] that Jesus Christ around the world
[1:03:31] [Applause]
[1:03:33] this is for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:03:35] around the world not sitting on your

[1:04:18] behold I send you Elijah Elijah said
[1:04:21] that God said that oh give the Lord some
[1:04:24] Praises as many hath received him to
[1:04:27] them give him power to become the sons
[1:04:30] of God you don't have power power
[1:04:32] belongs to God and when God sends power
[1:04:35] God sends power
[1:04:41] foreign
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:51] we believe that you receive the Holy
[1:04:54] Ghost by an experience not by mythical
[1:04:58] intellectual conception of the
[1:05:00] scriptures but by an experience that you
[1:05:04] alone know and if you want to know
[1:05:06] whether it was the Holy Ghost watch how
[1:05:09] your life patterns after that it will
[1:05:11] tell the kind of spirit coming to you so
[1:05:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in this
[1:05:17] message is a personal experience
[1:05:20] after you receive the Holy Ghost since
[1:05:22] you believe this message you have to get
[1:05:24] a personal experience and when they get
[1:05:26] that person experience no devil no demon
[1:05:29] no child no testing no tribulation
[1:05:32] nothing present nothing to come could

[1:05:53] Prophet speaks he said I want you to
[1:05:55] come and listen a while
[1:05:57] because you want to take our time and
[1:05:58] lay the world so close that the devil
[1:06:00] won't even have one little speck of room
[1:06:01] to move
[1:06:03] hear these words now
[1:06:05] when you let your feet
[1:06:08] your feet
[1:06:09] runs out to his end
[1:06:12] till you begin to believe
[1:06:17] then let your subconscious go to acting
[1:06:22] then the faith of God will back it up
[1:06:27] because your faith won't do too much
[1:06:30] your subconscious has to move in the
[1:06:33] direction your faith is moving
[1:06:35] and then God said Moves In
[1:06:37] and confirms it all
[1:06:39] [Applause]

[1:06:57] not to make it you're nice to it
[1:07:05] Runs Out and your subconscious they need
[1:07:08] to line up without faith then God faith
[1:07:10] dropped behind that then they get the
[1:07:12] confirmation of indication because your
[1:07:15] faith Runs Out you believe in God the
[1:07:17] believing God for your children you
[1:07:18] believe in God for the Holy Ghost you
[1:07:19] believe in God for your family you

[1:08:14] wretched Sinners and save us we supposed
[1:08:16] to be the happiest people in the world
[1:08:18] and he has a lot of Christians that
[1:08:20] happy they're under heavy frustration
[1:08:22] and heavy issues why because self is in
[1:08:25] the way some of them untangle and
[1:08:27] ungrateful they don't know they say

[1:08:42] that too the I see that they want that
[1:08:43] to they're not satisfied and they come
[1:08:45] to church unsatisfied that's not how God
[1:08:47] wants you to be God wants you satisfied
[1:08:50] if you're freightful fretful fretful
[1:08:52] nurse at the breast of The Shadow

[1:09:15] some Praises I'm excited about the
[1:09:18] future I'm excited about what God have
[1:09:20] in store I'm excited about the Next
[1:09:22] Generation Oh Glory to did the devil run
[1:09:25] for his money I'm excited about the Sea
[1:09:28] of the righteous of the seated serpent
[1:09:30] seed and the devil people Conquering the
[1:09:33] world but God said the people that know
[1:09:35] their God shall be strong they're gonna
[1:09:38] be one more ride there will be one more
[1:09:40] witness of this super church superbride
[1:09:43] we'll give the Lord some praises
[1:09:45] Hallelujah
[1:09:49] praise God praise God
[1:09:52] somebody sleep but we just are not all
[1:09:54] sleep
[1:09:55] maybe seated praise God all right let's
[1:09:58] go
[1:10:00] God deals with individuals
[1:10:03] not with denomination
[1:10:05] God in no age ever dealt with domination
[1:10:08] he always dealt with individuals
[1:10:11] that's that's a tremendous thing and if
[1:10:13] you catch that by Revelation you'll be
[1:10:15] excited
[1:10:16] you know one time I was reading and the
[1:10:19] prophet said you one is the majority in
[1:10:21] God and I dropped under my teeth my
[1:10:23] knees I said God I'm a majority oh give
[1:10:25] the Lord I praise offering Oh Glory to
[1:10:28] God I felt so good doing that he said
[1:10:30] one is a majority in God and I say God
[1:10:33] I'm a majority when you understand by
[1:10:35] Revelation that God deals with
[1:10:38] individuals that means no man could stop
[1:10:40] God from dealing with you you are
[1:10:43] individual you not talking about the
[1:10:45] group and the church and the people that
[1:10:47] I'm Gonna Do With It
[1:10:49] Give the Lord some Praises God they call
[1:10:51] your family God call you oh give the
[1:10:54] Lord I shall God have to call each
[1:10:55] individual in your family
[1:10:58] or give the Lord some praises
[1:11:00] hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:11:03] my god let's continue now you cannot
[1:11:07] make a holy church
[1:11:09] there is no such a thing as a holy
[1:11:11] church
[1:11:11] or a holy organization so when you see
[1:11:14] Pastor man or Bishop man or who they
[1:11:16] think they are say that you have to come
[1:11:18] here to be the Rapture you know they are
[1:11:19] liars
[1:11:22] you have to be in Christ to go in the

[1:15:26] Holy Spirit but not in the measure that
[1:15:28] they have it now because it's a
[1:15:30] restoration of the face
[1:15:32] now lots of time many of us Pentecostals
[1:15:35] made a mistake and think well the Holy
[1:15:37] Ghost poured on me glory to God that's
[1:15:39] all I've got to have no sir you're just

[1:15:45] is that that's about you
[1:15:46] that's power that you can add the rest
[1:15:49] getting started he said now watch then
[1:15:52] it's your test and your trial
[1:15:55] so when you get the Holy Ghost you know
[1:15:56] get an opportunity to go into your place
[1:15:59] of trying
[1:16:00] we find out the Old Testament testing
[1:16:02] trying then placing a sun adoption place
[1:16:06] in the sun he was already a son he was
[1:16:08] born into the family but he would be
[1:16:10] tested and tried raised by tutors to see
[1:16:14] how he comes out
[1:16:16] Oh Glory to God I'm not praise God
[1:16:18] hallelujah I am not the tester
[1:16:21] so her again fight with me
[1:16:25] wrong battle
[1:16:28] praise God so this is the prophet now we
[1:16:30] have we had about 40 Years of testing of
[1:16:32] Pentecostals see testing Church seeing
[1:16:36] whether they're going to stand or not
[1:16:39] when your family come wrong and your
[1:16:41] loved ones come down to see if it was a
[1:16:43] Christian
[1:16:44] your cousin
[1:16:49] so it could cost like them smoke like
[1:16:50] them drink like them clean glass with
[1:16:51] them because hey family you know
[1:16:53] family no family
[1:16:55] you have a Christian you have a stand
[1:16:57] watch testing the church scene where
[1:16:59] they're going to stand or not seeing
[1:17:01] that you see there is way I get it again
[1:17:04] instead of holding on to the Cross onto
[1:17:06] the wood and moving on becoming become
[1:17:08] fashion after the world all right so
[1:17:10] let's go
[1:17:11] going good did you notice Rebecca when
[1:17:14] ili is a Founder it was an evening time
[1:17:16] she watered the camel called Elizabeth
[1:17:18] said all right wow Elizabeth said if the
[1:17:21] dancer that comes to what is the camel
[1:17:23] give me drink and will be one that you
[1:17:25] have chosen Lord to be the Bride of your
[1:17:27] silver Isaac and while he was yet in
[1:17:28] prayer Rebecca come draw water and give
[1:17:32] him drink water they come here notice
[1:17:34] the camera was a beast
[1:17:35] and that Beast that she was watering was
[1:17:38] the one who packed to her bride Isaac
[1:17:43] and today
[1:17:45] the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:48] that the church is watering
[1:17:50] and worshiping
[1:17:52] is the thing that will pack it from the
[1:17:55] Earth
[1:17:56] to meet the bridegroom
[1:17:58] [Applause]
[1:18:03] Isaac come out to his father's house was
[1:18:05] out in the field when he saw Rebecca
[1:18:06] coming on the camel she loved him at
[1:18:08] First Sight jump off the camera around
[1:18:09] to meet him and so forth that's where we
[1:18:11] meet the Lord and the Very comment that
[1:18:13] she watered
[1:18:16] packed her to her husband
[1:18:20] very power
[1:18:22] that the church is worshiping
[1:18:24] you heard the message Sunday right
[1:18:26] the very power
[1:18:28] that the church is worshiping
[1:18:30] that the world called fanaticism that
[1:18:33] the church is worshiping will be the
[1:18:35] same power that will take the church up
[1:18:36] in the air to meet the Lord in the air
[1:18:39] the Holy Spirit
[1:18:41] so you can understand Claire you know
[1:18:43] suddenly message worships come
[1:18:47] precedes the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:49] so you yourself have to get a revelation
[1:18:51] to worship
[1:18:53] [Applause]
[1:18:54] because that's not normal
[1:18:56] people not thought that before they sit
[1:18:58] down here and listen
[1:19:00] but they don't know about prison
[1:19:02] and worshiping
[1:19:03] but you know what may God God
[1:19:05] you know what happened before he was God
[1:19:08] that's a big word before he was gone
[1:19:10] before he was God he was Elohim nothing
[1:19:12] worship Him he was self-existent so he
[1:19:16] created the angels and when the angel
[1:19:18] began to worship him then he became God
[1:19:20] because God is the object of worship
[1:19:23] so when there was no worship we are
[1:19:25] admitting as God
[1:19:26] Oh Glory to God so worshiping shows who
[1:19:29] God is to you
[1:19:31] it is your god
[1:19:33] Hallelujah that's why you worship
[1:19:35] that's why she said we know what we
[1:19:37] worship we know who we worship we know
[1:19:39] why we worship do you know why we
[1:19:41] worship him praise God people think

[1:32:49] with three Kim for just the same because
[1:32:51] he watered it with fate oh praise God
[1:32:53] okay so we're gonna wrap up
[1:32:56] Revelation 3 17. unto the angel of
[1:33:00] Church of Philadelphia write these
[1:33:01] things said he that is Holy either is
[1:33:03] true he has the Key of David he opened
[1:33:05] it to no man shut it shut it no man open
[1:33:07] it I know that works behold I've set
[1:33:09] before thee and open door and no man can
[1:33:11] shut it for that was a little strength
[1:33:13] kept my word has not denied my name
[1:33:16] little strength kept my word
[1:33:18] not deny my name
[1:33:20] little strength kept my word
[1:33:22] look at the name the prophet said
[1:33:24] between the Western age and now recent
[1:33:26] age
[1:33:28] Wesley
[1:33:29] which is Philadelphia
[1:33:31] Elijah
[1:33:33] he opened the door that no man can shut
[1:33:37] adore
[1:33:42] so after some vacation he put a door
[1:33:45] there
[1:33:46] and afterwards what the kidney nominated
[1:33:48] isn't that right after Luther died the
[1:33:50] nomination what not he put an open door
[1:33:51] and that open door he identify as the
[1:33:53] Holy Spirit
[1:33:55] 1906 I believe the 1909 they had the
[1:33:59] great Revival on Azusa Street
[1:34:01] the open door was dear and the baptism
[1:34:03] of the Holy Ghost was given out dear
[1:34:05] isn't that right and of course he never
[1:34:07] could do nothing about it and when
[1:34:09] people started to speak in tongues and
[1:34:10] carry on the people who run them and as
[1:34:12] they run them everywhere they run them
[1:34:14] the fire break out
[1:34:15] God was using the devil to run them to
[1:34:17] spread it and the more they run them and
[1:34:20] run them out and they hate them is they
[1:34:22] modify your spread and that's how God
[1:34:24] started this Holy Ghost Revival under
[1:34:26] the Pentecostals by the devil getting so
[1:34:29] mad at this fire he was just like
[1:34:30] blowing the fire and making the fire get
[1:34:32] bigger
[1:34:33] isn't that right and then God brought
[1:34:36] the prophet up born to 1909 praise God
[1:34:39] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:34:42] Lord all that under the open door
[1:34:47] is where God put the new name
[1:34:50] is where adoption where them Thunders
[1:34:53] manifesting a new name to speak the word
[1:34:55] in this open door this Open Door closing
[1:34:57] you know not yet praise God God set it I
[1:35:01] sat before an Open Door isn't that right
[1:35:03] hallelujah praise God under that open no
[1:35:06] anointing he spoke squirrels glory to
[1:35:09] God he spoke this he spoke that he spoke
[1:35:10] that because the door is open to the
[1:35:12] spirit that no man can touch it no man
[1:35:14] can hurt the oil and the wine God set
[1:35:17] her open door and I want to tell this
[1:35:19] message well that door is still open oh
[1:35:21] give the Lord a praise Hallelujah the
[1:35:23] Holy Ghost door is still open no man
[1:35:26] could shut it when God opened it okay
[1:35:28] the Lord as praise
[1:35:30] hallelujah praise God hallelujah
[1:35:34] the prophet and what is the Holy Ghost
[1:35:36] he said no watch not by one handshake
[1:35:38] but by one Spirit Holy Spirit we are
[1:35:41] baptized into one body whether Jews or
[1:35:44] Gentiles where are we born or free We
[1:35:46] Are All Made to drink of one Spirit the
[1:35:49] body of Christ is one Spirit where every

[1:38:27] Spirit but you are Sanctified they were
[1:38:29] all Sanctified every one of them

[1:38:41] wisdom of Revelation to cut the cat what
[1:38:44] the door

[1:38:48] the key right there to the message
[1:38:49] to be filled with the spirit Oh Glory to
[1:38:53] God when the Holy Ghost fell in Russia
[1:38:55] and the Holy Ghost fell of all the other
[1:38:56] places there was no Doctrine to it there
[1:38:59] was no teaching to it the spirit was
[1:39:00] falling the spirit was moving there was
[1:39:03] no word under it it was the open door
[1:39:06] Spirit moving freely in Wales Russia
[1:39:09] Armenia all over the world the spirit of
[1:39:12] God was moving because God bringing an
[1:39:14] atmosphere because he know the prophet
[1:39:16] must come with the seed and it have to
[1:39:18] have the atmosphere so he released the
[1:39:21] open door to bring the spirit atmosphere
[1:39:23] that the settlement could come the sore
[1:39:25] of the good seed or give the Lord a
[1:39:28] shout but the Pentecostal turned it on
[1:39:31] and it crashed them into laodicea and
[1:39:34] God blessed my bright age to call you
[1:39:38] or can the Lord I shout because the
[1:39:41] Pentecostal was the shock but you are

[1:39:50] glory to God so after the open door
[1:39:53] Pentecostal God put the open door
[1:39:55] writing Tabernacle there praise God a
[1:39:58] prophet belching out the word of God
[1:39:59] word after word after word and that is
[1:40:02] why we are live tonight because of that
[1:40:04] open door that God put there in
[1:40:07] Jacksonville with a 20th century Prophet
[1:40:10] preached until 1965 and looked at us

[1:40:37] worry
[1:40:39] the god
[1:40:41] I'm almost finished let me see it
[1:40:44] now watch in this scripture he's
[1:40:47] revealing part of it here he said that
[1:40:49] um what he said the church is going to
[1:40:51] come and you have to get in the
[1:40:53] organization because those keep the word
[1:40:55] of my patience I will keep you from the
[1:40:57] hour of Temptation and is identifying
[1:41:00] the all of temptation as the tribulation
[1:41:02] and that tribulation was not in that age
[1:41:05] so all that was prophetic so he
[1:41:07] experienced here now this great
[1:41:09] temptation of or the hour of Temptation
[1:41:12] that shall try the whole world goes into
[1:41:16] the tribulation
[1:41:17] just in a few minutes we will see it it
[1:41:20] goes on into the tribulation and the
[1:41:22] tribulation did not come in the days of
[1:41:24] Wesley so what age are we in
[1:41:27] what is this door set before us oh
[1:41:31] praise the name of the Lord It's been
[1:41:33] Wesley where the church is heading right
[1:41:35] now and laodicea oh praise God isn't
[1:41:38] that right hallelujah hallelujah watch
[1:41:40] setting right before the people to come
[1:41:42] in and God will take the remnant and
[1:41:44] seal it off and they will go on into
[1:41:46] lukewarm and be split out of his mouth
[1:41:48] now here there's a pairing the sleeping
[1:41:50] Vision also proves that this last Church
[1:41:53] age moves on to the first part of
[1:41:54] Pentecost and then they go into the
[1:41:56] Great Tribulation oh praise God and
[1:41:59] there's only one way to go into the body
[1:42:00] of Christ there's only one daughter the
[1:42:02] Church of the Living God and Jesus is
[1:42:04] that door isn't that right he said I've
[1:42:06] set before the unopened door he said
[1:42:08] that to the Methodist Church age they
[1:42:10] turn away from it it went through an
[1:42:12] organization but I've set before an open
[1:42:14] door now after they receive
[1:42:16] sanctification he said I will put the
[1:42:19] open door which is the Holy Spirit
[1:42:22] and by one Spirit we are all baptized
[1:42:25] into one body which is Christ so he set
[1:42:29] that message before the Methodist Church
[1:42:31] the students aside they come this on
[1:42:34] vacation but refuse the Holy Ghost
[1:42:36] remember that is the open door how do
[1:42:39] you get into Christ by one Spirit not by
[1:42:41] sprinkling not by handshake but by one
[1:42:44] Holy Ghost baptism we are all baptized
[1:42:47] into one body and make practices of that
[1:42:49] body one Holy Ghost baptism into that
[1:42:52] door
[1:42:53] it is one Holy Ghost baptism into that
[1:42:56] door oh God that door is set before you
[1:42:59] tonight oh glory to God wherever this
[1:43:02] message is preached wherever it is
[1:43:04] William random messages they have an
[1:43:06] open door an opportunity for the people
[1:43:08] to receive Christ the Holy Ghost Oh
[1:43:11] Glory to God hallelujah praise God thank
[1:43:15] you Jesus Oh Glory almost done
[1:43:18] let's go
[1:43:22] how do we get into Christ by one Holy
[1:43:24] Spirit
[1:43:25] he had a question
[1:43:27] all right
[1:43:34] he's talking about uh the wedding the
[1:43:36] Parable with the man who came in with
[1:43:37] all the government listen the bridegroom
[1:43:39] stands at the door or comes up with an
[1:43:41] invitation right and the old time Holy
[1:43:43] Ghost religion makes all look alike
[1:43:45] whether the rich or poor Bond of free
[1:43:46] black white male female one in Christ
[1:43:48] Jesus the bridegroom stood at the door
[1:43:50] received the invitation now what do you
[1:43:52] think
[1:43:53] when the bridegroom come back
[1:43:55] from The Man Without The Wedding garment
[1:43:58] said friend how do you get in here he's
[1:44:01] so speechless he showed he come in some
[1:44:03] other way besides the door he come in a
[1:44:05] window he come in the back door he come
[1:44:06] he call a friend with a church member
[1:44:08] friend how did you come in here without
[1:44:09] the Garment
[1:44:10] now Jesus himself called the portal and
[1:44:12] said
[1:44:13] casting out of Darkness where there'll
[1:44:15] be weeping with the national teeth
[1:44:16] that's Christ's one word because it
[1:44:19] proved without the wedding garment he
[1:44:23] coming some other way besides the door
[1:44:25] it's not right because if you come to
[1:44:27] the door he would have received the
[1:44:28] wedding garment
[1:44:31] listen to this
[1:44:32] then if the wedding garment
[1:44:37] is the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:44:40] how are we going to be represented any
[1:44:42] other way
[1:44:43] if the first church age had to come by
[1:44:45] the door Christ Jesus be baptized into
[1:44:49] the name of Jesus Christ receive the
[1:44:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost to put on the
[1:44:53] wedding garment how are we coming any
[1:44:56] other way
[1:44:57] if you come by Methodist by Baptist by
[1:45:00] Pentecostal by other denomination you
[1:45:02] will be born and cast in the of the
[1:45:03] darkness
[1:45:04] you've got to come by Christ's way
[1:45:07] Hallelujah just as sure as God kept his
[1:45:10] word to Peter James and John just assure
[1:45:12] he kept it to John the Beloved the
[1:45:14] Revelator just assure he kept the
[1:45:16] promises through the judges just as sure
[1:45:18] he promised in this last days he would
[1:45:20] send them the latter rain and would
[1:45:22] bring back the same spirit that was upon
[1:45:25] the Earth in him
[1:45:26] or give the Lord a shout to just assure
[1:45:29] Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God
[1:45:32] music please Hallelujah
