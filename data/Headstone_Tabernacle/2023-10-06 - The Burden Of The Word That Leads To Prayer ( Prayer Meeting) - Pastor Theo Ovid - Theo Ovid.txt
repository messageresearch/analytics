season father in their rough tough time at this point in time you visit them with healing and strength may all be well and may it give s Kang a touch in the crown of her head to the S of her feet any person here oh God not feeling well may you visit them in a special way in Jesus name I ask it amen I have one scripture to read tonight Matthew chapter 11 reading for from 28 to 30 Jesus speaks come unto me all ye that labor and a heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and he shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light maybe tonight it might be burden out burden with family issues stress something troubling you and you're heavy but Jesus said take my y upon you there are two kind of burdens burdens of God and the burden of the devil the burden of the devil is is a hard one because go the end after serving him his whims and fancies and will dead the devil the wages of sin is still dead but the Yoke of Jesus you still find yourself with eternal life other title of this exhortation I want to give you tonight is the burden of the word that leads to prayer that's what I want to share with you tonight the burden of the word that leads to prayer okay let's go there a question somebody asked brother brandom it seems among the Ministers of the word that we have little or no burden to pray to preach to fast or for lost souls that might still be out there somewhere in the world would you please tell us what to do about this condition thank you very much brother Brandon for this and he answers that must be a minister he didn't sign any name for these word brother I I had to answer them when I was tired and worn out and kind of you know don't feel too good so I trust that it answer the question I thank you very much and I forgot what I was going to answer him then he continues preachers a minister why we have these burdens don't have a burden for lost souls I believe it's a lacking of the Revival I believe we should still try to pray to God to give us passions for lost souls until Jesus comes so even though it might be dry and hard which it still continue to pray pray God for Revival pray God to give a passion for lost souls pray God to go beyond you let's continue Revelation 2:9 I Know Thy works and thy tribulations and poverty but Thou Art rich I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of SATA now the Lord God Almighty says I know there is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them and how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watch his people suffer so I was amazed tonight how brother Anthony sing that song uh yes Jesus loves me the Bible tells me so because I knew what I had here I'm speaking about speaking about um love I went to the bank today have some transaction to pay on my credit card and some kind of things like that and I had to get some money from elsewhere and put it together and I got mixed up somehow and I didn't realize I got mixed up and I I do what I normally do to pay on the credit card and stuff and the g was take staying quite long and I didn't know why and I started to get irritated and I'm twisting and turning and like that something we have the right attitude and I adjust and take take it easy and so like that and after a while I recognized I give them the wrong amount so they had more money than they could account for and it was an amazing experience to me because here it is I've never seen that girl before maybe she's a new person so I tell myself she is new she we don't know what she's doing and all kind of thoughts hit in my mind but I realiz it doesn't matter what the circumstances and what the challenges is it's p right attitude at the end of it all I was wrong not the girl it cost it it was it take up 25 minutes when it was supposed to take about five six minutes and it's after a while when I get settled now I say wait a minute what I give you is not what I thought I give you and we work at all out but I I just shared it with you so sometimes in going forward when you think might be somebody else it might just be you so I thank God for that lesson tonight of being patient and being understanding and just waiting and just watching even though so even if she was new and fumbling just like a new driver on the road I was still supposed to have a level of patience and understanding and it so happened that I was at fault that was very interesting experience so I'll share with you tonight so let's continue the burden this and this is a scripture now from Malachi chapter 1 the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you sayth the Lord yet be saved wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother and the Lord said yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountain and Heritage waste for the dragons of the Wilderness here we go tonight this is for us here tonight you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering Believers especially you here tonight who feel that you entitled I don't know what you think you might be entitled to or anybody that will hear this thing think you might be entitled to this entitled to that entitled to that but let's hear closer what the Lord is saying here they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election and no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen on the Salvation because God had chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as it did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative how many could say Amen tonight and you see when you could say Amen to this that's been presented it means you are getting mature because you see the younger and the baby and whatnot and the child wouldn't be able to grasp this just here so because you're growing you could actually acquire a higher knowledge to understand your placement and your issue that you wouldn't backslide in spirit or in mind because it's not working according to your thoughts and thinking so what he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then here we go he would be the author of frustration and not peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect so when people complaining and blaming and pointing finger and all kind of thing like that they don't want to sit back relax and ask God what is your mind in this situation I want to catch your mind I don't want to get caught up in my flesh because the flesh is not Guided by the spirit okay is as many as a led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God if you yield to your senses and your flesh and your own desires you wouldn't get very far because you're a human okay but you're looking to be Quicken from above so let's go if he didn't have a purpose then he would be the auor of frustration and not peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as job says he put strength in US you see he himself suffered from Christ he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he actually made perfect by the things that he suffered and we have Hebrews 58 to9 quoted here though he was a son yet learn obedience by the things which he suffered what about that long-standing church M who fig that it's supposed to work up because they there a long time the Bible says though he was a son in other words son doesn't give him the right to be excused son doesn't give him the right to be entitled The Bible specifically detailed though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the auter of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him in plain language here we go the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church his church upon his TR I my church he left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why did he want this pause a bit so in other words you could have a fivestory house you could have 10 cars 10 ships 10 planes 10 Rockets you could be a multi-billionaire it doesn't exclude you from this word here watch so Paul said he has left his church a measure of suffering a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God one suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why did he want this and the answer that is James 1 2- 4 my brethren con your joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the try of your faith work at patience and let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing and we find out he said patience Perfection waiting on God and waiting for God let's continue quickly why does he stand by the reason is in Romans 8:1 1718 if children and we stru that last night on Wednesday night then ears ears of God joint ears with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be reveal in us on unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and he set down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him how could we overcome if there's no test given and the little here we go temporary sufferings we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes what a treasure lad up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom too much tribulation okay now in trying to do God service without being is God's will he's talking about David got caught up in the anointing the anointing was all right but in doing it he got in Ted and stepped over the boundary line what did he do instead of putting the Arc in it original position he carried it on a new cart and not over the hearts of the Levites it was supposed to be carried on the shoulder of of Levites which is over the heart the word is not in the mind it's in the heart not in a new cat and the new C represented every denomination there will ever be God word must be obeyed God words must be carried not carried by state persp or Bishops here we go it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the heart of man and not some ecclesiastical move the holy spirit is a treasure of God's love in the heart of man and woman Obe now what we are saying the anointing not supposed to shake you off the word you have to Zone into the word and leave everything out the anointing the true anointing has to make will make you focus on the word not on your own thoughts and feelings and emotions and your ideas and your dreams now hear this part they were supposed to put it on their left shoulder pack the ark and because it was up over their heart they had the burden of the word on their heart so when you get caught up in the word you get the burden of the word or the burden of what is promised and we can see tonight why some people doesn't have any burden how some people get a burden and they operate from that burden and they feel a fulfillment of their lies in praying and seeking God because upon them there's a burden so hear what he's saying here now this is so big he says people have different bird burden of their own denomination and like that he said the burden of how many more you're going to get in your denomination instead of here we go the burden of the word of the Lord till people will see only the word and nothing else if you're seeing brother ID you're Missy Bo if you're seeing the church you're Missy Bo you have to see the word and you have to see the word given to us in time and even though God is in eternity his word must be obeyed in time just as Jesus prayed thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven God cannot change anything of his word his word is original his word is perfect and his word must be obeyed so instead of the burden of the word of God till the people will see only the word of God and nothing else no new C all right so this is the stretch now we're going to hit and this is something something so beautiful and I want to get it from the teaching on Moses but R was teaching I think it was a Sunday school class young children but it have something very very important that we want to look at in prayer and he's talking about amam Joi dead and he said oh gosh you're putting all woman to work is getting worse and worse and that night he said I'm going up and pray like I never prayed before I'm and B I'm saying that's the way to pray pray like you never prayed before really get to business all right don't go and say Lord bless so and so and and don't take interest no when you little boys pray get down to business and he said do you do that in school God to help you in your school and your grades and so on do you pray and he ask that but here one again so amam he goes upstairs he didn't want no supper she said you must eat that she said I can't do it you see dead I can't do it she said you're losing weight you're nervous you're pale in your face you vomit up your food and things he said I know what to do he said dear if somebody don't take the people to heart if somebody don't pray for the people what will we do we we getting worse surely sometime God will hear and he say God will hear when you get on to business just stay there this time so he accustom going upstairs and praying and whatnot listen to these words this time he goes upstairs different and when he goes upstairs his time he kneels down he puts his hands in the air and holler that means he talking loud to God God I am speaking to you now God thou has ears and you can hear you have eyes and you can see you have a memory I love how it is phrased here and this could teach us a Channel of praying tonight you know your word you know your promise so you can't approach God if you know nothing about God nothing about what his promised so the word the true connection with the word brings a burden and that burden could get you in the right channel in prayer so this is how he's praying you have ears you have you can hear you have eyes you can see you have memory you know your word you know your promise I plead to you God look down here the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob that your people are in distress and they are dying do something for us God so you can apply to your family to your wife to your children to your home we have got to have you at once we have just got to have you or we will perish we must have you we just got to if we live and that's when you really pray and he prayed you know sometimes people when they pray they get tired don't they he said brother bam sometime get so tired I almost faint when I go to praying a long time just faint I go without eating and things for days and pray and pray and pray and preach I just get to a place I'm going to faint there sometimes people get that way there's no time to give up so he's dramatizing continue now so he goes up to the old cricky steps so there's a place where he go and pray I see Yoshi come by and says honey he says you she you are fine lovely she was beautiful pretty little mother he kept going and patched her like that he mother you go back put Aon and little Miriam to bed I'm going up to pray and now if you hear me weeping don't you come well but amram what are you going to do honey you you're about dead he said yes but I got the burden of the people on my heart I got to do something about it I got to St on my knees so he said today only today down in the brick Hill I was down there I kept saying well Children of Children God will hear and one big old man come up and put his hand on his hips and said when will he hear when will he hear you see people are getting bitter they are getting against God because they pray and pray and pray and nothing happens and this one prays and praise and prays and nothing happen and all the priests say the days of Miracle pass only thing we can do is just just get right down to the old task Masters worship Heen but I believe this is said in Jehovah I believe he still answers prayer so his little old frail body now now lost a lot of weight up the creeky steps he goes and he kns down and say oh Jehovah and he prayed like he never prayed before he said Jehovah look here you are real God we believe that you got ears we believe you have got eyes you know all things we believe you're the god of the Hebrews and we are the people of promise we believe you keep your word look at these heathens out here they are taking our cheap labor building great big RADS and Idols everything else you Jehovah would you set in heaven and let the Heathen rule over you and he said you said what we need today somebody like amram got the burden on their heart who will stay there and pray it through until Heaven is split open under and God come and answer now listen to this now he said God do you let the heathens mock at your people like this weeks and months and and years have passed we pray constantly the tears bath he said Lord will you permit such a thing I wonder today when hundreds of little babies are thrown into the rivers a cesspool and abortion he's talking about that let just he said Jehovah will you permit such nonsense to go on he will answer one day his WRA is Terror when it's come now we go a little further we find him almost done we find him praying he just gets so tired he lays down he just prays he just falls on the floor he can't go any further and he look take a little nap he woke up what's the matter he look around where that light was coming from standing in the corner there stood an angel his sword hanging there on his side and he rubbed his eyes he pulled up his knee he said Lord what would you want from me he said amram I am the angel of God I have been sent from heaven to tell you God heard your prayers I've come to tell you that he's going to send a deliverer he remembers all of his promises I see the angel now look at him he's pulling out his sword he pointed to the north and RAM looks he said just the point of this sword lays the promised land and I promis Abraham Isaac and Jacob your fathers that you people would inherit the land of heard the groaning of the people I've heard the crying of the children I've come down I want you to know that you are going to play a great part in this listen to this part my God amam because you were faithful in prayer you were faithful in your house and about this time next year jied your lovely little wife is going to embrace a little baby boy and that little baby boy is going to be a deliverer and say Glory oh my God pause Reon just reading that That's so exciting oh blessed be the name of the Lord I'm going to close but brand Pharaoh was training Moses Pharaoh had 40 years to train him then God took 40 years to train him let him forget all about it man's training and God's training Pharaoh was training a son to be a leader a diplomat a warrior a fighter for another coming Pharaoh now watch this here but God took him Moses on the backside of the desert and took all that out of him and showed him in five minutes time by the burning bush that he was the Living God it took all Fe out of him and got him ready and I close with these words here and it's words that you know God wants his people to pray and when Israel got so taxed in such a condition that they could not go any further their time was fulfilled and their burdens was laid further than what they taught then they begin to pray when the people begin to pray then God begin to hear it was time for that word to be fill so when Amon and Yoshi saw it was time for the word to be fulfilled this is the what did they see they were seeing it was time for the word to be fulfilled what do you see tonight when I say fulfilled you have to begin to see time for the word to fulfill in your life I believe it was Wednesday night we were saying you cannot claim what is not yours and this message come to reveal to you what is yours what is your property what God has given to you or released to you died and PID the price for you so you don't want to walk in ignorance that you don't know and you don't know what inheritance is about no that's why you come to church for that's why you here tonight let's wrap up here here is when am and Yoshi saw that it was time for the word to be fulfilled they went to pray to God and it is usually those who pray is the one who's got the burden the one who gets something it is those who pray that's ordained of God to do so let us bow our heads father God I thank you tonight for these words that I was given to share with your people tonight and may bring a burden the burden of the word may open up a channel a Channel of prayer may it open up an understanding an understanding of their own personal calling by Your Love by your election knowing that they have been elected and chosen for this hour they could thank you in advance for what you're about to do in and through them because you said by and through the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised bless your sons and daughters here tonight give them a Special Touch may they have a supernatural experience in their own homes in their hearts and lives in Jesus name I ask it praise the Lord thank you so much for being here I'm looking forward to see what the Lord will do praise the Lord so God bless you as we get down in prayer tonight praise the

goodness we thank him for his grace we thank him for his loving kindness father we praise you we bless you we worship you we honor you we thank you for your word we thank you for making yourself known you're the god of the audience you're God of your people oh Father may you come down here Lord and bless them in Jesus name I ask it father God as we praise you and worship you and thank you for Lord Lord here in our prayer and hear in our cry tonight have you in way I pray in Jesus name I ask it praise God Amen God bless you Saints I trust you inspired and charged tonight to call upon the name of the Lord and to see that his love for you his elective love and to see he didn't call you to wrath or call you to for punishment he called you that you may be changed and be transformed one of the things in we Our Father prayer before it was said give us this day bread said thy will be done thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven just remember this tiing with seek first the kingdom of God before anything else don't look at flesh and blood look at the promise look at what God Said and then in looking at what God said he who place you on the earth he's the only one have the ability to reveal your place and position reveal what you're called to do and in your situation you would see like like that like um Jonah whale Belly Up wh belly down you look left right it's just like no go it's just like negative but because J Jonah was called for this purpose it had to work out that way to accomplish God purpose and we as humans may not understand the tribulations the testings the trials the challenges that we have but at the end of it all is for our own purification is our own character formation it is how this word image is going to be formed this word image that we talking about this fi and virtue is to be formed it's not just that you have it it has to be formed has to be shaped the pyramid is not a slum it's not a slab it's a shaped thing it's broad at the bottom it get smaller at the top as it get as it get higher at the top now it's it's sharper it's it's steep you could slide off and whatnot you have to keep climbing you see so the challenge is Daily Bread your daily prayer daily Faith daily holding on knowing that the God we serve he answers he answers his in his own timing you know like I heard a man say he asked God for wisdom and God give him all kind of issues that he could exercise that wisdom he ask God for patience and God games challenges you know God answer his prayer not what you expect but how it will unfold out that you could get the discernment you could get the understanding you get the patience so let's close off with a prayer at this time father God I thank you for your presence and your love and the people that gathered here tonight in faith believe in you that you would hear them and I pray you hear every prayer that was prayed visit them Lord and confir it with to their hearts and lives bless the upcoming Sunday service May anoint brother Y in a special way and use him mightily for your kingdom for your honor and your glory and bless the upcoming meetings in India father God as I be attending to may

Lord we commit Our Lives into your hands and our future into your hands bless your people Lord as they oh god whatever they have to do may your presence be with them in a special way to know that you're not dead but you're alive to confirm and to vindicate your word remember all the sick among us remember the ministry the elders the deacons the ushers Lord remember all the sick Lord the weary the tired the calebs all who are challenged oh God may you anoint them and Inspire them give them great comfort knowing that they in your will by Your Word and your love to them is elective granted
