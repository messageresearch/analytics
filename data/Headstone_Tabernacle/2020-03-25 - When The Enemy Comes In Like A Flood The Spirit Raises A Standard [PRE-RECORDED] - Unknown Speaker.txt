of the baptism of the Holy Ghost granted Lord in Jesus name we ask it amen God bless you thanks for coming if you have your Bibles i' like you to turn to three portion of scripture Isaiah 59 1 verse verse 19 Acts chapter 4 we want to read read verse 23-31 and Ephesians 6 10-18 we want to look at Isaiah chapter 59: 19 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and reading from Acts chap 4: 23 and being let go this is after the Believers the the fathers were beaten Peter and all of them and being leted go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which ha made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all that is that them is who by the mouth of thy servant David has said why did the hidden rage and the people imagine a vain thing the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord against his Christ for of a truth against thy holy Child Jesus whom thou has anointed both Herod and Pontius pilot with the Gentiles and the people of Israel will gather together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy councel determined before to be done and now Lord behold their threatenings Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak Thy Word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus amen and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness our last scripture is from Ephesians chapter 6 reading from verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord in the power of His might and put on the whole armor of God that you may able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we Ras not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins good about with truth having on which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints may God bless his word you may be seated oh praise God it's always a blessing to be in the house of God and to be in his presence where you can enjoy the Lord and enjoy and receive his word and get manner from heaven so we're looking for that fresh manner tonight that would feed our souls you love him amen oh praise the name of the Lord so Acts chapter 4 the amplifi said and they were permitted to go the apostles returned to their own company and told all what the chief priests and Elders had said to them and when they heard it they lifted up their voices together with one United mind to God said oh Sovereign Lord you are he who made the Heaven and Earth and the Sea and everything that is in them who by the mouth of for fathers David your servant and child said through the Holy Spirit why did the Heathen rage the Gentiles become want and insolent why did they rage and the people imagine and study a plan vain fruitless thing that will not succeed the king of the earth took their standing array for attack and the rulers were assembled and combined together against the Lord against his anointed Christ the Messiah for in this city they actually met and plotted together against your holy child and servant Jesus whom you consecrated by anointing both Herod and Pontius pilot with the Gentiles and the people of Israel to carry out all that your hand and your will and purpose had predestined predetermined should occur now Lord observe their threats and Grant to your bond servants full freedom to declare your message fearlessly while you stretch out your hand to cure and to perform signs and wonders through the authority and by the power of the name of your holy child and servant Jesus and when they had prayed the place in which they were assembled was shaken and they were filled with the Holy Spirit and they continue to speak the word of God with freedom and boldness and courage isn't that tremendous tonight that God could release such a power and this what we read tonight is our promise not just the acts two part but the acts four part the acts two was the filling but this year this is the refilling okay let's continue okay so tonight of a title when the enemy comeing like a flood the spirit raises a standard oh pray that's the word God can lie once any anytime the enemy come like a flood watch the spirit raise a standard amen so let's go the church has come through these schools she's married back y a long time ago and become a denomination but you notice the birth produced something else and now it's got to a place to where the Pentecostal church with the New Birth has been tested and tried now God here we go doesn't deal with the church as an organization God deals with the church as individuals each individual in the church so we can't put the church as this is something and this is it or whatever it is that's foolishness because God doesn't deal with church as a group he he deal with you as an individual he deals with Israel as a nation but you is an individual that me when you come to church tonight you're going to hear direct from God you you have to come to God to speak to you nobody else God talking to you what you have to do what you have to apply are you with me you deal with churches as individual each individual in the church now it's no secret we see it when a man proves and God loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself there in the front of angels he does something for him he lifts him up up there in the presence of God gives him fills him sets him out that's the age we're living in or you mean God going take men put him and call them by to himself give them fill them and send them out and when he sent them out it w't be word only you mean not the kind of we see now no not that kind let's say it again here now this is the age God will take men pull him pull them to themselves give them fill them send them out and when he send them out the Bible said the Lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word that they preaching with signs with wonders with Miracles is not with a song service after the word preach it's not with a special after the word preach it's with signs it's with wonders it's with Miracles you mean that have to come back yes all this is part of what the father said yet all this is what the fathers had and whatever they had we going to have the same thing oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah the same holy spirit that saved the lutherans that Sanctified the methodists that baptized the Pentecostals is Now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus so no man could set that in order Oh Glory to God that's why he said the angel of the Lord is on Earth fixing things around for is coming he going to raise up this one he going to put down this one he going to move this King he going to put a next king here he going to use this kingdom here and he going to break this kingdom here who doing that the Holy Spirit the angel of God and the same holy spirit that saved the lutherans that sanctify the Methodist that baptized the Pentecostal is now set in an order the coming of the Lord Jesus when it will be so powerful shout out powerful that's when the church begin to be set in order it will be so powerful that body will come into this group of church that will draw the rest of them from the grave there will be a resurrection he is talking about the power coming into the church then then there going to be a resurrection not a special song not a song inspiration he talking about a power a literal power come inside of you this building is not the church you are the church you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost you are the one that God want to step into and put on your 16 elements the word made flesh oh give the Lord some Praises tonight oh glory to God that is what the Holy Ghost is for Holy Ghost isn't for argument and debate and this one right and that one right and arguing Doctrine we find out by the word we will never see ey to eye until we go on the other side so forget that eye to ey thing that a happening let me let me give this a good thing now there will never have a group like the 120 in the upper room that is happening that was only for then it have no Bunch going on one man and one ACC call like they had in the upper room this is the Gentile here now oh glory to God you could get the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is poured out on individuals the Holy Ghost can pour it on you and the next person next to you and have a clue what is happening to you oh give the Lord a shout that's why you got to know what you're coming for you got to know what you're looking

things back then and things of mysterious things they're trying to blow up together and make man into dust and so forth what but now what we need is the spirit of God to raise a standard amen what is it he is pouring his Spirit then those that are resting out y in the grave saying how long how long Lord how much longer God is waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time oh give the Lord a shout on that one when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection this is more than a message more than teaching more than explaining this is more than all of that this is God pointing to you in the upper room they didn't want an explanation they wanted a manifestation Jesus said I will not leave you comfortless the comforter is with you but shall be in you this word word word you're hearing will be transform into Power because he said the word that I speak come on now they are [Applause] Spirit Oh Glory to God how many believe that how many believe the word

when the church and Christ become so close together till Christ becomes visible shout out visible the word was invisible until the word become flesh so whenever the word become flesh we must know because Christ becomes visible and the only way to see him visible is to see his works I'm not hearing you to see him visible is to see him at work then they that is Jesus that is Jesus that is Jesus is Jesus he's the same yesterday today and forever let me say it again I want I don't think some of you getting it to see him you have to see the spirit in [Music] action not the spirit in explanation you see how far people are from what they're supposed to expect they're looking for priest man priest be any pulpit to teach them after 50 years they still looking for a manri Hallelujah the Lord himself work with the disciples the Lord himself called them guys Peter come and youw come come come they know God called them they preach with him Hallelujah they eat with him they sleep with him and when Jesus died all of them went back back to square one and the see seed that they had was in their soul if all they needed was a seed in the soul then they didn't need the upper room right with the seed in the soul Peter deny Christ with the seed in the soul all the disciples bust it and run that death 7 night and they were seeds of God Jesus prayed father you give them me you give them to me before the foundation of the world those guys clueless what he talking about father I pray that they be one as you and I are one Hallelujah already said at that day you shall know I'm in the father

not in Jerusalem people seeing him here and see no no no he just come back for his disciples Amen to open the word to them and to open the understanding because you have to understand what he open we go what habac say write the vision and make it plain that he that read it may run if the vision is not plain how you going to read it Oh Glory to God so God send some pastors some ministers Oh Glory men after the prophet left to make the vision plain it's a vision it's not topics it's a vision we are preaching a topic we preaching a vision the vision is for an appointed time you can't manifest

vision of God a vision for your life a vision for the church a vision for your marriage a vision for your home there must be a [Applause] vision and when God give a vision it has to come to pass amen

something oh Hallelujah the promise of the father what he promise power power not weakness power power is strength power Oh Glory to God and that's why the Bible said put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand the devil because he coming he coming to attack he coming to press he coming to cut you off off he said be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might he talking about Spirit power now oh glory to God not just quoting scripture but power in your inner man power in your inner being power in your heart in your spirit and your body and your soul Oh Glory to God this is your promise to become a living manifestation of the Living God this is your promise to be a living moving Monument this is your promise be an anvil of God like Sparks over Anvil Oh Glory to

it together they're not in charge life is in charge life slapping them up and you're going away how life hit you but there no Jesus wanted that's right he want you to take charge of that life take charge of your area of your domain of your environment of your home of your world he want you to be in charge of that you have to have dominion where you are you have to have dominion over you oh glory to God you can't look for Power outside and you don't have power on the [Applause] inside so that is why Jesus was sent after he received the fullness of the Holy Ghost Into the Wilderness amen for Jesus to deal with the Devil by the word amen that he could return in the power of the spirit because once they could get you with the word you could have to come back in the spirit Oh Glory to God now we had the spirit you know but God pull it off that we get tested with the word when he finish the test in the wilderness the Spirit come back upon him the Bible said return in the power of the spirit I want to emphasize that power of the spirit Power of the spirit Power of the spirit Oh Glory power of the spirit not just power of the word power of the spirit the spirit itself is a power and when the enemy coming like the flood that power that Spirit going to raise a standard in your life in your walk in your home on the job on the street in your neighborhood God will raise a standard in your life you have got to believe that you have got to expect that Oh Glory to God hallelujah when Jesus overcame he sat down until his enemy become his foot stools expecting them to be bowing on him oh Hallelujah so we he said until Christ become visible Among Us and raises the dead and we go into the Rapture three things there Christ become visible because we can't raise no dead that's right that that raising that is the voice of the Archangel thing and Jesus do all three he does the shout he does the voice he does the Trump Jesus does all tree so that shout voice that voice have to come into the bride so it's Christ in the bride to raise the dead we can't raise no dead that's the voice of the Archangel ministry that's the ministry of Jesus Christ oh hallelujah praise God I want to say it again that's the ministry of Jesus Christ there no man in ch Ministry and some man out there Ministry that's foolishness Oh Glory to God what we talking is Christ Ministry God's purpose was to have the that he could step into it put on your shoes and wear your tie oh give the Lord a shout wear your dress that's that's God purpose God above us God with us and then God in us devil never wanted that Hallelujah and God came monk SI and the mon begin to rock and Shake they said don't let God speak let Moses speak God say okay I go wrap all that thunder and lightning and put it in a man amen hallelujah and all they hearing his voice messages but you know when you convert that it's Thunders and lightning see that's what people don't get the conversion the mountain is God he say if an animal cross it kill it you got it Crossing on Holy Ground make sure you put a barrier across there to make sure people don't cross that I am God and I change not when Moses Ste into the anointing God said take off your shoes don't come here walking like that take off your shoes because where you walk in is Holy Ground show respects this is not your environment this is my environment you had to walk a certain way when you come into my environment take off your shoes and Moses had to take off his shoes not why Lord if I have to do this and do I have to do this you have to do it I'm not hearing you [Music] tonight God show Moses who is the boss God show Moses who in charge oh Hallelujah praise God take off your shoes they Place His Holy Ground hallelujah praise God Amen we're going to show after a while that just those who are filled with the Holy Ghost goes in that Rapture I a care what the ministers preach I a care how deep how wide the mystery is I a care what they preach if all that Mysteries can't convert into holy ghost that is tribulation Saints by the thousands all over the world no wonder Raptor could be a few people because you have to be filled with the Holy Ghost I want to emphasize that fill with G the Holy Ghost and can a man give you that big fat no God put that for man to give God gives the Holy Ghost to them that ask him oh God you got to ask for it you got to see the need for it you got to hunger for it and if you start to hunger for it you already blessed because Jesus said blessed a day that hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be oh you going to be fill if you're hungering and thirsting Oh Glory to God hungering and thirsting after righteousness Oh Glory to God Hallelujah the scriptures is in harmony you know go to Ezekiel 9 they put a mark and put those that s and cry not those that agree with the Abomination those that s and cry say God bring me out of this deliver me for this I I can't stand this I I I want better than this a thirsting for more than this I don't want man's standard I want God's standard I want how we see it in the message I don't want that I want the word the Prophet come to reveal the Bible you come to bring something outside the Bible he come to reveal what the Bible have that we could go back to what the fathers had that's why our heart had to be turned back to the faith of the fathers Oh Glory to God they were gutsy they were rugged they were really gutsy man hallelujah oh my that's right for the rest of the Dead live not for the space of a thousand years just the holy spirit filled people went into the Rapture not the people in this church or that church or somebody believes some man or some bishop or some message Pope no only the Holy Ghost filled the rest is tribulation Saints or we could change it and say only the wise virgins the rest is nice foolish virgins precious brother virgin but foolish sister virgin foolish the wise want extra extra oil not extra information extra oil extra power extra anointing extra Spirit Oh Glory when they begin to pray and ask for they didn't ask for more word they didn't ask for more Mysteries they say oh Lord stretch forth your hand bring down some power that we could have Clarity and boldness to preach this message fearlessly and while they were praying Oh Glory to God not while they were gossiping not while they were fellowshipping while they were praying all of a sudden Lord Glory power Oh Glory my God I feel on fashion tonight my God I feel it for this thing tonight this is what is promise man you have to look for it we have to preach it for you to expect it if we don't preach it how you expect it if we don't say it how you going to look for it oh glory to God hallelujah praise God I am pointing you to what you is Promised for you this is your portion oh Hallelujah glory to God the spirit alone could bring Revelation that this will be your portion oh hallelujah praise God hallelujah am Hallelujah can I continue amen okay listen to this this is happened before Pentecost he give them power against unclean spirits so these deciples had power wasn't internal power wasn't resident power it was temporary power shout out temporary temporary so God can give temporary power who preaching that doesn't sound so nice because it ex it's exposing any temporary preachers right all right all right temporary fivefold what was promised was permanent power or resident power or aesan well power which is the power from within Jesus said it this way he that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water this SP he of the Holy Ghost which they had not yet received come on now preach back to these are scriptures this is the scriptures this is the word of God so yet they were preaching yeah yet the kingdom is at hand casting out Devils they had temporary power but that is what was not promised because once that power move off them they backslid they a condition they in frustration they in tears they Under Pressure because the power is not yet within they have the potential but it's not yet within Oh Glory to God I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you this wild will see at me no more but you going to see me he's not talking about physical come on now give the Lord a shout he said the comforter is with you but shall be in you but I can't be in you like this it has to be converted he said if I don't go I be comforter can't come so don't try to hold me here I got to go so Jesus himself was pointing them to a dead end he was pointing them to the end of self because Moses came to a dead end and Joshua cross over Jesus came to a dead end and the Holy Ghost took them over see you have to come to a dead end because this is not the tree of knowledge where you try to intellectualize and figure out everything and explain everything Hallelujah it has to be the portion now where is the tree of life that crosses you into the spirit and as men as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God this is not a letter message this is from the bosom of the spirit of God the fullness of the Holy Ghost visited the church to reveal all Seven Seals and the Seven SE is to bring back the Holy Ghost itself back among God's people all everybody know God was with William brandham and God used William brandham but the Bible said he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the face of the father he had a job he did it he actually restored the faith what has to happen now that faith has to be activated in a bride to confirm the restoration of the faith we not trying to restore original the faith has been restored it has been confirmed by a prophet so now we have to get that same confirmation Oh Glory to God in other words we are identified with the message but the hour has come where the message have to be identified with us that's two different things that's two different things I love the prophet I love the message I love the word I believe the word all that is you love that and you believe that and you seeing that and you unfold that and you have reation of that that's good but when God said this is my beloved Son that's a different talk Al together there no message talk there no book talk that is the father Hallelujah Oh Glory to God the father's approval to call Sons and Daughters aside if you see that you could run tonight if you see that you could pray tonight if you see that nobody could stop you from reaching out in the spirit Oh Glory to God to pull down your portion Oh Glory to God no Pastor no Bishop nobody could keep you and hinder you from getting what God promised you because Joshua represent the Holy Ghost and Joshua is to cross the people over into the Promised Land and God told Joshua every place you put your foot is yours if we don't put our foot on signs and wonders we will not get signs and wonders if we don't put the foot on the power of God we will not get the power of God we have got to put our feet on every [Applause] promise I want to see every gift back in the church the gift of wisdom the gift of speaking in tongues the gift of interpretation of tongues the

Zoe that is God's own life Oh Glory to God oh my dear friends around this country in this little city if I only my human voice plac into your heart the importance of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and yet that Prophet say you can have the bapti the Holy Ghost and still be lost am but what is the context of that because you can be baptized in your spirit and not baptizing your soul am so the context of that is where you get that baptism so Peter and them didn't say I have you seed in my soul I don't need no upper room I have an understanding the word open up to me and and the word open up to me and my understanding open up and I know who I am and I know my position and I know my place in God yeah the next time they run Peter he run he run just as fast as when he Deni Jesus Christ because he will have he'll be a man who the world open to he understand open but he have no power so when them Pharisees come with the long beard and the tall hats and the long pretty gongs and start to say you you you you you you say no no no not me he willite Jesus all over again with all the understanding up because when them FY licks it's gone to gone it's human you're talking about nobody want to get blows nobody want to get prison nobody they want to get lock up that's why they come and say behold their threatenings they may care after that is power inside them brothers hallu behold their threatenings and all they what they doing and why did he rage and why David said that them praying all that kind of prayer so they care why they raging and carrying on they say Lord give us power to go back out there to face them devils aresh and God send down power all over again they were filled all over again we call it a refilling of the Holy Ghost a fresh baptism fresh baptism a fresh anointing a fresh fresh power Oh Glory to God don't we want that fresh thing he say if I could only with my human voice plac into your heart the importance of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost it will be the most wonderful Revelation that you ever had in your life to see you must do it oh glory to God so Satan makes sin appealing he the enemy keeps finding a better bait he will strip all off a little more and Mak her look naked woman Satan keeps bringing sin in and that was the original sin and the same thing as the kingdom come in the Warfare now watch God here we go doesn't have to do anything to make it more appealing the only thing he has to do is to raise up a standard of his own word against the enemy and the Bible said when the enemy come like a flood the spirit raised the standard what does he do he makes the same word that he already said more positive that's how we raise our standard hallu so the time is not yet Hallelujah and the devil is Raging in Trinidad and around the world he's mad he is angry he sees potential in you and he's trying to out that he's angry understand that now now God going to raise a standard what does he do make the same word same word and make it more positive what did God do to Abraham tell him you're going to have Isaac 25 years Abraham standing alone Sarah clueless because Abraham couldn't share the Revelation with Sarah so he is standing in the Gap with his Revelation and stand in the gap for S also here come Three Angels amen hallelujah Genesis 18 God come down to raise a standard hallelujah what did God tell Abraham I spoke to you 25 years ago about Isaac and a coming am I will return according to the time of life what is he saying I ain't come back as man again I ain't coming with dust and flesh again so don't look for a man a coming and Resurrection transformational power to change your body hallelujah hallelujah I am going to return ho ho some flesh and blood some message Pope some man of the hour not that he said I'm coming and when he came it wasn't Flesh and Blood it was power he come to give Abram encouragement to give him a word I come to tell you I'm coming Oh Glory to God I come to tell you I'm coming I come to tell you the promises not hand the promises night the dynamic is about to pour out I come to tell you hold on there hang in there time of life is coming and when your time of Life come no devil could take that from you oh give the Lord some Praises tonight when your time of break you come no devil could bind you when Israel time of Liberty come Pharaoh couldn't hold them back you have to let them go and sickness have to let you go depression has to let you go all them conditions around your life have to let you go give the Lord some Praises [Music] [Applause] tonight Glory Glory now watch you may be seated what say the spirit the spirit and the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say would already be said in the word you see I have a revelation that God can only confirm this word so I am not interested in my own thoughts my dreams and my understanding to you I want this come alive I know I have to be able to say this is that that the prophet William random spake of not this is what to say I have no message I preaching another message another man's message this is that that the prophet spake about oh you got to know what this is to identify that I'm not hearing you I'm not hearing you that is why Jesus open understanding to the scriptures that's why Peter who couldn't sign his name CU Jesus took them into Joel he took them into Isaiah Oh Glory to God Isaiah 28 with Tamar and lips somebody can say I see Jesus stagger and stagger in well you stay there watching Jesus watching Jesus you better watch what Jesus prophesy you better watch the prophecy Hallelujah watch the prophecy he took them to die with stammering lips n tongue I speak to this people B said they were so quickened with his quickening power their tongues are they couldn't talk the noral language they were so quick and they talk to heaven when they open their mouth so another language had to come out oh glory to God Hallelujah the tongue was quickened the hand was quickened the anointing was all over them they were filled with the quickening power Paul was so filled with that power that they take cloths off of him and the anointing was on the cloth that's why the anointing will be in your hands when you slay hands upon the sick they have to recover all them demons know that fire they felt that fire before they know that power before Oh Glory to God that's why The Church Must Stand triumphant because the same resurrected spirit Power that was in Jesus will be upon you the bride Oh Glory to God hallelujah do you believe that amen let's continue the message of the last day the evening like messenger according to Malachi 4 Hallelujah will be turning the hearts of the children back to the fathers amen the Pentecostal original message that the fa of the fathers Hallelujah the next quote he say the Pentecostal part in the restoration time so in other words the word has been restored but we have to come back to the Pentecostal part amen which is what is the original the cal part is the power part the spirit part 1906 they thought that was the Dynamics that was only a spiritual awakening amen hallelujah way in the womb that's why the Mysteries could be revealed to them he said because they were only begotten that mean the Pentecost was still in the womb hallu so William brandham was sent to reveal the very person of God which is the person of the Holy Ghost so whereas the Pentecost 96 had the birth he brought the very person and he revealed the person of Christ look at there compare it consists of seven Parts the very person of God and that is what has to come inside of you the very person of Christ so he said here now when come like a flood he raised the standard against it watch and Eden he gave them his word for their armor just the word spoke then the enemy came like a flood he took the word and made it flesh to dwell on among us a little stronger here he's walking on the earth going to call me Ho Holy anyhow first it was spoken with out yonder now here it is you could touch it it's made flesh and then when the enemy come like a flood he pour the word into the person Hallelujah be in the form of the Holy Ghost hallu so in Eden was just word the day you eat thereof that day you die just word stay behind the word then he raised his standard and bring the word to become flesh this is Jesus then he raise a higher standard and bring the word inside the people and to do that he had to convert it into spirit so word coming to you is not head knowledge it's not information it's not how much you know about the message and about the Peaks and about this and about the angels and how the angel wings s back and so on that's not that that's right that's not word in you that word you could talk that's what they can explain but when that word becomes Spirit that's you that comes into you let's continue he took the word okay let's go so first it was the spoken word of Y here it is you could touch it then it could become flesh and when enemy come in like a flood he poured the word into the person being the form of the Holy Ghost there you are 1 2 three justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost so forth imperfection notice the spoken word God above us amen God with us then God in US God's Army marching on God's spoken word above us Pillar of Fire ah word turn pillar fire God above us manifesting Pillar of Fire God With Us Jesus Christ amen God in you Holy Ghost GH Hallelujah so watch and that's the way we try to bring our ches today with the highest people prettiest pews best crowd that don't break the to Hole of the enemy it takes it takes the hidden power of the spirit of God that word in dear to break the hole like Peter he was good with his sword when Jesus got in trouble he pulled out his sword he could flop anywhere and cut the high priest's servant air off with a sword but when it come to real Christian Courage he didn't have it so with all what Peter had and Jesus coming and the the priest coming he draw a sword cut out in Priest ears Jesus to pick up the ears and put it back and heal it one time man unbeliever can heal one time yes instant Miracle but he didn't have the Christian Courage oh hallelujah praise be to Jesus Hallelujah so he failed right there why why he only know one thing his Creed God there I say nothing know he said Peter only know his Creed what something now oh God people they know the Creed well good they are expert at the Creed Hallelujah but brother after he went to Pentecost he put on the whole armor of God watch him watch him he's a different person now since he put on the whole armor same man different person because now we have the whole armor what was it here we go listen to this that word that he walked with was in him all right burning him up with fire in his flesh and soul how many feel depressed tonight I'm almost done my God what is it let me say it again what was what was it that word that he walk with was in him burning him up with fire in his flesh and soul what did Jeremiah brother say Thy word is like fire shut up in my bones watch that's God's provided armor he had the baptism filled with the Holy Ghost what is it God makes himself ever present in his own Army God on the day of Pentecost sent down the full armor of God for his army that was himself among you amen then he quot in the scripture yet a little while the world seeth me no more he shall see me because I live he shall be live also watch and then he's the same yesterday then forever he is with us in us that's the armor it is him he is the word and he is the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit in is in us which is the word making the promise manifest Christ is the word and he makes it manifest the spirit quickens the word in other words he is the powder that sends the bullet out there with it Hallelujah he only had one place to hit and that was right between the eyes talk about David rest of it was armed but God got in that Spirit what was it he had five Stones slingshot f a i t h and here he comes something fixing to happen CU there's the word the promise the power to sling it and that's what we need today is a man here we go that will take God's word with the power of the Holy Ghost behind him to press it out there and watch it come to pass that is God's Army not an explanation a man to push the word which is what word the promise and watch the prophecy come to pass it take Faith to do that you know he said watch the black Skies roll back and the power of God moving and take over let's continue here now in his army he presents his army in the form of five offices first apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanding officers all with the baptism of the Holy Ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes upon to meet the enemy with the word of God each one backing one another up not fighting one another each one in this Army will be backing one another up watch with him the chief captain and this is the part I want to get tonight not out here in front up here above back behind but in themall so this fivefold ministry this five fold Ministry we talk about here they will have the pillar fire resident the Holy Ghost in them hallelujah oh my my my my my so God know in the last days there will come intellectual Giants there will come everything intellectual all kinds of things the enemy with reasoning power to try to prove to the church that the days of Miracle is passed and God packed the baptism of ghost with what speaking in tongues interpretation and tongues prophecies gifts they they may seem hard in training but brother on the Battlefront every one of them got to be used Hallelujah every one of these gifts have got to be used God equips his Souls exactly is what what it may take to use they might say just learn psychology that won't work that's as stin as the brought me of a shell of a chicken staff to death that is no good we have to have power of the Holy Ghost coming upon a man with all the nine spiritual gifts dwelling in him but there's a big one when I see this here like I never saw the one before this is what we talking about the Holy Ghost coming upon a man with all nine spiritual gifts dwelling in him so you can't have faith to move mountains and don't have charity then sounding brass and tingling symbol Oh Glory to God you have to have all the characteristics that charity has in it charity suffer it long and His Kind it's not puffed up it not easily provoked it bear it all things

multitude of [Laughter] sins i i a see charity come to expose sins in that way but charity the one that has cover there's a heavy one you I can't see charity gossiping I can't charity I can't see charity being selfish the B say seeketh not her own that's right charity don't rejoice in iniquity that's right so you can't Rejoice over somebody Fallen condition or trouble condition or situation

more years and then go say already know let me send that old man down to Egypt how much power old man Army and they say what you coming with he said the word Let My People Go Fe had a choice respond let them go and what not but he don't believe because the Bible say God hadn't Pharaoh had because God want to break Pharaoh amen and break Egypt to show he is God am I raised up Pharaoh for that when mooses when God come you see you see you see the thing about it when the children of God backslid and they car their foolishness God has punished them God say oh God child nice child no no no God go

you make things right God ready to deal with that isue Hallelujah when the backslide babon King always coming to take them in captivity and when they repent God come to bust the king of Babylon hallu Oh Glory to God Hallelujah by the Rivers of Babylon when I sat down and I remember Zion Oh Glory to God you talk about groaning and travailing by the Rivers of Babylon you don't belong there what you doing in Babylon what you doing in confusion what you doing in Egypt that's not your land that's not your portion we going to home stretch here now oh glory to God so watch something let me read this one again we have to have power of the Holy Ghost coming upon a man with all the nine spiritual gifts dwelling in him you say I don't just get like to get out I don't like to pray all night I don't when you're going then you're going to get killed on the Battlefront God I see somebody say if you don't fast if you don't fast you going to last you stay there until God equips you with the baptism of the spirit so you know what you're praying from tonight Lord baptize me with your spirit I want a fresh baptism I want a baptism Holy Ghost I want you to empower my life I want virtue power to come into my life Hallelujah watch watch something now that's everything you need of this world or the world to come lives right in you that's the all wise God know how to equip his army he equipped his army with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he knew that we have to have it Hallelujah yes have a bum coming here are you ready he knew that we have to have it he knew that people would reason would go to readon this word when it become in print out there so he know that this word will come into print and people would read and because they like to read they keep on reading but they're not thirsting and hungering for the baptism of the spirit they going by what they read I think this what readon again he knew we have to have it he knew that people would reason would go to reason this word when it become in print out there what would happen and today we find people saying well is he God of History where is the god that crossed the Red Sea where is a God that heals his sick what good does it do to give a canary bird vitamins and make him good strong ring and keep him in a cage that's what they're trying to do with the people feed them all kind of vitamins and the first thing you know tell them the days of Miracle is pass so we feed with Mysteries feed with information feed with knowledge are we still on the church and you warm in the church bench no praise no worship no activation of Faith you're not even exercising your faith in God to believe God for miracles in your house in your home you lost your job You Weep you cry you moan you complain you Vex with God this say work out that work out you Vex you puff your mou carrying on no faith at all not not no Lord Give the Lord take it away not not worshiping in in the midst of your circumstance that is Faith you know B say Abraham stack out the promise of God true unbelief but was strong in faith giving praise to God that that praise showed strength of Faith because faith is what you're hoping for faith is not yet but it shall be faith is what revealed to you and is not real to you yet in experience but it's revealed to you in spirit it's not real yet in experience but it's revealed to you is Faith so you can praise God for your healing praise God for deliverance praise God for the victory praise God for the Holy Ghost praise God for Revival praise God for your your promotion you increase our pay you praise to God in advance H God know it would take the baptism of the Holy Ghost to prove his latterday signs to Be an Effective witness Satan knows that reason and what reason LS to be an effectual wit of his resurrection he know it would take the Holy Ghost because man cannot do those things do those things not talk those things not preach those things do those things oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah course man can't do those things he he equipped his army with the Holy Ghost to to do those things to make known the secrets of the heart as he promised you can't do that with any kind of a training you got to do it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the armor of God and this is the even light to make Hebrews 138 a reality then it will take more than a training you can read words and read words and read words but it will never come to pass until you have the Holy Ghost there to manifest that I didn't say it he said it three times you could read words you could read words you could read words but it will take the Holy Ghost to take them words and make it bring it come to pass that's the light put on the whole armor of God not just a dress only and dress up and say glory to God I got the Holy Ghost and then splitting all the power out with whistle you're not doing no good put it into action put it in faith make it move make it do something put down the whole armor of God to go out and withstand the Ws of the devil Oh Glory to God you think I act funny maybe I am I've lost my mind to the world and found it in Christ let that mind was in Christ be in you it takes the baptism of the Holy Ghost the whole armor of God not just to shake hands with the preacher put your name on the book or take some kusher and swallow it and some priest drink up the wine that isn't it but Brothers stay there until there comes a Russian Mighty Wind hallelujah how do we don't talk about that stay there until they come a Russian mighty win that fills all your being and takes all your doubts out and takes all your Creeds out and take everything else out and puts the word in there with the power of the Holy Ghost to back it up oh glory to God he said I've got plenty more I ain't going to say brother the whole armor of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the word behind it if anybody says they got the Holy Ghost and and and and deny one word it's not the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost will accept and believe and confirm the word okay I'm finished now mus come up please Hallelujah now the big machine is setting up there ready to move the mechanics is already there they got the mechanical system of organization the United Nations the nations are united together it's United time I preached it the United Nations is nothing but a big rubber balloon that's carried about with every nation's wi of Doctrine it will bust and blow up at anything it can't work neither can the Council of churches work it's an organization by man contrary to the system watch the other great churches the Pentecostal Kingdom the Full Gospel people how can they forfeit the Evangelical teachings the very principles they stood for they will have to Forfeit their Evangelical Doctrine to walk into man who disagree with the principles of the Bible yes there you are that's the hour we have arrived at that's the big machine that's set up they have got the mechanics they have the mechanics so have we listen the only thing they have to have is Satan in there with the Dynamics to force the marking of the Beast what do we say about two Services back National Force with Israel in Homeland National Force will put the churches in the work and churches but the power of God will put the people in the bright not a minister not teaching not preaching but the power so the power is what is Promised Oh Glory to God do we believe that Hallelujah glory to God so now the only thing you have to have is Satan in there with Dynamics so brother it you being United Nations waiting for Dynamics to enforce the laws of course Dynamics going to bring to pass and make manifest everything it is when she is forced down then the Dynamics is working the mechanics is there they already got them let me say something too this uniting time to see churches uniting Nations uniting it's United time of God this bride too and I say this with reverence and respect I believe the bride of Christ is called she is sealed in the kingdom of God hallelujah so he is saying it and he's prophesying I believe the mechanics is there they are waiting for the Dynamics what the bride is waiting for what the bride is waiting for what the B is waiting for he said they are waiting for dynamics that will take her off the earth into glory and the Rapture I believe with all my heart we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it how why because he is the dynamic so you mean a bishop is not a Dynamics right a message a pastor is not the Dynamics he is the Dynamics we become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see him uniting himself with his us with his works and his love gifts he this part as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper the church is reunited I'm finished last quotes the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up exactly like that even the dead that dead in Christ 100 years ago will rise in the beautiful Holiness and take the flight to the skies the Dynamics is the holy spirit that's why I WR read acts 4 the Dynamics is acts 4 acts 4 is possible because they had the acts two they were filled and then they had to be refilled the Dynamics of this church would be a refilling of the Holy Ghost before you refilled you have to be filled oh Hallelujah are you looking for that Filling tonight could we to play and just stand and just Worship the Lord oh oh praise God oh glory to God woo the Dynamics is the holy [Music] spirit Hallelujah let's Worship the [Music] Lord Hall hallu something happened now I
