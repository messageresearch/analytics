me to one portion of Scripture really come see Matthew 25 and reading from verse 1 thank you the Gideon Matthew 25 and verse 1 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said to the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh middle-order the blessing to the reading of his word he may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord is such a great privilege to be back in the house of the Lord tonight and I really was blessed on Sunday how many were blessed on Sunday the double service the pillar of fire by the Anthony in the morning and brother over it in the evening your thoughts your testimony your life really really really a tremendous tremendous time and we looking for God to continue to do something for us in a special way tonight and I have a little thought tonight making preparation for the coming of the Lord making preparations for the coming of the Lord and in the message looking for Jesus but Abraham said now we want to speak us every meeting so this is my desire tonight about Jesus Christ he's a center for worship the center of our attraction the center of all of our life all that we have and want are and will be is based upon him he was the one who came and gave his life for us came down from God out of glory and was made flesh dwelt among us and taken upon him the sin of us all the sickness of us all boy awaits at Calvary and they appeared the price he's worthy of all the praise that can be given him do you feel that way this evening that he is worthy of all the praise that can be given to him and in God had a provided way I mean it's gonna touch in a few quotes God likes to show his power not that he has to but he loves to do it that's really powerful so he loves to do it it pleases him in his omnipotence to let his subjects know who he is and and he lets his subjects know who he is by his power but Aaron said I'm so happy of it because he showed me his power so we talking tonight about preparations and Myra bannerman said before God before you want more of God there's got to be more of God to respond to that crave so before God could have a desire in your heart that needs to be filled the the thing that is supposed to fill that is I have to exist before the desire could be there so there have to be some preparations mean before there could be a desire to have what has been repaired can the church say mmm so we building to something whether Branham said the people in the spirit of the latter days the nations are in the spirit of the end time they got atomic weapons hydrogen weapons all kinds of things because it's the spirit of the deal the people are in the spirit of the end time the church is moving together under the power and the impact of the Holy Spirit the world is running out yonder and making fun scuffing laughing and they living like the devil every day it's in the spirit of the thing God's getting ready to take his and the devil is getting ready to take his so it's a preparation thing that's going on God is getting ready the devil is getting ready the world is getting ready the church is getting ready the bride is getting ready there's preparation that's happening all the time you may not think something's going on but you are getting ready the student who is going to school when you are not studying you are getting ready you're getting ready to fail because if you're not studying you're actually preparing yourself for failure but the person who is studying you're preparing yourself to overcome you preparing yourself to pass the exam because you're putting things in place because you're getting ready so even when you think you're doing nothing you're actually still making preparation because pepper ition is always going on can the church mmm not better Branum sin before God does anything he always prepares for it so God is not now deciding to do something he already prepared for it before he could do anything there has been a preparation made can the church amen whatever I said before we go over to fight a wall first we have to prepare for the war you don't go to a war without having some type of preparation some type of plan what am I gonna do if you want to travel somewhere you got to make preparation you can't travel without a passport you can travel without a ticket so you need to think about the passport before you could travel you have to think about it ticket before you could travel if you need clothes for the environment that you're going to you have to have clothes packed in your bag to meet the conditions that you're about to meet and where they ban them said to get over there you have to have divine love packed in your bag before you can get over there so you got to make preparations here so that you can meet the condition that exists over there can the church same and so far tighter tonight making preparations for the coming of the Lord before you go to fight you gotta make preparation before you can run a marathon you can't just wake up if you wake up in the morning and you have not been working out there's no marathon that you could run before you go 10 15 20 minutes you don't burn out if you want to run a marathon if you want to run a sprint a long-distance runner those people practice if it's every game every other day they watch what they eat their watch how they arrest they do their push-ups they do their setups they do everything because they know what they are preparing to do and if we are preparing for a rapture if we are prepared for a resurrection if you are preparing for wedding supper if you're preparing for healing if you're preparing for deliverance there's got to be some preparation that we are making before we leave this place come the church say man or whatever I said before you come to church you have to make preparations for me to be here this evening I had to make preparations because I didn't get to go back home after I went to work so I had to think this morning before I went to work I had to make preparations because I have to be in church can the church say man Oh what are you getting ready for what are you preparing for do you know what you're preparing for do you know what you're supposed to expect do you know the conditions that must be met when you meet the conditions you got to know it before you meet the conditions you got to know it David didn't even realize what he was preparing for somebody preached back to me David didn't even realize that when he met a lion it was preparation when he met the bear it was preparation so when he meet Goliath he was already prepared up he wasn't no warming up in front of Goliath the beer was his preparation the lion was his preparation your trials are your preparation your testings are your preparation your ups and your downs that's your preparation when you read the word that's your preparation when you pray in the night that's your preparation when you come to church that's your preparation when you all come on now you're getting it tonight every day is preparation and that's why Satan is mad because today you are more ready than yesterday Oh hallelujah somebody say man Oh glory glory glory glory hallelujah you got to understand that God prepared this thing the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so God prepared for redemption before that was even here there was a preparation mirror for you to get black over there before you even made a mistake God prepared a way for you to get back to him before you challenge him he prepared a way for you to reconnect to him before you hung up your phone on Jesus he made Oh to reconnect your life he paid your bill because you couldn't meet up in yourself so you can be reconnected tonight and the church seemeth and before Colchis in revival he's got to have men prepare to take it and put a random speak of there must be a place prepared for the world to be made manifest I'm excited tonight because I feel me already I feel you're ready to see the lame walk I feel you're ready to see the dumb talk I feel we are ready for the opening of the word for every fear that God predestinated to comfort let me prophesy tonight we have not been getting ready in vain we have not been warming up in the backside of the desert in vain we have been getting ready for seventh on the revival we will get ready for resurrection for a restoration can the church Shaymin you may be seated hallelujah glory glory glory glory I'm getting ready what are you doing but I think I'm getting ready why are you here this evening I'm getting ready what are you doing today i'ma go to church I'm getting ready when you wake up in the morning woody I'm getting ready what did you I'm leaving here some morning when this life is over I am gonna fly away my bags already packed my bag is already packed if your stare earlier to have to get ready we come to theaters tea ready to get the reminder to leave home without your passport don't leave home without your ticket don't leave home without your backpack because anything now we can believe in here we just waited for the call it's time to leave it's time to leave but before we get that call there's got to be a power put into the church to pull your family to pull your loved ones because we're the panem said all that you love all I never loved you we'll be there jesus said the promise is unto you and to your children so you are getting prepared to prepare them by fire by power by time knowledge so we can leave this place can the church say man Oh glory you may be seated the cheering of Israel went out the turn of isn't one yeah the children of Israel living in bondage didn't know their head from their foot didn't know how they were gonna make it out they had been in bondage for so long didn't even thought it was a distant memory that I deliver I was gonna come but when Court is ready to have a deliverance he puts a man in there who can handle it and God flipped it so smooth he slipped Moses to be fed clothed and trained in Egypt so that he had the best food he had the best clothes he had the best education and when Cora's more prepared for him he said no come and go to the desert and and taught a little bit what is going to hit already he's making sure the conditions are right he's making sure everything is in place God loves he's a chess player he loves to put this piece here and put this piece here he's here not yet not yet not yet but when he's ready here comes Moses coming down into Egypt what Kingdom do you represent the kingdom of the Most High what God do you represent I don't know if you know his name but he said I am that I am strip me come on somebody preach back to me you know what I love the children of Israel really have feet but Moses his feed for them was bigger than the total of even oh come on somebody preach back to me the faith in the experience that Moses had was bigger than the tote the collective tote could not destroy Moses feet and the chest a man because when hero increase the world that was under people they had to have faith in something and they had to trust that Moses knew what he was talking about because it's Saturday mama they see you talking deliverance and the child's got heavier you're talking breakthrough and the pressure increase and Moses had to scream as other people hang in there just keep watching God is getting ready he's getting ready to break Pharaoh he's getting ready to set you free he's getting ready to restore your children what your grandfather went through that your children don't have to go through because the deliverer asked I had to wait all these years I was waiting for you to get here I was waiting for your children to get here because somebody have to go over to the promised land so Maurice Haman you may be seated hallelujah dear collective doubt let me say it again the collective doubt of the people was not enough to the minister faith Moses sarah's feeling about her woman our condition was not big enough the doubt she had could not open the feet that Abraham had come on now somebody speak to me so tonight I'm not talking about the feet of your family tonight I'm not talking about the feet of your children I'm talking about your feet being prepared to come to perfect fate because public sin is based on the position that you're standing in and all these the escort has been preparing you for your position as a son and daughter in the economy of God somebody say men tonight Oh hallelujah can the church say man David didn't know you may be seated that when he came to play bhop timber Oh will preach it then he was being prepared for the throne but you don't just get to the throne you got to understand how the throne room operates you got to understand who has the influence over where the ice bucket is you have to know which fan man is the man who controls the fans you have to understand which security guard but keep certain people out so when David is here playing the harp he is watching what's moving he knows who he gotta talk to he knows who has what influence what is God to and preparing David because one day this little boy is gonna be a king he didn't even understand what he was walking into but Korra's making preparations and God has been preparing you in your job in your school all these years every action every reaction is course preparation can the church say man but Abraham said God hidden sundry times he wanted his children to have the best do you believe that God wants you to have the best yes here's something nice in him he has here something good enough he ain't wanna have now said he said what he want to have the best so if you don't be best yet it means just tell every so what God's plan is for your life because he wanted him to have the best so he made preparations so his preparation is for you to have what the best come to church same and so he for shouted at rural prophets he had revealed it in Christ and the table is set today and every man and woman that invited us all welcome to come to this table for he was wounded for our transgressions and with His stripes we were healed it's all foreseen it's provided and prepared the meal is ready the call is given he foresaw it he made preparations it's God's provided way for you when your soul is hungry can the church say men and brethren said call always prepares the people for the events that's just about to happen so everything that's happening right now God has prepared his people for what's about to happen and I know in recent times at all these coronavirus understand that you have a lot of people people living in fear people making all kind of memes and jokes and comments and thing and it's a real thing it's a real people living in fear I mean one thing that Jesus said a lot was for fear not fear not till about 63 times you see fear not fear not whenever it is fear not you see for God hath not given us a spirit of fear so it is not in the book Valarie of christians they say I'm afraid of what I mean fact where the branch said be reckless and fearless anybody will me tonight I'm very balanced said and some of God's preparation has been so ridiculous to the people who depend on a tree of knowledge because God's preparation has been absolutely ridiculous to the natural mind because a natural mind can conceive the things that are of God because they are foolishness to him and he just think they thing is horrible to say why would God do something can the church same and so the whole world is preparing for funeral service but there are some people who are preparing for the resurrection they are preparing for the rapture they are preparing for the wedding supper listen if you want to take part in the Olympics I saw some training years ago for one of these swimmers in Olympia Greece and listen it was not just swimming you know it's every kind of hard exercise and he said for three years you have a routine because you want to win and he last knew he was this far from it a little bit and the amount of work what is it it's preparation that needs to be made can the church same and so there are people who are preparing because Jesus is coming for bride and by faith and declaring tonight the final call is on behold the bridegroom cometh I'm on the expectation because we have a purpose we have a destination but before we leave here God has got to give us something kind of church seem and now God but everyone said cannot make a decision today and tomorrow come back and make a better decision because his first decision is perfect he never has to change it so we can rest upon whatever God says can the church say Amen is not something we can rest upon whatever he says because he cannot come and make a better decision so when God called you there's no better plan he could put in place he already call you that's the best plan in place he picked the best out of everybody to give them this great gospel this great message and they're true many churches many groups many countries but they're all called on the one Lord on the one feet under one baptism can the church say man and it's always been God's Way to let his people know what's going to happen before it happens he doesn't let everybody know he doesn't let the dodo the wool let's have no but he lets his children or predestinated people or call out people so we are not surprised can the church say man by what's happening in the political realm you're not surprised by what's happening in the economic realm we're not surprised by what happening with wars and plagues and rumors of wars before the rain could fall in the days of nor God had to let nor knows what happened good Neiman judge Sodom and Gomorrha without elected Abraham know what is gonna happen is it how can I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do hallelujah and the relationship God had with Abraham was different than the one he has with you because you are bright you are wife he will have to let you know what he's about to do before he does anything he's gonna make sure that you are in the place you're supposed to be in before anything could happen to you and the church say man his love for you that's how love is love wants to reach out to you to let you know what's gonna happen can the church say Amen so no I was not surprised by when the rain began to fall no one knew how the story would end because God showed him the end because God is the beginning and the end he could show the end of the story before the children of Israel were in bondage court already told the end before the ponded she said with a mighty hand I'll bring them out he spoke of deliverance before they even went is a bondage come on now somebody preached back to me oh come on now so you don't think God knows all the struggles and the trials you went through and already nobody and looking like and he already kicked that end and true foreknowledge wrote your name in the book that's no devil could erase it no situation could move it no child could destroy it in fact he said what shall separate us from the love an cup pass Masum pestilence fear nothing so tonight we know how the story's gonna end oh we know our end and we know the devil's end I know my end because I don't have an ending come on somebody preach back to me oh the table things you know so you're gonna end but I have no end because I always was in corner Oh everything that had a beginning has an end name we never had a beginning because we were always a part of God but the devil had a beginning and he have an ending can the church say man this is what you've been preparing for Oh hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the Lord oh right now your story might be filled up you're looking on the ups and down but God already knows how your story is gonna end Oh at the end of your story I see the rapture at the end of your story I see your family at the end of the story I see a smile on your face at the end of your story us here your griots come back daddy and know your story when this world wants to close a chapter of your life God is seen is not just a clothes for you it's a shift of your of your location come and go with me to my father's house he said I go to prepare please look for where I am there you'll be also can the church seem and Oh [Applause] hallelujah I don't care many demons you have to fight to be here tonight you are gonna make it I don't care how many Devils you have to fight to see you standing you are gonna make it you're gonna make it anyhow you're gonna make it through the trials you're gonna make it shoot attesa you're gonna make it through the opposition I don't care how much they heat the fiery furnace where there is one time hotter or seven times hot tub we still not gonna bow down because we are being prepared for something God pick the best agents for this last age and put us through the hardest preparation the hottest child the hottest testing Oh glory to God that be who have gone before without us could never be made perfect they are wondering how we could make it because this age is the age of deception this age is the age of false doctrine and false teaching this age is so slippery so easy to fall on one side and fallen in the next side it was easy in those days you know you believe you don't believe now its doctrine is creted Dogma it's just itself and there over there rooting for us seeing come on pride come on come to perfection come to your position be without us cannot be made perfect they are rooting for us oh they did their part in the preparing God did his part in the he sent his prophet Oh hallelujah to prepare our way for a bride to meet the bridegroom come on now no we have to get ready his wife has made herself ready oh you may be seated so the devil only has a short time to try to stop you every day you make it up in the morning the devil see another day I'm a mom now another day because he knows the countdown is on he knows he listen when did they ever know something is about to change he tries everything in a when when the deliverer I was born he's had to kill everybody when she said what Bush had to kill everybody so when he see the intensity of the attack is him trying to wipe out you heard what the pastor said the boss tried to lick him down did they try to drown him to try to kill him and that's the devil trying everything he could and we all have our testimonies what we have seen what he have not seen because court dispatch angels to prepare our way for you hallelujah when you don't even see the angels they are at your left the at your right they in front of you big why because you are son of the king you testin know you a royalty you walk in the school thinking oh that's another school boy you think another school girl per-unit even see the angels who are marching in front of you you sitting in your class and say good morning sir good morning miss and all around that room because of you angels just dispatched around you you kind of fly down a taxi and the interesting not this one not this one not this one and all of a sudden a couple of you don't know why it's tough for you but it was angels of state formation because they have to go where you go you walk and Istanbul you don't know how you made at home you don't know what kept you alive but there was something over you what is it God calling from the ladies from the west from the north from the south licks a fire he already seen the liquor fire hanging over your head one body made up of different members and we are not leaving this place until every man take his place Oh hallelujah you don't hear me tonight can the church say Amen we're not leaving here until every man is in its place when this body is ready to move when every man is in position but a balance at one time the last steam could be in Africa somewhere but one dear the last name will be called and that last name will take its place and that last name will meet the pillar of fire and the pillar of fire will move from God above us record with us to court in us and then when that last one is in its place when we have all come into the unity of the faith into the knowledge of the Son of God into the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ till there's no more you and me but we are one calling us eyes glory to God you may be seated where he is ahead of the body wherever he moves the body moves where he looks the body looks no more man in the middle of the relationship that's why I said of - ministry is unlimited people don't like to hear that boy is a limited ministry because God always wanted a personal connection with you personal connection with me he want no Secretary between you and him you don't want nobody up to represent to me for him it was Christ was the only water to even relate to you before him can the church say men making preparations for the resurrection for the rapture for the wedding supper for you to receive the Holy Ghost preparations for you to be adopted that's why this persecutor to make sure to wash are you ready yet are you mature enough yet have you died out enough yet have the trials that have come your way position you enough that you are ready to take your position because if you're not ready yet you need some more time of preparation until there's no more of you and it's only him hallelujah Koral extending is a preparation class you know you never over say there's no finish in school there's no school of marriage little school of mature people and all and not gain material but God economy there's a school of preparation called trials and testings it's a good classroom it's a very good class and you know it's a structure the exam when you think you study for it he did the examiner heavy paper say it's a look good I never see this one before let's see this question before this this is a real problem it's a real situation and and quad will have you go over class after class after class until it could pass every exam but rest I stomped him I turned his wife against him that's only Church against him when they could pass that test hi a lawyer yeah but he could take and strip from you

that woman who welcome to the Prophet with the crutches and before the Prophet pray for her she just took the crutches and handed to him what it is she walked out of that situation her feet rose to such a level did she realize that there was nothing stopping her there was nothing holding her back from climbing what was rightfully hers and when you could see that there's nothing holding you back

church say man Oh hallelujah hallelujah but Abraham said God bringing his turnaround to the chaos of Egypt from the tactus of Egypt he brought them out to take them to his promised land and on the road he was making preparations for everything they had need of when they had need of something God had a preparation for it Noah had to make preparations God said it's gonna rain know what consider and say well in kareena know however know he had to make preparations and his preparations sure he actually believed because if he didn't believe he wouldn't do anything but because he believed he started to prepare Esther had to make preparations to go and see the king they had to get real ready to go in front the King David had to make preparations the father of the prodigal son his son was lost his son had walked away but he didn't just sit back there he was always looking out for his son because he knew that there was something about his son that would bring him back home my father knows her son he knows that when things get really bad that boy is gonna come back home so that father was looking for his son every day and the moment he claims him he said walk a little different but that still my boy he didn't come not coming back the way he left but that still my boy he looks like he's been through something but that's still my boy he say go go kill the fatted calf go put on some music go up in the robe he had to make preparations hallelujah preparations for what we expect him can the church say man and we are an expectation for seventh on the revival we are an expectation with the coming of the Lord Simeon was an expectation to see the Christ the Bible said Simeon was just under vote and the only way you can get the Holy Ghost is to be just under vote just like the 3,000 souls who were just under vote on the Holy Ghost fell upon him Cornelius was just a new vote and prayed all the time a memorial went up to heaven for his prayers are you building a memorial for your prayers that you could be recognized as a prayer warrior are you looking for something fault are you running around in another world are you not sure where you're standing you don't know where you're at what are you looking for but simian was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and we are waiting for the consolation of the bride a power of God what dynamics to the mechanics and the Holy Ghost was upon Simeon and the Holy Ghost is upon you tonight hallelujah it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost that he could not see that and it is revealed to us by the Holy Ghost ruh the word that we shall not seek that we shall not all sleep it was revealed to us that we are going to be made perfect it was revealed to us that we are going to be adopted is revealed to us that it's gonna be a power come into your life not just in the church but into your life into your home into your bedroom on your job there be a power that you are gonna have not just the church but you are gonna have your individual inheritance you will have power you will have authority if you shall see this is not the preacher but maybe you if you shall say come the church say Amen Simeon was old Simeon was tired Simeon's friends maybe they stopped coming to church but not Simeon because he was under expectation to see the Lord's Christ could you imagine the critics simians critics the Sadducees of Pharisees though whoever it was in church a long time since Simeon who do you think you are you that you wanna see the Christ you take all these years you think you are not important Simeon you're not a high priest Eliot a deacon you know to you what do you think it is and the church say man but nothing could stop Simeon from getting up every day and being way supposed to be peradventure today is the day so he was making preparations because he didn't know what day would come that the Lord's Christ will come walking into the temple and we don't know what they will come that will be your tear for the Holy Ghost your tear for your breakthrough so everything not just service days but every day we make preparation hallelujah because we are under expectation but they ran a man expectation so he sent here Noah he was expecting a terrine so he made preparations for the rain he said Oh make preparations as long as you hear courts would then make preparation for it to happen and weight under expectation or that makes me start feeling religious to think that God sent me be expecting it and if God has promised a revival here we're gonna have it let's make ready for it if God promised to heal let's make ready fit you don't have to make preparation for human kind of church say man but if I said Abraham and he started to make preparations for this child because if you're really expecting a child where do US attorney and what you have to so whenever I'm bored equilibrium and buy your toy however LC by he's showing that decision is he he really crazy is that what he were said it already believe is singular people could do one levy brambly because his life testified he believed it wrong way go this morning to the baby store where we're sitting are going after the groceries are going to the baby store I have to make up something you didn't hear our chat coming only see here I've already lost said now you know or if I'm going through way I mean when he was young for years he NCH on average have no it rammed all of us I'm gonna work when he rung a rail all and Sarah who couldn't have a child lol deported him walking around the mall happy happy happy buying baby this baby this baby this baby this yeah after year every city baby room because Abraham don't know what he egg on coming no think about it go ahead and tell him is 25 years so when he brought me here at Iran study car one time when stray 30 baby store because feet without works is dead and Abraham is the father of faith and he staggered not at the promise of God but was strong even Prince to God so when Abram I feel a feeling great you have a grab a child and we critics I will hear what you you know now after a few months Abraham could have shattered it was some of us after a few months you say Oh George I wonder if I might ask no but Abraham the next year because you don't have this is a year and hereafter you tonight this is the and yeah after yeah Abraham going you know which here and and I don't know how this is a serious thing you know because it's against human nature to maintain hope against hope because it's not as if K wrong getting younger every year and getting worse I want to think about it every year getting worse every hit harder to what he believed 20 years ago and yet 21 reach say are you ready see we're moving a little slower she did 20 years ago yeah already let me go my next story because God said we gonna have a child way to make him preparation fit but at all of a sudden when at 25 years come you see the unveiling of the manifestation of the feet and they realize it was worth it for all hallelujah was worth it all and God didn't tell us what year he was gonna fill her she didn't tell us what he is gonna call her he didn't tell us what a year he's gonna keep you to break you what he ain't gonna get your new house what ya you gonna bless you abundantly he didn't tell you that but he want you to walk and fit and trust him and keep on living and fit it's gonna be well all is well you remember that that lady whose child died and she was heading to the Prophet and they asked her what is going on the area recognized that there they breaking his speed limit and they're gonna have demerits on your license you say all is well all is well can the church say man so if God has promised a revival let's make ready for it if God has promised a here let's make ready for it Oh hallelujah if Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also let's make ready for it move out everything get ready we're right in time it'll seem foolish well you not know you say well how is gonna happen in a deal like this and when all this I don't care what anything contrary is to that it's wrong we see it I see no above it look like but if God said so let's do it anyhow because God said so it'll happen anyhow I'm expecting it can the church say ma'am so I'm on the expectation for revival so I'm making preparation for revival that's what my expectation is I'm looking for a revival I'm looking for something to move I'm looking for the spirit to move in the face of what is happening everywhere I'm on the expectation for God to do something because we have had a minister of the word for all these years and the letter killeth but the Spirit is what gives life so we're looking for life to come into my life into your life life to come to your family life to come into the church a revival disturb the season but I bands had already planted Hannah church same an old-fashioned singing old-fashioned dancing old-fashioned shelton old-fashioned prena old-fashioned praising human you old fashioned week and the church amen Oh what but I've answered every five of causes five things do you remember easier if I will bring souls to Christ bring the church back to us the spiritual condition it should be in it brings back close communion with God it brings back the fellowship among the churches it brings back praying for the sick these are the five things that are if I Bourbons are you looking for revival in the church in your life kind of Church say man but if I said that's what we need tonight in making the valley full of ditches that's what we eat and that is a good old-fashioned Blackwood's simple and sky-blue religion bleach under the power of the Holy Ghost come the church say man Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm not gonna be too much long with you or whatever if I were to revive the seeds are planted in you sow the seeds had to be planted you know the devil has no power so he can't attack with power I can't attack the power so the Devils only weapon is to try to come against the wood to try to plant seeds of error but the bride cannot be deceived God out of it all easiest situation had to come so that we'll have the right individuals who would steer we do it friends if you're not making plans with a rapture start making plans for the tribulation if you do have a plan to be rapture you need have tribulations available because this whole gospel is on a plan for us to stay in church then I plan for it to become the best churchgoer Abbess to it it's not to be the best believer you know it's a plan to leave here you don't want to be a good graduate of astronaut school what are you I am I graduated top of the class you need to be on the astronaut you need to be in the in the in the rocket you know outside the rocket taking pictures with your rocket all these years he closes you come to the rocket is a picture your pass the class we are not any rockets the goal is to leave here can the church say man Oh hallelujah hallelujah let me get ready to wind down touch the scripture that I read on a familiar Scripture but it's really a scripture of preparation of getting ready blessed be the name of the Lord and shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took the alarms I went forth to meet the bridegroom five wise and five foolish all virgins all holy all going to church all in the message all have the books all have the tapes all know the expectation all know the requirement all understand that the token is a life and I talked and supposed to be displayed and they have all these things but some were wise and some foolish all have the inspiration some inspiration some type of inspiration but some wise and some foolish all have access to the prophetic message all have access to scripture but some wise and some foolish Jesus himself Saturday debates about who is wise and who is foolish he said data for foolish talk and it took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with the alums in other words the wise made preparation there was something more that they did they were ready they did something more they put something else in please if you're going on a trip you have to make preparation I put them gas in your car you have a car we have no gas we're going doors that were foolish took their lamps with no oil it's like a start of your car and you have no gas but doors that were wise have a car but they fill it up with gas and a lot of people sit along in message churches and they think they're wise virgin we couldn't understand this mystery of the oil and this is the key of the matters but always said let's keep the main thing the main thing how books have tips have revelation have understanding of the scripture didn't know what the expectation didn't know about Rome didn't know about the plagues then nor were the files first will second but simple they have all these great knowledge and mysteries and revelations but you know what there are many Bible scholars who know all this stuff true but oil in the lamp oil in the lamp but it Branham taught us the oil represents the Holy Spirit the oil is in the church he always had a movement he always had a belief the oil isn't under a pastor that's the oil the oil is the Holy Ghost and it has to be in something can the church same and so they're different between the wise and the foolish was not what church you go into not who your pasta is not what keeps you playing church if you're playing tapes in the church and who is preaching and who is not preaching and if it's live or if it's not live or how long in the message or how long in church and what do you believe in it you really love God that's not oil how many courts you read there's only one difference the wise had oil and the foolish had no oil every Sunday people sit in church and in that church is wise and foolish because what separates our wives from the foolish is the wise are putting things in place by ensuring that they have oil in their lamps they do a little more did you little extra they're getting ready they get them prepared they don't know when they don't know how they don't know why but they get already somebody say man but I ran to the extra oil is the difference he said the difference is to token the token is a life is the fletcher's it's a Tumnus his voices it's charity because only the life can be received by the groom can the church shame and making preparations for the coming of the Lord it's not reading books that's on the preparations he's adding oil hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I said it some time ago I said co-author just what Mary teeth on the word day and night to meditate on something you have to know it before I can meditate on it so reading the word it will really grab a bit like he said you sleep or no but after you read it your meditate on it you read the prophet message and you know your meditate on what you read how is this helping me how is it supply-demand what do I need to change Lord I want to be more like your merit it you're going to pray a dm- you're here sermon tonight Lord I want the extra oil I want to have too much I would have it I want to have so much fun and I don't risk I don't want to be at risk and I just don't wanna convert Church I want to have everything I don't want to believe so many what I want to believe all it was so open no I help my unbelief take away the door perform surgery tonight in my heart I know what to measure it by my ruler I want your ruler Lord can the church say manases is this helping anybody tonight it's a reality in your workplace it's a reality in your house is a reality if nobody else wants it you want the extra oil can the church say man but at Branham in the token he said the difference between life and death was the token which are my life and death now you know because with all these plygs coming he said touch not my anointed touch that anyway the seal of God it ever was a time to make sure you have oily snow if there ever was a time to make sure that your walk is right with God it's know if there ever was a time to put the skills of life and where your life against the wood is know and see if you come up wanting hallelujah hallelujah and so will it be at the coming of the Son of God when he brings the bride out of the church heard what he said bride out of the church people believe that sitting in a message church means you are bride there's nothing to support that don't let any minister confuse you attendance in church doesn't equal private people have put their feet in men's faith and systems fit in church have hit in court have faith in court you must have the token personally displayed hallelujah but a bad sense now listen close this evening and see that isn't a token will be the difference there has got to be a difference so the only difference between the bride between the wise and the foolish would be the token you can have all the knowledge that's not the difference God is not comparing knowledge against knowledge your understanding of the sixth seal and the seventh seal endure the wars and the plays and the vials and the woman when God says the day I'm looking for the difference he said where's the oil somebody could come into the message for a war a month and have oil somebody for 30 years and have look at the Centurion he didn't grow up on another Church he didn't grow up in the temple but when he came with a knee to Jesus yes in all of Israel I haven't seen field like this unnecessary kaya no but I am your sat on a little temple for 40 years and he have no fear this Centurion has more feet in Luther's day the extra oil the difference the token of his day was the just shall live by feet those who broke out of what they were in and accepted that message apply the token for their D they did the extra for their day they invested what it took that needed to be invested to reflect what was required for that day they were prepared to meet the challenge of the oil for that day they had the extraordinary sealing but Abraham thought it was the same hole he goes in every age so Luther had enough of the Holy Ghost for justification then Wesley had were luta had passed some more there was a new difference because the season change so you couldn't go over to measure that you had from Luther's day into a CD you have to have more can the church say man the Lutheran's Wesley's message became the extra Wesley's message required more preparation more revelation a greater experience you have to know get the oil to meet the requirement because when a brand imported there was a blending in justice when John was there and Jesus was there there was a shift John is still preaching but those who saw Jesus started to follow Jesus and they were those who were still under John's ministry not realizing that the season had changed in some manner and Paul in acts 19 goes about he says unto what were you baptized hunter John's baptism because John didn't stop baptizing when Jesus came on the scene Jesus was baptized and he went on in his ministry was coming into view and John said I must so that his ministry could increase and so it was luta is fading away and then Wesley's message stripping in an extra oil there were those who would hold on to looters teaching but this is all we know this is all we have this is how it's been this is what Luther told us but there was oil that had to be put into lamps to meet the requirements of the age are you with me as we was one watch but around you as one watched feeling to the next watch doors that were alright and looters age had to make a choice to accept or reject the extra that Wesley brought it required a new level of preparation a new level of dedication it required a new level of sanctification because his message was one of sanctification the believers who will lose a church and understand the sanctification thing but no you had to be more ready more prepared more dedicated more consecrated more who so loud you have to give up more things because there was no oil required can the church same and anybody with me tonight I'm almost finished then the Pentecostal scheme and the gifts were restored and tongues and these things it was more extra another level another requirement another level of preparation another level of dedication and it's a blending in and in the height of the Pentecostals as they're exploding here comes a little profit brings the food the full light every mystery revealed and in the fullness of the world now requires a fullness of dedication a fullness of surrender a fullness of the spirit of match the fullness of the word because when a Branham taught that from that first age until the prophetic age told the conductor the wood had been lost and the power that should have been flora to the church curdled Florida way it was supposed to but when it's little 20th century Kentucky prophet began to preach here see the discrepancy serpent see the citizen air with the shocker adoption beginner pull these little things together and slowly slowly under the devil's eyes the devil announced how what is going on he was gathering here from Genesis from revelation pulling the pieces together try to catch the attention of a people catch the attention of virgins as it were but within their wise and foolish they were those who see the man who see the gifts who see what he performed and those who are listen to the words because I recognize is not even by the Branham he's pointing to Jesus it's about Jesus Malachi 4 introduced to talk on the life of Jesus Christ once twenty-five is five musicians get ready while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept while God has been preparing because the bridegroom went to prepare with Alma making preparations for the coming of the Lord while God is preparing they all slumbered and slept two different words slumber and slept and not the same wherever I'm type it out slap fall asleep slumbers waiting almost dozing as it were different sleeping already did but a Branham brother tapped the bride from the Seven Cities are sleeping but slumber means dormant inactive not moving waiting for something so it must mean the Living bride is slumbering slumbering in the message with books and tips slumbering in the message with the power because the word is power no wonder the prophecy it takes something to to give the bride seat so it's a week off some of us still into action can the church amen oh the tearing Christ suppose arise we who are alive we who are slumbering that's why but it Branham seven people fight the score the bride has done had a revival yet see there's been no revival there no manifestation of God stir the bride we are looking for it it'll take those seven unknown tunnels back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it I'm under expectation for it I'm making preparations it I'm almost finished in other words a manifestation of behold the bridegroom comment will be seven thunders uttering their voices I'm trimming time because at the midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him Oh hallelujah seven angels come down from eternity the bridegroom is coming into view surrounded by his entourage along the journey in the air to scream out in every age it was one message behold the bridegroom cometh but the last messenger screaming out his soft message coming closer not seeing the the prophet coming the prophet has already come but tonight behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him behold the bridegroom cometh signals the end of preparation because after preparation you either ready or not ready when the examination comes after form five you have five years to prepare when he exam hits the front of your table you have no more time to prepare you can only put down a people what you know is either already or you're not ready behold the bridegroom cometh last message screaming out signals the end of preparation signals it's time to go signals it's time to show so what you have to prove so what you have earned sure your approval that God himself has identified with you now do you identify with him but now he has put his seal his stamp of approval to say I am identified with him identified with her yes my spirit through him free I'm in control of this one I'm in control of that one come to church amen proving your preparation has been right proving your efforts have been right proving your Labour's have not been in vain moving your sacrifice and your coming to church has that built for nothing by giving you a seal a sign given you a stamp well done my good and faithful servant you have fought a good fight you have kept defeat can the church see man the clock is ticking that scream is going out behold the bridegroom cometh there's only seconds left friends these plagues are not something that is a once in a time thing it's it's coming the world is men's hats feeling for fear in that deal look up your Redemption draweth nigh not look to the doctor not look to the mask not look to that is this and this world is finished they could cry save the planet how much sieve they want see the environment how much you want this enzyme is gonna burn because there was a purifier please sons and daughters to move to the land can the church say Amen then all the fruit in the rose and trimmed their lamps trim the excess trim the excess tonight trim the lamps is cut everything out tonight that will cause your life to not burn as bright as it should lamb trimming time I know it's a message you know but it's a shaking time it's a reminder tonight that they always leave any day now because coral not allow his righteous to perish with the wicked that's why he's having rapture to pull them out before he brings judgment because he has warned and warned and warned and warned because he can never bring judgment but our first bring and warning this message is a message of warning and judgment to see what you do with this word because how you handless what is a measure of your character and your understanding of the need to be prepared can the church say Amen trim the excess all the virgins so listen carefully wise and foolish trimming accessor it's coming up so close race I'm almost finished all all the food in the world but occurrence all trimmed their lamps all cut off things from the world all trim the excess oil making an effort it's a real effort they're not playing Church they want to be right and look around the land and they're people who love God they'll love the message and love the word doing the best he could but that's not the question is there oil in your lamp and it's after the trimming it's only after the trimming the question comes the foolish said to the wise give us of your oil because in the act of trimming in the act of cutting away what should not be there it allows you to look back at your life and reconsider have I done all I should do to make this rupture have I done everything I should do to make this cut and in cotton you realize you don't even when you take time to look in the mirror of the word and you said to realize I'm short of something I'm Maria I'm missing something after 30 years in a message I have knowledge but have no oil I've information but no oil I have revelation got no oil and no mysteries and I don't have oil I know history and I have no oil I know where God brought us from but I have no oil and no bride history but I have no oil I'm living right I've trimmed and I have no oil I have a desire to serve God but I have no oil but Iban said he shakes at the D way young people come to the altar and they pray but across the line in other words it's too late no salvation left for them because the cry has gone out there's no more time to prepare the foolish said to the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are borne out what little they had listen carefully they had something but it didn't have enough because what they had went out so it's not that they didn't have or they never had something you know they didn't have enough have you done enough but the Branum scream that have I done enough have you done have we done enough but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough the issue becomes enough for us and for you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and why they want to buy what is this painful because this shows friends the desire to do right this is not these people want to go into the world they're not trying to go and drink and smoke and party they're looking now for oil but it's actually too late they now catch a revelation of what they should have been doing all along except that they caught the revelation too late because they were comfortable being virgins comfortable having what they thought was enough and not realizing that there was more preparation that was required and that this preparation should have been happening but was not happening maybe they were too busy maybe they were too busy I'm challenging us I'm challenging me I'm telling you tonight while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that already went in are you ready tonight went with him to the marriage and the door was shut did that already be that already and afterward came all to the other food is in Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not all your years in the message and the pain you get for it is I know you not because you did not pass the exam that was required what's there for watch therefore is a this is a warning now about being vigilant about being on point about being ready about not ever getting slack about not ever getting comfortable watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh foolish version those that truly believe that they have what it takes they believe that they're going to make it but when the call goes out they realize you don't have enough they had oil they had something but it did not have extra
