time you may have your seeds just once more as we have a special greeting may god bless you [Music] greetings to the convention and god bless you all it's certainly a great privilege and an honor to be able to speak to the purchase of the blood of jesus christ and i know that you have been blessed thus far with the convention and we are so happy to be able to come together in this way and at this time around this great inspiration of preparation for the battle you know and no doubt you would have heard it echoed through the different services and here we are again tonight for another round or today depending on what time zone you're in to spend time in the presence of the lord and this thought of preparing for the battle is such a blessing to me because so many of us we could look back and speak about the battles that we have had and here we are speaking about preparing for more battles you know and and that's the way it is because there's a great coming together for a great final battle for a great final climax you know so god bless you to all of the ministers all of the churches all of the brothers who have greeted those from far and wide those who are connected live those who would hear it on the on the different connections we certainly appreciate you being a part of this and i'm here tonight just to say a few words before our speaker because he's going to be speaking to us and many of us would may not have heard him before but i know he's going to be a blessing to you he's an inspiration to me and you know i really want to encourage the young people um with this because so many times you try to maintain a balance you know with your spiritual testimony and being able to maintain that testimony in your job in your school in your home and it is not an easy thing but it is possible you know so i want to really encourage you that there's also a battle that's raging on your job in your home in your daily life and you also have to prepare for that battle and it's an encouraging thing when we can see people who are able to maintain a christian walk uh both within the church and outside of the church and you know tonight we felt led to invite our precious brother cosmos maduka to speak to us in this convention you know and for those who don't know him he you know is based in brother oluse church in nigeria and he's such an inspiration i remember being very young i think it was in 1996 i would have first met brother cosmos and over the years gotten to know him better and better and it was in enugu 2015 i had the opportunity to speak share service with him dedicated to the young people and brother maduka has a real testimony he has been very successful in life and in business and what is most notable about it is he has maintained his walk with the lord and that i have seen been a real challenge for many young and old the moment they begin to experience some level of success in the natural their walk with the lord becomes threatened but not by the meduka he has maintained a testimony he has maintained a level of humility in his worship in the way he conducts his affairs and it is not something that he was born with or entitled to it is something that he worked hard at both his natural and his spiritual work you know he was born into poverty and at a very early age around six years or so when he was six years old his father would have passed away and he would have had to leave school to be able to help with the family and failure after failure and battle after battle you know he was selling on the street and so many different things as part of his testimony and then he met the lord in his early teenage years and in that process he met this message of the hour that has been an anchor for him both in the spiritual and also in the natural as well and he has been able by the grace of the lord and only with the lord's help to successfully combine high-stakes business with an equally committed christian life for decades his is not a testimony of one year or two years but year after year being able to be present both in business and still not compromise this truth of this great message of the hour and i believe that he is going to be able to share something with us and be able to bless us in a way that i trust that you will be very receptive and responsive to the word as he brings it as he brings it from a very seasoned experience perspective that will be a resounding blessing to us so we are so happy that he accepted the invitation to speak to us and join us in welcoming him to the pulpit as he brings the word tonight so brother maduka may god richly bless you brother thank you for sharing uh this with us and may the lord richly bless you oh it's an honor and a real privilege for me to be called upon by god's servant and precious brother jovid and the trinidad headstone ministry to put my shoulder to the wheel and say a few things to the bride of christ around the world and what a blessing it has been for me you know i i feel really small humble to be standing in this position of responsibility because um you know it takes the grace of god i am nervous and i ask you to pray for me this morning i'm trusting god that he will speak to us that's why i sing that song you know i want to thank other ministers that have gone ahead of me or those coming behind me who it fell on their lord to be able to bring a message to praise the bride of christ the theme for this convention is preparation for battle hallelujah why yes you got to get ready because there's a battle coming on i've taken a title to support this team and my title is preparation time hallelujah you gotta get ready there's something you gotta do because you don't want the battle to take you unaware if you do not prepare it will take you unaware [Music] my inspiration for this myth for this message is um take responsibility hallelujah got to take responsibility we are living in an age where many people refuse to take responsibility we are going to get to it my subject is power of planning and the change hallelujah don't look at me like srimana you've got to respond to the holy spirit hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah oh if you never feel important begin to feel it this morning there can never be another you after god made you he broke the world hallelujah amen that's how spiritual you are that can never be another you that's why the devil is crazy he wants to have you but he cannot have you because this bride is not like this he can never have you he can only he can never have you no matter how he try he can never have you hallelujah you belong to jesus you are married to jesus he is your husband it's your lord it's your all and all you can never be shared hallelujah let the devil get mad oh glory glory glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen thank you oh hallelujah amen are you ready for me i'm ready for you get your bible let's get to business hallelujah amen oh hallelujah oh i love the theme of this convention preparation for the battle this team is from god god knew what he's doing he brought it for this hour let me start with a quote june 5th june um may 1916 adoption platform bless us now as we approach the world and further down know us the reason that i'm approaching the word from this scripture here it's because that i feel that you want me to do it that way it's your divine will it's your is in your order as the brother said in his prayer to you not long ago oh you have trained us so long lord now father give us our give us our rank put us out there oh god what you are support what we are supposed to do so we can be about our father's business for we ask it in jesus name hallelujah it's about our father's business hallelujah are you in your father's business jesus said i must be about my father's business some people didn't like it but i told them that jesus is a businessman oh you didn't believe very good businessman but it depends on whatever business you are into he's in the business of saving soul hallelujah i'm not adding into the scripture a scripture that i must be about my father's business and if you're a businessman you better listen to this man because he will teach you how to do business hallelujah amen whatever you are doing he took five ordinary people non-entities some of them don't know their abcd like me they only know how to get a god out of a fish but people who are willing for transformational leadership he took them both their crudeness began to refine them hallelujah to change the world hallelujah amen he took them out to a training one day at the back side in the wilderness you know it was becoming evening have some a lot of people that followed you know his customers we are there but this man knows how to attend to customers you know a good businessman what did they do when it was becoming ability to get them to eat these natural people that only their mind is what you don't only occupy them they can't see beyond their nose they have no revelation jesus said give them to you and they say oh why are you talking like this master we're in the wilderness there's nothing here except one boy with his lunch box he said what is he saying has only two fishes and five percent bring it he looked up and thanked the person who who brought it gave glory to god committed it to god and jesus began his business administration you know he can share that bread but he wanted to teach you and me delegation he gave it to his disciples and said give them to eat hallelujah but before he get them to eat he did something he taught us administration he said sit them down in 40s in 60s and 100 because he knew they are going to be counted listen his teaching skill move into action right away customers how to manage customers how to administer the business how to dedicate hallelujah and they begin to give them to eat and they were eating after they ate the lord of croatia who created heaven and earth who took only five loafs of bread and two fishes to feed five thousand he said pick the crop on the ground financial management let nothing be wasted pitch whatever is on the ground hallelujah whatever drop on the ground get it people ask me which school did i go when joseph told pharaoh what to do fellow knew that this knowledge did not come from the university of egypt hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah because the field has always been there all of those things has always been there but there is when you are connected when you have an intimacy you will be hearing from heaven you'll be seeing where other people are not saying hallelujah [Applause] amen he said pick the clubs on the ground listen friends if you treat your customers very well you don't need to look for them they will look for you the following day jesus went his way the people looked for him they didn't see him they jumped inside the boat today this is him the wrong job they didn't where is he going they jumped and met him to the other side oh master hey hey we've been looking for you this morning jesus said can you sit down let's give you a test and know whether it's handout you are looking for or you want to regeneration hallelujah whatever you claim has to be tested he wanted to know what are these people looking for he said you've been looking for me why please be honest tell me they were hesitating to answer for them you are not looking for me because of the things i told you you had free lunch you ate bread and fish and you are looking for another one it's not what this thing is called for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink it is righteousness in the holy spirit come here because of handouts don't come here because you want to be a millionaire come here because you love god you want to serve him you want to live for him whatever he will do out of you let him feel your heart what is what devoting you hallelujah he gave him a test of the world you must eat my flesh and drink my blood they said this is a heart saying this man wants us to completely depend upon him bible say from that day they left and they never followed him anymore a real pastor is not motivated by crowd though all these churches were there thinking that when people are too many then you know the holy ghost is there it's not true jesus taunted the remaining 12 and say are you like the other people won't you also go away what are you doing here hallelujah prophet told us that the true pastor is suspicious he's a shepherd he shall spread every out of your move to know whether your motive is right he said i want to go away and then we are looking is it if you are like other people please go the prophet said the only person i don't want to leave is the holy spirit any other person can go when he threw that challenge upon them they were looking and he said let me tell you now we don't have any bread to give you anymore now you are going to eat my flesh we need to know how sincere you are there is no coca-cola or seven or for fanta to drink my blood is the drinking deed wow and peter made that memorable statement who can hear this but lord where can we go only you have a word of internal life [Applause] you need to be sure what you need what is motivating you are you in this for real or you want to be a millionaire is it the julian that is motivating you some people go to church only to get visa to go to abroad you miss the call hallelujah what is what is it peter said where else can we go listen the best business in peter years is fisher being a fisherman is the best business in their village so peter owned a fishing company for those of you who think that god called you to be an entity no peter was doing well with his brother they owned a fishing business hallelujah peter said we've done very well in our business we've got customers and our business is growing but you've even taught us how to increase it more we've learned more from you not only catch fish but catch human beings hallelujah when you come to the lord he will take whatever you are clean it up magnified it give it back to you hallelujah then they finished they thought it was all over he said i choose you 12. they refused to go but one of you said devil he he threw them into confusion so special statement everybody begin to look at each other who is this devil why don't you tell us exactly who the devil was but he said one of you said devil hallelujah this message is tiptoe no message he keeps you on your toes 24 7 so you can always check up with your source as a version something i said sometimes on purpose to keep you on your toes they were standing looking judas was one of them and you thought that the jesus the lord did not know judas he knew him he knew he was a thief and he still made him threaten off his church the man stole money from the church until that morning the mundane little bit decided to serve the master himself [Music] hallelujah we are in for business this morning let us get your scripture revelation chapter 12. revelation chapter 12 verse 7 to 9. and there was a war in heaven hallelujah michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angel and prevailed not neither was there a place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil and satan which decided the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him let's hear the prophet the greatest battle ever fought 1962 march 11 paragraph 60 and so an army first in getting ready for a battle please you may be seated sorry to give you standing i'm so sorry amen first there got to be a select as selection some soldiers they got to be dressed for fighting that means you got to wear the government for war you don't wear baby girl to do this battle amen some people don't know what is the bangladega we call it parachute the kind of african dress they have big wing they got to be trained for fighting and i believe the greatest battle that was ever fought is now ready to go in action i believe that god has been selecting his soldiers this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when my call and his angel fought against lucifer and his angel it started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on the earth it originated in heaven paragraph 63 and then it was shown thrown down from heaven and cast out from heaven to the earth and it fell on human beings then the battle from the angel became human battles and satan came to destroy god's creation what god has created to be for himself god did not create you to be for yourself god created you to be for himself hallelujah that's why satan is jealous he heard satan attempt to destroy this it is it is the order of the day to let the people positionally find their place and be ready for the hour of battle i believe he's been dressing them training them and the battle is the battle front is now set getting ready to start that's what the purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and began in us and had been raging ever since so stop wondering why are you having mine battle the battle became urban battle and they started not it's no more in heaven elijah and elijah 1954 march 4. frankly you don't have to come up here you just have to have faith where you are sitting god takes care of the rest doesn't he and i say he does amen you prayed for me tonight the prophet said and i said this morning i am the one who really needs prayer not for sickness i am very thankful for that but i need prayer while i'm trying to minister to the others if you just realize what an opposition there is when you spiritual power that encloses around a person when you are speaking of christ and especially in a way of bringing the world or making the world manifest to the people that's the thing when the world is big when they when the world just preaching the world hallelujah amen time tested first 1958 may 13 no man has the right to take the pulpit to preach the gospel unless he has been in the backside of the desert no man no person has the right to call themselves christians it's not only made for the preacher no man has the right to call himself a christian until he has a backside of the desert experience it is still the backside of the desert we call upper room but it is still the back side of the desert too is where you meet god god call man 1958 and before you can have this revival god has to call out man god has to call out and train men god trained men to carry this message they don't care what the opposition is they are willing to go to the fire furnace in defeat or in the lion's den or whatever it may be they are ready to go because they have been in the presence of god that's why i tell you we need this presence we can't go without his presence they have been in the presence of god and know that he is whether it is perfect whether it's to victory or defeat they still stand the same that's the kind of training god does to a man and that is very strange to think that god will do that that god's strength his men like that what he does hallelujah you know we have an old song that we sing some through the water some through the flood summed through debt trials but all through the blood hallelujah god leads his people through great trials to punch them sometimes it takes years to do that because you are never promoted until you are overqualified hallelujah god never takes you to another level you got to be over-qualified when is training you the children of israel was 40 days journey but they missed it and 40 days become 40 years the prophet says sometimes it takes years but god is waiting whether you learn the lesson let me read it again hallelujah god leads his people through great trials to push them sometimes it takes years to do it and as for myself tonight i believe that's right now god is training such men to meet the front line men who are going through and time shook off their feet sometimes it looks like the whole thing is falling but yet in the midst of it all they know that they are leaving god they keep their face forward they keep moving hallelujah sometimes it looks like the whole thing is falling but you don't sit down and complain they look forward and keep moving hallelujah that's the training god is taking us through by your head again let us pray our father we are about to walk into a new beginning oh dear god father there's something that is loaded like a gun in my heart this morning i pray almighty god some of us had a hard time last year i tried us i did myself i lost my wife i lost my only dear one that i called my day it's really hard it was rough it was tough last year was but there is a new beginning church hallelujah somebody screamed it is a new beginning scream scream come on somebody hallelujah god be praised for renewal it is going to be this year is going to be the best year ever i said this is a new beginning thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you lord for this new beginning you have been training us all these years we have received the trend now we are ready to move forward to possess everything the enemy has taken from us hallelujah church there is a scripture here i want you to think all throughout this message it is found in the book of proverbs 16 verse 3 it says commit to the lord whatsoever you plan to do and your plan will succeed wow whatever whatever you plan to do commit it to the lord i need to succeed god built success in everything that he created if the thing god created did not succeed god's reputation is at stake then he said the way to describe his name's sake is not for you but for god's name's sake the manufacturers make a product to succeed they don't put their name on a product if they are not convinced that product will succeed hallelujah because if the product fell their reputation is wrong hallelujah god couldn't put his name upon you if he has not built you for a success hallelujah amen listen it's not about looking outside everything you need is in you when it finishes you in genesis we say you were beautiful everything is there the three of the three the drunk the leaf the fruit is in the city hallelujah the seed is in you everything you need to become who you need to be is already planted in you amen welcome to the second half of the year of change glory hallelujah you can write it down that i said that we are in a year of exchange it means starting our flesh oh i like that one and i claim it for myself god says no matter what happened after this point this year you are going to start afresh let somebody begin to catch faith now oh i received that for myself god is going to give you a fresh start do you believe that do you believe that god is going to give you a flesh that do you believe that that means sickness is going to be history no matter what condition you are in it right now pain is going to be in the past it's all over can i hear amen on that confusion is going away losing has become a history frustration is going to go away they will not rise affliction for the second time hallelujah [Applause] affliction will not rise to second time it's all over if there is anything that is less than wonderful in your life it is finished by the revelation of my faith i prophesy is over you are going to start flesh it means completely new face of your life i'm about to speak in tongue now oh help me god oh help me lord to keep

permanent in jesus name repentance and prayer and fasting must come before restoration ii chronicles 7 14 if my people which are called by my name will humble themselves and pray i will hear from heaven and heal forgive their sins and i will heal their land prayer and fasting open the way for forgiveness blessing and resurrection if we are going to claim the promises and blessing of god for restoration and an outpouring of his spirit we must fulfill the condition god set forth there must be first a brokenness humbling breaking our spiritual pride and self-righteousness through fasting and prayer someone 103 verse 7 he made known his way to moses but his heart to the children of israel the children of israel wanted the power of god that's what is going on today in church people are looking for signs and wonder jump from one church to another looking for it but that was not moses preoccupation moses preoccupation is to know the mind of god when you know the mind of god you know the way of god and when you know the word of god everything will line up the children of israel know the power of god but moses is not the mind of god the word of god it is not about the hand of god his power but the mind of god that god sent to us in this age through his prophet messenger to develop intimacy of a relationship many of us christians today still look on the surface the outward manifestation of god's power as an indicator or sign of great heartburn god has promised however the real sign will be when i close the nations of the earth the people of god begin to fall on their faces before god to repent to confess their sins before god and come one another begin to turn from their sins that we have allowed to come into the church another major indicator of this great outpouring of the holy spirit would be a major move of christians from different churches around the unit around the different churches towards unity in the spirit when we begin see christians leaders coming together in new unity you will know it is a sign for the great outpouring god has promised at this end time after god's people begin to fast and pray then we lie here and heal them be jealous for their land and pity the people 12-28 after god's people have begin to weep among and repent will come a time of great rejoicing for the lord will do great things 12-21 after god's people begin to fast and pray and repent then will heaven open and god will pour out the former and later land the holy spirit will pour out upon all flesh 12-23-28 after god's people humble themselves through time of fasting and prayer then will come the promise of restoration god will restore all things satan has stolen then we will come to an abundance then god's people will be satisfied 12-24-27 amen what are the circumstances that we are facing now are there situations in your life which you must hear from god which you just don't know what to do even how to pray don't be willing pick up your weapon fight pick up the weapon of your prayer and fast fasting my advice is what we have seen what is going on today is what the prophet told us in 1962 july 22nd a message titled show us the father and it will suffice us the prophet said and when we take the promise we take the promise every promise we find here drop in our heart we keep watering it when you water it it will carry weight and they will drop inside your soul hallelujah keep watering it it keeps pushing out hallelujah when christ is planted in our heart the holy ghost the only thing to do is drink that's why we come to drink this morning at that great day the great day of the feast jesus christ if anyone does is anybody testing this morning come unto me to drink it's not a well a bubble bible say out of him shall flow it has current rivers of the living water it will wash out the crash it will push out salvation it will push out divine healing it will push out glory it will push out everything that we have need of right in us when we are planted in christ thus says the prophet you alive at the are you at the point in your life that it seems that heaven is at blast that god has forgotten you that he has not had your cry for help do not give up it's not the time to surrender do not listen to certain lies because it's the father of lie pick up your weapon of prayer and fasting use them fight back take your victory is there a growing hunger in your heart to know christ in all his fullness and be conformed to his image to draw into a closer relationship with him pick up your weapon of prayer and fasting and use them i am a great believer that there is nothing like a self-made person you can make yourself if god do not make you no self-made man or self-made woman but we must be willing to fight back to take what god has promised us genesis 1 26-28 be fruitful it's a command on your potential be is an active vibe it has a command you have a potential god is saying i put something in you bring it out let's live in obedient i say therefore that we have all things that we require to be a great christian in this last day to create another world around us like little really push don't give up push like joshua we have to fight because we have been prepared by the world to take the battle the prophet advice and believers thou this june 4. i am in the vine ye are the branches if a grape vine put forth a shot it comes out with pretty blue grapes the next vine it brings out will be pretty blue grapes on it if the first vine come out and it falls under the impact of the holy spirit and they did great miracles and signs and sealed their testimony to the world even many of them with their own testimony with their own blood they sealed their testimony then went through all kind of pearls and everything to bring the gospel they suffered they were beaten they were punished must we carry home to heaven on a flat bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and seal their blood and and sell through the bloody stream what do we do the prophet i ask what do we do i must fight i must reign increase my courage lord that's the prophet prayer we don't need a new denomination certainly not we don't need a new church building what we need today is an old blackwood sin blue sin killing pentecostal revival that was born at pentecost and that is back to the church again the power of the holy ghost again to bring jesus christ on the scene hallelujah you can never enter into a future church that you did not create because you're a little creator you don't need you you never walk into success by accident you can't live by luck it's not your promise there's a promise that you live in in the spiritual international they will take in principle of intentional living you have to be persistent passionate about your future because a passion is the fuel to the will whenever a man or a woman is passionate about the things you want to accomplish you will find the willpower to do it amen 1957 august 21 hebrew chapter one i say that's the only way you can do it right kind that you can do the right kind of a job for the lord is put everything you got right in the front room in the front fort for christ all your strength all your soul all your heart all your mind everything that you got when you are doing anything do it right or don't do it at all see just leave it alone if you are not going to be a christian if you if you are going to be a christian put everything that you got to christ that's your time your parents your everything please don't please don't that fate okay i think i finished the quote unquote please note that faith is awakening of our consciousness and deliberate effort which helps you to see the end of your journey even though you may not know all the route that was going to take you there but visualizing the end of the journey you have a compass to see what collaborate with your faith and the other things that you need to cut off in your life now let me begin to wind down on the power of preparation and change i want to focus in a few minutes on understanding the principle of planning preparation and planning and preparation and how if that relates to strategic thinking i'm talking to young people around the world not only here you don't just say i want to be a doctor you're an elective thinking click in how how you don't become because you say i want to how then that american thing can begin to tell you you need some science subject and you know what they are it doesn't mean you have it but you begin to walk towards it this is the way it happens spiritual i want to be like jesus how let's say now a village a market that is very close to church and all these denominational church members go to the market behave like the way they leak and the madman was watching them and they would go back to the church and they start reading apostles creed i believe in father i believe in god the only true father the one man who said by the window said form out i believe in the only true god the one who said form out will push him out they come back whatever they say the man will be saying from out you don't become from out hallelujah amen we got young people here today what plan do you have for your life don't forget my area scripture found in the book of proverbs 163 it says commit to the lord whatever you plan and it will succeed amen it's a promise to it young people listen to me you are very important to me and you are very important to this generation i am passionate about your future if you are below the age of 25 you are very important for next year if you are between the age of 15 and 30 i want you to bless up for a massive change if you are over 40 you are going to learn that the things you thought that were important the things you thought that were important though we are settled they are going to be shaken not in a negative way but in a positive way all we need to do is to follow us the message that god has sent to us to walk in the footsteps of jesus christ and embrace the cross despising the shame he went ahead to purchase us redemption for that is what the purpose is your life is not an experiment god is not about experimenting with your life god wouldn't have bring you if he had not finished you hallelujah but you've got to fight turn to your neighbor and say i am a finnish product tune to your neighbor and say i am on my way to be finished hallelujah i'm on my way to finish you are on your way brothers because that is what the purpose is everybody say purpose listen to me we don't have much time on this planet we have got a lot of work to do and we have to get millions of people here or billions of people around the world that we need to touch we have no time to continue to fumble the ball not anymore time wasted is over god in this meeting is demanding that the church stop being busy and start being effective the only way to be effective is to know the assignment it is sad to be taking exam that nobody said for you it is terrible to be successful in the wrong term it is a tragedy to win a race that we never asked to run fighting each other complaining about what is going wrong in your life without doing anything about it my concern is if a man or a woman does not know what he or she look for any wind will be the right one a man without a purpose is like a ship without a radar he just kept drifting drifting drifting though we are not distracted with that's why we are not distracted about what is going on don't waste your time with it we have a challenging message to follow we have something to preoccupy us don't let the devil give you another job and get you distracted let me tell you something friends if you don't know your purpose someone is going to give you dears if you don't know why where you are going any road will take you there the tragedy is that you wouldn't even know when you arrived god's goal in this season is maturity god is getting us ready for maturity as a matter of fact he's demanding it now it's been since 1956 or 1666 years it happened 55 or 60 years ago malachi 4 left this age if you take time to do a little examination about the church it's not something that is too exciting i mean the church world in the last 60 years had had had an opportunity i've had an opportunity to do take this review and we've seen a bunch of excited group of people with no depth we got great anointing without character we got tremendous gifts with our standards we got power without principle we are flashy yet we don't have faith we got great posters and invite people for a meeting but fail to invite the presence of god we have a church that has become expert in setting up meetings but have difficulties meeting with god what god is demanding in this season is for us to take the diapers off hallelujah we can we upon pass at the age where we are listening to bully abraham paradigm 1963 why this church ought to be a minimize up the road to where it is now jesus is waiting on the church to get ready the bride has made herself ready we've got the potential the holy spirit is here god is here the power to heal the sick the power to do things that christ did i have been i have seen it demonstrated myself by the holy spirit so the potential is here thus says the prophet he wants us to get rid of dampers powdered milk he is demanding that we act of age church the church should be fully grown to go and meet christ says the prophet i mean the church is almost 2000 years old and still gossiping by biting competing jerusalem one another 2 000 years old we are still hating one another comparing ourselves with each other as a matter of fact we are still prejudiced we still get all kind of internal jealousy and by biting it is horrible as a matter of fact the church is still in adolescent she had no breasts you didn't hear me i said the church is like a little girl she has no breasts the church word jesus isn't going to marry a little girl hallelujah church let's hear the prophet 1957.17 the second coming of the lord so it is getting along towards the dark when she realized that she had lost everything time for her husband to come and is getting late the church better be examined has their serves by the word of god our purity our royalty our devotion will be contactless pelvis cigarette smoker by painted jezebel everything in the calendar that the rest of the world does the church is associated with those things today the church is associated with those things today till you can hardly tell one from the other it is time we take eventually it's getting late i'm going to tell you right now church unquote now god is demanding that we grow up church to the stature of a perfect man growing up means responsibility i'm getting to my inspiration now let somebody say take responsibility say it with me responsibility say it out responsibility a little louder responsibility one more time responsibility just a little louder that's what god is looking for church nothing is as desert nothing is as destructive as irresponsibility the most advised characteristic that beg our society worldwide today is that of irresponsibility irresponsibility is defined as not answerable to authority young people listen now lacking a sense of accountability unable to respond to conscience it also means flick filthy thoughtless rash undefendable unstable loose well a lot of charismatics are loose irresponsible people it means lack it means immoral people who worship on sunday morning and go out sleeping around on sunday night that's what is called loose irresponsible people we got a bunch in the church who are singing right now in the choir speaking in tongues and i mean be honest with you many cases i don't doubt their salvation just that they are irresponsible it also means on it also means unpredictable that's one of the things that responsibility means you can't predict them you don't know when they are going to stop out of the church the next time they are going to do that they don't care they are not answerable to anybody when they are going to leave the church no commitment to nobody no commitment to any vision they are irresponsible people it also means wild only liable untrustworthy i like this one it also means blame us let's hear the prophet again on the second coming of the lord let's read this prophet again oh if there was a time the church ought to take inventory to find out if she had got all the coin in it should be now is getting back the very is getting dark the very hunt and crowd of destruction destroying civilization is hanging on the earth same and they bought the bush on every every hand we are living in a tremendous time when there is wickedness wickedness people who go to church just for a chance people who go to church to try to hide from their meanness people who go to church and profess christianity and live like the rest of the world drinking smoking gambling some of them are in this you may be in this church playing nigel betty nigel you want to get money by praying lottery it's an evil spirit let me nail that down hallelujah drinking smoking gambling women immoral dress wearing clothes they ought not to wear in their dressing room out on the street before public broader love is a thing that's passing almost we have not lost one coin the prophet said we have practically lost every one of them and it was getting night remember her husband will return and if she finds one of this coin out it will show she has been marked a lot to be irresponsible means to transfer blame for your behavior to somebody else we have to fight to become responsible the entire world is suffering from this destructive influence of irresponsibility no one wants to take responsibility for their actions their decisions their situations their circumstances we become experts in blaming the past for our future we blame our teachers for we blame our parents for our bad habits we blame our teachers for our ignorance we blame our leaders for the way we follow them we blame sickness for our health we blame our children for our social problem they are our children we blame cigarette and tobacco campaign for our cancer we blame the government for our unemployment because we cannot find ingenuity within ourselves to be productive then the whole nation is suffering from poverty you get a brain between your head and neck with five billion cells you haven't used 10 percent of it there's something you can do with your hands that you don't need the government to give you a job tell your neighbour maximize yourself tell your neighbor deploy yourself say it again deploy yourself you see if you don't deploy yourself somebody else is going to deploy you and whichever employee will determine your what what you are paid i've decided many years ago that nobody can pay my watch so we blame the government for our unemployment we blame alcohol for our drunkenness we blame our wife for our worthiness we blame our husband for our depression the black man blamed the white man for his predicament the white man blamed the black man for his predicament the poor blame the rich for their before their poverty and we live in a irresponsible generator generation we have a generation who believe that life owed them everything and everything a generation who refused to take personal responsibility for their own decision and action you better listen to me today young people irresponsibility is abandonment of conscience is ignorance of accountability let let us hear the prophet again 1957. the second coming of the lord so it is getting along towards dark she realized that she has not lost that she has lost every 10. her husband is coming he's getting late the church better examine themselves by the word of god again our purity our loyalty our devotion we become partners but bite us the great smokers by biting each other painted jezebel everything in the coriander that the rest of the world does the christian church is associated in those things today till you can hardly tell one from the other it is getting left church we take inventory it's getting late now it was late till she had to light the candle she got the candle not only did she get the candle she got the bloom she went to a house cleaning time oh brothers if there have been a need for a time of lighting they can do the sending thought of the gospel light the holy ghost back in the church not so much of emotion not so much of fantastic not for emotional work up not for jump for joy but for a hard searching experience when men and women get right with god right we are at the end time paragraph 66 she lit the candle to give her light brother every candle every little candle in here or to be lit tonight not only that but she got the bloom the neighbors could see the dust flying oh i remember this quote in the article but i'm aware they did very repeatedly until many of us actually look for even natural i can do to write hallelujah we've got to wake up again not only she got the bloom and the neighbors could see the dust flying why do you care when you make your life right she had a real house cleaning time for her husband she was about to come and if she caught her with one of that coin out she smacked a halot brother we the church of the living god in this great hour that we are in living it behooves us to check up to go before god write the candle of the word of the gospel and examine ourselves and find out if we are falling short especially when we see all these things coming we are the end times the coming of christ is at hand there is no another hope for the for the for the wall or for the church paragraph 68. she took the church and she took the church is roaring the church has no conscience no more you can hardly wake her up the bible says they will come in that condition when they say low our lord delays is coming and they will be devoting and beating one another and so forth fighting around it is it's just exactly that hour everything is ready the break is done the pledge is stormed as it was like in that time as it was that time and it is ready the coming of the lord the lutheran church lost her light the methodist church lost her light the pentecostal church lost her light the church lost her light every light seems to be gone the pentecostal people the holiness people is acting just like the methodist the methodist is acting like the baptist the baptist is acting like the lieutenant the lutheran is acting like the catholic and is gone back to one great big conglomeration of sin that's right we are at the end time the coming of the lord now she had a house cleaning time she scrubbed the floor she swept the wall she took down the cobwebs she keep on until she find what she has lost and when prophecy hallelujah we are 700 believers the prophet switched to prophecy when she where am i and when she did she uh okay let me repeat it now she had a house cleaning time she's cropped the floor she swept the wall she took down the cobweb she kept on until she find what she has lost and when she did she called her little sister churches to come now hallelujah i don't care if you are methodist baptist pentecostal presbyterian come let us rejoice together when that time come future when the church finds his brother in love when the church finds his holy decency when the church finds his place in christ it calls to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us god wants his church to love him i'm winding down now to violate on quote to violence to worship is to be irresponsible so the criminals blame the society for his misbehavior it is not surprising we heard about a case in united states of america a guy that killed another guy and went to court and plead that the society made him that way that's the society we are living on it a young man that the community brought him up in a certain way and that's why he shot him now friends when you have transferred your behavior to the society that we live we are in trouble it also means we are not yet ready for the battle that is going on now we are a society of blamers the sinner blamed the hypocrite preacher for his domination see some young people say i don't come to that church again you people are a bunch of hypocrites please why not come and help us we need you we need your help you that is not hypocrites we need you please come we don't want you to go sinner blame hypocritical preachers for his domination think about that first of all i am not coming to church why those preachers are not good rather go to church for yourself don't worry about the preacher stop transforming your irresponsibility on another preacher the bible says work out your own salvation if the preacher wants to mess up let him mess up he says business with god and nothing with you but the question is where did the spirit of irresponsibility come from when did he enter the world and how did he come into our experience well we are going to find out in a few minutes and i'm closing can you quickly turn to genesis chapter one somewhere some great stuff is india this destructive spirit was first released in the garden of eden when the first man who carried all men inside his lungs violate his stewardship he was given trust and responsibility for the entire act and the world on it he was trusted with the responsibility to maintain the righteous standard of his creator god on the earth through obedience which is the highest form of reverence let's hear the prophet fate that was once delivered to the sense 1953 now let's get back in genesis and pick up the beginning we find out everything that we got today originated in genesis genesis is the sixth chapter of the bible everything begins in genesis all right because genesis is the the word genesis means the beginning and it is the seed chapter where god saw his seed everything and the everyone saw his seed and god saw his seed and here the crops are coming up on the earth just exactly the way god says galatians 6 7 said be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man saw that shall he reap genesis 1 26 said then let us make man in our own image after our only life let them have dominion over the features of the sea over the fouls of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every crippling things that creep into the earth so man was created to dominate the act the word dominate means to govern to control to manage and to have steel worship over that means he was responsible for the quality of life on the planet so he was trans he was therefore set up as a manager over god's property i want you to note here that god never give up ownership of this place he just gives us the management contract he's still the owner the earth is the lord and the fullness thereof so god sealed the honor of this planet but he gave men the management contract to man in genesis chapter 2 15 he told the man what to do with the planet to walk it cultivate it subdue it dominate it genesis chapter 3 god says that there god said that there was an irresponsible act this man took the trust and still worshipped and violated and end and he ended up in the hand of the unlawful illegal unemployed cherubim so here we see god's property being mismanaged and falling into the hands of diabolical abominable force of god lucifer in chapter 3 it says they fell and they destroyed it it says they fell and they destroyed destroyed and go and and and god they and and so they disobeyed god and they lost the management contract in chapter three somewhere something happened god came in and asked the man where are thou and here comes that interest of irresponsibility he transformed blame to somebody else adam said he said this woman you gave me is the cause of all this problem she came out of you how can you blame your offspring for your misbehavior that's why god ignored that statement he didn't listen to adam when trouble fell upon humanity god never went to the woman he went to the man he went to the source he said we are a dao he was not a question of location it is a question of disposition the prophet said the church had no more conscience the church better examine herself by the word of god her purity and loyalty and devotion it was a question of this position it was not a question of law of position you did not run your home well adam god said adam what happened that was the question where are you man how did you get this how did you get here look at adam's response he was that woman ever since till that day man has been saying it was this woman brothers irresponsibility transferring of blame from that day the man has been attempting to avoid responsibility by transferring his blame to other from that day god has been attempting to restore mankind to his rightful place of responsibility in all of god's demand and all of god's doing within his creation man in every generation in every ethics expressing his expression in every culture in every way god has desired man to be restored to a responsible free moral agent he created him when he first released him from his own lines god is still trying to get men back to their responsible free will agent he don't want to make you a robot god purpose is obvious in his design for a man he made and created man to be free spirit an independent will he intended for man to rule and govern and to be a manager over the edge through the power of choice and that's to determine the quality of life and environment that he was designed within the context of god's will that means he gave him will to activate his choice hallelujah friends the purpose of the baptism of the holy spirit is not just to have a shield bombs check your body it's not to have good feeling the purpose of the baptism of the holy ghost is not to have good dance that's okay but that's not his purpose the purpose is not for you to shout not only for you to shout or scream he comes to give you dreams and vision and prophecy it gets a good it's good to get good feeling but can't see you if you it's good to get good feeling but if you can't see where you are going you've missed the purpose the baptism of the holy ghost should give you direction purpose and vision in your life if you speak in tongues which some people call the baptism of holy ghost and you don't know why you wake up every morning you are sick if you follow the holy ghost but you don't have any direction then you miss the purpose of the holy ghost he comes to make the old man dream and that's where i am this morning i am dreaming wonderful dreaming the old man dream and take that dream and transfer it to young people who will make it a vision come on young people hallelujah we are not just able we are more than evil we are going to take this land we will take this land i said we will take this land you don't understand what i'm talking about i don't think we are too old now we are not yet finished yet i suggest that the purpose of the holy ghost is to give humanity vision again the purpose of the holy ghost is to give you purpose for living again when you come into relationship with god and receive the holy ghost you have a reason of living again hallelujah i was was blind but now i can see my vision is crystallized i've risen to existence you receive the baptism of the holy ghost not to feel good but you have to you got a reason to wake up every morning hallelujah so as the holy ghost speaks to this convention my fear is that every purpose has a season and every purpose has a time it is possible to miss your season some have attempted to fulfill their purpose out of due season just like the prophet tried to pray for that little child before the old lady the grandmother took a seat and took off her grass and begin to wipe it the prophet said on experience 1948 march 2 i said i am telling you now i am sorry for what i done a while ago the vision wasn't complete you cannot do anything out of season and vision don't miss it stay a lot with the baptism of the holy ghost there is a time for everything there is a time for everything if you miss your timing it could be premature to eat it could be too late that a time for everything under heaven there is a season my great fear for this generation is that many of us are preoccupied with the past seasons and we have not changed our clothes to the season that we are in to everything there is a season and to every new season is that right there is a time you are listening to me god is moving out to do something with young people young people you just got to believe in yourself now there's something happening just like our pastor have been telling us the wind of change has switched to the people who are unlike who who who are unlikely that is why i said it is the season for the bride of christ i tell you something about season that when a season change you can do nothing about it season have no respect for your opinion winter doesn't care what you think about it is going to come secondly season never comes with your permission it doesn't need your invitation it will come when it is the time and when it comes you can argue you can disagree you can get mad you can puff up you can separate but they are going to come and they will affect you thirdly if you don't like the season it will kill you if you defer winter winter will win just close your cars i don't like this you go outside it will kill you it doesn't beg you to come when the time comes he will come all you need to do is to adjust change your clothes hallelujah because it's not the end of it after winter there's going to be the best season some of us are going through winter of our life that's not the end of your life you got to look beyond that manage the season and let it pass hallelujah adjust to it otherwise it will kill you if you go out in the winter with no jacket winter will win he will not respect your opinion so we find out that the bride has made herself ready be willing to lay aside every weight of sin that does israel visit us that we might run this race with patients that is set before us we must lay aside everything that easily beset us that pull us back we've got to get ready and fight this battle the prophet said winter will kill you when you when you when the change comes don't get mad at it or just to eat change your clothes it will not be more than four months recognize it and give it its respect the reason i say this is that the church does not bother graham said the reason i said this if the church does not get himself ready that's your duty to get ready the bride has to make herself ready the government has been paid for they are ready but you have to put them on yourself says the prophet amen let's really wind down now oh it's too much i'm so sorry and there's a new season upon the world now and it cannot be business as usual god has turned his face to the young people everywhere including the third world country and america and is raising them up for this last battle and it doesn't need your permission you just get to get prepared because there's something on the move you better adjust the season no matter what your opinion is god is going to look for young people to use but abram said the young people will sweep this gospel if the devil is recruiting his army god is also recruiting his own he's preparing and planning them because there's going to be a showdown we must never sacrifice therefore the present responsibility on the altar of past accomplishment whatever you did before is not what counts we must never allow our season to pass us without fulfilling our purpose for that season people need to be born again by the holy spirit when god brings you out slavery personally or corporately as the nation of the people he brings you into deliverance reference is not freedom you can make a note on that i'm going to say it's slowly deliverance is not freedom don't confuse deliverance with freedom i'm going to say something here today i hope you hear the spirit of prophecy when people are delivered they will do what miriam did they will get tumbling jump dance you know have a good feeling shout that's tremendous but deliverance but you are delivered but you are not yet free the prophet said in paradigm 1963 now let's ask ourselves the question isn't that something like that as bad as i hate to say it we got to face facts somehow there is something wrong somewhere listen he brought them out of egypt through the red sea but told us the life of the egyptians are like the christians journey the life of the children of israel in the in in that place he took them through the kenner let me run now i i don't think i need to go through all of this but let me just finish that the bible said they were never touched with water it was a dry ground it your their deliverance was miraculous when god delivered you from slavery you are delivered it is all hundred percent what god can do he serves and delivers you without your help he brings you into deliverance if you we are drunkard an alcoholic drug addict or whatever god saves you instantly means you are changed but don't confuse that with freedom reverse people are dangerous people because they are not free you don't believe me wait there is another problem come up you will see their true character but delivered people are dangerous because they haven't changed wait until something happened you will see what they are made up of all they have changed is location and that's not what we are doing god was asking her down where at that adam was telling him i saw you i might it's not location it's about this position your spiritual stand with god the reason why god will not take people direct into freedom is because you have been in slavery for a long time and you aren't god the mentality of freedom so wilderness is a place to knock that slavery mentality out of you to be able to enter the promised land so it has to take you through training processes in the wilderness to try to get egypt out of your mind out of your spirit before let you into canaan the wilderness is designed to get rid of egypt an exposition of seven church age nine the leadership church as many as i love i rebuke chester be serious therefore and repent revelation 3 19. this is the same message that john had he cried out in the in that religious wilderness of pharisees and disease he then repent there was no other cause then there is no other cause now there was no other way to get back to god and there is no other way now it is repent change your mind turn around repent let that slavery mentality leave you let me say this friends if you don't learn your lesson in the wilderness god will bury you dear and i'm going to say it again we have been wondering why certain group of people wouldn't see to progress don't they see to make how they didn't seem to make it forward i mean they have been delivered they have been complaining after their deliverance they have been delivered but they have been complaining they have been delivered but they have been blaming the past blaming everybody else transferring responsibility for hundreds of years blaming they just keep they've been delivered and god keep burying them right there in the wilderness keep burying them just keep burying them god will not allow the spirit of egypt to enter canaan or help me god there is no freedom without law therefore law is therefore is always law freedom means you are under control of another person but under the higher law of the principle laid down by god freedom is not an absent of work or the cancellation of responsibility but rather the release to work the release to work to fulfill an assignment of responsibility jesus closed the concept of freedom with a statement in john 8 32 he said then you will know the truth and the truth will make you free in other words freedom cannot be given to you by human beings it is discovered when you discover the truth about your life a slave has no permanent place in the family jesus said in john chapter john 15 but a song belongs to the family forever servants he says must be promoted to friends god does not want to remain god does not want you to remain a servant always begging following crawling he wants you to become friend who knows his mind his will his purpose paul said in galentine chapter four and he said as long as a year he's a child he di he's treated like a slave but when he grow up he get inheritance no longer are you going to be treated like a slave in the body of christ church hear me that time is over no longer can you be treated as a slave in the body of christ irresponsibility led lead to slavery proverbs chapter 6 verse 5 says free yourself like a greaser you strum it and get up from your sleep a little slumber elite a little sleepy little slumber poverty comes upon you like a abundant freedom demand responsibility responsibility is a result of maturity which is the evidence of character which is produced by trials and testing disobedient leads to bondage and disobedient lead to irresponsibility it's an act of irreverence the highest form of act of irreverence is is disobedient bible says like a witchcrafting jesus was here seeking the will of the father you don't own yourself it's not about you i close now graciality freedom is expensive it's very costly it's a high price deliverance is instant but freedom is a process one must be prepared for freedom all oppressed through all oppression produce the spirit of irresponsibility the spirit of laziness hatred to walk fear distrust law self-esteem poor self-concept selfishness timid spirit of spirit of immediate and instant gratification that's what the world is sovereign under right now people who have been oppressed for many years they want instant gratification young people save yourself from that don't want to plan they don't want to plan and wait and end they want instant cash a spirit of slavery still upon them issa was a good example of a man who has a slave mentality when he is hungry he sells his birthright for some food instant gratification forgetting he will be hungry again but he needed something deliverance may not lead to freedom and that's the saddest of the this night this afternoon deliverance is not freedom freedom is deliverance from oppression deliverance is released from the oppressed let me repeat it deliverance is a release from the oppressed but freedom is deliverance from the oppression you can be delivered and still possess the the you can you can be released and still not free let me leave this but let us close really now i want to read my last quote and then we pray i just pray that we are
