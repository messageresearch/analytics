[24:51] says after these things I saw four
[24:53] angels standing on the four corners of
[24:54] the earth holding the four winds of the
[24:57] earth that the wind should not blow on
[24:59] the earth and on the sea nor any tree
[25:01] and I saw another angel ascending from
[25:05] the east having the seal of the Living
[25:08] God the cry aloud for his to the four
[25:11] angels to whom it was given to hurt the
[25:12] earth and the sea saying hurt not the
[25:15] earth neither the sea nor the trees till
[25:19] we have sealed the servants of our God
[25:23] in defiance and I heard the number of
[25:27] them which was sealed and they were
[25:29] sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the
[25:34] children of Israel revolution did this
[25:38] one and when he had opened the Seventh
[25:41] Seal There was silence in heaven about
[25:43] his peace of half an hour I won't quote
[25:47] Ezekiel chapter 9 will from verse 1 he
[25:53] cried also in mine ears with a loud
[25:55] voice saying caused them the half
[25:57] charged over the city to draw near even
[26:00] every man with his destroying weapon in
[26:03] his hand and behold the six men came
[26:07] from the way of the high gate which
[26:09] slide towards the north and every man a
[26:11] slaughter weapon in his hand and one man
[26:14] crowed was cluttered with linen with the
[26:17] writers inkhorn
[26:18] by his side and he went and stood beside
[26:23] the brazen altar and the glory of the
[26:26] God of Israel was calling from the
[26:28] cherub whereupon he wise to the
[26:30] threshold of the house and he called to
[26:33] the man clothed with linen which are the
[26:35] writers inkwon by sight and the Lord
[26:38] said unto him go through the midst of
[26:42] the city through the midst of Jerusalem
[26:45] and set a mark upon the foreheads of the
[26:48] men that sigh and cry for the
[26:51] abominations that be done in the midst
[26:53] thereof and he unto the others he said
[26:56] go here after him through the city and
[26:59] smite let not your eyes spear neither
[27:03] heavy
[27:03] pity slay utterly all and young would
[27:07] means a little children and woman but
[27:10] come not near any man upon whom is the
[27:13] mark and begin at my sanctuary then they
[27:17] began at the ancient men which were
[27:20] before the house may God bless his word
[27:22] you may be seated but tonight is strange
[27:33] what we have to share with you tonight
[27:35] but God is good our title the angel from
[27:40] the east that's the title the angel from
[27:44] the east of a context scripture I'm Luke
[27:49] chapter 11 are gonna read it out if you
[27:51] want to read it and this is this one
[27:54] Luke chapter 11 and he came the past as
[27:57] he was praying in a certain place when
[28:04] he ceased one of these sciples said unto
[28:07] Him Lord teach us to pray as John also
[28:09] taught his disciples and he said unto
[28:12] them when you pray see our Father who
[28:15] art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[28:18] thus worship unto God knowledge in his
[28:21] name and thy kingdom come you expect in
[28:25] the kingdom and I will be done in as in
[28:27] heaven so into it then the requests give
[28:31] us this day by day our daily bread and
[28:33] forgive us our sins what's the condition
[28:37] for we also forgive everyone that is
[28:40] indebted to us and lead us not into
[28:43] temptation but deliver us from evil and
[28:46] he said to them which of you want to get
[28:48] to this which of you have a friend and
[28:51] Charles go on to him at midnight and
[28:54] siient am friend
[28:55] let me try loose for a friend of mine in
[28:58] his journey has come to me I have
[29:00] nothing to set before him
[29:02] and he from within shall answer and said
[29:04] trouble me not the door is now shut and
[29:06] my children are with me in bed I cannot
[29:09] rise and give thee see and I say unto
[29:19] you doll
[29:20] listen door he will not rise and give
[29:24] him because he is a friend yet because
[29:29] of his importunity he will rise and give
[29:33] him as many as he needed and that
[29:35] importunity is because of his
[29:37] persistence because of his nagging he
[29:41] will give as many as he needed and then
[29:44] he said this I see on do you ask it
[29:46] shall be given to you seek and you shall
[29:49] find knock it shall be opened unto you
[29:53] for every one that asketh receiveth so
[29:56] you know we put the foot again not now
[29:57] ass kept receiving he that seeketh find
[30:00] it and he that knocketh it shall be
[30:02] opened so he make it clear is not one

[30:08] ask seek knock it in other words you're
[30:12] keepin on till you get what you have
[30:14] neither because that friend is not a
[30:18] friend is not gonna come off from his
[30:20] bed because he's a friend he's gonna
[30:22] come up because they are asking that
[30:23] person I have nothing to set before me
[30:25] like that family and I have or that
[30:27] guest that I have I need help I need
[30:30] some bread could you kill me that bread
[30:32] oh gosh I know you're tired I know you
[30:34] had a hard day's work but my friend come
[30:37] from overseas and I have nothing all the
[30:39] stores are closed the restaurants are
[30:41] closed I know you have bread inside the
[30:43] day I saw you buy the bakery
[30:45] you can't tell me to have no bread you
[30:46] have bread inside the dear don't lie you
[30:49] have bread inside there dear bring it
[30:51] out and knead it I cannot move in stay
[30:55] in here good meet me any morning all
[30:58] glory to God your horizon there all
[31:01] glory of Jesus put that parable to give
[31:03] you an idea of your attitude of your
[31:05] persistence of your importunity well
[31:08] glory to God go says Jesus my friend no
[31:10] no
[31:11] you have something I need you have
[31:13] something you want
[31:14] yes something I've got to have Oh glory
[31:17] to God hallelujah he has a Mac he have a
[31:20] seal he have a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[31:23] you have a promise for you Oh glory to
[31:26] God and to your children and the temple
[31:28] afar off even as many as a lot of a God
[31:31] shall call you have an experience for
[31:33] you he have a fire for you he has a
[31:36] powerful you do you want it
[31:38] Oh glory to God know what Jesus is back
[31:46] running this
[31:47] he said he give the all-father prayer I
[31:50] forgive us as we forgive those who
[31:51] trespass against us and then you get
[31:53] this parable about a man of a long
[31:54] journey a long journey come to see have
[31:57] nothing to set before me describe this
[31:59] scenario a friend of mine is journey a
[32:02] long journey come to me I have nothing
[32:04] set before him and then the persistence
[32:07] and then he come and said well this is
[32:09] the attitude no he's breaking it on ask
[32:11] it shall be given to you and seek and ye
[32:13] shall find and knock shall be opened to
[32:15] you and to the lazy people who say they
[32:17] went and knock and nobody opened the
[32:19] door and they asked and they didn't get
[32:21] and they seek and didn't find he answer
[32:24] all that lazy behavior he comes out the
[32:26] next level here in that ask at him that
[32:28] knocketh him that seeketh not him that
[32:31] not oh god you're lazy that's why you're
[32:33] not not yet you're not knocking enough
[32:35] hallelujah not seeking enough yeah well
[32:38] I pray no no no yes seek him enough
[32:40] you're not seeking you have to see no
[32:42] there's a reason why I'm reading this
[32:44] because he had a next line here if a son
[32:49] shall ask bread of any of you disease of
[32:52] father will he give him a stone if he
[32:56] ask a fish will he for fish give him a
[32:59] serpent if he asks for an egg will you
[33:03] give him a famous scorpion
[33:04] then he said this if ye then being evil
[33:08] know how to give good gifts unto your
[33:13] children how much more shall your
[33:16] heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit
[33:20] them that ask him to them to them that
[33:35] check the pasta ham to death that come
[33:38] and sitting in church and listened and
[33:40] read the word no to them that so this is
[33:43] personal to them that ask him so you get
[33:47] the whole background to show you what is
[33:49] happening and why is the foolish version
[33:51] will remain foolish and while the wines
[33:56] version will be made wise because the
[33:59] wise not taking nothing for granted
[34:01] the wines have extra oil and there's a
[34:05] reason why the wise have extra oil and
[34:08] the foolish oil ran out the Hat you know
[34:12] yes they had a portion you know yes the
[34:15] atmosphere they had it but what they had
[34:20] ran out or dried out hallelujah
[34:25] but this wise version she going to ask
[34:30] she's going to receive many others just
[34:34] talking the talk this wise version going
[34:37] to walk that talk Oh glory to God
[34:40] hallelujah glory to God is that pulling
[34:44] a bed one taken one left make sure you
[34:48] are the one that's taken it's an
[34:52] individual affair you have to see it go
[34:56] glory to God Amen let's continue is so
[35:00] much question none says Mr Bowen dong he
[35:04] said to me I couldn't read a revelation
[35:05] there was a bride standing on the Mount
[35:07] Sinai there's a bride up yonder he said
[35:10] there was a bride and the water and the
[35:11] dragon sweating water his mode to make
[35:13] war with her I said miserable and the
[35:15] first thing of it is you've got the
[35:17] wrong thing calling it the brine I said
[35:21] the Jews will stun among Sinai 144,000
[35:26] the bride correctly was in heaven with
[35:29] Jesus on the dragon that splitter
[35:31] water out of his mouth will make war
[35:33] with the remnant of the woman's seed
[35:36] that was this group here that had to go
[35:40] down the remnant of the woman seed and
[35:43] his describing it the sanctified Church

[55:38] deal my Redemption that is what the Holy
[55:41] Ghost is you should want it I couldn't
[55:44] go on without it
[55:45] Oh glory to God hallelujah we believe
[55:48] that now this church is the message is
[55:52] being poured into the church this is
[55:54] after Schippers she sits as a shepherd
[55:56] dream was a vision of a man with with
[55:58] water and point only water leaking out
[56:01] then he take our big bucket of honey and
[56:02] pour it into this big rock box and it
[56:04] held and he said the Holy Ghost that
[56:06] represented the Holy Ghost in the church
[56:07] no church could hold it whoa let's go
[56:10] now and about a honey this is good hold
[56:12] the honey is free to forgiveness all
[56:13] right watch in this church is a message
[56:16] the important to the church but the
[56:17] church but in itself here we go
[56:19] this tabernacle we would see that's
[56:22] where she comes to church this
[56:23] tabernacle is not a Holy Ghost
[56:25] Tabernacle there is no such a thing the
[56:31] Holy Ghost in okay individuals that come
[56:36] in the discharge is Holy Ghost
[56:38] tabernacle
[56:40] they added Tabernacles that contained
[56:43] the Holy Ghost but not the church in a
[56:45] body or group so that's why nobody could
[56:48] say here is it Jesus already he said
[56:53] when they say look here go follow them
[56:55] look here come here that is not it
[56:57] he said behold the kingdom is within you
[57:00] come on we gotta make sense yours key
[57:04] all that kind of Revelation is it look
[57:06] nice it's so good and so on but it off
[57:10] it's not the word the Holy Ghost is
[57:13] poured out on individuals give the Lord
[57:16] a shout on that
[57:17] [Applause]
[57:25] Parabellum should we speak in tongues
[57:28] absolutely that's gifts of God but those
[57:30] gifts of God without these virtues in
[57:32] them makes it a stumbling block to the
[57:34] unbeliever it's not accepted by God
[57:37] this rock mud if you choose now has to
[57:39] be first and when you have faith and
[57:41] virtue and knowledge and temperance and
[57:43] patience and coordination but love then
[57:45] the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you
[57:50] as a unit the same as he sees the church
[57:54] ages as a unit so the church ages has to
[57:58] be sealed as a unit hallelujah
[58:01] hallelujah and the individual has to be
[58:03] seen as a unit so them seven things had
[58:06] to be in you then Duncan the Holy Ghost
[58:07] and seeing the whole buildin love seal
[58:17] all the virtues in that Nunley coat
[58:21] he said because a little patience they
[58:23] can leak out temperance you can leak out
[58:25] this and Rico that but when that holy
[58:26] was come and sealed the whole thing you
[58:29] become a sealed unit of the Lord God Oh
[58:33] glory with a mark on you with an address
[58:37] with a destination grieve not the Holy
[58:40] Spirit whereby you are sealed until the
[58:43] day of your redemption glory to God God
[58:47] put that mark and said redeemed Oh glory
[58:50] to God a redeemed son he ticked you off
[58:57] [Applause]
[58:58] let's continue then the holy ghost come
[59:02] down and ceaseless unit the same as you
[59:03] seen the church is the unit the way he
[59:05] mix the way he makes his bride okay
[59:08] the way he makes his bride is the way he
[59:11] makes this individual made out of the
[59:13] same material like Eve was made out of
[59:16] Adam a rib from his side he has the
[59:18] things that you have to have faith here

[1:11:01] oh dear I'll pray for the sick but in
[1:11:03] here I'm interested in one thing that is
[1:11:06] God's born-again Church that is what I'm
[1:11:09] interested in anyhow I am NOT interested
[1:11:12] in bylaws Deacons and so forth like that
[1:11:15] orders of churches I'm interested in the
[1:11:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost

[1:11:25] living in go to the Lord and show yes
[1:11:30] the Lord has show hallelujah not by laws

[1:12:07] when Jesus was walking with them pizza
[1:12:11] and all I'm gonna say I have the Holy
[1:12:12] Ghost because I will goes with them even
[1:12:16] Jesus tell them he say I will not leave
[1:12:18] you comfortless come when I was with you
[1:12:20] but shall be in you so what was with
[1:12:22] them had to come in them let me say it
[1:12:26] again because the dynamics is yet power
[1:12:31] is here
[1:12:32] everything you see here up to you see
[1:12:35] everything present tense God is here
[1:12:37] everything is here but that to be
[1:12:43] translated
[1:12:44] Jesus had was a recently dead give them
[1:12:47] clarity of understanding by Oprah
[1:12:50] understanding open the seals of the Old
[1:12:53] Testament that I'm the word
[1:12:54] they had the understanding open the
[1:12:57] wooden open didn't know what they had to
[1:12:59] get he didn't give them the
[1:13:03] understanding educate them in only no
[1:13:06] more than the Pharisees that wasn't it
[1:13:08] wasn't it was revelation that they could
[1:13:12] come under expectation for their
[1:13:14] manifestation so when God identified
[1:13:17] with stammering lips and another tongue
[1:13:18] identify Jewish Scripture shall come to
[1:13:21] pass support my spirit Jesus taught
[1:13:23] descriptors to them he was reading the
[1:13:26] courts he was bringing an Old Testament
[1:13:29] prophecy and said this is what have to
[1:13:32] come that's why when Peter come he said
[1:13:33] this is that because Jesus should exact
[1:13:38] that the Prophet Joel speak of peace our
[1:13:42] could identify this manifestation is
[1:13:44] because of this prophecy here Laurie
[1:13:49] [Applause]
[1:13:51] [Music]
[1:13:52] when Jesus overcome Satan in the
[1:13:55] wilderness and he came to the chamber
[1:13:56] what did Jesus do he find the place
[1:13:59] where it was written
[1:14:01] he found his scriptures and he said the
[1:14:04] spirit upon me and they thought he was
[1:14:06] just reading scripture then he said this
[1:14:08] is that this scripture is fulfilling
[1:14:12] your ears so Jesus thought was to find
[1:14:19] his scripture to identify himself with
[1:14:22] the bride has to find her scriptures to
[1:14:26] identify yourself with we are not going
[1:14:28] to identify with foolish virgins remnant
[1:14:31] of the woman's seed revolution since we
[1:14:33] not identify with that I call them
[1:14:37] jubilation since let's continue there
[1:14:43] are two types of Christianity's seem
[1:14:45] strange I would not say two different
[1:14:48] types I say two different phases will be
[1:14:51] a better word to use not two types two
[1:14:53] phases
[1:14:54] simcha sanity but two phases of it one
[1:14:57] of them is an intellectual or mental
[1:15:00] conception
[1:15:01] of what God has said in his word and of
[1:15:04] Jesus Christ by way of knowledge and the
[1:15:07] other is an experimental experience that
[1:15:12] God has given the man in his heart and
[1:15:15] ported him going to church but didn't
[1:15:18] believe the message both her and her
[1:15:20] books and tips but one have an
[1:15:22] experimental experience here and the
[1:15:24] other one of a heading but not missing
[1:15:28] services Oh give the loss embraces
[1:15:33] intellectually is hunger in one
[1:15:36] he's feasting on God his feet doesn't
[1:15:39] allow the other one seems that the
[1:15:40] victory all the time nothing but us then
[1:15:42] they're just a solid an anchor as they
[1:15:45] can be no trials no storms bother them
[1:15:48] at all but they seem to have something
[1:15:49] about them the people who are Christians
[1:15:51] trying to live for God admire that type
[1:15:55] of Christian and I often wondered Lord
[1:15:57] what is it that these people have that
[1:15:59] the others create so much for oh my
[1:16:01] hallelujah something is in the heart
[1:16:04] same aside shells in manager no but
[1:16:08] something is new heart he's a denied
[1:16:10] Christ because runaway Pittacus but
[1:16:12] something happened in his heart in the
[1:16:15] upper room the devil got kicked told
[1:16:16] this snake got firebombed and God sat
[1:16:19] down on the tool of his heart and Peter
[1:16:21] was a changed man same pictures I take a
[1:16:23] picture of him on Instagram be the same
[1:16:25] brother Peter same face him kiss him
[1:16:28] everything but he had change Oh glory to
[1:16:31] God somebody else inside of that man Oh
[1:16:33] glory to God His Holy Ghost and fire
[1:16:36] inside of that man
[1:16:37] it proved different and NASA Sapphira
[1:16:40] came lion in the church it come out of
[1:16:42] him it's a power it's a hidden power it
[1:16:44] comes out as we might need Peter was
[1:16:46] looking to give the man money at the
[1:16:48] gate called beautiful he had no money
[1:16:50] but he remembered what he had he had his
[1:16:52] selves and all right number what I have
[1:16:54] I can give you man
[1:16:55] folklore I could give you that thing
[1:16:56] what I have will glory rise up and walk
[1:16:59] in the name of Jesus Christ because I am
[1:17:01] now connected to the source itself or
[1:17:03] whoever sourcing me other power in me
[1:17:06] I'm an efficient well in me Oh
[1:17:09] 20 on tech or glory dog or I am
[1:17:12] connected director diviner I am a branch
[1:17:15] and the power from the vine flow through
[1:17:18] me as my father send me jesus said so
[1:17:21] son are you he was a powerhouse he was
[1:17:24] connected to the very source itself or
[1:17:27] glory to God so the Spirit of God was
[1:17:29] flowing through the line through that
[1:17:31] branch to whosoever will or give the
[1:17:34] Lord a shout this is what caught one for
[1:17:36] you will see profit look in the second
[1:17:48] chapter of Joshua find out here that I
[1:17:50] believe in harlot named Rahab Gentile
[1:17:52] harlots across the river and when they
[1:17:54] come into the Promised Land the spies
[1:17:55] went over the spout all of our family
[1:17:57] was safe under the talking now remember
[1:18:00] listen God's destroying angel on earth
[1:18:03] at talking and when the churches went
[1:18:06] down the mayor fell the city went down
[1:18:08] the king went down the governor the
[1:18:11] educated the pretty woman the handsome
[1:18:13] man the important all-sufficient
[1:18:14] everything went wrong that wasn't under
[1:18:16] the token so will it be in the coming of
[1:18:19] the Son of God his destroying angel will
[1:18:22] destroy everything who hasn't got the
[1:18:25] total of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:27] upon them to show that you are being
[1:18:30] identified and died yourself to your
[1:18:34] sacrifice and are born into the Spirit
[1:18:37] of God and seal there by the Holy Ghost
[1:18:39] Oh hallelujah take a debt born and
[1:18:44] they're sealed in there by the Holy
[1:18:45] Ghost oh my do you believe that
[1:18:47] and in the last days there'll be only
[1:18:50] two kinds of people two classes of
[1:18:52] people then that has the seal and the
[1:18:55] others that will have the mark of the
[1:18:56] beast so the seed of God is the Baptist
[1:18:59] of the Holy Spirit and the mark of the
[1:19:01] beast is not a stamp on your hand the
[1:19:04] mark of the beast is rejecting the scene
[1:19:05] of God you take the mark of the beast
[1:19:10] the first thing you know the time will
[1:19:14] come when you will be God will give a
[1:19:17] message that annual beasts
[1:19:19] Tilden or CeeLo the kingdom of God oh my
[1:19:22] I wonder if that time is on a zipper
[1:19:24] currently a fresh message a fresh
[1:19:27] prophecy of the prophecy Oh hallelujah
[1:19:29] prophecy a message of the seed of God Oh
[1:19:32] hallelujah
[1:19:34] oh man read it again the time will come
[1:19:38] when you call it will give a message who
[1:19:42] will give a message God will give a
[1:19:46] message now what the percentage is
[1:19:49] he said one he said the world will hear
[1:19:51] direct from God
[1:19:52] once more he's not talked about himself
[1:19:55] now he talked about the spirit and the
[1:19:58] brand the Prophet will say the same
[1:20:00] thing and what they say will have
[1:20:02] already been said in the world
[1:20:03] once more the world will hear Tigra from
[1:20:05] God how will you know it's the voice of
[1:20:08] God it will be a manifestation of the
[1:20:10] prophets world that is how you're gonna
[1:20:12] lose the voice of God not I explained
[1:20:14] this that we in this new a manifest this
[1:20:15] is that that the Prophet William Branham
[1:20:17] speak of or give the Lord a shout in
[1:20:20] other words here is a seventh on the
[1:20:22] revival this is that that the Prophet
[1:20:24] said that there will come a time when
[1:20:26] people fly from everywhere to see the
[1:20:28] seven thunders being manifested this is
[1:20:30] that that the Prophet take of the bride
[1:20:33] had my revival yet it will take them
[1:20:35] seven thunders to wake up the bride
[1:20:37] again there has been no manifestation of
[1:20:39] God to stir the bride he will send it
[1:20:42] then we have to sit this is that that
[1:20:44] the Prophet said look he's in it look at
[1:20:46] here or give the Lord a shout glory to
[1:20:49] God hallelujah identifying what the
[1:20:52] prophet prophecy is Oh glory to God
[1:20:55] because when you take the book from the
[1:20:57] angel the only prophesy according to the

[1:29:05] you need a bath only goes and the middle
[1:29:07] word Oh give the Lord a shout let me say

[1:29:24] government see this put on it it cannot
[1:29:25] be opened
[1:29:26] no more on televisions finally the
[1:29:28] destination he said now when a greenery
[1:29:30] falls on the earth no matter if that
[1:29:32] gonna be dice itself it can't produce a
[1:29:34] Taco Bell to save its soul a greener eat
[1:29:36] will bring forth a green or wheat and
[1:29:39] the Holy Spirit leading the church leads
[1:29:42] it in the power of the resurrection of
[1:29:45] Jesus Christ that's men who leave us
[1:29:47] leaden Oh glory to God so but over the
[1:29:50] Holy Ghost is the power exactly the
[1:29:52] Bible is a road map the road map the
[1:29:54] power feet takes you there Oh glory to
[1:29:57] God power to do what reproduce a promise
[1:29:59] ain't ain't power cometh out the shakin
[1:30:02] just for long it's the produced a
[1:30:03] promise power come to identify the
[1:30:05] promise when Paulo come upon Jesus the
[1:30:08] Bible says he returned in the power of
[1:30:10] the Spirit and then in the power of the
[1:30:13] Spirit define the scripture what was
[1:30:15] promised the Spirit is upon me because
[1:30:17] he has anointed me or glory to God that
[1:30:19] was the promise of the hour he
[1:30:20] identified with it and the power push
[1:30:22] through the channel of that prophecy and
[1:30:25] there's a book the manifestation the
[1:30:27] Messiah or give the Lord a salt India
[1:30:31] was this commission under bright
[1:30:32] commission to declare the day of
[1:30:35] vengeance of our God to finish the
[1:30:37] Commission Oh hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:30:40] amen oh I love him
[1:30:46] he said no when you hit a bone you're
[1:30:49] the trouble chicken away it really blown
[1:30:51] away so if I preach tonight I've
[1:30:53] appreciated hit a bone if we see that
[1:30:57] the bone just put it one aside
[1:30:59] you eatin cherry pie you're on the seat
[1:31:02] you know Charlie Parra we just recently
[1:31:04] so you do the same thing in listen to
[1:31:06] this I believe the reason there is so
[1:31:10] much confusion today about the Holy
[1:31:13] Spirit
[1:31:14] it is not correctly taught I believe the
[1:31:18] baptism is taught and just say baptism
[1:31:20] but when you say automobile no I've got
[1:31:23] several mechanics in the church I don't
[1:31:24] know one thing about it so if I make a
[1:31:26] mistake is I'm another mechanic there
[1:31:28] are coils plugs points vowels everything
[1:31:31] else that makes an automobile so when
[1:31:33] you talk about baptism of the Holy
[1:31:35] Spirit
[1:31:36] there's a lot that goes with that so you
[1:31:40] can all the experience and says you're
[1:31:42] one do one without transition I want to
[1:31:49] feel I want to move you come from a
[1:31:54] Methodist or in some holiness people
[1:31:59] don't think the same yeah I'm talk about

[1:32:04] fiery Holy Ghost and everybody acoustic

[1:32:14] feeling very uncomfortable because for
[1:32:17] months preceding with spiritual this is

[1:32:27] formal want to tell me one stiff before
