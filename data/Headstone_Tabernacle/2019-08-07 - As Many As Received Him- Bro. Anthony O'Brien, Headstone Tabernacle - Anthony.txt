a man is not right well I have a title a man's right out of the scripture my title is but as many as receive him my subject is to them gave he power and my inspiration is to become the sons of God amen praise God hallelujah hey man so pre is gone it's pretty much the inspiration here and so I want to talk about you know this scripture in John 1 he was in the world and the world was made by him isn't alright let's imagine a great corner of glory made the world and everything in it the trees the animals he made man in his own image he made this entire world that we see around us it was made by his own hands is Niraj hallelujah yet the world knew him not the world didn't know who he was God hell it was great a mysterious Oh hallelujah since man fell in the beginning he lost a connection with God isn't that right and so God was so mysterious throughout the ages he unveiled a little fold of himself it isn't all right to every servant to every prophet and to every believer holily unveiled a puts a little piece of himself hallelujah is now right to t that he was a shepherd is now right to Joshua he was a captain isn't that right hallelujah he was something he was something there he was a rocking a rock hallelujah Eman isn't all right he was a wheel in the middle of the wheel amen amen it's not right and he keep on veiling himself in in different dispositions in time holily isn't that right Harley was a fire he's a he's an angel he's a this he's a man he's a shepherd he's either he's a father he's a provider Jehovah Jireh a man is not right hallelujah hallelujah a man yet still not showing it's mystery and full amen amen but coming on to something he wanted to unveil himself hallelujah because he was too mysterious he was too much for the human mind to handle so he made himself just enough that we could relate to him we needed a father and he became our Father well our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name Oh hallelujah he wanted to be a healer and so it became a healer to us because we were sick and in need of a physician he made himself he calls himself to become whatever we had need of when he came and spoke to Moses hallelujah Oh to the

Joseph in prison he was right and yet he had to take wrong for all those years he was wrongly accused holiday he saps Allah in his pity hallelujah in his messed up situation yet in that he had to believe what God said concerning him because he had a dream the court showed a long time ago but the spouse will POW into him nice honey God had to fulfill that and in its present situation it didn't look like God had its time it didn't look like God was regarding him it's not but God knows the end from the beginning your present situation does not determine who you are hallelujah maybe tell me where you are at a point in time but don't let it ever dictate who you are and how you act and how you behave Oh hallelujah your conduct and your behavior is what will qualify you for this adoption that we are talking about hallelujah how you conduct yourself I miss the trials and he in his wisdom sends your way Oh somebody say he knows you can handle it he knows he could take the pressure something I feel like I'm a crack you open but he knows how much you can handle he's trying to bring you to a point where you can forget about yourself we can forget about your old strength and recognize that his strength is perfect it's perfect your strength might be 98% I might be 95 percent or whatever but his strength is perfect when you run your run and you reach your limits Gordon I'll

is all shared he is my heartbeat he's a reason why I'm living he's the reason why I could sing why I could shout why I could lift my hands Oh hallelujah hallelujah being a preacher doesn't make you a Christian being a strong leader doesn't make you a Christian you know hallelujah coming in this church doesn't make you a Christian no no no just as much as standing a garage doesn't make you a car you could be any environment but I'll escort to sunny for your life unless you receive him into your life unless you receive it inwardly willingly and openly oh it can't do nothing for you it won't have no effect on you it's not right come like they say a man a partner is only a pardon until it is accepted as a party isn't that right and that same story about that man who was sentenced to die the press president wrote a pardon for him and he didn't receive it he didn't believe that this part was for him and he rejected it and he went straight to the sentencing it is nice and it went to show that God could reach out but if you don't reach back and connect with him hallelujah it won't have no effect but God put something inside your soul tonight not even though millions don't hear him you have a receiver in your heart tonight you have the ability the pride has the ability to match to hear from God the day hear my voice harden not your hearts but come willingly oh honey I receive him openly tonight and he will bless you he said behold I stand at the door knock knocking on a door tonight where's the door the door is in your heart it's a tour of your heart tonight and Jesus himself it's knocking on the door of your heart tonight and he says if any man open the door and let me in I will come into him and I will sup with him and I would manifest my stuff to him oh he wants a manifest sense up to you I let you know now he is with you in your trial in your tests in your home in your situation wherever you are you will have the confidence the blessed assurance the know that Jesus is mine oh that he is yours in the wilderness in the valley in the shadow in the trial in the tests he is still God he is away maker oh holidays a love of your soul and even if he don't deliver we will not bow down to the lies of the enemy but we believe in our God that He loves us and he's our Father and he'll never see us comfortless he said I'll comfort you he'll be a comforter yes a little while I will see me no more but he said you will see me you will see me in this word here I'm gonna make this word more positive holiday every Sunday everything every Wednesday every

room and wait for the promise of God because there was another 3,000 I was supposed to be safe but it took 120 title to do what was necessary holid to create a space for God to move to make themselves available to make themselves hosts that God could come down in and he used as vessels of Honor fit for the Masters use oh and that's what God is looking for tonight vessels of Honor fit for the Masters use it don't have to be a lot it don't have to be done great number but we're the tools and trees I gather there he is in the Mitch he is the blessed there he is Sofia Phil there he is the
