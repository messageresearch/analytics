want just to be speaking words but we wanted to be inspired to them grant the anointing upon your word take me out of the way and me you be glorified in homage as our hearts desire it's just to point people to you have your way Lord in Jesus name and amen god bless you welcome this evening if their Bibles I'd like to take to portion of scripture proverbs chapter 23 verse 7 and send mocking 11:23 scripture reading / verbs 23 for as heating gets in his heart so is he eatin drink see it he to thee but his heart is not with thee and for mark 11:23 savour verily I say unto you but whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be no cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he says shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith may God bless his word you may be seated the continuation that same scripture is it was 24 it says therefore I said to you whatsoever things you desire when you pray you not speaking yet you just pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them so your believing that you get it before they get it we see believe that you shall receive them and you shall have them so that is really applying that prayer with faith believer is already done believe you have received it and you will receive it when you stand praying forgive if you have aught against any so that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you of your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses so it has FG just give the tuple first second pull next and the football so you see if you cannot speak but before you speak you have to pray and before you pray you have to forgive if you want to be in speaking condition you have to start with forgiveness when you pray after believe is already done the show is faith and believing that it's already done well if you believe is already done then you can wish him then you could praise God because you believe in your heart is already done then you could come in to speak in terms speaking condition because the devil don't want you to come and speak in condition never want to say you're a mope and any press somewhat not devil I want you to speak speak your healing speak your breakthrough streak your besan you don't want your speaking but you have to speak it because you see God Hawk was to speak it he said let there be light let there be a earth let us make man God at the speaker themself and we are sons of God we have to come in to speak in terms so it's not just God want you to hear hear hear go over here and converted to speak or glory to God so as a man thing in his heart so is he you have to think it a certain today of a title your thoughts your testimony your life your thoughts your testimony your life Baram says watch this he says that the human being was not metal lying lying is a deceitful Harting it's a evil thing I'd rather have a drunkard with me any day than a liar you're not a drunkard a motor smell I wait think about that now alaya could have good cologne and perfume in ER but drunkard smelling a liquor and he said he rather have a drunkard with him than a liar so if you put the lie detector on the person it will register negative every time because the human was not metal eye line is deceitful evil thing I rather have a drunkard me a liar a liar and your body wasn't me to lie so if it Eve something L said you see that no I did you can see it slow is the lion the machine was a ping ping ping lie lie lie lie like the machine will register lie because it picks up the subconscious level not yet conscious the subconscious level then what it picks up register on the machine is that right so listen is part so no matter how sinful you are you are still a fall Son of God the most sinful person in this city today God didn't intend you to be sinful he wanted you to be a son or daughter you made up the you are mirror in his own makeup but sinners caused you to do that and no matter how much you try to impersonate and try to make a lie see right they got scientific instrument to prove its wrong you can tell it with all the innocence you want to it's still register negative because it's a subconscious dong in the human being and that subconscious knows what is the truth so this speaking thing now have to do with the Hat if you shall say to the mountain be move and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you said so what is also seen is this if you believe and is activated from the subconscious level you can have it because is not intellectual that is truth from the inward parts you believe it yourself let me scum now if you believe you could speak and you can be here you could get it yourself because that's that intellectual belief now that is a faith from Kemeny from the soul and this is where get it from the man dear for if a man or woman could ever get their thoughts and their testimonies and their lives so line up with God until the channel of the Holy Spirit would be perfectly one with God what would take place your thoughts your life your testimony and the Bible said it overcame him my what by the word of their testimony and the blood of the Lamb you overcome by what the word of their testimony and your testimony is your confession what you come out your mode what you come out your Mochis your testimony you will all have that testimony and God want you to speak it or glory the can hold it in your head it have to come out of that testimony I believe God will heal me I have you over streaming I becau go and seal me I be God God will deliver my family that's your testimony come and give a testimony tonight I believe God will deliver me everyone will free me I will call the anointing of all gonna super than my house I believe everyone in that house will be delivered that's my testimony that's my confession and he's the high priests of your confession he cannot intercede unless you confess it you have to confess that you have it you have to believe it and pray fair be unbelieving receive it before you receive it and if you believe it and you receive it and you believe it will get it you're gonna praise God for it they will listen like a mope he will settle any pressure on the feet you would worship God because Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but for strong in faith giving glory to God and he didn't see Isaac yet in reality or give the Lord some praises he had Isaac my revelation in the socket of a soul it was so real yet he couldn't show searing it because she needed the same revelation to get down inside a system and God didn't talk to Sarah so I exact Abraham at something that Sarah did not have Oh glory to go that's why he could start not at the promise that's why he could be along with Sarah that's why he can understand your frustration her depression upset and dumbshit or give the Lord some praises or glory to God and when you get revelation like that you will understand your family condition they can see what you see you try to tell them tell them it have to be revealed or chlorine or qualities divine revelation and when that revelation strike them nothing will take that out or glow because yourself on this rock I'll build my church and the case of El Cap prevail against that that is when revelation break upon your soul and you'll give your mother backslide your father back where your husband backs like to fight back like you will not backslide because of Revelation has brick upon your very soul Oh glory to God passed on or pasta church or no church Daniel survived Shadrach Meshach and Abednego a survive David survived all the onshore from shore you gonna survive or god one of all the caves and intense destitute and afflicted of whom the world was not worthy hallelujah and they obtained a good report true fate let's continue many people come to be also to be freed for they have intellectual feet Oh lemon zest possible did therefore if a man woman could ever get their thoughts that testimony their lives she'll end up with the word until the channel of the Holy Spirit would be perfect with God what would take place if the man and the woman could ever get line up listen where would freedom from their hearts and I was no extra strings inside of the plane you have a Music Man in Saturday well your mom singing one thing and in band playing a different tune but that's what's going on here same time in the confessions and one thing I believe I speak to this mountain and yet the other bands saying my removing the monkey not gonna move because this man here this confession this testimony not lying upper body bands in when we ban in tune and he testimony in tune and your life and tune saying one tune mountain-moving demon runnin sickness believe in miracles taken place because everything line up [Applause] Oh blow half the lineup after lineup G David Joseph had dreams he give his testimony yeah kapa dream and yoga a testimony a dream I ain't saying nothing well then Joseph all those a story different Jews a brothers a no problems later but you know what give me problems the testimony I have a dream see them fellas Bowen and token I think he said ma he's giving each a Somali but them already in to predominate to pretend a dream co-op my boy to have only dreamin so his testimony was such that he was such a proper Chinese for Anika a code Finn so instead summer in on his life and everything else he's blessed love of the Father and the brothers said I get problems with him instead of they mind their own business and tenderly own garden and plant Daniel and they watch over Joseph London defined um corn green nights but they ask Avengers in more decon the fine Joseph lettuce growing nights but the s event rusev who Lenny hosted by the lettuce or talk to me whatever the lettuce is but they're given problems but eventually what did the SOL Joseph out and they push him to reject him but they was pushing him into his destiny because what God put in you the devil kept below remember what I know not not know know putting it in you remember what put your gifts in you before the foundation of the world everything that you have to have already in you God put it inside of you the spirit is now activate and what is already inside of you God and known thinking about you Hui for knew he called you only quality California you hear his thoughts on you or glory that God and he wants you to think just like him just as he had his thinking and his thoughts become a testimony by a word because I word has taught expressed so God was thinking and then he bring it about testimony the word form and said let there be let there be let there be so you're thinking after coming to our testimony going please master me somebody and you're thinking after line up at your testimony on your testimony after line up at your life [Applause] so your testimony caviar you ain't drinkin and on your life your boobs in a way because here we're gonna happen when you want to have feet and you test somebody say well you don't drink we're ready to drink and I decide nobody's seen this you and your private bottle and you would have the feet to approach God with any confidence for anything so God may as well take you off he can ask he can ask her ass she Kika ox you ask him because it's a formality lord give me a give me cause I give what you have to have oxford feet so somebody reports the caja rail feet there me askin but they Carol II really believe because they have a author and he said yeah when you stand praying forgive so because you can't forgive or you're not forgiving you're praying but it preys on you should write them to peel the here line you have here the parish and right on top this one have not receiving that when you drop your odds and begin to pray the Prince of the power of the air the demons that that Lodge on top are here over here the

vile the container that holds your prayer they're trying to make sure that don't get full up but you have to bond heaven yes you have to bust you ever no remember to brake you is not just break into it your moat it's break into Rams of demon power that's why you have to pray through prayer through postural stay until because you're actually fighting in the spirit realm it's not just words as fit it's not just words it's prayer is not just words it's sort of a thing going on [Applause] [Music] [Applause] see but over there can be serious dead serious scripted for that show check Daniel Daniel was status of the prion fast and when he said the prayer and faster why not Amish weeks he said at the angel Gabriel came to him and gave us said the reason that I say so long to get here it because while I on my way I was intercepted by some demon powers that I had a fight room and Bertrand revealed that if Gabriel had it Daniel stop praying in general stop coming Daniel previs bring in the angel so when you short your prayer until no one is ready to deliver and you stop arrange another stop and go back the Angelica tangle or glory the guardian angel on your way with your miracle the

you hang up your thoughts your testimony Oh hallelujah my give him some phrases [Music] [Applause] he II just just a little using my dissertation here I'll just call I didn't really plan to read about this really quickly this I'm Daniel chapter 9 in the first year of the reign of I Daniel understood by books the number of years where of the wood of the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in desolation of Jerusalem I set my face unto the Lord to seek by prayer supplication with fasting sackcloth and ashes so Daniel wasn't taken lightly he wanted an understood time i season so he tried to push goal in a serious manner a desperate manner since your mother these are Daniel a literature based on II Daniel and some demonically Daniel and some assembly this is I Daniel so then we begin to repent we have sinned have committed iniquity and done wickedly and I rebelled even by departmental precepts neither have we hacked Ananta like prophets and all Lord Russians belonging to under D under US confusion so he is praying he's confessing he is repentant we have sinned we have done wickedly and so on and then he said o Lord according to all thy righteousness ipcc let an anger and ib fury turn away from thy city Jerusalem the holy mountain because of our sins iniquity he's crying people don't know he's crying people don't know his sign he's on his own and he is pleading for God Oh Lord here Oh Lord forgive Oh Lord this is travel they not our Father who art in heaven that's not the flat prayer he's traveling Oh glory to God Oh Lord Harken do differ not for the own sake oh my god for thy City for I people are called by the name and whiles I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the Holy Mother my god while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I seen in a vision at the beginning because the end causes fly swiftly touched me about a time of the even oblation ohana don't miss that that power our Saturday coming at the beginning listen Gabriel speaking at the beginning of the supplication the commandment came forth that I am come to show thee for thou a gritty beloved deer for understand the matter oh my hallelujah praise then begin to speak to him o blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah do you love him freeze the name of the Lord he said enemy Fiona dawn annual is next chapter for the offal from the first day that doe did set that had to understand and to chastened I said before thy God thy words were heard and I am comfort I would that means Daniel prayer boss who Satan Kingdom basher them demon activity it was right shoe into heaven and heaven take note and heaven took action are you with me but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me 1 and 21 days three weeks but lo Michael one of the chief Prince's came to help me and I remain there with the kings of Persia and I am now come to make the understand what shall befall like people in the last days and yet the vision is for many days Oh hallelujah praise God for three weeks angels have to be fighting demon activity to bring a word to Daniel you know the angels fighting to bring war to Nozawa when brother Branham said hell the little hill as it uncovered and streams of demon powers loose on the earth they see them way back with Allah mascara and all the makeup he see that in hell what you see in physical know is what is having hell all the styles and fashions what they have in hell don't bring hell inside of here oh praise the name of the Lord glory to God hallelujah Oh is I'm going to hell and yet you know that is my service and church so possible i seventy you because heaven consists of the word I wasn't

Fiona peace be unto thee be strong here be strong and when he had spoken unto me I was strengthened what he ain't I said be strong be strong and when he spoke it I was straining hallelujah and he said let my lord speak for thou hast strengthened me then he said no it's dull wherefore I come unto thee and no will I return to fight with the Prince of Persia when I am gone lo the Prince of Greece I shall come all glory to God he said listen I had to go back now and have to go back after fights with the Prince of Persia aliens and fighting to come and enjoy fighting ago or chlorine over there is a realm of spirit realm that we have to deal with or claw read about the kingdom of God is more powerful than the kingdom of the enemy and your battle tonight is not against flesh and blood is like your son so and your daughter so is against principalities and powers then have your son show and your daughter show and we have to deal with them principalities and powers okay the Lord a shout is not this sickness and that sickness is the principalities and powers or glory to God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah glory you have to begin to see yourself as agents of the kingdom of God secret agents of the kingdom of God a big clash is about to take place oh and that casually manifested or glory no good Devils will be cast out it will be manifested all manner of sickness and disease could be healed it'll be manifested the kingdom of God versus the kingdom of Satan [Applause] [Music] let me wrap up Oh many people come to the altar to be prayed for they have intellectual feet they confess their sins and join a church my intellectual feet they believe it in their heart they're mine they believe it they could hear it they believe it because it knows the best policy but that's not what God looks for he don't look at your intellectual faith so if you have 99% intellectual faith and point one percent enjoy give Rick a hot feet God look I do 1 1 percent in you only one percent Rick tional Oh hallelujah have 99 percent fellowship in 99 percent discussion 99 percent understanding but praise God what the most important faith that's why you don't have to be even educated because education is up here but Revelation is down here that's right peace alone can be ignorant and unlearned you can have a doctorate and a degree up here but it's how much I have down here we thought almost Kazim and money if he had money is my money I'd wanted to the temple think about that now that's why is there no money if he had money all the years I'm going to implant in service normal normal when Peter pushed any pocket and I hear nothing but even for himself he said this a right I had to give him an something I have nothing I have no money to give him but I have something what I have Sylvan goal didn't buy that money didn't pay for that what I have I could give this a price up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ if I do our money or power I do our money I've hurt you I'd want money of the life of Christ I had no money of the anointed one more money but I have the faith that was once delivered to the Saints or kill the Lord a shout announced this is what God want in you [Music] so I wanted to show by that you have no excuse may be seated how much it will take from you to testify to somebody you do a Tom Waits as if I were or with a fire pit Arisa pee a wittle god I need a clock up to testify to somebody did have the driver driving you that the persons in our next in any Maxie you see MIMO passion you don't if you say morning to it have them truth start with good morning without money without trance you don't know who you testify into one time a woman and a burden that a revival she handled tracks everything I spray and whatnot nobody can just one boy you knew that I think was Wednesday with the one I mean with Moody was bright moody one if I was great moody but thank God wanted and he take it and put fire on me so when she thought she failed but on the one boy coming what's the right boy you don't know who you're telling me right man the right woman you keep into yourself more pain more pain but you have to overcome by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of your testimony some of you back still because you're not even testifying you're not even letting the devil know whose side you're on the mentalism ain't say nothing so press them some more my god so whatever job is do not isolate you and then posture I said again I shall it I'm just beat you is a mountain area dying they say nothing la pérouse an onion bell goes from our home I'll be outside waiting for you ain't talking about physical you know I talk much spiritually a better open your mouth I begin to testify you better open your mouth and say help me you better open your mouth and say pray for me you better open your mouth and say I'm in trouble you better open your mouth and don't stay there on your boil gettin bigger Gloriana to market and bigger no because that you mow in his roots or glory Jesus cursed the fig tree from the roots it tired from the roots that kids have to share from the roots oh yes that female condition that whatever condition had to travel the roots this church will have signs and wonders and miracles I ain't talking about no and again you know that's about every service [Applause] did you hear act every service deliverances every service Devils cast out every service or God basta my by the word every service you'll be liberated point three Holy Spirit coming on grub inside your heart look get out stop pull it out stuff [Applause] he looks at the heart so gone he didn't look at in terms of it I don't stay long it's a few minutes ago he doesn't look at your intellectual feet so I was happy I believe I believe I believe and I believe is a big big balloon on the intellectual side looking real big it was a good topic at the rich plenty and I'm so carried even before kinetochore cutting up simple allocation to apply the blood and Moses there was an application for exotic plant life that to put on it to put on any blood you know it was his Sofia to put it when they kill the lamb and take the blood what was the blood shall be applied so you can say I have a bucket of blood here boy you die with your bucket of blood because God has a walk with no bucket of blood no bucket that's for hornbooks when I look at that tapes he said take the blood and put it on the doorpost put it on the side post and when I see the blood not in the bucket [Music] should have a place inside out here come on I'll give the Lord a shout never places have your heart where the blood must be applied or glory to God God must hear not the pastor Matt the bishop God must see it inside a heart but in Moses time everybody can see it and everybody go sit upon YouTube because they will see that you are playing what you're hearing to door your life so that will bring your testimony on your life and line up all the time you say it about this but when you begin to apply what you believe then that makes a whole difference altogether that bucket identify you're ready to leave but this why you kill the lamb that is why you have the blood but no you have to apply what you believe even then is not good enough you have to apply what you believe when you take the blood and put it on the doorpost of the whole show just pitch white you just spend all your money - here's your host right and God said put the blood and if you're miserable you might want them like to learn bloody but Jase you want to live you will put that okay look like right bloody coronavirus right all right people right then go in panic mode actually panic move yet but it's wrong it's coming but he said come not near any man with that muck Oh hallelujah come back near any man with a Mack the seal of God and the seed of God is the Holy Ghost and every month because the asking God fill me with the Holy put that Mac upon me whatever you are to take to put on put him up I don't want no message map I don't want to brother night Mac I want the seal of God one the one that the angel from the east have that no faithful angel there's no man injured there is no pastor angel and the angel that the angel from these but the sealing angel the same answers the inkwon writer but in Ezekiel 9 put a mark [Music] do I have believers in the house why are people say Amen you have to say amen to that you know because this is your message no no man message moment a particular [Music] Laurie listen that devil not playing you know the disciples in the boat Jesus and the boat they'd ever see an opportunity to sink the boat the devil says kill him kill him no ticket no take them out he's sleeping he's sleeping you're not heavy sleeper Jesus top tired how many'd ever saw the rock that boat run storm coming No then these ever them think is that's normal stormy day rockin these are the sing specials but they don't know Fiat ready no but George's intellectual fair you know single specials somebody is somebody make a new song right I believe that's wrong but as always I reckon another one girl when they look up so but you're so strong mrs. budget otherwise somebody got a bright side with Jesus you say master wake up you see Paris because Jesus estimate not and never has been on water running whenever Jesus is a peace be still this is the first time the sea empowered challenging the elements itself how would you feel to be in that boat shaken up and a man just for peace how would you feel I would love to be there to see Jesus get back up and just for peace be still and watch that cultured angry eyes and see them cause fall up close up back up shop and leaver you know what is the you know what is ever says what manner of man is this that even the wind's obey Him or God we going back there but help me tonight god help me tonight we're going back here what my rosemarys this [Applause] [Music]
