[8:43] Amen wanna turn our Bibles to Genesis
[8:46] chapter 22 wanna read verse 1 to 18 of
[8:49] Genesis up to 22 it's so good to be back
[8:51] here and see all of you out amen
[8:57] Genesis chapter 22 verse 1 says and it
[8:59] came to pass after these things that God
[9:02] did tempt Abraham and said unto Him
[9:03] Abraham he said of them behold here he
[9:06] said take now thy son thine only son
[9:08] Isaac whom thou lovest like that get the
[9:13] internet I'm not the one I get into the
[9:18] land of Moriah offer him up there for a
[9:21] burnt offering upon one of the mountains
[9:23] which I will tell the earth if I'm Russa
[9:26] the leaner morning service assam took
[9:28] two of his young men with him and Isaac
[9:30] his son cleaved the wood for the burnt
[9:32] offering Rosa went up into the place of
[9:35] which God had told him they're gonna
[9:36] turn am I'm a little busy I saw the
[9:38] place afar off and Abram said unto his
[9:40] young men a baggie here good ass and I
[9:43] and the lad would go up yonder and
[9:45] worship and come down to you the Abraham
[9:48] took the wood the burnt offering lead
[9:49] upon Isaac his son he took the fire in
[9:52] his hand a knife went together both of
[9:54] them together and as I speak unto Abram
[9:56] his father and said My father he said
[9:59] here my my son he said Behold the fire
[10:01] and the wood but where is the lamb for a
[10:03] burnt offering and Abram said my son God
[10:06] will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[10:09] offering so they went both of them
[10:10] together they came to pass the place
[10:13] where God had told him and even built an
[10:15] altar there laid the wood in order
[10:17] bound Isaac his son Liam upon the altar
[10:19] upon the wood and ibrahim stretched for
[10:21] his hand took that knife to slay his son
[10:23] and the angel of the Lord called unto
[10:26] him out of heaven and said Abraham
[10:27] Abraham he said here am i he said lay
[10:30] not thine hand upon the lad neither do
[10:32] anything unto him for now I know that
[10:34] thou fearest God she endures not
[10:37] withheld thy son
[10:38] thine only son from me and Abram lifted
[10:42] up his eyes and looked and behold behind
[10:44] him a ram caught in a thicket by his
[10:46] horns Abram went and took the RAM
[10:48] offering up a blood offering instead of
[10:50] his son and Abram called the name of the
[10:52] place do-over Tyra as it is said to this
[10:55] day in the month of the Lord it shall be
[10:57] seen and the angel of the Lord called
[10:59] the Abraham out of heaven the second
[11:01] time and said by myself have I sworn she
[11:04] has the Lord for because that was done
[11:07] this thing and hast not withheld thy son
[11:09] and only Son that in blessing I will
[11:12] bless thee in multiplying I will
[11:14] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[11:15] heaven as the Sun which is upon the sea
[11:17] shore and thy seed shall possess the
[11:20] gate of his enemies and in thy seed
[11:21] shall all the nations be blessed because
[11:24] I was obeyed my voice may God bless his
[11:26] word you may be seated
[11:27] who praise God this exhortation we push
[11:30] communion table and the title of the
[11:33] rang is because that was done this thing
[11:35] those words were spoken before because
[11:39] there was done this thing the Garden of
[11:42] Eden man felt was it because thou has
[11:44] done this thing you disobey my voice get
[11:48] kicked out that's what we agree here
[11:50] were people dying because that was done
[11:53] this thing but this is a different thing
[11:54] that was done here
[11:55] this was a man that was inspired by God
[11:58] yet inspiration to hear for the voice of
[12:01] God this man called Abraham and I choose
[12:04] to bring this as an emphasis because
[12:06] there's something that you have to do
[12:08] not because you have said this thing
[12:10] because you have done this thing because
[12:14] once it just reveals has to be tested
[12:16] once is reveal it has to be tested like
[12:20] 10 percent say Amen
[12:21] the others meditation of the food a date
[12:24] I don't know but once it has been
[12:26] revealed it has to be tested that's what
[12:29] God does
[12:30] he tests because he want the best and
[12:33] the test Springs are the best in you and
[12:35] I only the test could do that I want to
[12:39] say it again the test bring out the best
[12:40] what if the students is who got no tests
[12:43] promoted from for one the form to the
[12:45] treat of water 5 what don't have money
[12:47] in there from 5 what would happen in job
[12:50] market
[12:51] the test filters the best from the rest
[12:55] the testers back and the tests provide
[13:00] the cue to send the person to the higher
[13:03] level
[13:03] so as you pass this test of faith you
[13:06] could rule the virtue mental knowledge
[13:08] then to temperance and patience and
[13:10] godliness there's every level of a test
[13:12] because one want the best at the top of
[13:14] it see it I'm not getting less Satan a
[13:17] delusion less than his best he has
[13:19] illusions best forces in this last day
[13:20] the challenge the bride two hundred
[13:23] thousand Thousand Devils coming loose
[13:25] against this bride don't have to lose
[13:27] his best also or glory to God so God
[13:30] bring the nobodies the people that they
[13:32] look like they are bright the people
[13:34] that have this condition that condition
[13:36] he chose you that you chose Gideon like
[13:39] it was just I don't mass and Sampson
[13:41] like he chose all them who was a faith
[13:43] there wasn't looking like the people
[13:45] that were supposed to be but God made
[13:46] them it's not what you look at is what
[13:49] you have to become it's what you have to
[13:51] be designed into I love em people study
[13:54] destiny but called I study destiny a lot
[13:57] of people really live for the know but
[13:59] God has studied beyond the know that's
[14:01] why the words were spoken in blessing I
[14:03] will bless thee and multi-planar
[14:05] multiply thee and I see took my destiny

[25:07] from darkness and the light from death
[25:09] unto life from formal intellectual
[25:12] conception of Christ to the warning and

[29:05] Joe do you have no Bible to read
[29:07] he went only by inspiration and he only
[29:11] waited for this especially striking
[29:12] he knew what he said would happen
[29:14] because it was an inspiration that's
[29:16] what the church if it is in order set in
[29:19] order it's got a mechanics ready it only
