us this morning amen well greetings in jesus name amen we feel his presence here this morning and that's very very important to us because debt to be outside of his presence is life to be in his presence and we have to press and break through to be in to his presence and his presence is here because the blood is here blood is what is covering you that's what the seventh on this is all about blood perfect standing that you could know that you have been redeemed that you're justified you haven't made it true yet naturally but you already made it and it's thinking this mind is already done when he paid for you he paid for all of you your soul your spirit and your body i say that again when he died and paid for you he beat for your soul he redeemed your soul you redeem your spirit you're going to redeem your body hallelujah when he died he paid for you all of you he will redeem all of you your imagination your conscience your memory all of that will be covered by spirit by power to redeem your physically hallelujah you'll be completely redeemed total and complete redemption redeemed by power redeemed by blood redeemed by fire but redeemed anyway all glory thou has redeemed us unto god and as made as kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth how many feel like raining this morning ruling this morning overcoming this morning being straightened in the inner man this morning that's what they're here for this morning to be edified to be built up to be strengthened oh glory hallelujah amen thank you musician amen praise god blessed be the name of the lord well i know you're in for a blessing this morning but anthony gonna be preaching to us this morning amen i appreciate anthony oh god has blessed him and a special blessing to me and the church i know you bless him amen thank god for the gifts and talents that god has placed among us and just want to read something here before he comes on from god keeps his word he said in here and long ago the lutherans did have the torchlight to the world what happened if you would run out in the world you look to run people at one time at the first reformation what happened to you your light what what what did it go out this is the reason it went out is because you left god's word you believe that joshua led by faith absolutely the truth then along came the methodists and they had the torchlight of resignification you did hold the torchlight a great revival that's true but what happened what happened to the methodist church because you let the light out your pre-signification second worker grace and then came the pentecostal with the restoration of gifts and they made a doctrinal to that what happened your light's gone out what's the matter is because you feel to stay with the word so when we feel to the stay with the word the light goes out i'll say it again when you fail to say with the word light goes out watch god words will unfold in here we go and we must unfold as god word unfolds we must unfold as god word unfolds as time unfolds as signs unfolds this man is the same man he was six thousand years ago when god made him sementa intellectual same intelligence he's the same man with the same senses that he was thousands of years ago but look at the progress that he has made in the past 50 years look what the fallen sons of god has did automobiles radio electric lights atomic bombs and here the church back some old church creed stand there when god listen wants us to unfold the word this is what god wants us to do your life to unfold the word so you will be truly be a written epistle rather known of all men and somebody asked by the brahmana and these seven thunders when is revealed will it be something to get us closer to god he said no it's something that they missed back there because people were looking for instant cure they're looking for some way to avoid place of trying to avoid the death of a corn or wheat so they taught do they know all mysteries and they have all knowledge they have everything only the final paul already handled that he still say you need charity so the information or knowledge or revelation that's not good enough you have to die out still and paul said it i die daily you have to repent still you have to humble yourself still isn't that right he said now watch he said we are back he said now watch he said what it is grace we should be unfolding god's spirit pouring out not just one little gusher not just one little baptism but baptism after baptism not a revelation joshua by faith or signification or the gifts of spirit but revelation after revelation power after power glory after glory for we ought to be way up the road ready for translation so that is what god wants unfolded revelation after revelation power after power glory after glory in other words we get in rapture and condition to get out of here praise god as we get press in our way we're supposed to see the satan grip on our life loosed praise god he's supposed to be relaxing his hand when he having a luck jock jawed here to lock you up here we supposed to be he'll see it and break in his hands because you are getting more powerful remember the devil cannot get any stronger but you can i'm not hearing you this morning praise god hallelujah hallelujah praise god amen amen praise be to jesus hallelujah so we're supposed to be unfolding the word power after power revelation after revelation not depression after depression and frustration after frustration and fed up after fed up not that oh hallelujah are you with me oh blessed be the name of the lord praise his holy name hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord say love him this morning praise god so we supposed to be unfolding that word twisting and hungering for god and brother braham said the intellectual cannot in any way bring any person to god the intellect he's talking about and he spoke about the lie detector that connects with the condition of the soul not the mind but the heart i think we're talking about it tuesday night and when you connect that like detected and actually question your line the machine starting to make us say that noise like light light light light light start to see a lie and you're lying you're lying because even though you're talking soft even talking words and whatnot the pressure goes up you you know you're lying yourself and the machines say you're lying too so there's a confirmation choose a witness you know and mushy no so therefore he was saying the intellect doesn't govern that channel so when somebody dies the intellect breaks up all the thinking oh what the money they have on the degrees and how people see them in the world and you know your reputation all that breaks up because at the intellectual level but the soul start to raise up so before god and the soul is the condition that comes right up to face god not what you believe you believe whatever you want to believe i believe the apostle creed how'd he catholic say that believe in holy mary and what not mother of god that is just belief that's here but your soul is what grace up to god remember you're not an animal you have a body you have a spirit you have a soul the intellect is what breaks up hallelujah god takes the heart the devil takes the head let's cut off that head intellectual and let's start to believe what god couldn't do for us in our heart it has to come back to your heart as a man think in his heart so is he not so much as head what you want in your heart you want a revival this morning you got you got it you want a breakthrough this morning you got it if you have that in your heart you want to be changed this morning you got it oh glory to god so watch it seems to me and by the word god could only work within his laws even on earth and now he said it before that when abraham lied and abraham say was his sister and the king wanted to take abram a wife to be white because she was so beautiful god shut up the wombs in that house and said listen restore that prophet his wife and let him pray for you that that could lift off of you in other words god was working through a certain system and you can't break that system god's going to walk to the brine and you can't break that either i'll say this we're going to work through you and you can't break that either that means god going to get you in condition by any means hallelujah are you going to get you in condition you've got to get in condition that means the word have to be opened up to you which word are you ready your my words a bomb this morning you're wondering where we are going with that right which word your word because when your word come yo would come until his word came the word of the lord tried him but when joseph word come nobody could keep you in prison not when your word come that word come to get you out of prison that would come to set the captive free that would come to heal the sick that would come to raise the dead when your word come no devil could hold you back when you're overcome y'all come could we give the lord a shout i pray glory to god amen hallelujah i'm finishing around john the baptist had to wait for the call to go in the wilderness he knew he was different because he had a different name from zechariah hezekiah whatever ayah or whatever it is his name was called john he made a name all together but he had to get the call to go into wilderness to become the voice of one crown of wilderness his word had to come to place him positionally where he's supposed to be his word had to come and when his word come nobody could stop him from going to wilderness he knew once he hit the wilderness messiah is on his way because he had to come from the wilderness to introduce messiah and you have to come from the wilderness to return in the power of the spirit when you hit the wilderness you know power is coming when you're in calvary you know power is coming when you hit the death of a corner wheat come on now dynamics is to drive the people to calvary i'm 10 in the rapture you know you're getting somewhere when you are dying and christ is coming to life that they have to take a hold upon you and that is separation rotten brings forth the new bird so first the dead comes to cut it off the tree and then it falls on the ground on your rock you're right to this you rot to that we have to die and i know that haven't struck the bride yet this thing called death people want a free ticket like a passport just put a stamp in your book you move through but unfortunately there's a program that god have and that program said activate virtue and to virtue knowledge and we cannot get around this program no matter how much we try every time you think about it that's it that's you there see you don't know that's you yet because that wouldn't come to you the way it's supposed to come here when that would open to you you will want that just to be you not your ungodliness but godliness not your impatience but that's you dear that's your word express that's what you have to become that's what you're striving into you're striving to be the statue of a perfect man that is you i am telling you that's you that hateful anger temper and you have psychological problem and all kind of problem that's not you that's just mind games and that's just all kind of crazy stuff and hereditary stuff forget about that that's you there that's what you have to become and you're shy that's not you this is you yeah this this this what is that to you that's what you're going to become hallelujah and you become what you behold hallelujah we see in a glass and then praise god face oh we become what we behold you have to see a reflection to become that you see the reflection is the perfection not the talking not the preaching the reflection is the perfection these virtues have to be reflected anthony going to come to us now oh hallelujah these virtues have to live i know you'll be hearing that but it's the truth you see we think confession is going to live confession means uh saying we believe this and that's our confession our testimony and so on but you see the authority to believe doesn't give you the authority to live a lot of people believe a lot of things and they're not living anything to do with what they believe it doesn't even connect because believing have to do with intellect but life have to do with the heart hallelujah that's why jesus could ask the wonder well go call your husband question she had a choice she had a choice to play mind games with him and she had a choice to speak the truth she chose to speak the truth he said you speak the truth and you had five and the one you're living with is not yours and that's what god wanted he wanted her heart to speak a lot of us we have not yet come to the place that we could speak our hearts and for ministers they don't even want honest conversation they're not supposed to speak you're supposed to say tremendous every message is tremendous more tremendous most tremendous tremendous tremendous tremendously management but that's not so that's not true some message doesn't be trending at all it has to be disturbing and troubling and troublesome and and make your spirit get funny up because it's not tremendous and that's the truth and that's what we have to come place to no truth i want to be edified i want to be built up i want to be strengthened when i leave here i want to know i could run after the devil i said get out i want to hear i want to leave you i feel like an overcomer i want to leave you and feel like jacob my man get wrestle and get power with god that's what i want to feel i want to feel strengthening in a man that i can go back and hear my fussing wife or my car with some husband i could be here with them and have patience with them you don't have patience that everybody is is is ripped you and what not patience when things are nazi and all things are upset and you have the patience then you can say whoa that's something there hallelujah hallelujah you don't need to talk about temperance everybody real cool when everybody's upset and hot-headed and you demonstrate temperance that is when it thunders so you're not looking for everything to be nice know these virtues are nothing nice times these virtues are from troubleless time in the last days trouble as time shall come my god hallelujah read the gospel this morning and in the troubleless time it must stand and rock the devil when they think you'll be angry peaceful words peace be still the storm that was angry but jesus said peace be still go back and sleep let's sing it is all over me and it's keeping me alive it is all over me and it's keeping me alive oh keeping me alive with keeping

so praise god we thank god for all things amen and um praise god i won't take too much of your time this morning but i have a short quick message amen so let's turn to our bibles amen as we go to genesis i want to read from genesis genesis chapter 1 isaiah 60 and you also want to read ii peter 1. amen second peter 1 verse 16 so amen so you can find genesis 1 we'll start from there amen genesis 1 and verse 1 says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning with the first day let's go over now to isaiah 60. reading from verse 1. amen isaiah 16 and verse 1 amen which says arise and shine arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising amen let's go over last later ii peter 1 verse 16 will just read what three or four scriptures 16-19 amen there praise god second peter 1 and verse 16 amen says uh for we have not followed amen second peter 1 16 says for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from god the father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount we have also a more sure word of prophecy where unto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the daystar arise in your hearts may lord have a blessing to his word let's just bow our heads for word of prayer heavenly father lord we just read the scripture lord we know no man could make an interpretation to this scripture so father we pray lord your holy spirit will come down lord father and rightly divide the word here this morning lord in such a powerful way lord that it would shake lord even shake the gates of the enemy this morning lord may your presence be unfolded here this morning in a mighty way a lord made a light push back to darkness this morning roll back the doubts and unbelief this morning may the glory of god come shining through in here even the baptism of the holy ghost to seal the elect into the kingdom of god granted almighty god take me out of the way this morning make me a servant this morning and hide me in your cross lord that your words may speak granted lord in jesus name amen and amen you may be seated praise god man now it's okay to shout now amen it's okay to please god amen he many men hallelujah do you love him this morning amen amen you know what you came for you come to worship this morning amen you come to praise god hallelujah hallelujah you come to declare your atmosphere hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah come to let the devil know whose side you're on you come to let the god know that you mean business hallelujah praise god amen amen is that right amen amen hallelujah you're a royal cease of abraham hallelujah so there's an authority in you praise god amen to declare your atmosphere to declare your season to declare your time hallelujah hallelujah god raised you up for such a time as this so that you could declare what season and what day that we are living in hallelujah holland jesus said i am the light amen i said you also are the light of the world hallelujah isn't that right so we come as light bearers this morning hallelujah because it you're gonna find out this morning that it takes the lights to declare what day we are living in praise god because god called a light day and he called the darkness night hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen so for my title this morning amen as we get into it amen i'm trying not to build too long with you but my title this morning amen is let there be light and my subject amen my subject arise shine for thy light has come my inspiration called out separated anointed and commissioned amen and amen hallelujah praise god amen so are you ready this morning amen hallelujah amen well let's start this morning at the beginning amen hallelujah that's a good place to start amen holly let's start out over in genesis oh amen when god created the heaven and he created the earth amen right in that very moment time begin to unfold amen isn't that right he created the earth amen and the earth began to move when the prophet began to talk about how the earth was moving but there was darkness amen you couldn't see anything praise god hallelujah there was darkness upon the deep darkness upon the waters the mist rolling over the waters of the earth there was nothing there praise god isn't that right holy there's no manifestation of life there was no manifestation of hallelujah of god on the earth but the earth was there the prophet said laying in the earth was all the seeds that was the comfort oh same and somebody holy spirit is already here glory to god you know who i'm talking about praise god where were you when the sons of god shouted for joy you was there hallelujah praise god and in the earth was a seed in itself to reproduce itself lordy many many many men oh i'm talking to the seeds this morning i'm talking to the seeds that was spoken amen in the beginning hallelujah you will stare praise god hallelujah isn't that right we have representation this morning by this morning that's why something inside of us just won't give up something inside of us just won't let go every service every service give me my mountain give me my mountain oh hallelujah you have a right to be victorious this morning because there's a seed in your soul that's the greatest gift that you could have this morning oh hallelujah i'm not talking about the holy ghost yet i'm talking about the sea down in your soul because when the holy ghost comes it's coming to ignite that seed and make that seed live fake fruit you know temperance amen amen that's what you're looking for that's what we are under expectation for hallelujah for that seed to take on life for the light to strike the seed you'll never be the same again amen young people when you come into the presence of the shakkainer glory when you come into the presence of that light you'll never be the same again you never walk the same you never talk the same hallelujah hallelujah demons will be running demons will be screaming running from young people who have seen the light hallelujah there is a pride on the earth hallelujah that is standing in the presence of that light this morning oh he many many man thank you jesus hallelujah amen so we back in the beginning here was the earth was moving and in the earth with the seeds waiting to come forth in their day but there was no light to declare their day so in order to declare the day there had to be light that's why that's the first thing that god declared when he saw everything in its void and his darkness everything in its chaos and his confusion you couldn't make head or tail of it amen amen but a voice can be gonna speak out which was the expression that come out of the logos word what did that voice say let there be light hallelujah and the darkness was upon the earth began to push back the chaos that was upon the earth begin to push back all the negative began to push back because a positive was coming a positive was coming a positive was coming i don't care how you feel this morning i don't care how much darkness this morning i don't care how much confusion is being pushed back it's being pushed back because the positive is coming are greater than solomon is here this morning glory to god to declare the light unto you this morning to call a light day on the colder darkness tonight okay we're going somewhere hallelujah that's for sure we're going somewhere amen amen our ship wasn't meant to stay on the harbor it was meant to seal the rugged seas hey many man so we're not sitting around in a harbor this morning we're on the rugged seas this morning we're taking a turn of the tide this morning but we're going somewhere we're going somewhere there's a place that god wants you to be hallelujah a place of adoption a place of perfection hallelujah hallelujah yay many man praise god hallelujah amen amen so we're still in the beginning amen so so god spoke let there be light and there was light amen when god saw the light he said it was good oh hallelujah it's a good thing to be in the light hallelujah you are not of them that walk in darkness hallelujah hallelujah when jesus came on the scene the bible said them that sat in darkness saw a great light hallelujah praise god and his lights praise god was a life of man hallelujah and when the darkness saw it they didn't understand it that's why jesus amen i admire jesus how he used to move he didn't move with the crowd of that day the crowd of that day was the pharisees and the sadducees and them who was great uh studios of the bible and so on but he wasn't moving in that realm he was in a different realm he wasn't in that ecclesiastical realm with those kinds he was in that intellectual realm with those fellas he was somewhere else lost in the spirit hallelujah i do nothing except the father show me that's why he could find himself somewhere at the 11th hour sitting at a well waiting for our ill-famed woman hello ain't many many man the bible says she was ill-famed holly i can imagine what she looked like i could imagine how she used to dress and carry about herself she probably wasn't the kind of woman that you would like to be seen hanging around with hallelujah but her name was on the book she was a seed that was in itself in the earth hallelujah hallelujah she was waiting to be called out she waited to be separated she was waited to be anointed to go into the upper room but she had to wait oh hallelujah i don't know how long she waited the bible said she had five men and the one that she was with was not her own a little but she was waiting on something she was destined for something or one day she come to the well it looked like an ordinary day because that's normally the hour that she would come to the well hallelujah and jesus hallelujah had his gps set up because he knew when she would leave home he knew when she would take the maxi hallelujah when she would take the car coming down the road so elohim positioned his lights at the well because he knew that there was a sea to be called out in our time inner season praise god hallelujah her day had come glory to god and your day is here this morning i don't care how you feel i don't care how you woke up this morning we are here to declare the light day and the darkness night praise god hallelujah let's cast off the work of darkness let us put on the arm of light amen i'm just floating this morning wherever god wants me to move out that's where i move amen amen but he spoke to the woman at the well he said woman yahweh cometh when the true worshipers will worship the father and spirit and in truth because they will have the light of the revealed word to declare their hour and their season hallelujah he said the hour come and now is when the true worshipers will worship the father i declare that now is that our now is that day jesus said on that day you shall know i am in the father you and me and i and you the light is here to declare the day oh hallelujah get a little praise amen glory hallelujah so god saw that the light was good amen and he separated the light from the darkness he called a light day and he called the darkness light so right there we see that god caused a separation between a light and a darkness amen there are things that are of the light and then there are things that are of the darkness amen young people you have to know which is which and the word will show you what is light and the word will show you what is darkness that's why you have to be in the word i like whatever it said earlier amen from the quotes amen he said if the light leaves amen amen you're in darkness amen however you have to leave your word you're in darkness so you have to come to your word isn't that right hallelujah that you'll not walk in darkness amen because we are not children of the darkness we are the children of the light hallelujah you are called to this glorious light amen light hallelujah praise god i sprung up amen isn't that right hey many man okay what do i do here now i want to read a story here brother branham spoke amen i'll read okay amen i'll read this story here but abandon spoke on a message turn on the light amen it's big at the very beginning of the message and he said something and it really struck me and i'll just read it he says uh you know mr mcconnelly i think he's present i see his truck outside some time ago he said we're setting one of my first trips here to arizona to go hunting and we were sitting out there near the superstitious mountain he said and i heard of it for a long time and heard of many of the legends that have been told about the superstition i remember looking for it the first time and it was before day so it was it was it was still dark so it's before day and he said and a great ghostly shadow hung at the east of me which was known as the superstition and i heard about the indians how they would they wouldn't go near it how they were afraid how the spanish had mistreated them in the early days and they were hunting gold and so on and they claimed that these evil spirits were living in it and all this stood my curiosity but i only had a flashing light to see the superstition at first so and then i watched until after a while the the majesty of the sun began to move upon the darkness and when it did it separated the darkness from the light and pressed the darkness back finally she raised to her highness up over the top of the mountain talking about the sun and it showed superstition just what it was it all lit up and showed what it was and all the spooks and fears that i had of superstition when the sun was shining in its power upon it it fled away he said the sun is the king of all the lights on this earth in the natural lights no matter how much artificial light that we have and how many great electric rays that we can produce when that sun rises all the rest of them dim out oh hallelujah hallelujah is that right and i feel like today we're living in an age of a lot of superficial lights a lot of superficial lights hanging around here and there amen and it was prophesied that many will come in my name and say i am christ and deceive many superficial lights isn't that right but he said amen when that sun rises all of the rest of them dim out that's the same thing it is with the word of god oh here we go now he said when the word of god rises he said all superstitions denominational fanaticism and fantasism and things spread away and it just shows just exactly what it is god in the beginning said let there be light and the light only comes he said the true light the king light comes by the word of god and god separated the light from the darkness in the beginning and the word of god listen to this now said the word of god made manifest always separates the light from the darkness hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the word of god i'll say that again the word of god made manifest always separates the light from the darkness hallelujah so what are we waiting on a manifestation we've had a revelation for a long time coming on to something coming on to something what are we coming on to a manifestation and when a word of god is manifested one day your word will come to you one day you're gonna rise up the son of god hallelujah will rise up inside of you that day star arising in your hearts hallelujah one of these days you're gonna be known as you are known and you're gonna manifest the same life the same signs the same wonders the same miracles that he manifested and when that word of god is manifested it will separate the light from the darkness oh hallelujah there's a lot of darkness in this message there's a lot of darkness and confusion going around what are we looking for a manifestation of the word of god for this hour a manifestation of the word of god for this day to separate the light from the darkness so you mean to tell me brother anthony there's another ministry coming they are going to separate the light from the darkness how about manifestation of the world to declare the light of their hour and their day to call the light day at the colder darkness night hallelujah amen do you believe that praise god that's what it's about amen okay i want to switch over here now amen please go on hallelujah he many man do you love him hey man are you enjoying the word so far amen priest god okay all right so let me read this here now says from god god's word called for total separation said now in the beginning genesis 1 3 said we find that there was darkness amen upon the earth amen and the spirit of god moved upon the water and said let there be light and there was light and god saw that the light was good and god separated the light from the darkness so the word of god began to separate the light from the darkness from the beginning um says so does it remain till this day he said now when the earth okay when god was going to use the earth and it was in total darkness the spirit of god spoke out and said let there be light and he separated the light from the darkness and it has been doing that ever since separating light from darkness god's word also separated the water from the land in the beginning god spoke and the water was separated from the land amen land this way and water this way is that right said so that he and he had a reason for that and god never speaks a word unless he's got a reason for speaking that word he says he's not like you and i we just he said we speak so many foolish things he said but god speaks every word with a meaning and with something that he's trying to achieve and will achieve it by his word and it will perform exactly what it will do amen isn't that right so if god sends out a word there's a a mission for it to accomplish there's something that it has to achieve it is not a mindless order amen amen is not some chaos amen hallelujah is a word spoken in due season how pleasant and how good it is amen we have a word in our season we have a word for our day isn't that right praise god hallelujah hallelujah amen brother was talking earlier he said joseph when he come the word of the lord tried him until his word came that same word tried him amen amen he knew he was to come into a position of power isn't that right he knew he was to come into a position of authority but he had to die hallelujah to his intellect die to his beliefs die to all that he thought he was a many man hallelujah and stay in the glory of that light until become beaked out until he become ripened hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah until something in him die hallelujah hallelujah praise god isn't that right hallelujah then his word come amen isn't that right hallelujah so the word of god will accomplish isn't that right he said no if god said let there be light and there was no light then he said that it wasn't god said said that wasn't god that said that see said when god says anything he must back up what he says must back up what he says oh is that why when joshua was waiting around jericho and god told him that he was gonna take the land and occupy the land and joshua knew hallelujah that god was with him joshua was waiting on something what was he waiting on he was waiting on backup joshua was staying there praying and in the spirit and then all of a sudden backup came with a short drawn in his hand and he said stay your blade joshua i am the unseen captain of the host i am here to show you how to take the land i am here to show you how to take jericho praise god god's word will all he was always back up what he said hallelujah he said behold i have sent my angel before thee praise god here was that angel manifested to back up the word hallelujah that god gave joshua amen amen hallelujah said moses my servant is dead now therefore joshua take this people

that right could it be that we're standing in a pride age right now the bride age has already gotten started hallelujah hallelujah we are living in our age we are living in a day isn't that right we
