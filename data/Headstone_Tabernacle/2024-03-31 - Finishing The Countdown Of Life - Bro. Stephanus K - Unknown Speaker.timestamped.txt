[20:36] morning reading from St Mark 16 and
[20:40] reading
[20:41] from verse one St Mark
[20:44] 16 verse
[20:46] one and when the Sabbath was passed Mary
[20:50] Magdalene and Mary the mother of James
[20:52] and salomi had bought sweet spices that

[22:47] amen you may be seated in the presence
[22:50] of the Lord this morning and happy
[22:52] Easter he is risen he is risen he's
[22:55] alive forever more if there was ever a
[22:58] reason to shout it's today if there ever
[23:00] was a reason to worship it's today if
[23:02] there ever was a time to be reminded
[23:05] that God is a god of the impossible it's
[23:08] Easter Sunday morning and I trust you're
[23:10] not in church just because it's Easter
[23:12] but because you have a revelation that
[23:14] we are in a time of the resurrection and
[23:16] we are in the time of a change that's
[23:18] about to happen where this Mortal will
[23:20] put on immortality and because he rose
[23:22] from the dead we are also promised some
[23:25] transformation in our own lives because
[23:27] he said because I live you are going to
[23:30] live also so the promise was not just
[23:32] about him being raised from the dead but
[23:34] the promise is unto you and to your
[23:36] children we shall be changed uh oh
[23:39] there's going to be an exchange of your
[23:41] sadness for gladness there's going to be
[23:43] a exchange of your sorrow into joy
[23:46] unspeakable and full of Glory there's
[23:49] going to be an exchange from depression
[23:51] and frustration into Joy oh there's
[23:54] going to be an exchange of the frown on
[23:56] your face a smile and there's going to
[23:59] be an exchange of your doubt of Faith
[24:01] there's going to be an exchange of your
[24:03] sickness into being healed there's going
[24:06] to be an exchange of you being a church
[24:08] member into a body into the Bride of
[24:11] Jesus Christ there's going to be a
[24:13] transformation of young people who are
[24:15] just coming to church to young people
[24:18] who are the Bride of Jesus
[24:20] Christ who will stand under pressure you
[24:24] may be seated oh and we heard it last
[24:26] night overcoming in the absence
[24:29] Hallelujah overcoming when you're alone
[24:32] overcoming when the pastor is not there
[24:34] overcoming when the Elder is not there
[24:36] overcoming when the Deacon is not there
[24:39] overcoming when mommy is not there
[24:41] overcoming when you feel all alone
[24:43] Hallelujah overcoming when all hell is
[24:45] against you overcoming as David said if
[24:48] I make my bed in hell it doesn't matter
[24:51] where you find me it doesn't matter what
[24:53] I'm going through God has giving you a
[24:55] backbone and a spine that you can res
[24:58] resist every obstacle every challenge
[25:01] every
[25:03] problem you may be seated and what gives
[25:06] us the power to do this is not our own
[25:09] strength it's because he did it Easter
[25:12] proved it was possible Easter proved
[25:15] that you could be dead and something
[25:17] raises you up again Hallelujah before
[25:20] Easter I could understand you will
[25:22] wonder if it is possible but Easter
[25:25] settled the
[25:27] question
[25:29] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[25:31] Lord so I'm not the preacher this
[25:34] morning how many appreciate our precious
[25:36] brother
[25:37] stephanus what a gift what a love gift
[25:40] that God sent our way and to to have
[25:43] been blessed by the services and then by
[25:45] the yadel dropping in and uh bringing
[25:47] his greetings and how it all tie
[25:49] together and how we see the Lord in
[25:50] control so we thank the Lord so on
[25:54] behalf of the pastor as you know he's in
[25:55] Ivory Coast he would have preached
[25:57] yesterday and I saw the message
[25:59] yesterday and uh he spoke this morning
[26:01] so I want to greet you on behalf of the
[26:03] pastor and certainly welcome you to the
[26:04] house of the Lord Brother surra s Andie

[26:25] presence of the Lord he is he wants to
[26:27] make everybody feel com comfortable he
[26:28] wants everybody to be welcome in his
[26:30] presence we serve a welcoming God you
[26:32] know we serve a God who who wants to
[26:34] meet you as an individual and speak to
[26:36] you as an individual we are not here to
[26:38] hear man we are here to hear from God
[26:41] hallelujah my desire is that ministers
[26:44] be microphones so God can speak through
[26:47] we don't have our thoughts we don't have
[26:48] our ideas we just want to be the
[26:50] microphone and be so surrender that God
[26:53] could speak and only what he once said
[26:55] is what is said because that's what is
[26:57] needed the spoken word as the original
[26:59] seed to call your name from in the book
[27:01] and the church say
[27:04] Amen so before brother stephanus comes

[43:03] desire when he fall usah was was a good
[43:06] King and they had much Fellowship
[43:08] together and they were Fellowship
[43:10] together and but uh somehow usah get out
[43:13] of the way and and it really touched
[43:15] Isaiah and his heart and he said where
[43:17] can I go but unto the Lord and he went
[43:20] into the temple of God and God opened a
[43:23] vision for him God opened the word to
[43:25] him he gave him he gave Isaiah a vision
[43:28] and when Isaiah saw a vision of the king
[43:31] of glory sitting on the throne after
[43:34] perhaps a resurrection when asiah saw
[43:37] that Vision praise the Lord of him on
[43:40] the throne praise the Lord he said I'm
[43:42] am unclean I am a man of unclean lips
[43:45] and I dwell among men of unclean lips
[43:49] praise the Lord but God sent an angel
[43:51] down here with a coal of fire and he
[43:53] touched the lips and then Isaiah was
[43:56] ready for commission who shall I send
[43:59] Lord sent me praise the Lord when we get
[44:03] a revelation when we get a open vision
[44:06] of Calvary of the king of King sitting
[44:09] on the throne praise the Lord he takes
[44:12] all our sin away praise the Lord and
[44:14] then he sends you with a commission
[44:16] praise the Lord amen so I just wanted to
[44:19] say that I couldn't say that yesterday
[44:21] evening amen praise the Lord and what
[44:24] can we say about yesterday evening
[44:26] praise praise the Lord about the
[44:28] presence of God and uh and it humbles me
[44:31] to see how the presence of God is in the
[44:33] midst among his people amen and how he's
[44:36] working and doing a work of Grace in our
[44:39] lives praise touching Us Praise the Lord
[44:42] changing us transforming us from Glory
[44:45] unto Glory unto glory amen praise the
[44:48] Lord so we have been speaking yesterday
[44:51] about the absence and finishing of the
[44:54] absence and the presence of God was
[44:55] there and um and that was my burden for
[44:58] the presence of the Lord to drop down
[45:00] and I took it from Isaiah and where
[45:03] where because he came in the presence of
[45:05] the Lord and the Lord has touched him
[45:07] praise the Lord in the presence of the L
[45:09] of the of this of this light praise the
[45:12] Lord in his presence a change happened
[45:15] and as was my desire and I couldn't
[45:17] finish the message going to Isaiah and
[45:19] picking it out praise the Lord and I
[45:22] don't I won't have to go there this
[45:23] morning but praise the Lord but with
[45:25] this desire and that I had had that on
[45:27] my heart for yesterday evening and the
[45:29] Lord so be beautifully visited us with
[45:31] his presence yesterday we just want to
[45:33] give him the credit and the thanks and
[45:36] all the
[45:38] glory and um now before I go into the uh
[45:41] Easter message and Sunday message and
[45:45] and we went out with brother yel and
[45:47] there was laying the message of brother
[45:49] brandham the presence of God and brother
[45:51] oit has it on his desk there and you
[45:54] might know about it it's laying already
[45:55] since a few months I heard and uh
[45:57] brother yel he came and he said brother
[46:00] Stefanos I want to show you something he
[46:02] said and he opened up the message in the
[46:04] presence of the Lord and he said you see
[46:06] here at the beginning of the message
[46:08] brother brandham interrupts the message
[46:10] and he says I want to insert something
[46:13] in the message in the presence of the
[46:15] Lord and um and and he showed me and he
[46:18] said there was a missing part of the
[46:20] countdown and brother Brandon was
[46:22] preaching the countdown in the morning
[46:25] and so in the in 8 hours after he
[46:27] preached the message he inserted a few
[46:30] things in the message to countdown and
[46:33] while he was preaching the message in
[46:34] the pressence he said I have something
[46:36] I've have inserted in the morning's
[46:38] message of the countdown and he brought
[46:40] it back to the church and little did he
[46:43] know that praise the Lord in the morning
[46:45] yesterday morning actually When I Was
[46:47] preparing I was supposed to preach two
[46:49] times and brother Isaac asked me can I
[46:51] preach the third time and I was in the

[47:14] Lord and it was so beautiful laid out
[47:16] and confirmed and so I have this morning
[47:18] the opportunity and the burden and the
[47:21] and what God put on my heart to speak
[47:23] about the countdown and my my tit my
[47:25] title this morning is finishing the
[47:28] countdown of life because there's many
[47:31] countdowns in life but there's one
[47:33] countdown of the life there's countdowns
[47:36] of death there's countdowns of
[47:39] destructions and there's many countdown
[47:41] and tomorrow this morning I want to go
[47:43] into it and speak about different
[47:45] countdowns to find out about countdowns
[47:47] but there's one countdown of life and he
[47:50] choose a bride at the end of the ages to
[47:53] finish that countdown and you are the
[47:56] bride to finish a countdown the
[47:58] countdown is on but there's an end
[48:00] coming to the
[48:01] countdown praise the Lord hallelujah
[48:05] praise the Lord so life is full of
[48:07] countdowns and so praise the Lord and uh
[48:10] countdowns when we look at the tree and
[48:12] especially in our in in in Europe where
[48:15] we are we have the winter we have we
[48:17] have the trees and brother brandom had
[48:18] the same the snow is coming and when
[48:20] it's getting cold the sub of the tree
[48:23] has to go down in the root otherwise it
[48:26] would kill the the tree it would explode
[48:28] actually praise the Lord so brother Bram
[48:31] speaks about it he says in the in in
[48:34] springtime the sub is coming up again it
[48:38] speaks about a resurrection it speaks
[48:41] about a
[48:42] life but in the natural life it's a
[48:45] countdown till
[48:47] Autumn because it Springs up but in
[48:50] Autumn it will die again the sub will go
[48:52] down again so it's a countown of
[48:55] life but there's another countdown in
[48:58] Autumn another countdown starts when the
[49:01] leaves are falling down when there's no
[49:03] more fruits on the tree and the life is
[49:06] going back in the root there's another
[49:09] countdown that starts in the root and a
[49:11] countdown is back to life the countdown
[49:14] is spring is coming and one day spring
[49:18] is there then the countdown is over let
[49:20] that what has pressed praise the Lord

[49:32] countdown to it the sun rises in the
[49:35] morning it goes down in the evening
[49:37] there's a span of time for the rising of
[49:40] the Sun and when the sun is gone away
[49:43] there's another countdown for a
[49:45] resurrection of life so we see all
[49:48] things up by a countdown and many things
[49:50] up by a countdown so we want to go in
[49:53] the countdown in the context of Easter

[56:59] all power is given unto me praise the
[57:02] Lord thank you Jesus Hallelujah so let's
[57:05] speak about a countown before before we
[57:07] go in the great picture I just want to
[57:09] pick up out a few countdowns and I want
[57:12] to speak about Moses when Israel was in
[57:15] Egyptian now Israel was in Egypt praise
[57:18] the Lord and they were under slavery
[57:20] praise the Lord and they come into by
[57:23] Joseph and they were seeking food and
[57:25] they found a place to live there because
[57:27] they didn't have anything to eat in
[57:29] their country Abraham so they went there
[57:32] and to to have to have food and they
[57:34] started to make a living praise the Lord
[57:36] but there was a promise above Israel
[57:39] praise the Lord there was a promise for
[57:41] the people there was a promise of a
[57:43] countdown there was a promise of a time
[57:45] of space there was a promise of 400
[57:48] years praise the Lord and over the years
[57:51] amen they started to become slavers and
[57:54] the Kings forgot about the people of
[57:57] Israel about the God and about Joseph
[57:59] they forgot about it and they took
[58:01] Israel as slaves praise the Lord and
[58:04] they were enslaved and in bondage praise
[58:07] the Lord but the countdown was on the
[58:10] countdown was going on the watch was
[58:13] clicking there was a countdown going
[58:15] praise the Lord and that countdown has
[58:18] to come to an end one day praise the
[58:20] Lord and the countdown was for 400 years
[58:23] and the countdown was not only for
[58:25] Israel but the counter was for Egypt as
[58:28] well praise the Lord the counter was for
[58:31] the Earthly Dominion there was a
[58:33] countown for life and there was a
[58:35] countdown for death at the same time
[58:38] praise the Lord and when he came to the
[58:40] end of this great countdown God said I
[58:42] will send a deliverer because it it
[58:45] needs a deliverer to to to stop any
[58:48] countdowns praise the Lord amen so God
[58:51] said I will I will send a deliverer and
[58:54] now and now what happened a Pharaoh got
[58:56] a notice that there's a change going on
[59:00] and and Pharaoh somehow somebody must
[59:02] have told him about a 400 years and
[59:06] Pharaoh got afraid praise the Lord he
[59:08] got in fear he said the deliverer
[59:11] there's a deliverer coming a countdown
[59:13] is on and him a unbeliever he knew that
[59:17] a countdown has to come to an end but
[59:19] Israel was there in their slavery and
[59:21] somehow they forgot the count on praise
[59:24] the Lord but farara knew the count was
[59:26] coming to an end praise the Lord and and
[59:29] what did Farah do he tried to stop the
[59:32] countdown he said kill all babies Age 2
[59:34] years old because there's the countdown
[59:37] running out praise the Lord so he tried
[59:39] to kill praise the Lord The Young Ones
[59:42] the same thing happened when Jesus came
[59:44] on the scene praise the Lord they knew a
[59:46] countdown what's going on so herodes
[59:48] tried to kill all the young boys age two
[59:51] years old praise the Lord and now in
[59:53] these days another countdown is coming
[59:55] to an end darkness is trying to bring
[59:58] death to the people of God Hallelujah to
[1:00:00] the young ones praise the Lord but he
[1:00:02] will not Prevail
[1:00:05] amen now in that distress in that
[1:00:08] distress in that in in in that terrible
[1:00:11] situation of death praise the Lord God
[1:00:14] sends in this he sends a deliverer
[1:00:16] praise the Lord and he say I will will
[1:00:18] make a way praise the Lord and Moses was
[1:00:21] born and when Moses was born another
[1:00:24] countdown started for Moses personally
[1:00:27] praise the Lord when he was aged young
[1:00:29] zero age he was born God set a countdown
[1:00:33] in the life of Moses praise the Lord and
[1:00:36] and he was directed immediately to the
[1:00:38] King's house to Pharaoh's house to the
[1:00:41] enemy's house praise the Lord praise the
[1:00:44] Lord and they started to raise him they
[1:00:46] started to educate him praise the Lord
[1:00:48] and I'm sure about it his mother knew
[1:00:51] about it and they told it around and
[1:00:53] they sure put some hope in Moses they
[1:00:55] said we have somebody in in Pharaoh's
[1:00:59] home and and praise the Lord and say and
[1:01:02] and they watched him they saw him and it
[1:01:04] says he is trained in the wisdom of man
[1:01:08] and the human elements get start
[1:01:10] operating and sometimes God leads the
[1:01:12] human elements in a wrong way to prove
[1:01:15] himself that he's the same yesterday
[1:01:17] today and forever and he has his own way
[1:01:20] of redemption not found by human element
[1:01:23] He says my thoughts are higher than your
[1:01:25] thoughts
[1:01:28] the human thought was one day one day
[1:01:30] Moses going to take off over Pharaoh's
[1:01:34] seat he was the successor brother Bram
[1:01:36] says and it was in the human element
[1:01:39] they thought he would take over and be
[1:01:41] the ruler and then will lead them
[1:01:43] out but God said your way is not my way
[1:01:47] my way is higher than your way my
[1:01:49] thoughts are higher than your SS praise
[1:01:51] the Lord because I have a different way
[1:01:54] to finish the countdown than human way
[1:01:57] praise the Lord praise the lord and
[1:01:59] there was a countown going on in Moses
[1:02:01] lives and Moses was trained well trained
[1:02:04] and he knew the promise that was laying
[1:02:06] over him and he knew one day he has to
[1:02:08] step out praise the Lord and but with
[1:02:11] all his knowledge and all his training
[1:02:13] he got and all his all his trainings he
[1:02:16] had praise the Lord he came to a place
[1:02:18] praise the Lord and He Saw how how how
[1:02:21] the pressure was upon his brothers and
[1:02:23] his sisters while they were in slavery
[1:02:25] praise the Lord and he saw how they were
[1:02:27] pleading and how how they were crying
[1:02:29] and how they were mourning praise the
[1:02:31] Lord and he had compassion with them
[1:02:33] praise the Lord and so what he did he
[1:02:35] got angry praise the Lord and in his
[1:02:37] anger he slew one
[1:02:39] Egyptian praise the Lord with his anger
[1:02:42] with his human element one Egyptian
[1:02:46] praise the Lord and God let it happen
[1:02:48] because he said I have another way Moses
[1:02:51] I have another way and all the concepts
[1:02:54] of human elements failed this day all
[1:02:57] what they s that Redemption would look
[1:03:00] like failed this day praise the Lord in
[1:03:03] Jesus time they saw Jesus going to be a
[1:03:05] deliverer with a mighty arm and he has
[1:03:07] an army and he will slay the Romans and
[1:03:10] everything and set Israel fre but Jesus
[1:03:12] said I come on a different way he said I
[1:03:15] come in my father's name not in the name
[1:03:18] of man praise the
[1:03:19] Lord praise the Lord so God stopped at
[1:03:22] that day he stopped the mental
[1:03:23] conception at that day and me time I
[1:03:26] believe time of mental conceptions of
[1:03:29] men are over praise the Lord but the
[1:03:31] time of redemption is in the house of
[1:03:33] God praise the Lord and so Moses he was
[1:03:36] there and so Moses when he was when he
[1:03:39] failed actually with his burden and his
[1:03:42] anger praise the Lord amen and he went
[1:03:45] into he he he went into the desert
[1:03:48] praise the Lord in a place where you
[1:03:50] think all hope is gone praise the Lord
[1:03:52] but the Lord said Moses it's not by
[1:03:55] might
[1:03:57] Moses it's not by power you have tried
[1:04:00] it by might Maybe by intellect you have
[1:04:03] tried it by power but MOS it's by my
[1:04:07] spirit praise the
[1:04:11] Lord so Moses finds himself in a desert
[1:04:15] and in the desert praise the lord it's a
[1:04:17] place of repentance it's a place of
[1:04:20] humbling yourself and it's a place of
[1:04:22] recognizing your failures it's a time to
[1:04:25] pull away away from the sins of the
[1:04:27] world and to find Christ probably there
[1:04:29] in the desert praise the Lord to make
[1:04:31] some death back sight on on a desert
[1:04:34] experience Lord to know that we find out
[1:04:36] we are nothing actually praise the Lord
[1:04:40] praise the Lord and this is what Isiah
[1:04:42] actually found out in the temple of God
[1:04:44] he found out he nothing in the presence
[1:04:47] of God praise the Lord and sure MOS he
[1:04:50] went through a process like every
[1:04:52] believer is going through a process of
[1:04:54] repentance and praise the Lord and then
[1:04:57] dedicating himself and then is a place
[1:05:00] coming of commission praise the Lord so
[1:05:02] he was in the desert and he humbled
[1:05:04] himself he recognized his failure amen
[1:05:07] and uh praise the Lord but the Lord says
[1:05:09] I will make a way in the desert
[1:05:12] mosa I am that I am I the same I will
[1:05:16] make a way in the desert amen and then
[1:05:19] one day praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:05:23] praise the Lord another 40 years in the
[1:05:25] Des
[1:05:26] amen another 40 Years of sanctification
[1:05:29] on the backside of the desert praise the
[1:05:31] Lord one day the Lord said this
[1:05:34] countdown of sanctification is over
[1:05:36] Moses Moses there's another personal uh
[1:05:40] countdown coming for you now and he said
[1:05:42] MOS come to the burning bush he says MOS
[1:05:46] I have an account for you because now
[1:05:48] you come in your third step praise the
[1:05:50] Lord now you're coming in your
[1:05:52] commission Moses Lord I sending you now
[1:05:55] praise the Lord and now your personal
[1:05:57] count on of Deliverance is coming MOS
[1:05:59] come in the presence of God Amen and the
[1:06:02] burning bush was burning and he says
[1:06:04] take off your shoes Moses because the
[1:06:07] ground where you're standing on his Holy
[1:06:09] Ground praise the Lord and that's what's
[1:06:10] happening when we come into the presence
[1:06:13] of God praise the Lord and another
[1:06:15] countdown has started for Moses praise
[1:06:17] the Lord amen so God came down in a
[1:06:20] burning bush amen and Moses after this
[1:06:23] experience he was ready he was a yielded
[1:06:26] Wessel that God can use yielded over 40
[1:06:29] years in the desert and God started said
[1:06:32] the time is up now Moses another season
[1:06:36] has started Moses your final time has
[1:06:39] come not only your final time but the
[1:06:41] time for the for the people of Israel
[1:06:45] praise the Lord amen and from that time
[1:06:48] on another countdown was for
[1:06:52] Moses and a great countdown for Israel
[1:06:55] was coming to an
[1:06:57] end and another count out for Pharaoh
[1:07:00] was coming to an end so we see there's a
[1:07:03] countdowns different countdowns of life
[1:07:05] and different countdowns of death the
[1:07:08] death was to Pharaoh but life for Israel
[1:07:12] praise the Lord speaking about
[1:07:13] countdowns this morning he praise the
[1:07:15] Lord and so we see Moses went through
[1:07:18] three stages of different countdowns for
[1:07:20] the final climax in his life praise the
[1:07:24] Lord praise the Lord Lord amen let me
[1:07:27] move on praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:07:30] praise the Lord so here this a example
[1:07:32] of Moses and then we have another
[1:07:34] example of a countdown for if we take it
[1:07:36] for Joshua praise the Lord and Joshua he
[1:07:39] took the people over into the promised
[1:07:42] land and the promise was for Joshua to
[1:07:44] say to say the promise was there he said
[1:07:47] thy seed shall inherit the gates of all
[1:07:50] the enemies is that right praise the
[1:07:52] Lord and when they crossed over Jordan
[1:07:55] uh count down started for Israel to
[1:07:57] possess the land praise the Lord and at
[1:08:00] the same down time this countdown
[1:08:02] started for Israel to say you shall
[1:08:05] possess every gate of your enemy at the
[1:08:07] same time praise the Lord a countdown
[1:08:10] started for the
[1:08:11] enemy praise the Lord the countdown
[1:08:14] started for Jericho's walls to come down
[1:08:18] and the countown for victory started for
[1:08:20] Israel praise the Lord a count out was
[1:08:22] going on after we're crossing the Jordan
[1:08:25] praise prise the Lord so there's many
[1:08:27] Chans there's many there's many Jans
[1:08:29] there's many countdowns in life and um
[1:08:32] so it's another example and I just want
[1:08:34] to skip through it because I want to
[1:08:35] come back to the great countdowns of
[1:08:38] life amen so there was another countdown
[1:08:42] praise the Lord with David amen and
[1:08:44] David was a young man and we yesterday
[1:08:46] we were speaking about young men's and
[1:08:49] David was at his father's business
[1:08:50] praise the Lord he was just keeping the
[1:08:53] sheep and he was just dedicated to what
[1:08:55] God sent him to and he was in the in the
[1:08:57] fields praise the Lord and God said
[1:09:01] David I have a countdown for you David
[1:09:04] there's a change of season coming to you
[1:09:07] David there's a change of your ministry
[1:09:09] David there's another change coming to
[1:09:11] your life praise the Lord and God sent a
[1:09:13] prophet down the dusty road praise the
[1:09:16] Lord and he sent it down to the house of
[1:09:19] of of yes praise the Lord and he had
[1:09:21] many sons praise the Lord and God said
[1:09:23] there's one son I'm going to make make a
[1:09:26] change in his life there's one son I'm
[1:09:28] going to make a change of season praise
[1:09:30] the Lord and a prophet was looking for a
[1:09:33] son where a change season will change
[1:09:36] praise the Lord so we was going down and
[1:09:38] he says I I I'm finding he said yes I'm
[1:09:40] I'm trying to find I have a commission
[1:09:42] from the Lord I'm finding the next king

[1:09:47] all the sons of yes and they came up and
[1:09:49] he say when we know the story how it
[1:09:51] goes he says no it is not this one

[1:10:00] yes said yes there is one more there's
[1:10:02] one more on the fields there's one more
[1:10:04] on the desert praise the Lord and and
[1:10:07] Samuel said call him up call him up call
[1:10:10] call his son and his name was David and
[1:10:13] little did David know that day will be a
[1:10:15] different day than all the days of his
[1:10:17] life praise the Lord little did he know
[1:10:21] that from that day on something else got
[1:10:23] a hold of his life praise the Lord
[1:10:27] [Music]
[1:11:21] [Music]
[1:11:25] praise the Lord destruction set in into
[1:11:28] Israel but there was a time coming for a
[1:11:31] king a king after my own heart a king
[1:11:35] that will rule in the way I would like
[1:11:37] to rule praise the Lord Like a Shepherd

[1:11:44] was going in his time David was going in
[1:11:47] his season so David was going in his
[1:11:50] place like we are going in our times of
[1:11:52] Life praise the Lord like we are walking

[1:11:56] David was walking and David had
[1:11:59] Temptations David had trials David had
[1:12:02] tests praise the Lord in the countdown

[1:12:06] came along in the countdown a lion came
[1:12:09] along praise the Lord but David slew the

[1:16:59] ones of
[1:17:00] God because it's God's
[1:17:06] timing David didn't interfere in God's
[1:17:10] program he had a
[1:17:13] confidence he said the one who gives the
[1:17:15] promise he will fulfill it in its time
[1:17:19] and it
[1:17:20] season but he knew his countdown was
[1:17:24] also coming to an end
[1:17:25] am but he wasn't pushing himself hallu
[1:17:28] he wasn't trying
[1:17:31] himself because he had
[1:17:33] experienced that Spirit That Came Upon
[1:17:37] David it was the spirit of
[1:17:41] adoption and David was experienced the
[1:17:44] spirit of adoption is protecting him

[1:18:24] Lord
[1:18:29] God I was just speaking about a few
[1:18:33] countdowns forgive me I could have count
[1:18:35] gone in the count of is Israel when the
[1:18:38] countdown of pharel was over and the
[1:18:41] people of God were delivered praise the
[1:18:44] Lord amen but I left it out because I
[1:18:47] want to come to a greater
[1:18:51] picture I want to come to the first
[1:18:53] countdown that ever started on this
[1:18:59] Earth because this
[1:19:01] countdown is coming to an end and it
[1:19:05] might be closer than you think my
[1:19:07] brother my
[1:19:12] sister Adam was created in the image of
[1:19:16] God man and female together a
[1:19:20] Unity Spirit
[1:19:23] man and God made Adam a theophan he made
[1:19:27] him complete he made him Eternal he made
[1:19:31] him in his image male and female
[1:19:36] together no
[1:19:38] countdown
[1:19:40] Eternal no
[1:19:42] countdown and we are coming back to a
[1:19:47] time where the angel is standing on the
[1:19:52] water and on the floor
[1:19:56] seven sun will out their
[1:19:58] voices and the angel will
[1:20:00] Proclaim time shall be no
[1:20:04] more the times of any countdowns of life
[1:20:08] is
[1:20:11] over the great countdown of
[1:20:15] God it's a countdown for some for Less
[1:20:19] to the glory of God but for all us it's
[1:20:21] the time the the time the countown for
[1:20:24] life
[1:20:26] praise the Lord so God made him Man In
[1:20:28] His Image and let's skip to Genesis
[1:20:32] 2 praise the Lord in question and
[1:20:34] answers brother brandham said and he and
[1:20:37] he said what happened actually between
[1:20:39] Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 and when God
[1:20:41] brought the man a little lower down and
[1:20:44] put him in animal life that this body
[1:20:47] just like the animal so that he could
[1:20:49] still that he could till the soil and
[1:20:51] could touch that teop up there in
[1:20:55] Genesis one doesn't touch it doesn't see
[1:20:58] it doesn't smell it doesn't hear they
[1:21:01] don't have this
[1:21:03] senses the tany don't have this human
[1:21:07] senses of reasoning of imagination is
[1:21:11] over when we come back to that tan
[1:21:15] imagination is over reasoning is over
[1:21:17] praise the Lord affection is over praise
[1:21:20] the Lord because the time of all these
[1:21:22] five senses has run out and we are
[1:21:25] coming back to
[1:21:27] that but God had a story to unfold in a
[1:21:30] time of season praise the Lord in the in
[1:21:34] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:21:36] brother BR says God's intention for his
[1:21:39] creation man is to express his
[1:21:42] words praise the Lord the words that he
[1:21:45] had already in his mind and God spoke it
[1:21:48] and God had an intention for his words
[1:21:50] to be
[1:21:51] fulfilled that's why he put a he put He
[1:21:54] had an intent ition for creation in
[1:21:56] Genesis Adam was given the word to live
[1:21:59] by a life lived by the word would be the
[1:22:01] word expressed and the word is
[1:22:05] eternal my words shall never fail my
[1:22:08] words are Eternal praise the Lord now in
[1:22:12] Genesis 2 we read on verse 14 and the
[1:22:16] Lord took the man and he put him into
[1:22:18] the Garden of Eden to dress it and to
[1:22:20] keep it and the Lord commanded the man
[1:22:23] saying of every tree in the garden thou
[1:22:25] may feel freely to eat and then he said
[1:22:29] but of the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:22:32] Evil Thou shalt not
[1:22:34] eat for in the day that thou eatest
[1:22:38] thereof thou shall surely
[1:22:42] die the first
[1:22:45] countdown and it was a countdown for
[1:22:49] this he says Adam be
[1:22:52] aware if you start to eat from that tree
[1:22:56] a countdown
[1:22:58] starts and he said the same day you eat
[1:23:01] you're going to
[1:23:04] die and we know that the day by God Is A
[1:23:07] Thousand
[1:23:08] Years praise the Lord Peter picked it up
[1:23:10] in the New Testament and he spoke about
[1:23:13] it and a countdown was set in if you do
[1:23:16] that the countdown is
[1:23:19] clicking Adam the clock is ticking death
[1:23:23] is setting in now now you live Eternal
[1:23:26] by the word of
[1:23:27] life but if you eat from the other tree
[1:23:30] let me say from the eat of
[1:23:32] imagination from the eat of Knowledge
[1:23:36] from the from the Tree of reasoning if
[1:23:38] you start to eat from this
[1:23:40] tree you die the countown is set
[1:23:48] in the rule was set the law was
[1:23:53] given now this law was given when Adam
[1:23:56] was
[1:23:57] alone a was not there and God gave the
[1:24:04] Worden and the Lord said it is not good
[1:24:06] for man that man should be alone I will
[1:24:09] give him a helpmate for him and brother
[1:24:11] B says this flesh man was uncomplete
[1:24:14] because a part of him was still in the
[1:24:18] theophany praise the Lord now brother
[1:24:20] Brenham continues look he never went and
[1:24:23] got dirt and made Eve
[1:24:25] but he made from the original dirt he
[1:24:27] made Adam he took a rib from his side
[1:24:30] and made him a helpman and that was Eve
[1:24:32] and she was made for the man and part of
[1:24:35] the man she was part of him in the
[1:24:37] beginning in the creation in the tany
[1:24:40] and she was part of him down there in
[1:24:42] the creation she could not be divided in
[1:24:45] any other creation she had to be made of
[1:24:48] that same
[1:24:52] creation but the word of God already
[1:24:55] came to the
[1:24:56] prophet and Adam was a prophet to Eve
[1:25:00] and he had the word of God for Eve
[1:25:03] praise the Lord and he gave the word to
[1:25:05] Eve and he said Eve we can eat of any
[1:25:08] kind of tree but he said eve don't eat
[1:25:11] of that tree because in the moment you
[1:25:14] eat of that tree we're going to surely
[1:25:17] die praise the Lord he said if he
[1:25:19] challenged his wife because a prophet
[1:25:22] must prophesy
[1:25:37] and she received the word she knew
[1:25:40] it and a serpent came around sneaking in
[1:25:45] and the serpent knew that a countown of
[1:25:48] death were set
[1:25:52] inallah and the serpent said in to the
[1:25:55] woman you shall surely not die and he
[1:25:58] presented a lie to
[1:26:01] her and if she started to reason she
[1:26:06] started to
[1:26:07] imagine why is the minister so much
[1:26:11] against reasoning imagination you wonder
[1:26:15] why because it's set in the first count
[1:26:18] on of
[1:26:20] death and brother Bram is a quote
[1:26:23] brother Bram says if you
[1:27:25] word it's the great riches for her it's
[1:27:29] the pearl of precious prize she lose all
[1:27:32] give me that price praise the Lord
[1:27:36] praise the
[1:27:37] Lord praise the Lord now we know we know
[1:27:42] what happened in the garden of Eve and
[1:27:45] you imagine that God is looking there
[1:27:48] and it says in the moment she starts to
[1:27:51] eat of that tree I have to press the
[1:27:57] B her
[1:28:00] creator that formed her took the rib he
[1:28:04] was
[1:28:06] watching and she took it we know what
[1:28:09] happened what a prophet revealed to us
[1:28:12] and God was watching
[1:28:14] it maybe tears running down if it would
[1:28:17] have been Jesus tears would have run
[1:28:20] down in the form of
[1:28:23] man God was watching it in the moment
[1:28:26] you
[1:28:29] eat and he had to press the
[1:28:35] button now the Clock Was ticking for
[1:28:40] Eve now here was
[1:28:43] Eve under a countdown of
[1:28:47] death and Adam knew the countown was
[1:28:51] running on
[1:28:52] her at that time
[1:28:55] time Adam was not under the
[1:29:01] countdown and Adam had to make a
[1:29:05] choice he
[1:29:07] said I can stay here and not eat of the
[1:29:10] tree and live
[1:29:13] Eternal or I can make a choice and
[1:29:17] follow after
[1:29:19] Eve brother branam says Adam was not
[1:29:23] deceived
[1:29:27] Aiden took a
[1:29:32] choice but God before he formed Eve when
[1:29:37] God created Adam Out of the Dust of the
[1:29:42] earth he says Adam you're
[1:29:47] created therefore shall a man leave his
[1:29:51] father and mother and cling to his wife
[1:29:58] it was still the word of
[1:30:02] God why did God say that am because he
[1:30:07] wanted to unfold unfold a
[1:30:10] picture he said there's another
[1:30:12] countdown going on and he said one day
[1:30:17] the son of righteousness will come
[1:30:21] down and he also will make a
[1:30:25] choice Jesus Christ had a choice to live
[1:30:30] forever or to go into
[1:30:36] death and brother Bram said he took the
[1:30:39] right
[1:30:40] choice he did the choice to bring a
[1:30:44] bride back to
[1:30:50] himself because when he died on the
[1:30:54] cross of
[1:30:56] Calvary another countdown
[1:30:58] started but this time is what it was not
[1:31:02] a countdown of death 2,000 years ago it
[1:31:06] was a countdown of life for the Bride of
[1:31:09] Jesus
[1:31:10] [Applause]
[1:31:19] Christ So Adam in the Garden of Eden
[1:31:23] representing
[1:31:24] Christ he was the first
[1:31:27] Adam he had to make a
[1:31:30] choice and he made a choice
[1:31:33] willing he said I will follow my wife
[1:31:37] because the two shall be one in death
[1:31:41] and also in
[1:31:44] Resurrection hallu what a
[1:31:48] picture Adam will filling you submit
[1:31:51] himself to the
[1:31:53] countdown because he knew another Adam
[1:31:57] will be in the
[1:31:58] making he shall redeem me at the end
[1:32:02] praise the
[1:32:04] Lord so
[1:32:05] God he was not
[1:32:08] surprised what was
[1:32:11] happening no
[1:32:13] situation on Earth in heaven or under
[1:32:18] the Earth can ever CAU God by
[1:32:23] surprise
[1:32:26] your situation in life never CS God in
[1:32:32] surprise but God has a
[1:32:35] plan and God said give me give me
[1:32:40] another 4,000
[1:32:42] years death has set in but God says give
[1:32:45] me another 4,000 years praise the Lord
[1:32:48] give me another span of time let me
[1:32:52] Express the seven C compound names of
[1:32:55] Jehovah give me a time to express my
[1:33:01] attributes of a Overcomer of a redeemer
[1:33:05] of a king of king of a Shepherd give me
[1:33:08] another
[1:33:10] 4,000 and another Masterpiece will be in
[1:33:13] the
[1:33:14] making the core The Cure was getting
[1:33:18] ready praise the Lord and we found out
[1:33:22] the great countdown of deaths was
[1:33:25] setting in the garden of e Eden but a
[1:33:28] count on of life for a son to resurrect
[1:33:32] again was in the
[1:33:34] making isn't it so praise the Lord
[1:33:39] praise the Lord so we come down 4,000
[1:33:42] years and a great countown of deaths was
[1:33:46] coming to a climax praise to your 400
[1:33:50] years no Prophet but a redeemer
[1:33:54] Hallelujah the promise for the Redeemer
[1:33:57] was there laying out in Isaiah's time
[1:34:00] 400 years Israel was waiting for the
[1:34:04] Redeemer Hallelujah Israel was waiting
[1:34:07] for the promised Redeemer Israel Israel
[1:34:10] was waiting for a countown to come to an
[1:34:13] end and Israel was waiting for somebody
[1:34:18] hallu somebody Hallelujah that will come
[1:34:21] along that will break the countdown
[1:34:24] the count on of death because death
[1:34:27] means separation of sin Separation by
[1:34:30] sin separation to
[1:34:33] God and Israel was waiting where's the
[1:34:37] Redeemer when is he coming when is the
[1:34:40] end coming to the countdown praise the
[1:34:42] Lord and God was looking for a dedicated
[1:34:46] vessel and he found one in Mary and Mary
[1:34:50] we can be so glad Mary said beat unto me
[1:34:53] Mary did didn't had any reasoning she
[1:34:55] didn't had any imagination she didn't
[1:34:57] use her five senses when the Holy Spirit
[1:35:00] was dropping down when the present of
[1:35:02] God was coming down but she said be it
[1:35:04] unto me according to your will according
[1:35:07] to your word be it unto me praise the
[1:35:10] Lord praise the Lord and the king of
[1:35:13] king was
[1:35:15] born and herodes as I said before found
[1:35:18] out praise the Lord by some prophets
[1:35:22] that had a word of God said a king will
[1:35:24] be born and herodes was aware he said
[1:35:28] when he is coming my rulership will come
[1:35:30] to an end and he was afraid of it
[1:35:33] because he knew another countdown has
[1:35:35] started in Praise the Lord but did Jesus
[1:35:38] didn't came for the Natural Life Jesus
[1:35:41] came for the eternal life praise the
[1:35:44] Lord Jesus was coming to bring back

[1:36:04] the Lord and Satan came around and Satan
[1:36:07] knew when he comes around that his time
[1:36:10] will be finished the time of Satan will
[1:36:13] be finished praise the Lord and he was
[1:36:16] testing him if he's the son of God in
[1:36:19] the wilderness if you are the Son of God
[1:36:22] are you the one praise the Lord and he
[1:36:25] was Tess he wanted to find out praise

[1:36:34] late your countdown was
[1:36:38] over praise the
[1:36:40] Lord and Jesus he went his way and he
[1:36:45] proved a countdown was over praise the
[1:36:49] Lord when he went at a cross of Calvary
[1:36:53] and he died
[1:36:54] and he cried out it is
[1:37:00] finished this great watch that started
[1:37:04] in Eden praise the Lord Death set in
[1:37:08] in there was no hope no

[1:37:44] morning and from that time on another
[1:37:48] countdown has started
[1:37:52] in
[1:37:55] and it was a
[1:37:57] countdown of
[1:38:00] life he said I am the bread of
[1:38:06] life he said come unto me all ye that
[1:38:10] heavy
[1:38:11] laden and I will give you

[1:40:01] message the presence of God and he
[1:40:04] inserted the
[1:40:06] countdown and I went in there this
[1:40:09] morning and he inserted he said the
[1:40:12] countdown is seven Church
[1:40:18] ages and he said seven is the perfect

[1:40:39] Eternal
[1:40:40] Source
[1:40:42] attributes of the Son of
[1:40:45] God and another count on has started
[1:40:49] seven Church ages in the
[1:40:52] making
[1:40:54] and God took Paul the first star he took
[1:40:57] him and he laid it
[1:41:00] out and the countown started
[1:41:03] one the countown started two
[1:41:07] arinos the countown started
[1:41:10] three
[1:41:12] Martin and the count and started four
[1:41:16] Colombia the count start at
[1:41:22] five and Satan knew a countdown was
[1:41:27] on Satan knew another countdown of life
[1:41:31] was going to
[1:41:33] making and Satan said everything I can
[1:41:36] do I will do something to stop this
[1:41:39] countdown of
[1:41:41] Life praise the Lord but at the same
[1:41:45] time praise the Lord at the same time a
[1:41:50] countdown of life started for the seed
[1:41:54] of
[1:41:56] God at at same time a countdown of death
[1:42:01] started for
[1:42:04] Satan one was counting up and the other
[1:42:08] was counting
[1:42:09] down praise the Lord a count on of life
[1:42:14] is counting
[1:42:16] up seven steps to
[1:42:19] Perfection a countdown to eternal life
[1:42:22] back what you have been at the beginning
[1:42:25] In the Garden of
[1:42:26] Eden a count on her started when Jesus
[1:42:30] was resurrected and I count on seven
[1:42:33] steps up back to eternal
[1:42:37] life but on the other
[1:42:39] hand on started for
[1:42:47] this and the devil tried everything to
[1:42:51] stop the countown up
[1:42:54] and he sent four four horse risers he
[1:42:57] sent into the
[1:42:59] church and he sent them in trying to get
[1:43:03] a hold of that
[1:43:04] life praise the
[1:43:08] Lord and it looked like he got a hold of
[1:43:14] it it looked like he could make
[1:43:19] it and brother brandham said in the
[1:43:22] exposition of the service seven Church
[1:43:24] ages he says the birth of the church was
[1:43:27] at
[1:43:27] Pentecost and as the first Adam was
[1:43:30] given a bride fresh from the hand of God
[1:43:33] and was undefiled for a brief span so
[1:43:35] was Christ the last Adam given a pride
[1:43:39] pure and fresh at
[1:43:45] Pentecost the process was
[1:43:47] on the countdown was
[1:43:50] on will that Pride will she
[1:43:56] Prevail and she remained separate and
[1:43:59] undefiled for some time and of the rest
[1:44:04] D no man join himself to them acts
[1:44:07] 413 and the Lord added to the church
[1:44:10] daily such as should be
[1:44:13] saved acts
[1:44:16] 247 how long this did this continue we
[1:44:20] don't
[1:44:21] know now brother BR says but one day
[1:44:25] even as Eve was tempted and seduced by
[1:44:28] Satan so the church was contaminated by
[1:44:31] the entrance of an
[1:44:37] antichrist and it became
[1:44:40] dark in Dark
[1:44:42] Ages and it looked like all hope was
[1:44:46] gone it looked like the countdown of
[1:44:49] Life didn't
[1:44:51] work it looked like everything was
[1:44:54] dark everything was pled out everything
[1:44:58] was
[1:45:00] finished but it was a
[1:45:03] prophecy and it took some more years for
[1:45:05] that
[1:45:06] prophecy and the prophecy was I will
[1:45:10] restore says the
[1:45:13] Lord I will restore all the years that
[1:45:16] the Locust has eaten the canker worms
[1:45:19] and the caterpillars and the Palmer
[1:45:20] worms and my great Army which I sent
[1:45:23] among you I will
[1:45:26] restore I will restore because the
[1:45:28] countown is still
[1:45:30] running the count on didn't stop the
[1:45:34] count on just said the seed must have to
[1:45:36] die to bring more
[1:45:38] fruit but the secret is in the word and
[1:45:41] the word is in the
[1:45:43] bright praise the
[1:45:46] Lord and it shall come to pass
[1:45:50] afterwards after that I

[1:46:27] Lord it speaks about a time at the end
[1:46:30] of the count out of life after I
[1:46:33] restore and he said and it shall come to
[1:46:36] pass that whosoever shall call on the
[1:46:38] name of the Lord and we were speaking
[1:46:40] about the name of the Lord Jesus shall

[2:37:17] few announcements as we prepare to close
[2:37:19] out you can give keep playing softly my
[2:37:22] my my what can we say what can we
[2:37:24] say can we give the Lord one more hand
[2:37:26] of
[2:37:30] Praise You know brother stepan said
[2:37:33] something this evening that just blew my
[2:37:35] mind and I went back to the scripture
[2:37:37] because he said that the devil was
[2:37:39] losing some of his best
[2:37:41] men
[2:37:43] so sacrifice so I went back into the
[2:37:46] scripture in Daniel 3 where the Bible
[2:37:49] says and Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury the
[2:37:52] form of his Visage was changed so his
[2:37:55] whole face start to change when he
[2:37:57] recognized that these Hebrew boys were
[2:37:59] not prepared to bow down and these
[2:38:02] brothers said we are not even careful
[2:38:04] with how we answer in other words we
[2:38:06] don't we we really care how you take it
[2:38:07] we not bowing down we have business as
[2:38:10] we say we have business we not bowing
[2:38:11] down and his whole countenance change
[2:38:14] and the Bible said he commanded the most
[2:38:17] Mighty
[2:38:18] Men so he sent his Navy SEAL
[2:38:22] unit to escort the Hebrew boys down to
[2:38:25] the fiery furnace so it was a senseless
[2:38:28] act because in doing that the enemy was
[2:38:31] so desperate to destroy them that he
[2:38:34] lost his best soldiers in his attempt to
[2:38:37] destroy you the devil will lose his best
[2:38:40] [Applause]
[2:38:41] [Music]
[2:38:45] soldiers so the devil hit a
[2:38:47] self-destruct
[2:38:48] countdown
[2:38:52] Hallelujah you imagine why Satan will be
[2:38:54] so mad when this bride leaves this Earth
[2:38:57] he will go after the remnant because he
[2:38:59] recognized he couldn't get you he tried
[2:39:00] to get you here he tried to get you
[2:39:02] there he tried to stop you there he
[2:39:04] tried to stop you there but the Holy
[2:39:06] Ghost finds you wherever you are and the
[2:39:08] transforming work of power the Rapture
[2:39:11] of Revelation in you he could never get
[2:39:13] to it because it's deep inside of you
[2:39:16] and brother brandham said for Satan to
[2:39:18] get there he has to come under the blood
[2:39:21] and he can never come under the
[2:39:23] blood he can't access what's under the
[2:39:26] blood and we are under need the blood
[2:39:28] where the devil could do us no harm no
[2:39:34] harm but the random said for the devil
[2:39:37] to get to you he has to come under the
[2:39:39] blood and be like your brother but he
[2:39:41] can never subject himself to that he
[2:39:43] believes and trembles but the blood is
[2:39:45] for you the blood is for your family the
[2:39:48] blood is for your situation the blood is
[2:39:50] for your healing the blood is for your
[2:39:54] Redemption
[2:39:56] Hallelujah so I thinkk I mean I was so I
[2:39:59] was trying to contain myself you know
[2:40:00] how I love scriptures so I said let me
[2:40:03] go and check that out there boy and and
[2:40:05] and and the Bible said that they walked
[2:40:06] into the fiery furnace they fell on
[2:40:08] their feet because they were
[2:40:11] bound do they arrived there b so the
[2:40:13] king dealing with his own crisis he said
[2:40:15] look I lost my best men and then on top
[2:40:18] of that these men who fell don't bong
[2:40:20] now they're not even bong no more
[2:40:23] because they've been loosed Inside the
[2:40:25] Fire the same fire that was judgment for
[2:40:28] the world is freedom for the pride
[2:40:31] because the chains that bound you now
[2:40:33] you're loose now these brothers shaking
[2:40:35] hands in the fire the Forman in the fire
[2:40:38] and they having a Revival the same water
[2:40:41] that was Noah's Deliverance was the same
[2:40:43] water that was judgment the same Rapture
[2:40:47] that's for our Escape is the same
[2:40:49] rapture that will be judgment to the
[2:40:51] world I am so happy on this Resurrection
[2:40:56] Sunday can we give the Lord a shout of
[2:41:00] Praise
[2:41:02] Hallelujah I'm going to leave one thing
[2:41:05] with you before we go we read that
[2:41:09] scripture
[2:41:11] where in St
[2:41:14] Mark he said go your way tell his
[2:41:18] disciples and the people
[2:41:21] [Music]
[2:41:22] Peter disciples and Peter he didn't say
[2:41:25] disciples and
[2:41:28] Matthew he didn't say his disciples and
[2:41:30] John he didn't say his disciples and
[2:41:33] James he had his disciples and Peter
[2:41:35] because it was one thing to deal with
[2:41:36] the grief and The Agony and the loss of
[2:41:39] Jesus dying but Peter had his own Agony
[2:41:42] and his grief and his loss because Peter
[2:41:45] never thought that he would backslide
[2:41:48] am Peter said I would never deny you
[2:41:52] Peter never thought that he would be out
[2:41:54] of Fellowship because it was apparent
[2:41:56] that the disciples were here and Peter
[2:41:58] was somewhere here so he said go find
[2:42:01] your disciples and tell them I'm a li
[2:42:02] but I want you to go find brother Peter
[2:42:05] so I don't know if there's a Peter here
[2:42:06] this morning because Peter became the
[2:42:09] rock Peter was a he's the one who talk
[2:42:12] with the Lively stones and shap stones
[2:42:15] but Peter end up in a bad way because he
[2:42:18] did something he didn't even expect to
[2:42:19] do so I want to encourage you this
[2:42:22] morning he is risen from the dead and
[2:42:25] God's word this morning is to the
[2:42:26] disciples and to Peter who would be the
[2:42:29] one on the day of Pentecost to say these
[2:42:32] men are not drunk as you suppose but
[2:42:34] this is that which was spoken by the
[2:42:37] prophet Malachi for and the church say
[2:42:40] Amen may the Lord richly bless you so
[2:42:44] far announcements do remember with the
[2:42:46] stepanus in prayer as he prepares the
[2:42:49] journey home tomorrow Lord willing and
[2:42:52] also remember Pastor in prayer I think
