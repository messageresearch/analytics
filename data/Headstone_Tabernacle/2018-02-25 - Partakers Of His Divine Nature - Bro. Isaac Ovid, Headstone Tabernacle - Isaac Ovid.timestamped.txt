[1:03:49] hospital I waited for them to bring her
[1:03:51] up on the ward since I am so grateful to
[1:03:54] God that I was there to witness for
[1:03:56] myself the glory of Almighty God that
[1:03:58] shown on my daughter's face as they
[1:04:00] wheeled her into the ward he was amazed
[1:04:02] and everyone that visited her saw it and
[1:04:04] exclaim as I did it stayed with her for
[1:04:06] days even the doctors and nurses saw it
[1:04:09] every person that came into contact with
[1:04:11] her knew it it was the grace of God
[1:04:12] Felicia was up and the very next day
[1:04:14] after surgery was walking and shattered
[1:04:16] so much so that the nurse that was
[1:04:19] helping her had to remind Felicia that
[1:04:21] it was just a couple of hours ago
[1:04:22] she had a major surgery and that she
[1:04:24] needed to take it easy as Felicia had
[1:04:27] gone ahead of the nurse who stopped and
[1:04:29] look at her in amazement I told my
[1:04:31] daughter long before the surgery that
[1:04:33] this time around the doctors would know
[1:04:36] that the success of a surgery was more
[1:04:38] than just man that it was Almighty God
[1:04:40] himself the morning of a post operation
[1:04:44] when all the surgeon doctors and interns
[1:04:47] came to her bedside a surgeon told her
[1:04:50] they were means at how well the surgery
[1:04:52] went and how easy it was to perform that
[1:04:55] it blew their minds those doctors know
[1:04:57] it wasn't them alone they may not choose
[1:04:59] to admit it but they know that a greater
[1:05:01] power was in the room the head surgeon
[1:05:04] commended Felicia for being such a good
[1:05:07] patient he went further to tanker in
[1:05:10] front of the doctors for tank in front
[1:05:13] of them of the doctors for tanking he
[1:05:15] turned and told the doctors that that
[1:05:17] even though Felicia
[1:05:18] under heavy sedation she called out his
[1:05:21] name and tanked him he sent in all his
[1:05:24] years or in the year in all his years of
[1:05:26] as a doctor no one has ever done that
[1:05:29] and he turned back to Felicia and told

[1:10:42] just before you have your seats just
[1:10:45] want to read one portion of Scripture
[1:10:46] unless you have to find it from
[1:10:48] Zechariah chapter 10 verse 1 he said
[1:10:50] oxys the Lord reign in the time of
[1:10:52] Lateran so the Lord shall make bright
[1:10:54] clothes and give them the showers of
[1:10:56] rain to everyone in the field or bless
[1:10:58] you you may be seated
[1:11:00] oh praise the Lord so before you hear
[1:11:06] the word this morning and but Isaac went
[1:11:08] to present to you the gospel of the
[1:11:11] kingdom amen something like to share
[1:11:15] with you before he comes on I guess all
[1:11:18] of you who might know but a Billy Billy
[1:11:21] Graham died twenty first of all that's
[1:11:25] Wednesday the age of ninety nine years
[1:11:28] old he was born this 7th of November
[1:11:31] 1918 and you know what about a random
[1:11:34] said about him or robots as to angels
[1:11:37] that was sent on to Sodom and he was the
[1:11:40] third of course that stayed with the
[1:11:42] elect on the backs of the desert he
[1:11:45] identified Greyhound GRE GM six letters
[1:11:47] but we know that brother Branham his
[1:11:50] name of seven letters and these two
[1:11:52] angels were sent to Sarang and that
[1:11:54] interest sent to Saddam was the voice of
[1:11:57] warning the voice of judgment and I
[1:12:00] believe that Billy Graham is a sign of
[1:12:03] ACLU's in era hero of God's servants and
[1:12:06] messengers
[1:12:08] and Christ to the world we know Billy
[1:12:11] Graham he was presented not just
[1:12:14] justification but repentance in a big
[1:12:16] way no robots were the Pentecostals and
[1:12:19] go to come off the scene and now we're
[1:12:22] Graham is off the scene also and but a
[1:12:24] Branham is also off the scene so what's
[1:12:27] next well judgment is next what's next
[1:12:31] the sixth seal is next judgment a lot of
[1:12:34] things that we you know figure we can't
[1:12:38] overcome and this and that all that will
[1:12:40] soon change because what's about a hit
[1:12:43] is gonna be worldwide it's not just this
[1:12:45] country and that country you're going to
[1:12:46] be worldwide judgment going to be can
[1:12:49] distract the earth but I call it the
[1:12:51] beginning of Sorrows you're not talking
[1:12:54] about tribulation you just over at the
[1:12:55] beginning of Sorrows rumors of wars
[1:12:58] discipline that happening men hot
[1:13:01] feeling for fear for the things that
[1:13:02] accompany earth so it's gonna be a
[1:13:04] shaken time a rocking time we have
[1:13:07] children we have grandchildren we have
[1:13:08] loved ones but we have to understand
[1:13:11] that we are right on the direct prophecy
[1:13:13] it's not just garden together as a
[1:13:15] church to have good church service go
[1:13:18] send a messenger to reveal the whole
[1:13:20] secret of God for eruption of the church
[1:13:23] and there's a promise of latter rain
[1:13:25] that has yet to come
[1:13:27] I'm not talking about service an
[1:13:28] atmosphere I'm talk about a tureen the
[1:13:31] or drawing of the spirit that make
[1:13:33] manifest what God has promised I didn't
[1:13:35] promise a loitering God that's it
[1:13:37] God promised a Lazzarini he's going to
[1:13:40] send it are you looking for it it's
[1:13:42] going to come because the rain when the
[1:13:44] manifest every seed falls could evil
[1:13:48] wicked every seed the rain gonna bring
[1:13:51] for every scene and everything will
[1:13:53] produce after this kind but it's a
[1:13:55] perfect man seed there are faith in it
[1:13:58] virtue in it not that will bring forward
[1:14:01] after its kind there's gonna be perfect
[1:14:04] sons walking on this earth I don't care
[1:14:06] what your senses tell you right now this
[1:14:08] is a prophecy that can feel that can
[1:14:11] fall or glory to God amen

[1:25:13] prison but Brannon there will be a
[1:25:16] ministry that will show great wonders
[1:25:20] Joelle said so but there will be no time
[1:25:24] for redemption it is all over the llamas
[1:25:29] don't took the book he's redeemed is
[1:25:31] over as Jesus first preached and was
[1:25:33] rejected and went and haunted those and
[1:25:36] preached them that were in prison that
[1:25:38] could not repent no time for salvation
[1:25:41] that same ministry will have to repeat
[1:25:43] again what if it could be the tipple to
[1:25:47] the eternal loss what if it is here why
[1:25:50] did that vision come when I was a kid
[1:25:52] why did I never think of it before he
[1:25:55] went on they never repented lost souls
[1:25:57] and I preached the words they get the
[1:25:59] Muybridge the wool said get there's no
[1:26:01] repentance the lamb took his book
[1:26:04] remember the seven seals ready to try to
[1:26:06] be open to succeed rather he hid the
[1:26:08] seventh seal let's continue and watch
[1:26:11] and continue some friends that is what's
[1:26:17] coming G first ministry what it was
[1:26:20] healing the sick Jesus ministry second
[1:26:23] part prophesy and that's the part that
[1:26:25] is tough because you puffy sign of what
[1:26:29] is to come but the Tillet ministry when
[1:26:31] the confirmation come the prophecies all

[1:26:48] and whatever DogWatch shut no man not
[1:26:52] even though I could open or whatever god
[1:26:54] door open no man could shut amen so I'll
[1:26:57] close with this a dream but but Anthony
[1:27:01] sent me this dream he said I am writing
[1:27:04] the fall injury I didn't know used to
[1:27:05] dream but Anthony never heard you said a
[1:27:07] dream before but dreaming a dream I know
[1:27:10] the Bible
[1:27:11] give young men dreams never hurt no
[1:27:13] Dundee dreaming you sure you didn't
[1:27:16] drink anything that night all right her
[1:27:18] I said no no so he dreamed the dream all
[1:27:21] right
[1:27:22] I'm right in the following dream I had
[1:27:24] this morning Saturday 24 February 2018 I
[1:27:26] dreamed I was in a sub urban housing
[1:27:29] area it was even in time Sun was just in
[1:27:32] his last light I remember being on the
[1:27:34] street and thinking how did I get here
[1:27:37] after this I saw people coming out of
[1:27:39] the houses and they were staring at the
[1:27:41] sky families came out of the houses with
[1:27:44] their children and they were all looking
[1:27:46] for something outside something's out
[1:27:47] some shouted saying did you see it here
[1:27:49] I didn't know what they were looking up
[1:27:51] at so I decided to look in the direction
[1:27:53] of the interest and I looked I saw full
[1:27:56] moon in the sky there all of a sudden a
[1:27:58] flash of lightning came down from the
[1:28:00] heavens pass through the moon I'm struck
[1:28:03] it'll be neat and after this I saw the
[1:28:05] moon immediately changed color from pale
[1:28:07] white to a fierce concern red it had an
[1:28:11] evil and eerie aura in the night sky the
[1:28:13] sky itself was red seemed to be on fire
[1:28:16] it was awful and scary night the
[1:28:19] families around me were in shock are the
[1:28:20] events that was taken place at this
[1:28:22] point
[1:28:23] you bet over seemed to appear next to me
[1:28:25] saying look at the moon it is the
[1:28:27] judgment to judgments of the Lord and
[1:28:29] then when I looked at the moon I looked
[1:28:31] closer and I noticed the craters of the
[1:28:34] moon began to shape itself into the
[1:28:36] image of a lion then you proceeded to
[1:28:38] say look and see it is the land it is
[1:28:41] God's Authority then as soon as this
[1:28:43] happened the earth began to wobble and
[1:28:45] convulse and people got scared then you
[1:28:48] point it over to the dissonance said
[1:28:49] things will begin to take place this
[1:28:51] believe me no more snows not sooner and
[1:28:53] you said that when the dreams room me to
[1:28:56] a city where I could see a tower
[1:28:58] beginning to crumble and fall people
[1:29:00] were horrified on their faces a mother
[1:29:03] grabbed her children and ran back inside
[1:29:05] their houses locking their doors
[1:29:06] everyone was screaming everyone was
[1:29:09] scared then you continue to see this
[1:29:11] place would be no more that fish would
[1:29:13] be no more there's another country that
[1:29:14] we cannot see now it has been utterly
[1:29:16] destroyed it was if you knew everything
[1:29:18] that was about to take place before it
[1:29:20] happened it contained
[1:29:21] roar and shake with violence as the
[1:29:24] scream begin loud and louder until I
[1:29:26] woke up end of dream I don't
[1:29:28] altogether know what it means what I
[1:29:29] feel is connected to the conv Lord which
[1:29:31] is close at hand god bless you beloved
[1:29:33] but a-huntin a pretty name of the Lord

[1:35:37] of the word and the opening of our
[1:35:39] understanding in the name of Jesus and
[1:35:42] the church says Amen I like to greet you
[1:35:45] this morning in the precious name of
[1:35:46] Jesus Christ special welcome to brother
[1:35:49] Michael Mac Mayo god bless you the Macra
[1:35:52] to see you welcome home god bless you
[1:35:56] richly so without any hesitation can we
[1:36:01] go straight to the scripture we want to
[1:36:03] read from one portion of Scripture thank
[1:36:06] you musicians reading from second Peter
[1:36:09] one very familiar passage of Scripture
[1:36:14] and it's very difficult to see that you
[1:36:19] have a favorite scripture because all
[1:36:21] Scripture is given by God but for me
[1:36:24] personally this
[1:36:26] text speaks to me in a real special way
[1:36:29] and I really hold it close to my heart
[1:36:32] not just what is said but even the fact
[1:36:38] that God could use Peter to say it
[1:36:40] because Peter has a very interesting
[1:36:42] story so when he speaks is interesting
[1:36:45] how God could take a man who denied him
[1:36:47] and use him like this how God could take
[1:36:50] a man who fell and use him like this a
[1:36:52] man who backs lid and use him like this
[1:36:55] you know so second Peter one reading
[1:36:58] first one Simon Pizza a servant and an
[1:37:02] apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[1:37:05] have obtained like precious feet with us
[1:37:08] through the righteousness of God and our
[1:37:11] Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be
[1:37:15] multiplied unto you through the
[1:37:16] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[1:37:19] according as his divine power have given
[1:37:23] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:37:26] life and godliness through the knowledge
[1:37:29] of him that had called us to glory and
[1:37:31] virtue whereby are given unto us
[1:37:35] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:37:38] that by visa might be partakers of the
[1:37:41] divine nature having escaped the
[1:37:44] corruption that is in the world through
[1:37:46] lust and besides this giving all
[1:37:49] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[1:37:51] to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[1:37:53] temperance and to temperance patience
[1:37:56] and to patience godliness and to
[1:37:57] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:37:59] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[1:38:02] things be in you and abound so is not
[1:38:05] just be in you but abound as in living
[1:38:08] dwell in Venis present but being
[1:38:10] manifested they make you that he shall
[1:38:12] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[1:38:15] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:38:18] he that lacketh these things is blind
[1:38:20] and cannot see afar off and hath
[1:38:22] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:38:25] old sins wherefore the rather brethren
[1:38:29] give diligence to make your calling this
[1:38:32] is the individual part make your calling
[1:38:35] and election sure for if he do these
[1:38:38] things
[1:38:39] shall never fall for so an entrance
[1:38:41] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[1:38:44] into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord
[1:38:47] and Savior Jesus Christ no this is pizza
[1:38:51] testifying from his heart
[1:38:53] wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[1:38:56] you always in remembrance of these
[1:38:59] things so I want you to really see
[1:39:03] Peter's burden here though he know them
[1:39:06] and be established in the present truth
[1:39:10] yeah I think it meets in other words
[1:39:13] he's saying here I think it's fit as
[1:39:15] long as I am in this Tabernacle in this
[1:39:18] body this physical appearance to stir
[1:39:21] you up by putting you into remembrance
[1:39:23] and that's what we are here to do this
[1:39:25] morning knowing that shortly I must put
[1:39:28] off this might Tabernacle even as our
[1:39:31] Lord Jesus Christ had showed me moreover
[1:39:34] I will endeavor that ye may be able
[1:39:36] after my decease to have these things
[1:39:40] always in remembrance for we have not
[1:39:43] followed cunningly devised fables when
[1:39:46] we made known unto you the power and
[1:39:49] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were
[1:39:52] eyewitnesses of his majesty for he
[1:39:55] received from God the Father honor and
[1:39:58] glory when there came such a voice to
[1:40:00] him from the excellent glory this is my
[1:40:03] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[1:40:06] and this voice which came from heaven we
[1:40:09] heard when we were with him in the holy
[1:40:11] mount we have also a more sure word of
[1:40:15] prophecy whereunto he do well that you
[1:40:18] take heed as unto a light that shine it
[1:40:21] in a dark place until the day dawn and
[1:40:24] the day star arise in your hands knowing
[1:40:27] this first that no prophecy of the
[1:40:30] scripture is of any private
[1:40:33] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[1:40:36] in old time by the will of man but holy
[1:40:40] men of God spake as they were moved by
[1:40:43] the Holy Ghost be the Lord and a
[1:40:46] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:40:48] may be seated
[1:40:50] this morning hallelujah are you happy to
[1:40:54] be in the house of the Lord he many many
[1:40:58] men I had the trials and testings good
[1:41:04] [Music]
[1:41:06] did you have enough trials and testings
[1:41:08] this week enough suffering this week
[1:41:14] because the sufferings of this present
[1:41:17] time are not worthy to be compared with
[1:41:19] the glory which shall be revealed in us
[1:41:22] and we said last week the suffering that
[1:41:25] we go through a design for us for our
[1:41:27] character development is that right can
[1:41:30] the church say man so last week I'm
[1:41:33] trying to continue a bit from last week
[1:41:35] when we spoke on a new heart a new
[1:41:37] spirit his spirit and we took it from
[1:41:40] Ezekiel in the Old Testament but this
[1:41:43] morning I went to endeavor by the Holy
[1:41:45] goes to take it from the New Testament
[1:41:46] to quote what Peter said in verse 4
[1:41:51] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:41:53] great and precious promises that by
[1:41:56] these he might be partakers of the
[1:41:59] divine nature having escaped the
[1:42:01] corruption that is in the world through
[1:42:03] lust so my title this morning is
[1:42:05] partakers of his divine nature and my
[1:42:10] subject by these exceeding great and
[1:42:13] precious promises and an inspiration a
[1:42:16] new heart a new spirit his spirit and
[1:42:20] the church saimin so just by way of
[1:42:23] introduction I'm not going to be too
[1:42:24] long with you today but in the message
[1:42:26] at Kadesh Barnea
[1:42:28] but the Menem says this is just but the
[1:42:30] Anthony says you just test the
[1:42:31] temperature what we need today is a good
[1:42:34] all-time st. Paul's revival and the
[1:42:36] Bible holy goes back into the church
[1:42:39] again education will never do it
[1:42:42] denomination will never do it they'll
[1:42:45] never be an organization ever substitute
[1:42:48] the Upper Room experience there will
[1:42:51] never be a school that will ever take
[1:42:53] the place of Pentecost it can't be but
[1:42:56] it's not by power not by might but by my
[1:42:59] spirit sail
[1:43:01] that's what we need today is back to the
[1:43:04] Bible experience Christians that are
[1:43:07] born-again that I washed in the blood of
[1:43:10] the Lamb mere white regenerated
[1:43:13] twice-born
[1:43:15] can the church say Amen so last week
[1:43:18] when we spoke of a new heart I'm gonna
[1:43:20] give you a new spirit I'm gonna give you
[1:43:22] I'm gonna put a new spirit in there it
[1:43:25] was really mapping from Ezekiel's voice
[1:43:28] the movement from your own self to a new
[1:43:32] individual a new creation it does
[1:43:34] mapping out a movement from your own
[1:43:37] nature to a different kind of nature can
[1:43:41] the church say man but pizza is speaking
[1:43:44] and he's encouraging people and you see
[1:43:46] we have got a lot of promises but by
[1:43:49] these exceeding greed precious promises
[1:43:52] these promises give us access to another
[1:43:56] nature it gives us access to partake of
[1:44:00] a divine nature can the church say man
[1:44:04] Oh hallelujah we're warming up this
[1:44:07] morning now everything has a nature when
[1:44:13] you talk about the nature of something
[1:44:15] you are referring to the inherent
[1:44:18] character or basic constitution of a
[1:44:22] person or thing
[1:44:24] so nature refers to character which
[1:44:28] could mean behavior it also refers to
[1:44:31] the constitution of something so water
[1:44:34] has a nature when you boil water it
[1:44:38] becomes steam that's the nature of water
[1:44:41] when you freeze water it becomes ice
[1:44:44] that's the nature of water the Prophet
[1:44:48] preached a message God being identified
[1:44:50] by his characteristics in other word God
[1:44:53] being identified by his nature God being
[1:44:57] identified by his behavior God being
[1:44:59] identified by his attributes God being
[1:45:02] identified by his elements God being
[1:45:05] identified by his composition so
[1:45:07] everything has a nature this
[1:45:09] puppet has a nature the ground I'm
[1:45:11] walking on has a nature a bird has a
[1:45:14] nature its nature is not to swim the
[1:45:17] nature of a bird is to fly a fish has a
[1:45:20] nature anybody with me this morning so
[1:45:27] let's dig a little deeper a thing is by
[1:45:29] nature it's essential characteristics a
[1:45:33] rock for example is composed of minerals
[1:45:37] it tends to be hard and brittle not
[1:45:40] bendable it is an object formed in or on
[1:45:45] the earth by processes not by human
[1:45:48] effort that is its nature so not only do
[1:45:54] inanimate objects have a nature but
[1:45:57] animate objects have a nature also in
[1:46:00] fact where the Branham says when God
[1:46:02] places men he gives even men apostles
[1:46:05] preachers a nature
[1:46:08] for the job at hand but now Peter is
[1:46:11] exhorting us that God has given us some
[1:46:14] promises and by these great promises we
[1:46:18] could become partakers not of our nature
[1:46:21] but partakers of the divine nature that
[1:46:25] was a Branham called his nature can the
[1:46:27] church amen
[1:46:30] so just as the moon has a nature and the
[1:46:34] Sun has a nature and the sea has a
[1:46:36] nature and salt has a nature and sugar
[1:46:39] has a nature and the car you drive is
[1:46:42] made up of elements that have their own
[1:46:43] nature so to God as a nature and his
[1:46:47] nature is called a divine in nature can
[1:46:50] the church amen and we as a people have
[1:46:54] a promise to be partakers to be
[1:47:00] partakers of that nature
[1:47:04] now merriam-webster defines Partick as
[1:47:08] to share so we're talking about sharing
[1:47:14] that nature to take part in to take part
[1:47:19] in that nature or experience something
[1:47:23] experience that nature along with others
[1:47:27] it goes on to have a portion so I can
[1:47:30] have a portion so when pizza is talking
[1:47:33] about partakers of that nature it means
[1:47:36] we get our own portion of that nature to
[1:47:39] possess or share a certain nature or
[1:47:42] attribute so Peter was speaking and he
[1:47:45] says I will do everything in my power to
[1:47:48] remind you while I'm in this flesh I
[1:47:51] want to encourage you that is a
[1:47:54] different nature that you are called for
[1:47:57] and forgot to get that nature to you he
[1:48:00] couldn't just do it anyhow he gave it to
[1:48:03] you in the form of promises because with
[1:48:05] all these promises without these bright
[1:48:09] promises without these word promises
[1:48:12] with all these seven thunder promises
[1:48:16] you can't touch that nature but because
[1:48:19] we have promises it gives us permission
[1:48:22] to partake in it or you know hear me
[1:48:27] this morning the promises give us
[1:48:30] permission to get a portion of the
[1:48:33] nature the promises give us permission
[1:48:37] to go after our children because the
[1:48:41] promise says the promise is unto you and
[1:48:43] to your children so because there's a
[1:48:46] promise the nature of God to go after
[1:48:49] your family you can partake in his
[1:48:53] divine nature and speak to your children
[1:48:56] has nothing to do with your condition
[1:48:59] it's based on his promise he's exceeding
[1:49:03] great and precious promises
[1:49:08] somebody please back to me somebody
[1:49:12] please back to me now you may be seated
[1:49:15] I had to do some research because
[1:49:18] exceeding great we don't write that way
[1:49:20] in English exceeding great was like same
[1:49:23] greatly great Peter ran out the woods
[1:49:28] he said exceeding great and precious so
[1:49:31] in case you wondering how could these
[1:49:33] things are you could be in your
[1:49:34] condition but because of this exceeding
[1:49:38] great and precious promises that's all
[1:49:40] you need for you to partake in the
[1:49:45] divine nature so hold on you may be
[1:49:51] seated
[1:49:52] the promises how could enough even when
[1:49:57] it's not manifested yet to take you into
[1:50:00] that nature you don't hear me this
[1:50:02] morning many of us we waited for
[1:50:05] manifestation and Peter seemed to leave
[1:50:07] and wait for the manifestation the
[1:50:09] promise is good enough it's an exceeding
[1:50:12] great promise it's a precious promise
[1:50:14] and that promise is good enough for you
[1:50:17] to worship good enough for you to shout
[1:50:21] [Applause]
[1:50:25] you may be seated you may be seated
[1:50:30] so Sampson he was a partaker of the
[1:50:34] divine nature because the nature of man
[1:50:37] by the Clarence is sinful the nature of
[1:50:39] man is fallen the nature of man is a lie
[1:50:42] the nature of man is to steal the nature
[1:50:45] of manage to do what he wants to do your
[1:50:47] nature is against God's nature so when
[1:50:50] Samson was able to lift up the gate that
[1:50:53] was blocking him that was not Samson
[1:50:55] nature Samson was able to reach into the
[1:50:57] divine nature and access a power that he
[1:51:00] did not have you don't hear me this
[1:51:02] morning and how did Samson excessive but
[1:51:05] the Branum said Samson connected to the
[1:51:08] prophecy or the promise that was given
[1:51:10] to Abraham that I seed shall possess the
[1:51:14] kids of the enemy so that exceeding
[1:51:16] great promise somewhere back in Genesis
[1:51:20] was good enough for Samson to become a
[1:51:23] partaker of the divine nature you don't
[1:51:27] hear me this Mona
[1:51:30] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:51:35] somebody give us our appraised
[1:51:43] Joshua was a partaker of the divine
[1:51:46] nature he was in the middle of a battle
[1:51:48] and he knew that he had the devil on the
[1:51:51] run like I believe this morning we have
[1:51:54] the devil on the run we started weeks
[1:51:56] ago every surface we given the devil a
[1:51:59] knockout punch every service and Joshua
[1:52:03] knew he had the devil on the run
[1:52:08] but also had a problem the Sun was going
[1:52:12] down but we had to reach beyond himself
[1:52:15] because he couldn't stop it but when he
[1:52:18] spoke to show you he's accessing the
[1:52:21] divine nature
[1:52:22] he said son stand still you may be
[1:52:27] seated I've said this before the show is
[1:52:29] divine nature he was connected to the
[1:52:32] Sun is not what moves is the earth
[1:52:34] rotates around the Sun he reached into
[1:52:37] the divine nature with his request
[1:52:39] because he was built on a promise that
[1:52:41] every place the sole of his foot said
[1:52:44] upon that is his land no man shall be
[1:52:47] able to stand before thee all the tears
[1:52:49] of my life as I was with Moses so I'm
[1:52:52] gonna be with you
[1:52:54] Joshua understood the promises for his
[1:52:58] game and the promises for his did give
[1:53:01] him access to partake of the divine
[1:53:05] nature please that Sun stand still and
[1:53:10] God said stop the earth God translated
[1:53:16] stop the earth just what didn't matter
[1:53:20] what needed to be stopped all he knew
[1:53:23] the devil was on the run and we got to
[1:53:25] finish the devil once we have him on the
[1:53:28] run
[1:53:28] [Applause]
[1:53:34] come to church amen
[1:53:37] [Applause]
[1:53:41] hallelujah everybody feelin fine
[1:53:46] everybody feelin fine we came to church
[1:53:49] to worship we came to get out of the
[1:53:51] humanistic realm and get out of our
[1:53:53] nature and get into his nature isn't
[1:53:56] that right whoo but the Branham was a
[1:54:00] partaker of the divine nature before the
[1:54:06] doctors hand touches my wife that wasn't
[1:54:11] his nature that was the nature of God
[1:54:13] where did that happen before when Jesus
[1:54:18] was here Centurion came to him and said
[1:54:22] listen my servant is sick
[1:54:25] I'm not even wood if you to come to my
[1:54:28] house but I'm a man and authority when I
[1:54:32] say to one go he goes when I tell him
[1:54:35] come he comes
[1:54:36] I recognize the authority that you have
[1:54:38] so if you could just speak to it that's
[1:54:41] enough for me
[1:54:43] and Jesus said could I wear a servant
[1:54:46] this healed that Centurion got home and
[1:54:49] didn't ask if he was healed he asked
[1:54:52] what time
[1:54:54] I want to see how fast it took because
[1:54:58] healing is not the issue I want to see
[1:55:00] how how how immediate the response was
[1:55:03] so don't consider it's strange when the
[1:55:07] Prophet says before the doctors hand
[1:55:09] touches my wife because that's a time
[1:55:11] element now he's tracking the progress
[1:55:13] of what the doctor is doing wherever the
[1:55:15] doctor is the tumor has to go down he
[1:55:18] connected to the divine nature of God
[1:55:21] can the church say man so you may be
[1:55:26] seated
[1:55:27] so can we talk about going a little bit
[1:55:30] [Applause]
[1:55:31] because I don't want to spend time
[1:55:35] talking about our nature because you
[1:55:39] know yourself
[1:55:43] but I want to focus on his nature
[1:55:46] because the promise is the partake of
[1:55:48] his nature is that right so I'm gonna
[1:55:50] use some scriptures in the book of
[1:55:51] numbers 23:19 the Bible said God is not
[1:55:55] man that he should lie that's his nature
[1:56:02] in John 4:24 says God is spirit that's
[1:56:08] his nature in Luke 24:39 Jesus said a
[1:56:13] spirit doesn't have flesh and bones
[1:56:16] that's his nature job in trying to
[1:56:20] describe the nature of God said in job
[1:56:23] 23 and verse 8 behold I go forward but
[1:56:26] he is not there I'm black what but I
[1:56:29] can't perceive him when he acts on the
[1:56:31] left
[1:56:31] I cannot behold him he chosen the right
[1:56:33] I cannot see him his nature is different
[1:56:37] than anything you've ever encountered in
[1:56:39] Isaiah describing is nature I see a
[1:56:43] sister whom when you liken me and make
[1:56:45] me equal and compare me that we should
[1:56:48] be alike I am God and there is no one
[1:56:51] like me we are talking about the nature
[1:56:54] of God is any buddy in the house this
[1:56:57] morning who wants to get caught up in
[1:57:00] the heavenlies
[1:57:01] [Applause]
[1:57:05] what we will discover as we go into the
[1:57:07] world it becomes already hard to define
[1:57:09] him it becomes very hard we can say
[1:57:12] water is h2o that's that's the nature
[1:57:15] that's the elements of it but what are
[1:57:18] the elements of God Exodus 3 and verse
[1:57:20] 13 and Moses said unto God behold when I
[1:57:23] come with to the chairman of Israel and
[1:57:25] shall say unto them the god of your
[1:57:27] father's had sent me unto you and they
[1:57:29] shall see to me what is his name what
[1:57:32] shall I see entered them I'm consonant
[1:57:35] to Moses I am that I am and he said thou
[1:57:38] shalt thou say the children of Israel I
[1:57:40] am hath sent me unto you I am whatever
[1:57:44] you need I am whatever you want that is
[1:57:47] the nature of God Isaiah 43 and 10
[1:57:50] before me there was no God for man
[1:57:53] there'll be none after me
[1:57:58] isaiah 44:6 that says the lord the king
[1:58:01] of israel and his redeemer the lord of
[1:58:04] hosts i am the first and i am the last
[1:58:06] and there is no god beside me that's the
[1:58:09] nature of God Sam's not a tree to die
[1:58:12] strong this is David's attempt to
[1:58:15] describe the nature of God that drone is
[1:58:17] established from of all and Oh out from
[1:58:20] everlasting oh you could be from
[1:58:22] everlasting
[1:58:23] what type of nature is this anybody in
[1:58:27] the house this morning
[1:58:28] anybody's personal house this morning
[1:58:31] Sam's 90 verse 2 before the mountains
[1:58:34] were born or dog leaders give birth to
[1:58:36] the earth and the world even from
[1:58:39] everlasting to everlasting thou art God
[1:58:41] for a thousand years in thy sight like
[1:58:43] yesterday when it passes by all I saw
[1:58:46] watching the night sounds 102 but dole
[1:58:51] lured us abide forever and I mean to all
[1:58:54] generations of all doubted has found it
[1:58:57] and the heavens are the work of thy hand
[1:58:59] even D will perish were told us endure
[1:59:02] and all of them will wail like a comment
[1:59:05] like clothing dough will change them and
[1:59:07] they will be changed but though out the
[1:59:09] seam and the years will not come to an
[1:59:12] end that's the god I'm talking about
[1:59:15] that's the divine nature that I'm
[1:59:18] describing because we are being called
[1:59:20] from the humanistic into divine
[1:59:23] revelation into vision we are being
[1:59:26] called from mortality into immortality
[1:59:29] we are being called
[1:59:32] I want you to know what nature you're
[1:59:42] being called to first Timothy 1:7 now to
[1:59:45] the king eternal immortal invisible the
[1:59:48] only God be honor and glory for ever and
[1:59:51] ever
[1:59:51] second Chronicles 206 who is able to
[1:59:54] build a house for him for the heavens
[1:59:59] and the highest heavens cannot contain
[2:00:00] him so Who am I that I should build a
[2:00:04] house for him
[2:00:04] acceptable incense before him thus saith
[2:00:08] the Lord and Isiah heaven is my throne
[2:00:10] and the earth is my footstool where then
[2:00:13] is a house you could build for me and
[2:00:15] where is a place that I may rest up for
[2:00:17] my hand made all these things does all
[2:00:20] these things came into being declares
[2:00:22] the Lord Jeremiah 23 is this okay with
[2:00:29] you this morning
[2:00:30] can we continue to talk about it you
[2:00:32] know where the prophets and when we talk
[2:00:34] about and he draws near
[2:00:35] he loves to Cathy he loves to get the
[2:00:40] praises he loves her get the adoration
[2:00:42] he loves when we describe him we sing
[2:00:45] that song lift Jesus higher lift him up
[2:00:48] for the world to see
[2:00:49] he said if I be lifted up draw minun to
[2:00:53] me that's the God we're talking about
[2:00:55] this morning still alpha still Omega but
[2:00:59] the Branham said his nature is his seven
[2:01:01] compound names his nature is your heart
[2:01:04] IRA his nature is jehova shamma his
[2:01:07] nature is the Havanese
[2:01:09] his nature is your horseshit to knew his
[2:01:12] nature is one holy spirit which he
[2:01:14] divided seven spirits of the true seven
[2:01:18] church ages seven colors through one
[2:01:21] time on that great white light that's
[2:01:25] who he is that's his nature
[2:01:27] that's his being that's his attributes
[2:01:29] and you are promised to be partakers of
[2:01:32] that divine nature
[2:01:36] he cannot get sick when you are partaker
[2:01:40] of his nature sickness can't harm you
[2:01:43] oh he said because I live you are gonna
[2:01:46] live also that divine nature makes you
[2:01:49] invincible makes you unstoppable makes
[2:01:52] it that you cannot be defeated you kind
[2:01:55] of lose a battle you kind of lose a war
[2:01:59] and that's your promise that's my
[2:02:03] promise partakers of his divine nature
[2:02:07] Jeremiah 23 23
[2:02:09] am I your God who is near declares the
[2:02:12] Lord and not a court of owls can a man
[2:02:15] hide himself in hiding places so I do
[2:02:18] not see him declares the Lord
[2:02:20] do I not fill the heavens and the earth
[2:02:22] declares the Lord Psalms 139 where can I
[2:02:26] go from thy spirit oh where can I flee
[2:02:29] from my presence if I ascend to heaven
[2:02:32] though out there if I make my parent
[2:02:34] shield and he'll be all now I hear if I
[2:02:37] take wings of the dawn and if I dwell in
[2:02:40] the remotest part of the sea even there
[2:02:43] my hand will lead me and I right hand
[2:02:46] will lay hold of me that's the nature of
[2:02:50] God he is bigger than your problems he
[2:02:53] is bigger than your situations he is
[2:02:55] bigger than the pain in your body he is
[2:02:58] bigger than your trials he is bigger
[2:03:00] than cancer he is bigger than tyre
[2:03:02] mateesah he is bigger than female
[2:03:04] problems he is bigger than that chapel
[2:03:07] that's trying to hold you back
[2:03:10] somebody give God a shout of praise
[2:03:12] [Applause]
[2:03:19] well Isaac you mean all of this that you
[2:03:23] were describing about Claude you mean I
[2:03:25] could get access to that didn't the
[2:03:27] Prophet teach us that all God was not
[2:03:32] part you know all that God was
[2:03:34] everything he ported to Christ and all
[2:03:37] that he putted the crisis quarter to the
[2:03:39] church has pointed to his peoples
[2:03:42] [Applause]
[2:03:47] the problem is we don't see who we are
[2:03:50] the problem is we don't know who we are
[2:03:53] but the Branham said the moment the
[2:03:55] bride gets to know who she is
[2:03:56] there'll be a national showdown there's
[2:03:59] no army could stop you there's no police
[2:04:01] can stop you there's no government could
[2:04:03] stop you there's no system could stop
[2:04:05] you because you are life of the Lamb you
[2:04:08] look like him you talk like him you have
[2:04:11] his name isn't power his authority
[2:04:13] that's who you are can the church say
[2:04:16] man I'd like to say I'm almost done
[2:04:23] talking about his nature but that's an
[2:04:24] impossibility to talk about his nature
[2:04:26] we'd never have to stop because he is
[2:04:29] from everlasting to everlasting there
[2:04:31] aren't enough words in the English
[2:04:33] language to describe him there aren't
[2:04:36] enough things we could do to give him
[2:04:38] glory because He is God all by himself
[2:04:40] he didn't have to save us what he did he
[2:04:43] didn't have to call us what he did
[2:04:45] because that's a nature of God the
[2:04:48] nature of God is to go after your fallen
[2:04:51] brother
[2:04:51] to go after the fallen sister to comfort
[2:04:54] him that morning to wipe the tears or
[2:04:56] open the blind eyes preach Liberty to
[2:05:00] the captives to sunny revival in your
[2:05:02] home that's the nature of God he can't
[2:05:05] help himself is just who he is it's just
[2:05:08] what he does is just his composition
[2:05:17] halleluyah halleluyah halleluyah go
[2:05:22] somebody help me preach this morning
[2:05:23] Jesus got there by the family later the
[2:05:27] week was going on they were having
[2:05:29] coffee and they were having Crick's they
[2:05:32] were sitting down a morning because
[2:05:34] Lazarus was dead
[2:05:35] and when Jesus cut Mary and Martha said
[2:05:38] to him if you had been here if you were
[2:05:41] come earlier our brother would not have
[2:05:43] died but the divine nature began to
[2:05:46] speak he said I am the resurrection and
[2:05:49] the life
[2:05:50] that's who I am that's how you can
[2:05:52] describe me that's my nature
[2:05:55] [Applause]
[2:06:04] and Jesus said roll away the stone roll
[2:06:08] away the stone I know you trying to
[2:06:09] cover up the messy situation
[2:06:11] you trying to cover up what happened you
[2:06:13] trying to cover up the problem we say
[2:06:15] roll away the stone I need access into
[2:06:17] the problem I need access into the
[2:06:20] failure I need access to the deadness in
[2:06:22] your life don't don't cover it up and
[2:06:24] and to us if it's all over it's not over
[2:06:26] until I say it's over I am the
[2:06:28] resurrection roll away the stone because
[2:06:31] I want to speak to your situation the
[2:06:33] nature of God is a speak and what he
[2:06:36] says is created so you might be dead on
[2:06:38] the inside roll away the stone this
[2:06:40] morning and hear the words of the Lord
[2:06:43] the Lord of God had spoken Luke and what
[2:06:46] prophesy the lion Harad
[2:06:50] somebody give God a shout of praise oh
[2:06:54] and this divine nature is our promise to
[2:06:59] be partakers we read the definition in
[2:07:03] it to have a portion of it
[2:07:05] what did Philip have Philip was a divine
[2:07:08] partaker so when he was in a convention
[2:07:11] and there was a Ethiopian eunuch who was
[2:07:13] reading the scripture trying to find who
[2:07:16] he was in God and God translated Philip
[2:07:19] to where that Ethiopian eunuch was so
[2:07:21] that he could get a word from the Lord
[2:07:23] or that's what I'm talking about he was
[2:07:25] connected to the nature of his Heavenly
[2:07:28] Father it will not be your strength it
[2:07:32] will not be your mind it will not be
[2:07:35] your power your nature is gonna change
[2:07:37] your your behavior it's gonna change
[2:07:42] your walk is gonna change your talk is
[2:07:45] gonna change your life is gonna change
[2:07:48] that's what the Holy Ghost has given for
[2:07:50] to change your nature to change your
[2:07:53] walk up to change your talk that's why
[2:07:56] the Holy Ghost is your promise
[2:07:58] [Applause]
[2:08:14] does anybody wanna change on in nature
[2:08:17] does anyone wanna change at your
[2:08:19] behavior Oh hallelujah
[2:08:22] that's why we have to preach the
[2:08:25] promises because the promises unlock see
[2:08:29] access into the divine nature without a
[2:08:32] promise and a promise is a commitment to
[2:08:35] act in a specific way at a specific time
[2:08:40] we may not know the time but the promise
[2:08:43] sir understands the time so Jesus
[2:08:46] breathe upon them and save you all lies
[2:08:48] send the promise of my father
[2:08:50] tarry in the city of Jerusalem until he
[2:08:54] knew the time he didn't know but it's a
[2:08:55] tarry because they had a promise and
[2:08:57] that promise had him in the Upper Room
[2:08:59] worship and that promise had him in the
[2:09:01] Upper Room separating themselves from
[2:09:03] the world that promise had him in the
[2:09:05] upper room separate from their family
[2:09:08] they were just with their spiritual
[2:09:09] family they were 120 it wasn't everybody
[2:09:12] there this was those who understood the
[2:09:15] promise and receive the promise the
[2:09:17] promise give them access into the divine
[2:09:20] nature because God is a spirit his
[2:09:22] nature express himself a spirit and you
[2:09:25] wanted a pour out the Holy Ghost but no
[2:09:27] Holy Ghost comes unless is a promise we
[2:09:30] to receive it and is a promise for him
[2:09:32] to give it but because we have a promise
[2:09:37] and the promises come to us as prophecy
[2:09:42] that's why the only order or the only
[2:09:45] class able to give us the promises is a
[2:09:47] prophetic order so when the Branham
[2:09:52] student our dear to speak a super Church
[2:09:55] a super race final voice final age
[2:10:00] that's promised and prophecy spoken by a
[2:10:03] star in the right hand of God an angel
[2:10:07] prophet
[2:10:16] and by these exceeding great and
[2:10:19] precious promises I might be tired but I
[2:10:22] got a promise he may be seated
[2:10:25] [Applause]
[2:10:28] sometimes it's hard to see it in the
[2:10:31] spiritual level because we live so much
[2:10:33] in the natural my god he builds it desi
[2:10:35] desi this is this if some wealthy family
[2:10:41] member you never met before said to you
[2:10:43] I promise you that by the end of this
[2:10:45] year I'll pay off your mortgage your car
[2:10:48] payment I'll pay everything for you how
[2:10:50] would that make you feel you know you're
[2:10:57] struggling every month with the payment
[2:10:59] your day your budgeting your fights
[2:11:02] Antonio and somebody says to you by the
[2:11:06] end of this year or thereabouts so it's
[2:11:09] not a specific around the end of the
[2:11:10] year I'm gonna pay off everything for
[2:11:12] you wouldn't your behavior said that she
[2:11:14] needs one time it makes you struggle

[2:11:22] this month and your budget and every
[2:11:23] month at pass the budget such a
[2:11:25] effective less and less sooner because
[2:11:27] you know what this thing is they have a

[2:13:32] sadness there's no sickness

[2:13:53] [Applause]
[2:13:57] hallelujah Oh hallelujah hallelujah the
[2:14:03] divine nature of God Isaiah for my
[2:14:06] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[2:14:08] are your ways my ways so as he heavens
[2:14:10] are higher than the earth so are my ways
[2:14:12] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[2:14:14] than your thoughts when your nature you
[2:14:20] can only think a certain way but with
[2:14:22] his nature your thinking is different
[2:14:24] your own look is different now you can
[2:14:27] count the things that I'm not as doing
[2:14:28] the work because you are partaking of
[2:14:34] His divine nature Oh blessed be the name
[2:14:48] of the Lord now let's go back in Genesis
[2:14:54] a bit just kneeled on a few things you
[2:14:57] have time today because the nature of
[2:15:01] God is long-suffering the nature of God
[2:15:08] is patient the Miche of God as he loves
[2:15:11] he loves he loves worship he loves to
[2:15:14] get your undivided attention he said
[2:15:16] thou shalt have no other gods before me
[2:15:18] your job must be your God your house
[2:15:20] must be your God not even time as you go
[2:15:22] when we come to the house of God we come
[2:15:24] to put him for the second third fourth
[2:15:26] fifth put him everywhere in our lives
[2:15:28] he's let's go back to Genesis in the
[2:15:34] message oneness where the balance said
[2:15:35] that's God's purpose and his purpose as
[2:15:38] father supreme was to be one with his
[2:15:41] family his earthly family Adam and Eve
[2:15:43] and the only way that they could be one
[2:15:46] with the family or God was because God's
[2:15:48] nature was in them so that made them
[2:15:52] with God's nature in them then with each
[2:15:54] other I'm going to become all one isn't
[2:15:56] it a beautiful picture God and his
[2:15:58] family father over all supreme no death
[2:16:02] no sorrow no hot eggs no nothing just
[2:16:06] joy unspeakable never to be sick never
[2:16:10] to have a heart eat just one with God
[2:16:12] what a picture because the very nature
[2:16:14] of God was in these people can the
[2:16:19] church say man and therefore what they
[2:16:23] didn't follow just in line with God and
[2:16:25] golden and made them one so I'm gonna
[2:16:28] speed a few course it has put it in
[2:16:30] context in a message cause provider we
[2:16:32] have approached the fellowship he said
[2:16:34] I'd like to speak on that some night the
[2:16:36] super sign how he'd stretch his tent
[2:16:39] down here to dwell a human being so he's
[2:16:42] seen why Jesus scheme that we might know
[2:16:45] the nature of God
[2:16:49] when we see Jesus we see God in him see
[2:16:53] what God was and God's nature he
[2:16:55] manifested he displayed what God was to
[2:16:58] redeem man back to himself in the
[2:17:05] identified Christ of all Asia but the
[2:17:06] man said you see all these things just
[2:17:08] portrayed Christ he was a part of it God
[2:17:11] doesn't change his nature doesn't change
[2:17:14] his character doesn't change he has
[2:17:16] killed a word see and Malachi 3:6 proves
[2:17:20] that he just cheated his form for each
[2:17:22] age each age he has allotted part of
[2:17:26] word that which has been prophesied
[2:17:28] would happen in certain days well as
[2:17:31] that age comes along gorgeous moves in
[2:17:33] another form but the nature the
[2:17:35] characteristics is still the same I'm
[2:17:38] gonna balance and let it was God and
[2:17:39] Noah it was God in Moses it was God in
[2:17:43] Joshua it was God and Elijah it was God
[2:17:46] in Habakkuk he was Gordon Joelle it was
[2:17:49] God and Amos it was God in Isaiah it was
[2:17:53] Gordon Zakaria it was God in John it was
[2:17:56] all speaking about him
[2:17:58] [Applause]
[2:18:00] [Music]
[2:18:01] [Applause]
[2:18:03] but all these men were partaking of the
[2:18:08] divine nature we preach this before that
[2:18:11] each of the men David was the attribute
[2:18:14] of Shepherd that God had in him because
[2:18:17] none of these men could have been all
[2:18:18] that God was so Elijah was the prophet
[2:18:22] that wasn't God
[2:18:23] Joshua was the portion he was back
[2:18:26] taking of the warrior aspect of God in
[2:18:29] his ministry but when Jesus came he was
[2:18:31] warrior he was Shepherd he was prophet
[2:18:34] he was Lord he was king he was or you
[2:18:37] don't hear me this morning when Jeremiah
[2:18:40] was speaking he was the mourner that's
[2:18:45] all he could have fulfilled but when
[2:18:47] Jesus came he was everything he was the
[2:18:52] divine nature can the church same from
[2:18:59] the message the revelation of Jesus
[2:19:00] Christ from church age books let me show
[2:19:03] you another reason why Satan hits this
[2:19:06] book of the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:19:08] in the church he knows the devil knows
[2:19:11] do you know that Jesus Christ is the
[2:19:14] same yesterday and today and forever the
[2:19:16] devil knows this do you know this and he
[2:19:19] changes not so the devil knows that God
[2:19:22] cannot change he knows that a whole lot
[2:19:25] more and do 90% of the theologians he
[2:19:28] knows that since God is immutable in his
[2:19:31] nature he's the same yesterday today
[2:19:35] forever then he is just as immutable in
[2:19:38] his ways the Satan knows assuredly that
[2:19:43] the original Church at Pentecost with
[2:19:46] the power of God st. mark 16 in action
[2:19:49] is the true church and that that Jesus
[2:19:52] claims as his own all else is false it
[2:19:55] has to be
[2:19:57] can the church say man what are we
[2:20:00] saying realize I'm seeing as we bring it
[2:20:03] to his divine nature it brings a clarity
[2:20:06] to the fact that he's the same yesterday
[2:20:07] today and forever and in the future home
[2:20:11] of the heavenly bridegroom on the
[2:20:12] earthly bride but the Branham said it
[2:20:14] this way if he ever healed a person he
[2:20:17] has to do it again when the same
[2:20:19] conditions is met he ever ever saved the
[2:20:22] man he's got to do it on the same
[2:20:25] grounds he did it the first time and if
[2:20:28] he ever feel a man with the Holy Ghost
[2:20:29] he's got to do it on the same grounds he
[2:20:33] did the first time if he ever raised a
[2:20:35] man up from the grave he's got to do it
[2:20:39] the same time and every other time on
[2:20:42] the same principle because he's the same
[2:20:45] yesterday the same today the same
[2:20:48] forever that's his nature
[2:20:50] that's his being that's his attributes
[2:20:55] so what's holding you back this morning
[2:20:58] from accessing that nature if you are
[2:21:00] put in the same way he is obligated to
[2:21:02] heal you he's obligated to fill you he's
[2:21:05] obligated to restore you can't somebody
[2:21:07] say man so we talked about the nature of
[2:21:22] God now let's talk a little bit about
[2:21:24] the changing of your nature the same way
[2:21:28] we spoke last week I'm not gonna be too
[2:21:29] long with you this morning just
[2:21:31] encourage you a bit from the message why
[2:21:38] it had to be Shepherd but if Adam said
[2:21:41] no you take a pig and you see it - this
[2:21:43] pig I'm going to make you a lamb and you
[2:21:47] wash him and you paint his toenails and
[2:21:50] so forth and give him food like a sheep
[2:21:54] give him some kind of a diet and put
[2:21:58] them out on the floor or out where the
[2:22:01] sheep herd in the alfalfa field or
[2:22:03] something and if there's a mud hole
[2:22:06] anywhere that hog will go just as
[2:22:10] straight to that mud hole as he can go
[2:22:13] see why is because his nature is still a
[2:22:17] hug what was what what what can a nature
[2:22:22] do you have
[2:22:24] this morning we are not here to try to
[2:22:31] wash you paint your toenails give you
[2:22:36] cheap food because if your nature isn't
[2:22:39] changed the first model you see coming
[2:22:43] out the Grammy on the valencian stretch
[2:22:46] you're gonna find yourself in that model
[2:22:50] [Applause]
[2:22:52] because your nature needs to change when
[2:22:59] you wash the pig the washing could take
[2:23:01] so long again you can lock him up in a
[2:23:03] room better Anthony and transport him on
[2:23:06] a truck down the highway and he will
[2:23:09] behave himself because he's locked in a
[2:23:11] cage and that's why some people love
[2:23:14] legalistic church because I locked in a
[2:23:18] cage but you're openly kids the nature
[2:23:23] is still a hog we are not trying to do
[2:23:27] hog Reformation hog like we have any hog
[2:23:30] mining business taeho
[2:23:35] we ain t need your transformation
[2:23:38] business
[2:23:41] your nature is rotten to begin with
[2:23:45] energy allows the mud
[2:23:48] [Applause]
[2:23:53] he may be seated that's why the
[2:23:58] preaching of the word is to identify
[2:24:00] your nature 1 and to point you to the
[2:24:04] change of nature we said in last week
[2:24:09] Peter walked with Jesus talked with
[2:24:12] Jesus he ate with Jesus when all the
[2:24:18] disciples were watching and the city man
[2:24:19] walking on the water Peters Lord of days
[2:24:22] you bid me come and Peter with only Holy
[2:24:26] Ghost stepped out and walked on water
[2:24:30] but his nature was still a hug because
[2:24:36] when Jesus died Peter forgot three and a
[2:24:40] half years in a matter of hours he said
[2:24:42] I need to find my boat who has who has
[2:24:44] my boot and if you remember Peter left
[2:24:52] his boat with a big catch of fish that
[2:24:55] is what caught his attention on that d
[2:24:58] if you remember this story he had fish
[2:24:59] all night and night before court nothing
[2:25:02] was washing his net was packing up Jesus
[2:25:05] came sat on his boat pulled he bought
[2:25:07] off he saw Jesus preach told him cast
[2:25:11] your nets plural into the water
[2:25:12] Peter class-one net gets more fish than
[2:25:15] he ever saw in his life but to get back
[2:25:17] up and help and walked away he leave he
[2:25:19] left his boat and his nets and
[2:25:20] everything and follow Jesus when Jesus
[2:25:23] died it's a comic frantic frantic you
[2:25:26] remember three and a half years ago when
[2:25:29] I left the fishing business you know who
[2:25:30] took the boats who have the nets I was
[2:25:32] two boats I had I left it right here I
[2:25:34] didn't really record where I left it
[2:25:35] you know who have it and then pizza not
[2:25:38] only that's enough he took Matthew who
[2:25:43] was the only disciples went and fish men
[2:25:45] who wasn't even fishermen what might you
[2:25:48] do in the tax any fish
[2:25:53] [Applause]
[2:25:55] but the nature wasn't changed legalism
[2:26:00] doesn't change your nature rules doesn't
[2:26:03] change in nature here in the world
[2:26:06] doesn't even change your nature and take
[2:26:08] the Holy Ghost it's it's fire
[2:26:14] to burn the snake out of your soul burn
[2:26:19] the desires burn the loss under evil
[2:26:23] burn the desire change your behavior
[2:26:26] from the inside out you may be seated
[2:26:35] somebody pitch black to me somebody in
[2:26:38] the house want a change wanna
[2:26:41] transformation
[2:26:42] [Applause]
[2:26:53] [Applause]
[2:26:58] when you meet the pillar of fire friends
[2:27:01] your walk is different your talk is
[2:27:06] different the way you dress is different
[2:27:09] the way you go to work is different
[2:27:12] the way you talk to your co-workers is
[2:27:14] different the way you say hi to your
[2:27:16] neighbor is different the way you pour
[2:27:19] the maxi is different the way you visit
[2:27:21] your family is different the way you
[2:27:23] come to church is different the way you
[2:27:26] greet the usher is different the way you
[2:27:28] greet the deacon is different the way
[2:27:30] you talk to your husband is different
[2:27:32] the way you speak me your wife is
[2:27:34] different because you were once a beggar
[2:27:36] now you are lamb
[2:27:38] now the Holy Ghost now the Dove now the
[2:27:41] angel of the Lord he could direct you to
[2:27:43] go where he wants you to go
[2:27:46] [Applause]
[2:27:50] because your nature is no longer a
[2:27:54] carnal nature it's no a divine nature
[2:27:58] and the church amen
[2:28:04] you may be seated everybody feeling fine
[2:28:09] I don't want to ask how many hugs we
[2:28:13] have this morning I don't want to ask
[2:28:14] how many sheep we have this morning but
[2:28:19] the real question is the theme of every
[2:28:23] apostle have you received the Holy Ghost
[2:28:26] since you believed because the Holy
[2:28:29] Ghost is what separates the Hogs from
[2:28:31] the Sheep the Holy Ghost is what
[2:28:33] separates the church from the bride Holy
[2:28:36] Ghost is who separates the remnant from
[2:28:39] the elect of God the fullness of the
[2:28:45] Spirit that's our promise and we have
[2:28:48] access to it now because of a prophet
[2:28:51] who restore the fullness of the word
[2:28:53] that the light of God could shine on the
[2:28:56] fullness of the world to bring forth the
[2:28:58] fullness of the Spirit not a show not a
[2:29:02] not a put on matter not a dress for
[2:29:06] church this morning and this is my best
[2:29:08] church outfit this is mature handshake
[2:29:11] this is the god bless you brother your
[2:29:15] characters in them until the middie
[2:29:19] mudhole
[2:29:20] [Applause]
[2:29:26] we could preach about mud holes all day
[2:29:30] long the problem is not the mud hole
[2:29:33] the problem is your nature I know the
[2:29:44] Prophet said after you receive the Holy
[2:29:45] Ghost then you make yourself a Christian
[2:29:48] [Applause]
[2:29:49] but if Adam said Isis not that the woman
[2:29:52] on the street will not be there but your
[2:29:54] response to them is different because
[2:29:58] temptation will always be there how you
[2:30:00] respond to the temptation is different
[2:30:02] between a hog and alone he says when a
[2:30:06] heart gets to the mud he's that's a
[2:30:08] dance he's that's the wall oh he he rock
[2:30:11] back because of core he misses inner the
[2:30:18] hoppers get trouble he hugs the conical
[2:30:20] competition you know but when every a
[2:30:21] gal tip is like a backslide as a
[2:30:24] different kinda is a different way when
[2:30:25] i hog city back slide back slightly like
[2:30:28] we said a lamb he said when it's falling
[2:30:30] in money it's not to cry it's not a
[2:30:33] bleat you got in each is different
[2:30:36] god help us to change our nature can you
[2:30:41] take some more
[2:30:43] I'm doing better than last week I'm on
[2:30:45] page 25 of 78 last week I believe a lot
[2:30:55] about phase four or five of 64 so
[2:30:58] percentage-wise we doing better from the
[2:31:02] same message why it had to be Shepard he
[2:31:04] said that's the reason that church
[2:31:05] members today indulge in the things of
[2:31:08] the world and friends that day is what
[2:31:11] messes up some of your worship and your
[2:31:14] consecration you playing games with the
[2:31:16] world and you have to know what your
[2:31:19] thorn in your flesh what your weakness
[2:31:22] is it's not the same for everybody there
[2:31:27] was a brother of my years ago he had a
[2:31:28] drinking problem and you know dong in
[2:31:31] Barataria ready for 9s component
[2:31:34] whenever each every mean rude yeah
[2:31:40] everybody get a couple but that's why
[2:31:44] I'd have a highway if you notice your
[2:31:48] problem you should be headed for the
[2:31:50] highway every time it's not on it not be
[2:31:53] a highway don't you have any main road
[2:31:55] because that's your issue you have to
[2:32:00] know your issue because you want to kill
[2:32:03] your issue until the fire burns
[2:32:06] everything out you have to guide your
[2:32:09] heart God your testimony scripture said
[2:32:15] make your calling and election sure
[2:32:21] because the holy ghost is attracted to
[2:32:24] the sanctified life sanctification is a
[2:32:27] choice in a message broken cisterns
[2:32:40] where the balance said you cannot make a
[2:32:43] man see the Word of God tell his nature
[2:32:46] has been changed when his neatest change
[2:32:51] from what he is the son of God and the
[2:32:53] Holy Spirit comes into him listen to the
[2:32:59] Prophet and speaking about being born
[2:33:00] again and I hope this helps on muddy
[2:33:02] because we have some real part-time
[2:33:04] Christians you know they're very good on
[2:33:08] Sundays maybe up til Monday maybe until
[2:33:10] 3 p.m. or until tomorrow low until the
[2:33:17] situation listen to the Prophet you
[2:33:19] can't be born without having a parent
[2:33:21] you ever heard this woman before so if
[2:33:24] you're born in the brotherhood of a
[2:33:26] church that's what you've got if you're
[2:33:30] born in a creed there you are but if you
[2:33:32] were born in God conceived in his word
[2:33:35] you got a new parent that's good ready
[2:33:39] to make his word known among which you
[2:33:42] speak it through you Oh a new parent
[2:33:45] that parent is good he's ready to take
[2:33:47] his word now that he's already spoke and
[2:33:51] lived in you and make it come to life
[2:33:53] see no you have your training now now
[2:33:57] you're ready you're ready to go into
[2:33:59] training No Child training that's the
[2:34:03] hard part
[2:34:04] when you think and I want you to get
[2:34:06] this you ought to do this and the word
[2:34:09] cuts you around and shows you something
[2:34:11] else and that's what we are honing in as
[2:34:15] a set the church in order for the word
[2:34:17] the cutters around until our behavior
[2:34:20] and our nature starts to look like the
[2:34:23] divine nature
[2:34:25] and you know I know I need this let me
[2:34:28] not talk about you I need this I don't
[2:34:31] want this thing I seen unity you know I
[2:34:33] need this because when I look in the
[2:34:35] mirror I want to see Jesus looking back
[2:34:37] at me when I look in the mirror of the
[2:34:39] world I want my nature to be like his
[2:34:41] nature
[2:34:42] I want my behavior to be like his
[2:34:44] behavior I want to forgive
[2:34:46] don't worry forgiving want to love the
[2:34:47] way he love I want to pray the way he
[2:34:49] prayed to be like Jesus that's my that's
[2:34:54] my desire that should be your desire
[2:34:57] that's the hard part when you think you
[2:35:00] ought to do this and the word cuts you
[2:35:03] around and shows you something else why
[2:35:05] they believe that over that will make
[2:35:07] any different what they believe here's
[2:35:09] what God said you must be about the
[2:35:12] Father's business
[2:35:13] now you're getting born again now you're
[2:35:16] getting right getting straightened out
[2:35:18] you have a new parent so in order if
[2:35:22] you're born again and got a new parent
[2:35:24] then you got a new nature you cannot
[2:35:26] tell me you are born again this is
[2:35:28] trouble yet people you ever meet
[2:35:30] somebody in on your job who said I
[2:35:32] people like I'm born again
[2:35:34] anybody ever met anybody like that in
[2:35:36] any job I'm a born again and when you
[2:35:40] listen to the music and he style any
[2:35:43] fashion any clothes anything you say
[2:35:50] well it's not the old nature is not dead
[2:35:52] but the pranam said in order if you're
[2:35:54] born again you've got a new pair and
[2:35:56] then you've got a new nature the old
[2:35:58] nature is dead and you've got a new
[2:36:00] nature you once was going one way no
[2:36:04] you're going another way you once was
[2:36:06] going this way now you're going this way
[2:36:09] your affections are set on things above
[2:36:13] a new affection you love the things of
[2:36:17] the world no more can you say that now
[2:36:21] you don't love the things of the world
[2:36:22] anymore or you're struggling to you
[2:36:29] you don't hear what man says how they
[2:36:31] laugh at you
[2:36:32] listen young people and see you all
[2:36:35] model or whatever it is like that you
[2:36:36] don't care because you're born of above
[2:36:40] and your affections are set on things
[2:36:42] above God's not ashamed of you and
[2:36:45] you're not esteemed of him is that your
[2:36:49] test of money so why is it people want
[2:36:54] to go to work and dress one way and come
[2:36:56] to church in just another way and why is
[2:36:58] it you want to sing in church and in the
[2:37:04] middle of the week you listen to music
[2:37:06] that's destroying your soul that Lucifer
[2:37:09] himself orchestrated you need to come
[2:37:14] back to the cross come back to Calvary
[2:37:18] come back to the upper room and have a
[2:37:20] Pentecost experience the change that all
[2:37:24] nature and don't nature that will love
[2:37:27] God and hate the things of the world I
[2:37:29] will love the word and eat the sin and
[2:37:31] come to church shame and I'm not gonna
[2:37:36] be too much longer
[2:37:37] no what kind of need to have you got
[2:37:39] them brother branham his nature if I had
[2:37:42] my father's nature then I do the things
[2:37:44] my father did but know that I'm born
[2:37:48] again it depends on who my father was
[2:37:53] if you're just born in the church you
[2:37:55] got a church father and you can call him
[2:37:58] father if you want to that's the profit
[2:38:00] I'm reading the courts you call them
[2:38:02] anything you want to because he's your
[2:38:04] father but if your father is God and
[2:38:07] you're born into the family of God you
[2:38:09] seek those things that put into God you
[2:38:12] can't wait for prayer meeting you cannot
[2:38:14] wait to read a spoken word book you
[2:38:16] can't wait to read the scripture because
[2:38:18] it's your life it's your source then you
[2:38:22] are God's child your nature is God's
[2:38:25] nature then when you hear some say oh
[2:38:29] our church believes that the day of
[2:38:31] miracles is passed how could you believe
[2:38:32] that there's of miracles has passed when
[2:38:35] the very nature of God is in you when he
[2:38:38] is all to get a miracle
[2:38:41] his nature is miracle his habits miracle
[2:38:45] I'm reading the Prophet his whole being
[2:38:46] is miracle how can you be anything else
[2:38:49] but miracle your new birth is miracle
[2:38:52] your new life is miracle even your
[2:38:55] nature's a miracle that's a prophet how
[2:38:59] can you look back and see them things
[2:39:00] are there this is right see you're a new
[2:39:02] creature a new creation I wanna nail
[2:39:07] this down friend because this is your
[2:39:08] promise and by these exceeding great and
[2:39:12] precious promises we could be partakers
[2:39:15] of his divine nature promise of the
[2:39:19] unity of one God in the one Church he
[2:39:22] said but the working of the holy spirit
[2:39:24] the kingdom of God in you God sets on
[2:39:27] the throne of your heart in his control
[2:39:30] room controlling your emotions and
[2:39:34] controlling your powers control your
[2:39:37] conceptions and making you one with him
[2:39:40] in fellowship and in love and God fills
[2:39:43] you with love he fills you with power he
[2:39:45] fills you with the spirit he fills you
[2:39:47] with his own divine nature and he
[2:39:50] changes your carnal nature into his
[2:39:53] nature then in this you become a new
[2:39:56] creation in Christ in brother Branham
[2:40:01] goes on then the love you go out
[2:40:03] seemingly the birds sing different or
[2:40:05] how different it is when Christ comes
[2:40:07] how you can look back and think how did
[2:40:10] I ever stay away from it how did I ever
[2:40:13] reject it everything is different
[2:40:15] you have no enemies they all look sweet
[2:40:19] you can forgive everything that's ever
[2:40:22] been done the bitterest of enemy you can
[2:40:26] pray for him in the street put your arm
[2:40:28] around him and lift him up no matter
[2:40:31] what creed what denomination he belongs
[2:40:34] to he's a creature who Christ died for
[2:40:37] that's what God wants you filled with
[2:40:39] that's the filling that's the kingdom
[2:40:42] that's what we're one in
[2:40:45] can the church seaman is this a desire
[2:40:49] you love the word this morning and by
[2:40:55] random goes on we are one then not to
[2:40:57] further a denomination not to further a
[2:41:00] cult or some Creed we are one to further
[2:41:03] the kingdom of God then we take his
[2:41:06] blueprint and every time the Blessed
[2:41:09] Bible says anything the Holy Spirit in
[2:41:12] you cries out it's all it's my wood it's
[2:41:15] my word adoption is my word perfection
[2:41:19] is my word seven live voices is my word
[2:41:23] charity coming down it's my word the
[2:41:26] dynamics or the mechanics is my word
[2:41:28] seven living voices it's my word that's
[2:41:31] the Thunder that shakes the devil that's
[2:41:34] my word it's prophetic it's a promise
[2:41:37] but that gives me access to his divine
[2:41:40] nature he don't say I'm still reading
[2:41:47] the same quote he don't see the dr.
[2:41:49] Jones say what about this or the doctor
[2:41:51] so-and-so makes no difference what
[2:41:53] doctor said so jesus said it's the truth
[2:41:57] and heavens and earth will pass away but
[2:42:00] my words shall never pass away that's
[2:42:03] when we are one now listen to the
[2:42:07] Prophet in the message faith in the Son
[2:42:12] of God could he take someone as I've
[2:42:15] said no man seeks after God God seeks
[2:42:18] after man Dudek on yourself bless this
[2:42:21] morning
[2:42:24] that he called you
[2:42:28] you know we sing that song I love him
[2:42:31] because he first loved me you know the
[2:42:36] Bible said there's no greater love and
[2:42:38] when a man could lay his life down and I
[2:42:42] realized that when we talk about God
[2:42:44] loving us and we loving him there really
[2:42:46] is no comparison because I'm not sure
[2:42:49] how many first raisin lay down our life
[2:42:50] for anybody to say we really love God
[2:42:58] our love is really limited any context
[2:43:01] can even be compared with God's love for
[2:43:03] us because if no greater love greater
[2:43:06] love is and he can lay a life down we
[2:43:09] are too selfish lay life tongfu but his
[2:43:17] love was so great he could lay his life
[2:43:20] down in our place when we deserve to be
[2:43:25] judged because the wages of sin is still
[2:43:28] death is not like time he's under GL sin
[2:43:32] and his debt
[2:43:33] and when we should have died he took our
[2:43:36] place because he loved us so much can we
[2:43:41] not love him back can we not serve Him
[2:43:44] and dedicate our lives to him man and
[2:43:47] his nature is a rebellion against God
[2:43:49] but God loves man since the fall in the
[2:43:53] Garden of Eden God has still been
[2:43:54] calling for his child he calls to him
[2:43:58] through the Thunder through the
[2:43:59] Lightning through the setting of the Sun
[2:44:01] through the preaching of the gospel
[2:44:03] through signs and wonders through
[2:44:06] prophets through miracles through
[2:44:08] visions God speaking to his people God
[2:44:13] trying to get your attention
[2:44:15] wake up look up your Redemption draweth
[2:44:19] nigh judgment over it and as the closing
[2:44:25] seconds of time run out whether the
[2:44:28] Branum said there come a time where the
[2:44:30] young people coming to the altar but the
[2:44:32] random said looking to be saved with
[2:44:36] it'll be too late because they have done
[2:44:39] cross the line and mercy is over
[2:44:44] grace is over because God start standing
[2:44:49] knocking on the door of your heart and
[2:44:51] you never opened up to him you keep the
[2:44:54] church but never open up to him came to
[2:44:56] church and see him hunt came the church
[2:44:58] same spirit keep the church never got
[2:45:00] his spirit came to church seemed nature
[2:45:03] came to church all nature came to church
[2:45:05] Conti correction came to church can't
[2:45:08] discipline yourself to separate from the
[2:45:10] world brother Branham said you have to
[2:45:13] separate yourself and then he said this
[2:45:18] if love doesn't get you desperate then
[2:45:21] conditions will and that's why but the
[2:45:25] band said compassion is not feeling
[2:45:26] sorry for people it's doing the will of
[2:45:28] God there's something that God allows to
[2:45:31] come your way to discipline you we can
[2:45:34] feel sorry compassion is knowing that
[2:45:36] it's God's will then you go to that
[2:45:38] trial that he can get your attention
[2:45:41] that you could serve Him because this
[2:45:44] body is temporary but your soul has an
[2:45:47] eternal destination so when this fails
[2:45:51] and this fades away God is interested in
[2:45:53] your eternal destination of your soul
[2:45:57] can the church say man I'm not gonna be
[2:46:00] too much longer with you for the Branham
[2:46:06] said I find this that the greatest power
[2:46:08] in the world is not your atomic bomb but
[2:46:12] a believer in contact with his mica
[2:46:15] [Music]
[2:46:17] I'll say that one more time the greatest
[2:46:19] power in the world is not the atomic
[2:46:21] bomb but a believer in contact with his
[2:46:24] maker it changes the whole attitude
[2:46:27] changes his mental it changes his habit
[2:46:31] it changes his body it changes his
[2:46:34] nature have you ever been in contact
[2:46:37] with your maker
[2:46:42] but the Branum said Moses was 40 years
[2:46:45] in Egypt trained in the ways of Egypt it
[2:46:48] took 40 years for Egypt to leave him as
[2:46:50] he spent the tamanna wilderness but that
[2:46:54] was not enough for Moses to deliver he
[2:46:56] had to come into contact with the pillar
[2:46:58] of fire he had to come into contact with
[2:47:02] God not as a group but as an individual
[2:47:05] have you had a personal experience with
[2:47:10] God have you had a personal encounter
[2:47:18] with God have you hit your knees and say
[2:47:25] Lord I want to meet you
[2:47:26] I want to hear your voice I want you to
[2:47:30] speak to my heart I want you to perform
[2:47:32] surgery take away my heart Lord I want a
[2:47:36] new heart Lord I want a new spirit Lord
[2:47:39] I want your spirit because he's calling
[2:47:43] you couldn't come on your own but
[2:47:45] because he called you you have a choice
[2:47:47] to respond he said my sheep hear my
[2:47:53] voice my sheep didn't know my voice
[2:47:56] are you hearing a call this morning to
[2:47:58] call for repentance the call to make
[2:48:01] things right the call to forgive the
[2:48:04] call for transformation the call for the
[2:48:07] Holy Ghost the call for baptism the call
[2:48:11] to halt the new horns of the altar and
[2:48:13] sigh and cry for the abomination in the
[2:48:16] city
[2:48:19] it's okay the come to church and shout
[2:48:21] and jump but is your soul change is your
[2:48:27] nature change how long will you come to
[2:48:31] church and go back home with your whole
[2:48:32] nature when will you see a Lord today's
[2:48:36] my day I can't go back this way not
[2:48:40] today not today Lord I've come too far
[2:48:44] but today I want a personal experience
[2:48:47] not with the preaching up with the
[2:48:50] church not with the message but a
[2:48:51] personal experience with God himself
[2:48:55] [Applause]
[2:48:58] Nicodemus was looking for something are
[2:49:02] you looking for something when Nicodemus
[2:49:04] found Jesus is he hold how can a man get
[2:49:07] this eternal life thing he said you must
[2:49:11] be born again he says shall I go back in
[2:49:13] my mother's womb again he had a desire
[2:49:18] what is your desire is your need great
[2:49:22] enough then you can lock everything else
[2:49:24] orphans in Lord this is my desire to
[2:49:27] worship you
[2:49:29] [Applause]
[2:49:32] [Music]
[2:49:34] yeah I noticed another service that
[2:49:36] everybody everybody jumps to and shouts
[2:49:38] to but it makes no sense comment to
[2:49:42] church jumping and shouting and knowing
[2:49:44] mysteries and no and there's no change
[2:49:47] your nature is the same and it's no good
[2:49:51] you come in and nobody's telling you
[2:49:55] your nature is not gonna make it because
[2:49:57] the Prophet taught us only perfect love
[2:50:00] will enter in only his nature will enter
[2:50:05] in we have to be partakers of his nature
[2:50:08] to enter him he must be with a look and
[2:50:11] see yes I see faith I see virtue
[2:50:13] I see knowledge I see temperance I see
[2:50:15] patients I see calling this I see
[2:50:16] brotherly kindness I see charity yes it
[2:50:19] looks like me yes this is one this is
[2:50:20] one there is my spirit flowing freely
[2:50:23] there's my daughter yes my son I could
[2:50:26] send him somewhere I could send him
[2:50:28] somewhere because he has surrendered his
[2:50:30] all he has given up the world he is
[2:50:32] giving up his desires he'll given up his
[2:50:35] ambitions he prays he cries out he reads
[2:50:38] the word he takes time any fast he takes
[2:50:41] time any praise party cos of his divine
[2:50:49] nature can you take some more the
[2:50:58] position of a believer in Christ I don't
[2:51:00] know me too much longer but first
[2:51:02] Corinthians 12 says by one spirit we all
[2:51:04] baptized into one body which is the body
[2:51:06] of Christ the body of believers see it
[2:51:09] by what not by one shake of hands not by
[2:51:12] one mode of baptism not by one feeling
[2:51:14] but by one spirit Great Spirit Holy
[2:51:17] Spirit by one spirit we're all baptized
[2:51:20] into one body which is the body of the
[2:51:22] Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah look at it
[2:51:26] where the random is describing bruised
[2:51:28] wounded tour opened up his side of the
[2:51:31] room and spear talking about Jesus in
[2:51:34] order that by the Holy Spirit we could
[2:51:37] be baptized into his body
[2:51:40] because of his divine nature look of the
[2:51:42] Prophet places in the context you get it
[2:51:44] then you become a partaker after coming
[2:51:48] into his body a partaker of his divine
[2:51:50] nature Christ's nature in you how can
[2:51:54] you cheat steal lie blacks lie proselyte
[2:51:58] everything else with the divine nature
[2:52:00] of Christ in you it's impossible for the
[2:52:04] balance I'll let that soak just a few
[2:52:06] minutes cuz it's right well if you be a
[2:52:10] partaker in Christ then you become a new
[2:52:13] creature
[2:52:13] all things have passed away and all
[2:52:16] things become new all of our warnings
[2:52:19] and fussing and stewing and arguing's
[2:52:21] and Tempest and all these things pass
[2:52:24] away Oh hallelujah glory hallelujah can
[2:52:36] the church say man when you look at this
[2:52:40] word is that how you look but the man
[2:52:42] said what is the fruit of the Spirit we
[2:52:45] have planted it on church membership
[2:52:47] upon shouting upon demonstration of our
[2:52:50] works but the fruit of the Spirit is
[2:52:52] full of love who then is when you love
[2:52:55] those who are unlovable
[2:52:57] that's the Spirit of Christ love joy
[2:53:00] peace long-suffering goodness meekness
[2:53:02] gentleness patience dear the fruit of
[2:53:05] the Spirit no matter what should she
[2:53:08] belong to what you have done
[2:53:12] glory glory hallelujah oh my I'm almost
[2:53:20] finished musician you get ready the
[2:53:23] world is falling apart but when he was
[2:53:25] crucified rose again and ascended to God
[2:53:27] on the day of Pentecost he came back in
[2:53:30] the form of this pillar of fire and
[2:53:33] separated himself no wonder we could
[2:53:36] party because he separated himself
[2:53:38] tongues of fire set upon each of them
[2:53:42] don't you want your own tongue of fire
[2:53:44] your own experience with God
[2:53:48] God dividing himself amongst his church
[2:53:52] dividing his nature among the church
[2:53:55] because that was his wife and a husband
[2:53:58] and wife is one together and God and the
[2:54:00] church is one together God in you that
[2:54:03] was God above us God with us God in us
[2:54:06] seem God all the time just three
[2:54:09] manifestations attributes or offices or
[2:54:12] whatever you want to call it like a
[2:54:14] Father Son and Holy Spirit is the same
[2:54:16] God all the time but the battle
[2:54:24] continues
[2:54:25] I want to lay it on thick church because
[2:54:28] this is your promise these are the
[2:54:30] exceeding promise exceeding great and
[2:54:33] precious that Christ Himself
[2:54:35] the tabernacle himself in 16 elements in
[2:54:40] you and you're a different person
[2:54:43] [Music]
[2:54:46] and now that I was caught above us could
[2:54:49] not be touched even a mountain that
[2:54:52] would be touch away he was there must be
[2:54:55] trust true in a darkest sin had not had
[2:54:57] an offering yet but when God came and
[2:55:00] was manifested among us this is the
[2:55:03] problem is reading a proper course now
[2:55:04] we handled him with our hands he said we
[2:55:07] said God first Timothy 3:16 without
[2:55:10] controversy great is the mystery of
[2:55:12] godliness the core was manifested in the
[2:55:15] flesh seen of angels and believed on in
[2:55:17] the world received up into glory see
[2:55:19] that was God with us God over us God
[2:55:23] with us now God in us all that God was
[2:55:28] he ported to Christ all that Christ was
[2:55:30] he ported to the church at that day
[2:55:32] you'll know that I am in the father the
[2:55:34] father in me I in you and you and me so
[2:55:37] it's been called all along you see his
[2:55:39] same works the churches are dealing to
[2:55:42] carry on his work with the same spirit
[2:55:45] you cannot carry on you couldn't carry
[2:55:48] on the same work without the same spirit
[2:55:50] that's right the same spirit carries on
[2:55:53] the work I'm almost done and a message
[2:55:55] the guide a guide that's the reason the
[2:55:58] coming of the seals and a finishing of
[2:56:00] the
[2:56:00] seven seal the mystery of God should be
[2:56:02] finished to know who God is what he is
[2:56:06] how he lives his nature his being you're
[2:56:09] supposed to be where all the way a beer
[2:56:11] by that time she bring us into the full
[2:56:14] stature of sons and daughters of God a
[2:56:17] church that's washed in the blood of
[2:56:19] Christ
[2:56:20] that's brought without money it's paid
[2:56:22] for by the blood of Jesus Christ God is
[2:56:26] the one who gave the promise and he's
[2:56:28] more than able to bring the promise to
[2:56:30] pass he was the one who promised the
[2:56:32] Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost
[2:56:35] nothing Peter could have done was what a
[2:56:37] change that promised from coming to pass
[2:56:39] Sarah laughed when God told Abraham
[2:56:43] you're gonna have a child it was he made
[2:56:46] the promise and he's big enough to keep
[2:56:50] a promise big enough to keep his word
[2:56:55] unconditional covenant sovereign
[2:56:57] covenant he signed both sides of the
[2:57:01] agreement there was none greater than
[2:57:04] himself so he swore by himself and
[2:57:08] prophesied there will be a bride that
[2:57:10] will come to perfection debía people in
[2:57:13] the land who under their messenger would
[2:57:16] be the final voice up to the final age
[2:57:19] and he doesn't need permission to say it
[2:57:21] he doesn't--he permission to call you he
[2:57:24] doesn't need permission to choose you
[2:57:25] nor does he permission to fill you
[2:57:31] somebody may be seated he wanted this
[2:57:35] man called Saul who we now called Paul
[2:57:39] Saul was riding on his own Road and God
[2:57:43] interrupted him on the road the way he
[2:57:46] was going because God was ready for him
[2:57:49] it wasn't Saul saying lord I want you
[2:57:51] but there was a promise over Saul's head
[2:57:55] that he didn't even know about he didn't
[2:57:58] know he was gonna be caught or write the
[2:58:00] book of Ephesians he didn't know he's
[2:58:02] gonna call the D right to the Romans
[2:58:04] tell Philippians and tribulations up he
[2:58:07] was living his life but the pillar of
[2:58:09] fire drop town and arrested him on his
[2:58:13] journey to Damascus and when he fell to
[2:58:16] his feet he knew who stopped him he knew
[2:58:22] who called him in knew who threw him
[2:58:26] town and that same God and not another

[3:00:34] as spirit he's waiting to be in somebody
[3:00:38] maybe meets a tail or maybe use a
[3:00:41] different but it's the same God who

[3:01:16] of man it was the son of man merely a
[3:01:19] son of man but the Branham had no power
[3:01:21] of his owner Peter had no power of his
[3:01:25] owner Paul had no power of his own but
[3:01:28] they were all partakers of his divine
[3:01:31] nature
[3:01:38] hallelujah hallelujah give Him worship

[3:02:24] [Applause]
[3:02:26] whether you worship whether you laugh
[3:02:29] whether you doubt it's still gonna
[3:02:31] happen God spoke to Abraham and say
[3:02:34] Abraham you're gonna have a chance
[3:02:36] Cyril laughed because she did not
[3:02:38] believe when she looked at her condition
[3:02:40] that she was eligible she didn't believe
[3:02:43] that she was a candidate she did not
[3:02:45] believe she was an option she did not
[3:02:48] believe that she was qualified she
[3:02:50] didn't believe that quarter use her she
[3:02:53] believed her time was over she believed
[3:02:55] her deal was done
[3:02:56] she believed she couldn't make it so she
[3:02:58] laughs within herself even after the
[3:03:00] prophesy she got her servant girl Higa
[3:03:03] to go with Abraham because she didn't
[3:03:05] believe but when God speaks up he in his
[3:03:08] nature he can't even take it back up
[3:03:11] when God speaks he can't even change his
[3:03:15] mind
[3:03:20] he said Abraham you're gonna have a
[3:03:22] child by Sarah she rocket laughs how
[3:03:25] much you want to see Eric adult all she
[3:03:27] want to but Sarah is living and did you
[3:03:30] realize with nah I'm feeling better
[3:03:31] today
[3:03:32] then I felt yesterday I feel younger
[3:03:34] this month then I felt last month I feel
[3:03:37] younger this year it was 25 years god
[3:03:40] loves to turn the odds against you
[3:03:43] because if 25 years ago you couldn't
[3:03:46] have the child no it should be even more
[3:03:50] impossible because every year that pass
[3:03:53] makes it harder makes it more difficult
[3:03:55] but God loves when the other against you
[3:03:59] because when the other against you then
[3:04:01] he gets the glory then he gets the honor
[3:04:04] then he gets the worship because the
[3:04:07] battle is not yours
[3:04:08] the battle is the Lord's he says no
[3:04:11] weapon formed against you could prosper
[3:04:14] that's an exceeding great and precious
[3:04:16] promise

[3:04:29] hallelujah there's a lot more but I
[3:04:31] gotta finish there's a lot more because
[3:04:34] yes joy unspeakable and full of glory
[3:04:36] Wendy will try to speak about did you
[3:04:38] see my cup runs over when I try to get
[3:04:40] in my cup it's more than my cup could
[3:04:42] handle because when God blesses it's
[3:04:45] more it's more than you can even handle
[3:04:47] in your house it's enough for your
[3:04:49] children it's enough for your
[3:04:50] neighborhood when you're blessed the
[3:04:52] Lord God added blessing and when he
[3:04:54] blessed there's no sorrow with it come
[3:04:56] on now that's your promise hallelujah
[3:04:59] that's a promise over your life oh he
[3:05:03] promised that weep in me and your for a
[3:05:05] night but joy comes in the morning
[3:05:08] what you're talking about what situation
[3:05:11] what sadness what depression what
[3:05:13] problem what trouble
[3:05:15] [Music]
[3:05:19] Oh hallelujah I'm finished but Anthony
[3:05:26] if you get ready but friends we are on
[3:05:28] our way out of here we have a promise of
[3:05:30] a rapture but before the rapture we also
[3:05:33] have a problem I have a promise to give
[3:05:35] the devil the final knockout punch the
[3:05:39] devil was there in the Ephesus age he
[3:05:42] was there in this money and age he was
[3:05:44] there in the present age he was there an
[3:05:46] entire town church age in the sadducee
[3:05:49] an age he was there in Philadelphia he
[3:05:51] was there and in this Laodicean age as
[3:05:53] we switch to connect with the headstone
[3:05:56] God has been waiting for our people so
[3:06:00] else army to rise up that's an exceeding
[3:06:03] great and precious promise and we have
[3:06:08] had the examples Paul said that where is
[3:06:11] your sing grave where is your victory
[3:06:13] the Prophet was an example of a partaker
[3:06:17] of his divine nature spoken word
[3:06:19] salvation
[3:06:20] spoken word healing power over the
[3:06:23] elements and that was just a foreshadow
[3:06:25] of what was to come because a group of
[3:06:28] people were being prepared to be
[3:06:31] collectively define what takers of His
[3:06:34] divine nature
[3:06:36] oh my my almost ready we almost ready
[3:06:43] remember that Randall is here
[3:06:45] he turned the devil's kingdom upside
[3:06:47] down the devil even finish adjusted back
[3:06:52] yet
[3:06:53] and we are get started yet
[3:06:57] we haven't gotten started yet but the
[3:07:00] problem shed the spirit the profit and
[3:07:03] the pride will say the same thing and
[3:07:05] what they have said will always will
[3:07:08] already have been said in the word
[3:07:10] listen the spirit has a voice the book
[3:07:18] of Revelation
[3:07:18] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[3:07:21] the Spirit say it for the spirit has a
[3:07:24] voice the prophet has a voice in the
[3:07:27] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[3:07:29] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[3:07:32] of God shall be finished as he had
[3:07:34] declared his civils a prophet so the
[3:07:36] spirit has a voice and the Spirit has
[3:07:38] not stopped speaking but the Spirit use
[3:07:40] our prophet to bring a message in seed
[3:07:43] form to identify by promise what was the
[3:07:47] divine nature of God so pizza in case
[3:07:49] you missed it
[3:07:50] begin to express haven't done all this
[3:07:53] after your faith virtue and to virtue
[3:07:55] knowledge so you who are spiritual Peter
[3:07:58] started to describe the very divine
[3:08:01] nature of God and placed it as the
[3:08:04] virtues and the profit came behind
[3:08:08] and said this being when he is complete
[3:08:11] is the being that will go to the rapture
[3:08:14] this being when complete will represent
[3:08:18] partakers of the divine nature of God I
[3:08:25] listen with the man who said you may be
[3:08:28] seated for a minute if you want or you
[3:08:29] can see it standing doesn't matter
[3:08:31] but the Branham said on the day of
[3:08:33] Pentecost cloth divided himself in the
[3:08:37] end God is collecting himself he is
[3:08:39] bringing all the pieces together all the
[3:08:42] pieces all the sleepin seats the dead in
[3:08:45] Christ shall rise he's pulling
[3:08:47] throughout all the ages to himself a
[3:08:49] headstone picking up everything how are
[3:08:54] you gonna miss it when this is in you
[3:08:56] when the divine nature is in you he has
[3:09:02] to call you he has to call you he has to
[3:09:06] call you he has to call you because you
[3:09:08] are part of him
[3:09:09] she is him when he sees you he say flesh
[3:09:12] of my flesh bone of my bone there's my
[3:09:15] spirit fluent freely how could he leave
[3:09:18] his wife how could he leave his bride we
[3:09:21] are the bride of Jesus Christ that's who
[3:09:24] we are that's our promise that's our
[3:09:26] inheritance middle or dress you bless
[3:09:29] you give the Lord a soda break
[3:09:32] [Applause]
[3:09:41] [Music]
[3:09:49] particles of His divine nature partakers
[3:09:53] of his divine nature we must keep the
[3:09:56] world we've escaped the corruption or
[3:09:59] give him a shout message today Oh
