was my lot to share some of you tonight uh i but isaac was ready and it so happened that they had an unusual blackout so uh it's not normal but god knows best so at this time we just want to borrow us with a prayer heavenly father we thank you for your presence and we thank you for this time that you could guide us together and lord i pray to speak to your hearts draw us nearer to you by your word and by your truth and father may the people get strength tonight be encouraged tonight in this special time that you're taking us through granted lord in jesus might ask it email an email if your bibles i'd like you to turn to second timothy chapter four reading from verse seven to eight it's very interesting because he called me around 20 minutes to eat to tell me that there's a black hole there so he can't uh connect tonight so that is why it is what it is tonight but god is good and we are still looking to see how god will bless us by his spirit tonight amen so second timothy chapter 4 verse 7 8 says i afford a good fight and this is paul when he has talked about his departure i have finished my course i have kept defeat henceforth there is leader for me a clung of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day not to me only but unto all them also that love is appearing may god bless his word and tonight i want to share something to you about keeping the feet about keeping the faith and i don't know if everybody is nearby you but paul in second timothy in um in acts 20 27 27-30 he says for i have not shown to declare unto you all the counsel of god take heed therefore unto yourselves and all the flock over which the holy ghost had made you overseers to feed the church of god which he had purchased with his own blood for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own self shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them so we see here that paul who was the angel to the church of ephesus who was the pastor the apostle the prophet that age he was warning them of what was to happen after he left because we're dealing with uh the humanistic realm and we're dealing with uh the spiritual name and in that realm and like you talk about like say supernatural people like to talk about supernatural but remember supernatural is two sides i was sharing some ministers overseas last night that when people want a shortcut the enemy could give them supernatural experiences that is satanic that is of the enticing spirits that is impersonation of christianity so you don't want the counterfeit you don't want something that is just supernatural you want something that is off of the word and that is why we have the word here because faith come by hearing and hearing the word and as long as you stay faithful to the word god going to bless you god going to keep you god going to make a way for you if you stay with his word now remember when the prophecy was hanging over israel the children of israel in egypt they only know god by prophecy that god said this a deliverer will come generation after generation is given prophecy of this deliverer to come they don't know when they don't know what time all they know he is coming at the god of abraham he said he's going to search in a strange land and he will send a messenger this is the word they were holding on to this was their comfort and in times of distress in time of pressure like what we're going to know in in all our different ways there is always a word to bring comfort a word from the lord god always have a way of bringing a consolation that he's deal with you amidst your trials i missed your situation and this is where you have to hold fast to the word like all the prophet says when you can't hear from god devil must be able to move you you could stay whole steadfast so it is very powerful how paul said i have fought a good fight i have finished my course he kept defeat that is a person who have a great sense of fulfillment sense of destiny sense of accomplishment but two parts i want to get here to you is fought a good fight and there are some people give up easily they do they want things to work out uh you know smoothly there must be no fight to be god it have to work out this way that way that is not so that is not true sometimes you really have to fight and most times you have to fight because fight is what gives and show the kind of faith inside of you know last week when isaac spoke about gideon and he showed quite clearly how gideon moved from a shy and bashful person to the mighty man of valor and it was interesting to note that the beginning of his encounter by hitting the lamp and saying he saw the lord i'm gideon that wasn't him doing anything that was just following god instructions and got on in his word and given victory over the enemy at the end in the year when gideon began to possess and take and conquer and so on you see the mighty man of allah coming into his own well where you are now it may not be where god ordained you to be in terms of your spirit in terms of what you have to possess and to what you have to take but god have processes and experiences to take you there so you don't have to be worried and say i am shy i can't make it or oh i can't do this i can't do that no what your heart should be i want to follow god's way because he's the same yesterday and forever and i know we live in a modern time it doesn't look sometimes as if god is operational in our own environment but he is he is in the affairs of men and i want to encourage you tonight to fight this good fight and this fight now is a fight of feat not fighting with your neighbor or your brother is a fight of faith there's faith to live because the christian armor is not flesh and blood the christian armor is an hour of faith isn't that right so paul warned them of wolves enter in lies outside but he warned them of words on the inside speaking perverse things and the objective is to draw disciples after themselves so he warned us that things will come to affect this feat jude and the scripture we're familiar with jude tree he said beloved when i give all divisions i write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints for there are certain men cryptin unawares who of all ordained to this condemnation on godly men turning the grace of god into lazifacious and denying the only lord jesus christ i will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them i believe not and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation yet reserve an everlasting change on the darkness and the judgment of the great deed now you notice what jude said here in terms of putting them in remembrance the same god that saved them judged them and as you may know most of you i keep saying over and over this this message don't know the judgments of god they have never encountered god's judgment it's almost as if god leave everything to run let everything's unfold at time unfold and i don't know when it's going to begin but some point in time it will begin and judgment begins in the house of god and sometime we were reading for about ezekiel 9 and notice what god said after the angel came back and said it is done he said begin at my sanctuary. so before drama starts on the outside it have to have drama on the inside we claim to believe god receive his word receive his message make sure there is a sincere heart and an honest heart and a an a and a heart to watch squad because make sure that that all the references of the examples in times past that we don't fall trap to them because the same people that rejoice and shout when the heart wants to go through their wilderness and their dry times and their hard times these same people fell let me say it again the same people that got brought out of bondage deliver me deliver me deliver me you want deliverance okay go send a message question a prophet he said a word he pulls you out now and pulling you out it takes you to a journey the journey is what defines what is in people right now the world is going through a journey there's not a bright trial this is a trial hitting the entire world at judgment on the entire world right now and the fate that we claim to have or claim to believe is what we are challenged with to go to this particular period through the wilderness what they do they murmured they complain they carry on god tolerated all of that you know until it came to kamish baniya until it came to the point where you're almost there it's just over the hill you're almost there yes you're getting hit here you're getting stressed here you're getting fed up and frustrated and all kind of things attack him but you still have a word of promise god said certain things that he has to keep and that is what you're resting on are you fighting for that are you present for that you know i heard preachers preaching and they're preaching this happened already and that passed already and like everything happened already revival how am i ready this happened already that happened already and they waited for the comment of the lord that is a sad place to be in very very sad because if charity is our rest listen carefully if charity is our rest then we are reached there yet we have more to press i want to say it again if charity is duress then the labor has to be between fate and brotherly kindness you're fighting for every inch add to your faith virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and verdict and so on you're adding you're pressing you're fighting each one is a battle each one is the fight he said it this way looter fought wesley your pentecostal fort what about you and i are we gonna just have a beautiful message with books on tapes and sit down waiting for the comment of the lord as if nothing happened is it working so brethren it's a war it's already started and right now we're going through like sample material sample experiences of what it would be like when the press come down let me say that again we're going to sample experiences of what it would be like when the press com come down the prophet said they will close down the churches and the churches will be used to store whatever extra houses they will do it when i read these things in the early years it was almost like an impossibility all 1975 76 and so on praise the lord but praise god oh blessed being the lord but i'm telling you friends um that that that god is good and he and his most enjoyed forever praise the name of the lord let me see could you hold one second please blessed be the name of the lord thank you lord jesus this here okay okay praise the lord but isaac you on blessed be the name of the lord all right god is good if you want to come and let me know praise the lord okay so let me read this from first corinthians chapter 13 verse 5 second corinthians chapter 13 verse 5 examine yourselves whether you be in the fate prove your own selves know you not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you except you be reprobate except you be reprobates this in the amplified reads this way examine and test and evaluate your own cells to see whether you are holding to your feet and showing the proper fruits of it test and prove yourself do you not yourselves realize and no thoroughly by an ever increasing experience that jesus christ is in you unless you are counterfeits disapproved on trial and rejected jesus is a powerful scripture to examine and test to seize your feet not see if you believe by the brown not not that not see if they believe the message not that see if you'll be in the fate because this fate we're talking about i'm calling about defeat this defeat jesus himself introduced it this thing called defeat and gaussian a prophet to tone our hearts back to same this fate of the fathers not uh we have the seals and we have the thunders and we have the mysteries and this is our thing now no this what we have now is to get us to a place that he will be to his hand because that what they had was original this what they had was to take them to the rapture but the raptor was not yet so that seed that was formed on pentecost had to fall down into the ground so now god has to do a work to bring back that original seed by four stages by luther wesley pentecost and by the prophet bringing the full word and when the prophet body full word it was back now to the original seed sonoma besoa now after son of man in the old testament in the bible came son of god which was spirit activated in peter and paul and all disciples so after son of man come again this time we have to see a manifestation of sons of god which is the holy spirit christ himself veiled in the sons of god this is what we are contending for we're not contending to be a nice message church we are contending for the faith that was once delivered and there is going to be a unity of that faith are you with me there is going to be not a unity of doctrine or unity of teachings it going to be a unity of the fate because the doctrines and teachings the equal signs supposedly christ whatever we preach whatever we teach if it cannot reproduce the original grain which is jesus christ it is some other gospel because all what is to be reproduced has to produce christ himself amen who praise the lord so i trust this help you tonight and you realize that this god that we serve is alive the message but isaac shared with us concerning jehu and the study about jehu and about god's judgment it was a very important message very interesting a bible study and it goes to show that when god says something he's done playing he's at playing games he means what he says and he says what he means and i'm hoping that tonight and through all the bible studies and what we are sharing it brings a fear of god and that is the beginning of wisdom and give an understanding of how much he keeps his word and how much he's in your fears of men you know it's this very stirring story about neighborhood and about i mean i said it before about about how you know he had this feel and ahab wanted his feel and he blank him and said no this is my family property and a man got upset and you know what happened he died and god said you see that no that's not going unpunished that's not going unpunished what is a strong name though is when you have went and sucked on ashes go to your sea or humble himself i go i gotta shift the judgment to a next level so god responds to repentance god responses i'm sorry forgive me i i i didn't mean to act that way i shouldn't have acted that way god responds to that it's his law it's his order it's not a matter we could just do our own thing the people were happy to come out they're happy to come from under pharaoh but they were judged and killed and separated from god it's not as if it's it's it's like we could continue doing our own thing and acting our own way so i'll say this way to you not because you are blessed in what you're doing god is agreeing with what you're doing oh praise the lord yeah so so so what so if you are blessed if you are blessed um and you feel a blessing and you're doing foolishness and you're breaking your word but you're still best be careful let's go as a warning tonight because samson when he didn't tell his secret he was lying he was making fun and everything else but the anointing was still there the power was still there you see so don't take your blessing as a tick to do whatever you want and continue being blessed there came a time when samson looked for power and he was totally upset it was not here because he broke the covenant god is a covenant keeping god so let's continue who praise the god from romans chapter four one four we want to read a scripture from the if you have a bible they content in romans chapter four and let's read it here romans chapter four we read from verse one what shall we then say that abraham or father speculated the flesh had found and if abraham was justified by works yahweh of the glory but not before god but what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is a reward not reckon of grace but of death but to him that look at not but believe it on him that justified him god be his fate is counted for righteousness so imagine your faith in god could be conquered for righteousness at this time i think i want to invite but isaac is on the phone and uh i believe he could share something and speak to us if you want to continue but isaac god bless you can you can you hear me yes we can no bless you god bless you church this is a little different but um trying to report in for duty so god bless you all um i can't hold my phone and hold your bible at the same time so we're gonna have to try to do it with you but it's certainly a great privilege uh to be here this evening on this bible study and to see what god is doing and and um to see that true the different challenges and struggles of life um something we have to push past the barriers you know to be able to to to get what what we need to get so we'll see what god will do certainly appreciate umbrella we're just standing in the in the gap i kind of shocked him when he's when i told him that the current the current just went you know so but by the grace of god i have a little thought that i want to share with you uh by the grace of god tonight so uh when we look at the the earthly genealogy of the lord jesus christ there are two major names uh that uh stand out you know and matthew picks it up in matthew 1 1 and i would have preached on this the book of the generations of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham and abraham we know as the father of nations we know him as as the prophet we know him as the foundation of the covenants that we access and david we know him as the king you know him as royalty we know as rulership you know the root and offstring of david and when we understand context and we have been kind of going back and forth in different bible studies touching different scriptures touching different uh points in the journey so to speak last week we were in judges and we were picking up gideon um the mighty warrior and that period we established uh in judges was between you know joshua coming into the land and the dispensation of the kings so in that time over the period of judges the whole concept of a king did not exist you know and it was after the judges that that that saw the as the prophet would have stepped in and the people looking around would have seen other kingdoms and say but we don't have a king you know why don't we have a king like the other nations do and and and and samuel was so hurt by it that god looked at the despair of his prophets and said don't worry samuel it's not you they have rejected that really rejected me you know and out of that we know came king saul who was the popular king he was the the i guess the natural selection he was the one that that would have automatically been considered the king by virtue of his height and his stature and his presence and the fact that he was somebody that people gravitate to and all these things and he would have served for uh 40 years and we know that after king saul king kim king came king david for another 40 years and there's a lot to say about king david um and he's one of one of the most wonderful characters in scripture to look at because we see king david as a boy we see him as a shepherd we see him as a musician there any king's palace we see him you know before that as a we see him as a hero with with goliath we see him in his role as a king we see him as a warrior and we even get to see a snapshot of him as an old man so in building where i'm going tonight i'm just kind of little background for where i really want to end up tonight um i want us to go to the book of first kings and first kings is really you know what what starts this whole you know kings and the lines of the kings and and and and and the ministry of elijah is all all found in there and i want to kind of pick up a little bit i'm going to kind of i mean it's just that time just kind of overview some aspects of it um and uh you have to bear with me a bit i'm actually trying to hold a light in one hand over over the bible here to to get this one um we're gonna kind of go over view of first kings and build into where i want to go uh tonight now i'm gonna kind of skip over the first part but we know king david is old and uh he's stricken in years and they they they are now trying to deal with this king david who who is struggling with with with about to go down and this kind of stuff and and i want to go from verse five then adonijah the son of haget exalted himself so this is david's son out of niger exhorted himself saying i will be king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and 50 men to run before him so he take it upon himself after seeing that his father king david is is starting to slip away he decided to appoint himself king and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying why has dow done so in other words the bible is saying here that this is happening and david made no remark about it he didn't comment about it he didn't see anything about it all right and he also was a very goodly man and his mother bear him after absalom and absalom if you recall would have been the one of david's son who had rebelled and there was a whole rebellion and and and if you don't know the story we'll try to get it at some point but we're building here and adonijah uh sorry uh and he conferred with joab the son of zeruah and joab would have been the command of the army and with abithia the priest and they followed adonijah and and the following adonis who helped him and they fallen but zadok the priest and ben nye the son of jehoiada and nathan the prophet and shema and ray and the mighty men which belonged to david were not with adonijah so i want you to see the picture david is on his bed he is tired he is wary he's sick he is not much he could do and while he is there he's sick his son decides it's my turn to be king it's it's my turn to to rule and he gets some support but some of the critical support he doesn't get at all and so we at verse nine now and i don't know an adviser slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of zehullah which is by n rogel and call all his brethren the king's sons and all the men of judah the king's servants but natan the prophet and benaya and the mighty men and solomon his brother he called not wherefore natan speak unto bathsheba and you will remember who bathsheba is she would have been the wife of uriah who was who was killed uh wherefore nation nathan spake unto bathsheba the mother of solomon saying hast thou not heard that ado niger the son of haget dot reign and david our lord know it it not now therefore come let me i pray thee give thee counsel that thou may have saved their own life and the life of thy son solomon we are we're going to verse 30 now i'm kind of laying a background to where i want to get to tonight go and get thee in unto king david and say not thou o lord i had me solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne widen that adonai jeremiah so nathan the prophet is seeing what is happening realize as it were that david doesn't know what is going on and that bathsheba who is solomon's mother doesn't know what's going on as well and they are and he is trying to now intervene in the situation right so verse 14 behold while thou yet talk is there with the king i also will come in after thee and confirm thy words so nathan is actually now planning it's not like it's not an accidental thing he's actually putting a plan in place and verse 15 and bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber and the king was very old so it placed in context i wanted to see this mighty man david this great king david this king david it would seem that aaron niger expects him to not take any action he is tired he is wary he's not aware of what is going on these are these are all the things that are happening there right so bashiba went in and to the king into the chamber and the king was very old and abhishek the sunnah might ministered unto the king and bathsheba bowed and did obeisance unto the king in other words did reverence and the king said what wouldest thou and she said unto him my lord thou swarest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid's saying assortedly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne and now behold arunai during it and now my lord the king don't know us it not in other words i don't think you realize you're hearing this bread but adonijah your other son actually claiming leadership not only that verse 19 and he had slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and i call all these sons of the king and abeetha the priest and joab the captain of the host so so she spreads in a picture of how much is happening but son of man thy servant had he not called and thou my lord o king the eyes of all israel are upon thee you you're you're seeing it the eyes of all israel upon thee that thou should just tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him this is all about me i really want to get to a point to lay a foundation for this right and i'll give you the title in a bit otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers in other words when he passed away that i and my solomon shall be counted offenders in other words and and in the amplified this offenders is like political enemies all right and law while she had talked with the king nathan the prophet also came in everybody with me and they told the king saying behold nathan the prophet and when he was coming before the king he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground and nathan said my lord o king hast thou said i don't know i just shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne for he has gone down this day and had slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and had called all the king's sons and the captains of the host and fear the priests and behold they eat and drink before him and say god save king adonijah just give me one minute i just the lord seems so hold on okay all right back back to normal okay can everybody hear me wonderful wonderful let me get position i have this light here and another light here and uh all right great well god bless you okay so we were let's so we had first kings one verse 25 for he has for he has gone down this day and had slain oxen and fat catalan so so nathan is building the scenario of exactly what the background is here right but me even me verse 26 thy servant so nathan is saying listen they're doing all this and me even me like seven and zadok the priests and benaya banaya is like the captain of the king's personal bodyguard these are these are important soldiers here right so banaya uh the son of johanna and thy seven solomon had he not called is this thing done by my lord the king and thou has not shown it unto thy servant who would sit on the throne of my lord the king after him then king david answered and said call me bathsheba and she came into the king's presence and stood before the king and i'm building this for a reason right and the king sway and said as the lord liveth that had redeemed my soul out of all distress and i love how david always says things it's never it's never a light statement but he told me the lord who had redeemed his soul from all distress right i love that is that how you feel this evening that the lord has delivered you from all distress is there anybody who feels that way had a rough week had a rough day had a rough month but when you look back david is there he this is the end of his junior i'm trying to many times we see david in his moments of strength we see we talk about goliath and we talk about the battle and mighty warrior david this is david on his bed winding down and he say oh god this lord who delivered me from all distress all right even as i sway unto thee by the lord god of israel saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my said even so will i certainly do this thee then bathsheba bowed with her head to the ut and did reverence to the king and said let my lord king david live forever and king david said call me zadok the priest so you say call the priest and nathan the prophet and the naya the son of jehoiada banaya is the captain of his personal god and they came before the king so i want you to see now the king this is king david he is old he is tired he is sick he is wary but he is sharp he is precise he understands that there is treachery in the camp he understands that adonijah has gone with the head of the army with joab he has gone with with one of the priests he has gone with a whole group of people and crowned himself but that is not deterring david's position because the plan of god and the purpose of god has to come to pass can the church say amen and the king also said unto them take with you the servants of your lord and cause solomon my son to ride upon my own mule and bring him down to gihon that is like a little water area there and let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him there king over israel and blow ye with the trumpet and say god save king solomon then shall he come up after him that he may come and sit upon my throne and he shall be king in my stead and i will have and i have appointed him to be ruler over israel and over judah i wanted to see this now friends that up until this point and and coming into under the 40 years on the soul this is the end of the 40 years under king david so this is now about 80 years of rulership under the two kings at this point in time it's about a transition to solomon being king and it was only over these three fours at 120 years the kingdom of israel was united it is only when king solomon died that there was this split between israel and judah so it's a mighty period this year's is what is called the over the golden age of the kings of israel because he had saul then he had king david the mighty king and then king solomon all right and ben and banaya the son of jehoiada like the head of the personal god answered the king and said amen the lord god of my lord the king say so too all right as the lord had been with my lord the king even so be here with solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king david so zadok the priest and natan the prophet and benaya the son of johanna and the cherokites and the pelatites now the chariotites and the pelatites that's the personal secret god of king you know what winning a king david any mighty men and his strong men david himself armed around him a special god maybe it was after the mutiny or the or the or the attempted coup by absalom but david had a personal strong god so when you see those men you know they were coming under david's orders right so xanax the priest and nathan the prophet and denied his son of johada and the cherokites and the pelaptites went down and caused solomon to ride upon king david's mule and brought him to gihon and zadok the priests took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle and anointed solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the people said god saved king solomon and all the people came up after him and the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth rent with the sound of them in other words they make so much noise out of it that the earth begin to move now i love how goddess on four things right verse 41 and adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating so i want you to picture it i don't i join them now they're not collect any plates they're not wrapping up the meal this is at a niger celebratory dinner and as they're packing up the plates and whining along the food and men taking napkins and wiping their mouth and saying the food was good everything food was real good out of niger and at the night and all the guests that were heard it as they were had made an end of eaten so they know wrapped up and they're hearing this noise and when joab he's commander of the whole army of israel and when job heard the sound of the trumpet he said wherefore is this noise of the city being in an opera in other words where is this noise coming from because as far as they concerned the only noise the only celebration the only thing that's happening is around adonijah who they appoint as their king all right this is man's action again this is man's choice man selection of the king and i love how god says it in scripture and while he yet speak so while joab trying to figure things out while he yet speak behold jonathan the son of a beater the priest came and adonai just said unto him come come in for now out of valiant man and bring his good tidings he said come and talk to me come on bring me any loop and why there's all this noise that's going on and jonathan answered and said to adonai verily our lord king david had made solomon king and the king had sent with him zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaya the son of johanna and the cherokees and the pelagites and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule and zalock the priest so if all of that is not enough and zara the priests and nato and the prophet have anointed him king and giulian and they are come up from thence rejoicing so that the city rang again this is the noise that he had heard on top of that verse 46 and also solomon sitted on the throne of the kingdom and moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king david saying him and make his throne better make his throne greater than thy throne and the king bowed himself upon the bed and also does say the king blessed be the lord god of israel which had given one to sit on my throne this day mine eyes even seeing it listen to verse 49 and all the guests that were with adonijah were afraid and rose up and went every man is weak party finish party crush everybody who came to celebrate with our niger they just had a sniff every man his own way everybody decided to go back to their own house they say we don't want the minions party in celebration anymore and adoniger verse 50 feared because of solomon and arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar what did i do and it was told solomon saying behold adonijah feared king solomon for lo he had caught hold on the horns of the altar saying let king solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword and solomon said if he will show himself a worthy man that shall not and hear of him fall to the good but if wickedness shall be found in him he shall die so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar and he came and bowed himself to king solomon and solomon said unto him go to thine house i'm still in that background trying to get to my text and this will be part one by the grace of god chapter two so i know many young people in particular haven't really studied this transition of power between david and solomon more than that this is declined so to speak of david's ministry here chapter two now the days of david drew nigh that he should die and he charged solomon his son saying you know i'm really big on last words but over reference paul in his letter to timothy which we know chronologically would have been one of the last if not the very last letter he wrote in where he said i fought a good fight we spoke about the last words of joshua so now we're coming to the last words of king david this great king david so when we read about jesus who was of the generation of the book of jesus son of abraham son of david these are hearing last words of king david chapter two verse one now the days of david drew nigh that he should die and he charged solomon his son saying in other words he is he's putting a battery pack in solomon he's giving solomon his part in words because he wants solomon to act a certain way never certainly conduct himself a certain way and this will lead into where i really want to go saying i go the way of all the earth be thou strong therefore and show thyself a man powerful statements be thou strong therefore and showed myself a man and that is really profound because the challenge of being strong is still a challenge to us today to be strong in our situations to be strong in our circumstances the instruction or the charge to be strong is similar to what god told joshua be strong and very courageous it is not physical strength he's talking about here it is not he's trying to lift up something and move it this is the strength of character the strength of purpose the strength of focus you strengthen not give up and showing yourself a man means there will come times when you could wimp out and you can throw your head up but that is when you have to show yourself a man and i find it to be very encouraging because we are in dangerous times we are in treacherous times where in times when men have feeling for fear and people losing their anchor willing to throw their heads up and give up but hear how david begins to instruct solomon and he and the order of the charge the order of the a charge like a commission so this is david's commission he's giving solomon a commission he's saying we have been also given a commission anybody with me tonight i go the way of all the earth in other words i'm about to go peed out strong therefore and show myself a man all right i'm going but don't be weak i'm going but don't give up all right and keep the charge of the lord thy god i love this to walk in his ways this is one of the most profound conversations a father can have with a son this is a father speaking to a son he's not just a king speaking to a king this is a father speaking to her son all right and keep the charge of the lord thy god to walk in his ways one to keep his statutes two and his commandments three and his judgments for and his testimonies five as it is written in the law of moses that thomas prosper in all that thou doest and whether so ever doubting is thyself i want to read that one more time because this principle still applies to us today that if you walk in his ways anybody with me if you keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgment and his testimony oh hallelujah as it is written in the law of moses which was only a shadow of what was to come but we understand what is being said here huh that dom may is prosper in all not some in all in other words do these five things and watch you prosper in all that thou doest this is not some this is not just business this is school this is family this is relationship this is in your community this is in your place of work in all it's a unbreakable principle and this is the charge that david is giving to solomon is this cutting through the noise here with whatsoever and when or so so not just prosper in what you're doing you know but with us whoever you're telling yourself wherever you go because you're following a principle hmm oh this give worship a little bit saints while we reach a little bit just give them some praise give us some praise and thanks hallelujah lord be thank you lord we praise you lord we worship you we honor you hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen everybody with me amen okay great so we're going to start without timing yourself that the lord may continue his word so david is speaking to solomon i'm talking about the continuation of your word you know hallelujah that the lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me that's that's powerful i wanted to see the connections through scripture because we talk about the ministry of jehu how god spoken to elijah but we didn't see the connection between god speaking to elijah and elisha picking up the continuation of the word and that word continuing through a son or somebody from the school of the prophets that was able to fulfill it but it was a continuation of the word so here it is david and we know it king solomon was he wanted to build the temple because david hand was too bloody but this was a continuation of the word that the lord may continue his word which he speak concerning me saying if thy children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul they shall not fear thee said he a man on the throne of israel all right so last words all right so i want to quickly wrap up this i'm going to kind of speed through this part here so david what do you admire about david david is wrapping up his ministry now he charged solomon he gave solomon a powerful commission apart and then he he he leaves his his last secret orders to his son and jesse you understand how god operates and and you can see why god operates the way that he does and he could see how god could say david a man after my own heart moreover so after that whole powerful introduction he said moreover don't know us also what joab the captain of the army the son of zero zero is his sister so this is david's nephew joab is david's nephew zero is david's sister moreover i don't know it's also what joab my nephew the son of z of zer did to me in other words how he hurt me and what he did to the two captains of the host of israel unto abner the son of nir abner was saul's commander of the army so when saul was king abner was commander of the army and if you go back in in samuel you will read that david did not want abner to be killed but joab went against david orders and killed abner because abner had killed his brother and david said don't take no revenge on him but joab took it upon himself to kill abner so david is going he's leaving the earth he's he's leaving this plane he charges solomon and say solomon i have some unfinished business that you have to continue all right moreover don't know it's also what joab the son of zero he's come he's still commander of the army right now did to me and what he did to the two captain of the host of israel unto abner the son of nu who was commander on the soul and unto amasa amasa is actually joab's cousin so this is also solomon's cousin he became he was the commander on the absalom in the rebellion and when absalom was defeated and david came back in power david put amazon to head the army which joa was furious about and again outside of david's instruction drew up also killed amazon so david is going but he wants to tie up these these loose ends these are loose ends being tied up in david's ministry here all right whom he slew and shed the blood of war in peace meaning it was in a time of peace that joab did this and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on his sweet do therefore it's like we lose you there uh the audio or something with the audio then just do the f4 just repeat that you hear me now yeah yes back again yes dude therefore according to my wisdom and let not his horror head this world is like grey head don't let his gray head go down to the grave in peace in other words punish him for what he did right but show kindness unto the sons of basilia the gilead right and let them be of those that eat at that table why for so they came to me when i fled because of absalom thy brother and behold thou has with thee and he goes on and verse 10 just to kind of close this part up so david slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david and the days that david reigned over israel were 40 years all right so i want to know can i just introduce my thought for tonight and it is a study of solomon part 1 and i want to call it the prayer of solomon and i want to build from there so i want us to now skip over to first kings 3 and we're going to read from verse 3. so david has gone on and i want to play some context here so we could kind of go forward here all right everybody with me first kings three verse three and solomon loved the lord is that a beautiful statement and how how does he prove it walking in the statutes of david his father so it's not just love the lord and he and he love you lord and you're living your own your own way he's he's trying his best with what he knows all right so and solomon loved the lord walking in the statute of david his father and he amplified it will say at first and we'll get to that in another teaching only he sacrificed and burned incense in high places meaning that was somewhat of a negative and this is contextual because we know salomon would build the temple um and going up to a mountain to do a sacrifice with some level was considered a heathen thing at the time and the king verse 4 went to gibeon to sacrifice there for that was the great high place a thousand burnt offerings that solomon offer upon that altar now verse five in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream my night and god asked and god said ask what i shall give thee a powerful question what shall i give thee and i remember many times preaching and i say if the lord were to come tonight and grant the desires of your heart church what would that desire be that's a deep question the lord could daughter come to you right now you remember sister hattie right she said you're writing so the prophet said what can i do for you what do you want your lord to do for you whatever your will be granted it's a really powerful deep question that really assesses your character your nature all right so this is why i call it the prayer of solomon because i found it to be such a a moving call it a a prayer it's part of a dream but it's jesus it comes across as a petition right verse 5 and giving the lord appeared to sullivan in a dream by night and god said ask what i shall give thee and the reason i call it a prayer as well and i don't know if you remember uh brother billy paul one time said he walked into his father's study and he saw it was as if brother branham was just having a conversation so he wasn't sure who his father was was speaking to because he didn't like know if anybody was there so and then when he looked closer he saw his father by himself and he realized that his father was praying and many times we tell we try to encourage you prayers and about thee thou thine prayer is a conversation prayer is is fellowship with god prayer is you having a a relationship and a conversation with god so when god asks the question what can i do for thee what he's really activating is your request once you're making a request that falls on the prayer and you should be in a position at all times to be able to express to god what you want him to do for you but ibrahim said it like this he said we don't act for big things he says what's the actual big things some of us we want god help us with some little thing and there are big things we could ask for but i wanted to look into solomon because i'm still all this is background to where i want to end up and solomon said thou has showed thy unto thy servant david my father great mercy according as he had walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou has kept for him this great kindness that thou has given him a son to sit on his throne as it as it is this day and now oh lord my god thou has made thy servant king instead of david my father and and this is what sort of blow my mind in the approach and i am but a little child i know not how to go out or come in and i'm reading this and i'm looking at my life looking at different lives looking at different scriptures looking at different situations and i'm watching this is not humility on this play this is a transparent honest conversation without a fear of coming across as being weak solomon is pouring out his heart and he's reaching that point saying listen i know not how to go out or how to come in and i find so many times we approach life as if we know the key to the next door in our situation we operate with this call it a false sense of security in our experience because i want us to put this in further context this is solomon who would have grown up in the house of a king he would have been afforded the best education he would have been trained to be in the royal family his mother knew along with the prophet nathan that he was earmarked for king so he would have had the best training the best tutors the best governors the best overseers he was preparing to be a leader and he is not leaning on that this reminds us of moses moses after the best training in egypt when he met the burning bush anybody with me when he came into contact with god none of his education his experiences his his ups and downs and his struggles and what he achieved all of it seemed to disappear you see the parallel david solomon moses go through scripture when you come into contact with god you cannot produce a resume hallelujah you cannot bring your gifts your experience your knowledge to the table and solomon in his own simple way because many times we go through life and we make decisions and the consequences that we face is because of our decision and because we didn't have enough trust in god and i want to connect this to where we're going to end up because all this is it's background to get where i want to end up and i will explain when we get there why i wanted to do it this week i want to say it one time i know oh lord my god thou has made thy servant king may thy servant king could be applied to any area you have made me a father you've made me a mother you have given me this job you have given me this responsibility you have given me whatever god has given you but i know not how to go out or come in so i don't want to venture in my own strength i don't want to venture with my own ability i don't want to try to do this thing my own way i have ideas i have suggestions i i hear from a father we did it but i want to do it your way i don't know when last time you go along on your knees and say to the lord lord i don't know how to go out i don't know how to come in i don't know how to resolve this situation i don't know how to turn this thing around i've been entrusted because solomon is saying i've been pushed into a place that i didn't plan i didn't put myself here come on now i've been pushed into this walk as a christian and i didn't choose this walk this walk chose me solomon didn't go up for election to be king he was given a charge he was given a commission he was called out of all of the sons of david because david had many sons and there were sons who wanted the position this one didn't try to get the position he didn't try to become king he didn't rally around him and say i want to do this this was not his desire to be in that position and now it's entrusted upon him he is doing one of the most powerful things and god is pleased he is pleased the way god could say david a man after my own heart we could see solomon was connected to that same same behavior that god was attracted to and thy servant verse 8 is in the midst of thy people which dao has chosen you see the context this is a challenge to us as leaders as ministers as elders as deacons as fathers whatever role we're in and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou has chosen are great people so so in his approach and his prayer he is placing himself as the one who doesn't know who needs guidance and he's magnifying the people he said thy servant is in the myth of thy people which dao has chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude anybody with me tonight give therefore thy servant an understanding heart oh my now we're getting into the area that i want to get in give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and bad you know how much trouble you would have avoided if you could discern your good decisions from the bad decisions you know how much trouble you would avoid if you discern the good people around you from the bad people around you you know how much trouble you would overcome if you had an understanding heart to judge situations and people that and understand how we place it that i may discern because things can come to you and you're not understanding but you need discernment if there ever was a time church to need discernment spiritual discernment there are many things happening around us but we need deserve it we need we need the eye south to come off of our eyes this is what solomon is praying for huh that i may deserve between good and bad for who is able to judge this thigh so great of people he's saying lord is your people what if fathers do that about their children come on now you didn't make each item what if mothers do it for their children it's it's a gift it is a gift entrusted to us as parents it's a gift and you have to say lord i don't know how to go out i don't know how to come in i don't know how to do this because it's your gift you know what this child needs come on now the lord bless you with a business it is not your achievement we are under different law what the world does is separate from what we do come on now what the world does is they're under a different principle but you your business your career your job your degree it has been the grace of god and god allowing it to come to you now for you to have a responsibility with it i want you to see that because if you claim it as your achievement we talk about gideon god say i don't want to make no mistake about it that no credit could be taken by man when it comes to god's kingdom he doesn't want man taking credit he wants to get all the honor all the glory anybody with me tonight and listen to verse 10 and this speech please the lord oh my you know your prayer could please you lord it's like sister hati right it's the same thing please the lord in other words she said the right thing in other words solomon said the right thing and i've said it before you could say the right thing the consequences your tomorrow your next week your next month is a product of you saying the right thing you have to speak positive you have to speak right you have to if you don't know what to say don't say nothing but abraham said you see if you have nothing good to say don't say nothing at all anybody with me because your words have power and this these words that solomon said was so powerful that it pleased the lord verse 10 and his speech please the lord that solomon had accessed thing and god said to him because thou has asked this thing listen to how god look at it because god has asked this thing and has not asked for thyself long life neither has acts riches for thyself now has asked the life of thine enemies but has acts for thyself understanding the discern judgment how many parents are asking for understanding to discern judgment how many christian business people are asking for understanding to discern judgment how many people on their job saying lord i have a promotion coming give me understanding the design judgment i do not want to walk into this board meeting alone i do not want to walk into this presentation alone anybody with me tonight i want to bring it home because people disconnect scripture and and what has happened with their daily lives there's nothing wrong with praying before you go to work there's nothing wrong with praying in your work there's nothing wrong with praying before your static computer there's nothing wrong with praying before you're working a presentation come on now i want you to understand that if you take this approach lord i'm gonna attempt this thing but i don't want to tell me without you guide my hands guide my thoughts help me stay focused helping out the prizes thing how to cook this food come on now that's the relationship that you want to have with us why wouldn't you use the best resource that you could ever have the best friend who you don't have to reach too far to reach him because he's always there once you call him he responds because that's how he wants to be anybody with me tonight let's make it personal let's make it personal because thou has asked this thing because of what you asked for because of how your aspect because of how you're presented to me and has not asked for myself long life in other words he wasn't looking at his own self you know his asking for understanding for judgment was a body people you have to understand church that our lives are not just for us our lives is for our families our lives is for the kingdom when have you ever asked for something for the kingdom whenever have you asked for something for somebody else outside of yourself and you want to get blessed but you're going to god lord be me my my me me my mind solomon's prayer had no me and my in it it was i am not equipped to deal with this challenge there are people around me who need leadership i'm entrusted with leadership but i want your guidance with how to lead i want your guidance without to leave my family i want you guys to leave the church i want you guys to leave my business whatever is your domain you want guidance because we are all kings we went through this teaching kings and priests royal priesthood so i'm speaking to kings tonight i want to charge you tonight like david chad solomon because there was that charge that david gave to solomon that now has solomon approaching things a certain way because he's walking in his statutes of his father forgive me for being excited but i wanna i wanna push this so you could break past the strong barrier of your life break past whatever's holding you back break past whatever limit you place upon yourself or you allow the enemy to place on you or your family to place on you and i'm saying you could ask the right thing you could say the right thing and god could give you spiritual understanding understanding to know how to move what to do every day of your life somebody say amen we go on and go outside i can't even pass this i even this is still in background that's why i got going on the ladder this is steady i have reached the subject of what i want to get to yet right because thou has existing and has not asked for thyself long life neither has acts riches for thyself now has asked the life of the enemies which is also for yourself but has asked for thy self understanding to own judgment behold i have done according to thy words lo listen carefully i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any rise like unto thee you see that scripture so i want to place solomon in his position tonight so you understand the context for when we read in scripture of jesus himself was rep was worse was mentioned in solomon this is the context in which it was done right and i have also given thee that which thou has not asked so you mean to tell me brother is like that i could ask god and he could give me things i even asked for oh my my my my my my my mind listen to the lord verse 13 and i have also given thee that which doubt has not asked brought riches and honor so that there shall not be any among the kings like under the old ideas and if god will walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my commandments as thy father david walked then i will lengthen your days so in other words everything that god taught you is going to ask for or say you could i ask for this go give him all of that too because he asks for the right thing anybody with me tonight a few more minutes because this teaching by the grace of god will have to continue all right so solomon we know would reign as king for 40 years this was the beginning of his ministry all right so saul was there for 10 years david was there for 10 years solomon was there for 10 years and we know that under solomon the king of israel became stronger wealthier it was 40 years of peace in fact the name solomon is a derivative from the word shalom which means peace so it actually means peace as well men from all over the world would come to listen to solomon solomon was the author of the book of proverbs he wrote a lot of songs the queen of sheba but iran and preacher message on the queen of sheba and he dramatized it how the queen of sheba heard about it and and and let me see if i just have it here in solomon's time brother branham said and i wouldn't get him to read all of it but he was dramatizing how it was a long journey maybe about three months for the queen of sheba because she had heard by the reputation of his wisdom and she wanted to be convinced and she came to ask these hard questions and by time she left she came with doubts about his wisdom and left saying in other words he wiser than i even thought he was king solomon will go on to build the temple and we we know all of this but i wanted to really now strike on to what i really want to get on this whole time to place the context i really wanted to touch the book of proverbs because it is i wanted to make sure and pass through the journey to get to the book of proverbs because the book of words proverbs 1 1 says the proverbs of solomon the son of david king of israel and for the next few minutes until we lock off this is this is we're going to spend our time in proverbs because i want to bring out some things here to encourage you a little bit and to lay a perspective here to encourage us how we should go just want to give my other transition here so proverbs 1 1 so as a result i want to put this as a result of solomon's prayer as a result of how he walked as a result of the commission that was given to him from his father david as a result of the word that was covering him solomon was the wisest man until christ and we know it from the scripture in matthew 12 verse 38 then certain of the scribes one of the pharisees answered saying master we would see a sign from thee in other words show us something jesus but he answered and sent it to them an evil and adulterous generation seek it after a sign and there shall be no sign given to it for the sign of the prophet jonas for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the ut the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold are greater than jonas is here and the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost part of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here powerful powerful scripture so i want to encourage the church and the young people and as a young man growing up i was saying my dad didn't remember i was sharing with my dad i think i was around 12 or 13 years old and there's some novel some book i wanted to read and my dad told me you're not gonna get that book until you read the seven church ages so i went and read these seven church ages in its entirety at age 12 so i could get to the novel that i wanted to read and as a young man growing up the book of proverbs was a go-to book it is a book of such wisdom inspiration advice counsel whether it's your life whether it's school whether it's relationship whether it's marriage business productivity everything there you can find it in the book of proverbs and proverbs has 31 chapters so i remember saying to the young people years ago this is a book that you could take a month and study every single chapter of proverbs take proverbs one on the first every month all the way down day by day and study it and if you begin to apply the principles here because having studied business and having gone to school and i haven't been through all kinds of experiences when i look through this i said with them everything they're trying to explain and everything is in in in this book in them so let's read a few verses and we'll wrap this up tonight the proverbs of solomon the son of david king of israel and i want you to understand why this book exists because i find it very troubling that a lot of christians and in particular message believers seem to want to accept a lack of training a lack of warning your skills a lack of mastery i want to use that word mastery all right because the bible talk about striving for the mastery in other words you have to want to be able to master circumstances by the holy ghost it must be a desire that you have that you're not always out of control you're not always you don't know what's going on and you're you're being dashed all around but when you read proverbs you see context here to know wisdom verse 2 and instruction so the proverbs has a purpose the purpose is to know wisdom and instruction what we're doing in bible study is about instruction we're taking time to go through scripture to pull keys instructions wisdom to know wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of understanding all right in the amplified that verse 2 says to know skillful and godly wisdom and instruction to discern and comprehend the words of understanding and insight we cannot in 2020 go around not interested in knowing how to raise our children we cannot in 2020 going around and saying well that's how it's always been and not know how to save money manage your finances because in this in this same proverbs talk about how you manage your investments in this same book of proverbs talk about every encounter how you can get in trouble if the book of proverbs gives you and the bible in general in its entirety gives you the keys to know how to navigate life you have no excuse it's one thing to say whether you don't know but now in this age when we are reading from not just the scripture but the open book because we are the prophet who come to to tie up the loose ends and to break this thing open so we can read any scripture and see the full magnitude of what it means for our day luther couldn't do what we do and now wesley can do what we do and now the pentecostals could not do what we're doing now but now we have the fullness to receive verse 3 the instruction of wisdom so it means that wisdom can be instructed in the amplified to receive instruction and wise behavior so i want to now push all these message believers who can't behave this is foundational principles we're talking about to know wise behavior and the discipline of wise thoughtfulness that's what the bible says be transformed by the renewing of your mind so your mind have to change until your thinking changes your behaviors will not change so before we even go into proverbs 2 3 31 solomon is laying a context listen what will be said in new testament about be transformed by the renewal of your mind in other words the rebooting of your mind changing the lessons you may have learned in school or from your natural house to getting spiritual understanding spiritual wisdom spiritual knowledge not just in spiritual things but as peter would say all things between the life life and godliness marriage and godliness business and godliness how to pay your taxes and godliness how to save and god it is how to run a good business and godliness how to get promoted and good and godliness life and godliness anybody with me i hope this doesn't encourage you new tonight i'm pushing you to strive more there is no excuse i challenge you church you have to develop a discipline because this is bringing us back to being students of scripture god told joshua meditate on the word day and night it is not a suggestion can i say that one more time it's not a is that a recommendation it is a requirement your whole life will change when you see the power of how this world affects impacts influences changes your life i wrote down and i try and i just say my own personal testimony i know we're running all the time i think on sunday evening also i wrote on a piece of paper how much time per day i want to read the scripture how much time per day i want to read the prophet's message how much time per day i want to read and study things put into my job how much time per day is my personal time i wrote down how much time i want to sleep i remember how much time is family time because if you don't take control of your time other things will take control of your time you cannot meditate on the word day and night if you are not planning how you spend your time your time is not open to be optionally yo you're tossed to and fro you you don't know where you're gonna be this evening you're not sure how tomorrow look you have to take a level of control over the ship of your life am i challenging you am i pushing you the same diligence you want to cram for an exam slow that down and be diligent to learn it become a master of your work become a master of scripture have a discipline i wrote how much time i want to spend praying to because if you don't plan for prayer it will it time will not create itself anybody with me could you take some more verse 3 to receive the instruction of wisdom justice and judgment and equity listen to the amplified of that to receive instruction and wise behavior and the discipline of wise thoughtfulness righteousness justice and integrity verse 4 to give certainty to the simple listen to the amplified that prudence good judgment asked you common sense so you see solomon interested in common sense you know what he's saying in this engineering commercial not so common so the reason the answer to common sense being not so common is scripture you he said these proverbs are to help solve that issue listen to verse five after trying to speak i want to bring so close already gracious we continue along this being a study of solomon part two listen to verse five a wise man will hear and will increase learning and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels to understand a proverb and the interpretation the words of the wise and their dark sings verse seven the fear of the law is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction so i in a call and people fooling them solomon the wisest man who ever lived describing the attributes of a fool and a fool is someone who despised wisdom and instruction so i take a position friends i say you could ask brother of it every time i do a bible study i still believe it but i feel every time i do more i feel i know less the more i read is the less i realize i know and it's a perspective because you realize how vast god is how big god is how powerful god is and it takes something for you to realize as well that you have to always be learning i have met too many people in the message who feel they reach somewhere but when you read this that there's no place for reaching nowhere solomon is king and say i arrange nowhere i don't know where i do i don't know how to go and go to come out moses reaching funny but i said i don't know i don't know and outside of the environment of the pillar of fire he would not have spoken that way but once he came into presence presence highlighted how much he did not know isaiah we talked about this isaiah warned to them war until you warned to you and when he come into presence he said why is me i want to challenge us tonight because we're in presence tonight once we're around the world of god we in presence and i said highlight a little look at my life again i can do better that's what i want to encourage us with tonight i can raise above my depression i can raise above my frustration i can raise above my despair i can raise above my opposition and the obstacles any challenges because challenges will come there must come that's life there's no life without challenges that is what makes life life but how you rise above it it's what distinguishes you can the church say amen hallelujah the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fool despised wisdom and instruction friends i have a lot more because i really want to get some principles out of the book of proverbs tonight uh well well in general but i don't need time tonight i just want to touch quickly from proverbs 3 and familiar scripture but i think now more than ever we should be resting on this so problem stream we'll close out with this verse 5 trust in the lord with all thine hearts with all nine hearts i've said it before many people come and they bring stuff to the lord and they rest say you bring it at your altar and they say well lord i will you take care of my child i will you help me and the moment you finish pray of your you grab it back and walk back a bit on your shoulder and walk outside with it trust with all with all means you can leave it with the lord and no don't worry about it anymore i know it's hard it sounds hard to know but trust means lord he is big enough to take your bit all right trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto their own understanding now i want you to pick to parallel this with solomon's prayer because someone in his prayer was saying i don't want to use my understanding which he had i don't want to use my wisdom which i have i don't i want to trust in you i like a child i don't know how to go out to come trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct ipads and i'm challenging you church acknowledge him in all your ways give god credit i'll close with this i have some friends christian business friends and one of them blows my mind completely and he was sharing with me that in the midst of this pandemic it has been his best year of doing business and he said to me isaac the reason that is is because i pray for every employee i pray for managers i pray for these stores i pray i bring it to god i have got to have been choose the product i have got and i say how many of us try to involve god in our decisions and he is bold enough he doesn't know the message but he's bold enough to tell anybody he meets everything i have you see what you've seen around me i do it or not it was a lord and i say look how he has tapped into a principle and we who are in a message who are supposed to have access to the fullness of the world and he fools every truth we want to hide in his shadow and and we are afraid to have a testimony you see that word testimony remember david's charge to solomon keep his testimonies are you keeping your testimony in this pandemic i want to challenge you to keep your testimony your testimony as the sun your testimony as a daughter your testimony as a father your testimony as a mother most importantly your testimony as a christian and a christian is not church going i'm talking about christ like that when people see you they see jesus when they see you they are inspired when they see you they are drawn to him not drawn to you not drawn to the church drawn to him there's something about you because you are keeping your testimony so may the lord bless you tonight can we bow our heads up with a friend greatest heavenly father lord another teaching tonight the order we thank you that we're able to make it true lord to see how even in this service tonight lord we had our challenges and how the enemy may have tried to to to fight but law we made it through by the grace of god lord to have a a word of encouragement to your people in this hour of darkness and depression and anxiety and uncertainty as it were to the world but to us we have comfort we have peace we have safety we have a blessed assurance so lord we don't want to be under the spirit or the atmosphere of the world out there we pray for peace peace in the valley peace in the midst of the storms of our lives peace lord daughter storms be raging lord we we read about gideon last week how we put the fleece and he said lord let let the ground be wet but the fleece be dry lord if you could do it there lord there could be display everywhere but the blood on our houses lord can keep our houses safe father you are able to do lord beyond what we can even ask or think your scripture says it that way you're able to do exceededly abundantly above all we could ask cutting according to the power that worked in us father and there's a power in us that's true this word this revealed word god that came through a prophet lord as he looked into the scripture to find out where we were in the scripture he saw where he was we must find out where we are lord may you show us who we are tonight in your word may you encourage us may we lord desire lord the word that we can grow in understanding as solomon speaks about growing wisdom as solomon speaks about grow in knowledge lord and not make excuses about what our limitations are but we'll have a hunger and a thirst for righteousness we'll have a hunger the bible says in bro with all thy getting get understanding help us to understand so we can be better fathers we can be better mothers we can be better husbands better wives better believers better business people better workers better career people better students whatever it may be give us understanding father because with that spiritual understanding all other blessings are connected to its lord he said wisdom is a principle thing giving people wisdom wisdom in this hour wisdom lord to do the right thing wisdom to listen to that still small voice father may you bless your church tonight may you bless our pastor may you bless the minister elders deacons helps and governments and through this whole pandemic that has reshaped reformed restructured how we do church as it were lord may you lift your people up lord may we become strong like eagles father that could fly alone when we have to fly alone but where the carcass is the eagles can gather together as we have gathered here tonight lord to see lord your mind as your prophet said if we read the bible and don't see jesus in every verse we have to read it again so help us tonight to rise to the occasion to rise to the challenge of the hour lord if there's any families in here struggling be it financial struggle lord may you lord show them the way lord may you give them comfort may you guide them may you give them the ideas the opportunities the doors the right doors the right ideas the right opportunities love me

your people a deeper understanding of how powerful you are give your people a greater understanding of how mighty you are give your people a greater understanding that there's no demon no weapon no principality no power no spiritual wickedness nothing can stop the purpose of god concealing them may you bless the people tonight and may you strengthen your church tonight in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen may the lord bless you tonight service continues tomorrow night at 8 pm live streaming and friday night prayer meeting may the lord richly bless you and looking for
