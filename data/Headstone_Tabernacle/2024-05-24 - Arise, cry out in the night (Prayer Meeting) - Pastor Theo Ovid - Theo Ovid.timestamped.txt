[14:49] comes about you know God have rain son
[14:52] God have their Seasons e uh summer
[14:55] winter Autumn spring and so on like that
[14:57] and you just have to be able to work
[14:59] with what God put as his laws and these
[15:03] things are to help us these things are
[15:05] to that we could Guided by it these laws
[15:08] and principles and he put these laws and
[15:10] principles in his word so tonight I have
[15:12] two portion of scriptures i' like to
[15:14] read for you tonight and there from Luke
[15:16] chap
[15:17] 6:12 and Lamentations chap 2: 19 Luke
[15:21] chap 6 verse
[15:24] 12 it reads and it came and it came to
[15:27] pass in those days
[15:30] that talking about Jesus that he went
[15:32] out into a mountain to
[15:34] pray and continued all night in prayer
[15:39] to God let me read it again speaking
[15:42] about Jesus it came to pass in those
[15:44] days that he went out into a mountain to
[15:46] pray and continued all night in prayer
[15:50] to
[15:51] God
[15:53] Lamentations chapter 2:
[15:56] 19 it says arise
[15:59] cry out in the
[16:00] night in the beginning of the
[16:03] watches pour out thine heart like water
[16:08] before the face of the
[16:10] Lord lift up thy hands towards him for
[16:14] the life of thy young
[16:16] children that faint for hunger in the
[16:21] top of every street tonight I have
[16:24] something very small to share with you
[16:27] arise cry out in the
[16:29] night you know just a few moments ago I
[16:33] was thinking
[16:35] about how much people died in the
[16:38] covid-19 season when they had the virus
[16:42] maybe over 7 million people but a lot of
[16:45] people
[16:46] died and I'm thinking that our lives and
[16:49] you are here tonight have been
[16:52] spared and we have a lot to thank God
[16:56] for some people suffered from something
[16:59] called long covid some of them still
[17:02] suffering and but the cycle of God moves
[17:07] on and if God spared us through that
[17:11] whole season of Despair and lock down
[17:15] and everything else that means there has
[17:18] to be some other purpose why we are here
[17:21] on the earth and you are the one to seek
[17:25] to to find that purpose that God put you
[17:28] here for
[17:29] and instead of being upset and angry be
[17:33] grateful and be
[17:35] thankful there are twoo many people that
[17:37] are not grateful and thankful but
[17:39] tonight we want to say arise cry out in
[17:43] the night why would you
[17:46] cry
[17:47] and you
[17:49] know brother Bram labored to show that
[17:53] God's love is not parental love the love
[17:56] we have for our children on our
[17:59] grandchildren our family that is not the
[18:04] type of love that God
[18:07] has God has elective
[18:11] love and he chose you and elected you
[18:15] and that is how he expresses his love to
[18:18] you so whether you are poor or Rich
[18:23] whether you are b or free whether you
[18:25] have or you don't have whether you are
[18:28] young or old sick dying doesn't matter
[18:31] through the mountains through the floods
[18:33] through the fire all come through the
[18:36] blood and it's an expression of God love
[18:39] to
[18:40] us time and chance happen to all men so
[18:44] that you cannot compare yourself with
[18:46] somebody else the opportunities God
[18:49] presented to you was designed for you
[18:54] was ordained for you and is up to you
[18:58] you to
[19:01] maximize the opportunities that God has
[19:04] presented to you I want I say
[19:06] opportunities I'm talking about
[19:08] opportunities to be a better
[19:10] person opportunities to be a better
[19:13] Christian it's not just opportunities in
[19:15] business or in wealth or in money or
[19:17] wealth creation no just like the man
[19:20] with the talents God want increase God
[19:23] don't want to say what you give me I'm
[19:26] giving you back he wants to see if we
[19:29] could multiply if we could add if we
[19:32] could change if we could become horned
[19:35] or polished he want to see Improvement
[19:38] in US it has to start in us
[19:43] now job 4210 says and the Lord turned
[19:47] the Captivity of job when he prayed for
[19:51] his
[19:52] friends also the lord gave job twice as
[19:56] much as he had before now this is a
[19:58] scripture we used a couple of years ago
[20:01] or months ago about what God did for job
[20:06] and how job was blessed look at the
[20:09] sequence of him getting a double portion
[20:12] or getting twice what he had before he
[20:15] prayed for his friends now these friends
[20:18] these so-called friends is the ones that
[20:19] was accusing him of being a secret
[20:22] sinner the same friends who came to
[20:24] comfort him we know the story of Job
[20:26] lost his wealth his children health
[20:29] left to suffer in
[20:32] misery they accuse him of being a sinner
[20:36] what answered job and God and job
[20:39] repented of the words he choose the
[20:43] words he
[20:44] used God rebuked job friends and ask
[20:49] them to make sacrifices and let job pray
[20:51] for them note he couldn't get that
[20:55] double portion or that double
[20:57] blessing on until he had to express
[21:00] forgiveness and compassion of God then
[21:04] God could truly bless job I wonder today
[21:08] when brotherly kindness is positionally
[21:10] placed in that position just before that
[21:13] Holy Spirit SL that love divine
[21:16] SL if God is not waiting for us to show
[21:20] that forgiveness and that compassion
[21:24] it's a great need there but this job
[21:28] experience
[21:29] shows that not because you're wealthy
[21:32] not because you are healthy not because
[21:34] things are working good around you and
[21:37] you are hedged around that nothing
[21:39] cannot change from that God proved that
[21:43] he would keep and preserve those who are
[21:47] faithful and those who trust him God
[21:51] proves that suffering is not always a
[21:55] result of sin but suffering also can be
[22:00] a test of
[22:02] faith and a means by which God get that
[22:07] growth that grow
[22:09] store okay
[22:12] so what God wants from us is a is a
[22:17] relationship you know nobody likes
[22:20] people to come to them just for
[22:22] things give me give me give me I could
[22:26] have this um you you you have extra
[22:29] something I could get it please I could
[22:31] get it you know you you want this you
[22:33] want that but you have no connection you
[22:37] have no friendship you have no
[22:38] fellowship with that person and I think
[22:41] God is about the same we keep asking him
[22:44] for things I want a car I want a job I
[22:46] want a wife I want a husband I want a
[22:47] this I want a that I want all kind of
[22:49] things doesn't matter things but what
[22:52] God is really interested in is
[22:54] relationship why would Jesus pray all
[22:57] night
[22:58] why would Jesus see the need to pray the
[23:03] way he
[23:04] did Jesus if we look at it
[23:08] from a a a holistic distant he was
[23:14] God why did he he even have to
[23:18] pray it it should be or it could be that
[23:22] maybe he didn't have to pray because he
[23:25] was God but he prayed and he didn't just
[23:28] pray
[23:29] he prayed all night Jesus saw in need to
[23:34] pray all night and we'll find out how
[23:37] important that burden of prayer is later
[23:41] on so God want to have a relationship
[23:45] with us and relationship have to do with
[23:48] how we
[23:49] behave towards each
[23:51] other the way people feel towards each
[23:54] other relationship is something that is
[23:57] built you you don't just meet somebody
[23:59] and you know you can you know you have a
[24:02] relationship and no it's it's built you
[24:05] have a close relationship or working
[24:07] relationship um so in that way
[24:12] tonight could be something that you
[24:15] could see a little different that your
[24:17] connection to God tonight or your prayer
[24:20] to God tonight could establish a
[24:23] connection and a relationship with God
[24:26] and that is what God wants
[24:30] um sister
[24:32] salana sent something to meet tonight
[24:36] and I thought it fit to share it with
[24:37] you I didn't ask her permission but I
[24:40] think it should be fine she was saying
[24:43] that she was studying on King David and
[24:45] Saul these two
[24:47] characters and she end up on
[24:50] Samuel and I begin to study Hannah's
[24:52] struggle for being
[24:55] Barren and her love for this child after
[24:59] receiving him that made her giv him back
[25:02] to the Lord the more I think about her
[25:05] struggle and her giving back I know it
[25:09] had to be God now this is powerful
[25:14] because she was Barren and she was being
[25:15] a reproach and she was being ridiculed
[25:17] and mocked and everything else and here
[25:19] it is she got through to have a child
[25:22] and she said Lord if you bless me I'll
[25:24] give this child back to you now
[25:27] selfishness would do the exact opposite
[25:31] selfishness could say the Lord has
[25:35] blessed me this is my child I raising
[25:40] him my way and and I am keeping him for
[25:43] me myself I but not Hanah listen what
[25:48] said you
[25:49] know A love for this child after
[25:53] receiving him made her give him back to
[25:55] the Lord the more I think about her
[25:58] struggle and her giv back I know it had
[26:01] to be God my mind went back to to you
[26:04] hearing say hearing you saying because
[26:07] of Jacob's struggle a nation was
[26:11] born and now here is Han Hanah with her
[26:15] struggle and what an amazing Prophet was
[26:18] given because of her
[26:22] struggle I
[26:24] saw then why God spoke to Jeremiah so
[26:28] highly about Moses and Samuel they had
[26:31] to be really special in God's eyes but
[26:35] over with all that I have learned from
[26:37] these studies my final thought our
[26:42] struggles our
[26:44] battles once we give it back to God it
[26:48] always yields its
[26:51] rewards he always makes all things work
[26:55] out for good God bless you Sana thank
[26:57] you so much much for sharing that with
[26:59] us
[27:01] tonight Lamentations chapter 219 we read
[27:05] arise crowd in the night in the
[27:08] beginning of the watches pour out thine
[27:10] heart like water before the face of the
[27:13] Lord lift up thy hands towards him for
[27:18] the life of thy young
[27:21] children to cry out I wrote this here is
[27:25] to have an emotional vocalized outburst
[27:29] due to an intense feeling of
[27:32] suffering a great need a cry out for
[27:34] help or relief are crying out of for
[27:38] despair or pain or fear or
[27:42] Joy an uran
[27:46] situation the cry out is a desperate cry
[27:50] Psalms 34:17 says the righteous cry and
[27:54] the Lord hear it and deliver them out of
[27:57] all their trouble
[27:59] so this verse in Psalms tells us the
[28:02] righteous do have troubles the righteous
[28:04] do have issues and the righteous don't
[28:07] stay dumb the righteous cry the Lord
[28:11] heareth and deliver them of all your
[28:14] troubles Psalm 18:6 says in my
[28:18] distress I called upon the
[28:21] Lord and Cried unto my God he heard my
[28:25] voice out of his Temple and my Cry came
[28:28] before him even unto his
[28:31] ear brother
[28:34] Brown when we get to a place till we
[28:38] think we are the only one that God can
[28:41] use we better call a
[28:44] conference God sent Jesus his son to die
[28:47] for every member of the body of Christ
[28:50] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran
[28:53] catholic whatever they may be they are
[28:55] All God's Children Of Promise all they
[28:58] are going to hear the message if we cool
[29:00] off here we go what are we going to
[29:03] do then we are putting a bad example
[29:06] before
[29:07] them no time for cooling off it is time
[29:12] for warming up and we can't have a
[29:15] warming up till we have a conference an
[29:18] old time Revival that will bring back to
[29:20] Revival fires that will attract
[29:23] attention when Sinners are born into the
[29:26] kingdom of God when men begin to see ill
[29:30] F women ill Fe men Sinners repenting and
[29:35] changing their life going forth making
[29:39] restitutions weeping bringing forth
[29:41] precious sheets the church needs a good
[29:44] case of old time Godly love broadly love
[29:49] we need a conference to hold a
[29:54] conference and speaking about brotherly
[29:56] love the the Bible speaks How could
[30:00] somebody be hungry and you tell them be
[30:05] filled you're giving them the word as
[30:08] opposed to something to eat how come
[30:11] somebody is naked and you're telling
[30:12] them be clothed and you wouldn't seek to
[30:15] get close for them your burden is for no
[30:19] one else if you are selfish your burden
[30:22] and you're thinking just about you and
[30:25] Jesus and we know what was expressed
[30:28] concerning eternal life eternal life is
[30:30] truly living for others eternal life is
[30:33] when you could if somebody ask to go one
[30:35] mile you go two you could go the extra
[30:38] that is what this gospel is about this
[30:41] Gospel of the Kingdom that is what that
[30:44] reflection is about because we are we
[30:46] supposed to reflect the Life of Christ
[30:49] so this Brotherly Love is a serious
[30:52] thing Jesus said by this shall all men
[30:55] know that you're my disciples Jesus said
[30:58] forgive us as we forgive those in
[31:00] teaching them how to pray so it means
[31:03] somewhere along the line that genuine
[31:06] Spirit of forgiveness have to strike the
[31:10] human heart deep not this intellectual
[31:14] flimflam thing you're doing it because
[31:17] um they want me to do it no it has to
[31:20] become something automatic Jesus said
[31:23] father forgive them you didn't curse
[31:24] them they don't know what they're doing
[31:28] know not what they do he did that before
[31:31] he entered into this Resurrection
[31:33] Ministry he did that before he went down
[31:36] into the grave what do we have to do we
[31:40] need charity we need power we need
[31:42] Dynamics and there are steps and there
[31:44] are stages and processes by which we
[31:47] will be positionally placed to really
[31:49] receive this thing Faith here we go this
[31:52] fate rapturing fate fate this fate turn
[31:56] house back to the fate of the father
[31:58] this Fai is based upon
[32:00] forgiveness mix it anyhow shake the vial
[32:03] anyhow cook it
[32:05] anyhow faith is based
[32:08] on forgiveness Faith to be healed Faith

[32:49] conference there was a conference one
[32:50] day in Babylon whe they should bow to
[32:53] the king you said what the Pentecostal
[32:55] church and all the other churches need
[32:57] tonight is to lay aside every weight the
[33:00] sin that do easily beset us that we
[33:02] might run with patience the race that is
[33:05] set before us we need a conference a
[33:07] universal Prem meting for the Church of
[33:10] the Living God to be called together
[33:12] don't think I am angry or beside myself
[33:14] I know what I speak of the need of the
[33:18] church tonight is a conference a prayer
[33:21] meeting a get together a call together
[33:25] ministers break down their middle wall
[33:27] of partition church members that will
[33:29] forget the differences between the
[33:31] denomination and churches church members
[33:33] and ministers all to the horns of the
[33:36] altar with one Accord note how he say
[33:39] this he didn't say church members hold
[33:42] on to the horns of the altar church
[33:44] members and ministers what is he
[33:46] referring to he's referring to Joel
[33:48] chapter 1 when God said let the
[33:52] ministers hold onto the horns of the
[33:54] Altar and say spare thy people and he
[33:56] said hold to the horns the altar with
[33:58] one Accord and pray until the fire of
[34:03] God begins to fall again so that means
[34:07] the fire of God fell it can fall it will
[34:12] fall again but it is also
[34:15] waiting who's going to pray who's going
[34:18] to cry out listen let me read it church
[34:22] members and ministers hold to the H of
[34:25] the altar with one Accord and pray pray
[34:28] until the fire of God begins to fall
[34:30] again God knows the
[34:33] stubbornness the indifference of men is
[34:37] broke up and godly fear and Brotherly
[34:40] Love Takes its place in the human heart
[34:42] then you become
[34:44] salty stubbornness and
[34:47] indifference my then the
