and keep us into being made ready father that's the objective his wife had made herself ready help us prepare us guide us and direct us we thank you for this morning we pray your blessings this evening take me out of the way we pray and ask in jesus name amen amen god bless you if your bible is likely to turn to three portion scripture matthew 15 21-28 philippians chapter 3 verse 12 to 14 and luke 16 16. read in matthew chapter 15 reading from verse 21. then jesus went dense and he parted unto the coast of tyre and sidon and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coast and cried unto him saying have mercy upon me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil and he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she cried after us and he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lord sheep or out of the house of israel then came she and worshipped him saying lord help me and he answered and said it is not me to take the children's bread and the cassette dog she said truth lord yet the dogs in the crumbs which fall from their master's table then jesus answered and said unto her o woman greatest thy faith be it unto thee even another wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour reading from philippians chapter 3 virgin verse 12 paul speaks not as though i have already attained either or already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i'm apprehended of christ jesus brethren i caught not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press to what the mark for the price of the high calling of god in christ jesus on our last scripture is from luke chapter 16 reading verse 16. and it's a familiar scripture the law and the prophets were until john since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man press it into it may god bless his would you may be seated oh blessed be the name of the lord okay so this is our first communion service back in line and we're going to be going forward here just keep putting a layer up on layer upon layers we get things in order okay so a title titled this since that time i have an inspiration pressing into the kingdom that's the inspiration for the brown desperation when you seekest me with all thine heart then i'll hear you the kingdom and you get reference to the last script we read the law and the prophets until john since then the kingdom of god of heaven has been preached and man press into it you don't just stand around and say pick me up by the color lord push me in no you press into it you get desperate between life and death wish i had time of another story i was thinking right now of a woman a girl took a wrong role how she had two new pages and things i said sister she got up and said i believe i'd be all right i said no stay there and then the first thing you know she started praying a little bit and directly she got louder and louder after a while she got desperate she said god save me alcoholic anonymous couldn't cure it nothing else could do it but them big black eyes look at me and the tears dropping off her cheeks she said something happened i said oh yeah yes sir something happened she got desperate so the first baby prayed that couldn't work she was the same person but when she got desperate hallelujah pray god louder something happened to her something have to happen to you praise let's pray in desperation watch for the kingdom of god it will come upon you what is he speaking about watch for the kingdom of god will come upon you he's not about no mental experience or a mental thing in your head is something different something happened to you a power coming to you isn't that right noah's family seen the father a good man was spunking away his sons and daughter-in-laws and so forth was punging away with him bearing the reproach of the world you always have to do that the kingdom of god doesn't come without trials men press into the kingdom it doesn't come by observation but it paid off in saving his life oh blessed beating of the lord what are we looking for friends we here we what are we the real church is not looking for the nomination we are not looking for president we're not looking for a man of the hour sorry we're not looking for that oh praise god hallelujah we're not looking for some genius to rise up but they are looking for the kingdom and a king to come jesus tell them pray thy kingdom come hallelujah praise god and from since that time the kingdom is preached praise god and god that changed from that time all glory to god since that time the kingdom still applies oh glory to god so what we're looking for what you're looking for you're looking for the kingdom of god oh god and it's on earth no it's a spirit it's the mystical body of christ in deer they come out of presbyterian methodist pentecost everything else and they're in this kingdom yeah by the baptism of the holy spirit they get into this kingdom so you want the holy ghost the one god baptize you like you get dipping water you get dip in the spirit and god slam you into the kingdom praise god by the holy ghost itself oh glory to god the kingdom have to be preached all glory to god and every man is pressed away into it you've got to hear something that draws you into it you have to wan you have to want more than the letter of the word you must wonder more more than what you're hearing you must want a reality oh give the lord some praises amen listen to this prophet prophesy and we are looking for a king to come to this kingdom that will set his kingdom here on the earth on his throne the throne of david and he shall reign and rule for a babel have a form of godliness to deny the power thereof what is the kingdom of god we have got to belong to the kingdom before we can ever be subject of the king you see how england have a king now the queen gone they have a kingdom we could have a kingdom united kingdom they have a king and the king the people there are subjects to become subjects of that kingdom and if you belong to the kingdom the king will protect you the king will foresee about you they will care for you the armies of the king belongs to your amen to your protection because you belong to the kingdom oh glory to god you are no longer strangers praise god but you are fellow citizens of the kingdom of god oh gloria god hallelujah you're not coming in like a stranger but with boldness you approach the throne of grace oh glory to god because you belong to this kingdom and god is your father isn't that right so listen before we can ever be subject of the king how many knows that according to amen how do you get in the kingdom the kingdom of god are you ready is the word of god made back in power made power so the word only is not the kingdom yet when the word flick and changed the power and jesus said what jesus said my words are spirit and life so that means they would have power to switch oh glory to god to change over isn't that right no the word now watch first corinthians 4 20 the kingdom of god is his word made power and if you want to put that down you say first corinthians 2 4 4 20 the kingdom of god is god's word made power what is the kingdom of god it's within you the kingdom is in you so what the prophet says the secret is what the word is in the bride what the devil don't know the spirit coming to quicken the word that's in the bride and change that word into power i look how tired your flesh is how where you are you can be all like abraham you could be done like sarah that ain't gonna stop that kingdom from coming upon you he said tarry the city of jerusalem until you be unjude with power from on high he was prophesying that that kingdom was going to come praise god upon them and in them and that kingdom gonna come upon you and in you oh give the lord some praises praise god hallelujah we belong to our kingdom and the kingdom is the word of god made spirit and life in your own life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word and god was won and the word and god is born in his church today making it the headship of the body so when we talk about the headship coming who is a kingdom upon the it amidst a people called the bride of jesus christ we have a glorious thing to look forward to amen watch and when the day of pentecost was fully come at the inauguration of the church there came a song from heaven like a russian mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting that is how the holy spirit come for the first time and that is how it come every time since that time he is god and he changes not we are one a new holy ghost we are one of modern holy ghost we don't know my message explaining holy ghost we want the same holy ghost and god promised that same supernatural power they're going to be in the church as dynamics to the mechanics they're going to run the devils off your children off your wife of your husband of your family and bring back backsliders and praise god raise the dead heal the sick cast out devils we want every gift back in the church we are one nothing short of what god promised in this hour he says watch the kingdom praise god hallelujah praise god that kingdom is the word to the power bring in the making that come to pass every promise that god promised in this last day he said there'll be a super church and that's amen to that there'll be a super race aim into that you're going to get a breakthrough amen to that and the house of hell will have to give way to the name of jesus christ we say amen to that oh glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god praise god oh give the lord some praises my god my god if you see the pump and ceremony the queen going on and they have all this ceremony that trump is blowing and i'm watching some of this thing praise god on the on the internet there and and seeing all the drama i said but oh god this is like old-time days the spirit said die at all israel old time king thing and and all that is is all spirits dressed up in modern clothes oh hallelujah buddy having respect and no longer long live the king queen is long leave the king now and he'll change all the money love the king understanding all of this and we have a kingdom that cannot be moved jesus is our king he said every time we come here become your son a trumpet and honor our king and give him and give him glory and all them angels coming praise god because we belong to the kingdom the angels the lord and camp around him that fear him praise god and today we're gonna have communion which is a sign of victory praise god after abraham conquered them kings he came back and have communion with melchizedek as a sign of victory over the enemy oh praise god and god promised you victory over your enemy every enemy will be under your feet praise god if you don't have them yet they're going to be on their feet praise god praise god just as the storm coming or the storm going or in the middle or the end of the beginning of the storm please god we have a promise the enemy gonna be on our feet praise god you will not be defeated you're gonna get the victory somehow somewhere someday sometime maybe today maybe this service maybe now praise god hallelujah but you have a promise oh as kings and priests you have a promise oh glory to god to be genuine overcomers okay oh let's try our text now the law and the prophets were until john since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man presented things here one the fulfillment of the law the law and the prophets were until john anderson just cap off the old testament already knowing because love was going to be introduced law was fading out and grace was coming law could only identify your sins and your fears and shortcomings but couldn't help you grace was the cure and grace was coming through blood a blood sacrifice a price paid something that you couldn't do so grace always identify itself as something you can't do it's just the grace of god towards you so that's why it's foolishness for this one to judge this one as if they're my power to change this one or see this and see that let's go do the judging let god do the managing let god do deliverance you don't judge nobody and write nobody out who want to cut this one over because one of that is their business but they're not god god is suffering and suffering grace belong to our sovereign one and he can bless you today he can forgive you today cleanse you today he could do miracles with you today by his own decree all glory to god by his own decree he could do it jesus sufferingly choose to walk on the water to get to his disciples he choose not to speak to the storm he chose to speak to them because he wanted to show something to them oh glory to god hallelujah praise god hallelujah understand this god could i let the whole israel walk on the red sea he choose to open up the red sea and they walk on dry land elijah hit the mantle and struck the jordan and he choose for the jordan to open up but jesus choose to walk on the water we could walk on the water we can open the sea he said wait tell them seven thunders after their voices at that group they could shut the heavens they could close the heavens they could do whatever they want to do because there's a word of god coming forth from the mount of god no money go stop it no bishop gonna stop it nobody gonna stop it not trust me no go stop it no sinner will stop it because god spoke it got to come to pass [Applause] glory number one fulfillment of the law number two the kingdom is preached you mean the kingdom that we preach yes the foolishness of the preaching of the cross is it them that perish they call it foolishness it says foolishness but it's the power of god and the third thing to get in you press who press every man someone shout out to every man shout out to every man again every man pressed their way it mean the preacher man the pastor man the apostle man the janitor man the usher man the dick man the elder man the man in the message long time the old man the great hair man the young man the heart of the teenage man or every man press press oh glory to god you can't sit and stay pressed when you say amen you're starting to press when you raise your hands it's not in the press when you're sitting like a dead lock like some sleeping synth praise god hallelujah praise god amen amen don't be like we'll sleep inside here you know we're going to wake you up oh glory to god hallelujah how much are dead people are talking to you i ain't talking about nobody outside i can't see no dead person outside i've seen the dead inside out here oh glory to god in the ditch i had a voice oh glory to god and come alive may god send fire in your seat fire your pants find your skirt find your hands [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] glory to god glory to god hallelujah glory to god hallelujah [Applause] paul wasn't claiming to have attained he said not as though i have attained or am i already perfect there is always something set that you could go after anytime you sit back relax you know you now this year anytime you sit back relax you know you are backslidden you can come to church and don't miss one service in your backseat as ever because you're not pressing not a press in prayer the other person prays what time you don't feel to praise god by your feelings your feelings are not walking with you your feeling on faith is two different things you have feeling the praise god but your faith have to praise god [Applause] what's the first thing jesus tell them be of good chair they oh it is that nightshare i am here be of good chair all things work together for good even them storms they're gonna work for your god even them battles they're going to work for your good family troubles go work for your good praise god when the god said no weapon form against you could prosper god said that that guy lie praise god who look like they prosper and let them prosper who in front let them go front who ahead let me go ahead well a bigger house a bigger car let them go ahead that i'm going to do with you nobody could take your blessing your inheritance is reserved oh give the lord i saw you have fight dog no man for nothing oh get ahold my god help me jesus oh god we're pumping this evening oh we're having a short quick message hallelujah glory to the lord will i miss you hallelujah hallelujah glory maybe she said god called abraham bless abraham abraham tagalog associates when the blessing poured upon abraham it fallen luck and hurts men and family everything else that was troubling because he called trouble afterwards he had a good heart but it caused trouble when it come to decision making and god and abram recognizes confusion among the tribes and churches and and and different companies and so on he said not choose now he know god called him but he said not to choose but look he's going to say tuesday i get bright i'd light up like a bulb and that's when he started searching his eyes not faith that's eyes at work now 20 20 vision seeing trees nice coconut trees palm trees pitching towards sodom he said i take him down there gosh with that looking foot i'm too bad got him stand on desert ground and as he walked to go to his mission god said abraham look east west not turns out i couldn't talk this to you you know you say with them around there when they let me when not separate themselves he said nothing to tell you all is yours all is yours [Applause] you think abraham said uh email to a lot and say all his minds you know god tell me so to call from fusion he can't say that he he alone had that revelation all is his own including love so when lord was in captivity now the angel comes and says shall i hear from abraham because i'm about to change his season i'm going to introduce judgment in this message about to release judgment across the world they sit down long enough they don't know what my power is what my thigh is what my anointing they don't know what that is i'm a common i'm about to start something now i'm just revealing to you what i'm about to do because the angels are beginning to move and that that angel is spiritual death no not physical death so much you know it's a spiritual death people hear it and can't move people hearing and can react people hear and interact people hearing and they're just hearing and it is hearing and they're dead i read something from my wife but obama's asking people to bowl their head and close their eyes there's a man in the audience he said boy then close your eyes you want to close the eyes that man had said he come to hypnotize brother brown make him back like a dog and then bro expose him and he buying him and so on like that and the man fell off the balcony and get crippled the wife comfortable around he said brother he's a nice man he's a preacher he said he's a preacher he didn't want to close his eyes he didn't want to bore his head in respects one says he says i can't help him listen to his words he said he crossed the line who crossed the line a preacher crossed the line and there is nothing the prophet could have done for him everybody has bow there and close their eyes but you look in tell the boy could you body and close the eyes you're looking he's a preacher he crossed the line god help us it's two things i wanted to have in this church as foundations two things just two not twenty two just two respects and broadly love sins and countries skywalker i give respect because i have respect [Applause] i don't respect because somebody is dis or some other positional promise i respect the mailman i respect this one i respect you treat everybody with respect i treat my sons with respect [Applause] i treat people with respect i have respect i give it because that's what i should do i got a story about a man a man a builder and he built housing for this man working for him for long hours and everything else and the contract was coming to a close and he had one more house he wanted to build he said why you build that house and a man built with all the wretched material all the old material a bit terrible and everything else and a man saying oh you work for me so long and hard i wanted to bless you i think you see that last officer bill die yours how old am i supposed to feel the last house instead of doing his best using the best material he used the cheapest the thingy he built for any man say i really want to bless you you know you see that that's what it is i don't want to tell you no but no i'll tell you that is yours that why sometimes you have to give out your words with kindness because you might eat it back watch your mouth watch your tongue you hear me watch your mouth and tongue be careful what you see and how you see it and to whom you see it [Applause] but there was a something else balaam says i cannot help him he crossed the line i wonder if people especially believe that once the sister went through suffering and when she was dying she tell me she's about here in all that pain i getting is the things i see about ministers so maybe god revealed something that i don't know but she told me that that's not that i see in that she told me that she said she suffer because of things she said about ministers so watch brethren he said he said this one thing i do i reach and fought to those things which are before i press towards the mark oh let me just stop in here brahma said god demands for his servants demands requesting respect he demands respect demands respect oh glory to god if a man make himself a minister well does he make himself that basically when god make a man a minister that's a different thing altogether don't touch that man pray for the man because god can straighten out his men he said not moses he said no no he said now this one and that one he straightened out every son that committed god that will be tested and tried but you don't disrespect you don't do that you don't disrespect okay so this woman now watch what is now now we're coming down hold me along with you this woman description be read she came a daughter next with the devil all right she's a grecian woman a sign official woman we call him and so on she came and worshiped jesus says not take the ticket and breadcrusted the dog she said truth lord brother brown listen to what he pulled from this and this is important perseverance is what he pulled from this i think it means to persevere or to be persistent in something that you're doing in making a goal or something you can't be perseverant and you have nothing set the only way this world comes to play is when you have a goal when you have a target or when you have a mark you say paul said i pressed towards a mark then you could have a perseverance when you have a no goals you go nowhere if you have no work you're not looking for no walk no job you wake up in the morning you have nowhere to go your couple's every year you're persevering out your bed but you're possibly nowhere when you go in my opinion you're going nowhere bro i met a man like that you know see where you're going nowhere you bring him to eat inside the house where are you looking for no nothing day by day he said how people are you have to have a goal and a goal is to have a time in it you know like like like tyrion is here jerusalem until you'll be endured with power from our hearts stay there until i have a time when the day of pentecost was fully come have i ever deadlined it did you ever open that goal you know well you know i go study and two years pass you go study five years past 10 years till you still go study you go study afterwards when you can't study at all but the point about it you have to have a goal in order to persevere for example what we see should make a church that will make a revival that's a goal on wednesday night if you heard the tape on friday night from from usa i preach reward and goals reward is what you get for what you've accomplished but goals is what you could do you could change your mind you could study uh to be a doctor to be a lawyer they could change careers that's what you doing and set as a goal you can go and get subjects advance and get a master's degree whatever you want but i'm saying as a church we could make a church that would make a revival that's a goal and the path that you play to fulfill that goal that's the part that you see that you have to do not just watch but do praise god that your works will follow your faith the one we preach in the preaching giving your faith then what do you do about what you hear and you said there's a goal and they set up the goal you persevere here's why here's why if you're making a goal or something you have to be persistent men throughout all ages that had faith in what they were trying to achieve had to be persistent especially if you're doing something right because you're going to meet an opposition the devil girl are you oh good they take an illness satan chain your own take it take it take it take it you taking what is yours you know and it's the opposition so anytime you're going in the right path and the right channel contrary wins storms that you didn't and that's that isn't the bible says the winds were contrary when jesus rebuked their soul and the bible is kind of the winds were contrary the bible is not peter's sin and then brothers the whole sinful bunch in that boat died like some sister or some brother saying that the other side you know the reason that they're going to that storm is because wickedness and i prophesy they go sink god judging them yeah men playing prophet and also and the bible's places the wins will contrary but sometimes wind just blows contrary it's not because you're sin because god previous sin and in your mind the devil you have a real whoop in your mind because you're going back to all what you do i know sister she's trying to scratch up every tick everything she makes wrong everything and poor soul she goes back and says stop it stop it stop it stop it stop it stop it she going back like this one and making one right going back this one and i brought her call me and tell me she said they tell her sister if you really come at me one more time because she finds she'll make this right she's going right the devil gives you a real trip but it makes no sense you want to put back this and i think i take the pen and show up on my pen and you want to buy pens now to bring back your pen and and all kind of you know things that it's not supposed to be don't let the devil product that's why the blood flow that's what the atonement is for that's what the intercessor is there for to play your case and he has done that and free you by his blood and free you by his power isn't that right all right let's continue men throughout all ages that has faith in what they're trying to achieve has always been perseverant all long to history of time men has never done anything has been men trying to achieve something is to have faith in what they're trying to achieve and when they do it they are perseverant perseverance is to make a goal and be persistent i like that word it's a very 50 to the church of this day or it should be that the church should be perseverant amen praise god and webster day webster says to be persistent in making a goal to do something and men to the ages that ever try to achieve something has been persistent and man in order to be resistant and my quoted again is to know what you are after what you are after as the pastor of this church i have to know what i want to see in this church and what i'm fighting for in this church if i want to buy a pond if i want to see people sleep inside of you i give a sleepy sermon you know what i'm saying then where are your dog tired out and you feel i have been in the woods here are you and all other stuff no we want you on fire we want your heart we don't want your lukewarm we don't want your coal we don't want your loafing on somebody else's prayer your testimony is pray for me pray for me pray for me who are you praise god why don't you pray for somebody else why everybody must be praying for you why don't you get on and pray on your knees and say god have mercy put that spirit of prayer and supplication and charge up your soul and charge up somebody else [Music] glory to god and just don't loaf on the grace of god because jacob grace joseph what perfection and that is what you call untrue oh glory to god so watch if you do not know and you are not certain of your standing and when you thoroughly understand what it is what you are after and are satisfied that you're going to do it then you can be persistent and holding on my god and my wife was talking about sometime i think what's the day or this morning or yesterday she has she was reflecting on things that she said we have never been the type waiting for things to happen never be any time waiting hoping no we are action i like this with action i like i'm an action person praise god i you know people just talk and talk and talk no action behind them just talking the talkers not doers better you do and fail than just talk and do nothing try and fail and fail to try oh glory to god try and stumble try and fall but not never try at all oh glory to god i pushed my way praise god i wanted to start back wednesday service and i started back i wanted to get back to coming here we started back we're going to start back everything we have a couple bible study on tuesday we're going to start it back we're going to start backing you meters we have to push of course we have to push oh glory is a fight you don't think we don't be tired and weary we will get tired too we just get wary also but we have to push and press praise god because we only could do what we can do when we can do it on the our comment we cannot do anything for you but while we could do what we can do we want to do it praise god hallelujah i like what isaac brought this morning jesus knew he will not always be with them so they had to build faith muscles so they're looking for him to speak to the storm oh god he's term and i guess when peter started to think so hey where the body storm like if jesus scene he stopped stone no they won't just do something you know stop master yes he storm jesus is talking to them peter got the revelation he said that you bit me to come if you ready i am i like that hallelujah i am here if you are the i am did me to come he said come on no if jesus didn't believe him to come he wasn't going you know because that is the boy cena does he i am there no he waiting for a signal you know here by faith are going out no you were you're mad man you have no faith to go out you gotta wait for the call don't step on the bottom praise god praise god praise god hallelujah hallelujah and zach was telling me but the lyndon was telling them he was on a boat already in a storm and he could relate to what was being preached he said the fear that you have is a step on the boat just to get off that body fear he said can you see your hands praise god i was just captain or something praise god the kind you said see your hands praise god the fiercest and peter said if they're you beat me to step out and he stepped up begin to walk take the devil like that the devil boy you know he gets some demons to whip up some some heavy things you know man he was here when he went and all you know not only seen you know then black clouds drop down one time and instead of pizza and peter was watching jesus and walking watching the other oh worse than them black hole say listen look me here look me here and he doesn't look so like that he's out of the sink jesus grab him like how we grab you like how he grabbed me why don't we walk in on the water oh glory to god right now we're walking in hell we're walking through hell because hell is on the earth and we're still alive and kicking oh give the lord a shout you're above six feet down hallelujah you're above ground today let's let's see if we could hit this here now all right hallelujah okay this is what i love here she was a greek she wasn't in the belief of that she was at a different race of people you know so this is a different race she had no jew she had believe torah and moses and things she not into that all she she had two things but a lot of vexed with the devil helped me that's the only thing we're talking about now i had some favor i actually preached bible to me quotes to me i want to hear exaltation my daughter rex with the devil and them scribe and pharisees they can't help this this above their pay grade this above their qualifications and i recognize you have the qualifications to handle this all right listen to this you know but is that preacher's morning fate let's find a way listen to this faith finds a source that others don't see faith finds a source that others don't see and her fade from that source and she knew that by hearing if she got there what was going to happen you might be weak in your arm of faith maybe you can just cut off justification maybe you can just cut out the jojo church but good strong arm of faith can cut you to the baptism of the holy ghost so isaac is correct in talking about different levels of faith oh praise god people have levels of faith oh glory to god some levels of faith is only to be in a certain church and they reach they have arrived but you don't want that you want the kingdom that god promised to come to come upon you oh glory to god hallelujah watch this she had many hindrances and if you happen to go on thinking about it but her fate didn't have any oh glory to god then i was calling a dog that just stopped her she ain't moving whatever i call her she's not moving her fate was not disappointed and if you're fake don't have any hindrances it is different she had but her faith had no hindrances faith does no no hindrance so when people claim their faith and boldly stump me and this affect me what faith is that go back again reboot you have to come again die enough of it faith doesn't back down faith knows no hindrance faith looks for a way faith knows there got to be a way oh glory to god when joshua on the face jericho was you know there had to be a way to take that because god said that is given to thee but that's not the problem or given to me you know it's how to take it what give the lord some praises oh glory to god glory to god glory to god hallelujah praise god faith there's no no hindrance faith only or one thing it's goal that is all maybe you might have said now wait a minute you are greek you are no business you're a methodist you ought not to be goated pentecostal but that didn't hinder her she was persistent she was very perseverant another group come up and say but wait a minute darling you know what the days america is past but that didn't stop her why fate had took a hole and she was still persistent she was going anyhow another group said some woman of a church might have come around said dear do you know what if you go across there your husband is a deacon over there he would leave you there by the force in the family but faith had caught a hold of something the word of god and she went anyhow she was perseverant and she wasn't going to take no for an answer fate got a hold of something so the disciples had the begs that jesus said went away because she bought in them she's troubling them she's harassing them she's nagging them she ain't taking no financer a daughter vex for the devil is not right praise god praise god praise god and finally she arrives and watch disappointments god tries every child that comes to him and when she got to jesus she taught it all over you know and when she got to jesus he quickly turned her with great disappointment i am not sent to your race now after she had passed through every one of those barricades and she hurdled every one of them by her fate she got to this jesus nazareth and as soon as she got there went to crying after him he ignored her he walked away and then finally he turned around with a rebuke and said i'm not sent to your race i am sent to the lord sheep of the house of israel what a rebuke hallelujah praise god praise god if that had been some pentecostal people they have said well the way he feels about it and what he said another thing he said erased was a bunch of dogs the very audacity would not have shook up pentecostal he said bless god i go to assemblies i'll go over so and so on he called her dog i was not sent to a race of people i was only sent to the jews i'm not sent to you and besides your people is like a bunch of dogs but she's still held on she i i like that is i feel religious i like that no matter what obstacle was she still held on to that fate and that is when you got a hold of that brother she held on no matter what anybody else said even jesus himself said i am not center race you're a bunch of dogs i won't take the terrorist but i'm sure to you dogs but she's still there on she wasn't a hotbed plant she wasn't a hybrid modern crop today oh praise god hallelujah notice she admitted what jesus was the truth she said i am a dog amen faith listens oh glory to god faith doesn't argue give the lord some praises faith listens he said what jesus was the word and if you've got genuine faith faith will always admit the word was right fear will never argue against the word it will stay with the word the way the word says the faith admits is true she says truth she admitted he was right and faith will do it isn't that right she was called the dog god of mercy this sinful generation she said truth lord i'm not worthy i'm a greek i'm not of your people i'm a dog i'm not coming for you to bury me but the lay hands on me oh glory they've got truth lord i'm not worthy i am a dog you call me one but the dogs now if jesus didn't call our dog she couldn't see what the dog would see the dog give her an opening for faith to find a channel do you see that that dog that appeared to be a negative become a positive for her [Applause] because all of a sudden when she said truth lord i'm a dog she see it like isaac said this morning come and see with me she see it she see the dog and crumbs and as she see it she said lord even the dog get crumbs are willing to stay here and get crumbs oh god oh god oh god i'm willing i'm willing not willing to willing i'm willing to willing not willing not willing it's a good thing you're calling me a dog hey it's a good thing it's a good thing it's a good thing that's the best thing you could have called me calling her a dog what's the best thing because that got her the daughter's deliverance what did you say watch lord i'm wanting only crumbs remember she had never seen a miracle she was a greek she had heard there was a miracle but jesus performed miracles she knowed if he could perform miracles on one person god could create they could do it watch what she said to jesus and what what what did jesus say he said for this saiyan are you ready she had the right approach to god's gift you've got to approach it right and when you are sitting out there when you're in church when you are the altar wherever you are you got to approach god in the right manner faith always admits the truth oh my hallelujah oh glory to god thank you jesus oh i'm going to finish here do you see it now the kingdom is preached and every man pressed away but ram says whoa we see david a rejected king turn off is shown by his brethren his own son sit upon monk to love others how perfect the son of god 800 years later rejected king among his people what was it what was it god reflected himself in those prophets reflecting christ and they came one which was the perfection of god it was good among us and since that time he has reflected himself in his church this side of calvary now you see what we are all trying to get to this dwelling place there is some statue perfect the tabernacle of the living god we notice here first we have faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness bloody love but love then add love now peter here is outlining something here for us to get there and i want to say this that there are some people who have a portion of this virtue knowledge patience and so forth that don't even profess to be christians he said no watch that won't do it there are people have a portion of this that don't even pretend to be christian but that won't do it it's like a black bird trying to put on peacock feathers you see watch god's first decision was the pardon man was the truth of shed blood so it's only through the blood we have access to this fate and with your knowledge this year is god's kingdom this here is what you have to press into your president of faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance you have no time with gossip and minding up your business and jealousy and envy your life and your thoughts and your actions is trying to line up with that that is what god wants you are birthed into this he said you are bitten into that in other words seven birds seven deaths and you're coming right up the brotherly kindness when that had to be displayed not talked about displayed whether to your husband to your children to a family to your boss to your neighbor to whoever the next believer the next brother the next sister it has to be displayed there are people still mining grass like if they're mining chicken and fall or whatever it is they mine in grudge they letting the grudge grow they're letting the envy grow they're letting their jealousy grow and when you want your faith to grow and faith is based upon forgiveness and you want to get to that spot where you have the faith that worked by love but to get the faith to walk by love you have to come up into love that love could be the source and the power source to activate that faith oh blessed be the name of the lord and when you start to work with love it will start to work in your family and your actions and your behavior but i'm talking about how you're going to pray with the token over your loved ones and family if your son don't want you to pray for them you can pray for them while they're sleeping and all but you're praying with love you're paying with the burden you're paying with a concern you're praying with compassion you want a breakthrough for them you want to hit heaven praise god and knock heaven's door on their behalf oh give the lord some praise as i'm done mission coming please oh glory to god hallelujah praise god since that time god had changed it since that time the kingdom is preaching every age the kingdom must preach all glory every part of the preacher kingdom because they had to get into the kingdom by the word of the awar and god released the man anointed the oxonoid and the eagle anointed the land anointed to come back the forces of the devil and god really that eagle anointed his last day to combat the force of the enemy and here we are when the enemy come like a flood uh the spirit of god not looter not wrestling but the dynamic itself come to raise a standard oh glory to god god want to strengthen god wants us strengthening our faith god wants us to go to the next level that's what that brother isaac preached tonight this morning your faith have to grow your faith can grow your faith can ripen your faith can increase oh let us stand and give god some praises father we bless you today and i pray that you would anoint your people bless them and bless this communion service in jesus name i ask it amen and amen praise the lord blessed be the name of the lord amen hallelujah let's just give him praise glory to god thank you jesus oh hallelujah give him glory amen and amen hallelujah glory to god thank you jesus glory to god oh he touched me oh he touched me [Music] [Music] something happened and now i know he touched me and he made [Music] oh he touched me oh he touched me [Music] and i know something happened and now i know [Music] he touched me [Music] and one more time oh he touched me oh he touched me [Music] oh and i know [Music] oh [Music] [Music] the joy that floods my soul
