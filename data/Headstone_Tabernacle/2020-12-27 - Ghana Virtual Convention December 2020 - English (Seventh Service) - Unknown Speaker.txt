was able to visit your country and a few churches together with brother andreas mai at the beginning of this year 2020. but andreas also sends you all his warmest greetings we started our journey in accra went to kumasi and to tamale we were very happy to meet brothers and sisters in the lord in your country to have fellowship with them and we could worship the lord together we have experienced unforgettable days with you and are still drawing on your hospitality may god bless you richly for this yes the time we live in is a special time everything is heading towards a final climax satan is building his eden unstoppable as it was in the days of sodom so it is here on earth today we need much grace to hold on to what we have already received and what we possess and we need a lot of grace that the bride may come into her stature of christ because there's a final verb for the bride that only the bride will have she is the final voice to the final age hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 speaks of the cloud of witnesses around us yes they cannot be completed without us and we cannot stand without them here on earth as the body of jesus christ they are a part of christ they are a part of us since we too are part of christ it is restoration time the bride will stand on this earth in her full stature the promises for this day are so unique never before has there been a group of people on earth who have been given this kind of promises listen what the prophet said of this time and they could not be made perfect without us and now the entire holy spirit visits the church making god in human flesh as he did before sodom the burning there which was a type then abraham he appeared to him and all the things that he hasn't done down through the ages in the church ages he is now doing back to the world because the messages and the messages and the messages has to wind up in the entire world and in the last days the seven seals being open was to pick up every struggle that's been left off in it and make the whole thing in one great big body of the bride that them who lived back there was not perfect until this church be perfected the bright group in the last days to bring them in and all together be taken up see the bright group has to be perfected to bring them in think about brothers and sisters they are awaiting of us that we will come into our position they depend on us what a responsibility for the bride today adoption time placing of suns the next quote i like to share with you is so deep for me i really cannot explain how how it will be but something on my inside is pulling while i'm reading this quote of the prophet i am so glad to see him personify himself right among us i'm longing to see this manifested in our day we live on the edge when our eyes are opened listen what the prophet said but i'm not him but he is standing among you and his shoes i am not worthy to lose when he comes makes his self known and today he is standing among us in the person of the holy ghost manifesting himself more and more coming into his church making himself known because him and the bride and the group will be the same making himself known and one day you will see that the one that you feel in your heart and see his identification will become personalized before you then you and he are one you are united by the word and the word was in the beginning will go back to the beginning which is god and that day you will know that i am in the father father the father in me i in you and you in me hallelujah we are here hallelujah i am so glad to see him personifying himself right among us and see what he promised for the world not what somebody's emotions singing and jumping and dancing but by his word amen he is making himself known oh hallelujah are we in a real expectation to see this promise manifested brothers and sisters i appreciate you holding such a virtual conference there in ghana to strengthen the bride of christ so that she can come together in one accord and in harmony we know that this goes along with the placing of sons the adoption time which is a noble topic for this conference this is a topic that if the lord tarries will certainly carry us through the coming year 2021 my most fervent wish is that the bride of christ will come closer denominational walls will be torn down doctrines will give way to the revealed word of this hour and the perfect love of god will take shape in our hearts god bless you all mightily there in ghana i am joined to you with my heart i want to close while we listen to a quote from the prophet what's the next verse having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof no spiritual discernment when you got spiritual discernment and the holy ghost is upon you you have spiritual discernment it says amen to every promise of god paul said those days would be we got it it's here it's on us and we look and see it we hear it from everywhere what do we do it ought to draw us together the bible said assimin ourselves together and that's the more when you see that day approaching it ought to be one revival after another in bonfires of god's glory built in every church and every place a great coming together for all the churches with one heart and one accord symbol themselves together forget their man-made theology and crown to god our spiritual power and spiritual discernment that's the hour we need amen god bless you all praise god amen i appreciate that the greeting this morning put your hands together god bless you appreciate it hallelujah hallelujah what a

ministries and the blessings that they have been to us down through the years and thank you for your labor especially in this convention god richly bless you so today um i would like to speak on the topic preparation for the manifestation of the sons of god and that's a topic that we all know about and brother solomon's gathers together in this manifestation of the sons of god revival services and um i believe brother solomon's inspiration is the placing of sons adoption time and adult and at adoption time that's when sons of god are going to be manifested born sons true sons failed sons placed sons adopted sons are going to be manifested and they split to the world what the eternal life that they have in jesus christ means like it was said of christ uh um we beheld this life the life as of the the glory as of the only begotten son of god and this bride when she's anointed as police sons adopted sons that same eternal life which was with the father which was in the sun and which has been packed passed on to this bride him in the form of a word message will be manifested one more time and one more time the war will see and hear direct from god as he did on the day of pentecost so my title preparation for the manifestation of the sons of god um i got a few corner scriptures genesis 1 verses 26 to 28 and genesis 2 and verse 7. also romans 8 verses 18 through 23 now romans 8 verse 19 says are are written these wise for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god i'm sorry you may be seated if i haven't as you sit down already and if you're not seen already you may please be seated god bless you so romans 8 19 says for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god now only two people in the bible were categorically stated to be sons of god now the rest of us we know where else is it was only spoken in their genealogy uh a description of them spoken of as sons of god the lord jesus christ and adam who was said of adam the son of god jesus christ the son of god but the rest of us become sons of god of course we always were sons we was a son of god like adam way back before definition of the world we were all veiled in the son of god jesus christ but when we started being displayed and manifested on the face of the earth only two sons the original son of god god's example sits on jesus christ was one and then adam was the other one that was called the son of god the rest of us become sons of god so here is this uh uh our um topic here before us the manifestation of the sons of god and we know we are sons of god the bible says beloved now are we the sons of god it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him so we know we are sons of god and it's for a reason that only adam and jesus christ were expressly stated to be sons of god because way back before the foundation of the world got in his plans when he was in labor pains bringing forth sons god had this plan which you know the story had the plan his purpose his desire to have sons on the face of the earth who will manifest his eternal life who will show forth his life and his life is eternal life show for his life and that life will display god that life will show for god in this world here on this earth and and and that life will be a display an expression of god who god is his being how he lives how he behaves himself his attributes characteristics to to rule to reign to to to to to to do things on visas that only god can do and god determine in his wisdom that adam will be the first one and the original plan was that after adam all the sons will come forth and adam will speak these sons from the from the uh uh uh from the from the ground from the earth uh just like adam himself was made from god's hands right straight from the from from from the from the earth all the suns were to come forth and adam was gonna was supposed to speak them but before he could get to that spot he fell by sin and god had to move on with the program god god had to have an alternate program which is all in god's plan because all of these things were done by god to bring forth his attributes and his characteristics who he is expressing all his characteristics so nothing out of cater but god's original plan adam couldn't wait adam couldn't wait to fulfill that and so god had to change the plan so once adam came as the son of god none of us who are also sons of god like adam could come like he did and the only one that could come after that was jesus christ our lord himself the example sits on god himself god himself was the only one who could come exactly the son of god on the face of the earth because he wasn't born like the provided way that adam sin made us ought to come by he was born right straight by the spirit of the living god exactly how we would have been born if adam had not fallen by sin so here we are the bible says romans 8 every creature all creation is longing and waiting and looking for the manifestation of the sons of god why because all creation all nature was created when was created this earth was created so sons of god will inhabit it and express god on the face of this earth that was the program that was the plan and adam came here as the son of god the original son and god gave him absolute total control and power and authority over this earth and adam had this at the right under control he ruled and bestowed the earth like a son of god with full power and authority on the face of the earth for god nature adam was the master of the earth nature obedience the wings obeyed him this the the the elements obeyed him and adam could do anything he wanted the face of this idea and nature was happy because that's the purpose nature was created for but once adam singh and fell he lost all control over nature once adam seen and fell he became corrupted and with him all nature fell and all nature was corrupted and so nature since that time has not been able to fulfill the purpose god created for and that's why all nature has grown in crying longing to go back to that purpose for which god created amen in the first place and nature has been subject to made subject to vanity like adam since adam fell nature has been all nature all creature has been subject to vanity corruption all these natural disasters climate change nature is all the earthquakes and the tornadoes and the storms all nature is groaning crying longing to go back to that place to where it will fulfill its purpose that god created it for and that's why nature itself is groaning crying longing for the sons of god to be manifested because nature knows and believes that promise the sons of god are coming back nature knows there's a promise hanging over sons of god that they're going to come back to where adam was before he fell by sin nature knows that so all nature all creature is longing groaning for that time because nature knows once adam is restored back adam once adam's race is restored back to the original place it's rightful place as blessed sons adopted sons manifested sons nature knows that it also will be restored back and delivered into the glorious liberty of the sons of god so all nature is growing and we ourselves grown within ourselves longing for that adoption time and so we know there's promise a manifestation of the sons of god we know there's promise a time when god's sons are gonna be restored back to their rightful condition like nature we we ourselves are groaning like nature groaning to go back into our ought to be conditioned and like brother branham told us that's why when we get sick we want to get well because we know of a place where we did not have to be sick in the first instance all nature is groaning and so we look forward with anticipation for this time the manifestion of the sons of god amen but more important than than than looking for the time more important than the event itself is to know how to get there how to get to that event because it's not about knowing about the event it's knowing about how to make sure when that event happens you and i will be a part of that event and that's why we're gonna know how to prepare for the event we're gonna know how to prepare to make sure that we are part of that event when the event actually does happen revelation 9 7 says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready so we want to make ourselves ready so that when this manifestation of the students have gone this adoption time strikes you and i will be a partaker of it brother banham says the church is going to be there but it's up to me it's up to you to make sure we are going to be there by the grace of god we know we are predestinated from before definition of the world and we know we are going to be there and all that we need to do to be there the holy spirit himself in us will work his way out amen and make sure that we are there by the grace of almighty god because we are predestinated to take that glorious stand so preparing to be there for the manifestation of the sons of god preparation for the manifestion of the sons of god now the strength of preparation is very basic and very fundamental to human existence it's a is a human commonality that we just have to prepare we do it without even thinking preparation is part and parcel of the human experience god made it that way god built it into human existence that we prepare before if events though that have to happen we prepare before we before before we do anything we prepare to get results that we want to we could prepare poorly we could prepare very well but the results we get depends uh the results we get depend on the quality of the preparation that we bring forward to to the effort after the effort on hand so if i have an event coming up next year i start preparing for that event so preparation is a very very fundamental uh and basic part of the human experience and preparation is god's way that he has whipped into life to make sure that we get life right to make sure that we get uh ready for the event so that we will go through life not just happening things just happening to us and we are reacting to things but we are we prepare for uh uh uh the the events of life and this whole life in itself our very whole existence on the face of the earth is a preparation we are here in preparation for when we live here so life is about a preparation preparation is basic and it's a very very fundamental our principle in human existence and preparation time it's time to get ready let us be glad and rejoice for his bride has made herself ready she has spent a period of time to get herself ready so that she'll be there at the wedding supper in the skies and it's her job to get herself ready amen so preparation time is getting ready time uh brother branham said on the message um revelation chapter five part two now he's preparing for the opening of those seven seals of redemption see that's what the fifth chapter is that's the reason i cannot read it and then just take it from there and talk on it and give the other parts of the scripture is because it isn't vast by vast something that's happening it's preparing for something to happen in other words before nothing happens there's a preparation before the thing happens before it can happen there's got to be a preparation is preparing for something to happen it continues and if you get the preparation right then you are ready for it then and that's the way it is by faith or with anything else amen so if you get the preparation right we'll get the main event exactly right so we thank god to understand these things we thank god for a prophet who uh uh uh um reveal these things to us who taught us these things now talking about preparation if you prepare rightly like i just read to you brother banham said you are ready for the main event then and we're talking about a preparation for the manifestation of the sons of god so we want to get the manifestation right we want to be sure that we are there we are there we are part of the manifestation of the sunset we are part of those sons that are going to be complacent born sons adopted sons manifested sons but here while we are working towards that we gotta get the preparation right and brother banham said of preparation to get the preparation right three things here number one you've got to know and have a very very uh uh uh clear understanding of of what what it is you are preparing for number one a clear-cut understanding very clear vision of what it is you are preparing for number two a clear vision and understand of the steps that you need to take to get to what you are preparing for to receive and get what you are preparing for it's not enough to know what you are preparing for we are praying for the manifestation of the sons of god number two how do we get to this manifestation of so what are the steps involved in getting us to this manifestation of the sons of god and number three simple just carry out the steps get in action get in action with the steps to become a manifestation of god amen and that's exactly what god did god always prepares there's nothing that he does but what he prepares because the preparation is the principle that comes straight from the mind of god himself because god knows that life got with preparation into life so that we can get the best out of life we can get the best out of life here and the best out of life after here when we prepare and prepare very rightly and brother branham he told us that god always prepares amen always prepare whatever god does he prepares for it on a message uh from 1953 11 11 53 preparation brother branham said now preparation god before he does anything he always prepares for it as he spoke in the bible before we go over to fight a war like jesus said no man's going to be at the house he sits down and says whether he has enough to do it any man going to fight a war he sits down to see whether he has enough to fight the war or he will start the war and find that he did not have what he took so that's all about preparation quote before we go to fight a war first we have to prepare for that war if you are going to get married you prepare for that time and you have preparations and before you come to church you made preparations the ambulance to bring you or your loved ones to bring you or you had to get a certain amount of money ready before you could come it's all preparations and god always prepares and god always prepares the people for the events that's just about to happen that's who god is so god this manifestation of the sons of god is not something that's catching him unawares god always prepares so god was preparing for this manifestation of the sons of god from way back before the foundations of the world and as a matter of fact god before the definition of the world which you know the story we all know the story because we ha we we have been privileged to have heard the voice of god spoke to us through a prophet a 20th century prophet a vindicated prophet who had the word of the lord and brother branham taught us and let us understand that way back before the foundation of the world way back before the beginning way back before there was the stars the the moon the sun the milky way the galaxies the universe god dwelt all alone by himself and god dwelt in light that no man could approach where god was all alone by himself and he was known at that time not as god but as elohim ela elohim the self-existent one the one who existed all by himself and in him he had thought he had he had he had he had thoughts about what he would like to do in this future coming because he was from the deathless endless eternity past no man can get there he dwelled in light unapproachable light where he dwelt all by himself he was spirit no certain form but spirit uncovered all space and time and on the back part of his spirit mind he had these thoughts on him in in him and all of these thoughts the bomb call it you put it all together and call it a 3-4 mystery and the sum total of all of this year was that god elohim wanted to have sons who would represent him sons who will display him sons who will be in fellowship with him sons who will express his characteristics to the world that he was gonna form in the future sons who will be an expression of his being of his character of his being his nature how he lives how he talks how he behaves himself how he thinks all about him he wanted these ones to be an expression of himself a manifestation of god and that's where the origins of the manifestation of the sons of god come from right straight from the back parts of elohim's mind and so elohim began to plan how he was going to make this come to pass and the first thing he did in this procedure in this planning stage this preparation stage was he had all these great plans on his mind how he was gonna have these sons and he was gonna have that in the world rule the earth on his behalf express him have fellowship with him unfortunately he did he wanted this journey to be on the earth first needed he formed himself change his mask because he wanted to be in his image and his thought on his mouth was let us make man in our image after our likeness but elohim was spirit no certain image a spirit don't have any certain image you can make an image of a spirit he covered all space and time so first thing elohim did was to get himself into a form of which he could now form an image of so elohim formed himself and poured all of these thoughts and desires into a body he formed himself into it but it is a spirit but it's a body that had a form now a spirit body elohim covered all space and all time but he had this the the he formed himself into a body and that was the beginning of the creation of god elohim himself became his own creation and he formed himself into what he called the spirit body which was called the logos which is the word which is the theophany and in this theophany which is elohim elohim is spirit the logos is the word and elohim and the and the logos are one and the same thing the spirit is the word and the word is the spirit elohim coming right down to where he could form man to live on the face of the earth because brother branham said he began to form himself towards flesh in a theophany and when elohim uh uh uh formed himself into ethiopia a spirit body then he could make an image of this theophany you could make an image of this theophany body which is the word which is the the the logos and off of this logos world he formed an image now and that's how it was become the image of the world the image of the theophany the image of the logos and off of that he formed adam in his own image after his likeness on the face of the earth and there was adam an image of the world an image of the theophany an image of elohim it wasn't elohim it wasn't the theophany it wasn't the word but it was an image of the theophany it was an image of the world it was a word image elohim prepared and formed himself into ethiopia and then formed off of that theophany an image of himself and that became the spirit man in genesis 1 26 but he said there was no man to till the soil this was a spirit man who are the authority god sons on the face of the earth he was a spirit man but the son that god is looking for must be expressed manifested on the face of the earth tangible that you can touch you can feel because he started to form toward flesh in ethiopia so one more step in there to do you know to put this spirit man in a body of flesh and that's what he did in genesis 2 7. so he had elohim form man in his own image and that's where you have genesis 1 26 elohim prepared for this song manifested song in genesis 2 7 by forming a word image the forming of the word image was the preparation that enemy had to do first before he could get the sun in flesh manifested on the face of the earth an adopted son amen a son who will display and manifest his glories on the face of the earth so elohim amen there he was i said preparation you got to know what you're looking for elohim you wanted a son number two what steps to take elohim took the steps from himself from elohim into logos and from logos he created an image and then lastly he put this word image into a flesh body and that's where you have a son of god manifested in flesh the what image in flesh the word made flesh adam on the face of the earth an expression of god on the face of the earth a manifested son of god on the face of the earth adam was a manifested son what does it mean to be a manifested son adam shows us and when jesus christ the second adam came he showed us in greater detail what it means to be a son of god on the face of the earth brother branham said um adam three things adam had three things because when he failed he lost these three things what it means to manifest your son number one adam had eternal life number two he had fellowship with god god loves fellowship and eternal life must always be manifested because first john says this eternal life which we have seen which was manifested eternal life is always manifested it's not alive it doesn't you have eternal life it's on the inside of you but it's gonna be manifested and that's why the word must always make me flesh his life must always be expressed in flesh on the face of the earth amen so adam had number one eternal life number two fellowship with god and number three had an inheritance in his eternal life what does that mean that inheritance meant adam was given the earth by god his father for an inheritance i know you know these things but just to get a message together for you he he had this earth as an inheritance like a man uh who looks at his son who has uh uh uh uh come of foolish and responsible and gives him an inheritance go and run this for your father go and run this group this comedy for your father and that's what adam was god gave adam the earth to run and rule for him as his inheritance and wants to be adam alone because all the sons were to come forth adam was to speak other sons from the from underneath the ground from where he himself came from to speak them out but adam before he could get to that time he fell by sin by listening to his wife's sin he followed her into sin and so that program couldn't go on no more and so that's why we couldn't come to these are their sons of god like adam came and the only one who could come a son of god straight from the hand of god like adam did was god himself the lord jesus christ he came here right straight from the spirit of god and came into flesh not born by sex not born by any human uh interaction at all nor human influence this was very god himself living in human flesh this was the theophany not an image of the theophany like adam was this was the theophany itself put in flesh because the bible said in the beginning was the word the theophany the logos and the logos the theophany the flesh was the i mean the theophany the word was god and the being was the word and what was with god and the word was god and the word the theophany the lord was made flesh and dwelt among us that couldn't be said of adam adam was the theophany image the word image made flesh an image of the word a portion of the word midflesh was adam but that was enough to make him an amateur god on the face of the earth so jesus christ came amen as very god on the face of the earth in human flesh and he showed us in a great in greater detail what it meant to be a son of god on the face of the earth adam showed us explain to us what adam was in the garden of eden because adam had absolute total complete control on the face of the earth as a placed sun as an adopted sun as a manifestation on the face of the earth that's how we started on this earth and that's how we are leaving this earth that's how we are going to come back on this to rule and reign amen in the millennium in the new jerusalem sons of god will destroy the universe of this earth and rule and reign on behalf of god their father that was the program god had and the devil thought he truncated it but god's purpose can never be defeated so adam was a manifesto son adam was a very replica of what it i mean was it was a very expression of what it meant to be a manifested son and adam could speak adam could name adam could do whatever i wanted to do brother branham taught us now listen here on the on on the message um it's been about adam he said um on the message the fundamental foundation of faith for faith brother branham said now god when he made man in the beginning he made him superior to anything on earth he gave him the jurisdiction of everything on earth to control everything on earth man control the animal life he controlled the foul life in other words the broads of the air he controlled the fishes of the sea amen he controlled the winds he controlled the plant life man he control everything man was made as a secondary god on earth that's a manifested son excuse me an amateur god on the earth the ruler the cr the the the the the the the uh uh uh the lord on the earth he was made a secondary god on the earth he was given the power to control all things all elements of the earth that was adam adam was given these great powers but then the power that he was given to make himself is where he fell and i'll explain that to you adam's problem was self-life and that's been the problem this year being a god on the earth that's eternal life that's god's own life zoe displayed expressed that has nothing about a man that's not about you and me that's god's life in us working its way out that dominion that authority that control that's god himself working his way out that's the life of god that's eternal life it's in our life is not hallelujah i'm saved thank god i'm saved yes and so much more eternal life is a display of the glory of god eternal life is god's own life that's eternal on end in life and that life on the face of the earth subdues multiplies replenishes dominates that's the life of god that's the eternal life that's what adam had that's the life adam had and that's what he's saying here and adam exercised this power but then the power that he was given to make himself that's where he fell and adam could speak to the winds and the winds will stop he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to the wildfire it would obey him he could speak to the waters ever what it was everything obeyed adam now that is the beginning of man that's where we began and that's where we are going to end of course there's no ending to us but on the face of this area we are coming back to that spot because this eternal life that's in us is of god and god is the beginning and the end in other words the beginning and the ending at the same spot the first and the last in other words the first and the last at the same spot the alpha and omega in other words the alpha and omega are one and the same thing the first church and the last church are one and the same thing and if that was the beginning of man that is going to be the ending of man also amen because that's just the very nature of god so he said now that is the beginning of man that's what god given power over everything on the earth now through the fall he lost that power and i just told you the fall is the power to make himself that's where he fell now through the fall he lost that power then he becomes unconscious of the fact he just forgot it he just couldn't make it out anymore because he lost eternal life so he lost it all because that's eternal life that was being expressed through him he lost it all and now through the fall he lost the power then he becomes unconscious of that fact after losing his relationship and friendship with god fellowship with the father then he lost that and all of his great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through now what adam was in god christ has redeemed us back to what adam was crushing us back to so we can go back there so we can go back there to make him the first and the last the beginning and the end the alpha and the omega the end is but the beginning we we got started from where we end up at we end up at where we got started adam said that as an adopted son we are end up as adopted sons of god and that's how we leave this earth that's how we are going to leave this earth and we come back god's sons and daughters in a brand new world amen to take over and rule and reign for our eternity with our father god on the throne amen so excuse me so he said now adam what adam was in god christ has redeemed us back to that now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its origin again to where god started from that's what we're going back to placed sons adopted sons manifested sons that's where we are going back to that's where christ redeemed us back to what adam lost the devil authority truncated the program no god just used the devil as a tool to to to give the program a pause so that god's attributes or in himself will come out of a redeemer of a savior of a deliverer if adam never fell you would never god will never get a chance to express his attribute as a redeemer as a savior so the devil is only a tool in god's hands we give the devil too much credit sometimes the devil can do a thing to you it's only a tool in god's hands too many of us have too much confidence in the devil's powers rather in god's powers we are so sure the devil can will disturb along the way but we don't give god the same credibility that god has a life in his hands and the devil is only a tool in his hands he can't move one inch by what god allows him to move he can go beyond one inch if god don't give him the chance to and he cannot touch you either amen remember job go talk with lucifer and say where have you been he said i've been just here and there to and fro see i'll be considering my seven job said yeah because you put a hedge around him said god sure i'll i'll let you touch him the devil couldn't even touch job until god allowed him to because god knows job needed a double he was going to give job a double portion but there was no way he could do it until job lost all that he had and god can do that so he let the devil a tool in his hands do that the devil is only a tool the devil don't have no power but what god power god gives him and what power we give him to because when we are so sure the devil is going to do something it's faith it's negative faith we are exhibited many times but thank god for the prophet of malachi 4 who let us understand that we are going back to bronson's field sons place sons adopted sons who are going to speak like adam and their words are going to be backed so brother branham syria continues this quote here amen he said what adam lost christ has uh redeemed us back to and when uh um um i'm sorry what what adam was in god christ assumes us back to to that now redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to his origins again and adam never had to be sick he never had to die he never had to worry he never had a heart ache he never had fear he just climbed up in the arms of the father and just like a child everything was his and whatever he asked why he just got it everything obeyed him because he was god's child and the child is heir of all things that was adam that was what we were supposed to be but for the fall but christ has within us back and we're going back there that's what our adopted sons is all about we're going back there now when man fell he lost this and now what he lost in the fall christ come uh as a redeemer did you ever stop to think that christ you didn't did you ever stop to think what christ you didn't ask for he gave us everlasting life he brought us back to the eternal fellowship and relationship to god that adam lost to be god's sons and daughters again to restore back all that adam lost in the fall all that adam lost in the fall the eternal life the fellowship the inheritance in life amen so that was a manifested son and that's how adam lived on the face of the earth he was literally absolutely god on the face of the earth until he fell by sin and when he fell he lost it all because the chin of command it was god over adam adam over the earth and the control as long as god had control over adam adam had control over the earth when god lost control over adam adam lost control over the earth it was a chain of command and once adam fell by sin the earth all nature fell adam became corrupted all nature became corrupted and thus all nature is groaning longing to get back to its ought to be conditioned and so there you have it the life of a manifested son of a place son of an adopted son adam and even before the fall but then he fell and lost all this now so many things we could say about the fall so many things but let me just narrow it down here because he said the power he was given to make himself that's where he fell do you know what caused the fall what caused the fall was a little shift in focus lucifer in the serpent was persistent and he succeeded in getting eve he knew he couldn't do with adam so he went to eve and succeeded in getting eve to get a little shift in focus from this eternal life that god gave them that they had in the garden of eden that was an in absolute authority and rulership and control over the earth that was god's own life in them that eternal life was god's own life the life of the father and by a little shift in focus from that eternal life god eternal life god's own life in them god's plan for them by a little shift in focus from that eternal life to self-life adam lost it all he focused on self he focus on himself that power was supposed to make himself to control himself that's where he failed and that's what caused all of this trouble how how did this happen the serpent succeeded in shifting helping eve to shift her focus from all that god has done for her and adam here was this beautiful world here was this beautiful earth and adam and eve had total complete control over this earth can you believe it the devil succeeded in shifting the focus shifting her focus from all of that to one small tiny thing that god did not do for her can you relate of course you can of course you can of course i can too that's how we are the form made us like that the power to control himself that's where he fell the power to control ourselves that's where we fail many times the power over self-life that caused the fall that's where we feel many times so the serpent succeeded in shifting his focus from all that god has done for her to the one thing he did not do for her he told her he questioned her contentment he told her as god said don't eat of this tree it's not about all that god said you could do it was about the one single thing that god said to not do which was for their own good i won't have time to go into all that but it was for their own good and the devil this happened sweet talked her you see that god look at what he did to you look at what he did against you he kept this from you how to make life in the world all of this oh yeah but how can you be did you give all of this yes i know but how can you be happy how can you say you are content you are happy you are satisfied if you don't have this i'm talking about how can you be happy he questioned her contentment he questioned her satisfaction he helped her to shift her focus from eternal life to self-life he shifted the focus from everything god has done for her he belittled it and she did it with him to the one single thing single thing that god withheld from her that became the issue the one thing you don't have that i don't know how that becomes the issue not all that god has done and shifted our focus to your self-life away from eternal life what is self-life that power to control himself what is self-life self-life is what someone has done against you look at what god said has god said oh yeah don't mind what i said i know how to bring forth life if he didn't give you that it hasn't given you anything yet all of this is just to a smoke screen to to make you feel you have something when you don't really have what you think you have and he was lying to her because he is the father of lies the liar and the father of lies but he's succeeding shifting her focus to self-life and once again that self-life mode you are a gonna self-life what someone is doing against you what someone has not done for you and what that does that results in a focus on self i me and myself the three important most important people in the world become i me and myself whereas the most important thing in the world you should be god and your relationship with god should be your eternal life your fellowship with god and the inheritance in life should be her most important focus but she did it from that to i me and myself god did all this yes but he didn't do this for me what someone did to me what someone did against me what someone did not do for me a focus on self self life the power to control himself that's where he fell and that's where many of us fell on the other hand god's eternal life had a different focus it wasn't focused on god it was focused on adam and eve their happiness their joy eternal life is focused on what has been done for you self life is focused on what has not been done for me eternal life is focused on what has been done for you what god has done what somebody else has done the eternal life is focused on gratitude looking for the gratitude looking for the positives in the midst of the same negatives looking for the positives looking for what i call the offset in positives when things look negative don't let the devil focus you on that when you force you on that that self life that was cause that's what caused all of this trouble from eden right down to today a focus on self life eternal life is focused on gratitude appreciation what has been done for you what god has done what someone he has done the the the gratitude in your heart appreciation you have that's why david was so beloved by god they will come in the midst of the the the the most difficult they will come praising god and thanking god and and praise that's why because they were the man after my own heart but too many of us complain about this complaining about that community about this and we just get so focused on that self-life and when you get in that mode that's just the atmosphere the devil can thrive in very very strongly because that's what caused the fall self-life is so focused on self and that's what inspires evil in us eve was so focused on what god hasn't done because the devil should have focused till it inspired the evil in her i mean inspired he opened up to evil and that evil inspired every negative thing in her immediately she started living on physical life to her husband and had a child out of her marriage to a husband a focus on self-life just think anything that we do that's wrong i could prove to you i could stand here and profit for hours and show you is a focus on self life that's the premium of your sin of your problem of your attitude bad attitude of your challenges that you have brother brahm said the greatest enemy i have is william branham she is the greatest enemy i have is william branham he said the greatest gift is to learn how to get william branham out of the way to get me out of the way and let god's life god eternal life come through come forth and so uh joining back to this garden of eden has got to take your self-life that's going to take yourself i was going to take care of it because that's what god has in trouble in the first instance so quickly self-life inspires inspired eve to know evil to know wrong to know things that are wrong and to generate evil and wrong from deep within her while on the other hand eternal life is what inspires knowing good whatsoever things that appear whatsoever things that are lovely whatsoever things are holy whatsoever things of a good report think on these things self-love is focused on what has not been done for you or what has been done against you my husband did this to me my wife didn't do this for me my daddy didn't do this for me the pastor didn't do this for me they didn't do this against me self-life but in love is focused on what has been done for me gratitude thanksgiving appreciation so why self-life i mean while eternal life is focused on gratitude appreciation things given adoration self-life is focused on dissatisfaction like the serpent may leave to be dissatisfied dissatisfaction discontent and that dissatisfaction is what inspires knowing evil because after the fall god said the man has become as one of us knowing good and evil the man had gotten out to a state to where knowing good and evil it's not knowing like you say i know president trump i know is the president of america no knowing good and evil is to know at an intimate level the man before the fall only knew good because eternal life is good the good and great god of eternal life was living on the inside of him but when eve allowed herself to be to be to uh uh uh to to to her focus to be shifted by lucifer in the serpent from eternal life to self-life see the problem we're in today question her contentment and self-life is all about your emotions self-life the devil knew that if i can get in high emotions i control her because friends whatever whoever anything that controls your emotions controls you these are the things that keep us from this eternal life we have eternal life but the entire life must always be expressed eternal life is not just a talk it's not an expression they take notice and say you have been with jesus the power the living god will be in the living church the bride even before the dynamics comes upon us but because they focus on self-life self-life is so mad up your emotions the serpent got into our emotions and she started feeling bad at what god hasn't done for her feeling bad at how god has left her feeling bad i got into this guy didn't do that look at what this person has and i don't have that and all that i emotionally got all clogged up and when our emotions got that way she became nasty she became adulterous whoever control your emotions controls you whatever controls your emotions controls you and so once the serpent got to that spot con had emotions under control he could make her do anything to make us believe anything whether it was true or not true it not matter then oh hallelujah so whatever adam lost christ has redeemed us back to and that's the second adam our lord and savior and redeemer he has redeemed us back to everything that adam lost he has sort of back to the eternal life he's only back to the fellowship with god we should go back to these inheritance in life how did he do it he rested back to us a power a power to prepare for the coming of the lord to prepare to go back to adopted sons to prepare to go back to manifestations a power that comes from his life this eternal life isn't him and when he died on calvary's mountain he went to the grave and on the third day rose again and went to the father and came right back again with her power to prepare us for this great event that's ahead of us through seven church ages to prepare his bride for the manifestation of the sons of god to prepare his bride for adoption time placed sons bronson's field sons who will stand there like adam one more time and speak and their watch will create itself just like that they will be set of them they could speak like adam could speak could name could control the winds it could be it will be said of these children the sons of god when they speak the winds obey when they speak demonstrable when they speak the animal kingdom trembles amen right now we pray for the sick we are meant to pray for the sick because too many people misunderstand and they look for signs and wonders and all there are signs and one has gone underneath the bride but because you don't see it you you you are more fascinated by the what the thinset and all the on the on the outside cut it off the power of god is in the church of the living god the power god is in the world in the bride in the message the power of god is here don't you see the power of the living god in the church the bride the sick are healed the death is the death hasn't stopped that's going on right now but right now we pray for the sick sometimes they get healed sometimes they don't but when we get right back to these inheritance in life this place sounds these are adopted sons these sons of god coming back these manifest their sons every time the demons will scream for their life you won't even have to pray you just speak the word and the demons will tremble you speak the word and the word will create itself just like that so jesus the second adam has come and died and restored us back to this year on that journey back to what adam lost he has restored back the eternal life here he stood back the fellowship here he stood back the inheritance in life and what is he doing he was the same one that prepared adam to get to this manifestation of the sons of god he was one that prepared adam to become the word made flesh he prepared adam by pouring the word into adam by pouring the seven spirits of the logos into adam to make him the image of god to make him a what image he prepared adam by forming him into the word image an image of the word and then put this image into flesh anointed this image by the spirit of god in the flesh and adam became the word made flesh and when he became the word made flesh it was then that the man was actually given a name adam not before the spirit man was not given a name in scriptures but was well became the flesh man that's why he was given the name adam he was only said of a spirit man male and female created in them boy would he put a name to it but in genesis 5 after the spirit man the word image that had been formed had been placed in flesh it was after that time that the flesh man was named adam the son of god manifested on the face of the earth hallelujah so jesus died and he is the same god that prepared adam she was the same god that's preparing his bread through seven church ages because he died and he has paid the price for us to go back to all that adam lost the fellowship the eternal life the inheritance in life and jesus says in young 14 that we read in my father's house there are many mansions if you are not so out i told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come back and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also now every scripture has at least two different meanings and so we can apply this to different meanings to this but here is the angle i want to come to from this the the uh in this message here jesus said i go to prepare a place for you and it's commonly said he's gonna prepare the place is the theophany bodies that we bypass he's gonna be paid for us and then you come in the rapture to take us home that is true that is very true but here's the point here the theophany bodies that we bypassed are not just being prepared right now those still funny bodies were always there so when he said i go to prepare a place for you in a sense it's talking to anybody but in the real actual sense those theophany bodies were always there we bypass them not because they were not there we bypassed our theophany so that we can come here and be able to be tempted in the flesh that's why adam could fall that's why it could fall because they bypass their fear funny bodies that's why she could get detoured into self-life and adam could get it into self life because they bypassed their feel funny bodies so the suffering boys were always there so when he said i got a prayer place for you and that place is the fear for anybody yes but it's not just in preparation so that's not exactly what it means it means that and so much more he said and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also what he's saying here friends as i'm fixing to wind down here what he's saying here friends is that he's gone to prepare the place for us that place is there and he will go before the father to present himself as the first fruits of the resurrection and then come back begin on the day of pentecost to begin to prepare us for that place if i go and prepare place i will come back it will come back in the rapture yes but it comes back in every single church age through a message so he comes back with a preparation a message to prepare his children his sons and daughters in every one of those ages and they are prepared exactly like adam was prepared by the seven spirits of god which is the one of god which is the theophany of god which is the lord of god and it comes back in every age you know the dear pentecost with that with without preparation with the water god the spirit of god to prepare these children and form them into the word image and our image gets anointed into the flesh that where he is in that age who he is in that age those sons and daughters will be there in that age with him because the word in the age anointed makes you the anointed world make sure they are not a messiah and when your your word for your age is anointed in you by the spirit of god you become an anointed messiah for that age and so the preparation is talking about is to come back and bring back that preparation in the form of a message i will come back and receive you unto myself that where i am i am i am present tense i am in every age there you will be also and so in every age the same god that prepared adam by the forming of the word image that same god came back down on the day of pentecost to begin to prepare his children to go back to what adam lost and when he came back on the pentacles he showed that what he said was exactly what he was going to do he came back and with the spirit under the pentacles and thus performed them into the word image on the spot and anointed that what image in their flesh right at the same time and throughout that age just what adam had genesis 1 26 the preparation the forming of the word image and then what image anointed and placed in flesh for the placing of sons genesis 2 7. on the day of pentecost they had it booked at the same time the preparation came down in the form of the word that he had spoken to them and the spirit of god anointed that one in their souls and thou what become the anointed war in them then under christ on the inside of them and then thou would was anointed into their flesh till they became the word made flesh till they spoke their watch manifested itself just like that created itself just like that there were gods on the face of there like adam was in the garden of eden born sons fearless sons adopted songs in the first church of pentecost but like it happened hidden the devil came again because god has them in seven church ages if he closes up at that time you and i will not be there but god's program allowed the devil to come again but to show you and i that this is it this redeemer has redeemed us back and that church of pentecost was only the first fruits that the church has been restored back with him back to that again of eden again and when that was lost when the devil came against it again he said i will restore see other lord i will get that church right back because i have done paid the price and so in every age he come right back in every age with a message with the word the to to form them into his image he was faithful to send a messenger each time with the word and that word is seven spirits the just shall leave by faith luther said thou contained the seven spirits of god that was all god revealed to them in that age and that connected the seven spirits of god and the seed of the kingdom in that it received that word i will come again to you and receive you unto myself in other words i'll come to you and you receive me i'll receive you myself and i will come right back on you and anoint that word into your flesh for your day and age so you'll become the anointed messiah for that age and luther and his people have the mechanics the world that formed them into the water image for their age and age and the mechanics and the dynamics that launched the mechanics into the flesh for that day and age preparing them preparing them for this great time they couldn't go in the rapture because the time was not yet and that's why they are waiting on you and i that's why they're without us cannot be made perfect and that's why all nature is waiting and groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god in this end time here to bring up the dead in christ to bring everyone back to their ought to be conditioned and we are here standing for them and so it was he prepared them in every church age until he come to this last age and he sent a mighty prophet that great elijah prophet with the word of a living god in order that a perfect bride might come forth for the perfection of the son of god again the perfection the coming of the perfection of the son of god the son of god coming back in perfection and with perfection with the entire word of believing god with the entire holy spirit with the entire seven spirits of god all the losings tied up entire word of god for this edge here presenting to you and i and we get that word and by that what informs us again into the word image and that's what jesus said he that will come after me let him take up his cross and deny himself that self-life and take up his cross deny himself and follow me that's the secret here the word in seven church ages the one in seven churches from paul arenas man in columbus all the way down up to this edge here is targeted a self-life to kill the self-life so that eternal life will be the thing that will rule and reign in you and i every single day of our lives while we are waiting for the spirit to anoint the word in us to bring about the manifestation of the sons of god so what do we find jesus said he that will come after me who will be like me after our likeness like god on the earth which spoken with an adopted son likes in matthew 17 whoever will come after him let him take up his cross daily deny himself daily denying himself is denying himself that self life that caused the problem that that's what's causing your problem it's not your husband it's not your wife it's not your dad it's not your mom it's not the president it's not the government self life is what's causing the problem either will come after me to become like me after our likeness let us make man in our image after our likeness is sending the world shaping you shaping your spirit into his image and then if you will really become like him to become a god on the earth after me a god on the earth like me that inheritance in life deny yourself the discipline of preparation deny yourself and follow me follow the world and that's what it means we come here to take testing on the world we coming with baptists that theophany so they can come here and be tested by the world and until the time that is our what comes the manifestation of the sons of god adoption time the word of the lord will trials god will bring every filthy thing to try you and i and if you don't understand that self life is what was turning the way god allows lucifer to come to you and i again like him to eve to try to focus on self-life but we have been too well trained he failed but this bride is not going to fail amen this bride is not going to fail she's predestined to not fail while where he focus on self-life this bright focus is on eternal life and brother bob's the only two types of life there are eternal life and self life self life caused the fall and jesus gave us the antidote how to get rid of self-life he's preparing us by his word message through seven church edges and in this age here all the messengers of the seven churches have been wandered into one for us into malacca for the message of the seven seals and the seven thunders and thus shaping us holding us shaping our spirit preparing us forming us in the into the image of the world shaping us to becoming like the world but in addition to that when we take that word it kills self-life so god we come here to take testing on the world testing by the world that's what i feel funny for and when we are tested on the world we take the world unlike if we took lucifer's lie and focus on self-life we take the world and focus on eternal life and when you focus on the world and refuse lucifer's lives reflect self-life that's where growth and maturity comes in the growth and maturity that comes from taking the world from taking the world and refusing to take anything contrary to the world that's how you form yourself into the word image romans 8 says we have been predestined to be conformed to the image of jesus christ that's how you form yourself into the image of jesus christ that's how you form yourself into the image of the world and when god can see that because the what you made is spirit the word in genesis 1 26 is a spirit man and when god can see that there's a promise of dynamics the spirit of the living god to anoint your what image in you and you become the anointed word image and that another word image will be another in your flesh will be the glory of god over you it will chant through your clothes all around will be the glory of god demons will scream in their presence it will be the son of god sons of god coming back tell me my brother tell me my sister when was there a time that the sons of god were ever to be manifested out of the outside of this time before the atonement before the uh utmost ever brought forth it couldn't have happened there couldn't have been manifestation but now all things have been brought shaping shaping down to a headstone to a manifestation of the sons of god oh hallelujah the holy spirit the promise of the dynamics will pour upon you and you anoint your what image in you and turn that what image into spirit a spirit man one more time and you are gonna see sons of god with absolute total control and power and authority like genesis 1 26 and then one more thing that what will be anointed in your flesh and when it's entering the flesh you'll be given three more words here ye him and you'll get against sons of god bless sons adopted sons manifested sons speak and their words will be backed we'll be back again to the garden of eden like adam was will demonstrate what jesus demonstrated and thank god that greed elijah prophet of malachi 4 already demonstrated these things to you and i in this end time here in this age a man prepared by the spirit of god and who overcame self-life overcame himself and the word of god had free flow in his heart it was formed into the one image and the holy spirit anointed the word image in him and anointed the word made into his flesh till he could speak and the words will create themselves just like that we have seen that that's been the micah was the first fruit that has been waved over us for acceptance they signed before acceptance before the love that we are coming to and we are coming to oh hallelujah we are coming sons of god are coming back oh hallelujah let me do one two quotes and then i'll be ready to close brother branham said um on who is this mercy zarek you come like adam you come like me you become from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted by sin that's why adam could be tempted and fall but when this life is finished here if this other tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we've done the word the theophany we go back to the theophany but right now the what image of our theophany is spirit genesis 1 26 1 26 28 spirit this what image in us now is no word we are forming a sentence of the word image but for it to become the word image fully formed statue of christ in us the spirit has got to strike it to make us the anointed messiahs for this day and age and that will be the spirit that will live in our theophany bodies oh my that's what he's saying here we go back to the world it is other the banana could be resolved we have one already waiting that's where we go we go to the world the theophany then we can look back and see what we've done now we don't understand it we have never become the word the theophany amen we have never become the world we've just become the flesh man not the word but look clearly makes it clear that you will never be the world unless you was a thought at the beginning that thought with that eternal life proceeding on the inside of you that can receive the word to be found into the word image to be prepared for this manifestation of the sons of god to be prepared for this place sons of god but i look clearly makes it clear that you will never be the world unless it was a thought at the beginning see you can be the world unless you are a thought you have to be in the thinking first but you see in order to stand temptation you have to bypass the theophany in the world you have to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin and adam fell and self-life coming there self-life that's where all the sin comes from and then if you will stand all the father given me will come to me and i'll raise him up again at the last days see you have to be first and then you see he come right down the regular line from attribute before the foundation of the world his name is put on the lamb's book of life then from that it become the word the theophany that's jesus christ that could appear disappear and then become the flesh and return back again and resurrected that same body in a glorified condition but you bypass the theophany and become flesh man to be tempted by sin and then either seminar could be resolved we have one already waiting we have not yet the bodies but look when this body receives the spirit of god when you become a christian this forming of the word image preparing you to go back to the manifestation of the sons of god when you go back to born sons fear sons adopted sons who will speak and their word is back prepare to go back to where adam was before he fell by sin when this body receives the spirit of god the immortal life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to god hallelujah he the son of god does not commit sin there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit he that will come after me let him take up his cross deny himself deny himself not walk out of the flesh but after the spirit eternal life versus self-life that's the problem that's the whole story there you are that spirit on the inside of the world throws the flesh subject you don't have to say if i could just quit drinking if i quit smoking just get in christ and it's all gone see because your body is subject to the spirit self life deny himself cut off the flesh lust of the eyes lust of the flesh prayer life self life that's what is hindering us from the adoption right now self life but it's all according to god's plan because god has sons and daughters who are predestinated who are actually growing up into christ in all things forming themselves into the word image of jesus christ oh hallelujah glory to god amen what is it and then when you become subject to the spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and the spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened hallelujah made a life and when the bible said don't do this the body quickly turns to it there is no question right now don't do this your flesh obeys it and what is it is the earnest of the resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already studied it was one subject to sin and my uncorruption but now it's got the earnest it's turned heavenly now that's the enemies that you are going in the rapture is there earnest oh hallelujah a sick person laying dying nothing left but death that's what would happen i've seen shadows of people don't eat up with cancer and tuberculosis and see them persons a little while after that perfectly normal and strong if there's no divine healing then there is no resurrection because the vanillin is the earnest of the resurrection amen the earnest of the adoption amen you know what ns money is don't you it's a down payment he was wonderful our transgressions um with his stripes we are healed notice how wonderful we love him now these bodies submit to the spirit have not yet entered into the word form yet but we are still in the flesh form but subject to the word keeping the flesh subject that's how we get to these adoption of sons the what image keeping the flesh subject the world the preparation is the message of the day and age and the preparation is the message from malachi from the seven seas and the seven thunders and we will form ourselves into the word image and that keeps the flesh under mix up with our hearts and our lives and keeps the flesh under oh glory amen now this body is straight to the spirit i'm not entering the world from yet but we're still in the flesh from both subjects to the world debt in the flesh will take us there oh glory to god amen amen and when this robe of flesh is dropped there is uh another body that's that's going to pick up this body here glory to god amen we come here predestinated by god to be formed into the word image because we have been predestinated from the beginning and that's what this is about preparation being formed into the word image and then the word image will be anointed by the dynamics upon our mechanics to turn it into spirit and the spirit will you now with our flesh and then we'll have sons of god back again on the face of the earth the word living in flesh again the spirit of god united with the flesh of man making you and i the anointed messiahs for this day and age brown suns field songs play songs adopted sons manifested sons who will speak and their words will be backed that's the promise that's why we are here that's where we're in preparation and that's why we're here to form into the word image god's not going to do that for you you are the one to do that form yourself take the word deny yourself take up your cross and follow the after the world as you do that what image is being formed on the inside of you the image of the world you are becoming more like him what is the word image is the horning of your human spirit is the shape in the transforming the the transformation of your human spirit from emotions from affection memory reasoning imagination consciousness shaping and holding your human spirit from the emotions that cause the fall in the first instance that the power self-life shaping is your human spirit the forming of the word image shaping and transforming your human spirit from self-life to eternal life the spirit of god the seven spirits of god of the theophany taking over your spirit and when that happens the word in the soul will have no prayer with you human spirit you will anoint your flesh and you will speak and demons will back up that glory will shine from your soul past your human spirit into your flesh and they are gonna see one more time this wall is going to hear again direct from god as on the day of pentecost you will speak thus see other lord it will happen just like that that's our promise make no mistake in the matter it's going to be because god said so god richly bless you [Music] hallelujah let's all stand just close your eyes and raise your hands [Music] how we long to
