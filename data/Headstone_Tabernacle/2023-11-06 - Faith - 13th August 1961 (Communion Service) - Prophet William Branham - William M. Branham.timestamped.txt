[25:16] message on faith by Brother Bram preach
[25:19] by Brother Bram amen amen you may be
[25:21] seated praise God God bless
[25:26] you God make
[25:28] work see you got your own Resurrection
[25:31] inside of you your Resurrection lays
[25:33] inside of you in your spirit I you know
[25:36] when Jesus died on the cross his soul
[25:40] descended into hell and preached the
[25:42] souls that were in prison that repented
[25:44] not longsuffering days of Noah his body
[25:47] went into the
[25:48] grave but before he died he committed
[25:51] his Spirit into the hands of God into
[25:54] the hands into thy hands commend my
[25:58] spirit so you see his Spirit went to God
[26:01] his soul went to hell his body went to
[26:04] the grave now that spirit that was in
[26:08] him was the spirit of
[26:11] God that spirit in stimes and diverse
[26:14] matters anointed the prophets to bring
[26:17] the message to the people in the last
[26:19] days through Christ uh now in these days
[26:23] here through the gospel now when we
[26:26] receive Christ into our heart there's
[26:29] all that we have need of there's eternal
[26:31] life now Christ could not come back
[26:35] until three days was
[26:36] fulfilled because his Spirit was behind
[26:40] a screen like a bar like this that he
[26:44] could not cross over that bar and
[26:45] because it was a spoken word of God that
[26:47] he was to lay in the grave for three
[26:50] days and three nights now he could not
[26:52] come back until that three days and
[26:55] nights was up then when the three days
[26:57] and night night was up his Spirit was
[26:59] loosed it went directly to his soul and
[27:02] his soul came back and picked up the
[27:03] body and fulfill what he said I have
[27:06] power to lay my life down I have power
[27:08] to take it up I have power now each one
[27:12] of you have power the same way because
[27:14] you are Sons and Daughters of God and
[27:18] the Very Spirit that's in you this
[27:20] morning the Holy Spirit that's in you
[27:21] this morning that same holy spirit will
[27:24] raise you up so you have power to raise
[27:28] yourself back up when you die your soul
[27:31] will go into the uh under the altar of
[27:34] God not in right in the presence of God
[27:37] now your spirit will go to God but you
[27:39] cannot come back remember the Bible it
[27:41] said the spirit souls are on the altar
[27:43] crying Lord how long how long they could
[27:46] not return until the scriptures
[27:47] fulfilled like Christ canot return till
[27:50] the scriptures fulfilled then after the
[27:52] all has been done all the sufferings
[27:55] over and the Brethren has suffered the
[27:57] same thing or we suffered like they
[27:58] suffered and so forth then on that day
[28:03] you know exactly where you're buried
[28:05] your spirit will be turned loose from
[28:08] God and will come to the soul now the
[28:11] soul is that part of me who knows and
[28:13] understands your intelligence you
[28:15] remember the vision I had not long ago
[28:17] the little translation went into that
[28:19] place and saw those people amen now your
[28:21] spirit will come back to that body and
[28:25] that that kind of a body the soul which
[28:28] say the body that does not uh have to
[28:30] eat and so forth is this Earthly
[28:32] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[28:34] already waiting a Celestial body and
[28:37] with that spirit and that soul and
[28:41] Celestial body you'll raise up again
[28:44] this natural body that great Millennium
[28:47] hallelu you have the power in you now to
[28:50] do that now but that power that you have
[28:54] in you now can make a new world God
[28:58] doesn't have little weak spots and big
[29:00] heavy spots is powerful the least little
[29:04] touch of God is omnipotent amen see the
[29:08] least little touch of God so you know so
[29:11] I'm trying to get you in faith now you
[29:14] know that something has happened to you
[29:17] as a Christian do you know it amen you
[29:20] used to ride down here in the muck with
[29:22] all of the muck and sin and drinking and
[29:25] gambling and and things of the World
[29:28] well as soon as you believe that Christ
[29:30] forgive your sins you raised up above
[29:32] that stuff now you're riding up here the
[29:36] above all of it why because that you
[29:39] believe that you are a Christian then
[29:42] when you accepted Christ and the Holy
[29:43] Spirit came to you then you had faith in
[29:46] the holy spirit that gives you power to
[29:47] ride above that kind of life of sin well
[29:51] the only thing you have to do to ride
[29:53] higher into healing is just have more
[29:55] faith amen just keep pushing
[29:58] see and there you are now you're sick
[30:01] and you're not a Christian become a
[30:03] Christian right now so that that healing
[30:06] power will come in you by becoming a
[30:08] Christian and that will give you Faith
[30:10] to R above sin it'll give you faith in
[30:13] everything that you have need of in this
[30:14] journey is right in you now and the only
[30:18] thing you have to do is have faith in
[30:20] God that pushes that good things out of
[30:22] you which by the Holy Spirit you
[30:25] understand clearly now
[30:27] you Billy told me last night called me
[30:30] and said come in this morning especially
[30:32] for one person come thinking we're
[30:34] having services this we of those seven
[30:37] uh seals and they brought a sick child I
[30:39] believe and if you're here now sir
[30:43] remember you cannot your your faith will
[30:46] have to go for that child if it's it's a
[30:48] little infant child but now let me take
[30:52] another scripture if it's all right
[30:55] brother just remember now in the gospels
[30:59] we read over in the 16th chapter I
[31:02] believe of the acts where that Paul and
[31:04] silus was in prison one night and they
[31:08] had been beaten because he cast The
[31:10] Devil's Spirit out of a fortune telling
[31:12] girl and it was U and she her Masters
[31:16] had got angry about it and beaten them
[31:19] put them in in her prisons and then when
[31:21] they did that well Paul and sil's pray
[31:25] and God sent an earthquake and the jail
[31:27] down the flipping Jailer being a
[31:29] centurion which to lose his his uh
[31:33] prisoners was to be his own life would
[31:35] have to pay for the prisoners he pulled
[31:37] his sword and was going to commit
[31:39] suicide when Paul run forth and said do
[31:41] yourself no harm we're all here and this
[31:45] Centon had St some impression they had
[31:48] had about Paul and him they might have
[31:51] some him they might have testified or
[31:53] done something but whatever it was they
[31:55] know that they were holy man they know
[31:58] there was something different about
[32:00] those man because quickly he asked what
[32:03] must I do to be saved amen what must I
[32:07] do to be saved now Paul said believe on
[32:11] the Lord Jesus Christ amen and th and
[32:14] thy house shall be
[32:16] saved well if Believing on the Lord
[32:19] Jesus Christ I don't mean that his
[32:20] salvation would save the house but if
[32:22] he's got enough faith in God for his own
[32:25] salvation he have the same faith for his
[32:27] house and his house will have to come in
[32:30] see the same thing same job did as it
[32:33] said the other night down in Georgia the
[32:35] meeting I said Jo he said now I don't
[32:38] know my children have seen but what if
[32:41] they have seen and job had one thing to
[32:44] do to be righteous that was offer a
[32:46] burnt offering he said he would offer
[32:48] the burnt offering if his children had
[32:50] sin then they would be forgiven of their
[32:53] sin and it was a good thing that father
[32:55] done that's a good thinking father
[32:57] we need more of those kind of fathers
[33:00] today and job offered the bur offering
[33:03] that's before his tragedy set in but
[33:05] when his children was all killed and his
[33:08] sheep all destroyed and all he had taken
[33:11] he sitting on the a sheep back of his
[33:13] house scraping himself with a piece of
[33:16] cross did you notice after the days of
[33:19] his tragedy when God began to restore to
[33:21] him again where he had 10,000 cattle or
[33:24] so forth he restore double and double
[33:26] his sheep
[33:28] but you notice and God also gave job his
[33:31] seven
[33:33] children you ever think where they were
[33:35] at that bur and stood for him amen they
[33:39] were saved in glory waiting for him to
[33:41] come he's with him today th and th how
[33:44] shall be saved see now J had one thing
[33:47] to do to be righteous was to offer the
[33:50] burnt offering you have one thing to do
[33:52] to be righteous that's have faith in
[33:55] God am am for by faith are you saved by
[34:00] faith are you heal by faith you get
[34:02] everything that you have it's by faith
[34:05] that you believe now believe on the Lord
[34:08] Jesus Christ and thy and th house shall
[34:10] be saved now sir you got the baby here
[34:13] to be pray for you believe yourself I'm
[34:16] here to put my faith with yours and
[34:19] we'll believe together that God heal
[34:21] that baby see we got in us the power to
[34:24] do that amen you got knew the power to
[34:27] do it every Christian's got the power to
[34:29] do it but now if we can just get that
[34:32] power is controlled by law as I've often
[34:34] said it's like gravitation controls
[34:37] water because it's a law gravitation
[34:40] controls water the sun is controlled by
[34:43] the by the the Earth turn of the earth
[34:47] you can't just make the sun do one thing
[34:49] doesn't say I won't sleep long hold on
[34:51] power it won't do it see because there's
[34:54] a law if you work according to that law
[34:57] well then everything will be all right
[34:59] if you go to bed in time you can wake up
[35:00] in time and if you uh like we got the
[35:03] Lake Superior Lake on here your Lake y
[35:06] on all those great lakes up here we got
[35:08] tens of thousands times thousands of
[35:11] Acres of ground out Nevada and
[35:13] California and Arizona New Mexico that's
[35:15] burning up for that water of land that
[35:18] would raise anything you can feed the
[35:20] whole world about there if you only had
[35:22] this water up here down there and it
[35:24] wouldn't bother that because of the
[35:25] spring fed as soon as it goes down just
[35:28] comes up your SL again because
[35:29] gravitation holds it there well now if
[35:31] you can work according the law of
[35:33] gravitation you can take all these Great
[35:35] Lakes and water that whole country out
[35:37] there and feed the whole world nobody
[35:40] will be hungry but you can't sit here
[35:42] and say yeah I see it sure got to go to
[35:44] it well that's the same way it is about
[35:47] the law of God the law of God is Fai and
[35:50] we got faith here this morning to heal
[35:53] any sickness to do anything amen but
[35:56] it's control by law and that law is
[35:59] Faith God's law is Faith Jesus said
[36:01] whatsoever things you desire you afraid
[36:04] if you can believe you receive it you
[36:05] can have it there you are so it's a
[36:08] faith that controls it and faith is
[36:10] given to us just as we have need of now
[36:13] we have to God L some of some Faith some
[36:15] other faith it isn't some great
[36:17] Supernatural power that have because
[36:19] when you become the Christian you
[36:21] already have the power but you like
[36:23] faith in operating have power amen so
[36:26] now the morning when you come to be pray
[36:27] for remember the Bible has said this
[36:31] this is true James 5:14 if there be any
[36:34] among you sick let them call the Elders
[36:36] of the church let them anoint them all
[36:37] pray over the prayer of faith shall save
[36:40] the sick and God shall raise him
[36:42] up
[36:44] promise you'll believe it therefore you
[36:47] see healing is loed to the individual it
[36:51] was the days of Jesus of Naz he can not
[36:54] heal people against their against their
[36:56] own faith he said I can if you believe
[36:59] if you believe that I'm able to do this
[37:01] I can do it if you can believe it so
[37:04] some people throw throws the power of
[37:07] healing into some of evangelist it's not
[37:09] that the power of healing is in you Amen
[37:13] in you they just put the C before the
[37:16] hearts the Evangelist doesn't have power
[37:18] to heal it's the holy spirit that has
[37:20] power of healing you have the holy
[37:22] spirit amen that's the little tree that
[37:25] you are and all the things that you have
[37:27] need of is in you so therefore you just
[37:29] start drinking from God's promise and
[37:31] it's a truth God say heal me buy Stripes
[37:34] I am there you start
[37:37] pushing and then others can see what you
[37:42] have now what is faith is the substance
[37:44] of things hope far evidence of Things
[37:46] Not Seen I not set that little tree out
[37:48] don't see the animal but they're in
[37:51] theree knows are in there so he just
[37:53] starts ring pushing pushing because he
[37:55] know it's in I'll get it out after while
[37:58] give me a little time just keep me a
[37:59] little time you just keep drinking app
[38:01] are in me I'll bring up after a while
[38:04] first thing go here they come here comes
[38:06] the a Because he believes that there in
[38:09] amen and if you believe that the power
[38:11] of the holy spirit is in you to he you
[38:14] there you are just keep pushing see you
[38:17] have faith you can't see the result
[38:19] right away you don't see it I see James
[38:22] Justified Abraham by his Works Paul
[38:26] justifi about Abraham by his faith what
[38:29] do we say then between the two Abraham
[38:32] was speaking on what I mean Paul was
[38:34] speaking on what God saw in
[38:37] Abraham and James is speaking on what
[38:41] people saw in Abraham see now see
[38:45] therefore God know that before the baby
[38:48] come that Abraham had faith in Abraham
[38:50] proved to God by acting like he that the
[38:53] baby was going to come when he was
[38:55] sterile he had no children his wife's WB
[38:58] was dead and he was sterile but yet he
[39:01] know in there somewhere was the
[39:04] baby you see he kep drinking the promise
[39:07] lean on God's Great El sh the breast
[39:11] lean there drinking knowing God would
[39:14] know that is a promise he had to do
[39:17] it and we're the children of Abraham so
[39:19] let's lean on to PR there God will do
[39:25] it you believe it
[39:28] now let the S line over here on one of
[39:31] the sides the other it wants to be
[39:32] prayed for and we get the Elder here and
[39:34] anoint them and all I'll pray over them
[39:36] and we'll leave a God will make every
[39:38] one of them well if thou can't believe
[39:40] KY where you
[39:43] at come around on this right hand side
[39:46] that's good and I want you to play only
[39:48] believe while they're coming Let's us to
[39:50] our heads the rest the audience let's be
[39:51] in prayer for these people who are

[40:11] words are true they are so
[40:14] true they cannot fail because they are
[40:17] God's Eternal and

[40:23] like God is because they're a part of it
[40:26] in the beginning was the word and the
[40:28] Word was with God and the Word was God

[40:36] all of our hearts with all of our soul
[40:39] with all that's inside of us we believe
[40:41] it and I try in a simple childlike way
[40:44] to present it to the people that they
[40:46] might understand and know that the power
[40:49] of God LS within them they can only have
[40:53] their faith and follow God's order
[40:55] that's how they were saved they come and
[40:58] repented of their sins and was baptized
[41:00] in the name of Jesus Christ according to
[41:03] the Bible Acts two and then Peter said
[41:06] that you shall receive the gift of the
[41:08] Holy Ghost and here it com just because

[46:37] thing as an action they raise and come

[46:45] they have come to the place to believe
[46:47] that when they're prayed for they'll be
[46:48] healed and watch the reaction of their
[46:52] action Pastor got a good message for
[46:54] from sure this morning one thing I'd
[46:56] like to comment on just to know a cathol
[46:58] girl Stand Down on the altar a few days
[47:01] ago she was in my house her and her
[47:04] husband and um I know her husband for
[47:08] some time and and there was something
[47:10] about while studing on a private
[47:12] interview that's where we had the vision
[47:14] that's where we I used to have it here
[47:17] in the church but just taking up the
[47:18] morning and so forth and so it was I
[47:21] never said nothing because she being a
[47:24] girl another thing always reared in the
[47:26] Catholic church and so forth but she
[47:29] went to speak for her mother and during
[47:32] that time I saw a vision of her mother
[47:35] told her what her mother's trouble was
[47:36] and described her and how her mother
[47:38] looked of course she was judged that was
[47:41] right or not I've never seen her mother
[47:42] in alive she knows that and the girl
[47:45] this morning came to the Altar and stood
[47:47] to make a
[47:49] confession and accept Christ as heror
[47:52] she
[47:54] all I anointed her all how how God works
[47:59] anoint all our s watch the moving of the
[48:02] Holy Spirit now being she was anointed
[48:05] not sick but anointed see how makes
[48:08] everything work right she stood as the
[48:10] Christian now as she has become what we
[48:14] believe to be a Christian now she says
[48:17] would you pray for my mother she sick
[48:21] that's the same one so the anointing
[48:22] always applied approprate that see
[48:26] someone being just saved Christ stood
[48:28] for all of us he stands for all and as
[48:31] soon as this girl becomes a Christian
[48:33] then she wants to stand for somebody too
[48:36] sh that the fear of Christ comes within
[48:38] us when we are really saved now that's
[48:42] really fine uh I certainly appreciate
[48:46] that that fine Christian spirit I
[48:49] believe now just
[48:51] remember now to this young lady she's
[48:54] here somewhere and to another Catholic
[48:56] lady that came by and uh i' like to say
[49:00] these words just before I turn the
[49:01] service
[49:02] to is this now the Catholic
[49:07] church was one time like this
[49:11] church if you go back and read the Bible
[49:14] which we believe and do know that the
[49:17] Catholic church was the first church
[49:21] that is true but it got away from its
[49:23] teachings this was the teaching of the
[49:25] Catholic church but you see they got 600
[49:28] and something other books that popes and
[49:30] so forth has written it's just as holy
[49:32] to them as this Bible so see what this
[49:34] is you haven't changed what you've done
[49:37] you just been converted see now if you
[49:40] take of course I guess maybe some two
[49:43] this morning was wind there might be
[49:45] some Catholic man sitting in here if you
[49:47] go back to the history of the church if
[49:50] you might ask your
[49:51] preest the action of these Apostles in
[49:54] the Bible here was that the way that was
[49:57] that early Catholics they'll say yes and
[49:59] that's true they were now they look what
[50:03] kind of religion they had they met
[50:05] little simple places they never said Hy
[50:08] Mar or our fathers that's a tradition of
[50:10] the church what did they say they praise
[50:13] God they scream they cry look here in
[50:16] Acts 2 when the Holy Apostle Peter and
[50:19] James and John and all of together the
[50:22] Bible said they spoke in tongues and
[50:25] they scream and even act so so filled
[50:28] with the spirit until they act like they
[50:30] were drunk and even the outside world
[50:34] are not all these drunks and then Peter
[50:37] the Apostle the holy St Peter when he
[50:41] stood up and he said men and Breen these
[50:43] men are not drunk but they're filled
[50:45] with the spirit as as the Bible says
[50:48] they were now that was an early Catholic
[50:50] Church according to the teaching now you
[50:52] see after about 200 years the taking
[50:55] five begin to get into the church then
[50:57] what they do they made their first
[50:58] organization at the N Council
[51:01] 866 they made their when the N Council
[51:04] was held at 9 home they began to get all
[51:07] the great dignitaries in and they just
[51:09] formed a church and made a church and
[51:11] broke four five times went from that to
[51:14] the Bish from the bishop to Pope and
[51:16] from that come the and different ones to
[51:19] just broke it up to what you see it
[51:21] today it's just an all kind of work but
[51:24] what we're trying to do Catholic bring
[51:26] see we are Catholic too we are the early
[51:30] beginning Catholic and the church that
[51:32] they call us now mostly we're referred
[51:35] to as Pentecostal because we believe in
[51:37] the Pentecostal blessing that's where
[51:39] the Catholic church is argiz and in our
[51:43] organizations of Pentecost today if if
[51:45] this world would stand 500 years longer
[51:48] this Pentecostal organization would be
[51:50] more formal than the Roman Catholic
[51:52] Church is today it's just getting
[51:54] farther away same way and when you
[51:56] organize you make a lodge out of it and
[51:58] then you just become Lodge and members
[52:00] and unconverted souls to my precious
[52:03] dear brothers and sisters to all of
[52:06] you as a servant of God I never say word
