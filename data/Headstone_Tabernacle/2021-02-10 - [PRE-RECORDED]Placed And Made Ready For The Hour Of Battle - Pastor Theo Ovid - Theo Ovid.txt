you to say you are our lord your god this morning father come down in our midst and come and speak to our hearts come and confirm your word with signs wonders and miracles we ask in jesus name amen and amen so this morning we understand as we want to go into the word joshua chapter 11 matthew chapter 24 ii timothy chapter 3. i want to read from verse 1 to 8 of first we read joshua 11 19-23 matthew chapter 24 24. god bless you brother collins in the states praise god and all those connected to us we say welcome amen and be blessed amen joshua chapter 11 verse 19 there was not a city that made peace with the children of israel save the hivites and the inhabitants of gibeon all other they took in battle for it was of the lord to harden their hearts that they should come against israel in battle that he might destroy them utterly and that they might have no fever but that he might destroy them as the lord commanded moses and at that time came joshua and cut off the anakims from the mountains from hebron from dbu from anab from all the mountains of judah from all the mountains of israel joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities there was none of the anakin's left in the land of the children of israel only in gaza and ghat and ashda they remained so joshua took the whole land according to all that the lord said unto moses and joshua give it for an inheritance unto israel according to the divisions by tribes and the land rested from war matthew 24 verse 24 for there shall arise false christs false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders it's so much that if it were possible they would deceive the very elect second timothy chapter 3 verse 1 this also this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedience to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for this is the sort for of this sort a day which creep into houses and lead captive silly woman laden with sins led away by divers lust ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as janice and jambres which stood moses so these men resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate considering the faith let's pray father we thank you for your word we thank you for sending our elijah prophet with eagle eyes to look deep down into the age to speak to us in prophecy of the times and seasons that we're living in and how as we see signs all around us lord we want to wrap ourselves in the gown of the promised world waiting for your coming because we know dynamics is about a strike to start this great battle have your own way amongst us we pray in jesus name i ask it amen and amen you may be seated blessed be the name of the lord our title this morning placed and made ready for the hour of battle pleased and made ready for the hour of battle another inspiration it takes a word bride to defeat the enemy a word bride to defeat the enemy oh blessed be the name of the lord you love him this morning i'm looking forward for god to really bless us in the word this morning oh praise god these are some things that god put upon my heart that i want to share with you and this evening are some things upon my heart also praise god it's so strange how you get inspiration and messages assuming i wanted to preach this morning i just couldn't get to it and this is what was given so i have to just do what i've been given you know what is this address but i know that god going to speak to us because we are speaking the word from the wheat our fellowship god intended this fellowship so what separated what keeps man from having that direct talk like adam did i've often taught that adam out in the garden of eden knowing no sin eve is white beautiful leo the lion would come up tiger great beasts of the field even the beast didn't have killing about them there was no death nowhere here we go the devil is what make wild animal wants to hurt you here we go listen if you can produce in your heart the right kind of a love towards the most horrible beast there is in the woods or the desert that beast won't harm you i know it by experience but you can't pretend it he knows whether you do or not the beast knows so you can say i fear not no no no the beast knows he wouldn't answer you he will bite you he knows now watch you can't pretend it he knows whether you do or not there is something about him that he knows it but if you're really not afraid i have never seen anything will hurt you no matter a lion whatever it might be he will walk away from you but if you run or act like you're scared then you'll get killed so you can't make it up you've got to really know it in your heart you're not afraid oh glory hallelujah so this litmus test this intellectual preaching and books and tapes to face the lion and the bee and whatnot that's a different thing altogether it has to have something on the inside because the lion will know that's why you said the virtues you wouldn't have to fight up the devil make you proof [Applause] every one of them hallelujah you wouldn't have to put a red flag to say you have this and you are distant show your muscles you don't have to do that god going to arrange the test it's coming that these things could come out of you to manifest itself give the lord a shadow back now faith gonna come out first you're gonna come out knowledge gonna come out what about temperance what about patience what about godliness what about brotherly kindness what about the love of god it's got to come out and god has to create the environment for these things to come out the test for these things to pull outside of you oh hallelujah so god sent two people in the church making love and but around begging them stop it stop it stop it all of a sudden the spirit drop down whatever you say they say blind they'll be blind they said they'll die all of a sudden you see no one happened god is testing him god is creating an environment to see what he will do all of a sudden he said i forgive you and the holy spirit fell because the holy spirit was pleased this is not my mother's son he's acting like his father oh glory to god he's acting like god isn't that right he releasing forgiveness oh hallelujah he do have this self-righteous indignation against him oh hallelujah he's not self-righteous isn't that right oh blessed are you with me this morning amen amen that's the trouble with man tonight that's what the trouble with people tonight you're scared that's the biggest curse of the full gospel people or any other people is because they're afraid god has made the provision but you are afraid to take his word for it if you wasn't afraid tonight you would take your healing and know that god promised it and that thing will go plumb away from you i have noticed and that's the reason i'm such a believer in healing i know if you can get away from the scare and get love in this place something is going to happen so the prophet was trying to bring certain principles that people could access their redemptive rights amen amen because you have rights but as if you want to access it we talk about kingdom and citizenship and so on and if it have the ambulance if it have facilities that the government have it's there our citizen is your right to access it it's if you want to access it it's up to you well healing is there deliverance is there breakthrough is there victory is there what about joy is there get back your prayer life it's also there you don't have to be dumb and dull and depressed no overcoming it's there also now we talk about kingdom and sizzling and king but i have more news for you you're not even a citizen you are son of the king you are sons and daughters of the king hallelujah hallelujah dear lord i get the glory on that and you come to church to hear about your royalty they come to church to hear about your inheritance you may be seated praise god hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god calculation says a child even though he's a heir remain under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father so you don't know all things as a young child they have to get a tutor to get some history when your father owns all of this [Music] and you are the heir and you are a son and you have to walk right you have to talk right you have to act right because you have to sit on his throne come on team and somebody no you have to learn several languages no you have to go to class no you have to look at equations behavior and attitude and so on because when you walk instead of the king's son coming when you walk like the king daughter is coming you are not just ordinary angels have to escort have to go in front of you because of who you are come and see him and somebody oh hallelujah hallelujah so god have to transform your mind into kingship into headship into a consciousness that you come from god and you're going back to god and no weapon form against you could prosper so when you walk you walk fearless you're not walking as scared and afraid david said do i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil forgo out with me thy run and stuff they comfort me don't be paris a table for me in the presence of my enemies my cup run it over come on see him and somebody glory to god david said david said don't ten thousand fall on my right side [Applause] shall [Applause] he not oh get the lord i shout in the house oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah glory to god again i shall not be moved the trials are good it's given opportunity to prove god the bible said god had in the hearts to come against israel it's not their feeling i had heart god harden their hearts to come against israel for god to deal with them god alone your trials god set up this condition stop squirming stop trembling stop shaking you're going to take the land oh god help me this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god my god you may see that you realize this scripture we read with joshua joshua fulfill his commission his commission was to cross the people over conquer the land and divide the land he did it they didn't make no peace with no devil they declared war and they cut them up from the mountains cut them off from here and this is what we're doing this morning yes we're gonna cut off the enemy oh yes we're gonna cut off the low praise demons we're gonna cut that off for you we're gonna break depression you cut that demonic depression off of your life why this happened why this happened stop it it happen now let me give you the word all things work together for good you're good you're good you're good you're good you're

there's no car coming amongst you there's no fire to burn you up there's no accidental debt and something happened accidentally it doesn't work so for christian because the footsteps [Music] the footsteps of the righteous [Applause] i ordered all that oh dad by the lord the very footsteps oh glory your footsteps your flex tabs they're by the lord oh glory who gonna stop this bride she is being placed and made ready for the oar of battle you want to be seated you ever see a lion drink water all i end up drinking water with all your dung looking water so you know the [Applause] [Music]

sport is land possession this war is inheritance this war is getting active your redemptive rights not just talking about it but a manifestation of it come on say him and somebody hallelujah how many

there's a map just like a preach about it he could print it and give everybody their own copy of the land anybody can have it in the back pocket everybody can show everybody any neighbor about it this is my land but until you cross jordan until your foot touch that land until you see philistines and run them out or they run you back out until you see some kind of thing that land is not yours

actually fighting to die sit down a minute have you ever thought about that you go to work if you buy food you eat you sleep you drink you find the love you get a meal and so on but we're talking

he said like a boxer you're training and you don't want to be amen be conquered is that right you want to overcome you want to know that you have the right spirit the right attitude oh glory to god that's where you have to start with the right spirit but a mom say pray for somebody with the right spirit and wrong doctrine than somebody with the wrong spirit and the right doctrine because the right spirit can lead to the right doctrine but the wrong spirit will just leave your plane wrong oh give the lord a shout the praise so you want to have the right spirit the right attitude oh give

prostitute whose son i know what could send you to anyone but god have mercy it's not the name you're given it's not the name you're born into it's the name you made for yourself come on same as somebody we're gonna make a name hallelujah god want to hook you in the hebrews eleven by faith noah by faith jeff died by faith you all of them fought paul ford irenaeus fought martin ford all of them fought and you want to sit down on a bench with a spoke one book and don't fight get out of here you're going to fight whether you're here or you're not here but random fought he fought with hole in his jacket he fought with poverty he fought all kind of thing to bring the world he fought with long plain flights it wasn't modern planes that they have now he went around the world so much time to bring this message he died bringing this message and the message got home on the wings of a snow white dove the message got home we can't fail no we can't pack up now we can't give up now we come to father turn back shake yourself this morning you come too far to turn back the blind eye have to open the death air have to pop open the dumb must speak the lame must walk [Applause] hallelujah i'm an expectation for the fire to roar out of the world i'm on expectation but christ are coming on this to do what he promised i'm on the expectation oh glory to god amen hallelujah hallelujah there are only two faculties that govern a human one of them is fate which brings results and the other is fear i'm trying to shake that fair thing off hallelujah and i'm thinking to myself make it in last night preparing for this message and you tell people come and fight draw your sword but then you have a chain around your foot with a big steel ball you say come and fight i guess these as far as i could move him you can't help his army some of you just pick up your ball and you're walking with your ball you're taking your chains with you [Applause] we want men that are free we want men that could rise up not born with sin not bond with lust not bond with the world walking with your chair because you can't walk if you drop it on your your pillow be here to break and set the captive freely here to command the demons to come out of your life in the name of jesus in the name of jesus they say anybody want to go free from the chains that have them bound and who the son of man set free is free indeed oh god want to set somebody free inside of here free to worship free the praise god free to honor him [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah let's cut off the anakims yes yes let's cut off the gibeonites let's counter the amorites let's fight the good fight of faith but you're going to find out what this battle is about second peter 147 at your feet virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness badly kindness and charity that's the brain that's the bride watch her nature watch her behavior notice i didn't see teaching yet i'm talking about nature because the script we read in second timothy talk about a different nature heavy high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god haters these are not unbelievers this is church people yes these are people who christians want to be matthew 24 false prophet these are the fivefold on the other side and second timothy is the church members of the church of these so-called fifo on the matthew 24 24 false anointed ones they're going to release on the earth demonic activity that will cause the people to behave like that heavy high-minded posters that is the spirit of the church do you want that but the spirit of the bride is fit virtue knowledge temperance patience guardiness you have to live something that's the thunder [Applause] that's not the doctrine it never was doctrine it was always the spirit the life and i could prove it because in the beginning was the word but before the beginning [Music] [Applause] was the spirit what give the lord a shall they pray in the beginning what's the word but before the beginning what spirit so the word only come in the beginning and satan was created in the beginning but we were before the beginning therefore we have to reconnect back to the original which was before oh hallelujah so when you connect back to the attribute gene thought spirit of before no demon could stop you and trouble you oh glory to god amen hallelujah you believe that so there are two faculties that govern the human one of them is fate would bring results the other is fear which has no value in it at all faith is of god fears of the devil fear makes you wary fear makes you wonder amen if i'm going to die in the morning what god will do to me to get chewed up about it what are you going to worry about what if everybody has shake off the worry am i going to get cancer i feel that lump what if it's cancerous what not if it's cancerous god will deal with it amen there's a fight no god oh god i said i worry now the cancers are growing faster they could be growing over worry and they never say worry more worry more the more you worry is the more you're going to worry and you'll get a worrying cycle worry about your child worry about your son and worry about your daughter worry worry worry nothing in the hands of god in your hands and whatnot i tell people live for your god don't live for your children they'll get old and get out of your house and forget you live for christ they can't go wrong living for christ then you could testify to them about christ or live from a child and that's my child forget about this not even your child god give you a loan praise god forget about it commit the many hands of god and say lord i commit them into your hands and get a big revival that the lord is your god oh hallelujah friends it's coming down to show long time you know oh glory to god come on that show downtown you know it's not just books and tips no no it's more than that oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah so i was thinking about it i was thinking you know like a job i have a job and the job qualification is a master's degree or degree or subject or whatever it is i have 20 people with the same qualifications but there's something called an interview to separate who you want from who you don't want so all the books and tapes everybody have them everybody listen to brother branham listen to books and taste but you have an interview they have certain things they look for in the interview and i got a document i wanted to share something with you can the candidates do the job will the candidate fit into the company's culture is it the best candidate for the position my my mind so the interviewee is awarded a score if they have demonstrated full mastery or did not demonstrate the ability to be competent in every area customer relations communications i hear this one self management management of oneself the taking of responsibility for one's own behavior and well-being there are some people love to blame is she is he come like a little girl and all her mouth have they have the chocolate around it and she's saying it's her little brother that stole the chocolate she's not her very innocent is not her and all the mouth all the chocolates all around her mouth and she says not me is he she's not taking responsibility isn't that right technical and professional skill organizational awareness business acumen team work and leadership this part is interesting the interviewer is trained to pick up the following before and during the interview these are some of the reasons a person can be passed over for a job late to the interview lack of manners lack of confidence theoretic eye contact sloppy appearance inability to express oneself clearly overly aggressive conceited know it all attitude lack enthusiasm needed for the job check out a deadbeat well are holding on not on this job we want you working we really don't want you holding on all right so you can't come to church well come on don't give me that nutrition the interview going on right now it's before and durian we want you on your toes hey sir come on now hallelujah on fire give me a scream for that are they hurting your call lukewarm can't cut it in an interview you can't get spew out look i'm getting rejected you're not going to be employed in the lukewarm if you're called we've rejected all right we want people on fire come on same as somebody oh hallelujah hallelujah laurie lack of enthusiasm needed for the job to focus on money what's he pay what he pays he pay he's saying that we're putting right there i position he can do this job you want to pay too focus on money trashing past employers i like that one but i was working for what is it so wicked and only by talking all the employers there before well that company will know if they believe here they go back to us too we don't want that so you have to have the control i'll just give you some tips here or this will work for you who will for interview maybe this week i don't know indefinite response to questions lazy oh how do you see that boy interview how long have you ever last i don't even know but they could pick up a lazy spirit afterwards the interviews be sharper they could pick up people right away and another one another one another one a treat to determine out of all right indecision doesn't seem honest and direct when giving answers to questions we listen to what is said but most importantly what is not said so sometimes they ask you where you fit in the family i don't know where the governor you stand the middle child all right and then it acts about the first child on the second side but they have an objective behind that to see what you're going to how you respond to that lack of the lack of direction and career merely shopping around in tolerance inability to take criticism some people don't like you to tell them nothing just leave me as i am you want me to job or you don't want me we don't want you it's that simple you have to be able to take criticism criticism is healthy [Music] let let criticism be a motivation for you for you to do better for you to improve you don't want to be good you want to be perfect come on now oh hallelujah hallelujah and once an employee is selected to fill a vacancy they have a probationary period four to say six months and then depending upon given so that probationary period now is to see if there are hidden things they didn't pick up in the interview that you will manifest in that four to six months so you interview early by your late bird because you see yourself as a late bird you're late you're born late whatever that was from services like you're born late he's always coming late late is his thing you know what i mean you know what brother actually said that that's why he is late so you know he feels a natural thing he's a bit it's a placement of late but but but but but that's not true it's a late spirit on them because all you have to do is to get two hours up early and then get here on time and then you could shout and feel comfortable to be in the spirit because you come here to get your battery charged you don't want your battery hour charge you ever plug in your phone in your phone get a little charging going out how stressful that is because you know your phone gonna conk out you want a fully charged phone so when you leave here you don't want your battery quarter charge never slap you up monday morning you're looking for a recharge and all kind of things like that you coming for a full charge this morning this charge should take you to the next service and the next service until it until you become the very battery itself you don't even need her to be charged you have the charger you walking with the charger come on same as somebody hallelujah hallelujah you come here to plug in this morning or plug in you're plugging in something the current goal you can get a good charge but once you are here make sure you get the battery charger don't we don't go we have plenty calls to make this week you can't let that cell phone run out they can't let god phone run out come on say hi man somebody you can't afford for your communication line to cut oh hallelujah jesus on the mainland you better tell him what you want oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord what am i saying i'm saying the dynamics is about to break or forth the dynamics break for the battle now begins it's like food whistle blow battle no start hallelujah drama no start here come the true anointed ones because brother branham said they will be anointed first i'm not hearing you the true anointed comes forth the true anointed comes forth and then afterwards the others get the anointing after because the original dollar has to be first but they make some photocopies of it or for that they counterfeit it but they got to have an original that they could copy after so god have to bring a space between the bride and the false between the true and the force and that's what he's gonna do bring the anointing upon the bride because the spirit have to anoint the bride to take up revelation 10 to 17. the spirit and the bride say come oh you told me that anointing gonna strike the earth oh look at pepper francis pope francis gone then america swooning over him almost fainting at that false prophet amen that nice false prophet everybody just flipping over him people were not even catholics looking up to the man smiling it was so funny somebody had a baby poop a small baby with a poop hat the poop couldn't stop laughing with a picture they opened up the hat in the paper take the baby and kiss the baby was a girl somebody dressed up a baby a little baby girl with a poor pattern and kissed the baby and so on and then you poke mobile and every smile is anything at this man and all wandering at this man wandering after this beast saying do this do that do the other first time the man stepped in united nations said the devil is going to come down the united nations to anoint them with their dynamics and he is speaking not just as a religious head but as also a head of a state because the vatican is also a state speaking as a politician it's political demon and religious power a triuncard you have a three-stage ministry false prophet antichrist and peace hallelujah and the bride have a three-phase ministry too broadly kindness whole decency and place in christ and you have to find your place for this hour of battle that lays just ahead of us this is no game perilous time shall condition no blame people have been deceived outright the bible said all that dwell on the earth shall worship the beast whose names are not written in the lamb's book of the life that's why you should bless god god send a prophet messenger to bring [Applause] clarity hallelujah all these preachers hiding with false doctrine hiding it on the hidden mysteries bunch of foolishness when god tell habakkuk right division and make it plain that he that read it might run [Applause] glory does god not write the vision and make it more complicated make it more complex make it plain you may be seated after a while the disciples told jesus dawa speak to us plainly you're no longer speaking in parables he must deliberately speaking in purpose or purpose that others will hear and don't hear don't understand otherwise but then you begin to explain to them the mysteries explain to them and bring it simple after his ministry res in his resurrection ministry he came amongst them to open their understanding and to make play in the scriptures these were ignorant men these were illiterate men and when he was finished they knew what they were looking for they knew what to expect nobody would come and teach them and explain to them and reveal anything to them [Applause] [Music] so if you are bored amen because you're tired he has preaching the same thing and your ears itching here a little bit you have a scripture for that too silly woman

not trying to manufacture this fire we want the world to know we put in water that you will know it's god's fire that coming down from above we're not trying to manufacture a revive are we not trying to prove some point we are saying god is god he's going to answer by his power he's going to answer by fire by the baptism of the holy ghost and by fire or give the lord some praises that's what we come along to not just having books everybody have that not just having tears everybody have that but the god answer by fire oh hallelujah the one on hope upon whom you see that dove descending that's

don't judge yourself like what a lot of churches doing by not what is doing what his sister doing judging her by the word because got to get a word brand to face this enemy eve went from behind the word she was supposed to stay behind the word and tell that devil go back and come back and hit my husband but she dropped the guys and the whole plan was messed up and god promised her pride in the last days she's not going to drop no plans she's not going to get from away from the world she's going to stay with the world i'm convinced that the word is here i'm convinced that the world is in the people it doesn't manifest yet but they're gonna come out and make a live inside of you you don't even know what's locked up inside of you you think peter knew what was inside of him jesus saw him beside him that's why he could say after you converted strengthening brethren but before that knock the crook got the cockroach three times you'll deny me he saw peter denied him but he saw peter

chasing oh glory to god that's what i haven't seen it for this morning fire fire shut up in my bones glory to god the fire got to get out fire of god fire of god for glory that's how god cleanses prophets let me see that all god cleanses servants a bunch of intellectual people because they know reading writing and arithmetic communist intellectual age texan tablet phone what was it they can't do it all day right now you come like part of the beginning like what you have hand their phone is a mistake they almost won with it without phone they have no life do you need three days without that phone no text no calls no nothing to see how much you love the lord all your heart i saw something internet so crazy man coming for the livingston pastor faster praying for him and he started carrying on for long when he carried on the casa castle there was the phone ring take a before this hello he's someone in the anointing i'm under the anointing i tell you where he passes all right then he said he passed i will continue to continue pastor get vexed [Applause] but that's how ridiculous it is he's just acting there when the phone ring all your ideas up what are you doing my god hallelujah that's not what you want you really want to be connected to god let all these equipment and phone or whatever let it be a tool at all use but don't let that take the place of god wherever they are watching this and you're watching it and you're watching it like if you're watching the face of god don't do that hallelujah get in the spirit and recognize a call for a higher purpose they're called to be led by the spirit you know when i come into church today something come to me the whole object of ministering and preaching is to get out of the way i don't have to have a certain message and you know have certain things but the objective could god get this man out of the way that he could minister to the people that speak and get the needs met could we see that could we expect that that we said that we have to say this and say that and i'm trying to say this here is that god could take that man out of the way what would peter know what to preach when he went to cornelia's house he was just speaking testifying witnessing and why he spit these words the holy ghost fell upon them that heard the word why he was speaking the word he wasn't in charge he was an ambassador of the kingdom oh hallelujah he had the words from the king and when he was speaking the word of fire from the king fell upon the people peter was stunned because he recognized this holy ghost thing it's not only for the jews it's also for the gentiles come on same as somebody and we have a holy ghost thing it's holy ghost this holy ghost is not for the foolish version [Music] that some people like to study late when they have exams whole year they're not studying two days before they cram in the cramming cramming to pass don't do that with the oil in them don't go for last minute oil get the oil now the oil is the spirit but the spirit is the word get the word now wake up when the world and the spirit your bottle your oil falling over you have extra because you take the word the secret is the word is in the prime the oil is in the bride the word is in the brain he's not right your flesh might be desperate but the word is inside of you do you believe that how many believe that that the word is inside of you tough times ahead hard times and it's time to be locking with the word and you talk about because god expects maturity and then he could descript it when i was a child i speak like a child honestly the child and i like this part when i became a man i had just become a man because you could be a man and still childish you could be a man and still immature you could be a big woman and still very immature very childish playing games but he said when i became a man i put away childish things i put away childish things you have to do that because those childish things will grow with you [Music] hallelujah those childish things will continue with you you have to push it away because you say you you would more than that you could do better than that yes you could act better than that you could talk better than that yes you could reflect better than that oh hallelujah i put away childish things because you become a man you become responsible so you don't fool around no more you don't have to be on these games wilting no more you could put away childish things and press on into that adoption spirit i rent a few children i rent in a young man i write into you fathers the objective is to get it to fathers the objective is to get you into maturity because only mature sons can handle the kingdom and handle throneship and handle dominion and handle the pack out orders yes that's what god wants when god send the order they say yes sir [Music] [Applause] if god tell me to operate in argentina all i have to say yes sir could you speak the language yet no sir but god tell me go down there and open church there yes sir that's what we're talking about no question asked i'll go anywhere goes a minute ago hallelujah praise god no question to ask just do it hallelujah hallelujah that's what they told the people when they asked jesus about the wine wine run out do you say what have i do with that they say whatever you say just do it just do it just say it just do it he said draw some water and pour it out if it was intellect doing that what what is this is water and then pipe was there a pump punting it wasn't like you open a tap you have to do it there's water coming out you know wine it's water you've seen water anything but then when they start to pour pour it out when you pour think about it now they put water in the in the bottle and when the poor is running then this is a miracle he turned water no he didn't touch it he didn't lay the hands on the water as a dog giant in the name of jesus he didn't do nothing like that he just tell them draw water and pour oh how simple are you on that draw water and pour hallelujah lepers came to jesus he said go and show yourself to the priests while they went hallelujah wilder was walking while they were obeying very simple instruction go and show yourself to the priests they got healed one came back in worship it's that simple oh people make it comple it's that simple believers though this yet lord i believe oh it's that simple oh hallelujah praise god those brothers with that crippled brother that friend that they came on that pallet and they had no room to enter into the the church that jesus was in and they tore up the roof and let the man down they wasn't letting that man down to get that lecture until you hand him a track well bristol when you go home take a read of this and then listen to this tape here and so on and then pull him back up and let him back down on the other side let them listen to two tapes jesus wasn't talking that kind of talk this was the word active this was word and works i like that word and works this was word speaking he said well it is easier isn't that right to tell the man dyson before giving thee or pick up your bed and walk hallelujah and jesus will tell them pick up your bed and walk forget them pharisees forget all them sabbath keepers forget all them who think this is a sabbath day and you shouldn't do that forget that just walk walk walk hallelujah hallelujah praise god praise god jesus heal a blind man and the blind man the pharisees come the corner of the right mind who you're jesus he said no he's called him god he's a sinner he's a sinner he's a sinner the blind man says listen i don't know amen whether this man is a sinner or not but one thing i know i was blind but now i'm seen [Applause] and you can't take that from me because that is my testimony oh hallelujah how many want that kind of picture called to see the living god god going to work with you you know i feel the anointing all over the building you know you're leaving here with god this morning god upon you the spirit upon you smile rejoice laugh hallelujah shout raise your hands praise god hallelujah hallelujah let zion rejoice thy king comet hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen oh blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah hallelujah praise be to jesus hallelujah so the battery said try the spirits this man claim a certain thing try it see if it's right they claim it all kind of cuckoo revelation we don't remember the tried much and it's wrong it's false teachings much just for a manifestation wow watch this now if it is right then say lord send us something else keep moving just keep moving till every fellow take his place so we supposed to begin to see people coming into position isn't that right and god began to use them and anoint them and manifest themselves through them are we supposed to thank you lord send us some more send us some more send us some more send us some more and every son that gets his position is victory in the kingdom of god heaven rejoicing and shouting do you see all these silken seed devil children going to school shooting killing and everything else and he asked why satan is showing evidently what he can do with people under his control men with no conscience men that come out to do that well if men could be anointed to do such evil why god can anoint men to be anointed to do great good minds make a bigger shout than that i expect a bigger shout than that that last killing this week with those people getting killed the man on all kind of guns [Music] and people may get offended when i say when i open my jacket is all kind of weapons i have here what are you supposed to walk with slingshot rubber band what i will do i suppose you pulling rodriguez we supposed to be using every ammunition that we can to fight this great battle it's a tremendous battle you really think the devil will let us get into the third phase without the battle you really think the devil will let you find your place without a bathroom you have to cut them from the mountain [Applause] i'm not hearing you just what cut them off here cut them off here wipe them out there find them oh dear by god he was placed for the battle [Applause] let me be seated i am sick and tired of people who are not sick and tired [Applause] you gotta get fed up with you you gotta get tired of you you gotta say you know what no more pig food i will arise i will go back to my father's house come on seven sir hallelujah stop backsiding stop backsliding repent come back to your father's house [Applause] let me see this nut house father's house when you're walking back to your father's house as crippled as broken as backslidden as hungry as poor as miserable as you're looking the servants in that house get at you you could be walking drunk but they can't touch you because it's your father's house you can be tight but you're going back to your father's house i will arrive i will say unto my father i have sinned i am no longer worthy to be called your son or give the lord a shout remember or in that realm of humiliation in that realm of shame of what he did in his realm of self-condemnation he's viewing himself insufficient not even worthy to be called a son but in the father's room the coat get ready the car get it ready the drinks get it ready the anchar and roti get it ready get the chan ready get everything ready we gonna have a party because my son that was lost i'm not hearing you this morning i'm not hearing you this morning my son i was lost it's not being found [Applause] what a difference what are they from umbc what's the difference you know people view people want to cut them off [Applause] easy to cut them off i had the next message to preach and i want to do it so much but it just won't work out this is what i got for this morning it's a powerful jascape of two sons would the father give instructions to those things the first son said i will do it and he didn't do it does that sound say i will not do it and he went and do it and just say which one was righteous they said the one who did it and jesus blessed them he said you pharisees those highlights and prostitutes will enter the kingdom before you so you hear somebody say i will not do it but they're going to do it and in my champion you say they're going to do it they don't do it amen god looking for those who want to do his will we love the father the will not of the church of the father you're getting reconnected to god you're not a church man you're god man son of god oh hallelujah because jesus was our example son and he taught us how to deal with this battle how to overcome by the word because the word here we go will defeat the devil anywhere anytime any place under any condition just a word or give the lord a shout how many believe that but it's better or not you trust the world [Applause] bake me a cake first elijah told her with a woman she obeyed and she would dust says the lord is it that simple is it that easy that we can't seem to follow through hallelujah joshua tell the levites to cross jordan and those guys in simplicity just walk towards the high water and as soon as soon as their feet touch jordan jordan open up listen if the feet didn't touch it it doesn't could loop now you don't need to feel your foot you need to exercise your feet you can't wait for it to happen for you to believe you have to believe before it happened i'm not hearing you i am not hearing you that's why the true hebrew boys are so powerful this is what god is able to deliver us but if he doesn't deliver us we still will not bow down oh hallelujah they will rock on their own testimony they rock back on their own faith they were fearless but abraham said wormwood wanted to come now and pour water and what the angel for water want to out the fire god said no no no no i don't have to go down myself this fate that these brothers have i have to go down myself no angel going down to join the young guys i want to shake their hand for their faith and their testimony amidst fiery trials glory give the lord a shout so i miss your child god want to come now because of your faith and your testimony i won't be alone with you again my lord my lord my lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god prepare for war hallelujah praise peter jesus it's going to be the virtues versus every other thing every other pure spirit of faith and red and orange and green and all the virtues all the colors it could be that pure color that gonna be christ christ in the form of evangelist christ in the form of a pastor christ in the form of apostle christ we have to see christ christ have to be in these men that is why there's a fifo ministry yet as much as people want to say it have it now that's not true it takes dynamics to produce a fifo ministry it take the interview because that is god's selection but abraham said when the son is born the holy spirit is sent as a tutor and the holy spirit here we go reports to the father your behavior not the doctrine your behavior so based upon your behavior how is he coming along father asked the question he's like a chip off the old block then the holy spirit the father said give him some more years not some more days drop some years on him you see because time disproves a lot of things young people jump up and say they believe after 10 years they believe not so god is through time hallelujah put time over things and see how you make out see how you mature show your right and sell your girl in a youthful day just say things they should not not to say act away or to act as they grow mature you get more sense get more wisdom at least you're supposed to some do some don't at least you're supposed to if you don't well you're in trouble because let him that lack wisdom ask god who give it liberally i don't know why people are asking god for things ask for great things acts of big things i don't know why people just chinks and jinxing that come like say a mouse in egypt taking one grain at a time and say you think i should think i should eat some more i have a whole big thing and the most chinks and chicks do chings you got plenty food amen hallelujah eat and be satisfied eat and be filled with plenty people just want a little drip let your cup run over and ask god stop asking for blessings and the things in your glass say god let my cup run over [Applause] some people are so selfish all they want is for the self all they see is about themselves that's all because you feel that you would you would lose see look in this stuck up you feel you wouldn't have but when you're coming to your selflessness and to serve god you give and god could put your cup to run over so much that you have so much so much more than you have that you could afford to share with whoever you want and begin to give and the more you give is the more god give you because god love a giver god loves a giver and he gives you that you could give others because you can't give what you don't have god i have to give you that you can give others give the lord a shout always help somebody always pull somebody up somebody want to examine people you don't want to share it with them because you feel they pass you they don't need you to pass you you share it anyhow and then you got blessed until you know what that person said thank you for sharing that exam people with me thank you for sharing what you know with me could that help me and i'm grateful but you you want to come first are you first in training but you last in the world all understand you know every time i have a bad man always somebody bothering him oh shoot everybody shooter always what that's why don't you play no bad man there's always somebody on you look at goliath one man hola israel all of them should have said let me all get slingshots i want thousand slingshots and this big stone next morning and god everybody's speaking so i suggested a suburb after getting ten thousand big stones but because this one man challenged all of them all them frightened and fearful i'm glad have you upper edge 40 days 14 nights send me a man he know nobody ain't coming can nobody big like me big and bad until david heard them and when david heard him david didn't see his size they would see a big target and saw a big god davis ikea missed that target he took victims just let me get my stone don't get me started inside of you only get me started inside i can't miss that big ugly target how could i miss that target bullseye hallelujah that man was prepared for the battle that man was placed whole by land and beer not by reading poems in the backside of the desert not by reading psalms and poetry not by reading books and listening to tips and hearing gospel that's not how he conquered that goliath he conquered the bear a real bear roar that bingo big guy real lion no no people they say your head cutting off too okay forget the laws and praises and that's the kind of confidence that's the kind of faith that's the kind of attitude i want you to have if the lord be with me i shall be able to drive them out give the lord a shout in the house glory to god if god is with you god is with you start to child them out shive all the hittites drive out the chevy sides travel the lost drive it out [Applause] you have a gravel in prayer i call it gravel in prayer will you pray hardy coming out lord god yes you get to know where shake that off tell yourself that's not stop don't call your praying like that begin to talk different lord i coming home to you amen anoint me to praying getting that gear that you communicate with your father hallelujah in a certain way that the father understands you mean business yes you you mean business oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god it makes you walk different you talk different you act different god want to see his sons in performance he wants to see his sons comfort he want that he's not getting a fight some father's a problem with sons some mothers are probably with daughters getting fight and whatnot some mothers trying to keep up with the daughters look like their daughters and whatnot because they you know want to be young again and whatnot they said no the time passed already and they're in trouble but god is not like that god like sons just like him walk like him talk like him act like him live like him do the same works he did god loved that so he began to drop all these things on peter same works i do shall it also drop it on them promises they can't even handle that but you're dropping it on them if you shall say this mountain be moved and don't talk in your heart you keep dropping it on them hallelujah why because it belonged to them that's their redemptive right come on same as somebody god is not trying to force something on you no we gonna get down here no listen listen listen listen if you're a son and you're not interested in your father's business you're still a son not the question you know the question is that your sonship the question is if you're gonna get inheritance that's different to your son your son you're saved you see it good but then what you're called to do jesus age 13 i must be about my father's business so it has a consciousness an awareness that there's a higher purpose hallelujah forgive us our sins as we forgive those who trespass against us he asked for forgiveness all that he wasn't showing him how to pray how to operate and everything else isn't that right all right and connect with the father's business so i come to do father's business to finish the work what is the work we have to do call for our fallen brothers and sisters we have to go until the last name come in there are people we have to reach and we can't reach with books and tapes we have to reach with the thunder that shakes the devil when you walk devil might be here and you're coming like

mystery of god god in you the hope of glory shining for the baptism of the holy ghost when men back in other ages fought for truth fought for truth fought for justification fought for sanctification we got to do the same thing oh hallelujah praise god look at mystery babylon leading people by denominations with a cup of iniquity of man-made doctrine pulling them away from the fountain filled with blood where the power of almighty god was free to manifest jesus christ that's true but he will come when he comes when that come to pass the word is finished there's only one thing left another seven thunders we don't know but it would not have thundered in vain go on don't do something just to be plain we play and act silly but not god everything with god is a and a he doesn't just fool he doesn't kid he means what he says and seven thunders right in the revelation of jesus christ is some mystery does not the bible says the revelation of jesus christ there is some hidden mystery then of it what is it the seven thunders have it for john was about to write and he said don't write it put it in the box of the book it's got to be revealed it's the mysteries these little organizations i think i think god has been in it the whole thing but because we are different each man sees different each person sees different no two minds is exactly the same no two people is exactly the same no two noses no two thumbprints we are made different we should have different groups we should have different groups god always work with an individual he don't save you because you're methodist he doesn't save you because you're baptist he doesn't save you because you're pentecostal he saves you because he has dealt personally with you and you are saved on that basis and you have accepted it so therefore god could deal with you he doesn't deal with you in the order of his church he deal with you as an individual therefore when god sent forth prophets his messenger of the testament he spoke to one man and that man had to bring the message others went from him everywhere bringing the same message but they had to have one headquarters god has always had it i'm thankful he has got it tonight and that's the holy ghost the headquarters is what the holy ghost not some group amen but the holy spirit is god headquarters that is god's messenger of the hour like some ministers feel like co-pilot because some brother want people to connect to them him and if they're not connected to him you're not in the bride and by that connection they're screwing up the sovereignty of the local church and the people having less respect for their own local minister because they believe connecting to this brother or whoever brother is connecting to the bride and the faithful ministry which is foolishness amen but abraham said that he didn't did not say that he said we are we are desperate as individuals we should have different groups isn't that right and the holy spirit is god headquarters that's god messenger we are so we're not supposed to be hearing horizontally from this minister and this church no we suppose he ain't vertically coming from heaven coming from above and as we hear from god we give it out to the people flesh and blood had not revealed it unto you but my father had revealed it upon you isn't that right hallelujah glory to god but abram is it true that every jew born since christ shall be saved no nothing will be saved only those whose names are put on the line book of life jew or gentiles the book holds the mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it is calling its names the book doesn't say level is to be saved or omar neville it just shows the mystery and we by faith believe it i want to finish get to this year then i'll wrap up from the fourth seal we had in coming last night the great sword we find out he gets and killed with the sword too he said wait till them seven thunders utter the voices of that group who can really take the word of god and hand the deal it will slice and cut they can close the heavens they can shut this do whatever i want to do he will be slayed by the word that proceeds from his mouth it's sharper than a twitch sword they call for a hundred billion tons of flies if they wanted to whatever they say is going to happen god uses man here we go listen to this now we find out this satan after being kicked out of heaven incarnates himself in the beast no he's a beast antichrist false prophet no beast and given the name of death and hell follows him fully satan on his throne he is satan's representative on the earth he is now head of the kingdoms of the world the very same kingdoms he offered the lord jesus in matthew 4 satan now becomes full king now this happens later on listen to the prophet he is false prophet now he will become beast after a while when he breaks the covenant with the jews notice he will be given a heart of a beast at that time and satan will incarnate himself because when the church goes up satan is cast down so that is for the tribulation and that is for the remnant of the people who miss the bride they're going to be facing that beast system so the nice man is nice now but at that time he'd be given a heart of a beast oh hallelujah oh glory to god and i am thinking that the great enemy of the christian society today is organized churches amen i do believe in all my heart it will finally form me to the mark of the beast which i can think and prove you see once this is organized it's human hand in it it's not spirit covenant then the ministers can't preach what they feel like to preach they have to preach what despite to them so some man telling them what the inspiration is what they should say what they shouldn't say what they should preach what they shouldn't preach that is human so man is no longer led by the spirit he is led by another human who thinks he's some king somewhere so watch every time that man made an organization the spirit of god left it never did return it grown in members but never now weakness in the spirit the battle started in heaven but it will be finished on earth in the form of armageddon now let's watch it unfold here we go this mysterious rider this is the pilot rider 14. opposes refuse to repent and go back to the original blood word amen the word become blood and flesh he refused to go back to it it is antichrist the true word bride he opposed the true word bride takes his own bride he takes his own bride and brings her to him in the form of religion called creeds and dogmas and now seeing the holy bride he's against her he forms his own bride called antichrist by antichrist teaching which is contrary to christ notice the antichrist refuses the true by his doctrine take his own bride and they don't they don't say they belong to ch and they don't say that they don't belong to church you talk to the national person sure i belong to church are you a christian question i belong to church that don't have one thing to do with it we ask people in a message are you a christian no i believe this i believe i believe the same thing i didn't answer if you believe the same thing are you a christian a christian is to be christ-like and if you're not christ like as a christian you find yourself hooked up in second timothy tree one to eight eddie high-minded lovers of pleasures bad behavior hateful bad attitude and you're in church with books and tapes saying you believe brother branham [Music] so watch he said those are lodges you're only one church that's the mystical body of christ you don't join that you're born in it i've said i've been with a branham family 53 years and never to join it i was born into it so every sign every wonder anointed man prophecy all kind of things going forward all kinds of signs all kind of wonders how are you going to tell the difference watch the word for this hour watch moses how we could have told bayla what's my car how you know he was right the word before him had prophesied that for her and people don't want to go back to brother branham's message but that is the word the prophet word for the hour that's the only way we could judge things to take it back to the world people not supposed to judge me by who i associate with they're supposed to judge me by how i stay with the word hallelujah not where i go but how i stay with the word isn't that right and the word before us prophesied these organizations for this day and this curse upon them and the thing that would take place his truly anointed church will have the word a word bride here we have here it is today just the way it is so watch the antichrist spirit is heading up to a head the word bride is heading up to the person of the word of god made manifest it means so much to us to see our selves positionally placed in christ jesus okay could take a little more i'm going to wrap up now paul said that the word came in power as well as voice [Music] the word preached actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cotton sword it went to the consciousness of men like a sailor's knife it cut out diseases and set kept us free everywhere those early believers went they went preaching the gospel word and god confirmed that word with signs following the sick were healed devil were cast out they spoke with new tongues that was the word in action the word never failed in the mouth of believing christians and in this last age it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride oh little flock you little minority hold on to the word fill your mouth and heart with it and one day god will give you the kingdom or give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah jesus said believers though not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but my father that dwelleth in me he do at the works now listen to this as we close here it is evidently set forth that the perfect manifestation of god in the sun was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works that is exactly what we have been teaching all along when here we go as we close when the bride will get back to being a weird bride she will produce the very works that jesus produced may the lord bless you praise god let's all stand hallelujah to come and sing and worship i'll be close see you this evening come and fit believing may the lord bless you [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh one what question soul is marching as to war [Music] with the cross of jesus going on before for christ the royal master who leads against the [Music] singing on what christian soul is marching as to go with the cross of jesus going on before let's sing one more verse sing in the light oh my god he moves the church of god moves the church oh god brothers we are treading brothers we are dread where the saints have trod [Applause] we are not divided we are gone all one body we all one body one in hope conduction [Music] of jesus will marching as to [Music] christian soldiers on one christian soul is marching as to walk [Music] with the cross of christian soldiers [Applause] gotta sing it again on what christian soldiers marching as to the cross of jesus
