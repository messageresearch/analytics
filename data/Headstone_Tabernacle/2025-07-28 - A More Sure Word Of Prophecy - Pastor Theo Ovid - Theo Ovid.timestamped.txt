[21:37] [Music]
[21:38] We are here this morning to give him
[21:41] praise. Lord, let you bless your welcome
[21:44] to the house of the Lord. If you have
[21:46] your Bibles, let's turn to the Psalms
[21:50] for scripture reading. Psalms chapter
[21:54] 118 we'd like to read from and we would
[21:59] start from verse 14
[22:03] for scripture reading. Amen.
[22:06] [Music]
[22:08] Amen.
[22:09] [Music]
[22:11] Psalms 118
[22:13] and verse14
[22:15] says, "The Lord is my strength and my
[22:17] song and is become my salvation.
[22:23] The voice of rejoicing and salvation is
[22:26] in the tabernacles of the righteous. The
[22:29] right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly.
[22:33] The right hand of the Lord is exalted.
[22:36] The right hand of the Lord doeth
[22:38] valiantly.
[22:40] I shall not die, but live, and declare
[22:44] the works of the Lord. The Lord had
[22:47] chastened me so, but he had not given me
[22:50] over unto them. Open to me the gates of
[22:54] righteousness.
[22:55] I will go into them, and I will praise
[22:58] the Lord. This gate of the Lord into
[23:02] which the righteous shall enter. I will
[23:05] praise thee for thou has heard me and
[23:09] art become my salvation. The stone which
[23:12] the builders refuse has become the
[23:15] headstone of the corner. This is the
[23:18] Lord's doing. It is marvelous in our
[23:21] eyes. This is the day which the Lord
[23:23] hath made. We will rejoice and be glad
[23:27] in it. May God add blessing to the
[23:30] reading of his word. Let us bow our
[23:33] heads.

[43:32] [Music]
[43:37] Let
[43:39] Bow our heads for a word of prayer.
[43:42] Father, we thank you for your divine
[43:45] love for your presence in such difficult
[43:49] times.
[43:50] We know it's dead to be out of your
[43:52] presence is life to come into your
[43:55] presence and how you have sent your
[43:57] angels to drive us back to that tree of
[44:00] life. You said that I come that you
[44:03] might have life and have it more
[44:05] abundantly. Father, may that abundant
[44:07] life drop down here this morning to
[44:09] every heart, to every son, every
[44:11] daughter, every bride, every sister,
[44:14] that something would be done or said
[44:15] that will transform their lives forever.
[44:18] May no one leave the same way that they
[44:20] came.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; But may the Holy Spirit, the revealer of
[44:25] the word, come and inspire,
[44:28] Lord, and confirm your word with signs,
[44:30] wonders, and miracles. May devils be
[44:33] cast out, unclean spirits leave,
[44:37] &gt;&gt; God and hearts transformed by the fire
[44:39] of God.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; We are dependent on you, Lord. Take me
[44:44] out of the way and be you, may you be
[44:46] glorified and magnified in our midst.
[44:48] And at the end of it, we'll give you all
[44:50] the praise and glory. We ask in Jesus
[44:53] name. Amen.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you and welcome. God bless
[44:55] you. It's good to be here this morning.
[44:58] Greeting to all those connected to us on
[45:00] the internet. We welcome you to our
[45:02] Sunday morning service. So before you
[45:04] take your seats, I want you to turn your
[45:05] Bibles to St. John chapter 1, 2 Peter
[45:08] chapter 1, and St. Mark 16 for scripture
[45:10] reading. Oh, praise the name of the
[45:13] Lord. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of
[45:16] the Lord. St. John chapter 1, we want to
[45:19] read from 29-37.
[45:21] 2 Peter chapter 1, we want to read from
[45:23] 16-21.
[45:25] And St. Mark chapter 16 15- 20.
[45:30] Oh, praise God. Just keep remembering
[45:33] prayer for those believers that are in
[45:35] Puerto Rico
[45:37] who up to two weeks now. Uh lights, no
[45:40] lights and water and everything else.
[45:42] It's terrible situation, but we trust
[45:45] God be their guide and comfort and help
[45:47] and shield.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[45:52] So, readings in John chapter 1 29. The
[45:56] next day John seeth Jesus coming unto
[45:58] him and seeth, behold the lamb of God,
[46:00] which taketh away the sin of the world.
[46:03] This is he of whom I said, After me
[46:06] cometh a man which is preferred before
[46:08] me, for he was before me, and I knew him
[46:13] not, but he that should made manifest to
[46:16] Israel, therefore am I come baptizing
[46:18] with water. And John bear records,
[46:21] saying, I saw the Spirit descending from
[46:24] heaven like a dove, and it abodeed upon
[46:27] him. And I knew him not, but he that
[46:30] sent me to baptize with water. The same
[46:33] said unto me, Upon whom thou shall see
[46:37] the spirit, but he that sent me to
[46:38] baptize with water. The same said unto
[46:41] me
[46:43] shall see the spirit descending and rem.
[46:47] The same is the Holy Ghost. And I saw
[46:51] and bear record that this is the son of
[46:54] God. Again, the next day after John
[46:57] stood and two of the disciples and
[47:00] looking upon Jesus as he walked, he
[47:02] said, "Behold the lamb of God and the
[47:05] two disciples heard him speak and they
[47:08] followed Jesus." Second Peter 1, want to
[47:12] read from verse 16.
[47:16] For we have not followed connally
[47:18] devised fables when we made known unto
[47:21] you the power and coming of our Lord
[47:23] Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of
[47:26] his majesty. For he received from God
[47:28] the Father honor and glory. When there
[47:31] came such a voice to him from the
[47:33] excellent glory, this is my beloved son
[47:35] in whom I am well pleased. And this
[47:37] voice which came from heaven, we heard
[47:40] when we would were with him in the holy
[47:42] mount. We have also a more sure word of
[47:46] prophecy where unto you do well that you
[47:49] may take heed as unto a light that
[47:51] shineth in the dark place until the day
[47:53] dawn and the day star arise in your
[47:56] hearts. Knowing this first that no
[47:58] prophecy of the scripture is of any
[48:01] private interpretation for the prophecy
[48:03] came not in old time by the will of man
[48:06] but holy men of God spake as they were
[48:08] moved by the Holy Ghost. Last scripture
[48:11] we're going to have Mark 16 verse 15 to
[48:14] 20 Jesus is speaking and he said unto
[48:16] them go into all the world and preach
[48:19] the gospel to every creature.
[48:23] 16 He that believeth and is baptized
[48:26] shall be saved, but he that believeth
[48:29] not shall be damned. And these signs
[48:33] shall follow them that believe. In my
[48:36] name shall they cast out devils. They
[48:38] shall speak with new tongues. They shall
[48:40] take up serpents, and if they drink any
[48:42] deadly thing, it shall not hurt them.
[48:44] They shall lay hands on the sick, and
[48:46] they shall recover. So then, after the
[48:48] Lord had spoken unto them, he was
[48:50] received up into heaven and sat on the
[48:51] right hand of God, and they went forth
[48:54] and preached everywhere, the Lord
[48:56] working with them, and confirming the
[48:58] word with signs following. Amen. May God
[49:00] bless his word. You may be seated. Oh,
[49:02] praise God. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[49:10] Lord. There's a song. Let's sing.
[49:12] Through it all.
[49:14] Hallelujah.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Through it all,
[49:19] I learned
[49:22] &gt;&gt; I learned to trust in God.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Huh? You love him?
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Through it all.
[49:30] [Music]
[49:33] &gt;&gt; I learn to depend upon his word.
[49:36] [Music]
[49:41] So what you going to do?
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Well, I thank God for the mountains.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; I thank God for the valleys.
[49:52] I thank God for the things I've been
[49:56] through.
[49:59] If I never have a problem, oh, but if I
[50:02] never had a problem,
[50:06] &gt;&gt; I never know that God can solve them. I
[50:10] never know what faith in his word can
[50:13] do.
[50:16] That's why we sing through it all.
[50:20] through it all.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; I learn to trust I learn to trust in
[50:28] Jesus.
[50:30] I learn to trust in God. Oh, through it
[50:35] all.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Through it all. Hallelujah.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, I learned to depend upon his word.
[50:49] Are you going to depend upon his word
[50:50] this morning?
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God. This morning I have a title
[50:59] and the title is a more sure word of
[51:01] prophecy.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; A more sure word of prophecy.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; I have a subject changing from the
[51:11] prophet to the prophecy.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Another inspiration, the Lord
[51:18] himself.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. The Lord
[51:22] &gt;&gt; himself.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Have a context scripture and you have to
[51:26] find it is on 1 Thessalonians 4. It
[51:28] says, "But I would not have you to be
[51:30] ignorant, brethren, concerning them
[51:31] which are asleep."
[51:33] Talking about people that have died on
[51:35] and gone on before or loved ones that we
[51:37] sorrow, we sorrow not as others who have
[51:40] no hope.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. For if we believe that Jesus died
[51:44] and rose again, even so them also which
[51:47] sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; For this we say unto you by the will of
[51:51] the Lord, that we which alive remain
[51:53] shall not hinder
[51:56] them or prevent them which are asleep.
[51:58] For the Lord himself,
[52:00] &gt;&gt; shall descend from heaven with a shout
[52:03] &gt;&gt; with the voice of the archangel and with
[52:06] the trump of God and the dead in Christ
[52:08] shall rise first. Then we which are
[52:10] alive and remain shall be caught up
[52:13] together with them in the clouds to meet
[52:16] the Lord in the air. And so shall we
[52:18] ever be with the Lord. Comfort one
[52:21] another with these words.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Comfort one another with these words.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; This is not the only world.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; We are leaving here.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Ready or not, this is not the only
[52:31] world. We're going to be out of here
[52:34] &gt;&gt; soon.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Soon. That's how I feel. Let us say it
[52:39] soon.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; We'll be out of here.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; A thousand years is us one day in his
[52:43] sight.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; So 70 years is
[52:47] &gt;&gt; it's like a pith.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And you feel you're here
[52:50] for a long time, right? You're not here
[52:52] for a long time.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; So do what you're supposed to do when
[52:57] you have the strength to do it.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Do all that you could do.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Do right because you choose to do right.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; When others do you wrong, still do
[53:06] right.
[53:07] Forgive because you choose to forgive.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Love. When they hate you, still love.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; When you feel they don't deserve it,
[53:13] still do it.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Do what's right.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Do what's good. Do what's true. Amen.
[53:19] You're going to come out right. Oh, give
[53:21] the Lord some praises, people.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. This is brother
[53:27] Brandon from Message Experiences. He
[53:29] said, "Now, when the angel of the Lord
[53:30] speaks like that, there's nothing can
[53:34] stand before it."
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is absolute
[53:38] &gt;&gt; my faith. Well, I know it's going to
[53:40] happen. There's no need of seeing any
[53:43] more of it. It's got to happen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; If that person had been dead and in the
[53:49] grave for 20 years,
[53:51] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Go there and speak."
[53:54] &gt;&gt; I believe,
[53:55] &gt;&gt; amen.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; All heaven would shake out of its orbit
[53:58] &gt;&gt; before that prayer would be refused
[54:01] &gt;&gt; from being answered.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; God will do it. Now that is really when
[54:06] it is thus sayeth the lord.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; So when a word is pronounced over your
[54:10] life
[54:11] &gt;&gt; and it's th does say the lord
[54:13] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the doctor say,
[54:15] &gt;&gt; what your mother say, what your father
[54:18] say, what the neighbor say, what the
[54:20] boss say. It has nothing to do. Not even
[54:23] your sin could stop it. It's thus sayeth
[54:26] the Lord. Your failures can't stop it.
[54:29] Your fears can't stop it. Your weakness
[54:31] can't stop it. What happened last night,
[54:33] last year, last 20 years, nothing going
[54:36] to stop it. He said in this word, he
[54:39] said, "My word shall not return unto me
[54:43] for it,
[54:44] &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish
[54:46] &gt;&gt; the purpose that I set it for
[54:49] &gt;&gt; to accomplish."
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Could we give the Lord a praise
[54:51] offering?
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:57] Amen.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; When we come to these meetings,
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; I detect vibrations.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I can ask the vibrations and
[55:07] God will honor my prayer. He will send
[55:09] it away. That's true. But if there's
[55:11] anything between you and God and you
[55:14] don't make it right, it's your faith
[55:17] that is weak.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; You're just waiting for a slow line for
[55:21] that to be cast away. Now, if your faith
[55:24] isn't right, it will return right back
[55:27] to you.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; I have moved out to a place for I have
[55:30] prayed for them and I've kept this back
[55:32] from you, but I pray for them coming
[55:34] through the line and set them down
[55:36] somewhere and walk back in 15 minutes
[55:39] time to check them and it'll be back on
[55:41] them again.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; So, in the spirit realm, what Abraham is
[55:44] talking about praying for people and
[55:45] tell them sit right there.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; It leave them 15 minutes check it back
[55:51] on them again. Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Your faith is the only thing that can do
[55:58] you any good.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Your belief, your faith in God. See what
[56:03] I mean? Without faith is impossible. Is
[56:05] that true? Now, you believe it with all
[56:07] your heart and when you come true, you
[56:10] are going to be well and you will get
[56:12] well. If you don't believe it, it won't
[56:15] get well. No matter what happens, you
[56:17] won't be healed unless you believe it
[56:19] with all your heart.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. How many want to believe
[56:24] this morning with all dear heart?
[56:28] &gt;&gt; God could heal your body.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; God could heal your spirit. And God
[56:32] could heal your soul.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Could somebody say amen?
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; I want to say that here again because
[56:38] some of you sick. Sick in body, sick in
[56:40] spirit, sick in mind, sick in heart,
[56:42] sick in soul, whatever. But God can heal
[56:44] you. God could deliver you.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; The demons that affecting your life
[56:48] could leave today.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; If you want deliverance, you could have
[56:51] that today.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; The word go forth with power.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; The word go forth with vindication.
[56:57] Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise. And
[56:59] today we have a sure word of prophecy.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; It's a sure word. It can't fail.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; God can't lie. God is not a man.
[57:07] Whatever he say got to come to pass.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[57:13] Oh, hallelujah.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; As we said, the thing last service we
[57:20] preaching or when you get saved, God put
[57:22] a light in a little button, you get the
[57:23] Holy Ghost, a little small button. And
[57:25] as much as you surrender yourself, as
[57:27] much as you expand and get make room,
[57:30] that light will grow inside of you. As
[57:32] much you throw bitterness, you throw
[57:34] this, you're giving that light to take
[57:35] over your entire being
[57:37] &gt;&gt; until you reflect God. Isn't that right?
[57:39] So, there's nothing wrong with the
[57:40] light, is the reflection. Isn't that
[57:42] right?
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the G. Praise the name. It's how
[57:45] much you yield yourself.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And that light is not to be
[57:49] choked. Isn't that right? That light is
[57:51] not even for a bushel.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; That light is not to be hidden. That
[57:54] light is a step forward. When God give
[57:56] you something, it's not for you.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; It's a shine to someone else.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the L. Isn't that right?
[58:02] &gt;&gt; And and and praise God. Blessed be. And
[58:05] in Luke 22:32, Jesus told Peter, "The
[58:08] devil want to save you like wheat."
[58:10] &gt;&gt; But I prayed for you that your faith
[58:13] &gt;&gt; fail not.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Because faith is the currency
[58:17] &gt;&gt; that purchase everything from God.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Not your long tears, not your balling
[58:21] and your beaten up. That doesn't move
[58:23] God. If you have faith behind your
[58:25] tears, that's fine.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; If you have faith behind your emotions,
[58:28] that is also fine. But the thing that
[58:30] going to move God is your faith. Amen.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; When God looking to answer, you're
[58:33] looking with the currency of faith.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; You don't you're not asking how long
[58:37] you're serving the Lord. Has nothing to
[58:39] do with that.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; You could be whatever. Once you have
[58:42] faith, there's got to be a response
[58:45] because faith is a six sense. Faith get
[58:47] come from down here. Faith from up
[58:49] there. Oh, give the Lord a shout
[58:52] &gt;&gt; in the house. Oh, glory to God.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're frightened, do it
[58:57] anyhow. You're fearful, step out anyhow.
[59:00] You're not sure you're going to work
[59:01] out, make a move anyhow. But don't stand
[59:04] there and die.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Do something. Oh, give the Lord a shout
[59:09] &gt;&gt; in the house. Glory to God.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Stephen. Hallelujah.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; I refuse to stand still and die.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; I'm going to die if I had to be
[59:19] pressing.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. I had to be pushing. I had to
[59:22] be overcoming. Got to do something.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Doing nothing is not an option.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Doing nothing is not an
[59:30] option.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; These signs shall follow. Damn that
[59:34] believe.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Are you a believer?
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Signs going to follow you.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Are you a believer?
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Science's going to follow you.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Thursday night, I ask a question to the
[59:57] prayer meeting. What's choking you? What
[59:59] is choking your life? What is choking
[1:00:02] your Christian life? Your you walk
[1:00:04] something choking it.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; You don't have the flow.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; You don't have the freedom. You don't
[1:00:08] have the liberty. Something choking it.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; And the first parable Jesus gave was the
[1:00:12] son of man is a swer and the seed is the
[1:00:14] word.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Some fell among thorns.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Some fell on the wayside. Some on the
[1:00:19] wayside. Devil come and take it away.
[1:00:20] Some fell on rocks. They jump for a
[1:00:22] while. They shout for a while. They
[1:00:24] smile for a while. Then they gone
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; because they have no roots. Amen.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; So it means there's a process
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; for this word to take a hold.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; It have to take roots.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; You can't just come and hear and devil
[1:00:35] take it out your head.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Take it out your mind.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; But you have to have roots.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; And when they get roots, the devil can't
[1:00:40] go down inside that.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; It's too deep inside there.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; What the devil could do is tie up
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; with vines of cares of natural stuff.
[1:00:51] Tie up
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; that you try and get choked.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; He can't stop you coming forth. Amen.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; And we say brick producer focal corn
[1:00:58] with one grain on it. You don't want
[1:01:00] that. You want to see 50fold. You want
[1:01:02] to see 60fold. You want to see 80fold.
[1:01:05] You want to see 100fold. No farmer
[1:01:07] planting one grain to get back one
[1:01:09] grain. Oh, come on now. Don't kind of
[1:01:11] waste a time farmer. No farmer salt will
[1:01:14] plant one grain and expect one grain to
[1:01:17] come back. Oh, come on. Give the Lord a
[1:01:19] shout. And when God plant you,
[1:01:25] when God plant you, he want more than
[1:01:28] that. That to your faith virtue and to
[1:01:31] virtue, knowledge and knowledge,
[1:01:33] temperance, and patience and godliness.
[1:01:36] Hallelujah.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; And Jesus, he Luke 17, he said, "As it
[1:01:41] was in the days of son of man, so shall
[1:01:43] it be in the as it was in the days of
[1:01:44] Noah. As was in days of Lot, so shall it
[1:01:47] be in the coming of days of the son of
[1:01:48] man. They eat, they drank, normal
[1:01:50] living. They married, they giving in
[1:01:52] marriage until the day
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; that came out.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; So there was no visible sign of anything
[1:01:58] happening in the spiritual realm.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; People was going to work, going and draw
[1:02:02] the pig, go and pay the NIS, go and pay
[1:02:04] the tax, go and buy this, go and buy
[1:02:06] groceries, go and put out the garbage
[1:02:08] and so on. Normal living,
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; normal living. But in the spirit realm,
[1:02:13] something was happening
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; because there's a prophecy that have to
[1:02:17] stand.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Nothing going to change that prophecy.
[1:02:20] In the spirit realm, something was
[1:02:22] happening.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; So don't just sit around and say normal
[1:02:25] living. You come here this morning, you
[1:02:27] dress your clothes this morning, you
[1:02:28] come to church this morning, normal
[1:02:30] living. That's why you come to give God
[1:02:32] praise. You come to get out the normal.
[1:02:34] God going to mash up your normal. Oh,
[1:02:36] say amen somebody.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Say normal.
[1:02:43] Hallelujah.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Don't give God no normal this morning.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; A normal shakehead, a normal little
[1:02:49] Amen. You sit down, you just wear your
[1:02:51] hand. Just forget all of that. Do
[1:02:53] something different. When them brothers
[1:02:55] saw Messiah coming donkey, they thosanna
[1:03:00] hosana hosana atmosphere in Jerusalem.
[1:03:04] All them priests, who is this? Who is

[1:03:08] that was all excited with the faith to
[1:03:10] announce the heraldine of Messiah coming
[1:03:13] lowly upon a donkey. And one day the
[1:03:16] Holy Ghost going to come riding on in.
[1:03:19] It's prophesy. Praise God. He shall
[1:03:21] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
[1:03:24] fire. And this morning we have a show of
[1:03:27] prophecy. Oh, give the Lord some shouts
[1:03:30] in the house.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; I say the spirit is upon you this
[1:03:33] morning.
[1:03:39] [Music]
[1:03:42] Hallelujah.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; That's why you can't afford to use the
[1:03:46] intellect.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Why would we be preaching that this
[1:03:49] morning? If I use that scripture this
[1:03:50] morning,
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; I don't even know why.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; I don't question why
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; it come and I come and speak it.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; You might feel I supposed to say
[1:03:59] something else and preach something else
[1:04:00] or what not. Sorry. This is what I offer
[1:04:03] this morning.
[1:04:04] And you have to ride with it.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God. They eat, they drank, they
[1:04:11] bought, they sold.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; But something was happening.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Abraham the elected.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; On the back side of the desert,
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; revealing the hidden plans,
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; revealing the hidden mystery
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; that Sodom is finished.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; It is judged
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; just to be sentenced. Hallelujah.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; He says, "Shall I hide from Abraham what
[1:04:36] I'm about to do?"
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "I can't hide it."
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Seeing is the air of the earth. I can't
[1:04:41] hold back from my elect what I'm about
[1:04:43] to unfold. What I'm about to reveal, I
[1:04:46] have to reveal the prophecy. And the
[1:04:48] angel said, "Seal not the saints of the
[1:04:52] prophecy of this book because the time
[1:04:54] is at hand. Time for the seals to break
[1:04:57] that you could see your name and see
[1:04:59] where you are prophesied to be here in
[1:05:02] this hour to be anointed.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, and commission. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:05:07] shout in the house.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory,

[1:05:19] May be seated.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; No man was found worthy to look on the
[1:05:24] book. Yes.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; So the devil can't even come close.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; So God seal you in the book.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; He sealed your name in the book
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; that the devil can't even watch. He
[1:05:33] can't touch. He don't know who we are.
[1:05:35] He don't know who's we are. He don't
[1:05:37] know where we come from. He don't know
[1:05:39] where we are going. He don't know what
[1:05:41] we doing this morning.
[1:05:59] Wonderful.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; You sin, you fail, you fall, you did
[1:06:01] this, that the other. That is not God's
[1:06:03] problem. You know,
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; because God is not now choosing you.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; God have no interview now interviewing
[1:06:09] how long you have been sinning, how long
[1:06:10] you have been failing, how long you have
[1:06:12] been falling. God not in that know God.
[1:06:14] If God choose you, he choose you before
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; before
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; the foundation of the world. Not when
[1:06:20] you start sinning before
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; and because he's choose here to find
[1:06:23] you. You have to sort you out. I can't
[1:06:25] solve your problem but Jesus can. He
[1:06:28] going to sort you out. Hallelujah.
[1:06:42] [Music]
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; William Brandham came to fulfill Luke
[1:06:47] 17:30. Even thus shall the son be
[1:06:48] revealed. Amen.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; And it's powerful because after Luke
[1:06:52] 17:30, Luke 18, Jesus asks a question,
[1:06:56] Solomon just revealed in Luke 17.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Luke 18, he asked a question. When the
[1:07:00] son of man cometh,
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; shall he find
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; the currency on the earth?
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Or are we going to lose it?
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you going to get the
[1:07:10] currency of faith? Because see, faith
[1:07:12] have to be exercised.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Faith is not talk.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that talk.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Faith is something different.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Like when God tell Joshua, take the
[1:07:23] people over. He never went there before.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Cross over Jordan. He never did that
[1:07:27] before.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; When he ready to cross and Baram says
[1:07:30] the elders came to him and tell him if
[1:07:31] he wait any longer the water will go
[1:07:33] down low and they wait across water. He
[1:07:35] said thank your elders.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Then God tell him Joshua tell them three
[1:07:39] days we going over.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Three days.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; He don't know how yet but he giving
[1:07:42] instruction structure. Three days.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Three days.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Go touch your wife. Amen.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Three days we
[1:07:50] crossing over.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; There was a preparation to cross.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Could somebody give a shout on that?
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; You're not crossing just like that.
[1:07:57] There's a preparation. And the saraphs
[1:08:00] from of the altar, but the coals come to
[1:08:03] prepare you by fire.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. Come on. You're going
[1:08:08] to get you're going to be filled.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; How many want the fire of God?
[1:08:21] And I love those Levites, man.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; When they take up the ark and Joshua and
[1:08:25] they say, "Match, we're going across
[1:08:26] Jordan." Them guys are watching with
[1:08:28] their senses
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; and say, "You see how high the water is
[1:08:31] toward was the highest,
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; them guys take up the ark and start to
[1:08:35] march down to Jordan because Joshua said
[1:08:37] so." And if God said it,
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; we going to cross.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; That's a sure word of prophecy. We are
[1:08:45] going to cross.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; You are going to cross. We prophesy.
[1:08:53] [Applause]
[1:08:54] [Music]
[1:08:56] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:09:02] Let me see them. And those brothers, the
[1:09:05] Bible said when their foot touch,
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; it's a good thing they no bogus and
[1:09:10] impersonating Levi then
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; because man watch out and run back and
[1:09:14] leave drop down the ark. But them guys
[1:09:16] was trained.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; They were anointed. They were under
[1:09:19] obedience. They wasn't doing their own
[1:09:21] thing. The ark had to go in front. You
[1:09:24] can't go in front of the ark.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; The ark have to go in front.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; When going in front, the devil in
[1:09:30] trouble. When God in front, no weapon
[1:09:32] formed against you could prosper. When
[1:09:34] God in front, oh, give the Lord a shout
[1:09:37] in the house.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Let God come in front.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; These Levites, they walking down to
[1:09:50] Jordan and as soon as the foot touch the
[1:09:52] river, it open up.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; It open up. You don't have to wait to
[1:09:57] see it open up. Keep walking. Let your
[1:10:00] foot touch. Face your trials. Face your
[1:10:03] situation.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Deal with it.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; When the son of cometh,
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; shall he find faith
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; on the earth?
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Or would you let them bandits rob you of
[1:10:21] defeat
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; that was once delivered to the saints?
[1:10:25] And William Brandon was sent to turn our
[1:10:27] hearts back to the faith that we could
[1:10:29] have purchasing power.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; We could be rich in faith.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Them brothers with the with
[1:10:36] the man who was sick on the pallet and
[1:10:38] they tear up the roof.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; They had faith
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; because they was bringing the friend to
[1:10:43] Jesus and the crowd was stick around the
[1:10:45] house and they said, "We are not turning
[1:10:48] back.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; We can't get through the front door. We
[1:10:51] can't get through the back door. We
[1:10:53] can't get through the window. We going
[1:10:55] to take the roof off.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, when you are
[1:10:59] determined, when something anchor in
[1:11:01] your soul that you have to get your
[1:11:03] breakthrough, you don't care who in
[1:11:05] front of you, who behind you, who either
[1:11:08] side of you, that has nothing to do with
[1:11:10] it.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; You've got to have that kind of
[1:11:18] determination.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; We know the story. The tear up the roof
[1:11:21] let down the man. That's it.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; How you going to have all that faith and
[1:11:23] don't get a response?
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, you pray.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; They tear up the roof and let him down
[1:11:28] right in front of Jesus.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Right in front of Jesus.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; That is faith.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; That is faith. Those guys didn't care
[1:11:36] nothing. They didn't care how much
[1:11:37] expensive the roof is, how to replace
[1:11:39] the roof. You see, faith does make you
[1:11:41] do things. It look like you're acting
[1:11:43] crazy.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; It is make you believe things that are
[1:11:46] not
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; as though they were.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; It is make you see what your eyes can't
[1:11:51] see. Let's make you touch what your
[1:11:53] hands can't touch.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. The eyes of faith is
[1:11:57] powerful. The eyes of faith say, "Praise
[1:12:00] God. Red Sea open up." A sea, not a
[1:12:04] ravine, not a river. The whole Red Sea,
[1:12:08] you have to believe. Stand still and see
[1:12:11] the salvation of our God.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises, people.
[1:12:17] Give the Lord some praises, people.
[1:12:22] [Applause]
[1:12:28] Do you know what that prophet
[1:12:29] prophesied?
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; He prophesied missing limbs
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; will be restored.
[1:12:37] [Applause]
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; You know how that's going to grow people
[1:12:40] faith?
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; When they see somebody who have no foot,
[1:12:42] get back a foot.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Get back your hand.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Missing limbs, you lost a kidney, you
[1:12:47] lost whatever it is. And God restore
[1:12:50] that.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; That is enough faith to make you be
[1:12:53] changed in the moment. Then you believe
[1:12:55] that this rapture thing is divine
[1:12:57] healing
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; on turbo.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; This is the the rapture is accelerated
[1:13:07] divine healing.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Is your body actually being changed? And
[1:13:11] if you can have faith to be healed now,
[1:13:13] how you going to have faith that this
[1:13:14] mortal will put on immortality?
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; And you're going to see the grim reaper
[1:13:18] and push his is reaping thing and push
[1:13:21] it aside. Not even death going to stop
[1:13:23] this bride.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; You walking on death trying to stop you.
[1:13:26] Push him. Death can't touch you. We
[1:13:28] shall not all sleep. But we shall be
[1:13:30] changed for the Lord himself descends.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:39] There's no pastor descending,
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; no elder descending.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; This the Lord himself descending with a
[1:13:46] shout
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; to get his pride out.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, what's choking you this
[1:13:53] morning?
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; The cares of life,
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Facebook,
[1:13:58] internet, YouTube. What's choking you
[1:14:01] this morning?

[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Don't let them choke.
[1:14:20] Cut down the vines.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Now, the word prophesy or the brand for
[1:14:26] why we not denomination does not mean to
[1:14:28] teach.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; All right. The prophecy means either to
[1:14:31] tell an experience under inspiration or
[1:14:35] foretell something that is fixing to
[1:14:37] take place.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; And in the old testament they could
[1:14:41] never speak out in the building, speak
[1:14:42] out in the church and congregation as a
[1:14:43] teacher but Anna men and men in the
[1:14:45] temple they were prophetist. Women can
[1:14:47] be prophetist today absolutely but not
[1:14:50] teachers behind the platform and so
[1:14:52] forth. So therefore the Bible give a
[1:14:55] scripture young men shall prophesy.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that I bought my spirit and
[1:14:59] the spirit of prophecy
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; going to return.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And brother Brandon,
[1:15:04] he was a vindicated prophet.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; So he brought vindicated word.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; And that word is a more sure word
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; of prophecy
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; of prophecy.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Because he went up into the intelligence
[1:15:15] of God
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; and pulled down the word
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; for the entire age. Amen.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; So when he pulled down your word, your
[1:15:22] word,
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; did you get that?
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had to pull out your
[1:15:32] word for you to be here today.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; The only reason you are here today, he
[1:15:38] pulled out your word. And your word came
[1:15:40] to you. The devil is a liar this
[1:15:43] morning. Let the devil know he's a liar
[1:15:45] this morning.
[1:15:52] How could brother pull down your word?
[1:15:54] Revelation 10:1. I saw
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; a mighty angel
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; coming down from heaven with a cloud
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; rainbow over his head
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; with a little book open.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; That book was in heaven,
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; but he had to bring it down.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; And the word come to a prophet. You have
[1:16:12] to have a seventh angel standing on the
[1:16:15] earth to get your name.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Because the angel, which angel? This
[1:16:20] mighty angel,
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; one with the sweat back wings.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; One with the seven seal.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Even Christ himself.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; That mighty angel
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; bringing out your name.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Your word,
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; your name was in the book.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Seven thunders.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Throw their voices out.
[1:16:40] to go across the entire earth.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Seven spirits
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; to sweep across the entire earth
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; to find your germ
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; to find your gene to find your seed.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; He has found you.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some worship.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord some praise this people.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Be seated.
[1:17:05] [Applause]
[1:17:05] [Music]
[1:17:06] [Applause]
[1:17:09] Hallelujah.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; When Prince Williams and Prince Charles
[1:17:12] and Prince whoever prince was born,
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; they didn't automatically know their
[1:17:18] royalty.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; They were born as babies.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Some nanny or whatever they call them
[1:17:24] come to nurse them and see about them
[1:17:26] and train them. As they get older,
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; they have to be training adequate
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; as to who they are. their lineage.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; What they entitled to,
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; what is offered to them,
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; they are not commoners.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; They are not ordinary people.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; They are royalty.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said as we near the
[1:17:51] hedge,
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; we become a super race.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; We not normal.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; We not commoners.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; We not ordinary people.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:18:03] Jesus said
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; these signs shall follow those people
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; them that believe.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; We are not normal.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; If we lay hands on upon the sick,
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; that's a prophecy.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; They shall
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; recover,
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; must recover
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; because the anointing
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; going to be there. And the Bible said,
[1:18:25] "The Lord himself
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; went everywhere
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; with them,
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; confirming the word
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; with signs,
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; with wonders, with miracles. Maybe it
[1:18:37] might start today.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Maybe it might start with you,
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; but it will start."
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; I am believing the Lord himself
[1:18:49] among you. Put a trouble among us. Oh,
[1:18:53] praise God.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Let's go a little further.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; But Brandon, I mean, God is own
[1:18:58] interpreter. He said we live in a day of
[1:18:59] confusion. We're living in a day when
[1:19:01] men and women hardly know what to do.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Everything seems to be in turmoil.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; It's many ways to look at it. Now, God
[1:19:09] cannot judge a people righteously unless
[1:19:12] there have to be a standard
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; that he has to judge them by.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he will judge all men
[1:19:19] by Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ is the word.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; It's in John 1:1. In the beginning was
[1:19:24] the word. The word was with God and the
[1:19:27] word was God.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; And the word is made flesh and dwell
[1:19:30] among us. What I mean that his thoughts
[1:19:34] a word and a thought expressed. Then it
[1:19:36] was in his thinking. Let there be let
[1:19:38] there be. And now remember you
[1:19:40] Christians, here we go. Were his
[1:19:43] thoughts before there was a world?
[1:19:46] [Music]
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. 20% say amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about you.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a prophet catching the
[1:19:56] mind of God,
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; bringing your word to you.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; I don't care if you smoke, you drink,
[1:20:00] your pipe. I don't care what you do.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; I don't care where. It has nothing to do
[1:20:04] with that.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; If you for to come true,
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; you have to be taught of God in God's
[1:20:09] mind.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; It's God thinking. I don't care if
[1:20:11] you're rebellious. Yeah. Want God. Yeah.
[1:20:13] If you to come to church and your mother
[1:20:15] drag you along, that have nothing to do
[1:20:16] with it.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God. you in a fishbowl.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; You swim sore and you go bounce.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; You swim so you go bounce. You swim so
[1:20:24] you go bounce.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Because every son that
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; he would lose none.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; When you was smoking, he couldn't lose
[1:20:35] you. When it was drinking, he couldn't
[1:20:37] lose you. When it was whatever, he
[1:20:39] couldn't lose you.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, he can lose you now.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout right now.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Give him a praise offering right now.
[1:20:48] Even if it don't feel like it, still do
[1:20:49] it.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And give the devil a mind
[1:20:56] battle. Give him some praises right now.
[1:20:58] Give the Lord some praises.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Oh glory.
[1:21:05] See it. I can imagine devil say look at
[1:21:08] look look at look look at look at she
[1:21:11] praising God and she had this fight and
[1:21:12] that fight and that fight. That nothing
[1:21:14] to do with that faith. when you could
[1:21:16] praise God any
[1:21:18] kind of condition around you but you're
[1:21:20] praising God anyhow devil get confused
[1:21:22] because you supposed to be sour you're
[1:21:24] supposed to be angry you supposed to be
[1:21:25] mean you to be upset and you refuse that
[1:21:28] upset can't help you sour can't help you
[1:21:31] but faith could change
[1:21:34] faith could rearrange faith could flip
[1:21:36] things
[1:21:37] [Applause]
[1:21:41] [Music]
[1:21:45] You ever heard a testimony about a man
[1:21:48] whose wife this somewhere Africa who
[1:21:50] didn't want his wife go to church take
[1:21:52] take the keys and throw in you see
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; and then he he he want food you want
[1:21:58] fish

[1:22:00] got doing fish the keys inside the fish
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; explain that figure that one
[1:22:06] [Applause]
[1:22:08] Look, look. God tell Abraham offer by
[1:22:10] Isaac
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; and and Abraham go up the mountain
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; and and his son smart. He said daddy see
[1:22:14] the world see the fire. Where's the
[1:22:17] where's the offering?
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; He said God provide for himself.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; When Abraham tied down Isaac coming
[1:22:25] along with knife and God said hold your
[1:22:27] hand. Look it ram right there.
[1:22:30] [Applause]
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; God put the ram at the bottom of the
[1:22:33] mountain. You have to climb.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Get back on the altar. You have to come
[1:22:37] when God say no no no. Look, look one
[1:22:39] day.

[1:22:59] for you.

[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Go to see how much you love him. Amen.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; How much you're willing to make a
[1:23:04] sacrifice in your life.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Some people don't like to make no
[1:23:07] sacrifices, but God has wanted to make a
[1:23:09] sacrifice.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; And then he come to confirm the
[1:23:12] sacrifice of faith that you're making
[1:23:13] your life.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Abraham knew he was giving up his
[1:23:15] testimony. He wait 25 years for his son
[1:23:17] and go to kill him.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; And he wasn't holding back.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; He wasn't taking that ship to Tashes. He
[1:23:22] wasn't holding back. He was coming down
[1:23:24] and God said, "Hold your hand. I know
[1:23:25] you love me."
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; And because of that, I will bless your
[1:23:28] seed.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; And here we are today
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; possessing the gates of the enemy.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:33] by prophecy.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; You might feel like a possessor yet, but
[1:23:42] you will be.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's your destiny.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; You didn't hear what I'm saying?
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; That is your destiny.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Think about it now. Think when you were
[1:23:52] a little child let's say a teacher your
[1:23:54] lawyer your doctor whatever it might be
[1:23:56] a officer whatever it might be there's a
[1:23:58] certain destiny
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; that was destiny a little child
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; God know the end from the beginning he
[1:24:03] know where you'll be right now
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; you know what age you'll be right now
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; so therefore you are in you are you are
[1:24:12] the manifestation of his thinking
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; before there was a world you were in
[1:24:16] Christ in God in the beginning that's
[1:24:19] make you his subjects and the whole
[1:24:21] thing is God himself materializing
[1:24:23] himself tangible so he could be handled.
[1:24:27] That is what that is the whole thing.
[1:24:29] The people say interpretation. I was
[1:24:30] speaking here not long ago in a meeting
[1:24:32] a man said brother Brandham you have the
[1:24:33] wrong interpretation. You don't
[1:24:35] interpret that right. We go to the
[1:24:36] Methodist they say the Baptist don't
[1:24:38] interpret it right. The Pentecostal
[1:24:39] don't and so wonders don't and so on.
[1:24:41] God is his own interpreter.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; He don't need anybody to interpret for
[1:24:48] him. He does his own interpreting.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that right?
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Now Peter said when God said let there
[1:24:54] be light and there was light. That's the
[1:24:56] interpretation to it. When God said
[1:24:57] anything, it was manifested. Then that
[1:25:00] is God's interpretation.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; So you don't have to query and question
[1:25:04] too much. Just see what God said and see
[1:25:07] how it's interpreted.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Right now people arguing over scripture,
[1:25:11] over words
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; and so forth, over dictionary and Greek
[1:25:15] and all that. But that is not the
[1:25:16] manifestation.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; The manifestation is the interpretation.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that is where the seed which is
[1:25:22] you come into being.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. So God
[1:25:26] doesn't need anybody to interpret it.
[1:25:27] When God speaks and it's manifested,
[1:25:30] that's the interpretation of his word.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; But before it is manifested, he sends
[1:25:35] out it as a prophecy.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; It's hanging there
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; 400 years.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Staying right there.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; You could read it.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; They're speaking it.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; It's got to come to pass.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; That prophecy is waiting for Mary. That
[1:25:49] prophecy is circling the whole earth.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; That prophecy can't drop down
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; until Mary come on the scene.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; And when Mary come, the prophecy hangs
[1:25:57] over Mary.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Wherever she go,
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; the prophecy going.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; That's the virgin. Hallelujah.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; She's not ready when she's 9 years old.
[1:26:04] She's not ready when she's 11 years old.
[1:26:06] She's have to be ready when she's ready.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Say amen, somebody.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; And when you are ready, you are ready
[1:26:12] for your prophecy,
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; which is your word. There's a prophecy
[1:26:15] for you.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, do we believe that?
[1:26:19] Do you believe that
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; there's a prophecy for you?
[1:26:25] [Applause]
[1:26:25] [Music]
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; So when Mary time came
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; angel had to come to Mary
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; had to come
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; not to June
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; not to John
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; not to this one and that one
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Mary
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Hail Mary
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; thou are highly favored.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; The Lord is with thee.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Blessed are thou among women. You have
[1:26:47] been elected. You are being selected.
[1:26:49] You are being chosen to bring forth
[1:26:52] Messiah.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; There's only one Mary. There's only one
[1:26:55] bride. There's only one you. Give the
[1:26:58] Lord some praises, people.
[1:27:04] [Music]
[1:27:05] [Applause]
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Now, if you stay in Trinidad, you ain't
[1:27:10] get nothing else.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; You got to translate with me
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; in the word. You have to either go
[1:27:16] Jerusalem. You have to come down here
[1:27:18] now.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; You have to come and see Jesus coming to
[1:27:20] be baptized by John.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You have to see
[1:27:24] the transition of all what the Old
[1:27:26] Testament was prophesying. Messiah
[1:27:28] coming. Messiah coming. Oh God, it's
[1:27:30] taking so long. But he's still coming
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; because the prophecy say Messiah coming.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. 400 years no prophet.
[1:27:38] Here come John like a wise man. Repent
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[1:27:43] Amen.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; John is anointed.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; John is on fire. John like a wman.
[1:27:51] Repent.

[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; John is baptized in souls after soul of
[1:29:46] soul.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is in line.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; He breaking the line and say, "I am
[1:29:50] Jesus." Is who I am?
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Ordinary man.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; But 30 years old.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Ordinary man.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Ordinary man.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; 12 years. 18 years of silence
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; from 12 to 18. 18 years
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; of Jesus in the scriptures,
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; no signs, no wonders, no vindication, no
[1:30:10] fire, no nothing,
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; just an ordinary man.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; And he's just walking down to the
[1:30:15] Jordan.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; John see him
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; and John said, "I have need to be
[1:30:18] baptized."
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Because he see the sign. The sign said,
[1:30:21] "There's one upon you whom see the
[1:30:23] spirit descending."
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; And
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; remaining.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; That's the one. Amen.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Don't just look for the spirit to jump
[1:30:29] on because sometime the wolf under there
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; as the spirit drop spirit gone.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; So you're looking for something that
[1:30:36] remains.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; That's Jesus.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; It remains on the lamb.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; It remains when I see faith, virtue,
[1:30:42] knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:30:44] courtiness, brotherly kindness, charity,
[1:30:46] the love of God, the token, the spirit
[1:30:48] dynamics, the cap, the love.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Remain.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; That's the house. That's the temple.
[1:30:54] That's the cap. Amen.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises, people.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Let's go a little further.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; My so long.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; You say all you say when God makes a
[1:31:07] promise.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; He is loted his word to each age. Watch.
[1:31:11] And God always sends on the scene down
[1:31:13] to the Old Testament new prophets. And
[1:31:15] the word of the Lord comes to the
[1:31:16] prophet. And how does it do it? It
[1:31:18] manifests the word of God. Amen.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; God's manifestation tells whether it is
[1:31:24] right or wrong. Nobody has to interpret
[1:31:26] it. The word interprets itself.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; God promise it and there it happens.
[1:31:32] Notice here from see the discrepancy an
[1:31:35] angel uh in verse 14. The two spirit
[1:31:37] will be so close in the last days. He
[1:31:39] could not depend upon some certain
[1:31:41] church to separate them. So he said the
[1:31:42] angels to separate them. An angel is
[1:31:46] coming to bring the separation between
[1:31:49] right and wrong. And no one can do that
[1:31:52] but the angel of the Lord.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Notice he said the swers were and what
[1:31:57] the seed was. The swer was the son of
[1:32:00] God who went forth sowing seed and enemy
[1:32:02] came behind him which was the devil and
[1:32:04] sw the seed of discrepancy.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; So this is a different parable now from
[1:32:08] the tears and not the tears the choking
[1:32:10] of the seed and so on falling on good
[1:32:12] grounds and so on like that. There's
[1:32:13] different. This is where the son of man
[1:32:14] sw the seed and the enemy came and sow
[1:32:17] seed in the field
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; and then both jump up
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; looking for rain to fall
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; and then one say should we cut down the
[1:32:24] tears of no no leave them alone leave
[1:32:26] them alone them grow together
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; until
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; time of harvest.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Let them grow together. Let them shout
[1:32:33] and say amen together until
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; the time of harvest.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Oh glory. Now the seed of God, the word
[1:32:41] of God, the word is a seed and every
[1:32:43] seed will bring forth after its kind.
[1:32:45] Now if the Christian, the children of
[1:32:47] God, the children of the kingdom has
[1:32:50] become the seed of God,
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; then they must be the word of God, the
[1:32:55] word of God manifested in the age that
[1:32:58] they're living in.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; So he is prophesying that the children
[1:33:01] will become the seed.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; And that when the children becomes the
[1:33:04] word,
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; so you becomes the word. Now you can
[1:33:07] understand how the spirit and the bride
[1:33:08] will say come
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; because the bride will be the word
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; and the spirit will come upon the bride
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; to give the bride a voice.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; The bride have to be given a voice
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; not just one voice. Seven voices
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; will become one voice.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; The voice of the archangel
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; going to be in a bride.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus does all three.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; The shout, the voice and the trump.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon brought the shout.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And prophesy about the
[1:33:34] coming voice. Amen.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; You will see the appearing of the Lord
[1:33:40] right here among us.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; You're going to see signs, one of the
[1:33:43] miracle.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; I can't stop it. You can't stop it. No
[1:33:46] man could stop it. God spoke it. So
[1:33:49] shall it be.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Right now, you are
[1:33:52] under prophecy. All these years, your
[1:33:54] coming is not in vain. We have not be
[1:33:57] leave fables.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. We have a sure word of
[1:34:00] prophecy. We have not believed in vain.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; It shall surely come to pass. Oh, glory
[1:34:05] to God. Amen.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; When Noah came, he was the seed of go of
[1:34:09] of God, the word for that age.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; When Moses came, he could not come with
[1:34:13] Moses, Noah's message. It wouldn't work.
[1:34:15] He was a seed at that time. Now, we have
[1:34:17] lived through Luther's age, Wesley age,
[1:34:19] Pentecostal age. Each age has his
[1:34:21] promise and the people of the age that
[1:34:25] manifest
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; that promise word
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; is the seed of that age. Amen.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; So our age, you have a word of brotherly
[1:34:34] kindness,
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; spirit of forgiveness,
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; that must be manifested,
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; not just revealed
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; but manifested.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; The people that manifest that brotherly
[1:34:44] love, they are the seed
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; of the age. Amen.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Because brotherly love is the thing that
[1:34:49] attract the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. Right after brotherly
[1:34:53] kindness is that slot called Holy
[1:34:55] Spirit.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And even when a woman is going to
[1:34:58] bring birth, giving birth to a baby, in
[1:35:00] the book we tell you read,
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; things that are to be,
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; he's a sweet spirit comes around a woman
[1:35:07] because she's about to get another
[1:35:08] spirit for that baby.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelu. She said, I don't care how
[1:35:12] mean the woman is, how evil a woman is,
[1:35:14] when she's about to give birth, a sweet
[1:35:16] spirit comes around the woman.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; That sweet spirit of brotherly kindness
[1:35:21] have to come around this woman,
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; have to come around this bride. Is she
[1:35:25] going to bring forth
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ baby?
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; So the more evil and angry and jealous
[1:35:34] and hate for somebody else is you know
[1:35:35] no baby's coming.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; False pregnancy.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Praise God. They had to
[1:35:40] go and rebong and go again.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; But when that baby is coming
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; a sweet spirit.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Spirit of forgiveness. Amen.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; You can't hold ought.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; They can't hold grudges. It just won't
[1:35:50] hold. They stop blaming others. There a
[1:35:52] lot of people have a gift of blaming.
[1:35:54] They blame the mother, the father, the
[1:35:56] brother, the sister, the uncle, the job,
[1:35:57] the boss, everybody but themselves.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelu ever making excuses.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Somebody says something to
[1:36:04] me. Um, father, a son says, "Father,
[1:36:06] daddy, how to choose a a sister, how to
[1:36:08] choose somebody nice?" He says, "Son,
[1:36:10] forget about how to choose a nice woman,
[1:36:11] how to choose a nice girl or whatnot.
[1:36:13] Work on yourself.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; You try to become a better man.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; You work on you and a better man will
[1:36:20] choose a better woman. Oh, give the Lord
[1:36:22] some praises, people.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Don't try to work on
[1:36:25] the lady.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; You work on you.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Work on yourself.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Become that man of God. Become that son
[1:36:33] of God.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Reflect Christ. Reflect something.
[1:36:37] Reflect principle.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And people going to
[1:36:40] respect you.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; You a woman, you're a sister. You act
[1:36:43] right, dress right, and what? People are
[1:36:45] going to respect you.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:36:49] God. Don't be coming like the rest of
[1:36:51] the world.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Don't be a photocopy.
[1:36:54] [Applause]
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Whatever they wearing out there, you
[1:36:56] want to wear too, forget that.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Let people ask why you dress how you
[1:37:00] dress.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Why you dress differently?
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Let them ask why you dress so different.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; That they want to know the hope of your
[1:37:08] calling.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. So
[1:37:11] therefore, those that manifest the
[1:37:13] promise, the manifestation of the Holy
[1:37:15] Spirit operating through his children is
[1:37:19] those seeds of the kingdom.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Of that age, the manifestation of the
[1:37:22] Holy Spirit operating and the Holy
[1:37:24] Spirit cannot behave in one person and
[1:37:26] misbehave in another.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit makes you conform to its
[1:37:33] nature,
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; to its behavior. And one of the signs of
[1:37:37] the Holy Spirit is somebody able to
[1:37:38] repent and make things right and humble
[1:37:42] themselves. The first sign of the Holy
[1:37:44] Ghost is humility.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Not you fighting up and carrying on to
[1:37:48] prove your point and debate and argue to
[1:37:51] prove how right you are. No. When the
[1:37:53] Holy Spirit come, it makes you humble
[1:37:56] yourself.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says the day last day
[1:38:00] the true bride will come to the
[1:38:02] headstone will be a super race. as she
[1:38:04] nears a headstone. They will be much
[1:38:06] like him. So much like him that they
[1:38:09] will be in his very image in order to be
[1:38:11] united with him. They will be one.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; They will be there we go. Here we go.
[1:38:17] The very manifestation of the word of
[1:38:20] the living God.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Denomination can never produce this.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; So Satan encountered the manifestation
[1:38:26] of the living God before
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he got shocked
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; and he take a break for a long time. He
[1:38:33] went for a season.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; So when he come back to this bride, he
[1:38:36] get shock again.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because that voltage is
[1:38:40] passing through that bride.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. After jail overcoming the
[1:38:45] devil in the wilderness without without
[1:38:47] demonstration, one sense of power, the
[1:38:49] Bible said he returned in the power of
[1:38:51] the spirit.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then he went to the
[1:38:55] temple and found the place where it was
[1:38:57] written. Yeah.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; So Jesus himself had to find his
[1:39:00] scriptures.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; What about you?
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; You have to find your word.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; There's a word for you. You have to find
[1:39:05] your scripture.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; But around found the scripture.
[1:39:08] Revelation 10:7, Malachi 4, Luke 17:30.
[1:39:11] Put around found the scripture and you
[1:39:13] have to connect with that to produce
[1:39:14] that.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You have to find your
[1:39:17] scripture and connect to that.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; You could live harder than that.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on now. You don't have
[1:39:23] to live like a devil. You don't have to
[1:39:25] live nasty and bad ways and bad
[1:39:28] behavior. You don't have to live like
[1:39:29] that. You can live higher than that.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus could tell the woman,
[1:39:32] "Go and sin no more."
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Go. You're not a sin no more because you
[1:39:36] could live higher than that.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; There's a higher calling.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Come on. You have a higher calling.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; If you're looking for a job and they
[1:39:46] send for you for interview, how you go
[1:39:48] to the interview?
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Like Raga Muffin,
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; you ain't want that job. You snatch a
[1:39:54] hat and you just put on a new shoes that
[1:39:56] get
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; You never dress or tie your or shirt you
[1:39:59] just throw on like that. You're not even
[1:40:01] iron or presses.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; And they walk into the interview room.
[1:40:03] They have six people.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Two just watching you alone.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; They not asking any questions. They just
[1:40:11] watching and soon you walk in the door
[1:40:12] they say no.
[1:40:16] All the interview after it's just
[1:40:18] formality.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; By sight they say no.
[1:40:24] So you have a job to be in the front
[1:40:25] desk to meet people what not and they
[1:40:26] come to you with a hard face like if you
[1:40:29] vex with interviewers
[1:40:31] like if you want to interview them
[1:40:34] they say no
[1:40:37] why they want a certain quality
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; they want a certain face they want a
[1:40:41] certain behavior
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; that's why they ask certain questions
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; so God have his interview too
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; God have his way of testing
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; that's it
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; that's why every son of God come to God
[1:40:50] not be tested Glory going to say, "Hey,
[1:40:53] is it you?" Look the ring sign. Look the
[1:40:56] checkbook.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Who you
[1:41:00] got to check you out
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; to see the son is qualified
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; because you have all kind of sons.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. God want the right kind
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; right kind of a son
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; that he could give the checkbook to say
[1:41:12] son. Whoever you high is higher. Who
[1:41:14] your fire is fire. I know you have my
[1:41:16] mind. I know you have my way. I know you
[1:41:19] have my nature. I know you're going to
[1:41:20] think like me, act like me.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; When a father had that confidence, he
[1:41:24] could turn his back on the job, turn his
[1:41:25] back on the company, I know his son
[1:41:27] going to run things well.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Because that son was about
[1:41:31] his father's business
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; and Jesus said, "I must be about my
[1:41:35] father's business."
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. Are you about God's
[1:41:38] business? If you take care of God
[1:41:40] business, go take care about your
[1:41:41] business.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Push for God. Push for the
[1:41:44] kingdom. Oh, glory to God. We taking
[1:41:47] some more. Hallelujah.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. The first son was the
[1:41:51] spoken word seed of God.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; He was given a bride, Adam.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Isn't that right?
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; And he was fell and he was given a bride
[1:41:59] purpose to reproduce himself again.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; That was the object of having Eve
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; to produce more Adams.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; And it fell. It fell from six sense to
[1:42:08] five senses in the flesh. And there were
[1:42:09] sex coming in. But Adam was supposed to
[1:42:11] speak for his word. Speak a son into
[1:42:13] existence by spoken word. Eve conceived
[1:42:15] and produced a next son. spoken word,
[1:42:18] son.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; That's why the first thing he has come,
[1:42:20] you must be born again by the word, by
[1:42:22] the spirit. You have to come back to
[1:42:23] spoken word
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; because that is how we were supposed to
[1:42:26] be born.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. But because man fell,
[1:42:29] it come to this flesh thing. But we're
[1:42:30] going back to spoken word thing.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Are you with me now?
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; The second son spoken word Jesus Christ
[1:42:39] was given a bride like Adam. But before
[1:42:41] he could marry her, she fallen.
[1:42:43] She was put on free moral agency like
[1:42:45] Adam wife was to believe God's word and
[1:42:47] live doubt it and die. She did she died.
[1:42:50] No from a little group of the true seed
[1:42:52] of the word. God represent Christ a
[1:42:55] beloved bride. She's a virgin of his
[1:42:57] word. She's a virgin because she know no
[1:42:59] man-made creeds.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; No man made dogmas by and through the
[1:43:04] bride will be fulfilled all
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; that was promised.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; God can use nobody else. Amen.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; So if you are part of this bride, God
[1:43:13] will get you in shape.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; If you're out of shape,
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; you're coming in shape.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Because by and through the bride will be
[1:43:21] fulfilled all.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; So the bride will be a channel
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; of communication
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; for God inspiration
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; to flow through. God going to make you a
[1:43:30] channel
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; like a pipe.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; All right.

[1:43:34] you.

[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; You as a bride member,
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; have the ability to hear from God.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; God could speak to you.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; I don't care what condition you in. God
[1:44:04] could speak to you.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; You have the ability to hear
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; God's voice.
[1:44:10] Oh, glory to God. Do you believe that?
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; You don't have to walk in darkness.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; You could hear God's voice.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; And I love this part. The word watch
[1:44:23] from a little group of the right. Okay.
[1:44:26] By and through the bride with members of
[1:44:28] the bride will fulfill all that was
[1:44:29] promised of God to be manifest in this
[1:44:31] in the virgin. The word of promise came
[1:44:34] to the Virgin Mary.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Here we go.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; The word of the promise came to the
[1:44:40] Virgin Mary. But that word of promise
[1:44:44] was he himself
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; to be made manifest.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; I love this.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; He himself acted at that time
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; to fulfill his own word.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; So the word was he that he promised
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; was he's a to manifest himself.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Amen.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; And at that time, the Lord himself acted
[1:45:08] on his own word
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; to bring his word to pass
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; in Mary's life.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; What do you think he going to do in this
[1:45:14] hour?
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; When the Lord himself
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; descend from heaven with a shout,
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; he wasn't chopping no elder, no
[1:45:20] minister, and no different one. He
[1:45:22] descended from heaven with a shout.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; There was a prophet on the earth. He
[1:45:25] took the prophet off the earth. But the
[1:45:27] Lord himself, that angel is still on the
[1:45:30] earth. That's why brother Brandham said,
[1:45:32] "When I am gone, healing is not gone.
[1:45:35] When I am gone, deliverance is not gone.
[1:45:38] When I am gone, breakthrough is not
[1:45:40] gone." Come on. Because the Lord himself
[1:45:43] has descended. The Lord is among us. The
[1:45:46] Lord is with you.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; You are blessed this morning.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; You are blessed to be in the spirit.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; You are blessed to be in the atmosphere.

[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to
[1:46:04] God.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord some praise this people.
[1:46:11] Hallelujah.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; My my praise
[1:46:15] Jesus.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:46:18] my
[1:46:26] Jesus.

[1:46:29] come down, what happens?

[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; And the Lord open something to me. All
[1:46:42] that is the objective of the enemy is to
[1:46:45] change the atmosphere around your life.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; If you could keep the atmosphere, the
[1:46:50] devil is defeated.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; What the devil is doing, this happened
[1:46:53] to your family, your child, your son, is
[1:46:56] to shake you off the atmosphere. But if
[1:46:58] you stay in the atmosphere, you become a
[1:47:01] channel of pipe. Glory.
[1:47:04] Glory.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:10] Glory to God.

[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; being offered up.

[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; because the prophecy say
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; shall not see that
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; until you see the Lord's Christ.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; And if I see Christ death, I will sing
[1:49:01] and you can't stand.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, give the Lord some praises.

[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Can I see that
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; till I see the Lord's Christ every
[1:49:10] service in the house of God, you know
[1:49:14] the Messiah
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; have to come there. He don't break it by
[1:49:17] no oak tree.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; He don't break it by no mango tree.
[1:49:20] Messiah ain't coming there.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Daily Messiah have to come to the
[1:49:24] temple.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; According to the rules,
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; according to the law,
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Simeon is in position.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; He just waited.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; You will be seated.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; He's in the atmosphere.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Never about Simeon wife, but maybe she
[1:49:40] didn't make her a good coffee that day.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Maybe she didn't bring her a good
[1:49:44] sandwich that day. Maybe he was supposed
[1:49:45] to get upset, but he said, "Woman, I
[1:49:47] have appointment."
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe the break come out too
[1:49:51] late
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; and he leave without eating at home. But
[1:49:54] he was making sure he missing the
[1:49:56] opportunity
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; to be a witness of the fulfillment of
[1:50:00] prophecy.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; So Simeon is there. Here come Mary and
[1:50:04] Joseph. They may even see the man.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; They walking and minding their own
[1:50:08] business. They just pass seem normal,
[1:50:11] normal, normal. But in the spirit realm
[1:50:13] when they pass, Holy Spirit touch him.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit move now.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Messiah is here.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; The Lord himself.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; The Lord himself
[1:50:25] has come down.

[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; You know what I like about God?
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; He doesn't give you all the answers.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; He doesn't give you all the unfolding
[1:50:39] things. See, me and I to walk now. You
[1:50:41] don't know who is who yet. I said a
[1:50:42] baby's pass and he had to walk led by
[1:50:45] the spirit.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Same spirit that reveal,
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; same spirit. You see, prophecy is
[1:50:50] dynamics in spirit form.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Dynamics in the form of prophecy because
[1:50:56] the word is spirit.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; That's why when people reject the word,
[1:51:05] they don't understand.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; They're rejecting the spirit.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Because the word is wordings. the spirit
[1:51:10] in word form.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; So that spirit of prophecy that was upon
[1:51:15] Simeon led him straight to the Christ.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Then he could say, "Lord, let your
[1:51:19] servant depart in peace
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; for my eyes have seen
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; my salvation."
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Glory of the Lord.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; He could rest now.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; He could finish now.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; He could say goodbye world.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Good morning glory. I'm telling the
[1:51:33] devil,
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; your job is to bring a chariot for me to
[1:51:37] cross over. This death thing and no dead
[1:51:40] thing. This death thing is a chariot
[1:51:42] thing. Come on, death. Come on now. Let
[1:51:45] me get a ride. Oh, get the Lord some.
[1:51:48] Oh, I feel like preaching now.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Don't want to write a
[1:51:53] song where they say death have no power
[1:51:55] over the blood wash.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, man. God,

[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; until the atmosphere come around you
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; and you feel the presence of God. And
[1:52:24] David, David want to hear that rustle in
[1:52:26] the malberry tree. Don't just run and do
[1:52:28] stuff. You want to know that God is good
[1:52:30] in front of you.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Because if God is going in front, it
[1:52:32] going to be all right.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; But if God not in front, it's you
[1:52:35] pushing.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; And when you push, the devil going to
[1:52:38] push too.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; It's only because the spirit of God was
[1:52:45] in front of David. David escaped so and
[1:52:47] so much times.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; David had to hide in cave. David had to
[1:52:50] play mad. David do all kind of stuff
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; to escape. But David know he had a that
[1:52:55] throne belong to him. Amen.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; He was anointed with the horn of oil,
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; from Samuel Horn,

[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; But he was anointed.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; He had the prophecy upon him.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; I have appointed another man.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; I find a better man
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; to rule over Israel.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; So God take the oil and pour it on
[1:53:15] David.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; It wasn't time for him to sit on that
[1:53:17] yet, but it was a shower with a prophecy
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; that that man will sit on that throne.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. They would have to fight and
[1:53:24] wrestle and battle. But he did make it.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; He did make it.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Because God spoke it.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises, people.

[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; But you have to believe it.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; I don't care what prison you're in right
[1:53:43] now.

[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; you got to want to come out.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:53:54] Maybe season when Jesus crossed over to
[1:53:57] Gdara, met that man in the tomb,
[1:53:59] thousand devils.

[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Man is naked. The man stripping himself.
[1:54:13] The man have super strength and
[1:54:14] everything else. But he's crying out.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus made his appearance
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; and deliver that man.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Them devil say we want some place to do
[1:54:21] some mist. If we say going to the pigs,
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; they had to go somewhere, you know.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. When devils leave, they want to
[1:54:26] go somewhere. They want they might like
[1:54:28] floating in the air too much.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; So don't make yourself a open door for
[1:54:31] devils.

[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; sisters of fire.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; They in church.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Nobody asks them to bring money and sell
[1:55:52] and do this. But they sell and they come
[1:55:54] and they say, "This is all
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; they come and bring in that." He said,
[1:55:58] "Is that all?"
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. Was a lie.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Peter said, "You didn't lie to me.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; You lie to the Holy Ghost.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Man dropped down dead."
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Wife came after See y that was all Yeah.
[1:56:13] Yeah. She dropped down dead too. And she
[1:56:15] always know her husband is a liar. She
[1:56:18] live with the man. She must know the
[1:56:19] man. She married the man.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; She had a choice.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; She did not die like the man.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; She had a choice to be honest.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; To be truthful.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; But my point is not that part. My point
[1:56:29] is the fact that this same cusp,
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; this same denying Christ,
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; he had a tabernacle now a house
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; that God was living in.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; That God could make his appearance. that
[1:56:40] God could push out himself
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; cuz after a while this Holy Ghost going
[1:56:43] to show himself alive
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; among us
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; brother said it going to happen again
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; same Holy Ghost
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; same power same anointed

[1:57:19] now?
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; That's why you can't hold somebody to
[1:57:23] the past.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; You're wrong to do that.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; You can't put somebody in concrete.
[1:57:27] You're wrong to do that.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; You can't fix somebody how they was
[1:57:31] because you know them. So you're wrong
[1:57:32] to do that.

[1:59:10] holes because of what's happening.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Walking and bouncing into posting
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; walking and fall straight on the
[1:59:20] pavement.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Got to c up the quarter.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Not in the coming of the Lord. Not in
[1:59:27] the spirit. They caught up in the phone.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; If the phone falls, it's like a life
[1:59:33] fall.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Is a phone life
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; is the devil
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; riding social media.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; It's the devil.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; God could use it too. But the devil
[1:59:44] riding that people life caught up
[1:59:46] instead of that.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; My God. My God.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; We have a Facebook page. The church has
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't ask how people even look at
[1:59:54] what we post.
[1:59:57] Because you have other things that we
[1:59:59] post in service, we posting this, we
[2:00:01] posting that. We have a YouTube channel
[2:00:03] too.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; How many people go to that?

[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; If you miss a service, there's no
[2:00:11] excuse. You can still go and listen to
[2:00:12] it and come back charge.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Come back on fire. Don't come back like
[2:00:18] you lost. What they preached last week.
[2:00:20] What kind of nonsense is that? I sure
[2:00:22] you know what happened Facebook 2 hours
[2:00:23] ago. Whatever it is, you sure check
[2:00:26] something before you before you come to
[2:00:27] church to call them sinners.
[2:00:31] Those Facebook sinners inside of you. I
[2:00:34] wouldn't I I wouldn't call them to the
[2:00:36] altar.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; I will leave you to repent right where
[2:00:42] you are.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; I'm not even looking at you.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; I just preached in the word.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; I go right to the sound like Jesus.

[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:54] We have to flip the switch.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; We have to change things around.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; You have to want a reality.
[2:01:00] [Applause]
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; You have to want God.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; I remember the early days was 1975
[2:01:08] hunging and thirsting for God.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; I remember going empty houses and
[2:01:12] praying. I was in lavend. I was to be
[2:01:14] crying out unto God.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; That time I had no Facebook at that cell
[2:01:18] phone.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; You're on your own.
[2:01:22] When you see somebody with a cell phone
[2:01:24] label, woo, look, he have something
[2:01:26] portable.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Those were the days. Now just find a dog
[2:01:31] texting.
[2:01:33] Everybody have this thing. Oh my.
[2:01:36] Hallelujah. People just in it. And it's
[2:01:39] the devil's job
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; to make sure the world get connected and
[2:01:42] they get everybody connecting. So
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; the FBI don't look far. They know your
[2:01:46] family, cousin, aunt, don't everybody.
[2:01:47] Everybody. Police don't even look for
[2:01:49] people no more. You look on your
[2:01:50] Facebook. look through. Oh,
[2:01:53] you abandon your family and they make
[2:01:54] all the connections. Then we go on
[2:01:56] arrest. St is doing that. You want your
[2:01:59] social media account, you have to give
[2:02:00] it.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; That's how they're looking because
[2:02:02] people want to be connected.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; See, this is how God's people supposed
[2:02:05] to be
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; connected.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; True God. He wanted a family. He didn't
[2:02:10] want to be all alone. He wanted his sons
[2:02:12] and daughters. He wanted to fellowship
[2:02:14] with them every day
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; in the cool of the evening. He want to
[2:02:17] be gracious to them. He want to reveal
[2:02:19] his love to them. He want to pour the
[2:02:21] blessing upon them.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; So God come
[2:02:27] on hold on
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; on the cell phone.
[2:02:33] Don't do go that. Please
[2:02:35] don't I finish writing this text.
[2:02:39] That's the new Adam. That's the devil
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; taking away your life by Facebook, by
[2:02:45] Instagram, by all these social media is
[2:02:47] thiefing your life. Fight back.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Take it back.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Limit yourself
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; on that thing.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; I think it's 20% say amen.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:03:14] there on the internet.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. friends.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; That's what it's spamming that people
[2:03:20] selling me things, telling me thing. I
[2:03:21] ain't talking to keep saying I can't
[2:03:24] even read now. It's too much a thing.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Might be legal thing, legitimate thing,
[2:03:29] nice things, but it's too much a thing I
[2:03:31] do at the time.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; So, you have to set limits
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; and say, you know what, this only
[2:03:37] deserve 10 minutes of my time
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; and I will deal with that this evening
[2:03:40] between 4 and 5.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; After that, God's time.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if if you're on that more than
[2:03:47] praying time, something really wrong.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Devil have you say, "Come on now. Come
[2:03:51] on now. You know, you know, you know,
[2:03:52] you know." No. Flip it.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Give yourself limits.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; See what kind of temperance you have
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; that you're going to put time yourself.
[2:04:01] How much time you got on the spoken
[2:04:03] book, how much time you were listening
[2:04:04] to a tape, how much time you pray. See
[2:04:06] it.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; See how it all adds up.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; I'm seeing the devil at work because we
[2:04:11] have to get a revival going.
[2:04:16] And my burden is that I know the
[2:04:18] preacher can't bring the revival.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; If I got to bring it, I'll bring it a
[2:04:22] long time.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; I call myself a revivalist. I love
[2:04:25] revival.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But when I'm say the people
[2:04:28] have to bring it.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; If Adam texting right now, how he
[2:04:32] bringing revival?
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; If Adam's not praying, how they going to
[2:04:35] bring revival?
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; If Adam not on fire, how they bring
[2:04:37] revival?
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; We need men on fire.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; We need Caleb's on fire.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; We don't need dead Caleb. Amen.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; We need Calebs on fire.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; We need Caleb on fire to put the young
[2:04:46] people to shame.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Because God called the young men because
[2:04:49] they're strong.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; God called you in your youth
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; that you could give him your energy,
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; give him your might,
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; give him your strength.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Now is the time to put all into it.

[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; When you get wife and family, there's a
[2:05:10] different ball game all together.
[2:05:11] different responsibility. But now you
[2:05:13] have no wife and now you should be you
[2:05:14] should be
[2:05:16] on fire.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; People, we should be trying to hold you

[2:07:26] Praise God.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Listen to this one. Baram said in the
[2:07:31] evidence of resurrection, there'll be a
[2:07:32] day that won't be need night nor day.
[2:07:34] The prophet said it will just be hearing
[2:07:36] the word
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; with no manifestation
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; but in the evening time
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; it shall be light.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; So that day on right is not there's no
[2:07:45] manifestation.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; John had no manifestation. He was just
[2:07:48] to make a way for the Messiah.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus came he had manifestation.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; And after 2,000 years preacher of
[2:07:54] preaching the word the church still
[2:07:55] don't believe. But the even light has
[2:07:57] come
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; the manifestation of the resurrection.
[2:08:00] There's coming another evening like in
[2:08:02] this message. But abandon was the Eden
[2:08:04] light.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; He manifested Christ. There's going to
[2:08:07] be a bride manifestation of Christ.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; In this message, not playing back books
[2:08:12] and tapes. A bride manifestation of
[2:08:14] Jesus Christ.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; It going to shake the whole world.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; It will be a shout of the king
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; in the camp.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; It going to be Jesus Christ walking in
[2:08:23] it.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; The shout of the king going to be in
[2:08:26] that camp.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; You will hear a shout in the house.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:08:32] Notice it was a short message talking
[2:08:35] about Jesus. It wasn't long. He didn't
[2:08:37] stay long with them. He just manifested
[2:08:39] himself and vanished out of their sight.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Then they said, "Did not our hearts burn
[2:08:43] within us while he talked to us along
[2:08:45] the way?"
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "The seven
[2:08:47] mysteries." Watch as Daniel heard the
[2:08:49] seven thunders as was forbidden. John
[2:08:52] heard the voices and the book was sealed
[2:08:54] as skipped on this. Watch. In other
[2:08:56] words, the mission of God would be
[2:08:57] finished. In other words, God would be
[2:09:00] known to his church. Not in three people
[2:09:02] but as one person the mystery of God
[2:09:05] would reveal and when that was
[2:09:08] completely revealed then seven mysteries
[2:09:11] would open to the church.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Because in there here we go the church
[2:09:16] this is prophecy would be living under
[2:09:19] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him
[2:09:23] moving in and out showing his signs of
[2:09:25] being alive among us. And then we are
[2:09:28] worshiping the living Christ
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; that's among us.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; That's the prophecy. There is no
[2:09:34] argument with that. The manifestation of
[2:09:36] that will be the interpretation.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Them seven thunders.
[2:09:40] That's the mystery talking about will
[2:09:42] reveal Christ among us.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; Then we are worshiping the living
[2:09:46] Christ.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Him moving in and out. Maybe he going to
[2:09:49] move in today.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; I believe somebody will be delivered
[2:09:52] today.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Today. Not next week. Today.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Right with me now from
[2:10:01] third seal. They miss him. The living
[2:10:03] word manifested in the flesh by the word
[2:10:06] that was promised.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; The word promised to do these things.
[2:10:09] Understand this church. The scribes and
[2:10:12] the Pharisees have the quotes, the
[2:10:14] tapes, the word.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Of prophecy.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus came, they rejected him.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; And he came as manifested word.
[2:10:22] [Applause]
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; Then they are bold. They say our fathers
[2:10:28] eat mana in the wilderness
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; and say and everyone dead.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; What are they talking about? 2 million
[2:10:34] people came out of Egypt. They're happy
[2:10:36] to leave Egypt and they don't even know
[2:10:38] they'll die.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Two people come with the message of
[2:10:41] Moses, but they don't know the same God
[2:10:43] that bring them out going to judge them.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Because he want you to continue in the
[2:10:47] word.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Especially when it come to your promise.
[2:10:50] Amen.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; He tolerate the complain in the
[2:10:55] wilderness. They want food. They want
[2:10:57] meat. They want water. They want this.
[2:10:59] He give them all.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; But when it come to the kenish vania,
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; when it come to possessing that land and
[2:11:06] bringing back evidence and brother says
[2:11:08] God called ministers ought to bring back
[2:11:11] to their congregation evidence that
[2:11:14] there's land beyond the river,
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; not playing books and tapes. That's not
[2:11:18] no God called minister doing that.
[2:11:20] Anybody could do that.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; But God called ministers have to bring
[2:11:25] back
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; to their congregation evidence that
[2:11:28] there's a land beyond the river. He is
[2:11:31] still a deliverer. He is still a healer.
[2:11:33] He is still a baptizer. That is what
[2:11:35] we're here for.
[2:11:38] [Applause]
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; You have to want to roll back the enemy.
[2:11:45] You must want to push back the
[2:11:47] Philistines
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; in your own life.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; You must want a higher standard
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; for your own life.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You must want to lead and
[2:11:55] tell others to follow.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Your car
[2:11:59] point somebody to a place you have not
[2:12:01] gone.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:12:04] when we go to travel and go driving up
[2:12:06] there so much times and know every
[2:12:08] pothole.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; I know every sink. Yes,
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; I know every part to avoid because you
[2:12:13] have journeyi it so much at times.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; That's how you must be in the word.

[2:12:40] you're walking.

[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; So what happened to the pirate
[2:12:48] Pharisees? They held on to traditions.
[2:12:50] Oh, this is what we normally do. This is
[2:12:52] what the message will do. Tradition. So
[2:12:55] once somebody come out of that, they
[2:12:56] say, "What they playing? What they
[2:12:57] playing? What they playing?" They're
[2:12:58] playing nothing. They're just out of the
[2:13:00] traditions. Let's go watch.
[2:13:02] Because she held to these tradition.
[2:13:05] Jesus the manifested word said to the
[2:13:08] Hebrew bride because you hold to
[2:13:10] traditions you make the word of God
[2:13:14] without any effect to you.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; So if you come to church and you don't
[2:13:19] break out then it's just a word.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; You kill time and waste two hours here
[2:13:22] and you go back home. But if you break
[2:13:25] out to that
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; and you recognize this word
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; is show word of prophecy,
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; then you're not wasting your time.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are coming to get under the
[2:13:35] anointing.

[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; your prophecy. You're coming to connect
[2:13:41] with that.

[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "My servant is sick.

[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I have the problem with
[2:18:02] the young people will be over.

[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; That's holy ground. Not the mountain
[2:18:15] holy, you know, there's a holy God come
[2:18:17] down on that mountain.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; When God came on a mountain, the
[2:18:19] mountain begin to rumble and tremble
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; and shake and voices and trumpet.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; People say, "Don't let God speak. Let
[2:18:26] Moses speak."
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Then God say, "Okay, I'm
[2:18:30] going to send prophets now. I'm going to
[2:18:32] veil myself. Instead of a fire and
[2:18:34] thunder and a mountain, I'm going to
[2:18:36] come like a man
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; with words."
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; But those words are still fire and
[2:18:40] thunder and lightning.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. just a different form. Same
[2:18:44] fire,
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; same thunder,
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; same lightning, same voice of God.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Surely the Lord God
[2:18:53] will do nothing
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; but reveal his secrets
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; to his servants, the prophets.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; But the next verse say, the lion had
[2:19:00] rod.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Who can but fear?
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; The Lord God had spoken.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; Who can but prophesy
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; and we prophesy today
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; because the Lord God had spoken.
[2:19:12] Oh, could we give the Lord a shout of
[2:19:14] praise?
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10 8:11.
[2:19:19] And another my angel angel said, "Go and
[2:19:21] take the book."
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; And the hands of the angel said, "Give
[2:19:23] me a little book.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; For thou must prophesy again
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; to many nation, kingdom, and tongue."

[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; to run over.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; You want it to get in the saucer.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praisees, people.
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout of praise.
[2:30:28] Hallelujah. When you're cuping over, you
[2:30:30] could share with your family. You could
[2:30:32] share with your friends. Listen, we
[2:30:34] don't ask enough.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; Man, I want to spend two more hours
[2:30:38] here. But we have evening service. We
[2:30:40] have communion.
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my. Listen listen. You must
[2:30:44] trouble God. You God must say you ask a
[2:30:45] hard thing.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; You're not asking hard things.
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; But what things will he bless me Lord?
[2:30:49] What is that? God say what is that? Are
[2:30:51] you doing that all the time? My blessing
[2:30:53] fall on just and unjust.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; You're not even specializing. You're
[2:30:56] asking for a blessing. Bless me Lord.
[2:30:57] Bless me Lord in Jesus name. What? What?
[2:30:59] What is that?
[2:31:01] God said I send rain on tomatoes and
[2:31:02] marijuana.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; Ganja getting rain. Tomatoes getting
[2:31:06] rain. Everything getting rain. That's
[2:31:08] blessing.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; You want that?
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; You want more than that.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; You want specifics.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; Start to talk specifics.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; When Abraham was talking to God, he
[2:31:20] said, "Oh, it is I'm going to be father
[2:31:21] of nations." And I got childless.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; What you talking about? You are my
[2:31:25] reward. What said come I want to talk

[2:31:34] back talk. I'll put a prophecy over you.
[2:31:37] That woman Sarah she old but she coming
[2:31:39] through.
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; That's a show word of prophecy. Take
[2:31:42] that and hold that. Oh give the Lord
[2:31:44] some praises people.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; When David saw Goliath and David and
[2:31:52] Golad say am I a dog? God gave Golad
[2:31:54] shock treatment. Because Goliath looking
[2:31:57] for somebody to come with some muscles
[2:31:58] who pumping in the gym.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; So God is no gym man cuz he want the
[2:32:03] biggest one among them. God gave him
[2:32:04] shock treatment and send a little boy
[2:32:05] David

[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; It's a pure fake talking
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; because he's a slingshot man. He's not a
[2:32:26] sword man. He's a slingshot man. So for
[2:32:28] him to speak, he was moved by the
[2:32:30] spirit.
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; He was moved by the spirit.
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; To speak that
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; That's not normal.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; God
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; right now. We not normal.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; Moved by the spirit and cut your head
[2:32:42] off
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; without a sword.
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; Without a sword.
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; Without a sword.
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout in the house.
[2:32:55] Hallelujah.
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; Cut your head off.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; Then David had to do his sling thing.
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; You're custom using sling.
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; David wasn't gosh.
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; I wonder if I go miss.
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; There's no missing in David. Hallelujah.
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; They couldn't miss.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; Everything was right.
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; He was right.
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; Stone was right.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; Stling was right. Hallelujah.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; The swing was right. The anointing was
[2:33:30] right. The prophecy was right. How could
[2:33:32] he fail? How could you fail? Time is
[2:33:35] right. Prophecy is right. The swing is
[2:33:38] right. The anointing is right.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:33:50] Friends,
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; may be seated.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; We have to come to a spot.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; Where we are breaking into an absolute
[2:33:56] faith.
[2:33:57] &gt;&gt; A faith that can't fail.
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; A faith that can't back down.
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; A faith that is true.
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; A faith that is real.
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; A faith that has been restored.
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; And William Brham has restored the
[2:34:10] faith.
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory not God will.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; He has restored. We are preaching it. We
[2:34:17] are speaking it. We are living it. We
[2:34:20] are expressing it. We are believing it.
[2:34:22] We are walking in it.
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; The faith
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; that was once delivered to the saints.
[2:34:28] Oh, give the Lord some praise this
[2:34:29] people. My God. My Lord. My Lord. My
[2:34:34] Lord.
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; Listen. Listen. You don't have to worry.
[2:34:41] You don't know all the tapes.
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; You don't know all the books. You don't
[2:34:45] know all the codes. That is not as
[2:34:46] important
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; as the dynamics itself.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; Listen, as I said,
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; when you go and start your car to drive,
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; you don't say that the points,
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; the plugs, that the condenser, that the
[2:34:57] radiator, that's the fan.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; You don't need all that information.
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; Keep the bonnet down.
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; Have the key,
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; start the car,
[2:35:06] [Applause]
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; if it break down, call the mechanic.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; You don't have to do nothing with that.
[2:35:11] You want dynamics. You wanted to turn
[2:35:13] the key, the car tumble.
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; If the car tumble, it's trouble.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. But once your car
[2:35:19] tumble,
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; it's time to drive.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; That is what you want to know. You don't
[2:35:23] want to know the mechanics. You want to
[2:35:25] know the dynamics, how this thing does
[2:35:27] work, how the devils be cast out, how
[2:35:30] the sick is healed. Oh, glory to God.
[2:35:32] That is what you want to know.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You want to see it working
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; in your heart and in your life.
[2:35:44] Hallelujah.
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; Change what you're doing.
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; If what you're doing is the same thing
[2:35:50] over the years and getting same results,
[2:35:52] you could continue doing the same thing
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; and expect a different result.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; That when people going cuckoo
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; 2 plus 2 will always equal four.
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; You expecting five
[2:36:06] from 2 plus two. You add it last year.
[2:36:09] You add it a year before. You add it the
[2:36:10] year before that. And this year, you're
[2:36:12] looking for five to come forth. But it's
[2:36:15] still 2 plus two. Something wrong with
[2:36:18] you. Nothing wrong with the two. Nothing
[2:36:20] wrong with the plus. Nothing wrong with
[2:36:22] the next two. Nothing wrong with the
[2:36:23] equal sign. Something wrong with you.
[2:36:25] You can't expect five when 2 plus 2 is
[2:36:28] four. Come on, say amen, somebody. And
[2:36:30] if you're expecting a revival, oh glor,
[2:36:32] do something about it. Come on now.
[2:36:34] Create the atmosphere. Oh, do something
[2:36:37] about it. Glory to God. I began those
[2:36:41] blessing for the last 20 years. This is
[2:36:44] not that time. Yesterday was yesterday,
[2:36:47] but today is the day. No, this is
[2:37:10] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You may be seated. If you
[2:37:21] don't want to shout, I will shout.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; If you don't want to jump, I will jump.
[2:37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:25] &gt;&gt; I am free.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I come from up there.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; Praise devil. It's too late. Yeah,
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; it's almost 40 plus years I this
[2:37:32] message. Almost 40 years. Isn't that
[2:37:34] right? Praise God. So what? If you
[2:37:36] couldn't catch me all these years, you
[2:37:38] catch me now. It's too late.
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; I have a sure word of prophecy.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; There's going to be an adoption. There's
[2:37:45] going to be the manifestation of the
[2:37:47] sons of God. When born sons, fil sons
[2:37:51] speak
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; and the word is created just like that.
[2:37:58] [Applause]
[2:38:05] Glory
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; glorymen.
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. my
[2:38:16] my my
[2:38:26] fire in my bones.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; Fire all over me.
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; It is all over me,
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; giving me alive.
[2:38:33] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost and fire.
[2:38:35] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost and power.
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; It is giving me alive.
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; I know. I know we going past time, but
[2:38:45] we got to finish.
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; We got it. See the change
[2:38:49] &gt;&gt; from the prophet
[2:38:51] &gt;&gt; to the prophecy.
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; Let me see if we can skip down here.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; But say the voice of God.
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; How will we know it's the voice of God?
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; Because it was then in a vinegated
[2:39:00] prophet.
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; Today, how will we know it's the voice
[2:39:02] of God? Because it's the manifestation
[2:39:05] of the prophet's word.
[2:39:07] &gt;&gt; Not playing back the prophet's word.
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; No, the manifestation of the prophet's
[2:39:11] word. That's how we know it's the voice
[2:39:14] of God.
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:16] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said once more
[2:39:18] &gt;&gt; the world will hear
[2:39:19] &gt;&gt; direct from God.
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; Once more there will be the voice of God
[2:39:24] that will thunder out to the world.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; Once more the world will be shaken.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; A short quick message that going to
[2:39:30] shake the whole nation.
[2:39:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:33] &gt;&gt; The true voice of God only brings back
[2:39:36] real supernatural God with his
[2:39:38] supernatural word.
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; I'm going to sing it here. I'm going to
[2:39:41] close. Almost halfway through.
[2:39:42] Hallelujah. I think I'm going to
[2:39:43] continue
[2:39:44] &gt;&gt; in the evening service.
[2:39:45] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; John 1:29.
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:49] &gt;&gt; We read the scripture.
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; John said Jesus and said, "Behold the
[2:39:53] lamb of God." Hallelujah.
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; This is heal
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; of whom it was said, "A man cometh which
[2:39:57] prefer before me." Hallelujah.
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; Because he was before me.
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; My Jesus.
[2:40:00] &gt;&gt; John bear record. I saw the spirit
[2:40:03] descending upon him. John bear record.
[2:40:06] This is not a confirmation, a
[2:40:08] vindication to the prophecy that God
[2:40:11] gave John upon the one whom you seen the
[2:40:14] spirit descended. John said, "I bear
[2:40:16] record. I see the spirit. I see the
[2:40:18] anointing. I see dynamics come upon
[2:40:21] Jesus."
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; Here we go.
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; Again, the next day.
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; The next day.
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; John with stood with two disciples
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; looking upon Jesus.
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; All right. He said, "Behold the lamb of
[2:40:37] God."
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; And here we go.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; Get the bomb. And the two disciples
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; heard him speak.
[2:40:44] &gt;&gt; And they followed Jesus.
[2:40:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:50] &gt;&gt; Season change.
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; They were John disciples.
[2:40:53] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; Now they becoming Jesus disciples.
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; Because John came to introduce
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; Messiah.
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[2:41:02] William Brham came to introduce
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; Messiah.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:41:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham.
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; He came Malachi 4,
[2:41:23] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30, Russian 10:7. He came in in
[2:41:27] that Elijah form to introduce
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; Messiah.
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[2:41:33] &gt;&gt; Praise be to Jesus.
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I want to skip this. Went
[2:41:42] through time of lingering.
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; God is obligated to meet you on the
[2:41:45] basis of them promises. Outside of them
[2:41:47] promises, he can't meet you because he
[2:41:49] cut yourself out.
[2:41:51] &gt;&gt; So God meeting is based upon
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; promises, not church
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; promises. Amen.
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; Just just promises.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. So 1 Thessalonians
[2:41:59] 4:16, Lord himself, B say God does all
[2:42:02] three. Jesus does all three. Shout,
[2:42:04] voice, and trump.
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus came in a shout
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; that was appearing.
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; He comes in the voice.
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; Appearing.
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; And the third one is the trump.
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; That's his actual coming.
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[2:42:17] &gt;&gt; So came to do what? To restore back the
[2:42:19] faith.
[2:42:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; And then introduce Messiah.
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; Which is to reveal the son of man.
[2:42:24] &gt;&gt; My God. So it so happened that a son of
[2:42:26] man revealed the son of man. But it was
[2:42:28] two different people. It was be brother
[2:42:30] random here, son of man here. But it
[2:42:32] happened to be the same person revealing
[2:42:34] the son of man. So he was seventh angel
[2:42:37] Elijah Malachi 4 revealing Luke 17:30.
[2:42:40] So William Brandham as that Elijah could
[2:42:43] only reveal six seals because Christ was
[2:42:45] the seventh seal standing in the
[2:42:47] prophet.
[2:42:52] So William Brham veiled the mighty
[2:42:55] angel.
[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; He veiled Jesus Christ.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; He unveiled that God and put it on books
[2:43:01] and tapes.
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; And here we are.
[2:43:04] &gt;&gt; The secret is the word
[2:43:06] &gt;&gt; is in the pride. God is now veiled
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; in you. Hallelujah.
[2:43:11] &gt;&gt; In the form of the word.
[2:43:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Ride with me now.
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; Just a little more again.
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; Prophet said,
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; "All right,
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; watch." Remember, appearing and coming
[2:43:26] is two different words.
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; To appear then to come. Now is the
[2:43:30] appearing. All right?
[2:43:31] &gt;&gt; He appeared in the last days. Now is a
[2:43:33] sign of his coming.
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; His appearing in his church in the form
[2:43:37] of the Holy Spirit.
[2:43:39] &gt;&gt; So we have to see the Lord appear
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; before he comes. You can't say he coming
[2:43:43] and you don't see him appear. He has to
[2:43:45] appear. Then he comes. He appeared the
[2:43:48] prophet as the shout. He appearing the
[2:43:50] bra as the voice of the archangel.
[2:43:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises people.
[2:43:59] Give the Lord some praises. Who is doing
[2:44:01] that?
[2:44:02] &gt;&gt; The Lord himself.
[2:44:09] [Applause]
[2:44:17] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:44:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close.
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; But what's the attraction
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; of the mountain?
[2:44:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; He said was God's fulfilling his word.
[2:44:27] &gt;&gt; We find out that John was so positive.
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; He said there is one standing among you.
[2:44:30] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; Whose shoes
[2:44:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy to bear.
[2:44:34] &gt;&gt; He will baptize you
[2:44:35] &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost and fire.
[2:44:37] &gt;&gt; As I have baptized with water.
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:39] &gt;&gt; One day. Here we go. All right.
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; An ordinary young man
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; about 30 years old
[2:44:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; walked down
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[2:44:45] &gt;&gt; and was baptized
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; and when this man come
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; all right
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; there was such an attraction by the
[2:44:49] prophet
[2:44:50] &gt;&gt; there was strange that day the
[2:44:52] congregation couldn't help
[2:44:53] &gt;&gt; from watching the action of the prophet
[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; as I was debating with the priest across
[2:44:57] the water
[2:44:58] &gt;&gt; I hear John said have not you read the
[2:45:00] scripture where Daniel said the
[2:45:02] sacrifice shall be taken away
[2:45:04] &gt;&gt; I am the voice of one cry in the
[2:45:05] wilderness Malachi spoke in the third
[2:45:07] chapter behold I send my messenger
[2:45:09] before my face
[2:45:10] &gt;&gt; to prepare the way
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; don't you know this fulfilled prophecy
[2:45:14] &gt;&gt; prophecy being fulfilled
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; and about that time here we go this is
[2:45:17] where I get inspiration from about that
[2:45:19] time
[2:45:19] &gt;&gt; the prophet turn and said behold there
[2:45:22] comes the lamb of God
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; that takes away
[2:45:25] &gt;&gt; the world
[2:45:25] &gt;&gt; thank you Jesus
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; what was the attraction
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; are you ready
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; come up please what was the attraction
[2:45:32] &gt;&gt; it changed from the prophety
[2:45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen
[2:45:35] &gt;&gt; from the prophet from the prophet to his
[2:45:38] prophecy
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; all Amen.
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And I believe today
[2:45:42] &gt;&gt; it's changed
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; from the prophet
[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; to the prophecy.
[2:45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:46] &gt;&gt; They say we're not playing the tapes and
[2:45:48] so on. Too bad.
[2:45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God in a prophet.
[2:45:51] &gt;&gt; But the prophet brought a prophecy of a
[2:45:53] seventh bride revival.
[2:45:54] &gt;&gt; The prophet a prophecy
[2:45:56] &gt;&gt; that people will be flying in looking
[2:45:58] for that seventh thunder manifestation.
[2:46:00] We are here.
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; We are under the anointing of a sure
[2:46:04] word of prophecy.
[2:46:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:46:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:10] &gt;&gt; Let me drop this bomb on you.
[2:46:13] &gt;&gt; Christ himself.
[2:46:14] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:46:15] &gt;&gt; The gospel, the message. When once you
[2:46:18] see the message of the hour, everything
[2:46:20] else is gone. The rest of it is just
[2:46:22] filler
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; once you see the message.
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; My Jesus.
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; You have a box here. A gift
[2:46:28] &gt;&gt; wrapping paper have them little kind of
[2:46:30] plastic, them kind of soft thing inside
[2:46:31] it.
[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; Right. The box is not the gift.
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; The gift is inside.
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; You tear off the box. It have filler
[2:46:37] things inside of there. Sometime they
[2:46:39] get small
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; and they put in a big box all filler
[2:46:42] material.
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; Once you see the message, everything
[2:46:44] else is just filler material because you
[2:46:46] see the real thing.
[2:46:48] &gt;&gt; Here we go. Watch. Watch. In Noah group
[2:46:51] when they saw the message, nothing else
[2:46:53] matters. Moses group saw it. Nothing
[2:46:54] matters. John group saw it. Nothing
[2:46:56] matters. When Jesus group saw it,
[2:46:58] nothing matters
[2:46:59] &gt;&gt; when you see it.
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; Watch. John still had disciples.
[2:47:04] &gt;&gt; John had disciples. But these two
[2:47:06] disciples here when John say behold the
[2:47:08] lamb of God they say all right John I go
[2:47:11] on
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; the Bible said they follow Jesus.
[2:47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; Because they saw it.
[2:47:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:47:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the message.
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Give the Lord a shout.
[2:47:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the message.
[2:47:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with these words.
[2:47:28] &gt;&gt; When the seven angels come from
[2:47:29] eternity,
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; it was one way.
[2:47:31] &gt;&gt; All right. And one day the Holy Spirit
[2:47:33] told the brother Brandham, "Are you
[2:47:35] looking at the picture right?
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; Turn it to the right." And when he
[2:47:39] turned it to the right, it formed this
[2:47:40] year
[2:47:42] &gt;&gt; the wig
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; from seven angels
[2:47:45] &gt;&gt; to Christ.
[2:47:47] &gt;&gt; And that is what Peter, you want to make
[2:47:49] one for Moses, one for Elias. A voice
[2:47:51] said, "Shut up.
[2:47:53] &gt;&gt; This is my beloved son in whom I will
[2:47:54] please. Hear ye him."
[2:47:57] &gt;&gt; Time to see Jesus.
[2:47:59] &gt;&gt; Time to turn away from all the sevens.
[2:48:01] all the numbers runs out and you'll
[2:48:02] begin to see Christ.
[2:48:04] &gt;&gt; The Lord himself.
[2:48:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham came to introduce the
[2:48:08] Lord himself.
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; And the scripture declared the Lord
[2:48:11] himself went everywhere with them
[2:48:15] confirming the word with signs
[2:48:17] following. God bless you. See you this
[2:48:19] evening.
[2:48:21] [Music]
[2:48:21] [Applause]
[2:48:26] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[3:02:37] God a high note of praise for his
[3:02:39] healing power. I've been suffering from
[3:02:41] dizziness for the past five months and
[3:02:44] on the Saturday morning of the
[3:02:46] convention when I awoke all dizziness
[3:02:48] was gone. Thank you Lord. Oh, that is
[3:02:51] wonderful.
[3:02:53] As the word goes forth, as Peter yet
[3:02:55] spoke the word. Hallelujah. How many are
[3:02:58] so grateful for the convention, for the
[3:03:01] mighty visitation, for the word of God
[3:03:04] that was spoken to encourage us, to push
[3:03:07] us along the journey, to remind us of
[3:03:10] who we are and who is we are. Amen. We
[3:03:14] have two prayer requests we want to take
[3:03:16] to the throne of grace.
[3:03:20] from Sister Gloria Timothy. Please pray
[3:03:22] for Sister Marcia Nicholas. She had a
[3:03:25] bad fall and is experiencing pain in her
[3:03:28] face and body.
[3:03:31] And from Brother Anthony O'Brien, please
[3:03:33] pray for my wife, Sister Kershaw. She is
[3:03:35] she has swelling on her mouth and lips,
[3:03:38] skin breaking out in hives, allergic
[3:03:40] reactions, and chest pains. I believe by
[3:03:43] faith God can push back these symptoms
[3:03:45] and deliver her with healing in the name
[3:03:48] of Jesus Christ. And we believe that
[3:03:50] this morning and as we approach the
[3:03:52] throne of grace, if you want to show by
[3:03:53] raise of hands as we come together as a
[3:03:56] body of believers understanding the
[3:03:58] power that is in the church of the
[3:04:01] living God. Brother Raymond Thompson
[3:04:03] ended the convention with God's power is
[3:04:05] your power. All that was in God, he
[3:04:07] poured into Christ. And all that was in
[3:04:09] Christ, he poured into the church of the
[3:04:11] living God. So this morning we stand on
[3:04:13] the foundation of faith, but beyond that
[3:04:16] we stand on the foundation of knowing
[3:04:18] that there's power in the church of the
[3:04:19] living God over every sickness, over
[3:04:21] every disease, over every problem, over
[3:04:24] every situation, be it physical, be it
[3:04:27] spiritual, be it whatever it might be
[3:04:29] this morning, we approach the throne of
[3:04:31] grace this morning. Oh gracious heavenly
[3:04:33] father, we thank you this morning to be
[3:04:35] in your house, Lord. Lord, those that
[3:04:37] are here physically in the building,
[3:04:39] those that were connected online, Lord,
[3:04:41] to hear direct from you, a more sure
[3:04:43] word of prophecy that we are standing on
[3:04:46] a sure word of prophecy, Lord, that you
[3:04:48] sent a prophet, Lord, to point us, Lord,
[3:04:51] to you, Father, so that we could have
[3:04:53] clarity and plainess, Lord, that this
[3:04:56] word could never fail. Father, we thank
[3:04:58] you that you are the same yesterday,
[3:05:00] today, and forever. We thank you for the
[3:05:02] ministry that we are under. We thank you
[3:05:03] for our pastor this morning, Lord, and
[3:05:06] how you have blessed us and how you have
[3:05:07] kept us all these years, Lord. To think
[3:05:10] this message was preached in 2017 and
[3:05:12] here we are in 2025, Lord. And it's
[3:05:15] fresh food for us this morning. So,
[3:05:17] Father, may you bless your people. And
[3:05:19] as we, Lord, approach these prayer
[3:05:21] requests, Father. Lord, for Marcia
[3:05:24] Nicholas had a fall and is experiencing
[3:05:26] pain in her face and her body, Father,
[3:05:28] may you visit her even now. And may you
[3:05:31] touch her from the crown of her head to
[3:05:32] the soles of her feet. Lord, may the
[3:05:34] pain dissolve. May all that is wrong be
[3:05:37] right. May the angel of the Lord pass by
[3:05:40] way in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
[3:05:42] And may this prayer request come back as
[3:05:44] a note of praise. Uh Lord that you are
[3:05:46] still in the healing business. You are
[3:05:48] still in the restoration business. You
[3:05:50] are still in the deliverance business.
[3:05:52] And Lord, we bring Sister Kershaw before
[3:05:54] you this morning. Lord, the enemy has
[3:05:57] been attacking and the enemy has been
[3:05:59] doing. But Lord, we come today knowing
[3:06:02] where we are, who we are, what we are
[3:06:04] called to do. And we say, Satan, take
[3:06:07] your hand off of God, daughter, in the
[3:06:09] mighty name of Jesus Christ. We speak
[3:06:12] against the swelling and the the hives
[3:06:15] and the allergic reactions. Father God,
[3:06:17] may you visit your daughter even now.
[3:06:19] May you touch her from the crown of her
[3:06:21] head to the soles of her feet. May you
[3:06:24] do a miracle in her life today. May you
[3:06:26] touch her completely. May you heal her
[3:06:29] completely. Lord, not just the symptoms,
[3:06:31] but whatever the cause of the problem,
[3:06:34] house of hell, give way to the name of
[3:06:36] Jesus. Lord, you taught us healing is
[3:06:38] the children's bread. Oh God, we pray
[3:06:41] for healing of our sister in the mighty
[3:06:43] name of Jesus Christ. And father, all
[3:06:45] over the buildings, hands were raised
[3:06:48] up. Lord, different people with
[3:06:49] different situations, different
[3:06:51] struggles, different problems, different
[3:06:53] ailies, different things. Father, Lord,
[3:06:55] we plead the blood over your house,
[3:06:57] Father. Lord, may you minister to your
[3:06:59] children. May you heal, may you touch,
[3:07:02] may you set free, may you deliver in the
[3:07:04] mighty name of Jesus Christ, Father. And
[3:07:08] Lord, as we come to the end of this
[3:07:09] service, Father, we pray that you would
[3:07:11] strengthen your people, strengthen your
[3:07:13] sons, strengthen your daughters, Father.
[3:07:16] Lord, we pray for our pastor in a
[3:07:17] special way that you would touch him
[3:07:19] from the crown of his head to the soles
[3:07:20] of his feet. Lord, Sister Anmirie, also
[3:07:23] Lord, the family, Lord, the church,
[3:07:26] Lord, the elders, the deacons, the
[3:07:27] ushers, the musicians, the technicians,
[3:07:29] the helps and governments, Lord, every
[3:07:32] single brother, sister of the church.
[3:07:34] Father, those that are here, those that
[3:07:36] are not here, Father, even around the
[3:07:38] the the local churches and around the
[3:07:40] bride around the world, Father, Lord, we
[3:07:43] are as one Lord, one faith, one baptism.
[3:07:45] Lord, may you strengthen your church.
[3:07:47] May you strengthen your believers,
[3:07:49] Father. May you be with us as we see the
[3:07:51] soon approaching of us leaving this
[3:07:54] place. We know that time is short.
[3:07:56] Father, may you touch your people one
[3:07:57] more time and may you bring us back at
[3:07:59] the appointed time in the precious name
[3:08:01] of Jesus Christ. And the church says,
[3:08:04] &gt;&gt; And the church says,
[3:08:06] &gt;&gt; "Amen." And amen. You may be seated for
[3:08:10] a few announcements.

[3:09:32] of work a lot of moving pieces but we
[3:09:34] believe that God got the glory and God's
[3:09:37] people were blessed and we have so many
[3:09:39] testimonies coming in uh from within the
[3:09:41] church from many churches locally as
[3:09:44] well as internationally. So we thank God
[3:09:46] for his grace, for his love and to see

[3:09:50] tremendous things before we leave this
[3:09:52] place. So continue to remember uh the
[3:09:54] ministry in prayer as we continue to
[3:09:57] press the battle. Uh just a couple
[3:10:00] points just to bring to your attention

[3:11:05] willing I'll be speaking on the 8th
[3:11:07] which is the last service of the meeting
[3:11:09] on August 8th Friday August 8th. So, if

[3:11:43] get so caught up in the spirit you miss
[3:11:44] a few things we encourage you you have

[3:11:53] eating good you can eat again and again
[3:11:55] and again there's food to keep
[3:11:56] nourishing you it's there as preaching

[3:12:01] to have 24/7 church you have 24/7 church
[3:12:04] because all these services are there. So
[3:12:06] may the Lord richly bless you. Stay on
[3:12:07] the firing line, brother Anthony. And
