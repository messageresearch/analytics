[18:21] this evening? Oh, he's among his people.
[18:24] We're so grateful and is just so
[18:26] wonderful. Now, we ready to switch over
[18:27] to the word. So you may have your seats.
[18:30] We're about to have a tape play this
[18:31] evening and it's hearing recognizing and
[18:34] acting upon the word of God preached by
[18:37] our precious William Mariam Brandom,
[18:39] God's prophet. Amen. So God, would you
[18:41] bless you as you put the tape on? May
[18:43] you receive faith in Jesus name by the
[18:45] word of God as we hear it. Amen. Praise
[18:48] God.
[19:14] and that's what they will do.
[19:18] Compromise. Someone said, "Billy, if you
[19:20] don't stop that, you'll run everybody
[19:22] away." There's one thing that won't go,
[19:24] the Holy Spirit, because it's his word.
[19:27] And the real predestinated believer
[19:29] won't go away because it's food to his
[19:32] soul. He loves it.
[19:35] Nothing can keep him away from it. He'll
[19:37] do anything like Jacob, but he wants
[19:39] that birthright. He'll stand there. I
[19:42] don't care if it cost every friend he's
[19:43] got. If it cost his job, if it cost his
[19:46] church membership, if it cost
[19:48] everything, he'll still hold to it cuz
[19:51] he can't help it. There's something in
[19:52] him moving him. The de calling him to
[19:56] the dean. Oh, praise the Lord. There you
[20:00] are. Thank you, Jesus. something in him.
[20:03] Look, anything you want to find in the
[20:06] Bible and pick it up here. Go back to
[20:07] Genesis and see where it hatched out of.
[20:09] See word come to all the spirits and
[20:11] moves today. Go back to Genesis. That's
[20:13] what we've done to prove to you these
[20:16] things that you're seeing, friends.
[20:20] Don't forget that. Don't let it go over
[20:22] top of your head. Let it soak into you.
[20:26] That's the things of God. Hallelujah.
[20:29] That come to a head. And Jesus predicted
[20:32] it would come to a head again in the
[20:33] last days.
[20:35] And it would be by this, the seal of God
[20:38] and the mark of the beast. Two spiritual
[20:41] powers working together. Now anyone
[20:44] knows that the seal of God is the
[20:45] birthright.
[20:47] The baptism of the Holy Ghost. Ephesians
[20:50] 4:30 says, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit
[20:52] of God, whereby you're sealed to the day
[20:54] of your redemption. When they were born
[20:56] again, they were filled with the Holy
[20:57] Spirit." The Holy Spirit is the new
[20:59] birth. We know that you're you're
[21:01] begotten of the spirit. I'll admit that.
[21:04] But until you're born, there's a baby's
[21:06] begotten in its mother's womb. It's got
[21:08] one kind of life. That's life and it's
[21:10] little the little um cells in it
[21:13] twisting and kicking and jumping like
[21:15] that. But when it's born, it has a like
[21:19] that and then it squeals out.
[21:22] It becomes a living soul.
[21:25] And a baby can go to church and say,
[21:26] "Well, I believe in church. I I'll go
[21:28] I'll do this and I'm a good I want to do
[21:30] right. I want to do right. But what it
[21:32] needs is a gospel spank to wake it up to
[21:37] squeal to eternal life. The Holy Spirit
[21:40] screams in it like it never screamed
[21:43] before
[21:44] and it's a new creature. It's born of
[21:48] the spirit and begins to grow, move, and
[21:51] have its being in God. See, just as a
[21:54] baby, natural baby has his being in the
[21:56] world. Then if this earthly tabernacle
[21:59] be dissolved, we have one waiting. See,
[22:02] just as sure as the natural body was
[22:04] coming forth, there's a spiritual body
[22:05] to receive it when it dropped from its
[22:07] mother. And when it drops from the
[22:08] mother earth, which is it's in the womb
[22:10] of it now, groaning, crying, oh, oh God,
[22:16] groaning, laboring, getting old, and
[22:19] sickness and everything besetting it,
[22:22] and a spirit on the inside of it,
[22:24] looking for a land beyond the river.
[22:27] It's groaning, twisting, jumping.
[22:31] That's it. That's sir, because there's a
[22:33] life in there that lives forever.
[22:35] It's in a body that's got to die.
[22:38] Sometime this is a mother drop the
[22:40] natural baby in a spiritual body. Got
[22:41] it? The earth will drop in the body if
[22:44] the natural will drop and the physical
[22:47] body or the celestial body will grab it.
[22:51] This earthly tabernacle be dissolved. We
[22:53] have one waiting.
[22:55] That's the reason you forget the things
[22:56] of the world. They're dead to you.
[22:59] There's the spirit. Now watch it as we
[23:01] move on. Now, the two spirits, the Holy
[23:04] Ghost is the new birth. We know that
[23:07] it's being born again of the spirit of
[23:08] God. That's how you're born by the
[23:10] spirit. Born by the spirit. That's the
[23:14] new birth. All right? You're begotten of
[23:17] the spirit. Then when you're born of the
[23:19] spirit, you're filled with the Holy
[23:21] Ghost. All right? Then when these two
[23:24] are in the earth, the natural and the
[23:26] spiritual,
[23:29] um, sometimes
[23:31] the I've seen this now in closing, I
[23:34] want to come to a close now by saying
[23:36] this for a few
[23:39] minutes. In the natural or in the
[23:44] spiritual, either one.
[23:49] Now, I hope that everyone catches this.
[23:52] Now, be just as quiet and reverent as
[23:54] you can.
[23:57] Now, have you ever seen
[24:00] this? You've seen in our churches today,
[24:03] even in the groups where we have
[24:07] separated oursel and made organizations
[24:09] and we've seen all of this. And you've
[24:12] seen a man pick up a certain
[24:14] scripture and brother, that man can take
[24:17] that scripture and make it live new,
[24:19] make it live just exactly what it
[24:21] promised you in the Bible. And the next
[24:23] man will see him do it and he'll come
[24:25] around and try to do it and fail.
[24:29] I hope you're reading now.
[24:32] He'll fail. Why? The scripture is not
[24:36] inspired to him.
[24:38] He's only trying to impersonate.
[24:42] He's trying to act like something. He
[24:44] want maybe he was sent by man. Maybe
[24:47] some man said, "Well, you can do the
[24:48] same thing."
[24:50] Just like Jesus said it would be this
[24:52] way. The Bible predicts it in the last
[24:54] days as Jammers and Jamies which stood
[24:56] Moses. Yeah. Amen. There stood Moses and
[25:00] there stood Jamies and Moses threw down
[25:02] his rod and it become a serpent. Why?
[25:05] Pharaoh said, "Come here Jamies. You can
[25:06] do the same thing." And he didn't see.
[25:10] But what happened then? Moses' rod eat
[25:14] up the rod of his. See, it was made
[25:18] manifest. Where was his rod? Just like
[25:21] superstion perception. It's like some of
[25:24] the spiritualism. It's like some of
[25:26] these churches that they believe carnal
[25:28] way away. The things they say, "Well,
[25:30] that was for another day." They're all
[25:32] together out. But watch this spirit in
[25:34] the last days going to impersonate the
[25:36] real spirit. See, that's where your
[25:38] trouble's coming. just exactly like the
[25:42] one that's real.
[25:44] But he couldn't make it manifest. He
[25:46] couldn't make it whole. He couldn't make
[25:48] it last.
[25:50] Oh, God.
[25:53] People come up and say, "I got the Holy
[25:54] Ghost, too." Look way they live.
[25:57] It don't last.
[25:59] From one revival to another, from one
[26:02] meeting to another, it's made
[26:04] manifest. They haven't got it. If a
[26:07] man's born of the spirit of God or a
[26:09] woman, they have the fruit of the
[26:11] spirit. They walk godly. They live that
[26:13] life. See, they keep away from the
[26:16] things of the world. God moves in them
[26:18] and makes himself manifest and proves
[26:20] that he's God working in there. The
[26:23] other is impersonating.
[26:25] See, impersonations, that's what's been
[26:28] all the way down. Impersonating. Look at
[26:30] Ishmael and Isaac. All down. See,
[26:33] impersonating.
[26:34] Look at the prophet Moses and look at
[26:36] the prophet
[26:37] Balam. See? See how they come down? Look
[26:40] at Judas and look at Jesus. And Jesus
[26:43] predicts that this Holy Spirit in the
[26:45] last days would be the seal of God. Now,
[26:48] what would be the mark of the beast?
[26:51] Would be to reject the seal of God. For
[26:56] all that didn't have the seal of God had
[26:59] the mark of the beast. And if it's two
[27:01] spiritual
[27:03] marks, one of them will be a true mark
[27:05] of God, the other will be apostasy.
[27:08] Can you see it?
[27:10] Look at the mark in the Old Testament
[27:12] when the trumpet blow the Jubilee. Ever
[27:14] so many years the the slaves went free
[27:17] because the trumpet sounded. Well,
[27:19] everyone that wanted to be free could
[27:21] go. But some of them they love to be
[27:23] slaves. So they tuck them to the altar
[27:26] and in the post of the church and bored
[27:28] their ear with an all and they were
[27:30] marked forever. They always served that
[27:33] master. And today you'll hear a gospel
[27:36] message on
[27:37] truth. Now you can be free if you want
[27:40] to.
[27:42] God speaks to you. But when you get up
[27:44] to that borderline here and look over
[27:46] and have a knowledge truth and then turn
[27:48] away,
[27:50] he bores you. in the ear and you'll
[27:53] always be an intellectual believer.
[27:55] You'll be religious and go to church,
[27:57] but never receive the Holy Ghost.
[28:00] Then you serve that the rest of your
[28:02] days. Now, the mark of the beast or the
[28:05] seal of God, and we're getting so close.
[28:09] Now, look, the word has to be inspired
[28:11] hearing it.
[28:13] Amen. recognizing it and acting upon it.
[28:19] Many people are here but won't recognize
[28:23] it. God will see this is the hour for
[28:27] you. I wouldn't be a holy roller and I
[28:30] don't want none of that. See, they don't
[28:33] recognize it. We'll go to meetings. The
[28:36] great Holy Spirit will move down.
[28:39] I was sitting there the other day when a
[28:42] vision came forth and predicted just
[28:44] exactly what I said. Here comes a young
[28:46] man. Come here. Motion to that
[28:49] waiter. You have heart trouble and
[28:51] you're looking for it's exactly right.
[28:53] See that woman coming out? Come
[28:55] here. You got tumor on the breast. It's
[28:58] on the left breast and you're in a very
[29:00] bad shape and you're a sinner and no.
[29:02] Exactly right. Those men sat there and
[29:04] looked around preachers and all. No.
[29:08] go to a meeting and watch the Holy
[29:09] Spirit go right out through the meeting
[29:10] and tell the secrets of the hearts thing
[29:12] like I say
[29:15] wonderful see. Oh brother, see it it's
[29:19] it's on the other side there and a dog
[29:22] to its
[29:23] vom just the same. Don't you see
[29:27] I'm talking to the end the see you must
[29:31] realize then friend what condition
[29:32] you're in. That's the reason this tape I
[29:34] said to church
[29:36] only. The church only. If you've been
[29:40] called from life, from darkness unto
[29:43] life, from death unto
[29:45] life, from a formal interlection,
[29:48] conception of Christ to a bornagain
[29:50] experience and watching your life that
[29:52] it lays the things of the world aside.
[29:54] You stand for Christ regardless. And
[29:57] something happened. See, there's
[29:59] something in you hungering and moving
[30:00] like it was Jacob. your wrestle with the
[30:04] Lord. You walk different after that.
[30:06] Something's different in you. You've
[30:08] changed. Now, it has before it can be
[30:11] done, it has to be inspired to you. I
[30:13] don't care. I can stand here and preach
[30:15] till I got what hair I got left fell out
[30:18] till my shoulder stooped down and I was
[30:20] 90 years old and you listen every day
[30:22] until God quickens that to you. Amen.
[30:27] You're still in the same shape.
[30:30] Amen. Two days I've been studying and
[30:33] praying on this. I said, "Lord, should I
[30:36] say that to the church?" Someone said,
[30:38] "Say it." Amen. The hour is at hand.
[30:41] That's it. Say it.
[30:44] I feel he be pulling me away pretty
[30:46] soon. So I I want you to know it.
[30:50] No man can come to me, said Jesus,
[30:52] except my father draws him first. Oh, I
[30:54] know you say you have God and Abraham to
[30:56] your father. But I tell you this, you're
[30:59] the your father, the devil, said Jesus,
[31:01] religious man, priest and great man. You
[31:05] are the devil, your father. See, notice
[31:09] the fruits of the spirit. Now, see, it
[31:11] has to be quickened to you. I couldn't
[31:14] imagine Noah saying, you know what? It
[31:17] just must be it might rain someday. So,
[31:19] I'll just go out and build me an ark. If
[31:21] it rains, well, I get in the ark and
[31:22] move right away. And nothing will bother
[31:24] me because I'm going to get the ark and
[31:26] move away. Could you imagine? No, that
[31:28] wasn't it. If that had been it, oh, may
[31:32] the elected hear it
[31:35] now. If that would have been it, the
[31:37] first scoffer come by as the Bible said
[31:39] there was scoffed at him. He'd laid his
[31:42] hammer down and walked away like man
[31:45] does today that starts out with Jesus.
[31:47] And when they look over and see the
[31:49] truth, they back away from it. They
[31:51] can't stand it. like that noted
[31:53] evangelist that it'll tear up my
[31:56] ministry. I don't care for a ministry
[31:58] that the Holy Ghost would tear up. It
[32:01] ought to be toise.
[32:04] Hallelujah. Now, but see, it's pride. So
[32:08] much man, so much person.
[32:11] Oh, notice in this. Now Noah was out in
[32:16] the field and he
[32:18] heard and he recognized
[32:21] and he acted.
[32:23] No matter how many scoffers come, he
[32:25] built right away. Noah, your holy ruler.
[32:28] Don't bother me a bit. Building away. He
[32:32] had heard. He had recognized it to be
[32:34] God.
[32:36] judged by the scriptures.
[32:38] And it was so he built right away on the
[32:42] ark regardless.
[32:46] Could you
[32:47] imagine? Could you ever imagine
[32:51] this? That Moses on his way to
[32:54] Egypt got out one day and said to Zepha,
[32:57] his wife, Zephra, you know what? I've
[33:00] polished up some of my grammar.
[33:04] I have got a little of my mathematics
[33:06] all straightened up and some of my
[33:08] geometry and oh many other things and my
[33:10] education since I've been hering sheep
[33:12] back here. I I've polished up on some of
[33:14] that. I made a mistake down in Egypt. I
[33:16] think I'll go down and correct it. I
[33:18] think it'll go down. No. The first wave
[33:21] come against him. He have fell right
[33:24] there. What did he do? He forgot all he
[33:28] ever known about dramaty and about uh
[33:30] his intellectual. It was the one got him
[33:32] in trouble. That's what's got the church
[33:34] in trouble today is too many educated
[33:36] preachers without being born of the
[33:38] spirit. Men and women like to listen to
[33:41] intellectual speeches instead of
[33:43] preaching the power and the resurrection
[33:44] of Jesus Christ. That's what's got us in
[33:47] trouble today. We don't need any more
[33:48] high schools and education for
[33:50] preachers. We need God called man that's
[33:54] filled with the Holy Spirit and not some
[33:57] man-made theology at some denomination.
[34:00] Right. He God called man.
[34:05] Moses was hurting sheep settle down and
[34:08] forgot. He not his intellectuals had
[34:10] failed. He not his education and
[34:11] failing. He's hurting sheep. But he
[34:17] heard off your shoes, Moses.
[34:21] The ground you're standing on is holy.
[34:24] He listened to it. What was it? The
[34:27] voice the angel had spoke was
[34:28] scriptural. Amen. He promised Abraham
[34:32] his father, "I'll visit the people after
[34:35] they have been down here for 400 years,
[34:37] and I'll take them out with a mighty
[34:38] arm."
[34:41] You recognize that that was God's
[34:43] scripture being made manifest.
[34:46] Let me stop a minute. Let this sink in.
[34:49] Can you see what I'm talking about
[34:51] today?
[34:53] God's words being made manifest right
[34:56] before you, and you don't realize it.
[35:02] Think now of Sodom and
[35:03] Gomorrah. Think of the promise of Christ
[35:06] for the last
[35:07] days. Moses recognized it. It was
[35:10] scriptural. It was a promise. He heard.
[35:13] He recognized something come in
[35:16] him, brother. He could go do it. Then
[35:20] he acted. He could go down and stop
[35:23] every Pharaoh.
[35:25] He could call plagues when he wanted to.
[35:29] He could open a Red Sea because he had
[35:32] heard. He had recognized. He was acting
[35:35] in God's
[35:37] spin. I'll be God to you. You be prophet
[35:40] to me. He said, and if he said, "I can't
[35:42] do it." He said, "Well, then you be God
[35:44] and let Aaron be your prophet. You must
[35:47] go anyhow."
[35:49] He never just said, "Well, maybe I ought
[35:50] to go down and straighten things up."
[35:52] Could you imagine Elijah on Mount Carmel
[35:54] said, "You know, this land's awful
[35:56] sinful. Perhaps maybe I ought to go out
[35:58] and tell Ahab. He ought to be ashamed of
[35:59] himself. Maybe I ought to go up on the
[36:02] mountain there and stay on and just fast
[36:04] so long till them people get so sick and
[36:06] tired to see me up there starving to
[36:07] death. No, no, that wasn't it. But he
[36:11] heard,
[36:15] he recognized
[36:17] and he acted. I have commanded the
[36:20] ravens to feed you. Get up there, my
[36:23] leader. Amen.
[36:27] When it come time for a showdown between
[36:30] Baal and God,
[36:33] he said, "Go get your
[36:35] sacrifices. Do anything to him you want
[36:38] to and call upon your God." When they
[36:41] cut themselves and had a lot of flesh
[36:42] and jumped up and down, had a lot of
[36:44] noise, he said, "Holler a little louder.
[36:46] Maybe he's gone pursuing some or he
[36:48] might be asleep."
[36:49] Oh, brother. Oh, brother. Well, you know
[36:53] what? He said, "I'm a believer in
[36:54] Jehovah, so I can do this anyhow." Oh,
[36:56] no. Don't you impersonate that.
[36:59] No, don't you try to be Elijah till God
[37:01] called you to be.
[37:04] Yes, sir. I'm a servant of Jehovah.
[37:07] There's 700 of them down there, too. But
[37:09] none of them dared to do it.
[37:12] Then when he cut the block and poured
[37:14] the water on, he said, "Lord, I've done
[37:16] this at your command." Amen.
[37:19] See the anybody else would have tried it
[37:21] would have been a total failure. It's
[37:24] got to be inspired to you. The Holy
[37:26] Spirit has to bring it and make it
[37:28] manifest to you. That's what's the
[37:30] matter today. You can't get up the altar
[37:32] and say, "Well, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[37:34] Lord, I want the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[37:36] Hallelujah." No. But brother, sister,
[37:38] when the Holy Ghost has inspired that
[37:40] word to you,
[37:42] you'll get it before you leave your
[37:43] seat. Amen. Something in you burning up.
[37:46] Wow. Preacher won't have to tell you do
[37:48] this and do that. The old leaves will
[37:50] just pop off and new leaves will come
[37:51] on. It's inspired to you. You won't get
[37:55] angry with the preacher when he preaches
[37:56] truth from the Bible. You'll love it.
[37:59] Reach for it. It's food to your soul.
[38:04] Even Jesus himself. He said, "I do not
[38:07] what I want to do within myself. The son
[38:10] can do nothing but what he sees the
[38:12] father doing." Amen. the words. He was
[38:15] Emanuel himself. He was God on earth.
[38:18] Jesus was. He was the flesh that God
[38:21] dwelt in. He was a tent that God lived
[38:23] under. Amen. But in all of that, the
[38:27] virgin born son of God, Emmanuel in the
[38:30] fullness of the spirit, he had the
[38:32] spirit without measure. Amen. Yet in his
[38:34] own flesh, he said, "I'll do nothing
[38:38] until the father shows me first."
[38:40] Inspired to him to do it. Satan said,
[38:43] "Turn these stones into bread and
[38:44] perform a miracle. Let me see you do
[38:46] it." He said, "It's written, man shall
[38:48] not live by bread alone." Hallelujah.
[38:51] Oh my. Hallelujah. But when a crowd was
[38:55] hungry,
[38:57] he picked up five biscuits and two
[38:59] little fish and fed 5,000.
[39:02] Oh, hallelujah.
[39:04] You see what I mean? Don't try to
[39:06] impersonate.
[39:08] That's what's the matter with Pentecost
[39:09] today.
[39:11] What's the matter with the church today?
[39:12] There's too many trying to impersonate
[39:14] they got the Holy Ghost. There's too
[39:16] many trying to impersonate divine
[39:18] healing. There's too many trying to
[39:19] impersonate different things of the
[39:20] Lord. You can't do that.
[39:23] That things comes by election. God
[39:26] calling you're a dock from the mother's
[39:29] womb. Amen. Gifts and callings are
[39:31] without repentance.
[39:34] Oh
[39:35] my. That's true.
[39:39] You can't make yourself something you're
[39:40] not.
[39:42] But if God calls, you'd be the most
[39:44] thankful person in the world.
[39:48] Hallelujah.
[39:50] [Applause]
[39:55] Praise the Lord. Let's all stand. Amen.
[39:58] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[40:00] Just raise your hands, close your eyes,
[40:03] and just praise him this evening. Thank
[40:05] you, Lord. Thank you, Father. Thank you
[40:07] for your word, Lord Jesus. We bless your
[40:09] name, Lord. Hearing, recognizing, and
[40:12] acting upon your word, Lord. Father,
[40:14] Lord, may we not just be hearers only,
[40:16] but doers also, Lord. Thank you, Father.
[40:19] Thank you for your word. Inspire to our
[40:21] hearts,
[40:22] Lord. In Jesus name. Amen. Amen. We
[40:25] appreciate the message this evening.
[40:28] Give the Lord a hand of praise.
[40:31] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen.
[40:34] Let's just turn to our Bibles at this
[40:36] time as we want to switch over to the
[40:38] Lord's supper.
[40:41] Amen. First Corinthians
[40:43] 11
[40:54] 23-32.
[40:55] Amen. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[40:57] Father, we pray that you bless the
[40:59] reading of your word inspired to your
[41:01] people now in Jesus' name.
[41:05] Amen. Chapter 11
[41:09] 23. For I have received of the Lord that
[41:14] which also I delivered unto you, that
[41:17] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[41:19] he was betrayed, took
[41:22] bread, and when he had given thanks, he
[41:25] broke it and said, "Take,
[41:28] eat. This is my body which is broken for
[41:31] you. This do in remembrance of me."
[41:36] After the same manner also he took the
[41:38] cup when he had sucked, saying, "This
[41:41] cup is the new testament in my blood.
[41:44] This do ye as often as you drink it in
[41:47] remembrance of
[41:49] me. For as often as you eat this bread
[41:52] and drink this cup, ye do show the
[41:54] Lord's death till he comes.
[41:58] Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[42:02] and drink this cup of the Lord
[42:04] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[42:07] and blood of the
[42:08] Lord. But let a man examine himself and
[42:12] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[42:14] of that cup. For he that eateth and
[42:17] drinkkeeth
[42:18] unworthily eateth and drinkketh
[42:20] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[42:24] Lord's body. For this cause many are
[42:27] weak and sickly among you and many
[42:30] sleep. For if we would judge
[42:32] ourselves, we should not be judged. But
[42:36] when we are judged, we are chasened of
[42:38] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[42:42] with the world. Amen. Let's just bow our
[42:45] heads one more
[42:46] time. Amen. As we want to pray for the
[42:51] articles and the feet washing.
[42:55] Heavenly Father, Lord, we are so
[42:57] grateful here this evening, Lord, in
[42:59] your presence,
[43:00] Father. Lord, as we are in obedience to
[43:04] your word, Lord, where your people would
[43:08] gather, Father, to partake of the bread
[43:11] and wine, Lord, symbol of body and blood
[43:14] of Jesus. We pray you bless and sanctify
[43:17] the articles that have been prepared
[43:18] this evening. And Lord, as your people,
[43:21] Lord, would partake, Father, may your
[43:24] Holy Spirit so anoint our hearts.
[43:26] Father, inspire us, Lord, to be better
[43:28] Christians. Lord, inspire us, Lord, to
[43:31] love you more, Father, to love your
[43:34] people, Father. And when we hear your
[43:37] word and recognize your word, Lord, may
[43:39] it move into action, Father, even the
[43:42] action of our faith, Father. For Lord,
[43:44] faith without works is dead. So Lord,
[43:47] come and cause that action of our faith
[43:50] in the lives of the hearts of the
[43:51] people. Lord, bless your ministry here
[43:54] this evening. Bless us as we would
[43:55] partake now. Bless your people as they
[43:58] would wash one another's feet with love
[44:00] and humility and respect. Take full
[44:02] control. Father, we commit everything
[44:05] now into your hands in Jesus' name with
[44:09] thanksgiving. Amen and amen. Praise God.
[44:12] Keep your heads bowed as we want to
[44:14] observe a moment of silence where you
[44:16] would pray for the ministry and the
[44:18] ministry would pray for you at this
[44:20] time.
[44:41] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. God
[44:44] bless you. You may be seated at this
[44:45] time as we want the deacons and elders
[44:48] to come forward to begin serving. Amen.
[44:51] God richly bless you.
