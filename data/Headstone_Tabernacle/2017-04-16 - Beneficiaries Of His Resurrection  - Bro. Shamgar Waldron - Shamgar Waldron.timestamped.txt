[51:18] 24:36 I wish to read
[51:21] this story here of
[51:23] Easter and as they thus
[51:28] spake Jesus himself stood in the midst
[51:31] of them and said unto them peace be unto
[51:36] you but they were terrified and AF
[51:40] frighted and supposed that they had seen
[51:43] a
[51:44] spirit and he said unto them why are you
[51:49] troubled and why do thoughts arise in
[51:52] your
[51:53] heart behold my hands and my feet
[51:58] that it is I myself Hallelujah hle me
[52:02] and see for Spirit had not Flesh and
[52:07] Bones as they see me have
[52:10] amen and when he had thus spoken he
[52:14] showed them his hands and his
[52:17] feet and while they yet beli not for
[52:22] joy and wondered he said unto them have
[52:26] you here any
[52:28] meat and they gave him a piece of a
[52:32] broiled
[52:33] fish and of a honeycomb hallelu and he
[52:37] took it and did it before
[52:39] them and he said unto them these are the
[52:44] words which are spoken to you while I
[52:47] was yet with you that all things must be
[52:52] fulfilled which were written in the law
[52:55] of Moses and in the prophets and in the
[52:59] Psalms concerning me amen then open he
[53:04] their understanding that they might
[53:08] understand the
[53:10] scriptures and he said unto them thus it
[53:13] is
[53:14] written and thus it behold Christ to
[53:18] suffer and to rise from the dead the
[53:21] third
[53:22] day and that
[53:25] repentance and Commission of sins should
[53:28] be preached in his name among all

[1:24:44] amen amen friend now getting down to the
[1:24:48] more serious part of the scripture here
[1:24:51] amen there's always been a priest
[1:24:55] it's not not just now no no there's
[1:24:58] always been a
[1:25:00] Easter and the prophet called it a pre-
[1:25:03] Easter that started all the way from
[1:25:07] Genesis it started all the way in the
[1:25:09] Garden of Eden amen friend and that was
[1:25:13] when the first righteous man yes sir on
[1:25:16] the face of the Earth amen
[1:25:19] Abel amen how many knows Abel was
[1:25:23] righteous
[1:25:25] amen and God had revealed to Abel what
[1:25:28] sacrifice to
[1:25:29] [Applause]
[1:25:32] bring
[1:25:34] amen look the beginning of righteousness
[1:25:37] is God revealed
[1:25:40] [Applause]
[1:25:43] truth the beginning there is revealed
[1:25:46] the beginning of righteousness is God
[1:25:48] revealed truth is that right because
[1:25:52] these two brothers here was in the
[1:25:54] Garden of Eden amen and they came to
[1:25:57] offer sacrifice unto
[1:25:59] God and Cain now from that side and he
[1:26:03] brought the fruits of the land and God
[1:26:06] refused
[1:26:07] it but Abel by
[1:26:10] faith and faith is a revelation can we
[1:26:13] say
[1:26:14] Amen offer unto God a most sacrifice and
[1:26:18] King amen and Hebrews 11 says where he
[1:26:22] obtain Witness Abel obtain witness that
[1:26:26] he was
[1:26:28] [Applause]
[1:26:33] righteous amen because it was revealed
[1:26:36] to
[1:26:38] Abel what sacrifice to offer is that
[1:26:42] right
[1:26:43] friend so the beginning of righteousness
[1:26:46] brother Ram says is God reveal
[1:26:49] truth when God reveal it to you can we
[1:26:52] say Amen
[1:26:55] and Cain did not like that his brother
[1:26:59] Cain and they started in jealousy greed
[1:27:04] amen and the Bible says and Kain kill
[1:27:08] Abel amen Satan has always tried to
[1:27:13] destroy and kill the righteous
[1:27:16] seed amen always Hallelujah a man trying
[1:27:21] to do good and live right and clean
[1:27:22] before God and serve God and whatnot
[1:27:25] Satan will get after you
[1:27:27] friend
[1:27:29] amen all right so Cain kill Abel but
[1:27:32] that was not the end of it God raised up
[1:27:35] sin can we say praise the name of the
[1:27:38] Lord see Easter began all the way there
[1:27:41] coming down the prophet called it a
[1:27:44] preaster so when Abel was killed God
[1:27:48] raised up set the Bible said instead of
[1:27:52] Abel how many and say
[1:27:55] amen and then that come on down all with
[1:27:58] the righteous down Through the Ages then
[1:28:01] it the priest again with the prophets
[1:28:03] that's why you have an Old Testament
[1:28:05] full of prophets with the prophets after
[1:28:07] Prophet after Prophet after Prophet
[1:28:09] coming down all through the Bible amen
[1:28:12] friend and the prophets down through the
[1:28:14] Old Testament is what kept the voice of
[1:28:17] God
[1:28:18] alive in every age can we say
[1:28:22] Amen but when God send them they kill
[1:28:26] them and when you kill Jeremiah God
[1:28:29] raise up Isaiah can we say praise the
[1:28:32] name of the
[1:28:33] Lord so it's an Easter coming down all

[2:04:40] [Applause]

[2:04:44] this this is in the image of
[2:04:47] animal
[2:04:48] amen Abraham said take the Holy Spirit
[2:04:51] away from a
[2:04:53] man he will take a little baby out of a

[2:05:02] flesh man
[2:05:02] [Applause]
[2:05:05] is amen everybody following me so listen
[2:05:09] to this in Genesis the Bible says God
[2:05:13] make man in his own image he said let us

[2:05:18] 1:26 and when he make that man was not a
[2:05:21] flesh man that's right that's right it
[2:05:23] was a spirit man everybody agree say
[2:05:27] Amen but the scripture went on to say
[2:05:30] there was not a man to till the
[2:05:32] soil so how come you make a man in His
[2:05:35] image and no man to tell the soil that's
[2:05:38] right amen friend amen so what God did
[2:05:44] he formed
[2:05:45] man

[2:06:13] question they said brother Braham what
[2:06:15] is the difference between the man in
[2:06:19] Genesis 126 and the man in Genesis
[2:06:22] 2:7 what is the difference between these
[2:06:26] men amen here the prophet
[2:06:31] answer he said the second man in Genesis
[2:06:35] 2:7 is the first man in Genesis 1
[2:06:41] 126 manifests in five senses
[2:06:44] [Applause]

[2:15:58] better amen do you love him this
[2:16:03] morning do you hate brother
[2:16:10] [Laughter]
[2:16:13] [Music]
[2:16:15] won what brother say now this is the
[2:16:19] fall
[2:16:21] he said that's the reason that God does
[2:16:24] does nothing outside of man watch this
[2:16:27] he always works through a
[2:16:29] man because God he had to use a man yes
[2:16:35] sir a man is what he had to use to
[2:16:39] display his attributes of
[2:16:44] Savior died the first Adam in the
[2:16:46] beginning he had to use this man to
[2:16:49] display his attribute of savior he had
[2:16:53] to make him in his
[2:16:55] image and make him something like
[2:16:58] him and put him on free moral
[2:17:03] agency and let him act any way he wanted
[2:17:06] to now he could take so that he could
[2:17:10] take his choice yeah but he knew that
[2:17:15] man by giving him his choice would fall
[2:17:20] yeah that's right
[2:17:22] see this is this whole Plan of
[2:17:24] Redemption is not by guest he know by
[2:17:27] putting Adam in five
[2:17:29] senses and putting him on free moral
[2:17:31] agency and giving him a choice he would
[2:17:35] fall God knew he would
[2:17:38] fall yes sir and let me say
[2:17:42] this even though you're a Christian God
[2:17:45] when he choose you knew everything that
[2:17:47] you would do
[2:17:52] he knew everything that you would do he
[2:17:55] knew that by putting Adam in that state
[2:17:58] condition and given him his
[2:18:02] choice that he would fall so being that
[2:18:05] he had to do that God had to do that he
[2:18:09] turn back
[2:18:10] around and make man a partner to him and
[2:18:15] does nothing except he does it through
[2:18:18] man so the whole work of redemption come
[2:18:21] by man and the prophet shout hallelujah
[2:18:24] hallelujah death come by the first man
[2:18:28] life come by the second Adam can we say
[2:18:32] amen and God does nothing because he had
[2:18:35] to use a man for that then he used a man
[2:18:38] to redeem back again praise the name of
[2:18:41] the
[2:18:43] Lord oh that's beautiful to me that
[2:18:45] unfold the whole Plan of
[2:18:48] Redemption that God had to use a man in
[2:18:50] the beginning and because he had to use
[2:18:53] a man so them attributes can be brought
[2:18:55] out then he turn around and make man a
[2:18:58] partner with him in the Plan of
[2:19:01] [Applause]
[2:19:03] Redemption do I come to preach this
[2:19:05] morning with that
