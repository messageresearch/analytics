[7:52] We would like to read from tonight for
[7:55] scripture reading. Amen. As we pray and
[7:58] start the service tonight in the
[8:00] presence of the Lord.
[8:02] Psalm chapter 91 from verse one says,
[8:05] "He that dwelleth in the secret place of
[8:08] the most high shall abide under the
[8:11] shadow of the
[8:12] almighty. I will say of the Lord, he is
[8:16] my refuge and my fortress, my God, in
[8:21] him will I
[8:23] trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from
[8:26] the snare of the fowler and from the
[8:28] noise ofome pestilence. He shall cover
[8:31] thee with his feathers, and under his
[8:33] wings shalt thou trust. His truth shall
[8:37] be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt
[8:40] not be afraid for the terror by night,
[8:42] nor for the arrow that flyth by day, nor
[8:46] for the pestilence that walketh in
[8:48] darkness, nor for the destruction that
[8:50] wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall
[8:53] fall at thy side, and 10,000 at thy
[8:57] right hand, but it shall not come nigh
[9:00] thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou
[9:03] behold, and see the reward of the
[9:05] wicked, because thou has made the Lord,
[9:08] which is my refuge, even the most high,
[9:12] thy habitation. May God add blessing to
[9:16] the reading of his word. Let's bow our
[9:18] heads together. Almighty God, we thank
[9:22] you for your grace and your mercy, Lord.
[9:25] Lord, you promise to be our shield or
[9:28] our buckler, Lord. Father, our exceeding

[9:38] fails. Lord, you are the absolute
[9:40] tonight. We thank you for your word.
[9:42] Lord, we come into this place now to
[9:44] worship you and to praise you, to create
[9:47] uh to create an atmosphere, Lord, as it
[9:49] were, around the word of God, Lord, in
[9:52] anticipation for what you would speak to
[9:55] us tonight, Lord. We wait on you
[9:58] tonight, Father. We pray that your
[10:00] presence would come as we sing praises
[10:02] unto your name. May you lift us up,
[10:04] Lord, Lord, in strength, Lord, of
[10:07] spirit. the Lord may uh uh uh anoint
[10:10] your speaker tonight, Father, as he
[10:12] prepares himself to be used of you
[10:14] mightily. We pray that you use his
[10:16] words, Father, to be an in inspiration,
[10:18] Lord, to be a light, Lord, Father, to
[10:20] our path that we may see something
[10:22] tonight, Lord, that would help us to
[10:24] grab hold of your promised word. Grant
[10:27] it all tonight. We commit this service
[10:29] into your hands. We pray that you'd have
[10:31] your perfect way in this place, Lord. We
[10:33] commit it in Jesus Christ's precious
[10:36] name. Amen. And amen. Oh, why don't you

[32:05] Amen.
[32:08] While you're standing, I'd like to
[32:10] invite you to the scripture so we could
[32:12] read a couple verses
[32:19] there. I know we'll have a time. Reading
[32:22] from the book of
[32:23] Ephesians, reading from verse 10-1 17.
[32:35] Ephesians 6 verse
[32:43] 10-17. And it says, "Finally, my
[32:46] brethren, be strong in the Lord and in
[32:49] the power of his might. Put on the whole
[32:52] armor of God that ye may be able to
[32:55] stand against the ws of the devil. For
[32:57] we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[33:00] but against principalities, against
[33:01] powers, against the rulers of the
[33:03] darkness of this world, against
[33:05] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[33:08] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[33:10] of God, that ye may ye may be able to
[33:12] withstand in the evil day, and having
[33:14] done all to stand, stand therefore,
[33:17] having your loins g about with truth,
[33:20] and having on the breastplate of
[33:21] righteousness, and your feet shut with
[33:23] the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[33:25] Above all, taking the shield of faith,
[33:29] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[33:32] the fiery darts of the wicked, and take
[33:35] the helmet of salvation, and the sword
[33:37] of the spirit, which is the word of God.
[33:40] May we bow our heads as we have a word
[33:43] of
[33:44] prayer. Oh heavenly father, Lord, what a
[33:47] privilege it is to gather together
[33:49] tonight, Lord. Lord, to fellowship
[33:51] around your word, Lord. Lord, anybody
[33:53] could read the scriptures, Lord, but but
[33:55] it takes you and your your your presence
[33:57] and your power and your Holy Ghost to
[33:59] breathe life into it, Lord. Lord, I pray
[34:01] that you quicken onto our hearts
[34:02] tonight, Lord. That that you would weave
[34:04] together the the few broken up words
[34:06] that I have put together here, Lord.
[34:08] Lord, I pray that you speak to your
[34:10] people lip to ear tonight, those that
[34:12] are connected on the internet or may see
[34:13] it even afterwards. Lord, I pray that
[34:15] you would minister unto them, Lord. Lord
[34:17] that you'd open their understanding,
[34:18] open their minds, their hearts, Lord,
[34:20] and pour out such a blessing upon them
[34:22] as never was seen before, Lord. Lord, I
[34:25] pray that every need be met, Lord.
[34:26] Anybody that's sick in our midst, may
[34:28] they be healed, Lord. Lord, those that
[34:30] might be weary, I pray that you would
[34:31] lift them up, raise them up, Lord. Lord,
[34:33] so we can worship and praise you and
[34:36] receive from you all that you have set
[34:38] out for us and predestinated for us
[34:40] tonight, Lord. Lord, I pray that you
[34:41] would take me out to the way, Lord, and
[34:43] you you would use me as a vessel, Lord,
[34:45] just to deliver a message to your
[34:46] people, Lord. Lord, I pray that you have
[34:49] your perfect will in in in everything
[34:52] that will be said, everything that will
[34:54] be done tonight, Lord, with me be
[34:55] careful to give you all the praise, all
[34:57] the honor, and all the glory in Jesus
[35:00] name we pray. Amen. Amen. You may have
[35:02] your seats.
[35:04] Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Blessed be the
[35:07] name of the Lord.
[35:09] Amen.
[35:11] for our title tonight called to stand
[35:14] and withstand and I had to research it
[35:17] there's a fundamental difference between
[35:19] standing and withstanding
[35:21] to stand is to hold your post hold your
[35:23] position to stay firm to stay fixed
[35:27] wherever you are to withstand is to
[35:30] provide resistance opposition to rub the
[35:34] enemy so you're not just waiting for
[35:36] them to come but you're going after them
[35:38] to drive them out. Amen. So, we want to
[35:42] examine in this scripture that was read
[35:44] the few verses there because I believe
[35:47] there's a lot for us to uncover for an
[35:51] inspiration. The whole armor of God, not
[35:54] part of it. We want the whole thing.
[35:56] It's the only way you could be fortified
[35:59] if you're fully covered from head to
[36:00] toe. Everything must be accounted for.
[36:04] Amen. Not part the whole armor. Amen.
[36:09] I have news for you tonight. In case you
[36:11] don't know, I want to make you aware
[36:13] that there's a recruitment drive taking
[36:15] place. God is looking for soldiers. Not
[36:18] just any kind of soldiers. He looking
[36:21] for volunteers who could be trained who
[36:25] listen, he want you to to to go through
[36:27] trials and testing and shaping and
[36:31] molding. He want to bring you into his
[36:33] image so he could use you because he
[36:37] want to have an elite group to work
[36:38] with. It's not for everybody. It's not
[36:41] for people who might be tired and weary
[36:44] and you have doubt and you're not sure
[36:45] if you could make it. If that's your
[36:47] mindset tonight, it's not for you. And
[36:49] that's okay. He said the church have
[36:51] three types of believers. But he's out
[36:54] to to to get members of his army. He's
[36:58] out to find you wherever you are. On the
[37:00] highways, in the byways, in the front,
[37:02] in the back. It doesn't matter your
[37:04] condition tonight. He's coming after
[37:06] you. He's sending his blood hung to get
[37:09] you. And guess what? He want trained men
[37:13] who could stand and withstand the enemy,
[37:16] not just stand up. You're not just a
[37:18] security guard and this is your poster
[37:20] duty and you stay here for 12 or 24
[37:22] hours. No, no, no, no, no. You have to
[37:25] move strategically.
[37:26] You have to gather intel and know the
[37:29] weak points so you can know when to
[37:31] attack and how to attack. You need to be
[37:34] able to take instructions like in Joshua
[37:37] time when he said listen in 3 days we
[37:39] going over no logic. It don't have place
[37:42] for reasoning. It don't have place for
[37:45] affection. It have no place for let me
[37:48] consult with my partner and see what he
[37:50] might think about it. It's just God says
[37:52] so and we moving. If he promised it, we
[37:55] moving. We moving with the cloud.
[37:57] Wherever the pillar of fire goes, we
[37:59] going to Hallelujah.
[38:02] You must be determined. You must be
[38:04] focused. You must be strong. But guess
[38:07] what? There's a little catch.
[38:10] The catch is the battle is not even
[38:12] yours.
[38:14] The battle is the is the Lord's. He will
[38:17] fight for you. It wouldn't be you. It'll
[38:20] be Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[38:24] But he still need you. Why? Listen. In
[38:28] perfect strength by perfect weakness.
[38:30] Brother Brandham said in paragraph 340,
[38:32] he said, "Listen, God's strategy is to
[38:34] take empty human vessels and shake the
[38:38] world with them." That's why he need us.
[38:40] That is why he need us to surrender and
[38:42] yield ourselves to him because he need
[38:44] empty vessels. Not full of your own
[38:47] thoughts and ideas. Not full of
[38:49] yourself. Not full with pride and
[38:51] jealousy and envy. No, empty it out. He
[38:54] want you to pour it out and surrender to
[38:56] him because he want empty vessels that
[38:58] he could direct, that he could use. He
[39:01] have no hands but your hands. He have no
[39:03] feet but your feet and he is determined
[39:06] to get the victory. So you have to now
[39:09] be able to follow his instructions,
[39:12] follow his lead, follow what the Holy
[39:15] Spirit said is applicable to you.
[39:18] He said, "Listen, like at Pentecost,
[39:21] what did did did he do? It taken them 10
[39:25] days to get emptied up. Emptied up. Not
[39:29] just a parade to be empty. But they were
[39:34] all standing there with their vessels
[39:35] turned up and God took himself and
[39:38] filled them up. That's all. They shook
[39:41] the world, poured himself into them.
[39:44] That's the need of today. That's what we
[39:46] need tonight.
[39:49] That's what we need is empty vessels.
[39:51] Yes, sir. So God can fill them up.
[39:56] You cannot take them. I got to to to to
[39:59] bypass a lot here. God cannot use them
[40:02] as long as they're already filled up.
[40:04] You can't come with your own thing and
[40:06] expect he to come and pour himself in a
[40:08] full vessel. No, it wouldn't work. He
[40:11] say he got to have empty vessels so he
[40:13] could fill them. Elijah in his time, and
[40:16] I'm sure you know the story, he said,
[40:18] "Go get some vessels. Borrow a lot of
[40:21] oil and we'll see. Get a good price
[40:24] because you want to accomplish
[40:25] something. You're going to do something.
[40:28] You want to get as much vessels as
[40:30] possible because you want to be able to
[40:34] be filled up." He said, "Listen, go by
[40:36] the neighbor if you have to." He said,
[40:39] "Get empty vessels." In essence, do
[40:42] whatever it takes.
[40:45] Do whatever it takes to find yourself in
[40:47] position to be blessed. Do whatever it
[40:50] takes to find yourself in the position
[40:52] for God to use you. You can't be
[40:55] confused and you're tied up and you're
[40:56] busy. He want to speak to you. He want
[40:58] to have a relationship with you. So do
[41:00] whatever it takes to make time to spend
[41:02] time with Jesus. Do whatever it takes.
[41:06] Shift things on your schedule. You might
[41:08] be a little too busy for him right now,
[41:10] but you need to do whatever it takes to
[41:12] make sure you're empty. Amen. Because he
[41:14] car you say if you're full he said
[41:16] that's all you need. That's what it was
[41:18] at Pentecost. They had empty vessels so
[41:21] God could fill them up. Brother, this
[41:24] day demands that. He didn't say it's an
[41:26] option or no. He didn't say we we might
[41:29] need some vessels. He said this day
[41:31] demands that. Amen. This day got to have
[41:35] that. We'll have that or perish.
[41:40] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. That's the word
[41:42] of the Lord. You know, perfect strength
[41:45] by perfect weakness.
[41:47] You know, when brother Brandham preached
[41:50] a message, the greatest battle ever
[41:52] fought, he said something at the
[41:53] beginning that I think is so profound,
[41:56] similar to when the Bible said,
[41:58] "Remember Lot's wife." There was a
[42:01] reason he said that so you could go back
[42:05] and check it and you could hold it close
[42:08] and you could renew it. So your memory
[42:11] wouldn't fail. You'll remember Lot's
[42:13] wife. In this case, here's what what he
[42:16] said in paragraph 3:25 of the greatest
[42:18] battle ever fought. He say, "Now, this
[42:21] is what I'm saying this morning. It's
[42:23] storing food." He used the reference of
[42:26] storing food. He say, "So you'll have
[42:28] something to eat so that you'll have
[42:31] something to feast on. Get it on your
[42:34] tapes." This was his instruction. Get it
[42:36] on your tapes. Set in a cool of the
[42:38] room. Maybe when I'm long ways away,
[42:41] you'll still remember these things are
[42:43] true. He didn't want you forget. He
[42:46] says, "Set in your room and listen."
[42:47] See, and this is food storing in in the
[42:51] storehouse. I don't know where the trip
[42:54] is, but wherever it is, he knows where
[42:58] he's leading. I just follow. Now, this
[43:01] was the prophet's attitude. You say,
[43:03] "Listen, the things I'm going to share,
[43:05] I want you to tape it, listen to it,
[43:10] meditate upon it, remember it because I
[43:12] wouldn't always be here. And this is the
[43:15] truth and this is right. This is the
[43:16] word of God. So I want to ensure that
[43:18] you keep this close to your heart."
[43:20] Amen. And then he went on and he read
[43:22] the scripture I read earlier there about
[43:24] the whole armor of God. So I just want
[43:27] to suppose that there's great
[43:28] significance to that. So there's not
[43:30] just English words that they put
[43:31] together for us to read and feel good,
[43:33] but it's a specific deliberate
[43:34] instruction he gave because he knew in
[43:37] this time in this evil age we will need
[43:40] certain types of equipment. We will need
[43:42] certain we will meet certain conditions
[43:45] and it will require a certain thing from
[43:47] us. So we can't be lacadasical and just
[43:51] relax because if there's a battle to
[43:54] take place, you have to prepare for it.
[43:58] When the children of Israel was leaving
[44:00] Egypt, they had to prepare. You know, it
[44:02] wasn't just, you know, you know, we in
[44:05] slavery for years. You know, my
[44:06] forefathers used to talk about this and
[44:08] I hear word word through the grape vine
[44:10] or on the street is that we leaving
[44:12] tomorrow. I'm not too sure. No, it
[44:14] wasn't that. You know, it was specific
[44:16] instructions. You had to eat a
[44:17] particular way. You had to dress a
[44:19] particular way. You had to have your
[44:21] shoes on. You had to have your staff.
[44:23] You had to to follow the instructions to
[44:25] a te to leave, you know.
[44:28] When you're preparing for war, you can't
[44:31] just sit down and you're relaxing on
[44:32] your lying and boy I hear it might have
[44:35] a battle sometime you know the enemy
[44:37] might attack but we not sure it don't
[44:39] work so the cub scout motor is always be
[44:42] prepared you know you can have a strike
[44:45] anytime you know you know now we have
[44:47] fancy technology drone strikes and thing
[44:49] so it come in program pre-programmed
[44:52] using AI from a distance you know you
[44:54] can't just sit down and you would be
[44:55] further
[44:57] You're the ashes. You finish before you
[45:00] start. But when you're prepared, listen,
[45:02] the enemy looking for you, you know,
[45:05] because they hear of your rep. They
[45:07] understand that you prayed up, that you
[45:09] fasting, that you meditating, that you
[45:12] following the prescription of the Holy
[45:15] Spirit. So you ready for anytime,
[45:18] anywhere, any place, under any
[45:19] condition, anything that happened to
[45:21] you, you prepared. Now that is the
[45:23] soldier in the army of the Lord. Not
[45:25] just any soldier. He not looking for a
[45:28] little guard here and a little person
[45:30] here. No, no, no. He looking for elite
[45:32] soldiers. He looking for trained folks.
[45:35] People who went under tutors and
[45:37] governors, line upon line, precept upon
[45:39] pre. He looking for people who could
[45:41] take the word and hand it there that
[45:44] could slice and cut that could declare
[45:47] the word of God is the same yesterday,
[45:50] today, and forever.
[45:55] But you see he said in Amos he said
[45:58] listen there will be a famine in the
[45:59] land in this time there will be a famine
[46:04] not for things not for churches you know
[46:06] not for groups not for songs you could
[46:09] find that a dime a dozen everywhere but
[46:11] this is what it says in Amos 8:11 he
[46:14] said behold
[46:16] the days come said the Lord God that I
[46:20] will send a famine in the and not a
[46:23] famine of bread, nor a thirst for water,
[46:27] but of hearing the word of God,
[46:30] that unadulterated true word of God that
[46:34] can't fail, that could go out and will
[46:37] never return void. But accomplish
[46:40] everything it set out to accomplish.
[46:43] That is what there'll be a famine for.
[46:45] But you hear what he said. He said,
[46:46] "Listen, you want to place this in your
[46:48] storehouse."
[46:50] He said, "You want to put this in a in a
[46:52] place that you could listen to it. Make
[46:54] sure it's on the tapes. Make sure it's
[46:56] on the internet. Make sure it's recorded
[46:58] so you could go back and listen. That
[47:00] you could go back and teach your
[47:01] children. That you could write it down.
[47:03] And you will never forget. That under no
[47:06] circumstance are you to be found naked,
[47:09] you must be found with the full armor
[47:12] from head to toe. Full armor all the
[47:15] time. This is not a Sunday soldier. We
[47:18] talking about not a Wednesday night
[47:20] soldier. Somebody who 24/7 every day
[47:24] fully prepared for anything.
[47:30] Hallelujah. Listen. Satan in a message
[47:34] just one more time. Lord. Hallelujah.
[47:36] Paragraph 15. He says Satan has no more
[47:38] power. I told news. We know that no more
[47:41] power only as he can bluff with. He's a
[47:44] big bluff. Yeah. If he could bluff you
[47:46] into it, he win. He get through. But he
[47:49] have no power. Legally, he has no power
[47:52] at all. Every power he had was taken
[47:55] away from him at Calvary.
[47:57] That's where the price was paid. He is
[47:59] nothing but a bluff. So he could say
[48:02] whatever he want. I will give you a
[48:04] local example. Now understand parliament
[48:06] was was dissolved last night.
[48:10] Right now we have no MPs.
[48:13] No MPs. You might have been an MP
[48:15] yesterday, your power gone. It
[48:18] eliminated until elections because you
[48:22] can't be a member of parliament if
[48:23] there's no parliament. Amen. So this
[48:26] devil, this Satan we talking about, he
[48:29] have no power at all. His power was
[48:31] taken from him at Calvary.
[48:35] It listen it disappeared. He cannot get
[48:37] it back legally. He has no rights to
[48:40] you. You have been purchased. You have
[48:43] been paid for. You have been spoken for.
[48:46] Listen here. Here what he says.
[48:48] Hallelujah. He said you are free
[48:50] tonight. He has made you free. And now
[48:53] if something in the word can make you
[48:55] realize that you are free by his grace
[48:58] or if something realize and the word
[49:00] makes you understand or some act of God
[49:03] that it included you, it included us all
[49:06] then you just accept it on those basis
[49:09] and you're free also. You don't have to
[49:11] feel different. You know, he said you
[49:14] don't have to feel anything at all. It's
[49:16] not based upon He said Jesus never said,
[49:18] "Did you feel it?" We do that when
[49:21] whenever we have earthquakes, but it's
[49:23] not an earthquake we're talking about.
[49:25] Listen, this freedom, who the son of man
[49:28] set free, free indeed. You know, by his
[49:31] grace and know,
[49:33] you didn't have anything to do with it.
[49:35] You know, he said you don't have to feel
[49:37] anything. He said, "Did you believe it?"
[49:41] It's faith.
[49:43] It's our faith is an arm, a mighty arm
[49:46] that holds a sharp two-edged sword. And
[49:49] that sharp two-edged sword will cut
[49:51] every promise free. If that arm of faith
[49:55] is able to yield that sword, some people
[49:58] have very weak muscle, trouble with
[50:00] their muscles. They can't move too much.
[50:02] They can maybe cut off a a little
[50:04] scratch enough to join a church. Amen.
[50:08] Others can come into justification.
[50:11] Some can go all the way to the baptism
[50:13] of the Holy Ghost. A great strong arm
[50:16] holding this Bible can cut every promise
[50:19] free. That's right. So, be strong in the
[50:22] Lord. If you remember that scripture and
[50:25] I want to go through it, I would say
[50:28] slowly but quickly because I know time
[50:30] is running away. In Ephesians 6, we read
[50:34] that scripture. It seems like six, seven
[50:36] verses, seven, eight verses. It says,
[50:38] "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the
[50:41] Lord." Listen, I could recall Joshua
[50:44] chapter 1 verse 9. He said, "Have I not
[50:46] commanded thee? Be strong and have a
[50:49] good courage. Be not afraid, neither be
[50:53] thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is
[50:56] with with thee, whethersoever thou
[50:59] goest." So, here's what was going on.
[51:02] God said, "Listen, be strong. I don't
[51:05] want you to worry. I don't want you to
[51:06] complain. I don't want you to be afraid.
[51:08] I don't want you to be frightful. I want
[51:09] you to be strong." Why? Because I am
[51:12] with you. Wherever you go, I am going to
[51:15] be there. David in Psalms 18, hear what
[51:18] he said. He said, "I will love thee, oh
[51:20] Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock
[51:23] and my fortress and my deliverer. My
[51:26] God, my strength." Who was his strength?
[51:28] God was his strength. Not the soldiers,
[51:31] not the bodyguards. This is David we
[51:33] talking about. In whom I will trust, my
[51:37] buckler and the horn of my salvation and
[51:39] my high tower, I will call upon the Lord
[51:42] who is worthy to be praised. So shall I
[51:44] be saved from my enemies. So he say
[51:47] listen this same Lord that is my tower,
[51:50] my strength, my buckler, my shield.
[51:52] Listen, he will save me from my enemies.
[51:55] In essence, it's not him doing it. It's
[51:58] not how skillfully he could fight, you
[51:59] know. It's how big his faith is. Because
[52:02] his faith is what holding that sword.
[52:05] His faith holding that word. And that
[52:07] word will slice and cut. That word will
[52:10] conquer. That word will ensure that your
[52:12] unbelief could disappear. That word
[52:15] activates healing. That will listen
[52:18] activate your filling of the Holy
[52:20] Spirit. I say in the power of his might.
[52:23] In the power of his might. his might,
[52:26] not yours. Not how much you go to the
[52:28] gym and how much protein you take and
[52:30] how much push-ups you could do. In
[52:32] Zechariah 4, here what it says. He said,
[52:34] then he answered and spake unto me,
[52:35] saying, this is the word of the Lord
[52:37] unto Zerubbabel, saying, not by might,
[52:41] not not by my might, not by yours, he
[52:43] said, listen, nor by power, but by my
[52:46] spirit, said the Lord of hosts.
[52:50] In Ephesians 6:11, he says, "Put on the
[52:53] whole armor of God." Not part. He say,
[52:56] "Put put on the shield and it going to
[52:57] look fine." Could model in that. Take a
[53:00] picture for GQ. No. He say the whole
[53:02] armor. That ye may be able to stand
[53:06] against the ws of the devil. Why would
[53:08] he say that? Not just stand because he
[53:10] know the devil come in. The devil not
[53:12] impressed by you. You know he not
[53:14] watching you and in admiration and say
[53:17] you see that son of God they're doing
[53:19] real good you know I like the progress
[53:21] he making year after year his faith
[53:24] growing he getting stronger I admire
[53:26] that that's not what's going on you know
[53:28] listen I remember recently having a
[53:31] discussion with somebody and we say
[53:32] listen you are no match for the devil
[53:35] you are no match for the devil I'm not
[53:38] concerned how much church you're
[53:39] attending if you come Sunday and
[53:41] Wednesday you as a human, as an
[53:44] individual is no match for this devil.
[53:46] You know why? Listen, that is his
[53:48] specialization. To terrorize you, to
[53:51] attack you, to fight you, to find your
[53:54] weaknesses and cut you down. He looking
[53:57] every day, day and night, tossing to and
[53:59] fro. He not resting, he not sleeping
[54:01] because his goal is kill, steal,
[54:03] destroy. Once he can, he will. Yeah. So
[54:07] don't think for a second it easy going
[54:11] nothing to worry about the devil don't
[54:14] touch me that's your testimony no no no
[54:17] no no no no listen every day he after
[54:20] you know he after you he after your
[54:22] marriage he after your finances he after
[54:24] your children anything he could get his
[54:26] hand on you remember Job you say listen
[54:29] touch anything except his life you see
[54:30] things things he touch he didn't just
[54:32] touch Job you know he touch his children
[54:34] too you know he he touch his family, his
[54:37] flocks too, you know. He touch his
[54:38] finances too. He touch his wealth. You
[54:41] know, he touch his relationship with his
[54:43] wife, with his friends, with everybody.
[54:45] You know, everything that could be
[54:46] touched, got touched, you know, except
[54:48] his life, you know. But you say, listen,
[54:50] though the skin wounds destroy my body.
[54:53] Yet in my flesh, I will see him because
[54:57] he had an assurance. Listen, he had such
[55:00] a relationship that nothing, listen,
[55:02] nothing present, past, no pestilence, no
[55:06] war, no rumor, listen, could stop him
[55:08] from the love of God, you know, could
[55:10] separate him, you know, he was so
[55:13] convinced like like like the the Hebrew
[55:15] boys, listen, if he don't deliver, we
[55:17] still not bowing down because they were
[55:20] so convinced. Hallelujah. So listen,
[55:25] the Bible say the ws of the devil. But
[55:27] listen, in perseverance, it said but sin
[55:29] is here everywhere. Whiskey joints,
[55:32] immorality, just everything that's
[55:34] wrong. All kind of devices and traps of
[55:37] the enemy. You know what? To trap human
[55:40] souls. That's right. Not to trap your
[55:42] feelings, you know, not to trap your
[55:44] mind, you know, to trap your soul.
[55:48] In verse 12 that we read, it say,
[55:50] "Listen, for we wrestle not against
[55:52] flesh and blood." Come on now. In 1st
[55:55] Samuel 17, here's what it says in verse
[55:59] 41. It says, "And the Philistine,"
[56:02] talking about David again. Now, we know
[56:04] the story. David Sle golat is a
[56:07] summarized version. If you ask Chhat
[56:08] Chhat Chad GPT, that's what it'll say.
[56:11] David Sle golat.
[56:13] But what you may have missed is the fact
[56:16] that the Bible say we wrestle not
[56:19] against flesh and blood. So David and
[56:21] Goliath wasn't a flesh and blood affair.
[56:25] It wasn't a flesh and blood issue cuz
[56:26] the maths don't add up. If you take the
[56:29] little boy David and the giant Goliath,
[56:31] the maths don't add up. But let me show
[56:33] you something in scripture. 1st Samuel
[56:35] 17. Here's what it says. And the
[56:37] Philistine came on and drew near unto
[56:39] David. And the man that bear the shield
[56:42] went before him. This is speaking of
[56:43] Golth. So there was a man with a shield
[56:46] going before Goliath.
[56:49] Yeah. So in the fama, God did say, "Have
[56:51] a shield there." But there was a shield
[56:53] in front Golth.
[56:56] Went before him. And when the Philistine
[56:58] looked about and saw David, he disdained
[57:00] him, for he was but a youth, and ruddy
[57:03] and a fair countenance. And the
[57:05] Philistine said unto David, "Am I a dog
[57:08] that thou comest to me with staves?" And
[57:11] Philistine, the Philistine cursed David
[57:13] by his gods. And the Philistine said to
[57:16] David, "Come with me, and I will give
[57:19] thy flesh to the fowls of the air, and
[57:22] to the beasts of the field." Then said
[57:24] David unto the Philistine, listen, "Thou
[57:27] comest to me with a sword, and with a
[57:29] spear, and with a shield, so he identify
[57:32] the devices of the enemy of that day."
[57:34] Amen. He say a sword, a spear, and a
[57:38] shield. But here what he came with. But
[57:40] I come to thee in the name of the Lord
[57:43] of hosts, the God of the army of Israel,
[57:46] whom thou hast defied. This day, listen,
[57:50] this day will the Lord deliver thee into
[57:53] mine hands, and I will smite thee, and
[57:56] take thine hand from thee, and I will
[57:59] give the carcasses of the host of the
[58:01] Philistines this day unto the fowls of
[58:03] the air, and the wild beasts of the
[58:05] earth. Listen. That all the earth may
[58:08] know that there's a God in Israel.
[58:12] And all this assembly shall know, here,
[58:14] here what you want the assembly to know.
[58:17] that the Lord God saveth not with a
[58:20] sword and a spear. For the battle is the
[58:23] Lord's and he will give you into our
[58:27] hands. So he is not going to protect you
[58:30] because he give you a gun and a spear
[58:32] and a sword. No, no, no, no, no. The
[58:34] battle is the Lord's and he will give
[58:37] the enemy into your hands. Amen.
[58:44] He said, "But against principalities,
[58:46] against powers, against the rulers of
[58:48] darkness of this world, the rulers of
[58:50] darkness in the greatest battle ever
[58:52] fought," paragraph 3:27, he says, "Who
[58:55] rules the world?" The devil, certainly.
[58:59] Who is all these things going on? All
[59:01] these ungodly things going on around
[59:03] through here, these governments and so
[59:05] forth, it's all the devil. The Bible
[59:08] said so. The devil controls the US, the
[59:11] Germany, the you name it. The devil
[59:13] controls every nation in the world. I'm
[59:15] coming to it in a few minutes and we'll
[59:17] find out whether he does or not. Whether
[59:19] every kingdom ever was and ever will be
[59:22] until God set up his kingdom is
[59:24] controlled by the devil. I don't mean
[59:27] everybody in it is the devil. Now,
[59:29] there's godly men in government offices.
[59:32] That's right. But who we battling
[59:34] against? Not the men, you know, up
[59:37] against spiritual wickedness in high
[59:39] places.
[59:41] In verse 13, he say, listen, wherefore
[59:43] take unto you the whole armor. He say
[59:46] says it again, take the whole armor. So
[59:48] don't forget that the whole armor that
[59:51] ye may be able to withstand. And like I
[59:52] said earlier, withstand means to resist
[59:56] or hold out against something
[59:58] successfully.
[1:00:00] Amen. So when you're withstanding,
[1:00:02] you're not just standing and taking
[1:00:03] licks. No. fighting back. You're
[1:00:05] fighting back. Yeah. You reign in your
[1:00:07] own blows. You're not You're not a
[1:00:10] bubbly, you know. Listen, you're trained
[1:00:12] for war. You're trained for battle.
[1:00:15] You're trained to attack. You're trained
[1:00:17] to go out fortified to defend yourself.
[1:00:21] But listen, you're trained to defend,
[1:00:22] defend, defend, and you going back,
[1:00:24] going back, getting pushed back. You
[1:00:25] know, no, you you're trained to attack
[1:00:27] as well. When when he tells Joshua,
[1:00:30] every place you put your foot, you think
[1:00:32] he he sit down and say, Hear what now?
[1:00:35] God promised me this. So I using a
[1:00:38] binoculars to look out and the further I
[1:00:41] look is the more that I'll accomplish.
[1:00:43] No, no, no. Listen. You had to do
[1:00:45] something. You know, you had to move.
[1:00:48] You had to go out. You had to resist and
[1:00:51] withstand. Now listen. Hallelujah.
[1:00:56] In a message, the true sign that's
[1:00:58] overlooked.
[1:01:02] Paragraph 241, it says, watch now.
[1:01:06] Malachi 4. Let let me read this. He's
[1:01:08] going to come again. Behold, the day
[1:01:10] cometh that shall burn as an orphan. And
[1:01:13] all the proud, yes, that's today. I walk
[1:01:16] down the street and see this people. You
[1:01:17] can talk to them and they laugh at you,
[1:01:19] make fun of you. I think, what is it?
[1:01:20] The other day I was walking down. Let me
[1:01:22] just skip down a little bit. He said,
[1:01:23] "Get yourself ready. G up your loins.
[1:01:26] I'm calling you. That's the reason I'm
[1:01:28] waiting for. Behold the day cometh that
[1:01:30] shall burn as an oven." And it goes on
[1:01:33] and he says, "Unto you that fear my name
[1:01:36] shall the son of righteousness rise with
[1:01:37] healing in his wings." He said, "Behold,
[1:01:40] I will send you Elijah the prophet
[1:01:41] before the coming of the great and
[1:01:43] dreadful day of the Lord." No, it
[1:01:45] couldn't have been John. It could not
[1:01:47] because the world would have been
[1:01:49] destroyed then. But here he said in
[1:01:52] Matthew 3 sends a messenger before him.
[1:01:55] And Jesus says that's the Elijah that
[1:01:58] was to come to prepare a way before me.
[1:02:01] But before this great atomic bomb hits,
[1:02:04] I'll send you Elijah the prophet and he
[1:02:07] shall turn the hearts of the fathers to
[1:02:08] the children and the hearts of the
[1:02:10] children to the fathers. Least I come
[1:02:12] and smite the earth with a curse. And we
[1:02:14] know the scripture prophecy in this day.
[1:02:17] But now you say, "Oh, that Elijah was to
[1:02:20] be John. The messenger of the covenant
[1:02:23] was John truly." That's exactly right.
[1:02:25] Jesus said so and verified it here.
[1:02:28] That's the one I spoke of. But you see,
[1:02:31] it couldn't be the Elijah that was to
[1:02:32] come. See, it couldn't be because, you
[1:02:35] see, if it would, then the prophecy
[1:02:37] would be wrong. The earth wasn't
[1:02:39] destroyed back then. See, but before
[1:02:41] that great and terrible day, the day we
[1:02:43] living in, the Lord shall come before
[1:02:47] the Lord comes, I'll send you Elijah,
[1:02:49] and he will restore, watch his first
[1:02:52] coming, the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:02:54] children. Amen. That's what he did
[1:02:57] first. Brought the message of the new
[1:02:59] dispensation, the coming of Christ, now
[1:03:02] pulling the old Orthodox fathers away
[1:03:05] from that Orthodox faith into a new
[1:03:07] faith that had just been born. Then when
[1:03:10] he comes the second time and the hearts
[1:03:12] of the children back to the Pentecostal
[1:03:14] father, the original message, it goes on
[1:03:18] now in events made clear by prophecy. It
[1:03:21] says, "And when you see the church
[1:03:24] getting
[1:03:25] worldly like it was in the days of
[1:03:27] Sodom, see the church world all going
[1:03:31] into worship the God of this evil age
[1:03:33] and seeing that then seeing a little
[1:03:35] minority group like this one tonight
[1:03:38] gathered out under the inspiration of
[1:03:40] God producing again the life of Jesus
[1:03:43] Christ by the scriptures that's supposed
[1:03:46] to happen." You know what hour we living
[1:03:48] in? Amen. The Bible fortell by prophecy
[1:03:51] what day that we live in and what time
[1:03:54] we living and what kind of events ought
[1:03:57] to be taking place. It foretells it
[1:03:59] exactly to the letter and has never
[1:04:01] missed one age all the time. Not one
[1:04:04] time it ever missed and it won't for who
[1:04:08] are predestinated to see it will see it.
[1:04:11] Jesus said, "No man can come to me
[1:04:14] except the father draws him. And all
[1:04:16] that the father has given me will come."
[1:04:19] It's the word joining with the word. It
[1:04:22] can't do anything else. We know it. We
[1:04:25] know the day we live in is evil. But the
[1:04:29] scripture said, "And having done all to
[1:04:31] stand."
[1:04:33] Stand generally means to be in an
[1:04:35] upright position or to hold your
[1:04:37] position. Amen. Hold a particular
[1:04:40] position.
[1:04:42] Stand therefore having your loins girth.
[1:04:47] Let's just take the loins. G about was a
[1:04:50] girdle. That's the belt that holds the
[1:04:52] rest together. So we can't leave any
[1:04:54] piece out. You know because if you leave
[1:04:56] the belt, how it holding together? If
[1:04:59] you leave the helmet and your head
[1:05:01] exposed. If you leave the shield, how do
[1:05:03] you defend? If you leave the sword, how
[1:05:06] do you attack? Amen. Right. He said,
[1:05:08] "Listen, in the day, brother, when
[1:05:11] there's all kind of isms and fanaticism,
[1:05:13] it's time to gird yourself with the
[1:05:15] truth." Hallelujah. Jesus said, "I am
[1:05:18] the truth." The truth. I tell you, when
[1:05:20] people say, "What about this? What about
[1:05:22] that?" It's good to see that old truth
[1:05:25] buckled around you. Knowing where you
[1:05:28] stand.
[1:05:30] He said, "Then stand there. Let them
[1:05:31] say, well, you have this, that, and the
[1:05:33] other." You you know where you're
[1:05:35] standing. Have the whole armor buckled
[1:05:38] on and with a girth around here. Buckle
[1:05:41] down good and tight. Pull down with the
[1:05:43] truth of God's word anchored in your
[1:05:46] heart. All devils in hell can't upset
[1:05:49] you because you know where you stand.
[1:05:52] You know truth.
[1:05:54] [Applause]
[1:05:56] You can meet Satan and say it's written.
[1:05:58] Hallelujah. Oh, I tell you brother, did
[1:06:01] you take up servant serpent? Somebody
[1:06:03] come to to taunt you. Yeah. You're
[1:06:05] saying no, but I believe Jesus Christ.
[1:06:09] They say, "Did you do this or that or
[1:06:11] the other?" You're saying, "No, sir, but
[1:06:13] I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:16] buckled about and armor on, girded with
[1:06:19] truth."
[1:06:21] In John in in John chapter 14, Jesus
[1:06:24] said unto him, he said, "I am the way,
[1:06:27] the truth, and the life. No man cometh
[1:06:30] unto the father but by me." And listen
[1:06:32] to this story. And I I know nothing I'm
[1:06:35] saying is new. You know, I know you're
[1:06:36] aware of all these things, but I hope
[1:06:38] that by sharing it again that we
[1:06:40] accentuate the positive and it become
[1:06:43] fresh and more real and more meaningful
[1:06:45] to you. Listen, in this message,
[1:06:50] perseverance, paragraph 238, it says, "A
[1:06:52] man here some time ago was telling me
[1:06:55] said he went, you know, a a little bitty
[1:06:57] devil about that big stood before me one
[1:07:00] time in a dream. He said the devil said
[1:07:05] boo. And every time he heard it, he'll
[1:07:08] jump back.
[1:07:10] He got bigger and I got littleer. So the
[1:07:12] man was getting smaller and smaller. He
[1:07:15] said the first thing you know, boo and I
[1:07:17] jump back and every time go boop bump at
[1:07:21] him. Said he get back, get back, get
[1:07:24] back. Said he got bigger than I was. So
[1:07:27] the the the the devil was getting bigger
[1:07:29] than him. See, I didn't find nothing,
[1:07:32] but I know I had to fight him. I picked
[1:07:35] up a Bible and he went boom. I went boo.
[1:07:42] All of a sudden, the devil start getting
[1:07:44] smaller. Because you now start to get
[1:07:46] into, listen, not just into action or
[1:07:48] know, but you come into attack mode.
[1:07:52] You're not just taking licks. I say
[1:07:54] you're not a bully. You're putting on
[1:07:56] the armor because you're called to stand
[1:07:58] and withstand. Amen. So the long and
[1:08:02] short is he continued saying
[1:08:04] boo until the devil disappeared.
[1:08:09] The devil became so small it was
[1:08:11] insignificant.
[1:08:13] He say that's what you have to do. Take
[1:08:15] the word of God. You don't have to say
[1:08:18] boo necessarily, you know, but say thus
[1:08:20] said the Lord. Be perseverant. Stand on
[1:08:23] the word because the word is truth. The
[1:08:26] word is life. We believe the word today.
[1:08:29] We believe it like Micaiah believe it.
[1:08:31] We believe it like the rest of them
[1:08:33] believers. No matter how many say it's
[1:08:35] wrong, we know it's true. Jesus Christ
[1:08:38] is still the same yesterday, today, and
[1:08:40] forever. He that believeth on me, the
[1:08:43] works that I do, you will do also. Could
[1:08:46] any man heal you? No, sir. It's already
[1:08:49] done. You've already been healed. Can
[1:08:51] any man save you? It's already been
[1:08:54] done. How many believe that he was
[1:08:56] wounded for our transgression? He was
[1:08:59] bruised for our iniquities. Is that
[1:09:01] right? And by his stripes we were
[1:09:03] healed.
[1:09:05] Past tense. We were healed. Hallelujah.
[1:09:08] That's not a tonight thing. Everything
[1:09:10] he can do for you is already done. He
[1:09:14] already set you free. You know, he
[1:09:16] already delivered you. You know,
[1:09:20] listen.
[1:09:23] The same scripture said, "And having on
[1:09:25] the breastplate of righteousness, that's
[1:09:27] another part of the armor."
[1:09:29] And God had a pro a provided way. He
[1:09:32] says, "Now we realize that sin is only
[1:09:35] one thing. That's unbelief.
[1:09:38] Sin is in the singular sins. You are a
[1:09:42] sinner because you are unbeliever.
[1:09:44] You are a Christian because you are a
[1:09:46] believer.
[1:09:47] It doesn't mean now one time, many times
[1:09:50] I've said that smoking, drinking,
[1:09:51] gambling, committing adultery, lying,
[1:09:53] and that isn't sin. That's the
[1:09:55] attributes of unbelief. That's what
[1:09:58] unbelief produces. That's the reason you
[1:10:01] do it because you're unbeliever. But
[1:10:04] when you become a believer, then all
[1:10:07] these things shed off and it's a new
[1:10:09] life of belief that produces
[1:10:12] righteousness. So when they say put on
[1:10:14] the breastplate of righteousness, they
[1:10:16] say peace, joy, love, longsuffering,
[1:10:18] goodness, patience, gentleness, that's
[1:10:21] the attributes because you are a
[1:10:23] believer. Now God, did you ever stop and
[1:10:26] think just for a little bit? Let's look
[1:10:29] at the scripture. I love it. It's God's
[1:10:32] pathway. God want righteousness. You
[1:10:34] know, he wants you to give up the
[1:10:37] attributes of sin. He want you to live
[1:10:39] right and act right and speak right and
[1:10:41] do right. That's what he desires. That
[1:10:43] is what he wants. That is his provided
[1:10:46] way. The scripture goes on to say in
[1:10:49] verse 15, "And your feet shred with the
[1:10:52] preparation of the gospel of peacemen."
[1:10:55] The gospel or
[1:10:57] you see God called every one of us to be
[1:11:01] a witness to be a preacher. Not
[1:11:05] everybody might be behind the pulpit,
[1:11:06] but he called you to be a preacher.
[1:11:08] Amen. He say your feet have to be shut
[1:11:10] with the preparation of the gospel of
[1:11:12] peace. In St. Mark
[1:11:15] 11:15-20, he said unto them, go ye into
[1:11:17] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:11:20] every creature. Speaking to every
[1:11:22] disciple. He didn't tell them go into
[1:11:23] all the world and start churches
[1:11:24] everywhere. He didn't say form little
[1:11:27] groups everywhere. He said go out and
[1:11:29] preach to every creature. He that
[1:11:32] believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:11:34] saved. But he that believeth not shall
[1:11:37] be damned. It was simple and clear in
[1:11:39] verse 17. And these signs shall follow
[1:11:42] them that believe in my name. They shall
[1:11:45] cast out devils. They shall speak with
[1:11:47] new tongues. They shall take up
[1:11:49] serpents, and if they drink any deadly
[1:11:51] thing, it shall not hurt them. They
[1:11:53] shall lay hands on the sick, and they
[1:11:55] shall recover. So then after the Lord
[1:11:57] had spoken unto them, he was received up
[1:11:59] into heaven and sat on the right hand of
[1:12:00] God and went forth and preached. Listen,
[1:12:03] they went forth and preached everywhere.
[1:12:07] The Lord working with them and
[1:12:11] confirming the words with signs
[1:12:13] following. So he give them a commission
[1:12:16] and followed through. He tell them what
[1:12:19] to do. Go everywhere, preach to every
[1:12:22] creature. Those who believe and are
[1:12:25] baptized will be saved. Those who don't
[1:12:28] will be damned. Go forth. Bye-bye.
[1:12:32] But he walking with them, you know. He
[1:12:34] going to make sure to listen to enforce
[1:12:37] his word. You know to enforce listen
[1:12:40] that he confirmed the word with signs
[1:12:44] following them.
[1:12:46] He didn't leave them alone. He said he
[1:12:48] will never leave you. You're not on your
[1:12:50] own. You might be fighting as an
[1:12:53] individual, but you're not alone. You
[1:12:54] know, he's always there, you know. No
[1:12:57] matter how you feel, he always there.
[1:13:00] You know, he always there backing you
[1:13:02] up. You know, telling you keep on
[1:13:04] fighting, keep on pressing. You could do
[1:13:08] it because he need human vessels to work
[1:13:10] with. He can't just exist by himself and
[1:13:13] do his own thing. He need you to come in
[1:13:16] position so you could do your part. But
[1:13:19] he will confirm his part.
[1:13:24] In verse 16 of that original scripture,
[1:13:26] he said, "Above all, taking the shield
[1:13:29] of faith." And when I read the term
[1:13:31] above all, it reminded me of somebody
[1:13:34] saying, "Most importantly, I don't want
[1:13:35] you forget." So I tell you a lot of
[1:13:38] stuff before, but above everything else.
[1:13:41] So if by chance it's shaky, I don't want
[1:13:44] you to forget this part. this real
[1:13:46] critical that I want you to be focused.
[1:13:49] I want you to be awake. I want you to
[1:13:51] ensure that you remember this part well.
[1:13:54] He said take in the shield of faith.
[1:13:58] Because you're not going into the battle
[1:14:00] without protection.
[1:14:04] You must have a defense mechanism in
[1:14:05] place. It come like listen, imagine
[1:14:08] you're in the TTPS or some some military
[1:14:10] group and you going gunslinging without
[1:14:14] a bulletproof vest. That's right. How
[1:14:16] you doing that? I understand you're a
[1:14:18] hero. I know you're very experienced,
[1:14:20] but sense will tell you here. What? Put
[1:14:23] on a bulletproof vest.
[1:14:25] Because in the event the enemy attack
[1:14:29] and you didn't anticipate it, you have a
[1:14:31] form of protection.
[1:14:33] Amen. Now, faith is based on
[1:14:35] forgiveness. Amen. And then we we said
[1:14:39] trying to get the church into place to
[1:14:40] where we could really see apostolic
[1:14:42] times moving among us.
[1:14:46] That's what we all hunger.
[1:14:49] It just laying right at the door. You
[1:14:50] know, the prophet speaking. He say it's
[1:14:52] right there. We see it, but we want to
[1:14:54] see more of it. We want it such to flow
[1:14:58] that it'll be a help to us, us flow to
[1:15:01] others. Let me read that once more. Now
[1:15:04] faith is based on forgiveness then. And
[1:15:06] then as we said this morning, trying to
[1:15:09] get the church into a place to where we
[1:15:11] could really see apostolic times moving
[1:15:13] among us. That's what we all hunger. And
[1:15:16] it's just laying right at the door.
[1:15:19] Imagine you could almost touch it.
[1:15:21] Hallelujah. You could almost reach it.
[1:15:23] But we want to see more. We want to just
[1:15:26] flow. That's why you have to have that.
[1:15:28] But guess what? In second Peter
[1:15:31] 1-5 sorry 2 Peter 1 5-10 it says beside
[1:15:35] this speaking of
[1:15:37] faith giving all diligence he say add to
[1:15:40] your faith so faith don't just exist by
[1:15:43] itself faith have friends
[1:15:46] yeah it say add to your faith virtue and
[1:15:49] to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[1:15:52] temperance and to temperance patience
[1:15:54] and to patience godliness and to
[1:15:56] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:15:58] brotherly kindness his charity. For if
[1:16:00] these things be in you and abound, they
[1:16:02] make you that ye shall neither be be
[1:16:04] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:16:06] of our Lord Jesus Christ. But he that
[1:16:09] lackth these things is blind and cannot
[1:16:11] see a far off and had forgotten that he
[1:16:14] was purged from his old sins. We don't
[1:16:17] want to forget tonight. Wherefore
[1:16:19] rather, brethren, give diligence to make
[1:16:22] your calling and election sure. Oh, all
[1:16:26] this fall under listen above all else
[1:16:28] you know have faith have faith make sure
[1:16:33] and have faith he say for if you do
[1:16:36] these things ye shall never fail so that
[1:16:39] is why it's important to have that
[1:16:41] shield but it goes on and say in the
[1:16:43] scripture wherewith ye shall be able to
[1:16:46] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[1:16:49] remember I tell the the devil working
[1:16:51] overtime the devil out to get you
[1:16:54] Right. In a message, it is I be not
[1:16:57] afraid. He said, I was preaching the
[1:16:59] other night on the name of the Lord is a
[1:17:01] tower where the righteous run into
[1:17:04] it and are safe. Amen. Aren't you glad
[1:17:08] to be in there tonight? A great safety
[1:17:10] zone where all the devil's darts are
[1:17:13] passed away by our shield of faith. To
[1:17:16] know that we are standing in that safety
[1:17:18] zone, anchored in Christ, safe as we can
[1:17:21] be in there. Not even death itself could
[1:17:24] harm us. We already dead.
[1:17:27] Our lives are hid in God through Christ
[1:17:29] sealed in there by the Holy Ghost. Isn't
[1:17:32] that wonderful?
[1:17:33] In verse 17 it says, "And take the
[1:17:36] helmet of salvation."
[1:17:39] Now the helmet as we know is a covering
[1:17:40] for the head.
[1:17:42] But I want to say a great tactic of the
[1:17:44] enemy is to attack up here. You see your
[1:17:48] reasoning? You see the mind is the
[1:17:50] battleground.
[1:17:52] Now
[1:17:54] notice in a message should take on the
[1:17:56] whole armor of God. Paragraph 40 it
[1:17:59] says, "Now notice Satan tried to get in
[1:18:02] there to spy out to see how he could get
[1:18:05] a hold of that human race and he took
[1:18:08] one of the most famous
[1:18:10] tactics that well it showed that he had
[1:18:13] to be super he had to have a
[1:18:15] supernatural power to think about it. So
[1:18:17] he couldn't just come up with this. You
[1:18:19] couldn't think about it. It took a
[1:18:21] supernatural power to come up with this.
[1:18:24] He said he used this the first time and
[1:18:27] was successful and he's done it ever
[1:18:29] since. You remember I said listen you
[1:18:32] now come you now start. You think you
[1:18:34] could outsmart him. You think you could
[1:18:36] figure him out. He doing this full time.
[1:18:38] You know he listen he trying his his
[1:18:42] artillery his darts right through. You
[1:18:44] know he refining. You know he improving
[1:18:47] all the time. He not doing the test your
[1:18:50] grandfather used to get you know he have
[1:18:52] 20 25 test waiting you know he working
[1:18:55] on 2026 you know it's brand new thing
[1:18:58] you know it's new listen it's real thing
[1:19:03] listen they say he used it the first
[1:19:05] time and was successful and he's done it
[1:19:06] ever since and still successful to a
[1:19:08] certain estate he used reasoning against
[1:19:11] faith Satan come to Eve and begin to
[1:19:14] reason against the word of God the great
[1:19:17] armor of God had fortified his people
[1:19:20] with they had the word in the cool of
[1:19:23] the evening he used to come and
[1:19:25] fellowship with Adam every every evening
[1:19:28] every day fellowship word word talking
[1:19:33] but you know what the devil came and he
[1:19:36] said come to Eve and begin to reason
[1:19:38] against the word
[1:19:40] he began to use reasoning now it's only
[1:19:42] reasonable that God will not destroy you
[1:19:46] surely you will not lie. That's what the
[1:19:48] devil said. But remember that's Satan's
[1:19:52] tactic to begin with. And he still uses
[1:19:54] the same thing and still successful with
[1:19:56] it. Reasoning. They try to reason. Why
[1:20:00] would we need the Holy Ghost today? Why
[1:20:02] would we need divine healing? Why would
[1:20:05] we need this? And how we need another
[1:20:08] Pentecost? We're all civilized. They
[1:20:10] were too. But you see if whatever is
[1:20:13] taken to begin with and whatever God
[1:20:16] give them to begin with that's what it
[1:20:18] ever remains and tactics of reasoning is
[1:20:21] what Satan used and that's what he ever
[1:20:24] uses reasoning. We know our enemy
[1:20:27] because any
[1:20:29] enemy, he say any enemy that reasons
[1:20:32] against any person, any church, any
[1:20:34] organization, any individual that reason
[1:20:37] against one punctuation of God's word is
[1:20:41] your enemy.
[1:20:43] So it takes the word to defeat the
[1:20:45] enemy.
[1:20:48] So it goes on, the sword of the word,
[1:20:50] the sword of the spirit is the word of
[1:20:52] God. Receiving, get ready. Hallelujah.
[1:20:56] As we wind
[1:20:57] down, the greatest battle ever fought,
[1:21:00] it says, "Satan's army brings diseases."
[1:21:04] That's what Satan is. He's a destroyer.
[1:21:07] Satan, the whole kingdom of Satan is
[1:21:09] sickness, death, sorrow, flusterations,
[1:21:12] and worry. All on Satan. God is life,
[1:21:15] faith, joy, peace over here. See now,
[1:21:19] that's the two great forces that's
[1:21:20] coming together right now. They're
[1:21:22] battling. They're battling right here in
[1:21:24] the building right now. They battle day
[1:21:26] by day with you. Every force. Satan
[1:21:30] following you along. That great big
[1:21:33] kingly priestly goliath trying to scare
[1:21:35] the liver out of you. That's what Satan
[1:21:37] doing, trying to frighten you, trying to
[1:21:40] get you down, trying to frustrate you.
[1:21:42] He's right. But God, you're fortified.
[1:21:46] Amen. With the gospel, with the word of
[1:21:48] truth around your loin. Glory, preacher.
[1:21:51] That's what it is. helmet of salvation,
[1:21:54] the shield of faith, and the sword,
[1:21:56] waving it in your hand. Satan, I'm
[1:21:59] coming to meet you. You're not waiting
[1:22:01] to know. We going after him tonight.
[1:22:04] You meet me in the name of science. You
[1:22:06] meet me in the name of culture. You meet
[1:22:08] me in the name of organization. You meet
[1:22:09] me in the name of this, that, or the
[1:22:11] other. But I meet you in the name of the
[1:22:13] Lord God of Israel. I'm coming after
[1:22:15] you. Give way. Even death itself can't
[1:22:19] stand there. Chop a hole right through
[1:22:21] it. That's right. Satan's army bring
[1:22:24] diseases. God's army is commissioned to
[1:22:27] cast them out. So bring it on. We will
[1:22:29] cast you out. Amen. There you are. Every
[1:22:33] time Satan throws any on unto you, God's
[1:22:36] army is to cast him out. Amen. Cast out.
[1:22:39] That's the very technique that God used.
[1:22:42] Satan used the army of destruction to
[1:22:45] disbelieve God's word and to set him up
[1:22:47] a better kingdom than Michael had. And
[1:22:50] God cast him out. God's method is cast
[1:22:54] out the devil. Cast down reasoning. Cast
[1:22:57] down superstition. Cast down worry. Cast
[1:23:00] down diseases. Cast down sin. Amen.
[1:23:03] You're above it. Resurrected in Christ
[1:23:06] Jesus sitting in heavenly places with
[1:23:08] every devil under your foot. If he
[1:23:10] starts to stick his head in there, what
[1:23:12] you know you are dead. Your life is hid.
[1:23:15] What is dead? You're dead to your
[1:23:17] senses. You're dead to your conscience.
[1:23:20] Your own human will would say, "Yes, I
[1:23:22] guess. Um, dead to your reasoning." So,
[1:23:24] you don't even have to think about it
[1:23:26] because you have help. It would be
[1:23:28] Christ in you, not you. Dead to all
[1:23:31] those things. And you are buried in the
[1:23:33] name of Jesus Christ and raised with
[1:23:35] him. And wherever wherever he is, you
[1:23:38] are there also. You can please play
[1:23:39] something softly.
[1:23:42] Brother, the arrow of God's deliverance
[1:23:45] shot from a bow. Final
[1:23:46] quote. It says, "Brother, if you're ever
[1:23:49] going to make a stand for God, make it
[1:23:51] now. This is the time. Now is the time
[1:23:55] when we need. We're in need of it. It's
[1:23:58] not an option. You need to stand and
[1:24:01] withstand tonight. You need to put on
[1:24:03] the full armor of God." He said, "Now is
[1:24:05] the time when the church has weighed in
[1:24:07] balance and found one thing. After all
[1:24:10] these great miracles and signs and
[1:24:12] wonders that God has sent men across the
[1:24:14] country doing, yet the church is in the
[1:24:17] poorest backsliden state I ever run up
[1:24:20] in years." That's right. I'm preaching
[1:24:22] to Pentecostals. Amen. When I first come
[1:24:24] among your groups 10 years ago, it
[1:24:26] looked like a church. But today, it
[1:24:28] looks like the world. It's the truth.
[1:24:31] Something happens somewhere. You got to
[1:24:33] wearing better clothes. Got to making a
[1:24:36] little more money. It just made a sap
[1:24:38] out of you. That's all. Now that's the
[1:24:40] truth. That's right. You're trying to
[1:24:43] act like the rest of the world. You just
[1:24:45] take today is a compromising time.
[1:24:47] That's true. You paint your steps red
[1:24:50] and watch and see. Your neighbor will
[1:24:52] paint their steps red. Sure. You wear a
[1:24:55] little wrong hat to church with a little
[1:24:57] feather up in it and watch. All women
[1:25:00] come to church with a little wrong hat
[1:25:02] and are fed up in it. That's right. Yes,
[1:25:04] sir. All of them want to look like one
[1:25:06] another. It's a matching time. You know
[1:25:09] that's true. It's a matching time. Amen.
[1:25:12] That must have went home. That's right.
[1:25:15] Listen, that is true. Now, I'm going to
[1:25:16] tell you, my brother, I don't care
[1:25:19] whether my shoes match my trousers or my
[1:25:22] trousers match my coat. I want my
[1:25:24] experience to match God's Bible. That's
[1:25:28] the matching time. If you want to match
[1:25:30] something, match your experience against
[1:25:33] Paul's. Amen. That's what we need today
[1:25:36] is a matching time with Paul's faith in
[1:25:38] the Bible. That's our example, right?
[1:25:41] Real matching time. Don't try to match
[1:25:44] your neighbor. Match some of the saints
[1:25:46] in the Bible. If you're a saint, act
[1:25:48] like a saint, walk like a saint, dress
[1:25:51] like a saint, talk like a saint, pray
[1:25:54] like a saint, believe like a saint,
[1:25:57] shout like a saint, be like a saint,
[1:25:59] live like a saint, die like a saint, and
[1:26:02] go to heaven like a saint. Amen.
[1:26:06] Brothers and
[1:26:08] sisters, my word to you tonight is to
[1:26:11] stand and withstand the devil. You need
[1:26:14] to put on the full armor of God. God
[1:26:16] richly bless you.
[1:26:18] [Music]
[1:26:24] Amen. Oh, hallelujah. Let's praise him
[1:26:27] tonight. Glory.
[1:26:31] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. With
[1:26:35] all I am, I will seek to honor. Oh,
[1:26:41] let's sing it.

[1:26:49] allegiance
[1:26:53] to the
[1:26:55] lamb. I bless. Oh, I
[1:26:59] [Music]
[1:27:03] bless the lamb. Oh, where all I
[1:27:09] strength. Oh, where all I am. Oh, what
[1:27:15] I'll
[1:27:16] see
[1:27:18] to
[1:27:20] this
[1:27:22] command. I
[1:27:24] pledge
[1:27:26] alance
[1:27:30] to the lamb. One more time. I pledge
[1:27:34] alance. I
[1:27:36] pledge
[1:27:38] alance
[1:27:40] to the lamb. Oh, with all my strength.
[1:27:47] Oh, with all I am. Oh, and I will
[1:27:53] sing to
[1:27:55] honor his
[1:27:58] command. I
[1:28:01] pledge
[1:28:03] alance
[1:28:07] to the lamb. We'll give the Lord a shout
[1:28:10] of praise tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:15] Oh, here I stand. I pledge allegiance.
[1:28:20] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:28:23] Oh, hallelujah. With all my heart with
[1:28:26] all my soul. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:28:29] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:28:31] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:28:35] Oh, glory. I pledge allegiance tonight.
[1:28:39] Oh, glory, glory, glory. Do you feel
[1:28:41] that way tonight? Oh, hallelujah. One
[1:28:44] more time. I pledge alance. I
[1:28:49] pledge
[1:28:51] alance
[1:28:53] to the land. Oh, with
[1:28:59] all with all I am. When I will
[1:29:05] sing to
[1:29:08] honor
[1:29:09] his
[1:29:11] command, I
[1:29:13] pledge
[1:29:16] alance
[1:29:20] to the
[1:29:24] lamb. Oh, let's give him praise tonight.
[1:29:28] Hallelujah.
[1:29:31] Oh,
[1:29:32] glory. Thank you, Jesus. Oh, what a
[1:29:35] message from the
[1:29:36] [Music]
