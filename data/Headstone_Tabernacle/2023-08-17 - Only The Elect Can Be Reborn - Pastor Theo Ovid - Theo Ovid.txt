may you speak your word admit materialize just like that then Jason we ask it God bless you and thanks for being here tonight you want to go straight into the scriptures we want to read from Romans chapter 4 reading from we see them to 16 Romans 9 7-9 galicians 3 2 verses the other 16 and 29. reading Romans 4 11 and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the feet which he had yet been uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the fathom circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of the feet of Father Abraham which he had been yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to a seed through the law but to the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be ears faith is made void and the promise made of non-effect because the law worked right and where no law is there is no transgression therefore here we go it is a fate that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not that only it was of the law but that also which is of the feet of Abraham who is the father of us all Romans 9 verse 7. neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise accounted for the seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son Galatians chapter 3 verse 16. now to Abram and a seed with the promise made he see it not unto seeds as of many but as of one unto thy seed which is Christ verse 29. and if he be Christ then I.E Abraham's seed and is according to the promise let's pray father we thank you for the scriptures Lord and it will take the Holy Spirit to interpret it come and interpret it to the hearts and lives of the children and the Holy Ghost alone is the revealer of the divine revelation of Jesus Christ and we invite you Lord to come down and bring Revelation upon Revelation upon the lives of your people in Jesus I ask it amen you may be seated praise God we thank God to be here tonight it's a blessing and a privilege to be here and I have a context scripture I like to read you ever find it it's from Genesis 1 and um we see Lebanon 12 it says and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the hoop healing seed and the fruit real and fruit of his kind Who season himself upon the Earth and it was so and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb healing seed after his kind and the treed and fruit whose seed what is himself after his kind and God saw it was good so tonight I have a title only the elect can be reborn that's the date of the night only the elect can be reborn all praise was a blessing to know that God put that elect upon you he called he called that lady elect lady two Spirits so closely shall receive the elect if it was possible so they say elect bunch of people on the Earth isn't that right all right so I just want to time something from Sunday he said no and this I want you to believe this is all he had now we read this the Bible is manifested again like in the early days of Christ you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was and when the rain falls on the seed the life produces itself when the Holy Spirit Falls this is not teachings he's talking about here he's talking about when the Holy Spirit Falls and there's a scripture it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out my spirit Oh Glory the God has a promise in the word your career is that you can't pull that out you can't mystify that that is just what God said it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out my spirit isn't that right then you talk about the upper room he said no when it fell on those seats Jesus said he chose them before the foundation of the world and they were predestinated seed now we just say you are a predestinancing just like Christ was now tonight is a faith building message it's a message that still up your fate so we ain't come to bring some heavy stuff on here that you can't get stirred up with this is the put your faith that you're going to receive what God promised you isn't that right so if you're feeling down for you alone the night is not for you this message is for you if you're feeling half crack half cranky the night is night for you oh blessed be the name of the Lord he said watch he chose them before the function of the world and they were predestinated seated and I would say like you are tonight is that right and then they haul themselves up in the upper room these seeds the word and the Word was laying there without life on it and all of a sudden the king of sun from Heaven that can happen tonight you know all of a sudden They'll Come From Heaven as the waters begin to gush down and it actually fill all the house where they were Satan and the seeds begin to grow it began to manifest itself the word of God being made manifest hope he is God Amen so we read this Sunday we'll continue here on now praise God notice when Israel looked at the door with the blood on the door the name the blood the life and entered under the blood they never went out again until they went out of Egypt he said grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you don't go out anymore until your day you redeemed grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until your Redemption you are sealed in dear you are beneath the blood you don't go out no more you are God's son and God's family sealed in by the Holy Ghost the Devil Couldn't get you if he had to for you are dead your old husband part is dead you have buried your life is hidden God through Christ see the name of the Holy Ghost o praise God here's what I want to get to know then a new creation not to a denomination but to the word you are a creation of the word yes why because are you ready the foundation stone was leading you be before the foundation of the world predestinated to be sons and daughter of God they should make a Baptist out tonight okay the Lord some Praises glory to God God is not now laying it he put that Foundation shown in you when before the foundation of the world predestinated to be Sons and Daughters of God and upon this comes Stone upon Stone in each age to vindicate that word that was coming up oh glory to God and Jesus did it in his age and the Capstone of it of it all in him LED every age in Jesus was Moses in Jesus was David and Jesus was the prophets let me say tonight in Jesus was you okay the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God do you believe that tonight he come as the fullness of the Kings the prophets the goddess body rested in him he come to redeem what a bride a masterpiece okay the Lord has shout in the house Glory let God ride with me tonight hallelujah hallelujah glory to God well this is a big one we're coming to here now in six thousand years God had planted all these wonderful seeds he spoke in that day Hallelujah the Bible talk about Darkness cover the deep and the spirit of God move upon the face of the water and then God said let there be light that's how God has materialized thing God had to speak at first you have to talk at first from thought to word expression because they'll let there be light until was light when he said let there be light that was a seed we do no longer take but afterwards the Spirit come and brewed upon that seed of let there be light and then it was light a manifestation of what God spoke or give a lord a shout amen hallelujah now watch this part now he commanded each one of those seeds that what they should be that they should transform themselves into the plant of which kind of life that the word of God has spoken it should be if it was an oak tree it was to bring forth Oak if it was a palm it was the Binford pan oh here it is because the great Creator had just sent forth his word and the word seed was dear before the real seed was formed that's the bomb tonight the world seed was dear before the real seed was formed so when God said let there be light there was a world seed Hallelujah and then that sea materialize and that's a real seed Oh Glory to God before there's a real seed there must be a word seed Oh Glory to God give the Lord a shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he made the world all the things that doesn't appear he made the world okay ask about something because the great Creator just sent forth his word and the word seed was dear before the real seed was ever formed and the word formed the seed do you get that the word seed was dear before the real seed was formed and the word formed the seed that's why he said my word shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish the purpose that I said and fought to accomplish so when God said there'll be a bride oh give the Lord I shout there's gonna be a Bryce Revival I don't care how much deadness in this message how much the preachers don't want it there is going to be a bad Revival that's just saying the Lord Oh Glory to God what we see should make a church that will make a Revival that the seven tunnels of Revelation is being made manifest that will surely come to pass oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah forget that part tonight the word seed was there before the real seed was ever formed and the word formed the seed everything under control to bring forth of its kind and when he put the seed in the Earth the sea can only comfort with the power of life within it to transform it from seed to plant or whatever it is his transforming power God put the seed in deer with the potentials of what he said it would be so when God put you he put potentials inside the you of what you could be what can the Lord and shout and before you become a real seed God had to make you a word seed or give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah do you see it tonight all the potentials all the potentials was inside the seed Oh Glory to God do you believe that as long as it stayed in the right category you miss it it would be just exactly what God said it would be it had to be that way because he had made it way he made a channel that anything that stays in a channel in the line of the world will have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would do it's Channel exactly right Hallelujah and each here we go each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species I desire to be that is what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in its potential now to make it exactly what I wanted to be and God has never changed he's just the same today as he was then God is determined to do something oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God glory to God so if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost what you have inside is a word seed you know what the secret is the word is in the bride you you have to believe that tonight if you don't have the Holy Ghost you have a word seed and the words he was there before the real seed and the spirit coming to make you a real seed or Glory will go but inside you tonight tell the devil is a liar inside you tonight you have a word seed I will tell you what your stinking rotten flesh think or feel or thought or do it has nothing to do with your flesh because that seal God put that in your soul [Applause] the spirit can't touch that that was laid in you before the foundation of the world come on give me an amen tonight give us a shout tonight and that word seen in you has the potential to become the stature of a perfect man yoga's potential to be adopted you have the potential to be a living Monument of the Living God oh glory to God Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the devil's a liar Oh Glory of God God make no mystic you may be seated before the foundation of the world he put your name on the blood section of the book in the back part of his mind in his thinking in his thoughts you were part of the God's Gene and the back part of his mind you were dear he was thinking about you and when he spoke the word he expressed you so you were the seed in the word and God but make you bypass your theophany and put a c in you the struggle the fight to get problems to get situations and Childs God put you on the earth to sweat it out but inside of you have a wet seed that the devil didn't put and he cannot take out or can the Lord I praise I hope this boost your faith tonight [Applause] Oh Glory to God Hallelujah glory to God let's continue God [Applause] through a seed of his word are you ready God to a seed of his word and there's only one thing that can Quicken the word that is the spirit it is the life given to the word and when the light in the wood meets the life of the spirit it produces whatever the seed is so this will have a license that's what kept you all these years you think you keep yourself you think you bring yourself all these years it was something more than you it was God keeping you okay the Lord I pray is offering get the Lord and Shout in the house God was keeping you you fell long you get back up you felt sick you get back up your struggle here the amen backside here but you come back because you're in something pushing something pulling you it's not in your conscious mind it's in your subconscious mind you are unconscious of it oh get the Lord some Praises oh and when the life in the word meets the life of the spirit it produces whatever the seed is oh my hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God life of the world meet the life of the spirit something has to transform Oh Glory to God's Not the word meet the life of the spirit Hallelujah he said Luther had mechanism Dynamics the Pentecost he said what about our day we have that yet we have Mechanics for 50 something years military word but we are promised mechanics and Dynamics all 16 cylinders could be firing okay the Lord has shout oh all 16 cylinders gonna be fire and praise God Amen do you believe that hallelujah hallelujah so what happened with the church the church had to manufacture something and he said that's what Christ found a woman engaged that fine young clean man and before they get together she's from pregnant by somebody else right what then her own seed which is be trust her own body whether it be true to her boyfriend engaged husband is full full a seed of another man what a disgrace that what Adam found that's what Christ found the coding with what's the matter with people today they can't wait for the real Holy Spirit to take the church in position so that the manufacturer adopted they are getting many factors some kind of manifestation money factor some kind of thing well you know the mysteries of the sons manifest when you're bringing forth Mysteries there's manifested Sons bringing Mysteries it's a manifestation could only bring them Revelations you know they can't wait data manufacture something initial evidence what kind of tummy right instead of waiting upon the Lord for the real manifestation of the resurrection of Christ making himself known among the people what did she do she went out and became pregnant with denomination and the message now get the number isn't they're not calling himself the nomination but is that the emotional spirit doing the same thing Innovation doing you have to come by we either come here they'll be like we and all kind of foolishness that is the kingdom of God false prophets false teachers false glasses in the message amen with sword of the Lord hallelujah okay the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so we are ready yet I'm a scripture for that you know wait tell them seven Thunders utter the voices to that group [Music] they could do whatever they want to do oh my Hallelujah glory to God glory to God okay there we go what is transformation how do we get it asks the question are you gonna answer it what is transformation how do we get it what does the transformation all these are three questions God does it by the spirit of his word I just love that you see the letter kill it but the spirit give that life so there's a spirit of the word like we say truth is not truth until you get the spirit of Truth do you get that you have a knowledge of the truth but when you get the spirit of Truth that's it that's the truth oh Hallelujah you can talk brotherly kindness and whatever but unless they get the spirit of the kindness you only talk and talk you're talking to talk you're not walking you talk you gotta get the spirit of it so God by the spirit of the word he transformed he plants a seed and throws a spirit on it and it brings forth the product who plants it God does it who is A sower China man what's the seed the word Oh Glory the course when God reveals son of man in a cinnamon William Branham he came to bring seeds that's what people don't understand but Abraham came to bring seeds and he dropped the season books and things and walk away God took him home Hallelujah expecting some Gentile Warriors that will come behind him and say what the tape say to get the seeds into the People by these promises oh come on reach back to me somebody we were not supposed to preach our own message our own ideas our own interpretation we just supposed to say by Revelation and inspiration what the tape say that's what we're doing tonight because the secret is the word is in the pride or the seed is in the pride somehow it gets inside of you because we pump in their promises and as they catch it and they receive it is inside of you and you have that seed inside of you tonight a pyramid in mechanic form Oh Glory to God do you ever said you have a pyramid in a mechanic form or a Bible inside of you oh praise God he plants a seed he chose a spirit on it it brings forth the product his holy spirit transformed the seed word to be Vindicated of his kind what kind of seed are you that shows what's in you you can't hide it whatever you are on the inside shoes on the outside you can't keep from it you can't make that tree anything else but what it is the holy spirit transformed the seeds that's on the inside of it no matter what kind of seed it is it will transform it if it is evil it'll bring forth evil it was hypocrite it will bring forth hypocrite if it's a genuine word of God it'll bring forth genuine sons and daughter of God hallelujah when the Sea comes up it will produce sons and daughters of God all glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God praise God we believe that hallelujah hallelujah so do you believe here don't have the Holy Ghost ever waited inside of you do you believe that and it's impossible for you to miss this Holy Ghost because God must put a word see first before the real seed must come away see so you better thank God for that word see you can make yourself anything you can transform yourself into anything but that seed and you have trans woman power it's not right praise God praise God praise God hallelujah praise God the word seed was there before the real seed was ever formed and every promises seats every promise God gave out is a seed amen Peter said by these promises we become partakers of his divine nature oh my God are you ready to continue tonight all right let's go but there we say let's go let's go please explain The Mystery of the translation of the Bride question does that change our bodies let's say you know what I mean when I say that I don't mean this sacrilegious I don't mean to say hours I don't mean to say this church I mean I say every believer Abraham he was looking for a promised son that was promised him is that right and the church is looking for a promised son the bride is that right the bride's looking for the promised son before the promising could come to Sarah and Abraham their bodies had to be changed she was too old to have a baby she had no veins in her breast her breast was dried up her womb was wasn't flip tired she was still right she couldn't have a baby her heart was too old to stand a labor so what happened God changed her back to a young woman and he did Abraham the same thing because he said his body was good as dead he had to change their body in order to see the promised son and we cannot receive the promised son that is promised us today in these bodies that we live in these bodies are sin first conscience controls his body with CT smell feeling here it's just got us all scrupled up we reasoned on everything else but that new body this is question this first conscience controlled his body with sea taste well feeling here it's just got a scrupula we're reasoning everything else but that new body that comes from this born again it is that inside something that lives everybody understands saying amen remember I keep telling you the raptures inside out listen to this it is not this outside see tasteful smell here it isn't it is subject to death will die but the inside part of you dung in here inside that is the person that cannot die and that's the person that the New Life Starts from and from this new birth it builds another person in the image of this person you are around that life so there's Holy Ghost be talking about this new birth we're talking about is big foundation because that the lifebuils are wrong inside of you that is what's going up oh that's why that body got to be changed let me say it again I think this word saying again this is me so excited tonight it's not this outside City smells even here it is obviously the death and will die but the inside part of you don't in here inside that is the person that cannot die and that person that the new bird that the New Life Starts from from this new birth so this New Life Starts from this new bird this new life let's start from but you know are the word and when I see the word and when I see the message I have it I Baptist Doctrine the new birth is the word turn on in you the new birth is the word turning to Spirit and Power in you the new birth is the word activated by the spirit in you and he said and that's the person that the New Life Starts from from this new boot and it builds another person in the image of this person you are around that like they get it so potentially it's in here and what is it the word promise before the foundation of the world and a wrong dear only reflects the negative that will reflect the positive the word and the same thing or the translation of the Bride will be the same thing the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word so this translation is not outside in is inside out the body this new body that we have to take off with he said it will materialize around the world in you or can the Lord I shout in the house Oh Glory to God Gloria God do you understand right now why the foolish version can't make it they would not make it because they didn't have the word in them because the oil is the word turned to Spirit oh give the Lord some Praises they wasn't receiving the word how could he receive the spirit even not receiving the word my words are spirit and their life and the foolish version didn't have the atonement in its fullness so the heart was to be judged but the bribe will have their tourmal in the fullness and that's the blood right there that's the Seven Ten that's right there that's the virtues right there the atonement in his fullness the bride gonna have it or give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God praise God so when you receive the baptism Holy Ghost it's a new man inside of there oh Gloria got a new man going inside the deer a new nature something pushing out on Saturday is that right Hallelujah Oh Glory to God ticklemore I'll be along with you but some solid stuff we have here now put a Branham watch he does the Earth he's going to use the same time reemption the same way he repented by person water there's a Noah Jesus come and Sanctified dropping his blood and a new earth that succumbed is to have Holy Fire baptism to clean of every devil every germ every sickness I saw on you have my head you become a new person not a all by joining trying to tune a new page but you are a complete brand new unit God takes the old man and burns him completely out and the Holy Ghost and Fire and comes on himself and sends down your representation Oh Glory to call your representation coming down from God Holy Ghost and Fire Hallelujah God sending on your representation Oh Glory to God so this is not no talk this is expression this is manifestation Oh Glory to God no man can come to me except my Father John I think I want to read it again God takes the old man burns him completely out with the Holy Ghost on Fire and comes himself and sends down your representation oh praise God praise God hallelujah from God's power to transform he said how many in here that doesn't have the seed of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't think I've ever read that before because you hear this one the prophecy how many here that doesn't have the seed of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost would you just raise your hand and say remember me brother Brandon that I will receive the Holy Spirit no you take the wood in your heart and believe it and you could look up and go up and look at the mirror and see where you are at so he call the seed of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word seed was there before the real seed and the word form the seed Hallelujah so God put the seed in your face glory to God and then send fire or a spirit to baptize you that baptize that seed inside of there oh give the Lord some praises glory to God glory to God some people like to say you can have the Buffalo goes 24 hours they'll be lost that's a quote but baptism where you can have baptism in your body you gotta bring me a spirit but your soul and be lost that's not what we're talking about that's not what are you talking about if that Doctrine is correct then Peter didn't have to go in the upper room baptism that's right deception we read it the whole the dry season their soul open the upper room a dry have no life for that you are deceived but I have no life in it behaving so you have no life on it Oh Glory to God take a dry seed and get up to the upper room the Bible said they hold themselves up haul themselves up my name's healing to go but they had to hold themselves up because Jesus said wait until the power of about Jew and perform on high wait in the city of Jews carry their weight fat but we know what happened so let me read it again you know I had a stick you know how many in here that doesn't have the seed of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh praise God all right [Music] nearly done Hallelujah there'll be a chocolate message one day you know to shake the old days I don't know if this is it but there we go Matthew 13 Jesus speaks verse 24. another parallel he put forth into them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is lightning under a man that sold good seed in this field and while men slept his enemy came and saw tears among the wheat and went his way and when the brain was sprung up and brought for fruit then appeared the tears also so the Servants of the householder came and said of them sir this not those who could see them that I feel from Winston at a tear he said unto them an enemy had done this deceiving them without them that we go and guarding them up he said got up the tears you root of the wheat with them let them boat grow together shout out together until the Harvest leave them any message until Harvest Time until Harvest Time leave them say they believe until Harvest Time watch let them watch again until the Harvest and in the time of the Harvest I will say to the Reapers gather each together first of tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but guarded the witch into my band that's busted from verse 36 it reads then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came at him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field so Jesus gives a parable everyone is there talking no this is this is private Revelation disciples this is Jesus disciples talking about and he answered and said unto them he that's what they could seed is the son of man Hallelujah he was talking about a man so I see he come and give them more details who doing this thing now he just threat the good seat is the son of man the field is the world The Good Seed at the children of the Kingdom [Music] Children of the Kingdom call them goat seed boy Hallelujah is the enemies that's what you are tonight you know oh God say that you know I'm not much of Flesh talking to you God said that you know I don't know what the hell telling you tonight but God said that you know oh come and preach back to me somebody Oh Glory to God the feel is the world the good see that the children of the Kingdom but the tears and the children of the wicked one the enemy that saw them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels as therefore the tears are guarded and building the fire so shall it be in the end of the world the son of man shall send for his angels and they shall guard out of his kingdom all things that offend and then I do iniquity I shall cast them to a fullness of fire they shall be willing on gnashing of teeth oh blessed be the name of the Lord let's go now he said the seed of God the word of God and Jesus said in a certain place the word is a seed amen amen and every single before of his kind now if the Christian the children of God the children of the Kingdom has become the seed of God then there must be the word of God and break it up if the children are the children at the seed then they have to be the word Oh Glory to God hallelujah watch watch then the seed of God then there must be the word of God the word of God manifested in the age that they're living in for the promising of that age God gave his word at the beginning and and each age has had a seed its time its promises note what he said each Aid has its seed it's time and its promises now we live through Luther's age Wesley age all along to the ages the Pentecostal age each age is given a promise of the word and the people of that age that manifests that promised word is the seed of that age not to talk over the people of that age that manifest the promised word is the seat of that age according to what Jesus said here they are the children of the Kingdom then you drink long deeper the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating through his children is those seed of the Kingdom at that age these are things we know but God come to Freshly anointed and inspired to you or give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so that's why Roman says therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not only to that is of the law but to that question of the fate of Abraham who is the father of us all oh blessed be the name of the Lord the promised children another after the flesh but the children of Promise is come to foreseed that's the scripture read is not right glory to God but around him these elect will not only the Eternal thoughts of God which are to be expressed in flesh and do season but these same elect was called by another name oh praise the name of the Lord for Oh Glory now do you believe that all right let me just skip here now now to Abraham and I see what the promise made he see it not as deceased the seeds of many but as of one which is Christ according to Romans 4 16. here we go we find that God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself and all believers under the designation because he said Abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on not only to narrow down his definition but rather to finalize it in Galatians 3 he identified the seeds singular with Jesus and conquered the children as children of promise and promise have to do with election or the chosen of God and that is exactly what we have been saying these were the Royal seed at the elect of God are the predestinated for known of God when the mind of God and his taught so God this is God tonight you are not just joining Church in the Community Church you come to this Tabernacle that is not so you have to be in the back part of God's mind God's thinking God's for knowledge I could see you getting free tonight I can see all the shell around you all the loudies say all the struggages everything getting Shaker for you tonight glory to God hallelujah praise God are you ready in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally do not expressed until each came forth in the designated decree season as each member came forth it become expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is literal spoken word seed bride now the word seed was there before the real seed here we go this bride is the literal spoken word see bright and though she is feminine in designation she's also called the body of Christ it is very apparent she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many-membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even on our lord Jesus Oh Glory to God and this is where we wrap up the title tonight then here we are coming to a conclusion are you ready as the Eternal logos God was manifesting the Sun and in Jesus dwell the fullness of the god bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifested in flesh thereby again the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many members spoken with sedan manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God it must be a so-called here we go are you ready we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn what can the Lord I shout in the house only the elect Oh Glory to God the new birth doesn't make you a seed but because you are seed you're gonna be reborn by the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost where there is virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness and badly

baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth it's the spirit of God coming in and filling you after you've repented after heard in the word heard the word after being baptized in water and answer the good conscience then he said Jacob have I love so have I hated Romans 9 13 neither was born neither had done good no evil you see it was the thought here we go this is a bit this is now we come to the end you know don't miss this part now then that thought become expressed God brought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed hiccup alone had the seed that is why he had respect for the birthright oh he was a trickster but that's called every man he was a con man with a cook but God said Jacob I love why would God say that because Jacob was a seed growing up God you are see you
