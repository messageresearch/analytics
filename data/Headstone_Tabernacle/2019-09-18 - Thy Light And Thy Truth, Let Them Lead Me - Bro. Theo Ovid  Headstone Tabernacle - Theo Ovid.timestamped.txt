[22:40] I depart I will send him unto you when
[22:43] he has come he reproved a wolf of sin
[22:45] and of righteousness and of judgment of
[22:47] sin because they believe not on me of
[22:50] righteousness because I go to my father
[22:53] and you see me no more
[22:54] of judgment because the prince of this

[23:25] comment it and and blessed in Jesus name
[23:27] we ask it
[23:28] amen and amen before I ever ceases to
[23:30] know and greet somebody in Jesus name
[23:41] always good to see all of you all
[23:43] tonight it's a blessing you make a
[23:46] sacrifice as one into cancer service
[23:49] tonight when I was all terrible but I
[23:52] decided to just let things be and you
[23:54] are out tonight so that's me you're not
[23:56] dry weather Christians you don't have to
[23:59] have all the sunshine you could offer in
[24:01] also still come out amen
[24:03] so that's good even tonight I have a
[24:05] title and it's from the scripture itself
[24:07] Psalms for the tree and the title have
[24:10] is delight and I true let them lead me
[24:12] now I hope that this give or take this
[24:14] as a as a pendant as a word for you that
[24:18] you let the light thy light and I truth
[24:20] let let them lead me enough an
[24:23] inspiration the guide and from a message
[24:26] God's Word call for total separation
[24:27] from unbelief he said if God said let
[24:31] there be light and there was no light
[24:32] that isn't then that isn't that that
[24:35] isn't what God said when God say
[24:37] everything he must backup artisan so
[24:40] gorgeous don't say other words and when
[24:42] the word of God has been vindicated the
[24:45] would have been vindicated that is right
[24:48] [Applause]
[24:49] now the word itself isn't light until
[24:55] it's vindicated light
[24:58] if God's another delight and there was
[25:00] no light then it wasn't the Word of God
[25:01] but when light sprung up on the earth
[25:03] that showed the word was vindicated and
[25:06] it was light and today here we go
[25:10] if God made a promise when that promise
[25:13] is vindicated then that is light that is
[25:16] the light of the day when the wood is
[25:19] vindicated the wood of the hour is
[25:21] vindicated and God has one way of
[25:24] bringing light to you not to ease not
[25:28] ten weeks one way of bringing light to
[25:30] you that is when you are ready to
[25:33] separate yourself from all the things of
[25:36] the world and the cares of the world and
[25:39] plea only to the promise would that's a
[25:43] choice that's a choice action you have
[25:47] to be ready to say you know what this is
[25:49] it this is the pull of grid price you
[25:52] will sell all to get this hallelujah
[25:55] let me say it again this would seem God
[25:57] has one way of began like to you that is
[26:00] when you are ready to separate yourself
[26:02] from all the things of the world and all
[26:05] the cares of the world and cling only to
[26:07] the promise would Alleluia Paul was a
[26:10] Nazarite unto the Lord he was separated
[26:12] from the Orthodox Church to the Word of
[26:14] the Living God even was a Nazarite unto
[26:16] the Lord he was separated from the among
[26:18] the Brethren that we had a bit stone to
[26:20] be high priest it's a portal separation
[26:22] we are not to go back into the world
[26:24] no more other need to do with the world
[26:26] but cleave only under God here we go
[26:28] Jesus is coming after bright a woman a
[26:32] church that is separated from the teeth
[26:35] of the world or the cares of the world
[26:37] she is separated from the fashions of
[26:40] this modern age that we live in she is
[26:42] separated from the cares and the
[26:43] tradition of churches she is separated
[26:45] Oh little God and God is the word and a
[26:49] husband and wife is one so does the
[26:51] bride and would becomes one for the wood
[26:53] is living through the bride that's our
[26:57] credentials
[26:58] that's her identification not this
[27:01] church that church her credentials is a
[27:02] worth living who ID card is the word
[27:05] linen or glorious is beautiful you know
[27:07] this is beautifully done do with Church
[27:09] you know this afternoon will be coming
[27:11] fresh inside of you this has tremendous
[27:13] alone could imagine that is your
[27:16] identification card were livin which one
[27:19] could condemn me of sin that what Jesus
[27:22] said because of what was living in him
[27:23] or glory regardless continue watch if I
[27:28] could pull out a PhD led and show you my
[27:30] credentials from a civilization or some
[27:32] school that school recognized that
[27:34] credential but the only credential that
[27:38] a believer has is the word living in him
[27:41] declaring that Jesus Christ lives in
[27:44] that person that's what you're fighting
[27:46] for not to come to church but to go up
[27:49] the hill his holy hill and he says and I
[27:54] keep and send a light that we may go up
[27:56] there or glory to God and he sent his
[27:59] fruit and he sent his light he sent the
[28:02] street farmers were to a profit this and
[28:04] the light of the ovens indicated the
[28:05] world that we could claim that's why he
[28:08] said I did not come to build another
[28:10] denomination I came to build individuals
[28:13] interest touch of a perfect man that
[28:15] they can become a powerhouse don't you
[28:18] ever forget that
[28:21] not for them to become church members
[28:23] for this is he become a powerhouse
[28:25] let's continue and we are so this is
[28:30] some time with different titles what I
[28:32] was beginning to do maybe is to tell you
[28:34] how much books that we get equal sum I
[28:37] want so I don't want to read it like a
[28:39] flu so it's not one book it's several
[28:42] different books but it have a
[28:44] continuously in it and that's what I
[28:45] have to fight to find the continuity I
[28:48] know that sometimes we could preach free
[28:50] and straight and what some people like
[28:51] that but I can like this too because
[28:54] this is this is seen what it did see
[28:56] and you seen it with inspiration and you
[28:58] know you get in seasons after you isn't
[29:01] that right
[29:01] so what she wants something now he said
[29:03] now watch you see Foreman of the body
[29:06] from the feet coming up when he was here
[29:09] and he was the son and he was killed the
[29:12] church each took his place and then
[29:14] matched them to the Dark Ages on begin
[29:16] to build on a foundation coming out
[29:17] where does the site come from at the top
[29:20] of the head then it started right back
[29:22] coming back the church coming back from
[29:23] the feet notice it's the head thing you
[29:26] can't see with your hands yet this part
[29:29] of your body you can't see with your
[29:31] ears yet it come here you can't see what
[29:34] it knows but gets its spells you can't
[29:36] see with the lips - it speaks that was a
[29:39] Pentecostal age but no is he i time be
[29:42] seen so another see God at the same
[29:46] light so God sent a seer a prophet
[29:49] written Branham as he's here because he
[29:52] had even like the shame that the bride
[29:55] will know how to claim where to go that
[29:59] the word could be a lamp unto your feet
[30:01] and a light unto your part because that
[30:04] is what Amelie lamb for the shine light
[30:07] the world is the lamp it's not right the
[30:10] light is fully show you how to go or
[30:13] close to we're not without a guide the
[30:15] Holy Ghost is the guy so God take the
[30:18] prophet but he didn't take the guide the
[30:20] guided surfers are promised this I will
[30:22] not leave you comfortless but I will
[30:25] release the spirit of truth not of error
[30:32] all your meanness of spirit of truth
[30:35] oh yes the spirit of truth to come to
[30:38] leave you and guide you into all truth
[30:40] or we believe that they can't work let's
[30:43] continue now so now is the eye time the
[30:46] scene no this is there isn't one moving
[30:49] faculty beyond the eye the next is the
[30:52] intelligence go glory record here we go
[30:55] which is Christ himself
[30:58] who controls the whole body
[31:01] not not bishop not no apostle not no new
[31:04] prophet hallelujah
[31:06] after Malachi floor is promised Christ
[31:10] himself because this message was the
[31:13] introduced the Messiah come on on that
[31:17] introduced a bunch of men introduce the
[31:19] Messiah Christ himself the intelligence
[31:23] coming to govern the entire body
[31:25] Oh glory to God they'll fall upon the
[31:29] prophets foundation the intelligence
[31:31] which is the cap which is the mind of
[31:33] Christ which is dynamics Oh glory to God
[31:36] which is the anointing promise come upon
[31:38] a bride Oh glory to God and it coming as
[31:41] the Spirit of Truth to guide us into all
[31:44] truth or get a lot of show so it's not
[31:47] listen I listen it's a guide that take
[31:50] you pay a destination or glory don't got
[31:53] a wonderful glorious baptism of the Holy
[31:57] Ghost
[31:57] where there is virtue and knowledge and
[31:59] temperance and patience and quality some
[32:01] public honest and charity that's what
[32:04] the guy will come and lead us to Oh
[32:06] glory to God so what is light sent for
[32:09] so you can see how to get the wrong it's
[32:13] very simple tonight nothing complicated
[32:15] about this what is lights and fall for
[32:17] you to see how to get are wrong because
[32:19] now this I went in the darkness
[32:21] now hallelujah people blind and wretched
[32:23] and miserable naked so question of
[32:25] probability right evening light because
[32:28] it was getting dark for us to see the
[32:30] last bit of it to get on the way how we
[32:33] thank God for healing light this is a
[32:36] darkness you know we got evening light I
[32:38] miss all the blackout we got even like
[32:40] we are walking in the light tonight Oh
[32:43] hallelujah glory to God Amen hallelujah
[32:48] so he said in the evening time it's
[32:50] shabby like what is that gospel like
[32:52] what does that do is the Holy Spirit
[32:54] what does it do it write in the crop in
[32:57] the last days the Holy Spirit will pour
[33:00] out in time
[33:03] gone but I don't you get that that's
[33:06] prophecy the Holy Spirit will pour out
[33:09] in time in the last days to bring in the
[33:13] latter in drilling or chlorine of God is
[33:19] not powerful tonight that you are under
[33:22] prophecy not maybe not perhaps the Holy
[33:27] Spirit with pour out in time in the last
[33:31] days to bring in the latter in because
[33:34] like the real rain but first first
[33:40] how are you would have a rain when we
[33:42] are still planting denominational seeds
[33:44] bringing forth more unbelief all the
[33:45] time why don't you plan to gospel seed
[33:48] to bring for the power of God in the
[33:51] resurrection
[33:52] so God couldn't just drop rain or kinda
[33:55] old sees God get the first separation
[33:57] look at the shock separate from the seed
[33:59] so he sent seven thunders to gather the
[34:02] bride together to show the bride home to
[34:04] prepare to give the brightness down on
[34:07] the will church look at the Lord show or
[34:10] glory love God who brought the thunders

[35:52] light it's not as if what is a seed but

[36:04] of the world is the light the germ of
[36:07] life lives within the green the light is
[36:10] what breaks forth and brings forth the
[36:12] life out of the green that's to me
[36:14] Christ in the world makes the world do
[36:18] what it's supposed to do just like the
[36:21] life in the grain of wheat or whatever
[36:23] it is it makes the wheat or supposed to
[36:25] do because in it is the life that's in
[36:27] it so life is only by the Word of God
[36:31] made manifest
[36:33] I miss again life is only by the will of
[36:39] God made manifest life comes only by the
[36:42] Word of God made manifest as long as
[36:45] it'll just in the book like this it
[36:48] still can be questioned but when it's
[36:53] made manifest then you see the product
[36:57] of water spoke of being manifested as
[37:02] long as is in books and tapes we could
[37:05] argue and debate but when that will
[37:08] become a Living Word
[37:10] when that will become fresh when that
[37:12] will become manifested
[37:14] Sanders delight Oh glory to God

[38:09] anything because there's no light there
[38:11] but as soon as I strikes it it will
[38:13] bring forth life if it's a charity
[38:16] season that's the same thing as in the
[38:18] world it would have God when the light
[38:20] strikes it it brings the world to life
[38:22] again and every years has been like that
[38:25] how we appreciate these great things how
[38:29] the world has been vindicated as the
[38:30] light of the spoken word
[38:32] Oh glory to God hallelujah now if he
[38:35] said it I know like come then we don't
[38:37] know whether it's true or not
[38:38] we won't know where he is all right we
[38:41] don't know where he is going or not
[38:43] because he just said let there be and
[38:45] there wasn't but when God speaks and we
[38:48] see it is then that's the light that
[38:51] shines for the truth of the word there
[38:55] is the light under life and him was life
[39:03] life was the light of men Oh glory to

[41:17] spiritual can live without God's light
[41:20] life can only come in by light let a
[41:27] letter have to switch over it has to
[41:28] become light yes because only light
[41:31] could bring life Jesus a the flesh
[41:36] profiteth nothing the ways that I speak
[41:40] they are spirit and they are life the
[41:44] same the words are mechanic and dynamic
[41:45] to hollowly would have power in and to
[41:48] power to transform when Peter was
[41:50] sharing his testimony with Cornelius
[41:52] host was just words but what was was it
[41:55] was it Peter words of God's word God
[41:58] would was coming on that man's mouth and
[41:59] while Peter was speaking speaking the
[42:01] word the Holy Ghost take a hold upon
[42:03] that and God so corny this half
[42:05] condition and that would had fire on it
[42:08] another hour on it and God shoot it and
[42:11] come straight into his heart and he was
[42:13] filled with the Holy Ghost he was filled
[42:16] with power he was filled with the same
[42:18] blessing they had they couldn't believe
[42:20] it
[42:21] the same power that came on Jews and
[42:23] Noah pondage and then it come to a
[42:26] conclusion of our truth God is no
[42:28] respecter or there's a lot of shock oh
[42:31] my god I feeling we're on a church
[42:34] tonight

[58:04] it's random tree guys come and
[58:07] common-sense like medicine when you see
[58:08] him pretty much weird and the fella said
[58:10] the conscripted thing is what is the
[58:14] mountain supposed to be with this fire
[58:15] supposed to be what suppose they call on

[59:04] they want out the light of Kings so
[59:07] marry either helps or the Egypt and I'm
[59:09] so much with the baby Jesus isn't
[59:11] alright let's continue why okay I'm skip
[59:14] all right the Hong mo on Roman tree and
[59:17] out come the bright reality promise we
[59:19] see in the scriptures how in order to
[59:22] get the bride like the pyramid how it
[59:23] comes in minority all the time from the
[59:25] great white from Luther Wesley Pentecost
[59:27] then the capstone in the top of it is so
[59:30] honed but each one of those stones are
[59:31] so perfectly put together we don't know
[59:33] how they set it it's so perfectly put
[59:35] together though we not promote each
[59:37] enough enough built it a long time ago
[59:39] the previous stands is assemble go into
[59:41] the prophets chamber and watch them
[59:42] seven steps where did they God meet the
[59:45] challenge to bring the comma into the
[59:47] prayers of the king at the top of the
[59:49] steps so the king not coming on to you
[59:52] on your way you iron oh you have to
[59:54] climb up there you have to climb up
[59:56] seven steps the king is on the hill he's
[1:00:02] on the seventh step Oh hallelujah their
[1:00:06] Shores we have got to become again the
[1:00:08] same spirit that was on John he
[1:00:10] introduced the Messiah he was great on
[1:00:12] all the prophets so we have got to come
[1:00:14] to a place again
[1:00:15] to something that's going to introduce a
[1:00:17] messiah how will the people that's
[1:00:20] believing him know it unless they're
[1:00:23] constantly in the word to know what he
[1:00:27] is
[1:00:27] Oh hallelujah the wise shall know it but
[1:00:31] the way unwise wouldn't know watch so
[1:00:33] they shall know their God how he appear
[1:00:35] in the last days is to bring the people
[1:00:37] back to the world so the bride will know
[1:00:39] a husband know her mate the revealed
[1:00:42] word so your husband is the word
[1:00:45] revealed not understood revealed so
[1:00:49] therefore you fighting for revelation
[1:00:51] therefore you fight them to get in the
[1:00:53] spirit and every demon in Hell fightin
[1:00:55] people getting in the spirit so that's
[1:00:59] why saying that messages has taken four
[1:01:01] hours to explain will be half an hour in
[1:01:04] the spirit if the spirit is there given
[1:01:07] people revelation not just understanding
[1:01:09] but divine revelation that's the rock
[1:01:12] admissible let search Jesus in Irak
[1:01:17] speech I've done a lot of things you
[1:01:18] know you just see that I am so I'm see
[1:01:21] at this and you see when people talking
[1:01:22] with other people they like to talk
[1:01:23] about a20 talking flowing but when we
[1:01:28] put the guns on them and so who do you
[1:01:30] say I am silence they get caught because
[1:01:35] they have no revelation of who that man
[1:01:36] Sunday with his beard or something like
[1:01:39] a Christ the Son of the Living God

[1:01:48] on whatsapp infraction text you that
[1:01:49] flesh and blood did not reveal up to you
[1:01:52] that means something struck him
[1:01:55] he's illiterate even any night Christ he
[1:02:01] went on clay and hide but he gets in
[1:02:04] Revelation and Jesus said upon this rock
[1:02:07] I will build my church and the gates of
[1:02:09] hell and I'm saying that Jesus is the
[1:02:14] same yesterday today and forever he
[1:02:18] could give you revelation tonight it has
[1:02:21] nothing to do with the person next to
[1:02:23] you

[1:16:20] you you cannot understand it now but
[1:16:23] when he comes he will guide you to it
[1:16:25] that's the reason the common of the
[1:16:29] seals at the finishing of the seventh
[1:16:33] seal the mystery of God should be
[1:16:36] finished to know who God is what is how
[1:16:41] he lives his nature this being your
[1:16:44] supposed to be all the way up there by
[1:16:47] that time to bring us to the full
[1:16:50] structure of sons and daughters of God a
[1:16:52] church that's wash in the blood of
[1:16:54] Christ that is the purpose of the seals
[1:16:57] that is why we have seals to bring us
[1:17:01] into that the whole purpose of the seals
[1:17:03] is to bring us into that place know who
[1:17:06] God is to know what he is to know how he
[1:17:09] lives
[1:17:10] because cause objective and motive all
[1:17:13] the time was to reveal himself because
[1:17:15] he was too mysterious and he didn't want
[1:17:18] to remain so mysterious he wanted to
[1:17:20] come down to man to unfold and reveal
[1:17:22] himself so we can't make quite a whole
[1:17:25] mysterious thing again when he was
