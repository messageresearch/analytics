That is a really beautiful Quran. pass my cares upon you. Anytime I don't know what to do, I cast my cares upon. Let's bow our heads and pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this tremendous opportunity that you have given up upon us to call upon your name and I pray your presence will settle over every heart, over every mind, over your life connected here tonight. May your presence be with them in a special way. We such a needy people as we see troubles times, Lord. As we see things that are so unsettling, nerve-wracking, shaken, but you're all us to have perfect peace in you and trust in you and confidence in you. And may that be shown here tonight by your word and by your spirit. Granted, God in Jesus name I ask it. Bless them as we exhort them a few words and they get on in prayer. In Jesus mighty I ask it. Amen and amen. Good to have all of you here tonight. And as always, it's a blessing. We counting down about what 5 years doing this. And it's quite an experience. Quite an experience of this journey of life. And I was thinking about how technology going to be positioned in a way to enforce the B system that is going to come over the whole world, you know. And I was thinking about how the tree that man partake of was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When you ex examine it closely, everything man build that appears to be good have a evil side to it. Whether is airplane, whether whatever it is, it has a side that is negative. Why? Because man did it in his element in his uh genetic code of to be a son of God. He has this ability to to make subroducts like create if I could use that word there or make things that was never here before. And as man get more adept and how they reach to the point of this artificial intelligence it speed up things so much more. They say they say now people don't have to learn to learn to code because the AI could do the coding. So man is accelerating on a pace that is incredible. And the question we have to ask ourselves is what about the church? What pace are we moving at? What is the rhythm? What is the beat? Why is there such a lack of faith? And the question Jesus himself asks that question when the son of man cometh shall he find faith in the earth what will happen to this fate and it's kind of odd because Malachi 4 William Brham will send eternal hearts back to the face of the fathers and yet Jesus is saying when the son of man cometh shall he find faith in the earth man has become very confident in himself in his ability in technology in particular in science man is very confident they have seen you know in a couple of years back I don't know why I'm talking tonight I have something to share with you and I'm just talking right now but a couple of years back lifespan was about 50 something 60 something even before that was lower than that but man with all the crazy food you know you talk about um bad food and and and this food and that food, but actually people are living longer than before. It's not like they're freaking out at 43 or 50 or whatever it is. People are living long lives and they are living long enough to see the transition that man has come to in terms of science and achievement. Now God Ran taught us that horse and buggy with car, airplane, astronaut that it was reflective of the ages that was being unfolded. Luther, Wesley, um the Pentecostal, then Malachi 4. So we will have to appreciate the fact that if science is moving in that pace that gear that transformational gear that means somewhere along the line the church have to tap into this transformational gear. No but did say what we see manifested temporarily will be manifest in his fullness when the press come down. We know a press is coming and for that press to come certain things has to happen. Jesus when he came, we know the story. He shook up the religious world at that time with signs, wonders, miracles, with deliverances and everything else. His whole operation exposed the fraudulent tradition of man's spirit that was upon the scribing Pharisees. They in turn had to reject the manifestation of the fulfillment of the word. And in rejecting it, that is where the government made their play. That is where the press came down. That is where he was turned over to be crucified. And I believe it's a similar thing today. You have a message. We have a word. But the bride must be and will be not the word word talked or the word explained or the word discussed, but the bride must be the word manifested. Now, so it changes the picture of what we are to become and how God wants us. Now, when Jesus was coming down to the final part of his ministry, which was at the garden of Gethsemane, he had a choice. The choice was his. He made a choice and he expressed it clearly. If it is possible, let this cup pass. Nobody desires debt. Nobody walk after debt. Nobody walks after the cross. Nobody. It's a leading. It's a burden. It's a price. Even this thing called the debt of a corner wheat. We could live selfish lives that we live onto ourselves. And we can live a life that really is for others. This is what the lily is all about. pressing above the mock and the mer and the old oil and whatever come down that stream and let me press out to give a flower and give a perfume not for itself but for the bees or those that will come around and after all God crush us in whatever way process in whatever way we ought and should have some kind of perfume that comes out of our lives that it would serve to help others. Remember as I close in on this part here that one day that last name will come in that last name on the book and that book will be closed. Remember time was given to fulfilled purpose. Remember time itself have a cap is not just unending. It's time as a beginning time and the end ending. And for each one of our lives, we have a beginning and let's say an ending or the rapture. But within that space, we have something to do. Father, not my will, but your will be done. That done part is what each one of us have to come to as an individual. So tonight, I want to read a scripture and this is from Luke 18, familiar scripture. And he and this is from verse one of Luke 18. If you have Bibles, want to look at it. Jesus speaks and he speak a parable unto them unto this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint. And that's my title this this evening. Men ought always to pray and not to faint. To faint is to give up. To faint is to lose heart. To faint is to let go. To faint is to be discouraged and wear. And he spake upon them to descend the men to pray always to pray and not faint. saying, "There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither a regarded man." And there was a widow in that city. She came unto him, saying, "Avenge me of mine adversary, and he would not for a while." But afterwards he said within himself, "Though I fear not God nor regard man, yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, least by her continual coming, she wear me." And the Lord said, this is the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust judge saith. Shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him, though he be alone with him? I tell you, he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth." May God bless his word." So, there we have it. It's interesting how Jesus didn't give this woman as a married woman. He give this woman as a widow. A woman without a husband. A widow widow. A a woman without this male support. A wid a widow woman. A woman standing alone. Standing with her trials, a [Music] destined. And she wants justice. She wants a breakthrough. She wants a deliverance. both of our children or family. She wants that. And she goes to this judge and this judge he fear God no man. He don't care who you are, where you come from, what tie, no tie, what poor, widow, doesn't matter. He fearless. But this woman have an agenda to get her needs met. And sometimes to get to that spot, you have to get really stirred up in your spirit. Because every time we going towards something, there's always something to discourage you. There is always something to keep you back. Whether it's ambition, whether it's vision, whether is planning, whether it's discipline, it doesn't matter what it is. The devil want to thwart the plans that you may have in your heart because you have to have things in your heart. If you have, you know, like what could God guide if you don't have a plan? If you have a plan, God could say not so, not so this week. God put it in the heart of man to take leadership role. God put it in the heart of man to overcome, to stand, man conquer mountains, man conquer valleys, man conquer the sky, man conquer all kind of things. Man conquer because it is in the heart of man to be a conqueror. This what we supposed to be. But it said our Christians under a religious canopy wants to stay in that religious mode. And I was thinking something better talk about man and I spoke about it I think last time spirit man then flesh man and how God couldn't tell Adam in Genesis 1 of all the fruit you may eat Adam had no mouth to eat nothing. So he couldn't address eating in Genesis 1. He couldn't address certain things in Genesis 1 at all. And I realize now even in the our father prayer Isaac went down and did it. Our father who art in heaven start at the spirit level out of the zone of earth. Later on it have give us this day our daily bread. This is the physical man. Now in the physical realm this natural man offense will happen. So forgive us our sins. Temptations will happen. Keep us from temptation. So then you see the channel of God. First the kingdom and then for thine be the honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. It starts with the kingdom. It end with the kingdom. It start with God. It end with God. It's a perfect prayer. It's an ideal prayer. It's what Jesus have prayed. And it tells us we are not just earthly people. We are not just natural people. So this woman instead of getting threw off, turn off, discouraged, faint, give up. Oh god, the man wicked. He see no husband. He's a wicked man. You know how people talk already. Instead of going in that mode to look for sympathy instead of getting that mode to look for who will help me and nobody to help me and the see husband is the pension and and and wherever he remain and wherever he didn't leave and whatever it is she didn't go in that mode she went in the mode of this need to solve I wanted result is not that she don't know the judge is a hard man but she ignored that and sometimes to get where you need to go to get what you need to ask to get what you need to persist after. You have to go beyond what appears to be negative, what appears to be mountains, what appears to be doors closed to you because God is a way maker. God is a protector. God is a strength giver. And if tonight you're faintish, you're fainting, Isaiah 40:31 says, "But they that wait upon the Lord shall not maybe renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint." This is positive. This have no ambiguity ambiguity in in it. And they that wait will renew their strength, mount up, run, walk, and not faint. So prayer is a powerful thing. Waiting upon the Lord is a powerful thing. Psalms 138:3, "In the day when I cry, thou answerest me and strengthenest me with strength in my soul." How many want strength here tonight? Because God gives strength. If we listen to the politicians, if we listen to what happening in the world, right? That man rocking in the north and having the world upside down, twisted and twy and everything else and people worried and concerned and whatnot. that God could give strength to you here tonight who might be faintish, fainting, struggling to hold on and weary and you feel God is not answering your prayer because yeah is you are one of those who like instant gratification and you don't have the discipline to wait and if you don't have the discipline to wait you'll be taken. you get in trouble because this is where you want this and you want it now. You want this, you want to have it now and your fellow should work out now. And God said no, you have to wait. And in waiting is where the testing come. In waiting is where the strengthening come. If God give you all that you desire as you want it, you will have zero discipline. You would be moving into a spirit of entitlement and the day he doesn't give you like a child you would throw a tantrum and you would carry on and want to know what going on because and brother Brandham had a experience with speaking for scribes and he spoke and he finally was waiting long he said thank you Lord for two he said but God said but you spoke for three and God made him wait until that third one appeared Because this is part of God's character. My word shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish. So God's character have to do with thought, words, expression and waiting for a manifestation. The upper room people had 11 days or so to wait. Wait for the promise for the power from on hand. Somebody could have created hey you know we had power already you know I cast out devils and whatn not and but he was talking about that power if Jesus was talking about that power that they had while they were working with him he could have said so but this was different this was permanent power not the temp temporary power he was putting them in position to be effectively used because it means their character would have been affected all that power and anointing upon on them. There was no effect upon their character because one want to know who is greater. One mother come and say put one of my son right hand and left hand. They had the jealousies and the envy that the issues and that's what the upper room was about to get that sorted out to get the vomit out to get the foolishness out to get who greater than who who had and who who are more ministry than who who and all that nonsense blown out. Because when that fire come that fire has come to burn that fire to come to discuss nothing. That fire just burn and that same fire to come back to burn again. How many want that fire tonight? So if you are fainting, if you are fearful, there's a word for you. There's a blessing for you. And that is why men want to pray and not to faint, not to give up. Listen to this. Samson Judges 16. And Samson called unto the Lord and said, "Oh Lord God, remember me, I praise thee. Strengthen me, I praise thee this once, oh God, that I may be at once avenge of the Philistines of my two eyes." Samson, he asked God to avenge him. A man who went into wickedness with delight. But you know what? He was born a son. He was always a son. He fell but that doesn't mean he is a failure. Did you get that Samson fell that does not make him a failure it means he fell and this prayer he prayed strengthen me and avenge me he come into a full recognition that even though he failed he could bounce back. Do you have the courage to bounce back? I see people battered and beaten. I'm thinking on having a seminar concerning broken men, a men's seminar. Pray for me because that inspiration came and I failed to have seminar on broken men. How we do we fix that? Men that are broken, broken by finances, by marriage, by women, by money, by whatever broken men. How do we fix that? Samson would have been a broken man. His eyes was out. He grinding at the mill. He's ordinary. He recognized the anointing is no longer with him. And yet the first opportunity he saw that there was a possibility because that is what it's about. In other words, if tonight there is a possibility with a simple prayer your whole destiny could change, won't you want to pray that prayer? If tonight there is a possibility of a transformational opportunity for you, your family, your life by what you ask God tonight, then everything is over right now tonight for you. A change of course, a change of path, a change in your being. And I want to note that Peter and Andrew and all the guys who was in the upper room, they were changed men when they came out from there. They were anointed before. They participate in ministry before. But Jesus told them, "Sit down. Shut up. Sit down. Keep quiet. Don't preach. Don't go out there. Sit down until they get power from on high. Hush them out. Keep quiet." Does it sound too rough? I hope I don't find it too rough here. But I want to get your message across. How serious it was this promise of the father. It wasn't Jesus saying that to him. He said the promise of the father. Before that he taught them if I don't go the comforter will not come. So he knew the comforter was coming. He knew I am with you but I shall be in you. He can't be in them physically. He's prophesying. He's talking about spirit. He even said it in words in John 3 7:37. He that believeth on me as the scripture said out his belly fat. rivers of living water. This spake he of the spirit that was not yet given because Jesus Christ was not yet glorified. So the spirit was not yet released to effectively change these men. He was with them and they got an anointing to work with him. But the spirit had to be released. So when he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Ghost," he was prophesying the breath of God upon them that the spirit would surely come. Now I know you feel something here tonight. I know you know you are sons and daughters of God under a promise. Regardless of what you're going through right now, it doesn't change what God promised you. Let me repeat that. Regardless of where you are at, regardless of what you're going through, it doesn't change what God promised you. And yes, maybe you could be in that position tonight like that with a woman. Maybe you have no support. Maybe you have nobody to lean on and you want a breakthrough. You want and you know that you cannot just sit there and just, you know, well, I pray before I'm not going to pray that again. No, she keep pressing. She keep pressing. She could. It was a persistence. Persistent prayer. Persistent knock. Persistent asking. She was at it and that judge come to the conclusion if I don't if I don't answer this woman if I don't deal with this thing that go frustrate me he start to get a backlash from a persistence and this is what I want you to hit tonight a p a from persistent persistence in prayer persistence in faith persistence in attitude persistence in going after your goals persistent go that devils want to send everything to neg to bring a negative atmosphere and to bring something that will shoot you back. That's the devil job to push you back. And as you as they push you back with the boo as Gideon said on Wednesday night, you just have to bow him back. Amen. So I want to encourage you tonight. Oh father Thson, pray that prayer. David, Psalms 138. In the day when I cry, thou answers me and strengthens me with strength in my soul. We need strength. You know, some people might say, "God, but I need some money." Yeah, but David wasn't talking about money. Money could purchase things for the physical. But do you have strength in your soul? Because strength in your soul is independent of anything physical, whether money, whether husband, whether wife, whether children, family, or support. This woman didn't have a husband. She was a widow. But she had something in her strong enough to keep going, to keep pressing. You know who was similar? The woman who had the daughter of vex with the devil and she came and she woripped and and and disciples got so harassed. They felt so troubled with the woman. They tell Jesus, "Talk to this woman. Please handle her because she only terrorizing us." And Jesus stood there and say, "Uh-uh. Uh-uh. It's not fit to take the children's bread and give it to dogs. And the woman stood there. She moving. That is woman. Oh glory. Hallelujah. That is saint. How much saints we have in the building tonight. How much things we have in this virtual room tonight. That that is faith. That what that is. You know that is faith. She stood there and when she went through all the motions and went through all the emotions and motion she said even the d crumbs. What are you talking about? I am moving that. Yeah. go to Facebook, Instagram and complain and make comments and and and all kind of stuff and get much likes and people supporting me. Yes, boy. You see how she talk and the preacher talk. She wasn't going there. She stood around and said even the dogs take and Jesus said woman forget it about it. Your daughter is that devil gone for this saying for this what say it saying your daughter is made whole. What does that tells us? That tells us that we could say the right thing, we could say correct things, we could speak, we could pray, we could ask, we could believe and it could materialize itself. Oh, do you believe that tonight? Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Strength in your soul. Psalms 18:1-2, I will love thee, oh Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock, my fortress, my deliverer, my God, my strength in whom I will trust, my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower. And I think I'll close with this here this this part. This is Jesus now Luke 22 saying, "Father, if thou be willing, move this cup. Nevertheless, not my will, but thy will be done. I hear this part. And they appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him. This is Jesus the son of God going through this great test garden. And the Bible said when he said not my will, thy will be done, an angel came to strike them. That means we could get angelic support. That means because our attitude towards his will and will be done, we could get in our distress, in our weariness and and the battles and temptations, we could get angelic support like Jesus. And he got an angel to strengthen me. Let me see if I can wrap up here. Time is clicking over here. I have here the righteous cry. The Lord heareth and deliverth them of all their trouble. Jonah Junah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish belly and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited on Jonah and dry land. Note the Lord didn't speak to Jonah. What Junah wanted was out of that submarine. He wanted to put his foot on land because it's not easy to be inside that submarine of a fish. So God speak to Jonah. God spoke to the fish and said, "Get him out." And Jonah step out. He go and step. Let me just close with a few quotes from Barra that I think that would be so fine. And oho, let me give you this one about wisdom. If you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that give it to all men liberally and uprath not, and it shall be given him. And in wisdom, Solomon says, "Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that I may discern between good and bad." Look specifically praying. "For who is able to judge this thy so great a people?" And verse 9 says, "Behold, I have done according to thy words. Hello, I have given thee a wise and understanding heart that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. This is what God told someone about. You see what prayer does? Prayer is not exactly bringing God down to man. It is bringing man up to God. You see, as you pray, you lose sight of these earthly things. You sway out into somewhere else way beyond and on and on and on and on till you become into his presence and then a fate that you have laid it out before God and said now heal God here it is. I want to get well for this cause or I want you to do this for me or this cause I want you to heal me from this cancer or this TB or this anemma condition or whatever it is. I will walk before you. I will do everything I can. I will give this testimony everywhere I go. I will be happy to do that, Lord. I will use my life not for myself. I will use it for your glory to help others to see you. From another message, knowing knoweth all things, he says, "Angel is a servant. We are sons and daughters. Which is the most thought of, your servant or your son or daughter?" Oh my. Prayer. Yeah, there we go. Listen. From a saint will go a million times higher than an angel. Yes, sir. Because he's a son. He said, "How can God move on a man when his wife pray for him and vice versa? He may be a big church in the city, but God knows how to make him a little shop. Prayer does it." Almost done. You see, when you go to praying for somebody, something goes to taking place. There is where we fail. Friends, not praying. Prayer is the key note. Ask, you shall receive. You have not because you ask not. You ask not because you believe not. Ask abundance that your joy may be full. Ask and believe that you receive what you ask for. Then hold on to it. Don't leave it. It's a promise of God. It be revealed to you that God's going to give it to you. Hold on to it. God's plan is is is to make much of the man far more of him than anything else. Praise God. Men are God's method. The church is looking for better methods, but God is looking for better men. And when he when he found David and Saul acting the way he acting, he tells Samuel, don't bother with that man. I found a better man. I believe you are better men, better women here tonight that God have found. God knew from before you was even born what you will do and you'll be here tonight. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, I thank you tonight for these few chopped up words. But Lord, I believe the message got whom men ought to pray and not to faint. See what prayer can do, what prayer have brought. God, how each one of those saints of old, those soldiers of the cross, they prayed and you answered their prayer. Sometime the enemy want to bring such doubts and questions and fears as if our prayer will not be answered. But tonight we are encouraged by this widow woman who stood her ground and she pressed forward in faith believing you. And I pray each mother here, each father, each husband, each wife, each single sister, single brother, each child, each individual, each teenager, whoever is here, Lord God, that they will hold their ground as brother Gideon brought out stand and withstand, not just be defensive, but to take up offense. And that is why we have a shield that protects, but we have a sword that attacks. Oh God, help us tonight as they get along in prayer that we will feel confident that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is alive. And he's here to confirm his word with signs, wonders, and miracles. Granted, Lord, in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. And amen. I know I spent some time here tonight, but I pray and trust that this would help you in your Christian walk and in your faith in trusting God and believing him for all things as you get on in prayer. God bless you. Whizzle. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat [Music] [Music] up here.

[Music] Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord. Hallelujah. Oh blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Father we praise you tonight. Father, we thank you for your presence, Lord. We thank you for your spirit. We thank you for the anointing of God. Have your way, Lord Jesus. We look away to you tonight. We look away to your presence tonight. We look into your great ability tonight. You promise to strengthen, to heal, to guide, to lead, to deliver, to restore, look out, to baptize, to fill, to adopt, to refill. You promise of miracles, signs and wonders. That's the glory of the Lord that it covers the church. The glory of the Lord. What is it? Is signs and wonders and miracles. You promise all these things. Give us great hearts, great expectation, Father. Great faith to believe you that you would come on the scene and ride the tree once more. We bless you tonight. We thank you for the uncction. Thank you for the inspiration. Thank for the anointing among your people, oh God. May they have a good rest tonight. May the quickening power be upon them, upon their minds, upon their lives. And may your peace that passes all understanding rest on them. Your assurance that you never lose a battle. You never lost a battle, Father. And you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. You are still a way maker, still a provider, still a protector, still one who pro provides guidance. As we ask Lord, you said we have not because we ask not. And we come asking, believing, trusting that you would fulfill your word and confirm it among us. God, you sent a prophet that released spoken word promises, Lord, for the bride. But here we are waiting upon you. And you said through that prophet, wait till that little group that God will give that Elijah. Wait till they go to call upon God. There'll be a national showdown. Father God, may you store our hearts in faith. Still our hearts to believe you and to expect great things. You call us to ask for big things, for great things, not just for little things. Just like Elisha said, "Oh God, I want a double portion. Father God, give us great expectations. Give us great faith to believe you for Lord what might appear to be impossible." Father God, may you strike and inspire the people's heart tonight. I commit them into your hands. I commit this service this coming Sunday into your hands that your spirit would move expressly. Your spirit would speak and you would confirm your word with signs and wonders and miracles. Father God, have your way in our midst. Touch the elders, touch the ministry, Lord Jesus, touch your believers, each one from the open to the backbench, Lord. May you touch them and quicken them and make them alive unto you. May they come in the spirit to worship and to praise your name. May they come under great expectation for for you to fulfill and honor your word. Grant to God in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. And amen. Amen. God bless you. Looking forward to see you all on Sunday. We do have a life and God miss service tomorrow at 5. God bless you and have a good night. Praise the Lord.
