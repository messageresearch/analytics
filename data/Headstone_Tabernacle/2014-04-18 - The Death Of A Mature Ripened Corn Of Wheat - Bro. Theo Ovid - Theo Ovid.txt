Today is good Friday. Today Christ is crucified and we want to bring special message this morning and I trust that you'll be edified and strengthened. Amen. Amen. Reading from St. John 12:20. And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast. The same came therefore to Philillip which was of Bethesda of Galilee and desired him saying so we would see Jesus. Philip cometh and tellth Andrew. And again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come that the Son of Man should be glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corner wheat fall into the ground and die, it abide alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. free. Let's go to St. John chapter 15. I am the true vine and my father is the husband man. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, you take it away. And every branch that beareth fruit, he purchased it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. Abide in me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except you abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit. For without me you can do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch and is withered. And men gather them and cast them into the fire and they burned. If he abide in me and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you. And our last scripture from St. 21 18 and 19. Verily, verily I say unto thee, when thou was young, thou goodest thyself, and walkest whether thou wouldest, but when thou shall be old, and thou shalt stretch forth thine hands, and another shall thee, and carry thee whether thou wouldest not. This spake he signifying by what depth he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he said unto him, "Follow me." May God bless the number of Let us have a word of prayer. Almighty God, Lord, we're in the verge of the supernatural. Lord, we know your spirit is about to pour out. Father, prepare us, Lord. Prepare our hearts. Prepare our minds to receive this dynamics to your mechanic. Honor your word today. Confirm your word with signs. Wonder. May your word be glorified in our midst. In Jesus name I ask. Amen. And amen. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. [Music] [Applause] Have a title. The death of a mature ripened corn of wheat. Have a subject, the full maturity of the word turn into power by the death of a corn of wheat. [Music] I have an inspiration from the words Jesus told John to rather follow follow me to follow Christ the word. Now we have two major signs recently. The sign of Russia and the sign of the moon turn into blood. call it a blood moon and brother Brandham spoke about it that these are signs of the end time and the copper and the moon and so on make it turn into like blood and that happened on the 15th of this of this very week but I'm not going to talk about that I do want to bring something about Russia before we get down into the word. Now this is on my article 12 12th of March 2014 [Music] written by Mike Whitney Whitney and he he was saying this we are witnessing a huge geopolitical gamer in which the aim is the destruction of Russia as a political force of the US. This is this is a Russian man saying that. Another man said, "History shows that wherever the US medals, chaos and misery are soon to follow." [Music] Following a 30-year rampage that has reduced large swats of Central Asia, [Music] and the Middle East are anarchy and ruin. [Music] The US military has finally met its match. In this in Ukraine that that serves as a small operating base for Russia. and Ukraine. And they went on to talk about how uh Russia come and seize control of of Cremia, but I will skip now. Now I know you will known by now that Russia has made a move and seize a Cremia and Cremia is now part of Russia. [Music] Now this is what brother Brandham said in the angel of the Lord 1951. He said now uh uh he said we are nearing that time things will get worse and worse when Russia goes down there to get that oil. Look out. That is all she needs. of United States 1954. You say, "What is it? It's the devil." The invasion is on. It is unclean spirits that are possessing the people. The the invasion of the United States. The church is overthrown by the devil. Please, he said, "Oh God, send us some oldfashioned men, who doesn't know it from me that knows the power of his resurrection, who will preach repentance and men and women to come to the altar who love Jesus." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's the kind of men we need right now. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said what this people before they preach every old thing besides repentance and sin and the old rugged cross. When you lay down the facts down, the people come to hear you in the service. You're trying to preach the gospel and get people repenting and they don't want to hear it. But brethren, they are going to have to repent or perish. Listen to brother. God, let me preach like never before. [Music] Let me preach to dying men as a dying man myself. Let me preach to people like I never have another sermon to preach. Let me persuade them. come to the altar to be like Christian to live in the neighborhood and stop blowing up at this. That's the devil. That's demon spirits upon Christian. Prophet talk about demon spirits upon Christian. We want to be real Christian. Oh, give the Lord some praise God. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be seated. Everything is in order. Remember before the rain fell, Noah was in the ark, before the fire fell, Lot was out of Sodom. Listen. And I think that the angel of destruction is holding the hand of Russia with the atomic bombs until the church comes together as one great body of Christ. There is going to be a unity of the faith. Oh, glory to God. There is going to be a bright revival. Seven thunders is the bright revival. And Africa, Africa, you're going to have it. You're going to have revival. God said so. God said so. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. You may be seated. After this article came out. I read this on a Sunday. The next day there is a report from Russia where one person said Russia is the only country that can reduce America to atomic ashes. God has now positionally placed Russia. You're not hearing me. You're not hearing me. Put Russia in his place. He's going to put you. [Applause] Oh, that's your place. God bless please in Christ the bless adoption time adoption glory hallelujah [Music] you will be seated praise God praise God you will be seated from the baptism of the Holy Spirit he says again getting wicked and wicked he said we are living in a is till the people are born with evil spirits and the whole thing become a conglomeration of sin and that's the reason we are in the day and that's the reason Russia is playing exactly in the hands of God God is using communism and communism will destroy the entire thing. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be seated. And the reason they some serpent seed the reason God has raised up Russia with the atomic bomb. to wipe her off like the like the flood. The Bible said Russia an atheistic country is playing in the hands of Almighty God. Just like King Nebuchadnezzar was to destroy Israel because they failed to walk with God. They failed to walk with God. And brother had seven visions in 1933. Seven visions set vision which he said must come to pass. Before the coming of the Lord and the seventh vision, there was destruction over America. The end is here. The end has come. Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet before that day. Elast has already come. Elast has already come. You are here. You are the [Applause] praise. Glory to God. You may be seated. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, praise God. Blessed be of the Lord. Brother Brandon, from recognizing today's message, Russia, Russia only receive a place in the world in science. No more than 40 years ago, the First World War, they ignore Russia. some big old Siberian with beard all all over the face. But Russia has recognized a place. She has to do it to fulfill scriptures. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Notice man has the same six senses 6,000 years ago. Man has come. He said man has come from horse and buggy to astronaut because he turned away from faith. He he trust himself. Notice Russia come to herself and at the same time the bride has recognized the evening light. Just begin to recognize. The world has recognized. The nation has recognized. Science has recognized. The devil has recognized. It's time he can wreck [Music] women. Watch this. Watch this. The devil has recognized that he could wreck the church, wreck the people. And God has recognized that there's a people on the earth that he has predestinated to life. He recognized this is the time to send his message. What's the message? What's the message? He is not dead. He is raised from the dead. Go tell my disciples the dynamics is here. Oh, glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Here we go. Are you ready? Amen. Amen. Brother, I'm going to say something. National force put Israel in a homeland. National force will put the church in the world council of churches. The power of God will put the people in the fire. The power of that means we have got to connect with the power of God. to the jail. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. God praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because here why she would recognize her position in the word. Hold it. Hold it. You mean I recognize my position in the word? [Applause] Hold it. 8 minutes. 8 minutes. The church members only go to church and follow pastors and follow churches. But the bride, she connects with her [Applause] husband and he is the way. The husband will tell you follow me. You are not following a man. You are following the unfailing body of the son of man. Oh, can we give the Lord some praise? Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Glory to God. You want me seated? So the bride would recognize her position in the world. Jesus help us to find his position in the word. He found the scripture. The spirit is upon me. John found the scripture. I am the voice of God in the wilderness. You have got to find. And when you find your strength, no man can take you up. No man can [ __ ] you up. You found [Applause] your seated. In other words, right now you may appreciate Somebody calling you out, acknowledging you, shaking your hand. Somebody tell you your testimony is good or your preaching is great or your special is such a blessing. But when you find your place, you don't need that. [Applause] You don't need man's approval. This is my beloved son. You don't need mine's approval. You are God's son. George's daughter, the devil can't do anything [Applause] about Glory to God. You are glad at you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are free. You are free. You are free. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. [Applause] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Oh glory. Hallelujah. Oh glory. Hallelujah. Brother, now watch. He promised to send you heavenly light. Listen to ripen the word seed sown for this day. Sit down a minute. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. In other words, son of man was to bring seed because son of man is the swer of the seed. That seed must come [Music] mature. That seed must get right. You you have to get a revelation that you are a corner. You are not shocked. You are not shocked. [Applause] Listen, listen. The church can't take the word. The church wants emotions. The bride takes the word because the bride have a revelation and the word is God and God is the word. [Applause] What's the secret? What said what's the secret? The word is in the bread. So God put the seed word Christ the pyramid in you in word form. All the potential all the power all the glory is in the way. [Applause] Hallelujah. You may be seated. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be seated. That is why the devil job was to try to disconnect the bride from the word and bringing men's ideas, men's interpretation. Dumb. Men's opinion opinion dumb. You may be seated. So if you are the bride, you can take rebuke. You can take instruction. You can take correction. You can take every mystery. Take seven thunder. You can take place of trial. You can take Calvary. You can take the cross. Give the Lord some praises. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] All that was in God, he poured into Christ. The spirit. The spirit became word. And the word became flesh. And the word went to Calvary and say it's finished. It's finished. It's finished. You are going to be sealed. You are going to be f [Applause] So brother, he promised in the last day in the evening time, listen, the sun would come out to ripen that seed. Hold it now. So now we have son of man. Now we have seed. Now we have son of God, spirit to ripen seed. So if dynamics, if dynamics, if dynamic comes and you don't have the seed, you're going to [Music] get that will be going back to Pentecost. We don't want that. We don't want that. [Applause] So all the seven thunder bright promises had to come into you for you to come to this [Applause] day. This day. today that Jesus could say except fall into the ground and die you are going to [Applause] die. Oh glory. He said the seventh seal. Remember is the end of all things. It is the end. It is the end of struggling world. It is the end of struggling nature. It is the end of the trumpet. It is the end of the vials. It is the end of the earth. It even ends time. shall be known. The seventh seal right now. We are under the seventh seal. And the angel of the Lord is on the earth pulling back the war, back the wind, pulling back everything for you. [Applause] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah brotherham. Praise the name of the Lord. Watch age. Now in a moment he said the false vine came to full fruction in the her fruit would mature and ripen that evilspirited church full of iniquity. And if this is true, then it must also be true that the bright church will mature. [Applause] Brother Brham is defining this season and time that the bride church with mature and here we go. Her rightness will be an identification with her Lord. by means of the word. So when you can be identified with the word, it proves you are right. [Applause] Listen, listen. friend or no friend, [Applause] [Music] you will have to leave churches. You will have to [Music] leave for the word's sake. The word is your friend. The word is your husband. The word is good. Don't let no one cut you off from that [Applause] way. You may be seated. Brother, this is from God's provided place of worship. He said, "No matter how well we are taught, here we go now. How well we believe, how much of the Bible we say is true, it's got to be the dynamics have got to be there to set that word on fire and start it rolling." So we have the word. We have the truth. We believe the word. And it takes dynamics to get that word rolling. Watch. That's what the matter with the church today. We are lacking the dynamical power to press this word and make it live for the day. Steve Martin Luther Martin Luther at mechanics and dynamics John Wesley John Wesley at mechanics and dynamics what about our day the church should be fully grown the church should be fully grown ready to go and meet Christ with the manifestation of every blessing operating in that one body. Oh, glory to God. Are you with me? Let's go a little further. The Holy Ghost will always point to the word. [Music] Here we go. He died to confirm that word and make that word positive. positive. He died that he could come himself into the world. So God is not looking to use men to use the word in men. So God has to put the word in the man. Thank God the word in the man. Then the voice of the charity the spirit the spirit drops down the man speaks from the [Applause] throne. No more man coming down using his own words. Oh God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] Now what? He is the dynamics of the mechanics. The mechanics of the church. What is it? Apostles, prophets, prophets, teachers. He is the dynamics that works that. Now watch. Now watch this. Listen carefully. Pastor is the word. You can read it in Ephesians 4. Evangelist is the word. You could read it in the Bible. Therefore, we have to connect with our word. Ephesians 4, everything that made fresh. [Applause] In other words, and go to them, the pastor, the pastor, the apostle, the teacher, the doctor, the evangelist, the evangelist, they become one with the world. Then they as it become a channel to release God. No longer amen. No longer. Amen. The word itself amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Now, Jesus, sit down a minute, make a little greeter. Jesus made a powerful statement in St. John 15:7. He said, "If he abide in me and my words abide in you, you can ask whatever you want and it shall it shall [Music] it." Hallelujah. Jesus, you will be seated. He said, "I am the vine and I need fruit." The vine don't bear the fruit. The branch is the fruit. He said, "I am the vine. You are the branch. The man don't make babies. Women make babies. So Jesus [Applause] prayed. He call you to be his wife. to produce Messiah. [Applause] Notice he put a condition upon asking and that condition is abiding. Abiding is not in today and out tomorrow. To abide is to stay to remain to stay focused focus not looking to the left not looking to the right. You are staying the course focus. Your eyes towards Jerusalem. Your eyes towards the cross, your eyes towards Calvary. See no man but Jesus. You may be seated. We're going good. Time is good. You see five. Let me just minutes. Listen to brother Brandham speaking about Moses. You see you see Peter denied Christ and that might look bad. He he cursed but he was the right man with wrong behavior. [Applause] So, so you are the right man. Your behavior may not [Applause] be the right man. You are the right [Applause] son. The devil is a liar. The devil is a liar. You are going to be free. [Applause] You may be seated. So don't you feel condemned. Don't let the devil torment your mind because this happened in your life that happened in your life is why Jesus died. [Applause] Jesus Jesus died that the blood that his blood could speak on your [Applause] behalf. Jesus tells the father, "I die for them. I pay the price for them. Listen, listen. Under the blood, God doesn't even see your sins. Under the blood, God doesn't even see your mistakes. When he looks at you [Applause] deliver blood of blood sprinkle sprinkle sprinkle upon [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] When you understand that by revelation there is nothing against you. [Applause] Understand this. We we stand justified. Justified. And brother Brandham brought out the hidden mystery of justification. And the mystery of justification is you never did it. [Applause] You are so free. Your sins trapped in the sea of forgetful can't remember it. God is too big to remember. You remember what you did? So big. So great. He can't [Applause] forget. Remember the season but I'm talking about Moses. He said although his mother had thoroughly instruct him on what to do what he would do and God raised him up all this knowledge as good as it is yet it had to be set off because that was only mechanics. So Moses Moses knowledge of being a special child. His knowledge of being born to be a deliverer. His knowledge of his calling couldn't do it. All of that was [Music] mechanics. But one day fire Fire. [Applause] We talk about a cell phone. They could buy a cell phone. They could put in the SIM card. If it's noted, it will not work. It could be the best phone, but it has to be activated. It could be the most expensive phone and you you have to be activated. That's what the dynamics is for. activate you. Call your father. If he me and my ways are you are activated, you can call on glory. It's going to be healed. The pride is going to see the people is going to walk. You are activated. [Applause] I [Applause] release. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Applause] You may be [Applause] [Applause] seated. Heat. [Applause] Heat. [Music] Listen from world falling apart. Brother Brandham, he said we see nations, Israel awaken. We see the mechanical thing taking place. Now, here we go. The spirit, the dynamics from his word to get into his church and drive them to Calvary, then to the rapture. The spirit has to come to drive us to Calvary. Now listen, we are going somewhere. We on our way to the resurrection. We on our way to the rapture, but we have some steps to make. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. We have some to make. This is one stop. Calvary. [Applause] Jesus. When these Greeks came to Jesus, they said, "Sir, we would see Jesus. We want to see him. Where is he? I want to see him. Show him. Show him to me." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Show him to me. And when they brought Jesus, When they brought these Greeks, the disciples didn't call him aside Greeks aside. Explain this to them. Explain that to them. The disciples, the true disciples brought those men straight to Jesus. Yeah. He is the way and Jesus the first thing he said to them except we fall into the ground and die. In other words, you can't see me this way. You got to go to the cross. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. You may be seated. We know there are three stages of the Christian walk at the cross. On the cross. And the third one is when the cross is on your back. Hallelujah. You come to Christ, you come at the cross. But then he just has to put you on the cross. Let them laugh. Let them talk. Let them criticize. You are on the cross. Father, forgive them. Father, you are dying to your sins. You are dying to the world. You are dying and Christ is coming to life. Glory to God. No man will get glory glory that belongs to God. Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. No flesh to get glory. It's a death. It's a real death to come to that third step to carry the cross on your back. And Jesus told Peter, he said, "When you're young, you do what you want to do. You go where you want to go. You're doing your own thing. Come on. I can't do that no [Applause] more. [Applause] Has that hour arrived? Has the hour arrived where we are understanding? We can no longer do our own thing. You You can't be a [Music] freethinker because the a free thinker. Okay. Because when the simstress cutting the dress, the sim to cut the dress she cuts it according to a pattern. What remain is the free thinking. So you have to be cut according to pattern. Your life is not your life. Your life become his life. His life begins to live through you. [Applause] Paul said death to me and life to the church, life to the body. Death I am dying and the church is coming to life. The ministers has got to die. Yeah. Going forward it'll be different. If we have to move into this great ministry, it will prove to be costly. It's more than a title of pastor or call card evangelist. It's a little more than that. It's if we're going to follow him all the way. The dynamics is to drive us there. [Music] It's to push us there. Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. So, here we go. God has to reveal to you that you are a corner wheat. Isn't that right? than you revelation. Understand that you have to die to produce life to go forward. progressive genuine. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Brother call it a total separation, not partial, a total separation from from unbelief. Now watch, we are not to go back in the world no more, but to cleave to God. He said Jesus is coming after a bride, a woman, a church that is separated from the children of the world. She is separated from the fashions of this mother of God. She is separated listen from the cares and tradition of the churches. [Music] [Applause] That church do it this way. We have nothing to do with that. We want the way. [Applause] Yes, they're doing it that way. That's tradition. We are busting tradition. Breaking men's [Applause] ide fallen. Oh, glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Here we go. As husband and wife is one, so does the bride and the word becomes one. Here we go. For the word is living through the bread. That's her credential. That's identification. Holy identification said the word living in the bride is her identification. Well, brother, are you identify with this brother? That's not what the prophet said. To identify withdification. Amen. I didn't come from Trinidad. I come from heaven. You are not from Ivory Co. from Ghana. From Nigeria. No. No. Your dust is from [Applause] here. You come from Ghana. You going back to God. at you. [Applause] [Music] Yes, brother. A separation. Watch this. from everything, anything, from church, from community, from a belief, from family, anything that would stand between you and leaving the entire word of God. If your soul not punctuate, every promise with of this God with an Amen. There is something wrong. Glory to God. So as the bride, every word is amen. Notice you're not bringing an interpretation to you. The word will interpret itself. The manifestation will be the interpretation. your word the Bible interpret itself. Now watch the churches build so much systems around the world. Watch it is back to the word back to the life system doesn't have life. It's only the word that has life. Systems are built around the word. System. The word have life. No man deceive you. We don't belong to a system. We belong to the capstone. We belong to Jesus. We are wife of the lamb. Okay, okay. Let me get a home sh message. So we receive Jesus talking about the disciples of old brought the seekers, the believers or the people. He brought them into the presence of Jesus, into the presence of some organization or doctrine, but bringing them into the presence of Christ. Hear what says, not bringing the people to some doctrine, bringing the people into presence. [Applause] That is genuine disciples. That is genuine fivefold, genuine ministers. Bring the people into presence. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Watch Brother said, "It takes a humble heart dedicated to God to bring Jesus Christ into present tense. Listen, listen. Listen again. It takes a humble heart, not a big head. A humble heart, not a big head full of [Applause] knowledge. That's what Goliath had a big head. And David only had a rock, a revelation. He was excited about he ran to meet Goliath. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I am so excited because dynamics is going to fall. [Applause] You find Christ in death, not in a manger, not in a confession. A true servant takes you to him and he is the word. And then brother Brandham if Christ is on earth today a real servant take him to Christ. He said Christ is here in the form of the word and the word brings life. No he is the word. He is this Bible made living. And when you die to yourself, like Christ, like the corner wheat, then the word lives in you and brings forth the same results it did in the living God. The same results we will have when we die. Same result, same miracle, same power, same witness, same angel. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When we die, listen. This means that you have no enemy out there. There is no enemy church or enemy group. Jesus told you, whatever you do, do it quickly. It won't stop nothing. Oh, hallelujah. You understand what I'm saying? The hour has come for you to focus on your life. Focus on your work according with what that one is doing. That one is doing. God will vindicate you as his sons and daughters. [Applause] I'm about to close. He's talking about rising of the sun. Talking about a son of man is to be wave over the people. He said, "Who is the son of man?" In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. Watch four. The word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man and the son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit giving us life as Christ was the first one to raise. He was the first fruits of those that [Music] slept in the bride. It is to be a sheath waved again. Waving of the sheath. What was the sheath? The first one that come to mature. The first one that proved it was a wheat. So William Brham, he was the first one that was mature and God adopted him and he waved the message over uses sons mature sons going to become right. I believe on the earth today genuine corner ready. Listen to this prophecy. And the first time that there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of darkness. resurrection. Listen to the prophecy will be a message that the full maturity of the word stand back in its full power and is being waved over the people by the same signs, same wonders he did back there. Oh, praise God. You love him. You may be seated. I want to close off with this. This was spoken by brother Coleman the 20th of June we received 2004 for a message Elohim returning the power in this time of life. He was saying it takes a live voice brotherly kindness opens the door to charity. [Music] But you must live the word first. You must live with the word first. Now you know how to bind the devil because the elm revelation has exposed that religious spirit. The religious spirit will tell you what they did to you. I ain't do nothing. They have got to repent. That's a religious spirit. But you know better now you have got to do what? What they did to you? What that sister did to you? You forgive him. You forgive her. Otherwise, your heavenly father cannot forgive you. So therefore, you know how to bind the devil because he gets in here gets everybody hateful. So what does that do? That takes a debt. There we go. Listen carefully to know that you are [Music] right and the person is wrong and you forgive them anyway. That's a debt. You are right. They are wrong and you forgive them. That's a test. Now when you do that, you then understand what God wants you to do in Job 38. I hate myself and repent in dust and ashes. What is that? That's a horrenance of good self. not bad self because you're supposed to be a Christian. You're not even supposed to have a bad self. Now, Elohim revelation or Elohim inspiration is to let you know, who God is, who Satan is, and a secret revelation. How to get good self out of the way. I am not talking about bad self. I'm talking about you. You who pay your ti. You who shout. You who worship. I'm talking about you minister. You deacon. You elder, you song leader, you song man, you musician. I'm talking about you. I'm not talking about fornication. I'm not talking about adultery. I'm not talking about smoking. That's not even Christian. I'm talking about ministers, elders doing good deeds. You have got to die to good self. Oh glory. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Glory to God. God God is not interested in you parading around with good self. So you're a me own up like Jacob. I am Jacob. I'm no good. I need to wrestle with the angel. [Music] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Glory to God. Hallelujah. So friends, I'm done. God hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are not shocked. You are seed. The life of the plant went through the stalk went through the shock up in the seed. All the life. There's no God up in you because you are that seed. You are going to die. May the Lord bless you.
