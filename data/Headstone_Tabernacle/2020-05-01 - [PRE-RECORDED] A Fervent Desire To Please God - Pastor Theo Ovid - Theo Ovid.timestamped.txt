[5:32] [Music]
[5:33] [Applause]
[5:42] hallelujahs so we want to go straight
[5:44] into the wood this morning as we want to
[5:47] turn our Bibles to sin John chapter 8
[5:50] Romans chapter 8 and Hebrews chapter 11
[5:55] verse scripture reading this morning we
[5:57] greet you in the name of Jesus it's
[5:59] always a blessing to come to church
[6:01] always a blessing to be in a position to
[6:05] have here the would have God greetings
[6:08] to those connected us on the Internet
[6:10] may God richly bless you and a whole
[6:13] soul and family wherever you are
[6:15] wherever at sea it would be played that
[6:17] at the Eddy fire and strength meter and
[6:20] this toughened our core that we live in
[6:22] him amen
[6:25] so you want to go to Saint John chapter
[6:27] 8 two verses there verse 28 and 29
[6:42] then said Jesus unto them when he have
[6:44] lifted up the Son of man then shall he
[6:47] know that I am he and I do nothing of
[6:52] myself but as my father had taught me I
[6:56] speak these things and he that sent me
[7:01] is with me the father had not left me
[7:04] alone for I do always those things that
[7:09] please him Romans chapter 8 we want to
[7:14] read verse 1 and then we want to go from
[7:16] 5 to 8 Romans chapter 8
[7:38] there's therefore now no condemnation to
[7:42] them which are in Christ Jesus who walk
[7:46] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[7:49] let's go on to verse 5 for the data
[7:54] after the flesh do mind the things of
[7:57] the flesh but they that are after the
[8:01] spirit the things of the Spirit for to
[8:07] be carnally my name is death but to be
[8:10] spiritually minded is life and peace
[8:14] because the carnal mind is enmity
[8:17] against God for it is not subject to the
[8:22] law of God neither indeed can be so then
[8:27] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[8:32] God within Hebrews chapter 11 two verses
[8:37] there verse five and six
[8:45] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[8:48] should not see death and was not found
[8:51] because God had translated him for
[8:56] before his translation he had this
[8:59] testimony that he pleased God I would
[9:03] all feel it is impossible to please him
[9:06] for he that cometh to God must believe
[9:10] that he is and that has it that he is a
[9:14] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[9:17] Him
[9:19] let's bajas forward a prayer father
[9:23] receive us tonight and the buns of
[9:25] Calvary die son we renounce all knives
[9:29] and all that we are we renounce it to be
[9:33] nothing we would not even breathe
[9:36] without you
[9:37] the beating of our hearts the pumping
[9:40] our lungs we will be nothing we would
[9:43] not have come to this world without you
[9:44] Father
[9:45] we are confessing that we have
[9:47] mistreated you and when we see what you
[9:50] have done for us we ashamed of our lives
[9:53] we are shame of ourselves of our small
[9:57] faith forgive us now Lord and help us
[10:00] this morning and minister to us by your
[10:03] word take me out of the way hide them
[10:06] behind Calvary's cross and may you be
[10:08] glorified in all what we see undo this
[10:10] day in Jesus name we ask it amen and
[10:14] amen god bless you you may be seated
[10:16] praise the name of the Lord blessed be
[10:20] the name of the Lord we believe that
[10:25] prayer changes things
[10:28] hallelujah so if bread changes things
[10:30] keep on praying but a brown say all
[10:42] Christianity all that you are all that
[10:50] you ever will be is based upon feet in
[10:54] the world I think that statement would
[10:58] repeat all you are all you ever will be
[11:04] is based upon feet in the word I can't
[11:11] put my feet on nothing else if I was
[11:15] gonna put my feet on a church what
[11:17] church will it be he said now where
[11:20] could I put it on I don't know they're
[11:22] all scooping up on everything else
[11:24] twist lines and everything else but when
[11:26] I put my feet in this world it is uncut
[11:30] you put your faith and flesh and blood
[11:32] at my fail at my fall it's my crash but
[11:37] when you put your faith in the word
[11:38] there's no way that could fail because
[11:41] the word is God and people don't really
[11:45] believe that but the word really is God
[11:48] hallelujah didn't either
[11:50] he sends his word and create just like
[11:53] that he said let there be and it was
[11:55] because he spoke it man could speak
[11:58] whatever they want to speak but when God
[12:00] speaks that would can't fail
[12:02] it is so positive he said my word shall
[12:06] not return unto you boy return to me
[12:09] void but it shall accomplish a purpose I
[12:10] send it for to accomplish Oh glory to
[12:14] God so we are required to have faith and
[12:16] faith is that Foundation and fit is a
[12:19] revelation and revelation comes from God
[12:21] that's what Jesus told Peter flesh and
[12:23] blood hath not revealed it unto you but
[12:25] my father had written to you and upon
[12:28] this rock I will build my
[12:29] Church and that's the first place to use
[12:31] the word church hallelujah and that rock
[12:34] was the rock of Revelation it wasn't big
[12:37] stone and concrete and Dylan and blocks
[12:39] it was the rock of Revelation and that
[12:41] rocks to trollee ages men died without
[12:44] Rock men meant the fiery furnace in that
[12:47] rock the tourneys under with that rock
[12:49] but that rock held because the gates of
[12:52] hell can't reveal again somebody with
[12:55] divine revelation I don't care what
[12:57] condition you in God said so the case of
[13:01] hell just cannot prevail against
[13:03] somebody with divine revelation I don't
[13:06] care what happened with your wife I
[13:07] don't care what happened with your
[13:08] husband I don't care what happened your
[13:10] job I don't get more with your house
[13:12] with your cup the gates of Hell cannot
[13:14] prevail come on say Amen somebody
[13:17] Joe lost his wife Joe Costas don't lost
[13:20] that he was his children rather he lost
[13:22] his hell and it stays put
[13:24] come on same as somebody Jesus said
[13:27] destroy this body and she does I will
[13:29] raise it up myself
[13:31] praise God because the word said I will
[13:34] not suffer my Holy One to see corruption
[13:36] no leave his soul in hell and Jesus had
[13:39] confidence in the word that if they
[13:41] destroy the body got to raise it up
[13:45] hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of
[13:48] the Lord are you with me all glory Lord
[13:51] amen sorry
[13:53] that's so excited I forget title
[13:55] everything just in the scriptures but a
[13:58] title is a final of a three-part message
[14:01] series the full fun desire to please God
[14:04] that's the title I have tonight it's
[14:06] treating the passions another word
[14:07] behind that we had that the cries get in
[14:10] the spirit and this morning to conclude
[14:12] the full fun desire to please God have
[14:15] an inspiration this is my beloved Son in
[14:17] whom I am well pleased
[14:19] who blessed be the name of the Lord
[14:23] hallelujah oh praise God where is my
[14:27] contact scripture or our context
[14:33] scripture is from Matthew dr. Fannin
[14:34] I'll read it it's on Matthew chapter 21
[14:36] and it reads thus a certain man had two
[14:39] sons Matthew 21 was twenty-eight to
[14:45] treat you a certain man had two sons and
[14:48] he this is Jesus this is an ER and Jesus
[14:51] is speaking his parable and he came to
[14:52] the first and said son go work today in
[14:56] my Vanya and he answered and said I will
[15:00] not but afterward he repented and went
[15:06] he came to the second and said likewise
[15:09] and he answered I will go sir and went
[15:13] not whether of them Twain that the
[15:17] father did the will of the Father they
[15:20] said unto him the first jesus said unto
[15:24] them verily I say unto you that the
[15:26] publicans and the harlots go into the
[15:29] kingdom of God before you
[15:34] it's a very simple parable that's why
[15:36] you have to go back in the Bible that's
[15:39] why you go back in the scriptures he
[15:40] went to one son on one son he said I'll
[15:43] read again
[15:44] he said he tell the son going today and
[15:49] work in my Vanya the son said I will not
[15:52] but repented and went second son he said
[15:57] I will go sir and went not whether of
[16:01] them did the will of the Father the
[16:03] first one
[16:04] so Jesus bust them out right he tell
[16:07] them and say unto you that the publicans
[16:09] and the harlots go into the kingdom of
[16:12] God before you because not that who
[16:15] mount say they will is the who they who
[16:18] do his will
[16:19] so God's objective is to get the job
[16:23] done or could we get a shout in the
[16:26] house all this talk talk warming up
[16:29] church benches that is nothing if you're
[16:32] talking tend to act upon what God said
[16:38] hallelujah marvellous iguanas to talk
[16:41] about the scripture Jesus what if anyone
[16:43] come after me let him deny himself I
[16:46] kind of like that yes if any man waitin
[16:49] on me you know he say if any man come
[16:51] after me say coming after he's moving
[16:53] he's coming after him he say but little
[16:55] did not sell pick up your cross and
[16:57] follow then he made an astonishing
[16:59] statement my sheep knows my voice and
[17:05] they follow me
[17:07] hallelujah so a she can get stumbled by
[17:10] the word the word is God the word is
[17:14] Jesus so if Jesus leaving you this way
[17:18] you would follow because my sheep hear
[17:21] my voice a stranger they will not follow
[17:24] they're going to follow the word because
[17:27] you are part of the wood that is wide my
[17:30] god that's why you're gonna follow the
[17:33] word that's why the devil could only
[17:35] give you so much and no more come on now
[17:38] because when that word said again like a
[17:41] baby that is a commode you're pregnant
[17:43] with the word when the way that'll come
[17:46] other would have to come out haul it
[17:48] back no more doctor break out I feel
[17:51] tonight I feel this morning that we're
[17:54] going to break out in your life
[17:56] oh god you're struggling struggling
[17:58] struggling but one day the woodland to
[18:00] break oh so it's not those that say I
[18:08] will and then the dust they do not his
[18:11] doors that could say I do I will not and
[18:12] come and do hallelujah do the will of
[18:16] the Father
[18:16] I always do that come on now doing
[18:20] something going after him blessed not
[18:22] citizens here in pressing towards the
[18:25] kingdom of God there's always something
[18:28] for you to do to do not to talk to do

[20:41] he does not suffered in the flesh had
[20:42] ceased from sin that he no longer should
[20:45] live the rest of his time in the flesh

[21:34] whosoever has suffered in the flesh
[21:36] having a mind of Christ is done with
[21:39] intentional sin has stopped pleasing
[21:43] himself and the world and pleases God

[30:21] rapture right whatever the rapture what
[30:23] ron [ __ ] on rapture but there's no
[30:26] way to interrupt you the Bible said
[30:29] Enoch walk with God but before he was
[30:34] trying to leave
[30:35] he had testimony
[30:40] what was his testimony where I was
[30:43] reading a quote and it's all real good
[30:47] to my heart and I bless my soul
[30:51] we had that for years that was not in ox
[30:55] testimony he knocks testimony that he
[30:59] pleased God I without feet you can't
[31:05] please him
[31:06] so those that econo those that are
[31:10] natural those that are in the flesh
[31:12] cannot please God because the flesh is
[31:17] warring against the spirit so that's why

[38:58] of floated there is no water to float it
[39:01] you do
[39:02] something that's so unusual something
[39:04] paradoxical nobody could explain why you
[39:07] are where you are oh you are oh you are
[39:10] you can't even explain you you can't
[39:12] explain how you in this service today
[39:14] you but you've made it i but i told me
[39:18] something he doesn't even know what
[39:19] keeping him but something keep telling
[39:21] him keep on keep pressing on keep
[39:23] pressing on many times you to give up
[39:25] you don't even know what keeping him
[39:27] it's not you keeping god it's God has
[39:29] been keeping you that's why you should
[39:32] shout inside of here that's why that's
[39:34] why you oughta worship
[39:37] you never open them up before open your
[39:40] mountain can cut the praises
[39:48] prism maybe a gray hair might turn back
[39:52] black press em maybe like you my
[39:55] Maggie's our prayers now maybe you're
[39:58] gonna be here but give called your
[40:01] praises because he deserves it
[40:05] [Applause]
[40:30] [Applause]
[40:34] here are some people love the fish
[40:37] mysteries some people if you I'm against
[40:40] mysteries I'm not I am a mystery if I'm
[40:45] against miss Jam against myself
[40:46] our mystery a live-in mystery
[40:49] you are mystery to your mystery in Goa
[40:52] but sometimes their life is so
[40:53] mysterious you wonder what kind of
[40:55] machine
[40:55] they were the unfolding because she
[40:57] after we hear all the mysteries we still
[41:00] have to live something ball handlers
[41:03] already do I know all mysteries do I
[41:06] have know all knowledge if I don't
[41:09] cannot any space where it could be
[41:10] manifested I am zero so that is why we
[41:14] have to get all the world history
[41:16] teaching revelation inspiration
[41:18] exhortation fire whatever it is you need
[41:21] all of it using the full package I can't
[41:24] give all of it that's why the different
[41:25] gifts and so on isn't that right and
[41:28] that's why kids come to edify Billups
[41:30] rent in the church the the fivefold
[41:32] ministry or the ministry of ministering
[41:34] and so on is not for the glorification
[41:35] of ministers it's for the perfecting of
[41:40] the scenes so when it comes to ministers
[41:43] war/battle passed away passed about a
[41:44] convention war convention battle is
[41:45] foolishness that's nonsense
[41:48] it's not that because first for the
[41:51] Gospels to bring Christ living in you
[41:54] the customer lists that become the wood
[41:56] burns in the hole from Genesis to
[41:58] Revelation to be summed up in three
[41:59] words three words would need flesh not
[42:05] would meet more would word made flesh
[42:09] and ticket a Kentucky Fried Chicken I'll
[42:12] buy some chicken fare as you would mean
[42:14] flesh what miss fest comes alive
[42:17] have no fellowship run with that it have
[42:19] a life with it thunders them all the
[42:23] time the Pharisees doing their own stuff
[42:24] right when she has come on the scene he
[42:26] was the world spirit hit him and then
[42:29] drive him into the wilderness to get
[42:31] pain before pleasure but I will preach
[42:34] pain before blessing we like pleasure
[42:38] first and then we cap in after
[42:40] hallelujah but God program is a
[42:42] difference he have this suffering Eman
[42:45] that produced character which which
[42:48] which which she called the process of
[42:50] character development which people don't
[42:52] like to hear hallelujah so when Jesus
[42:55] the spirit struck him he was truly led
[42:58] by the spirit into the wilderness to
[43:01] deal with the devil by the word now what
[43:06] if Jesus were getting wasn't in the
[43:08] world between instructor Satan the devil
[43:11] make a spinner on him but he knew the
[43:13] world so when they never bring words
[43:15] it's also written don't come with that
[43:17] don't try that I'm on say my somebody
[43:20] you can't fool me with that you got
[43:22] caught that alone bring something else
[43:24] with that coat come on say my somebody

[43:29] Loreena chorus when our man is in the
[43:32] word nobody could fool that man come on
[43:35] say man somebody
[43:37] the typing law on Scripture hidden
[43:39] mystery for that man
[43:40] even did the hidden altar the devil in
[43:43] that mystery I assure you there will be
[43:44] a hidden mystery that's not in the word
[43:46] because the Prophet and the spirit and
[43:47] the bride will say the same thing and
[43:50] this much is important and what they say
[43:52] will have already been said in the word
[43:55] you can't make a mistake with that
[43:58] that's just share the Lord will give the
[44:00] Lord a shout of praise you could judge
[44:03] me by the word you to judge me by the
[44:05] message you could just what I preached
[44:07] by what you're reading the books come on
[44:09] give the Lord a show that's why we
[44:12] called the way we cook Oh hallelujah
[44:14] because the Prophet brought us here the
[44:16] Lord he brought Spirit spoken world and
[44:18] if we echo back those words if we speak
[44:21] those words and those would come into
[44:22] you and some alive into you that devil
[44:24] is finished

[54:02] it goes small holy little and what's
[54:03] that a call Samuel and I'll do something

[54:18] what effect it doesn't matter you know
[54:19] people feel all my the field God has
[54:22] some booties grandfather he is not squad
[54:28] oh let me continue whoa so since Christ
[54:33] suffered in the flesh for us I was going
[54:34] in amplified arm yourselves with the
[54:36] same thought and put my patiently to all
[54:39] suffer rather than to fall feel the
[54:40] please God for whosoever hath suffered
[54:43] in the flesh having the mind of Christ
[54:45] is done with intentional sin has stopped
[54:48] pleasing himself on the world and
[54:49] pleases God so that he no longer live
[54:53] spend the rest of his natural life
[54:54] living his human appetites and desires
[54:58] but he lives for what God wills oh do
[55:03] you love him Oh blessed be the name of
[55:05] the Lord Romans 15 one listen to the
[55:08] scripture we then that are strong ought
[55:13] to bear the infirmities of the weak and
[55:16] not to please ourselves
[55:22] what are we little again
[55:23] Romans 15 1 we then that are strong
[55:27] ought to be R in other words you are
[55:31] fine you bless you have this you have
[55:34] that but you ain't key about nobody else
[55:36] that naughty scriptures descriptors are
[55:39] we that are strong ought to bear the
[55:41] infirmities of the weak are not to
[55:44] please ourselves
[55:46] so all this gospel is coming to strip
[55:48] self self out that Christ could really
[55:54] come in and Christ serves Christ gives
[55:58] Christ delivers Christ restores Christ
[56:03] reconciles Christ heals that's what
[56:07] Christ does but self defense protect I
[56:10] know everything else but that's not
[56:13] Christ Oh blessed be the name of the
[56:15] Lord could we continue now how can you
[56:17] please someone if you don't know what
[56:20] pleases them tinnitus many rubbish and
[56:23] come to passion to know his word so if
[56:26] I'm not in the word you are not yet
[56:28] interested in really pleasing God my and
[56:33] that brings us the cry to get in this
[56:36] spirit because Brown says the Christ
[56:38] mission of God reveal the Holy Ghost
[56:39] alone is the revealer of the divine
[56:43] revelation of Christ isn't that right
[56:45] and this is what I was given to see to
[56:47] you today the people that day has made
[56:50] gods in their own image and likeness
[56:55] what did think he is it's a god of their
[57:00] own invention a God made with the hands
[57:04] of their imagination a God of their own
[57:08] choosing not a God of the world so
[57:12] because of that they could see anything
[57:15] do anything live any way they want and
[57:19] it's okay there in the message what
[57:22] message is that
[57:24] that they claim is not did not they
[57:27] don't know the Scriptures don't form
[57:30] your own gods and make that think you
[57:34] are right because that God is according
[57:35] to the deeds of your own heart
[57:37] so because you think that is God you do
[57:42] what you want live how you want and
[57:44] think that is okay it is not God is a
[57:48] word of the word so all of us Minister
[57:52] elder Deacon trustee whoever have to
[57:54] subject ourselves to this wood because
[57:57] the word itself is God listen to what
[58:00] Jeremiah in Jeremiah chapter 7 verse 23
[58:03] let me read this what God said but this
[58:06] thing I commanded I am seeing this is
[58:09] God speaking
[58:10] JAMA 720 or be my voice and I will be
[58:14] your God ye shall be my people and
[58:18] walkie in all the ways that I have
[58:20] commanded you that it may be well unto
[58:23] you but they had not not incline their
[58:27] air but walked in the consul's
[58:31] and the imagination of the evil heart
[58:33] and went backward and not forward since
[58:38] the day that your fathers came out of
[58:40] the land of Egypt unto this day
[58:42] I have even sent unto you all my
[58:45] servants the prophets daily rising up
[58:48] early and sending them yet they had not
[58:51] under me not in kindly air but harden
[58:54] their neck they did worse than their
[58:57] fathers therefore thou shalt speak all
[58:59] these words unto them but they will not
[59:02] happen to thee thou shalt also call unto
[59:05] them and they will not answer thee but
[59:07] thou shalt say unto them this is a
[59:10] nation that albeit not the voice of the
[59:13] Lord their God nor receive it correction
[59:16] truth is perish and cut off from their
[59:19] mouth this is the God we serve his
[59:23] like that that is how he speaks he
[59:26] speaks truth when the nation's backslide
[59:29] and get the condition he rebukes them he
[59:31] corrects them he doesn't let them say
[59:33] where continuances no he let them go the
[59:37] captivity until they begin to cry until
[59:40] the recognized God is the strength God
[59:43] is there help God is who destroyer
[59:45] mighty tower and when they started
[59:47] crying to God God sends them a deliverer
[59:50] because he is the God understand this he
[59:54] is their God but you could backside he
[59:56] is their God but you have to turn away
[59:59] from him he is your God but you have to
[1:00:01] obey Him and serve Him because in
[1:00:03] obeying him you'll be pleasing him but
[1:00:10] abandoned you can't have anything from
[1:00:12] God but only my feet my feet the walls
[1:00:14] of Jericho fell by Moses refused to
[1:00:17] become call us on a favorite daughter
[1:00:18] Gideon did so and so my feet without
[1:00:21] faith is impossible to please him
[1:00:23] if you want the please God you must come
[1:00:25] to him with faith believe in his word is
[1:00:28] truth so let it be this morning the
[1:00:31] world is true not your dreams not your
[1:00:33] feelings not me it wasn't your past
[1:00:35] Church and this used to come to you and

[1:00:38] kind of cuckoo testimonies what kind of
[1:00:40] visions and revelations and time for my
[1:00:41] them not in my wrong right now to
[1:00:43] confirm the own vision because God
[1:00:47] didn't speak to him and God didn't show
[1:00:49] them it was all the imagination in their
[1:00:52] own heart that's why you can't trust
[1:00:54] your own thoughts and ideas trust the
[1:00:56] word the word is God the word is always
[1:00:59] God hallelujah do believe that oh praise

[1:30:46] constitutional watch them in ein greet
[1:30:49] them
[1:30:50] poor cross and shake their hand do let
[1:30:53] them escape and I say we're going well
[1:30:58] [Applause]
[1:31:02] praise [ __ ] them up with the love of
[1:31:04] God in your heart when you shake your
[1:31:08] hands for them I see the hand on fire so
[1:31:10] God but I push not knowing good boy
[1:31:14] Guardian man I'm not sure with the love
[1:31:17] of God never be greater if you could
[1:31:19] love enemies love people who hate you
[1:31:21] and your smile and I matter in the back
[1:31:22] in the kitchen is swollen it all all
[1:31:24] here only are swollen and the front
[1:31:25] ain't serious and you post in a big
[1:31:27] smile on your face because your passport
[1:31:29] and stamp the glory and a higher visa
[1:31:32] and the cartoon a dog at the pearly
[1:31:35] gates
[1:31:37] your book already stamped 20 years I see
[1:31:40] your book on your passport is a keep on
[1:31:42] posture keep on walking if you have your
[1:31:44] visa to come and check your and go this
[1:31:46] way and go that way and whatnot you
[1:31:48] don't want that your honor trouble at
[1:31:50] the river you want to get a clean pass
[1:31:52] Oh glory to God hallelujah that's what
[1:31:55] the cluster is about give us a clean
[1:31:57] pass people who believe in the air but
[1:32:03] about I'm a true servant of God never
[1:32:05] has to look this way or that way
[1:32:06] he don't care the frong of the enemy or
[1:32:09] the prison applauded of some man he
[1:32:13] enjoys fellowship of the Lord who sent
[1:32:15] him if he knows where you're standing he
[1:32:18] don't care what his enemies like it or
[1:32:19] whether his friends smile on him that
[1:32:22] doesn't make a bit of difference to a
[1:32:23] true servant of Christ
[1:32:24] he's got a job to do he don't look to
[1:32:27] see what do you think about it is this
[1:32:30] pleasing you he looked that way and
[1:32:33] enjoyed the presence of God hallelujah
[1:32:36] and the only way to please God is to
[1:32:38] obey Him o blessed be the name of the
[1:32:41] Lord so if we notice that the Apostle
[1:32:44] Peter he referred to the experience
[1:32:46] calling the holy mountain but I do not
[1:32:47] believe he meant the mountain was holy
[1:32:49] it wasn't a holy mountain it was the
[1:32:51] holy God in the mountain it isn't the
[1:32:52] holy church as the holy ghost in the
[1:32:54] church that makes it what it is it isn't
[1:32:56] the holy man is the Holy Spirit now we
[1:32:58] find out that God God never did anything
[1:33:01] just random every move he made it was
[1:33:04] ordained of the father we do random
[1:33:07] things he said I always do that which
[1:33:09] pleases the father so every movie need
[1:33:12] had a meaning and it was to please God I
[1:33:16] oh I would say here would it not be
[1:33:19] wonderful if we could have a testimony
[1:33:21] like that that we always do that which
[1:33:23] pleases God look at what he does for us
[1:33:27] in the condition we are in what would he
[1:33:29] do if we would be one hand and one
[1:33:32] Accord and the only way we can do that
[1:33:35] it's a unify our hearts together with
[1:33:37] brotherly love will be the officers of
[1:33:39] the church and the pastor obeys God and
[1:33:41] God worked through the pasta to the
[1:33:43] board into the church and all together
[1:33:46] a one unit
[1:33:47] the kingdom of God and Kabul here when
[1:33:49] we have a unified group nothing bothers
[1:33:52] you you don't know don't know the dismay
[1:33:55] about anything that's the kind of person
[1:33:57] God ordained to take the land motive was
[1:33:59] complete he was a man that wouldn't
[1:34:01] compromise fira wanted to agree and said
[1:34:04] moses or they can go leave it sir in
[1:34:06] behind leave the car behind that's the
[1:34:08] way the devil wants a Christian to come
[1:34:10] it'll be all right if I join a church
[1:34:12] but don't forget June I get one
[1:34:24] go to church but don't forgive this one
[1:34:26] do forgive that one you see you have to
[1:34:28] stretch at one time I said some brothers

[1:49:58] something we are men and women we are
[1:50:00] Christians
[1:50:00] he's our example he let us completely
[1:50:03] live ourselves into the hands of the
[1:50:04] Holy Ghost that we might become subjects
[1:50:06] of the kingdom of God he was totally man
[1:50:08] he was totally God but he surrendered
[1:50:11] here we go
[1:50:11] his natural pasture his physical parts
[1:50:14] and his own thinking and his own doing
[1:50:17] and his own cares I only know that which
[1:50:20] pleases my father he was totally man and
[1:50:24] totally God in other words he didn't
[1:50:27] totally co-op any Hill which I mountain
[1:50:28] by himself and play like if he's so
[1:50:30] spiritual he has nothing to it in
[1:50:32] natural the issue with Jesus as opposed
[1:50:35] to Johnny journalist and then one that
[1:50:37] John wasn't mixing John just blasting
[1:50:39] left right and center just making our
[1:50:41] way he was a bulldozer but do Little Mix
[1:50:45] nothing pollution is coming up the
[1:50:47] greater and create the holding mountains
[1:50:49] making him plain John shopping John cut
[1:50:52] and bring fruits or miss me repentance
[1:50:53] Jesus mixed in with harlots wine the bus
[1:50:56] all kind of people Jesus they have
[1:50:58] properties of that so that from where
[1:51:00] John he was mixing that permit Jesus he
[1:51:04] mix it then the Jesus tell them he
[1:51:06] single
[1:51:07] you as how well don't need a physician
[1:51:10] this big who was sick so Jesus was among
[1:51:14] sick people and these well people find
[1:51:16] gestures mimics my view man of God why
[1:51:19] are you why why he association with that
[1:51:23] he said well these sick people need a
[1:51:25] physician I will stay on this side so he
[1:51:30] was meeting the needs of the people and
[1:51:34] the pharisees and sadducees was keeping
[1:51:36] the status quo of their religion until
[1:51:39] when she has jammed them so much with
[1:51:41] signs I wanna Merkel's they came
[1:51:43] together I have a convention and says
[1:51:45] you know let's cut it together and
[1:51:48] formed is a hidden concern they couldn't
[1:51:51] talk to each other but when Jesus come
[1:51:52] they cut a common enemy they came
[1:51:54] together against Jesus and what will
[1:51:57] happen they have to come together
[1:51:58] against the brain
[1:52:00] and then just not gonna strike so
[1:52:02] therefore you who are the prior after
[1:52:04] understand what's gonna happen it
[1:52:06] happened to Jesus you can have it did
[1:52:07] you there's gonna be a rough time ahead
[1:52:10] therefore you've got to be trained in
[1:52:12] the wood to deal with that rough day
[1:52:14] hallelujah see the amens how to
[1:52:16] disappear rough time ahead but that's
[1:52:18] what we were raised before we have
[1:52:20] reason for small-time greens not for
[1:52:22] rough time
[1:52:23] oh that's why the gospel rough you know
[1:52:25] kingdom of God is preached you know
[1:52:27] anyone present it I love people
[1:52:29] impersonating and saying that dia in
[1:52:31] time what not - trouble
[1:52:32] it preaches it just give it to the
[1:52:35] priest you know and you have it but in
[1:52:36] this message and this gospel you have to
[1:52:38] press your way
[1:52:39] Oh hallelujah are you with me now so
[1:52:43] therefore whatever I'm saying this he
[1:52:45] said yeah it'll watch watch he gives
[1:52:47] some apostles some prophets some
[1:52:49] evangelists for the perfecting of the
[1:52:51] Saints who are the Saints sanctified
[1:52:52] ones the ones who started from down
[1:52:54] there
[1:52:54] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:52:56] the ministry the ministry of Jesus
[1:53:00] Christ so this ministry is about Ovid
[1:53:02] ministry this one ministry that one no
[1:53:04] no this is the Ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:53:07] which must be given to ministers that
[1:53:12] ministry parted a bride are you with me
[1:53:14] now but a Branham was born a prophet and
[1:53:18] he was ordained a prophet but he had to
[1:53:19] do the book of evangelists until he was
[1:53:21] pleased as that Elijah so we have to do
[1:53:24] the work of this duck until God pleases
[1:53:26] us the church and the people and

[1:53:48] be praying he look around the world
[1:53:49] people laugh at him people didn't

[2:09:07] wash he's ready he's is washed he's
[2:09:10] baptized
[2:09:11] he's led by the Spirit you overcome the
[2:09:13] devil it's written it's written it's
[2:09:15] written
[2:09:15] he's victorious in his spirit he woke on
[2:09:18] the lust of the eyes you're welcome the
[2:09:20] lust of the flesh
[2:09:20] here come the pride of life in his
[2:09:22] spirit he's done a box that I said to
[2:09:24] overcome I ready for the wandering it's
[2:09:26] a mind thing is a spirit thing after
[2:09:29] victory in the spirit you already have
[2:09:30] the victory he walks to the temple for
[2:09:33] the intelligence of God for the mind of
[2:09:35] God he knows just scripture what to read
[2:09:39] it he's not reading any scripture yes to
[2:09:42] find the place his place where he is
[2:09:46] written to identify himself he found the
[2:09:50] scripture the Spirit is upon me that's
[2:09:52] present tense that was prophecy but that
[2:09:57] did that service turn was happening he
[2:10:00] found the present tense the Spirit is
[2:10:02] upon me because he has anointed me to do
[2:10:04] this that and so on then he said this
[2:10:06] description fulfilled and guess what he
[2:10:08] sat down whatever I'm said is supreme
[2:10:13] anointing was upon him he didn't swing
[2:10:15] on the chandelier he sat down because
[2:10:19] the supreme anointing is knowing what
[2:10:22] and how he know what to do and how to do
[2:10:27] it there's no need to freak out there's
[2:10:32] no need to walk on a freaking no no he
[2:10:33] know what to do
[2:10:35] I hope to do it that is my jealousy
[2:10:38] ticker then I walk or you can see that
[2:10:40] still be forgiven name you can see even
[2:10:43] one it will be done because after while
[2:10:46] you understand the word itself is God
[2:10:48] not the feelings not the shake him
[2:10:51] I get shaken oh well she has did not do
[2:10:55] all that drama is a stress comfort nice
[2:10:57] comfort little lady I say arise he arose
[2:11:01] he was just speaking the word little
[2:11:03] fishy I do about your life but my
[2:11:05] beautiful take a thing are people not
[2:11:11] know like Rama does that need all of
[2:11:13] that little fishy I give up their life
[2:11:15] life coming to the fish no drama just
[2:11:17] the words could be get a lot of shelter
[2:11:20] praise some of us like drama but quite
[2:11:22] have the word the word is God so when
[2:11:26] you pray don't expect kind of feeling
[2:11:28] and your feeling your future knowing
[2:11:29] them in your prey under one of them look
[2:11:33] what we didn't know until you pray you
[2:11:34] pray and you believe what to pray for an
[2:11:36] answer
[2:11:37] anointed or no anointed
[2:11:41] feeling or no feeling or believing is
[2:11:44] what God sent example Jericho Ward's the
