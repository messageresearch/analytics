message from the prophet William brandham uh God's word calls for total separation from unbelief amen listen and enjoy amen praise God we're going to turn in the scriptures to few scriptures that I have written out here or uh what I if I want would call it a text I wouldn't know whether they call it a text or not but just for a text I want to take this thought God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief and now I wish to read out of the Bible over in the Book of Genesis the 13th chapter of Genesis and we wish to start with the fifth verse to read I just love to read the word because what I say could fail that's a man but if I just read this word what he says can't fail so then I know there'll be good come out of it if no more than just reading the word the fifth verse We Begin of the 13th chapter and lot also which went with Abram had loocks and herds and Tents and the lamb was not able to Bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was Strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsman of Lot's cattle and the Canaanite prite dwelt in the land and Abram said unto lot let there be no Strife I pray thee between me and thee and between my herdsman and thy herdsman for we are Brethren is not the whole land before thee separate thyself I pray thee from me and if thou will take the left hand then I'll go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then I will go to the left and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld the plains of Jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and gomorra even as the garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt as thou comest out of Zora then lot chose him all the plains of Jordan and lot journeyed Eastward and they separated themselves one from the other and Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan and lot dwelt in the city of the Plains and pitched his tent towards Sodom but the man of Sodom were Wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly and the Lord said unto Abraham after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou northward Southward Eastward Westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give thee and to thy seed forever now the thought of God's word calling a total separation we only know this by as we read the word and see the word uh manifest itself now in the beginning Genesis 1:3 we find that there was Darkness upon the earth and the spirit of God moved upon the water and said let there be light and there was light and God saw that the light was good and God separated the light from the darkness so the word of God began to separate the light from the darkness from the beginning so does it remain to this day as I said last night of Jesus when he was only 12 years old and being a mistake of his mother who is claimed by people to be the mother of God and how that the woman said while thy father and I have sought thee with tears and quickly he being the word said knowest thou not that I must be about my father's business see she was declaring him to be Joseph's son but he wasn't Joseph's son if he' been Joseph's son he would been with him but he was with the father about his business so the word is always corrective and always right and the word word will correct ever wrong always now when the earth that God was going to use the Earth and it was in total darkness the spirit of God spoke out and said let there be light and he separated the light from the darkness and it's been doing that ever since separating light from Darkness God's word also separated the water from the land in the beginning God spoke and the water was separated from the land so that he had a a reason for that God never speaks a word unless he's got a reason for speaking that word he's not like you and I that we just or especially myself that speaks so many foolish things God speaks every word with a meaning and something that he's trying to achieve and will achieve by his word and it will perform exactly what he said it will do now if God said let there be light and there was no light then that that isn't uh that wasn't God said that when God says anything he must back up what he says and when the word of God has been a Vindicated the word been a Vindicated that is light now the word is isn't light until it's a Vindicated light if God said let there be light and there was no light then it wasn't the word of God but when light sprung upon the Earth that showed the word was Vindicated and and it was light now today if God has made a promise and when that promise is Vindicated then that is light that's the light of the day when the word is a Vindicated the word for the hour is a Vindicated then God was going to have a our Earth that he was going to grow vegetation and have people up on the earth and then he spoke and separated the waters from the sea then also he separated in Genesis life from Death now if we believe the word of God it is the Word of Life to us right but if we question the word of God it's death to us for God has spoken who can deny see and if we question the word of God then it becomes death like Eve Now Eve question one one little phase of God's word and what did it do caused all this trouble that we had if she would remain behind the word fortified behind the word the whole armor of God and not disbelieved it then it would have never had way it has it never been this way but you see there Came Death then God also had an atonement being Mercyful to us he accepted a substitute death for their death which both he separated life from Death also in the Garden of Eden and he did it by his word and today he does the same thing when we're in Gross Darkness as I spoke on Sunday Darkness upon the land upon the people and gross darkness in the midst of all of this he's still speaking his Word of Life to those who want to believe it and now we find that if um Jesus has constantly told us that there's a separation and we find that the last thing that's predicted to the human race before the great final day when we Ascend into the presence of God there will be a final separation he will separate the sheep from the goats God will continually has been separating separating and that's what he's doing tonight it's what he always does you can see it in meeting he separates Faith from unbelief he speaks out he declares himself to those who will believe him have faith in him now we find out in numbers the 6th chapter that a nazarites call a Nazarite call was to separate themselves from all the world to the word of God that is a Nazarite call separated we find out that Sam son was a Nazarite unto the Lord and he was separated from the U uh by a sign and this sign was that he was to wear his hair long with Seven Locks it was a a sign of Separation that he was called for a purpose and I don't want to get started on this because I said that it I was just going to speak a few minutes but I think that today when we see our sisters wearing long hair as the Bible said they should I think it's a Nazarite sign that they want to follow the lord I know that sounds flat and I I I wanted to go home see because it is it looks like somebody is trying to to do keep a uh something that God told them to do no matter what the price the world uh has to say about it out there how many scornful or laughers or critics that doesn't bother a person that's totally separated from the things of the world to the things of God they'll obey the word and separate themselves from the things of the world because the word separates them I know they stand criticism but if we wasn't criticized then there'd be something wrong the world always knows its own but as I've said that remember criticism on the count of the word of God is only growing pain of his grace it shows that you have separated yourself to be a Christian to act like one to live like one to obey every commandment of God and it's a it's a Nazarite vow to separate a call from God that separates you from the things of the world I believe tonight that every man and woman every boy and girl that's born of the spirit of God is a Nazarite unto the Lord because they have separated them things themselves from the cares of the world and whatever the world's got to say you live in this city here where there's great schools and and we see our nation calling for higher standard of Education which is all right nothing to say about that but that education cannot give you salvation that's right a scientist can split a grain of wheat and tell you how many different uh chemicals is in it but it can't find the life that's in there an education can learn you or teach you mathematics and and it can teach you history and whatever more but it cannot bring life to you your education will not do that right God has one way of bringing life to you that's when you're ready to separate yourself from all the things of the world and all the the cures of the world and clean only to God's promised word Paul was a Nazarite unto the Lord he was separated from his Orthodox Church to the word of the Living God Aaron was a Nazarite unto the Lord he was separated from among the Brethren to Bear the birthstones and to be the high priest it is a total separation we're not to go back into the world no more or have anything to do with the world but cleave only unto God Jesus is coming after a bride a woman a church that's separated from the things of the world or the cures of the world she's separated from the Fashions of this Modern Age that we live in she's separated from the the ks and the traditions of churches she's separated only to God and God is the word and as husband and wife is one so does the bride and the word become one for the words living through the bride amen that's how that's her credentials that's her identification if I could pull out a a PhD or lldd and show you my credentials from certain organization from some school that school would recognize that credential but the only credential that a Believer has is the word of God living in him declaring Jesus Christ lives in that person that's right that's a separated Nazarite unto the Lord separated for the word sake the Bible said the word of God is sharper than a two-age sword cutting to the suer and the mire of the bone and discerns the thought that's in the heart that's the reason Jesus could look upon the people and perceive what they were thinking he was the word now the first Adam that was born in the world or not born but created by God the first Adam separated himself from the the word to his wife now he could have stayed with the word if he wished to but he separated himself from the word to be with his wife that's exactly what the common carnal church member does today separates themselves from the true Living Word to hold to their Church where the eve put a question upon the word whether God would punish or not Satan put the question Eve believed it and then when the church today puts a question upon the word is he the same does he still uh live in his church and per uh perform his signs and miracles that he did when he was here on Earth which he so surely promised us in St John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also even greater than this shall he do for I go to my father these signs shall follow them that believe shall follow them the question is the the people today does he really mean it and when you accept what the church says does he really mean it then you put yourself in the same condition that Adam did and join yourself with the the woman of the Church of the this world and separate yourself from the blessings that God has promised to every believer that would separate himself from the world to the world uh that's the truth we are have had the privilege of living in the day that when the word of God that we've seen is lotted through each age for certain things to happen and when this is lotted sometimes a man wonder how it's going to be done professors have their own idea but in them AG God has always sent forth his prophet and the word of the Lord comes to the prophet and vindicates the word to that generation and the prophets is always a Nazarite separated from everything else to obey the word of God do you remember what Peter and John said is it right for us to obey man or God when they questioned them about the experience of Pentecost now the first man separated himself the first Adam from the word to go with his wife that question whether God kept his word or not what a perfect type of the lukewarm carnal minded believer today that still wants to cling with what the tradition says instead of taking what the word says that's it a very real type he was separated to his wife the carnal believer is separated from the word to the church but when the second Adam was created in the womb of a woman and came to the world he was a Nazarite to the word of God he was separated from the world to the word now Hebrews the 7th chapter 26th verse tells us that that them priest continually died but this Jesus is Holy and separated from Sinners sin is unbelief there was no unbelief found any nowhere when he was sure on Earth he said who can condemn me of sin sin is unbelief if I haven't done just what was prophesied for this age if I haven't met the requirements of what Messiah is supposed to do then don't believe me said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me tell you who who he is because it had been prophesied since Eden that there would come a savior the prophet said he'd be born of a virgin and how that he'd be called Emmanuel and also he was a counselor the Prince of Peace Mighty God and that's what they accused him of making himself God he was God Amen and he was the prince ofie of Mighty God and the Everlasting father there's no other father but him spiritually speaking he's the only father the father of us all and we find all believers he's the father of all who will believe his word for he was completely separated from the church from his Traditions from his mother from the world and only did that which pleased the father now he was a different person from Adam no matter what anybody questioned to him the word it was the word always first and he pre knew that the word was right when Satan tried to whitewash it for him and said it's written he said yes and it's also written he with stood Satan upon the word because that's what he was the word the Bible First John St John the first chapter said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he's the same yesterday today and forever it's always a connection ction with the spoken word of God God's promise for the day and when he comes it's so unusual the people can hardly grasp it because we're so sewed into to farms and ideas of our own that it's hard for us to grasp what's truth I think much of that would apply to to Joseph in the days of of the the U Mary in her maternity she she was to be mother and Joseph loved her and he he wanted to believe he was a righteous man a good man and he wanted to believe that story that Mary was telling him but still there was a question that now she's a good woman no doubt Mary had explained to him the visit of Gabriel to her and he was a just man in the lineage of David and yet her it looked like that she was trying to use him for a shield to take off her reproach because if she was engaged to him and to be found in this condition was the same as adultery Deuteronomy tells us so and would be stoned for the ACT and it looked like that she was using him for a shield and the man a good man a just man the Bible said he was a just man but her case was so unusual that he could not grasp it he' look in her lovely face and the sincerity and honesty that she would tell her story in and no doubt but he'd go to his home or his Cartner shop say I I just can't see how she would tell me wrong but the case is so unusual if he would have only searched the scriptures that a virgin is to conceive see it was so unusual to him because it was out of the line of his thinking but she is exactly in the scripture and so is it today Brethren that the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and his promised word of this hour is so unusual good man stumble over it it's too unusual they say that the dead was raised up the blind see the de here the Holy Spirit discerns the thoughts foretells things that's coming to pass never fail at one time or they they can't can't grasp it it's so unusual so they they uh say well it's a telepathy or it's a evil spirit just like they did in that day the unusualness of the word of God but when a man is born in the world for a a Believer he becomes a Nazarite when he separates himself from anything that's contrary to the word a total separation Jesus said I come to separate a man from his wife tear up a family and he that won't uh take up his cross and follow me is not worthy to be called mine a separation from everything anything from church from from a community from a belief or from family or anything that would stand between you and believing the entire word of God if your soul will not punctuate every promise for this hour with an amen there's something wrong somewhere you need a separation so Jesus was the word made flesh and he was completely separated from Sinners unbelievers that the word itself flowed completely and and thoroughly through him that he said I do nothing until I see the father do it first they asked him question him about things he said verely I say unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing watch everything that he said was perfect just he had not to ask about it think about it it was perfect and his perfect truth always separated the truth from error even as I quote back again again his mother said thy father and I before those priests that should already testify it was a virgin barnon but in the moments of her grief How could a 12-year-old boy we have no record of him even being in school how could his intelligence be so great as to debate with the priest Sage learned man and why when she called that this Joseph was his father quickly the word of God he was separated ated he was the word and the word corrected the error know ye not that I must be about my father's business that was not just that little 12year old boy that was the word of God speaking through his little childish mouth to correct error separating like he did in the beginning Darkness from light aive from the truth death from life it's a separation always the word requires total and complete separation regardless Jesus said let every man's word be a lie let mine be true that's right all down Through the Ages the same thing has happened it's a separating always he separates his people from the unbelief he did it at the beginning he does it same today each one of the prophets was separated from unbelief they reason they did that is because the the word of the Lord came to them now believe a night somewhere perhaps this year Sunday or last night that I was speaking what the word sear in the Old Testament meant it meant a man a diviner a man that would tell the future events that were coming to pass and then when they come to pass exactly without failure come to pass exactly what he said then God said listen to this man or hearing fearing for I'm with him then he had the Divine interpretation of the written word for that was his credentials of identification that he was God's prophet and the word come to him amen right now separation it separated Isaiah from the church World it separated Moses from the church World it separated the uh all the the great prophets to the ages from the church world because they had it separated Jesus from his Brethren it separated the apostles from the church it was at that day the Pharisees Sadducees great man holy man good man fine man humble man man that had fruit of the spirit more so than what Jesus exercised but what was his credentials that the word was with him the word promised of that day was living through him he said which one of you can condemn me of sin which one of you can say that what I have claimed hasn't happened that he showed that he was a separated Nazarite of the Lord he was the Lord himself in flesh Abraham also he was a separated person from the world when God called Abraham at 75 years old separate yourself from your Kindred and from all your the unbelief and come out into a world that you've never walked in before and amongst a people that you've never known before come out and separate yourself from anybody that would be contrary to what you're believing that You' be a Nazarite unto the Lord because he was holding a promise of a son praise God he had to separate from his father from his mother from his Kindred and what separated him him not because he was a good man but because he believed that God was able to keep the promise he had given and when he was 25 years later and the baby had never come Sarah being 90 he 100 and when the angel of the Lord visit him that Jesus referred to that would come again in the last days God in a human Farm sat down before him and Tau and Sarah being almost 100 years old in the tent behind him laughed because the angel said I will visit you according to the time of the promise and she said me being old and would have pleasure again with my Lord seeing he's old and this man well which was God in flesh said why did Sarah laugh in the tent now she run out and tried to deny but he said yes but you did laugh because it she didn't believe it could be right now notice Jesus said that would come again as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man amen again the spirit of God will come upon martal human flesh that man eat the meat of a calf drinking the milk from the cow and eat butter and bread in human flesh and Abraham said he was Elohim God manifested in flesh Jesus promised that God before his coming would be manifested in human flesh again that's the Holy Spirit he's only one God manifesting itself separating again lot from Abraham lot wanted the word God SE tore up his world and separated Abraham and lot lot being a type again of a carnal believer who didn't think these things were true he just went on down in Sodom and he didn't have the real spunk to stand out as we' call it and call what was right right and wrong wrong so he went down all these Believers as we could go on for hours all these were like a bunch of change out of your pocket in God's hand you pull out a bunch of change there's pennies nickels dimes quarters half a dollars dollar all in coins now that's what the world is in God's hand there's some people that's just can have a Penny's worth of it and God can only use them in a penny way that's all they can buy don't reject them if they can't believe the real truth don't turn them down don't kick them out and say they're not in it because God uses pennies sometimes amen lot was just a penny Abraham was a silver dollar so it taken a hundred lots to make an Abraham so it take a hundred carnal Believers will never stand in the presence of a genuine Christian that's separated from the carnal things of the world living in Christ Jesus where the word can flow through him he can only take a penny worth that's all he's got so you see people say I don't believe in healing I don't believe in these things just know it's a penny but just let him alone just a Penny's worth and so that's all he can buy don't stop him just let him alone remember that's just all farther he can go Joseph he was separated from his Brethren yeah I didn't mean that hard in that way that I said it see I mean if he just well I belong to this and that's what we believe it's just a penny go ahead thing just aend he say well the Lord bless you my brother se's copper he can never be silver so just let it go ahead God can use him oh he's using it I'd rather see him down there in a church than see a barroom stand there on the corner would you sure so just let it alone God can use it anyhow maybe not very much but he'll use what he can use as much as he'll let him use that's right so that's kind of a rude way to express anything but I well I hope you get the truth that I mean what what is meant see he can't believe in discernment and the power of God is Promised for this days those Pharisees couldn't do it either they couldn't see Jesus being God oh no you make yourself God a man one day he was standing there at you multiplied loaves of bread and so forth far then and he said um unless you eat the the bread uh the son of man's body and drink his blood uh there's no life in you oh imagine this congregation they walked away from me this man expects us to be a cannibal eat somebody's flesh oh that's crazy Doctors medical doctors and so forth said the man's insane that's all there is the priest is right that man is crazy give us his body to eat that's all he said see but the spiritual mind maybe they could not understand it those disciples they didn't know just exactly what it meant but they believed it anyhow because where did it come from it come from the one they know to be the Son of God I might not be able to understand all in here but I believe it it's God's word I want to separate myself from anything is contrary to it I've tried to stand like that notice another group the 70 he called one day he standing talking to them and he said the son of man shall Ascend up into heaven from whence he come from they said this man he's taking us to the place he was born we know his mother Mary while we know his brothers we know all and then this man's going to take a the son of man is coming going up into heaven from when he come from he come from Bethlehem how did he do that see he said it in that way see and they walked with him no more they walked away they said ah this man we know there's something wrong with him them disciples sat right there see they believed they had seen the promised word for that day Vindicated and manifested by who could create but God himself could take bread and they know he was a Son of God whether it was in riddles or not that whether they understood it or not they walked right on anyhow because the word was Vindicated and they were separated from anything contrary to it thank God help us to have faith like that we believe this Bible to be the truth I may not have faith enough to make all the promises come to pass but I believe it anyhow amen I believe the hour that we're living Joseph separated from his Brethren Without a Cause now what was the matter with him he was not willing to be separated it wasn't his will to separate but they separated themselves from him see from his bright shiny dollar their penni's worth couldn't stand it they know they were Patriarchs they know that Isaac was their U pardon me Jacob was their father and they know that to be true but Joseph was born he couldn't help it he was spiritual he saw Visions could interpret dreams and they were perfectly right whatever he said was the truth and his patriarch Brothers moved with Indy and sold him to the Egyptians see they they separated themselves from him because they were pennies he was of a different quality so is a real believer today he's of a different quality they'll separate themselves they don't understand it Copper from Silver now we find out they move within the insulting why they do the same thing today what it really was they said they were it was for jealousy they didn't want to break down because if the quality in them were not the quality was in him and because of it they were jealous because they were pennies and he was a dollar see now if the penny say blessed be the name of the Lord my brother dollar here see I can't make the change that he does but I'll make what I can that's that we go along now praise God let's all stand amen you appreciate the word this evening hallelujah amen just raise your hands and close your

often as eat this bread and drink this cup ye do sh the Lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and
