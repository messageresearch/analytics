Lord your word is true your word is eternal and your word can feel father me you come tonight and confirm your word come tonight and breathe fire into your word come tonight let the pillar of fire rest on my shoulder and speak out to your people tonight in Jesus name I ask it scripture uh Matthew 24 I want to read verse 1 to 14 Luke 16 16. and have a contextual you sit down and I'll read it afterwards but uh Matthew 24 reading from verse 1. and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and the disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the Temple and Jesus said unto them see not all these things very relation to you they shall not be left here one stone upon another thy shall not be thrown down and as he said upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came under him privately saying tell us when shall these things be one two what shall be the sign of thy coming three and of the end of the world and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ shall deceive many you shall hear the Wars rumors of War see that he'd be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom they shall be famines pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places all these at the beginning of Sorrows then shall deliver you to be afflicted shall kill you and he shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betrayed one another shall hate one another and many false prophets shall arise dishes that have deceived many and because the iniquity shall abound the love of many shall Works whole but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be saved and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come amen I read in Luke 16 16 familiar scripture the law and the prophets wanted John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presented me God blesses what you may be seated praise the Lord and I have a context scripture and that can take scriptures from Luke chapter 11 1 to 13. I want to read it no just to follow within what we want to share tonight what God put Upon Our Hearts so Luke chapter 11 verse 1 says and it came to pass as he was praying in a certain place when he exists one of the disciples said unto him Lord teach us to pray as John taught his disciples he said unto them when you pray see Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom will come thy will be done as in heaven so in Earth give us day by day or Daily Bread forgive us our trespasses forgive us our sins for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from all evil note no arrogance no I am bride and this and you know no no no no no no no no no he says and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from all evil he said unto them now right after this prayer he said unto them which of you shall have a friend so so in other words he's bringing adept of in prayer that is hidden in a story a mystery hidden in a parable like a story he said now which of you shall have a friend and shall go on to him at midnight and send him friend lend me tree loose for a friend of mine is in his journey is come to me I have nothing set before him and he from within shall answer and said trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed I cannot rise and give thee I say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he's his friend you know he's like what a friend we have in Jesus though he's a friend watch this he said now yet because of his opportunity or persistence or perseverance or nagging or not something knocking he said he will rise and give him as many as he needed and I say unto you oh that's how we bring the prayer I say unto you this is all you're going to do it this is how you're gonna get through ask and it shall be given unto you seek ye shall find knock and it shall be open unto you then you drain long deeper for everyone to ask it receive it you say acts 1 ask it receive it he that Seeker shall find and he that knock shall be opened to you Hallelujah for everyone that has got receive it he that seek it final and hinder knock it it shall be open a lazy man is totally messed up he ain't knocking he ain't asking he had seeking he just looking for handouts feeling entitled in the message because he have some books and tips but in further the next verse Jesus said no this is deep and it's not like we don't know this now we know it but I'm trusting the Lord bring a fresh oil on this tonight to you forever what if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he asks a fish could he give him a fish a zipper or if he has an egg with him a scorpion if he then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Ghost to them that ask him and he said how to ask ask it seek it knock it hold glory to God so Jesus put it inside of here you want to make the Rapture you want to get the bro you want to be part of the Bride you have to get the oil the oil is the spirit you have to get the spirit the spirit of the Holy Ghost you're going to get it if you're getting the atmosphere of it you won't get it if you don't ask for it he said how much more the heavenly father will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him this scripture can't lie this scripture can fail this is the truth you could you could rest your soul on this we could close off here tonight oh glory to God and seek God tonight o glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God so that's a refresher of the titles of the messages that have gone so far for this year the day of vengeance dear vengeance is in my heart and the year of my redeem is come only the Holy Ghost filled bride will

name of the Lord you love him tonight praise God what did Jesus say just before that he said for nation shall rise against Nation all of a sudden Russia just rise up against Ukraine just like that you

of Vengeance God's Vengeance Gods right praise God and then all you seen outside and afterwards they're going to switch to inside and judgment begins where in the house of God right in this message Hallelujah judgment going being a pour out oh glory to God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord do you believe that Hallelujah do you believe that a prophet my vision saw Los Angeles sinking California going down sliding into the ocean think about it outside in straight into the ocean hallelujah praise God I wonder if Russia will take advantage of that time I wonder if China will take advantage of that time the prophet preacher Mexico the invasion of the United States of America and sometimes they're looking like spiritual sometimes they're looking like it's natural Oh Glory to God and if they say we will bum you if you don't do what we say they have no choice to protect the people you already see bumps hitting here hitting there we're not even sure if America will even pass through the tribulation because the vision the seventh Vision was America bummed up a crater all over total Destruction All Over America fires everywhere destruction everywhere the land of the Brave and the free the hour of judgment will come O praise God that is a pride on the earth he said don't worry yet don't be hard don't worry yet don't be terrified of these things oh Lord these are the beginning of Sorrows Oh Glory to God we are living yet many false prophets shall arise have many volts pastors and preachers and teachers child deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many gonna work school is your love boxing coal is Iniquity in your system because as we get closer our love's supposed to get greater oh give the Lord a shout the prophet prophesy love will only be among the elect I wonder what the rest will have oh give the Lord a shout in the house Oh Glory to God you would find that love among the elect praise the name of the Lord Praise Peter Jesus Hallelujah this Gospel of the Kingdom must be preached let's go let's go tonight let's get to work tonight all right let me go the gospel commonly believed is the word of God and that is true in one sense but the word of God is not gospel alone the word of God is the seed that produces the gospel remember what the prophet said I would just want to lay the seed I hope men rise up to break more sense to it and people are stuck there and think it's a set of nonsense he said I hope they raise up and bring more sense to it I am just going to lay the seed he didn't stop there and I hope they make it come to life so I seed by definition of a seed is dead foreign if it's hard if it's dry you can put it here you could store it for five years six years ten years how much years is a seed when you put it in the right circumstance and environment and the rainfall and break it up you see Life come out the seed I hope that they could make it come to life and when they said they just let the passage of ministers everybody in other words we have to become the Living Word if I've written word if I have Living Word it's not the same thing you read the Bible it's the word it's the written word when the word become flesh is the Living Word because they started Living you and the world become flesh by the spirit oh give the Lord a shout when the spirits had to activate and work through You by you in you then that's the word become flesh then you yourself become the Living Word could we continue so the word of God is the seed that produces the gospel so Jesus said a sorrow and fought to sow seed and some fell in the Stony places some fell on the wee side the Falls of the edifawed them some fell on Stony existed ground and went over and brought a hundredfold now the seed you people here who are farmers every seed we produce if it is the right kind of ground and every Divine promise of God in the Bible will produce if it is met in the right kind of a heart it will produce the promise the entire messenger and message should meet the end time conditions should meet because we have in time conditions don't you think so this message could not have been preached 40 years ago no the entire message and messenger has got to meet back there in them days they had probably would have worked but it got to quote the end time conditions be converted believe the gospel sign that's the message of the day wash your souls in the blood of the Lamb believe the gospel that the end time signs are here the seed of the Gospel has been taking place the seed of the Gospel have been taking place we couldn't preach the gospel without his seed because the originals he come to our prophet so the Pentecostal couldn't really preach the the seed they have they rejected the prophet and the seed common books and tapes to call it a bride to receive seed what's the secret the word is in the bride so the word have to come into the bride which will be the seed hearers of the entire Bible that God that's what the conflict on the preach in you tonight have a pyramid in seed form okay the Lord I shout if you don't see this if you don't see the black like a bat you have to see this thing here in you tonight have a seed a pyramid seed inside of you waiting for fire waiting for water waiting for rain even later rain that seed has succumbed if you don't believe nothing else tonight you have to believe that because the mouth of the Lord had spoken it he said my word shall not return unto me void it shall accomplish the purpose I sent it for to accomplishment Oh Glory to God hallelujah Glory that God I feel inspired tonight when Elijah was going he knew that monster was going to fall upon Elisha he couldn't tell the man that you have to wait till he make the step forward you gotta tell him you have a successor you know they can take it easy they can go online they can do what you want no you leave him to work it out okay the Lord I shout in the house you have to work it out past your battle pass to Jericho pass to the school of the process until he crossed Jordan oh God help me tonight hey Hallelujah glory to God glory when when they asked about Caesar taxes what do you tell them right he says if you see you know is there any fish let him go on fishna you wouldn't think this but go and put a hand and put themself it's inside the fish you haven't gone catchy fish then you're getting coins inside the fish if you're lazy you don't want to fish that's your business you have no money to get you have the money money inside the day you know don't let anybody fool you the principles and the Bible is still the word still operating out there my my praise God praise God praise God hallelujah what is the gospel well you see here it is in the Bible no no that is part of it that's the seed but Paul said the gospel came to us not true only but through the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit so when we talk about seed Lena foundation and putting seed and teaching and teaching and teaching and then at the gospel yet that's part are we in the woods are we in the message do you understand what we are teaching tonight all right so the gospel came to us not to worry only but through Power and demonstration's plural of the Holy Spirit Matthew 4 22-24 Bible and Jesus went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the Kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of diseases among the people and his Fame went toward all Syria and they brought unto him all sick people that would take madiver's diseases and torments and those that were possessed with devils and those that were lunatic and those that had the policy and he healed them oh get the Lord a shout he was preaching the kingdom he was preaching the gospel what he was saying is my kingdom is not of this world I have to demonstrate the world hey that I come from okay the Lord I shout in the hope Oh Glory Glory Glory [Applause] people looking for reason P looking for free food looking for deliverance from the Roman government looking for natural things looking for a better house and a better roof looking for some better donkey and some car to take them for where they're going but this one I don't care this one don't they're looking for that and Jesus come and talk about the kingdom of God the Kingdom of Heaven I come from another kingdom and he had to demonstrate the power what does Kingdom have hallelujah praise God that's why he said in for hallelujah oh glory to God so by doing Miracles by cast not Devils they were seen a higher order a higher power apart from another dimension that they know they did not have that the Pharisee knew that they don't have okay the Lord I shout what would God do a pride that come to Perfection word living or glory to god-spoken word pride anointed and commission okay the Lord I shouting us this message will I see nothing yet the world has seen nothing yet this gospel must be preached and then the end shall come not put into his thing okay the Lord I shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah oh my oh my you shall have you have Wars rumors of wars see that you're being not troubled if you are troubled you in trouble praise God because the word said do not be troubled because you have to hear something the world after he has something not just them bad news and all news he said be not troubled fought all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet oh glory to God Jesus called break down until he comes to verse 14 and there is from and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness to All Nations and then shall the End come nor any coming until the gospel I preached they are ready for us yet all glory to God we coming through we coming true we coming through oh hallelujah hallelujah this gospel not teaching you will get to that [Music] [Applause] [Music] today they're trying to pervert the world I remember something I saw daddy Grammy Awards pass here and they had a guy named Sam Smith I think it is um I think his name is Sam Smith I call he said by the seed but he was dressed up as Satan all in red with horns hat and people dancing all around worshiping and and everything else that people would fire all around them all in red and they're doing this they worshiping the devil normal [Music] Grammys on the right Wingers of course will complain against it look at them look at them look at them just know is a different kind of movie you know them same Christian remember he's describing Pharisees that come and kill Jesus man and when pilot tried to get you over here and he said he washed my hands over this man he tried something he said but you know what I will bring out a rubber teeth I know they're gonna let Jesus get off you say who shall I Let Go who do you want Jesus or this Barabbas Jesus what shall I do with this Jesus called the Christ multiplied Bread on fish heal this security is he deadly because whatever see he multitude they said crucified who's saying that church folks then Moses message people calling prophecy they're watching a man manifesting what no other man did and they both crucify him and if they've done that a green tree what they will do with that dry if they've done that to the Son of God what they will do to the attribute sons of the spirit coming forth in the last days then they found fault but the man who was the word now they're going to find fault with the word working through the man the messages see nothing yet when the world began to work through men then they go talk Oh Glory the God but then the critics man could be shut oh give the Lord a shout I feel inspired tonight Hallelujah this Gospel of the Kingdom not just ordinary gospel no it's a money gospel you have all kind of gospel people preaching and necessary preaching we're not talking about the gospel of the Kingdom you hear this Kingdom of a king and the king in charge and the king is the ruler and the kingdoms gave instructions and the kingdom gives erections hold the king of armies they came here back up in this Kingdom what can the Lord has shout we are protection in this Kingdom the king is the man that is in charge not the democracy is that one vote one man okay the Lord has shouting the house well Gloria God you have fought in and fought around this King this is the king of king and the Lord of lords when we come back riding we riding with him walk glory to God we shall crown him king of King and Lord of lords oh give the Lord some praises my my mind let's continue hallelujah praise God glory to God when I see that like what happened in the Grammy's here in the car with the foolishness I said if they doing the devil worshiping and somebody sent some note there yeah yeah if they're doing the devil ship publicly and openly why we can worship God publicly and openly right because in Liberty to worship God in the way called heresy not really message so not that kind of messaging message can I worship we're not in that like even again you've got a tip again yeah good yeah we don't want that go man take that take that home with you when John when them fall beasts when them 24 Elders so the lamb take the book man all wrong went and drunk praise God well you see fixing me wrong praise God fixing what Chrome you're talking about lamb pick the book we shall reign on the earth and thousands time thousands heard I John praise God and this message will they told me to praise God praise God a woman sit and stay and not like it is hopes okay the Lord I shout they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth we lost the truth William Branham restore the truth now we have to treat and when we connect to the spirit we can have genuine King land worship what can the Lord I shouting us Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God so watch this they're trying to pervert the world converting the one great uh big Union on Nations or Brotherhood it would be under a man-made disguisement it will have a leader it would be the devil because he's the leader of all of them look at Israel God leads in Israel the anointing is there fires their power is there they come to Samuel said give us a man why because I see this country have a man the son of a man that one of a man we want a message Man winter Pope man what am I in charge my God what a man Samuel was was shocked because God is the king would you want now God had a man coming or David was coming he said the one man giving us all right that's how they guess all want a man give him give them foreign Hallelujah sometimes people are lazy you know my God Luke 16 16. the kingdom of God is preached and some men every every man do what not a man come back I will tell you bro go home maybe this might be the only interesting trainers that people go you can remember bright members I've got people hungry tasty people want to live in reality people want to break out breakthrough bust out the prison glory to God they fed up things around them and they want to change there are people who do not want the change because they want to change you're going to act like it you're going to talk like it they're going to express it and you're going to walk into the change that you want foreign [Music] they just want to survive that's what I mean I mean one time he said very good he said no way did they eat somebody who's hungry and then he said way up to nothing here under here women and sleep no guidance no future no decision no prophecy nothing what a waste of life live and die like I never lived God's kingdom is not of this Earth God's kingdom is in our hearts it's a spiritual Kingdom and we are born into it Jesus said the kingdom of God comes but not without violence who said that Jesus said that look at all violence the violent take advice Force so they learn the kingdom to watch hey are you going I'm watching I'm watching Holy Queen some people say another music we hiding nothing look look keep watching you could see or we moving the kingdom is preached and every man that word is missing in the message so I had to press it as stressful it is terrible is devastating because people are spiritually contented by what they know intellectually they are I say this way they are intellectually satisfied but their soul is empty the Holy Spirit God's kingdom moving in the man and governing and controlling him that's the kingdom listen closely First Corinthians 4 20 says the kingdom of God is his word made Power if you want to put that down first Corinthians 4 20 the kingdom of God is God's word made Power other than that you're teaching patient message the Christian Bible you're preaching seed but the kingdom what's up with Kingdom is the word made Power what is the kingdom of God it's within you the kingdom in you and when the word comes in dear what does this word begin it turns itself into Power making it see just exactly what it said so the word said the spirit of God anointed me to do this that and the other that was written in Isaiah 61 Jesus found the place where it is written he came to the temple read the scripture and said this day what you're reading here is present tense this is living there's not a text this is a reality what can the Lord I shout on one of these days so glory to God one of these days that same thing gonna repeat it wouldn't be a text it wouldn't be a quote it will be a living reality the spirit is upon me because he anointed me to bring Good Tidings to preach the gospel of the Kingdom o glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory what is it get a bum now he had the fine print what is it you have got to get with the word and get yourself killed out you see all if all you preaching before because kill kill who killed out give me Nazi word yes many dynamics that was the calvary you mean somebody push it there you're duck in the cross you're ducking the calvary's hill you're ducking Dino to your filthy stinking self you're talking all of that but you still have to die if you want to press into the kingdom of God oh give the Lord a shout except a corner weed fall into the ground and and die it abides alone but if it dies Bring It Forward much fruit Oh Glory to God and hearing is my father glorified that you bring forth much fruit have no fruit without debt okay the Lord I shall come on Tabernacle has no fruit without death even means I tell you that he's lying he's a false prophet false Pastor false teacher false anointed once or give the Lord a shout it have no shortcuts you have to die to yourself head get to the Cross die out and then the world can flow through you you want to get man that he could say dear is my spirit flowing freely [Applause] that's what you want to get let's continue you've got to get with the word with the word face get yourself killed out I'm persuaded that many of us friends have received the Holy Ghost listen listen listen listen but yet but we have received enough holy ghost in us to make us to a place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but God wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to feel your thinking he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill every bit of you just make

another what is the sign of the coming of the end of the world when it's going to be I'll begin to tell them I'm still reading this gospel will be preached to every nation and Kingdom for witness unto me you know what he never said this gospel he didn't say go teach the word look at right here I this really teach us the night who will Relish in the teaching gift and a teaching position he pleases you to do what today people places the place they know who they are the stone dead the guy who joined John who saw the book taking watch he said this gospel he didn't say go teach the word but preach the word there's a lot of difference there's a lot of difference between preaching and teaching because they make fun of preachers you know you know he's preacher but preaching the mind the teacher bring the seed we just bring the water because the preachers have a channel to open up that the Holy Spirit can move in so they reject the preacher they reject the water that's why we have to have the gifts and people bringing inspiration and Revelation and the guest being being unfolded all right let's continue now we want to help you he never said this gospel he didn't say go teach the word but preach the word there's a lot of difference the gospel is the power and demonstration of the word artificial intelligence and all the explanations I haven't preach and they say nothing in the message I told him then God grace with thanks and not Prophet if I don't hear all that information you're peddling without anything from this message then God didn't have a prophet yes and you the inform us are we deleted I don't hear the latest you know I want to hear what is prophesied [Music] all the time the world when John come all day and John said the blast because foreign apricots taxes lately root I'm divorcer one time everybody do this damn day with this time but they know something moving when I see a man moving so they're radical somebody had me move it then they send some some men and say are you the one or should we look for another he said me your imaginations on lose his shoes when he call me baptized him with holy ghosts on fire Holy Ghost on Fire and we talking talking word no but he coming with fire you know I come to people everywhere that old Behavior can't change he come in he coming and anytime Messiah come and you have to make a way for him holy ghosts are coming and Jay that's why any upper room they were praising and thanking God because you have to make a way for the anointing to come down upon you okay the Lord and shout hallelujah foreign Hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah watch [Music] the holy spirit being poured out in the last days you believe it's been poured out poured out somebody is sowing seeds to bring forth this Latter-Day crop you know what Joel said the Holy Spirit has reported on what on seeds he know these seeds will have a Harvest Time Oh Glory to God Amen am I just stick inside of here talking about there's the guy this was preached after the starting perfect man he said don't forget now that these are the things that build the servant of Christ faithfuls don't vote you but remember the Holy Spirit cannot cap the building of God until these things are operating by the spirit so you put a qualifier here not operating by Revelation but by the spirit that means the spirit itself have to come to work the virtues not the Revelation that people choose not that Spirit has itself have to operate virtues now if we don't see these things we can't be shooting them if we don't catch this thing we can see they don't you know you have to see this this is the word now you know there's an eye preacher for 40 years what is that do you understand when Moses come and say take the blood and take the lamb all them post them fellas had with something and that Revelation and they serve on something like that that become null and void a man say yes he didn't let upon your blood because you're in a long time in the church and what doesn't think and Moses can come and tell them that he had taken that is eating self because you can't go back to you and claim some kind of historical thing you have to see what was present tense I'm presenting with lamb blood apply it because when I see the blood not man talk when I see the blood I will pass over you and today when you see the spirit operate him which is the token oh give the Lord some Praises you know where you're going I'm gonna pass when I see when you see I have books and tapes that's a lie and if he's just saying that they're lying to the people get out from them leave them and people run from the group somewhere and run out today get it past 30 days to repent if you don't repent we run for your life all right watch so watch until these things are operated by the spirit no matter what you do now those are the things that builds the body of Christ now don't forget that now foolish your faith virtue knowledge so forth it should be added to it until the complete status crisis made manifest then the Holy Spirit comes upon it and seals it as one body these things must be therefore Jesus said by their fruit they are known see fruit you could not bear fruit without these things they buried in you and then when all this takes the place of williness and ungodliness and so forth then all unbelief is cast out then all the things of the world is passed away then there's nothing but a new creature in Christ then Ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed to that day of your Redemption see healed into the kingdom of God so now the introduce a new word sealed in the Kingdom you press when you got silly and they know sealed into the kingdom he called out you become a seal seal of the Lord God when you have these virtues in you then the sons have Vindicated and placed oh then they become Vindicated sons and Vindicated daughters not just I believe the message no Vindicated Sons syndicated daughters this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased here I am because I'm with him I'm vindicating him really imagine oh my God that could be trouble keep that in mind now take these things first talking about these virtues right then the ceiling is the Holy Spirit now we have faith with your knowledge Temperance patience Godly spiritually kindness top of that half Holy Spirit slot the ceiling is the Holy Spirit the cup that seals us into the body what must we come out of doctrines that make the word of God of no effect people teaching but it have no effect on the people for change work or change life Matthew 15 79 Jesus busted them he said you Hypocrites well did his eyes prophesy of you saying these people join nigh unto me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but the heart is far for me what in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of man Prophet said he said no the bride has another Revival yet there have been a Revival there to no manifestation of goddess to the bride so he tied Revival with manifestation of God not Revelations not messages but but manifestation of God and this time with what he said he said what we see should make a church that will make a Revival people flying from everywhere he said the seven Thunders as being manifested yeah we say you know see Watch the Bride has not Revival yet they know you're ever there no manifestation of gods to the brain we are looking for it so if they're not preaching that day people look at it they hear every other thing about this we are looking for it it will take those seven Thunders back there to wake up again he will send it if you look for it you ain't gonna get it he said he will send it watch watch he was send it he promised it now what she was dead talking about the bride now if the churches would forget their greeds right now tonight forget their dogmas and take the Bible and plead the promise then it would become effective to them so once they get a promise and they say Lord you promise to heal me you promise to deliver me you promised to refine me you promised to fill me the Holy Ghost you promise and you can't lie Lord you have to keep your promise you are guilty until you bring your promise to pass foreign [Music] [Applause] God are feeling weak but you promised the people that know their God shall be strong and do good experts Lord yesterday the weak say I'm strong Lord I'm saying I'm strong I'm strong I'm strong I'm strong you said say it I'm speaking it I'm saying it I'm expressing it praise God you make confession intercession based upon our confession and confession my strength I'm confessing I'm alive I'm confessing I'm pressing on on on I will glory to God I'm confessing I'm Climbing Jacob's Ladder from Faith to Virtue the knowledge the tempers the patience the calling us the brotherly kindness I am pleading a promise I'm not saying I'd like a dumb dog in Israel I'm saying nothing I'm keeping silent I'm claiming my promises Oh Glory to God I'm eating the book I'm eating the words of the book I'm prophesying on my Deliverance I promise you breakthrough I am prophesied hallelujah praise God hallelujah Glory if the churches would forget their Creeds forget their dogmas and take the Bible and plead the promise it will become effective to them but Jesus said you with your Traditions make the word of God of non-effect Oh Glory to God hallelujah glory to God praise God praise God we are good tonight I'm on page 9 of 14 pages just a few more again oh glory to God so that man come to his friend and say oh gosh somebody come and visit me tonight I have no bread I have no juice I have nothing to serve them oh gosh Hallelujah I know he's my friend oh God help me out tonight now oh give me something give me something they're getting a partner inside my house I put on my pajamas Hallelujah already in bed I'll pull up my oh glory to God I was just about to snooze I am coming out a man expect him to take that and leave him but this man different this man she are still here you know knock knock I have nothing the shops close are still here man so God I ain't coming out we are friends but I ain't coming out this is fair enough friend but I'm still here there's not friendship now you know the desperation no I have nothing I can't go by nobody else this might have a big dog in front he hopes this man a protection and a steel gate and all kind of protection I can't go there's right here going and he stayed there so God I had to get rid of this man you know Mommy wants to take that take that hold that take that and don't come back that's okay I have it for I want and Jesus call that importunity call that persistence call that perseverance call after the bride shall not God avenge his elect who cried day and night after him when the Solomon cometh shall we find faith on the earth oh give the Lord some Praises somebody gonna press somebody gonna ask somebody gonna seek Glory press into the kingdom not just the same the kingdom is here but to get into it brother Branham they always hear people the time is here I see this you can brand me a fanatic if you wish to I believe that this indicates the second coming of Jesus Christ for there will be signs and wonders and the thing of it is if you are not in the kingdom of God press into it surely I would have some knowledge of what I'm speaking of God would never honor my prayer to do what he does and you outside the kingdom seek Christ as your Refuge while it is time while you have the opportunity the kingdom desperation when those secrecy without all thy heart then I'll hear you the kingdom he said the law and the prophet until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and man presented you don't just turn around and say pick me up by the color Lord push me in you presented you get desperate between life and death Noah's family seeing that the father good man was spawning away his sons his daughters-in-law so far compound away with him behind the report of the word you always have to do that the kingdom of God doesn't come without trials if you don't want trials walk out go back forget our Holy Kingdom the kingdom of God doesn't come without trials men press into it into the kingdom of God not observation so that's the positive part we want to go to the negative part because Gospel of the Kingdom have two parts in it it have the power to save to deliver to redeem to get the last name on the book but there's another part which is to preach to the Eternal loss the same gospel of the Kingdom people that cannot change people who have crossed the line people who cannot be saved have to hear this gospel maybe not only here they're going to see it they might see it live on the internet you must eat some tape the gospel you can't kill the ministry it lives on you could put the messenger to sleep but you can't put the message it is on notice the third pull of his ministry the first was healing second was rebuking the organization and prophesying so prophecy comes under the second Pole Revolution can eat go to the angels give me a little book take it easy almost prophesy again prophecy is under the second pull his turtle was when he preached a loss that couldn't be saved no more they were done there big painted eyes preached to the souls in hell that did not accept mercy and there were eternally separate from the presence of God but yet they had to recognize it what he was because God was him that's there I wonder if this ministry climbs out the same way in this last day as my father sent me so send that you the works that I do shall do also he healed the sick his second Ministry he was prophesying his third Ministry was preaching to his laws what do we say the faithful Ministry is the ministry of Jesus Christ in the form of Pastor teacher Prophet evangelist apostle it's not man's Ministry it is Christ Ministry and Christ's Ministry had a first pull a second pull and a turtle so when Jesus said this gospel is going to be preached he himself will preach it it could be Jesus Christ back again in bright form okay the Lord some praises [Music] [Applause] it was Jesus saying the spirit is upon me it was Jesus stopping in the middle of the sentence to preach the acceptably of the Lord and it will be Jesus continuing to declare to the offensions of our God through our pride of Jesus it'll be Jesus doing that this same gospel one of these days if you haven't already you will cross that line you will never desire no more to do what is right did you hear what I just said brother sister do you realize what's been said you will cross that line you will never want to do it you will still hear the gospel sure you would never accept it you can't accept it but the gospel will be preached to the doomed those that are eternally lost can't get saved no more you already in that spot and don't know it you think you are living in pleasure I'm dead while you're alive what was amazing me I had this message prepared and I took a rest took a rest before coming up and so on and as I woke up this came to me that I have to put this in and ashamed of my wife I said it's amazing I was able to take a rest I want to get up just getting up and she put this eternal loss inside of here because this is fact this is completed about this gospel to be preached because it's showing you who is preaching to oh hallelujah praise God listen all the order the gospels preached the Doom first before they went no one shut up with the testimony God shut the door remember do not preach 120 years then God shut the door and for seven days he asked today and everybody didn't let the community act now don't shut knockout open for them a good cousin a good auntie a good family you want to come in too late though shot the ACT preached to the Doom the people All Through the Ages watch Hallelujah after the tooth pull that Sodom the door was shut there was no more Mercy ten couldn't be found the lost articles were preach and could not be saved not by speaking in tongues not by dancing in the spirit not by joining church but by fruit of the spirit the word living there it is if they only had looked he was the Messiah he was the Living Word made manifest and a man that got the spirit of God in him a woman lives that word right out in them that's the heartbeat the predestinated for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word of the people wait a minute comes to the bride yeah you better believe it Oh Glory to God they are the word to the people written Epistles whether or men [Applause] now remember nor was in the ark the bride is sealing with Christ the last member has been redeemed the six seal that produce itself the seventh seal brings him back to Earth the lamb come and took the book or the right of him that sat down and claim that he owned what he had redeemed it's always been that tooth pulled tree is perfection all this is in soldier in prison the ministry comes to it when it reproduced trial among human beings so it's about faithful Ministry and Ministry and Ministry he talked about the ministry come into Perfection when Christ is reproduced he has said Christ has to be reproduced to identify perfectionist back okay if you don't make you shout I don't know what will Hallelujah [Applause] or think people going right on preaching thinking they're getting people safe believing they're doing right believing the organization are growing not eating my way of Hope if that Vision was that and it has been so hard against women we have come to that our door is closed gone already the book in his hands Lord Jesus closing this part of I have done the best that I know how I've done all that I know how Grant Lord that the mercy doors are still open I plea with all my heart as we see not only somebody talking but the scripture itself bringing us to this R and that vision of a little boy seeing those people in that condition and how thing that hell itself Mercy has been plotted from the earth and now ill itself is here and the people Lord are in a hideous condition your spring you say almighty God on this elected church I pray God that you'll pour out your blessings that they might receive a Ministry of testimony like lot had like Noah had like Jesus had unto the Eternal lost if it be there that day themselves are sealed into the kingdom of God and given witness to Jesus Christ being the same yesterday today and forever granted Lord may you receive our petition we plea in Jesus name then he said this here it may be almost past feeling time because there will come a time like that when the spirit of God will be retaken from the Earth there will be no more the church will remain a while that's right preaching cause it has to preach to the Eternal laws just as every Ministry did coming down to the age the last part musician God please of every Ministry preached to Eastern and lost and there will be a Ministry now that will preach to the Eternal loss after they have refused to receive it and are about done here Oh Glory to God Jesus in Luke 24 44. the Bible said and he said unto them these are the words which I speak unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets another Psalms considered me then open he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written does it behoove Christ has suffer to rise from the designated day that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations begin to Jerusalem and yet Witnesses
