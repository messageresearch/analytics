loud your spirit covers the earth but amidst all of that there's an elect they call her the elect lady and father we trust and pray that that elect lady is here this morning Father God may you minister to your people and meet the every need we know we live in difficult times times hell have en larg his mouth and streams of demon powers have been loose on the Earth but Lord you loosed the Angels Lord you Loos the Seven Seals you Loos your presence and your power that we could be empowered to live in a such a time as this such a stressful distressful time but we thank you for being

thanks so much for being here amen and if you have your Bibles I like you to turn to two pors of the scripture Matthew chapter 24 you want to read from 22 to 25 and Romans chapter 8 want to read from 28 to 33 looking forward for next Sunday yel is going to be here looking forward for a great time in the Lord amen praise God we are actually breaking into a new season praise be to Jesus amen praise God a new time okay Matthew chapter 24 reading verse 22 and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shorten and if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you before and Romans 8 want to read from verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn of among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify let's pray one more time father we thank you for you break the bread of life to us this morning in Jesus name we ask it amen you may be seated oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah thanks again for coming out and I trust then that you are fine in the Lord we're looking for what the Lord will do this morning amen praise God I trust you were edified by the special stuff we had on Friday in zoom and any parent here make sure your son and daughter listen to that message everybody in this church member this church should be listen to that thing on Pride cuz I believe it's a big thing that was riding me for a while and I just couldn't get over it until uh make that baby so it's something something Pride will hinder you from repenting from making things right from being reconciled Pride will affect marriages homes families pride is a terrible thing it's an evil thing Pride not humbling yourself and and pride have a visit coming with judgment God said when go UNP punish amen so Pride to have a way of God will bring you down be you humble yourself so even see Jesus he humble himself and became obedient and each one of us have to Humble ourselves and become obedient okay all right let's go um so I'll be reading some scriptures if you could find it if you want to find in the Bible and uh this is from Ezekiel chapter 36 uh moreover this from verse 16 of Ezekiel 36 moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land they defiled it by their own way and by their doings so sometimes your destiny have to do with the choices and decision you make the actions you take there are so many people blame others for where they are at and they have nobody else to blame but themselves let me say it again there are so many people blame others for where they at and they have no other person to blame but themselves this is God saying but they defiled it by their own way and by their d jins their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman wherefore I poured my Fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land for their Idols where it they had polluted it and I scattered them among the Heathen that they would disperse through the countries according to their way according to their doings I judged them and when they entered unto the Heathen whether they went they profane my holy name so he say you run out and when they go out the Heathen they still car with their foolishness they profound my Holy Name are you with me and they said to them these are the people of the Lord and are going out from his land the people busting them these are the people of the Lord I look they out of the land now but verse 21 but I had pity for mine holy nameall which the house of Israel had profaned among the Heen wether they went therefore say unto the House of Israel thus sayeth the Lord God I do this I do not this for your sake amen oh House of Israel but for my Holy Name sake which you have profaned among the Heathen whether you went and I will sanctify my great name which was profane among the Heathen which you have profaned in the midst of them and the Heathen shall know that I am the Lord sayth the Lord God when I shall be Sanctified in you before their eyes the same people that was run out the same people when they own way and carry on he said I will be Sanctified in you before the Hidden Eye oh I call you and chose you because I elected you you are different from the rest oh give the Lord some Praises you see we are going this morning you bride are different from the rest do you believe that okay and I verse 24 and I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and I will bring you into your own land then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your ftiness from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stone yet out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and caused you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land that I give to your fathers and ye shall be my people and I will be your God and I will save you from all your uncleanness I will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you I will multiply the fruit of the tree and increase of the Feld that he have received no more reproach of the famine among the heathen then shall you remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and shall Lo yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities for your Abominations not for your sake do I this say the Lord of God be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways oh House of Israel thus say the Lord God in the day that I have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities and the waste shall be builded in other words you're going back to your own land you're going back to what God ordained for you oh give the Lord some Praises he will do it for the elect sake Give the Lord some Praises that's my title this morning for the elect sake if you want to write it that's the title this man morning for the elect's sake oh blessed be the name of the Lord you we love him this morning this Romans 8 the amplifi I want to read that scripture back we are assured and know God being partner in their labor all things work together and are fitting into the plan for good to those who love God and are called According to which design and purpose so where you quarreling for where you fussing for where you're pointing your finger for where you arguing for all things work together for good job didn't ask God for a trial God touched Satan and said come look down on that man that is my man on the earth you can't touch him you could watch him but you can't touch him you can't get him to deny me praise God I put pressure on his family I put pressure on his children and he's still standing praise God I don't have another man like that on the earth Give the Lord some Praises when the devil come and this trial come and this testing come is to frustrate you and depress you and to upset you and to send you off track but you want to prove the devil is a liar praise God God put something inside of you it's built in he put it in you before the foundation of the world I want you to believe what we are preaching this morning I don't want you to believe your feelings I don't want you to believe your emotions I don't want you to believe what you have been through and the hell you have been through I want you to believe what God Said for we know all things work together for good to them that love God to them what be called according to his design and purpose remember the even verse 29 Amplified for those who he for knew of whom he was aware and Lov beforehand oh God this is good those he for knew whom he is aware and love beforehand he also destined from the beginning for ordaining them to be molded into the image of his son and share inwardly his likeness that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren and Those whom he had thus for ordained he also called and those he also called he also Justified and that word Justified is to be acquitted to be made righteous putting them into right standing with himself oh get you do I hear a shout in the house those who are are you called did God call you who he found you he called who he called he justified okay the Lord some PR care what your wife tell you what your husband tell you what this one tell you it doesn't matter what they say who he phone you he call who he call he justified which is to equit which is to make righteous and those who Justified he also glorified raising them to Heavenly dignity and condition of state of being what shall we say of all this if God be for us who can be against us who can be our foe if God is on our side he also did not withhold or spear his own son but give him up for us all will he not also with him freely and graciously give us all things who shall bring any charge against God's elect when it is God who justifies I don't care if you kill you murder you steal your Rob your this this adultery lie I don't care what you it's God that justifies God not man could justify man will remember every sin you did everything you commit but it's God that justify Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God hallelujah who shall bring any charge against God elect when it is God who justify that is who puts us in a right relation to himself who shall come forward and accuse or impeach Those whom God has chosen oh give the Lord there nobody could come andeat you accuse you point the finger at you they are liar because God is the one that justify it Oh Glory to God praise God praise praise God praise God so the Believers you I'm talking to you this morning you were chosen when before the foundation of the world by some Pastor by some evangelist by some teacher or Prophet no by God himself you were ordained before the foundation of the world isn't that right so watch now your source of election is in God's grace Give the Lord some praise that that is enough to make your shout your soul of your election is not your works it's nothing you could do have done or will do are you getting me nothing you could do will do or have done your source is God's grace who he found you he called oh God he knew you before therefore he called you isn't that right so your source of election is God's grace not your will is not him that will it for him that run but it's God that showeth Mercy isn't that right the praise for your sake has to do with your benefit your interest Hallelujah your good amen it imply sacrifice or hardship on the sake of someone else and Paul referred to his ministry as suffering for the sake of the church it is always for the benefit of God's people Jesus died for your sake he went to Calvary for your sake he went to get the but for your sake he went to die to redeem you it's all about you you are the object of his love you are the object of his election you are the object of his Redemption he come to redeem you to bring you out to the porn shop to buy out of Satan's hell to purchase you with a blood price oh give the Lord some Praises Hal for your sake for the elect sake oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise God praise God huah but BR this are one in a million he said this week the Lord willing I wish to speak I'll just skip a little bit okay the time and all we living if a person don't know which way to go what to do or how to turn you're not walking by feet anymore you're guessing you're presuming and to presume is to advance without official Authority so so so I want to say this let me put this inside here right now I am not here to say what you want to hear if I say what you want to hear that's politics that's what the politicians do they say what the people want to hear I say what God lead upon my heart to see so if you're not hearing what you want to hear we have a problem I don't you have a problem so if you have confidence that the spirit is leading you would watch to see what the spirit speaks expressly this morning and you'll have confidence that the operation of God is operating Among Us and God want to speak he would use his word to speak by oh blessed be the name of do you understand what he's saying so I'm not speaking what what what people want to hear what they're hearing outside I don't care what the busy with what the buzz is outside I have nothing to do with that you know if these Stars line up if the Pluto and Jupiter and Mars and people talk about Mars and Mars are talking about what happened in America and what happened in Putin and Russia I have nothing to do with that all I want to know is what God want his people to know this morning and this is what I get for you for the elect sake maybe you're not even feeling like a elect that's a lieon know the devil don't the devil going tell you you elected think about that devil the Devil is a revealer he didn't even know who Jesus was he asked the Christ if thou be he clueless so don't expect the devil to confirm who you are don't look for no unction from this Satan to confirm and vindicate who you are that not coming from the devil so anything negative come from the devil say shut up don't talk that to me my father is speaking to me this morning he is telling me who I am oh give the Lord some Praises we said it before when Prince Williams and and whoever The Prince and prin in in England when they have the baby the babies don't know there's prince and princess that to be taught that drop that same Prince

go into Romans 4 a little bit and verse one what shall we say then that Abram our fathers pertained to the flesh had found for if Abram was justified by works he had we of the glory but not before God but what said the scripture Abraham believed God it was counted for him for ousness and to him that worketh is reward not record of Grace but of debt but to him that worketh not here we go but believeth on him that justify the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness sir God has do what justify the ungodly Hallelujah even as David also described the blessedness of the man this is verse six unto whom God imputed righteousness without works without works saying blessed are they who in iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered remember what we said in the exaltation on Friday about the Publican and the Pharisee Pharisee went to pray both of them went to the house of God you know one went inside one was outside and the Pharisees said Lord I commit adulter forn I know fornicator know liar and whatnot I doing all my stuff and thing I righteous and what not I'm not even like that man outside there he's a a Publican a sinner man the man having head bow he said Lord help me have mercy upon me a sinner Jesus watching both praying hallu Jesus seeing both praying and Jesus said not me he said that man on the outside went away what say it out loud Justified that's as

free without a Bible without sitting inside the church you realize he Ain get baptized in Jesus name and he free well give the Lord a shout you realize that Pharisee inside was not justified he's a sinner on the inside oh phes actor he acting you know bless that they whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin come at this blessedness then upon circumcision only or upon uncircumcision also for we see that Faith was recogn reckoned to Abraham for righteousness Faith was counted as righteousness all right how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had being uncircumcised so before he got the Holy Ghost he had a faith to pull down the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost confirmed the faith that was in him because the Bible say Abraham believed God not man abrah believed God not his flesh Abraham believed God not his wife Abraham believed God come on now come on get get preach back to me somebody do you see what what just said there he didn't believe his

now I know I'm a grain of wheat because I am saved how do I do it look back and see what he predestinated long time ago by for knowledge he seen that I would love him so he made appropriation to his own son and through him that I might become from a to a green of wheat now where am I at now I'm saved I'm walking in the grace of God what does predestination look to Destiny where will he take me to where am I going there you are according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world is Ephesians that he should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto adoption predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pledge of his will what did he do he by for knowledge forsaw us knowing that he was a savior there was no Angels Elohim the self-existent one what and he was but in him was to be a savior what is he going to save there's nothing lost knowing that that he know that this great attribute in him would project something out yonder that he could save then when it did that by for knowledge he looked down he saw everyone that would accept it he saw it ahead who would accept it and then by doing so he said to save that and only way I can do that will come down myself and made flesh and take the sin of man upon him and die for him that I might be the one that's worship and he is God the object of worship isn't that right he becomes that lamb isn't that right so he saw the deceitfulness of Satan that what he would do so he put your name on there and he said that the Antichrist would be so religious so good such a fine fellow smart man righteous man that he would deceive the very elected if it was possible and it's impossible because their names were for ordained before the foundation

down to the Pentecostal and now he's doing what he's calling out the elect to make the lutherans he called out the elect out of the lutherans to make the wesan he called out the elect out of that to make up the Pentecostals and now here we go he's calling the elect Pentecostals out to make out make up the headstone to come into it to a very same kind of ministry jumpping right on it and God

same Spirit aha you get it you get it now you get it now you can have the same truth but not the same Spirit here we go you got to get this one this and hence persecuted the child that was the elect God did did not reprobate for the sake of reprobation he reprobated for the sake of the elect this is the bomb elect cannot persecute elect elect cannot harm elect it's the reprobates that persecute and destroy the elect because the reprobates are religious Oh Glory to God so somebody persecuting you there no bright member if somebody want the wrath of God to come upon you there a't no bright talking there praise God like the spirit of Esau like the spirit of Cain because elect elect elect calling for Mercy oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah praise God he said oh elect of God beware

burning they are all joining a work onto the churches that is The Binding soon the Gathering of the wheat will come but right now the two Spirits are at work in two Vines and he said when you begin to discern the two Spirits working in the framework of the church and that's why this morning God is calling out the elect oh praise God that elect lady praise God hallelujah Glory Hallelujah mus come please the Baptist have their Creeds and dogmas based on the word you can't shake them they say the apostolic days of Miracles are over and there's no baptism of the Holy Ghost So based upon the word they have their own interpretation and they're running with that isn't that right praise God hallelujah there it is the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begin to song The Mystery of God should be finished there it is he is sending a Vindicated Prophet he's sending a Prophet after 2,000 years he send someone so far from organization education world religion he will turn he will be God's mouthpiece and he will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring the elect of the last day and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him oh glory to God those elect with him will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works there's a bunch of elected people that God has brought out with this Prophet messenger Oh Glory to God the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is his own mouthpiece so God is Turing on her in the message he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in heard for Revelation 17 says the spirit in the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that bride will be rep created as of the first age he has cried out in this age you have the word you have more Bible than ever but you are not doing anything about it except dividing and hackling into pieces taking what you want leaving on what you don't want you are not interested in living it but debating it I would soon had a hot or cold if you were C and rejected it I would stand for that I would stand that but if you could get white heart to know his truth and live it I'd praise you for that oh praise God God still have a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride the voice of God will be in the bride oh I'm almost closing in very PL language the True Body of Christ is in the mind of God eternally do not express until each come forth in his own designated decrete season each must come in what own designated season as each member come forth and become expressed and took his place in the body thus
