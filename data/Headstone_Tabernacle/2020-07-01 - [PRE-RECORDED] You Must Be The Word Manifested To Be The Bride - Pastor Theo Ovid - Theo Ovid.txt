and the divine will of God it will stand kingdoms rise kingdoms fall but God will stand he said you raised a pharaoh to bring him down because God will expand oh you maybe see that praise God hallelujah why you think fear was the mightiest land the mightiest country the most industrial most advanced God wanted to challenge the most advanced country in the land so God made sure you raise up egypt big and powerful everybody is afraid of egypt every country feels the pharaoh of egypt who is like the evening and the morning star who is like unto pharaoh but lose the mud god the god of them

battles you struggle you have to struggle that's why he put us on the earth and if you understand that that's my told you be comfortable with being uncomfortable you have to struggle you have to feel uncomfortable you have to feel like you don't belong when God called Abraham out he calling out amount of people he did not know call him that country I've never been he said come on come on come on keep on walking keep on walking you meeting new people and you may I behavior new way in life a new way of worship and you kind of aggression a new determination a new sense of purpose Oh hallelujah lies shook from being comfortable where you are because God loves to do that get you out of your comfort zone make it stressful make it tough make it press and make it frustrating to see who is who colossal only way [Applause] that's why that's why teachers give tests that's why school give exams to filter who is who who plainly foolish kyle aachen playing games and so on and the tests come everybody got nervous i think it depends already is attention isn't that right it's within one oh I have a time period for the test is that forever ever ever no another time period so what you're going through our time period only the devil tie you up like if you condemned to be who you are because you're always what don't let the devil tie you up there's a time for everything I paint the born a time to die and the shout a time to break out the time to go free I plan to be loosed from your infirmity a time for you to be here a time for you to be sealed or give the Lord some praises at that time under heaven to everything under the Sun to be delivered I passed a wife mm ah time I pine for children to deliver get out boys I'll be deliver how long did ever gonna hold them [Applause] whoa hallelujah time hallelujah tired of blowing the girl hallelujah so this promise Lannister lived in the land of the Holy Spirit and this promised land is what is the promises of Holy Spirit I've poured my spirit as the promises not right and then Joshua told them clean up his lives look on via Wi-Fi yourself every one of you let no man come at his wife or within three days you see the glory of God it's a process of getting ready a lot of people you see the process caught God Moses presumed because his mother told him stuff that he was a special child and he was deliver intellectually he knew that but it didn't have the empowerment to do that and you have to be empowered to fulfill God's purpose that's why it's called virtue power for service not your service god city's power to be in service for the Lord that's when God put you in his service that's when he signing up and he ranked you and he put a little tag on you I don't know what that pretty tag on here and so on that you have rank no because they're not empowered then you could stop power to stop the demons that get out sue so take left stick left go right you this one go right you take left that's what Jesus had is not right for the Castro Devers he's not power to prophesy power to overcome for what to pray some of you can't pray in the top three and you can't breathe you can't talk long on the cell phone but you can free and you can't pray in the country and Camp Rica talk to God but when power come you are power to break the other power my water forgive and yet it's big one there's a big one coming off why would I say I'm sorry there's a big one in the people lots of people don't like that [Applause] look people don't like to say sorry because sorry means like you're wrong you don't be wrong so wanna be right so sorry means that you're little less than or you're lower down or you make a mistake maker oh you don't say sorry but sorry means your little is small we only so powerful yeah take a bucket of water and take your big fish and punch in that bucket of water and see the whole you mean when you put it out if you have a hole when you punch a bucket of water come on you're really powerful getting get that one take a bucket of water in it and take your fists and punch a hole and let's see we see a hole in the hole is there you are really powerful if the hole is not there yet come and we think the kind of power that you have so you have to be conscious of your littleness conscious how small we are conscious of the grace of God conscious if wasn't for the grace of God we couldn't be here this morning conscious of the blood of Jesus that died to redeem us and to reconcile us back to God because because we lost the connection and and God restore about the wireless connection and you don't have no room in charges to pee when your pre it's all wireless you do you don't have any connection to plug in and so on you didn't like to pay for the connection you just you just call on Jesus and the antenna is active hallelujah it's not shut down because when Adam fell he send angels to guard the tree but now he's an Angels to try to drive you back to the tree so God Lane is Wireless line is always alive and active nothing is a brick in a channel is when you're ready to call he's ready to answer that's why you got to be ready to pray Eila low and wild while you're waiting for the door to open up itself prism in the corridor come on organelle or some praises even if the door is not open yet and you in the corridor waitin to enter in and the door is not open yet let him hear you let them hear your worship your Thanksgiving let's all stand until God brings us this morning this thing I love him I love him because he first loved me as we approach the world this morning I loved him it was love him love the Lord not just come to church but love him he's a person he loves you this morning everybody I love it [Music] [Music] hallelujah thank you lord thank you lord [Music] at Congress tree Amen collisional Bibles with meters in John chapter 1 and sin John chapter 14 to portion of scriptures this morning send John one we want to read from 29 to 33 I said in John 14 from 12 to 21 the next day John Gigi's seeit Jesus coming unto him and said behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom I said after me commit a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore am I come baptizing with water and John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost riddance in John 14 hidden from those twelve verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if he shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither Lord him but he know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the wolves get me no more but he shall see me but because I live he shall live also at that day I shall know that I am and my father ye and me and I in you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I would love him I will manifest myself to him let's pray father we thank you for your holy word and Lord we are right under a promise of another comforter even the Spirit of Truth they were already comforted by Christ among them the Living Word but he promised another comforter which was the spirit to be indwelling in them Oh God released that comforter here this morning and fill every hungry heart in Jesus and I ask it amen and amen you may be seated o blessed be the name of the war thank you lord Oh blessed be the name of the Lord it's so good to have a praise in your heart you always have some of the time God and I think I saw unnoticed somebody said I'm once the above grown you have yes I'm in the pre-scored above the grown you are lies you still have health and strength yeah yup I've grown you have something to praise God about dinner so this morning our title you must be the word manifested to be the bride that's my title this morning you must be the word manifested to be the bride I have an inspiration until you are convinced you cannot be concerned until you are convinced you cannot be concerned now praise God so God will never be able watch we will never be able to have a church until God gets a foundation to lean on he will never build his church on a bunch of nonsense he has to come on his word or he wound won't come at all isn't that right I'm only building y'all is close at hand when you wanna see something happen when something's gonna take place and all this background here has only been laying a foundation for a short quick message that will shake the whole nation so for God to build for gota I had forgot the work they have to be a foundation from the work with isn't that right and if God is to work with you there has to be a place prepared and that's why John the Baptist was sent he was sent to prepare please for Messiah so Gordon always have preparation made he doesn't just come he come on what has been prepared isn't that right now it's in John 6:63 it says it's a spirit equipment the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak they are spirit and their life Jesus is saying words are also spirit words are also life it's not just words no watch first John 5:6 s this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood it is the spirit that bear witness because the Spirit is truth not information spirit is truth that's why in court you said speak the whole truth nothing but the truth and so help me go on and so on because it have whole truth and you could speak something that goes beyond what is true things that you want to call it and flavor it with so they asks you to speak the whole truth and not take but the truth isn't that right so when gia say I am the way and the truth he's not just talking on my letter standpoint he's talking about the spirit itself so it's not just words it's spirit life makes the truth and Jesus said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free now a lot of people know the words a lot of people know what is right and what is wrong but they're not empowered to live what is right so when he said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free he's not talking about something intellectual he's not talking about some understanding he's talking about that spirit that comes inside of you to release you from your past to release you from your sin to release you from your guilt and set you free and who the son of man set free is free indeed Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so true come to release you [Applause] isn't that right now look it for and when much people were gathered together they would come to him out of every CD speaker parable I saw a window to the soul he sowed some fell by the wayside it was strutting down falls of the air devoured it some fell upon a rock soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture some fell among thorns that one sprang up and choked it others fell on good ground sprang up their fruit a hundredfold when he had said these things he cried he had ear so hear let him hear and the disciples asked him saying what might this probably and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but unto others in parables a seein they might not see and hearing they might not understand so a parable Israeli hidden mysteries filled as stories but in them of hidden truths to be revealed to his elected which is the children of the kingdom isn't that right so then Jesus began to interpret that he's unto you is given to know the mysteries he said now the parable is this the seed is the word of God now watch he said my words and spirit my words are life but now he said my word is a seeded so gore-tex spirit make it work take word make a seed and that seed is what comes into you could we get a lot of praise those by the wayside did not hear then come at the devil take it out of the word out of their hearts please they should believe and be saved then the rock a day when they hear we see there will be joy but they have no root which for a while believe in time of temptation following and that which fell among thorns a day which when they could go forth and a chopped but cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection but that ungood groan are they which here we go which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience fruit with patience Oh hallelujah the husbandmen waited for the rain waited petitions for the fruit of the earth to come forth Oh hallelujah this is not instant because Karate not a gift characters of victory and character means that you went through something so God is interested in you going through something and not asking him to take you out of something but asking you to help you give the grace to go true the stuff that you need to go true in order to have character because character is not a blessing from the Lord the rocket is a victory okay yes I'm praises in the house [Applause] so godson this unspoken regional seed was his example seed and that's why when we want to look at the template we look to Jesus when we look to see how God handle his sons and treat his sons we look to Jesus because he was the example seat son and when Jesus received the spirit we know when Jesus went Jesus did no wheantr for the advertisement on papers and said here am i I'm the Messiah Jesus was led by the spirit into the wilderness for his place of trying to be tested by the word dry word and Jesus overcame but it is written now I'm feeling this he had no feeling to feel it was dry it was desert all that was awkward it is written it is written it is written you feel something I have no feeling in this it is written it is written it is written and when the Devastator caught it is also returned oh God are you with me now so this was the example seed son behavior an operation so watch what his life was when the Spirit poured upon him after his baptism and the Holy Ghost came upon him the very life that he produced that same here we go that same water in spirit of the Holy Ghost will bring forth the same kind of life doing the same thing that he did so now we find out the Spirit is also water in spirit so the Holy Ghost is the water in spirit and if you have the water in spirit that spirit coming for seed that means that gorgeous added water to water no you have to have seed for that water in spirit to come upon and if that water in spirit come upon that seed something has to take place because water and seed does connect a certain way something has happened when water strikes Edith or give a lot some praises people so you ever see this dry it looks like it's dead it has no power in it it looks like it's just a seed lay in there that could be an oak tree that could be a coconut tree whatever it is it's looking drab you can walk past it you could store it in the cupboard you could lay there for years but if you only let water touch it is the only that water come on it if you only let that water and spirit try to see something gonna happen because she's in my where life is disappearing that brick left oh so you have to sit here I'm getting to spill it when you understand that nothing gonna stop you from worshipping when you understand that nothing gonna stop you from praising your God because it's the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah do you understand so there's a bit of teaching this morning the word is a seed no watch watch so what's the same water and spirit of the Holy Ghost will bring forth the same kind of life doing the same thing that he did if it is if it's the same seed Son of God seed will bring forth a son of God seed and I was every seed after skåne according to Genesis 111 such son our God see reproduced on a gourd seed isn't that right no Jesus already prophesy and reread it's in John 14:12 the same rose I do I'm not hearing it now you do also so what does Jesus saying the same see that I have going to be inside of you and a water and spirit gonna come upon him and the same life that I have gonna be living in he'll understand what's that I did you gonna do too [Applause] Oh could we pack the loss of that let me praise God for that do you understand all the same we'll see that you're gonna do it's not you trying something is that you experimenting with something it's another comforter Oh hallelujah that going to abide with you forever okay now watch see what it is that why I believe the wood is a seed and if the rain falls upon the seed it will bring forth after its kind hallelu the Holy Spirit will water and bring forth that seed it's the water to the seed and if the seed has been planted and the water falls on you Oh hallelujah it always the spirit going to fall on planted when the spirit not falling on this Bible this Bible forgetting you come on oh come on oh come on oh so God have to wrap the Bible up in a capstone revelation [Applause] you will be seated now only three Bibles the zodiac the pyramid and this Bible with this physical Bible is the Bible so when this Bible becomes that Bible and that Bible comes inside of you then that becomes the full seed inside of you then the seventh under Revelation is the capstone revelation of the entire Bible and must saw Jesus Christ any revelation that doesn't reveal Jesus Christ is the wrong revelation Oh God this is Jesus Christ that's the life that Jesus had or worship him this morning give the Lord some praise this morning that's the life that Jesus had hallelujah hallelujah that's that's the Tunde that's the the devil voice gonna come alive a living faith I live in virtue I live in knowledge I live in temperance our limitations that's the voice not gonna come alive that's the points of God that's what 0 heard let my people call it was more than words it was the voice of God Oh hallelujah once more the world will hear direct from God what will it be it will be the voice of God in the last days and the spirit and the prophet and the bride will say the same thing I'm the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing there shall be a final voice you will find our age thundering voices seven living voices oh seven voices the the devil's Kingdom gimmick incision God devil saw in the beginning I thought Genesis is the beginning and the beginning never sit down to mess up bodies and the mess aborts beautiful children Adam and Eve hallelujah first Adam spirit man no Fleshman no man to till the soil there was no man to till the soil there was no Dutchman the Bible said God formed man in his own image and the Bible said part is the spirit therefore God formed spirit man man was floating like the spirit non-physical man they tilled the soil but then God took some dust and the Bible said God formed man out of the dust of the earth he took some calcium he took some potage any poo for a man standing there i me put the spirit man into that - man and man became a living soul that's why when people die you get dust the dust and ashes to ashes because you come from the dust Oh hallelujah glory the crap all right give the Lord some praises people you maybe see that that is why when God wanted to redeem man yes I cannot process it was a hidden mystery of why the world was flooded in the days of Noah what people don't understand it wasn't just a flood it was a water baptism the baptized yet that was about to be redeemed because God redeems the earth the same way he redeems the individual so a Noah there it was baptized of water [Applause] and Jesus day his blood sanctify deity and fire come in all whole week all week on the front page at Yahoo they talking about World War II how Putin tracked me say within two days he could invade more

your Western pop your shoulder I hope you occurrence because long time I have to be older I was two routines in years man improving a new church well over the life boy shuttle of how he about that you

God you already blessed shout for that person in your soul Gorgona value yes don't want to seal you robbing to fill you hallelujah I didn't make the promise I'm not saying that that but all of it said that Jesus said he said I'm gonna give you another comforter I don't know no scrip they said if I don't go there covered up will not come I've got to go for the top another come you have to cut the cross over Jordana you got the cross on the word into the spirit we need people are convinced of these promises convinced that God gonna keep his word convinced what what Omega almond like Abraham testify he go have a son I know he's my business behind could be look he was convinced it was we use to him it was a revelation to him give him his wife laughs but Gordon talk to his wife go talk to him so because his wife was laughing he had a fear for himself and also if he not allow her to choice veered off then all for long if if Abraham was an emotional man man pooty I put like a fleshly can a man how many wives say boy you know you believe that you see how old I am you will get up in that but but the thing about it is that Sarah end up tying up Abraham to go is here because she believed that the interpretation had to come that way but God says true Sarah device is have no other interpretation than that that is whole I'm saying it is a know what a woman is true Sarah that is my main concern in this issue and of course it true you come on [Applause] [Music] that claps also have Hartigan week you laugh and just like Sara Dolan attends might tie you up in all tents piping at you report you know five senses we flash and five thousand is word see taste smell touch feel imagination concern images you listen them spice then slice because you can make it you see you up last night

senses off imagination you have none do with this function to even raise his head memories don't even bring back anything at the pass and feelings you better take a seat this morning because I believe the word so you put all them senses in your place [Applause] I'm telling marginese and don't even think about it I am not imagining nothing about it God said so I'm gonna be Phil I'm gonna be sealed [Applause] so we look good let them let us take the heads off those dogs off hallelujah then you are free you don't move you're not motivated by your feelings and their emotions and your conscience and your memory and your affection and your reasoning you're motivated by the promise of God because John was so convinced of the expectation and fulfill the promise John said ever is one standing among you I don't know who he is but he's gonna baptize you at fire [Applause] what what what would make John say that he was convinced he was so convinced now you begin to speak at present tense he said I don't know him but the one who pulled me to baptize with water pull me the one like to see the spirit coming on and remaining on him that is the one I put the baptized with the Holy Ghost John listen John live in my feet push on my feet he don't know if Jesus told that she asked in fact in he don't know what he does look like he don't know what they promise look like all you know the one who told unto the baptized told him that the one you see the spirit so John only look at the spirit he is baptizing was looking for spirit he is caring would only give a spirit he is baptizing on preaching was he looking for the spirit it was somebody that the Spirit will come upon you it was some son that what I said I am please some man somewhere some son somewhere somebody in your quads on me please with descend on that table but a speaker gonna do it God promised head somebody so Melanie yeah but I have to come to hallelujah I said kiss is my son [Applause] if you're not convinced just come to church you cannot convince they go home and you just the same way but when you're convinced you make the Parisian come on come on out you you you have some family overseas and haven't been internet for a long time and they call you a tree for days and say I'm coming on Wednesday I'm coming to visit you and and you see you're sure see you playing games I'm not sure you gonna come say

gonna carry them because they come in to have a time and you were gonna be jack volume and you will be welcome at a gonna be your guests [Applause] look you might be seated John was so disconnected to the numbers of people coming to get baptized that would impress a human experiment spirit pasta the amount of people under get baptized or what a blessing I spent he likes paradise 20 votes I spent the people they spent in membership and so on John said you better pay for root fruit meat the repentance the access later every three John only roughing it up some I said John cool it now yes you coming on daddy Pharisees brought a yellow cap preach so this morning you know you're not man coming on get baptized he's the right reverend something neighbor uncle where is in and this one is a wife one now Anna listen the Pharisees saw John's behavior he knew something was amiss so they say they say they say they say who are you you the Messiah or should we look for another John said no I am the voice of one and the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord go read your Bible Isaiah 43 so John was putting myself in the scriptures just ever read that that's me could you could you read a book and say that's you come on out come on [Applause] cup is placed in Christ John could say go and read about me in Isaiah 40 when I want you to find where you are written come on you should be screaming on that one after a while you will find that you are written because you are the words of the book come on I'm in the word this morning Oh glory to God your time so when John took the book you were the words in the book and his words and spirit and life isn't that right so you are just bypass rocky often II come nominee earns to be pestered and tempted but now send John 14:21 you're gonna know I'm in the Father you and me and I know you're gonna get a revelation of who you are where it comes from we're going and you will know as you are known oh man god bless you so real seed of God is absorbent to the spirit isn't that right when God there we go on his word becomes one that is when God's Spirit waters the seed of God it produces God it's not the individual it is God you are dead you are not yourself no more you reckon yourself dead hollowed out waiting for see Joe then what is it it isn't you no more it isn't a man it's caught in the man it's the see Jim like the beginning spoken word God spoken word made manifest in the man then it isn't a man it's the man that died Oh hallelujah and then Christ come alive Christ means The Anointed One a man that was anointed Oh hallelujah and Cordwell in him what was it the gym with the flesh The Anointed One the flesh been anointed with the Spirit of God produced the Word of God made manifest the flesh so Jesus was the flesh of God the word he was the word but he needed a spirit to come upon him to make it manifest so the fullness of the Spirit came down upon that son you are not gonna get the fullness you are gonna get your measure or get a lot some praises people hallelujah Jesus receive the fullness but you receive the measure just like the ocean just like the water in the ocean you tickler spoonful of water and you have all the ocean there the contents of it if you take chemicals of the ocean water you have in a spoon the same content of that spoon of water is what is in the ocean you are not the ocean the what the content is what you have so when you have a little bit of Gordon you all that was in good all the content of God all in mechanics Andy because of God is inside of you also God is God you didn't know what I'm saying you have the chemistry of God inside of you a little oh my god is God inside of you hallelujah like the fullness but you have a measure a measure of power a measure of overcoming a measure of witness hallelujah a measure of strength Oh [Applause] [Music] glory hallelujah so listen is so watch Sudan watch now Christ meaning it right the anointed one flesh be annoyed with the spread of copies would have God he here we go he was God's Word made manifest and now he died here we go in order to pay the debt of your high Breeden that you could die to yourself until you are no more yourself but be filled with his word believe in his word then the Holy Spirit that was in him comes down to water that word to make it grow so you see all this money gospel all this blessing gospel it can't work because all the blessing doesn't give character it has to come to a place that's why I get it I'll just say it the dynamics have to drive the people to Calvary people need to die who do you hear sin I hate myself but all these selfie cameras have known it they can picture up themselves then love themselves and then technology come to make it even help deserves or more than they have selfies people love themselves but job see I hate myself I repent in dust and ashes it's a stripping of self that man must come to which is the cross because only they already meet Jesus is only do you get the bridger into the Holy Ghost your restore - even by the altar and through the altar [Applause] so much that he might reconcile us back to be sons and daughters of God that true the church true the church might flow the same life by the word continuing listen the word made being manifested as it was in Christ Christ was God's Word made manifest senator after me Christ was God's Word made manifest said again Christ was God's Word made manifest so therefore the pride gonna be the word made manifest because he is father Christ not just the word not just the word so this this is to shake the babies of the abundance and make them show where the pacifiers but you can't just sit here believe in the word the would have to become manifested in your life but because the Lord some phrases you must be convinced of that that you want your wife to see it the word hanging out to you she must jump as a woman are you I'm IRA you long enough I know your behavior I know your walk I know your talk so you see what I see in there I go in and pray that is the effect of that that that is the effect when when the husband started get in the groove of the word wife the chapter pray because she started see God then she said I see God whose the note and you don't wanna cross that you hear I mean you you want to walk right what about the wife no husband offbeat and she said a manifest Christ it's time for he Dupree because he know he can cross that nice going you see be honest see that was it says we receive Jesus that we receive Jesus good wishes Jesus we see man long enough 40 years we see the parade of the beef I call it the parade of flesh and blood there's no need for beef buried you know but there's no need for fresh parade we need to see Jesus and Jesus somebody ought to die somebody have to die and he gonna sing Christ somebody died in Christ another favor Christ not a flavor and somebody paint something on yourself I have a button Christ anybody will come on a button Christ we're not talking about new testimony Christ to be putting in the post box no we're talking about a life that begins to flow future begins to flow a power begins to flow as about the periphery second power comes there when you come into a sickroom as you walk in the devil's in that sick room of sickness that devil is no time to leave let's get ready to get your head rhythm we have to go know how the devil is talking that I'd ever say let's go let's go they are coming they are coming they're coming we feel them coming nearer because virtue is emanating all along you put your power as you walk into the hospital room as you walk into the sickroom a power is going inside of there with you and them Devils know to eject except take the leave and then leave before you even get there about ended kept there is time to pronounce the blessings of God don't you want to see that I wanna see that don't you want to see that that's what God promised a perfect Church walk in an order Oh hallelujah okay let's continue you know now watch watch and he died he give his life that he might send the spirit take his body up and send the spirit back to water pay the redeeming price he that believeth on me then he comes the Holy Spirit to water the same world now watch the word itself was lost to the ages so when the Spirit come the spirit couldn't come to water the word because the wood itself was lost so God has to come the gada of the scattered world and tie up the loose ends to restore the seed of God back again so all that luta left off khalood ability was justified by they were still drinking beer and smoking there wasnt sanctified they were saved because the word for that time was justification then Wesley command said you can't just be saved and smoking and drinking clean up get sanctified and Wesley brought this an invocation message and they went on further isn't that right so in every age had loose ends had things that wasn't clean and clear after it was sanctified like a washed glass here come the Pentecostals God poured his spirit and then the field is speaking tongues and so on that's as far as they go sell a baby stuff and they play with the gifts and so on and here comes a prophet to bring the word now because the word comes the Prophet the word don't come to a pope the word doesn't come to a church it will tell you the denomination the word of the Lord came unto Noah do whatever Lord came unto Moses the world the Lord came in the desire write the word of the Lord came under William Irene Branham a 20th century prophet according to Mark I for behold I send you Elijah the prophet it's not right so the word came to a prophet to the Prophet about the word before word hallelujah so that would had to become a seed again so the first part of our ministry was tying up loose ends are you at me the first part of his ministry was tying up six yields of loose ends just going back and dealing with Genesis serpent seed and all different stuff he's gotta clean that up and then he had a message for the bride which was seven thunders that were kind of the brain was should about how to be peer would give the bride feet would utter to the bride would give the beer by revival you know was he had a special message for the bride not not wasn't his message because the Lord Himself he said with a shout so the Lord Himself which was the husband the revealed word came for his wife gonna send somebody he said Malachi 4:2 call out a bride but he descended with the message himself when you get a wedding invitation is a message that is a piece of cardboard or paper or whatever in between inviting you to a wedding it's written but that's what Bertram was he came as a messenger to bring the invitation to the wedding supper of the Lamb hallelujah for the bride to get a call to respond is not right so the seventh under is an invitation of life so your life to be changed God is not forcing anything about on you you could see a church member if you want you could say ordinary if you want or you could be like Samsung but the Spirit came upon him you you and I said you could still ordinary or you could be like Samsung Samsung was not ordinary he had seven locks he had seven thunders yet seven virtues he had several mysteries he had seven voices you ever seen Roy's seven locks was the key to his power and strength that was sealed as a mystery to Samson alone Samson alone held the secret of the power that he had no Samson wasn't a big small muscular man like what you see on papers and Biggles honk-honk muscles that will be this around other God become Adam and strong that way moving this ominous sound was an ordinary guy but when the Spirit come upon him he did some extraordinary things at one time the court Samson inside and they closed the gate you know how to greet those hands big gates Samson take off the gate with the pose and carried on a hill Samson didn't even bother to even check to see the days of heavy Decatur's he just take the gate open opposing continue or can attack the gate they can lock sounds male Samson beaten lion Samson some thousand men get and be done with Samson was just different why the Spirit came upon him hallelujah and activated the power inside of her spirit he was a channel to which God could through through when God sees Samson God said here is my spirit flowing freely or I could use him I could work here the devil sat down in his boardroom and said this cannot continue week although this month umpires get a plan Cola his agent get the spies interview Delilah in the spirit realm I'm still undecided set a honey trap they call it for Samson honey trap did I not looking good walking good talking good and Samson get activated with like in Delilah that was the beginning of his fall but God had another plan besides the devil of a plan God was planning on top of his plan because God had a plan to put something in the right position to get more results that he could ever get before so why the devil is working God see moving so I remove so let's move let the battle roll you may be seated here Delilah says Samson ways a secret some subtle play games with Delilah retire Cordova lose my strength tie the cord he break it he laughing it's a joke film because even though he Lyon the power still there with him because God has saved a lie there'll be no power cause it look at the heel and the power will be with you to break this secret keep it silent don't let the devil know nothing about it Sampson sided one of her games and so on and on Delilah where I'm wrong and I we devil doesn't know where we you dog until Samson decided to give away the secret he bricked that seal of silence over his life of the secret of his power give it to the liner and the liner no fully anointed get him and cut off his locks and Samson wake up as if you're gonna wake up at power i'll only recognize the par was not there he was ordinary hope you understand this you Christians sitting here with all gods Greece and presence and power you are ordinary so really come with a grateful heart have a graceful heart a grateful heart a thankful heart you may not be where you wanna be no but be grateful don't act arrogant and rude as if God or you something so don't even want the story the bind Samson dig out his eyes something's not blind I'll go out watching something that some years to go to his stuff except this grinding but go I have a plan and afterwards they wanted the ten minutes it being on Samson my you see where you are doesn't mean where you wanna be that way devil understand and you have to understand your present condition doesn't mean that next two years or next six months you will be still being that condition so even though Samson was born let's say for five years Brian week that time the secret deluxe going back I will restore share the Lord directed cut some but not all he kept going any routes because the routes gone too deep you see the devil only came in the beginning but you were before the beginning the devil that only stopped when he didn't he gonna dick opted in the beginning but was he breached in the beginning he can't go beyond that but when week ago before there was a beginning we before the foundation of the world we could we have our roots but deeper than in the beginning so that there was only cut off in the beginning but Samson had deeper roots than that so those roots brought back the here it brought back the strength it brought back the word it brought back the cedar but there was no visible evidence of power they thought was the same weak man that he was five years ago they thought he was the same weak man he was seven eight ten years ago but this time what was restored the word was restored he was waitin for the water in spirit of the Holy Ghost but more than that he was written to be positionally please please in Christ hallelujah you may be seated so here comes Samsung the entertainment people they call him to entertain the crowd three thousand plus people and stuff isn't that right and then I said bring em used to be servant of God used to kill lion used to be feared bring on one time former champion for all X Holy Ghost man X powerful man X man on fire x-man pressing unseen in and bring him out guys are biscuit dezer dawn and look at him let's have a good love little did this each with succubus eyes the tears the didn't see the tears something wasn't even for himself he was convinced the word was restored he was convinced of course tau he was convinced God is his father and he was concerned that he could bring glory to God once more once more once more he wanted to bring glory to God he fell but he wanted to bring Caray back to God it wasn't about Samsung it was about God it wasn't about Samsung it was about courts power God's presence caught omnipotence you may be seated [Applause] stripped powerful man led by a little boy he's

I'll find a better man god that's rays of kings and for those pulled on kings what does raise up people and for the shift people the angel of God is on the earth sits and things are wrong moving things are wrong for the kingdom of God for the coming of the Lord [Applause] friends you may be seated you can't serve God from a historical perspective you can't say you were blessed five years ago
