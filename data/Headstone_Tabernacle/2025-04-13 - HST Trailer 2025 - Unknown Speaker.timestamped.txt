[0:00] For by him were all things created that
[0:02] are in heaven and that are in earth,
[0:04] visible and invisible, whether they be
[0:07] thrones or dominions or principalities
[0:09] or powers. All things were created by
[0:13] him and for him. And he is before all
[0:16] things, and by him all things consist.
[0:23] And he is the head of the body, the
[0:25] church, who is the beginning, the
[0:27] firstborn from the dead, that in all
[0:30] things he might have the
[0:32] preeminence. In the church world today,
[0:35] there is two systems of work. And now
[0:37] listen, read your
[0:40] book. Now, let's see if you going to say
[0:42] amen on this. There's two systems
[0:46] working in the church world today. I'm
[0:48] going to get this off my shoulder and
[0:49] then I have it over with. We all know
[0:52] that. That's the word of God and the
[0:56] denominational system.
[0:58] There is the two systems at work. Just
[1:01] as it was Jacob and Esau,
[1:04] one end of the spirit, the other half of
[1:06] the flesh. And what is it? Esau and
[1:09] Jacob was fighting in the wombs of the
[1:12] mother even to the time they were born.
[1:15] And so is the
[1:17] denominationals and the word fighting
[1:19] one against the other. They have been
[1:21] since Luther first brought the first
[1:23] reformation. I hope that's simple enough
[1:25] that you can understand it. These men if
[1:28] they pick up this and go out with it,
[1:30] they can make more sense to it. See to
[1:32] bring it to a place you I just want to
[1:34] lay this seed. Hope they make it come to
[1:36] life. Whosoever shall call upon the name
[1:38] of the Lord shall be
[1:40] saved. How then shall they call on him
[1:43] in whom they have not believed? And how
[1:46] shall they believe in him of whom they
[1:48] have not heard?
[1:50] And how shall they hear without a
[1:53] preacher? And how shall they preach
[1:55] except they be sent? As it is written,
[1:58] how beautiful are the feet of them that
[2:00] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[2:02] glad tidings of good things.
[2:05] Now I believe that there's a church
[2:07] coming into that
[2:09] perfection, that ministry of
[2:13] perfection or the offices were apostles,
[2:17] prophets, teachers, pastors, evangelists
[2:19] for the perfecting of the church, them
[2:22] pastors and teachers and so forth to be
[2:24] so with the word until the whole thing
[2:26] will work right up to the coming of the
[2:28] Lord. I believe that and I believe we're
[2:31] nearing that time now.
[2:34] I believe so. That's right. If you're
[2:36] not called to the church or so forth,
[2:39] they are chosen by God, apostles.
[2:43] Second, prophets. Third, I may not have
[2:46] these lines just right. Third, I think,
[2:48] is teachers and evangelists and pastors.
[2:53] Five spiritual offices in the church to
[2:57] set the church in order. apostles,
[3:00] prophets, teachers, evangelists,
[3:02] pastors. Those are called offices by
[3:06] God. Then in the local congregation,
[3:08] there's nine spiritual gifts that work
[3:11] among the people. Now, in these offices
[3:15] and places in the offices, you hear from
[3:18] the apostle, his ministry. You hear from
[3:21] the prophet, his ministry, from the
[3:24] evangelist, from the teacher, from the
[3:27] pastor.
[3:28] Each has a separate ministry and their
[3:32] ministries is of God. God has set them
[3:34] in the church for this purpose.
[4:06] Heat. Heat.
