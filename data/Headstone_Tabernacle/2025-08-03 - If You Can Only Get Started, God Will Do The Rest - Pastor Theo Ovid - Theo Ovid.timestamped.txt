[24:18] Heal us this morning, Lord Jesus. Oh,
[24:21] with an outpouring of your presence
[24:24] and of your spirit this morning. Are you
[24:27] happy to be in God's house today?
[24:31] We happy to be alive,
[24:34] to be found alive in his grace.
[24:38] Amen. He had preserved our soul. Amen.
[24:41] We are grateful this morning to be in
[24:44] the land of the living. God bless you
[24:46] and welcome to the house of the Lord.
[24:49] And if you have your Bibles, let's just
[24:51] turn to Psalms 121.
[24:54] Psalms 121 for a scripture reading.
[24:59] um
[25:00] before we pray
[25:03] and ask God's blessing upon us this
[25:05] morning
[25:06] for the service.
[25:09] Psalms 121
[25:12] says, "I will lift up mine eyes unto the
[25:14] hills from whence cometh my help.
[25:19] My help cometh from the Lord which made
[25:22] heaven and earth.
[25:25] He will not suffer thy foot to be moved.
[25:28] He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
[25:32] Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall
[25:34] neither slumber nor sleep. For the Lord
[25:38] is thy keeper, and the Lord is thy shade
[25:42] upon thy right hand. The sun shall not
[25:47] smite thee by day, nor the moon by
[25:50] night. The Lord shall preserve thee from
[25:53] all evil.
[25:55] He shall preserve thy soul. The Lord
[25:59] shall preserve thy going out and thy
[26:02] coming in from this time forth and even
[26:05] forever more. May God add blessing to
[26:08] the ring of his word this morning.
[26:11] We say amen to it this morning. The Lord
[26:14] is thy keeper and he is thy shade. Is he
[26:17] your keeper this morning? Do you know
[26:19] you didn't keep yourself this morning?
[26:21] Do you know you didn't bring yourself to
[26:23] church this morning, but you are
[26:25] answering the call of the supernatural
[26:27] upon your soul? Let everything that had
[26:30] breath answer God this morning with a
[26:34] amen and with a hallelujah. For every
[26:37] knee shall bow and every tongue shall
[26:40] confess that he is Lord this morning. So
[26:42] we might as well give him all the glory
[26:45] and we might as well give him all the
[26:46] praise. Oh hallelujah. Because he is
[26:49] coming back for his earth. He is coming
[26:51] back for his people this morning. Let us
[26:54] give him praise and lift our hands in
[26:56] the sanctuary and give him glory and
[26:58] thank him and praise him as we pray and
[27:01] ask God's blessings this morning.
[27:03] Almighty God, we are happy to be in your
[27:06] house this morning. Lord, what can we
[27:09] say today, Lord Jesus? Lord, truly it is
[27:12] your grace and mercy that has brought us
[27:15] through. Lord, when we look back on the
[27:18] long road, Father, and all the things
[27:21] that we've been through, Lord, and all
[27:22] the things that we've seen, Lord, we
[27:25] know that we didn't call ourselves,
[27:27] Lord. It is you that have called us,
[27:29] Lord, Father, to glory and to virtue,
[27:32] Lord. But we thank you for the call of
[27:35] God upon our lives, Father. We come into
[27:38] this house today to praise you, to
[27:41] glorify you, to give you all the praise
[27:43] and all the thanks that is due unto your
[27:46] name, Lord Jesus. Lord, for every
[27:48] mountain you brought us over, and for
[27:51] every valley you brought us through,
[27:52] Lord Jesus, you deserve a shout, a
[27:56] praise from our lips, Lord, a sacrifice
[28:00] of worship in the house of God because
[28:03] you did it all for us this morning. We
[28:05] couldn't do it ourselves, oh God. In
[28:08] every situation, you have proven
[28:10] yourself strong. May you prove yourself
[28:13] strong again this morning, Lord. And may
[28:15] you anoint your people for service,
[28:17] Lord. Anoint our worship. Bless us as we
[28:20] come into this place, Lord. Bless those
[28:22] that might still be on their way even.
[28:24] We pray you bless them as they come in.
[28:26] Father, and may you anoint them and
[28:28] inspire them as they come to worship, to
[28:30] bow before the feet of him that created
[28:32] us and to give you all the glory for
[28:34] what you're about to do in this season,
[28:36] Lord. Your great mighty release of
[28:39] dynamics upon the bride in the last day.
[28:41] Father, may you anoint your servant
[28:43] today, Father, as he steps into the
[28:44] pulpit to minister the word of God.
[28:47] Lord, may he be met with angelic
[28:49] presence, oh God. Father, may the pillar
[28:51] of fire swoop over us this morning in a
[28:54] mighty and supernatural way. Father, may
[28:57] you engulf this place with fire this
[29:00] morning. Engulfed with anointing,
[29:02] Father, may people be healed while the
[29:05] world is going forth. May people be
[29:07] anointed. May chains break off of them.
[29:10] May demons be break broken off of the
[29:13] people, Father, and run and out of the
[29:15] house of God. And may the people be free
[29:17] this morning to praise and worship you,
[29:20] Lord. And may a great thing to take
[29:21] place today, Lord, of turn in our lives.
[29:24] Granted, almighty God, we commit this
[29:26] service into your hands. We commit this
[29:28] day into your hands for your glory in
[29:31] Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Why don't
[29:34] you give the Lord a shout of praise this
[29:36] morning? Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[29:39] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Father. You
[29:41] can take the key off. Amen. Praise God.
[29:44] Amen.

[48:08] I am one,
[48:16] through the storm,
[48:20] through the night.
[48:25] Lead me on
[48:29] through the life.
[48:33] Preious Lord,
[48:37] take my hand
[48:40] and lead
[48:42] me on.
[48:46] Do you believe it this morning? Oh, how
[48:49] many need him this morning? Oh preious
[48:54] Lord. One more time we're singing. Take
[48:57] my hand.
[49:01] Oh lead me Lord.
[49:05] I need you Jesus. Help me stand.
[49:11] I am tired.
[49:16] I am weak.
[49:19] I am one
[49:28] through the storm,
[49:33] through the night.
[49:36] Oh, lead me on
[49:41] to the light.
[49:45] Precious
[49:47] Lord,
[49:50] take my hand.
[49:57] Oh.
[50:04] Oh, you feel it this morning.
[50:07] I need thee. Oh,
[50:12] I need thee.
[50:18] Every
[50:20] hour
[50:22] I need thee.
[50:28] Oh, bless
[50:30] me now,
[50:33] my savior.
[50:39] Oh, I come
[50:44] to
[50:47] thee.
[50:49] Oh, one more time. Let's sing it all
[50:50] together. We take it up. Oh, I need
[50:55] thee. Oh,
[50:58] I need thee.
[51:02] Every hour,
[51:04] every
[51:07] hour.
[51:10] I need the
[51:12] Lord.
[51:14] Oh, bless
[51:17] me now.
[51:20] My savior.
[51:27] I come
[51:31] to
[51:34] I come to thee.
[51:38] Give the Lord a praise offering this
[51:40] morning.
[51:42] We need him every hour.
[51:44] We need him all the time.
[51:47] We need his presence to go with us to
[51:50] keep us in the shadow, in the tempest,
[51:53] and in the storm. He's the only anchor
[51:56] this world has this morning. I have no
[51:58] anchor on my own, but Jesus. I didn't
[52:01] make it on my own, but it was Jesus who
[52:04] was there when I needed him the most.
[52:06] when everything else fell apart. Feel so
[52:09] good this morning that there is a river
[52:14] flows from deep within. Thank you,
[52:17] Jesus. Do you feel that way this
[52:19] morning? Why don't you turn around and
[52:20] greet somebody just one more time? Just
[52:22] share a blessing with somebody.
[52:24] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Amen.
[52:27] Glory to God.
[52:31] You don't know what the Lord has done
[52:32] for me. Amen. Praise God. Let's sing
[52:34] that song. Hallelujah.
[52:39] You don't know what the Lord has done
[52:42] for me.
[52:44] Oh, you don't know what the Lord has
[52:49] done for me.
[52:52] You don't know you are there. You don't
[52:56] know when. And you don't know when. You
[52:59] don't know what the Lord has done for
[53:03] me. Let me pick it up.
[53:06] You don't know what the Lord done for
[53:10] me.
[53:11] Oh, you don't know what the Lord has
[53:16] done for me.
[53:19] You don't know. You won't. You don't
[53:23] know when. And you don't know when. Oh,
[53:26] you don't know what the Lord has done
[53:30] for me. Oh,
[53:33] you don't know what the Lord come for
[53:37] me.
[53:39] Oh, you don't know.
[53:43] Come for me.
[53:46] You don't know. You are there. You don't
[53:50] know when. And you don't know when.
[53:53] Well, you don't know what the Lord has
[53:56] done for me. Oh, you don't you don't
[54:00] know what the long Oh, it's done for me.
[54:05] Well, oh, you don't know.
[54:10] Oh, it's done for me.
[54:13] Oh, you don't know. You are there. You
[54:17] don't know where and you don't know
[54:20] where. So, you don't know what the Lord
[54:24] has done for me. Oh, well now he's done
[54:28] so much for me that I cannot tell it
[54:33] all. Oh, sing and I cannot tell it all.
[54:37] Oh, I cannot tell it all. Oh, he so much
[54:43] for me. I cannot tell it all. Oh, he has
[54:48] taken all
[54:53] take it off. Oh, he's done so much for
[54:56] me that I cannot tell. Oh, yes, I cannot
[55:03] tell it all. Oh, I cannot tell it all.
[55:08] Oh, he's done so much for me that I
[55:12] cannot tell it all. He has taken all my
[55:17] sins
[55:18] away. Oh, he's done so much. He's done
[55:22] so much for me that I cannot tell it
[55:27] all. Oh, I cannot tell it all. Oh, I
[55:32] cannot tell it all. Oh, he's done so
[55:36] much for me that I cannot tell it all.
[55:41] He has taken all my sins
[55:45] away. Oh, this morning. Tell me, where
[55:49] could I go? Oh, tell me where could I
[55:53] go? Well, when I was seeking a refugee
[55:58] for my soul.
[56:00] Oh, when I needed a friend
[56:05] to help me in the end. Oh, where could I
[56:10] go to the Lord? Where could I go? Oh,
[56:16] where could I go?
[56:19] Where I go home seeking
[56:25] all my
[56:28] when I need a friend
[56:32] to help me.
[56:35] Oh, where do I go? But you know I'm
[56:40] going to stay on my field. I'm going to
[56:43] stay on the battlefield.
[56:45] I want to stay on my feet. I'm going to
[56:50] stay on
[56:52] till he come.
[56:56] I'm going to stay on the battlefield.
[56:59] I'm going to stay on the battlefield.
[57:02] I'm going to stay on the battlefield
[57:06] till he come. One more time. I'm going
[57:08] to stay. I'm going to stay on field. I'm
[57:13] going to steal. I can feel I'm going to
[57:17] feel
[57:20] it.
[57:23] I'm going to
[57:26] stay.
[57:29] Hallelujah. I'm going to stay on the
[57:32] battlefield.
[57:34] One more time.
[57:37] I'm going to stay on the battlefield.
[57:40] I'm going to stay on the battlefield.
[57:44] I'm going to stay on the battlefield
[57:47] till he comes.
[57:51] I'm going to stay on the battlefield.
[57:54] Oh, I'm going to stay on the
[57:56] battlefield.
[57:58] I'm going to stay on the battlefield.
[58:05] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let's
[58:06] pray. Father, we thank you for your
[58:08] presence and we put it in our hearts to
[58:10] stay on the battlefield in this life's
[58:13] journey where it's battle every day. We
[58:16] fight to live. We fight to die. We fight
[58:19] to yield, surrender ourselves to you
[58:21] where we love you, Lord. You said your
[58:23] yoke is easy and your burden is light.
[58:26] We thank you for the burden of the word
[58:28] that you place upon us that we could
[58:30] surrender our lives to you. Father,
[58:31] speak to us. take me out of the way and
[58:33] may you be magnified and glorified in
[58:35] our midst in Jesus name I ask it. Amen.
[58:38] Amen. God bless you. Before I ever cease
[58:40] if you have your Bibles let's 2 Kings
[58:42] chapter 4 and Matthew chapter 14. Two
[58:44] portion of scriptures today. 2 Kings
[58:47] chapter 4
[58:50] reading from verse one of 2 Kings
[58:54] chapter 4.
[58:59] Now they cried a certain woman of the
[59:01] wives of the sons of the prophets unto
[59:03] Elisha, saying, Thy servant, my husband
[59:06] is dead, and thou knowest that thy
[59:09] servant did fear the Lord, and the
[59:11] creditor is come to take unto him my two
[59:14] sons to be bondsmen.
[59:18] And Elisha said unto her, "What shall I
[59:20] do for thee? Tell me, what has thou in
[59:23] thy house?" She said, "Thy handmade had
[59:26] not anything in the house, save a pot of
[59:29] oil."
[59:31] Then he said, "Go
[59:34] borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy
[59:38] neighbors, even empty vessels. Borrow
[59:42] not a few." And when thou had come in,
[59:46] thou shalt shut the door upon thee and
[59:49] upon thy sons, and thou shalt pour out
[59:52] into all those vessels, and thou shalt
[59:55] set aside that which is full.
[59:58] So she went from him, and shut the door
[1:00:01] upon her, and upon her sons, who brought
[1:00:04] the vessels to her, and she poured out.
[1:00:08] And it came to pass when the vessels
[1:00:10] were full that she said unto her, "Son,
[1:00:12] bring me yet a vessel." And he said unto
[1:00:15] her, "There is not a vessel more." And
[1:00:18] the oil stayed.
[1:00:20] Then she came and told the man of God,
[1:00:23] he said, "Go sell the oil and pay thy
[1:00:26] debt, and live thou and thy children of
[1:00:31] the rest."
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; I read from Matthew chapter 14.
[1:00:39] I want to read from verse 23
[1:00:46] speaking about Jesus. And when he had
[1:00:48] sent the multitudes away, this is
[1:00:51] Matthew 14:23,
[1:00:53] he went up into a mountain apart to
[1:00:56] pray.
[1:00:59] And when the evening was come, he was
[1:01:02] there alone. But the ship was now in the
[1:01:05] midst of the sea, tossed with waves, for
[1:01:07] the wind was contrary.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; And in the fourth watch of the night,
[1:01:12] Jesus went unto them walking on the sea.
[1:01:16] When the disciples saw him walking on
[1:01:18] the sea, they were troubled, saying, "It
[1:01:21] is a spirit." And they cried out for
[1:01:23] fear. But straightway Jesus spake unto
[1:01:26] them, saying, "Be of good cheer. It is
[1:01:28] I. Be not afraid." And Peter answered
[1:01:32] him and said, "Lord, if it be thou, bid
[1:01:36] me come unto thee on the water." And he
[1:01:39] said, "Come." And when Peter was come
[1:01:42] down out of the ship, he walked on the
[1:01:45] water to go to Jesus. But when he saw
[1:01:49] the wind boisterous, he was afraid. And
[1:01:52] beginning to sink, he cried, saying,
[1:01:54] "Lord, save me." And immediately Jesus
[1:01:58] stretched forth his hand and caught him
[1:02:00] and said unto him, "Oh thou of little
[1:02:03] faith, wherefore this thou doubt?" Let's
[1:02:05] pray. Father, we thank you for your word
[1:02:07] tonight. May this edify, strengthen, and
[1:02:08] bless and deliver and fill your people
[1:02:11] with your presence by your word. May I
[1:02:13] confirm your word tonight today with
[1:02:15] signs, wonders, and miracles. I ask in
[1:02:16] Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated.
[1:02:19] Praise God. Amen. Praise God. As you sit
[1:02:21] down, give God some praises.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, he is worthy.
[1:02:25] of all your praise.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise will make such a whole
[1:02:30] difference
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; in this hour. Praise God. I miss your
[1:02:32] trial. I praise him. I miss your
[1:02:34] testings. Praise him. I missed
[1:02:36] conditions. You praise him. There's no
[1:02:38] reason not to praise him. Confuse the
[1:02:40] devil by praising God. Praise God.
[1:02:43] Confuse the enemy by praising God. Devil
[1:02:45] want you to depress and dong out. But
[1:02:47] God want you lifted up. He said, "If I
[1:02:49] be lifted up from the earth, I'll draw
[1:02:51] all men unto me." He wants you to be
[1:02:53] full of praises. When the lamb took the
[1:02:55] book, there was not worthy. He said,
[1:02:56] "Worthy is the lamb that was slain to
[1:02:58] take the book and to loose the seven
[1:03:00] seas." God bless you. Welcome this
[1:03:02] morning. Welcome to the house of praise.
[1:03:04] The Bible said in the tabernacle of the
[1:03:06] righteous, they are rejoicing. Praise
[1:03:09] God. Where is God, there is noise.
[1:03:11] Wherever he's around you, you have to
[1:03:13] hear some kind of activity. We don't
[1:03:15] serve a dead God. We serve a living God.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; I have a title this morning. If you can
[1:03:20] only get started,
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; God will do the rest.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. If you could only get
[1:03:26] started,
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; God will do the rest.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; I have an inspiration. A supernatural
[1:03:30] intervention after getting into action.
[1:03:34] Oh, praise the name of the Lord. That's
[1:03:35] my type, my inspiration. A supernatural
[1:03:37] intervention after getting into action.
[1:03:40] All right, let's go. God always has a
[1:03:43] way.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; There's two ways. Our ways or his ways.
[1:03:48] God has a way for today and he's always
[1:03:52] made a way for everything. God at the
[1:03:55] beginning know the end and he laid out
[1:03:57] the scripture for each age.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; So praise God. So God has a way. Isn't
[1:04:00] that right?
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; And when God sends someone on the scene,
[1:04:03] a prophet, God never changes his system.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; He never changes his ways. He always
[1:04:09] does it the same way. He has to. He must
[1:04:13] do it. God interprets his own word. We
[1:04:17] don't have to interpret it. He interpret
[1:04:18] it by vindicating it or confirming it.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. So God has made a way
[1:04:23] for us.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; God loves his children.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; He loves his people.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; He wants to help them. He wants to help
[1:04:32] you more than you want help.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; If you can just get in that in your
[1:04:36] heart that God is more willing to help
[1:04:38] you than you are to help yourself. But
[1:04:41] he has a way.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. And
[1:04:45] that's the only way he will work is
[1:04:47] through his way.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; So even though he loves you, he want to
[1:04:51] help you. He can't help you outside the
[1:04:53] laws of his ways.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. He loves
[1:04:57] you. You believe that?
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Just like you love your children, God
[1:05:00] love you.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he have a way of doing
[1:05:04] things. He have a way of open up the
[1:05:06] windows of heaven. He have a way of
[1:05:08] releasing his blessings. He have a way
[1:05:10] of do making his deliverance. That is
[1:05:12] his way. And there's only two ways, our
[1:05:15] ways and his way. But he said, "My
[1:05:17] thoughts are not your thoughts. And my
[1:05:18] ways are not your ways. I as the heaven
[1:05:21] is above." Praise God. So are my ways
[1:05:23] above your ways. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:05:25] praises.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go. You must come to his
[1:05:32] terms,
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; not your terms,
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; his terms. You want it a certain way,
[1:05:38] but he gives it to you his way. like
[1:05:41] Neon dipping in the waters of Jordan. He
[1:05:43] said the waters up in the country was
[1:05:45] much cleaner and better. Neon had
[1:05:47] leprosy, private leprosy. Only the
[1:05:50] people around Neon know he have leprosy.
[1:05:52] He have his army clone around him. He's
[1:05:54] respected and respectable. But in the
[1:05:55] night time is a problem.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; When he take out his armor and he see
[1:05:59] all this leprosy condition upon him.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; His servant told him to send for that
[1:06:03] prophet. The prophet tell him go and dip
[1:06:05] seven times in the Jordan River. But
[1:06:08] that man want to pray dip in a swimming
[1:06:10] pool. He want to bathe in an island
[1:06:12] pool. He want to bathe by by clear
[1:06:14] waters. Hallelujah. Similar to begging.
[1:06:17] If the man say Jordan River is Jordan
[1:06:19] River. It might look dirty but it's
[1:06:21] Jordan River. That is God's provision.
[1:06:24] That is God's way. And when he dipped
[1:06:26] seven times, he was made whole. Do you
[1:06:28] want to be whole today? Oh, glory to
[1:06:31] God. You got to come God's way, not your
[1:06:34] way. You have to come by God thoughts,
[1:06:36] not your thoughts. Oh, give the Lord
[1:06:38] some praises.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; So when Neon obeyed God,
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; he was healed.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; His leprosy left.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; And if we obey God's provided way,
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; leprosy would leave.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Sickness will leave.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Everything will leave. But we have got
[1:06:55] to come his way for this day.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, we see that God doesn't
[1:07:02] change his systems of doing things. He
[1:07:04] always does it the same. We are
[1:07:07] constantly changing because we are
[1:07:09] finite.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; We make all kind of mistakes. We can
[1:07:12] improve and get better. But God is
[1:07:16] infinite. But God is infinite. His first
[1:07:20] at the time.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; God cannot get smarter.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; He's the source of all wisdom.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; He is all power. He is omnipotent,
[1:07:36] omniprescient, omniscient, and infinite.
[1:07:38] Therefore, when he says anything, you
[1:07:40] could hang your soul on it
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; because it is true.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:48] So, you are not to focus on yourself.
[1:07:51] Don't let the camera focus on you. You
[1:07:52] know, right now in the age of selfie,
[1:07:54] everybody clicking.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; We have too much of that.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; You're looking at you. You're looking at
[1:08:00] yourself. You're looking at your family.
[1:08:02] But we have to focus on Jesus Christ.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Because this gospel is not about it's
[1:08:07] about him.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; He is the team of this gospel. He's the
[1:08:11] team of the Bible. And that is what we
[1:08:13] must see because we are all at the same
[1:08:15] level. Born in sin, shaping inquity,
[1:08:18] coming in the world speaking lies. All
[1:08:19] of us need a redeemer, a savior, a
[1:08:21] deliverer, a healer, a baptizer. We all
[1:08:23] needy. But he stands as king of kings
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; and lord of lords today. Oh, praise the
[1:08:29] Lord. Hallelujah. So watch this. He
[1:08:32] said, "The works that I do shall do
[1:08:33] also." Then if you get your camera in
[1:08:35] focus to a place to where God can see
[1:08:38] you, where God can use you, you got to
[1:08:41] see that God knows that you are a
[1:08:44] sinner, that you have confessed your
[1:08:46] sins and God put your iniquity upon him
[1:08:48] and upon himself and become a man. He
[1:08:51] crossed his strain. He come down from
[1:08:52] being God to be a man that he might die
[1:08:54] in yourstead. Do you understand that?
[1:08:56] the cost of that
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; he left his glory take on a ro of flesh
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; to come to pay for a price that we had
[1:09:02] go was responsible for
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; and he couldn't die as a spirit he
[1:09:06] couldn't die as god he had to die as a
[1:09:08] man so he come to pay the price and say
[1:09:10] you you had to take your hands off now I
[1:09:12] died for them I paid for them they are
[1:09:15] going to be delivered they are going to
[1:09:17] be free they are mine you are purchased
[1:09:20] by the blood of Jesus not you're
[1:09:22] righteous you stop sminking you stop
[1:09:23] drinking stop smoking you are purchased
[1:09:26] by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; And the power of God is what made blood
[1:09:31] that he might take away your sinful
[1:09:33] blood by sexual desire and make you a
[1:09:36] free man and woman. There you are.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; So you have to focus away from yourself
[1:09:40] and focus on Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; And then you're going to hear all your
[1:09:44] sins are forgiven.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Like the woman caught in
[1:09:47] the act of adultery, she didn't ask for
[1:09:49] pardon. She didn't ask for forgiveness.
[1:09:51] But Jesus said, "Where are thine
[1:09:52] accusers?" Then he said, "Go and sin no
[1:09:55] more."
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Isn't that
[1:09:58] right?
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; I want to read a scripture from St. John
[1:10:00] chapter 5. I'll read it quickly from
[1:10:02] verse one. And after this, there was a
[1:10:04] feast of the Jews. Jesus went to
[1:10:05] Jerusalem. And there was a place in a
[1:10:07] market pool called Betiza. And in there
[1:10:11] lay great multitude of important folk,
[1:10:13] blind, hauled, withered, waiting for the
[1:10:15] movement of the water. For an angel went
[1:10:19] down at a certain season into the pool,
[1:10:22] and trouble the water.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Wasn't the water now and trouble the
[1:10:26] water,
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; wasn't?
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; So everybody knew at this season the
[1:10:32] angel will come and trouble the water.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; And whosoever first after troubling in
[1:10:37] the water stepped in was made whole.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Whatever disease they had and a certain
[1:10:42] man, I like that. I put no name on that
[1:10:44] man.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; That man could be you. That man could be
[1:10:46] me. But a certain man was there which
[1:10:49] had an infirmity 30 and 8 years and
[1:10:53] Jesus saw him lie and knew how long time
[1:10:57] in that case
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; the case that you have how long you in
[1:11:00] it.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; He said unto him thou be made whole?
[1:11:03] Question.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; The important man answered sir I have no
[1:11:07] man when the water is troubled to put me
[1:11:09] into the pool while I am coming another
[1:11:12] step down before me. And Jesus said unto
[1:11:14] him, "Rise,
[1:11:16] take up thy bed, and walk."
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; And immediately the man was made whole.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Now, before Jesus came on the scene,
[1:11:24] this supernatural occurrence in the pool
[1:11:28] by the angel stirring the water made a
[1:11:31] provision for healing for the people
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; until Jesus came.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; God always have a supernatural element
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; to make provisions for his people.
[1:11:41] healing,
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; restoration, forgiveness and
[1:11:44] deliverance.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; There is always the supernatural.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; And even at that time before Jesus spoke
[1:11:51] to that man, there was something
[1:11:52] supernatural happening.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; That man had persistence. That man had
[1:11:57] courage. That man come for 38 years. And
[1:12:00] every time he come, somebody coming in
[1:12:01] front of him.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Nobody helping him. He said, "I have no
[1:12:05] man coming because I know supernatural
[1:12:07] going to move
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; and I'm holding on for the supernatural.
[1:12:10] I am waiting for the supernatural
[1:12:12] because God is supernatural. God is not
[1:12:15] just talk. God is supernatural. He has
[1:12:18] work in a supernatural way. Oh, give the
[1:12:20] Lord some praises. Do you get what I'm
[1:12:22] saying now? God is supernatural. Oh,
[1:12:26] give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; When Jesus was walking underwater
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; and his disciples saw him and they got
[1:12:35] afraid and say the spirit,
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; he said fear not. Amen.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Be not afraid.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; So they accept that the master walking
[1:12:43] there. Peter went a little further. He
[1:12:45] throwing another gate. He said, "Lord,
[1:12:47] if that is you talking there, bid me to
[1:12:49] come. Let me walk too." A man who is a
[1:12:52] smoker, a drinker, or whatever it is, a
[1:12:54] man without the Holy Ghost. He said,
[1:12:56] "Bid me to come. If you speak me to
[1:12:58] come, I could walk just like you walk."
[1:13:01] Oh, give the Lord a shout. Do you have
[1:13:03] the courage this morning to believe you
[1:13:05] could walk just like he walked? And
[1:13:07] Jesus said, "Come." And you know what
[1:13:09] Peter did? He got into action. He
[1:13:12] stepped out the boat. That's the problem
[1:13:14] with a lot of us. We're not willing to
[1:13:16] step out the boat. We could talk about
[1:13:18] how Peter sink, but Peter step out the
[1:13:20] boat and he walked on the water just
[1:13:23] like Jesus did. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:13:26] praises. You could overcome just like
[1:13:28] Jesus did. You could get power just like
[1:13:31] Jesus did. You could get the victory
[1:13:33] just like Jesus did. You could walk like
[1:13:35] he walked. You could talk like he
[1:13:37] talked. Oh, glory to God. The same works
[1:13:40] I do shall you do also. That's what
[1:13:42] Jesus said.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Ordinary man,
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; normal man,
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; working man stepped out of the boat,
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; got into action and he walked on the
[1:13:58] water.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; That means we could break dimensions.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We could
[1:14:03] confence.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; How you explaining that? A man walking
[1:14:07] on the water. That is not deic. You
[1:14:10] know, he was literally walking on the
[1:14:12] water, you know, because we could
[1:14:13] conquer elements. Oh, glory to God.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; This man, this important man. Jesus
[1:14:20] said, "Rise up, take a bed and walk."
[1:14:22] And immediately man is made whole.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Took up his bed and walked.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; And the same day was the Sabbath.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Watch this. Watch how religious spirits
[1:14:34] behave and act. This man who was sick
[1:14:37] was healed completely.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; They know he come in there a long time.
[1:14:42] The man walking out with his bed. I like
[1:14:45] that. You know, pick up your bed. Don't
[1:14:47] leave your bed there and walk away and
[1:14:48] leave somebody else to pick it up for
[1:14:49] you. Pick up your bed and walk.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; The man pick up his bed, it was walking.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; The Jews therefore said unto him that
[1:14:58] was cured, it is the Sabbath day.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; It is not lawful for thee to carry thy
[1:15:04] bed.
[1:15:06] He answered and said unto them, he that
[1:15:10] made me whole.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; The same said unto me, take up thy bed
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; and walk.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; They asked him, "What man is that which
[1:15:21] said unto thee, take up thy bed and
[1:15:23] walk?" So they don't know who it is.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; They don't know when it happened.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And he that was healed
[1:15:31] was not who it was. He didn't know who
[1:15:32] it was. For Jesus had conveyed himself
[1:15:35] away a multitude been in that place.
[1:15:38] Afterwards
[1:15:40] Jesus findeth him in the temple
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; said unto him, "Behold,
[1:15:45] thou art made whole."
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Sin no more,
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; least a worse thing
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; come unto thee.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Maybe this morning somebody will be made
[1:15:57] whole.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. And the
[1:16:00] man departed told the Jews it was Jesus.
[1:16:03] So now he knew who it was.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; So he could identify who it was. He said
[1:16:07] it's Jesus which had made him whole.
[1:16:09] Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus
[1:16:11] and sought to slay him because he had
[1:16:13] done this on the Sabbath day. Imagine
[1:16:15] that. Then study the man the man
[1:16:16] delivered the man get a breakthrough.
[1:16:18] But because he didn't the Sabbath day
[1:16:20] they wanted to kill Jesus. And Jesus
[1:16:22] said my father worked his and I work.
[1:16:24] Therefore the Jews more sought the more
[1:16:26] to kill him because he not only had
[1:16:28] broken the Sabbath he also said that God
[1:16:30] was his father making them equal with
[1:16:32] God. So once you say God is your father
[1:16:34] that's a problem because that's mean you
[1:16:36] are son and a father and a son reflects
[1:16:39] the father.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God is a dangerous thing to
[1:16:42] claim that God is your father because
[1:16:44] when you claim God is your father you
[1:16:46] are claiming to be a son of God. Oh give
[1:16:49] the Lord a shout. And a son of God walks
[1:16:52] like God, talks like God, lives like
[1:16:55] God, acts like God, do what God does
[1:16:59] because you are son of the father. Oh,
[1:17:01] give the Lord a shout. This is
[1:17:03] completely different from a church
[1:17:04] member. A church member goes to church
[1:17:06] and go back home. Oh, glory to God. A
[1:17:08] church member just have church in mind,
[1:17:10] but a son of God, which you are, a
[1:17:12] daughter of God, which you are. Oh, you
[1:17:14] are offspring of the almighty. Oh, glory
[1:17:18] to God. You are benefited from his
[1:17:20] loins. Oh give the Lord a shout in the
[1:17:23] house. Hallelujah.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; And then Jesus said unto him, verily I
[1:17:32] say unto you, the son can do nothing
[1:17:34] himself, but what he see the father do,
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; so do for the things whatsoever he doeth
[1:17:39] there he the son does likewise. For here
[1:17:41] he is, for the father loveth the son and
[1:17:44] showeth him all things that himself do
[1:17:46] it and he will show him greater works
[1:17:48] than these that he may marvel.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; So therefore there was always looking to
[1:17:56] see this supernatural moving of the
[1:17:58] waters and when they saw listen and
[1:18:01] there had to be something supernatural
[1:18:03] happening and as soon as the
[1:18:05] supernatural happened they made a rush
[1:18:06] for it.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Look at the church today. Here we go.
[1:18:10] Are you ready?
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; God wants us to watch for the
[1:18:14] supernatural.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; When his word is made manifest and
[1:18:19] vindicated,
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; God want us to what? Watch for the
[1:18:23] supernatural.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; When his word is manifested and
[1:18:26] vindicated, now we run away from it
[1:18:28] because it's not connected with
[1:18:30] organization.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; And that's what people say is it's not
[1:18:33] God. So something God do something in
[1:18:35] this church and nobody here want to
[1:18:36] identify with it because it's not in
[1:18:37] their church. You think God have time
[1:18:39] with church? God not in time, you know.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; God not in space time, you know. God
[1:18:43] outside of that, you know. God does what
[1:18:45] he want to do. You know, when God came
[1:18:47] out on the pillar of fire on the
[1:18:49] mountain and tell Moses, I have come
[1:18:50] down to deliver my people and you are
[1:18:52] going. And Moses had all the excuses.
[1:18:54] He's still going.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; 40 years relaxing. You're still going. I
[1:18:59] come down to set my people free. And I
[1:19:01] call you to do the job. And I believe
[1:19:03] there are people here called for a job.
[1:19:05] And you're not going to escape. Oh,
[1:19:08] glory to God. He will come down to
[1:19:09] deliver you, to get the job done. You
[1:19:11] have a job to do. God raised you up to
[1:19:14] do it. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:19:16] Hallelujah. But the thing about it, you
[1:19:18] got to get started. Something got to
[1:19:20] start this thing rolling. Something got
[1:19:23] to started this moving. Oh, glory. Are
[1:19:25] you going to get started this morning?
[1:19:27] God want you to get started. And if you
[1:19:29] only get started, God will do the rest.
[1:19:31] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:19:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. All of Israel know God is
[1:19:43] able. All of Israel know God have power.
[1:19:46] But but Goliath challenging Israel for
[1:19:48] 40 days and 40 nights and not a man
[1:19:51] move.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Polishing sword and polishing boots,
[1:19:54] polishing metal and polishing ranks.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; But nobody here facing Golth. Here come
[1:20:00] a little fell named David. Oh, glory to
[1:20:02] God. Who conquered a bear and lion. Here
[1:20:04] come a fell not qualified to be in the
[1:20:06] army. Here come a different kind of a
[1:20:08] man. Praise God. And if he can only get
[1:20:10] started, God will do the rest. And D and
[1:20:13] when Goliath saw David, Goliath
[1:20:15] prophesied, I will feed him to the
[1:20:17] birds. And David prophesied, I'll cut
[1:20:19] your head off. Prophecy versus prophecy.
[1:20:21] Oh, we coming along the line now. Give
[1:20:24] the Lord a shout. There's a prophecy of
[1:20:26] a bride revival. There's a prophecy of a
[1:20:28] super church. There's a prophecy of a
[1:20:29] super race. Which devil will stop that?
[1:20:32] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:20:34] The Bible said David ran to meet
[1:20:36] Goliath. Oh, come on now, Gideon. That's
[1:20:40] when a man not afraid. That's when a man
[1:20:42] anointed. That's when a man of
[1:20:44] commission. That's when a man getting
[1:20:46] started. And David took his sling and
[1:20:47] begin to swing. Oh, glory to God. He was
[1:20:50] swinging. He was getting started. And
[1:20:53] God directed the stone. And once you
[1:20:56] prepare to get start, get started.
[1:20:59] Something supernatural is on its way.
[1:21:02] Oh, praise the Lord for some praise this
[1:21:03] morning. Hallelujah.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Today, the Holy Spirit, the supernatural
[1:21:18] power of God is on the earth and in
[1:21:21] people run from it.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Instead of getting into it, the word
[1:21:24] made flesh, vindicated and everything
[1:21:26] else. And he did and promised if it
[1:21:28] isn't connected with our groups we have
[1:21:30] nothing to do with it.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; My this man wasn't able to walk this man
[1:21:35] wasn't able to run but God came and
[1:21:37] healed this man this man.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; All right. Now here this part I want to
[1:21:40] get to now watch now how that God All
[1:21:44] right. The priest had got to a place and
[1:21:47] got away from the supernatural part of
[1:21:49] God and have been teaching the doctrine
[1:21:52] of their own theories
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; of what they taught.
[1:21:56] So the priests or the ministers or the
[1:21:58] pastors of that day got away from the
[1:22:00] supernatural part.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; But God has always had a witness here on
[1:22:05] the earth.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; And brother Abraham said they said my
[1:22:07] calling is to get a gift that came from
[1:22:11] God for an inspiration for the people.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; I am just a little bitty part of it. It
[1:22:19] was given to me in order that it be
[1:22:22] demonstrated before the church that
[1:22:25] everybody
[1:22:27] might catch the vision of the
[1:22:30] supernatural part that God lives and
[1:22:33] reigns in his church today.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; So the gift given to him was to
[1:22:39] demonstrate the supernatural part to
[1:22:42] inspire everybody that God is not dead.
[1:22:45] He's alive. He could discern you. He
[1:22:47] could discern your thoughts. He could
[1:22:49] discern desires in your heart. He could
[1:22:51] tell you what you tell anybody. Oh, give
[1:22:53] the Lord a shout. He could declare
[1:22:55] himself to you and you will know our
[1:22:57] truth is that had to be God.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; He said he's a little bitty part of it.
[1:23:05] Amen.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; So the church ministers, he said,
[1:23:08] instead of the has preaching the
[1:23:10] doctrine of men instead of the doctrine
[1:23:12] of God and have left out the
[1:23:16] supernatural part of God's word and
[1:23:18] explain it away that the days of miracle
[1:23:21] is passed and has gotten down to a place
[1:23:23] where there's a very little small
[1:23:24] remnant left that believe in God.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That believe in God.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; The supernatural. That woman, she was in
[1:23:35] debt. Her husband died and she wanted a
[1:23:37] breakthrough. She wanted a financial
[1:23:38] breakthrough. And he said, "Young man of
[1:23:40] God, I need help. My creditors on me on
[1:23:44] on on the trail." And he said, "Listen,
[1:23:46] go and borrow vessels. Get empty
[1:23:49] vessels. Get them. Get them. Get them.
[1:23:50] Don't borrow a few, you know, borrow as
[1:23:52] much as you could borrow." But you know
[1:23:54] what he asked her? What do you have in
[1:23:55] your house? Oh, glory to God. What do
[1:23:57] you have in your hand? Remember when the
[1:23:59] multitude was there to be fed and she
[1:24:01] said, "What do you have?" I have to have
[1:24:03] something to work with. I want to have
[1:24:05] something to work with. You can't give
[1:24:07] me nothing. You have to put something to
[1:24:08] work with. We say we have a little boy
[1:24:10] with five loaves and two fishes. That's
[1:24:12] good enough. Bring it to me. In that boy
[1:24:15] hands is five loaves and two fishes. In
[1:24:17] Jesus hand, it feeding 5,000 and have
[1:24:20] baskets to remain. Oh, give the Lord
[1:24:22] some praises. Oh, glory to God. If we
[1:24:24] could only get started. If you could
[1:24:26] only get our hands on this thing. If you
[1:24:28] could only get this wheel turning. If
[1:24:30] you're going to get a revival going or
[1:24:32] give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:24:37] Hallelujah.
[1:24:39] Hallelujah.
[1:24:41] Note when Jesus asked, "What do you
[1:24:44] have?" And they said, "Oh, a boy here
[1:24:46] with five loaves and two fishes."
[1:24:48] Somebody said, "What are these among so
[1:24:50] many?" You see that mouth champion?
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; You hear that, Trinidadian? What are
[1:24:54] these among so many? You hear that? You
[1:24:56] hear that testimony? What are these
[1:24:58] among so many? Jesus said, "Bring it to
[1:25:00] me."
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; And he blessed it. Oh, give the Lord
[1:25:02] some praise. Don't get me get me excited
[1:25:04] now. He blessed it. Yes. Oh, God. Why
[1:25:06] didn't bring a bakery? Why didn't bring
[1:25:08] a sack of flour? Why didn't bring all
[1:25:09] the bakers in the country to feed all
[1:25:11] these people? He didn't talk that talk.
[1:25:13] He took the five loaves. He took the two
[1:25:14] fleshes. He blessed them.
[1:25:17] He said, "Break it
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; and share it."
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. The brothers in front
[1:25:24] felt privileged. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:25:29] They're in the VIP section.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; They're in front.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; They say, "Oh, God." He usher in the
[1:25:36] right place, you know.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Man, get the first. You can imagine how
[1:25:39] good that brother felt.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; The the first brother felt fish and
[1:25:44] bread and looking back at you. You sure
[1:25:46] could multip if anybody's getting you
[1:25:48] know as far as he concerned. He eat.
[1:25:50] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Eye
[1:25:52] closed. He look everybody got everything
[1:25:53] left and he breaking and sharing.
[1:25:54] Breaking. Listen, the people didn't even
[1:25:56] recognize it was a miracle. It was
[1:25:58] breaking, sharing, breaking, sharing,
[1:26:00] breaking, sharing, breaking, sharing,
[1:26:02] breaking, sharing. More you break, the
[1:26:03] more you share. More you share, your
[1:26:05] more you break. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:26:06] shout in the house.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; What do you have in your hand? What do
[1:26:16] you have in your house?
[1:26:21] When everything finished, 10 people
[1:26:24] scratch it. Wait a minute.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; How this match adding up?
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; This match not matching.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Five loaves, two fishes, 5,000 people
[1:26:32] fed.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; And look how much baskets remain.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Something This had to be a miracle.
[1:26:37] That's what we're talking about. We
[1:26:39] getting started this morning. I want to
[1:26:42] get you started this morning. Then
[1:26:44] something supernatural going to break in
[1:26:46] your life, break in your home, break in
[1:26:48] your marriage, break in your Oh, glory
[1:26:50] to God. Give the Lord some praises.
[1:26:54] Even your finances.
[1:26:56] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:26:59] That woman did not know the full
[1:27:02] revelation of what Elisha told her to
[1:27:04] do.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; He said, "Woman, go and borrow vessels
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; because he hear she have a a little bit
[1:27:10] of oil." He said, "Borrow, borrow,
[1:27:12] borrow, borrow and close the door."
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Now, people like to mind your business.
[1:27:16] What are you doing there?
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Mind your oy. Mind your own business.
[1:27:20] Close the door.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Get your sons to bring them bottles and
[1:27:23] start to fill it.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; She full one and she keep from that one
[1:27:27] bottle she had. She full this, but she
[1:27:30] full.
[1:27:31] I like to ask me neighbor
[1:27:34] I
[1:27:36] see kind of foolishness. You and your
[1:27:37] stinking rotten flesh. The prophet said
[1:27:40] go and borrow
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; not a few.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Go from the first house, second house,
[1:27:44] last house, your bottle and listen.
[1:27:45] Stack it high.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; And one by one tell the son said there
[1:27:51] is no more.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Then Elijah said go and sell that.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Pay your debts
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; and the rest you live off of that. God
[1:27:58] concerned about your finances too. I
[1:28:01] hear you. I hear you. Give me a shout on
[1:28:05] that. God concern about your bills, your
[1:28:08] debts, your creditors, your payments. Or
[1:28:11] give the Lord a shout. He carth for you
[1:28:14] through sunshine and shadows.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:28:30] Hallelujah.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; That started
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; when God want to get started. He find a
[1:28:37] man name Abraham
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; and Abraham the Bible believe God
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; a old man. God said I bless you and
[1:28:43] bless you and God talk so much a
[1:28:45] blessing. Talk to Abraham get a little
[1:28:46] irritated
[1:28:49] cuz he old. Say old have no children.
[1:28:52] Say he said give God back check. Oh you
[1:28:55] say blessing me and this and that and I
[1:28:57] go childless.
[1:28:59] say you're playing rude. Come on, let me
[1:29:01] talk to you.
[1:29:02] When your mouth loud like that and
[1:29:04] you're talking like that, I will I will
[1:29:05] tell you like it is. He said, "Come the
[1:29:07] stars."
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; When he runs on numbers, he say God
[1:29:11] says, "So shall I see it be
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; you have a son."
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; True Sarah. So don't even think about
[1:29:18] divorcing Sarah
[1:29:20] cuz through Sarah, you have that son.
[1:29:21] You had to treat her right. Treat her
[1:29:23] nice like she could stay.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; She went run away. And Abraham, the
[1:29:28] Bible said, believe God.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; And God count his revelation, his faith
[1:29:34] as righteousness.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; And Isaac was natural seed. But the
[1:29:41] faith of Abraham, this is so fresh, was
[1:29:43] a supernatural faith that brought a
[1:29:45] supernatural seed. Isaac was natural
[1:29:48] seed. Isaac died. All them died. But
[1:29:50] Jesus Christ, Abraham's seed,
[1:29:53] supernatural faith produced a
[1:29:55] supernatural seed. a supernatural son
[1:29:58] that not only died but he rose from the
[1:30:00] dead and is alive this morning to
[1:30:02] confirm his word this morning with signs
[1:30:05] and wonders and miracles. Do I hear a
[1:30:07] shout in the house this morning?
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; So Abraham, it wasn't just faith for a
[1:30:17] natural son.
[1:30:20] He said it was a supernatural fate that
[1:30:22] had a supernatural seed that produced a
[1:30:25] supernatural resurrection.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Okay, we're going good. Our 15 pages is
[1:30:30] now on page six. So, we're going really
[1:30:32] good.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Now, when they had to apply the blood
[1:30:39] under the judgment of death in Egypt,
[1:30:43] they use a weed called hup, which was a
[1:30:46] common weed. The prophet said the hissup
[1:30:49] speaks that of common weeds that you
[1:30:50] could get it anywhere. You pick it up,
[1:30:53] dip it in the blood and apply the blood
[1:30:55] because God said when I see the blood,
[1:30:57] I'll pass over you.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; What do I say? When I see a fancy car in
[1:31:00] front of your house, I'll pass over you.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Or when I see a window painting white,
[1:31:04] he want to see blood.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; God have a way and we have our way.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; And God's way was I must see the blood.
[1:31:12] People passing about, oh God, look at
[1:31:14] the blood and look at the color of all
[1:31:17] you get free paint. You have free red.
[1:31:20] Without the blood, you died.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; So you have to follow through with what
[1:31:24] is instructed to you
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; because God is outside of this
[1:31:28] dimension.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; And he honors his word.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; So when God said, "When I see the blood,
[1:31:34] I'm going to pass over you." You can't
[1:31:35] say, "Well, I put molasses. I'm going to
[1:31:37] put some kind of thing. I go put coke. I
[1:31:39] go put red solo." No. When I see the
[1:31:42] blood, I'm going to pass over you. That
[1:31:43] blood must come from a lamb that was
[1:31:45] slain. Oh, give the Lord a shout. In
[1:31:47] other words, you have to come into
[1:31:48] obedience to what God have said. Oh,
[1:31:51] give the Lord a praise. It's not just
[1:31:53] coming to church and saying amen,
[1:31:54] hallelujah, and shouting and jumping.
[1:31:56] It's whether or not you're coming into
[1:31:57] obedience to what God have said.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; But the part I want to get here is that
[1:32:02] the hissup was common weeds. Hup means
[1:32:05] your fate. Somebody tries to have
[1:32:07] supernatural faith, that's the reason
[1:32:08] you miss your healing. Faith is a common
[1:32:10] thing. You have faith to come to church.
[1:32:12] You got faith to walk out of here. You
[1:32:14] have faith to start your car. You got
[1:32:16] faith to eat your dinner. That's the way
[1:32:18] it is. Common faith. And to apply the
[1:32:21] blood was was was that was going
[1:32:24] anywhere in Egypt. Amen.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. So this
[1:32:30] book of redemption talking about root
[1:32:33] have four stations, four junctions in
[1:32:34] Ruth and Boaz. And we know root deciding
[1:32:38] where you go I'll go where die I die and
[1:32:40] so on like that. And then but here what
[1:32:41] I want to get to and root now was
[1:32:44] deciding perfectly that justification
[1:32:46] and whatn not. Now notice root deciding
[1:32:48] she had to make a decision whether she
[1:32:49] was going to decide to go over there or
[1:32:51] not. She had to make a decision and
[1:32:53] that's the way every believer has to do.
[1:32:55] You've got to leave your own haunts.
[1:32:56] You've got to leave your old life.
[1:32:58] You've got to leave the old things of
[1:32:59] the world. That to leave the old haunts
[1:33:01] of life. It's what you have done. You
[1:33:04] become a Christian. You left the pool
[1:33:06] room. You left the nightclubs. You had
[1:33:08] to come over into a bunch of people that
[1:33:10] look like they have spasms. They
[1:33:11] quivered and shook and cried and shook
[1:33:13] the head and jump up and down. It was
[1:33:15] like a crazy bunch to you. But you know,
[1:33:18] you had to make a decision whether you
[1:33:19] would go or not. And you know that when
[1:33:21] you did, your own people was going to
[1:33:23] make fun of you, the ones you left
[1:33:25] behind. Isn't that right? Now, Ruth had
[1:33:27] the same thing. That would be the
[1:33:28] Moabites would say to her, she cross
[1:33:30] over into the Israel to a bunch of
[1:33:32] fanatics. She had to make a decision.
[1:33:34] She had to decide and finally she made a
[1:33:36] decision. She come across to the new
[1:33:38] land. That is justification. Decision.
[1:33:40] Justification. Now watch. Now watch. Now
[1:33:43] what? Ruth making a decision on type of
[1:33:45] the gentile church. She cross over. The
[1:33:47] next thing she had to do. She had to
[1:33:50] work.
[1:33:52] She become a legalist. She had to work
[1:33:55] out her own salvation with fear and
[1:33:56] trembling. She went out into the field
[1:33:59] and put her clothes upon her and went
[1:34:01] out into the field and gleaned behind
[1:34:04] the maidens in order to get sustaining
[1:34:06] food for the day.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So she worked her way
[1:34:10] through the stage of legalism. And that
[1:34:13] stage of legalism is sanctification.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; I find the church um how you say it um
[1:34:19] young people say right you're biting
[1:34:20] teeth. I forget what they call it.
[1:34:22] You're pulling teeth that when you give
[1:34:24] them instruction what like you're
[1:34:25] pulling teeth. you give me pain. In
[1:34:27] other words, you want to do your own
[1:34:29] thing. You don't want to get this part
[1:34:31] here, this part of sanctification. You
[1:34:33] don't want to let your hair grow and
[1:34:35] cover your knees and and and take all
[1:34:37] the makeup off and whatever. You don't
[1:34:39] want to do that. But this is part of it.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; This is part of it. You coming in order
[1:34:45] and you'll get it just now. You have to
[1:34:47] do something to honor God. Amen.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; You can't be when you you want to smoke,
[1:34:52] you smoke or want to drink, you drink,
[1:34:54] you want to party, your party and
[1:34:55] whatnot, and then you want you want God
[1:34:56] to bless you. Hallelujah.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; It can't work that way.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what the church did.
[1:35:04] Luther did by faith. Watch. And what?
[1:35:07] I've got to quit. You've got something
[1:35:08] to do.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; That's what I get into now. I've got to
[1:35:11] quit. I've got to let my hair grow out,
[1:35:13] said the woman. Watch. They had to quit
[1:35:15] wearing the paints on their faces. They
[1:35:17] had to wear the skirts and so on like
[1:35:19] that. They had to do something. That's
[1:35:21] what she did. The state of
[1:35:24] justification,
[1:35:25] the state of sanctification. And
[1:35:28] afterwards,
[1:35:31] after what she rested.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; And afterward she rested. Is that right?
[1:35:39] And now here is the rest is the Holy
[1:35:41] Spirit the Sabbath day. Amen. So when
[1:35:44] root was resting it was a type of the
[1:35:46] church resting in the promises and then
[1:35:49] afterwards root was rewarded and that's
[1:35:51] what the church did. It entered into
[1:35:52] justification under Luther. It went in
[1:35:55] sanification under Wesley. So listen in
[1:35:57] this message it cannot be we in the
[1:36:00] message. No the message consists of
[1:36:03] justification sanification bapt Holy
[1:36:06] Ghost and the token
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; or the Holy Ghost itself the person.
[1:36:10] That is what this message is all about.
[1:36:12] Because when God restoring, God restored
[1:36:14] the whole thing.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; I'll restore what the canker worm,
[1:36:17] caterpillar, palm, and locust. Four
[1:36:19] stages. It took God to restore to bring
[1:36:22] back the church in position.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; So you cannot leave out any.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Now they want to leave out the battle
[1:36:27] holy ghost, but they can't leave out the
[1:36:28] battle holy ghost. And you can't leave
[1:36:30] out sanification.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Sanvic when you get
[1:36:33] busted, when you get rebuked, when you
[1:36:35] get corrected, when you get instructed,
[1:36:36] when you get praise God, the word come
[1:36:38] to advise you as to how to behave
[1:36:41] because the mysteries come to reveal how
[1:36:43] to behave yourself.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Not how to
[1:36:47] join church. Everybody joining church,
[1:36:49] we not talking about that.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; What the Bible said, he came unto his
[1:36:55] own, his own receive him not, but as
[1:36:57] many as receive him, to them give power
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; to become. In other words, to be
[1:37:02] transformed into
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; to become the sons of God.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God saw Adam placed
[1:37:07] positionally in the garden of Eden. And
[1:37:09] that man fell
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; with no rum, wine, women or whiskey.
[1:37:14] No booze, no ganja.
[1:37:16] And that man that God placed in the
[1:37:17] garden of Eden fell. God said, "I'm not
[1:37:19] going to have that no more."
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; That was a man perfect man standing
[1:37:22] there and he fell. God said, "I'm going
[1:37:24] to let him go through the process." And
[1:37:25] that process is where you get
[1:37:27] transformed
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; by the trial of your faith. So we can't
[1:37:30] back down now and say too hot. No, we
[1:37:33] are prepared for it. God made us ready
[1:37:36] for it. God called some special forces
[1:37:38] to be in this last day. God could have
[1:37:40] put you in lutter day and Wesley and all
[1:37:42] them day with the big bonnet and
[1:37:44] everything else and horse and buggy and
[1:37:45] you taking four hours to get to service.
[1:37:47] God could have put you back inside of
[1:37:48] there. But God put you here because you
[1:37:50] belong to God's special forces in the
[1:37:52] last days that could deal with that
[1:37:54] devil anywhere, anytime, any place,
[1:37:57] under any condition. We were raised up
[1:37:59] for that purpose. Do you are you with
[1:38:00] me?
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; All right. Scripture Ecclesiastes 11:4.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; He that observeth the wind shall not
[1:38:10] sow,
[1:38:12] and he that regardeth the clouds shall
[1:38:15] not reap. Let me read it again.
[1:38:18] Ecclesiastes 11:4. He that observeth the
[1:38:21] wind shall not sow. He that regarded the
[1:38:25] clouds shall not reap. It means that you
[1:38:28] don't have to wait for optimal
[1:38:30] conditions to act.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; The pathway to hell is paved with good
[1:38:38] intentions.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; I intend to be saved. I intend to serve
[1:38:43] God.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; I intend to press. I intend. Intend.
[1:38:46] Intent. That's only intention.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; But you have to act.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; The action is what made the difference.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, not the intention. intention in your
[1:38:56] head, in your mind, but you have to act.
[1:38:58] And a lot of people, they are unwilling
[1:39:00] to act. And we get on to them lepers who
[1:39:03] say, "If we stay here, we will die. If
[1:39:05] we go out to the enemy, we will die."
[1:39:07] Basically, go out. Yes, we are staying
[1:39:09] here and die. We know here already. We
[1:39:11] know this is death already. Everybody
[1:39:12] starving in the in in in the village
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; in the city.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Why stay here and die?
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; You got to do something. I ain't going
[1:39:21] to let no pastor man kill me. I ain't
[1:39:22] going to let no elder man kill me. No
[1:39:24] deacon man kill more. No church kill me.
[1:39:26] Hallelujah. I'm going to live. Jesus
[1:39:29] said, "I come that you might have life
[1:39:31] and have it more abundantly. Therefore,
[1:39:33] I'm going to press. I'm going to stay on
[1:39:34] the battlefield. I'm going to fight the
[1:39:37] fight of faith." Oh, give the Lord some
[1:39:38] praises. Glory to God. Hallelujah. I'm
[1:39:42] not going to accept my sickness. I'm
[1:39:43] going to claim my healing. I'm not going
[1:39:45] to accept depression, accept
[1:39:46] frustration, accept no joy. I'm going to
[1:39:49] claim all what God promised, all what
[1:39:52] Jesus died for. Hallelujah. Do you
[1:39:54] believe that?
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; So this scripture, he that observe the
[1:39:57] wind shall not sow is that you're not
[1:40:00] using your eyes. You're not trying to go
[1:40:01] by optimum condition to do anything.
[1:40:04] You're doing it because you need to be
[1:40:06] done. You're doing it because you need
[1:40:07] to get started. You're doing it because
[1:40:09] you need to do something different
[1:40:10] because what you have been doing, you
[1:40:12] have seen the results. Have you
[1:40:13] considered your results over the years
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; and you're still continuing the same
[1:40:18] mindset?
[1:40:21] You're not even seeking advice or
[1:40:23] counsel.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; You're just going doing your own thing.
[1:40:25] Just whatever you feel to do and you're
[1:40:26] doing and you're doing and you're not
[1:40:29] weighing out. That's why you have to
[1:40:33] say it take introspection
[1:40:35] look into you
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; it easy outside outside busy busy busy
[1:40:39] busy busy stop pause silah meditate
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; sila is to take a pause
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; think on these things try to get the
[1:40:48] mirror that's why this social media and
[1:40:50] all these phone and everything that
[1:40:51] people are so busy and caught up and
[1:40:53] caught up they have no time to get even
[1:40:55] get conviction
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; because they're so busy that they got
[1:41:00] allowing the spirit to bring them a
[1:41:01] conviction. I bring a guidance, a
[1:41:02] leading. Not so. Don't go that way.
[1:41:06] Don't say that. Watch your tongue. Watch
[1:41:08] your mouth.
[1:41:11] Listen to this now.
[1:41:14] But I'm speaking about is the crowds get
[1:41:16] tremendous. We can we can't put them in
[1:41:17] buildings. He say sometimes as much as
[1:41:20] 500,000. That's half a million people in
[1:41:22] one single gathering. He said, "You have
[1:41:25] got the seasons where is where is not
[1:41:27] not raining and pouring down rain and
[1:41:29] those poor people. I've seen women sit
[1:41:31] out here with their hair just stringing
[1:41:32] down fine dress people and sat in that
[1:41:35] rain all day long. Just sat there and it
[1:41:38] just pouring and thundering and lighting
[1:41:40] and storms blow and them weaving back
[1:41:42] and forth against one another and
[1:41:44] waiting to come to be prayed for." Get
[1:41:47] it? Get it back. Now you know God honors
[1:41:50] faith like that.
[1:41:53] So what we end up now is a bunch of
[1:41:56] people that are entitled. They feel it
[1:41:58] is a right.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; You know long time they didn't have cell
[1:42:01] phone they had what they call pages.
[1:42:03] Think about P now that looks so cuckoo
[1:42:05] and and so far long time when you see
[1:42:08] somebody on cell phone is a big long
[1:42:09] thing you know like antenna you know a
[1:42:12] big clumsy looking thing. When you see
[1:42:15] somebody with a cell phone or whatever
[1:42:17] that was in the ears because young
[1:42:19] people now know what we talking about.
[1:42:20] You need to go to pay uh phone boot
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; and put a coin
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; that you swing in your hand.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; They don't know that no old phone boot
[1:42:31] gone.
[1:42:37] You see what I'm talking about now? So
[1:42:38] when somebody have a cell phone time
[1:42:40] that person have money now even a dog
[1:42:43] have a cell phone every everybody have
[1:42:45] cell phone.
[1:42:48] You get what I'm saying now?
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; You have Bible on cell phone, camera on
[1:42:53] cell phone, news on cell phone, TV on
[1:42:56] cell phone, everything on cell phone.
[1:42:58] Devil making sure people occupying busy
[1:43:01] busy busy
[1:43:04] talking to wife and what kind of talk is
[1:43:06] there?
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Half talk have your eyes down cell
[1:43:11] phone.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; So if you don't make time for God, it
[1:43:14] ain't coming.
[1:43:17] If you don't spell it out, pen it out.
[1:43:20] Say, you know what? This is my allotted
[1:43:22] time to do this. I'm going to take off
[1:43:24] my phone. I'm going to take off my
[1:43:25] tablet. I'm going to do this. If you
[1:43:26] don't do that, it not coming. You know,
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; one thing, Satan is a interesting
[1:43:32] character. You know, you always give
[1:43:33] people options. You know,
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; yeah. What? Football, take cricket,
[1:43:35] cricket, basketball, basketball, ski,
[1:43:38] ski, tennis. Yeah. Tennis,
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; swimming. If you have things swimming,
[1:43:43] the back wrestling, running.
[1:43:47] So, sports, sports,
[1:43:51] and on top of that, they bring the joke
[1:43:52] cuz the comedians, this comedian, that
[1:43:54] comedian, just laughing, holy, holy,
[1:43:56] holy, holy.
[1:43:57] You're laughing like drugs, you know.
[1:43:59] You're laughing your sorrows away.
[1:44:00] You're laughing your money problem away.
[1:44:02] Just laughing like life is a joke until
[1:44:05] you wake up, get wake up, call. It's not
[1:44:07] a joke. It is dead serious. The devil
[1:44:09] after your soul.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; It's not a joke. He's after your soul.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Not after money. Your soul.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; You know, God honors faith like that.
[1:44:21] And this is the part I want to get to.
[1:44:23] You have got to do something to for God
[1:44:25] to honor.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; You show him. The people that's got
[1:44:29] everything handed to them easy. They
[1:44:31] don't usually they don't do nothing for
[1:44:33] it. The gift is free. But it seems that
[1:44:35] if you are born with a silver spoon, you
[1:44:37] ever heard that? They don't appreciate
[1:44:39] it. But you got to do something.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "There's probably many a man
[1:44:48] sitting here tonight. If he's done
[1:44:49] something that God told him to do long
[1:44:51] time ago, he'll be preaching the gospel
[1:44:52] somewhere." Do something.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Don't just stand still. If you're not a
[1:44:56] preacher, testify. Do something
[1:44:59] somewhere. Don't stand still. If you're
[1:45:02] washing the dishes, why testify to the
[1:45:04] neighbor? Get out and pass tracks. Do
[1:45:06] something. Don't stand still. what is in
[1:45:09] your hand.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Get doing something. Oh, praise the name
[1:45:13] of the Lord. Hallelujah. Paul said, I
[1:45:16] know I could preach the gospel. That's
[1:45:17] my duty. I'm a preacher. He's a
[1:45:19] preacher, but the devil is a preacher.
[1:45:20] That's our duty to be preachers. Well,
[1:45:22] that's just what we supposed to do. But
[1:45:24] let me do something beyond that.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; I've got a right to take up money, but
[1:45:28] I'm going to make tents just to show I
[1:45:31] can sacrifice. You talk about Paul
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; and he said it's an honorable marriage
[1:45:36] is honorable among all. The ben is
[1:45:38] undefiled. It's good for man to be
[1:45:39] married. I've got a right to be married.
[1:45:41] How? Now I could be married. I've got a
[1:45:43] legal right to be married, but I just
[1:45:45] won't get married. Paul, I want to do
[1:45:49] another sacrifice to the Lord.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every man has to know his
[1:45:54] calling. Let him some as unox for the
[1:45:56] word of God's sakes. We want to do
[1:45:57] something. Here we go, saints. Beyond
[1:45:59] our duty.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; And if you are already born again of the
[1:46:02] spirit of God and say, "That's my duty
[1:46:04] to go to church. I guess I'll have to
[1:46:06] go." Well, I want to do more than that.
[1:46:08] I want to win some souls for Christ. I
[1:46:11] want to do something. I want to visit
[1:46:12] the sick and do something for him. It's
[1:46:14] my duty to preach at funerals. It's my
[1:46:15] duty to preach the gospel. If my duty to
[1:46:17] pray for the sick, let me do something
[1:46:19] else. Let me get out and do something
[1:46:21] else where God will honor me by it. Oh,
[1:46:25] give the Lord some praises. You know
[1:46:27] about Cornelius in Acts 10. He was a
[1:46:29] just man. He was a devout. He was a
[1:46:31] helpful man. He was a sharing man. He
[1:46:33] was a giving man. He give arms. He kept
[1:46:35] helping people and God recognized that.
[1:46:38] He was doing something that God could
[1:46:40] honor and God honored that man faith.
[1:46:42] God honored that man giving by sending
[1:46:44] Peter to speak to them and while Peter
[1:46:47] was speaking the Holy Ghost fell and
[1:46:48] they were filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:46:50] they got baptized in Jesus name. Oh God
[1:46:52] that mean we could do something that God
[1:46:54] could honor. Oh give the Lord some
[1:46:55] praises. Glory to God. Do you believe
[1:46:58] that?
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Let me give you one more. The woman had
[1:47:02] a daughter vector with the devil. Them
[1:47:04] Pharisees and scribes can't cast out no
[1:47:06] devils. They want to know the devil's
[1:47:07] business. Them is part of the devil
[1:47:08] family too. Them part devil business.
[1:47:09] Them can't cast out nothing. Woman stand
[1:47:12] there. Lord have mercy upon me daughter
[1:47:14] of the devil. She aren't disciples. Help
[1:47:17] me. Help me. Help me. They don't know
[1:47:18] what to do with the woman. They don't
[1:47:20] know how to dismiss the woman. The woman
[1:47:21] standing there. Does she come to Jesus?
[1:47:24] You worship. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:47:25] Hallelujah. Jesus a look at her. He say
[1:47:28] it's not fit to take the children's
[1:47:30] bread and cast it a dog. You see that
[1:47:31] now?
[1:47:33] Express God on news day, Facebook, Tik
[1:47:37] Tok, Instagram
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; pictures going viral. The preacher
[1:47:41] called me a dog. What kind of church is
[1:47:43] that? The last service I went to never
[1:47:44] going back church again.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; The woman stood her ground. She know the
[1:47:47] scribe help. She stood her grounds.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; She call her a dog. It's not fitted to
[1:47:53] the train. And she accept that
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; her spirit
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; accept that. Receive that. And because
[1:48:00] she accept and receive it, she begin to
[1:48:02] see what the dog see.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; She said, "But Lord, even the dog take
[1:48:05] crumbs on the master table."
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; That woman got into a channel,
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; a natural woman saying the right thing.
[1:48:17] Jesus said it this way, "For this,
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; your daughter is delivered."
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; So you understand what happened there?
[1:48:24] She said the right thing. She got
[1:48:27] started. And when she said the right
[1:48:28] thing, fire went up to heaven and power
[1:48:32] went back down and that demon had to
[1:48:35] bust off her daughter. Oh, give the Lord
[1:48:37] a shout. How do you not know your
[1:48:39] attitude this morning? Fire striking
[1:48:42] your house. Give the Lord a shout.
[1:48:46] Something supernatural is about to
[1:48:47] break. If we could get started. Oh, get
[1:48:51] the Hallelujah.
[1:48:54] My my my my
[1:48:57] now when Jesus but I'm saying something
[1:48:59] here important if you notice considering
[1:49:01] the five fishes in order to do something
[1:49:06] Jesus taking something to do something
[1:49:09] with
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; you get
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; in order to bring faith in this building
[1:49:14] tonight for healing Jesus has to take
[1:49:18] something to do something with. So the
[1:49:21] first thing he has to get get somebody
[1:49:22] here that's got faith to be healed
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; and that will strike the audience.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; So you were showing Jesus needed to get
[1:49:29] bread to multiply it.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; You need something to start it.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; If you could get started.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; You can't sit and steer.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; You have to want the woman said if I
[1:49:42] could just touch the hem of his garment.
[1:49:43] Do
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; you have no scripture for that? But she
[1:49:45] told herself that and God set it up that
[1:49:48] Jesus is around with a ton of people
[1:49:50] around him and she had to press away
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; and she pressed until she touched and
[1:49:54] she was healed because she said it to
[1:49:55] herself if I could just touch. I ain't
[1:49:58] taking it for granted. I go dead because
[1:50:00] the doctor says so. I got dead because
[1:50:02] they have no cure for me. They have no
[1:50:04] pills for me. No, I'm going to get
[1:50:05] touched. So, she was pressing for the
[1:50:07] supernatural. She was pressing beyond
[1:50:10] what her husband told her about that
[1:50:11] small church, that noisy church. She was
[1:50:13] pressing beyond that what they told her
[1:50:14] and she got delivered. Oh, give the Lord
[1:50:17] some praises. I want when you come into
[1:50:20] this building, you come to press. You
[1:50:22] come for a touch. You come for your
[1:50:24] breakthrough. You come for a
[1:50:25] breakthrough for your family. You're not
[1:50:27] taking this is how it's supposed to be.
[1:50:28] Come family. You're not taking this is
[1:50:30] how it's supposed to be. Come home. Come
[1:50:32] to church. Go
[1:50:34] home. Ordinary. Same way. No.
[1:50:43] Jesus,
[1:50:45] he taking what faith the blind man had
[1:50:48] or what faith the woman had that was
[1:50:49] deaf and started with that building
[1:50:51] faith. See what I mean? He takes
[1:50:54] something to do something with.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Let's go. If you have to do something
[1:51:02] that you can't do in Jesus name, let it
[1:51:05] alone.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Somebody say take a little drink. You
[1:51:07] can't do that in Jesus name. So let it
[1:51:10] alone.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Somebody say play a little cars. You
[1:51:12] can't do that in Jesus name.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Let it alone. You can't tell smarty
[1:51:16] dirty jokes at your bridge party. You
[1:51:17] can't tell that in Jesus name. You can't
[1:51:19] wear shorts in Jesus name. So let it
[1:51:21] alone. Whatever you do in word or deed,
[1:51:24] do all in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:51:35] So brother I'm talking about he there
[1:51:37] was sitting there a number of other day
[1:51:39] with he came a whirlwind told us brother
[1:51:41] bankswood and them he said we take up
[1:51:45] this rock and threw it up in the air
[1:51:46] said thus say the lord you will see
[1:51:48] right away and I pick up a rock up on
[1:51:51] the top of the mountain and threw it up
[1:51:52] in the air and coming down it started
[1:51:56] the whirlwind
[1:51:58] the suction of it. Then he said these
[1:52:00] words, you have to do something to cause
[1:52:04] something to follow it.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; And that is where I get the inspiration
[1:52:08] from. If you could and you if you get s
[1:52:11] you have to do something for something
[1:52:13] to follow it. Jesus took a piece of
[1:52:16] bread and broke it and then multiplied
[1:52:19] from that piece of bread. He took water
[1:52:22] and poured into a picture. Elijah took
[1:52:24] salt and put it in a cruise. Remember
[1:52:26] when they asked Jesus that the wine run
[1:52:27] out? What did Jesus do? He said, "Draw
[1:52:29] me some pictures of water." And when he
[1:52:32] draw the water water and he poured that
[1:52:35] water bypassed the processes of grapes
[1:52:37] and pressing and and fermenting bypass
[1:52:39] all of that and the water was turned
[1:52:40] into wine. But he take something to have
[1:52:44] make something and he took you. You had
[1:52:46] that something. What is he going to
[1:52:49] make? Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; So, he has to say something to do
[1:52:54] something.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; You have to find you. Oh, praise God.
[1:52:59] So, Bam said this, "And picking up this
[1:53:01] rock thrown in the air coming down
[1:53:03] started the whirlwind."
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:53:10] Praise God. If you could only get
[1:53:12] started.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God will do the rest.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Praise be to Jesus.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; My God. A quote.
[1:53:22] Someone want leave it out here. Hallelu.
[1:53:23] That's a direct quot. If we could only
[1:53:25] get started. The mechanics is here and
[1:53:28] so is the dynamics.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; If you could only get started, God will
[1:53:33] do the rest. Oh, blessed be the name of
[1:53:35] the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:53:38] God.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Musician said, "Get ready. Get ready.
[1:53:41] Get ready. Get ready."
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You don't even
[1:53:43] not know how it's going to finish so
[1:53:44] fast, right?
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; I got started already. You know,
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; God have to do the rest.
[1:53:50] All right. 2 Kings chapter 7 verse
[1:53:54] three. You want to read that scripture?
[1:53:55] 2 Kings 7:3. And there were four lepous
[1:53:59] men
[1:54:01] at the entering in the of the gate, and
[1:54:04] they said one to another, why sit we
[1:54:06] here until we die?
[1:54:09] If we say we will enter into the city,
[1:54:11] then is famine in the city. We shall die
[1:54:13] there.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; If we sit still here, we will die also.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Now therefore, come, let us fall unto
[1:54:22] the host of the Syrians. If they save us
[1:54:25] alive, we shall live.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; If they kill us, we shall die. So this
[1:54:31] is death everywhere.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Death to go in the city because So this
[1:54:35] is death everywhere.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Famine. Death to stay outside
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; because outside is is dead. Death to go
[1:54:44] to the enemy.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; And these guys, listen to their
[1:54:48] testimony.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Verse five. And they arose in the
[1:54:52] twilight to go into the camp of the
[1:54:54] Syrians. And when they were come to the
[1:54:57] uttermost part of the camp of the Syria,
[1:55:00] behold, there was no man there.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; For the Lord had made the host of the
[1:55:06] Syrian. You see that supernatural part?
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; They made a choice.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; They made a decision to act
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; from the most dingiest faith, the lowest
[1:55:17] level of faith. This faith is based upon
[1:55:19] reasoning.
[1:55:20] If we stay here, we will die. If we go
[1:55:22] here, we will die. It's best we go this
[1:55:24] way. There's the enemy outside. Let's go
[1:55:26] this way.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; They might feed us. They might kill us.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; We stand a better chance
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; because these people have no food.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; They have no buffet.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; They have no meat, no drinks, no
[1:55:41] macaroni pie. Don't go. Don't
[1:55:43] imagination go nowhere.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; They have no food back there.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; I We will die there. We going to the
[1:55:50] enemy. And when they make their move,
[1:55:52] they got started.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, if what but what what if they didn't
[1:55:55] get started? They made a move, they got
[1:55:58] started.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the Bible said, "For the
[1:56:02] Lord had made a host of the Syrians to
[1:56:04] hear a noise of chariots and a noise of
[1:56:06] horses and a noise of a great host. And
[1:56:08] they said one to another, lo, the king
[1:56:11] of Israel had hired against us the king
[1:56:13] of the Hittites, and the king of
[1:56:14] Egyptians had come upon us." Wherefore
[1:56:16] they arose and fled in the twilight
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; and left their tents and their horses
[1:56:21] and the camp it was they fled for their
[1:56:24] life. And when the lepers came to the
[1:56:26] uttermost part of the camp they went
[1:56:28] from one tent did eat and drink carried
[1:56:31] silver and gold and rainmen and went and
[1:56:33] hid it. And again they enter another
[1:56:35] tent. Hallelujah. Food another tent.
[1:56:39] Hallelujah.
[1:56:41] Silver and gold. Where you want better
[1:56:43] than that? Okay, give the Lord I shout
[1:56:46] not only silver and bowl you know but
[1:56:47] food on top of that. Hallelujah.
[1:56:50] Afterwards they say it's not right. We
[1:56:52] can't have all this thing here and for
[1:56:54] ourselves. Let us go back to the city
[1:56:56] and tell them there's money. There's
[1:56:58] bounty out here. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:57:00] praises. What a shout. What a praise. If

[2:23:16] and the saints for prayer
[2:23:19] for the pain, swelling, and
[2:23:22] bruising has been improved. Asking for
[2:23:24] continued prayer for total healing. This
[2:23:27] is uh on behalf of Sister Maria
[2:23:29] Nicholas. we would have prayed for her I
[2:23:31] believe a week or so ago.
[2:23:34] So we thank God for his healing and his
[2:23:37] continued prayer.
[2:23:45] Good morning saints. Please pray for
[2:23:47] sister Gloria Timothy for a total
[2:23:49] healing. She's down with a virus. So we
[2:23:51] want to remember in prayer from her
[2:23:54] husband brother Timothy
[2:23:58] from brother Rupert Najir prayer
[2:24:00] requests on behalf of his nephew
[2:24:02] Nicholas Duki who has a domestic issue
[2:24:04] in court asking for God's intervention
[2:24:06] and for deliverance
[2:24:11] from Sister Victoria Brown. Please pray
[2:24:13] for Sister Joan Williams husband. He's
[2:24:16] suffering with his kidneys and
[2:24:18] gallbladder.
[2:24:20] The doctor told him there are stones in
[2:24:21] his kidneys and his gallbladder and they
[2:24:23] sent him home because they find it
[2:24:25] critical and they are thinking to remove
[2:24:27] his gallbladder and treat the kidneys
[2:24:29] until further notice. He's in a lot of
[2:24:31] pain in his chest and his back and is
[2:24:33] unable to eat and is unable to sleep.
[2:24:38] From Sister Emmen Richardson for
[2:24:41] traveling mercies. She'll be traveling
[2:24:43] to the US for a vacation and praying for
[2:24:45] God to remember her. And may God bless
[2:24:49] her going out and her coming in
[2:24:53] and his mercies. And if there's a
[2:24:54] request this morning that you want to
[2:24:56] show by raise of hand as we approach the
[2:24:58] throne of grace this morning,
[2:25:01] shall we bow our heads? Oh gracious
[2:25:03] heavenly father, we thank you Lord that
[2:25:05] it just takes a start
[2:25:09] for you to move on the scene.
[2:25:12] Just the request is an activation
[2:25:15] Lord. You said Lord I stand at the door
[2:25:18] and knock and if any man just open it.
[2:25:19] Just takes that opening and you could
[2:25:22] walk in and fix any situation. You could
[2:25:25] walk into any room and solve every
[2:25:26] problem. Lord, we have stood behind this
[2:25:29] sacred desk so many times and seen
[2:25:31] prayer requests become notes of praise,
[2:25:34] Lord, because that's just who you are.
[2:25:37] You are a God that's interested, as the
[2:25:39] pastor preached, in every aspect of our
[2:25:41] life. Be it our physical, be it our
[2:25:43] financial, our mental, our spiritual,
[2:25:46] there's not an area, Lord, that is not
[2:25:48] of interest to you. And we come this
[2:25:50] morning with Lord various prayer
[2:25:52] requests Lord for our sister Gloria
[2:25:54] Timothy Lord for a total healing Lord
[2:25:56] down with the virus. May the angel of
[2:25:58] the Lord move to where she is right now
[2:25:59] and may you touch her from the crown of
[2:26:01] her head to the soul of her feet and may
[2:26:03] she be completely healed in the mighty
[2:26:06] name of Jesus Christ. Father Lord for
[2:26:09] sister Emin for traveling mercies Lord

[2:26:31] revelation and by experience, Father.
[2:26:34] And for the husband of Sister Joanne
[2:26:36] Williams, Lord, suffering with kidneys
[2:26:38] and gallbladder and how the doctors want
[2:26:41] to remove the gallbladder and and and
[2:26:43] and and try to treat the kidney and he
[2:26:45] can't sleep and he can't eat, Lord. How
[2:26:47] the enemy has attacked, Lord, Father,
[2:26:50] but Lord, healing is a children's bread,
[2:26:52] Father. You are still the great
[2:26:53] physician. There's no situation that you
[2:26:55] cannot deal with. There's no problem you
[2:26:58] cannot solve, Father. Lord, when the
[2:27:00] doctors are scratching their heads,
[2:27:02] Father, you know exactly what to do,
[2:27:04] Father. So, Father, we give you
[2:27:05] permission as the great physician, Lord.
[2:27:07] Father, we welcome your intervention. We
[2:27:10] welcome a second opinion, Lord, a real
[2:27:12] opinion on the matter, Father. Lord,
[2:27:14] that you would step into this situation
[2:27:16] with healing on your wings, Father,
[2:27:18] Lord, to touch and may this request come
[2:27:20] back as a note of praise, Father. And

[2:29:41] sent out the flyer to the church.

[2:29:45] Flock Tabernacle will be ministering on
[2:29:47] Wednesday night. Brother Yoel Peters
[2:29:49] from Bethlehem Tabernacle will be
[2:29:50] ministering on Thursday night. And by
[2:29:52] the grace of God, I'll be ministering on
[2:29:54] Friday night. We would have announced if
[2:29:57] you're interested in going down, please
[2:29:59] let Adrien and brother Andy know so we
[2:30:01] could have a count to be able to
[2:30:03] communicate to brother Norris for those
[2:30:05] who'd like to be there physically. And
[2:30:07] if you can't be there physically, you're
[2:30:09] invited to certainly connect online to
[2:30:11] the services. The services are dedicated
[2:30:13] to the young people. All are welcome,
[2:30:16] but it's dedicated to young people. So,
[2:30:17] make sure and get the young people
[2:30:19] connected. If they can make it to the
[2:30:21] services, we encourage you to do so, but
[2:30:23] certainly get them connected to the
[2:30:25] services. I know God will bless in a
[2:30:27] special way. Do remember brother Norris
[2:30:29] in prayer, the church there in prayer,
[2:30:32] all those that will be ministering in
[2:30:33] prayer as well. By the grace of God, you
[2:30:35] love him. Can we give the Lord a hand of
[2:30:37] praise?
[2:30:39] So once again, there'll be no service
[2:30:41] this coming Wednesday uh here at Tesl
[2:30:44] Tabernacle. There'll be no services this
[2:30:46] coming Friday cuz we'll be in Princess
[2:30:48] Town. And our next service will be this
[2:30:50] coming Sunday uh at 10 a.m.
[2:30:55] Uh a few other announcements. we would
[2:30:58] have uh communicated that on August the
[2:31:01] 31st
[2:31:03] we would have a special service which is
[2:31:04] the last Sunday of this month. It's also
[2:31:08] independence holiday so the Monday will
[2:31:10] be a public holiday as well and a couple
[2:31:12] things will be happening on that day. We
[2:31:14] will be praying for the students that
[2:31:16] are going back out to school. We know
[2:31:19] that there's an extra week that has been
[2:31:20] granted to extend their holiday but we
[2:31:23] will still stick to that date. I see
[2:31:25] some of the young people smiling.
[2:31:28] that one week
[2:31:30] and people like, well, I don't want to
[2:31:32] go to school.
[2:31:35] So, even though there's one more week
[2:31:36] for holidays, we will still stick to
[2:31:39] that date to pray for the young people
[2:31:42] that are going back out to school uh in
[2:31:44] September, as well as celebrate those
[2:31:46] that are graduating from uh the Sunday
[2:31:49] school program. In addition on that day
[2:31:52] um Rodovid would like to also announce
[2:31:54] that we'll have a special thanksgiving
[2:31:56] meal for the entire church. There's no
[2:31:58] cost to you the believers. It's just to
[2:32:01] for us to celebrate and thank God for
[2:32:03] his grace and his mercy. So that day
[2:32:06] would be a day just to come and relax in
[2:32:07] the presence of God. We have a church.
[2:32:10] We have a prayer for all those going out
[2:32:12] to school. We celebrate those are who
[2:32:13] are graduating from Sunday school and we
[2:32:16] celebrate with a meal as a church and we
[2:32:19] have a precious time in the Lord. Sunday
[2:32:20] is the Lord's day. So we come when we
[2:32:22] come to church you shouldn't be thinking
[2:32:23] of heading back home and leave Monday
[2:32:25] for Monday. When Monday reach we leave
[2:32:27] with Monday but when Sunday is here we
[2:32:29] want to celebrate the presence of the
[2:32:30] Lord each other's company and as much as
[2:32:32] we can in his presence. Can we give the
[2:32:34] Lord a hand of praise?
[2:32:38] All right. So, last and certainly not
[2:32:41] least,
[2:32:43] uh after service, after the evening
[2:32:45] service will be brother Michael
[2:32:46] Blackman's group, which is group five is
[2:32:48] Canada to serve. And next Sunday, Lord
[2:32:51] willing, we'll be group four, which is
[2:32:52] brother Malan Alexander's group. So, may
[2:32:55] the Lord richly bless you,
[2:32:59] ushers, deacons in such a special way.
[2:33:04] And yes, I praise you.
[2:33:08] I lift you up and I magnify
[2:33:12] your name.
[2:33:30] I love you, Lord, today
[2:33:35] because you care for me
[2:33:40] in such a special way. And yes, I praise
[2:33:45] you
[2:33:47] and I magnify your name.
