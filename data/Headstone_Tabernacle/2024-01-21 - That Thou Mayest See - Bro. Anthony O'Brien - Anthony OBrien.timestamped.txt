[39:10] God before the minister come out to
[39:12] minister to you this morning I'm uh
[39:15] brother Anthony going be speaking with
[39:16] to you this morning I some point my
[39:18] heart I like to share with you and if
[39:20] you have your Bibles could you do have
[39:21] to stand is from joshu chap 1:8 just
[39:24] quickly a few things I just fell to my
[39:26] heart to bring before he comes on God
[39:29] speaking to Joshua this book of the law
[39:33] shall not depart out of thy mouth note
[39:37] Moses was the anointed Prophet deliverer
[39:39] to bring the people out of Egypt he was
[39:42] called by God to do that but he was not
[39:45] the man to take them over into the land
[39:47] of promise note it wasn't a guaranteed
[39:52] thing so when God make a promise you
[39:54] have to see how it will unfold
[39:57] Moses could only take them so far and no
[40:00] more Moses is dead God anointed Joshua
[40:03] to take them across because God can't
[40:06] lie by this time thousands and thousands
[40:09] of thousands of so-called Believers had
[40:12] died these are the parents of the
[40:15] generation next to go into this land are
[40:18] you with me but even though Joshua is
[40:22] Anointed to take them into this land
[40:25] there are some conditions that God is
[40:27] assigning to him and one of this is in
[40:30] Joshua
[40:32] 1:8 this book of the Lord shall not
[40:35] depart out of thy mouth you have to be
[40:38] speaking it you have to be expressing it
[40:41] you have to be saying it watch this part
[40:43] now but thou sh meditate during day and
[40:45] night you can't speak what you don't
[40:47] know you can't speak what you have not
[40:49] read you can't speak what you have not
[40:51] learned so you have to learn it you have
[40:54] to hear it you have to receive it you
[40:56] have to embrace it then it'll be upon
[40:58] your mouth because from the abundance of
[41:00] the
[41:02] heart say it the mouth speak it if you
[41:05] don't have it in your heart nothing
[41:06] coming through your mouth if you have
[41:08] foolishness in your heart that's what
[41:09] God come out your mouth but if you have
[41:11] the word in your heart that's what going
[41:12] to come out of your mouth he said this
[41:14] book of the Lord shall not depart from
[41:16] thy mouth before it hit your mouth you
[41:18] have to hit your heart before it hit
[41:20] your heart you have to hit your mind so
[41:22] you have to meditate on it day and night
[41:24] oh glory to God Hal Hallelujah do you
[41:27] understand that there are layers and
[41:29] layers of the contract that God give
[41:31] with men oh give the Lord some Praises
[41:34] when you go to a job you have to apply
[41:36] for the job you have to go to an
[41:37] interview you have to pass other people
[41:39] who lining up with you to be interviewed
[41:41] when you get qualified to get the job
[41:43] now they have to give you instructions
[41:44] and if you have to get promotion they

[47:59] the love of
[48:01] God that don't need a five minutes
[48:03] answer or 10 minutes
[48:04] answer two lines that have here read the
[48:07] word and
[48:08] pray read the word and
[48:13] pray that's
[48:17] all I want to add one part of that do
[48:21] it every
[48:24] day remember I school as children listen
[48:27] that song um and you read the Bible and
[48:30] and pray every day and you're going to
[48:31] grow grow grow and you will grow grow
[48:33] grow some people are stunted so because
[48:36] they don't
[48:36] [Music]
[48:38] read I can flip the song the other
[48:41] way because you don't read the Bible and
[48:43] pray every
[48:44] day but
[48:46] Brandon we are Brethren there's no
[48:49] denomination can separate the love of
[48:51] God we are Brethren this will only men
[48:54] know that you're my disciples when you
[48:57] have love one for another you say what
[48:59] are you all learn about them then love
[49:02] is
[49:04] corrective if love doesn't correct then
[49:07] it's not love if you love your children
[49:10] you will tell them the truth you
[49:12] wouldn't hide their sins you will tell
[49:14] the truth because you want them
[49:16] delivered you wouldn't tell them don't
[49:18] tell the ministry you would want them to
[49:21] tell the ministry because you want them
[49:22] to get the help that you cannot give
[49:25] them oh give the Lord some Praises do
[49:28] you get
[49:30] that is a demon will say don't tell the
[49:33] ministry I don't want the ministry to
[49:35] know there's a devil behind there saying
[49:39] that I mean every word I said
[49:41] [Applause]
[49:42] there love is corrective real
[49:46] love love is corrective then it's not
[49:49] love you see your child down on the
[49:50] street and they give them a little
[49:52] posterior protoplasm stimulation which
[49:55] is a ping or put some licks on them or
[49:57] cut the tail as we would say Here let
[49:59] him know he's got to get out the street
[50:01] or perish that is genuine love Junior
[50:05] there I don't know you maybe you
[50:07] shouldn't be out there at this time of
[50:09] the day and the end day when the cars
[50:11] are going pretty fast he said nonsense
[50:14] you cified preacher not the audacity to
[50:16] take God's word and call white white
[50:18] black black right right wrong
[50:21] wrong all right let's go if you make a
[50:24] mistake some woman make a mistake some
[50:27] man made a mistake some boy or girl made
[50:29] a mistake don't
[50:31] sink scream out in
[50:34] dispar Lord save me or I'll perish get
[50:39] desperate about it God will hear you you
[50:43] hear that don't let the devil tell you
[50:45] God will not hear you you know the devil
[50:47] is a
[50:49] liar he said God will hear you he always
[50:53] hear a desperate sh Soul oh give the
[50:57] Lord Us Praise he
[50:59] always not sometimes
[51:03] always he a desperate soul and when you
[51:06] get desperate you don't care who see you
[51:08] you don't care if you to crawl on the
[51:09] ground you don't care if they beat up on
[51:11] the Altar and your nose running on with
[51:13] snack and all kind of Tears around your
[51:16] eye and your way going one way and
[51:18] whatever going with doesn't matter you
[51:20] are desperate oh give the Lord some
[51:24] praises
[51:26] who want to look down at you that is the
[51:27] business you are desperate because you
[51:30] want an answer from God you want to hear
[51:32] from God God will answer your prayer
[51:35] praise God you may be
[51:37] seated
[51:39] desperation you talking about when the
[51:42] wife was about to die with
[51:43] cancer he know that God could heal her
[51:47] and if God could heal the wife God could
[51:49] heal the boy and it chose it in the
[51:51] state of desperation you must come and
[51:54] when you are Des Spirit then God is
[51:57] going to listen to you but if you're
[51:59] just full you don't care whether he
[52:03] does or not well that's different you
[52:06] say you do but it takes desperation to
[52:09] it why I believe that the reason that we
[52:14] don't have desperation is because
[52:16] there's a lack of
[52:19] Love lack
[52:21] of
[52:23] love God
[52:25] the the love of God I think the love of
[52:28] God causes desperation because the love
[52:30] of God brings out brings upon you God's
[52:34] burden these prophets had a burden you
[52:36] know the burden of the Lord to Nehemiah
[52:39] the burden of God the burden you got
[52:42] crowd against sin if you do have the
[52:44] burden to hate sin and hate
[52:50] unrighteousness hiding your brother sin
[52:52] and your sister sin is not righteousness
[52:54] you know you you sending them to hell
[52:56] because if God bnks them if they get hit
[52:58] with a can go and what not they go to
[53:00] hell you know a nice believer in church
[53:02] you know in sin go to hell have a place
[53:05] called hell you know remember this is
[53:07] not the only debt then have a second
[53:08] debt you know remember we striving to
[53:11] meet Glory you know we striving to meet
[53:13] God you know we don't know if we'll wake
[53:15] up in the morning you know we don't know
[53:16] that we wake up and just go to work and
[53:19] what nothing we don't know he holds your
[53:21] life he holds your heart he holds your
[53:25] he he holds your future you are in his
[53:29] [Applause]
[53:32] hands so watch the plans watch the plans
[53:35] see if it's God's will if it's God's
[53:37] plan if it's God's P I think the love of
[53:39] God causes desperation if God is in you
[53:42] the to inside of you and you see the
[53:44] conditions of times and people waiting
[53:45] in sin the way they are it will throw
[53:47] you into desperation that's the thing
[53:50] when you get desperate go to
[53:53] praying almost done here now perfect is
[53:56] perfect coming here about 11 3 minutes
[53:59] 11 it's
[54:01] good you can't be desperate till God
[54:03] speaks to you amen so you want to get
[54:06] God's voice what the devil does now
[54:08] Drive the church kill the anointing
[54:09] there's no Spirit atmosphere you only
[54:11] here intellectual sitting down there d a
[54:13] biscuit no change I told you the same
[54:15] God had G them laws to kill lambs and
[54:17] Rams and bring goats and afterwards the
[54:19] people get so slack they tell the
[54:20] neighbor off around for me off no heart
[54:22] in it they come and come in the church
[54:24] and your heart in church you prefer go
[54:26] beat pan or go Carnival or wear some
[54:28] kind of clothes or go fet or something
[54:29] so but somebody drag inside the church
[54:31] and they come and drag in God don't want
[54:32] that God don't want he I hate your Feast
[54:35] I hate your new moon I hate your
[54:36] offering I hate all of that I can't
[54:39] stand it because these people draw nigh
[54:41] unto me with the mouth but the heart is
[54:44] far from me that's why I have to love
[54:46] God with all your heart your mind your
[54:49] soul and ask God to rip out of you
[54:53] anything that would hinder that love to
[54:58] flow you beated a wife could serve a
[55:01] husband without love she could put to
[55:03] drop the plate on the table and drop the
[55:05] bread or whatever it is and and and she
[55:06] angry and she hateful and miserable and
[55:09] corrupt no love at all but she doing her
[55:12] Duty washing clothes ironing whatever it
[55:13] is she doing she duty but no love you
[55:16] think God want a bride like that you

[55:22] first
[55:24] love you could work I know you could do
[55:27] this I know you could do that and you
[55:28] could do that but where is the love for
[55:30] me to praise me to love me to meditate
[55:32] on me to worship me to honor Me Oh Glory
[55:35] to God to sing unto the Lord with songs
[55:38] hey glory to God hallelujah if you were
[55:42] singing them songs and worshiping
[55:43] marting God the carnival music wouldn't
[55:46] drift your soul or give the Lord a shout
[55:48] in the house because you'll be caught up
[55:50] in what God have you to be
[55:54] in
[55:58] let be
[55:59] seated Hallelujah you can't be desperate

[1:03:07] eyes with isself that thou mayest see as
[1:03:12] many as I love I rebuke and chasen be

[1:03:19] reading now from second Peter 1 amen so
[1:03:22] you'll have to go back to that in the in
[1:03:24] your Bibles but uh just want to read
[1:03:27] from 2 Peter 1:8-9 we know very familiar
[1:03:30] with
[1:03:31] 4-7 talking about those seven uh things
[1:03:34] to be added but uh in verse 8 he says
[1:03:37] something we want to bring for a context
[1:03:39] here from what we just read so from
[1:03:42] verse 8 it says for if these things be
[1:03:43] in you and abound they make you that you
[1:03:45] shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful
[1:03:49] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[1:03:52] Christ but he that lacketh these these
[1:03:54] things is blind and cannot see a far off
[1:03:59] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[1:04:01] from his old sins may God add a blessing
[1:04:04] to the reading of his word let's bow our

[1:05:33] seated uh Amen Let me just take my
[1:05:35] jacket
[1:05:43] off hallelujah praise God
[1:05:47] Amen so
[1:05:50] we here by faith amen we thank God for
[1:05:54] his presence so I have a
[1:05:56] title um this morning for a few
[1:06:00] moments my title is that thou mayest see
[1:06:06] taken right out of Revelation 3 which we
[1:06:09] just read that thou mayest see amen
[1:06:14] that's my title this
[1:06:16] morning and um this thought kind of
[1:06:19] struck me actually late last year and um
[1:06:25] it really struck me at a slightly
[1:06:26] different angle from the scriptures we
[1:06:28] read and I was uh delving in the
[1:06:32] scripture with
[1:06:33] Joseph uh and his story in the Bible and
[1:06:38] I was looking at something that kind of
[1:06:39] stood out at me and I guess that's kind
[1:06:41] of what led me to this thought and the
[1:06:45] thought that stood out to me was
[1:06:47] Joseph's life um we know that he was
[1:06:50] given a dream early on in his life as a
[1:06:53] Young Man and God showed him certain
[1:06:56] things that was to happen but God never
[1:06:59] told him how it was going to
[1:07:02] unfold he just showed him the end part
[1:07:05] of the story almost so it's almost like
[1:07:07] he got a heads up about how this thing
[1:07:10] was going to end up but what he didn't
[1:07:12] know was the road that he would have to
[1:07:15] travel to get to the vision that God had
[1:07:19] for him Hallelujah isn't that right he
[1:07:21] didn't know his brothers were going to
[1:07:24] betray him he didn't know he was going
[1:07:27] to beg for his life he didn't know they
[1:07:29] was going to sell him for some pieces of
[1:07:31] silver he didn't know he was going to
[1:07:34] have to take the long road to Egypt he
[1:07:37] didn't know he was going to be
[1:07:39] forsaken didn't know he was going to be
[1:07:42] abandoned none of that made sense in the
[1:07:46] mind of Joseph but in the mind of God it
[1:07:49] makes perfect sense because he was going
[1:07:51] to bring him to the vision that he
[1:07:53] showed him at the beginning
[1:07:54] he didn't know he's going to be sold as
[1:07:56] a slave didn't know he'd be working in
[1:07:59] poyer's house he didn't know he'd be
[1:08:02] working there and he didn't know he'd be
[1:08:04] betrayed by Piper's wife he didn't know
[1:08:07] he'd end up in prison he didn't know
[1:08:09] about the baker he didn't know about the
[1:08:12] butler none of that made sense but in
[1:08:15] God's mind it made perfect sense he
[1:08:19] couldn't see how all of this was going
[1:08:22] to amount to anything but in God's mind
[1:08:26] this is the Road God had for Joseph
[1:08:29] because where God wanted Joseph was in a
[1:08:32] position of power and in order to bring
[1:08:34] him into Power he had to be stripped he
[1:08:38] had to be uh beaten he had to be
[1:08:41] persecuted he had to be hated Without a
[1:08:44] Cause he had to be ridiculed he had to
[1:08:48] be abandoned he had to be left alone in
[1:08:51] a prison to grow up out a long pad and
[1:08:55] to rot away in a jail cell he had to
[1:09:00] come to terms with the word of God
[1:09:03] concerning his own life oh he didn't
[1:09:06] know
[1:09:08] Hallelujah can I get some more in the
[1:09:10] monitors please amen praise God
[1:09:11] hallelujah he didn't know he'd have to
[1:09:14] go through all that but the wonderful
[1:09:16] part about the story is that when he
[1:09:19] finally come out of prison because God
[1:09:22] calls a dream upon Pharaoh you know the
[1:09:25] story now the hour had come God is
[1:09:27] getting ready to change the season and
[1:09:30] he announced the season with a
[1:09:32] dream isn't that right to the highest
[1:09:34] Authority and start to shake things up
[1:09:36] in the Kingdom all of a sudden it have a
[1:09:39] a um a price on the head for all those
[1:09:43] witches and those who say they no dreams
[1:09:46] come and bring the interpretation all of
[1:09:48] a sudden they have a price on their head
[1:09:50] now things start to shake up people
[1:09:52] frighten new laws passing oh the whole
[1:09:55] Kingdom Under disturbance because of a
[1:09:58] dream oh hallel because of a dream
[1:10:01] because of a dream and it just so
[1:10:03] happened that God have a man there in
[1:10:06] the prison who has the answer who has
[1:10:09] the key to unlock this situation oh that
[1:10:13] God himself has
[1:10:16] orchestrated oh God at a man waiting for
[1:10:19] this very moment oh hallelujah
[1:10:22] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:24] Oh
[1:10:26] Glory oh Hallelujah Joseph come into
[1:10:31] power seven years of plenty Joseph still
[1:10:35] in power things going nice it look like
[1:10:37] he get the biggest promotion ever cuz
[1:10:40] he's second to none other than Pharaoh
[1:10:41] himself isn't that
[1:10:43] right he has the power over the greenery
[1:10:45] and so forth and he's seeing about
[1:10:47] things making sure that things are being
[1:10:49] put aside for the famine that they
[1:10:51] expected to come 7 years after that
[1:10:55] isn't that right and they're going
[1:10:57] through this process and Joseph himself
[1:10:59] is going through this process now think
[1:11:01] of it now he come from prison to power
[1:11:04] he's in power seven years he in power
[1:11:07] and things are I mean things are great
[1:11:10] you know he has all that he could ever
[1:11:12] need anything he need he call it from
[1:11:14] Pharaoh you just write a check for he
[1:11:16] get it but only when his brother showed
[1:11:20] up it's only when the famine set in and
[1:11:23] it's only when the grain was being
[1:11:25] distributed out to different nations
[1:11:28] that's when his brother showed up and
[1:11:30] said me and my brethren are here and we
[1:11:33] we come from a land far away and there's
[1:11:35] a famine and we need help all of a
[1:11:39] sudden it made sense now it it it it
[1:11:43] begin to make sense the picture finally
[1:11:46] begin to come together all the time it
[1:11:49] looked like confusion all the time it
[1:11:51] looked like chaos all the time it look
[1:11:53] like he in jail here he in trouble here
[1:11:56] he tried to do good but evil is present
[1:11:58] praise God he coming through coming
[1:11:59] through he don't understand but right in
[1:12:02] this moment when his brothers stood
[1:12:04] before him oh here it was here was a
[1:12:08] thing God had brought him through all
[1:12:10] this miles for oh hallelujah
[1:12:16] hallelujah oh glory glory glory glory
[1:12:21] glory god never told Jose he had to
[1:12:24] forgive his
[1:12:25] brothers that never came as an
[1:12:27] instruction Joseph you have to forgive
[1:12:29] them but when Joseph looked down the
[1:12:32] long road and he saw what they did to
[1:12:35] him and he saw what God allowed them to
[1:12:38] do forgiveness became the fruit of what
[1:12:43] he saw unfolded before his eyes
[1:12:47] oh Hallelujah it made sense now he said
[1:12:52] God send me ahead
[1:12:54] to preserve life for you oh hallelujah
[1:12:58] oh glory to God Amen and I tell you
[1:13:01] brother I tell you sister what you're

[1:13:10] up but I tell you there's a great
[1:13:12] Destiny for you this morning if thou
[1:13:15] can't believe all things are possible
[1:13:18] God's going to bring you out God's going
[1:13:21] to work it out
[1:13:24] only that to may
[1:13:26] see oh hallelujah hallah oh glory to God
[1:13:32] Amen he put you to the Long Road oh
[1:13:36] Hallelujah went around a long way to
[1:13:39] prove you and to try you you saw
[1:13:43] Darkness you saw dread you saw trials
[1:13:47] you saw testings but I was only to prove
[1:13:50] that The Thirst that God put in your

[1:13:59] there and if God put a thir in you for
[1:14:02] the Holy Ghost then you shall be filled

[1:14:27] [Applause]
[1:14:31] [Music]
[1:14:37] God oh my do you see a
[1:14:44] church so I
[1:14:47] believe God passes us through
[1:14:50] things just so that we could see
[1:14:55] something because if you remain in your
[1:14:57] four
[1:14:58] walls of your perception of
[1:15:01] reality if you remain in your four
[1:15:04] walls you know your four walls very
[1:15:07] wellu you wake up every morning and they
[1:15:09] go to sleep in the same four walls if
[1:15:12] you don't change those
[1:15:13] pictures you know and God knows that
[1:15:16] you'll never get anywhere so sometime
[1:15:18] God have to cause things to happen to
[1:15:21] you to change your picture
[1:15:24] cuz I but over say if you could change
[1:15:27] your pictures you change your world and
[1:15:30] sometimes what we see changes who we are
[1:15:34] so God had to allow us to see something
[1:15:38] present a picture for you that changes
[1:15:41] your understanding of Your World bring
[1:15:45] you on a higher level isn't that right d
[1:15:48] in this 3D World all you're seeing is
[1:15:51] these four walls but God have to to do
[1:15:53] something to elevate you now above what
[1:15:57] you're accustomed seeing at that level
[1:16:00] God have to raise you above that in
[1:16:02] order to catch a fresh Vision in order
[1:16:04] to catch a fresh image catch a fresh
[1:16:07] Hallelujah inspiration in order for God
[1:16:10] to speak to you in order for God to
[1:16:12] shake you he had to pass you through
[1:16:15] stuff some stuff might hurt you some
[1:16:18] stuff might might challenge you some
[1:16:21] stuff make you cry some stuff make you
[1:16:23] moan some stuff make you shake but it's
[1:16:27] good for you because you need the shaken
[1:16:29] to shake you out of what you're in and
[1:16:32] to shake you into God's program somebody
[1:16:35] say
[1:16:36] amen
[1:16:38] hallelujah
[1:16:44] hallelujah think it's in the American
[1:16:46] Army they say that pain is when weakness
[1:16:51] is leaving your body that's what pain is
[1:16:55] pain is when weakness is leaving your
[1:16:58] body oh because after a while you're
[1:17:01] pain in you now but after a while your
[1:17:04] body will begin to adjust to the
[1:17:06] training until it no longer pain in you
[1:17:10] to do 10 push-ups now you need to learn
[1:17:12] the pain of 30 push-ups now you need to
[1:17:14] learn the pain of 50 push-ups what is
[1:17:17] God doing he's building he's building
[1:17:20] he's building something in you something
[1:17:23] that will last something that will stand
[1:17:26] something that will stand the test that
[1:17:29] is coming in these last
[1:17:31] days Goliath is coming you better be

[1:20:45] trumpet he heard behind me a great voice
[1:20:48] of a trumpet John said said I am Alpha
[1:20:51] and Omega this is the announcement I am
[1:20:55] the first and the last what thou seest
[1:20:58] write it in a book and send it unto the
[1:21:01] seven churches which are in Asia unto
[1:21:04] Ephesus and unto SP and so forth amen is
[1:21:06] that right we know it unto lisia as well
[1:21:10] and so when we find it in this letter to
[1:21:12] laia where God rebukes a church and it's
[1:21:16] condition that it has found itself in
[1:21:18] isn't that right amen amen and he says
[1:21:21] here in verse 17 because thou sayest I
[1:21:24] am rich and increased with goods and
[1:21:28] have need of nothing and knowest not
[1:21:32] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[1:21:36] poor and blind and naked what a
[1:21:41] condition to be in isn't that right and
[1:21:44] from what I understand this city in Asia
[1:21:47] Minor of laia was actually a very
[1:21:50] wealthy City it was Wealthy by trade
[1:21:52] trade by Commerce and by industry one of
[1:21:56] the things it was very known for was for
[1:21:59] modern medicine oh and different things
[1:22:01] like that it was actually a wealthy City
[1:22:04] and so the natural type the spiritual
[1:22:06] isn't that right so the condition of the
[1:22:08] people but God is speaking of a
[1:22:10] spiritual thing here a spiritual
[1:22:12] condition oh hallel the attention is
[1:22:15] drawing his attention to he said now so
[1:22:17] tonight uh so this morning we want to
[1:22:19] focus our attention on this state of
[1:22:23] blindness this state of blindness that
[1:22:26] the people in this age have into is a
[1:22:30] state of
[1:22:31] blindness blinded by riches blinded by
[1:22:35] increasing Goods they are blinded by
[1:22:38] Creeds blinded by dogmas blinded by
[1:22:42] their own ideas blinded by their own
[1:22:45] interpretations blinded by their own
[1:22:47] conception of how things are supposed to
[1:22:50] be how things are supposed to go
[1:22:53] those things actually blind you oh from
[1:22:55] seeing the truth from seeing who God is
[1:22:59] from seeing who you are from seeing who
[1:23:01] the devil is and because people are
[1:23:03] blinded by these things because people
[1:23:05] have veils over their hearts they cannot
[1:23:08] see what God is trying to show them oh
[1:23:12] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't
[1:23:14] that right the Pharisees and the
[1:23:17] Sadducees had failed over their hearts
[1:23:20] oh and they couldn't see Christ they
[1:23:22] couldn't see the manifested one walking
[1:23:24] down the streets Healing The Sick
[1:23:27] raising the dead casting out Devils he
[1:23:30] only take good to the people but they
[1:23:32] couldn't see that all they saw was a
[1:23:34] heretic all they saw was a blasphemy all
[1:23:37] they saw was somebody trying to upset
[1:23:40] our stuff upset our way of doing things
[1:23:43] trying to play Hero what they didn't

[1:29:15] tyrants in the pass during the early
[1:29:18] 1900s
[1:29:19] right and God told the prophet he said
[1:29:22] there will arise isms three isms isn't
[1:29:24] that right and one will swallow up the
[1:29:26] other two which you know is communism
[1:29:28] that's swallow up Fascism and Nazism
[1:29:30] right yeah isms and the way the angel
[1:29:34] told the prophet you know is you know
[1:29:36] he's talking about
[1:29:38] spirits spirits that would rise up great
[1:29:41] intellectuals great
[1:29:43] Powers you know Great Men of
[1:29:47] renowned just like in days no same thing
[1:29:50] same Spirit they don't die they just
[1:29:52] take on other bodies new bodies and they
[1:29:55] perform the same uh level of piety and
[1:29:59] Hess thinking themselves
[1:30:02] Gods yeah thinking themselves gods they
[1:30:05] actually say it with their mou
[1:30:07] Hitler Stalin musolini Beto musini the
[1:30:13] all of them had a title the
[1:30:15] fural hey isn't that right isn't that
[1:30:18] right the fur the high one everybody say
[1:30:21] he say
[1:30:22] uh H Hitler yeah that was the salutation
[1:30:25] after he finished his great speech and
[1:30:26] he culminate up to the great climax
[1:30:28] where mother Germany and mother Austria
[1:30:31] this Austrian German Alliance will take
[1:30:33] over the world hi Hitler hi Hitler hi
[1:30:35] Hitler and he prais in his glory Hitler
[1:30:38] himself said he thought to himself that
[1:30:40] he was here to continue the work of
[1:30:44] Christ so I turned cross sideways he saw
[1:30:47] himself as a as almost a pontiff for
[1:30:49] that is as almost a priest for that that
[1:30:52] is Anointed with the spirit of tyranny
[1:30:55] to control and to dominate and to rule
[1:30:58] and to oppress you see they give a
[1:31:01] vision to the people that they know the
[1:31:02] people would like that would sweeten
[1:31:04] their taste wordss yes we'll come
[1:31:06] together we'll have this new policy
[1:31:09] we'll have this new social order and we
[1:31:11] could all benefit from it but what he
[1:31:13] didn't show them was who was supposed to
[1:31:15] sit on the top of the throne and control
[1:31:18] all of this Oneness and all of this Wess
[1:31:20] freeness they was telling the people it
[1:31:23] was just lies because it was just a a
[1:31:25] road map their own personal road map to
[1:31:29] power that's all it
[1:31:31] was and they deceived themselves and
[1:31:34] they deceived the people too because
[1:31:36] they rose up in uh uh positions of
[1:31:39] influence and then begin to seow their
[1:31:43] seeds of discrepancy into the minds of
[1:31:46] people till they become so
[1:31:48] brainwashed that I think during mousy
[1:31:50] Dong's reain people killed teachers
[1:31:53] people kill Elders in the name of what
[1:31:55] they call the Red Army the Red Army of
[1:31:58] Communism and the Book of mouse a tongue
[1:32:01] which told you how to live your life and
[1:32:03] what morals and Scruples to live by
[1:32:05] these men wrote their own Bibles these
[1:32:07] men wrote their own way of doing things
[1:32:10] isms schisms rose up among the people
[1:32:13] but God allow all of that because
[1:32:15] mysteriously in all these isms they all
[1:32:18] had a hate for the Jews they all had a
[1:32:20] hate for God's people and but brandom
[1:32:22] said that was God's gentle hand of
[1:32:25] Jehovah pushing his people back into
[1:32:28] their position into Israel becoming a
[1:32:31] nation into that Olive Branch bringing
[1:32:34] forth again oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:32:37] hallelujah
[1:32:41] hallelujah oh
[1:32:45] my so it's deception it's a deception
[1:32:48] that blinds them makes them see
[1:32:51] different pictures it makes them see the
[1:32:54] pictures of the one who's doing the
[1:32:57] influencing right because there's only
[1:33:00] two
[1:33:01] Powers there's a devil and there's
[1:33:04] godallah that's it it's no rocket
[1:33:06] science if it's not God then it's
[1:33:09] something else and that something else
[1:33:11] could always be attributed to the devil
[1:33:14] because we were born in s shap iniquity
[1:33:16] and the devil know by default you will
[1:33:18] do foolishness
[1:33:19] anyway so he just give you a little
[1:33:22] breadcrumb and as soon as he start up he
[1:33:25] could fly because remember he walking to
[1:33:27] and fro looking to see what destruction
[1:33:29] he cause he do have enough time to spend
[1:33:31] with you but he will start a little
[1:33:33] argument here to get you out of the
[1:33:35] spirit to frustrate you and now he gone

[1:34:00] you forgive anyway when you throw attack
[1:34:03] at you and you apply the word all of a
[1:34:06] sudden he's confused because here's
[1:34:09] somebody who's not responding to the
[1:34:12] wild attacks like everybody else does oh

[1:35:14] strong tower the righteous run into it
[1:35:17] and they are
[1:35:19] saved oh
[1:35:23] Hallelujah when you can hand this word

[1:35:35] and take a timeout they go and steal
[1:35:38] some GS from the
[1:35:43] clinic and go and nurse his wounds

[1:36:23] glory to glory to glory I'm being
[1:36:27] transformed by the renewing of my mind
[1:36:30] that I can prove the acceptable and
[1:36:33] perfect will of God for this end time oh
[1:36:37] hallelujah
[1:36:38] hallelujah give him
[1:36:41] praise oh
[1:36:43] [Applause]
[1:36:48] glory
[1:36:49] amen so these Isam rose up and you know
[1:36:53] how it happened and so forth many people
[1:36:54] died under those regimes
[1:36:57] needlessly young men with so much
[1:37:00] promise women innocent children wars
[1:37:03] were fought people lost their lives for
[1:37:07] what seem like
[1:37:08] foolishness isn't that right what seemed
[1:37:10] like nonsense after a while because like
[1:37:13] Germany today doesn't even look like
[1:37:15] what the Nazi dream that Hitler was
[1:37:18] trying to build there's nothing like
[1:37:19] that today it's completely different
[1:37:22] thing isn't that right all these things
[1:37:24] and what they call the father of modern
[1:37:25] China
[1:37:26] maam you know and some of his thoughts
[1:37:29] still perpetuated you know even North
[1:37:32] Korea North Korea was a was a product of
[1:37:36] the Soviet Union that was the Soviet
[1:37:38] Union's dream they were the fruit of it
[1:37:41] and they're still living under that
[1:37:43] regime they're still living under that
[1:37:46] uh Iron Fist you know of tyranny
[1:37:50] breaking the people breaking into
[1:37:52] people's minds I think just the other
[1:37:53] day a family got out and they were
[1:37:55] saying a new a news exclusive about
[1:37:57] about it about how the family got out
[1:37:59] and you know it was it was interesting
[1:38:02] because one people one person said um
[1:38:04] that newspapers was something you
[1:38:06] couldn't just toss around and throw
[1:38:08] around they had it in a glass case and
[1:38:10] every morning when it come out the new
[1:38:12] fresh paper for the morning would come
[1:38:13] out in this glass case and it had to be
[1:38:16] revered and respected as the words of
[1:38:18] Kim Jong-il or the words of Kim Jong-un
[1:38:20] or whoo whoever is making this news
[1:38:22] exclusive and the point of it is is that
[1:38:24] they cover the people's eyes with their
[1:38:27] perception of reality people in North
[1:38:30] Korea have no access to Google they have
[1:38:32] no access to YouTube They don't know
[1:38:34] about people in
[1:38:35] Trinidad they don't know you exist and
[1:38:38] all they know is that USA is the enemy
[1:38:40] their children are taught to learn that
[1:38:42] USA is the enemy and that Kim Jong-un is
[1:38:45] God that that's right they sit in
[1:38:47] preschools singing Kim Jong-un is God he
[1:38:49] knows our thoughts he's our father he
[1:38:51] will take care of us just like how you
[1:38:54] singing you
[1:38:55] know pop goes a
[1:38:58] weasel they're
[1:38:59] singing worship songs to these leaders
[1:39:04] who have become great influence over the
[1:39:06] people and what God I I I keep seeing it
[1:39:09] I just keep seeing it that God wants to
[1:39:12] influence the people the right way God
[1:39:14] wanted the people to have a king it just
[1:39:17] wasn't king they wanted they wanted Saul
[1:39:20] but God always had in his heart a man
[1:39:23] after his own heart he always had David
[1:39:26] to come and take that throne and to show
[1:39:28] people what true leadership really is
[1:39:31] what true
[1:39:46] [Applause]
[1:39:51] want it I'll give it to you you want
[1:39:52] your inheritance early I'll give it to
[1:39:54] you you do what you want you run your
[1:39:56] run but I know when the time come you
[1:39:59] will truly see what you need and all
[1:40:01] these material things it's not worth it
[1:40:04] anymore all these fads all these
[1:40:06] Fashions all these things that you're
[1:40:08] chasing oh it's not worth it anymore
[1:40:10] because it doesn't satisfy the longing
[1:40:13] in the soul and The Thirst in God the
[1:40:16] heart of man to want more of
[1:40:19] God it's God that put that thirst in
[1:40:22] there oh Hallelujah God put it inside of
[1:40:25] you he put a seed of predestination
[1:40:28] inside of you so that you could hunger
[1:40:31] and thirst after righteousness and the
[1:40:34] Bible said blessed are they that hunger
[1:40:37] and thirst after righteousness for they
[1:40:40] shall be filled this morning if you are
[1:40:43] hungering this morning if you are
[1:40:45] thirsting after righteousness this
[1:40:47] morning don't be afraid don't be ashamed
[1:40:51] lift up your hands open up your mouth
[1:40:53] close your eyes say it's me Lord
[1:40:56] standing in need of prayer it's me Lord
[1:41:00] I'm hungering it's me Lord I'm thirsting
[1:41:04] after righteousness and I want to be
[1:41:08] filled oh may he open your eyes this
[1:41:11] morning that you might
[1:41:14] [Applause]
[1:41:19] see truly
[1:41:22] see what the mirror of the word is
[1:41:24] showing you you'll always
[1:41:27] see your
[1:41:29] inadequacies right that you don't
[1:41:31] measure up when Isaiah
[1:41:33] saw what he needed to see because King
[1:41:37] Uzziah had died and he was a man he
[1:41:39] looked up to he was a man he leaned on
[1:41:42] he was a man he you know he he respected
[1:41:44] his words he respected his presence and
[1:41:46] here he was cut from him and God causes
[1:41:50] that sometimes
[1:41:51] let great men fall so that others could
[1:41:54] see that God Not Afraid as brother say
[1:41:57] Friday to
[1:41:58] kill to let you know that he not taking
[1:42:01] sides with with unrighteousness or that
[1:42:03] he's not taking Sid with filthiness he's
[1:42:06] not taking sides with Idols he not Tak
[1:42:08] inside with worldly desires he not Tak
[1:42:10] side with what you think he not what Tak
[1:42:12] inside with what you feel God is no
[1:42:14] respect to a persons whatever you have
[1:42:17] to cut off he will cut off he will
[1:42:19] remove things from your life
[1:42:21] he will take the surgeon scalper and cut
[1:42:24] things off from your life cut off the
[1:42:26] excess
[1:42:27] flesh cut off the world cut off the
[1:42:31] influence Lust For Women lust for money

[1:42:39] the
[1:42:39] believer oh
[1:42:42] Hallelujah the only life you're supposed
[1:42:44] to see is the Life of Christ Living out
[1:42:48] of you every day living
[1:42:51] for your
[1:42:52] brother oh you thought brotherly
[1:42:55] kindness was for you to stand on a hill
[1:42:57] and say I have brother kindness I for I
[1:42:58] can forgive really really come down from
[1:43:02] that Hill please and go shake hands with
[1:43:05] your brother because that's what

[1:43:09] for godliness to be like God patience
[1:43:13] going knowing what's in their heart
[1:43:15] Temperance knowledge isn't that right
[1:43:17] the prophet said these things it's for
[1:43:19] others he said the gift is for
[1:43:23] [Applause]
[1:43:26] others God wants to raise you up for
[1:43:30] such a time as this just like he raised
[1:43:33] Joseph up for such a time as that to
[1:43:36] bring his brothers out of famine and to
[1:43:38] bring them into a Land of Plenty just
[1:43:41] like God raised up Esther for such a
[1:43:43] time as that he said if I perish I
[1:43:45] perish she said but I got to go into the
[1:43:48] the king's courts to save my people
[1:43:51] there will be a bride on the earth
[1:43:53] she'll be able to go when no man has
[1:43:56] come
[1:43:57] before Oh Hallelujah and plead for our
[1:44:01] family plead for our loved ones plead

[1:44:45] you're representing the kingdom of God
[1:44:48] not this church not this group not not
[1:44:50] this set of Believers but you represent
[1:44:52] the kingdom of God wherever you go you

[1:45:19] Water oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:45:23] hallelujah oh
[1:45:26] myall okay so coming back to this state
[1:45:29] of blindness it's not a natural
[1:45:31] blindness but it's a spirit of
[1:45:34] deception a lack of spiritual
[1:45:38] Insight lack of discernment lack of
[1:45:40] understanding so many things that they
[1:45:43] lack and and and the Bible said there in
[1:45:46] second Peter where we read he that lack
[1:45:48] these things is blind
[1:45:52] that's right there's something you lack
[1:45:54] just like the Rich Young Ruler he knew
[1:45:56] there was something he lack he knew it
[1:45:58] in his Spirit even though people tell
[1:46:00] him you're you're nice you're good you
[1:46:03] you look good mean you have nice clothes
[1:46:05] and stuff like that you know you have
[1:46:07] assets you have you
[1:46:09] know your signature actually holds
[1:46:14] something I don't know if I could say
[1:46:15] the same but his sign could hold
[1:46:17] something you know what I mean when he
[1:46:19] signs so powerful P signature you have
[1:46:22] the assets you have the the goal to back
[1:46:24] that up you know but he still lack
[1:46:28] something he had good material things
[1:46:30] Treasures wealth he had ACR many things
[1:46:34] but he still lacked something and he
[1:46:35] knew it and even though the
[1:46:37] commendations of the people at that time
[1:46:38] might have told him the Pharisees might
[1:46:40] have told him you're good sades told him
[1:46:42] man don't worry about you we cool you're
[1:46:44] name on the list man you have backstage
[1:46:47] pass on worry about that you cool but
[1:46:50] still he knew for
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:54] himself nothing don't beat you more than
[1:46:56] your own conscience he knew that
[1:46:59] something was wrong and the only person
[1:47:02] turns out to give him an answer on that
[1:47:05] was Jesus Christ the only person that
[1:47:07] could turn out was this Homeless looking
[1:47:11] man imagine this rich boy wearing Louis
[1:47:15] vitton and Hermes or whatever they had
[1:47:17] that and and he's coming down to meet
[1:47:20] this looking like a homeless man with a
[1:47:22] bear a straggly bear walking the streets
[1:47:24] of Jerusalem walking the streets of
[1:47:26] Judea and and and and galile with little
[1:47:29] old sandals on and didn't look like much
[1:47:32] but there was a life he was living there
[1:47:34] was something about his Works something
[1:47:36] that you couldn't deny that was real
[1:47:38] about him just his very presence yet
[1:47:41] there was a kindness yet there was a
[1:47:43] love a corrective love an instructive
[1:47:47] love he didn't speak lovely the truth
[1:47:52] he told that boy what he needed to
[1:47:56] [Applause]
[1:47:58] know
[1:48:02] my but it grieved him you know and and
[1:48:06] this is the lesson not all can come to
[1:48:08] itlu Jesus said it easier for a camel to
[1:48:11] pass through the I have an
[1:48:13] needle in M punch then a rich man enter
[1:48:16] the kingdom of God right there is when
[1:48:19] those words made manifest it grieved him
[1:48:21] because he he had many possessions but
[1:48:23] he just wasn't willing to part with it
[1:48:26] he didn't have what it took to give it
[1:48:28] all up for something higher because he
[1:48:31] just couldn't
[1:48:35] see he couldn't see a need for that yet
[1:48:39] am he was told now the truth now he has
[1:48:42] the truth now he has the truth but the
[1:48:44] question is what are you going to do
[1:48:45] with the
[1:48:47] truth that's right you know a a pardon
[1:48:51] is a pardon until accept it as a pardon
[1:48:55] it's a
[1:48:56] pardon the president signed it it's not
[1:48:58] a fake signature it's not an adobe uh uh
[1:49:02] PDF file he literally signed with a pen
[1:49:05] like a real
[1:49:06] pen but you don't
[1:49:09] believe that is for you you didn't
[1:49:12] receive it for
[1:49:13] yourself and so you have to suffer the
[1:49:15] qu consequence of the
[1:49:17] law is not right whatever it says at
[1:49:19] that point because you're not willing to
[1:49:21] accept the pardon here's a way out
[1:49:24] here's a way out of the of the of the
[1:49:26] dire circumstance that you're in and yet
[1:49:29] you're not able to receive what is being
[1:49:31] said about you what a sad condition and
[1:49:35] that's what happen when you don't
[1:49:36] see so that's why we're bringing to you
[1:49:39] this morning that thou mayest see now
[1:49:41] God has a remedy for this we'll get to
[1:49:43] it the definition of blindness it means
[1:49:46] in the in the scientific sense having
[1:49:47] less than uh one out of 10 normal
[1:49:49] condition or normal vision of the
[1:49:51] sufficient eye and so forth like that it
[1:49:52] refers to a sightless person it can also
[1:49:55] refer to Blind
[1:49:57] loyalty you could be loyal and yet still
[1:50:00] blind that's right yeah you could be
[1:50:03] loyal very loyal very willing very able
[1:50:08] yet you're blind because your loyalty is
[1:50:10] going to something going towards an
[1:50:12] effort that actually is leading to
[1:50:14] destruction and it's not leading to
[1:50:16] profit or gain or for the kingdom of God
[1:50:18] or whatever isn't that right you could
[1:50:19] be Loy to things that are that that
[1:50:21] blindly leading you into your death
[1:50:23] isn't that right just like the prophet
[1:50:25] said the goats when they ready to get
[1:50:27] put Lambs into the slaughter they put a
[1:50:28] goat in front and have the Lambs come
[1:50:30] behind him and as soon as they reach the
[1:50:33] slaughter house the goat jump out the
[1:50:34] way pull the go off and the lamb are
[1:50:41] going Hallelujah dead
[1:50:44] lamb blind loyalty just following
[1:50:47] whoever's in
[1:50:49] front
[1:50:50] you get misdirected so I following his K
[1:50:53] cuz he look like he know where he going
[1:50:54] next thing know he pulled by the r shop
[1:50:57] well guess what you in your R shop
[1:51:01] too it happens to us if you don't have
[1:51:05] Google and up following some car
[1:51:07] somewhere where he going he going home
[1:51:09] you need to know where you going you
[1:51:12] need to know where you driving your car
[1:51:14] you need to know where you're staring
[1:51:15] your soul at you need to be guided and
[1:51:18] led by something and God gave us his
[1:51:21] word to lead us and to guide us into all
[1:51:24] truth he said the spirit of truth will
[1:51:26] come he he give you the truth then he
[1:51:29] give you the spirit of Truth he said the
[1:51:31] spirit will come and show you the things
[1:51:33] that I've said and guide you into all
[1:51:35] truth and show you where to place it how
[1:51:38] to place it hallelujah hallelujah here a
[1:51:40] little there a little line upon line
[1:51:42] precept on precept until you come into
[1:51:45] the measure of the stature of the
[1:51:47] fullness of Christ oh and from his very
[1:51:50] own heart he would Place leaders in the
[1:51:52] church some Apostles some prophets some
[1:51:55] evangelists some pastors some teachers
[1:51:58] with this in their hearts with a pyramid
[1:52:01] in their hearts to lead the people to
[1:52:03] Christ it won't be them but it'll be
[1:52:06] Christ directed service oh Hallelujah
[1:52:09] speaking to the people an entrance
[1:52:11] minister to you abundantly into the
[1:52:14] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord Jesus
[1:52:17] Christ God has emissaries this morning
[1:52:22] and I believe he's training such
[1:52:24] emissaries he's training such men in the
[1:52:27] backs side of the desert to meet the
[1:52:30] challenge of the hour because there is a
[1:52:32] challenge what is a challenge Goliath is
[1:52:35] on the field proclaiming to have so much
[1:52:38] power and have so much rank 40 days and
[1:52:41] 40 nights he stands unchallenged what is
[1:52:44] he he is intellect he is mighty powers
[1:52:47] of man he is conly devis Fai
[1:52:50] he is craftiness of men but there's a
[1:52:53] David out there this morning Who's On
[1:52:55] The Backs side of the desert oh
[1:52:57] Allelujah coming to the bear test coming
[1:53:00] to the lion test oh it seems so hard
[1:53:03] this morning but God is putting you
[1:53:05] through test because there's a Goliath
[1:53:08] out there that remains unchallenged who
[1:53:11] can tame those Devils who can tame this
[1:53:14] devil in this last day or this court of
[1:53:16] this evil age who can tame this Lucifer
[1:53:19] voice out there taunting the people and
[1:53:22] dominating the people oh but there was a
[1:53:24] voice that did it one time there was a
[1:53:27] voice that said Lazarus come forth and
[1:53:31] that man came out of a
[1:53:33] gravestone hallelujah praise God a man I
[1:53:36] was dead 3 days 4
[1:53:41] days if he didn't say Lazarus the whole
[1:53:44] grave would have shook loose all of the
[1:53:47] graveyard would have shook loose because
[1:53:49] of that voice
[1:53:50] and God's getting ready in this last day
[1:53:53] to put that voice in you to put that
[1:53:55] voice in a bride and once more this
[1:53:58] Pride will speak and it will flash like
[1:54:01] lightning she will have thust say the
[1:54:03] Lord or keep
[1:54:07] still Hallelujah Give the Lord a shout
[1:54:10] of
[1:54:12] Praise hallelujah
[1:54:15] hallelujah that's why he put you through
[1:54:17] the
[1:54:18] test that's why he put you through all
[1:54:20] those hard stuff because he can't give
[1:54:23] you that power unless you know how to
[1:54:25] handle
[1:54:26] it till he bring to a point where you
[1:54:29] could
[1:54:30] see and even then it's just the start of
[1:54:33] the thing but he needs you to see
[1:54:35] something isn't that right cuz if you
[1:54:37] can see it you can have it your eyes
[1:54:39] need to be open it's not right having no
[1:54:42] regard blind loyalty no regard for
[1:54:43] rational
[1:54:44] discrimination uh dis uh guidance or
[1:54:47] restriction see blind choices lacking a
[1:54:49] Direction
[1:54:50] or controlling conscious a blind Choice
[1:54:52] making a blind Choice it's called it
[1:54:54] impulsive Choice isn't that right just
[1:54:56] take it
[1:54:57] blindly not thinking it through five
[1:55:01] years down the road will this thing
[1:55:02] still make sense just do it blindly and
[1:55:05] we suffer the consequences of those
[1:55:07] isn't that
[1:55:09] right they call it drunk sense blindness
[1:55:11] all is still blindness made or done
[1:55:14] without the sight of certain objects or
[1:55:15] knowledge or certain facts means you
[1:55:17] were delious or deluded by something
[1:55:20] caus you to be
[1:55:22] intoxicated think spiritually now
[1:55:25] Intoxicated by something drunk with
[1:55:27] something isn't that right and it uh H
[1:55:31] uh blurred your vision it clouded your
[1:55:33] judgment that's right was like cotton in
[1:55:35] your mind Lord you to make a choice that
[1:55:39] outside of your right thinking you would
[1:55:40] not have made but the people are
[1:55:42] following blind Illusions today why
[1:55:45] because they rejected this
[1:55:47] word Adam couldn't fall until he first
[1:55:50] let go this word multiply and replenish
[1:55:54] Hall God is going to show in the
[1:55:55] Revelation that later on but he couldn't
[1:55:58] he didn't hold on to it he let go the
[1:56:00] word and he took the interpretation that
[1:56:02] Eve brought from The Serpent and that's
[1:56:05] how they lost the whole thing isn't that
[1:56:07] right so in order to get back the thing
[1:56:09] we have to come back to the word oh H if
[1:56:12] we come back to the word then we come
[1:56:14] back to the will and program of God
[1:56:17] it'll be restored to man once again when
[1:56:19] to get back to this word oh Hallelujah
[1:56:21] men F by the word by letting go the word
[1:56:24] and taking the devil's lie and now to be
[1:56:26] restored today we have to resist the
[1:56:27] devil's lie and take back up the word of
[1:56:30] God take back up our sword oh hallelujah
[1:56:34] hallelujah hallelujah I begin to slice
[1:56:36] and cut our way back to Redemption again
[1:56:40] amen isn't that right oh my okay so
[1:56:43] certain objects knowledge certain facts
[1:56:45] right a blind taste all all these things
[1:56:46] here see just bring it out slowly lack
[1:56:49] lacking or having a grow lacking a
[1:56:51] growing point or producing leaves
[1:56:52] instead of flowers blindness difficult
[1:56:54] to discern make out discover it's hidden
[1:56:57] from sight see uhh all these things it's
[1:57:00] blindness all right so now God gives
[1:57:03] remedy to this
[1:57:04] situation to this spiritual condition

[1:57:10] says I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[1:57:14] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[1:57:17] rich oh so you thought you was rich no
[1:57:20] no no you need God's goal in order to be
[1:57:23] rich and God's goal is character
[1:57:27] formation that is God's goal not this
[1:57:31] material thing that we make so much

[1:57:36] others that's not the real goal but said
[1:57:39] that is caner that is rust that's just
[1:57:42] material things but what God wants to

[2:01:15] some other way because those that do
[2:01:18] that will be casting out of Darkness

[2:01:26] pretty much amen these are the things we
[2:01:28] need here see he said now anoint th eyes
[2:01:31] with eyes that thou mayest see praise
[2:01:34] God isn't that right loud thisa was
[2:01:36] known for its medicines to be able to
[2:01:38] heal the eyes praise God to heal vision
[2:01:41] and God is saying while you have all
[2:01:42] this natural medicine but you all don't
[2:01:44] have spiritual vision all this natural
[2:01:46] vision all you claim to have all you can
[2:01:48] make glasses into two days pray all have
[2:01:50] all this advancement in technology and
[2:01:52] scientific but you can't give yourself
[2:01:55] spiritual vision you need my eyes in
[2:01:57] order to let you see what you need to
[2:02:00] see in these last days or you'll walk
[2:02:02] blind or you'll walk not knowing oh
[2:02:05] where to put your foot oh H but the word
[2:02:08] of God has to be a lamp onto your feet
[2:02:11] has to be a light onto your path so that
[2:02:13] you could see where you're going what
[2:02:16] you're going to
[2:02:21] you to open your
[2:02:23] eyes then you have to give you a lamp
[2:02:25] which is a word to show you where to go
[2:02:29] just like the foolish virgins isn't that
[2:02:31] right five or wise five or foolish but
[2:02:34] they all had
[2:02:35] lamps isn't that
[2:02:38] right they all had vessels with oil in
[2:02:40] it but one had extra and one didn't now
[2:02:45] the thing I love about lamps we talk
[2:02:47] about five wise five version right right
[2:02:49] so we're showing the difference between
[2:02:50] two groups and that's how Jesus
[2:02:51] Illustrated it right but when you look
[2:02:54] at it a lamp you can't the lamp that
[2:02:57] long time lamp was like a finger thing
[2:02:59] there a little thing you hook your
[2:03:00] finger in it was like a little spout it
[2:03:02] had the oil inside and the wick and the
[2:03:04] end of the spout and that was the light

[2:12:44] you and he knows you'll come to the
[2:12:46] knowledge of a truth at some point point
[2:12:48] in time so he gave you just enough rope

[2:12:54] but when he's ready for you he'll pull
[2:12:56] his rope of
[2:12:58] predestination there's only so far that

[2:13:44] way oh though he seemed unlovable he C
[2:13:48] something on us worth loving and that's
[2:13:50] why he died for us this morning that's

[2:17:42] that right amen all right also they were
[2:17:45] blind he said no that's a bad way to be
[2:17:48] he said I don't think these Christians
[2:17:50] was so blind as they was nearsighted he
[2:17:53] said I believe they were nearsighted he
[2:17:56] said and the only thing they could look
[2:17:57] at was their big buildings oh so they
[2:18:00] could they could only see right in front
[2:18:01] of them near sighted I believe I'm a bit
[2:18:04] near side of myself amen if I took this
[2:18:06] off I can't see your
[2:18:08] face so I could enter into the scripture
[2:18:10] here this uh this quote in
[2:18:12] Prophecy because you could only see so
[2:18:14] much I could stay here and just read
[2:18:16] this but can't see a far off
[2:18:18] and that's the problem the people can't
[2:18:19] see a far off and they have forgotten
[2:18:22] that they were purged from their old
[2:18:23] sins and somewhere along the way they
[2:18:25] end up straying from the truth 2 degrees
[2:18:28] north 2 degrees north 2 degrees north
[2:18:30] then later on now you find them
[2:18:31] themselves way off to the side somewhere
[2:18:34] what happened they got off from the
[2:18:36] Beaten Track they got off from the
[2:18:38] beaten word they fell away from their
[2:18:40] first love oh hallah like we heard on
[2:18:43] Friday remember from whence thou was
[2:18:46] fallen and come back the voice of God is
[2:18:49] calling out to you this morning come
[2:18:52] back to your first love come back to
[2:18:54] when he loved you come back to when you
[2:18:56] felt his power to when you felt his
[2:18:58] presence God wants to keep pushing you
[2:19:00] on on on into the resurrection but
[2:19:03] you've got to stay burning for him
[2:19:05] burning with desire burning with love
[2:19:08] for him oh love to pray love to get into
[2:19:11] his presence love to be in his presence
[2:19:14] love to come to church praise God love
[2:19:16] to create an atmosphere all these things
[2:19:18] here isn't that
[2:19:19] right oh
[2:19:21] man but the people got blinded they got
[2:19:23] blinded by
[2:19:25] things cares of this life isn't that
[2:19:29] right seed is soon many fall here and
[2:19:32] there some fall upon this Wayside isn't
[2:19:35] that right and the Wayside from what I
[2:19:38] understand is like a pavement it's like
[2:19:40] they take I think they they used to take
[2:19:42] a flattening thing long time and they
[2:19:43] used to flatten the ground they make it
[2:19:45] hard so the point of the way side is
[2:19:47] it's hard ground it doesn't catch and
[2:19:50] receive the seed that is being sown out
[2:19:54] there it's so hard that it can't take
[2:19:56] root so it it matted down it's not soft
[2:20:00] it's not pliable there's no reception
[2:20:03] there for the seed to come in and to
[2:20:05] work in there nothing wrong with the
[2:20:07] seed but it's where the seed is falling
[2:20:10] that's the story of the parable there
[2:20:13] some fell upon Wayside some fell upon
[2:20:14] thny some fell upon uh is not right the
[2:20:17] cares of Life some fell up on Weeds
[2:20:20] cares of Life wrap around them it start
[2:20:22] off small but it keep increasing in
[2:20:25] strength increasing increasing and what
[2:20:27] happened it choked the life of the seed
[2:20:30] it couldn't produce it couldn't come on
[2:20:32] to producing fruit it start off hot and
[2:20:34] sweaty start off looking like something
[2:20:37] looking with soap full of promise and
[2:20:39] all of a sudden things legitimate things
[2:20:42] honest things normal things everyday day
[2:20:45] things was allowed to choke the things
[2:20:49] around that plant until the life begin
[2:20:51] to get sucked out of it these things are
[2:20:54] parasitical they are parasites in nature
[2:20:57] they suck the life out of the thing that

[2:26:08] all around and it looks so Bleak and it
[2:26:10] look so dark and it looked like nobody
[2:26:13] care about you when the prophet was
[2:26:15] talking about how he lost his daughter
[2:26:17] shanon Rose isn't that right and his
[2:26:20] wife hope and so on when he was going
[2:26:21] through all of that isn't that right the

[2:26:54] connect it started to make
[2:26:58] sense he started to collapse this devil

[2:32:48] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[2:32:51] God Amen back to the Holy Ghost again

[2:32:55] a man be born when he's old can he enter
[2:32:57] a second time into his mother's womb and
[2:32:58] be born and Jesus answered ver fairily I
[2:33:00] say unto thee except a man be born of
[2:33:03] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[2:33:07] into the kingdom of God that which is
[2:33:10] born of the flesh is flesh excuse me and

[2:33:14] Spirit Marvel not that I say today you

[2:33:38] isn't that right Christ is the Miss of
[2:33:40] God revealed said he's the principal
[2:33:42] theme of the entire Bible if you read
[2:33:44] the Bible and you don't see Christ in
[2:33:45] every verse of it go back and read it
[2:33:48] again he said see if you can't see
[2:33:50] Christ in every verse then read it again
[2:33:52] because you missed something the Bible
[2:33:55] is Christ and he is his word and when
[2:33:58] his word is Anointed it is the bomb you
[2:34:00] need oh to treat with the matter to
[2:34:03] treat with the disease to treat with
[2:34:05] your insecurity to treat with your
[2:34:08] imperfection the word has a remedy the
[2:34:11] word has the answer the word has the
[2:34:15] medicine Amen brother bam was preaching
[2:34:18] he said for years I keep ping the
[2:34:19] medicine down their throat and they keep
[2:34:21] spitting it back up through my fingers
[2:34:23] he said God will judge you for
[2:34:25] that God give his medicine by his word
[2:34:28] of God H people keep spitting it back
[2:34:30] out say they don't believe this they
[2:34:31] don't believe that oh I don't think the
[2:34:33] that applies to me and whatnot trying to
[2:34:35] reason it out God don't need no
[2:34:38] interpreter he is his own interpreter he
[2:34:41] will interpret his own word and he will
[2:34:43] manifest his own word he don't need us C
[2:34:46] interpreted and if God says separate
[2:34:47] yourself from all unbelief then that is
[2:34:49] a word of God then that is a commandment
[2:34:52] of God then we have to honor that
[2:34:54] commandment if God said forgive your
[2:34:56] brother forgive your sister oh H then we
[2:34:59] have to
[2:35:01] obey God commands us to do
[2:35:04] it we have to
[2:35:06] see that it is
[2:35:09] necessary but one time brother brandham
[2:35:11] couldn't see he sit in a barro there

[2:35:27] is not right and pul him to the side
[2:35:29] watch and allowed him to see
[2:35:32] something showed him a
[2:35:34] vision isn't that right something broke
[2:35:37] upon him he saw his own sins and so like
[2:35:39] that oh we know the story we saw Christ
[2:35:41] on the cross saw that blood pouring out
[2:35:43] like a bumper pumping his sins away and
[2:35:45] every time he would do something wrong
[2:35:47] the blood would pump his sins away and
[2:35:48] every time he made a mistake he lie he
[2:35:51] cheat he steal the blood would pump his
[2:35:53] sins away isn't that
[2:35:55] right and then Jesus thr away his sins
[2:35:58] pardoned it and thr it away and said now
[2:36:00] watch said now if you con uh if I
[2:36:03] forgive you then how could you go and
[2:36:05] condemn her praise God then he come out
[2:36:07] of it isn't that right now he's seen it
[2:36:09] now he knows what he has to do oh he
[2:36:12] went to that woman he said woman I was
[2:36:13] just condemning you but God showed me
[2:36:15] something and he began to talk to that
[2:36:17] woman yes now here's the amazing part of
[2:36:19] that story Hallelujah here was the

[2:36:29] to the point where he he was he was he
[2:36:31] was on his knees now in his spirit cuz
[2:36:34] God brought him to his knees and showed
[2:36:36] him his own sins after having a
[2:36:38] conversation with the woman only to find
[2:36:40] out that she was once a
[2:36:42] Christian that she knew the Lord but she
[2:36:45] had just Fallen away from the way oh H
[2:36:48] and just needed to get back it was so
[2:36:50] easy in his own eyes to see that she was
[2:36:53] a heathen and that she was lost and he

[2:41:39] the hitless he got stried off and yet
[2:41:41] still God changed that man around and if
[2:41:43] God could do that for that man then go

[2:41:47] believe it that way I don't know whose
[2:41:49] name is on the book but let us live in
[2:41:51] such a way that we could draw men unto
[2:41:54] Christ that whosoever should be saved
[2:41:57] could have the opportunity to be saved
[2:42:00] to come to the altar to make it right
[2:42:03] with God to make it through oh
[2:42:06] Hallelujah that Golden Gate oh Hal
[2:42:09] everyone deserves a
[2:42:12] chance we have to see it that way we
[2:42:14] don't know who it is so we have to
[2:42:16] present the gospel in that way that all
[2:42:19] have an opportunity we know not all may
[2:42:21] not respond but all deserve a chance you
[2:42:25] deserve a chance to come you deserve a
[2:42:26] chance to hear he that hear Let Him hear
[2:42:30] what the spirit of Lord is saying to the

[2:43:13] finished amen my praise God amen well
[2:43:15] I'll wind up anyway amen praise God oh
[2:43:18] he's the principal team of the Bible
[2:43:19] isn't that right oh my so we come into
[2:43:20] this world in a blind State not knowing
[2:43:22] right from wrong not knowing which way
[2:43:23] is up and it took God to show us the way
[2:43:27] to reveal himself isn't that right and
[2:43:29] show us that we no longer walk in
[2:43:31] darkness and that same Jesus that opened
[2:43:33] the eyes of one blinded the eyes of
[2:43:35] another isn't that right and we know
[2:43:37] that even the Jews were blinded so that
[2:43:39] we could be crafted in oh the only
[2:43:41] reason we have a chance because someone
[2:43:43] else was blinded so that you could have
[2:43:45] have an opportunity to access the Throne
[2:43:47] of God oh for a limited time only you
[2:43:50] have an opportunity to access the Throne
[2:43:52] of God before the Judgment before it
[2:43:54] turns over and it turns back to the Jews
[2:43:56] again oh H isn't that right amen amen St
[2:43:59] John 1 in the beginning was the word and
[2:44:00] the Word was it God and the Word was God
[2:44:03] and the same was in the beginning with
[2:44:04] God all things were made by him and
[2:44:07] without him was not anything that was
[2:44:08] made in him was life and the light of
[2:44:11] men and he was in the world and the
[2:44:13] world was made by him and knew him and
[2:44:15] the world knew him not he came unto his
[2:44:17] own and his own received him not but as
[2:44:20] many as received him this morning to
[2:44:23] them gave he power to become the sons of
[2:44:26] God even to them that call upon his name
[2:44:30] do you believe it this morning a many
[2:44:32] which were born not of blood nor of the
[2:44:34] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[2:44:37] but of God and that word was made flesh
[2:44:40] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[2:44:43] glory the own Glory as only of the god
[2:44:45] of the father amen all right praise God
[2:44:48] St John 1240 said he had blinded their
[2:44:50] eyes hardened their heart that they
[2:44:53] should not see with their eyes nor
[2:44:54] understand with their heart and be
[2:44:56] converted and that I should heal them
[2:44:58] and these things said isaas when he said
[2:45:00] Saw His glory and speak of him and the
[2:45:02] Bible said nevertheless among the chief
[2:45:04] rulers also many believed on him but
[2:45:07] because of the Pharisees they did not
[2:45:09] confess him lest they should be put out
[2:45:11] of the synagogue for they love the
[2:45:13] praise of men more more than the praise
[2:45:16] of God so some know the truth but they
[2:45:19] wouldn't come to the fullness of the
[2:45:20] truth praise God because their heart is
[2:45:22] somewhere else and where your heart is
[2:45:25] that's where your Treasures will be oh
[2:45:27] Hallelujah is that right oh they build
[2:45:29] their Treasures on natural things on the
[2:45:31] praise of men don't do that this morning
[2:45:34] build your hopes on things Eternal and
[2:45:37] hold to God's unchanging hand this
[2:45:39] morning hold on to his hand oh because
[2:45:43] when the Rapture goes his hand will go
[2:45:44] up and you'll go up with it if you're
[2:45:47] holding to him oh isn't that right amen
[2:45:51] and amen amen oh Hallelujah Queen of
[2:45:54] Sheba the prophet said we find that
[2:45:55] those who ordained to life saw it and
[2:45:58] those who were not ordained to life
[2:46:00] didn't see it the gospel blinds those
[2:46:02] who are not willing to accept it and
[2:46:04] it'll give sight to those who are
[2:46:06] willing to accept it he said and that's
[2:46:08] the way it was in his days and when the
[2:46:10] scripture plainly stated exactly the
[2:46:12] things that he did and said he would do
[2:46:13] it and how they missed it it showed that
[2:46:16] they had to be blinded and to think them
[2:46:19] poor Jews were blinded that our eyes
[2:46:20] might have a chance to be open this
[2:46:22] morning and now the same gospel that
[2:46:25] blinded the Jews is blinding the church
[2:46:28] he says today it's the same thing
[2:46:30] promise exactly he said and it goes a
[2:46:33] million miles over their heads he said
[2:46:35] I'm glad you're recording that Prophet
[2:46:36] said I'm glad they did amen I know that
[2:46:39] thus say the Lord that's the gospel the
[2:46:42] same gospel that blinded the Jews is now
[2:46:45] blinding the Gentiles oh my it's the
[2:46:48] same Jesus because it's the same gospel
[2:46:50] and for there's no other gospel but the
[2:46:51] gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ he said
[2:46:54] we have many Creeds but there is one
[2:46:56] gospel he said and what is the gospel
[2:46:59] the gospel came not in word only but
[2:47:01] through Power and demonstration and
[2:47:04] through manifestations of the Holy
[2:47:07] Spirit to prove that it was the Gospel
[2:47:10] the sick were heal the blind saw the
[2:47:13] cripples walk the gospel was preached in
[2:47:16] its power oh and that same thing is
[2:47:18] coming back again God is raising up you
[2:47:21] this morning to prove the gospel to be
[2:47:23] right the cripples will walk the blind
[2:47:26] will see oh the lame will walk oh H
[2:47:30] there will be a Revival once again and
[2:47:33] this world will hear direct from God do
[2:47:35] you believe it this morning oh
[2:47:37] hallelujah hallelujah oh manifestation
[2:47:40] of the Holy Spirit god making his word
[2:47:41] come to pass it had to be that for in St
[2:47:44] m 16 he said go into all the world and
[2:47:47] preach the gospel and these sign shall
[2:47:49] follow or otherwise go into all the
[2:47:50] world and demonstrate the power of the
[2:47:53] Resurrection is what that means amen he
[2:47:56] expands on it he's not dead but he's
[2:47:58] alive resurrection power healing and
[2:48:00] sick and so forth amen doing the same
[2:48:02] Miracles he did when he was alive isn't
[2:48:05] that right and he's depending on you and
[2:48:06] I to let him work through us to will his
[2:48:11] will oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that
[2:48:14] right oh oh my I can go on there but I I
[2:48:16] think we got the point amen oh my
[2:48:18] Hallelujah we touched on this oh
[2:48:20] wonderful praise I can skip all this
[2:48:21] through here amen let's get ready to
[2:48:23] wind this up amen oh
[2:48:25] hallelujah oh my do you love him this
[2:48:27] morning amen praise God hallelujah thank
[2:48:31] you Jesus thank you Father he said see
[2:48:34] now down to the age we started off to
[2:48:35] the foundation from the first age when
[2:48:37] the seed went in the ground the complete
[2:48:39] seed then it come through the feet
[2:48:41] Luther then it come back out through
[2:48:43] Wesley then into Pentecostal then the
[2:48:45] tongues in the lips see and now it's in
[2:48:48] the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so
[2:48:51] forth and now there's nothing else left
[2:48:54] for it to come but him himself to step
[2:48:57] into that oh what's next to come he
[2:49:01] himself to step into your 16 elements to
[2:49:05] step into his bright body isn't that
[2:49:07] right cuz that's the last thing there is
[2:49:09] and he said the next is the intelligence
[2:49:12] oh hallelujah hallelujah the Supreme we
[2:49:15] have no intelligence of our own but his
[2:49:17] he said and we have no sight of our own
[2:49:19] praise God we can how can man foresee
[2:49:22] these things see he can do it it's God
[2:49:24] himself see it's becoming to a place and
[2:49:27] he's governing the body all the way
[2:49:28] through and then the complete body of
[2:49:31] Christ is revealed in the form of a
[2:49:33] bride that was taken out of his side
[2:49:35] like Adam did the beginning like Adam's
[2:49:38] was rather at the beginning isn't that
[2:49:39] right oh my my think of man's filter he
[2:49:41] said and I said this morning so this was
[2:49:43] the ABS the message after afterwards he
[2:49:45] comes back and talks about it again he
[2:49:46] says we're in the C and age on the top
[2:49:48] there's no more faculties above that
[2:49:50] that you can move outwardly to know you
[2:49:51] can move from your nose smell from your
[2:49:53] lips uh you can smell from your nose
[2:49:55] sorry move from your lips you can speak
[2:49:57] from your lips and so forth from your
[2:49:58] hands you could feel you could reach and
[2:50:00] your feet and so forth but you can't go
[2:50:02] farther than your eyes and Malachi 4 has
[2:50:05] come he said sight and it shall be light
[2:50:08] about the evening time he said oh walk
[2:50:11] in the light we'll walk in the light a
[2:50:13] beautiful light
[2:50:15] that comes where the D Drops of mercies
[2:50:17] are bright that shine All Around Me by
[2:50:20] day and by night Jesus the light of the
[2:50:23] world Amen he said yes sir pass through
[2:50:26] it oh brother he said and you will come
[2:50:28] out with a holy man's taste you will
[2:50:31] come out with the Holy Ghost amen
[2:50:34] musician can get ready to come forward
[2:50:36] I'm almost finished isn't that right oh

[2:50:42] love him glory to to God
[2:50:46] hallelujah oh my let me just get
[2:50:48] something here real quick and then we
[2:50:50] look to close all right amen so here's
[2:50:53] my final thought this morning after the
[2:50:55] scripture we read be zealous therefore
[2:50:59] and repent praise God that's what Jesus
[2:51:01] is saying isn't that right Hallelujah he
[2:51:04] that lack at these things is blind and
[2:51:06] can't see a far off and that forgotten
[2:51:09] that he was purged from his old sins oh
[2:51:11] H we need a long range vision though it
[2:51:14] t wait for it for it shall surely come
[2:51:18] to pass it shall not t oh right the
[2:51:21] vision make it plain oh Hall he can see
[2:51:25] it could run with it oh H the gospel is
[2:51:28] being made plain today it's never been
[2:51:30] made plain in ages past but it's being
[2:51:33] made plain this morning and what we see
[2:51:36] ought to get us desperate what we see or
[2:51:39] to get us on fire what we see or to get
[2:51:42] us a Praying or to get us a calling upon
[2:51:45] God or to get us to be zealous be
[2:51:48] zealous for his word be zealous for the
[2:51:50] things of God be zealous oh but what's
[2:51:53] the problem we need to see something we
[2:51:56] need to eyes myself this morning we need
[2:51:58] an anointing to come upon our eyes and
[2:52:01] take the scales off off of us take the
[2:52:03] largy off take the slothfulness off take
[2:52:07] the weariness off take the laziness off
[2:52:10] take the no praise demons off take off
[2:52:12] the unwillingness oh to do what's right
[2:52:15] oh Hallelujah give you a spirit of love
[2:52:19] a spirit of passion to know the word a
[2:52:23] cry to get into the spirit a fur desire
[2:52:27] to please God that's what we need in the
[2:52:29] house of God when we come in here we
[2:52:32] ought to be burning for Jesus we ought
[2:52:35] to be burning and if we're not burning
[2:52:37] this morning then we need a burden we
[2:52:39] need to catch a burden for the things of
[2:52:42] God for the program of God for the love
[2:52:44] love of God for the power of God oh to

[2:53:11] by my name shall humble themselves and

[2:53:24] will heal their land oh hallelujah
