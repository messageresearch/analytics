[13:11] amen let's bow word of prayer tonight
[13:13] father we thank you for guiding us
[13:15] together this way and through technology
[13:17] we have this opportunity to be in the
[13:19] same virtual room that we can cry out
[13:21] and call upon your name father it's
[13:24] coming down to crunch time now we see
[13:28] Wars rumors of War we take we see things
[13:30] like a slow burner heating up the world
[13:33] will be on fire set your church on fire
[13:36] set your people on fire bring them into
[13:38] a god Consciousness and awareness that
[13:41] the god of the Bible is true the god of
[13:43] the Old Testament is real the god of
[13:46] that made promises is true Lord you will
[13:49] keep your word just as you spoke it
[13:50] through the mouth of your prophets come
[13:52] and Inspire us tonight as we look to you
[13:55] father we not look into bosses we're not
[13:57] look into jobs not look into we have a
[13:59] roof over our head we look to you the
[14:02] source of our lives and the one that we
[14:04] trust tonight granted father in Jesus
[14:07] name we ask it amen and amen you know as
[14:11] brother Gan singing that song about
[14:14] trust it because of this scientific age
[14:19] and this age of total knowledge and
[14:22] information
[14:23] man is trusting science more trusting
[14:28] his money more trusting his work more
[14:31] and I was doing some work on a message
[14:35] and I discover where B is speaking
[14:39] about how the money system will be
[14:42] destroyed and the reason for all of this
[14:46] is because Satan want dominion and
[14:51] control the be system like how the Bible
[14:54] talk about no man shall be able to buy
[14:56] or sell unless he has the mark of the
[14:59] Beast it's a system and that system is
[15:03] about control total control control in
[15:07] politics control in religious control in
[15:10] in every aspect of life
[15:14] control years
[15:16] ago it was money tied to the gold
[15:19] standard they switch from that and then
[15:21] is printing money and the prophet propes
[15:24] go back to the gold standard things
[15:26] going to be rocking
[15:29] is going to be
[15:30] shaken they have to wreck the system
[15:33] that we know now to bring on this whole
[15:35] new
[15:36] system the system of control and I am
[15:39] asking myself the question if the devil
[15:42] through the Beast and the image of the
[15:44] Beast and this whole system that they're
[15:46] trying to introduce they need the
[15:49] technology to achieve it because when
[15:53] Jesus was
[15:55] tempted and the devil told him all these
[15:57] kingdoms are mine
[15:59] to give it to whomsoever I want and so
[16:01] Jesus didn't fight him on that and said
[16:03] no it's not yours it's mine no no Jesus
[16:05] didn't do
[16:06] that the devil know what he's talking
[16:08] about because he is the God of this
[16:11] world the God of this evil he knows
[16:14] that he knows that um he is reigning
[16:17] right now he's ruling right now and that
[16:21] is why the the the bride will be pressed
[16:25] because he know that his time is short
[16:28] because the prophecy say so and the word
[16:30] say
[16:30] so we creatures of time who were born in
[16:34] sin and shape iniquity coming into a
[16:37] knowledge of God coming into a
[16:40] revelation of God to understand the call
[16:43] that God put Upon Our Lives to represent
[16:46] him and to stand for him in the last
[16:49] days is a paradox it's a paradox because
[16:54] this is the most evil age there is and
[16:56] we are called to stand
[17:00] tonight I have something up my heart to
[17:02] share with
[17:03] you and I will tell you what I've titled
[17:07] it I've titled it cry out for the
[17:10] seal the
[17:12] mark the oil of
[17:14] God the time must
[17:18] come you know I have been battling a
[17:22] long while fighting the spirit of lari
[17:27] sluggishness message
[17:29] type uh contentment message type
[17:34] entitlement Because deep down in my
[17:36] heart in my mind in my spirit I know it
[17:39] can't
[17:41] work thousands and thousands of
[17:44] Believers have been deceived by their
[17:47] pastors by they being
[17:50] comfortable because of what they believe
[17:54] they are going
[17:55] somewhere and
[17:57] unfortunately it is not not so the truth
[18:01] is it is not so Jesus Christ is coming
[18:06] from his body which is his
[18:09] church the body is not buildings the
[18:12] body is not numbers the body is not
[18:13] followers of this particular Ministry
[18:15] minister or whatever the body is the
[18:18] body of
[18:20] Christ which is he is the head
[18:23] of so Jesus is not a
[18:25] pope Jesus is the head of the body call
[18:29] the church and only by one Spirit not by
[18:34] books not by tis not by joining this
[18:38] group and this group is the bride and
[18:40] not the bride that's a light that from
[18:42] the pit of Hell and I want you to
[18:44] swallow that and I want you to grasp
[18:48] that what are you standing on and what
[18:51] are you standing
[18:53] for I'm not talking about our church our
[18:56] church is just any other Church actually
[18:58] can of Believers there have people with
[18:59] different mindsets and attitudes people
[19:02] who see things this way or that way and
[19:05] it parallels what God identifying the
[19:08] scriptures as people that follow through
[19:11] without mixing what they heard with
[19:13] faith and guess what they
[19:15] perish this beautiful God this lovely
[19:18] God this wonderful Lord that promised
[19:20] deliverance and whatnot with a mighty
[19:22] hand brought them out and then kill them
[19:25] and judg
[19:26] them and I think that um you have been
[19:29] hear me saying for years this message
[19:30] world has not yet seen God's
[19:33] judgment people get old people die they
[19:36] bury them and everything else and say
[19:38] they are Saint and what not like
[19:40] everybody that die goes to heaven that's
[19:41] not true some go to
[19:44] hell man shall not live by bread alone
[19:47] but every word that proceed out of the
[19:49] mouth of God so tonight I want to read
[19:51] three scriptures the scriptures we know
[19:54] scriptures I've read before but
[19:56] somehow I believe it will
[19:59] come across different tonight so the
[20:01] first scripture I want to read is
[20:03] Ezekiel chapter
[20:05] 9 Ezekiel 9 reading from verse one he C
[20:10] also in M ears with a lord voice
[20:12] saying if have your Bible you could find
[20:15] it cause them that have charge over the
[20:18] city to draw near even every man with
[20:22] his destroying weapon in his hand and
[20:25] behold six men came from the ways of the
[20:26] high gate which lie towards the North
[20:28] Every Man a Slaughter weapon in his hand
[20:32] one man among them was clothed with
[20:34] linen with a writers incor by his side
[20:38] and they went in and Stood Beside the
[20:40] brisen
[20:41] Altar and the glory of the god of Israel
[20:44] this is verse three of Ezekiel 9 was
[20:47] gone up from the Cherub whereupon he was
[20:49] to the treasur of the house and he
[20:51] called to the man clothed with linen
[20:55] which had the righteous inor by his
[20:57] side and the Lord said unto him go to
[21:02] the midst of the city to the midst of
[21:05] Jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[21:07] foreheads of the men that sign and that
[21:10] cry for all the Abominations that be
[21:13] done in the midst thereof unto the
[21:16] others he said in my
[21:19] hearing go ye after him through the city
[21:24] and smite let not your eyes spear
[21:28] neither have pity so note this inkhorn
[21:32] writer was sent forth
[21:34] first not the slaughtering
[21:36] Angels not the Judgment Angels but the
[21:40] inor writer we know that is the holy
[21:43] ghost slay
[21:46] utterly watch this old and
[21:49] young so at this point age is
[21:54] irrelevant whether you're
[21:56] old whether you're young
[21:59] no respect of person both mids and
[22:03] little
[22:04] children young
[22:06] women little
[22:08] children and the Bible had and
[22:12] woman so man woman male female little
[22:20] children but come not near any man upon
[22:24] whom is the
[22:25] mark where must it begin
[22:29] and begin at My
[22:31] Sanctuary then they began at the ancient
[22:35] men which were before the
[22:38] house now normally we sto there but
[22:41] we'll read on
[22:42] tonight and he said unto them defile the
[22:47] house and fill the courts with the slain
[22:50] go ye forth and they went forth and slew
[22:54] in the
[22:56] city and it came to pass while while
[22:58] they were slaying them and I was left
[23:03] that I fell upon my face and cried and
[23:05] said ah Lord God will thou destroy all
[23:10] the residue of Israel in thy pouring out
[23:13] of thy Fury upon
[23:16] Jerusalem then said he unto
[23:19] me the
[23:21] iniquity of the House of Israel and
[23:23] Judah is exceeding
[23:26] great and the land is full of blood
[23:29] and the City full of perverseness for
[23:32] they say the Lord had forsaken the
[23:36] earth and the Lord seeth
[23:39] not and as for me also mine eye shall
[23:43] not spear neither will I have pity but I
[23:47] will recompense their way upon their
[23:51] head and behold the man clothed with
[23:55] linen which had the incor by his side
[23:59] reported the matter
[24:00] saying I have
[24:03] done as thou Hast commanded
[24:08] me so this
[24:11] commission to Mark those that sigh and
[24:15] cry was
[24:18] completed this angel with the incor
[24:22] writer was able to announce the
[24:25] commission that you have given to me it
[24:28] is done
[24:29] the rest is up to you he did his job
[24:32] putting a mark not on people in the
[24:36] message not on those who have all the
[24:38] books all the
[24:39] tapes not on those who following the
[24:42] mighty teachers and revelators and
[24:44] mystery teachers and un folders of this
[24:46] word and unfolding who they are and they
[24:48] and all of that drama not that but put a
[24:52] mark upon those that sigh and cry
[24:58] if there isn't a cry in your spirit
[25:00] tonight ask God for
[25:02] it outside a cry in your spirit and
[25:05] heart you are actually walking in debt
[25:10] debt in the Old Testament was debt to be
[25:14] to be to go in that to be outside of his
[25:18] presence now life the only way to
[25:22] survive is to be in his
[25:26] presence and maybe Sunday and see how
[25:29] that goes but K went in a different land
[25:32] and get his
[25:33] wife Kan walked out of presence to get
[25:36] his wife set got his wife I'm in
[25:42] present Jesus will get his wife from in
[25:49] presence not out of presence in presence
[25:53] if what you're doing now affects you
[25:56] being in God's presence stop it
[26:00] if where you go now the presence of God
[26:03] does not approve don't go
[26:05] there if how you live Cuts you off from
[26:09] God's presence stop living that
[26:12] way because you need to come into
[26:15] presence marriage is Honorable the bed
[26:18] is on theile but that doesn't mean you
[26:19] do everything do anything on the
[26:23] bed because God said
[26:25] so God not in perverseness and God not
[26:28] in
[26:29] perversion God is in truth and God is in
[26:32] righteousness the second script I want
[26:34] to read is taking from Luke chapter 8
[26:37] froming the scripture verse one this is
[26:40] Jesus speaking he speak a
[26:42] parable if you want to find it Juke
[26:44] chapter sorry chapter 18 verse one Luke
[26:47] chapter 18 he speak to this end that men
[26:51] ought to pray and not to
[26:53] faint I don't remember if I ever tie
[26:56] these two scriptures together Ezekiel 9
[26:59] and and Luke 18 maybe I did I don't I
[27:01] can't remember and he speak a parto them
[27:04] this end that men
[27:06] always men ought always to
[27:10] pray and not to
[27:12] Fain what is he saying in that
[27:14] his there'll be stuff and there'll be
[27:17] challenges and there'll be problems that
[27:20] will cause us to want to
[27:23] faint but he say men men in the house
[27:26] ought always to pray
[27:28] and this is the parable the story that
[27:31] Jesus give and remember the parables are
[27:33] Mysteries and story form that people
[27:35] will grasp the inner meaning with layers
[27:38] that he put there because Jesus was the
[27:41] greatest Storyteller saying there was in
[27:44] a city a judge who feared not God nether
[27:46] regarded man so this man like a dread
[27:49] began there was a widow in that City and
[27:52] she came unto him saying avenge me of my
[27:54] adversary she had a request and he would
[27:57] not a while so he's ignoring her he's in
[28:00] B with her she's making her request but
[28:02] afterwards he said within himself do I
[28:04] fear not God nor regard man yet why
[28:07] because this Widow troubleth me I will
[28:10] avenge her least by her continually
[28:13] coming she wear me and the Lord said
[28:16] Jesus Jesus speaking you know hear what
[28:18] the unjust judge
[28:20] said shall not God so he's making a
[28:24] point hear what this unjust judge say it
[28:28] shall not God avenge his own
[28:33] elect which cry no and again no which do
[28:37] cry at all no which is on Facebook
[28:41] Twitter Tik Tok and whatever else no
[28:44] which cry day and
[28:46] night day and night unto him do he be
[28:49] along with them I tell you that he will
[28:52] Avent them
[28:53] speedily nevertheless when the son of
[28:56] man cometh shall find faith on the earth
[28:59] so Saints the challenge tonight is not
[29:01] just this prayer meeting or this time of
[29:05] prayer this is a I even a sixth or 10th
[29:08] or fifth 12th this is next to a little a
[29:14] little compar to what God wants of us
[29:18] and what God wants of us is cry day and
[29:21] night say day and night in your house I
[29:24] want you to say day and night he want
[29:26] you to cry day and night this with
[29:28] Pastor Elder Deon this is you and your
[29:31] thirst for God this is you and your
[29:33] hunger for God he wants you to cry unto
[29:36] him for your needs day and night you
[29:38] crying out is an expression of how much
[29:40] you need him how much you desire him
[29:43] this have nothing to do with the pastor
[29:45] I like you say and what kind of word is
[29:48] that no no no have nothing do with that
[29:49] just you crying out day night last
[29:53] scripture the prophet and we wrap this
[29:56] up last scripture want to read from
[29:58] revelation 22 ver 10 to
[30:02] 12 he said unto
[30:07] me see not the scenes of the prophecy of
[30:10] this
[30:11] book for the time is at
[30:15] hand he that is unjust let him be unjust
[30:19] still he which is filthy let him be
[30:22] filthy still he that is righteous let
[30:26] him be righteous still he that is Holy
[30:30] let him be holy still and behold I come
[30:32] quickly and my reward is with me to give
[30:36] every man according to his work shall be
[30:39] note that this
[30:42] is the
[30:43] hour that we are coming to where there's
[30:47] no more need to persuade anyone to be
[30:50] just to be righteous to be holy whatever
[30:54] condition you're
[30:55] caught that remains
[30:58] it will be your choice your choice to be
[31:01] righteous your choice to be holy your
[31:03] choice to be Wicked your choice to be
[31:05] evil your choice to be one of the most
[31:07] miserable Christians that you can be or
[31:09] what you claim to be that's your choice
[31:11] you have heard it over and over people
[31:13] say if the Lord will deliver me from
[31:15] this I'll be a better person Lord Lord
[31:17] deler from that I'll be this no he said
[31:19] up to
[31:21] you you heard me preach about it you are
[31:23] Justified only God could justify
[31:26] glorified only God could do those to
[31:28] the part that you and I is called to do
[31:31] is sanctification is clean up our acts
[31:34] is do what needs to be done it has
[31:36] nothing to do with what the preacher and
[31:38] the preacher and the Elder and the
[31:39] church and the wrong Church better got
[31:41] right church and some CL some CL in some
[31:43] Corner say they have the right
[31:45] Church they have the right teachings
[31:47] they have the right Revelation they have
[31:48] the right this and people go there and
[31:50] they still how to fight up for their own
[31:51] self because you have to deal with
[31:55] you you have to own up to you so the
[31:57] power is upon us and remember the
[32:01] title cry out for the seal the mark the
[32:05] oil of God the time has come I'll close
[32:08] with a
[32:10] brown when Peter started walking out on
[32:13] the water he thought he was getting
[32:14] along all right see how big I'm doing he
[32:16] started sinking he didn't say well I
[32:18] guess it fa on down to the bottom a few
[32:21] bubbles come up no he cried out Lord
[32:24] save me and that Eternal hand reached
[32:27] down
[32:28] and picked him up again why why he cried
[32:32] out is it because you're proud you don't
[32:34] want to cry out you have a chance to not
[32:37] the crow in your own
[32:38] house that's what the matter with the
[32:41] church we don't lay there long enough we
[32:44] don't cry out long enough we don't hold
[32:48] on to it if a little baby want something
[32:50] it will kick and scream turn R in the
[32:52] face we are afraid we will take it what
[32:55] is it you call it the mascara out of
[32:57] your face face whatever it is the paint
[33:00] you get what you want from God you will
[33:03] take it off anyhow so you don't have to
[33:04] worry about it you'll mess up your hair
[33:06] but that don't make a
[33:08] difference now God here we go God don't
[33:12] expect us to come to him with some
[33:15] intellectual speech I remember I triy
[33:18] that I tried to get save I was going to
[33:20] write him a letter put it in the woods
[33:21] because I know he come through the words
[33:23] and tell me and tell him I'm ashamed of
[33:25] myself I didn't want to do it and I got
[33:28] there to pray I said Lord no let's see I
[33:31] seen a picture of him one time they held
[33:33] his hands like this I said Mr Jesus I
[33:35] wish you would come here a minute I want
[33:37] to talk to you to you just a minute I'm
[33:39] listening nobody I said I did it wrong
[33:42] all right Mr Jesus maybe I am supposed
[33:44] to do it this way I said Mr Jesus would
[33:46] you come and help me I'm a sinner I want
[33:48] to talk to you a minute nobody come I
[33:51] fold my arms I said Mr Jesus would you
[33:53] come here I I hear people say God talk
[33:55] to me I said Mr Jesus would you come
[33:57] here I want to speak to you course then
[34:00] the devil come on the scene that's the
[34:02] way he does he might tell you your knees
[34:03] are hurting no need of asking you wait
[34:06] get it tomorrow night he always wrong
[34:08] when you're not when you're not ready
[34:10] then he said to me but always he says
[34:12] take advantage of what he says take
[34:14] advantage of it he said to me you know
[34:16] what you're already 19 years old or 20
[34:19] years old you're already 20 years old
[34:21] you waited too long devil talk I said oh
[34:23] god I've waited too long Lord even you
[34:26] don't hear me I'm going to tell you
[34:27] anyhow I've always wanted to do this oh
[34:30] brother that brought him on the scene
[34:32] what was it I cried out just simple I
[34:36] cried out Lord Jesus you promise it Lord
[34:38] and he come on the scene and that's the
[34:40] way to bring him on the scene you're
[34:42] just a baby cry cry out fit don't try to
[34:46] say well youve something of another some
[34:48] great Ro out prayer you practice for
[34:51] hour or two that don't do any good I
[34:54] said cry out for your needs that is God
[34:57] provided we didn't Jesus explain it when
[35:00] he said the unjust judge to the woman
[35:03] that cried day and night how much more
[35:05] will the heavenly father give them the
[35:09] spirit who cry out for it day and night
[35:12] I think I'll read it again how much more
[35:15] will the heavenly father give them the
[35:17] spirit who cowed for a day and night
[35:20] seek keep seeking knock keep knocking
[35:23] just keep on until he opens stay with it
[35:26] cry until he hear this cry until the
[35:30] promised word is Vindicated then you got
[35:33] it you don't have to worry no more you
[35:35] see the Bible promise it then stay right
[35:38] there and cry until you get it if a baby
[35:41] sees a cookie and he wants it he just
[35:43] cry and cry and cry and stick and kick
[35:46] and scream and holler and turn red in
[35:47] the face his mommy get him a cookie it's
[35:50] all over see he's got what he saw what
[35:52] he wanted he wants to lick off your ice
[35:54] cream cone he will keep raising a f till
[35:57] he gets it well that's the way we are
[35:59] supposed to do it go give the Lord some
[36:00] Praises tonight he said that is the way
[36:03] we supposed to do it if I see a promise
[36:05] in the Bible that God's word and I stay
[36:08] there and cry out till God give it to me
[36:10] and he'll do that get you off his hands
[36:14] you see and that would be in the natural
[36:16] he wanted you to do it he likes for you
[36:18] to ask ask abundantly that your joy
[36:22] might be full here I said it again cry
[36:24] until his word is Vindicated no friends
[36:26] just watch just minute cry until the
[36:30] word is Vindicated the trouble of it is
[36:32] we get the cookie and we think that that
[36:34] is all there is there's a whole table
[36:37] full we get so we can speak in tongues
[36:40] we so brother that's it that ain't
[36:42] that's just some of it I got happy
[36:43] enough to shout but there's more of it
[36:46] there's a whole lot more just keep
[36:48] crying until that is God's provided way
[36:52] for his people God's provided way as
[36:55] always is to take his word and hold onto
[36:58] it until it's made manifest to you and I
[37:01] close with this scripture here two
[37:03] scriptures 1 Peter 4:17 says for the
[37:07] time is come that judgment must begin at
[37:12] the house of God you notice that
[37:16] Ukraine and Russia is almost like if I
[37:21] say tailmate but it's almost like if
[37:23] something hanging there just just hang
[37:25] in there R could bomb The Living
[37:27] Daylights of the Ukraine any but it's
[37:29] something that's slow burning there and
[37:31] now Israel with Iran Israel with Hamas
[37:34] just a slow burning here but before the
[37:37] drama takes off in in in in in Earnest
[37:41] the time is come judgment begins where
[37:46] at the house of God and if it begin
[37:49] first at us what shall the end be of
[37:52] them that obey not the gospel of God
[37:55] last scripture and we
[37:58] Romans 6 verse 10 said for in that he
[38:01] died he died unto sin once but he liveth
[38:04] he liveed unto God verse 11 of Romans 6
[38:07] likewise reckon yourselves to be dead
[38:10] indeed unto sin but alive unto God
[38:12] through Jesus Christ Our Lord verse 12 a
[38:15] order a command let not sin therefore re
[38:19] in your mortal body that you should obey
[38:22] it in the Lost
[38:24] thereof verse 13 neither Yi your members
[38:28] as instruments of unrighteousness Unto
[38:31] sin but yield yourselves unto God as
[38:34] those that are alive from the dead and
[38:36] your members as instruments of
[38:39] righteousness unto God let not sin yield
[38:43] your members let not sin yield your
[38:47] members that's that is orders that is
[38:49] instructions verse 14 for sin shall not
[38:53] have dominion over you for you are not
[38:55] under the law but under grace what then
[38:57] then shall we sin because we are not
[38:59] under the law but under grace God forbid
[39:01] know ye not that to whom you yield
[39:04] yourselves servants to obey his servants
[39:06] he are to whom you obey whether of sin
[39:08] unto debt or obedience unto
[39:10] righteousness and the amplifi that verse
[39:12] 12 says let not sin therefore rule as
[39:14] King in your mortal shortly perishable
[39:16] bodies to make you yield its cravings
[39:19] and be subject to his lust and evil
[39:21] passions do not continue
[39:24] offering or yaling your bodily members
[39:27] and faculties to sin as instruments and
[39:30] tools of wickedness but offer and yield
[39:33] yourselves to God as though you have
[39:35] been raised from the dead to Perpetual
[39:38] life and your bodily members and
[39:39] faculties to God presenting them as
[39:42] Implements of righteousness for sin
[39:45] shall not any longer exit dominion over
[39:48] you let us pray heavenly father I thank
[39:50] you for your word Lord and this is what
[39:52] have stir in my spirit oh God to cry out
[39:56] day and night for the SE
[39:58] for the mark for the oil of God because
[40:01] the time is at hand Lord that incor

[40:06] completed it I've put the mark and
[40:09] what's next judgment oh God help your
[40:12] people here this this evening and may

[40:21] Ghost seal me into the kingdom give me
[40:23] that oil in my lamp to keep it burning

[40:33] the charge the battery recharge and the
