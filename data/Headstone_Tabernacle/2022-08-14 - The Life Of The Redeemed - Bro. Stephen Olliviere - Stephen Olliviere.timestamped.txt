[46:20] amen praise god god bless you amen
[46:24] let me be seated
[46:25] praise god
[46:26] amen
[46:28] praise god so from the message
[46:30] fellowship by redemption brother branham
[46:32] says
[46:35] many times we see that
[46:37] we the mortal beings of this earth
[46:40] how that we become tossed about
[46:43] and strayed around across the world
[46:48] i don't believe there's anybody that's
[46:50] got a christian spirit
[46:52] could look upon the world today
[46:55] that wouldn't groan
[46:57] in their spirit
[47:00] i often wondered how people today take
[47:03] this life so lightly
[47:06] but it's nothing to be taken lightly can
[47:08] we say amen can we say amen
[47:13] the very reason that we put here on
[47:15] earth
[47:16] is to worship god
[47:18] amen
[47:19] to come to god
[47:22] and to come into his fellowship can we
[47:24] say amen
[47:25] hallelujah
[47:28] he says and to see men wandering about
[47:30] around as if
[47:32] they have no god
[47:34] as if there was no god
[47:36] oh my
[47:38] man has driven himself out into that
[47:40] kind of a condition
[47:44] and so i believe that the most essential
[47:47] thing
[47:48] that i could think of any minister
[47:50] speaking of
[47:52] is to get the people back to the general
[47:54] principles of the gospel can we say amen
[47:57] amen coming back to a place coming back
[48:00] to god amen can we say amen
[48:02] praise god
[48:05] and says
[48:06] what is the use of building upon a
[48:08] foundation
[48:09] that's already been condemned
[48:12] what's the use of paint in an old
[48:14] building that the government has already
[48:16] condemned
[48:18] and that's what many people are trying
[48:21] to do today
[48:22] they're trying to reform
[48:24] you see
[48:27] we'll start a church
[48:29] we'll turn a new page
[48:31] we'll try to do a little different from
[48:32] what we used to do before
[48:35] listen he said you will never get
[48:38] anywhere like that
[48:40] you're just wasting your time
[48:42] so we didn't come this morning to turn a
[48:44] new page amen
[48:46] hallelujah
[48:47] i would quit my line and i would quit my
[48:50] stealing
[48:51] all those things are good as they are
[48:54] but you are still a million miles off of
[48:56] that road
[48:57] see
[49:00] so what should i do then
[49:03] he says you've got to start back to the
[49:05] foundation
[49:07] you got to build a new place
[49:10] don't patch up the old one
[49:13] build a brand new one you've got to come
[49:15] back and start right
[49:18] can we say amen
[49:20] hallelujah
[49:21] that's the reason you see so many faulty
[49:23] mystics so many people indifferent
[49:26] people who profess christianity my
[49:31] it sounds hard he says
[49:33] but you are the only bible that many
[49:36] people will ever read
[49:40] your life is the only bible that men and
[49:42] women will ever read
[49:46] just the way you act
[49:48] just the way you do and behave
[49:51] so christians are supposed to be living
[49:53] examples of what christ is can we say
[49:56] amen
[49:58] and if christ is in the human heart
[50:01] then he will certainly live his own life
[50:04] for christ is in you can we say amen
[50:06] hallelujah and if the spirit of christ
[50:08] be in you
[50:09] then you become a new preacher
[50:12] give the lord a hand of praise thank you
[50:14] jesus glory glory glory
[50:17] amen i just wanted to share that before
[50:19] we got started amen
[50:22] so this morning my title is
[50:24] the life of the redeemed
[50:28] and my inspiration is
[50:30] claim your redemptive blessings
[50:34] and my subject is the plan and process
[50:37] of redemption
[50:38] praise the name of the lord
[50:40] amen glory to god amen and this morning
[50:43] you are the redeemed
[50:44] you are part of the redeemed of the
[50:46] bride of christ can we say amen just
[50:48] turn around and tell your brother you
[50:49] are the redeemed
[50:50] you are the redeemed this morning amen
[50:53] glory to god amen redeemed by the blood
[50:56] of the lamb amen
[50:57] give the lord a hand of praise you are
[50:59] the redeemed brother joel glory
[51:02] thank you lord
[51:03] amen amen
[51:06] amen so let's try to get started
[51:09] now to redeem
[51:11] history purchase
[51:13] to buy back something that was lost
[51:17] by the payment of a ransom
[51:20] to regain possession of something in
[51:22] exchange for a payment
[51:24] can we say amen
[51:26] to bring back
[51:28] to make amends for
[51:30] to restore back to an original estate
[51:33] i will restore saith the lord amen amen
[51:36] amen
[51:38] so it means that if we are redeemed
[51:41] then we had to be lost
[51:44] or we had lost possession of something
[51:46] that rightfully belonged to us
[51:49] something some inheritance something of
[51:52] great value amen
[51:53] hallelujah
[51:55] [Applause]
[51:56] why would we need a redeemer
[51:59] if we were in our rightful position
[52:01] come on now amen
[52:03] let's see
[52:05] when god placed adam and eve in the
[52:07] garden after he had made everything
[52:09] genesis 1 31
[52:11] he said it was good
[52:14] he divided the light from the darkness

[1:01:29] from knowing no sin to a perverted
[1:01:32] carnal life of sin

[1:03:59] hand in the battle
[1:04:02] satan take god took god's word and
[1:04:04] twisted it
[1:04:06] and then tried to use god's judgment

[1:04:17] they ate it
[1:04:19] but god cannot break his word they had
[1:04:22] to die

[1:06:30] stripped
[1:06:32] no title deed to his home
[1:06:35] no power no fellowship no super sense of
[1:06:38] faith
[1:06:40] i can see satan and his imps for that
[1:06:42] short moment rejoicing
[1:06:45] it looked as if they were finished as if
[1:06:47] somebody say i said praise god amen
[1:06:50] hallelujah reminds me of when the
[1:06:52] children of israel left egypt

[1:07:10] red sea in front of them
[1:07:12] and all dreadful pharaoh and his army
[1:07:14] behind

[1:07:20] is this where he led you to

[1:08:00] humans
[1:08:02] adam is no longer legally the owner of

[1:08:13] it
[1:08:15] he never paid for the property
[1:08:17] it was never given to him

[1:08:49] it
[1:08:51] so it went back to the original owner
[1:08:53] which is god himself hallelujah
[1:08:58] there he sits on his throne with his
[1:09:00] hand
[1:09:01] the title deed
[1:09:03] the abstract title d to eternal life in
[1:09:07] his hands

[1:12:26] sat on the throne a book
[1:12:30] written within
[1:12:32] and on the back side
[1:12:34] sealed with seven seals
[1:12:37] what book is that
[1:12:40] what book is that
[1:12:43] verse two

[1:12:49] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[1:12:53] what book is this
[1:12:58] this book seems to have something
[1:13:00] extremely important
[1:13:02] and valuable because one
[1:13:05] you have to be worthy to open it
[1:13:08] and two

[1:13:52] he knew it was important he knew it was
[1:13:55] very important

[1:14:03] my
[1:14:06] and said from the breach
[1:14:09] here is what i think john wept for
[1:14:13] john wept because
[1:14:15] if no one was worthy and could open this
[1:14:18] book of redemption
[1:14:21] then the whole creation was lost
[1:14:24] so we know what a book is
[1:14:26] it's a book of redemption
[1:14:30] the prophet answers the two questions
