lord our god his judgments are in all the earth he had remembered his covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand generations which covenant he made with abraham his own under isaac and confirmed the same unto jacob for law and to israel forever found everlasting covenant saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance and when they what and when they were but a few men in number yey very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong he reproved kings for their sake same touched at my anointed and do my prophets no harm moreover he called for a famine upon the land he break the whole stuff of bread he sent a man before them even joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet the hood would fetters he was laid in iron until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried it first thessalonians 5 i believe is 18 sorry yes 518 sorry about that in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you and um another translation said give thanks in all circumstances for this is the will of god in christ jesus for you and last scriptures from luke chapter 17 o glory hallelujah verse 11 to 19. and he came to pass this book but as he went to jerusalem and he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee and so about jesus and he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which took the fire off and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priest and it came to pass as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back i with a loud voice glorified god and fell along on his face at his feet and giving him thanks and he was a samaritan and jesus answering said we're not ten cleansed where are the nine they are not found that they are they are not found that return to give glory to god save this stranger he sends them a rise go thy way thy feet have made the hole may god bless this word you may be seated thanks again for coming out we are blessed and we are privileged and i know you all know how um our brother jason rashford has gone on to be with the lord and we thank god for his life and his testimony and when you look at it now it's five souls that's going on across i'll almost feel like if they go and hide in somewhere i give it another room that we are want to know what's behind here what are they enjoying what they seeing who are they meeting who are they talking with so it's quite something to think about that this is our hope this is our expectation our lives are not just on this earth here we are strangers in this place and god going to keep us and god going to perceive us there's a song like saying in time like these we need a savior be very sure your anchor holes and and hit the solid rock amen oh blessed be the name of the lord so we thank god so this morning i um i have a title giving him thanks that's the title this morning i'm seeing this is like a thanksgiving service thanking god for this year thanking god for the trials the testing thanking god for the tension the stress the distress thanking god for the challenges that we have faced the challenges has yet to come oh glory we thank him we want to praise him this morning we want to give him thanks because the lord is good oh glory to god is mercies enjoyed forever oh glory to god way when they were very few we suffered them no man to do them wrong same touch that my anointed you are god's covenanted people this morning the devil have to get permission to to deal with you and encounter you oh glory to god david said i've been young now i'm old i've never seen the righteous forsaken or a seed-backed bread oh we are covenanted people this morning we are people under promise and we have this opportunity i miss the corner virus i miss people dying i miss people sick i miss people in hospital i miss all gross darkness covering earth another wave another variant i miss all of that we come to give him thanks this morning god has been good to us good to our health good for our family oh god he put food on my table oh god he gave us a bed to sleep on put a shelter wall here yes it has been hard dry sometimes tough sand done things that you can't explain but he's been good oh it's good to serve him all glory to god god worse is still better than the devil's best oh god help me this morning let me say that again god's worst is still better than the devil's best oh you didn't have to wake me up this morning but he woke me up this morning oh glory to god he put a song in my soul i praise upon my lips i have something to praise him about the devil is a liar this is the worship that he wanted and he will not get and he did not get and he cannot get because we know what we worship and we know why we worship and we know who we worship oh glory to god jesus told a woman at a well the hour come on always when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth oh god everything nice in jesus name oh give the lord i shout in the house that's what jason used to say everything nice in jesus name oh glory don't call me to get a revelation to praise him anyhow in the good time praise his name in the past time to do the same when you lost your job when there is no job when this happened and that happened that's the time to praise god oh glory to god glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus you may be seated oh glory to quality of praise and something i will never forget when his aunt says angela said when he lost the baby he fell face down when they cover up the dirt and well hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that is the quality of praise it's not when you get a car and a house and you get this and they get that you praise god for that that is good but you see when things go in negative when things going wrong when you can't explain and god leave you hanging there with questions and so on and you could bust a hallelujah and miss everything else oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah in everything give them praise oh glory to god hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah people always say these people are crazy we're not crazy we don't belong here we are strangers here we belong to another land you could imagine abraham when i meet him and say where you're going he's a no but i'm sick in a city who's you see him who's making deliverance you see it you you see that city oh god where i come from i come from a far country who you're following i follow in jehovah are following the voice that called me oh glory to god in the taste of the voice of the seventh angel course and a star a messenger to call you in this hour you will come yourself this message from you or give the lord a shout you didn't find this message this message from you give the lord a shout give the lord our praise [Applause] glory there's going to be a resurrection all them brothers who die and going on they're dead they're finished they are confirming they're going to be resurrection and when it when the dead and christ rise they shall appear to the saints living saints 30 40 days it must have people who you could recognize you could recognize jason you could recognize mundus they could recognize the brethren there must have been they could recognize that's the scriptures they appeared unto many they telling the raptors at hand with we go in what we preach for what we prolong for what you come to service for here come the warmer bench you'll come to get tuned up ready hallelujah to leave this world you will leave dust in the devil's face you can leave smoke in the devil's face we have a rap to express the catch we have a rapture express to catch don't feel this not important you know let me be seasoned i can't talk more than giving god please don't think these are lightsabers because we talk about praise and thank giving people start stuck in the intellectual rat they kind of worship god and praise god and create an atmosphere i ain't come to know their church you know uncomfortable catholic church i know that's where my catholic was hundreds of years ago was hundreds of years ago i ain't gone for that channel there's a bride and grass the church [Music] who when god opened the books you see your name no other age had the opportunity to see your name no other age the book was open no other is a mighty angel come down with the swept back wings with the seventh seal to reveal every mystery you can't sit and steer like if god has done nothing oh glory to god oh give the lord a shout first thessalonians 4 16 the lord himself the sons of heaven with a shout seven thunders the god right together and give the right faith all them sayings gone on before waiting for our bride to come to perfection oh god we have to thank god for what was what is and what is to come oh glory to god help me jesus oh god i'm feeling good right now oh glory to god what was and what is and what is to come oh hallelujah wherever my wife told him you preach about it but you don't know what it is there's the land of perfect love you have to get on your crap cut off your nonsense and press on to that mark of the high calling in christ jesus we have something to achieve it's not coming to church it's getting the perfection getting to the your place in christ you have to want that you have to desire that okay let's go [Music] [Applause] that's what the church if it's in order set in order it got the mechanics ready it only needs then the dynamics tonight if we will get the mechanics ready now this is the problem we could talk about mechanics word and mysteries like if you have to know everything but you say you do have to know all the mechanics i am as a mechanic i know when you take the key until the car if it had tumbled you had a call for a mechanic to fix that all i want to know is the tumble and put it in d and press drive as long as it breaks and the x working i get in somewhere if i have no gas i have no place to go if i have no tires i have no place to go and have to have that mechanical things are wrong and set in order to go it have man with car and have no engine in it the about the bonnet clothes don't you don't know that if you're running and trying to defeat you have none of the teeth because if they're going nowhere there is no engine when you turn the key you hear nothing because there is no battery there is no engine there so if it's in me for the rapture when that key turned it has had something inside of there and that engine that god have to put inside of you is faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and the love of god and when that key turned inside the deer not devil can hold you down that's the square that hold your body tongue not even sickness could hold your body tongue not even gray hair not even crippled if you're crippled here you're walking across there is your gray hair here you're black here across there oh give the lord a shout oh god have mercy oh glory to god hallelujah [Applause] glory to god you want to test the engine to see the tumbling god want a bunch of engine tumblers oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah and a lot of things go with engine oh hallelujah and then you have the battery and you have the right power battery too the carpet has six volt battery a small battery to power a big engine that can't work the battery lights lights and torch lights and what kind of dim light and whatnot but not that engine so you have to get the right engine you can't get a looter on battery and drop it on this bright message you can't come and get a pentecostal battery and drive on this message he said no other life would work nothing else with work who isn't wanting after work is the dynamics to the mechanics you can't bring some some so-called prophet an apostle and so call man of the hour and answer this car because no man can make a revival god put it in the word to let you know no man can bring it so i don't care if the congregation believed that is the man that is the only man and one man and look at the nonsense it can't work because the prophet said it can't work oh glory to call it will take the people and that's talking about you you have got to see something something bigger than you something more powerful than you somehow make you extend yourself to press on in god and act upon his word to shake off the flesh to shake off yourself oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah tonight so he's not talking about mysteries here now listen to how the prophet bring the balance and bring it now with us see mysteries word you're hearing and so on here this if we get the mechanics ready get our hearts right you mean guys mechanics too yes get in your heart right the things that we can do you see that there are certain things only you can do the past i can't do it for you not even your husband could do it for you your wife can't do it for you it is things that you have to do you could renounce evil you could renounce hypocrisy you could reject hatred and jealousy you could be not i say lord i i dismiss that i i have no ought against anybody i drop it you could you could you could do something about that god can't come now and clean your land if you're lazy i want to trust you chelsea like it's some farm i'll try and see they'll lose everything because just waiting watching through and the bush could catch it and something like that you have to clean land then put seed on hallelujah and then water the sea too god have a law that lawyer changes from nobody and he put the word as a seed and if you are bushing your heart and corruption in your heart how that sees it in the ground so god have to get them rocks out your system that's what they get the church for for the world to lock you for the road to grab you and dig out things out of your life glory to god and that seeker drop down in your soul and the water of your tears and thanksgiving could water the promises in your spirit in your heart in your mind your soul so as you grow in god and in the knowledge of god you're also going thanksgiving oh glory to god and praise abraham staggered not at the promise of god you won't believe but was strong ill faith given glory to god abraham thank god and you don't thank god when you have it you're tangled before you have it he had a praise before he met isaac he was glory and god before god confirmed the word before god vindicated the promise to abraham he was given god to worship you unto him all them brothers bring altar oh abraham bella alter jacob all of them bring our altar and give god worship and praise now i know you love me no i know you're worshipping me now i know you're blessing me oh in blessing i will bless the iron multiplying and multiply thy seed and thy seed shall possess the kids of the enemy or kill the lord i shout god tell the prophet because that was chosen you have walked in your own chosen you have picked a precise and correct decision it is my way this in itself is what will make and come to pass his decision is bringing tremendous victory we have victory today when cross darkness covered here what a 1922 what a 2022 we going into victorious here hallelujah they say no you say no no victory victory devil could never have japan it's two years right in this thing we don't know how long it would be it doesn't matter if it's ten years we will still ride it out we hope glory to god hallelujah praise god there are gonna be those who are alive and remain you have got to believe you are one of them thanksgiving is fate to give god thanks his fate oh glory to god you're tanking him in advance you're thanking him right now you're thanking him what gonna come oh glory to god you have to trust the lord you can't be anxious you can't be worried you can't be if this happened and that happened stop that stop it stop it give the lord praise this morning worrying can i help you for nothing worry god give you a job great come on and look for a job oh glory to god worrying cast save your soul let christ save your soul worrying can't deliver your family but faith in god and your prayer going up to god could do something mighty for your way watch son for your wayward daughter for your wayward family [Applause] get our hearts right the things that we can do follow every word follow him baptism follow him in every order that he told us to do get every mechanic ready he identified these things as a mechanic so these are not really passed any change and that's which thee and them up there and them who them me i am them don't get fight with me you know is it worth preaching so let me just slip out easy easy easy and hear you the word of the lord if i preach in my thoughts and dreams there's a different thing you can see you hear what brother do you say he dreamed last night i ain't dreaming nothing last night i sleep strong last night i come here giving you word not dream i come in here with your word man channeling my bread alone but by every word i dream about your faults go and dream again that's not the word god they gave me that dream there was give people a dream to you know and hold on to the dream they see this and they see that and they got my word to see gotta go like what god say no vision you don't need a vision you need the word and then go go drop down your heart let's read it here follow him in every order that he told us to do get every mechanic ready and stand here then we are ready for the dynamics to be lit off and only god can do that and that is to drop into your heart that faith that says i am now healed only god can do that so i realize now that when people don't do all that they're supposed to do they just wouldn't have the confidence in god let me see that again when you know there are still things outstanding to do you cannot have the conf you could go and pray you know but you're short they come like people who don't want to ask god about a certain issue because they don't want god to tell them no so they're praying about a b and c but what they want to manage is d so after c they jump over d and go into d e because they don't want god to talk to them about d at all say because d is where the issue is at and they want their own way with d because deep down they know god's going to tell them that's why they're talking about that they feel it they sense it so they don't want to bring it to the altar and leave it there but if god said no is that the best note here you should shout at that no you know because god protected you with a a massive no god not afraid to say no you know god protecting you you know oh glory to god hallelujah you know what god tells joshua every place you put your foot is yours that's a yes yes yes every place you put your foot so you as a believer standing still is i don't know because you're not moving you have to act upon what you're hearing and tend to become effective i've seen people you talk to them as like as water and duck back it's sliding off you almost gave a pipe to the ears going right through it you're hitting the gray matter you're just going from air to air out what we're going on you're getting a word to act in your home and your family you're getting tight backward and you're just watching you watching and you'll be there i just watch it from the time i thought i talked to our wife she said she she just yeah watching she watch until thing just fall off the wheels full of the courage stop watching start to do start to apply start to show god some faith that was all these brothers show abram for 25 years you think abraham wasn't tired do you think everybody wasn't weary you think i'm living that stress but he stuck another problem he let me think about it thank you love isaac thank you thank you for isaac thank you for my son he's coming he come and he come and he coming he really doctored him out at first the doctor thought he was encouraging him and gave me my tablet and didn't do it when doctor said after 10 years abraham come up with the doctor and say doctor he coming you know obviously you had to be crazy you see we're going to your wife is oceans he said what god said so and he leave any testimony with the doctor sometime you're a little god and he'll leave and say doctor god said so hallelujah doctor pick up a cut from abraham god said so god

of fire hanging right there oh glory to god with god or danger for purpose nothing nothing going to change the purpose of god that god raised you up for your life is for a purpose the devil can't take your before time oh give the lord give the lord a shout no kaya punks in you nothing are hitting you on conquering you oh calls that a god program he said bomb trees that you cannot cross and he said bounce you that the devil himself can't cross when god tells satan do whatever you want but yet touch his life do whatever you want but you cannot crush that life give the lord pray if you never thank god oh glory to god if you never give god praise before giving praise right now [Applause] glory glory glory to god god put a mark on job's life he said do whatever you want because the devil have a right to take life because he's angel of debt well he's mr debt himself and he knows that he have a right to inflict sickness but we have a right to cast them out come on now bring back to me somebody

moment in our twinkling of an eye we'll give the lord our shout this is the age we're living in there's a time we're living in this is what we come to church for [Applause] do all that you can do for the branham when you have done all that you can do when you come to the prayer line and being prayed for your heart doesn't condemn you and you are living right with god just hold on to it god has to answer he is testing you if you turn loose the next morning and say well i'm no better i guess there's nothing to it then you didn't have feet to begin with but if they got real fate you will hold till the last breath is gone from your body you'll be certain that god is god for he that committed god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him oh god god not inviting you to be half sure the bible said the word said he that committed god here with all you have to believe it must believe that he is a rewarder i ain't coming to god to get nothing i come into god to get something he is a rewarder of them that diligently energetically persistently or tearingly seek after him my shoulders after dear after the living god oh glory to god nothing will withhold from them that love him them that serve him david said do i walk through the valley of the shadow of i shall fear no evil for the what with me thy brother my staff they comfort me don't be paris a table for me in the presence of my enemies my cup run it over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life when i walk in and look back i see in goodness and mercy and i can't praise god this morning and i can't thank god this morning god kept you alive you didn't have to make it to this age right now younger people and you get conquered and take note but you are here oh give the lord a shout give the lord a praise [Applause] surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life hallelujah hallelujah given hymn tongues second timothy three from in the scripture this no in the last days perilous time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves coverages boosters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful and unholy so this untangled behavior is prophesied now we're not talking about pan lovers and fat lovers we're talking about church folks you see women's other readers we think we talk with people outside but this is not people outside this is what i call church folks people impuse people walling god bless you and they are covetous boosters proud blasphemers disobedient appearance untangled unholy without natural affections in church choice breakers in church false accusers in church nailing the incontinent in church fierce people in church despises of those who are good and they're in church traitor's heady high minded love of the pleasures man and lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power there are from such anointing that word unthankful is also ungrateful and that ungrateful is not feeling of showing gratitude and part of that problem is when people feel entitled they feel they deserve it so they don't say thank you for it give me like i said hey god does that give me god give me everything let me go to the world give me where you are for me this morning give me but when you come to thank god jesus expresses in the our father prayer our father who art in heaven he asked him here you then identify who the father is where he is hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come die will be done you accept nothing yet you're worshipping on earth as it's in heaven hallelujah you're acknowledging his purpose his will his plan then you say give us this deal our daily bread oh glory to god hallelujah praise god give the lord our praise [Music] they asked jesus how to pray and he taught them come with thanksgiving first comment praises first don't come with give me give me give me give me a minute come and praise him come and worship him come out knowledge who he is he is god who have kept you and preserve you oh god he kept you all these years things must be bad but it could have been worse oh glory to god things might be bad but it could have been worse he kept you and you have to acknowledge it oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god ungrateful not pleasant or acceptable not given due return or recompense for the benefits conferred very distasteful so that person's behavior was distasteful ungrateful oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah thank you jesus oh give the lord some praises [Applause] but there are things that can affect you from being thankful one of them is being proud or arrogant nobody could tell you anything that's how you see people put an argument you tell them something don't even correct them because in their mind they think they are right and they think they really know they seek no counsel they seek no advice they seek no leadership they lead themselves because they feel like being a man or being their own woman when they try to tell them because many times what you think and what god thinks is two different level of thoughts he said my thoughts are not your thoughts and my ways are not your ways so sometimes think i'm contrary to your thinking so why but over singing that and do every single training words for you if i had to talk to you i'll tell you i'm talking to you one on one because i do like to miss i'd like to throw like you want to take somebody somewhere you're chewing and every and people docking anything like that i i don't do that if i have to tell you something after service i'll call you aside and tell it to your face i have a gift to tell people direct i don't want to talk behind you but anybody's back and i i don't usually pull peter words never did that i can't start doing that now too late whatever we speak here is the word for us not what i said not for you you know for us and that includes me give the lord a shout let me say it good it's a word for us and that includes me because i am not above that the word is god oh give the lord a shout out this is what affects people from being thankful being discontented hallelujah jealous because you can't be thankful for what you have because i am what brother i have since they have and a body in your eye so when you when you're going to god you say god give me say why she had and you don't see what you have in them so you're blind to what you have and your eye when you're looking to see you know my dog will be born you look over a river and you see a dog with a bigger bone and to go for that big bone he opened his mouth and lost the bone at the end so if you get rid of jealousy you're troubling you can't come thankfully now because you have issues in your heart what hinders thankfulness is holding on to anger and bitterness you could hold it down you know and have some people every year they renew it you know like how you renew your passport and it renews your driver's permit they renew your business at the end of the year they still compete you know they hate that brother for five years on the next check coming in here coming back again get my renewal devil call god given that you know that renewal doesn't go from going on the devils get stumped bring you next next and sharpen it because you see no faith based upon forgiveness so if he could lock you in that anger and jealousy and hatred and holy naught you're screwed you're totally messed up you know you can't have faith to break into the heavenlies because look where brotherly kindness is and look where the holy spirit is just above brotherly kindness is holy spirit so god in his wisdom put the holy spirit right unto brotherly kindness to see how we will deal with each other oh get the lord i shall feel good this morning thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord oh glory to god what you're saying preacher i'm not saying but you're malta and thank you i'm talking what you get in the spirit of gratefulness the spirit of thankfulness oh god god god have mercy glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you are alive this morning that's enough to turn god hallelujah you're not in the hospital but you're that is not the tank god oh glory to god hallelujah you're one of the escape ones glory the god you escape the beast you escape his name you escape his number you escape his agent you escape his ministers you escape his false prophets you escape them liars them force prophesiers or kill the lord i shout in the house it's good to be in his presence so what kind of services is this model [Music] it's clear as we get closer to the lord our lives have to become like almost crystal clear like a glass no hidden agendas no falsity no funny objective or anything that would in other words becoming clearer and clearer for the flow of the spirit you see if a pipe have clogged things in it and you open it you're dripping the other choke and shake and sometimes have rust in it and when they get it rust out and water the water flowing freely a blockage for the spirit to flow that's what sin does and that's what unbelief does it affect the flow of the spirit god wants to come down but we come down you say god fill me you know god catholic he will not be fit for god to fill you if you know you're the glass duty you gotta get washed you gotta start with wash me first cleanse me first oh glory to god oh give the lord some praises then your faith could rise and say fill me after you're washed you don't drink from a dirty class you have a human being i want to do it you got to drink from yesterday and wash that glass i've seen dirt in it and look and i've seen it big and bold are you not drinking that water you'll kill me you know what in that water look at the water looking so go and wash the glass and then when you wash the glass then they could pour water inside of that glass so god want to pour water inside of you is that that god stingy is that other god mean and he holding back and he don't want to release his power you're looking the character is bit yeah it's no how much men rise up and fall men stumble men get puffed up men get arrogant don't mend me on the pulpit men crazy and play in god and god say he playing me he don't know who i am and got to modify him all let me play this god god say i'll make sure you will know he is not a god when i finish with you so you know you flesh and blood so all them people who think it's god i will show you who's the boss oh glory to god this is not easy you know this is just the word of god do you remember the nebuchadnezzar isn't this what i have built and i have done it feeling like a big shot god says seven years go and eat some grass and grow your hair long and go in years alone after seven years he come back thank you lord thank you lord for your goodness thank you lafayette grace seven years oh don't get 10 years old that's a sentencing you know oh for your pride in aragon seven years nails going long until it recognizes not you is god give you power to live god give your power to be where you are god capture his love and grace extend towards you oh give him thanks this morning let's go a little more again i'll be rapping motive and objective let's go you're talking about god doesn't use his power and his gifts for foolishness it's going to be whatever president will be president to no no which would be the president wouldn't help us one penny it wouldn't do us one bitter good to know who is going to be the president so therefore god doesn't do things like that then if i made a prediction as that and it come to pass and the newspaper packed it and the magazine would be to my glory people would say look at a great prophet brother branham is he told us long before it happened and who would be president no that would be to my glory but god doesn't want that he is not interested in working things to my glory could we say amen that amen is too light you have to sing a bigger amen than that because god is not interested in glorifying no man behind the pulpit or out of the pulpit all the things must be given glory to god all our lives must give glory to god he could by the breath of his nostrils he could blow you out tonight this morning today or give the lord a shout when the red sea was in front of them god just take a blow and made a highway without all the backhoe with all of the amen all the chucks put in bitten pears and pills and whatnot he make a way for them with a perfect highway no because the chariots come riding on a smooth highway highway not a truck a highway for two million people to cross over that's why when they cross over they dance they shout but they beat the tambourine and give god thanks and praise because she knew that the god made a way when there was no way oh give the lord a shout and you are here this morning because god made a way for you to be here this morning many others would have liked to be here but god made i would give the lord some praise and you who connected god made a way for you to be connected oh tell the lord i shout god made that way [Music] when he uses his gifts he uses them for his glory and for the glory of his people oh i love that that's why the fifo ministry for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry is for his glory and the glory of his people that might go straight on moses it'd always be about god's people he said if my people that is called by my name shall humble themselves and turn from their wicked ways then they're gonna hear from heaven gonna heal their land always about abolished people that is why when the people come and give praises is something else to god my people my people called my people he said my people are wicked my people are culturous my people evil my people test my people that but when these people turn around he said my people oh god kind of cut a suckling child and i can't forget them they engrave in the palms of my hands oh he came on to his own who and his own receive him not but as many as receive him to them give you power to become the sons of god god was long in to have restored sons born sons filled sons come back in the last days and william marion branham was the first example of the kind of sons that god have in the last days there are gonna be others they're gonna come to the same maturity there's gonna be others they're gonna come to the same adoption there's gonna be others they're gonna come to the same vision and purpose so glory to god hallelujah thank you jesus what about him he said he uses them for his own glory and for the glorious people for the glory of his church hallelujah for the define of the body of christ and for the glory of the kingdom of god that is why he give these things in his church why as teachers and prophets are evangelists and pastors it's not about them it's about you oh give the lord a shout about that they are for the edification of the church and for the glory of god the prophet is not to get out and mingle with the world and try to take a gift like balaam did and havoc out of money out of it or something if he's a prophet he's supposed to reveal god to the church and to stay out of the things of the world all for the glory of god hallelujah glory to god amen hallelujah we should never judge a man by what denomination belonged to we should always judge him by the spirit he has by the spirit he has not what church he gone to sometimes he church cuckoo somebody cuckoo but the believers that cuckoo because courts people under those men and congo deliver them one by one the elect is staying and sitting on a cuckoo minister on a no man that air called to do what he's doing the elect gonna be called out oh give the lord i shout not one of the elect god be manhandled i am convinced of that the catholic church could hold me when i hear the voice of god i fly right out oh glory to god fatherly oakland remember hallelujah praise god forget your name father leo when i tell the father god say i restarted really bible god god said call my father who was able to call the father he gave me one clock behind my head i skipped down the aisles oh i can forget father leo i was an acolyte immigration i get one clout why the last time you see me of course hallelujah fatherly dead and gone god said call no man father and father father liu hallelujah oh glory to god amen see watch we should always judge him by the spirit he has whether he's lattering for marine inner altering so he's not talking about doctrine because some people only pirated what are they hearing by the pulpit said these people say star star star the only common molestato like long time i never preached no comment no y2k no comment no nothing i am not a stargazer sorry the people expert semesters i am not one of them god gave me the gift of stars i'm not a star gazer all i know is what god's saying in permission so i'm not in philosophy i'm all kind of vein hydrating i have no faith in it i'm nothing to that so he said now watch he said we should never judge a man by you know she belongs to we should always judge him by the spirit he has whether his later information entering altering knowing whatever it might be we should never judge him by that but by his spirit because a man can be talking foolishness but his spirit is right and because his spirit is right he could be led to the right thing when a man spirit wrong forget it you could pelt eggs he could tell whatever truth behind him he's still wrong because spirit wrong said get your heart right oh give the lord some praises so that's why the prophet said i prefer your right in your spirit and wrong in your doctrine than to be wrong in your spirit and right in your doctrine if you're doctrine right in the spirit wrong you're well wrong because you are leveled you're measured by the spirit that you're having give the lord some praises hallelujah praise god there's so much in the day we live in pertaining to gifts almost done so many people judge people by gifts that they have well i believe that these are gifts i believe that what we see take place is gifts and they are god giving gifts but we if we do not use them in the right way listen god giving gifts not being used in the right way if we don't use them in the right way that god intended them to be used then we can do more harm with the gifts than we could if we did not have those gifts the other night i made a statement on the pulpit i would rather see broadly love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of healing or anything else oh give the lord a big one why would he say that then why would he say that then oh glory to god because when we have gifts we have confusion when we have guests it could be misunderstood but you can't misunderstand broadly love oh glory to god hallelujah praise god jesus gave a power who is my neighbor one day hallelujah man was beaten up at the side of the road and here come a priest here come a prophet here come some evangelists here come all of them are the leading man right there but here come a samaritan oh give the lord a shout and he took him and take him into the inn and pay for the inn and help him and do this for him who is your neighbor okay the lord i shout the priest pass him the bishop passed him all them whoever who could have helped couldn't didn't help a samaritan he not only covenanted that crown but they were samaritan watch now if a man comes almost done and he has a great gift no matter if he belongs to our denomination don't judge him by what no machine comes from how he dresses but you want to see what he is trying to do with that gift what purpose he has if he's trying to take his influence and build himself a great name out of it i have this illness of spirit to know that's wrong no matter how great a teacher he is the man real good he could teach who teacher extraordinaire but watch no matter how powerful he is how intellectual he is how his gift operates if he isn't trying to achieve something for the benefit of the body of christ your own spiritual assailant will tell you that's wrong listen to this bomb no matter how accurate how perfect how it is it is wrong if it isn't used for the body of jesus christ to achieve something maybe he got a great gift he could draw people together with a great intellectual spiritual power musician god please and he could draw people together maybe he's trying to take a gift and make himself famous so you have a big name so other bridges will look up to him as some big person oh my wow wow did you hear it you hear how that come you hear how that unfold and everybody look up to him we know by the same man that is wrong all right let's come get it not one time you are not deserting the man you're resilient in the spirit right life that's in the man and that's what god told us to do not one time was we ever commissioned to deserve a man's group but we were constrained and commanded by god to resend the spirit in the man while he's trying to do what spirit in his life trying to lead him and then if we can find out what he's trying to lead the people not to break them up but to bring them together to bring the church of the living god not all to one denomination but to an understanding of fellowship a unity of spirit then if he is for marine laterine whatever it is if his spirit and purpose is right and the spirit that's in him no matter what it belongs to the spirit is in him trying to point the people to calvary away from himself away from anything else but his only achievement is to point them to calvary he doesn't care whether he's known or not he doesn't care whether his own movement which is fine it's good if he's a methodist or presbyterian or common catholic whatever he is but what he's trying to do the purpose of his heart what he's trying to do get then you can see what is this man life you can see his motives oh glory to god hallelujah oh my hallelujah he said every man ought to have a church home you ought to have a place not to float around from a pilot to post but you yourself have to go to a church you call it your church somewhere where you pay your tights somewhere you can help support the cause take a choice and then don't never disfellowship the other man because you don't belong to your group discern his spirit if he's got the same purpose in heart then you've got to fellowship one with another oh glory to god hallelujah praise god what a comfort this morning doesn't everything we could give god thanks oh glory to god in everything we could give god thanks oh glory to god be thanking him for his goodness we thanking him for his grace oh glory to god psalms 34 says hallelujah i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make a boast in the lord the humble shall hear it and be glad o magnify the lord with me let us exalt his name together i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto me and will lighten their faces without a shame this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of his troubles oh give the lord some praises the angel of the lord encountered among them that fear him and delivered them all taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusted in him oh glory to god oh fear the lord he is saints for there is no one to them that fear him the young lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the lord shall not brought any good thing come he children hearken unto me i will teach you the fear of the lord what man is he the desire at life and love at many days that he may see god keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips i'm speaking guile depart from evil and do good seek peace and pursue it the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open until they cry oh glory to god i'm almost finished here glory to god it is quite possible to live a life without giving thanks you can live your life and get everything you want to get and you give one praise to god it doesn't glorify god but the thing about giving god thanks is to know he doesn't change and you know something i keep seeing brother branham under this ailment he was telling somebody if god could tell you your past then god could tell you your future oh i just love that this morning the same god that could say your name is so-and-so your house number is so and so and you did so last year and last night that god and all your past he could talk about your future also your future isn't caught the coroner virus does not determine your future but give you a lot of shout this pandemic don't determine the future of this church this pandemic don't determine your future oh glory to god your future is in god-given praise [Applause] maybe see that things in life can change any moment any moment you could get bad news horrible news but god doesn't change and he promised according to romans 8 28 to know that all things but a jewel going to work together for good to them that love god see them already called according to his purpose so we trust him amidst dark skies we trust him when it is raining we trust him still when the sun is shining the sunshine is not god's approval not that that sky god's disapproval his approval is in the beloved or give the lord a praise offering oh hallelujah glory to god not for some things but in all things hallelujah hallelujah glory to god there are people who have lots of things and they're not thankful they have car house family and they're not thankful they're not grateful they're beating the chest they are boosting hallelujah praise god and we have to learn to give thanks in all circumstances and if you're struggling just remember brother jason as he fell his child being buried and he could fell straight in the grave and say hallelujah hallelujah not why how come why me why not somebody else this quality of praise amidst stress and circumstance is the greatest quality that could go up and ascend to heaven oh glory to god that's the quality of praise you see when those two hebrew boys said our god they will deliver us yes that's good our god believers and we were not going to bow down when god hear that brahman said the angel of water want to come and drop the water and hold the fire different angels asking permission to go down god said no no no no no no this this kind of worship this kind of acknowledgement it's too much i have to come down myself and when they put them in the fire they still have backing we are not going to bow down we are not going to bow down everybody in the testimony we still not bowing down he might say he did seven times hotter because he did 70 times we still know when dog oh god all that is the jam the faith you know why attend the man says sometimes come on man one fire is good enough but to terrorize them to try to upset them to try to make them pack up and pack up themselves himself come down the fault man in the fire hey hey go glory to god and i don't care what fire around you this morning the fourth man will come down oh glory to god a spirit of thanksgiving oh my i'm gonna close let's be seated by the brown it's fine that god has so fixed this earth that we all can be happy if we could just try to be that way live happily and be thankful to him for what we have i am quite sure that one of the great faults with us is that we are not grateful enough for what we have he has been so good to us to give us so many good things and we don't seem to appreciate it as much as we should and i'm gonna close with the scriptory red and where i get the text from these lepers cried unto jesus they wasn't baptized believers there wasn't fellowshippers another spoken book under the arm they were just lepers and these lepers in those days i think you should put a bell around them because when you're hearing leopards is to run because i had no cure for it and it's highly contagious there's a valley called the valley of lepers so lepers know to stay off and stay far so the men already come they said jesus lay hands upon me jesus said let me touch them he said come virgin hallelujah no jesus in a fanatic jesus said crazy jesus said go and show yourself to the priest just a word for to obey they went in obedience and on their way on their way on their way following instructions they recognized they were healed and one came back that one was me oh glory to god one came back one came back and began to thank him and jesus said and god said wouldn't there the other nine where the other nine i know all were here he saw vision he knew all of them was gonna be healed but one came back one came back because i wanna have faith he said i faith had made you whole the others walk and get their blessing but that man had something in his soul he came back to give glory he came back to give honor he

amen you may be seated have a few announcements and a few things a few comments that we want to make today as well and just before i do that is one more note of praise from the lamar ellen edwards family i just sort of pray see it as the year is almost over they want to thank god for keeping them safe um two of the sons uh they would have been on the 1st and the 15th of december so they are thanking god for that and um uh the mom wants to say that she loves them and praying for them as they're coming to the end of this say and have exams next year that god would be with them and uh also a son in uh in this trying time and praying that satan has been trying to destroy them but they consider jesus in control so they want to give all the praise and testify thanking god every day i'm not giving up because jesus is in control so i really think it's a tremendous and it fits in perfectly with a message today of of giving thanks so we want to certainly do that today so on behalf of brother ovid and the ministry uh we want to take this time and i want to take the words from a message brother branham preach and says we would see jesus december the 24th 1961 he said god bless you not exactly a merry christmas but god's blessings of christmas be upon you and may the christ of calvary hide you in himself blanket you so wrap you and enshroud you in his word till his word will be made flesh in you is my prayer and that is our prayer during this week as we approach uh not just this time of holidays but also this great glorious convention that we are under great expectation uh for and before i speak more about that um we certainly want to extend a great thanks to the church today will be the last official sunday service um in this way for 2021 and we really want to take this time to thank the believers for their support during this year thank the church this year has been a year of maneuvering from being able to gather to being on lockdown to being able to navigate through the different zoom services bible studies testimony services live streaming having a few people able to come out having a number of people able to come out and and and but through it all we thank god and we really want to salute the church for standing and maintaining a testimony in such a time as this for those who have been also faithful with the connections both local and foreign as well we certainly love you and appreciate you it is difficult to go through many different names but we really want to give special thanks and i want to start um with the technical team in particular you appreciate the technical team and they are not um all able to be here today as well but uh in particular in this time when we have been forced to switch to many virtual services um god has been faithful and our technical team has also been faithful so we want to salute the brothers and the team uh of the technicians um we will we will go into naming them all when we get back um but i certainly want to wish god's richest blessing upon them and upon the musicians as well and um in a mighty way many times and having had to come and minister here when nobody was in the building um you know it's just sometimes five ten people allowed to gather and god would have blessed just a handful of people to come to prepare the service to stream out and it takes great effort you have to walk with the fire because everybody else is at home so we really want to appreciate them i really want to salute my friend and brother brother anthony o'brien in a special way how many are appreciated by the anthony you know i was saying to brad over yesterday but anthony is really special whether it's bible study and brotherhood is doing it whether i'm doing it whether it's a prayer meeting no matter who is doing it the one constant that you could see is brother anthony they're singing in the spirit and i have the privilege of also working with brother anthony so i know it's not always he has all the energy but his he is faithful and god is faithful so but anthony may god bless you richly may god crown you may he fill and refill and refill you with the baptism of the holy ghost and fire me touch your wife and your children in a special way and continue to use you mightily for the kingdom of god i believe god has a special place in his kingdom for the kind of service you know that god has uh strengthened him to be able to do and certainly we want to also thank all of the elders and the deacons and the ushers and the trustees all of the helps and governments the sunday school all of the maintenance teams who have had to do double duty and step up in light of the pandemic and all of the various teams and departments that have really come together those responsible for overseeing the sanitization and and taking all the records for contact tracing and all the technology behind that um it has been a trying year but god has given us grace to stand and by the grace of god as beloved said if the god who knows your past who also knows your future nothing else determines your future but god that's the power of predestination your destination has been preset pre-determined pre-planned and if there's a purpose for your life then nothing can stop that purpose so we thank god that the purpose of god will always stand and if you are here today is because god is not finished with you yet and we are only just getting started because i can guarantee you the situations around us are designed to lift jesus higher when cross darkness is upon the earth and cross darkness upon the people that's when we could arise and shine for our light not not our personal life but that light his light shining through us in such a time as this so we thank god in a special way you know so we really want to thank all the believers and the church like i said it will be remiss of me it's difficult to kind of capture all the names today but from the bottom of our hearts we thank you for your love for your support and we encourage you especially during this time to pray for one another it has not been easy and we have not been able to see everyone in the way that we are used to but we could certainly it it it it doesn't take too much to remember somebody in prayer so when you go along on your knees say lord bless brother so and so blessed sister so and so just just let us keep that love you know and that quote but override today that where brother branham was saying i rather have brotherly love in the church i rather have that in the church and any other kind of gift this is this is what makes us really stand because we know only only perfect love could really take us over there can the church say amen amen so just a a few more announcements just to kind of set the tone so once again we pray have a blessed holiday season and we want to also announce briefly that the sunday school teachers are inviting only sunday school children and associated parents to join them downstairs their special token for the sunday school children so don't miss out on that as well and um at this time by the ian paul are we are we ready with that we want to just address uh the end of year program but i want to see if we could get this trailer uh shared for the church uh for the upcoming convention so whenever you're ready we could play it and stream it out to the church [Music] [Music] [Music] then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh [Music] oh it's going to be a wonderful day some more some of these times to show you if the resurrection is going to be universal there will be two in a field and i'll take one and two in the bed and i'll take one see it'll be the night one place and daylight on the other side of the earth be a universal resurrection that rapture the trumpet of god you'll sound and every one of these of this little church here here here and even that little bunch that went through there come out here here here when that virgin that virgin when she seen in the seventh watch that i remember there were seven virgins is that ryan i mean five virgins one out ten virgins went out to meet the lord five was wise and five was foolish is that right and now in the watchable there were seven watches and at the end of the seventh watch some sex with this watch this one this one this was at the seventh watch there was a voice went out behold the bridegroom cometh throw you out to meet him and they rolled and trimmed their legs and all these others down to here oh won't that be a wonderful honor [Music] [Music]
