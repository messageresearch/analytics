[13:40] for us pray for the ministry love to see
[13:43] what the Lord will do tonight so tonight
[13:45] I have something up my heart I to share
[13:49] with you and I call it prayer
[13:52] connections and if you have your Bibles
[13:54] I like to turn to 1 John chapter 1 we
[13:57] want to read 5 to 10
[13:59] then we want to go first John chapter 2
[14:01] and read a portion down there and then
[14:04] we leave a portion in J and the grace of
[14:08] God J 42 so we want to go to First John
[14:12] 1 and we want to read from verse five
[14:16] this then is the message which we have
[14:19] heard of him and declare unto you that
[14:22] God is light and in him is no Darkness
[14:26] at all if we see that we have fellowship
[14:29] with him and walk in darkness we lie and
[14:33] do not the truth but if we walk in the
[14:38] light as he is in the light we have
[14:42] Fellowship one with another and the
[14:45] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleans us
[14:47] from our sin now let's reverse that it
[14:49] said if we walk in the light as he's in
[14:51] the light we have Fellowship one with
[14:54] another so if we not having Fellowship
[14:57] that mean somebody body is not walking
[14:59] in the light some kind of darkness is
[15:02] there now listen to this
[15:05] part verse seven again if we walk in the
[15:08] light so I'm in the light you are in the
[15:10] light we walk in the light as he is in
[15:13] the light we have Fellowship one with
[15:16] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[15:19] his son cleanses us us not just me alone
[15:23] us from all sin now if we see we have no
[15:27] sin so you saying that but have sin or
[15:31] you this one have sin that one sin you
[15:33] don't if we say we have no sin we
[15:36] deceive ourselves and the truth is not
[15:39] in us but if we confess our sins he is
[15:43] faithful and just to forgive us of our
[15:45] sins and to cleanse us from all
[15:48] unrighteousness if we say we have not
[15:50] sinned we make him a liar and his word
[15:54] is not in
[15:55] us let's go to St John the first second
[15:58] chapter
[15:59] read from verse three hereby first John
[16:02] 2 hereby we know that we know him how we
[16:07] know him if we keep his commandment
[16:09] verse four he that sayth I know him and
[16:12] keep not his commandment is a liar and
[16:15] the truth is not in him now John is
[16:18] talking to Believers he's not talking to
[16:19] unbelievers he's talking to church folks
[16:21] okay verse five but whosoever keepeth
[16:24] his word in him verily is the love of
[16:27] God perfected hereby know we that we are
[16:30] in him he that seeth he abide in him but
[16:35] himself also to even as he
[16:38] want Brethren I write no new commandment
[16:41] unto you but an old commandment which he
[16:44] had from the beginning the old
[16:46] commandment is the word which you have
[16:48] heard from the beginning again a new
[16:50] commandment I write unto you which
[16:52] things is true in him and in you because
[16:55] the darkness is path the True Light now
[16:58] shineth so this is where John goes
[17:01] deeper in verse 9 he that sayth he is in
[17:04] the light and hated his brother now
[17:08] remember I want you to focus they not
[17:10] Sinners he's talking to right this is
[17:12] church folks he that seeth he's in the
[17:15] light and hated his brother is in
[17:18] darkness even until now doesn't matter
[17:20] what they believe Doesn't Matter What
[17:22] doctrine verse 10 he that loveth his
[17:25] brother abideth in the light and there
[17:28] is none occasion of stumbling in him but
[17:32] he that hateth his brother is in
[17:34] darkness and WTH in darkness and knoweth
[17:39] not whether he goeth because that
[17:42] Darkness has blinded his eyes Okay I
[17:46] want scripture here before we get to Job
[17:47] 1 Peter 3 verse
[17:50] 1-7 and something I want to get here
[17:53] remember what we call the prayer
[17:55] connections all right I know it doesn't
[17:57] sound I can connect it but we we get it
[18:00] 1 Peter 3 verse1 says likewise you
[18:04] wise be in subjection to your own
[18:07] husbands not any man your own husbands
[18:11] and if any obey not the word which is
[18:14] the husbands not BR they also May
[18:16] without the word be W by the
[18:19] conversation of their wives that
[18:21] conversation is way of life not to right
[18:24] verse two while they behold your Chase
[18:27] way of life conversation coupl with here
[18:30] whose adoring let it not be the outward
[18:33] adoring of platin here we we a BL put on
[18:36] a parel but let it be the hidden man of
[18:40] the heart so it identifies here the
[18:43] quality of spirit Christian wi should
[18:46] have and what they play in them in other
[18:50] words not your clothing not wearing of
[18:53] gold or put an apparel that not what
[18:55] you're pushing but what you have
[18:58] here verse four but let it be the hidden
[19:01] man of the heart in which it is not
[19:03] corruptible even the ornament of a Meek
[19:07] and quiet Spirit Meek and quiet Spirit
[19:11] not carrying on Raam muffing you loose
[19:15] and you you know well Street like
[19:18] Behavior no no no me Qui Spirit which is
[19:22] in the sight of God of great price for
[19:26] after this manner in the old times the
[19:28] holy woman also who trusted in God orain
[19:32] or themselves being subject unto their
[19:35] own husbands even as Sarah obey Abraham
[19:39] calling him Lord whose daughters are as
[19:42] long as you do well and not afraid with
[19:45] any amazement so what we seeing here see
[19:47] this this as long as this will shock you
[19:49] that this is the order of God but this
[19:51] is the part I want to get you at verse
[19:53] seven likewise ye husbands dwell with
[19:58] them
[19:59] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[20:02] the wife as unto the weaker vessel as
[20:07] being ears together of the grace of life
[20:10] that your prayers be not
[20:14] hinder and I want to look at it closely
[20:18] here now that your prayers be not
[20:21] hindered that
[20:23] means we can do things or things can
[20:27] affect us that our prayers are actually
[20:30] hindered now when we come to like a
[20:33] prayer meeting like what we have tonight
[20:35] A vir prayer meeting and you're being
[20:37] exalted you have to be aware that God
[20:40] will give us keys keys that would unlock
[20:42] doors unlock opportunities and luck and
[20:45] opening to help you then because you
[20:47] don't want to pray in V you don't want
[20:48] to be wasting your time you spend an
[20:50] hour praying and praying come like if
[20:53] you're using a sh play or say Hing Mary
[20:55] and you know God not really recognizing
[20:57] that that is just killing time we don't
[20:59] want to kill time we want to know that
[21:02] like how cour said I've heard your cry I
[21:04] have heard your prayer this particular
[21:06] scripture
[21:08] addressing Connection in prayer how a
[21:13] wrong connection with wife could affect
[21:15] a husband prayer we could reverse it
[21:17] also a wrong connection with your
[21:19] husband affects the wife prayer hindered
[21:23] your prayer actually get hindered so in
[21:25] other words if a sister is not in the
[21:28] spirit of this word that we just read
[21:30] here what prayer God will hear from her
[21:33] if she can't respect her husband H her
[21:35] husband listen to her husband she's not
[21:38] in the word she's in her own self in her
[21:41] own thing right now husband now he has
[21:44] to have wisdom and dwell with them
[21:47] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[21:49] the one as unto the weak of vessel and
[21:52] being ears together of the grace of God
[21:55] that your prayers be not hinded so we
[21:58] don't want any hindrance tonight so I'm
[22:00] going to show you tonight that your
[22:02] prayer is not an isolated thing even
[22:05] though you in your own house in your own
[22:07] room is not just you and that's you and
[22:11] you alone but there are prayer
[22:14] connections and this is where I want to
[22:17] go to the text which is substantive text
[22:18] tonight
[22:20] J and the Lord here we go turned the
[22:25] Captivity of
[22:26] joob when he prayed for his
[22:29] friends also the lord gave job twice as
[22:34] much as he had
[22:36] before now I wouldn't wary you with this
[22:39] because I know you know the story right
[22:41] now job's story is Affliction by Satan
[22:45] under God's permission right job lost
[22:47] his wealth his children his health and
[22:50] was less to suffer his friends who came
[22:53] to comfort him accused him of being a
[22:56] Sinn job you know job carry on but he
[22:59] never cured God right God finally
[23:03] answered job out of a willing challenged
[23:05] job and job eventually humbled himself
[23:09] I've heard of the by the I see the and
[23:12] so like that then God
[23:15] rebuked job's friends for speaking
[23:18] wrongly about him and commanded them to
[23:21] offer sacrifices and to ask job to pray
[23:24] for them but here's the thing the Bible
[23:28] says the Lord turned the Captivity of
[23:32] job when he prayed for
[23:36] him this is what I identify as a prayer
[23:40] connection the Captivity of job in other
[23:42] words job couldn't get his breakthrough
[23:44] until he did this
[23:46] act he couldn't go and fast for 40 days
[23:49] and 40 nights and come back and say
[23:51] hallelujah thank you Jesus Glory Glory
[23:53] Hallelujah no no no no no he have some
[23:56] friends or some brethren that has fely
[24:00] accused and God want job to be in a
[24:05] position to pray for these people now he
[24:08] can't pray for them these Bunch are
[24:10] richet oh God I can't take it no more
[24:14] and them no no no that's not what he had
[24:17] to forgive them he had to feel for them
[24:21] and he has to pray for them and then God
[24:23] released Jo so
[24:26] sometimes your prayer of greatr have to
[24:30] do with a connection maybe your husband
[24:32] maybe your wife maybe your children
[24:33] maybe your father mother uncle aunt boss
[24:36] whatever it is there may be some other
[24:38] person that is connected that that that
[24:40] has to be dealt with so until job obeyed
[24:46] God and showed compassion and
[24:48] forgiveness he couldn't get that way
[24:51] through and when he did that God blessed
[24:55] you and restore his prosperity and give
[24:59] him twice as we say give him double for
[25:01] his trouble he double up all what job
[25:04] had so it identifies that suffering is
[25:09] not always a result of
[25:11] sin suffering could be part of a test of
[25:14] Fai suffering could be also part of
[25:17] getting spiritual growth but it shows
[25:20] how you could press on in prayer and
[25:22] stand the word like how the prophet said
[25:25] it that job couldn't hear from God but
[25:29] the devil could move it so when we talk
[25:32] about prayer and connections connection
[25:35] is like
[25:38] relationship now I want to go into now
[25:41] briefly relationship and
[25:45] things so God could show if God shows
[25:48] you can get things you could ask for car
[25:52] house land husband wife you could get
[25:54] things higher pay better job blessings
[25:58] things but what he's interested in is
[26:03] relationship relationship now a
[26:06] relationship is there we go is the way
[26:10] two or more people are
[26:13] connected or the way they behave towards
[26:17] each other you cannot have a
[26:19] relationship with yourself let me repeat
[26:22] that you cannot have a relationship with
[26:25] yourself you have to relationship with
[26:27] somebody else two people right so you
[26:32] could say two men have a good working
[26:35] relationship the way in which two or
[26:38] more people feel and behave one each
[26:42] other so in John
[26:45] 13 Jesus said this same thing that John
[26:48] referred to what we read a new
[26:50] commandment I give to you talking to the
[26:51] disciples that you love one another as I
[26:55] have loved you so even if you have
[26:58] issues with your
[27:01] brethren Jesus was saying I am not
[27:03] talking about the issues among another I
[27:06] want you to love each other as I love
[27:09] you so what you're drawing from is God's
[27:13] love his love and he says now as I have
[27:16] loved you that you also love one another
[27:18] then he make this BMB statement and John
[27:20] 1325 by this shall all men know to are
[27:26] might now this is a whole Sy by itself
[27:28] if you have love one for another not if
[27:31] you have books not if you have tapes not
[27:33] if you talking the same talk and message
[27:35] talk and Doctrine talk and whatnot not
[27:37] that but if you have love one for
[27:39] another
[27:41] relationships is the way two or more
[27:44] people are connected or the way they
[27:47] behave towards each other relationship
[27:49] is also a connection between two or more
[27:52] facts like the relationship or the
[27:55] connection between smoking and cancer
[27:57] the relationship between or connection
[27:59] between hating anger and cancer it is a
[28:03] known fact people who in hatred and in
[28:05] Anger they tend to get tumors ulcers all
[28:08] kind of stuff right because they
[28:10] inviting Spirits they inviting chemical
[28:13] reactions and breaking in the body then
[28:15] I Spirit s in the next minute they have
[28:17] some tumor they have some kind of issue
[28:18] and now listen friends as I wrap up here
[28:22] try to
[28:23] W you can build a relationship
[28:28] you can develop a
[28:30] relationship you can establish a
[28:34] relationship you could have good
[28:37] relationships you could have close
[28:39] relationships you could have working
[28:41] relationship one time I was working with
[28:43] a guy principal about he's a cook but
[28:46] guess what he's the boss so we couldn't
[28:49] have a friendly you know body body
[28:52] relationship but had a working
[28:53] relationship to make sure whatever work
[28:55] needs to be done I to do it but you
[28:57] could have things and no relationship
[29:01] you could have money car house
[29:03] possession and no real
[29:06] con you live a selfish life is all about
[29:10] you yours maybe your husband children
[29:13] and the story ends right
[29:16] there now I want to share this with you
[29:19] but brother have an experience of a man
[29:21] that came to prayed for he was blind and
[29:24] the first thing he saw the man had no
[29:26] food
[29:28] platform and the first thing he said he
[29:30] slipped off his shoes give him my coat
[29:33] his should was much bigger he wanted to
[29:35] give him his coat his feet was much
[29:36] larger and I thought Paul's fellow
[29:38] probably never eat a decent meal in his
[29:40] life and I thought that look what
[29:43] happened to him he's blind Paul fellow
[29:46] if my daddy would have lived he'd be
[29:47] about that age and he said these
[29:50] words you have to feel for
[29:53] people if you
[29:55] can't you can never help
[29:58] anybody so you see like how God say He
[30:01] Love A Cheerful Giver you could give but
[30:03] you're not you're not happy to give you
[30:05] could actually share but you're not
[30:07] happy to share you're doing it because
[30:09] the law say or the words say or the
[30:11] rules say but you don't have the spirit
[30:13] behind it and brother Brandon says you
[30:17] have to feel for people if you can't you
[30:21] can never help anybody you've got to
[30:25] feel for them youve got to take it upon
[30:27] yourself and I just put my arms around
[30:30] him to see what he's he's getting into
[30:31] it he put his arms around him I said
[30:33] Heavenly Father be merciful to this poor
[30:38] man and I looked out there I see him
[30:40] standing looking at me out in front out
[30:42] there with his eyes and I know if he
[30:45] ever open his eyes it was over I just
[30:48] waited a few moments he Glory of Glory
[30:51] to God you know and he could see as good
[30:53] as I could stand stand on the platform
[30:56] and brother whatever I'm talking about
[30:57] to effectively pray for somebody you
[30:59] have to feel for them even if somebody
[31:02] is problematic to you you if you keep
[31:06] praying for that person you cannot hate
[31:09] that person you feel sorry for that
[31:11] person you'll have compassion for that
[31:14] person because that's a person that
[31:15] Jesus died for but abam said this not
[31:18] and I thought you know you have to feel
[31:21] the person's condition or you will never
[31:24] help you have got to hear these words
[31:26] enter into their
[31:28] suffering if you just go
[31:32] wholeheartedly it will never work you've
[31:35] got to place
[31:36] yourself maybe a big gang of little
[31:39] children out there somewhere question
[31:41] tonight do you want things or do you
[31:45] want to be a disciple some people use
[31:48] church and the gospel and the Lord and
[31:50] everything else as a tool a tool to
[31:52] satisfy their lust or satisfy their
[31:56] desire just
[31:57] their ambition what do you want tonight
[32:01] things or you want to come in obedience
[32:04] to God's word and the LA Matthew 6 we
[32:07] almost there
[32:10] right Matthew 6 Jesus speaks therefore I
[32:13] say unto you take no thought of your
[32:15] life what you shall eat what you shall
[32:17] drink so he's
[32:19] addressing desires that we have we pay
[32:22] the rent right this these are things
[32:23] that we need to get done for yet for
[32:25] your body what you shall put on like
[32:27] clothing is not life more than meat and
[32:30] body more than rainment R all the air
[32:32] for they so not neither do they reap no
[32:35] gu into BS yet your heavenly father
[32:36] feeded them right are are you not better
[32:39] than these which of You by giv thought
[32:41] can want cubert statue and you talk
[32:43] about the field field and so not part
[32:48] wherefore if God so CL the grass of the
[32:51] field which today is and tomorrow is
[32:53] cast into you of shall he not much
[32:54] closethe you be fit so the things he's
[32:58] saying God will take care of that go
[32:59] take care of that verse 31 therefore
[33:03] take no thought saying what shall we eat
[33:05] what shall we drink where it shall we be
[33:08] clothed for here we go after all these
[33:12] things do the Gentiles
[33:14] seek so don't do like Gentiles they
[33:17] after this in that way for your heavenly
[33:20] father know it that you want them no he
[33:24] said your heavenly father know it that
[33:27] you have need of all these things now
[33:31] God promised to supply your needs not
[33:33] your wants your needs he know you need
[33:36] clothes he know you need food he know
[33:37] you need shelter you know you need money
[33:39] to pay a rent he know you need this you
[33:41] need that what you need so the need part
[33:44] is not an issue he know what you have
[33:45] need of these are things but verse 33
[33:49] say it but seek ye first the kingdom of
[33:53] God and his righteous and all these
[33:59] things shall be added unto you so he is
[34:02] saying don't seek things seek
[34:07] relationship don't seek things seek the
[34:10] connections them take their for no
[34:13] thought for tomorrow for the tomorrow
[34:15] shall take thought for the things of
[34:17] itself sufficient of the days the evil
[34:19] thereof okay you're almost
[34:23] there pray connections Abraham
[34:28] Abraham never fight before never had a
[34:30] battle before he was in the desert and
[34:31] you know the story Abraham L lot had
[34:34] toward Sodom the mayor the city down
[34:36] there he's doing fine there but judgment
[34:39] coming all right and Abraham
[34:44] know that he is connected to
[34:47] lot and he decide to plead for lot pray
[34:51] for lot bear in mind lot don't have a
[34:55] clue his
[34:57] Abraham is praying for him and pleading
[35:00] for him if there's 50 righteous would
[35:02] you destroy Sodom if there's 30 if
[35:04] there's 20 if there is 10 he is going
[35:06] down that road because he want to see
[35:10] lot
[35:11] delivered that is the real Spirit of
[35:15] Christ it has a prayer connection he
[35:18] could have
[35:20] said man get bless with
[35:25] me you make up a bed he go sleep in it
[35:29] we so he go reap no no no no no no that
[35:32] is not the connection he had
[35:36] here so after Abraham plead we know the
[35:40] story Angel was dispatched to get lot up
[35:43] but listen to Matthew 18
[35:45] tonight Jesus said I say unto you if two
[35:50] of you shall agree on it as touching
[35:54] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[35:57] done them of My Father which is in
[36:00] heaven Jesus put a clause not just you
[36:04] now in your pray Clos but if two of you
[36:08] shall agree look how much of us has here
[36:10] tonight we could agree tonight on God's
[36:14] presence and power and God healing and
[36:16] God virtue and God strength if who of
[36:18] you shall agree that means Jesus is
[36:22] expecting us to
[36:23] connect Jesus is expecting us to have
[36:25] prayer connection
[36:27] pray Partners pray connection all you
[36:29] want to see it it's not just you soloing
[36:31] and nobody know what I going through and
[36:34] nobody come and look for me nobody shake
[36:36] their hand have no love and Breen are
[36:39] reaching out and this and that all that
[36:41] kind of
[36:42] foolishness you'll get all that nonsense
[36:45] and you would examine your own heart and
[36:47] life you don't come like somebody
[36:50] complain nobody come and look for them
[36:51] andbody pray with them and and GRE them
[36:53] and what when reverse the question do
[36:55] you look for anybody no do you pray
[36:57] anybody no do you go no so they don't do
[37:00] but they want to be done you a big shot
[37:03] you want to be on some Throne to be
[37:04] served you're not looking to serve why
[37:06] not begin to serve why not begin to pray
[37:09] and reach out so this is a key right
[37:12] here if two of you should agree do you
[37:17] agree with anybody there some people
[37:19] miserable they contentious they
[37:22] contenter us you say boo they say B they
[37:25] just go opposite just just because they
[37:28] have a kind of I don't know a kind of
[37:30] crazy nature of going opposite to the
[37:33] trend of things they don't want to fall
[37:34] in line they want to be different and
[37:37] they being obnoxious being IND different
[37:39] because they don't want to be in Harmony
[37:40] and the Bible talk about us being in the
[37:43] spirit then forget in Ephesians you talk
[37:46] about equality of spirit you have to
[37:49] begin to maintain that order of spirit
[37:52] okay what speaking about Unity of one
[37:55] God in church on their Pentecost
[37:57] but the Holy Ghost came from heav
[37:58] rushing Mighty wi the intellectual said
[38:00] men and virgin what shall we do and
[38:02] Peter said repent every one of you he
[38:04] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[38:06] the remission of his sins you Char the
[38:07] gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises
[38:09] unto you and your children to them that
[38:11] are far off even as Lord of God shall
[38:14] call there is what God wants you filled
[38:17] with here we go he wants you filled with
[38:20] the Holy Ghost then you'll be United
[38:25] what to what to a church no sir you'll
[38:29] Beed what to a Creed no sir you'll Beed
[38:32] to God and you and him will be one and
[38:35] as he as the father is one and what
[38:38] spirit will live in you the same works
[38:39] that the Holy Spirit performed when it
[38:41] was here in Christ Jesus shall be
[38:43] performed in you he said he will do it
[38:45] Jesus prayed for that now he says in the
[38:50] prayer tonight our Heavenly Master pray
[38:52] to the father that we be one he and God
[38:55] is one how CL with God was the life and
[38:58] spirit in him and if we are one with him
[39:02] we will be life and spirit of him will
[39:05] be in us then Earthly here we go Anana
[39:09] intellectual conception C and dogas will
[39:13] fade out and a new generated Born Again
[39:18] version experience of the baptism of the
[39:21] holy spirit will take place in the human
[39:23] heart then you'll be one then brother
[39:27] will really be brother sister will be
[39:29] sister your objectives and your motives
[39:32] and all that you are and all that you
[39:35] ever want to be or try to be will before
[39:38] the kingdom God no matter what church
[39:43] you represent where you
[39:46] go oh this is a beautiful quote this is
[39:49] a beautiful what you will be have in
[39:51] your heart the kingdom of
[39:54] God true there are so many people today
[39:59] who says that the holy spirit is not
[40:00] real today while tens of thousands of
[40:03] them and millions are saying it is not
[40:05] so there are many enjoying the blessings
[40:07] of mostly are poor people people who
[40:10] have been dejected and rejected by the
[40:12] world people who have been thrown over
[40:15] of their churches because they believe
[40:16] God to be God and they are been filled
[40:19] with the spirit they are one in purpose
[40:22] they are one in heart who are those
[40:24] people and but say Methodist Baptist
[40:29] Presbyterian Catholic je witness
[40:32] Orthodox Jews all together they become
[40:34] one not one to a Creed not one to an
[40:38] denomination that's the working of the
[40:40] devil to intellectual conceptions but
[40:43] the working Holy Spirit the kingdom of
[40:46] God in you God sets on the throne of
[40:49] your heart in his control room listen
[40:52] carefully Saints controlling your
[40:54] emotions controlling your Powers
[40:57] controlling your conceptions making you
[40:59] one with him fellowship and in love and
[41:03] God fills you with love there a word we
[41:06] don't hear much of we hear Mysteries and
[41:08] all kind of Revelations and so on but
[41:10] God fills you with love he fills you
[41:12] with power he fills you with the spirit
[41:15] he fills you with his own divine nature
[41:18] and he changes your carnal nature into
[41:20] his nature then in this you become a new
[41:23] creature Creation in Christ then here we
[41:27] go then the love you go out and
[41:29] seemingly the bird seem different how
[41:32] different it is when Christ come or you
[41:34] can look back and think how I ever stay
[41:37] away from it how did I ever reject it
[41:40] everything is
[41:42] different B you have no
[41:45] enemies they all look sweet you can
[41:48] forgive everything that's ever been done
[41:52] the bitterest of enemy you can pray for
[41:56] on the Street's pause right a bden
[41:58] Myster b
[42:00] b bit of enemy people want to Fellowship
[42:04] another something wrong something is
[42:06] very
[42:07] wrong the bitterest of enemy you could
[42:11] pray for him on the street not only that
[42:14] put your arms around him and lift him up
[42:18] no matter what Creed or denomination
[42:21] belong he a preater whose Christ died
[42:24] and that's what God wants you to fill
[42:26] with that's the filling that's the
[42:29] kingdom that we all want praise the Lord
[42:32] last quot on we done
[42:34] get butam says isn't it wonderful I love
[42:39] him my heart I love him if I know any
[42:42] heart I believe you do too so together
[42:44] we are his children we love one another
[42:46] no I can't love him without loving you
[42:51] pause on that pause on that
[42:55] tonight if you say you love God you can
[42:57] love your
[42:59] brother says a liar you're lying you're
[43:02] not talking the truth I cannot love him
[43:06] without loving you and if I say I love
[43:09] him and don't love you read the Bible
[43:13] said I am a
[43:14] liar if you wanted to love me or love my
[43:18] family the choice was what do I want you
[43:21] to do love me or love my family you love
[43:25] my family I'd rather you love Billy Paul
[43:29] and love me if it come to that kind of
[43:32] Showdown I'd rather you do it I want you
[43:36] to listen to me because Billy is not a
[43:39] minister but I want you to listen to me
[43:42] I tell you when you want to love
[43:45] somebody really love them you say I want
[43:47] to either love you or Billy you love
[43:50] Billy God feels the same way about us
[43:55] then I know you can't love Billy without
[43:57] loving me was he part so I can't love
[44:01] God without loving you because you are
[44:04] part of God and we love one another and
[44:08] I think that is very let us bow ahead
[44:11] heavenly father I thank you Lord for
[44:14] this prayer
[44:16] connection I try to show your people
[44:18] here tonight that
[44:20] job until he prayed for his friends his
[44:25] accusers

[44:29] couldn't get that double portion he
[44:31] couldn't get that double
[44:32] bless Lord instead of two or three would
[44:35] agree they could have what they ask for
[44:39] Lord Abraham had was to connect with
[44:42] lot's condition to pray for
[44:44] him Lord it was like a sign of adoption
[44:47] going after his Fallen brother and
[44:49] getting him back and everything else
[44:50] like that but the fact is he had that
[44:53] prayer
[44:54] communion Lord help us tonight to stand
[44:58] in Christ dead to have that connection
[45:02] we are not in this thing
[45:03] alone devil pull people aside in a
[45:06] corner and they have their own mind
[45:08] battles and fights and fears and
[45:10] thinking they're fighting all alone and
[45:12] everything else and the devil just
[45:13] beaten up in a corner here we are in
[45:15] this virtual room Lord together in
[45:18] prayer asking for your intervention ask
[45:20] him for your virtue ask that you reveal
[45:22] to
