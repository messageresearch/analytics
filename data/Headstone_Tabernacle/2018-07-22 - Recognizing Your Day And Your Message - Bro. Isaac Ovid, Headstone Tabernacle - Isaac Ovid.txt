and reading Philippians 3 and verse 13 brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus middle Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated Amen I'd like to greet you in the precious name of Jesus Christ this morning and welcome you to the house of the Lord we do have some special visitors there's a Alice Williams as here with us this morning where she at god bless you welcome to the headstone tabernacle we're happy to have you with us this morning and we also have Omega Castillo Shaniqua he'd Shana he'd Ciera he'd and Xavier he'd invited by with a Mike Blackmon where you at god bless you welcome to Hester tavern after we're happy to have you with us amen so I have a title this morning and the title is recognizing your day and your message and an inspiration return unto the Lord you know and it's so powerful coming off of the convention and the inspiration and seeing that you know but the Branham said the evening time message is to apply the token and when you really look at that scripture just to me find quickly here in Exodus chapter 12 when I just place it in context and it's so refreshing when you're in the wood isn't around I trust you in the word this week amen and the Lord Exodus 12 verse 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt seeing this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you and it was after that that the Lord gave the instructions of how to get the lamb for the house and but what struck me is that at this point when God was bringing to them this first concept of the talk and he said forget everything in the past this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it doesn't matter what month you're in what day it is where what happened in your life forget everything else I'm having this conversation with you today and this month is a new beginning to you this month is a new day to you yesterday is over last month is over last year is over the last five years is over your problems your past your mistake whether you went to church last week or not this month from this word power is the beginning of a new dispensation for you it's the beginning of a new season for you it's a beginning of a new opportunity for you it's a beginning of a new ministry for you it's a beginning of a new understanding for you is a beginning of a new talk for you it's a beginning of the new walk free because after you to enter your what I'm about to tell you things will look different things work sound different things will feel different it's refreshing to know that God is a God of renewal he's a God of starting over he's a God of new beginnings and every time the Sun Goes Down and the moon appears night comes and the dawn appears it's a reminder when the Sun rises again that it's an EP every day we are reminded that it's a mutate that God is willing to stop over for you to pick up the pieces and a movement a new day a new Sun make when that Sun is how many years ago and Jesus rose from the dead it was the beginning of a new dispensation it was beginning of the new season and each of us in our Christian journey there's a new month for us there's a new day for us there's a new week for us can the church say man hallelujah so I feel that coming into this month of July for us coming off of the convention with an inspiration of the token that this is a beginning of months for us it's a new season for this church I'm speaking to this local church here so it's a new time for us it's a new season in our lives it's a new season in my life and and the reality is as as Moses would have been sharing this to the people it would have been up to each of the individuals Patchett for themselves everybody doesn't catch it all at the same time and God was speaking to Moses and Aaron he wasn't speaking to everybody but it was up to Moses and Aaron to convey to the people that hey this is a new beginning we have not walked this way before and they would be in for a series of new beginnings because even when Joshua took over he would say we have not been this way before and many times along your life's journey you will meet situations and challenges and opportunities that you have never met before and every time you meet something you have not met before it's a new beginning to you [Music] because something has to happen on the inside to meet the challenge of the hour to meet the obstacle of the hour and throughout scripture throughout every Patriot throughout every prophet throughout every King and every priests and every leader every time they met a new situation or they met a problem or they're met and obstacle God has always been faithful to raise up somebody with a word with a sign with a miracle with a testimony with an inspiration to prove that he's the same yesterday to prove he's the same today to prove he the same forever it could be one person it could be five people but whether Branham taught us God will always have a witness [Applause] God will always have a witness you know so many times and I now get to preaching but sometimes I just want to share a few things you know and remember when David had the great victory and after the victory let me see if I get it quickly mighty Ministry of David you appreciate the Avis ministry [Applause] we cannot be gonna take our time this woman keep your seatbelts buckled keep your seatbelt buckle amen so you find it in in in first Sammy well fitty this one and it came to pass that when David and his men will come to Ziggler you familiar with the scripture on the third day that the Amalekites had invaded the south and Ziggler and smitten Ziggler and burnt it with fire and I've taken the woman captives that with aaron is soon on any either great or small but carried em away and went on the way so David and his men came to the city and behold it was burn with fire you imagine you come home and see your home burn with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives and then David and the people I were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep you know as a cry until you came in crying no more they wept but I am trying until they couldn't even weapon you couldn't weep no more you cry daily have no more tears the criteria lost your voice that's how sorrowful they were and David wise were taken captive and David was greatly distressed listen to this for the people speak of stoning him this is the same David who when everybody was scared was the only man to face Goliath this was his same David who had led them into numerous battles and had numerous victories and here is something we're wrong and all after all he we pin and nobody up their voice they still have enough voice to say let's let's store him because the soul of the people were grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but David what did the Bible say encouraged himself and you know when the Prophet says he could turn your wife against you he could turn your children against you he could turn the church against you this is when you have to now the challenge is but ask me it's easy to preach this you know but when you hear these stones have been picked up and these storms are being prepared to be thrown you have to have a true revelation of encouraging yourself in the Lord and I believe God will allow situations that come to us for us I have to encourage our cell in the law because our spiritual type is Eagles and what distinguishes Eagles from other birds is two main things the Eagle is you only put a look at the storm and flames it other birds when his storm coming they say let's go away from the storm but the ego could look at these torments they are looking at finding sauce the ID middle of it because my wings could take me there so our girl isn't afraid of challenges and opposition and and problems that that that wasn't seen an eagle and the other thing about the eagle is an ego could fly alone and Eagan doesn't need validation an ego doesn't need permission to worship and eager doesn't need permission to pray for mission to qualifier permission to see Lord and in a miracle in this house eager to even attach the posture to pray for their children because an eagle understands that it's an eagle and an eagle does what an eagle is built to - an eagle is built to overcoming evil is not dentist in the bunny out of depression and the Pawnee out of confusion and the money out of situation and either could raise above the obstacles and encourage themselves the third attribute of the eagle and there are few of them number three whenever there's food the Eagles come together because once there's good food Eagles come together to eat cod food so this morning it's a and you know what a a convocation is a convocation by definition is a gathering of eagles it's a flock of birds there's a convocation of Eagles Eagles get your own category because when they come together it's a different story Eagles come together to share their testimony of how they meet it over and how it all hell was against him how they encourage themselves in the Lord when their wife didn't encourage them their husband didn't encourage them they have no money to pay the bills but he encouraged himself in the Lord because though you may receive it the Lord is his word and the word is the Lord so when you encourage yourself in the Lord it means you can reach into the scripture and follow us relevant to your situation at that particular point in time so when you have no money you can share and reach into the Lord and say the Bible should have never seen the righteous back read order oh come on somebody help somebody helped me this morning so I'm here to encourage you to encourage yourself in the Lord because Sunday's is just one day of the week but on Monday when the past is not around when the deacon is not around you have to be able to encourage yourself in the Lord when your boss thoughts mean to you and you feel like answering back you encourage yourself in the Lord and you bridle your tongue because mark the perfect manicured bridle his tongue and and you encourage yourself in the Lord or come on somebody help me somebody help me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] may the service be a new beginning to us because the word has to have an effect I don't want any lives it must have an effect in our homes it must have an effect within our families it was have an effect in our neighborhoods it must have an effect when we go on the bus or we drive the car if the world is that having an effect beyond your presence in church you are doing a disservice to the effectiveness of the way because the world has an objective and Jesus the words headed this way my word cannot return void so once the word is this scratch it is designed with the purpose and that purpose is to bring forth what it was designed for and when you leave this Tabernacle this morning it must be designed that you are Monday you overcome on Tuesday you overcome on Wednesday you overcome you may be seated I'm gonna Clarence called rich in mercy weather kindly created trials every day because for you to become an overcomer every day when apart well there has to be something to overcome every day oh come on somebody please back to me Oh somebody or somebody help me but I said the trials how else can you overcome you only one overcome one day a week God designed try us every day seven days a week multiple trials so you gotta testimony I overcame this morning when there was no breakfast I overcame that you to have no food he was the toughest house and that's when God met him oh come on come on I don't care what the problem is get something to overcome everything it's not your wife who's a problem your children is not the problem God send the child for you to be an overcomer he send the problem for you you may be seated [Applause] [Music] hallelujah every situation but the wall it's different but for you it's an opportunity to overcome the damage different for you it's an opportunity to worship hallelujah hallelujah it's not our place to understand all that God wants to do for us when we want him to explain it he said my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not my ways as they happens a higher than the earth so my toes higher and your toes he allows us to understand what he wants us to understand but outside of that in the midst of your trial worship in the midst of your problem worship when you have no money worship when you are tired worship when all hell is against you worship when you feel sick worship when you feel tired worship when you are pressed under pressure worship worship we are born to worship you are born to worship worship proceeds a practice of the Holy Ghost worship receives your break true worship receives your family being delivered do we have any worshipers worshipers in their house hallelujah oh so many you go to sorrow praise [Applause] listen you may be seated we worship not because of what he has done or what he will do oh no no no no no no no no worship it's based on who he is that's the reason we worship because He is God every other religion every other belief they have all kind of reasons to do what they do but us we worship because He is God we worship because he is the creator we worship because he's a healer we can heal when he wants to heal but he is a healer and that's why we worship Him we worship because he's a restorer and he promised missing limbs will be restored but we worship Him anyhow we pray we sigh Atari but he still deserves worship you may be seated your spiritual condition has nothing to do with God is evolution let me say that again your spiritual condition has nothing to do with God deserving worship [Applause] you could come on up I in the morning and he still deserves worship has nothing to do with your spiritual condition this is an outside-in experience and some of you your bodies don't know what seat is on the inside that's why the Bible said bring your body under subjection that seed has to come in the right environment and get food to begin to pulse it to let your spirit know and let your body know that there's a seed German your soul that you didn't put there you didn't earn it he did nothing to deserve it but God rich in mercy before there was a moon before there was a stop before there was a molecule before there was let there be anything that sure was prepared with the mystery of who you are [Applause] he may be seated and that's why the devil is jealous of you [Music] he's jealous of you where am i King because he had a beginning and because he had a beginning he must have an ending because anything that had a beginning has to have an ending hatred had a beginning it will not always exist hatred has an ending but love never had a beginning because God is love and God never had a beginning so love will conquer a multitude of sins multitude of problems and to know that you are an attribute of the eternal God you are an attribute of the eternal spirit then nothing past present future because all of this is subject to time your instructions your influence comes from above your instructions your influence he may be seated that's why no matter what you go through when you come to church you feel something I've said it before when you when you put Wi-Fi on your phone and you connect your network when you leave the location of a network because network is specific to location so it is Wi-Fi in this building and you're here you're connected to the network when you data drive away from the church the moment you get past a certain boundary you will automatically disconnect and then when you get maybe to your house you're connected a network over there well that Wi-Fi has a user name and has a password and the thing is your genetic coding God has that username and password so the very first time you came in contact with this message there was a Wi-Fi connection automatic and then the word start to make sense to you and the thing of it is this is why when people black slider make mistake and it come for a while but of course when they come back into the process all of a sudden you start to remember things and because we are on the same network when you meet a brother on the road and and maybe didn't turn and shake his hand as a there's a connection because we are part of the same or you don't get me this morning you don't hear me this morning or you know hear me this morning [Applause] you incident that's why I encourage you no matter how you're feeling come together and fellowship the Bible said forsake not the assembling of ourselves together especially as the Day approaching a lot a Wi-Fi interference or kind of distraction trying to interrupt the connection because this connection is not designed for when you're in the tablet because when the same network that's why Philip could be in a meeting and Crocket say there's somebody else just connected to the network and Philip at the leaf was translated to the Ethiopian eunuch will somehow figure out how to connect to the network oh you know give me this you have to understand the maps it has nothing new Under the Sun and all that man is trying to do has already existed Paul and Silas in prison we want automatic door automatic heat automatic coffee automatic this automatic that Paul and Silas in prison where Terrence and I just had to worship I just had to pray the first official 24 hours before we get to that but it was automatic door gets opened people get in trouble to sleep those guards were sleeping they get an instant sleep remedy when the angel came for Paul and Silas never had a good night rest Roberto they couldn't explain where Paul and Silas went but Horace has an automatic heat those men gotta sleep remedy and Paul and Silas come out shouting and worshipping because they were on the same network you were visited and a network is about connections and the human body is connections because at the atomic subatomic level all of our nerves and everything is connected and scientists will tell you the reason you can get an electric shock is because your body actually conducts electricity you are your own power generator when your heart pumps and your body takes in oxygen you actually generating electricity so your fingers are connected to your brain and somebody tell you if you got a pain in your jaw is gonna get to your heart it's going to the disk because it's all connected so this Wi-Fi thing is not a doctrine you know because when you're baptized in the body or part of the body and as part of the body you automatically connected Michael Jones that's why there can be no schism in the body a copy jealousy in the body how can he big to look at he Hannah's hair jealous his hand and I wish I could eat all and nihon have two different purposes and you know what if you have a missing finger your whole body feels it it is appealing a little finger your whole body fuses because it's one buddy quad isn't coming no for you for Han here and I hand on that side and he head over there and he foot on that side is one buddy and the Holy Ghost comes to unite us as one buddy have you been baptized into de that's why we ought to encourage one another pray for one another look out for one another we had such wonderful fellowship over the convention and believers came here who never came before me so happy with that and in fellowship with some of the young people who came they're like you know it's true to know in heaven have no sections for anybody is the family of God is the body of God and God was influenced his world before the terribly the terrible plague strike there has to be somebody who could damage your love and demonstrate forgiveness and demonstrate mercy and demonstrate charity that has nothing to do with your local church Allen has all to do with the body of Christ because he's coming back for our people United as a party come to church say Amen these are still the comments haven't started a message yet but George with the Clarence when I started speaking years ago I said be a short short which really short in height and shortened message length but as I'm getting older the heights really seem but he'll entity messages get it longer because it's too much good food he can't walk in double fear and just take appetizer and say I good you do at this service it's amazing when you gotta be fair to get your money's woods that's a weird some people out there bill I said you need to go you need to leave now but when it come to the house of God you come to get ammunition as much ammunition as you can carry you know I saw something yesterday and a guy said he thought he had seen it all until he saw this musician and it's this video of this young man he's putting on something on his back and it's a drum set and he takes a cord and he touches it to his foot he takes the next chord and put his next foot then he takes like guitar attached the next chord to a party drum behind and when I thought he was done he put something aside with an accordion and this one-man band start to play and stomp on him and his guitar its drum it's accordion and then you stopped pretty accordance after singing I stabilize it and as some people can play one instrument but here you have this man clean all these instruments as one and I'm seeing to see when you come to the house of God you have to come to get as much weapons as you could carry it have some people will just take another knife I'm going to say well this is what I want to fight with this week but I feel when I come to the house of God if I could fit a bazooka five grenades a rocket launcher and nice if it's a rubberband as much robanukah gets but whatever is a bullet its rubberband and shooting whatever it is but I am going down fighting ever going down because this earth belongs our and the devil is a rubber he's a thief he comes to destroy homes and families he affect our houses our marriages our lives and we have to reach us what to say enough is enough sickness is that my Porsche depression is that my portion being sad is that my promise look what am under Stalin a wee bit of madness could sign up everybody should be signing up he may be seen it when they cut off part of our mothers foot and when I - came to say without first day I said only were the mothers that come over some I like this he said but I Isaac the devil is under my feet [Music] [Applause] [Music] I said look at perspective look at perspective and you know what'd he give any devil or a run for his money because he is still anyhow oh god he's still signing up he's still worshiping and he has a promise to meet a pillar of fire that will transform its water into immortality but the bottom said how could we have safer a rapture I'm not have feet for divine healing it means on the road to the rapture divine healing must be yeah must be here even missing limbs to be restored because the Prophet said it I believe it so shall it be let the devil take that and smoke it come the church say man Oh hallelujah so I want to touch on a thought this morning because we have to grow in grace we have to grow in life our lives must buzz see it's something the purpose of the Bible the purpose of the gospel the purpose of the message is not to stay in written form there are too many people walking around with the written form of the word but that was not the purpose of the written word the written word was to hold a key of mystery until a life can limit to what the New Testament refers to as written epistles that's the mission written epistles not you walking around with the Bible or the spoken word book that's a temporary halt in place for the word to become flesh so the whole mission of coming to service and reading the books and listen to the tapes is for something to happen to convert the tapes and the books into a life and that life is the Thunder that shakes the devil in the written form it was there but when Jesus could now bring it out from written and speak it and live it he said it is written and then it became spoken that's when the devil had to back up God doesn't want to taint us poor world book I'm slinging that the devil as a weapon but when the word is in you you can speak when the word is inner you can live whenever there's any fear demonstrate so whenever you forgive that's the word living you know or somebody preached back to me when you drop your odds that's no longer written word that's living with when a young person references the appearance that's not written the Bible says children obey appearance but when you obey you are living the wood when the purposive husband love your wives that's word but when you demonstrate it passed on living wood and right now we know in part we prophesy in part so we pick scriptures in part and we live it in part but it's coming a time when all of the world will be manifested through us then we become a true reflection because she becomes him and by an experience our identity crisis get solved because he he has to identify you just as in Genesis when Eve came she didn't know she was but Adam had to say you are woman you are flesh of my flesh you are born of my body and then all of a sudden she recognized that she is part of him it was no long it's not it was not just her being identified with him it was he identifying huh and right on we identified with the message but when the message because identify with us and God can say there is my spirit through him really because when a spirit of love really the word is the conductor of the spirit right now though the spirit is trying to flow but it can't flow fully because in our individual lives even though the fullness of the world has been restored individually you know that's why I hear I'll pass wire here but when you have as well a dealer said a balanced diet and you're feasting on the wood the wood is your breakfast the wood is your lunch the word is your dinner you retries to know that your father is the Creator URI tries to know who you are in the world no weapon from the kids you can prosper you begin to live an act and not worry you don't worry sister what the time you say fear not fear not fear not fear not and then you are in a process of bringing your spirit and your body under subjection to the see Jim that's trying to be built up to the control tower of your soul our natural Birds brought a delusion of who we are like I saw recently and I share it in my facebook I was actually shocked but if I mean you can say things shouldn't really shock you when you know what's what's happened but there's a movement in the u.s. to call babies babies to call them babies th ey bie a VB and there's a movement of parents who are of the view that you should not when a child is from the age of zero to four address them with any gender specific nicknames so don't call a boy tiger or tough for don't address him like that because he has to decide if he wants to be a boy or a girl and the movement says don't tell a young girl don't call a princess so beautiful because she has to decide if she wants to be a boy or a girl so don't call our boy or good call it a baby until they decide what they want to be and when you see these things happening around and these movements and all these stuff going on this is what will bring the squeeze and the press because when you speak against it you are now a rebel it's now call here speech it's now call a problem because you are speaking against this movement of free choice and and that's the free will that is going extreme because God gives us all a choice but even choice has its limits and that's the world we are living in and if you don't take a stand for something you'll be standing for nothing so this war this spiritual war because the natural war the same way we have services and we have preaching and we have the word the devil has its ministers and by the Branum identifying them through Elvis Presley and these one truly ages and those were the ones that were there what he could have identified with sins were profit left those guys have been promoted into new forms of ministries and new technologies but the brown said shoot the TV now your phone forget it is worse than a TV should we say shorty but but if Brandon was seeing something coming against and they'll take something to withstand it that's not human effort because if it's human effort it will feel but if it comes from the soul and the fire of the Holy Ghost that is what will stand so by the brand is fixable getting desperate to be positionally pleased in the body before the terrible plague strike because God is obligated and the prophet said if God does not judge this world in its Sodom condition he will have to repent the Sodom and Gomorrah and bring them back up again so judgment is guaranteed and the rapture is guaranteed and before there could be touch when there is always warning can the church say man so there are two things I want to speak on this morning we touch the message now of my comments are over recognized in your day and your message there's two things it's recognizing your D and it's recognized in your message recognized in your deed at times season recognizing the signs recognizing the conditions recognizing the challenges recognizing the opposition but a random speaks about recognizing the two spirits working within the framework of the church recognizing a different inner spiritual believer and the carnal believer recognizing people who want to sacrifice for spiritual things or sacrifice for natural things and many people depend eco Souls the evangelicals D recognize it D they speak about the end is nearly understand and everybody talks that so that means not a surprise to us about recognizing the day because the hour is late everything around the world a political system the religious system the economic systems the academic systems the educational systems the criminal systems everything is pointing to the end means hard to Babbitt's that feeling for fear he was afraid to go out at night people afraid to stuff that didn't exist 40 50 60 70 years ago you speaking somebody six years ago this head into even lock my door neighbors gonna come in and out know is when you're looking up his clacks clacks bang dog loose T dogs put on the alarm when you have to go any morning Kevin Rodney host clacks flat thing because the oil has changed and the spirits that started and operated in Genesis are still here seeds of keen brute beasts the Bible talks about that sink in who the New Testament is capsules of his father the devil so there are people who walk around who have no connection to God they are of their father the devil that's what Jesus said this generation of vipers so when you go to your job on your school and you treat everybody the same it's not that way because everyone has an influence they're only two influences but the brendham tortoise is either influence or impart an influence from below so every day we have to die to ourselves to make sure we know what's influencing us [Applause] and the influence friends it's not just somebody talking to you it's the influence of what your eyes see the atmosphere that you're in the influence of your job the influence of your family it could be the influence of people even within your house because Peter was with Jesus just had a revelation in Matthew 16 don't utter Christ and when Jesus opened their understanding to what was about to happen Peter said know-it-alls you can't die and Jesus said get behind me Satan to identify that even though he had a revelation he just missed the unfolding of what Jesus said no Jesus gotta be careful and Capt Lima pull your side delay it kind of tell he brothers this but he rebuked him openly I wonder how Peter felt but Jesus was not dealing with Peter as a man he was dealing with the spiritual world and what was happening and he also knew that Peter still had a journey to go through to an upper room experience Jesus already knew he was 14 I am Jesus already knew he is gonna Forge everybody knew all this so don't think he things lightly God your heart God your eyes you are spiritual Levites you are called to be priests and kings are chosen people are peculiar people a royal priesthood [Music] recognized in your day but the Branham City let of hell is open and their streams of demon powers loose how could you risk walking out your house without praying how can you risk going to work without praying how could you work how could you risk taking transport without praying how could you spend your whole day in conversation with your friends and family and you don't even talk to God your son rightly said I must tell Jesus all of my troubles how many of your troubles you tell him and do you even tell him at all or do you tell everybody else and forget about him this sounds simple but these are the issues of life but as a people we forget it in the week and we all allows you to get as angry and we upset on you you get emotional and and it's a work up to come to service for next Sunday because your week is are it's an upside-down week now it's different if you're in the spirit it's different if you're praying and your tarrying and you're sighing and you play the songs of Zion and and before you wake up at we're gonna pass nineteen the spirit any a dream better and then you are going to the promises and who there's the time and the season and there is a message in Noah's day there was a message it will rain and Moses day was a message applied a token in Daniels day there was a message in what about our day but the Branham said in a message recognizing your day and it's message of reason people in Noah's day did not go into the ark is because they never recognized the message nor the messenger that's the only reason they perish is because they didn't recognize the hour that they were living they didn't recognize that God would deal with sin as he promised he would he would destroy man from the face of the earth he had prophesied it and he meant it and he means it to be the same as he did then they didn't recognize the hour it recognized the day they didn't recognize the sign didn't recognize the message they didn't recognize the messenger but put him from there miss and laughed at him and Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah every Sunday we should be so desperate to be in the house of God we can't wait to come and worship we can't wait to come to the altar the sigh and cry for the abomination in the city because the angel is moving around looking to put a mark upon those who sigh and cry god help us to get our priorities right the focus and attention that people pay to their business or their job doesn't even come close to half of some of what we do for the kingdom of God with Israel in the land and everything setting now and the message is just perfectly moving in what idea are we living in brother way over yet they didn't know that they didn't know it that's the reason they missed it is because they didn't recognize it they were like today alot someone like the people to be blinded by scientific proofs by educational systems by geological seminaries and things that blinded them in that day it's done the same things today is blinding them again and also the simplicity of the message and the messenger Noah wasn't scientific he was an educated man he was a poor farmer humble with a simple message and it was too simple for the high living the same way the Prophet came with a message he had no education and it was simple and in those days the Pentecost has came and heard it and they walked away and people have come true the message through the ears have heard it and they have walked away not necessarily walk out the message but they walk into their own ideas their world interpretation they are all feeling their own perception their own interpretation and when the message is really one thing alive to bring us to a life a life of love what do I have all mysteries and do I know warm nor do I give my body to be burned and have not charity I am nothing and when the brennaman said if the churches today would only recognize if the churches who only recognize the Word of God that made this promise when it's our to the people they wouldn't perish and if ever burden this morning to see us recognize that not only the hour is late but we have something to do we have to live out something something on the inside must begin to express itself on the outside there must be no doubt in your mind or the world's mind if you are son or daughter of God the world shouldn't be wondering if you're a Christian let me say that again the world should not be wondering if you're a Christian if you want to be a Christian be a Christian if you do want to be a Christian that's your choice to but if you want to be a Christian do it 100% when a parent said quote don't make half way preacher with a preacher to be half way goal don't make half a Christian and a Christian could be half way but whatever you do do it 100% but the Brenham said if I want to be a bum if I want to be a garbageman be the best garbageman if I supposed to be a vagrant I want to be the best vagrant but whatever you do be the best I think you want to be a Christian young people be a real Christian a Christian in your conversation a Christian on your job a Christian at your home what are you speaking about as a consistency of character a consistency of behavior people must a blab so I never know he has go to church is he's gorgeous no I have been as I remember situation I say yeah daddy are you oh you know so so yeah he might say in your church another believer should have to defend your position you know he inches nobody struggling so yeah if they're trying to explain you know no we and we know we all have our ups and downs and right now he um if you want to be a Christian be a real Christian and the thing is people are passionate about what they want to be passionate about become passionate about this this is life I share didn't think about him some time ago God spoke to Noah he never spoke to Noah's children he never spoke to Noah's wife it was up to Noah to bring this out of his family it would have been had because they were the only ones listen it's easy for us here no because you could look at somebody next to you and say okay we are traveling on the right Road but if you're the only person in the building and I'm telling you you are the one and that's what God is saying you anyone by George forget everywhere that's right no you already would but lxs you anyone if nobody isn't on the island has to make it you have to be the one to make it that's how you're gonna see this thing because too much of us and that's why all these gangs and these groups exist go people want to be part of something and this ridiculous thing they want to call peer pressure so you know in work and say you have to do this and what what we had a one Supporter see young some young people saying we are the ones that would buy our life our testimony not to make people feel embarrassed or bad that's not the objective but as to show them that there are still Christians and I've never seen a situation where somebody would look to the Christian saw it and wasn't like wait I didn't even know it had people who still live like that you know that's what you hear people say because this role is a hard road this is the high road this is he had a choice and you should be so happy to know that you have the opportunity you know any people who have never heard the gospel they have never been to church and some of you here are so ungrateful because your parent Ellie you have to come you have to come you have to come and you even know the saving your life that they are making short that you are in the environment to hear something but everyone said no may have slammed the window down on his child hands because I wanted to get out and say what daddy my friends think the thing they my friends outside react move why I quote whack and cut it all didn't understand but what happened when the rains came the moment or in scheme they were in the act and then the emotion changed from being safe to realizing that their friends would never make it and that's the pain that's a greater burden in your soul because the rapture has come in judgment is coming and we have to do all we can do no no not tomorrow now have prayer meetings reach out to people telling you have to come to church you have to read your Bible forget the news forget the politics it's only gonna get worse and worse come the church say Amen [Music] but the Branham said the church has forgotten their prophets you don't need them anymore they kill him but God knows he's got to have them he hews his people by his word and and God sent a prophet to us we are so blessed to have a prophetic message that could point us to a way of escape without this there was no escape for us so this message is hope for families yes hope our lives can the church same that's a reason they're naked miserable blind Richard and don't know it because they don't recognize the hour that we're living in they don't notice it can the church seem Oh hallelujah what time is it brother but around I said what time is it minister do you see the time of the day and a sign you're living under can you understand it can you see it Oh hallelujah oh my this message is supposed to meet the challenge of the hour hallelujah Oh glory glory glory glory glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now the first seal to the fourth seal identifies how Satan infiltrated the church by the Antichrist spirit with the four riders white horse red horse black horse and the pale horse but while all this is happening God would not allow the church to be infiltrated like that without having somebody along the way so even though Satan caused havoc through the ages God still was always doing a work of redemption and he would have messengers connected to each of these phases and we know that God sent the lion ox man and a eagle because this great drama was being unfolded now we know I think we're talking now about our message when he opened the fifth seal is the work of redemption for the Jews the sixth seal we know is the judgment seal the seventh seal silence under the silence visible yet invisible the core that was once invisible was become invisible the car that was one silence beginning to speak which is Jesus Christ as seen yesterday today and forever under the Seventh Seal he had once again changed form for a great work of redemption and Satan is mad because he doesn't understand what's happening the devil can understand the natural and what's happening but the spiritual things once he doesn't see a sign he has no clue every other seal had a symbol the first the second the third the fourth the fifth or sixth but not the seven seals because the Seventh Seal is Christ the Lord Himself descended with a shout and could it be that what would come under that seventh seal would be a living symbol that is a connection with going back to Eve back to the spoken word each seal had a word had a history had an age and a vision other people can we talk about the message can we talk about our TN our message and what your promise is the first four seals represented the church ages the fifth seal is the Jews the sixth seal is a judgment Co time to tribulation but the seventh seal has its own age has its own people has its own message hidden on the silence and I accident is it time for this silence to be broken because it has to be broken because from under the Seventh Seal is a power that will restore all things a power that will bring forth a manifestation of every mystery that the Prophet came to tyre that had to wait until a different people were on the earth different from Abraham different from Paul different from Iranians differ from Elijah even different than the Prophet himself a people with a power that the world had never seen before oh come on now what are you talking about Richard Adam lost the book it was the book of redemption it was the book of authority it was the book of power because Adam had his book in his possession he could speak and the mountains moved it was because of his authority he could see him out to be moved and he knew it had to happen because he had the signet ring he had the role he had the anointed he had the power he had the authority when he signed the check it was as good as a father signing the check when the banks for the check didn't couldn't tell him his Adam sign or of course and become what he signed as when you see me as he Nevada it was a shame check the same signet when an authority came with his book and when Adam fell that book went back into the hands of the the original owner because that book had biometrics nobody could just open the book that book was not just for anybody to open the book whether Papa socarrat to wait until somebody came along we could open the book and that book in the hands of your original owner John wept because he was waiting in another realm to see who was worried to open the book and then went oh come on now I went the breathing body lamb step thought tore the seals of the book because without this book be it open because out this message this reveal world of Malachi 4 in its fullness we didn't stand a chance that's why we have hope that's why we're not a Pentecostal Church that's why we are not just believers but we are hidden secret agents from under the seventh seal that brought before there was time please us in this slot to manifest something that D without us should not be made perfect Oh so come on now David is rooting for you Elijah is rooting for you but the Planum is rooting for you think come on bride come to perfection come to adoption come to manifestation come to the Holy Ghost come to power take your place take your position take your authority hallelujah hallelujah that's what your family is waiting for not for book they are waiting for somebody to speak Oh hallelujah and when the Prophet was here give a demonstration he access I had you right what can I do for you what do you want God to do for you he didn't say give your two boys these books when she said I need my two boys say I give them unto you and those brothers were delivered the moment that word went out and that's what your children need is not two three books it's a spoken word power that when you speak this is not just a pastor speaking now this is when you speak you can say bread I need bread and bread has to come because you have the authority Adamic Authority the power and Adam lost that's your promise that's your message the same scientists same oneness that the Alpha Church had that's your message that's your promise but the premise that we haven't seen it yet but it's coming in the right season at the right time when we meet it when the press comes watch the Philip pretend when the enemy comes like a flood watch the Spirit of God raise up a standard Oh nature is waiting your family is waiting sickness is trembling because the master is about to step what once more not the way he did when he walk the earth not the way it was when the Prophet was here but the master will multiply himself in individuals in this last day and Jesus will walk the earth once more he'll walk Patrick Street he'll walk Meredith in walks iguanas he'll walk Sangha cranly it'll be Jesus on two feet just as he was with Peter just as he was in teams just as he was in John that's coming back Oh hallelujah hallelujah it will not be your effort it will not be your ability it will not be your Trent it will be by my spirit not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord hallelujah hallelujah give the Lord of soda fries that's your promise hallelujah [Applause] what are you saying but Isaac I'm not done yet so shake yourself we're warming up shake it up a little bit we're warming up we're getting ready for a war we getting ready for battle so let's do some push-ups this morning let's do some situps this morning let's do some jumping jacks this morning let's do something this morning because this mortal has got to put on immortality so you might as well get used to doing what you have not done before because you're about to do what you have not done before let's practice what's about to happen because when we get over there will just be shortened under hills of glory there'll be no sadness or there'll be no peeing over there let's bring the pain under subjection to what's supposed to happen let's tell the enemy what supposed to take place we are taking back our authority our position we are about to walk on every devil every demon hallelujah there's a power that's moving in the church now but the Branham saw it isn't it so close I could feel it it got him excited and we are here we are here we are on the brink but the Benjamin we are on the verge of the greatest manifestation of omnipotence that the world has ever seen and it's not your ability it's not your mistakes it's not because you're holy but it's by His grace no one not the headstone will come which hope is crying grace grace grace grace give the Lord a shout of praise give him a shout give him a shout of praise give him glory worship him give him Thanksgiving Oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] this must be the most important part of your life this is the most important part of your life this gospel is who you are this message is your message this is not listen this is not brother branham's message you know it's your message he was the messenger the message is for you [Music] let me see that again I'm gonna tell everybody got never to Georgie this is not brother branham's message this is God's message to you with a brand mr. messenger he's the one who brought the message God send somebody to tell you who you are what your name is what your authority is what your benefits are what he expects from you what you can expect from him this is the pronoun branham's message if your message it's a love letter from the groom to the bride that's what this is [Music] listen God call you he didn't want you to come to this gospel and not know what benefits come with this marriage Oh somebody help me or somebody help me this morning the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready God is about to get married to somebody with a college now listen you may be seated if you're gonna get married to somebody you even want to know what textbook see well when we get married we're gonna live I won't put these four sticks another tarpaulin and a little piece of chair here this is what and if that is what you want then fine perfect there's nothing wrong with that but you should at least know where George what do you want it at least know what you can expect give me why you're mad you know got a spurt so where where we gonna live how are we gonna eat yeah yeah you have a job probably I'm pretty light bill you never know because if it's not labeled we do we have enough candles not to go wrong with that but at least I need to know because if I sell enough for this permanent thing I need to have a permanent understanding of this might be how we started but it do have to be how we finish but let me know what to expect because if I'm making this commitment I want to know and what BSS because love conquers all candle light bill power gone guys love koala but at least let me know how much love I need to have to conquer it so God who is rich in grace and mercy waited all these years these centuries is generational I get married to a lady when he saw Adam and Eve he's a workhorse I love it he's a core of the family so when he saw that he looked for the tea when he could also say this is born of my born as his spirit of my spirit and the whole type of the message speaks of this bride coming into view this bride coming into her places bride getting to know who she is this bracket already but card rich and grace the mercy wanted this bride to be this beets raw because but the Branham said you were engaged when for those who may have forgotten it with a random said you were the wedding band of and B engagement ring was slipped on your finger before the foundation of the world so you were born and gift [Music] [Applause] and God is not breaking all this engagement because when he chose you he took its time and went through everybody and pick you and before you even bother make a mistake he slipped the ring on as his commitment because an engagement is a commitment it's a promise to marry at a date in the future when things are ready so when Jesus left the earth when he walked he said I go to prepare a place in my father's house are many mansions because a pride is has to come and live somewhere but brother branham brought all the type of the living bride and asleep in a bride so trod all the engine pause here to have bright there too and Martin Asian type right here too so in every age he always found out with the 7 love letter young we don't know what I'm taking anyone too much whatsapp too much face book telenovela love letter and he write the letter anyway two weeks later reach and you hoping you have two weeks so with me to come back you wait in the city reply to see if you find favor and take the time and crafty perfect would man get help hunting but short every age God send a messenger and that's why but the Branham said he didn't come to build a denomination he didn't come the bell of following because it was never about him it was about who sent the message so that's why the inspiration of my message this morning is return unto the Lord because it was the Lord sent a prophet messenger to give the message to his bride and once the bride receives the message it becomes her message because the message is addressed to you the message was not dressed to the Prophet the message with a dress to you he had a job to deliver the message as was given him by the father to deliver to the bride that's why the Prophet could not have injected his own thoughts into the message because he was not the source of the message and that's why the Ministry and the pastors and ministers have to say what the tip said because if you see anything else you are placing yourself in the hearts of the people and in the hearts of the people there's only room for the groom it's only room for the father somebody preached back to me [Music] [Applause] now for those of you maple remember it is 50 years ago when I get a love letter did you know people don't know but is virtually what is gross I could read any first paragraph I'm putting it on unless it has taken it induces but because they are matter time you're waiting for this thing it's not like email and text message it have too much things now where loves that come and you can't wait listen you rip the envelope every time find envelope without something loves to lick on you really want to see every envelope are on however you approaches that I love that super Jewish every word in a love letter has a sense of meaning and purpose and that's the sacredness we ought to have with this message we can take you know what I just lightly feel is far enough I got fairly second paragraph or fury to the paragraph no we have to take all because in this love letter is I promise you your family I promise I'll take care of you I promise our fee viewer promise I'll provide for you I promise I'll Helia this is the only love letter that can have causes like this I promise to Helia when I get sick when they get tired to lift you up when you cry or wipe your tears away somebody help me and as you come closer to the end of your love letter you say I've even better news for you because this life you're in is temporary there's a better place for you that I'm preparing for you where there will be no more crying there'll be no sign I kind of splinter in and fullest because you ain't understand it now but when you see it Daniel get it right boy again all up but it'll come a time when you'll never get old that's the beauty of this marriage no other love could do this for you come on now somebody please back to me that's the message [Applause] hopefully somebody gets this this morning so the mighty conqueror the Lord Himself because in our own human efforts we can never win the battle in all only malevolence so the Lord and septim mighty Conqueror hid himself as the word that's the message the revealed word every mystery revealed as a seventh under seven seal would cede message so that he could place himself in you please himself in the bride a secret mission and it was hidden under the Seventh Seal waiting for the right season the brannom said the notable angel the one with the shopback wings flew into him the mighty conqueror to reveal your redemptive rites so when the prophet said before the doctors hand touches my wife the tumor will go down that was not the Prophet that was the mighty Conqueror who had tabernacled himself in the Prophet when the Prophet says son come with an shine for days that was the mighty Conqueror at Tabernacle himself in the Prophet when he said let there be a squirrel that wasn't the Prophet that was the mighty Conqueror v-lin the Prophet when he said little fish I give you back your life that was on the Prophet that was the mighty Conqueror field in the Prophet since the haughty right they give you your two boys token would salvation that wasn't a profit that was the mighty conqueror feel in the profit and in this season God is once again looking for individuals not one man but many individuals to mail himself in a bride in the people that's your message 700 ival another Ephesians new name every mystery finished present-tense Redemption a new army rising up led by the mighty Conqueror with a fivefold ministry all with the baptism of the Holy Ghost all adopted all with a mighty Conqueror in them as his commanding officers leading a Bride of Christ with the mighty Conqueror building them but the Branham said has been churches churches Brides write churches rise rise but there must come one there has to come a real bride they must come one that's not only good mechanics but the dynamics of it makes a church live moving the power of his resurrection Oh [Applause] until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a fleas facelift or simonize job when there's no dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics proves me right he has got to be dynamics to make it work again that's my expectation looking for the power of God to strike the church to strike your souls to strike your home to strike your life [Applause] that is our message and we will recognize our team and recognize our message can we give the Lord a shout of praise Oh hallelujah Oh My yes a few more minutes Alleluia few more minutes in eternity time but the brand I'm in the rising of the Sun he said that's what Easter proved and he was an old leader would and that's why we have to make that leap friends from our intellectual understanding of the message - the message becoming a reality and a manifestation in our lives that is something that live it out when Jesus came across the sea into the land of the gadarenes the devil's took note automatically without a word being said of who he was because the life was pulsating the virtues were pulsated the power was pulsating hallelujah and that germ that life in you that seed in your soul has the virtues has the power has it because you have a germ of life on God so Indians everything in there not seen but we are here this morning to give you a balanced diet some food to feed that seed in this right atmosphere so that the sea will bring forth what is already in there that's why I said I will not leave you comfortless but I will send the comforter even a Spirit of Truth and he the Spirit of Truth will guide you you could only be guided because there's something in you that can be guided if there was nothing in you then the can the church say Amen hallelujah that's why I always say the purpose of the fivefold ministry has its limits because it's until we all come to the unity of the faith and after we come there then you are in perfect harmony not with the five whole minutes you won't be good that's the objective the objective is not the church the pastor the objective is to return unto the Lord want a relationship with establish there's no more need for pastors and teachers because you you have been connected to your husband once you are connected to your husband no man have no place and who God joined together let no man put that's the message bride and bridegroom husband and wife see in science team oneness seeing miracles that's the message see if this man can be moved don't doubt in your heart whatever you say is gonna happen your reason river you'll have to ask if it is walk on the water that's your message walking on water you need food the only up two scoops of rice and one scoop apiece keep on scooping that's your message that's the power but a pelham said when that time comes it will need me praying in Jesus name it'll be to command the devil to come out that's your message we haven't seen that yet but it's coming all we ever rapture coming we have a resurrection coming we have a wedding supper coming a holy city I'm new to Rosalind or you might as well get excited you might as well get excited young people get excited about this message it's your message it's your promise it's your message it's your reality it's a message of truth it's a message of life it's a message of power it's a message of adoption it's a message of perfection it's a message of revival it's a message of victory it's a message to show us how to go it's a message for our families it's a message for our children it's a message for our yiling it's a message that's vindicated it's a message that overcame it overcame in Paul's day it overcame an Iranian state it overcame and Martin Colombo Lutra Wesley the Pentecostals when the Prophet was here and this message could never fail it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday the same today and the same forever give the Lord a shot appraised [Applause] do you recognize your day do you recognize your message but the Branham said rapture and feet is laying in this message all you need to get raptured it's sitting on the books and the tapes someone's gonna pick it up but if Alan said one name the right word will be spoken the right thing will be sent for us to dash into the presence of God brother actually like having a service with a pterence when we say everything we don't stop bitching until we hit every promise until the right thing is said under the right thing is spoken you know we could dash into the presence of God Oh give him worship give him praise will make the devil uncomfortable will make being sin and sickness uncomfortable because in this atmosphere light and darkness kind of live in the same house oh we are going to have a revival we're gonna have a break troop we are gonna have a testimony that we overcame we're gonna have a testimony that we made it against all odds against all odds we made it but I knew your family is coming you better believe it you better claim it you better prophesy it you better declare it but as for your family is coming Oh hallelujah I don't care where your children are this morning this is our message this is our team this is our time this is our service this is our season now this message can never fail it can never fail impossible but this message to fail impossible for this message of Paul you may be seated no one the Prophet said he said when he Enzo come I check what the Angels said against the scriptures to make sure that what the angel was seeing was connected to the scripture so even the Prophet will understand this friends the Prophet put the angel on the question because he understood that he was just a messenger and the objective was to get the message to you so he had to make sure that whatever he transmitted the books and tapes have to be what you needed to hear that's why I can say I already told you how to make the rapture one day you're gonna see it I'm gonna send men who are gonna make more sense of it but I'm putting it in there because it's not for my time now but when you need to understand it the Spirit of Truth will Caillou - where's written and but the Branham said they will see what the messenger said how to spirit the Prophet and the bride will see the same thing and what they have said will have already been said in the wood so if I come to you with something new some some new way of putting it together you know this thing is not the way the Prophet said it and that the Providence did I don't want to get it because I want to get every word that the Prophet brought that came from my father came from my husband because I'm not taking chances I got to make the rapture [Applause] [Music] I'm not taking chances with my house I'm not taking chances with my children the devil and his eyes shift you like wheat Jesus told Peter that listen he has desire to shift you he has given you the notice of what the devil wants to do I'm gonna night she said but I prayed for you that ye being 50 didn't say it wouldn't be sifted Jesus could have said I prayed that you wouldn't be sifted he said I prayed that your feet feel not because trials will come situations will come problems will come but once you can hold on to your feet Buddha's skin won't destroy my body yet in my flesh I'll seek God I didn't even understand what he was saying but he was rolling altar feet oh come on down to a thousand four am i right ten thousand I shall not be moved if God doesn't deliver us we still a little power down because he's the only car we brought you hallelujah miss somebody go free this morning free from your past free from your mistakes free from every guilt and shame and sin and may you put all your past under the blood this morning because underneath the blood the devil could do you no harm know how Oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God redemption is laying in this message hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh catch a bird and Friends [Applause] that's why better Brenham said you didn't come to this this found you he said the message will fall into the hands of the predestinated it was not by your choosing it was not by your efforts it was not by your ability it was not by your study it was not by your meditation but God with destinated you for such a time as this he we destinated you for this our weary destinated you for this season he protects you to be here today you couldn't even mr. this service if you wanted to your whole life has brought you to this service on this day for you to recognize your day and recognize your message you may be seated and if you could catch a revelation of your message then you could do what the Prophet said time to say boo right back but the balancer when the devil comes and says stuff to you and say boo push ring back and take it and I said it many times my back pain it's not your back send it back the same way the message came to the Prophet for you it's your message it's not your back beam this one you can return to sender every time I back them come say that I Sentinel back to you and begin to speak positive begin to speak positive about your Christian walk begin to speak positive about your life begin to speak positive about what God will do and watch God act because your words are creative your words have power and that is what you are born to do if you shall see it to this mountain that's to tell you how powerful words are God said let there be and there was so not because your life is contrary doesn't mean you can speak for you it's qualit practice Mountain be moved straight Mountain D move Mountain be moved what did the Prophet say that that guy was selling the newspaper by Georgia extra extra read all about it he said that man didn't have heat for his even so after he prayed for him he came back in the prayer line and but I said I already prayed for you already healed if you already prayed for and already healed and it has not been physically manifested it's not to come back to get pray again the prayer is already going for that word carotenoid it's no longer on the prayer it's now on the feed side to transform the word of promise that has already been spoken into manifestation so I say to the parents in the church when your child's in trouble hand them over to the Lord pray for them commit them to the Lord and worship harder and you'll ever worship before and trust God to take care of the rest of it because they've already been prayed for and build your feet because as your feet build you can have feet beyond your circumstance to have feet activate yes situation also for somebody [Applause] give me a reference a man who was not even a Jew come to Jesus and say hey my servant is sick is it by making wood if you could come to my house I'm a man under Authority when I say to one come he comes when I say to one go he goes if you could just see the wood I have faith we have no evidence in Scripture of 87 even knew this was going on but he has a man who is standing with an understanding of authority and an understanding of it see I know if you speak as I would my servant shall be healed Jesus mine was blown in fact he commented I haven't seen faith like this inside of his room so when your feet begins to reach the muscular level ya young with the German thing I want to you know build muscle then feed my soul can even lift up a pencil but when your feets had to come to be muscular level that you could say I'd I would have a dolt in so much that when the Centurion reach home yes even ask if he was here he's at what time what time was he healed because this this Jesus is different and that's coming to you look at the Prophet before he ducked his hand he was in in the country before he thought his answer to my wife do you want go down I wonder what he prophets say when he came back or he made a phone call about what time so let us begin to exercise our faith and begin this because that's our message because seven thunders gives a better Brandon taught us that perfect fit not intellectual fit now but perfect fit is based on your it's based on your position' faith is based on forgiveness but perfect fit is peace and your position is authoritative it so as you step into your position in Christ or come on now as you step into your position your feet becomes positional feet or what is called perfect feet so you could speak when you are on your property but a kanga lean you are on your house and somebody comes into your house you can say get out of my house my authority is based on the fact that this is my house I don't care what you say if and it's more so in the US if you draw somebody out of your house physically that's on demeanor because it's your house now if you and somebody else host and you draw somebody out you have no ground sistent because it's not your house but if it's your house every most miserable sign management reserves your right to refuse admissions because they understand that this business is my business and I can allow in who I want to exclude who I don't want that's positional Authority because many of us in our Christian walk are not in position we dwell in his realm of intellectual feet which has its powers but a bad amoeba referred the dingy fate if we stay here we die if we go we die if we wear the odds of it is better let's go there that he says the lowest level of it nice feet just be some pure mental reasoning and I fellas when they cause I know it's noise common victory and that was it but I'm ever gonna dingy feet and then tails dingy fit in this intellectual fear because we had come by hearing and hearing it and and that activates something but there's something else when you get into your position your police in Christ because you know police in Christ and you could speak in your place when a father gets in his place as father as head of his home he is an authority and I said you feed that comes with that because that's a couple into position when a wife is in her place it's an authority enough feet for that position because that is how that's a reflection of the relationship between Christ in His Church so God honors the structure that exists once it's in line with his word but over it we don't spend enough time yeah I want to see some five or six or seven services the devil beat up the devil until all the doubts fears unbelief afterwards let us save it now what devil what whatever you talking about right Tammy waters finish your connect with Nadi backbend and go already we had it gone no pink one because sinners unbelief and faith comes by hearing and as you hear the word you receive the world you Amanda word all of us endeavor I cried a I have to let go yes because I want to go before you speak let me leave before he ready recognize he could speak because even speak he could send me anywhere let me go I choose me I want to go yes I do need ever say seventy picks in a place just a mess any place because Jesus was in his position never has plead for mercy and please 770 picks please because I didn't want you to set him somewhere else for a teacher feet and by the ground so ladies he said a moment the bride gets to know she is sit down Shelby Romo and that's what we are striving for to get a true revelation of who we are to get an understanding of who we are and how we can begin to walk in feet and demonstrate love and demonstrate forgiveness that's our message it's a life it's a testimony it's a live voice the musician Gary to come now when you recognize your day and your message then you can truly return unto the Lord we read in Scripture in Hosea return to the Lord remember he said that they would be scattered and they were but they'll return to the Lord after had they had been scattered Ezekiel saw the dry bones and he said can these bones live again now revived by the venom said doesn't mean resurrection he said I will revive as a measure of Iowa in the today he will revive us again after he scattered us so we are promised her revival Moses but a madam said he recognized his Dan is calling when he saw the promise of God's word for that they've indicated he knew them and realized what he was and what he was to do by the promise would and that's what we are looking for friends as Moses realized what he was and what he was to do by the woman he didn't fear what anybody said that's a prophets would he wasn't ashamed of his message though every priest and every fear Oh everything every authority disagreed with him but he recognized when he saw that light that pillar of fire hanging in that bush and spoke to him the wood that was promised for that day and said I've called you to do it he feared not the great threats of the King he went down to bring those people turn Exodus like the Word of God promised if the Jews only had recognized the promised sign of their Messiah according to their last prophet behold I send my messenger before my face and they claimed they were looking for him but it didn't recognize them what exactly are parallel till today they claim they are looking for something to happen the churches are all fasting and praying and now let us pray let us get together we've got to have an greeting happen he said we know there's something greater happened the church has got to get ready that's what they're praying about and I thought it was praying about there but he says you have to recognize it hallelujah they were looking for him by the bottom said and he was right there among them and friends he is here right now no need to look for him he is here he came to his prophet came to the world and his word is presented to you this morning with the words of the Prophet because we want to make sure and see it away the Prophet said it so it will not be an injection of man towards or ideas or coalition or trying to manipulate your mind be free to see plainly that this message is your message and it's a bring you to perfection to bring your family in to bring deliverance to you to give you hope to give you courage to give you confidence for you to be a conqueror in every area of your life we're gonna play something softly blessed be the name of the Lord the woman in the well recognize her but a sign of the Messiah she was in a bad shape she didn't want to fool with I'm all churches and to reveal to her the secret of a heart told her the sin that she was living him she said aye sir I perceive that your prophet now this is powerful friend because the Pharisees didn't recognize him the Sadducees didn't recognize him and a woman who the prophet said was living in a bad ship bad ship she was the one who recognized him the high priest didn't recognize him but the woman who had lived a messed-up life saw the word for the message of a day not just of her day but the message of every day because it was Jesus Christ Himself said I perceive that your prophet she had more revelation on the high priest he had more revelation and the pharisees and the sadducees and the e seams and the spiritual all of the day it had nothing to do with her spiritual condition it had to do all about that seed that was in her soul to see who Jesus was to recognize who she was and maybe there's somebody in here to be maybe you've been living all maybe wondering who you are and what you're supposed to do me this semester they give you a fresh vision of Calvary and of this message and who you are in God and may you fight for your portion like you have never done before let's all stand to our feet

distraction and create confusion but Lord - your grace your love and mercy you have found us we didn't find you Lord you found us in our broken conditions in our desperate conditions in our weak
