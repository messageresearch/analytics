and you know Church it's so easy to rip the message and try to understand what God accomplished in for the brand it's so easy it's so easy to preach all your messages over the Brahma it's so easy but what is difficult is to take the promises that the prophet legend because God called you to finding kids with a Branham that's right and that was the third Pope because of this thoughtful misdoings

of faith when we all get to Ephesians because the thesis holds one thing it's also a lot it's all one baptism and the Trinity doctrine or Cadiz years has been rather separate out make it three course making twice inferior to the father but it was one faith God the Father God the Son God the Holy Ghost and a patch of that faith that faith is not completely though you somebody should say image of this so we are going back to the unity of the faith because of faith us to be united to become one that was like a revelation but the Branham for the phone for other people's fault so proven that you can break apart into three it has to be the same God all the time because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday is the same today mr. self forever he doesn't change hallelujah praise God a man somebody

tonight that's the peaceful message met somebody shout hallelujah that is what I'm contending for nothing less [Applause] I am NOT way to represent a god that cannot heal the sick when that's in God on the black patch of his mind that process it takes up to become a savior to become a healer to become a god that's the goal of regime and God let's place a place or to heal the sick so raise the tail praise God hallelujah hello here that's the gutter question for tonight I'm a paint God God come find some people in South Africa that know Scott Rosson changer God Alyssa God Steve Blass or somebody shout hallelujah tonight brother on that's wheelchair I want to stimulate your faith tonight believe this is your last night to with that stuff because God is not dead the god you serve is not an recycles train chokers unbelled side [Applause] you've got to know what you should be contending for it's a fight of faith but help us this morning he showed us fire gods by the message once we should be contending and to containments to fight you can't get it easy you've got to fight interpretations [Music] [Applause] you've got to fight ideas suppose it's a fight of life but it's a good fight because she would lose in these fights every man has fight this fight is a winner and tonight repent you'll be a winner hallelujah thank you with a fear of it what is falling that was our second message hallelujah that was a second hallelujah I thank you for the sigma-i brother Westco I mean how to leave my room sit back there just to hear this veteran speak these are men who just don't speak with words that's why I have a close association for the signal there's a life as tears which is what is lacking today the message experience you can't be God than experience I don't believe God changes what God did you meet nobody on the face of the earth has ever made discord and with the sea I pray that we meet got that go tonight I'm going to be like check up I went to wrestle two nights or till I leave this convention change hallelujah glory the cordovan sews country of its quickly let's with the scriptures of course I have a title about just to come behind my brothers is a sin to try to see the message I'm just going on they have some things you already have the title symbol is contending for the faith to be able to contend for that faith the most compact my subject you'll reach enough it was fought back as Christ in you the hope of glory and that is being done by a free food revelation of Jesus Christ so until the believed accomplished what the full foundation of this original faith because this faith is never complete without you part of this way so let's turn to the usual scriptures the book of Jude or join for that photo to give us picture to you Jude 1:3 I think body to theory that this morning also beloved when I gave all the legions to write it to you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write it to you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints out if you wait to believe God hallelujah amen let me just done quickly to a revelation of the wine what your things you've had that spit from the angle the revelation of Jesus Christ since revelation 1:1 just objectivity kindness revelation of Jesus Christ with God given to him and then the village of Jesus Christ is the original faith actually but the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him so this faith was given to Jesus Christ himself which God gave unto him to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and is sent and signified it by his angel are going to be servant John hope you have record of the word of God and of the testimony is quite a sum of all the things that he saw and God is showing you here our Bishop comes down chattels but is moved on to John and John chapter bright forth from Elohim down to the gods that the eight has simplified it then it came down to John sublime praise God would be a record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all the things that you saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are waiting they are waiting for the time is God blesses what tonight you may be seen it about opposite all the specials South Africa is really talented honestly speaking I mean I told father for the Robledo that this this this these young people I mean they are loaded with talent your voice is so blind is that mention you can really see let's clap for the choristers and for those ones that get the kitchen I am so pleased and thank you brother of the South African songs it's always good to be so optical maybe it's a nice place to be hallelujah no we will call them and have a look first tonight are ready to fight for the faith that's a good enough why did you come to these meetings how can you go back the way you came how many of us are ready to contend for the faith tonight this can't be a theory we have got to apply the conviction the touch of blade of light because of ten of us go back by Malachi 4 but we have a responsibility to contain for what he had to be seated praise God hallelujah because both the messenger had a message we are all signs of restoration so you can't understand the faith or till you see the way it operates over the RAM but until shows it is morning a dispensation and age of adoption supernatural service called the Holy Spirit's the angel operated in the mail so for the run of big chocolate spirit just after Pentecost he was laying the foundation there was a fourth light manifestation upon with the touch of his nature his billet the fourth line manifestation the fault line world just after Pentecost from 2006 to 94 the Sikhs the Pentecostal it was George finish then talk to the Prophet is when you age which is your age the age of the manifestation of true sons of God with a syllable India soul but also there was the last foundation for the building because God could not build the monument the masterpiece he could not build this mansion of a perfect man on a bunch of nonsense they cannot build this project man on Rafael on Wesley on Pentecost is got to find a perfect foundation to play this match off of a perfect man so he brought the last manifestation the fourth light manifestation the fourth line word of the 19th for the six [Music] super the bottle said all this I'm only building and all this background here well but from that time has only been laying a foundation a big shots message no set the whole nation hallelujah so we have to bring back the fourth part of the foundation which is just perfection the capstone God and God was calling elect Pentecostals to mix up this foundation to make up this capstone so God has a foundation of perfection to feel opposites man for the resurrection raised or so to get the Prophet imperfection they can guess anything God have to give the Prophet not just a link but they give you the mercy of the Holy Ghost a man of God's presence that might become the guide the spigot of truth a that was to lead the prophets to all truth praise God amen because this is the last age this text are not allowed it has got to be perfection so this angel not a feeling not sensation he was a boss in that will speak to the prophets is no Pentecostal insane Pentecostal by the sensations of the Holy Ghost and those sensations not some magic of error so God took the profit not the Holy Ghost mess of sensation but of crossing a man an angelic being to guide the Prophet that became the kinda hallelujah praise God symbolically for was Aida he was he was the Holy Ghost is leading some big mistakes that sensational because but he will be on since we went to the post office louia praise God there was the mystery at the Holocaust not easy without sensation for the process of the Holocaust oh you believe that sir imagine us it's not straight is the message so for the brand of my mix of this angel have to restore the faith the first pull was backed by science of healing the live ones what you see the hidden mist you behind the possible forgiveness you see because science of God's forgiveness your I should cut bait we see without spilling with the consequence of C so this forgiveness they're talking about is not to sit forgive your brother is an order he coming here and applying the blouse hallelujah because it is his forgiveness it is His Highness that computer choppers will choose a lawyer that can take your dream away because these are all the consequences of seen clever Burnham said you can't deal would see with how stealing goodness is a completion fee [Applause] because the challenge to faith is si si unfaithful exist that is why once a believer gets born again they say because it was seen that cause before it even and you don't see see what you see is the attributes of same considered surface unbelief so when God handles welcome deeds which see big deals with the attributes and how do you know his death which C is when you see God deals with the attributes of C or let somebody shout hallelujah praise God even those of us softly which seen tonight God shall give you an experience the who delivered seen and with the attributes of ceará hallelujah the publication is the adultery will stop the filthiness will stop all this foolishness will start to become a Christian say job or shall turn a lawyer tonight and that is my vision tonight before [Applause] that's the truth you see Jesus God forgive me you're seen by a prize the Prophet explains that to you about the cross that was a defense that happened but how do you get yourself connected how do you become a beneficial of what Christ did it a price of redemption is paid but the price is not enough there has to be a walk of redemption to cook like a price a surprise is baited thing that is why Jesus Christ in John started heroes back and came back did he come back to that a second time he kept a little a lot of the attention praise God hallelujah is great to do a walk tonight from beautiful Trump extra beta from place to place a rock of the dead shop the price cannot do that alone in what has to be done it was it was of the resurrection that is why came back so for several Church ages it has been a walk God working in the church to bring you back and that's what can I just take many tell a second you need to have an experience with Jesus an experience with the Holocaust an experience with the blood of Jesus the blood is applied for you but the Holocaust has to come I said talking as a sign that's tonight that somebody will live this convention tonight with an experience with God by way of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to make you a living reality of this message hallelujah then your life is such a key to this message your life is a testimony and the testimony is not your testimony is a testimony of the Holy Ghost inside of you hallelujah Jesus evil will produce the results somebody shout hallelujah God is not that is alive is here tonight hallelujah he loves you so much [Applause] that's why it's called panel man a Bible says his enemy check his car it's never subject to the will of God so those who work in busy Mundus declare or walk by the dictate of the human spirit can never please God because the please God you please God by faith but faith is an element this is a time make sure you've got to come out of the humanistic way and convert to the wrath of divine revelation then in as rain you can police cars and it tested all the best baptism to raise you up from the hip on Instagram which are the RAM of divine revelation oh praise God hallelujah the Holocaust let's with you then you recognize that even though you have a demon spirit but you also have another stated with you that's the Holy Spirit then God can always speak to you not to the human spirit but for the Holy Spirit or can somebody shout hallelujah somebody shout hallelujah without the Holy Spirit it's difficult from God [Applause] and because he must be with the hearing whether human speedy has the voice of God it's perfect it doesn't let you get it as God sees it it's adults lately that you need and make it ineffective in your life but if the Holy Ghost is there the only best fix what God says and magnifies you to the others so we brought the Holy Ghost you got to be a real believer so tonight's religious conviction as a real people are walking in the light of the world not just a church member taking books and tapes but a real believer because that is the beginning of the restoration of the faith we know already they restore back the faith of the Apostles by way of a divine love if it the thunders because they don't have the TARDIS back there the tallest was a backside mystery that was kept only for this day because we need the standards to change the body so did Alfred church they have the articles the ad science and wonders but as they don't get this numbers because those founders will seal on the back side hallelujah praise God and government predestination other messenger so be with them Ponder's at the end of the seventh judge agency also buddy such hallelujah that is right in this message windows only half when the Alfa Josh had we must have that plus seven point six because in the seventh Isis is your name revealed in the seventh Isis is the change of your body under the seven points this is the change of the evil spirits under the seven point six research transformation all of those voices to become just like Jesus so by the time you go to the seventh seal you go through the seven points s several Ponder's you come back like this man will come back to how you where before you fell this is your is the condition somebody shout hallelujah this was our you we're on the back part of the spine that's when I'm so excited and as the minister that's dopey shop there's no man that can take me away from this reality praise God this is we did to me this was what I was on the back page of the spine I was the stature of a budget man [Applause] [Music] this is my this is my to you by way of promises if I says by this promises you can take us all to define nature [Applause] listen tonight what do you become if you ever partake of God's divine nature this is just more than the problems in Ewing or good house this is God promising you his nature and his nature this is me now this lecture this is glory is that so this is very essence and now we thank God we've talked to the finishing of the seventh seal genomic honest knowledge nature how we live this this imagine God give you a promise to partake not promising you a child or money but the promise to you is to partake of His divine nature what does that make you will choose we can bet you on a match Oh God [Applause] God's all shitless nature this inside of you lord have mercy praise God I'm so excited tonight brother so you see this is original fee but the problem went to show you this faith revelation [Applause] but God says perfect to go beyond central one one before it was a ward it was thoughts then he said those talks we are eternal attributes there was God connecting ghosts part to his mixture [Applause] they say God is not like me you we say works with good intentions but we don't have a niche [Applause] so our words become idle works but when goes Biggs award because his words are produced by a sinless nature it has an extra tooth back atop the beginning this this one here what mysteries and 3/4 Papa's is only one purpose the purpose is revelation [Music] they were too easily limbs up among human penis say the camp son of man not made flesh that gives him pleasure they want to reveal himself in you so to blow that the net saw that it gets the preeminent Sydney you what the preeminence is all about revealing they want em self to be city do we want people to see him anymore that is what she walks we want to be glorified and not sickness they want to be glorified [Applause] let me see never have to pray for myself I said kill somebody it is not about my glory it's about your goal because it was through the pump it's a sickness because you want to be believed you allow us to be lost because we're to repeat yourself to also save you you see that is the faith that pleases God and the treasure believers pounds and with the kid to play God heal the people give them the Holy Ghost deliver them I'm telling you your faith is bliss in God's name minister comes again signs and wonders your faith these places for Thought hallelujah [Applause] [Music] so if you let us make man in our image after our likeness was the perfection but it was the same cause 20 unfold himself trying to reveal himself as a pillow fire of the glove cloud than as a man that the mystery finish then all that he was all his essence all his glory all these attributes his bodies into the Nagas all this nature all these attributes imparted into the nervous Jesus Christ's and not to stop there it took all the attributes that was Interlagos father into this image let us make man in our image after our likeness and let him out to meet him Elohim locust whole spirit its original tree that God the Holy Spirit this man is made in His image and his likeness call them underwater image there was the part of himself so Adam was not just a son of the Sun it was also a son from heaven he has a bow in heaven mum said God took disabilities because of spirits man bless the spirit Adam flesh she became a supernatural son not an ordinary son [Applause] hallelujah and he was given a commission by that spirit because the Commission to multiply replenish the earth was not given to Adam flash bang it was given to his holy spirits the battery was of course mine hallelujah praise God man hallelujah you've got to know who you are to reserve the Holy Ghost that's well not to succeed you are seen of God's eye because he's regarded a supernatural the LOA [Applause] Ramazan messages said it was a white cloud man and sink him and mad that man the holy person comes out of that man [Music] because the Holy Ghost is so easy to get oh it's a subconscious of fear because you see it down here we have so much doubt and all the doubt is because you are you don't know God loves you don't believe he cares for you you don't believe your back to me that he is not pleased without you [Music] once it is done the subconscious believe because the truth is the B device not you the believer is the word in you so all you do is lift up your hands and [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] regular human they when faith becomes divine it's different but is that the Chinese ticket you've got to have something to eat something that is racist a comment it is a yummy the world is if I mean by the vigor is a control with you here the Ripper word by the words you've got to have something to receive [Applause] you can't resist awards that suit us out in you I say it again you can't resist the world that you don't have in your soul no to the Holocaust in you is the word of God in you that identifies itself by accepting that was so is the word Amy you accept the word there so if you have the one in you for healing you can receive healing if you have the one in you for the Holocaust baptism you can be baptized with the Holy Ghost because you can check it god bless all contents or maybe you two tickets [Applause] I went with Pentecostal church without even his message

so we ask in the safety the angel of God to go with them as brother premises when we climb in our cars the Angels must climb with us and be the guide so just pray for the one that you align your hands on and we can also brother James just to close out him pray loving heavenly father you are the divine architect there's no one can design life the way you do there's no one can lead the way you do there's no one father can fulfill his promises the way you do and in this last age you have to introduce yourself to this age as the Amen and the Prophet says Amen stands for finality it stands for prevailing promise it stands for the seal of God and we believe you reveal yourself in that attributes in this meeting fine the Prophet says to us Jesus introduces himself this way because the way he wants who of the way he wants awake in this age we have heard how in this age not mistakes are allowed because this is the final age this is the age of the capstone and so father we have seen the demonstration of your attributes in this meeting your children are going back with the testimony that you are alive and that you are true and that you keep your word that you are the same yesterday today and forever so that what you're promised they can depend on it they can bet on it father to know that you are unfailing yes Lord many seeds have been sown through the meetings many promises father and your children's faith has been raised up and father there's no time where the word has been preached and the people believe and nothing follow it we are believing that correct things are already happening we are believing as well that the angel of God will go through the neighborhood and confirm his words we're believing father that this world is going to come to pass so that your name may be glorified now Lord Jesus your children are ready to depart going to different places would pray that the same angel of God who watched over them and brought them this far will be faithful enough to take them back home again father you say that God and I change not when I start awake I make an end of it or God may you bless your people with a blessing father special blessing for the end of 2018 may they see you being the reality of everything they've ever believed one may become so real to them as they think about these messages as they think about the the songs and the quotations but those things that they believe become their reality father may you watch over every person who trouble tonight there that will travel tomorrow but you watch between us as we parted from each other may you be a wall of fire about us father thank you Father thank you for the minister of angels law angels ministering to your people same ones that came to Peter in the prison the same one Lord that minister to the different ones even Paul may they go with your people father may you bring them safe back to their churches and their families may you bless father their desires now you meet every need Lord we thank you Lord we bless your wonderful name pray for brother Raymond in the church all the workers every whet that has gone into it these silent ones the ones behind the scenes the

done for your bride you always pay back with interest bless them Lord we thank you we bless you tonight yes Lord and all those things father maybe that we forgot to do or maybe did to the right way with us or God that you forgive our ignorance Lord Jesus sin may you give us grace to do things better may you put your final seal on this meeting father by bringing to pass every desire of your
