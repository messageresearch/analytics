[33:14] praise the name of the lord
[33:16] it's good to be here
[33:18] so from
[33:19] 2nd peter chapter 3 verse 1.
[33:22] this second epistle beloved i now write
[33:25] unto you and both which i stir up your
[33:27] pure minds by way of remembrance
[33:30] that you may be mindful of the words
[33:31] which were spoken before by the holy
[33:33] prophets and of the commandments of us
[33:36] the apostles of the lord
[33:38] and savior knowing this first
[33:40] that they shall come in the last days
[33:42] scuffers
[33:43] walking after their own lust and saying
[33:45] where is the promise of his coming for
[33:48] since the fathers fell asleep all things
[33:49] continue as they were from the beginning
[33:51] of the creation
[33:52] for this they willingly are ignorant of
[33:55] that by the word of god the heavens were
[33:57] of old and the earth standing out of the
[33:59] water and in the water
[34:02] whereby the world that then was being
[34:04] overflowed with water perished
[34:07] but the heavens and the earth which are
[34:09] now by the same word are kept in store
[34:12] reserve unto fire against the day of
[34:14] judgment and perdition of ungodly men
[34:17] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[34:20] thing
[34:21] that one day is with the lord as a
[34:23] thousand years some thousand years is
[34:25] one day the lord
[34:27] is not slack
[34:28] concerning his promise
[34:30] as some men can't slackness
[34:33] but is long-suffering to us what not
[34:35] willing that then he should perish but
[34:37] that all should come to repentance
[34:39] but the day of the lord will come as a
[34:40] thief in the night in which the heavens
[34:43] shall pass away with a great noise and
[34:45] the element shall melt with filth and
[34:46] heat the earth also on the works that
[34:49] are therein shall be built up seeing
[34:52] them
[34:52] that all these things shall be dissolved
[34:55] what manner of persons ought to be
[34:58] in all holy conversation and godliness
[35:00] and that holy conversation is not talk
[35:02] it's holy living
[35:04] holy behavior and godliness
[35:07] looking for and hasting unto the coming
[35:10] of the day of god
[35:11] wherein the heavens being on fire shall
[35:14] be dissolved and the elements shall melt
[35:16] with fervent heat nevertheless
[35:18] we according to his promise
[35:21] look for new heaven and a new earth
[35:23] wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore
[35:25] beloved seeing that he look for such
[35:28] things be diligent that he may be found
[35:31] in him in peace
[35:33] without spot and blameless
[35:36] an account that the long-suffering of
[35:38] our lord is salvation even as our
[35:40] beloved brother paul
[35:42] also according to the wisdom given unto
[35:44] him had written unto you
[35:46] and also in all his epistles speaking in
[35:48] them of these things and which are some
[35:51] things had to be understood which day
[35:53] that are unlearned and unstable rest as
[35:57] they do also the other scriptures
[36:00] unto their own destruction
[36:02] ye therefore beloved seen you know these
[36:04] things before
[36:06] beware
[36:07] least he also been led away with the
[36:10] error of the wicked
[36:12] fall
[36:13] from your own steadfastness but grow in
[36:16] grace
[36:17] and the knowledge of our lord and savior
[36:19] jesus christ to him be glory but now and
[36:22] forever amen
[36:24] and from
[36:25] first john 5 whosoever believe it that
[36:28] jesus the christ is born of god and
[36:30] everyone that loved him that begot loved
[36:33] him also that is begotten of him
[36:35] and by this we know that we love the
[36:37] children of god when we love god and
[36:39] keep his commandments and this is the
[36:41] love of god that we keep his
[36:43] commandments and his commandments and
[36:44] not grievous
[36:46] for whatsoever is born of god overcometh
[36:48] the world
[36:49] and this is a victory that overcometh
[36:51] the world even our fate
[36:53] who is he that overcome in the world but
[36:55] he that believeth that jesus is the son
[36:57] of god
[36:58] this is he that came by water
[37:01] and
[37:02] blood even jesus christ not by water
[37:05] only but by water and blood and it is
[37:08] the spirit
[37:09] that they are at witness because the
[37:12] spirit
[37:13] is truth
[37:14] for they are treated be recorded in
[37:16] heaven the father
[37:18] the word
[37:19] and the holy ghost these trees are one
[37:21] and there are three that bear witness in
[37:23] it the spirit the water and the blood
[37:27] and these three agree and one may god
[37:29] had a blessing to his word you may be
[37:30] seated oh praise the lord of a title
[37:33] tonight
[37:34] just three words water
[37:37] blood
[37:38] spirit
[37:39] that's the title tonight just three
[37:41] words water
[37:43] blood
[37:44] spirit
[37:45] and the prophet here in birth pains he
[37:46] said the church had boot pains under
[37:48] looter and we know there are seven
[37:50] churches and seven messengers to them
[37:52] church ages according to revelation and
[37:55] when luther come forth it certainly
[37:56] threw the church into breed pains

[38:00] and brought forth wesley and after that
[38:02] he bought for pentecost each of their
[38:04] messenger rock the age back to the word
[38:07] the message of the age the message
[38:09] according to the bible he says now watch
[38:12] and the four chapters of revelation read
[38:13] it he said it proves being a shadow of a
[38:16] doubt that looter's message was
[38:17] justification
[38:19] what signification is the next process
[38:21] is the natural birth and then come the
[38:23] pentecostal
[38:24] notice each age rock the church and give
[38:26] it blue pains
[38:28] but what did they do
[38:30] after the blood pains come
[38:33] instead of going on with the word they
[38:34] got a bunch of men together just like
[38:36] the one the first one did it's exactly
[38:38] right after the rocking of the apostles
[38:42] then we finally going off again each age
[38:44] has rocked every time a messenger come
[38:46] forth with thus saith the lord it rocked
[38:48] the church age isn't that right now we
[38:51] know worse age now laodicea rich and
[38:53] blinded and so on now her messenger
[38:56] is promised in malachi the fourth
[38:58] chapter he promised to do it and the
[39:01] message is to bring back the word bring
[39:04] the people back to the word a bird is to
[39:08] be
[39:10] she is to be delivered of a new birth
[39:12] according to malachi 4.
[39:14] according to what
[39:16] according to malachi 4 this bride church
[39:19] is supposed to be delivered of a new
[39:20] birth not the pentecost
[39:22] according to malachi 4.
[39:24] hallelujah oh glory to god water seven
[39:28] seals that break hallelujah the blood

[39:38] speaking condition with god the blood is
[39:40] what hangs over you that you could
[39:41] communicate to god outside the blood you
[39:43] can't talk outside of blood you can't
[39:45] access the throne oh glory to god the
[39:48] blood make it possible so you have to
[39:49] communication with god because when he

[39:53] the blood oh glory to god you're ready
[39:56] yet yeah right as you ought to be yet

[40:17] so god see through the blood to your
[40:19] sanctified life that you're called into
[40:22] this thing isn't that right and then the
[40:24] next level now praise god hallelujah oh
[40:27] glory to god brotherly kindness
[40:30] hallelujah praise god and holy decency
[40:33] then place in christ isn't that
[40:34] something

[40:37] brotherly kindness the blood for the age
[40:40] oh displayed upon the bride's chest
[40:43] we have to be able to manifest but
[40:44] kindness that's in the spirit realm now
[40:47] broadly kindness blood given the fear to
[40:49] access holy spirit virtue powerful

[40:53] next step what is charity adoption
[40:55] dynamics placing oh hallelujah what is
[40:59] it blood hallelujah water blood spirit
[41:02] oh blessed be the name of the lord then
[41:05] he said here now when that light struck
[41:07] little rebecca she knew something within
[41:08] her that brought her to isaac she wanted
[41:11] no more to do with her own thinking
[41:12] isaac was a thinking from then on and
[41:15] the church itself when it strikes
[41:17] prophecy the power of god the baptism of
[41:21] the holy ghost out of denominational
[41:24] churches
[41:25] out of the catholic church wherever it
[41:28] is when that baptism of the holy ghost
[41:32] is made real to the people them that are
[41:34] predestinated like you people here to
[41:36] eat in like season walk in it what is it
[41:38] super sign
[41:39] so it's a prophecy he's not talking
[41:41] about pentecostal baptists speaking in
[41:43] tongues he's not talking about this holy
[41:45] ghost and charismatics he's not talking
[41:46] about that kind of stuff he's talking
[41:48] about outside of that when the power of
[41:50] god strike oh glory to god hallelujah
[41:53] praise god we believe it people are
[41:55] going to see it who's going to see it
[41:56] the predestinated everybody can see it
[41:59] everybody cool and in essence they don't
[42:01] want to see it oh glory to god
[42:03] hallelujah
[42:05] now notice
[42:06] recognize the call of god's word which
[42:08] he's part of
[42:09] eager to eager call if that mother would
[42:11] have screamed like a buzzard he would
[42:12] have known isn't that right but it was
[42:15] the scream of the eagle talking about
[42:17] the eagle in the barnyard heard the
[42:19] mother scream and responded to it isn't
[42:21] that right and the same thing is with
[42:24] every believer
[42:25] when the preaching of god's word come
[42:27] forth and is vindicated
[42:30] and proved that it is god's word for
[42:33] this hour then there is something within
[42:35] the believer i don't care how loyal his
[42:38] father was to the church how loyal his
[42:40] mother was or his grandparents if that
[42:43] church is teaching contrary to this hour
[42:47] of the baptism of the holy ghost message
[42:49] there is something in him that screams
[42:51] out he would leave the banyan
[42:53] he's got to do it oh glory to god you
[42:56] hear what the prophet said if that
[42:58] church is teaching the contrary
[43:01] to this hour
[43:02] of the baptism of the holy ghost message
[43:04] there is something in him
[43:06] that screams he will leave the barnyard
[43:09] he's got to do it
[43:10] the chicken might have been all right
[43:12] one day but this is the eagle hour it is
[43:14] different there is something that he
[43:16] must leave the old coop and fly away
[43:19] into the blue then this earthly body is
[43:21] quickened and brought by the quickening
[43:23] spirit
[43:24] to the obedience of god's word
[43:27] oh my
[43:28] now when this holy spirit
[43:31] represented as the eagle flying over the
[43:33] land and finds the believer no man could
[43:36] come except the father who told me is
[43:39] that right it's the father drawing now
[43:41] the holy spirit is here on earth looking
[43:45] out for those individuals

[44:33] sign of circumcision a seal of the
[44:35] righteousness that his faith was
[44:37] accepted or give the lord some glory
[44:39] hallelujah or god sent a message to

[44:52] things are possible

[47:24] hallelujah not in some man not in some
[47:26] system but on the word of god oh
[47:29] hallelujah so there is the holy spirit
[47:32] that coming down to quicken and make a
[47:34] life those people that's for ordained of

[47:44] if he's a true eagle
[47:46] oh glory to god if you're a true eager
[47:48] must understand he misses here
[47:50] oh hallelujah thank you lord there are
[47:53] three debate record in heaven
[47:57] the element that come from jesus body
[47:59] when he died
[48:01] there was water
[48:03] there was blood
[48:04] and spirit and these three things make
[48:08] up the new bird
[48:10] oh god somebody say amen tonight what
[48:13] came from jesus water
[48:14] blood
[48:15] and spirit
[48:17] and these things three things make up
[48:19] the new birth
[48:20] is that right ministers
[48:22] these three elements
[48:24] make up the new birth water
[48:26] blood
[48:27] and spirit
[48:29] that make up the natural birth when a
[48:31] baby is born the first thing happen is
[48:33] water blood life all the natural things
[48:37] type the spiritual
[48:38] now in first john 5 7 i believe
[48:41] there are tree that bear record in
[48:43] heaven the father
[48:45] the word
[48:46] and the holy ghost these three are one
[48:49] and there are three that they're
[48:51] recording earth
[48:52] that's water
[48:54] blood spirit and they agree in one now
[48:56] notice the first three are one
[48:58] the second three are earthly which are
[49:00] green one you cannot have the father
[49:03] without the sun you cannot have the sun
[49:05] without having the holy ghost but you
[49:07] can have the water without the blood
[49:09] and you can have the blood without the
[49:10] spirit
[49:13] i might say that again
[49:15] you could have the water without the
[49:17] blood
[49:18] you could have the blood without the
[49:19] spirit
[49:20] you can be sanctified without being
[49:22] justified and you can be justified
[49:24] without being sanctified you can be
[49:27] sanctified without receiving the holy
[49:28] ghost that's exactly
[49:31] i'm still reading
[49:33] not my thoughts
[49:34] the disciples in john 17 17 were
[49:36] sanctified
[49:38] given power to cast out devils and still
[49:41] didn't have the holy ghost
[49:43] and they had anointed ministry alongside
[49:46] jesus you can't say they don't know
[49:48] jesus they had they had the i mean they
[49:50] was in his inner circle
[49:53] with all the holy ghost there was
[49:54] preaching with all the holy ghost there
[49:57] was gaston out there without the holy
[49:59] ghost
[50:03] that shaken isn't it
[50:05] mighty ministry
[50:07] without
[50:09] the holy ghost
[50:12] sure they had to go to pentecost and
[50:15] wait till the holy ghost come
[50:19] that's where judah showed his color see
[50:21] how that spirit worked its way through
[50:23] justification sanification but when it
[50:26] come to the end he showed his colors
[50:29] when he come to the third step or the
[50:31] third phase or this third link
[50:34] oh glory to god hallelujah he showed his
[50:37] colors so you can't stop short
[50:40] it's three things
[50:42] it's water not water only it's blood is
[50:44] that blood only it's spirit also
[50:47] oh glory to god do you love him tonight
[50:50] look
[50:51] when a woman is in travail forbid the
[50:53] first thing comes to pass the breaking
[50:54] of water normal bit second thing is the
[50:57] blood and then comes life
[50:59] water
[51:00] blood spirit that constitutes the normal
[51:03] natural birth so it is in the spiritual
[51:06] realm it is water justification by faith
[51:09] believing on god believe him as your
[51:11] personal savior being baptized second is
[51:14] sanctification of the spirit that god
[51:16] cleanses the spirit from all the
[51:18] elements of the world and the desire of
[51:21] the world and then the holy spirit comes
[51:23] in and gives new birth and fills up that
[51:26] sanctifying vessel and when you speak
[51:29] about
[51:30] the glass layer in the chicken yard you
[51:32] don't pick it up and just put it on your
[51:33] table and fill it with water or milk no
[51:35] by picking it up its justification
[51:38] cleanses its simplification because the
[51:40] greek work signifies a compound word
[51:42] means cleanse and set aside not in
[51:45] service but for service but when you
[51:48] fill it it puts us in service so all
[51:50] this labouring and and
[51:53] travailing and and pressing is to get
[51:55] you into the position to be in service
[51:58] now real service for this age and for
[52:00] this hour is charity
[52:03] that is to put you in service we can't
[52:05] go back to 1906 which is a pentecostal
[52:07] birth spirit we have to go back to we
[52:09] had to come back to the spirit of
[52:10] adoption so it's really charity to
[52:13] empower the bride because the
[52:15] pentecostal did not have the person even
[52:18] though they had the spirit
[52:21] because the person came in by the word
[52:23] and the word came to the prophet and
[52:25] they reject the prophet that they
[52:26] couldn't get the person of christ to add
[52:28] faith and virtue and knowledge and
[52:30] temperance and patience and godliness
[52:31] because that comes by the word
[52:34] oh glory to god give the lord a shout
[52:36] if the pentecostal could have received
[52:38] the word then they were the rapture
[52:40] would have gone already
[52:41] because they was going to add those life
[52:43] and then connect with the capstone but
[52:45] they rejected it and destroyed them as
[52:47] shock so god had to bring a seed and
[52:49] there's a bird coming for that seed oh
[52:51] glory to god hallelujah
[52:54] all glory to god that bright church has
[52:57] to be delivered of a new birth so birds
[52:59] have to come for that seed because their
[53:01] seed is the church of grace the seed is
[53:03] truly perfection
[53:05] oh give the lord i shout the capstone
[53:06] word that's the seed that's in the bride
[53:09] i see to make you perfect because we
[53:12] have to come to perfection to bring on
[53:14] the resurrection this seed is not a
[53:16] church seed record there is no rage oh
[53:18] give the lord a shout this is the bright
[53:20] age
[53:23] glory
[53:24] hallelujah
[53:27] my god my god
[53:29] watch the perimeter that shapes up
[53:31] the church justification certification
[53:34] baptism holy spirit
[53:36] then here we go that's got to be honed
[53:40] some sometime ago he was talking about
[53:42] he said that holy ghost bunch being
[53:44] honed
[53:45] so without getting to the holy ghost he
[53:47] can't be home
[53:48] he's not holding sanctification he's at
[53:50] home in justification he's holding the
[53:55] that's spirit
[53:57] and that's deep
[53:58] and that's not skim milk
[54:00] because that there'll be no
[54:01] impersonation to that
[54:04] this step there is no imperfection to
[54:06] that
[54:07] oh glory to god hallelujah
[54:11] watch
[54:12] and the headstone never did come to the
[54:14] pyramid it was rejected just like the
[54:16] cornerstone now when the headstone come
[54:19] i've been to the pyramid so perfectly
[54:20] fit when christ comes
[54:23] to receive
[54:24] his church
[54:26] the church will have the ministry just
[54:29] exactly like that
[54:30] and true grace will raise the whole
[54:32] thing the coming of the headstone what
[54:35] he's saying christ not coming on dry
[54:37] like i said the holy ghost will come and
[54:38] dries at that dead people day no holy
[54:40] commander that there was praise and
[54:41] worshipping god in your room there was
[54:43] creating an atmosphere so christ himself
[54:45] not coming to no dead church
[54:47] it has to have his ministry his spirit
[54:50] to blend that's another word the prophet
[54:52] used i'm going to dig up in all those
[54:53] words honed blend those are key words
[54:56] those are very important words there is
[54:58] nothing so they know
[55:01] all your followers is a mystery
[55:03] yeah we could talk about daniel 70 weeks
[55:06] and the vials and the woes and he plays
[55:08] but blending
[55:10] hone in
[55:11] oh glory to god character formation
[55:14] character building
[55:16] giving all diligence
[55:18] how to run this race
[55:20] paul said we don't run like beaten in
[55:22] the air you'll run to obtain
[55:24] you don't want to enter well like in the
[55:26] race that's not touching what you're
[55:28] going through
[55:29] what you're going for
[55:31] because you have to answer the question
[55:32] why because why is what preserves you in
[55:35] your trial and testing oh glory when
[55:38] you're struggling you know why god
[55:40] called you you know why you have to keep
[55:42] pressing on you know why you have to
[55:43] keep pushing forward
[55:46] but if you don't know why you would let
[55:48] go you would give up
[55:52] you think the pastor doesn't be tired
[55:53] too and where are you but i know why i'm
[55:55] here
[55:56] i know why i'm here tonight i know what
[55:59] i'm expecting and why i'm expecting it
[56:00] i'm supposed to be expecting it so i'm
[56:03] pushed i have to push
[56:05] oh glory to god if you don't know why
[56:07] you'll give up
[56:08] you aim at and you'll get relaxed and
[56:09] you forget what you was aiming at
[56:12] you forget the purpose you forgot what
[56:14] raised you up for
[56:17] afterwards samson's had to play games
[56:20] play with delilah play with that and
[56:21] play with this the anointing still
[56:23] remember you're playing games but you
[56:25] still have the locks
[56:26] you still have the covenant
[56:28] hallelujah hearted the woman
[56:30] and his strength to god and god still
[56:32] working with that

[59:33] dustin on you coming on the carpet on

[59:42] you finding you're kicking off your
[59:43] trainer because is this coin
[59:45] hallelujah and then all this oughts and
[59:47] grudge and meanness and bad behavior and
[59:50] ministers carrying a bunch of
[59:51] foolishness putting all kind of evil
[59:54] seeds in their people
[59:55] and kind of hating the people that can't
[59:57] receive another minister they call you
[59:58] another
[59:59] all they bind to the pastor binding them
[1:00:01] with fear and all kind of thing like
[1:00:02] that you think god please do that
[1:00:04] [Music]
[1:00:07] do you think god pleased with them kind
[1:00:08] of things
[1:00:09] when there's a smack brotherly kindness
[1:00:12] spirit of forgiveness and you have to
[1:00:14] put yourself on your brothers but in
[1:00:16] your brother's place in your brother's
[1:00:18] shoes only matter and faith is based
[1:00:20] upon forgiveness
[1:00:21] we're wrapped you in faith you could get
[1:00:23] with with oats
[1:00:24] and grudge you can't put a long charity
[1:00:26] a couple of your spirit you can get
[1:00:28] until it's step you can get the limited
[1:00:29] face nothing
[1:00:31] only talk
[1:00:32] and more talk and more talk
[1:00:35] nice talk to the tribulation
[1:00:37] because it will take power to go in the
[1:00:38] rapture
[1:00:39] it works
[1:00:40] even even even the prophet was tested
[1:00:43] at what he gonna do people making love
[1:00:45] in church he said stop it please stop it
[1:00:47] stop it
[1:00:48] the carrying on then god drop down
[1:00:51] mind of god drop down whatever you do
[1:00:53] you're in charge you're a son sign off
[1:00:55] on them
[1:00:56] hallelujah in case you don't know you
[1:00:58] can stay blind
[1:00:59] in case you don't know you can say debt
[1:01:01] in case you don't know give them options
[1:01:04] and they'll overstand the bombs i
[1:01:05] forgive you
[1:01:07] what made them do that
[1:01:09] that is not a
[1:01:11] a text
[1:01:12] that is a manifestation
[1:01:14] what make him say i forgive you and then
[1:01:16] the holy spirit fell because god was
[1:01:18] pleased because his son acting like him
[1:01:21] or give the lord a shout out he he he
[1:01:24] didn't bother with none of the options
[1:01:27] number one people came together in
[1:01:28] church not now
[1:01:30] the police will throw them out
[1:01:33] before they even detest come to even say
[1:01:35] i forgive
[1:01:36] you see what i'm talking about now
[1:01:39] it's just legalistic it's just political
[1:01:41] it's just natural it's just revelation
[1:01:43] and people move in a certain way where
[1:01:45] is the test
[1:01:47] because all these virtues have to be
[1:01:49] proven tested
[1:01:51] scripturally proven to use the prophet's
[1:01:53] word that these things are in us
[1:01:56] that god can see
[1:01:59] not the pastor
[1:02:00] not the deacon not the elder that god
[1:02:03] can see faith and vote you and knowledge
[1:02:06] that's different
[1:02:07] because if god could see that it means
[1:02:09] that that living out by by expressing my
[1:02:12] works and because god seeing faith but
[1:02:13] mangosteer works
[1:02:15] so god's seeing these virtues but man
[1:02:16] will see the life of these virtues
[1:02:18] thundering out in sweetness and meekness
[1:02:20] and humility
[1:02:22] on the fire walking around the world
[1:02:23] today
[1:02:25] oh my you love him tonight
[1:02:27] so he said no watch she had australian
[1:02:29] time she scrubbed the floors she swept
[1:02:31] the wall she took it on the cobweb she
[1:02:33] kept on until she found what she had
[1:02:34] lost and when she did she called her
[1:02:37] little sister churches to come now i
[1:02:38] don't care if you're a methodist baptist
[1:02:40] pentecostal presbyterian what are you
[1:02:42] saying i don't care what you believe
[1:02:44] i don't care what church should be
[1:02:45] learned i don't care what group you
[1:02:46] belong to he said and come and rejoice
[1:02:49] together when that time come
[1:02:52] prophecy
[1:02:53] when the church finds his brotherly love
[1:02:56] when the church finally holds in c2 when
[1:02:58] the church finds his place in christ
[1:03:00] tree it will call to the other members
[1:03:02] of the body come and rejoice with us
[1:03:05] god wants the church to love him
[1:03:07] water blood spirit
[1:03:10] ezekiel 36 26 27 new heart will i give
[1:03:13] you
[1:03:14] a new spirit will i put within you
[1:03:17] and i will take away the stunning heart
[1:03:18] out of your flesh
[1:03:20] and i will give you a heart of flesh and
[1:03:22] i will put my spirit within you
[1:03:25] and cause you to walk in my statutes
[1:03:27] and you shall keep my judgments unto
[1:03:29] them
[1:03:30] so god promised a new heart
[1:03:32] a new spirit a sanctified spirit and
[1:03:34] then his spirit
[1:03:35] because with your new spirit
[1:03:37] without a new spirit you cannot agree
[1:03:39] with anybody how many kind of agrees
[1:03:41] your neighbor your husband just
[1:03:42] miserable so he gave you a sanctified
[1:03:45] spirit
[1:03:46] that could work along with the holy
[1:03:47] spirit
[1:03:49] oh hallelujah praise god because the
[1:03:50] holy spirit wants to come
[1:03:52] but he can't handle a filthy spirit
[1:03:55] he has to handle a sanctified spirit
[1:03:58] isn't that right
[1:03:59] and what happened in the old testament
[1:04:01] there were three courts the outer court
[1:04:03] people lived by the moon and the sun and
[1:04:04] the dark and whatnot the inner court has
[1:04:06] seven golden candlesticks isn't that
[1:04:08] right but sometimes the lamb gets smoky
[1:04:10] isn't that right but there's a place
[1:04:12] beyond that
[1:04:14] where the glory never failed it was
[1:04:16] called the innervale oh glory there were
[1:04:18] there was three stages there was three
[1:04:20] parts of the court the outer core the
[1:04:22] inner court and the most holy place the
[1:04:24] object is to get into the most holy
[1:04:26] place because that is where that dead
[1:04:28] red blossom embodied that is where dead
[1:04:31] things will come to life that is where
[1:04:33] you could come to life
[1:04:34] and stay alive
[1:04:36] in the presence of shekinah glory oh
[1:04:38] give the lord a shout
[1:04:40] glory to god hallelujah there are
[1:04:43] believers hanging on the outer court
[1:04:45] they content to live there they contend
[1:04:47] to stay there they are those who push
[1:04:49] into going to the inner court but there
[1:04:51] is something beyond that
[1:04:53] and beyond that veil there is something
[1:04:55] for you to press onto
[1:04:57] oh glory to god water
[1:04:59] blood
[1:05:01] spirit
[1:05:02] water is like ultra court
[1:05:04] blood is like the seven chest ages seven
[1:05:07] candlesticks and spirit is the inner
[1:05:10] veil i'll give the lord some praises
[1:05:11] tonight
[1:05:12] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:14] glory to god hallelujah praise god and
[1:05:17] the prophet said there's one thing to
[1:05:19] break through to go to that other step
[1:05:21] he said his self will you have to will
[1:05:23] to do the will of god you have to want
[1:05:25] it you can't sit down and get rocking
[1:05:27] like you're entitled go ahead and
[1:05:29] entitle people you fight for every inch
[1:05:31] the kingdom is preached and every man
[1:05:33] pressed away into it you have to want
[1:05:35] this third step
[1:05:41] you have to be intentional about it
[1:05:45] what paul said he said
[1:05:47] i fight not as beaten in the air i bring
[1:05:50] my body in subjection
[1:05:52] that i myself would not be a cast away
[1:05:54] after preaching the gospel so he now
[1:05:56] take it for granted well you know i'm a
[1:05:57] poor in the apostle i can do i want go
[1:06:00] where i want act like all i want so what
[1:06:02] i want no
[1:06:04] he said anybody that
[1:06:06] present like olympics have to be trained
[1:06:09] have to come under discipline
[1:06:11] in order to what in order to hit the
[1:06:13] mark
[1:06:14] is half first place second place and
[1:06:16] take place
[1:06:17] and have also run
[1:06:22] nobody also runs have no price again you
[1:06:24] know
[1:06:24] they also run have no medal to get you
[1:06:26] know it have gold silver and brands
[1:06:30] the rapture is for goal
[1:06:38] hope nobody asked me where i get out
[1:06:40] from
[1:06:44] i hope nobody asked me
[1:06:56] that's why rome
[1:06:58] going and rule the world
[1:07:00] right now
[1:07:02] they cancel a woman who was supposed to
[1:07:04] but donald trump wanted to be the head
[1:07:07] of the federal reserve
[1:07:08] a woman they said she had not case
[1:07:11] and all them
[1:07:13] even the republicans and the vote
[1:07:15] not that woman
[1:07:17] you know what you want to do she want to
[1:07:18] go back to the gold standard
[1:07:20] but guess what but iran prophesied
[1:07:23] that they will go back to the gold
[1:07:24] standard they find she's a nut case when
[1:07:26] i see that i say wow it is closer and
[1:07:29] nearer than we think
[1:07:32] so there's a method to the madness the
[1:07:34] queen of america
[1:07:35] oh hallelujah praise god is is much more
[1:07:38] than media
[1:07:40] oh hallelujah praise the name of the
[1:07:42] lord could we continue a little bit
[1:07:44] hallelujah so but i'm talking about uh
[1:07:48] water baptism there's some future home
[1:07:50] they repent and they get baptized and
[1:07:52] repentance and so on like that and then
[1:07:54] said you can't repent for what adam done
[1:07:57] i don't done done it
[1:07:58] he said but you just get forgiven so
[1:08:00] what you done
[1:08:01] the old nature is still there you get
[1:08:03] baptized right then you put a board you
[1:08:05] see here's a human heart and here is a
[1:08:06] human heart now indeed have a snake in
[1:08:08] it that is sin here he has his life
[1:08:12] and this one have a dove which is the
[1:08:13] holy spirit it's two different hearts
[1:08:15] here here he has life and this one have
[1:08:18] malice hatred envy and that's what
[1:08:20] causing it is this fellow here this one
[1:08:23] have love joy long suffering this is
[1:08:25] what does it do here now when you ask
[1:08:27] you are forgiven of your sins you have
[1:08:29] done this and take it away but the thing
[1:08:31] that made you do it is still there
[1:08:34] that is the old root of evil it is still
[1:08:36] there notice when you repent
[1:08:39] and are baptized in the name of jesus
[1:08:40] that he forgive you of your sins then
[1:08:42] secondly comes sanctification which sets
[1:08:45] our mind in order for holiness
[1:08:48] to think right
[1:08:50] and then sanification is the compound
[1:08:51] greek word mean clean and set aside for
[1:08:54] service next come the baptism of fire
[1:08:56] and the holy ghost that god might dwell
[1:08:58] in us and the fire of god cleanses our
[1:09:01] hearts from sin and puts the holy ghost
[1:09:03] inside
[1:09:04] not the pastor not teaching
[1:09:08] the fire of god
[1:09:11] not mysteries
[1:09:12] not the hidden ones and hidden hidden
[1:09:13] ones
[1:09:16] the fire
[1:09:18] let any minister challenge me on that
[1:09:21] the fire
[1:09:23] hallelujah let me read it again this
[1:09:24] song is good
[1:09:26] next come the baptism of fire and holy
[1:09:28] ghost that god might dwell in us and the
[1:09:30] fire of god cleanses our hearts from sin
[1:09:33] and puts the holy ghost inside
[1:09:35] then we bring forth the same life that
[1:09:38] this this did that this because he is in
[1:09:41] us notice in a natural birth when a
[1:09:44] woman gives bitter baby natural light
[1:09:45] spiritual life when wrong is bitter baby
[1:09:48] the natural things is breaking of water
[1:09:50] then blood then the spirit the life
[1:09:51] gravel fellow spank him away he goes
[1:09:54] screaming water blood spirit now when a
[1:09:56] baby is born into the kingdom of god he
[1:09:59] comes the same way
[1:10:01] water
[1:10:02] blood spirit not notice sanctification
[1:10:06] and the second stage of it cleanses the
[1:10:08] mind
[1:10:09] and sets the heart the mind of the heart
[1:10:12] in order of holiness
[1:10:14] now when he gets sanctified
[1:10:17] that cleanses that desire out of him see
[1:10:20] it takes the want of it away he can
[1:10:23] still be tempted
[1:10:24] to the temptation of the issue but it
[1:10:27] takes the want
[1:10:29] of it away still he's not right yet
[1:10:33] then he is baptized with the holy ghost
[1:10:36] on fire cleansed
[1:10:39] abraham was burnt out
[1:10:42] clean up
[1:10:43] and then put into the service of god
[1:10:46] sanctification only sets them aside
[1:10:50] for service
[1:10:51] notice exactly the messengers come
[1:10:54] martin luther justification was recently
[1:10:57] the pentecostal the bible egos the
[1:10:58] messages and there can't be no more ages
[1:11:01] of it we are the end time three stages
[1:11:04] baptism cleanses the heart with the holy
[1:11:06] ghost now how striking he takes the
[1:11:08] place where he we are to dwell in
[1:11:11] through the same process now
[1:11:13] he is called the church through
[1:11:15] justification call it true certification
[1:11:18] then fill it with the holy ghost and
[1:11:19] fire and he took it through a process
[1:11:21] here we go that he himself the holy
[1:11:25] spirit himself the son of god could
[1:11:27] dwell in the human heart no it has
[1:11:29] to go through that before he can come
[1:11:32] into it
[1:11:33] so there is no way to eliminate that
[1:11:35] process and i hear the word and an
[1:11:37] equipment dominion then i recognize that
[1:11:39] my son
[1:11:40] you see them fancy talk
[1:11:44] all of a sudden i get a realization
[1:11:49] and i believe the message and i had the
[1:11:50] holy ghost because i believe the message
[1:11:52] all that is
[1:11:53] talk
[1:11:54] [Music]
[1:11:55] that is not what is being taught
[1:11:57] that is not what the prophet brought
[1:12:00] hallelujah notice in the undiluvian
[1:12:02] world
[1:12:04] okay right
[1:12:07] after it repented through the bride of
[1:12:09] that day noah he gave it a water baptism
[1:12:14] so the further or deeper revelation of
[1:12:16] the flood wasn't just a flood
[1:12:19] it was god redeeming the earth so noah's
[1:12:23] earth or the earth was baptized with the
[1:12:26] flood
[1:12:27] in noah's time
[1:12:28] water
[1:12:30] hallelujah
[1:12:32] then christ came and shed his blood upon
[1:12:34] it and cleanse it claiming it
[1:12:37] blood
[1:12:39] and the scripture we read it waiting for
[1:12:41] fire
[1:12:42] and now satan hears the scripture try to
[1:12:44] make him break god's plan to receive it
[1:12:46] to give it to him when he took him up
[1:12:48] the mountain and tried to give it to him
[1:12:50] with all the purchase of the blood
[1:12:52] so that's what satan offer was let's
[1:12:54] interrupt this thing we had water but
[1:12:56] you see this blood thing don't go there
[1:12:59] all this kingdom i will give you you
[1:13:00] don't have to shed one blood just die
[1:13:02] dire village
[1:13:05] but jesus knew
[1:13:07] that the price is a blood currency
[1:13:10] it's a blood price that only he alone
[1:13:12] could pay
[1:13:12] he can't send an angel he can't send
[1:13:14] some other man he alone could play it
[1:13:17] god became man to pay the blood price oh
[1:13:20] glory to god so they beat him they
[1:13:23] tortured him and everything as they
[1:13:24] whipped him but he paid the price oh
[1:13:27] glory to god water wasn't enough we
[1:13:29] needed the blood because the blood
[1:13:31] released the life and once that spirit
[1:13:33] is released the devil in trouble because
[1:13:36] it means adam fallen race is getting
[1:13:38] back sons of god are coming back and we
[1:13:41] are coming back because the blood made
[1:13:43] our way back
[1:13:44] and the spirit follows the blood all the
[1:13:46] way from the book of redemption so when
[1:13:48] the lamb took the book and opened the
[1:13:50] book and lose the seven seas the spirit
[1:13:53] was following the blood words so tonight
[1:13:55] we are preaching blood
[1:13:57] tonight there's a blood message
[1:13:59] it is a blood message oh glory to god
[1:14:02] that's why the anointing is here the
[1:14:03] spirit follows the blood all the way
[1:14:06] from the book of redemption i'll die
[1:14:08] without it oh i'm connected with it you
[1:14:10] are the words of the book we can leave
[1:14:12] the book oh give the lord some praises
[1:14:15] oh
[1:14:16] hallelujah hallelujah praise god
[1:14:19] glory to god amen
[1:14:21] christ came and called the church to
[1:14:24] repentance and baptism in the name of
[1:14:26] jesus christ permission and sanctify the
[1:14:27] church and then the fire come down and
[1:14:29] burn out the filth and comes and dwells
[1:14:31] in the human heart now the world to be
[1:14:34] redeemed for this redeemed person he
[1:14:36] used the same method so the world the
[1:14:38] earth
[1:14:39] and the persons have to live in it is
[1:14:42] redeemed the same way
[1:14:44] oh hallelujah that's why it had to be
[1:14:46] renovated
[1:14:47] for the bride to come back to step foot
[1:14:49] on it
[1:14:50] isn't that right
[1:14:52] okay let's continue here now no it has
[1:14:54] to go through the baptism of fire holy
[1:14:57] fire from god which cleanses the earth
[1:14:59] and heavens around it then it's
[1:15:00] purchased so that the red team can live
[1:15:02] on it live in peace notice the baptism
[1:15:04] of fire it's a cleanse from sin from
[1:15:07] sickness from diseases from germs from
[1:15:10] sinners from the devil and all his group
[1:15:12] he is to be cast on the lake of fire
[1:15:14] holy far from god comes up from god out
[1:15:16] of heaven and burns it up notice is to
[1:15:18] make ready for god to dwell in for god
[1:15:20] in a new world that is to come it's
[1:15:21] dwelling in the earth because you say
[1:15:23] god he dwells in the human heart but he
[1:15:25] and the bride becomes one and they go to
[1:15:27] their home in the new world and the same
[1:15:29] plan of redemption is used to be
[1:15:31] redeemed both the world and the persons
[1:15:33] that live in it see here we go the heart
[1:15:36] has to be cleansed like that before god
[1:15:39] can come down in the person of the holy
[1:15:41] ghost these words are important the
[1:15:43] emphasis are important all the other
[1:15:46] words are we have to be made for god to
[1:15:48] step into you oh give the lord some
[1:15:50] praises oh glory to god
[1:15:53] hallelujah
[1:15:54] i see so much of people lying lying the
[1:15:57] lying prophets they prophesy lies and
[1:16:00] every person you know jesus continued
[1:16:01] more
[1:16:03] god they talked to them
[1:16:05] god never spoke to them i think it
[1:16:07] sometimes we read about jeremiah
[1:16:09] jeremiah 23 i believe it was god said
[1:16:12] these are prophets that i never spoke to
[1:16:15] and they speaking in my name calling
[1:16:16] just saying lord he said he's speaking
[1:16:18] by the deceit of their own heart i have
[1:16:20] not spoken to them
[1:16:22] i didn't send them he said don't listen
[1:16:24] to them
[1:16:25] i did not send them
[1:16:27] prophet don't try to mix and twist and
[1:16:29] and try to fit it to fit the prophecy no
[1:16:32] is that a man here from god in here from
[1:16:33] god
[1:16:35] and what do you say to the bride the
[1:16:36] last days she will have dust here the
[1:16:38] lord what what do you say anybody in
[1:16:40] last days she'll be the final voice to
[1:16:42] the final aid what do you say about the
[1:16:44] bride in the last days the world will
[1:16:45] hear direct from god
[1:16:47] girl only speaking to the bride
[1:16:49] think about it he spoke in the prophet
[1:16:51] you speaking on the bride present tense
[1:16:54] once more the world go here direct from
[1:16:55] god
[1:16:56] oh my now this baptism of fire cleanses
[1:16:58] from all the germs all the diseases all
[1:17:01] sickness even all the spiritual things
[1:17:02] which is by us two it does the same way
[1:17:05] to make it ready for god to dwell in in
[1:17:06] this great age to come
[1:17:08] okay i hope i didn't skip
[1:17:16] okay right so the heart has to be
[1:17:17] cleansed like that before god can come
[1:17:19] down in the person of the holy holy
[1:17:21] ghost which is christ coming down dwell
[1:17:24] in the human heart it first must be
[1:17:25] repented it must first be baptized in
[1:17:27] water it might be cleansed by the blood
[1:17:29] of jesus christ and then the holy fire
[1:17:30] holy ghost come from god comes down and
[1:17:32] burns out all the desire all the nature
[1:17:35] of the world
[1:17:36] oh my hallelujah
[1:17:39] praise god so you talk about the
[1:17:41] pharisees and scribes and so on outside
[1:17:43] they're looking white they're looking
[1:17:44] clean they're looking nice but the
[1:17:46] predestination back there is sinful
[1:17:47] isn't that right and black behind here
[1:17:50] and this woman are the well prostitute
[1:17:52] now her life looking sinful looking all
[1:17:55] negative and all the talk behind it but
[1:17:57] behind that her predestination was unto
[1:18:00] god elected and predestinated isn't that
[1:18:02] right in god's mind when jesus came and
[1:18:05] manifested the word watch he said this
[1:18:07] little woman had nothing to present she
[1:18:09] was as filthy as dirty as she could be
[1:18:12] but notice way down in her she got
[1:18:14] representation
[1:18:16] oh glory to god that's why she could get
[1:18:18] justification because she had
[1:18:19] representation that's how you get
[1:18:21] tonight that's why she could get
[1:18:22] justification because she had
[1:18:24] representation her life was filthy but
[1:18:26] she had representation back there so he
[1:18:28] devil could talk he could cry he could
[1:18:30] laugh he could say whatever you want she
[1:18:32] was going to come true
[1:18:33] oh glory to god and i don't care what
[1:18:35] you have been going through what
[1:18:36] negative or wrong your life you're going
[1:18:38] to come through if your name is in the
[1:18:40] book it has to come true oh glory to god
[1:18:42] we believe that hallelujah so he came to
[1:18:45] redeem that which was fallen and in the
[1:18:47] fall this got messed up with that girl
[1:18:49] but god had her in a stinking before the
[1:18:52] foundation of the world or when the
[1:18:53] priest what did it do to him it sent him
[1:18:55] back to his destination he had nothing
[1:18:57] only intellectual learning now listen
[1:18:59] friends if the only thing you got is
[1:19:01] intellectual learning you got something
[1:19:03] you've got to get something different
[1:19:04] from that you'll never be able to get it
[1:19:06] unless you got representation and the
[1:19:08] reason i believe you come from the east
[1:19:10] and west north and south the word living
[1:19:12] manifest isn't that right so watch
[1:19:14] something you become a new person
[1:19:16] not an old one patched up by joining
[1:19:19] church and trying to turn a new page but
[1:19:21] you are a complete brand new unit god
[1:19:24] takes the old man and burns him all
[1:19:26] completely out with the holy ghost on
[1:19:28] fire and comes himself
[1:19:30] and he
[1:19:31] sends down your representation
[1:19:33] oh glory to god by fire
[1:19:35] oh glory to god you're just not saying
[1:19:37] your name in any book you know you you
[1:19:39] have the you have your name manifested
[1:19:41] by the holy ghost upon your life oh give
[1:19:44] the lord some praises amen
[1:19:46] when
[1:19:47] you say when his blood was shed at
[1:19:48] calvary he dropped back upon the earth
[1:19:50] what for to redeem the earth no it's
[1:19:52] been justified it's been sanctified it's
[1:19:54] called and claimed her like that now to
[1:19:57] be received baptism of fire
[1:19:58] justification is called hallelujah the
[1:20:01] blood is claimed hallelujah the next
[1:20:03] step baptism of fire to be cleansed for
[1:20:06] jesus and his bride oh glory to god

[1:20:11] the earth you are part of the earth okay
[1:20:14] your body your soul is part of god
[1:20:17] attribute of god displayed here on earth
[1:20:20] the body is to be redeemed

[1:20:44] cleansed by fire oh glory to god we are
[1:20:47] already justified we are already
[1:20:48] glorified oh glory to god we are going
[1:20:51] to process who ethan we call come on
[1:20:54] hell who he call he

[1:21:00] oh my praise god you shall come and
[1:21:03] please oh hallelujah blessed be the name
[1:21:06] of the lord thank you lord jesus
[1:21:08] hallelujah praise god the place where
[1:21:11] you live with the baptism of the holy
[1:21:13] ghost a dwelling place for christ and
[1:21:15] his bride the new jerusalem watch this
[1:21:18] city this will take up his abortion you
[1:21:20] cannot
[1:21:21] he said okay i'll just keep by my lord
[1:21:25] now we have left the pentecostal age
[1:21:27] this sunday sign of this time
[1:21:29] now we are coming to where the pyramid
[1:21:31] not pyramid doctrine now but i mean like
[1:21:33] the pyramid the headstone when it comes
[1:21:35] to fit it's got to be honed saying it
[1:21:37] would again honed there's got to be a
[1:21:39] ministry in the church the true church
[1:21:42] of the living god to where when the
[1:21:44] heads don't come
[1:21:45] when
[1:21:47] the heads don't come we're not talking
[1:21:48] about teaching ministry and this
[1:21:50] ministry and and no
[1:21:53] when the headstone comes christ
[1:21:55] or
[1:21:56] the ministry of christ and and christ
[1:21:59] will fit right and perfectly together
[1:22:02] so in other words in the church have to
[1:22:03] have christ's own ministry his spirit
[1:22:06] the other half of the chinese thicket
[1:22:07] then
[1:22:09] he is one part and the bride will have
[1:22:10] the next part operated in the church
[1:22:12] that's why he said there will be a
[1:22:13] church where jesus christ walking in it
[1:22:15] the shout of the king will be in the
[1:22:16] camp
[1:22:17] oh glory not the silence of the king the
[1:22:20] shout of the king will be in the camp
[1:22:22] that means healing signs wonders
[1:22:24] miracles the glory of god it will be no
[1:22:26] private show oh glory to god be a
[1:22:28] witness to the world let me say it again
[1:22:31] it will be a witness to the world
[1:22:33] i say that again it will be a witness to
[1:22:36] the world that attack with me no private
[1:22:38] show oh glory to god go go say this is
[1:22:41] my bread look here this is my woman this
[1:22:43] is my lady i am proud of her i'll please
[1:22:46] with her i'm going to manifest myself
[1:22:48] protect her overshadow her and take her
[1:22:50] away
[1:22:51] oh thank you lord hallelujah
[1:22:54] christ or the mention of christ and
[1:22:55] christ will fit right into it then that
[1:22:57] brings back the redeemed to take the
[1:22:58] whole house to glory again
[1:23:00] we're the methodist baptist presbyterian
[1:23:02] through the great reformation ages
[1:23:05] praise god that come out and give their
[1:23:06] lives and persecution and things for the
[1:23:08] kingdom of god that stone is coming yes
[1:23:10] sir it certainly will come notice when a
[1:23:12] baby is born this is the final quote
[1:23:15] there are three things that constitute
[1:23:16] this birth
[1:23:18] the first thing normal birth your dog's
[1:23:19] listening close a bird is water then
[1:23:21] blood and life now
[1:23:23] the same thing that constitutes the new
[1:23:24] birth water blood spirit the elements
[1:23:27] that came from his body is what makes
[1:23:29] his body see
[1:23:31] my lord it comes from his body it is the
[1:23:34] material that takes to make his bride
[1:23:37] aha
[1:23:39] so these are the elements
[1:23:41] that was taken
[1:23:43] to actually make the bride
[1:23:45] water
[1:23:47] blood and spirit
[1:23:49] and his bride was taken from his body
[1:23:52] christ has his bride
[1:23:54] taken from his body and when christ died
[1:23:58] there was three elements that came from
[1:24:01] his body
[1:24:02] water
[1:24:04] blood
[1:24:04] and spirit
[1:24:06] justification to believe in he said
[1:24:08] water
[1:24:09] sanification through the blood
[1:24:11] and then the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:24:14] i close with these words here now
[1:24:16] now are you ready
[1:24:18] this
[1:24:20] last great step
[1:24:23] what is he talking about the spirit part
[1:24:26] this last great step
[1:24:29] must come into perfection
[1:24:32] so he's talking about the spirit part
[1:24:34] coming to perfection that
[1:24:36] the holy spirit
[1:24:38] has to live in that church so perfectly
[1:24:41] it will make the head and the body unite
[1:24:44] together
[1:24:45] that's the body and he's ahead
[1:24:48] we find out he promised in the last days
[1:24:50] that it would be done
[1:24:52] [Music]
[1:24:53] unfinished
[1:24:56] this last step that's why the
[1:24:58] pentecostal
[1:25:00] had the spirit
[1:25:01] but they couldn't come into this last
[1:25:02] step
[1:25:03] because you need the word
[1:25:05] to come into this last step
[1:25:07] this perfection
[1:25:09] is seven perfect spirits and that was
[1:25:12] only released by the message of malachi
[1:25:14] 4.
[1:25:15] the pentecostal didn't have that
[1:25:17] they had spirit built
[1:25:19] but the word produced faith
[1:25:22] virtue
[1:25:23] knowledge
[1:25:24] temperance patience
[1:25:26] godliness brotherly kindness what is
[1:25:28] that a perfect church for the capstone
[1:25:31] to come to cap off
[1:25:33] christ spirit coming into the church to
[1:25:35] manifest these seven virtues
[1:25:37] seven living voices
[1:25:39] living in you and i let's all stand
