[18:38] Luke in the sixth month of the in the
[18:41] sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent
[18:44] from God the city of
[18:51] Gile to a virgin exposed to a man whose
[18:54] name was Joseph of the House of David
[18:57] virgin's name was Mary
[19:06] and the angel came in unto her and said
[19:09] heal thou highly favored the Lord is
[19:11] with thee blessed are thou among women
[19:22] El and when she saw him she was troubled
[19:25] at his saying and cast in her mind what
[19:28] manner of salutation should
[19:37] be and the angel said unto her fear not
[19:40] Mary for thou Hast form favor with
[19:47] God and behold thou shall conceive in
[19:50] thy womb and bring forth a son and shall
[19:52] call his name
[19:57] Jesus
[20:02] he shall be great and shall be called
[20:03] the son of the highest and the Lord God
[20:05] shall give unto him the Throne of his
[20:08] father
[20:16] David and he shall reign over the house
[20:18] of Jacob forever and of his kingdom
[20:20] there shall be no
[20:27] end then said Mary unto the angel who
[20:30] shall this be see I know not a
[20:36] man and the angel answered and said unto
[20:39] her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[20:41] and the power of the high shall
[20:42] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[20:45] thing which shall be born of thee shall

[20:57] God
[21:03] and behold th cousin Elizabeth she had
[21:05] also conceived a son in her old age and
[21:08] this is a six month with her who was
[21:10] called
[21:19] Baron for with God nothing shall be
[21:24] impossible and Mary said behold the
[21:27] handman of the Lord be it unto me
[21:30] according to Thy word and the angel

[22:29] so this
[22:31] word is waiting for
[22:34] somebody with
[22:36] faith to anoint it and make it live
[22:40] again so this
[22:43] word has to become
[22:48] personalized to you in other words the
[22:51] word can't stay
[22:55] General David said the Lord will
[23:01] that which concerned
[23:03] me some point in
[23:07] time this
[23:09] word has to
[23:12] connect personally to

[23:19] prophet that's
[23:20] General there's going to be a
[23:23] bride that's
[23:25] General there going to be a super Church
[23:28] that is

[23:33] print you have got to see
[23:37] you or you have to see your
[23:40] name in the
[23:42] book oh Blessed Be of the Lord do you
[23:45] see it tonight so something happened
[23:48] with
[23:49] Mary Mary was going to service
[23:53] regularly she was here in Isaiah
[23:56] 96 Isaiah 7:4
[24:00] a virgin shall
[24:01] conceive but that word was for
[24:04] everybody because nobody know who that
[24:06] virgin
[24:08] is everybody hearing a virgin shall can
[24:11] see but that
[24:13] word for
[24:15] everybody there was a specific
[24:18] name when Isaiah said a version shall
[24:21] conceive there was a specific
[24:24] name that God was speaking
[24:27] about if you
[24:29] notice in the scripture we
[24:32] read how detailed it
[24:35] was that there'll be no mistake about
[24:39] it oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[24:43] they in the six
[24:45] month Angel
[24:47] Gabriel sent from
[24:49] God into a city of
[24:52] Galilee named
[24:54] Nazareth very
[24:56] detailed very
[24:59] specific to a
[25:01] virgin exposed to a man named
[25:05] Joseph and this
[25:07] Joseph he doesn't belong to any and any
[25:10] house he belongs to the House of
[25:14] David and the Virgin name is
[25:17] Mary when your name is on the
[25:20] book and when the
[25:22] ministry come to speak to the
[25:25] word your name is being
[25:29] expressed by the word to
[25:32] you and you have to get a
[25:35] revelation and you must see that you see
[25:37] your
[25:38] name and when you see your name your
[25:41] life is completely
[25:43] changed it is not everybody
[25:45] anymore it's about you it's about the
[25:49] calling God put in your
[25:51] life what God has
[25:53] blessed no man could
[25:56] curse what God has blessed
[25:59] no man can take that blessing off of
[26:02] you because God
[26:04] himself has sent out a call to get
[26:08] you this
[26:10] world is so
[26:12] evil the prophet said hell has been
[26:18] uncovered the lid of
[26:20] hell and streams of demon
[26:24] power so it take a third
[26:27] pull
[26:29] power to pull you
[26:31] out take a
[26:33] power to take you
[26:36] through not just reading a
[26:39] book not just listening to a
[26:42] table take our
[26:44] power we have our
[26:47] children they are facing hell on the
[26:50] earth it will take a power to keep
[26:53] them preserve them we have to have
[26:57] power the
[26:59] scientists they not using bow and
[27:02] arrow and little
[27:06] pistols they are discovering more and
[27:09] more
[27:11] power with nuclear
[27:14] weapon and
[27:18] technology and to
[27:22] effectively we cannot sit in
[27:26] ignorance something have to break out
[27:30] it's got to break out with
[27:32] somebody let it be
[27:35] you that you could hear the
[27:37] word and say like
[27:39] Mary be it done unto
[27:42] me if the sister next door don't want to
[27:47] shout that nothing to do with
[27:49] me I'm
[27:51] shouting because I see my name I am
[27:55] shouting because I know I will be
[27:57] delivered

[28:00] shouting because I know it's
[28:03] finished Oh Glory to God do you believe
[28:05] that hallelujah hallelujah glory to God
[28:10] hallelujah hallelujah so brother Bram
[28:13] they were praying for a
[28:14] messiah they wanted the
[28:17] Messiah and God sent
[28:19] him in the way he wanted
[28:22] him but they refus
[28:25] him why they refuse him because he
[28:28] didn't come in the
[28:29] fashion and in the way they desire to
[28:33] come it always troubled
[28:36] me why Jesus didn't go and take Bible
[28:41] people and scroll reading

[29:13] believe Oh Glory to God they following a
[29:17] man without a
[29:19] revelation something inside of
[29:22] them responding to the call of
[29:25] God because Jesus said

[29:42] caught they didn't know who he
[29:44] was and Peter said don't the
[29:47] Christ and Jesus said the spirit the

[43:48] wanted because in those days devil were
[43:51] cast

[44:00] Spirits by
[44:03] mus guess we could play
[44:09] music David so they send for
[44:12] David to
[44:15] play cool
[44:18] down David is walking in the
[44:21] palace that he'll be
[44:24] king walking
[44:26] the
[44:27] for him to

[44:40] Anointed God could have still anoint you
[44:44] and you're not ready yet but you will be
[44:47] ready the Bible say his

[44:55] ready get the anointing
[44:58] get this oil get this quicking
[45:02] power you have to have it every devil
[45:05] know
[45:06] it GL to
[45:08] God it's just
[45:10] written
[45:12] somebody with faith to anoint it make a
[45:18] he can live
[45:20] again the church is spiritually
[45:24] dead
[45:25] SL
[45:28] they hardly know what to
[45:30] do and
[45:32] here every promise that God made in the
[45:36] Bible is just as
[45:39] good
[45:43] oh
[45:45] said he said God will take his
[45:49] word that he promised for this
[45:51] day and
[45:53] anointed and it would happen there is no
[45:57] way to
[46:01] keep no matter what the church
[46:04] says or the rest of
[46:07] them he said be
[46:11] one as I am the father a
[46:14] one be that kind of a
[46:18] one then how will it be how will we
[46:21] become
[46:22] one here's the
[46:24] answer the word in US
[46:28] would be the
[46:30] anointed that is the Oneness of
[46:33] God now you know you have been
[46:36] taught what's the
[46:38] secret the word is in the brein that's
[46:43] what the prophet
[46:44] said the Holy Spirit take up a pen and
[46:47] write the
[46:49] secret the word is in the bride so as
[46:53] the man preached the
[46:55] word word is not going into
[46:58] you but now tonight that word in you has
[47:05] become
[47:07] anointed am that's a different
[47:12] thing that is a
[47:14] seed and the
[47:16] anointing is the
[47:19] to in you and once the
[47:23] water strikes the SE
[47:35] it is the spirit that
[47:37] quickened the flesh profited
[47:41] nothing this is Jesus speaking
[47:44] now the words that I speak unto
[47:47] you they are
[47:49] spirit and they are life so the words
[47:53] that came
[47:55] out's was
[47:58] spirit in word
[48:00] form or in seed
[48:03] form now God
[48:05] know what he spoke to that
[48:07] Prophet The God that spoke through
[48:10] him know his
[48:13] words that came out of his
[48:15] mouth so when we say back the
[48:18] words it's not just saying back what the
[48:21] prophet
[48:22] say it is speaking Spirit giv
[48:25] words
[48:28] Spirit spoken
[48:30] word god couldn't just give you
[48:34] Spirit he give you his
[48:36] word I'm
[48:39] amazed how this omnipotent
[48:42] God could subject
[48:45] himself to his own
[48:49] laws in other words he loves you but you
[48:54] have to
[48:55] repent his love for you
[48:58] doesn't cancel your
[49:01] repentance because he
[49:05] says though your sins be as
[49:08] scet they shall be white as
[49:11] snow but you have to acknowledge your
[49:15] iniquity you have to acknowledge your
[49:17] sin and when you do that I could come
[49:21] and do something about
[49:23] it so you understand that so he in the
[49:28] beginning said let there be
[49:30] light that
[49:32] word a seed so he spoke his
[49:37] word and maybe a million years
[49:40] p and when the word become
[49:44] anointed there
[49:46] was Jesus
[49:49] come but God subject
[49:53] himself to the law of reproduction
[49:57] by creating a sperm and an
[50:00] egg put it in Mary and come to the
[50:04] regular
[50:05] way prophesy by
[50:08] Isaiah a virgin shall
[50:10] conceive this virgin don't have a
[50:14] clue it is her that Isaiah talking
[50:18] about now
[50:20] watch Mary
[50:22] name was in that
[50:24] scripture a virgin shall conceive
[50:27] so in the realm of the
[50:30] natural that scripture is
[50:34] specific one person Oh Glory to God she
[50:38] can't miss it if she
[50:40] try nobody can take a
[50:44] place nobody can claim
[50:47] that because in the of the
[50:50] spirit when Isaiah
[50:53] prophesied when Isaiah
[50:55] said voice of one Cry of
[50:59] wilderness only one person can fulfill
[51:02] that that is John the Baptist so when
[51:05] God was talking about the
[51:08] bride is only you could s the
[51:22] no
[51:25] nobody they are
[51:28] I don't care what job
[51:30] they I don't care what car they
[51:35] drive to take your
[51:37] place you are
[51:39] original you are
[51:42] authentic you are of
[51:44] God you belong to
[51:47] God hallelujah hallelujah
[51:51] Mary you have to say be it done unto
[51:55] me according to th word according to the
[52:00] scriptures I can't talk with nobody
[52:03] El
[52:05] the when
[52:07] joh when John saw the lamb Che the
[52:12] book loose the
[52:15] SE said all in
[52:18] heaven all under the
[52:23] Earth Praise
[52:25] Him
[52:28] John had a personal
[52:30] ration a personal
[52:42] testimony before he
[52:44] left had a
[52:46] testimony before you leave him before
[52:50] you

[53:27] there's no good in
[53:28] us there's no good things
[53:31] in we have no
[53:33] righteousness so for a man to walk in
[53:37] righteousness it has to be God it has to
[53:41] be God it has to be it's not
[53:46] normal Oh Glory to God do you realize
[53:51] the Bible said accept God cut the work
[53:55] short no flesh will be

[1:05:40] inheritance
[1:05:42] gr had a group
[1:05:45] testimony when Jesus from the
[1:05:47] dead the disciples had a group
[1:05:51] testimony group
[1:05:53] testimony was we have seen the Lord
[1:05:57] seen the Lord but in the upper
[1:06:00] room the pill of fire a lick of
[1:06:04] fire was on each of

[1:06:17] individual hallelujah hallelujah you
[1:06:20] want your lick of fire you want to leave
[1:06:23] that Li of
[1:06:24] Fire
[1:06:27] let's go God's
[1:06:30] son was his example
[1:06:33] seed and when the
[1:06:35] spirit poured upon
[1:06:38] him after his
[1:06:40] baptism about Jesus now the Holy Ghost
[1:06:43] came upon
[1:06:44] him and the Very
[1:06:47] life that he
[1:06:49] produced that same watering Spirit of
[1:06:52] the Holy
[1:06:54] Ghost
[1:06:57] the
[1:06:58] terminology he call it the watering
[1:07:02] Spirit of the Holy
[1:07:05] Ghost if the same seed
[1:07:08] son if that same seed is in
[1:07:11] you then the watering
[1:07:14] spirit that comes upon that
[1:07:17] seed will produce the same
[1:07:19] life no
[1:07:21] excuses oh blessed be the name
[1:07:23] of Hallelujah
[1:08:25] said now watch he said Oak will do no
[1:08:32] good it wasn't stroke up
[1:08:35] anything you see a real seed of God is
[1:08:38] absorbing to the
[1:08:40] spirit that's why sometime God have to
[1:08:42] do
[1:08:43] something to let there be a break in
[1:08:45] your
[1:08:46] life sometime you're too
[1:08:49] strong you are too strong in
[1:08:51] yourself you're too strong in your
[1:08:54] flesh God let you crack up sometimes and
[1:08:57] break up sometimes SI sometimes fall
[1:09:01] sometimes in order that the spirit can
[1:09:04] have and that's why he needed some to be
[1:09:08] broken that he could use
[1:09:10] you isn't that something
[1:09:13] else glory to God so when God's
[1:09:17] spirit Waters the seed of
[1:09:22] God it produces God oh Blessed Be of
[1:09:27] Lord so Jesus
[1:09:30] died that he might reconcile us back to
[1:09:32] his son and da of
[1:09:34] God that through the
[1:09:37] church might
[1:09:39] flow the same
[1:09:42] life the word being
[1:09:44] manifested so do you
[1:09:47] understand that
[1:09:49] adoption is not based upon the minister
[1:09:54] sermon adoption
[1:09:56] is not based upon messages
[1:09:59] preached
[1:10:01] adoption is
[1:10:03] specifically based on the character of
[1:10:05] the
[1:10:06] man nothing to do with the
[1:10:08] sermon because if it's the
[1:10:11] sermon a sister can't be
[1:10:14] adopted and we will have adopted Sons
[1:10:16] and
[1:10:18] Daughters do you get it now so what God
[1:10:21] looking
[1:10:22] for is his own
[1:10:24] life
[1:10:26] reflected in each one of
[1:10:28] us even the fold
[1:10:31] Ministry is
[1:10:33] temporary lot of ministers may not know
[1:10:36] that but until we all
[1:10:39] come when we all
[1:10:41] come in the unity of the faith in the
[1:10:44] knowledge of Son of
[1:10:46] God in your personal measure of the
[1:10:48] perfect
[1:10:51] man what more could they
[1:10:53] do we all
[1:10:57] into that image of
[1:10:58] God then that image brings us back
[1:11:03] to because that image is what God
[1:11:07] placed that image is what fell and that
[1:11:12] image is what God is
[1:11:14] restoring that image back
[1:11:17] into he tried with the
[1:11:20] Pentecostal but the Pentecost rejected
[1:11:22] the
[1:11:22] word and the word produced the image
[1:11:26] so they come
[1:11:27] short by the Dynamics that struck
[1:11:31] them so now he said a prophet to reveal
[1:11:35] the son of man and the son of man is the
[1:11:39] S the
[1:11:41] S he put the seat in
[1:11:44] you the
[1:11:47] Dynamics your seat oh praise God praise
[1:11:50] God that's how we wrap up here
[1:11:53] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[1:11:57] all right so in
[1:12:02] 1950 came to identify this
[1:12:05] Prophet isn't that right so he William
[1:12:09] Bram to anoint
[1:12:14] him
[1:12:16] Revelation luk
[1:12:18] 1 to read these
[1:12:21] scriptures believe that this is what he
[1:12:24] come to for
[1:12:27] think about it it's not easy to do
[1:12:30] that he growing up first
[1:12:34] P second P know you have a third
[1:12:38] P open of the
[1:12:41] word so he had to keep
[1:12:44] anointing what God
[1:12:46] Said concerning
[1:12:48] him now you as the bride of
[1:12:51] Christ you have to begin to
[1:12:53] anoint what God said about
[1:12:56] you for
[1:12:58] example Revelation
[1:13:00] 27 the spirit and the
[1:13:04] bride say come that's not
[1:13:10] everybody that is
[1:13:13] specific the bride is connected inside
[1:13:16] of
