and the presence of the angel that comes down to confirm the word today was really special because there was no pulling there was no pushing the Holy Spirit just swept in and just took over their service and that's one of these days we always talk about it you won't be able to preach no more because God wants to have that relationship with each one of us and I believe that we are we have turned the corner is that mountain in the corner it's a holy spirit turned in the corner to take us into a place that we have never been before Oh What A Time in the presence of the Lord you appreciate the Lord today you appreciate the word you appreciate the inspiration oh blessed be the name of the Lord I'm under great expectation before we close out uh some notes of Praises you could keep playing Softly it is indeed a blessing to be in the house of the Lord this morning I wish I thank each of you for your prayers and my behalf I'm still battling but by the grace of almighty God I'm coping much better and coming along well God be praised and may God strengthen you sister may he heal you completely from the crown of your head to the soul of your feet in the mighty name of Jesus Christ amen from Sister Ingrid Williams thanking God for his grace and mercy and for my husband last night I was in so much pain all over my body I thought I would pass out I took muscle relaxers and pain tablets but after my husband prayed for me I fell asleep I got up this morning feeling much better so we thank God please a prayer answering God he's a miracle working God amen let's just bow our heads for word of prayers we prepare to close out this service if there's anyone with a need you want to show by raise up hand as we approach a throne of grace oh Heavenly Father we thank you this morning Lord today for your love for your visitation for following the word Lord for making yourself real to individuals we are in a season and time of individuals coming into relationship with you father Lord you long to have Fellowship you long to have communion your long Lord like Lord back then even the coming in the cool of the evening to fellowship with Adam and how that Fellowship was broken and Lord how you have fought to restore that Fellowship that relationship that communion Lord that you can feel free to walk into our lives and walk into our homes alone and spend time with us and Lord we can be free to spend time with you because there's no iniquity and there's no guilt and there's no shame and there's no loyal feeling Lord because we have cast all our

amen and amen you may be seated to have quite a few announcements and we'll follow these up via the various channels so firstly service continues this Wednesday here at the Tabernacle live service this coming Wednesday here at the Tabernacle and this coming Friday will be our Zoom prayer meeting this coming Friday so this Wednesday live at the Tabernacle this coming Friday uh Zoom Prem meeting this coming Sunday there will be one service just one service this coming Sunday normally we would have had two but we are in the conventional preparation mode so we want to have one service this coming Sunday and friends there are just two more Sundays before we enter convention week so the time is rapidly upon us it's a great responsibility is a great sacrifice so I want to really encourage you as we enter into this month of July and the convention month that he continued to be in prayer and Consecration and it's a big sacrifice you know I was just talking about a little bit before coming out here that you know for somebody to come to the convention from overseas from certain countries it takes sometimes two to three days to make it to this convention two to three days to go back home it takes around maybe around twenty thousand dollars per person for those who are coming to the convention on average to make it to this meeting you know so I want to really encourage you who are here who could drive up your road or travel up the service you know or to to really take this opportunity seriously we didn't have physical conventions for a few years because of the pandemic and we don't know if this will be our last convention so I really want to challenge you to give this your everything we have seven services that will be for the convention for the 14th the 15th and the 16th of July there will be two services on the Friday three on Saturday and two on Sunday and by the grace of God we have ministers coming who will be ministering uh to be a great blessing to the bride here in Trinidad and Tobago and around the world as well so come under great expectation for that be under preparation for that and for the remainder of the services before the convention we are in convention preparation mode so I want to challenge you do your part whatever little part it is do your part in prayer in encouraging one another in calling somebody you didn't see say we are getting ready to leave this place we don't know if this convention might trigger the rapture we don't know if this convention will trigger Dynamics everything that we've been looking for can the church say Amen so let us be under critics be so easy it was for the Holy Spirit to just move into the church oh you imagine from the face of his brother Anthony the Jose moves in service after service if we didn't even finish the convention because one of these these days we just walk and walk and walk out of this place so I'm under a great Expedition and get your hearts right with God Church take this time to clean up your house clean up your life clean up your home your family call someone encourage someone get ready dig a valley full of dishes because the rain is going to fall can the Church Say Amen so this Wednesday service continues this Friday uh Zoom uh prayer meeting this coming Sunday one service come under expectation for a mighty time with a loan maintenance team group four please meet with brother Marlon Alexander after the service and uh next week group two is carded to serve that's for the Joel street because group we will publish the times I'm just going to mention the times of the convention we're doing it a little different um this year so I'm just going to mention it now but on Friday uh July the 14th service times will be at 2 p.m and 7 P.M we're gonna put it on the notice board and put it with you as well so 2 p.m and 7 P.M on Friday on Saturday will be 10 a.m 3 P.M and 7 p.m and on Sunday will be 10 a.m and 5 p.m 7 services for the

your support uh there for the convention itself during the course of this weekend certainly by this Sunday we will also make available uh the menu of uh the meals that will be available for the

will be the last Sunday before the convention to be registered if you are interested in purchasing meals either on the Friday the Saturday or the Sunday for the different options that are available so please take note of that as well so may the Lord richly bless you may you stay in the presence of the Lord may you practice the presence of the Lord and more and more friends musician good players but Anthony gets ready I'm realizing that this this journey this walk is really a daily walk you know many times you look and you see things around you and you realize that the people who are successful in the spiritual and the natural and the more you go back to the scripture you see this meditate on the word day and night your life is a product of what you do every single day your habits your thoughts your decisions every single day it compounds progress process is a day by day thing it cannot just be on a Sunday you're spending time with your lord and then maybe you catch piece of a Wednesday and then maybe no it's a day by day discipline you breathe every day you're supposed to drink water every day it's supposed to eat something every day and the more you realize that your prayer life has to be a daily thing reading the word has to be a daily thing and when you make it a part of your daily walk you find so much stuff that bothered you stop bothering you because you're plugged into a source can the Child Say Amen someone encourage you as we become more mature in the world and more mature in this thing that you practice on a daily basis I have to pray today the deer cannot finish without me praying the day cannot finish without me reading the Scripture it is I'm not becoming unacceptable for you to have a day without praying it should become unacceptable to have a deal without reading the scripture it must be that real to us friends let it be real real to you that you need this thing you need this thing may the Lord Richard bless you [Music] [Applause] God bless you and try to get ready to leave [Music] stay in his presence amen fight to good fight of faith God bless you [Music] speak [Music] let it fall [Music] out forever [Music] [Applause] [Music]
