down until the time a point lord we have to remain here so witness that would have seen yesterday today and forever father i pray you're coming to the world this morning and blessed we thank you for the services thus far last week sunday service which it was before and we pray you will come in a special way today and inspire with our hearts and jason i ask it amen and my god bless you praise me you'll be seated uh before i read the scripture i want to say a few words and so this week we have a tuesday bible study we have wednesday service online and this friday we wouldn't have any zoom prime meeting we have a special tape we'd like to share with you on this coming friday with public holiday we're going to have a special tape this coming uh sun friday how many of you do have to answer did your homework homework was to study three kind of believers but by identifying every group there's three kinds the true believer the make-believer and the unbeliever the true so we want to thank buddhism for that i believe it's timely because in this time of lingering and this time if i could use three of stress like a stress point it really defines where people are at and their spirit and their heart and their lives and um it's a person and what is interesting though is everybody under the same thing so it's what's on the inside of you how you're going to survive this thing you can't say you are not more stressed on somebody else everybody under this whole pandemic and your grain mask and social distancing and and all kind of stuff and things like that you know so it's what's inside of you no the believers the true believers believes like the disciples be there they truly believe them he said no he was the word of life and simon totally recognized this and when he recognized it that was that that was what kept his whole because it was revealed to him that he was the living word and that's a genuine believer when the holy spirit not some persuaded by some other person not by some other thing but when the holy spirit has revealed to you the word itself and you see the word made plain vindicated then the spirit of god come and get into that age for the wood out age and make it manifested and the reason and this is where if you study the message this is a big bomb inside of here but isaac a big big bomb is i do believe this from the same message that when the bride is called out and elected and set in the book of life there will come a song from heaven that will take such a baptism of the holy spirit which the preachers don't like to talk about what that will take such a baptism of the holy spirit into that bride i'm not teaching here i know preaching you know that's baptism of the holy spirit into that bride that will take her from the earth in a rapture in grace god promised it promise what when you are called out elected and set in the book of life oh glory to god god set you inside that there god set you inside every devil could move you from his idea which man can move from his either there which elder which deacon which fivefold which whatever gonna move you when god take you and set you in the book of life oh globe your mother can set you there your father can set you there your husband can't set you there your wife can set you there the preacher can't set you there god i have to set you inside of there oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah he said watch sometimes the believers are put to the test not sometimes every time no that's ten percent say email but a punch that's not good enough we talk about true believers now no we don't make believers you know he says sometimes believers are put to the test not sometimes every time and then he gives a scripture you see i have to find the word for it every son that committed god must be chastened tried child trained oh glory to god every son not some not god saving this one and god said in that one every son every is every every true son oh glory to god every believer believer son oh glory to god everyone are you one of them glory to god stop complaining and stop rejoicing because you're conquered worthy oh hallelujah every son that committed god must be chastened tried child trained remember the trials the dusty roads the hunt listen the hot sun of persecution but the loyalty of your heart beats that material till she's ready to go into the mold god's children is made up correctly on his word and they are living examples and the word of god lives through them and the trial come to shake you to put you to the very bottom to see where you will stand oh glory to god the trial comes to make it jumpy jumpy jumpy they try to come to shake you to put you at the bottom to rock you oh glory to god and when the devil see yourself standing haven't done all to stand you're standing here oh glory to god true kind i hear you true kane the other kind saying i wonder why this happened to me i wonder why this happened to me oh god i see that happened she i said that he it happened with me why not i thought you are true kind all right the same thing now hear the part now he will try to tell you satan that these trials and thing is your god trying to put punishment upon you it isn't so 10 say amen i just really know he said it isn't so no sir it is satan doing that and god is permitting it to temper you to make you see if you are tied to this earth by earth cares or whether your treasure is in heaven for whatever your treasure is there you are also your heart oh glory to god so the true believer accepts the word isn't that right the believer don't question the believer believes it regardless of what it sounds like what anybody else has got to say about it how impossible it seems to be the believer just believes it if it's the word it's the word isn't that right so all right we find out they they did all right as long as they get patted in the back which is the uh unbeliever now watch they did all right as long as they get past it on the back and call disciples as long as the everything went fine they were all right but when this prophet that they believed to be a prophet that node that could seal the sick and so forth what did he do when the real truth o praise the name of the lord hallelujah blessed give the lord some praises [Applause] hallelujah praise god thank you jesus thank you jesus hallelujah i never tried to take me away hallelujah watch what did they do when the real truth and the rebuke came contrary to what they believed they couldn't take the word and sometimes walk away the unbeliever he's a hypocrite he acts like that he says they believe but he denies it so as i said they believe a lot but not all they believe what is comfortable to them they believe what they choose to eat it's nice i wonder dear i like that here the feelings are buffet style god tell ezekiel eat the whole roll and that eat the whole role was to produce judgment to israel you know what god tell them we don't want him to find scripture he said you're not going to have strange people with a strange language you know he said you're going to my people my people speak to them but before you speak to them eat the whole rule a guy said to me that one time my minister said i don't care mr brown how many people you could produce that you said was healed i wouldn't believe it i said certainly not you can't believe it you're an unbeliever it wasn't for you it's only for believers so they walk right out of the word they won't even stay the unbelievers would you stay they take a rebuke but the third class we are speaking about is a big believer that's the boy the make believer that's judas so peter the rest of the apostles believers 70 that walk away unbelievers but judas that's the kind that holds on until they could find something a fault they say long enough to find fault that's the judas oh my but the real believer don't question anything is written once it's written in the word and they believe it they just go on that's it but always it is written oh we have to find where it is written and judas what was he agreeing with the word till the one little thing he's trying to find a place where he get a weakness oh praise god so let's all stand i want to go to the revelation chapter 10 we're under time constraint so we see what we'll do uh know what i have here can't finish today for sure but we'll do what we can and we'll press on okay i have no fight with one hour service you know i was invited 15 minutes of vision the message that pen because of 50 minutes it wasn't five hours to convince them to be playing 15 minutes and fire falling upon the heart so after that three thousand people get baptized moses was only five minutes you know in the presence of the pillar fire you know it wasn't five hours god had the symbols but no no five minutes i'm gonna say i'll go in to take over revelation 10 i saw another my team shall come down with him clue with a cloud rainbow was upon his head his face wasn't with his son his feet as still as a fire in his hand he had in his hand a little book open he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cry with a low voice is when a land wrought and when he had cried seven thunders i'll say their voices when the seven thunder the voices i was about to write i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me sealed up those those things which is seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon this scene upon the earth lifted up his hands to heaven and swear by him that lived forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that there are now and the sea and the things that there are that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel specific when he shall begin the song the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his siblings the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open at the hand of the angel which standed upon the scene upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be my mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book in the of the angel's hand ate it up was in my mouth with honey and as soon as eaten it my belly was bitter he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people's nations songs and king let's pray father we thank you for your word lord and it's quite mysterious how or we get this text and what to share this morning but i pray bless it and interpret our hearts confirm your word with signs wonders and miracles to be asked in jesus name amen you may be seated hallelujah i have a title revelation 10 of a subject christ his coming his messenger his brain and i have an inspiration the spirit of prophecy the testimony of jesus so that's the title revelation 10. and i believe this scripture holds so much in it it's one of the greatest books in the book of revelation this scripture revelation chapter 10. it is more relevant more important and more potent than you could ever think or imagine because the scripture connects to genesis what happened to the fall this scripture connects to his coming this scripture connects to the bride the true believer this concept that connected the messenger that is to the bride this can message connects to how we get the book from heaven to the earth hallelujah this revelation 10 is one of the most important scripture in this generation in this time this gen this book called revelation chapter 10 o glory to god verse 1 give the description of who is coming down a mighty angel it describes he always crawl with a clown and a rainbow over his head it described his face with like the sun and his feet as pillars of fire we know who that angel is that angel is christ the mighty angel or chief messenger oh glory to god coming down from heaven here coming from some seminary he is coming from some bible school that's the lord himself oh glory to god hallelujah all glory to god that revelation can be talking about the lord himself descending from heaven with a shout and the president of america don't know and the president of russia don't know and the prime minister of trinidad don't know but the lord himself be called as a bribery earth oh glory that the thunders have to call and elect and set in the book of life oh give the lord some praises glory to god it describes what a wrong him it describes his face it describes his feet but we want to look at what is in his hand oh help me today help me today we want to want to look at what is in his hand oh it's not a ghost it's a man it's an angel oh glory to god and something in his in his hand and the bible described it as a little book open this book that was once sealed and as you go back to genesis when man fell adam lost the book and the book went back in the hands of the original owner hallelujah when that book was opened that was taking place in heaven but something has to bring it on from heaven down to the earth get the lord i shout this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah hallelujah remember cece adam who had the book who had to call the names because the loins of adam hallelujah was supposed to unfold the rest of the sons of god adam wants to speak them and they were supposed to comfort in their time and season from the book that was in adam but when adam fell he lost the book so he couldn't call the names and that's why when jesus came the first gospel was you must be born again of the word and of the spirit proven we're going back to how we're supposed to be born by the word of god or give the lord a shout that's your original birth all club water word and spirit this book sealed shut up hidden because the devil's hands of unbelief couldn't hold i like it this little book and this book is a book of redemption this book is a book of names every elect is in that book every true believer is in that book you could find their name in that book what glory the god and that book had to come to you now remember the bible is a closed book it's a sealed book oh glory is not the open book it's a sealed book until the lamb that's why jesus came he came to pay the price to get the book not just the diane calvary the book the book the book oh give the lord a shout because in that book had your name and you have to connect with your name in order to get your inheritance you can't give inheritance to nobody nobody is not your name oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah i'm so excited about this scripture revelation chapter 10 oh glory to god he came little book open hallelujah and look where he put his foot one foot upon the land one foot upon the sea everything is covered now rainbow over his head it means it's a covenant this is the same one that swore by himself come on saints you have something to shout about oh glory to god this book revelation 10 hallelujah covenant angel glory hallelujah rainbow over his head you're supposed to swear by somebody greater but because there was nobody greater you had to swear by himself you're going to make it you're going to make it you're going to make it [Applause] some of you looking at me like if there's something you could do some of you looking at me as if something you could have done there was nothing you could have done repent this morning he has done it he took the book he paid the price [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let me see them i don't care if you're messed up for the last 60 50 100 years your day starts today that you will adjust your thinking and your behavior and your attitude the end entitlement nothing entitled go to hell so shake off all your pride and [Applause] god arrogance and mercy oh don't help me preach this morning i don't have to preach or to teach i don't know how to do this thing this morning all that writing me is revelation chapter 10. oh glory to god oh man dear i saw a man come on heaven that is not what the scripture said i saw another mighty angel well glory to god come down from heaven does that sound familiar when they were in your room and when the day of pentecost was fully come there was a sound from heaven oh glory to god i didn't fill all the house we can't be crazy we are not my people [Music] open such as right foot upon the land see his specific right foot upon the sea left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice oh glory to god you hear his face his feet his hands the book i know you're hearing with her voice he's standing there silent he cried with a lord voice and when he cried oh glory to god and when he cried and when he cried and when he cried oh glory to god as when a lion roared or when a lion wrote every beast shuts up when a lion wrote no devil move when a lion wrote everybody paralyzed he roared and when he had rule when he cried seven thunders ordered your voice or do i ask shout in the house do i hear that pride of jesus christ oh glory seven thunders utter their voices now listen no man in the picture yet this is the angel face like a sun rainbow over his head feet as pillars of fire hand let the book open nobody speaks like a lion and seven thunderstorm voices out no man idea yet this is still christ the mighty angel of revelation 10. hallelujah hallelujah when the seven thunders are dotted voices i was about to write i heard a voice of heaven saying seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel that i saw stand upon the scene upon the earth lifted up his hands to heaven and swear by him that live forever and ever who created heaven and things that darren are and the earth that thing that there are and the sea and the things that are enough that there should be time no longer or time is over or time is up or the ending of time or time is finished or the ending of the seventh seal or glory to god hallelujah or the occlusion of the gentile dispensation [Applause] [Music] time no more time [Music] [Applause] [Music] in babylon in time of daniel when the writing came on the wall and they called for the interpreters because the king's knee was knocking he saw a hand begin to write on the wall are tongues language and when they get the interpretation you are found in the balance and found wanting time up your kingdom is taken and that means a person was right at the gate oh glory time up one is this time will be up no more time because that little dog was really closed poke open but one day that same book that is open could be close not another name and if you recognize your name on that book if you conscious in a way your name is in that book notice i'm not talking about your sin and your feelings your past your fault coming i'm not talking about that enough are specifically talking about your name on the book not what you do did or will do oh give the lord some praises people i'm just talking specifically about your name on that book if your name is on that book there was a behavior that connected with your name on that book let's continue an angels swore time shall be no more time no longer what in the days of the voice yeah we gain now how are we connecting to our man the days are the word so this angel has to connect with somebody in the earth the days of the voice and it's more specific of of the seventh angel or seventh messenger when he shall begin to sing say the mighty angel come down you have to give it to somebody he can hold a book for himself you have to use somebody on the earth so this bible identified that the seventh messenger or the seven angel gets that book and then he could speak from that book and we know that seven messengers come to the seventh age oh glory to god not seven a belong to a prophet called malak of malachi for behold i sent you elijah the prophet so god put a prophet to catch the revelation because the word comes in the prophet the book had to come to the prophet we can just get the book just like that oh the lamb himself had to take the book remember no man was found worthy no man involved in that you know the lamb took the pork so only the lamb could give it to a man or give the lord a shout and the man has to be scripturally identified like any man could claim he get the book you have to set up and shut up until he finds scripture for that man and that scripture is a seventh angel messenger and we know that is william murray and bradham there's not another man on earth that fit that role there's not a matter here that fit that spot if it's not william brandon then who it is that's the devil job this is not william branham but who it is is donald trump who it is you can't find another man oh you could look high and low oh glory to god but there's one man fit that and who is the bride come on now give the lord a shout [Applause] some church next door you better know if you are part of this bride because there's only one people could fit that spot gloria they're good i don't know how i'm going to get you here today in here but in the days of the voice seven angel when he shall begin the song the mission of god shall be finished as he had the greatest of the prophets so we get christ mighty angel is not right now we get his messenger the seventh angel messenger of the laodicea revelation 3 verse 14. loudly same age as the messenger of that seventh age coming to the end of the age isn't that right and no it's switching over now hallelujah to his bride hold on come on now i like that come on now come on now hallelujah and the voice which i heard from heaven speaking to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which stand it upon the sea and upon the earth so you know this angel's standing on some some box another another one something just had on some tree is not that one there's the one that foot on the sea and on the land that's the one we're talking about it is very specific which angel are we talking about the one where the little book opened he said go and say unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it that's the commission not from jeffersonville whole glory though not from the medicine association the commission is take it eat it up and again talk about the honey for us you know it talk about the bitterness first no this is true believers here [Music] john represents the bride not church people not jewish folks this is the bride here when they eat it am i reading right he said bitter in the belly butt in my mouth sweet as honey oh glory to you say nice oh glory lord god it taste nice but let it go down let it go down in the inner man let it become part of your being it will be bitter in your belly and he said i took the little book who took the little book true believer the bride the true fightful ministry go we'll go to the angel come on over and take the book the true fightful ministry will be connected to headquarters some man some group somewhere they'll be connected to heaven by means of the angel oh glory to god because the fightful ministry of a commission to go to the engine and take the book and then present the book and ask all glory to god hallelujah my god my god oh hallelujah listen adam had the names the books went back up no christ had the names when they give it to the prophet the prophet of the names i want to preach all them books and tips oh i think god find you the word is what call you your name and when that book come into our fightful what's going to happen next more names being called because he join will be coming from the body oh give the lord a shout the devil's a liar and the devil is finished [Music] [Applause] sons wants to be born from adam malt was spoken word and peter was an example in accent to the house of cornelius sons was sitting there they were gentile sons peter was a jew who came onto his own his own received him not but as mayor received him he was one of them that received christ and he had god in him and he just began to testify of what god was doing all of a sudden why peter was speaking those words the holy ghost somebody said holy ghost the holy ghost fell somebody said fell they don't like to talk about falling out but the holy ghost fell that's what the holy ghost does it has fall on you oh glory to god it fell on cornelius oh give the lord my god my god hallelujah praise god my god it could fall this morning the holy ghost falls as individuals oh glory to god it could fall on you don't use your head this morning oh glory to god be coming from revelation 10. phil these guys never went to church before these guys never even got baptized in jesus name but the holy ghost oh glory to god you know why they were in names was in the book and peter called your name glory to god he spoke the word the word spoke to them and the quickness power them [Music] and after they got the holy ghost there and say i don't need to get baptized in jesus name no they're going to get baptized because the holy ghost follows the words is that right when the angels give me the book he said not what watch i took the book out of the angel's hand ate it up it was my my mouth sweetest honey and as soon as i had eaten it up my belly was bitter and he said unto me though must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings as we know the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy so the true fightful ministry would go to the angel take the book eat the book and if you eat the book you could only prophesy from the book you can't have your own prophecy because the prophecy have to come from the book the book that you have eaten it has to be the same prophecy that is why the key to all what we are saying is the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say will already be said in the word so we are prophesying the same thing and the amplified it said though must prophesy is to bring a fresh prophecy of the same prophecy oh give the lord some shouts do you see it tonight do you see where you fit in no hidden in there is the church member the bible has called it out but it is dear because the church member or by this way the fleshly five-fold they're not going to know angels to take no book chewing it in their mouth and spitting it out taking what they want they have no bitter belly for them them going the easy route hallelujah please everybody i'll disrupt see so what happens when people don't take the book because i could show you in the word that you have to accept it in its fullness of its revelation and vindication you can't take what you want you have to take all of it to show you a true believer you go to a pentecostal you believe the bible yes sir i believe bible you say well what is malakai for behold he said like nah they can't take that try them your body bible yeah i believe i believe the scriptures i believe yeah but let's go to the word malachi 4 behold i sent you elijah is that past or that is to come i do go dear. you don't want to go there because you love the pentagon church but if you're honest you have to say that is the word behold i is not man speaking will send you elijah the prophet before the great and terrible they have the lord so we have to look for elijah either he come when he coming because before the lord come elias must first come oh glory to god you have to be a forerunner for the messiah to come is that right oh my praise the lord you love him this morning isaiah 29. i want to be from the amplified for his name stop and wonder at this prophecy if you choose whether you understand it or not soon you will witness the actual event and be confounded reluctantly blind yourself now if you choose take pleasure and then be blinded at the actual occurrence they are drunk but not with wine the stagger but not from strong drink but from spiritual stupor for the lord had poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep and he has closed your eyes the prophets and your heads and the sears he has covered and muffled and the vision of all this has become for you like the words of a book that is sealed when men give it to one who can can read saying read this he said i pray you he said i can't afford a seal when the book is given to him who is not learning he said read this i pray you he said i cannot read and the lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but remove their hearts and minds far from me and their fear and reverence for me are a commandment of men that is learned by repetition without any thought as to the meaning therefore behold i will again do marvelous things with these people marvelous and astonishing things and the wisdom of the wise men will perish and the understanding of the discernment will vanish or be hidden walk to those who seek to hide deep from the lord the council whose deeds are in the dark who says who sees us who knows us oh my hallelujah oh glory to god they'll be exposed hallelujah because the book is not sealed the book is unsealed so this revelation 10 the place where you'll see your name because the book come down in version 10 to show you your name revelation 10 8-11 a prophecy to go after the prophet that's why he said almost prophesy again because in revelation 10 7 is the prophet here comes the bride with the same prophecy to prophesy again why because the vision is true but the time is long or give the lord some praises you hear what i said the vision is true but the time is long so we can't manufacture anything we have to wait until the real holy spirit comes into the church to manifest his word oh give the lord a shout eve couldn't wait for the revelation of how to multiply and the devil slipping because he didn't want to wait you better learn to wait and you ever scripted his wheat upon the lord shoving you their strength oh my when he cried what happened seven thunders uttered the voices whoo my lord my lord but abraham i see this by the power of the revelation of jesus christ everyone in our adoption in our baptism we have come to a place there is some key that would unlock something here now he saw the book sealed on seven seals and daniel saw the same and when the thunders uttered the voices he said don't write what that was in the scripture listen don't write what it was in the scripture but it will be revealed in the last days we are at that time we are keynes right now oh hallelujah looking for what the key to unlock something now remember danielle was told by the angel daniel heard the seven thunders they were after their voices then they're grabbing saturday right he said don't write it don't write it oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah whatever is a liar hallelujah praise the lord thank you jesus come on give him prisons that's okay i i i don't get shaking my shoulders and thinking you know i just enjoy the show something you know because i want the atmosphere so it's just dead these days you know stone dead you know all they have is a priest then he pulled you know bringing all kind of all kind of talk and information and thing you know no real inspiration and revelation you know oh hallelujah so when i know the sins being quick and hallelujah amen glory your future stand up and walk you raise your hands i know something move it that's not normal you're shouting is not normal everybody sit down get in the door nail glory to the godfather say amen hallelujah this stressful thing there was a liar glory to god i'm going to praise him anyhow i'm going to shout anyhow glory to god if i lose my job yesterday

the back of the book no one could open those teeth and was one and that was them voices here's the bible written which is the mystery itself but on the backside of the bible the revelations as shown to daniel say there is seven voices to be uttered that no man can open no man known what it was but the bible said and he told daniel also john in the last days these seven voices would be known by the real true church so the real true church will preach seven thunders oh give the lord a shout so we can't be afraid of these voices that come on the angel's mouth these are not seven thunders of brother branham you heard where it come from the mouth of the mighty angel they're not seventeen shelters you know this is the mighty angel there's nothing that's from new york you know this is the mighty angel you know they say new york you say thunder is it this is that like every some man when an anointing from the book come upon you it's the same lion anointing you can't stop these men

pull on your platform along the way i want to run a little bit and come back and breathe just turn too small for me you have to believe in himself and his wife and my bible tells me he's tagged that

steal you he can deliver you he can free you [Music] glory he's the same yesterday today on fire he's still open blind eyes he still calls her keeper to walk he still raises the dead he still pop the death air open that you can hear i will never stop believing in that [Music] he still there we go set the captains free you in prison this morning he can open the prison bars and the house of hell

enter into this great place now for joshua they violated the people the inheritance that god has left them what we've seen happen should put every soul in action it should make a church that will make a revival in phoenix and people fighting revival they won't know ever at all because revival will put man out of business that is why they fight in revival it will put their theories and theology and forward teaching revelation messages out of business because revival is a move of god in power god does take man out of the way and the spirit just sweeping back and forth and woman and the sisters can make up their dishes wash the dishes and they can't make up their bed because revival dead only crying sobbing praying oh god they're washing their wheels and they don't drop it down because of glory holy ghost it's all over me and it's keeping me alive it's the holy ghost on fire it's the holy ghost and power it's keeping me alive it's the old time holy spirit the devil won't go near it that's the reason that people fear it but it's good enough for me there's a holy ghost church in our intellectual church nice talking church you can find them but if you come inside i have fire oh glory to god we will break fire till it burn your seat between fire till it get off your bottom and give god some praises will you preach fire till your hands raise up glory [Applause] the pc here should put every soul in action we shall make a church that will make a revival here in phoenix that people would fly from europe to see what's taking place nothing here but the sea there's a place in arizona called maricopa valley a city called phoenix there's something broke out here until the 7 thunders of revelation 10 that's not even wrote and the bible has been manifested let me read it for you there's a place called headstone tabernacle where something broke out there until the seventh thunders of revelation 10 that's not even wrote in the bible it's being manifested okay the lord shall i read it for you i put your name inside it here i put us inside a deer oh glory to god not talking about it but manifesting it oh glory to god let me drop this on you wait till then seven thunders utter their voices to that group that could take the word and hand it there it was nice and cut my god hallelujah hallelujah but over the mighty angels on the earth do you remember she said yes but abandoned the holy spirit today the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word because the holy spirit will only vindicate the word all the angels trying to get you back to is the word not your feelings not your emotions the word let me say it again some of you feel it theory not that again i'll fight fight with who me wrong fight sorry you're in the wrong place i look like satan i look like depressed i look like pope francis you see me with a croc on my head i'm the enemy since went you and you you you're a human is like the devil don't tie you up already are you getting fight really possible guys [Music] i see you and god seeing you too they're going along with you disappear are you still here i will be here for a long time too i ain't gonna sign over this i'll leave anytime soon i am making ready to leave i prepared to make a havoc here and satan's eden oh give the lord a shout oh glory to god come on come on saints come on saints there's a great ministry that lays ahead be part of it ah may be seated spiritual you know why that's exactly what god did he took his covenant seed which the real seed was the promised one true faith to comfort out of isaac comfort christ christ was god's covenant and what he did he took him to calvary just like abraham did his own son a few days afterwards a few days years afterwards after he was born what did he do he took him on calvary here we go he tore him apart he raised his body up on easter morning set him on the right hand of his throne but here we go there's the part now the spirit that was in him he sent back down to the church so the church here we go when this covenant is brought into its full strength hear the words when this covenant is brought into its full strength when the covenant is confirmed with god the church the people that goes into the body here to be his bride specific will be exactly the same spirit that was upon christ doing the same things the same ministry the same power it will come together word by word confirming the covenant what did the mighty angel come down with a rainbow over his head he commented confirmed the covenant with the bride of jesus christ by releasing to you his same life his same spirit his same ministry his ministry was not teaching preaching ministry only i have to get it into you you know because the people have been there long so long with this intellectual teaching thing in this message that they have no expectation whatsoever for power for outpouring for their spirit for miracles for signs for wonders for tongues for speaking in tongues prophecy they have no expertise for that at all all they want is more man more man more man more man we say no man at all we show man the exit we want the mighty angel of revelation 10 1 oh glory to god hallelujah that's the angel we got to go to come on now hallelujah grab the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory glory okay let me see you could wrap up here i really pray that god take the country into normalcy because we we want to see things back to normal do everybody have their own ideas and things and i don't want a good deal but god have mercy we will do all that we can do when we can do it we're going to keep punching and punching as i said already the devil can't get stronger but you can satan has said satan but he don't know who you are hallelujah okay so watch so you're talking about the seven messenger i believe that the seven angel version 10 is the seventh which is messenger of revelation 3 14. he said takes the book and of the seals and breaks them and shows the seven angel for this alone the mysteries of god is the ministry of the seventh angel oh my in the first seal he says no malachi 4 said so others version 10 7 jesus have predicted it at the end of the seventh angels message all the mysteries of god will be known we are the end time the opening of the seventh seal oh hallelujah so hear what he said before that he said now watch after all he has revealed all the six seals he don't see nothing about the seventh seal and and the end time seal when it starts will be a secret only when it starts that's why you say at the finishing of the seventh seal we're supposed to be all the way up there now to know who god is how he lived his being we supposed to know all about him by that time in other words we're supposed to be knowing who we are who god is and who the devil is at definition of the seven seal hallelujah can't be confused oh god in this world right if they're right you can't be dear that will slap you up so your head will go into the right track right right right right right people will deceive you no no no no no because men lying and wait to deceive they're not either no they're waiting for you you're looking to see this you're a slacker you're just member are they ready come come come you've been knowing i'm serious you know god is getting serious once when he put tests on them because danielle didn't do that to impress somebody you know he won't even press them i gotta show them still i know a long time i prayed over because they said i don't i would pray no no it wasn't normal living so he wasn't behaving out of sync this was his behavior his daily living so when they talk about that he said that for me you know this praying to my god that they're defending all together and all my god is able to deliver so he's standing there open pray and there are always them people with to report you in church you know they have come in now reporting to your neighbors to your family who are not even saved so no they can't come to the church at all because you screw up their mind dmd and then church people are you are you going there what are you doing here checking is in the right place you know going to tell people about the church oh god like a wicked boy and then people out there know thinking it's just wicked they may come in here will you come in there hallelujah and god seeing your hypocrisy i am insane words you know i ain't putting on ice cream anything you can need plain as ever there's a pastor in the house oh hallelujah praise god so watch this now when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the bible before knowing that remember version 10 1-7 chapter 10 1-7 at the end of the seventh angel's message all the mysteries of god would be known not some and another business to have to come and reveal the rest of the providence reveal please don't come here with that anytime you're coming with us i'm a big buckshot double bowl crack crack then i blow the smoke off after all the mysteries of god would be known we are the end time the opening of the seventh seal notice revelation 10 1-7 all the mysteries are to be revealed to the bride by the messenger of the lausanne church all we could preach is preach what has already been preached could we give the lord a shout on that we don't have our own message i am not a messenger i ascend my heart seminar quarter is six and under i have no idea we have one messenger to this age and though he gone they say in the days of the voice oh give the lord a shout he is not here the man but the voice is here they can find the same tape they can find the same quote they can find the same word let them move because god spoke hallelujah thank you lord so he said this messenger of malachi 4 revelation 10 7 we're going to do two things quantum malachi 42 in the hearts of the children to the fathers two he revealed the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divine revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers so to go back to the fate of the fathers you had to go to russian 10. connect with the thunders and the thunder is taking you back to the feet of the fathers hallelujah praise god thank you lord i'm going to wrap up now museum please i think i run out of time here time's run now time little longer hey government come on i see you pass the time all right watch this sevenfold book of seven redemption plans has been brought to us that is what this book holds we're going to get over into the 10th chapter where this mighty angel proclaimed something he had a little book that john was had to eat and when he did he cut into his belly it was bitter but in his lips it was sweet i hear the prophet is interpreting it now when you have to digest it then it gets bitter everybody's against you everybody telling you you're holy ruler you're this that you're off your head so it's hard to digest it but when you're testifying of his glory sweeten your lips oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah oh glory to god he get bitter right then he said oh god set some in the church through labor pains and they get tremendous sometimes when a church like hits sometime like this church here is groaning under the persecution of the outside world the outside world is message world believing in the lord jesus that the promise that's the promise of the holy ghost is just as real every one of you here should know the school by heart i preach this ten thousand times i could say the whole thing by her and i said read it but you supposed to do with my heart and anybody challenge it just say this they say this one here and we'll shut them up tell them we are the church here that is growing presidential people like you believing in lord jesus that the promise of the holy ghost that you don't believe in is just as real to us and if you don't want it that's okay i love that because i take it all that you don't want i take it extra too you have any extra idea taken that too oh glory to god watch how they grown and cry under labor pains but when they are born and positionally born into the kingdom of god then the holy ghost are set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists danny given to dear speaking with tongues interpretation wisdom gifts of healing all kinds of things glory to god let me know call the foolish version quickly and we were close brother branham he says if you can't accept the whole word of god the way it is written you won't do it dear he said that only trades your dwelling please it doesn't change you if you're doubting here you've got doubt across there so god the hundred dollars there so take it down here and go stay down here you're not gonna make it over there you have got to accept it in its fullness in the power of its vindication and the revelation of what it is then you become part of it you're talking about part of the bride you have to accept his fullness oh it's revelation and vindication question think oh wrap up this year if the church is saved even though she does not go into the rapture and i believe you're taught she must go to the tribulation for purifying but what about these that are dead how will they be referred is it those that in the bride need no preventation he says now in this rapture in time there will have to come a time that this bride that reject the head part of the bride he's talking about the church there so i say it the way it's supposed to be that the church which reject the head part of the bride will have to suffer for her rejection no he's not talking about pentecost understanding he's talked about message folks because the gospel wasn't made plain to them back there like it's made plain to you today you see it so plain you have done had all those years and examples the seals is open the church is laid out everything like that it's just plain you can't miss it then if you fully reject it there's only one thing to do suffer for it so even if you're suffering his weight mask and social distance diagnosing you know suffering there to come it had three and a half years of that not not two years you know three and a half hallelujah oh my my god so bad i'm talking about they can't wait for the real holy spirit to take the church in position they're going to play something they got to manufacture something work up something watch hear this part christ bride done the same what's the matter can't wait they can't wait they have to manufacture something they can't wait for the holy spirit to come in and get into the church if it had stayed the way it was back under 100 years or 50 years ago when pentecost first started out in this latter day when the world began to be preached if it had stayed like that she probably wouldn't have over 50 members today that's right but they would be blood washed they had the power of god in them the world will be shaken under a tremendous impact of word flesh being spoken word by word oh my i am done today could we all stand and just give god some praises why don't you begin to sing hallelujah thank you jesus glory hallelujah [Music] my jesus [Music] god bless you
