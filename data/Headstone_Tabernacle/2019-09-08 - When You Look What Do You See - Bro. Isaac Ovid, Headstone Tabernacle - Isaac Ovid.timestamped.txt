[1:10:34] revelation me you bless the word and the
[1:10:36] reading of the word we commit this
[1:10:37] service into your hands and the church
[1:10:39] says amen and amen
[1:10:42] I greet you this morning in a precious
[1:10:44] name of Jesus
[1:10:45] I'd like to read the scriptures and then
[1:10:48] I'll give my greeting this morning so
[1:10:51] I'd like to go to four portions of
[1:10:52] scripture reading Jeremiah 5 proverbs 29
[1:10:58] sin John 3 and revelation 1
[1:11:09] Jeremiah 5 and verse 20 declare this in
[1:11:18] the house of Jacob and publish it in
[1:11:22] Judah seeing here now this or foolish
[1:11:24] people and without understanding with
[1:11:26] her eyes and see not which have he ears
[1:11:29] and hear not je not me saith the Lord
[1:11:33] will inna tremble at my presence which
[1:11:36] have placed the sand for the bound of
[1:11:38] the sea by a perpetual decree a
[1:11:41] perpetual is a continuous decree that it
[1:11:45] cannot pass it and though the waves
[1:11:47] thereof toss themselves yet can they not
[1:11:49] prevail though they roar yet can they
[1:11:52] not pass over it but this people have a
[1:11:54] revolting and rebellious heart dear
[1:11:57] revolted and gone neither see they in
[1:11:59] their heart let us now fear the Lord our
[1:12:01] God that give a dream for the former and
[1:12:04] the laughter in his season he reserved
[1:12:06] it unto us the appointed weeks of the
[1:12:08] harvest reading proverbs 29 and verse 18
[1:12:12] where there is no vision the people
[1:12:15] perish but he that keepeth the law happy
[1:12:19] is he sin John 3 and verse 1 there was a
[1:12:24] man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a
[1:12:27] ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus
[1:12:30] by night and said unto him rabbi we know
[1:12:33] that thou art a teacher come from God
[1:12:35] for no man can do these miracles that
[1:12:38] thou doest except God be with him jesus
[1:12:42] answered and said unto Him verily verily
[1:12:43] I say unto thee except a man be born
[1:12:46] again he cannot see the kingdom of God
[1:12:49] and our last reading revelation 1
[1:12:52] reading from verse 1 the revelation of
[1:12:56] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[1:12:59] show unto his servants things which must
[1:13:02] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[1:13:05] signified it by his angel unto his
[1:13:07] servant John who bare record of the word
[1:13:10] of God and of the testimony of Jesus
[1:13:12] Christ and of all things that he saw
[1:13:15] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[1:13:18] hear the words of this prophecy
[1:13:20] and keep those things which are written
[1:13:22] beer in for the time is at hand John to
[1:13:27] the seven churches which I need your
[1:13:30] grace be unto you and peace from him

[1:13:43] Prince of the kings of the earth unto
[1:13:45] him that loved us and washed us from our
[1:13:47] sins in his own blood and it made us

[1:13:52] father to him be glory and Dominion for
[1:13:55] ever and ever amen behold he cometh with
[1:13:58] clouds and every eye shall see him and
[1:14:00] they also which pierced him and all
[1:14:02] Kindred's of the earth shall wail
[1:14:04] because of him even so amen
[1:14:06] may the Lord had a blessing to the
[1:14:08] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:14:11] even so I greet you this morning in the
[1:14:14] precious name of Jesus Christ it's
[1:14:15] certainly a great privilege to be in the
[1:14:17] house of God are you happy to be in the
[1:14:19] house of the Lord this morning amen and
[1:14:22] what a time and a season and I have not
[1:14:26] been here for about two weeks which is a
[1:14:28] rare very rare occurrence it's very
[1:14:31] uncomfortable to not be in the house of
[1:14:32] God not because you're a religious
[1:14:35] person but because there's something
[1:14:37] that pulls you to the word and to
[1:14:39] fellowship and the communion and being
[1:14:42] with the Brethren and in fellowship but
[1:14:44] I had responsibilities new
[1:14:48] responsibilities
[1:14:50] a new ministry present stage of my
[1:14:53] ministry so I'm really happy to be here
[1:14:57] and bring greetings from my wife and my
[1:14:59] daughter
[1:15:02] and both Karen and the baby are doing
[1:15:09] fine and it is it is new it is different
[1:15:16] no amount of books could prepare you for
[1:15:19] this no amount of advice could prepare
[1:15:22] you for this you know why I attended the
[1:15:25] Lamaze classes that did not prepare me
[1:15:28] for this i sat with my father many times
[1:15:31] that did not prepare me for this in in
[1:15:35] comfort they tell you every experience
[1:15:36] is different so that's how you come for
[1:15:38] yourself well my rule is different you
[1:15:40] know but it was a interesting experience
[1:15:44] because I had the opportunity to be in a
[1:15:46] labor room and I was saying to her Ovid
[1:15:49] afterwards i see you know you read a
[1:15:51] quote where the prophet talks about a
[1:15:54] laborer is a boot boot ISA as a messy
[1:15:57] thing and how did she grow into their
[1:16:00] labor pains they get tremendous
[1:16:01] sometimes and as and as preachers you
[1:16:04] read these quotes and you could identify
[1:16:06] with it but being in the labor room
[1:16:08] these tremendous times thinking a whole
[1:16:10] different perspective you see what
[1:16:13] really how how serious it is and and and
[1:16:16] there the nurse said something that
[1:16:18] struck me and she said because the labor
[1:16:20] that Karen had to go to us was quite
[1:16:23] long and I said to her accordingly
[1:16:26] because you have to work because you
[1:16:30] have to work and I'm there and I'm
[1:16:32] trying to be an encouragement and I'm a
[1:16:34] support and but it still work and as
[1:16:38] much of words and encouragement that you
[1:16:41] could put in there I couldn't do the
[1:16:42] work that she had to do and I realized
[1:16:47] that many times we come to church every
[1:16:48] round I would talk about appreciated get
[1:16:50] blue in the face but they still a work
[1:16:54] that that you have to do because the
[1:16:57] minister is doing his work but you still
[1:17:00] have to go to your labor pin you still
[1:17:03] have to go through the process you still
[1:17:05] have to go through the mess there's no
[1:17:06] shortcut there's no bypassing it it is
[1:17:08] just the way God designed it to be
[1:17:11] at one point Karen said to me
[1:17:15] Brina do something pretty do something
[1:17:18] do something so I'm there and I'm
[1:17:21] conflicted because my mind goes back to
[1:17:23] in Pina have childhoods so it's like how
[1:17:26] do you pray because God instituted the
[1:17:28] Pina Capri funny people to go away
[1:17:31] because they you can circumvent the
[1:17:33] process so then we pray become God give
[1:17:36] me the strength to impure and many times
[1:17:41] through our trials we say Lord take the
[1:17:43] pain away but God they're breaking the
[1:17:45] rule because I fell I told at one point
[1:17:47] and say Karen please
[1:17:49] just plain easy but you can't bypass the
[1:17:57] process the process is the process but
[1:18:01] then as the time was cooking now
[1:18:02] remember the prophets see when the woman
[1:18:04] is about to have put a sweet spirit
[1:18:06] comes down and an angel from the
[1:18:08] presence of God drops down to clean this
[1:18:10] life you remember that so I'm a witness
[1:18:13] to this transition that took place to
[1:18:16] see this sweet spirit come down and just
[1:18:18] like enter this child and at that point
[1:18:20] I just broke down in tears Karen it was
[1:18:23] good I said you ever know but something
[1:18:28] happens to you I walked out the room and
[1:18:29] what came over me was a level of
[1:18:32] selflessness because I realized my life
[1:18:36] was even less about myself and more
[1:18:40] about others because I was know had a
[1:18:43] new responsibility all of a sudden I was
[1:18:45] ready to fight but never were in a fight
[1:18:47] before if anybody had come near that
[1:18:48] room he was in trouble because I had a
[1:18:51] new outlook a new responsibility a new
[1:18:55] attitude and when you think about how
[1:18:58] God feels when he calls you and he's
[1:19:00] working on you and when did ever try to
[1:19:03] mess with you the kind of emotion that
[1:19:06] he calls true because he stopped as
[1:19:08] father that anybody could ever have
[1:19:11] and the church here man hallelujah
[1:19:18] they may be seated so I may get in
[1:19:22] trouble for sharing all of this when I
[1:19:24] get back home but I love to let them
[1:19:27] know that I'm I was reported that high
[1:19:29] authority can the church say Amen so I
[1:19:35] have a very simple message this morning
[1:19:37] and before I even go into that I really
[1:19:39] how many appreciate but the riemann
[1:19:41] Thompson's two messages that we heard a
[1:19:45] man coming to church and I was glad when
[1:19:51] they said unto me let us go into the
[1:19:52] house of the Lord what what masterpiece
[1:19:54] of masterpieces hallelujah he was bustin
[1:19:58] left and right and it's the word outside
[1:20:02] of this process people want to bypass
[1:20:04] the process stay in home is not part of
[1:20:06] the process you know you have to come to
[1:20:09] be in the environment
[1:20:10] there's no perfection outside of coming
[1:20:12] to the ministry there's no perfection
[1:20:14] all said I have an apostolate pastillas
[1:20:15] people walking around talking about
[1:20:17] again perfected to go in which rapture
[1:20:18] why else would God say athletes pastors
[1:20:22] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:20:24] scenes feed the stream and perfec
[1:20:25] yourself God is a God of order so I
[1:20:30] really appreciate the messages and then
[1:20:31] how many appreciate by the Congolese
[1:20:32] they were like - I believe Wednesday
[1:20:35] night executions I was their connection
[1:20:37] as like wow contact were loving one time

[1:20:48] find that place to listen and you guide

[1:20:54] business and go say Gideon mighty man of
[1:20:56] Valor I didn't say yes Lord you say who
[1:20:59] me
[1:21:00] so only who means in the church God is
[1:21:03] coming to knock on your door because you
[1:21:05] have a part to play before we leave this
[1:21:07] please the devil may try to write you
[1:21:09] off but you have a part to play and if
[1:21:11] you have a part to play the devil does
[1:21:13] not

[1:21:16] I'm a little bit what a message on
[1:21:18] Wednesday nights my my my my my what a
[1:21:23] masterpiece of a masterpiece for groups
[1:21:26] which one if you haven't heard that
[1:21:28] message me to hear it again and again if
[1:21:31] you heard it listen it again and again
[1:21:33] because you got to know which group you
[1:21:35] belong to because he spoke about a group
[1:21:37] I don't know about you but I can speak
[1:21:39] for me he spoke about a cool names I
[1:21:41] even be removed who names are
[1:21:44] irremovable get names copy blotted out
[1:21:47] kind of the eeriest Oh though he slay me
[1:21:57] yet still I trust him I could go to
[1:22:00] child's I can go to test him I could go
[1:22:02] to ups and downs but my name is on that
[1:22:05] book and because my name is on that book
[1:22:07] the devil better be scared the devil
[1:22:10] better be scared because God had to
[1:22:12] place a power in me to stand in such a
[1:22:15] time Isis and the church Amon o mine
[1:22:24] three may be seated
[1:22:26] so I have a encouragement for you this
[1:22:29] morning and I believe will be a blessing
[1:22:32] to you it's a message that I talked
[1:22:36] about over this morning because you
[1:22:37] didn't know what thought I had I told
[1:22:38] him this is a message you preached a
[1:22:40] long time ago you push it in chi wall so
[1:22:42] I can't remember it but if we shouldn't
[1:22:46] kind of walk many years ago and then I
[1:22:48] believe I took the same text or wrong
[1:22:51] 9899 around this so the Lord placed it
[1:22:54] on my heart to bring it back this
[1:22:56] morning so for a title when you look
[1:23:00] what do you see when you look what do
[1:23:06] you see and I read a number of
[1:23:09] scriptures to build a context because
[1:23:11] Jeremiah spoke of people who had eyes
[1:23:14] but they could not see and by the time
[1:23:17] you reach the book of Revelation they
[1:23:19] said all eyes will see and by the
[1:23:21] Brandon brought to our understanding
[1:23:23] that the words see
[1:23:24] that Jesus used when Nicodemus walked up
[1:23:27] to him was not to see with visualize but
[1:23:29] it was to understand so there's a
[1:23:33] difference between having sight and
[1:23:35] having vision is the difference between
[1:23:36] looking and actually seeing
[1:23:39] can the church say Amen without a vision
[1:23:43] the people perish if you don't have a
[1:23:45] vision for your life your vision for
[1:23:47] your house of vision for your marriage a
[1:23:49] vision for your business a vision for
[1:23:51] your career a vision for what you do
[1:23:53] when you wake up you will Paris and
[1:23:56] Paris thing is not just death in the
[1:23:59] natural that is perishing of your dreams
[1:24:02] perishing of your of what's inside of
[1:24:05] you because without a vision you cannot
[1:24:07] achieve anything and the church is hey
[1:24:09] man you can have eyes and have no vision
[1:24:15] or you can have no eyes and have a
[1:24:18] vision can the church say man there are
[1:24:21] many examples that I mentioned this
[1:24:23] morning
[1:24:24] I've used this before there were two
[1:24:26] salesmen who went somewhere to sell
[1:24:29] shoes but whoever has mentioned many
[1:24:32] times and one guy saw that nobody had
[1:24:35] shoes he looked at the situation he
[1:24:38] looked at the market he said nobody has
[1:24:40] shoes I cannot sell to these people they
[1:24:43] don't wear shoes and he went back to the
[1:24:45] boss and the boss I feel these people
[1:24:48] told wear shoes I've come back home we
[1:24:50] need to find another market I'm not as
[1:24:52] here's one mental scheme area look at
[1:24:54] the same situation and it's like these
[1:24:56] people to rent shoes I can sell
[1:24:57] everybody they looked at the same
[1:25:02] situation they looked at the same
[1:25:05] condition they looked at the same
[1:25:07] problem and they left with two different
[1:25:09] conclusions and that's how life is we
[1:25:12] look and what do you see Oh hallelujah
[1:25:15] can the church amen and the question of
[1:25:22] what we see is also asking another
[1:25:25] question what don't you see
[1:25:30] and that's a deeper question when you
[1:25:34] look what do you see is also asking a
[1:25:36] deeper question when you look what don't
[1:25:38] you see and I would venture to tell it's
[1:25:42] not just morning your success lies in
[1:25:46] what you do not see your failures also
[1:25:51] lie
[1:25:52] and what you do not see I don't have as
[1:25:59] much experience and by the way but I
[1:26:01] have done a few weddings and I've never
[1:26:03] met a couple coming up to the altar who
[1:26:06] don't believe they have seen everything
[1:26:08] enough to convince them that this is the
[1:26:10] best decision to me sometimes only years
[1:26:15] later they say no I didn't really see
[1:26:18] and if I'd only seen what I see no hmm
[1:26:25] if it wasn't for you would let's not go
[1:26:28] there this morning all of your success
[1:26:33] lies and what you do not see all of your
[1:26:37] failures lie and what you do not see
[1:26:40] because if you know that there's a ditch
[1:26:43] day and you do any of you know and you
[1:26:45] go into denies your fall you can't even
[1:26:46] call that failure because you make a
[1:26:48] choice to go to the dish but if you do
[1:26:53] not see there's a bottle and you're
[1:26:54] driving at night and you didn't see the
[1:26:57] pothole and you hit it and you're mash
[1:26:59] of the car you didn't see it you're
[1:27:01] feeling alive and the fact that you did
[1:27:04] not see the pothole that was there so it
[1:27:07] is important to be able to look for the
[1:27:10] right thing I'll give you another
[1:27:11] example can we just talk a little bit
[1:27:14] most people and I was sharing but over
[1:27:17] that in in Joshua is a medikit underwood
[1:27:21] day a night that merit it doesn't mean
[1:27:25] reader that merit it is spend time with
[1:27:30] it and you're thinking in your heart
[1:27:31] you're meditating you're trying to
[1:27:33] figure out how it applies
[1:27:35] you meditate and that's a problem most
[1:27:37] of us because if you think long enough
[1:27:40] about your situation you'll make better
[1:27:42] decisions most people don't think to
[1:27:46] fire a lot
[1:27:47] bicha step toward Sodom and what he did
[1:27:51] not see was the effect on his family
[1:27:55] when not looked at Sodom he saw
[1:27:58] opportunity he saw business prosperity
[1:28:00] he saw he didn't expect to end up in
[1:28:03] trouble he didn't expect to lose his
[1:28:06] wife when he looked he did not see his
[1:28:09] wife not coming out with him somebody
[1:28:11] help me preach this morning that Sodom
[1:28:14] didn't think he was gonna lose some of
[1:28:16] his daughters the men who lived in Sodom
[1:28:21] when you knocked this morning what do
[1:28:25] you see when the British Empire went
[1:28:30] into India there was a problem with the
[1:28:34] king cobra to sneak they had a meeting
[1:28:38] the Solent said let's have a plan to
[1:28:41] deal with these snakes that are around
[1:28:44] the villages so they came out with a
[1:28:48] very good idea let us tell the villagers
[1:28:52] for every snake they kill we'll give
[1:28:55] them a little bit of money plan and
[1:29:02] started the villagers keep bringing
[1:29:04] snakes dead snake collect money dead
[1:29:06] snake collect the money and then
[1:29:08] somebody will just say Whitner if we
[1:29:11] kill out all these things we will have
[1:29:14] no more money to get the British didn't
[1:29:19] see how this was going to unfold so the
[1:29:23] villagers started building cages and
[1:29:25] raising king cobra snakes mine in them
[1:29:28] so they had a distribution line from a
[1:29:33] nice snake farm
[1:29:35] trudi British bring in this snake and
[1:29:38] collect any money so the bridge is same
[1:29:40] but with knotty population has gone now
[1:29:41] but this economy seems to me it seems to
[1:29:45] be a tribe in economy
[1:29:46] when they realized what was happening
[1:29:50] they made another decision let us stop
[1:29:54] paying them for these things so the
[1:29:57] villagers say why are we mining all
[1:29:59] these things if nobody's gonna give us
[1:30:02] money from my name is six so the
[1:30:05] villagers did what they release or
[1:30:07] listenings so the net effect of the
[1:30:12] first decision to the final conclusion
[1:30:14] was an actual doubling of distinct
[1:30:17] population and the point of this is when
[1:30:22] the British sat down to plan out this
[1:30:24] they did not see what the second-order
[1:30:29] and third-order consequences have to or
[1:30:32] will be I'm gonna say a few things this
[1:30:35] morning we're gonna get into the courts
[1:30:38] and suffer worry but I've seen a lot of
[1:30:41] men in the message in church make what I
[1:30:46] call selfish decisions not thinking
[1:30:50] about their families I'm not thinking of
[1:30:54] the second-order consequences of
[1:30:56] decision that they may be called
[1:30:58] intensify enough when you look what do
[1:31:05] you see this one and it depends on what
[1:31:09] you are looking for Samson did not see
[1:31:14] what was going to unfold when he started
[1:31:18] messing around with Delilah he did not
[1:31:22] see his eyes being removed he didn't see
[1:31:28] it if he did he would not have done it
[1:31:30] if you know the trouble you are gonna
[1:31:33] end up in half the stuff that you have
[1:31:35] done or in right now you get out of it
[1:31:37] so fast but it's because we don't see
[1:31:40] where it's gonna end up we continue to
[1:31:43] do nonsense until it gets too late and
[1:31:45] the reality is as the book of Revelation
[1:31:48] says
[1:31:48] eventually you'll see you to them but
[1:31:51] when you do see it it could be too late
[1:31:55] because it's easy to see everything in
[1:31:58] hindsight it's easy to see but I see I
[1:32:01] went wrong there see I went wrong there
[1:32:02] see you went wrong there see you ever
[1:32:04] and you can look at the past and talk
[1:32:06] about what went wrong but what are you
[1:32:08] doing now
[1:32:10] and have you thought about what happens
[1:32:14] when you don't pray in the morning
[1:32:17] because that has consequences have you
[1:32:21] thought of what happens when you don't
[1:32:23] spend enough time with your family have
[1:32:25] you seen the effect of it or will you
[1:32:28] have to wait for five years and see well
[1:32:30] is when you know I see what you was
[1:32:32] talking about anybody in the house this
[1:32:37] morning when you look what do you see we
[1:32:43] make most of our decisions based on what
[1:32:46] we see and somehow we try to filter what
[1:32:52] we can't see or can't understand and
[1:32:55] make me push it to the side because we
[1:32:56] don't want to deal with it so we have
[1:33:00] people who want to go into business they
[1:33:02] only tell you what could go right this
[1:33:06] is how much money we could make this is
[1:33:07] how we could grow this way and they do
[1:33:08] at the top of what you go wrong but if
[1:33:11] you could understand what you go wrong
[1:33:13] it will equip you to make a better plan
[1:33:15] anybody in the house would be this
[1:33:17] morning
[1:33:19] [Applause]
[1:33:28] we are often surprised when we realize
[1:33:32] we did not see something before and it's
[1:33:36] not just in the natural this is also in
[1:33:37] a spiritual and we gonna get it up in a
[1:33:39] bit for the world to make sense to ask
[1:33:42] me we filter many things out we are
[1:33:47] afraid to confront the reality of
[1:33:49] ourselves other people God or walk with
[1:33:54] God and we accept what we think to be
[1:33:56] okay because we'd already see the
[1:33:58] consequences and the potential
[1:34:02] consequences can the church say Amen
[1:34:08] when you look this morning what do you
[1:34:12] see
[1:34:14] do the names Shinhwa Shafaat ego party
[1:34:19] gari el gari

[1:34:41] are you know these men you may not know
[1:34:50] that name but you know them because they
[1:34:53] were leaders in the Bible in it you
[1:34:56] don't remember their names because they
[1:34:58] looked at something and saw all the
[1:35:01] wrong things Helen Keller who was buying
[1:35:05] you remember Helen Keller was once axe
[1:35:08] is there anything worse than not having
[1:35:10] your sight and she said yes there is
[1:35:13] it's having sight but having no
[1:35:15] efficient these men's names and I just
[1:35:20] read are not well-known today because
[1:35:22] each of them had great sight but they
[1:35:25] had no vision anybody knows who I'm
[1:35:27] talking about yet the children of Israel
[1:35:30] had just left Egypt they are heard about
[1:35:33] this Promised Land for a long time they
[1:35:36] are heard about how good Island is
[1:35:38] there's everybody milk and me honey I'm
[1:35:41] get heard about all the possibilities of
[1:35:43] the land I'm just at the point when they
[1:35:47] were supposed to enter in they came
[1:35:50] together to a point
[1:35:51] 12 liters 12 of these Sharples soldiers
[1:35:55] 12 of the best men from each tribe
[1:35:57] didn't pick people who were not solid
[1:35:59] any wood and then pick people who were
[1:36:01] backsliders to pick the best out of 12
[1:36:03] tribes those 10 names I called Willie 10

[1:36:09] Joshua and Caleb and all 12 went and tcd
[1:36:15] groups all 12 went and eat of the milk
[1:36:18] and honey
[1:36:19] all 12 came back and City land is good
[1:36:22] but 10 an emergency listen riccati when
[1:36:27] we look at it we see too much enemies we
[1:36:31] see too much diets we see too much
[1:36:34] problems we see too much obstacles we
[1:36:36] not see any land and I'm gonna know but
[1:36:38] the problems are too much the battle is
[1:36:41] gonna be too fierce we can take it on
[1:36:44] trust for who spend more time because a
[1:36:46] long time they eat grapes like this it's
[1:36:49] been a longer time is a long time they
[1:36:51] then have this come back late in time to
[1:36:54] see the people depressed and they say
[1:36:55] wait a minute what does he cry I hear
[1:36:57] inside of here we are more than able to
[1:36:59] go up right now we don't need we'd ever
[1:37:01] need to get ready we go up right now we
[1:37:05] are able to go up right now we went
[1:37:07] through too much to reach here to go
[1:37:09] back now we are ready we are we're able
[1:37:11] to go up right now and this for what the
[1:37:16] others did not see when you look this
[1:37:18] morning do you see the possibility of
[1:37:20] revival when you look this morning are
[1:37:23] you looking at your problems and your
[1:37:25] situations who are you looking at what
[1:37:27] God said because just one he left this
[1:37:30] for the land they saw the evidence and
[1:37:33] the nothing was gonna move them and the
[1:37:36] church seemed and
[1:37:37] how I feel this morning I'm looking at
[1:37:40] holy enemy has pushed people back
[1:37:42] against the wall but I don't see that
[1:37:44] I'm looking at it but I see you stronger
[1:37:47] than you realize I look and I see some
[1:37:50] of your children nothing here but I'm
[1:37:51] not seeing that I'm seeing them being
[1:37:53] deliver I'm seeing them being restored
[1:37:56] I'm so come on now Oh hallelujah
[1:38:02] hallelujah every day I'm looking I'm
[1:38:06] waiting to see the manifestation of this
[1:38:08] glorious gospel the world might look at
[1:38:11] you one way and you might even see
[1:38:12] yourself one way but we want to find out
[1:38:15] this morning how does God see us because
[1:38:18] if we could just see what God sees it'll
[1:38:20] change our whole perspective it'll
[1:38:22] change to walk it'll change our talk
[1:38:25] because God doesn't look the way we look
[1:38:27] God doesn't see the way we see because
[1:38:30] he knows the end and he knows the
[1:38:31] beginning and he knows what he did we're
[1:38:34] back before there was a moon we're back
[1:38:36] before there was a star and you wrote
[1:38:38] some names in the book when you look
[1:38:41] what do you see maybe you're not seeing
[1:38:43] everything this morning but from the
[1:38:45] word may your spiritual eyes open up
[1:38:48] that you can see what I'm seeing and you
[1:38:51] can see what a prophet saw somebody say
[1:38:55] man you may be seated
[1:38:58] Oh in the Bible one time the Syrian army
[1:39:01] we're having a hard time dealing with it
[1:39:03] universe regular story whenever they
[1:39:06] made a plan brother Anthony to attack
[1:39:09] Israel somehow Israel always knew where
[1:39:12] they were coming from Israel knew what
[1:39:15] direction they were coming from Israel
[1:39:16] knew how many people they were coming
[1:39:18] with Israel knew what weapons they were
[1:39:21] bringing nothing seemed to be working to
[1:39:23] be able to see Israel and the king of
[1:39:25] Syria so what is going on is this
[1:39:28] somebody among us who is going and tell
[1:39:31] the children of Israel what our plans
[1:39:33] are you know the story and this is your
[1:39:38] majesty
[1:39:39] I get to break the news to you I don't
[1:39:41] know how we getting around this one over
[1:39:43] this one
[1:39:44] this one we never had to deal with this
[1:39:46] before but whenever we have a planning
[1:39:48] meeting a strategy meeting to take out
[1:39:51] it's showing of Israel there's a profit
[1:39:53] in the land named Elijah he has the
[1:39:56] ability to step into this room and see
[1:40:00] what's going on and no weapon that we
[1:40:02] could ever use ever form a spark and
[1:40:06] stem and I want to tell you this morning
[1:40:08] when I wasn't ever gathers his demons
[1:40:11] man against you there's an angel on the
[1:40:14] ground who is able to cause that ring
[1:40:18] somebody please back to me
[1:40:21] somebody please watch for me this
[1:40:23] morning and you know what you may be
[1:40:26] seated
[1:40:26] they couldn't see Lysa when he was
[1:40:29] moving through their meeting room they
[1:40:31] couldn't see Lysa
[1:40:32] when he was taking notes or so this is
[1:40:34] where you're coming from and this is how
[1:40:36] you want to take me out and this is what
[1:40:38] he's trying to do he likes her couldn't
[1:40:40] be seen but God open his eyes so he can
[1:40:43] see what was going on that's why the
[1:40:46] Bible can say no weapons for against you
[1:40:48] could ever prosper
[1:40:52] somebody please flat to me this morning
[1:40:58] you may be seated the definition of
[1:41:07] strategy is away systematically and
[1:41:11] deliberately move from point A to point
[1:41:13] B with the objective of solving a
[1:41:16] problem it is incomprehensible to me if
[1:41:21] the Syrian army is dealing with an enemy
[1:41:25] who could see the plans and the best
[1:41:29] plan that they can come up with is let
[1:41:33] us go and kill him every man seeing all
[1:41:40] your plans you listen you see a common
[1:41:45] but totally blind literally blind so the
[1:41:49] Syrian army leaves information after
[1:41:53] defeat after defeat after defeat after
[1:41:56] defeat after defeat they have nothing on
[1:41:58] this video record the completely
[1:42:00] defeated record but it's still coming
[1:42:02] that's what the devil is no defeat after
[1:42:04] defeat buddy still coming until he came
[1:42:08] to Sunday morning maybe like this one
[1:42:10] and I don't know I don't know what it
[1:42:11] was Elijah woke up he likes a stretch
[1:42:15] Elijah
[1:42:16] turn on the stove and put some water to
[1:42:19] boil he was feeling some coffee with
[1:42:22] prema and some other up
[1:42:25] [Music]
[1:42:26] Elijah's had to put crack some eggs and
[1:42:29] cut up some Tomatoes to make an omelet
[1:42:31] and he knows what happening but this one
[1:42:34] move a man of God he's had to turn me up
[1:42:36] left open turn it around make sure that
[1:42:42] with me please in the meantime as little

[1:43:23] tell me you see because I can see what
[1:43:27] you're not seeing that's why I could I
[1:43:29] can feel this way this morning that's
[1:43:32] why I can worship just way this morning
[1:43:34] because I've seen what you cannot see
[1:43:38] when you look this morning what do you
[1:43:41] see Church of the Living God
[1:43:43] and that boy ran outside and this speed
[1:43:46] here on out here unbroken he realize
[1:43:49] they are for us I don't know where they
[1:43:52] come from I don't know who they are but
[1:43:55] they are on our side there are more for
[1:43:57] us than against us
[1:44:03] and the church say man I pray this
[1:44:06] encourages you this morning when you
[1:44:11] look what do you see what do you see
[1:44:15] this morning I am encouraged and I'm
[1:44:17] compelled to tell you I don't care what
[1:44:20] you have done how God sees you it's
[1:44:22] different from how your husband sees you
[1:44:24] different mom how your wife sees you
[1:44:26] different my how your co-workers see you
[1:44:30] can we just talk this morning
[1:44:33] the Bible said Jesus had me it's passed
[1:44:38] by Samaria we know the story but I want
[1:44:41] to connect it this morning and he went
[1:44:44] before this woman came he didn't go by
[1:44:47] accident he went there because this
[1:44:51] woman's name her name her name was
[1:44:58] written in the book nobody knew it she
[1:45:03] didn't even know it and she chose to go
[1:45:06] at a time when nobody else was there she
[1:45:10] couldn't look at herself because she
[1:45:13] didn't feel good about herself she was
[1:45:15] bothered by how people looked at her how
[1:45:18] do I know you may be seated if she was
[1:45:21] not bothered by how people looked at her
[1:45:23] she would have gone when everybody else
[1:45:25] was but clearly it bothered her that she
[1:45:29] waited till the good people tell the
[1:45:32] church people tell the nice people will
[1:45:35] finish taking their water and when
[1:45:38] nobody else was looking because she was
[1:45:40] ashamed don't tell me she was ashamed
[1:45:42] she was ashamed
[1:45:44] Oh God but she moved to the water and
[1:45:48] she met a different kind of man a
[1:45:50] different kind of man
[1:45:52] a man who could see what she couldn't
[1:45:55] see me
[1:45:56] a man could see deeper than she could
[1:45:58] ever see and that man open the pies when
[1:46:07] you look what do you see this morning do
[1:46:11] you look at your physical condition and
[1:46:13] say this is my portion I'm sick or do
[1:46:15] you see the healing do you see the
[1:46:18] healing I was reading the profitable see
[1:46:20] any may be seated
[1:46:21] many times people come to the prayer
[1:46:22] line and after two days it gets worse
[1:46:25] you see that's when you have to see that
[1:46:28] the healing is in its way that's really
[1:46:30] gonna see that God is working its way up
[1:46:32] you've got to keep seeing with the
[1:46:34] spiritual eyes of it every decision has
[1:46:46] consequences seen an unseen seen and
[1:46:54] unseen but a better peace many
[1:46:57] messengers look into the unseen you know
[1:47:00] it put on spiritual eyes like Joe has a
[1:47:06] spiritual eyes to see what a natural
[1:47:09] eyes cannot see Jesus was tired so tired
[1:47:15] that they had to lift him and the Bible
[1:47:18] in the King James was used carried him
[1:47:20] to the boat and in the translation
[1:47:21] carried men physically lift I would you
[1:47:23] take a picture that for a minute the man
[1:47:27] who could break bread break fish and
[1:47:30] feed 5,000 the man who had stand at the
[1:47:34] grave of Lazarus and say Lazarus comfort
[1:47:37] was now so tired that he couldn't carry
[1:47:41] himself to the boat
[1:47:42] but the disciples had to physically lift
[1:47:44] Jesus have you been so tired at you fact
[1:47:49] that you had to be lifted Jesus was so
[1:47:54] tired that he had to the boat so tired
[1:47:57] that the devil tried to take a chance
[1:48:00] because Jesus had broken his pattern
[1:48:03] and I was heading towards the city of
[1:48:06] Gandhara which is over the water which
[1:48:08] was a city that the Jews never went to
[1:48:10] because it was a Gentile city was an
[1:48:12] unclean City they raised pigs in that
[1:48:14] city it was not a place at Peter and
[1:48:16] James and John and his brothers would
[1:48:17] have ever gone to but you said take me
[1:48:19] there and it was asleep because he was
[1:48:23] seeing what they could not see but Roman
[1:48:30] said something powerful reading from the
[1:48:32] Prophet about that group who would have
[1:48:35] access an opportunity because they
[1:48:37] treated the bride right I set about over
[1:48:42] this morning we don't know who Breit is
[1:48:45] so how could I take the risk of treating
[1:48:47] anybody bad it's too great of a risk the
[1:48:54] risk is too high don't risk is too high
[1:49:00] [Applause]
[1:49:01] that's why better man said I respect the
[1:49:04] garbageman I respect the milkman there
[1:49:08] are people in the message who don't want
[1:49:10] to talk to because they're unbelievers
[1:49:12] how you're not told you not know they're
[1:49:13] bright
[1:49:19] sometimes you have a witness come to
[1:49:21] people's houses and evening my son they
[1:49:22] run them vote for me I know they would
[1:49:26] you don't know that's bright
[1:49:29] at least they're going wrong testify and
[1:49:31] when less of you testified because the
[1:49:34] Prophet said if you don't testify you're
[1:49:36] find yourself back sitting you will not
[1:49:38] see it right now but that's the
[1:49:39] direction you're gonna get into if you
[1:49:41] can see what he sees he sees you back
[1:49:43] sitting because you're not testifying to
[1:49:44] anybody anybody in the house is Smalling
[1:49:47] [Applause]
[1:49:50] when you look what do you see this
[1:49:54] morning Jesus saw a man who had a legion
[1:50:00] his name was not Legion he had a legion
[1:50:02] of demons and Jesus saw beyond that a
[1:50:06] man who would tear his clothes off
[1:50:09] Jesus saw beyond his activity and saw
[1:50:13] into his heart
[1:50:14] saw into his need saw his cry when you
[1:50:18] look what do you see let's bring it
[1:50:19] closer to home the Bible doesn't tell us
[1:50:22] really what day it was but there was a
[1:50:28] group of people gathered I can imagine
[1:50:30] someone hiding in the shadows some were
[1:50:33] crying as they led Stephen into the
[1:50:38] courtyard to stone him for heresy
[1:50:44] blasphemy coming against the
[1:50:49] understanding of the wood that the
[1:50:52] Pharisees and the Sadducees and the e
[1:50:54] seems have possessed and they're
[1:50:57] presiding over this stoning this killing
[1:51:00] is a man who the Bible call of Pharisee
[1:51:03] of Pharisees whose name was soil a man
[1:51:09] of conviction a man so convinced that he
[1:51:12] was right he was willing to kill for it
[1:51:14] and he stood there looking at Stephen
[1:51:18] being killed Stephen looked up he said a
[1:51:23] few words and he died and I can imagine
[1:51:25] all the people who were there saw this
[1:51:28] man saw and I can imagine the emotions
[1:51:31] it
[1:51:35] this man killed deacon Stephen this man
[1:51:42] made the decision stood him to see how
[1:51:50] God has operate totally different from
[1:51:52] us God chose to not reveal to anybody
[1:51:55] who this man Saul was in fact the
[1:51:59] Prophet said on the road to Damascus as
[1:52:01] Saul was about to do more damage God
[1:52:04] interrupted soil with a pillar of fire
[1:52:06] and when everyone said the others around
[1:52:08] so didn't even see it to show that God
[1:52:12] is such an individual card with who he
[1:52:15] allows to see no one he said he hid it
[1:52:17] from the eyes of the wise and anybody in
[1:52:21] the house is snoring Bible goes on to
[1:52:30] see that when Saul became Paul and by
[1:52:35] the proper went brother Paul came to
[1:52:37] church you know they had a better real
[1:52:39] fight it was not your fight it was not
[1:52:45] like and God had to take them through
[1:52:48] the process and go ahead to elevate
[1:52:51] Paul's ministry to such an undefeatable
[1:52:55] level that those brothers who had
[1:52:59] witnessed this had to acknowledge it had
[1:53:01] to be good
[1:53:02] [Applause]
[1:53:04] I can imagine when Paul Lewis Camus it
[1:53:08] was never there so I had to try this
[1:53:14] bird see this right all kinds of
[1:53:17] thoughts would have gone through this
[1:53:19] brother no doubt Stephen had friends
[1:53:22] maybe family we don't know who save
[1:53:24] listen if so legacy spoiled but a soul
[1:53:26] boy I don't know what I wanna call him
[1:53:27] because I know he was like we caught
[1:53:30] meself all know when you'll is this all
[1:53:35] poor fella it just shows that an enemy
[1:53:44] time God is looking at this as a star in
[1:53:46] his hand before the foundation what is
[1:53:51] one of these stars in the right hand of
[1:53:53] God and the church people didn't know I
[1:54:05] believe is where the Terri was
[1:54:06] exhausting some time ago and he said but
[1:54:08] the Branham was standing in a pulpit and
[1:54:10] the minister said that they thought he
[1:54:12] was just another minister
[1:54:14] they were looking but what did they see
[1:54:20] when you come to church and when you
[1:54:23] look what do you see I'm not speaking a
[1:54:29] group nobody was an individual it
[1:54:32] doesn't matter who God places in the
[1:54:34] pulpit and for whatever time or how he
[1:54:36] uses them that's God he makes the call
[1:54:40] as I heard somebody seriously I'm just a
[1:54:43] mailman oh no this message is from God
[1:54:47] you have a problem in a message to
[1:54:49] infects with me I am just delivering I
[1:54:51] just deliver any package when the word
[1:54:54] say husband love your wife look FX with
[1:54:56] me why reverence your husband don't get
[1:54:59] next with me cheering obey your parents
[1:55:01] or their backs with me come to church on
[1:55:03] time dog FX should be this is just me
[1:55:05] delivering messages sending whatsapp
[1:55:07] messages to you to remind you of this
[1:55:09] journey that we on
[1:55:10] and you're supposed to be in the house
[1:55:11] of God dog FX with me and the church say
[1:55:16] Amen but when you look what do you see
[1:55:19] because if you want to see faults and
[1:55:21] mistakes it have plenty but the Raymond
[1:55:25] spoke about it you want to let your
[1:55:27] experience be based on what you see with
[1:55:29] somebody who is an unbeliever or a big
[1:55:31] believer and you do so turn off these
[1:55:34] church people is just people when you
[1:55:36] look what do you see when you look into
[1:55:39] the world how do you and I know because
[1:55:42] it's making your calling and your
[1:55:43] election show chemicals amen so we care
[1:55:48] for this morning with how you look at
[1:55:50] things and how you look at people can
[1:55:53] the church say Amen and be careful not
[1:56:00] just with what you see but what you
[1:56:02] don't see Samson did not see where his
[1:56:07] journey was going to end up he thought
[1:56:09] he could have played the game until he
[1:56:12] lost everything
[1:56:19] can the church same
[1:56:22] [Music]
[1:56:23] this is a message Rita ponder and to
[1:56:27] reflect when Goliath appeared King soil
[1:56:37] all of the Philistines they looked and
[1:56:40] they saw and what this looked and this
[1:56:45] or send them into an immediate fetal
[1:56:50] position all of the trained men curl up
[1:56:54] turn their backs they will not seen him

[1:57:14] King Saul himself didn't wanna go when
[1:57:20] David came to them he looked as if he
[1:57:24] wasn't fit to be in the army but about
[1:57:25] him said that he come to bring reasons
[1:57:29] but about him said to his brothers and
[1:57:31] delivered his reasons and him he gave
[1:57:33] him his reasons and they run him they
[1:57:35] say who my name is sheep we're doing

[2:03:53] marriage
[2:03:53] heavy struggle in your house he may be
[2:04:02] seated
[2:04:02] I told a simple message simple message
[2:04:08] one thing you'll get a tsunami necklace
[2:04:11] is a it's a well prepared package God
[2:04:13] has blessed us with different gifts
[2:04:16] listen to Padova's mission on Wednesday
[2:04:18] night that was a Sunday message but God
[2:04:21] allowed it to be on Wednesday night this
[2:04:27] is just a little appetizer I was strong
[2:04:29] meat when you look what do you see
[2:04:39] genuine of Israel about to go into the
[2:04:42] Promised Land Jeffersons are two spies
[2:04:47] to go and look at Jericho and the only
[2:04:52] place they can find refuge is by the
[2:04:56] house of a harlot
[2:04:57] whose name was rehab when the people of
[2:05:02] Jericho looked at her she was a harlot
[2:05:05] this is not now describing her to
[2:05:08] believers this these are all even
[2:05:11] looking at her and seeing her as a
[2:05:13] harlot
[2:05:14] but because listen because she treated
[2:05:19] these men right
[2:05:20] [Applause]
[2:05:24] because she treated them right and give
[2:05:29] them logic when they had to have it give
[2:05:34] them refuge when they have to hand those
[2:05:39] men were in a position to give her life
[2:05:41] and say we can not come we coming but
[2:05:46] hang this red cord outside of your
[2:05:49] window and all our people know because
[2:05:53] when we came out of Egypt we were told
[2:05:55] about a red streak on all of our houses
[2:05:58] so they know what this means
[2:06:01] they know this means Redemption they
[2:06:04] know this means salvation
[2:06:06] this means them come on somebody help me
[2:06:09] this morning and not only that bring
[2:06:16] your family in with you it's to you and
[2:06:21] your children to them bring your family
[2:06:23] because when we come we wag not
[2:06:25] everything but for everything that's
[2:06:27] underneath this blood cord underneath
[2:06:29] this spoken yet shall not pass your me
[2:06:32] yet shall not come nigh thee how much I
[2:06:36] say man and I wonder maybe maybe because
[2:06:47] their chickens are believers they've
[2:06:50] never ever not been chickens the
[2:06:51] believers they left Egypt whole bunch of
[2:06:54] people I wanna kill a bunch of make it
[2:06:55] anyway thought I would listen the data
[2:06:57] like Egypt the order they do believe is
[2:06:59] I believe but it's coming out so they
[2:07:05] all left well George just thinking they
[2:07:06] were going through I was not alone
[2:07:07] nobody left Egypt saying I will die he
[2:07:10] will listen it is their unbelief and
[2:07:14] here is Benina that sentence and the
[2:07:16] decimal because God charged them all the
[2:07:22] 10 spies were judged for the evil report
[2:07:24] the people were judged for accepting the
[2:07:26] evil report above the promised would
[2:07:31] so that's my judgment will be getting
[2:07:34] this active area both to the preachers
[2:07:36] and people really received the preachers
[2:07:38] I was sharing with a minister last night
[2:07:40] I said the problem is that people follow
[2:07:43] ministries above the wood and that is
[2:07:49] the fatal flaw because at Universal they
[2:07:52] had the wood they had even scripts on
[2:07:54] Iran them spy just went to just confirm
[2:07:56] what he knew already you know it was a
[2:07:58] new information they were going to
[2:07:59] collect it was verification of can we go
[2:08:02] now or should we go tomorrow shall we go
[2:08:03] tonight exactly what time to resettle
[2:08:05] move things into the into our property
[2:08:07] that was the conversation so these
[2:08:12] people had the word didn't knew it was
[2:08:13] theirs and it's always embarrassing
[2:08:15] after God take it through the Red Sea
[2:08:18] after go take it true swim and
[2:08:20] wilderness and please and I've only
[2:08:22] reached not a doubt so I can imagine a
[2:08:29] certain like connect rehab back in this
[2:08:31] thing
[2:08:31] maybe there is somebody who has seen
[2:08:33] this Jerry Cole DD all they bring up any
[2:08:37] camp I'm not sure about it a you know
[2:08:41] he's like I don't know
[2:08:42] alright once she's there I'm here I'm
[2:08:44] good yes to let her come you know some
[2:08:46] people have you know church folk when
[2:08:58] they look they may have seen a lot of
[2:09:00] her resume or her job description or
[2:09:02] whatever it was but little did they know
[2:09:04] that this simple lady was gonna marry a
[2:09:08] general and out of her line was gonna be
[2:09:12] a man named obey who was gonna be got
[2:09:15] Jessie who was gonna have a man called
[2:09:17] dizzy and alter the line of David was
[2:09:20] gonna come one who would be called a
[2:09:22] messiah
[2:09:24] when you look what do you see how could
[2:09:27] you write off anybody I just became my
[2:09:31] poet when you look what do you see how
[2:09:34] could you write off anybody did know
[2:09:36] that I want this should give everybody
[2:09:47] encouragement this morning that if you
[2:09:49] are willing now listen carefully the
[2:09:52] issue is not God could yes yes 15 of you
[2:09:55] pass but you have to be willing to leave
[2:09:57] it there you can't continue down you're
[2:10:01] part of foolishness and expect God to
[2:10:02] keep blessing you the issue is this
[2:10:05] however colorful your past may have been
[2:10:07] he's able to turn it as white as snow if
[2:10:11] y'all wanted to repent and repent me to
[2:10:13] change your behavior
[2:10:14] the change you are thinking the change
[2:10:16] what you understand it what you see
[2:10:18] let's see what you go after canach it's
[2:10:20] a man there's a few one I'm done I'm not
[2:10:24] gonna be too long with you we know what
[2:10:28] Moses looked out the window where the
[2:10:32] man talked about it
[2:10:33] Pharaoh looked out the window and
[2:10:35] Pharaoh saw mud daubers but Moses or
[2:10:40] people that good rumen but there was
[2:10:46] something about them that just stood at
[2:10:48] his heart but till he couldn't take it
[2:10:49] no more when he looked what did he see
[2:10:55] from the message the 6-volt purpose of
[2:11:01] Gabriel's visit to Daniel this is where
[2:11:03] they've done it he was making an end of
[2:11:05] symptom how could he do anything else
[2:11:07] but forgive them talking about Jesus
[2:11:09] knowing that he had to blind the eyes
[2:11:11] talking with the Jews that we could come
[2:11:14] in it's like his own children calling
[2:11:19] for his blood and they were blinded and
[2:11:21] he knew they were blinded that's the
[2:11:24] reason he cried for forgiveness for them
[2:11:26] forgive them father they don't know what
[2:11:29] they're doing
[2:11:30] they were blind for our sick they were
[2:11:34] me blind so they were looking at Jesus
[2:11:38] and they couldn't even see that he was a
[2:11:41] fulfillment of every prophecy from any
[2:11:44] prophet that have gone us not because
[2:11:47] they were ignorant not because they were
[2:11:49] unlearned but God thinking of the
[2:11:52] grafting of the chan type branch
[2:11:54] blinded them blinded them so they could
[2:11:58] not see them so that we could see him he
[2:12:01] came for you he came for me in garden
[2:12:06] with all their sight to see who he was
[2:12:09] we wouldn't stand a chance we will have
[2:12:11] no hope in the world he would have come
[2:12:14] and gone and we would have not ever been
[2:12:16] but because of us he painted eyes of the
[2:12:20] Jews so that they wouldn't see him that
[2:12:23] they were mocking him I laugh at him and
[2:12:25] he include all of that for our sake for
[2:12:29] our sake for you and for me a few weeks
[2:12:34] ago I wrote down the words he came for
[2:12:36] me he came for me he came for me I
[2:12:45] wanted to say those words he came for me
[2:12:48] that's a revelation friends he came for
[2:12:51] me he blinded the eyes of the Jews at
[2:12:55] those spiritual men there were people
[2:12:57] who were looking for Messiah and when he
[2:12:59] walked in front of them they could not
[2:13:01] see him because he didn't want them to
[2:13:03] he said not yet not yet not yet not yet
[2:13:08] there are people that need to see me
[2:13:10] before I get on field and I'll cover
[2:13:12] your eyes I'll come back for you I come
[2:13:15] back to my people you are my people
[2:13:17] but there's another branch there's
[2:13:20] another people there's a Gentile group
[2:13:22] that I love them also and I can't put
[2:13:25] them all so the blood I shed is for you
[2:13:28] but it's for them also I need
[2:13:30] all up on you for a minute to go get
[2:13:33] them
[2:13:33] I came for them I came for you but I
[2:13:38] came for them what love what Greece oh
[2:13:43] Jesus better balance it in their
[2:13:45] unbelief they did it when they were
[2:13:47] crying for Jesus's blood it was their
[2:13:51] unbelief and their unbelief mustard even
[2:13:54] their fault it wasn't their fault
[2:13:58] God was hiding what was going on from
[2:14:00] them hiding what is going on from the
[2:14:02] devil hiding what is going on because of
[2:14:05] some individuals who weren't even born
[2:14:07] yet some individuals who never stood a
[2:14:10] chance because they were never born from
[2:14:13] the loins of Abraham but they will
[2:14:15] because seeds of Abraham they will not
[2:14:18] have his direct bloodline but it would
[2:14:20] be a spiritual bloodline they would be
[2:14:23] able to claim benefits they would be
[2:14:26] able to claim benefits Oh hallelujah
[2:14:30] when you look what do you see this
[2:14:32] morning do you see the sacrifice he made
[2:14:35] listen so I want to present to you two
[2:14:39] sacrifices this is not a doctrine now
[2:14:42] but Jesus sacrifice his son and he
[2:14:46] sacrificed his own people for our sake
[2:14:49] I wanted to register a minute friends he
[2:14:53] sacrificed his own son and he sacrificed
[2:14:55] his people even seeing him it must have
[2:14:58] been painful these were the people he
[2:15:02] had protected from Egypt to the promised
[2:15:04] land to the Babylonians and the Persians
[2:15:07] and the Medes and the Romans and the
[2:15:09] Greeks and he carried them through and
[2:15:10] when he finally arrived he said I can't
[2:15:12] let you see me in so much of a Nicodemus
[2:15:19] came and said what shall a man do he
[2:15:21] said unless you born again you cannot
[2:15:23] see the kingdom you can't even
[2:15:27] understand this you can't even
[2:15:29] experience this without a new birth
[2:15:32] God had the chest a handful of people to
[2:15:36] lay a platform for these church ages to
[2:15:39] unfold pizza James John all of them
[2:15:42] stood there what they were doing they
[2:15:44] were waiting for Paul to get into his
[2:15:45] place because he had been a messenger
[2:15:48] after for this age and gotta pick
[2:15:51] somebody out of the group that was
[2:15:53] around him who was that even connected
[2:15:56] with the group that was around him
[2:15:57] because his ministry was not to the
[2:16:00] people who around him he was to want to
[2:16:02] go to the Corinthians to the Ephesians
[2:16:05] somebody reached back to me this morning
[2:16:08] [Applause]
[2:16:12] and when our prophet Kim he said that
[2:16:15] Paul was the gold standard he said there
[2:16:18] was never a prophet like on the Paul
[2:16:20] when our prophet Kim he said that was
[2:16:23] the gold standard that was his tender
[2:16:25] for the Alpha Church and when our
[2:16:26] prophet Kim he was the greatest prophet
[2:16:29] to ever walk and he sent a message to
[2:16:31] tie up all the loose ends to bring up
[2:16:34] the closing of the Gentile dispensation
[2:16:37] and to hand the baton back to the shoes
[2:16:40] again oh come on now when you look at
[2:16:43] this great gospel what you see when you
[2:16:46] look how it's dripping with blood do you
[2:16:48] see the sacrifice that Jesus made for
[2:16:51] you and me do you see the sacrifice that
[2:16:53] Peter James trying to choose their
[2:16:55] families made for this bride to be where
[2:16:58] we are this morning it's not by chance
[2:17:01] it's not by accident but called so all
[2:17:04] of this unfold before you even born
[2:17:07] before you made a mistake before you
[2:17:10] fell in sin before you committed
[2:17:12] fornication
[2:17:13] before you fell into adultery before you
[2:17:15] knew who he was
[2:17:16] he knew your name before you knew his
[2:17:20] name he knew your name you
[2:17:23] see him but he could have seen you when
[2:17:27] you lock this morning what do you see
[2:17:31] [Applause]
[2:17:33] [Music]
[2:17:34] [Applause]
[2:17:35] [Music]
[2:17:37] [Applause]
[2:17:39] come on now come on now young brother
[2:17:42] young sister can you see what I see this
[2:17:45] morning I see chains breaking I see
[2:17:48] scales falling off of eyes and sworn
[2:17:53] [Applause]
[2:18:07] that's why the prophets and those who
[2:18:10] were crying for Jesus blood they will
[2:18:13] always forgive him
[2:18:14] that's why I said forgive them because
[2:18:18] they don't know what they're doing they
[2:18:20] don't understand they don't see what's
[2:18:23] happening they didn't know I had to put
[2:18:25] them on pause put them on pause for a
[2:18:28] while
[2:18:29] put them on pause for a while because I
[2:18:31] have to pick up this other group of
[2:18:33] people who didn't deserve it who did
[2:18:35] nothing to earn it but they are still my
[2:18:38] people what have you done to earn this
[2:18:40] this morning what have you done to ever
[2:18:42] deserve this just spawn it there's
[2:18:44] nothing we could do to deserve it and
[2:18:46] man we can just all sing the same song
[2:18:48] nothing but the blood of Jesus because
[2:18:51] if it wasn't for the blood we wouldn't
[2:18:53] stand a chance so why could I hold a
[2:18:59] horse or a grudge or hold your past
[2:19:02] against you because he's done holding my
[2:19:04] past against me
[2:19:05] he's not holding your past against you
[2:19:07] how could you hold your past somebody
[2:19:09] pass against them when he has already
[2:19:11] released them and Jesus said if you
[2:19:15] don't forgive I can't let you go he said
[2:19:18] your forgiveness it's depending on how
[2:19:21] you forgive others you hear that I'll
[2:19:26] see it one more time
[2:19:27] he said hope
[2:19:31] he said if you don't forgive how could
[2:19:33] your father never forgive you so you
[2:19:38] wanna feel release release others and
[2:19:40] feel the release release feel the relief
[2:19:44] as you release your wife release your
[2:19:46] children release your boss

[2:20:08] release your daughter this morning
[2:20:09] release your son this morning release
[2:20:12] your past this morning
[2:20:14] release it and feel the release of God
[2:20:16] upon your life hope this helps somebody
[2:20:31] this morning the Prophet goes to eat one
[2:20:34] day and he sees a woman - autumn makeup
[2:20:37] on and everything he gets almost half
[2:20:42] righteous he said Lord is this the world
[2:20:44] that my children have to drop it he was
[2:20:47] looking at this woman and he saw
[2:20:49] condemnation he saw it and then God
[2:20:51] lifted his eyes and showed him what he
[2:20:54] couldn't see showed him his own sins
[2:21:00] dear was the Prophet condemning this
[2:21:02] woman and God showed him his own sins
[2:21:04] and show him the blood pumper now
[2:21:07] whenever sin came up it was being
[2:21:08] blocked by the blood pump up and that
[2:21:11] blood pumper God put D etre blind his
[2:21:14] own eyes that he doesn't see us and he
[2:21:17] said I don't even condemn you how you
[2:21:19] could condemn and his whole perspective
[2:21:21] change because he started and see what
[2:21:23] God was seeing and when he went you
[2:21:25] walked up to that woman he began a talk
[2:21:26] talk she said I was a Christian one time
[2:21:28] I gave my life to God one time but I
[2:21:31] fell off I Blaxland
[2:21:33] at 10-under like was it
[2:21:36] when you look this morning what do you
[2:21:40] see maybe you have had a hard time a
[2:21:43] rough time maybe you've suffered a lot
[2:21:45] of losses family this that the other and
[2:21:48] you only see the negative I want you to
[2:21:50] assess and look for the positive this
[2:21:52] morning but the Branham goes on they did
[2:21:57] not believe that was the Messiah talk
[2:21:59] about the Jews they could not see him to
[2:22:02] be Messiah yet he done every sign the
[2:22:05] Messiah was supposed to do there was not
[2:22:07] one sign that Jesus did not do and he
[2:22:09] was supposed to do he did every one of
[2:22:11] them but they could not see it they were
[2:22:13] blind so when you see people say I don't
[2:22:17] believe in divine healing I can't see it
[2:22:19] I can't see this baptism of the Holy
[2:22:22] Ghost don't be angry with them he said
[2:22:27] they are blind they say I can't see this
[2:22:31] message of him coming I can't see this
[2:22:34] baptism of the Holy Spirit I can see the
[2:22:37] Serpent's see I can see this stuff they
[2:22:39] are blind and they don't even know it
[2:22:41] I'm Betty Brown said that's a sign of
[2:22:43] this age I've spoken in the book of
[2:22:45] Revelation they lay off the leaders in
[2:22:47] line wretched miserable and don't even
[2:22:50] know it blind and don't even know it but
[2:22:58] listen to the prophet in their unbelief
[2:23:01] when they see him when he comes again it
[2:23:07] will make an end of the unbelief
[2:23:13] hallelujah brother BAM say I love this
[2:23:15] good old gospel and that's why I read
[2:23:18] the scripture all eyes will see him
[2:23:22] that's why everything you will bow every
[2:23:25] tongue confess because what they have
[2:23:27] not seen either through God blinding
[2:23:30] them or through their predestination to
[2:23:32] not ever see it they will end up seeing
[2:23:35] it because everything will be revealed
[2:23:43] Branson now we know whoever yet we see
[2:23:48] things happening I'm not going to longer
[2:23:50] in a message look could he take some
[2:23:53] more we see things happening that to the
[2:23:59] world is just blind to them as it was in
[2:24:01] the days of Noah this is the prophet the
[2:24:03] message look but to we who look for
[2:24:08] Christ the second time it's an ensign
[2:24:10] that he is soon coming we see something
[2:24:12] fixing to happen and it depends on what
[2:24:14] you're looking at now Noah knew by the
[2:24:17] Word of God that there was coming a
[2:24:19] flood by faith he saw it because he had
[2:24:23] no evidence there was no newspaper
[2:24:25] article that went on about a flood
[2:24:26] somewhere else
[2:24:27] so he had to see it by eyes of it with
[2:24:29] his entrusting God's would write he knew
[2:24:32] that was going to be because God's would
[2:24:34] promised it
[2:24:35] now Noah himself by faith saw what God's
[2:24:38] Word said but the world could not see it
[2:24:41] because it could not be scientifically
[2:24:44] proven that there was water up in the
[2:24:46] sky but no one knew it was there because
[2:24:48] God said so and that's a church the
[2:24:54] Bride a call out to thee knows that the
[2:24:57] coming of the Lord is at hand regardless
[2:24:59] of how much we've been able to go in
[2:25:02] progress and so forth and succeed in
[2:25:04] splitting an atom and sending a ray the
[2:25:06] message of the Moon that means nothing
[2:25:08] to the believer only a sign that the
[2:25:10] coming of the Lord is at hand we see
[2:25:13] nations breaking and nations coming
[2:25:16] falling apart and the world coming apart
[2:25:18] and the church move coming up
[2:25:20] then we are told we receive a kingdom
[2:25:23] which cannot be moved but as these
[2:25:25] things begin to happen the church binds
[2:25:28] itself together tighter and tighter by
[2:25:31] the Word of God it's a great data we are
[2:25:34] living in everybody's looking for
[2:25:37] something everybody's looking for
[2:25:41] something you might be looking the deer
[2:25:44] - a time to get home to eat denies
[2:25:47] anybody within trying to get home to eat
[2:25:49] lunch nobody nobody there might be a
[2:25:57] picnic this afternoon the property
[2:25:59] speaking that you're taking your family
[2:26:00] to maybe it's something another next
[2:26:03] week I'll be looking for a neighbor to
[2:26:05] come or some friend but everybody's
[2:26:07] looking for something what are you
[2:26:09] looking for and when you look good what
[2:26:11] do you see and as a group of believers
[2:26:14] today assemble together the Prophet said
[2:26:17] we want to fix our thoughts our
[2:26:19] principles and things upon the coming of
[2:26:22] the Lord
[2:26:23] looking for Christ who shall appear the
[2:26:25] second time without sin unto salvation
[2:26:27] to those that believe and are looking
[2:26:29] for him to come so he will only come to
[2:26:32] those who are looking for him because
[2:26:37] the word has already come to us to know
[2:26:39] and to point us to the fact that he's
[2:26:40] coming so it's now our responsibility to
[2:26:43] be looking for him are you looking for
[2:26:46] him do you look for him when you're on
[2:26:48] your job do you look for him when you're
[2:26:50] on your school when you when you're
[2:26:52] driving home or what are you looking for
[2:26:54] what are you looking for what are you
[2:26:58] looking for when you're going down on
[2:26:59] your knees to pray what are you
[2:27:00] expecting what are you doing about an
[2:27:02] expectation you just want to be in the
[2:27:05] world or do you want something more you
[2:27:06] just want to be in church but you want
[2:27:07] something more you want to be in a
[2:27:08] message or you want something more what
[2:27:10] are you crying out for when you look at
[2:27:12] all of these things do you see that
[2:27:14] judgment is hanging over do you see the
[2:27:16] raft is close at hand in the days of
[2:27:22] Noah and so Noah building the boat and
[2:27:24] they looked and they saw that's enough
[2:27:26] but it didn't see the judgment didn't
[2:27:29] see the rain and then courts shut the
[2:27:31] door so that the awkward
[2:27:34] I am four days in breach and the people
[2:27:38] still DCC look easy Italian no I just
[2:27:40] went crazy
[2:27:42] but when the first drop of rain fell
[2:27:45] this saw they saw what more was speaking
[2:27:50] about and when they saw I can imagine
[2:27:52] they say no I know I let us in can we
[2:27:55] come in Noah but I know you know you're
[2:27:58] my neighbor no you know we went to
[2:27:59] school together
[2:28:00] no I came to the services no I heard you
[2:28:02] preach but it's too late
[2:28:06] friends don't see this thing to leat see
[2:28:09] it today if you don't have the Holy
[2:28:12] Ghost see it today if you have not been
[2:28:14] born again see it today
[2:28:16] if you have not forgiven someone see it
[2:28:18] today if you have someone to make right
[2:28:20] see it today cuz I'm that same the Jews
[2:28:31] could not see that be in their Messiah
[2:28:34] and yet they were scholars and
[2:28:36] theologians men of great renown
[2:28:38] scholarship they read the same Bible at
[2:28:41] you read now after it's been me known to
[2:28:43] us we see it plain that that was the
[2:28:46] Messiah so with our natural ability we
[2:28:49] would not even know it's a messiah for
[2:28:50] you to know that Christ Jesus was the
[2:28:52] Messiah your eyes had to be open your
[2:28:55] spiritual eyes because outsider is just
[2:28:58] intellectual honor and even the Prophet
[2:29:01] intellectually people here in the
[2:29:03] message didn't know it intellectually
[2:29:05] but it hasn't dropped down to a
[2:29:06] revelation of he came for me he came to
[2:29:10] he came to deliver me he came to perfect
[2:29:14] me he came to adopt me he came for the
[2:29:17] virtue to live in me me individual the
[2:29:25] church this day is prophesied to be
[2:29:27] blinded to reject the even time message
[2:29:30] revelation she said to Noah wretched
[2:29:33] miserable notice the bride the
[2:29:34] Commission the other night or the church
[2:29:36] naked plan and didn't know it Lord Jesus
[2:29:38] but Abraham's true that be merciful to
[2:29:40] us with the Balan but but the Bible said
[2:29:43] they was naked I never saw it till now
[2:29:45] he was naked
[2:29:47] can the church say I'm getting ready to
[2:29:51] wind up when Jesus came John the Baptist
[2:29:54] preaching say there's one standing among
[2:29:57] you whose shoes I'm not even worthy
[2:30:02] Jesus whether they had nobody kids even
[2:30:04] see him maybe you look what do you see
[2:30:10] Jesus comes out of being tempted and
[2:30:13] tried and walks into the temple they
[2:30:17] looked at him I could imagine they
[2:30:19] ushered him into his seat he looked the
[2:30:22] same way he did two weeks before could
[2:30:25] have ever said he was in a temple as was
[2:30:27] his custom it was his custom to be in
[2:30:28] the temple he found a script a waiter's
[2:30:32] written many had read the same theater
[2:30:35] before me he had looked at this but when
[2:30:37] Jesus began to read he was seeing
[2:30:39] something different it was not personal
[2:30:41] to him by revelation by experience and
[2:30:43] by Commission and authority that he
[2:30:45] could say the Spirit of the Lord upon me
[2:30:47] for he has anointed me and when he said
[2:30:48] this day the scripture is fulfilled he
[2:30:51] was seeing what nobody else had seen and
[2:30:54] then the people said what is this what
[2:30:56] is what is going on he was a fulfillment
[2:30:58] of Scripture now the man said no in the
[2:31:02] words see doesn't mean to look at the
[2:31:04] words see means to understand that's
[2:31:05] right like Jesus said to Nicodemus
[2:31:07] except a man be born again he cannot see
[2:31:10] the kingdom of heaven he said you have
[2:31:15] looked at a lot of things I just don't
[2:31:16] see it that means understand it you
[2:31:19] can't understand it until you are born
[2:31:22] again when you are born again you
[2:31:25] realize what makes these people act like
[2:31:28] this you have to accept it yourself and
[2:31:32] have a personal experience is anybody
[2:31:38] looking for Pulis on experience this
[2:31:39] morning
[2:31:40] a personal experience so you could see
[2:31:43] the word plainly friends for you to put
[2:31:50] your place to put your foot on every
[2:31:54] spot I've grown you have to see the
[2:31:55] ground for this before he could put your
[2:31:56] foot on it listen to what God told
[2:32:00] Abraham in Genesis 13 after lot had left
[2:32:02] and the laws in AD Abram after that lot
[2:32:05] was separated from him lift up now thine
[2:32:07] eyes and look from the place where thou
[2:32:09] art northward and southward and eastward
[2:32:11] and westward for all the land which thou
[2:32:14] seest that you see all that you see is
[2:32:19] that he will I give it and to thy seed
[2:32:22] forever now Aaron can I say well I just
[2:32:25] seen here no that is it that good so
[2:32:27] Abraham was challenged by the currents
[2:32:29] to see further because by seein he was
[2:32:33] actually beginning to claim he was
[2:32:36] defining the borders of his territory by
[2:32:39] what he was able to see so I want to
[2:32:42] challenge you this morning just like
[2:32:44] Samson
[2:32:47] when Samson was led to the pillars the
[2:32:50] musicians didn't get ready to come when
[2:32:53] they looked at Samson they saw finally
[2:32:57] they had defeated an enemy that had kept
[2:33:00] them under pressure for a long time when
[2:33:04] they looked at the pillars that Samson
[2:33:05] was being led to this other pillars as a
[2:33:08] place to just contain this entertainment
[2:33:11] and as Samson was being led to the
[2:33:15] pillars where the Branum said Samson
[2:33:17] began to see not with sight but he began
[2:33:22] to see a possibility
[2:33:25] he began to see a possibility but a
[2:33:27] random said that one small God could do
[2:33:30] something for him he had lost everything
[2:33:34] he had lost his natural eyesight but he
[2:33:37] didn't lost the vision to see the
[2:33:39] possibility that court could restore
[2:33:41] that God to deliver he saw the
[2:33:45] possibility that his mission could still
[2:33:47] be accomplished to destroy the
[2:33:49] Philistines
[2:33:50] so as whatever him said he study and
[2:33:53] tears may have began a stream to a
[2:33:55] socket less eyes he couldn't see anybody
[2:33:59] and he wasn't looking for them he was
[2:34:02] just looking at the possibility that
[2:34:03] once more
[2:34:05] God could work for him I don't know your
[2:34:08] situation this morning but I want to
[2:34:09] challenge you to see the possibility
[2:34:12] that once more court could do something
[2:34:15] for you then once more he could do
[2:34:17] something for your family that once more
[2:34:19] he could do something for your children
[2:34:21] that once more he can do something in
[2:34:23] your heart let's all stand to our feet
[2:34:26] we gonna play something listen to the
[2:34:31] prophet and a message once more with a
[2:34:34] brand said little close now at this
[2:34:36] remark he knew that his present Thomas
[2:34:38] Sampson Beck's ill-conditioned could
[2:34:41] never be the challenge of the hour yet
[2:34:44] he was just as much man as he ever was
[2:34:46] in his muscles his frame was as big as
[2:34:49] it ever was he was just as big a muscle
[2:34:52] that ever could raise up on his arm at
[2:34:54] any time it was probably lodged because
[2:34:56] he had been grinding doing heavier work
[2:34:58] but Branson we got better churches
[2:35:00] better building and everything but
[2:35:01] where's our strength spiritually
[2:35:03] speaking we can take a vote in the
[2:35:06] nation sure we can do these things but
[2:35:08] that ain't what I'm talking about I'm
[2:35:10] talking about the presence of God being
[2:35:12] recognized among us that's what we ought
[2:35:16] to live for he knew that his backslidden
[2:35:18] condition could not be the challenge of
[2:35:20] that hour he had lost his focus
[2:35:23] he had lost what he was supposed to be
[2:35:25] looking for looking too caught up in the
[2:35:29] cares of life but about him said so does
[2:35:33] the church know it now we can't do it
[2:35:34] under this condition
[2:35:36] you can do it
[2:35:38] [Music]
[2:35:44] but the band said I've just got a little
[2:35:46] minute or two longer but notice as I
[2:35:48] hurry now and keep my word all the time
[2:35:50] where they were all standing there and
[2:35:53] these totes were going through their
[2:35:55] mind I hope it sends some through yours
[2:35:57] they never noticed well Samson his torch
[2:36:00] went through his mind maybe they passed
[2:36:02] the bottle took a drink again they fine
[2:36:05] Hollywood woman's today with a cigarette
[2:36:07] in their mouth as it was such a thing
[2:36:10] like they I don't think they cut quite
[2:36:11] that low in a day but pushed up their
[2:36:13] hand took another drink and whoring
[2:36:15] hello chosen by John you up there we
[2:36:17] played cards together why are they doing
[2:36:20] this but around say there's a
[2:36:21] possibility this is what Samson went
[2:36:24] through that God will hear me there's a
[2:36:27] possibility that while he taught the
[2:36:29] fella times have not noticed him this
[2:36:31] little boy had untied his hands
[2:36:33] war bison lay my hands upon the booze
[2:36:36] there's a possibility oh my I wish the
[2:36:40] church could see that there is a
[2:36:41] possibility of a real revival what did
[2:36:45] he do he raised up his sockets he had no
[2:36:47] eyes but he raised up his socket towards
[2:36:50] God
[2:36:50] he said they never noticed the moving of
[2:36:53] his lips as he was sincerely confession
[2:36:58] they never notice that he was talking to
[2:37:01] God I don't know where last time so that
[2:37:03] prayed or cried or talked but didn't
[2:37:06] even realize that he had begun to talk
[2:37:08] to God whatever Adam said we don't need
[2:37:12] just a little Lord forgive me and Jim
[2:37:14] and Joe and all of us he said we need a
[2:37:16] sincere cleaning up from the pulpit to
[2:37:18] the janitor he said I never noticed the
[2:37:21] tears running down from them sockets
[2:37:23] where he once had eyes you never noticed
[2:37:26] the moving of his lips his eyes brightly
[2:37:29] tears streaming down the sockets he
[2:37:32] wanted God to make his would once more
[2:37:34] vindicated to prove as I say this
[2:37:37] Delilah to the other side of Jesus
[2:37:40] Christ the same yesterday today and
[2:37:42] forever once more he thought it would
[2:37:47] happen not a new denomination not a new
[2:37:50] sectarian but a vindicated world from
[2:37:53] you God I know you are still good I'm
[2:37:55] blind I've got all
[2:37:56] tract I'm not willing to live let me die
[2:37:58] with this enemy you raise me up to
[2:38:00] destroy that I've failed your Lord but
[2:38:03] there's a possibility you'd hear me once
[2:38:05] more Lord once more Lord in dead earnest
[2:38:08] in dead earnest
[2:38:10] it means deep sincerity it means
[2:38:12] forgetting who's next to you it means
[2:38:14] forgetting who else was here
[2:38:15] in tenderness he prayed he knew what was
[2:38:19] coming Lord Justice once more once more
[2:38:21] let me see Jesus Christ as he was
[2:38:24] yesterday when he breathed that brand
[2:38:27] the tears rolling from his cheeks with
[2:38:29] deep sincerity of confession but a pen
[2:38:33] said that's what the church needs
[2:38:34] confess you're wrong don't care what dr.
[2:38:36] Jones hands or what anybody else else if
[2:38:39] you're out of the word of God confess it
[2:38:41] that your own cry or once more Lord once
[2:38:45] more Lord Lord once more avenge my
[2:38:48] blindness upon these denominations and
[2:38:51] give me strength Lord the shake this
[2:38:53] denominational world with your
[2:38:55] vindication give me strength Lord once
[2:38:58] more prove it but a parent said he knew
[2:39:02] what was gonna happen if his prayer was
[2:39:04] answered do you know what's gonna happen
[2:39:06] if your prey gets answer this morning do
[2:39:08] you know what will happen if caught
[2:39:10] answers your prayer if could with the
[2:39:12] grandeur in size of your heart do you
[2:39:14] know shackles would break off of your
[2:39:16] house off of your children off of your
[2:39:18] family do you know of the Holy Ghost
[2:39:24] today given you what is gonna happen if
[2:39:29] his prayer was answered
[2:39:30] he knew Ted earnest crying once more
[2:39:33] Lord and while he was praying and making
[2:39:36] it on his confession every fiber in his
[2:39:39] body begin to vibrate while he was
[2:39:41] praying I'm making his confession the
[2:39:44] Prophet said every fiber in his body
[2:39:47] began to vibrate the frequency began to
[2:39:50] change the atmosphere began to change
[2:39:52] something began to happen in the realm
[2:39:55] that cannot be seen with naked eyes
[2:39:57] something began to happen but
[2:40:00] Philistines could not see something
[2:40:01] begin to happen that the devil could not
[2:40:04] see something begin to happen that the
[2:40:06] world could not see number the Brennan
[2:40:12] goes on oh god oh god if the body of
[2:40:16] Jesus Christ could stand as one and this
[2:40:19] is my bread is morning or go order if
[2:40:21] the body of Jesus Christ could stand as
[2:40:24] one and every fiber and every member
[2:40:27] begin to vibrate with the literal
[2:40:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost again not with
[2:40:33] new members and shaking hands and some
[2:40:36] Creed and as a strength begin to move
[2:40:39] into those muscles every fiber began to
[2:40:42] twist he began to feel himself Agana and
[2:40:45] he twisted out and when he did the big
[2:40:47] walls hell all we need to do today is to
[2:40:51] see these denominational walls for is to
[2:40:55] get deeply sincere before God to heal
[2:40:58] these blinded eyes that's been blinded
[2:41:01] from the Word of God that was Samson's
[2:41:04] greatest victory the Prophet said he
[2:41:06] ever had because he was willing to
[2:41:08] confess over every enemy first that he
[2:41:12] was brought up to destroy Oh hallelujah
