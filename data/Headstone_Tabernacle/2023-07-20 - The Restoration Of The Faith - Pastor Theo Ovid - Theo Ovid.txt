over your cup gonna run over you're gonna have joy you're gonna have peace you're gonna have a fiery Revival in your soul do you believe that tonight oh Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord I'm building tonight let me see I'm burning Hallelujah I'm burning tonight my soul is on fire my hands is on fire my feet is on fire there's fire in God advocated drink last night fire fire could burn the drinking desire out of you tonight I look if we do drugs yesterday fire fire cleansing fire Holy Fire terrifying fire about God is a consuming fire oh he transformed he changes oh Hallelujah Oh Glory to God o glory to God hallelujah I don't believe in fixing anyone in concrete I don't believe in that sense of permanence that people have to stay as they are I always believe once there is hope once there is possibility and I'll tell you why there was a man in Abraham you maybe she was an old man he couldn't have any children his wife was Barren and the Bible said against hope he believed in hope when there was no hope when the doctor would have turned his back on that man the Bible said he believed God that's the difference when you come to the spot when everything seems to be sailing along you and you choose to believe God for your deliverance to believe God for your healing to believe God for your breakthrough to believe God for your Revival Michael I see all people but that revised I see all Eagles come back young again I never gave your up I'd be careful in a wheelchair tonight God is able to raise you up I'm here to declare tonight that he's the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] you may be seated what you what you're seeing is the effect of inspiration rain you hear what I said without teaching him I don't have inspiration reign inspiration win is when the unction come to give the man of God the words to speak to the people of God you know who you are you are God's people after your words I'm him tonight didn't come to hear from man you come to see a dead man you come to see a man get out of the way and to see the Holy Ghost pick a hall of a man make him walk now he didn't think he was going to walk make him say what he didn't think he will say that's when you could see God speaking to your life [Applause] what you're about to witness the message will have not seen Hallelujah I want to say it again what you about the witness the message world has not seen we are now about to break into our season now listen carefully you will be seated before we before we read a scripture Jesus from age 12 to 30 on the silence under the teaching of the word no manifestation under the ministry of the word learning the scriptures he came to the spot where he was led by the spirit into the temple that day and Jesus said season change because the spirit is now upon me and when the spirit comes upon you that is to fulfill your scripture I'm not hearing you I'm not telling you I'm not hearing you after 40 plus years of the ministry of the word of all the teachings of all the scripture I am prophesy I am the spirit has to come upon you than that do you believe that tonight don't even say you're not worthy okay you guess that I am not talking about what you have done I am talking about what the spirit is about to do and the spirit is about to come whoa upon you all right [Applause] [Applause] that some of you made me not getting it but the spirit Came Upon Samson he took a little drop on and beat down a thousand men with helmet when the spirit come you ever hear when the spirit of the Lord come upon my heart I will dance like David dance you understand when the spirit comes what the spirit does the spirit doesn't come to try to explain this explain that when the season has come it's time for manifestation it's time for syndication time for confirmation time for your prayer to be answered foreign [Applause] present tense to do what is promised to do what he said Oh Glory of God you know what God said to you this should be the most exciting time of your life if that devil tell you A big boo before you came inside of here you're gonna leave me and tell him a peekaboo when you get out of here because God is about to confirm the world in your life let's all stand [Applause] you want to turn to Malachi chapter 4. and joy chapter 2. Malachi 4 was five and six says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadfully of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to the fathers this I come and smite the Earth with a curse and from Joel chapter 2 we want to read Glory cool beautiful verse 21. fear not to land be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do greetings you're not afraid it beast of the feel for the pastor of the Wilderness to spring for the tree buried of fruit the Fig Tree and the vine to yield their strength be glad then Eternal of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for yet given to you the foreign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the flow shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I'll always talk to you the years the Lucas had eaten the conquer worm the caterpillar the Palmer World migrate Army which I sent among you and he shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that are dead wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and he shall know that I am in the midst of Israel that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterwards that I will poured my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your woman shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon my handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens and hear blood and fire pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness the moon into blood before the great interprety of the Lord let us pray father we thank you that you have promises for the bride elect before the great and terribility of the Lord father may you come down tonight and begin to manifest your promises pour out your spirit upon your people we are needy and we await upon you in Jesus and we ask it amen you may be seated thank you priests God will have a title the restoration of defeat and our inspiration the promise Holy Ghost baptism to the bride oh blessed be the name of the Lord the promised Holy Ghost baptism to the bride nobody Branham brought one message one inspiration and we are all in it it is an inspiration of Seven Seasons seven Thunders to prepare the people to leave this earth to prepare people to get the extra oil to get ready to be as the wise virgins do you believe that no there can be no real faith without manifestation because works is Faith Express so when we speak about restoration of the faith it cannot be without manifestation because works is evidence of faith if you have faith you will have a manifestation to express the fear it that you see that you have isn't that right and the prophet said there have been no manifestation of God touched to the bride so what he is saying is that fate have to come forward to produce a manifestation of God and that manifestation is what will awake still excite Insight the bride in other words it can't be Revelation only and demonstration of the spirit so when we talk about the restoration of the faith we are speaking about the restoration of power but signs wonders and miracles that is what we are talking about could we give the Lord a shout to praise and there have been an absence in this message of that power but Joel said I am gonna restore and my people shall be satisfied my people they're going to praise me my people shall not be ashamed oh Hallelujah are you with me tonight what is he saying you're redeemed from your sin from your past from your failures from your mistakes you'll be justified all condemned God promised to apply blood upon your life God promise to look at you as if you never did it never did it God promised to justify you not just forgive you come on help me somebody help me somebody I'm getting excited now I'm not talking about forgiveness I am talking about justification as if you never get it you can't sit there and believe that you gotta shout you got a rejoice that is [Applause] my people my people be separated from other people he said my people my very own people called by my name my people this is Jesus come on Oh Glory we give the Lord a shout my people do know who you are when you are my people you better say Amen you better shout like how John Shout [Applause] I call you by name before your mother conceive you before your mother had you I ordain you to be a prophet into the nation I thought in the seed to comfort nothing will stop the mystery of who you are from unfold in thank you so therefore what about him said there have been no manifestation of God to steal the bride it will take those seven Thunders to produce it to produce what to produce a manifestation not Revelation only but a manifestation of God to stay the bride because you are not really bright yet until you come into an experience with your mate your husband but charity with the Holy Ghost is only then you get connected with your husband his wife had made herself ready so God wants to contact you God wants to touch you [Applause] so you must have an experience with the person of the Holy Ghost isn't that right the person of Christ so they're calling out time which we have had for 50 plus years of teaching and Revelation is about to change the season is going to change right before your eyes at the time of the ministry of the spirit the Supernatural and omnipotent speaking even sin being called out it will be changed right in front of your eye Power is coming the black out the spirit of man you see when Peter James and John saw Jesus with that Glory around him they said let us make three Tabernacles and the power shut them up the power said shut up him don't come with the humanists at taught don't try to build no Tabernacle to make no man no glory at the end of it Christ only Christ only Jesus only not even fivefold not past time evangelism Jesus only when they look there was only Jesus No Moses no Elijah no Jesus only have to come after Jesus I only got to come back to Jesus only Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever the power I believe that the time has come for the power of God to follow the word the power is going to change you there's got to come a resurrection power among the bride isn't that right and the first thing that Paul will lead to is to the cross where you are crucified with Christ who give the Lord some Praises oh hallelujah hallelujah not not power to show off not power to say I am right you're wrong no power to die Oh Glory to God because that is where Jesus conquered Jesus he didn't conquer resilience Healing The Sick that was the easy part the path that he conquered is when it looked like nothing happened when he on the cross when he says finish oh Hallelujah it doesn't look Auto dramatic it was painful but it was there he conquered in suffering and crucifixion in Christ being paid friends this gospel has to become real if Christ suffered so must we if he went through we got to go through also no you just have to bless God to escape the terrible day of the Lord but before that terrible they come and they have Darkness grieving us and they have Blackness a day that you wouldn't even want to think about before that they come he promised to send Elijah prophet and he had a job to do he is going to turn not the head of the people back to the theater dividers no not not the head he gonna turn the heart somebody say heart yes I want her God want hot in your heart that's the real you your heart somebody abundance of the heart the mouth will speak when you happen back you can only speak where your heart is at oh you have some powerful things to say tonight and I said I sell him to you the Holy Ghost cannot behave in one man and misbehave in another because God behavior is his person so when God said you turn your heart back to the faith that's just what he means your heart not not yet to go to some church your heart you see the devil is fighting watch the rock of Revelation to the individual so what the devil introduced the people to to church and group so the people end up at group think but once you catch that the Father in heaven he alone is to be healer then that frees you from group church group think group Revelation group interpretation men's ideas [Applause] then you would realize God will have young Sons older Sons and different kind of sons no it's his sons there's you see him as a son just came in five minutes ago as somebody 40 years coming to church [Applause] you see the problem is your humanistic realm where you see in whom spiritual whom are holy whom are righteous but when God brings binoculars he said all have sinned and if you are sin you're born in it [Applause] in other words you're born in it you do it so stop playing righteous we will expose you tonight because there is none righteous no not one check somebody out and tell them there is unrighteous [Applause] oh you could give the Lord a shout [Applause] don't watch the Catholic but my name was in the book I wasn't even my acolyte there's a servant Catholic yeah but God called me the whole family stayed but God called me and I made a choice to give up my sins and repent and get baptized in Jesus name next there could be 40 years since I made that choice a Feeling I'm feeling just as strong that's when I first started out don't let the gray hair bother you because they've got bothering me I just are strong my soul on fire I'm on the expectation I am looking to die no I'm looking to start to live because Jesus said I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly I want the Abundant Life I want God's joy I'm not trying circumstances all right so all of you who want to express your dose of tiredness because you're waiting long cut it out because he come down according to first Thessalonians 4. the Lord himself already come down I have news for you news oh shocking news yes you see but the manam says the seven angels come from eternity to gather up the scattered world to tie it back into the word to bring down the Holy Ghost so they brought down the Holy Ghost but we wasn't ready yet for the Holy Ghost in that measure so the Holy Ghost came down as the word because Jesus said the words that I speak they are spirit and their lives so God take his spirit and hide it as the word which is the revelation of the son of man [Applause] live under the anointing of the ministry of the word to be seated on because the Holy Ghost have to fall in such a way upon planted bread that it will restore God will be the restoration of the pain thank you [Applause] watch this how could the FED be restored and we can't do what Peter did [Music] Peter didn't have Seven Seals seven Church ages all the Mysteries but he had the feet you see the faith is Christ the Holy Ghost in you the person [Applause] not just the baptism but the added life so that is I have something and I could release it I have it I could give it he actually had the dream of God resident and because the gym was in him he could speak for other Sons [Applause] Adam was supposed to do foreign [Applause] wants to bring Representatives like him but when man said it went into the sex way instead of spoken word which was word and spirit so when Jesus came his first message was you must be born again of word and spirit so it had to bring back word in order for you to get back to Spirit but the word was lost so of course in a prophet to restore the word that was lost so we could come back to word and spirit [Applause] so before the appointed time comes he had was to have to call in all time which you're in right now so even though people want to cut people off and top people off God's still calling whosoever will come come quickly spiritually by sit come come come take the word come hold the ticket come ticket is the token the ticket is the word when you buy a bus ticket the doctor the conductor don't want to see your money he want to see the ticket if you don't have a ticket he said go and buy [Applause] go and get some oil and then come back the bus is ready to go everybody's in line have a ticket you have your money you got a million dollars he is authorized only to take the ticket you said conductor hold a hundred dollar bill he said no ticket where do you get it you have to go to the company and buy it and while he went to buy the bus takeoff don't be caught like that you want your ticket your ticket is evidence you pay a price I'm not hearing you I'm not hearing you so when you see a man with the power of God you know that man paid a price [Applause] are you with me amen remember Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts The Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it that's prophecy what preacher you're going to be giving me the church yes that is by Satan visiting even visiting the panyard and the Calypso Pence know he feels in the church to defile it why because he understands that if we get things in order the power of God going to be here to destroy his works his imps and his demons so he want to affect and inflict and mess up the church to affect the power from flowing freely in other words nobody is supposed to walk in here sick and stay sick I want to declare that tonight I want to say it a certain way tonight nobody should walk in this building sit and walk back out sick [Applause] the night be rejecting that we are saying these signs shall follow them that believe it you really expecting Miracles tonight yes in the Supernatural tonight yes You're Expecting The Holy Ghost [Applause] why why because Joel said it shall come to pass afterwards that I without asking the picture permission I without consulting The Minister's Association I will pour out my spirit come on now come on now come on come on now [Applause] let me challenge your face a little bit when Saul was messing up Soul was King so start off nice he's anointed he's inspired he prophesying he's speaking as king and sowing started to screw up and mess up we're also had enough of that go and anoint one of Jesse's songs king of Israel that son called David he didn't ask for anointing he wasn't playing Lord anoint me King Lord I feel in kingish Lord could you make me a king David was only seen about sheep when God said anoint him that's God's business that's God's choice Diamond if James was smoking Tempe that I'm Gonna Do With It do you understand what we're talking about God said anoint that man king it is the desire of God so when God is about to release your family you didn't hear me tonight when God is about to release you from the bondage of your sickness that is not your desire that God's desire rejoice Rejoice because God's desire is supposed to be revealed [Applause] look let me see this Baron Hannah Baron woman mocking her making mockery of her because she can't produce a child and she's in a temper grumbling rolling travailing she had a choice to be hateful she had a choice to be angry she had a choice to give them back good and make a good argument but she choose to bring a problem to God she chose to weep before God and God saw the groaning God saw the traveling and God said bless you I'm gonna bless you with a prophet I'm gonna bless you with a man of God [Applause] I've heard the groanings under Christ of my people you see God have to move upon your heart to break you out this you want to stick around the devil makes sure everybody have a toy I believe it Hallelujah a dolly a car something to fly Games sports he know that man have defined desires so he make sure you have options Galore to make sure you could pick and choose and imagine you could look around and say none of the above choose God Moses Moses look away from all the glory of Egypt he had opportunity to be Pharaoh yeah opportunity to relieve them by his might of position but God will get a glory for that Pharaoh say you know Moses could come and say you know you know who will release you I see unto you grew and I will have to go west but God will get no glory and God love and he deserves the glory that is why a sinner doesn't impress God and the self-righteous he has embarrassed them and you believe them at one time Jesus stand up there and watching people acting and behaving and so on and man come up and say Lord you know and the students and let's do that and do the other God I know you may service I don't miss church and Jesus is showing disciples a sample of what is going in the human heart our next money come close he said Lord almost upon me a sinner just a human righteous who you think got more impressed with the man who said I'm a sinner God love honesty God life a heart that can say Lord that's why God asked Jacob was your name he said I am Jacob I am a trickster I'm a big skullduggery I'm a smart man because I like you no you tell somebody you are a smart man I don't want to do with you right you you you won't do anything to get what is right and and that's the kind of man that I like a man that have passion you see a cool man you know he's like you need to hear no dear oh you're going with poco poke uh you know neither you're not there that can't work a man building a house and one nail today tomorrow what what are you ready building yeah so forget them for him you want somebody with with seal but with passion with with fire that's the only way we could get things done You See Fire have a certain point where it has break out it has something called combustion to start the fire and I learned that if I have an ignition point a point is running on the breakout so when you're seeing smoke if that's higher yet it's only smoke you could smoke all the time you're smoking you're smoking we don't want Smoky we need a wind to bring a breeze to blow to get you on fire we need you to be in oil one part in oil and the other part on fire get get people out your business Hallelujah Ukraine one two one two one two and somebody going one two one two one two it can't be like that Harley got one man on fire that's why you can't handle lukewarm is that a hot or you're cold why God say that because if you're tall you're dead it's a look it's on fire you're on fire but lukewarm is in the cold not dead that's a kind of sickening thing making someone upset look who I'm Gonna Wanna look who I'm praise is that they don't praise God at all then we know you're dead then we can pray to raise the dead becoming the dead rays of the Dead ghosts here dead the dead have to move it that they have to move that they have to move you you can't be dead if you're not moving we know you're dead that's fine it have reason of the dead too when the Death Race they can't just stay like that no that reason of the Dead get off your grave clothes you're gonna be tied up at grave clothes get off your grave clothes all the old ways of the past [Applause] Free to Be Inspired close down [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah you see the thing about it is this as humans we feel sorry assuming we want to extend ourselves and Care in a certain way but God doesn't operate as a human does his eyes see a different and we have to go with the eyes of God that's why Jesus always looking for the seeds looking for the Sun look at the sons of Zebedee with a fish and neck and a business and he watch him all follow me how you will interpret that business knows how to Boom you need your boys and this man with beard come and say follow me and the Bible said they dropped their Nets to follow on nomad a man who had no place no Hotel no business no salary check the right dot for them he said follow me and I will make you he says of men that's what the gospel is about fishing for men to understand that they are going to be Sons ignorant man fisherman can't write his name can't read call by God to follow Jesus Jesus the only man carried car right but Jesus dropping promises upon him same works I do shall we do also he shall say to this monkey you could have what you say Jesus dropping Promises by Spoken Word [Applause] to their Spirits into their soul and one time he released anointed upon them he said behold I give you power and my God is at the castle Devils they come back rejoice and say Lord developer Rejoice subjected ourselves to us he said don't Rejoice for that Rejoice because your names is written because he knew they don't have character yet he knew it's a taste of power to show them what is possible [Applause] I wanted to say beginning on that because many preachers have a taste of power that God only show what is possible but he must have character and character is not a gift character is a victory you have to go through stuff you have to go through something so stop looking down her now because you fail and you fall and whatever forget that it's a good thing you fall you know how you fall and you don't have to fall again because God could Empower you tonight power of His word and upon that the power of His Spirit don't tell me it can happen because Samson didn't have the Holy Ghost but the spirit Came Upon him I'm not hearing you and he did something when the spirit Came Upon him he that deny the Holy Ghost but he walked on water I'm not hearing you I'm not here with you I'm not hearing you even without the Holy Ghost he was in the Supernatural Jesus he said Jesus if that is you beat me to come and Jesus said come one word come what would make a normal man walk out a boat to walk like Jesus I'm not hearing you Jesus was walking on the water and just said he says that you'll be me to come just say come I ain't coming if you don't say come if you say karma coming because I know you are the boss that is when they could really trust God that's when they can really have faith in God and Peter start to walk as he was watching Jesus of course the devil get a fight because the devastating potential and anytime the devacy potentially want to kill it so you rip up some waves and Peter took his eyes off of Jesus and look on the waves and they begin to sink in but you know what along with him yes among the brethren he said Lord I'm taking and I kind of like that no Peter could swim he's a fisherman all fishermen could swim but Peter wasn't taking no risk why take risk and Jesus is there [Applause] he could pull you up so we're talking about restoring the faith right one time she was in the boat he labored he he preached and Barnes said real a preaching services like two days hard labor Jill was so tired he was in deep sleep storm rocking never see opportunity sinking no you think the devil wouldn't sink you to get a chance I'll give somebody a shout about human Angels fighting for you [Applause] some of you is training to say Amen on that you know we're gonna need Spirit Realm the angel and Camp around those that you don't accidentally Lord protect you from you know situations God breaks you from you have nothing to do with that Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah understand this it's forces from above and first round below and you are in between and that God has to fight for you [Applause] when you think it's bad it could have been worse Jesus in the boat he's tired devil cake was storm the boat is rocking after a while the disciples recognize they cannot hand it on their own let's wake Jesus wake him he's sleeping he's not dead he's only sleeping he's only in the silence he's not dead he's only sleeping of little faith what is he saying about a Jerome if you had Faith you was going to speak to that storm so you got to know you got to know who God is you got to know who you are and you got to know who the devil is who God is is God is in me right here and the faith is inside of you you got to know who you are that you are a son just like me I am the first born among many Brethren so I want you to know that you have the potential to do what I did so he could tell them oh ye of little faith and then you've got to know who kicking up that storm because the Bible said the winds were contrary and when sometimes the winds in your life it broke contrary you did not ask for the wind you didn't do something and that's why the wind comes you didn't throw sin and the wind come sometimes the winds just blow contrary but he's the god of the contrary rim could handle that contrary when Don't Be Afraid when the wind broke contrary in your life or around your life come tonight you're going to begin to sneak to the storm you're going to speak for your children stop nagging them stop brutalizing now or speak prophesy over them tell them you're gonna be delivered tell them you will come out of it tell them you're going to be free speak Satan Speak Life speak the word [Applause] I want to challenge you tonight speak life I don't care they were in her pants mean is good speak the word speak their Deliverance speak their Victory speak the victory something gonna break the anointing gonna break the anointing gonna break the Yoke the anointing comes for a purpose the yoke is going to be broken by the anointing all the years retired word with books with tapes with quotes it hasn't worked but the anointing is coming [Applause] is going to break I feel it tonight

prayers as people oh hallelujah hallelujah to all you have is the time that I want you to do that's all we have because there's gonna come A Midnight Cry going out to meet him here it has to be restored in manifestation and demonstration who is going to preach it I'm gonna preach it until it materializes I'm going to stay here until their signs until there is wonders until there was Miracles until the cripples start to walk and the blind starters see that's my job that's your job in the Church of the Living God tonight raise the power and all that was in God he poured into Christ all I was in Christ he pours into the church [Applause] I am convinced the word is in me what is in you but we want water we want the rain you may be seated but we have a prophecies for you tonight God told Joel it shall come to pass I will pour out the rain the former rain and the Latin rain in the first month oh my God in your facts shall be overflow with oil and wine all glory to Cork it's gonna overflow my Jesus my my God my God damn it said my cup running over flow press down running over when God pour you on a president and they're going to pour down upon you are you gonna run over David

enemy have to see it God will bring them out just in time to see it have to see it because you are the Son of God you are the daughter of God have to see it give them a chance to laugh let me see this give them a chance to laugh at your condition at your sick condition blind but he must see you know the story he was begging every day and that day nobody on the street what's happening I'm getting nobody to support me and then somebody said Jesus is on the next rate Lord have mercy upon me he began to cry out not seek out not depressed out not sad out because Jesus is not there near him he began to cry out Hearts cry out what that crying out was a symbolism of the faith inside of him because Jesus couldn't hear his cry literally but that faith in his soul hit heaven and Heaven touched Jesus and Jesus couldn't help it he has to walk whoever faith is whoever faith is Power is coming and seven Thunders the faith and Faith but lead us to power and power will take us to the promise to manifest the promise and the Bible is the road map of God's power and hate must lead yeah how many consultant that one [Applause] say it again said that the road map you may be seated is the Bible and Faith leads you to power and power lead you to the promise you see we're born in sin shape iniquity so we're born defeated so we have nothing to boast about our abortion is in the blood our boss is in the cross because Jesus Come To Die to redeem us and the world to redeem is to bring us back so he then comes into a halfway job I come to redeem them but I can't make no because things hot boy things really pressure no he released the Redemption by releasing the book it was a book of redemption now if the book is sealed you don't know for sure you're there because your name is sealed up but once that book is unsealed you have the opportunity to connect listen to who you really are [Applause] you talk there was a sinner you thought it was a Baptist and Methodist your Witness Catholic you taught that but when the book opened [Applause] then you recognize that you are son and daughter of God not of your mother and father [Applause] your mother only give you physical characteristics but you are the physical manifestation of the attribute that you are in God so God put that German you in the Ducks in your dust [Applause] of God [Applause] I understand the Bible said the word alone is a discerner of the thoughts our intents of the heart so the heart is uh no trespasses please for the devil I'm no trespass sign over your heart so the devil can't come and trespass what God have as a hidden Mystery in inside of you which is the term now because it's inside you Jesus could plainly say all that the father hath given me will come he's not in that all the father not not giving me a heart given me past tense you're not no sir [Applause] you're getting a revelation of the blood that brought you but God put your jam in the book and when we preach the word we are preaching your name that is why you could shout out the world that is why you can get excited because when you hear the word yes you have your struggle in your flesh yes you have battles in your mind you're supposed to have the battle if you have no back for something wrong [Music] so God allow the loose end spirit Spirit the god of the Loose Ends in the spirit people that loose in their life you see because the foolish versions are really free thinkers action they want to do their own thing if they talk to them they get vexed they do like you say you like how you say it you're like what you say they do like this free thinkers but God have a pattern a seamstress work with a pattern I said Jessica just watch you and say okay you're looking like size 18. give me the clothes gamer scissors let me go [Applause] you know don't go back again it's trouble somebody said okay just give me clothing images no measurement no pattern no nothing that's dangerous she could give you a second so so you just don't do that well God had a pattern there it is [Applause] so when God sees us come out God can say oh you don't like it so how you like it himself can't do that making not God he said I am God and I change not my pattern change not a state first for two second knowledge State game Templars damn patience then you know coming to Godliness then you have that forgiveness because faith is based on [Applause] planet [Applause] go watch the devil knew faith is beasts upon forgiveness because that's what being preached so his job is to make sure it have some solidots and some concrete Grudge long standing for years Family Feud for years and the devil tell them go to church but do not forgive at all same and same and Hallelujah say Glory Glory Glory raise and raise and awake wait wait but when you go home yes I can't afford that [Applause] so if that church was this past against that Pastor this belief against the believer husband fighting with wife why are you fighting with children dog fighting with cat everybody fighting no forgiveness because once forgiveness start to be effective you put yourself in a position to be like God because he smiles on the just and on the unjust and the rain just Falls on the tomato tree and the marijuana tree [Applause] durian duplicate righteous today I am falling on no my ownership no ganja crap only corn tomatoes and melon and watermelon what do farmers like I go move that way the rain don't talk that way they Ruiner just fall and every seed bring forth after escape and if there is a son of God's seed shown in your heart and that rainfall it's got to bring forth I thought after its kind a Godly kind a kind of holy kind a righteous kind every seed brings forth [Applause] so let the devil do his do we got to do our do [Applause] you can't help it you can't help manifest God you you can't help heal the sick you you can't help speak the word you can't have walked by the spirit you can't walk you can't help being led by the spirit that is just how you are that is just what you do that is just how you live you live by the spirit you talk by the spirit you walk by faith you talk by faith You Preach by faith you testify by faith you live by that's it [Music] but Obama walking the conventions already in five minutes the Holy Spirit saw the move and people start to walk out the wheelchair he did not preach he just walked and the angel walking with him how are we going to return to that yes sir we call it the return to the days of the Apostles oh God they're gonna be Apostles Comfort power Comfort man of God Comfort like

anoint these people to do what they do and live what to live how much more the Holy Ghost could come upon Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God how much more Oh Glory to God I'm gonna close Oh Glory that God is almost midnight but listen to this God sent a prophet before the Dreadful day of the Lord what we are preaching is what is before the truthfully of the Lord Elias

pass them in the wilderness God is God almighty he loves when there's a Goliath to bring for David the issue is not Goliath the issue is where is David [Applause] Hallelujah Jordan is not the problem is if we are Faith to put our feet in Jordan and see Jordan roll back notice Elijah he never questioned he never pray oh God look at Jordan River he took his mantle and he struck the Jordan River you know what Jordan I'm coming true no question asked [Applause] no we have to learn from that we must learn from that there never was a people like this people God was waiting on you [Applause]
