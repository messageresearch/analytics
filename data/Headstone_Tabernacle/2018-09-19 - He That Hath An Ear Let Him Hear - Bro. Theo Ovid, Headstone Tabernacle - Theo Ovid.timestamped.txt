[26:48] around but you choose a certain walk
[26:51] this is the way we call the narrow way
[26:53] which is the harder way you choose this
[26:56] and this is what I see as a choice is a
[26:58] young man when I go to meet 17 I choose
[27:01] this route me not to forget girlfriend
[27:03] and this and that all I was focusing on
[27:05] the Lord and pleasing him Amen I've lost
[27:08] this one I lost that one when I was
[27:10] pleasing him because I was called to
[27:12] serve him the new caste of God in the
[27:15] world at the same time there can be in
[27:17] between you have to make up your mind
[27:19] you have to be clear and clean and that
[27:22] a choice of choosing Christ has brought
[27:25] nine like the way this right now it's a
[27:27] right choice you can't go wrong - in
[27:30] Christ or glory let go because you're

[28:23] of the tree of life which is the midst
[28:26] of the paradise of God and I love the
[28:28] type and a reference that was brought on
[28:29] Sunday now when you get the subjects
[28:31] like a reward for the five years in
[28:32] school or you're doing exams you have a
[28:34] reward going on rewards with overcomers
[28:36] and you know the beauty things beautiful
[28:38] thing about it every easy overcomers
[28:40] there wasn't a single age that God never
[28:43] overcome up every single age of
[28:45] overcomers what about this age what
[28:48] about your age what about your time and
[28:51] me I declare and this is the age of the
[28:53] overcomer overcomer it's you the
[28:56] individual and then one of a bunch of
[28:59] overcomers you the individual called to
[29:02] overcome your the individual Porter here
[29:05] is not the Church of you the individual
[29:08] have to have a ear to hear that's just a
[29:10] commercial nonsense come with your
[29:11] foolishness or glory to God and receive
[29:14] Christ and walk in the light of the
[29:15] world that you could please God that God
[29:18] proud of you that going to boast about
[29:20] you glory to God got to tell your whole
[29:23] family against you you still serve him
[29:25] because Joseph was like that or glory
[29:29] does his own bread and rejected him but
[29:31] he was predestinated he was elected he
[29:34] was called he was chosen and I don't
[29:36] care what you go through tonight I've
[29:38] got elected you that disease of Devils
[29:40] in hell
[29:40] thanks for that election that's why you
[29:43] should be shocked in tonight no trial no
[29:49] testing to cancel your election and God
[29:52] because we saw me he called we call he
[29:55] justified and we justified he has
[29:58] already gone resign
[29:59] [Applause]
[30:03] amen so here's the way you overcome
[30:07] first you have to overcome then you can
[30:09] eat the fruit it's over come up you
[30:12] remember the other night our teaching
[30:13] last night janitor get in the spirit
[30:15] before you saw anything how are you
[30:18] wanna set scene if he's not about this
[30:20] I'm gonna listen to him if he had
[30:22] presbyterian I'd listen to him if we
[30:24] don't teach just exactly what my to
[30:25] teaches you ain't going to overcome he
[30:29] said because you ain't got in the spirit
[30:31] yet you are all out of order
[30:35] getting the spirits the Lord Jesus I
[30:37] love you now reveal to me anything you
[30:39] see fit just bring it to me and then
[30:42] you're getting all right like I hear
[30:46] this pre pastor I have this preacher
[30:47] this one and the embryos in had to leave
[30:50] but if you're in the spirit you just
[30:52] looking for the Lord to speak to you you
[30:53] want a word from the Lord
[30:55] you know Buckley's that don't you gotta
[30:56] lose that man then the pulpit praise God
[30:59] I don't care what that man come with a
[31:00] night because you have a need because
[31:02] you have a daughter of God because you
[31:04] are son of God God's going to anoint
[31:06] that man to speak to your need who are
[31:09] going to anoint that man to speak to
[31:11] your condition it would be by direct
[31:13] inspiration not some intellectual word
[31:15] word no the spirit lane three times in
[31:23] the Bible speaks of the Tree of Life
[31:25] Genesis three times
[31:26] revelation three times and that's the
[31:28] two books at the devil hates Genesis
[31:31] revelation three books because Genesis
[31:33] Stella is beginning revelation tell you
[31:36] his ending he hates those two books then
[31:39] he was seen on my right hand as the tree
[31:40] quality of life and the left
[31:42] is that called the tree of knowledge how
[31:45] many know that the Bible said that is
[31:46] the tree of life and there's a tree of
[31:48] knowledge and Adam lost his fellowship
[31:50] with God when he took the bite of
[31:53] knowledge but the tree of life was to be
[31:56] handled by faith and faith alone God
[31:58] said so I believe it God said so he's a
[32:00] healer
[32:01] God said so he's a deliverer taught yet
[32:03] so he's away makeup I'm not trying to
[32:05] figure out anything I'm trusting the
[32:06] Lord or glory to God
[32:09] and then you have confidence and all
[32:10] Romans 8:28 and we know that all things
[32:13] work together for good to them that love
[32:15] God the devil I be called according to
[32:17] his purpose
[32:18] and your trust the Lord and your trust
[32:20] his goodness and yes trust his judgment
[32:23] he will be right on your behalf so when
[32:34] Jesus encountered easy scribes and
[32:36] Pharisees and these religious people
[32:38] this is all far as it manna in the
[32:39] wilderness and he said everyone did oh
[32:45] my manna in the wilderness they eat
[32:48] bread in the villainess you see but the
[32:49] dead
[32:49] they said I am The Living bread this is
[32:55] Genesis talking back in all be the Tree
[32:57] of Life in the form of the bread of life
[32:58] speaking to them now I am The Living
[33:01] bread if a man eat or to me he shall not
[33:04] die oh my the bed of life was from the
[33:07] tree of life where they were eaten from
[33:09] the gardener Eden he was The Tree of
[33:11] Life now if the Tree of Life was a
[33:12] person the tree of knowledge as a person
[33:16] it's just two trees and the fortress is
[33:20] two trees one is a word in the lecture
[33:23] line I wanted the spirit line and the
[33:25] spirit line is the Tree of Life
[33:27] Oh glory to God so Jesus said your
[33:30] father's eat manna in the wilderness and
[33:32] they are dead but I am the bread of life
[33:33] what bread of life from Eden that a man
[33:36] may eat this bread and shall not die
[33:39] what did the angel said they stopped
[33:41] Adam from that tree the god the tree li
[33:44] si papi can live forever if you eat of
[33:47] that tree of life you live forever
[33:48] eternal life so the angel was yet to
[33:51] block the tree stopped an atom from take
[33:53] another tree because you already broke
[33:55] the Covenant already he broke the word
[33:57] from the Lord already but right now in
[33:59] this hour
[34:00] those same angels those same several
[34:02] films they are not God in the tree they
[34:05] are driving you back to the tree
[34:06] everything your father and I said get
[34:08] back up you do something wrong repent
[34:10] they keep pushing your or don't stay
[34:13] there
[34:13] you can live higher than that
[34:15] you're not hired and the animals you a
[34:17] little lower than the Angels
[34:19] oh come on get the come on Oh give the
[34:21] Lord a show go ahead and make your head
[34:24] stop be like an animal border collies
[34:26] higher than the animals who are totally
[34:28] lower than the Angels
[34:29] well give the Lord a shout you are sons
[34:32] of God you are called to a higher level
[34:34] you are called to a higher plane
[34:39] [Music]
[34:40] hallelujah praise the priests go priest
[34:44] oh so SI instead of the angel oh they're
[34:47] trying to keep him from this tree it is
[34:49] driving them along to this tree the
[34:51] angels of the churches to every person
[34:53] bring them back to the name of Jesus
[34:55] Christ who is the Tree of Life
[34:57] so all God trying to get you back is to
[34:59] the world but trying to get you back to
[35:01] the life what time you getting back to
[35:03] the tree
[35:04] what time I get back there get you back
[35:05] to the spirit line because the Bible
[35:07] said knowledge shall increase or glory
[35:09] because it is a way of knowledge and man
[35:12] is being trained to depend upon
[35:14] knowledge and what man knowledge has
[35:16] produced that produced banker automatic
[35:19] this automatic that computers phones
[35:21] everything else that's intelligence a
[35:23] man that's not faith in God a man in
[35:26] God's kingdom you don't even need a
[35:28] cellphone in lights I was hearing what
[35:31] he was talking God hallelujah hallelujah
[35:35] them talking all the secrets analyzing
[35:38] at normal normal normal and he's in
[35:41] himself that was wireless long time we
[35:43] had that long time or give the Lord a
[35:46] shout in the earth
[35:47] [Applause]
[35:51] what automatic automatic Peter was
[35:54] imprisoned in the gate open
[35:55] automatically
[35:57] we had automatic stuff long time
[36:00] hallelujah praise God
[36:02] Martha bill to the iron makers 11 a
[36:04] yacht and big boat or what not and Jesus
[36:06] walked on the water so we could cancel
[36:10] and buffet gravity and do a lot of stuff
[36:13] that man knows nothing about the center
[36:17] killed dead and Jesus said I go wake her
[36:19] she sleep X let's go and wake her get
[36:23] the unbeliever out that's what we're
[36:25] talking about five lost positions
[36:27] blessed multiply it that's what we
[36:30] talkin about can't you see the poor the

[1:09:25] home stretch here now this empirics that
[1:09:27] has me final that Joseph taken among his
[1:09:29] brethren several to himself his brothers
[1:09:31] and then they come such a greeting
[1:09:32] realized as long as they dwelt in a
[1:09:35] dwelling place and kept up that's a good
[1:09:37] thing to stay in the place positionally
[1:09:39] but they got rid of the spirit they know
[1:09:42] that birthmarks they're no positionally
[1:09:45] were there but this spirit the spirit
[1:09:49] lion got dismissed said they could know
[1:09:51] and talk and no one talked and talked
[1:09:53] and no one talked and no and no one
[1:09:54] talked but when the spirit is out this
[1:09:58] just no one talked
[1:09:59] the fundamentals today positionally know
[1:10:02] where they are by intellectual
[1:10:04] conception of the Bible but there is no
[1:10:07] spirit you know why they have rejected
[1:10:11] juices they tune them out they want
[1:10:16] nothing to do with it
[1:10:17] it's a bunch of holy rollers they have
[1:10:19] ex communities in him they were out of
[1:10:22] their fellowship the church feels they
[1:10:25] don't need a Holy Spirit the treasure
[1:10:26] will tell you that men can step up and
[1:10:28] give you such an election and they let
[1:10:29] you talk that can almost make you
[1:10:32] believe it no let's stop in a minute
[1:10:33] didn't Jesus say too close so close
[1:10:36] together the elected it was possible is
[1:10:39] it the intellectual talks would be so
[1:10:41] smooth that it would deceive the people
[1:10:44] it is gospel it is man who can handle
[1:10:47] that one in such a way that he could
[1:10:50] make any intellectual person if they are
[1:10:53] trusting in the intellectuals they would
[1:10:55] condemn the Holy Spirit and take the way
[1:10:57] of man
[1:10:58] Oh glory to God you see when they
[1:11:01] condemn the Holy Spirit
[1:11:02] that's a boost about the man that
[1:11:04] bringing all these intellectual
[1:11:05] revelations I the matter yeah oh yeah

[1:11:11] following a man that's right the man
[1:11:13] Christ Jesus or give the Lord some
[1:11:15] praises the Holy Ghost is the prophet of
[1:11:17] the hour that's right a spirit the

[1:19:31] are you at me now so watch let's not
[1:19:34] leap see at baptism he said let's not
[1:19:37] believe in our Lord Jesus being baptized
[1:19:39] let's not stop because he cleans my life
[1:19:40] of sin but now we press into a position
[1:19:43] to our promise for the baptism of the
[1:19:46] Holy Ghost
[1:19:47] for the promise unto you and to your
[1:19:49] children and them that were far off and
[1:19:52] ho Joshua and hotels Moomin occlusion
[1:19:55] wizard come please
[1:19:56] and a woman told them that the children
[1:19:59] were born by inspiration and how each
[1:20:01] man by their groanings and travailing
[1:20:04] they were pleased positionally by names
[1:20:06] and so on like that he said God how that
[1:20:09] God has set some in the church through
[1:20:10] their labor pains they get tremendous
[1:20:12] sometimes tremendous sometimes so what
[1:20:15] pain you in what hurt in you what pain
[1:20:17] you talk about some time you painted
[1:20:18] your own pin your own out your moat give
[1:20:21] me a trouble mo put you in trouble
[1:20:24] and you get poor with your aunt and your
[1:20:26] uncle and your auntie an amoeba and
[1:20:27] whatnot I need one day and this one
[1:20:29] scene that and you study fire then
[1:20:31] agenda runnin and duckin hide we not
[1:20:34] talk about that you know that you this
[1:20:36] is Labor pins now you see Jesus was led
[1:20:40] by the Holy Ghost in rebellion as years
[1:20:42] this was painful since God quote Sarah
[1:20:49] wilderness because we repeat assume we
[1:20:51] sow you reap it wasn't that he was led
[1:20:54] by the Holy Ghost to deal with the devil
[1:20:57] and the devil didn't know who he was
[1:21:00] Deborah Scott was ordinary Joseph's son
[1:21:02] carpenter Boyer Mary he in the same
[1:21:05] homes and whatnot
[1:21:06] I mean and if thou be the Son of God
[1:21:08] turned his bread stone in the bread and
[1:21:11] Jesus watch his stone and I know deep
[1:21:13] already let me feel the anointing not
[1:21:15] that he just say that back and he was
[1:21:17] tempted you know like when you have a
[1:21:21] good cake or bacon somebody to touch it
[1:21:24] and all the nose glands activated all
[1:21:29] these smells right smells you see I get
[1:21:32] nothin I sure don't even touch that that
[1:21:36] like I don't want this sin but it is it
[1:21:40] smelling good but Jesus was tempted and
[1:21:44] it's it's written so that means he put
[1:21:47] his his desires and his aside to talk to
[1:21:51] to connect with the word that say man
[1:21:54] Charlie my bread alone but maybe he's
[1:21:56] hungry
[1:21:58] it's not like if I said they are
[1:22:00] trainers what you know mean he's hungry
[1:22:05] never say a meat bread this one fresh
[1:22:08] fresh fresh I said man shall live I
[1:22:11] pedal by every word that proceedeth say
[1:22:14] oh never say aha ok I'm he beside the
[1:22:18] right doggone good onto the wood no and
[1:22:20] see what I mean if he shall see showers
[1:22:22] milady angels be up if you take a jump
