[52:12] seated Oh Praise
[52:17] godall
[52:20] I have a title this
[52:22] morning an end the end is come
[52:27] that's the title this morning am an
[52:30] end the end is
[52:35] come and brother Braham was praying I
[52:38] believe in perfect strength by Perfect
[52:40] weakness and he was saying there's only
[52:42] one thing left father that I can see
[52:45] that either you rise up somewhere with
[52:46] some empty vessels and make this world
[52:49] ashamed of itself or send Jesus right
[52:52] quick that the end is here Lord there
[52:55] are only two things left to be done and
[52:57] we must see it right away for we know
[52:59] it's at the end either we will see
[53:02] something rise right away or we will see
[53:04] the coming of the Lord all prophecies
[53:07] fulfilled the last thing before the
[53:09] church was resurrected before she was
[53:11] taken up in Revelation the 3rd Chapter
[53:14] there's a comfort of messenger unto the
[53:16] Lan Church age that would turn the
[53:18] hearts of the people back to the early
[53:21] fathers hear this part get them back to
[53:25] the regular p
[53:27] cost that they claim to have So This
[53:31] Heart of the fathers is not heart back
[53:33] to education or information is to what
[53:35] they had and the church was bued on the
[53:38] day of Pentecost when they received God
[53:40] in them it was God above them Pillar of
[53:43] Fire it was God with them in Jesus
[53:45] Christ and God came in them and they
[53:48] were living monuments of God not church
[53:52] people not church folks they were
[53:53] representing God their lives were
[53:56] declaring God and that is what this
[53:58] message come to do turn our hearts back
[54:01] to that that we can reflect God H not
[54:04] reflect embarrassment and compromise and
[54:07] shame and you know as Christians no not
[54:08] that reflect God like how he wanted to
[54:11] be C but Peter they had to take note
[54:14] that they have been with Jesus because
[54:16] they were manifest in Jesus Christ oh
[54:18] give the Lord some Praises glory to God
[54:22] there were thousands time thousands like
[54:23] it wasn't there a Noah Lord would be
[54:25] lost
[54:27] many of them would be lost amen so we
[54:31] know that this book that came ration 10
[54:35] wasn't wasn't a normal book that was a
[54:37] book of names that book had your names
[54:39] in it that was the title lead of the
[54:41] earth that was the authority that Adam
[54:43] had that Adam lost and because the devil
[54:46] couldn't catch it because he was kicked
[54:48] out of from heaven and fell on the earth
[54:50] he couldn't hold the deed to claim
[54:51] anything it went back in the hands of
[54:53] the original owner God himself waiting
[54:56] for who is worthy to take the book and
[54:59] no man was found worthy because all of
[55:00] us was born in sh and sa iniquity but
[55:03] Christ came and when he died he was
[55:05] worthy to take the book so he took the
[55:07] book and he dropped down on the earth to
[55:09] loose your name on the earth that God
[55:11] could find you all that the father ha
[55:14] given me will come so because your name
[55:16] was in the book you had to find you
[55:18] wherever you was in Trinidad you had to
[55:19] find you where is Hindu Muslim Baptist
[55:22] Methodist je witness Pentecostal he had
[55:24] to find you because you are not a musl
[55:26] Muslim a Hindu a Baptist a Pentecostal
[55:28] you are Sons and Daughters of the Living
[55:30] God oh give the Lord some praises and
[55:33] your last days God have promised all
[55:35] these churches he promised Sons and
[55:37] Daughters of God and if God make another
[55:40] son it will be a Son of God if God make
[55:43] another daughter it'll be a daughter of
[55:44] God that daughter and son must be born
[55:47] Supernatural not of the will of the
[55:49] flesh not of the will of men but of God
[55:53] oh glory to go say something have to
[55:55] happen to you and if it never happened
[55:57] to you it can happen to you
[55:59] today glory to God do you believe that
[56:02] so Seven
[56:04] Seals first seal second seal third seal
[56:06] ceas had a break and the seventh seal
[56:10] Revelation 81
[56:12] silence and the prophet said this here
[56:14] now remember that this seven seal is the
[56:17] end of time of all
[56:19] things the things written in the seven
[56:22] sealed book sealed up the Plan of
[56:25] Redemption from before the foundation of
[56:27] the world it every bit
[56:30] ends you see from a fundamental level
[56:33] Jesus died to save us and we are saved
[56:37] but it's a little deeper than that Jesus
[56:40] died to get back sons that he for new
[56:44] [Music]
[56:46] am in other words he died that he could
[56:48] bring on our
[56:50] justification and Justified doesn't mean
[56:52] forgiven Justified means you never did
[56:54] it amen Hallelujah we are only here
[56:58] because of Adam if Adam didn't fall we
[57:01] wasn't going to be
[57:02] fallen Adam fell we all fell but when
[57:06] Christ raised up we all raise
[57:08] [Applause]
[57:10] up so we only are here because of what
[57:13] Adam did you say well how God blaming us
[57:16] for what Adam did like one man fall and
[57:18] all of us fall well what did Christ do
[57:20] he was one man too but he paid the price
[57:22] to get us
[57:23] back so don't talk about Adam fall talk
[57:26] about Christ did something to get us
[57:29] back that we wouldn't be Sinners no more
[57:32] we could be he answer the sin question
[57:34] we could be free from sin he said woman
[57:37] go and sin no more who the son of man
[57:39] set free is free free from your past

[1:07:38] nations and Jerusalem shall be Tren down
[1:07:41] of the Gentiles
[1:07:43] until the times of the Gentiles be
[1:07:47] fulfilled so God cut off the Jews to
[1:07:50] give us Gentiles a chance and he called

[1:08:20] time we know what's coming what make the

[1:08:26] of ethics and morals and behavior and
[1:08:28] attitude and life it's a book of
[1:08:31] Prophecy that is what make it so
[1:08:33] distinguish from every other is a book
[1:08:35] of Prophecy that's why Ezekiel was told
[1:08:37] to say thus sayth the Lord not thus say
[1:08:40] Ezekiel thus say the Lord and end the
[1:08:43] end is come
[1:08:46] Hallelujah Jesus Matthew
[1:08:49] 13 He gave a mystery of the tears and
[1:08:52] wheat Jesus was busting Parables and Par
[1:08:55] is hidden mysteries in story form Jesus
[1:08:58] was a Mastercraft Storyteller he tells
[1:09:02] stories call them Parables their
[1:09:05] stories another Parable he put forth
[1:09:08] saying the Kingdom of Heaven is like not
[1:09:10] a man which swed good seed in his field
[1:09:14] but while men
[1:09:16] slept sometime when you sleeping you who
[1:09:19] L inside of here you are talking
[1:09:21] to other people can

[1:09:48] guy you know after you SW your good
[1:09:50] seeds the man wait till sleeping and he
[1:09:52] put in the seeds
[1:09:55] hallah and when the blade was sprung up
[1:09:59] and brought forth fruit then appeared
[1:10:00] the tears also so the Servants of the
[1:10:02] household came and said him sir this
[1:10:04] that thou so good seed in the field from
[1:10:07] when then had it tears he said unto them
[1:10:10] a enemy had done
[1:10:12] it the servant said unto him will thou
[1:10:15] then that we go and gather him up he
[1:10:17] said no n Le he got up the tears you
[1:10:21] root up also the wheat with them let
[1:10:25] both
[1:10:27] grow
[1:10:29] together
[1:10:30] until the Harvest watch these words and
[1:10:34] in the time of harvest so it have
[1:10:37] Harvest and the actual time of harvest
[1:10:40] and in the time of harvest I will say to
[1:10:43] the Reapers Gather ye together first the
[1:10:46] tears and bind them in
[1:10:49] bundles and to burn them and gather the
[1:10:53] wheat into my B so let hidden Mystery
[1:10:55] here you know that God let both the true
[1:10:58] and the false grow together until the
[1:11:02] time of harvest hear these
[1:11:05] words the weat and
[1:11:07] tears which from the first age until now
[1:11:12] have grown side by side are
[1:11:14] harvested what NAA set out to accomplish
[1:11:17] has finally come to pass with all the
[1:11:20] might of
[1:11:21] organization the false Church turns from
[1:11:24] any V of Truth with their political
[1:11:27] might reinforces herself with State
[1:11:30] backing church back by
[1:11:33] state and set out to eradicate Forever
[1:11:36] The True Believer but just when she is
[1:11:39] about to accomplish a cowardly plot the
[1:11:41] wheat is gathered into the Ghana no
[1:11:45] longer will the wheat and tears go side
[1:11:47] by side no longer will the tears receive
[1:11:48] the blessings of God because of the
[1:11:51] presence of the
[1:11:52] wheat hold it whole it you mean tears
[1:11:58] get blessings of God because of the
[1:12:01] presence of the wheed that's
[1:12:06] right God come to bless the whe in but
[1:12:10] because the tears are there they get
[1:12:13] blessed
[1:12:14] also for the wheat will be gone and the
[1:12:17] wrath of God will be poured out in the
[1:12:20] six seal which will end in the utter
[1:12:23] destruction of the wicked
[1:12:26] now I said a moment ago that the false
[1:12:28] Vine came in full fruit sh in this age
[1:12:31] her fruit would mature and ripen and if
[1:12:34] you haven't listened to Wednesday night
[1:12:35] service about the question of growth
[1:12:37] Christian maturity you should listen to
[1:12:38] it yes because we have to come to
[1:12:41] maturity God see baby a certain way
[1:12:44] children a certain way young men a
[1:12:45] certain way and God see fathers a
[1:12:47] certain way all of them is stages of
[1:12:49] growth and God want us to get when I was
[1:12:52] a child I speak like a child I
[1:12:53] understood like a child when I become a
[1:12:55] man I push aside put away childish
[1:12:58] things you're coming into maturity you
[1:13:01] cannot get inheritance to a
[1:13:03] child God can't give power to a child so
[1:13:07] God want his children to come mature
[1:13:08] that he could place them in a position
[1:13:10] of power and
[1:13:11] authority Oh Glory to God and before you
[1:13:14] get power and authority over others you
[1:13:16] have to have power authority over
[1:13:18] yourself so God want that discipline
[1:13:20] that internal discipline within you so
[1:13:23] don't mind Nobody Business you have
[1:13:24] yours enough to mind oh give the Lord
[1:13:26] some Praises you have to deal with you
[1:13:29] glory to God you have to watch the
[1:13:30] mirror of the your mirror and see how
[1:13:33] you are doing and don't compare yourself
[1:13:35] with nobody else all right let's go so
[1:13:38] her fruit which is the false Vine fruit
[1:13:40] will mature on right that is correct
[1:13:42] this evil spirited Church full of
[1:13:45] iniquity will be revealed as the mustard
[1:13:47] seed that grew into a tree where in
[1:13:49] large all the fogs of the air at a head
[1:13:52] will be the Antichrist the mystery of
[1:13:54] iniquity all this is true and if this is
[1:13:57] true then it must also be true that the
[1:13:59] bright church WIll
[1:14:01] mature so therefore when the message is
[1:14:03] not an idle message the bride church
[1:14:05] WIll mature the bride church will come
[1:14:07] into maturity to manage you know what
[1:14:10] God want done with his word isn't that
[1:14:11] right and her rightness bright church
[1:14:14] will be an identification with her Lord
[1:14:17] by means of the word and ah head who
[1:14:20] will come to her is the mystery of
[1:14:22] godliness which indeed is Christ and as
[1:14:25] the false church with all cunning and
[1:14:28] diabolical power made up of political
[1:14:31] force physical force and Demon of
[1:14:34] Darkness they El strong you is a three
[1:14:38] cord they have political force they have
[1:14:41] physical Force plus they're empowered by
[1:14:43] Demons of Darkness to come against this
[1:14:45] True Vine that is why the prophecy is
[1:14:48] they will close us the type of churches
[1:14:49] they will close us down they have to
[1:14:51] because we represent something
[1:14:52] completely different when they were
[1:14:54] looking for Jes Jesus to come to have to
[1:14:56] make up an army to fight Rome Jesus come
[1:14:58] and say my
[1:15:00] kingdom they backing Jesus in we have a
[1:15:03] new we have a new leader only fores say
[1:15:06] my kingdom is not of this world don't
[1:15:08] come with me in this room thing at all I
[1:15:10] come to tell you about a higher Kingdom
[1:15:13] Hallelujah watch this the people looking
[1:15:16] for deliverance from Rome and Jesus come
[1:15:18] to bring them deliverance from
[1:15:23] themselves you say you have heard time I
[1:15:25] for I to for by sent to you love your
[1:15:27] enemies do good that's a terrible thing
[1:15:30] in man look at the sh cut receive Jesus
[1:15:32] having cut last to to fight and and
[1:15:34] fight Rome and bomb and and and
[1:15:36] exploding and rebel and that would
[1:15:40] looking for you know they're looking for
[1:15:41] a fighter a
[1:15:44] revolutionary and she said bless those
[1:15:46] who curse you do good to them who do
[1:15:49] evil to you if somebody ask for one coat
[1:15:52] give them two if somebody ask you to
[1:15:54] walk one mile walk two miles with
[1:15:56] [Applause]
[1:16:00] them completely contrary to what the
[1:16:03] expectation is and Jesus was so much
[1:16:06] like them so ordinary Judas had to say
[1:16:08] you want to
[1:16:12] kiss when Judas come Jesus said but gosh
[1:16:16] I was in the temple all the time you
[1:16:17] bring all these mental to get me you
[1:16:21] could have you could have S for him and
[1:16:22] said Jesus we want to see you you want
[1:16:23] to charge in charge
[1:16:25] room come with Force to take him so this
[1:16:29] church have political force physical
[1:16:31] Force Demons of Darkness come against
[1:16:33] the True Vine the True Vine with the
[1:16:34] fullness of the
[1:16:36] spirit and the word will do the very
[1:16:41] acts of power that Jesus did and they
[1:16:44] are ministers today who denying this
[1:16:47] know because they are dead in their sins

[1:19:59] the disciples came at him saying declare
[1:20:01] unto us the parable of the tears of the
[1:20:04] field is still a mystery to them and
[1:20:07] then Jesus break it to them he answered
[1:20:09] and said un them he that Sweat The Good
[1:20:11] Seed is the son of man all right the
[1:20:14] field is the world the good seed are the
[1:20:18] children of the Kingdom but the tears
[1:20:20] are the children of the wicked One Stop
[1:20:23] brother over it you the wicked one had
[1:20:25] children that's what we
[1:20:27] saying if the good sees his children the

[1:20:42] the
[1:20:43] devil the Harvest is the end of the
[1:20:45] world the reapers are the Angels so
[1:20:49] Jesus was very specific in revealing the
[1:20:52] mystery of this Parable and therefore
[1:20:54] the tears as a garded and burn in the
[1:20:55] fire so shall it be in the end of this
[1:20:58] world the son of man shall send forth
[1:21:01] his angels and they Shall Gather out of

[1:21:29] Jesus on Sunday
[1:21:32] morning month was
[1:21:34] June year
[1:21:39] 1933 brother Bram was given a series of
[1:21:41] seven
[1:21:43] Visions he called them major
[1:21:46] events that must happen or would happen
[1:21:50] before the coming of the Lord amen we
[1:21:55] want to look at some of those events
[1:21:58] some already passed some Is Yet To
[1:22:01] Come the first Vision was that of
[1:22:07] musolini he said that musolini would
[1:22:10] invade
[1:22:13] Ethiopia and the nation would fall at
[1:22:16] its
[1:22:16] steps that Vision surely did cause some
[1:22:20] repercussions and some were very angry
[1:22:23] when I said it
[1:22:25] and would not believe it but it happened
[1:22:28] that way you can put it up brother
[1:22:30] Nicholas he just walked in there with
[1:22:32] his modern arms and took over that's the
[1:22:35] dude musolini the natives didn't have a
[1:22:39] chance but the vision also said that
[1:22:40] musini will come to a horrible end with
[1:22:42] his own people turnning him and that
[1:22:44] came to pass
[1:22:46] exactly the next vision for told was an
[1:22:49] Austrian by the name of Adolf Hitler
[1:22:58] would rise up as a dictator over Germany
[1:23:01] and he would draw the world into
[1:23:04] war it showed a signf find line and how
[1:23:07] our troops would take a terrible time to
[1:23:08] overcome it then it shows Hitler came up
[1:23:10] to a mysterious
[1:23:11] end the third Vision was in the realm of
[1:23:15] world
[1:23:16] politics for it showed me that there
[1:23:19] would be three isms fascism Nazism
[1:23:21] communism and it was swallow up into the
[1:23:24] Third
[1:23:25] The Voice admonished watch Russia watch
[1:23:27] Russia keep your eye on the King of the
[1:23:32] North a next

[1:23:37] your eye on the King of the North and
[1:23:39] the man
[1:23:41] himself Vladimir

[1:23:49] inspired Hallelujah you have the bums
[1:23:53] ready to do
[1:23:55] what he is driven to
[1:23:58] do the Ford Vision showed a great
[1:24:00] advances in science that would come
[1:24:03] after the World War World War it headed
[1:24:06] up in a vision of a plastic bubble top
[1:24:10] car that was running down beautiful
[1:24:12] highways under remote
[1:24:15] control so that the people appeared
[1:24:18] seated in this car without a steering
[1:24:20] wheel and they were playing in some sort
[1:24:23] of game to amuse themselves the fifth
[1:24:25] Vision had to do with the moral problem
[1:24:28] of our age centering motion around women
[1:24:30] God showed me that the women begin to be
[1:24:32] out of their place with the granting of
[1:24:34] the vote then they cut off the here
[1:24:35] which signify that they no longer under
[1:24:37] authority of a man and insisted on equal
[1:24:39] rights in most cases more than equal
[1:24:42] rights she adopted men's clothing went
[1:24:44] into a state of undress and the last
[1:24:46] pict I saw was a woman naked except for
[1:24:48] a little fig Leaf apron with this Vision
[1:24:51] I saw a terrible perversion and moral
[1:24:54] plight on the whole world then the sixth
[1:24:58] Vision There Rose in America a most
[1:25:00] beautiful but cruel woman she held the
[1:25:03] people in her complete power I believe
[1:25:06] that this was the rise of the Catholic
[1:25:08] church and I though I believe I knew it
[1:25:10] could possibly be a vision of some woman
[1:25:13] rising in great power in America due to
[1:25:17] the popular vote by
[1:25:20] women the
[1:25:22] last and seventh
[1:25:24] Vision was wherein I heard a a most
[1:25:28] terrible
[1:25:29] explosion and as I looked turned to look
[1:25:33] I saw nothing but debris
[1:25:36] craters and
[1:25:38] smoke all over
[1:25:41] America and he also said that the Four
[1:25:43] Angels holding back the wars holding
[1:25:45] back World War II is holding back the
[1:25:48] vision of Destruction that will be
[1:25:51] coming to America are you still with me
[1:25:52] this morning yes
[1:25:55] I want to look back at the fourth Vision
[1:25:58] today the fourth Vision
[1:26:01] showed the great advances in science
[1:26:04] that would come after the second world
[1:26:06] war it was headed by the vision of a
[1:26:09] plastic bubbletop car which was running
[1:26:12] down beautiful highways under remote
[1:26:15] control so that people appeared seated
[1:26:18] in this car without a steering wheel and
[1:26:21] they were playing some sort of game to
[1:26:23] amuse themselves
[1:26:24] I know a couple of months ago I think
[1:26:26] was in January or early February I spoke
[1:26:28] a message about the intelligence and I
[1:26:30] was showing you one of the most advanced
[1:26:33] robot that they have talking and
[1:26:34] relating and so like that and even at
[1:26:37] that time they had already speeded up
[1:26:40] advancement in artificial intelligence
[1:26:42] and so like that but what I want to show
[1:26:44] you right now is connected to this for
[1:26:46] vision is the reason why I'm doing this
[1:26:48] and you'll see afterwards but
[1:26:51] this uh El M same guy with the chip in
[1:26:55] the brain and so on and Tesla and so
[1:26:58] like
[1:26:58] that uh they had up to what they call I
[1:27:01] think version 11 of the software trying
[1:27:04] to get to what they call FSD which is
[1:27:06] full what they call it full something
[1:27:09] driving
[1:27:11] um full full self-driving where the car
[1:27:14] will drive itself so what they had was
[1:27:17] codes written by humans saying where the
[1:27:20] road is and different things that if not
[1:27:22] turn so and whatnot whatnot
[1:27:24] but with this new version they have
[1:27:26] version 12 they remove all those quotes
[1:27:30] and they put in artificial intelligence
[1:27:32] that is now learning the roads and
[1:27:34] learning and whatnot so I want to put on
[1:27:37] that clip and you will see and get an
[1:27:39] idea of what it's look like but Nicholas
[1:27:42] I had the opportunity to write along
[1:27:44] with hullar's catalog who is one of the
[1:27:46] very few non-tesla employees who has
[1:27:49] version 12 of the full self-driving
[1:27:51] software installed on their car and he
[1:27:52] let me spend our afternoon choosing
[1:27:54] random way points around San Francisco
[1:27:56] to stress test it I'm going to do my
[1:27:58] best to describe how it actually feels
[1:28:00] when you're sitting inside the car and
[1:28:02] then a little later we're going to look
[1:28:03] at a couple of drives we did with both
[1:28:05] of our cars navigating the exact same
[1:28:07] route so we can get a real idea of
[1:28:09] differences between versions 11 and 12 a
[1:28:12] quick summary for people who don't keep
[1:28:13] up with this stuff version 12 is so
[1:28:15] important because it gets rid of the
[1:28:17] 300,000 plus lines of human written code
[1:28:20] that current versions of FSD rely on and
[1:28:23] replaces it with an endtoend AI
[1:28:25] architecture that learns from realworld
[1:28:27] driving Clips taken from good human
[1:28:29] drivers and then does its best to mimic
[1:28:32] that behavior that means that there's no
[1:28:34] specific code telling the car what Lane
[1:28:36] lines are how to stop at stop signs or
[1:28:39] red lights how to yield or who rideway
[1:28:41] it is absolutely none of that it's more
[1:28:44] of a Monkey C Monkey Do approach and
[1:28:47] saying it's a big change compared to how
[1:28:49] current versions work would probably be
[1:28:51] the understatement of the century many
[1:28:53] people seem to think think that changing
[1:28:55] the way the system works from the ground
[1:28:56] up like this is a negative thing but I
[1:28:58] assure you this is just how Tesla
[1:29:00] operates when I was an employee there
[1:29:02] during the beginning of the model 3
[1:29:04] production ramp I witnessed Engineers
[1:29:06] standing on the side of the production
[1:29:08] line watching in horror as the systems
[1:29:10] they probably spent months or even years
[1:29:12] of their lives developing were literally
[1:29:14] being removed with a hacksaw because
[1:29:16] they were slowing down production the
[1:29:18] same thing is now happening to the
[1:29:19] autopilot team sometimes starting fresh
[1:29:22] is better than pouring massive resources
[1:29:24] into making something work better and if
[1:29:26] there's a better way to do something
[1:29:28] Tesla wastes zero time in doing it which
[1:29:30] I personally believe is a major
[1:29:32] contributing factor in why they've
[1:29:33] become so successful I have a feeling
[1:29:35] that in the Noto distant future we're
[1:29:37] going to see AI do many things better
[1:29:40] than humans ever could which is a
[1:29:42] thought that really does keep me up at
[1:29:44] night with all that said let's get into
[1:29:46] my initial impressions of version 12 in
[1:29:49] a word I got to admit it's incredible it
[1:29:52] feels like the robot that used to drive
[1:29:54] the car has been replaced by a competent
[1:29:56] human and all the little micro
[1:29:58] adjustments and odd steering inputs I've
[1:30:00] gotten so used to while testing the beta
[1:30:02] over the years are either drastically
[1:30:04] reduced or completely eliminated it no
[1:30:06] longer feels like it's calculating what
[1:30:08] to do all the time and instead it just
[1:30:10] does it even when the car was dealing
[1:30:12] with something unexpected that would
[1:30:14] definitely trip up current versions like
[1:30:16] this light turning yellow while we were
[1:30:17] in the crosswalk it behaved naturally
[1:30:19] and confidently the full self-driving
[1:30:21] beta has been getting more and more
[1:30:23] smoother over the years but this thing's
[1:30:25] on a completely different level I kept
[1:30:27] waiting for the moment it was going to
[1:30:29] screw up and do a hard break like it
[1:30:31] usually does when pedestrians walk out
[1:30:32] in front of you but that moment never
[1:30:34] came here you can see it's not even
[1:30:36] stopping as these pedestrians cross the
[1:30:38] street just a smooth slow down and a
[1:30:40] smooth speed up I can't overstate how
[1:30:42] much better the interactions with
[1:30:44] pedestrians are it still treats them
[1:30:46] with additional caution but doesn't feel
[1:30:48] scared of them anymore this is something
[1:30:50] pretty hard to get across when you're
[1:30:52] just watching a video like this but when
[1:30:53] you're actually in the car it will
[1:30:55] become immediately apparent there were
[1:30:57] some parts of the drive where it was
[1:30:59] truly hard to believe that the car was
[1:31:01] doing it all itself here you can see it
[1:31:04] completely ignoring the lane lines and
[1:31:06] drives this road the same way the human
[1:31:08] ahead of us does I mean I guess it
[1:31:10] shouldn't really surprise me seeing how
[1:31:12] the only thing it knows is human driving
[1:31:14] behavior but to actually experience it
[1:31:16] in person is just crazy it's also gotten
[1:31:20] significantly better at controlling for
[1:31:22] Speed bumps older versions of the the
[1:31:24] beta were pretty hit and miss depending
[1:31:25] on the type of speed bump it was but
[1:31:27] version 12 seems to be consistently good
[1:31:30] this is finally the version of full
[1:31:32] self-driving that your wife will let you
[1:31:34] use while she's in the car I don't use
[1:31:36] current versions when I have my dogs in
[1:31:37] the back or there's people riding with
[1:31:39] me unless I'm on the highway or they
[1:31:41] specifically ask me cuz it can be a
[1:31:43] rough experience sometimes but this is
[1:31:45] more comfortable than the vast majority
[1:31:47] of Uber drivers I've ever had which is
[1:31:49] something I didn't think I'd be saying
[1:31:51] about the beta for a very long time and
[1:31:54] to me the wildest part about all this is
[1:31:57] that during elon's live stream we
[1:31:58] learned that V12 has only been in
[1:32:00] development for about a year one year of
[1:32:03] training this and this is what it can do
[1:32:06] can you imagine what this is going to
[1:32:07] look like in another year or two from
[1:32:10] now
[1:32:12] so we are getting there we are getting
[1:32:16] to and you know I ask myself the
[1:32:19] question why is all of this coming at
[1:32:22] this point in time
[1:32:24] 5 years ago we wasn't hearing about
[1:32:26] artificial intelligence 5 years ago we
[1:32:28] wasn't hearing about some of these
[1:32:29] things but now it's it's the thing they
[1:32:32] say you don't even need to code you
[1:32:33] could tell the artificial to code and
[1:32:35] write this and code and do that and it's
[1:32:37] doing it so I want to put on another one
[1:32:39] that you could look at and we'll put in
[1:32:41] the next one just see where you want to
[1:32:43] go so we going put on the next clip and
[1:32:45] after
[1:32:46] that imagine having a car where you just
[1:32:49] say where you want to go and the car
[1:32:51] takes you there that's what exists today
[1:32:53] with Tesla any Tesla can do this let me
[1:32:57] demonstrate for
[1:32:59] you take me to the Filmore Heritage
[1:33:04] garage all right here's where I want to
[1:33:12] go and we're
[1:33:15] off simple as
[1:33:19] that so we're in a pretty Narrow Street
[1:33:22] it needs to make a right turn here
[1:33:24] you can see in the visualization here it
[1:33:26] sees people it sees buses it sees
[1:33:29] everything it needs to make driving
[1:33:32] decisions so we're making a right turn
[1:33:34] here but we've got a pedestrian who's
[1:33:36] Crossing in the crosswalk we've got a
[1:33:38] car
[1:33:39] driving we need The Pedestrian to finish
[1:33:42] Crossing before we can make a right
[1:33:44] turn and there we
[1:33:47] go tons of traffic buses cars no problem
[1:33:58] a lot of people don't
[1:34:00] know you can just uh enjoy your commute
[1:34:04] it does highways it does city streets
[1:34:06] you just sit back relax and watch it
[1:34:10] make sure it's not doing anything crazy
[1:34:12] making any
[1:34:13] mistakes but they can pretty much do
[1:34:17] everything for
[1:34:22] you definitely makes it the drive a lot
[1:34:24] more relaxing you can listen to music
[1:34:26] listen to a podcast and kind of zone out
[1:34:29] a little
[1:34:31] bit and not worry about things okay A
[1:34:34] little bit of heartbreaking there
[1:34:36] possibly because of the people sitting
[1:34:38] in that Cafe or maybe this bus you can
[1:34:42] see there's a bus stopped here so it's
[1:34:44] going around the
[1:34:47] bus now there's some people walking on
[1:34:49] the side of the road it looks like we
[1:34:51] got some construction here we got got
[1:34:53] some people on
[1:34:55] bikes no problem for the software it can
[1:34:58] handle it
[1:35:02] all so it looks like we're going to have
[1:35:04] to make a right over here where there's
[1:35:06] a lot of
[1:35:10] construction so let's see how it handles
[1:35:12] this most systems they would be toast
[1:35:17] with this type of construction
[1:35:23] there's no way you know most driver
[1:35:26] assistance cars would even be able to
[1:35:28] attempt something like this but as you
[1:35:31] can see even a complex construction
[1:35:33] environment that's Dynamic there's
[1:35:35] construction workers here bg& workers
[1:35:38] working on the line it's a very narrow
[1:35:41] street it's still able to navigate
[1:35:45] it all right a little bit slow to go
[1:35:49] over there but looks like there's this
[1:35:51] truck trying to park
[1:35:54] okay very good we made it through the
[1:35:56] construction zone it looks
[1:36:15] like it's all very smooth and
[1:36:17] comfortable all right here's another car
[1:36:18] on a narrow road let's see how it
[1:36:21] handles it okay it's creeping
[1:36:24] forward trying to get
[1:36:27] through looks like this car was waiting
[1:36:30] for us as best it
[1:36:32] could no problem pretty much any driving
[1:36:36] scenario it can handle it you'll be
[1:36:39] amazed it's actually trained from Human
[1:36:42] driving so they put millions and
[1:36:44] millions of clips of people driving they
[1:36:47] showed it how real humans handled these
[1:36:50] same driving
[1:36:51] scenarios and the computers actually
[1:36:53] able to learn from that
[1:36:56] footage how to drive in a new scenario
[1:36:59] that it's never encountered
[1:37:03] before next up we've got a left turn
[1:37:05] onto Fair
[1:37:07] Avenue very hilly road here we're going
[1:37:10] uphill you can't really see what's on
[1:37:13] the other side of the Hill which is kind
[1:37:15] of challenging so you can see it's
[1:37:16] slowing a little bit being cautious as
[1:37:19] it Crest the hill
[1:37:26] all right now we're going to be making a
[1:37:28] left onto Fair
[1:37:31] Avenue which is right
[1:37:40] here makes me think of uh Facebook AI
[1:37:47] research praise the Lord so these two
[1:37:50] clips give you a clear indication of
[1:37:52] what
[1:37:54] was
[1:37:55] seen as a major event before the coming
[1:37:59] of Jesus Christ and these
[1:38:02] cars of course in the 30s and 40s that
[1:38:06] didn't even exist anything close to this
[1:38:10] because what these cars are is really
[1:38:12] like a computer on
[1:38:14] Wheels but the last clip and this is the
[1:38:16] final clip that we have I want to is
[1:38:20] that Tesla is bringing up something
[1:38:21] called Robo Taxi
[1:38:24] and I want to go straight into that one
[1:38:26] by a Zam musk has hyped up this robot
[1:38:30] taxi yet again Elon Musk says there will
[1:38:32] be a robo taxi Tesla Robo taxi unveil on
[1:38:37] 88 Elon Musk has done it again this time
[1:38:41] the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has
[1:38:44] announced that his company is developing
[1:38:46] a revolutionary new technology that
[1:38:49] could change the way we think about
[1:38:50] Transportation a fully autonomous tax
[1:38:53] taxi service we achiev democratization
[1:38:55] of AI technology the project which musk
[1:38:58] has dubbed the Tesla Robo taxi would
[1:39:01] allow customers to summon a self-driving
[1:39:03] car that would take them to their
[1:39:05] destination without any human
[1:39:07] intervention but there's more to watch
[1:39:09] out for and we have it all compiled into
[1:39:11] this video let's find out the big
[1:39:14] announcement Elon Musk made the exciting
[1:39:16] announcement that Tesla plans to reveal
[1:39:18] the Tesla Robo taxi on August 8th 2024
[1:39:22] in Austin Texas Elon Musk captured
[1:39:25] widespread attention by revealing plans
[1:39:27] for an exclusive Robo taxi model this
[1:39:30] dedicated vehicle as described by musk
[1:39:33] would embody a markedly futuristic
[1:39:36] aesthetic signaling Tesla's bold leap
[1:39:38] into the next era of autonomous
[1:39:41] transportation we have been able to get
[1:39:42] fresh details regarding the robo taxi
[1:39:45] following Elon musk's response to a
[1:39:47] tweet from Sawyer Meritt Sawyer shared
[1:39:50] that Tesla's upcoming 25k vehicle and
[1:39:53] the robo taxi would share the same
[1:39:55] platform suggesting the robo taxi would
[1:39:58] essentially be the 25k car without a
[1:40:01] steering wheel
[1:40:04] musk that's the part I wanted to get to
[1:40:06] you the car
[1:40:09] without a steering wheel and I want to
[1:40:13] put up two tweets to um we put up the
[1:40:16] clips Elon said Tesla is considering
[1:40:19] model 2 not just having a steering wheel
[1:40:21] and pedals and just roll the dice and
[1:40:23] FSD which is first step driving and the
[1:40:25] next quotation no
[1:40:27] mirrors no
[1:40:29] pedals no steering wheel this is me
[1:40:33] taking
[1:40:34] responsibility for this decision let me
[1:40:37] be clear this vehicle must be designed
[1:40:40] as a clean Robo taxi we going to take
[1:40:42] that risk praise the Lord so that is
[1:40:46] where we are at speaking about this
[1:40:50] fourth Vision that the prophet saw it is
[1:40:53] nearer than we first believe it is right
[1:40:57] here then how late is it when all these
[1:41:01] Visions is just Hitler is already gone
[1:41:05] mus is already gone a lot of things
[1:41:08] already gone but it's just so I BNG this
[1:41:10] up two more things to be fulfilled this
[1:41:12] is by faith Moses listen to this
[1:41:14] carefully picking up the other day an
[1:41:18] old book here reading some of the things
[1:41:20] that the Lord had told and foretold
[1:41:23] already come to pass about this juvenile
[1:41:26] stuff and about the war that would come
[1:41:27] out and all these things as a hit just
[1:41:31] two things left in one of those great
[1:41:35] prophecies that is for
[1:41:39] cars to be on the road with remote
[1:41:43] control looking like an egg only you
[1:41:47] don't drive it it controls
[1:41:51] itself this
[1:41:54] what we are identifying this morning is
[1:41:56] a major event not a minor event this is
[1:42:01] Major for the cars to be reach this spot
[1:42:04] that you see here this is not game now
[1:42:08] and this is going to be released August
[1:42:11] the 8th this year it means that they
[1:42:14] have to have the technology the computer
[1:42:17] power and just recently I think this
[1:42:19] week uh El M said that they're no longer
[1:42:23] computer
[1:42:24] constraint that mean they have tons of
[1:42:26] computer power that taking all the data
[1:42:29] from the 6 million electric cars that
[1:42:31] they have and Computing that data from
[1:42:33] each car all way they drive and
[1:42:35] everything else it's incredible but just
[1:42:38] read this again just two things left in
[1:42:41] one of those great prophecies that is
[1:42:44] for cars to be on the road with remote
[1:42:48] control looking like an egg and only you
[1:42:51] don't have to drive it it controls
[1:42:55] itself and then that's one two and then
[1:43:00] there will be a great woman rise
[1:43:03] up because America is a woman's Nation a
[1:43:07] great woman will rise up and be
[1:43:10] president or something like that in the
[1:43:13] nation and then there will come a total
[1:43:19] Annihilation the entire nation will be
[1:43:22] wiped out
[1:43:25] he said just two things left the car and
[1:43:31] this woman
[1:43:34] Rises let's get the first picture there
[1:43:37] brother
[1:43:40] Nicholas four years ago this
[1:43:45] couple
[1:43:46] um president and vice
[1:43:49] president that woman don't look at her
[1:43:51] smile don't look at her he don't look at
[1:43:53] anything look at what the spirit says
[1:43:56] going to
[1:43:57] be they came into Power President and
[1:43:59] Vice President she broke the glass
[1:44:02] ceiling to become the first woman to be
[1:44:04] vice
[1:44:05] president and another quote the prophet
[1:44:07] said that person might be president or
[1:44:09] vice
[1:44:10] president but why you look at the guy on
[1:44:12] the
[1:44:14] left so she is just a Heartbeat
[1:44:19] Away from becoming president
[1:44:23] how I think about
[1:44:26] that what year we are in we're in
[1:44:30] 2024 ahead of us is August 8th the
[1:44:35] launching of this Robo

[1:44:47] and that will take you to your
[1:44:48] destination without you there is no need
[1:44:50] of pedals there is no need of steering
[1:44:53] wheel and old people already said this
[1:44:55] could the real thing they can't handle
[1:44:57] the road and think this is the real
[1:44:58] thing self this is what we waiting for I
[1:45:01] will take
[1:45:03] it and I not
[1:45:07] old but what they're saying then I want
[1:45:10] you to see the logic behind it where
[1:45:14] they would present the need to have

[1:45:17] safer the ey getting tired feeling tired
[1:45:20] got a tired I whole night last like you
