[1:05:26] Hallelujah.
[1:05:28] Blessed be the name of the Lord. You may
[1:05:32] be seated for a few minutes.
[1:05:36] Are you happy to be in the house of the
[1:05:38] Lord today?
[1:05:40] Amen. There's no place that we'd rather
[1:05:43] be.
[1:05:44] So on behalf of our pastor, we'd like to
[1:05:48] greet one and all on this wonderful day.
[1:05:53] Sort of a break of the routine. If you
[1:05:56] had asked me a month ago if we'd be here
[1:05:59] on a Saturday service like this, I would
[1:06:02] have told you we didn't have one. But
[1:06:05] God in his grace and his mercy already
[1:06:07] saw us here because he there's no
[1:06:09] accident with God. There's no mistake
[1:06:12] with God. There's nothing that surprises
[1:06:14] God. So in the back part of God's mind,
[1:06:17] this service already finished.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; This service you're already shouting and
[1:06:20] worshiping because God already know the
[1:06:22] end from the beginning. And we are happy
[1:06:25] for what God is doing in our midst.
[1:06:28] Amen. and certainly to welcome one and
[1:06:31] all all of the churches that are
[1:06:33] gathered here, the believers. We love
[1:06:35] you. We appreciate you. And we are happy
[1:06:37] that we could be together in fellowship
[1:06:39] by the grace of God. I want to
[1:06:41] acknowledge the ministers who are here
[1:06:44] with us tonight. Uh brother Norris
[1:06:47] Cummings, your app or precious, brother
[1:06:48] Norris. God bless you, brother Norris.
[1:06:50] Certainly wonderful
[1:06:52] to have you with us tonight. Brother
[1:06:55] Yadel, God bless you. Certainly
[1:06:56] wonderful to see you here. Glory. I see
[1:07:01] brother Uwell is here as well. God bless
[1:07:03] you, brother Uwell and your wife is here
[1:07:05] also. God bless you. We happy to have
[1:07:07] you here with us in fellowship. And we
[1:07:09] see brother Roland here as well. God
[1:07:11] bless you and your wife as well. How
[1:07:13] many appreciate the ministers?
[1:07:16] How many appreciate the specials? What
[1:07:19] anointed singing.
[1:07:22] Amen. and to see that the message of the
[1:07:24] hour is very much alive. And uh I don't
[1:07:28] want to take one more minute that is
[1:07:30] necessary to be behind the sacred desk
[1:07:32] tonight because I believe God has
[1:07:35] something special for us. And I had the
[1:07:39] privilege just about two weeks ago to be
[1:07:42] in a convention in Uganda and I had the
[1:07:45] honor to minister along with uh precious
[1:07:48] brother Jonathan Martin. And when as he
[1:07:52] was ministering there in the convention
[1:07:55] um I just knew that we had to have him
[1:07:59] here in Trinidad.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Something just thundered when he was
[1:08:04] ministering and I said this brother
[1:08:05] needs to come to Trinidad. So uh I
[1:08:08] quickly put a phone call in. I say
[1:08:10] brother Oid I've heard something that
[1:08:12] really blessed me and I believe it's
[1:08:13] going to be a blessing and by the grace
[1:08:15] of God he is here with us in Trinidad
[1:08:17] for the very first time in Trinidad. for
[1:08:20] the very first time in the Caribbean.
[1:08:22] So, we want to give him a warm welcome
[1:08:26] to Trinidad and Tobago.
[1:08:32] And it's one thing that he says that is
[1:08:37] something that we connected on. He said,
[1:08:38] "Brother Isaac, I love this message."
[1:08:41] And I believe in Trinidad and Tobago, we
[1:08:43] have sons and daughters of God who love
[1:08:45] this message. This message is what we
[1:08:47] stand on. is the foundation of what we
[1:08:50] believe. We see it as the word of the
[1:08:52] living God for this hour. We know that
[1:08:54] in this message is rapturing faith. In
[1:08:56] this message is the power to change our
[1:08:58] bodies. In this message is food for the
[1:09:01] journey. It has brought us here and it
[1:09:03] will take us to where we need to go. We
[1:09:05] have confidence in the message and in
[1:09:08] the messenger who brought the message.
[1:09:10] The son of man veiled in a son of man.
[1:09:14] So I am privileged and honored to
[1:09:18] welcome to the platform precious brother
[1:09:20] Jonathan Martin from Ohio from True Word
[1:09:24] Tabernacle. I believe him to be a true
[1:09:26] servant of the Lord. And just before he
[1:09:29] comes there's just one quote that I want
[1:09:32] to read from a man running from the
[1:09:34] presence of the Lord and it was a prayer
[1:09:36] and this is my prayer and desire. This
[1:09:38] service is really dedicated to young
[1:09:40] people and brother Martin will be
[1:09:42] preaching uh tonight, tomorrow and
[1:09:44] tomorrow afternoon. But to said to to
[1:09:46] today is really special for the young
[1:09:48] people because we know the young people
[1:09:49] are under attack and a it's a different
[1:09:52] kind of attack.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; The enemy is doing everything he can do
[1:09:56] subtly, covertly, publicly this way to
[1:10:00] break faith, break confidence, break
[1:10:03] love. The wax for the love of many have
[1:10:06] just waxed cold. People are going
[1:10:08] through the motions and deep down
[1:10:10] there's still a thirst. There's still a
[1:10:12] desire for more.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; And I believe that we are among
[1:10:15] believers here and those who are
[1:10:16] connected online who are looking for
[1:10:18] more. Looking for a reality. As a
[1:10:21] preacher, I say I'm tired of church. I
[1:10:23] want a reality. I want the God of the
[1:10:26] Bible. I want the living present tense
[1:10:28] move of the spirit of heal what they
[1:10:30] felt to know that you know that nothing
[1:10:32] could move you. to him that overcometh
[1:10:34] will I will I will I make the stand firm
[1:10:36] in the temple of God and he shall go no
[1:10:38] more out that's the kind of faith we
[1:10:40] need because talk is not going to do
[1:10:42] it'll take the reality of the living God
[1:10:44] to anchor in your soul and do something
[1:10:46] for you so I just have one quote before
[1:10:49] he comes and it's from the message of
[1:10:51] man running from the presence of the
[1:10:52] Lord and may we have such a great
[1:10:55] meeting till there not be an unsaved
[1:10:58] person among us all the children will be
[1:11:00] in the kingdom of God those without the
[1:11:03] baptism of the spirit, may they receive
[1:11:05] it, Father. May all the great mysteries
[1:11:08] that we are supposed to know at this
[1:11:10] age, Lord, be unveiled to us and we'll
[1:11:13] see the plainness of God so that we'll
[1:11:15] know how to behave ourselves and act
[1:11:18] correcting ourselves and bringing the
[1:11:21] members of our body into discipline to
[1:11:23] the word that we might know how to live
[1:11:26] in this present day at the approaching
[1:11:28] of the Lord Jesus. And that prayer from
[1:11:30] the prophet is my prayer today as well.
[1:11:33] And I'm under expectation for God to
[1:11:35] speak to us. It's not a man speaking,
[1:11:37] but God has men in this hour. And we are
[1:11:40] under great expectation. So as he come,
[1:11:42] let's stand to our feet one more time.
[1:11:43] And as we sing this song in your prayer,
[1:11:48] sons,
[1:11:51] that's where I'm from. In your prayer,
[1:11:57] peasants.
[1:11:59] Oh Lord my God come. Oh, in your
[1:12:03] presence, brother John
[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:16] touching your grace
[1:12:19] [Music]
[1:12:21] in the cliff of the cross.
[1:12:29] In your presence,
[1:12:33] oh Lord. Sing it again. in your
[1:12:36] presence.
[1:12:41] That's where I
[1:12:42] [Music]
[1:12:45] [Applause]
[1:12:48] Oh Lord my God, in your presence
[1:12:57] that's where I
[1:13:01] seeking your face.
[1:13:05] touching your grave
[1:13:08] [Music]
[1:13:10] in the cliff of the rock
[1:13:18] in your presence.
[1:13:22] Oh Lord,
[1:13:26] [Music]
[1:13:28] we're so appreciative of his presence.
[1:13:32] So glad that God has been manifest among
[1:13:35] us in this age.
[1:13:38] We serve a living resurrected savior.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; And the very answer that we need is
[1:13:44] found in the message of this hour.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; God has not left us alone
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; because he's promised that that he's a
[1:13:53] very present help in the time of need.
[1:13:56] And we have found him faithful
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; through every storm, through every
[1:14:00] obstacle, through through many great
[1:14:03] valleys and mountains that we've climbed
[1:14:06] and obstacles, everything. We have found
[1:14:09] that God is faithful
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; and he's faithful to his word.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; He's faithful to his oath.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; And I believe that we're the seed of
[1:14:17] Abraham by the Holy Ghost. We are his
[1:14:20] royal seed.
[1:14:22] And the same vow, the same oath that he
[1:14:25] gave Abraham applies to his spiritual
[1:14:28] seed. And I believe that he's an
[1:14:31] unchangeable God. I believe his promises
[1:14:34] are true.
[1:14:36] I believe that God is here to make
[1:14:39] manifest every word, every promise, and
[1:14:42] bring a reality.
[1:14:44] And uh we just want to say that we uh
[1:14:48] just uh appreciate the invite and uh
[1:14:52] it's true. We've never been to this uh
[1:14:54] this part of the world before and uh you
[1:14:58] know there's one thing that I have
[1:15:00] found. It's hot.
[1:15:02] Uh it it is hot and uh and uh but you
[1:15:07] know uh we're just glad to be able to
[1:15:10] fellowship with God's people
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; and uh I'm looking forward to uh
[1:15:16] spending eternity uh with God's children
[1:15:19] and uh I believe that this message is
[1:15:22] going to get us there. I I believe that
[1:15:25] God has given us the power that that we
[1:15:27] need and all we've got to do is just
[1:15:29] keep watering it and watering it with
[1:15:32] our faith, watering it with our praises.
[1:15:35] And uh you know, I I just uh appreciate
[1:15:39] the the invite and the opportunity to
[1:15:42] minister what I believe is the greatest
[1:15:44] message that has ever come upon this
[1:15:47] earth. And uh as our brother Isaac said,
[1:15:51] it is it is rapturing faith. And uh God
[1:15:55] has given us a faith to believe in his
[1:15:57] rapturing grace because it's not by our
[1:16:00] might and it's not by our power but it's
[1:16:02] by his spirit. It's by his grace upon
[1:16:06] our lives. And uh so I just want to uh
[1:16:10] just say God richly bless you. God bless
[1:16:13] brother oid. And uh we just uh
[1:16:16] appreciate the invite. And uh if you
[1:16:19] have your Bibles
[1:16:22] uh we'll turn to Luke the 18th chapter.
[1:16:27] We'll begin reading from verse one.
[1:16:33] And uh
[1:16:37] the Lord got a hold of my life when I
[1:16:40] was just a young boy.
[1:16:43] and it just begin to uh show me what
[1:16:47] this message was about when I was just a
[1:16:50] youth. And uh you know, I I had a lot of
[1:16:54] zeal back then. I can honestly say that
[1:16:57] I'm I'm still zealous about this message
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; and uh I I I have dedicated my life to
[1:17:05] it. I believe that every Christian has
[1:17:07] dedicated their life to this message.
[1:17:10] And uh if you haven't uh then I will
[1:17:13] just say this, the message is Christ
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; and and he is the man that we are
[1:17:19] following
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; and he is leading us to our body change
[1:17:23] and but you've got to have a personal
[1:17:26] experience with Christ.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; You've got to know him and the power of
[1:17:30] his resurrection. your life has got to
[1:17:33] be changed and transformed and and uh we
[1:17:36] believe we just pray that that is
[1:17:38] exactly what can take place. If you've
[1:17:40] not had that real personal experience
[1:17:42] with him then by this service uh the the
[1:17:46] end of this service you can have your
[1:17:48] own experience with him and uh because
[1:17:51] God is a reality. So, Luke the 18th
[1:17:55] chapter beginning at verse one. And he
[1:17:59] spake a parable unto them at uh unto
[1:18:03] them to this end that men ought always
[1:18:06] to pray and not to faint, saying, There
[1:18:11] was in a city a judge, which feared not
[1:18:14] God, neither regarded man. And there was
[1:18:18] a widow in that city, and she came unto
[1:18:22] him, saying, "Avenge me of mine
[1:18:25] adversary." And he would not for a
[1:18:28] while. But afterward he said within
[1:18:32] himself, "Though I fear not God, nor
[1:18:35] regard man, yet because this widow
[1:18:39] troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by
[1:18:44] her continual coming she weary me." And
[1:18:47] the Lord said, uh, hear what the unjust
[1:18:51] judge saith, and shall not God avenge
[1:18:55] his own elect, which cry day and night
[1:18:59] unto him, though he bear long with them?
[1:19:03] I tell you that he will avenge them
[1:19:05] speedily.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, when the Son of man
[1:19:09] cometh, shall he find faith on the
[1:19:12] earth. Now, Hebrews the 6th chapter and
[1:19:16] verse 12,
[1:19:19] that ye be not slothful, but followers
[1:19:23] of them who through faith and patience
[1:19:27] inherit the promises. Don't be slothful,
[1:19:31] but followers of them who through faith
[1:19:35] and patience inherit the promises. I
[1:19:39] would like to just take for a text. Will
[1:19:42] I find faith? Now, may God add his
[1:19:45] blessings to the reading of the word,
[1:19:48] you can have your seats. It's a very
[1:19:51] simple subject and yet it's a very uh
[1:19:55] powerful subject and a very powerful
[1:19:58] revelation and that is faith. And I I
[1:20:03] would like to just speak on it. It may
[1:20:05] be very simple to us, but I believe that
[1:20:08] God hides himself in simplicity and he
[1:20:12] and he reveals himself in the same. And
[1:20:15] I believe that God has given a special
[1:20:18] grace upon this age. I I as we're
[1:20:22] speaking uh specifically to young people
[1:20:25] tonight, uh God has given us a a real
[1:20:29] special grace to this generation. I I
[1:20:33] believe that we're living in an hour
[1:20:36] that God already knew what would take
[1:20:39] place upon the earth. He He knew he
[1:20:41] already prophesied, foretold that there
[1:20:44] would be gross darkness and much
[1:20:47] deception and and this lid of hell would
[1:20:50] be lifted uh off off in this age. But at
[1:20:54] the same time uh all of heaven would
[1:20:57] come down. So as all of hell is coming
[1:21:02] and pouring out upon the earth and we
[1:21:04] see that uh the the fourth dimension,
[1:21:08] the the the fifth dimension, hell has
[1:21:11] come through the the fourth dimension
[1:21:14] and has even come into our very
[1:21:16] dimensions that we live in uh space,
[1:21:20] time and matter. And we see the demonic
[1:21:23] forces of hell and the war that is
[1:21:26] raging all around us. But at the same
[1:21:29] time, the prophet would let us know that
[1:21:32] deity is not in heaven. Deity is upon
[1:21:36] the earth. And and then very
[1:21:39] specifically, he would say that deity is
[1:21:42] in you because you are the tabernacle,
[1:21:46] the the dwelling place, the temple of
[1:21:49] almighty God. And so there has been a
[1:21:53] special grace that has re moved upon the
[1:21:57] elect in this hour because this is an
[1:22:01] age that we must be stabilized.
[1:22:04] This is an age that all of the mysteries
[1:22:08] that that has been probed at through
[1:22:12] throughout the ages has now become a
[1:22:16] revelation unto us. Things that were
[1:22:19] unknown are now made known. And it's for
[1:22:23] one specific purpose, and that is to
[1:22:26] give a rapturing faith to to to to give
[1:22:30] us something to stabilize us to to put
[1:22:33] our feet upon a solid rock. And when the
[1:22:37] winds come and the storms begin to blow
[1:22:40] and and crash against amen against our
[1:22:44] lives, we're we're we're not just moving
[1:22:47] about with shifting sands, but we're
[1:22:50] stabilized. Amen. a generation that is
[1:22:54] not getting weaker and weaker with the
[1:22:57] knowledge that is being released upon
[1:23:00] this age. But this is a generation that
[1:23:03] knows God and and and and has an
[1:23:06] understanding of God and the power of
[1:23:09] God to to to stand there and withstand
[1:23:13] the evil forces of this age. Amen. I I
[1:23:17] believe that I'm speaking to a chosen
[1:23:21] generation.
[1:23:23] Amen. A royal priesthood.
[1:23:26] that that God has placed a call and
[1:23:30] ability within us to not just go into
[1:23:34] the outer courts and not just say,
[1:23:37] "Well, the sun is shining and thank God
[1:23:39] for the sh sun," but then the night
[1:23:42] begins to fall and and then we get
[1:23:44] discouraged and fearful and wondering
[1:23:47] and disillusioned and and it's even
[1:23:50] greater than just going into the holy
[1:23:52] place where where there is man-made
[1:23:56] light and seven candles and and the
[1:23:59] priest has got to keep the oil and got
[1:24:01] to keep the the light burning and and
[1:24:04] then we know that in the holy place it
[1:24:06] can still get smoked up. And but you see
[1:24:09] there's a greater calling than that
[1:24:12] there is beyond the veil into the
[1:24:16] holiest of holies where the shakina
[1:24:19] light of God. Amen. where there is
[1:24:22] mercy, there's blood upon the mercy
[1:24:25] seat, and there is grace and the favor
[1:24:28] of God. And and we find that's where
[1:24:31] life is. That's where fruit is. That's
[1:24:35] where you young people, your life for
[1:24:38] the glory of God. I tell you, there is a
[1:24:41] grace. There's a call. It's a holy
[1:24:44] calling. Amen. To go beyond just
[1:24:47] man-made religion. go beyond the
[1:24:50] traditions, go beyond just man-made
[1:24:53] leadership and go into the presence of
[1:24:56] almighty God. And I believe that this
[1:24:59] message is what prepared the way. It's
[1:25:03] dissolved all unbelief. It's taken the
[1:25:07] doom and the gloom out of our lives that
[1:25:10] we can come boldly into beyond the veil.
[1:25:15] not timid, not cowardly, not beggars,
[1:25:19] uh, but a generation that God has put a
[1:25:24] courage within your heart to come into
[1:25:27] divine presence and blossom. It's not
[1:25:31] just for the preacher. It's not just for
[1:25:34] the prophet, but it's for a chosen
[1:25:37] people, a called out people that God has
[1:25:42] called for his name's sake. Go beyond
[1:25:45] the creed. Go beyond the delusions. Go
[1:25:48] beyond just man-made ideas and go and
[1:25:53] find God for yourself. Find God in the
[1:25:56] power of his resurrection. And let and
[1:26:00] when you meet that God, he's going to
[1:26:02] give you a faith, a faith to be an
[1:26:06] overcomer, a faith to cast down every
[1:26:10] weapon that would come against you. Cast
[1:26:14] down imagination,
[1:26:15] cast down reasoning,
[1:26:18] cast down your senses, amen, that are
[1:26:22] always warning against you. You see,
[1:26:24] when the enemy comes in like a flood,
[1:26:27] the spirit of the Lord will raise a
[1:26:29] standard against him. You see, there's
[1:26:33] always a special anointing for the time
[1:26:36] and for the season to combat the
[1:26:39] Antichrist spirits and the teachings and
[1:26:42] the doctrines that are trying to trying
[1:26:46] to weaken your faith and and get you off
[1:26:49] of the path and get you away from the
[1:26:52] direction. Amen. You see, it's a Holy
[1:26:54] Ghost power to defeat that Antichrist
[1:26:58] spirit. Amen. You see the Holy Ghost,
[1:27:02] Amen, is what makes this word live
[1:27:05] because the word and the Holy Ghost are
[1:27:08] the same thing. Amen. So the Holy Ghost
[1:27:11] is what brings a power of revelation
[1:27:15] that'll defeat the devil in your life.
[1:27:19] It'll cast down discouragement. It'll
[1:27:21] cast down reasoning. It'll cast down
[1:27:25] disillusionment.
[1:27:26] It's an anointing, a man, that comes
[1:27:29] upon the elect. You see, down through
[1:27:32] the ages, there's been a a lion
[1:27:35] anointing and an ox anointing and a man
[1:27:38] anointing. But you see, the anointing
[1:27:41] that has been released for this day,
[1:27:44] it's a flying eagle. Amen. It's a
[1:27:47] prophetic anointing. You see, it's the
[1:27:50] it's the anointing to restore the
[1:27:54] children back to the original faith
[1:27:57] again of the fathers. It's an eagle age.
[1:28:01] You see, the other anointings were
[1:28:03] earthbound creatures, but this is a
[1:28:06] heavenly bird. This is a flying eagle.
[1:28:10] It's not just perch somewhere. It's
[1:28:12] flying. There's an anointing that has
[1:28:15] been released upon this generation.
[1:28:18] Amen. To put you into fight, to place
[1:28:21] you positionally in heavenly places.
[1:28:25] That's what the message came to you to
[1:28:27] do. To get you out of these earthbound
[1:28:29] atmospheres and to place you into the
[1:28:32] heavenlies that you could put your faith
[1:28:34] into action and call those things that
[1:28:37] be not as though they already are.
[1:28:42] I'm not talk
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about just mamas and and
[1:28:47] daddies and thank you. Amen. And the
[1:28:49] preachers. Amen. I'm talking about young
[1:28:52] people catching the vision. A fresh
[1:28:55] vision. It's not just 60 years ago.
[1:28:59] Amen. It's not just 20 years ago. But
[1:29:02] what are you going to do with this
[1:29:04] vision? Without the vision, the people
[1:29:06] perish. So God, send an eagle anointing
[1:29:10] to give you a word in season. Uh, amen.
[1:29:13] To get you into heavenly places, uh,
[1:29:16] that you can begin to soar.
[1:29:19] Soar in this rapturing faith, soar in
[1:29:23] this grace that says you never did it in
[1:29:25] the first place. Uh, you're the
[1:29:27] redeemed, the bloodbought, predestinated
[1:29:31] before the foundation of the world. to
[1:29:34] give you a faith to accept who you are,
[1:29:37] to accept the grace that's been released
[1:29:39] upon you, to know that you're sons and
[1:29:42] daughters of God. And you are not made
[1:29:44] for tribulation. You are made for the
[1:29:47] marriage supper of the lamb. You are
[1:29:49] made for the millennium.
[1:29:56] You see, it's an eagle age.
[1:29:59] Amen. And it's Revelations 10 1:7
[1:30:03] where all the mysteries of God would be
[1:30:06] revealed. It's the eagle. You see, don't
[1:30:09] forget this church. I'm quoting the
[1:30:11] prophet in the fifth seal. Don't forget
[1:30:13] this church. I just want to remind you,
[1:30:16] don't forget this church.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; And you brethren on tape, I want you to
[1:30:22] examine this. How could men do anything
[1:30:25] else besides the power of God that had
[1:30:28] been released to them?
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Well, if it was true at the opening of
[1:30:32] the seals is the true right now. Amen.
[1:30:36] There is a power, an anointing upon our
[1:30:40] lives that is making us act a certain
[1:30:43] way.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; It's making us believe a certain way.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; It's making us to walk in a certain
[1:30:51] direction. I'm tired of the wilderness.
[1:30:54] I'm tired of someone saying, "Go this
[1:30:57] direction and and go that direction and
[1:30:59] you don't know who to believe." Uh, but
[1:31:02] God sent a prophet to point us in the
[1:31:05] right direction and say, "This is how
[1:31:07] you get out of this wilderness. This is
[1:31:10] how you get out of man-made
[1:31:11] denominations. This is how you get out
[1:31:14] of those denominational spirits of cold,
[1:31:17] lukewarm, dead religion. This is how you
[1:31:20] inherit the promises.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what you're
[1:31:26] called to do. Inherit the promises.
[1:31:32] When inheritance is given to you, you
[1:31:33] don't have to beg for it.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; You don't have to gravel for it. It's
[1:31:39] yours by grace.
[1:31:41] It's inheritance.
[1:31:43] And as the royal seed of Abraham, we are
[1:31:46] possessors of all things. all things.
[1:31:51] And the idea that we've got to beg for
[1:31:53] it, the idea that we've got to we've got
[1:31:56] to crawl on our knees and and try to
[1:31:58] find some favor with God, that's the old
[1:32:01] order. This is a new order. It's the
[1:32:04] order of Melzdc. It's the order of the
[1:32:07] word himself. It's a ministry that is
[1:32:10] sprinkled blood upon your life, saying
[1:32:13] you never did it. You never sin in the
[1:32:16] first place. All you've got to do is
[1:32:19] accept it by grace. Believe the promise.
[1:32:23] Accept who you are. Accept the Holy
[1:32:26] Ghost. Accept your healing. Accept your
[1:32:29] deliverance.
[1:32:33] Hallelujah.
[1:32:36] You see, all the scriptures have been
[1:32:37] proved,
[1:32:39] vindicated.
[1:32:41] The presence of the Lord so made
[1:32:44] manifest in this hour. And it's for one
[1:32:47] purpose. To anoint our faith
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; to let us know that God is here.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Every sign, every vindication,
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; every proof,
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; whether it's in the heavens, whether
[1:33:02] it's on the earth, whether it's through
[1:33:04] a gift, whatever it is, God is trying to
[1:33:07] prove to you that there is a faith
[1:33:10] that's being released in this age.
[1:33:13] He's wanting to get to you that the pro
[1:33:15] that the time, the fulfillment of all
[1:33:18] things is now.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; You see, Jesus never asked, "Will I find
[1:33:26] a good person?"
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; You listen to me, young people.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; He never asked, "Will I find someone
[1:33:33] that's righteous?"
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; He never asked if he would find a good
[1:33:37] Christian. He never asked if he would
[1:33:40] find saints or respects or or or a good
[1:33:44] tithe payer. Amen. And I'm just going to
[1:33:47] inject this for myself. Amen. He never
[1:33:50] asked, "Will will I find someone that
[1:33:52] believes that God sent a prophet?"
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Being a good person is good. Being a
[1:33:59] righteous is a must. Being a good
[1:34:01] Christian is a must. Amen. All of these
[1:34:05] things and and believing God sent a
[1:34:07] profit. It's a must for this age. But
[1:34:09] what God is looking for is a faith
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; to accept his finished work at Calvary.
[1:34:18] And when you accept that, it makes you
[1:34:21] righteous. It makes you holy. It makes
[1:34:24] you blameless. It gives you Holy Ghost
[1:34:26] courage.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Will I find faith?
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Will I find someone that can take me at
[1:34:36] my word?
[1:34:38] Well, I should find somebody who will
[1:34:40] stand at my word and say every word's
[1:34:43] right.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not scared whether this one says so
[1:34:46] or that says so or nothing. I believe in
[1:34:49] God and I'm accepting it and standing
[1:34:52] right there on it. That's what he's
[1:34:55] looking for.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Someone that'll take their stand upon
[1:35:00] thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:35:04] You see, Satan is after our faith.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; That's what he was after in the garden.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Satan has every trick
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; to discourage the bride of Christ.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; He's got every scarecrow around this
[1:35:19] message.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; He's got enticing spirits to distract
[1:35:23] from the real.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Enticing spirits. You got to do
[1:35:28] this and you got to do this and if you
[1:35:30] don't do this, Amen. then then you're
[1:35:33] not a Christian. You're not going to
[1:35:34] make the rapture. Amen. Enticing
[1:35:37] spirits. Amen. Centered around the
[1:35:40] message that if you don't do a certain
[1:35:42] thing, then it brings a discouragement.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; You see, it's enticing spirits just to
[1:35:48] keep you in the wilderness.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Get you so locked up in fear,
[1:35:55] doubt,
[1:35:56] spooks.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; You see, he's trying to paralyze your
[1:36:00] faith.
[1:36:02] Amen. Got faith but you it's paralyzed.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; And that is an example of Lot.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; He got paralyzed by Sodom.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew it was wrong
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; but but his faith become paralyzed
[1:36:17] because he sympathized with it.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Let me just say something young people.
[1:36:21] Don't sympathize with Leosa.
[1:36:24] Don't sympathize with cold, lukewarm,
[1:36:27] neodyia, blind, miserable, wretched
[1:36:30] spirits. Don't sympathize. Amen. With
[1:36:35] this direction, that direction. Stay
[1:36:37] with this message. Believe this message.
[1:36:41] It's Christ. It's the man Christ Jesus.
[1:36:44] He's the one who died and paid for your
[1:36:47] sins. He He died to take away your high
[1:36:50] breeding. Stay with Christ.
[1:36:54] It's Christ that is asking, "Will I find
[1:36:57] faith?" It's Christ that has been made
[1:37:00] manifest in the revealing of the son of
[1:37:02] man, saying, "Just believe me. Just
[1:37:05] accept who I am. Just accept my
[1:37:08] unchanging, vindicated
[1:37:10] revelation of who I am."
[1:37:14] [Applause]
[1:37:19] You see, when a man
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; once catches that vision of the
[1:37:22] invisible God
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; and know that he's always present.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's something about that. He's
[1:37:30] always present.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Young people, if you can just catch the
[1:37:34] vision of the invisible God. You say,
[1:37:38] "Well, h how do I catch the image of the
[1:37:41] invisible God?" When you've seen his
[1:37:43] word made manifest, that is his presence
[1:37:48] being made known.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; And we have seen God vindicate his
[1:37:52] presence. We have seen this word become
[1:37:56] so material and manifest. Amen. We've
[1:38:00] seen the lame walk. We've seen the
[1:38:02] cancers healed. We've seen the blind
[1:38:05] see. We have seen drug addicts made
[1:38:08] whole. We have seen lukewarm Christians
[1:38:11] on fire. We have seen the manifestation
[1:38:14] of God's working among us, declaring his
[1:38:17] presence is here.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; And when a man catches that vision of
[1:38:23] the invisible God and know that he's
[1:38:25] always presence, there is something that
[1:38:28] stabilizes that man's thinking.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; It stabilizes his actions.
[1:38:34] And in the time of distress and trouble,
[1:38:37] it'll still make him look up upward and
[1:38:40] above the things that are happening
[1:38:41] around him because he's looking at the
[1:38:44] unseen yet by promise.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; You see, amen. Moses caught a vision of
[1:38:53] Christ and he forsook the world. Lot
[1:38:57] seen the world and it paralyzed his
[1:39:00] faith. But Moses caught a vision of
[1:39:03] Christ and he forsook the world and it
[1:39:06] anointed his faith and it put him into
[1:39:08] action
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; and his faith paralyzed the world.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; And either your faith will paralyze
[1:39:18] glamour or either the glamour will
[1:39:20] paralyze your faith.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; You can't have it both ways.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; It's going to be one or the other.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; You've got to make your choice.
[1:39:30] Now, I I'm just going to say it like the
[1:39:32] prophet of God said it. Amen. That God
[1:39:35] has already made his choice.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; But it's your time to make your choice.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see that deep calling unto the
[1:39:43] deep, that thirst that is within your
[1:39:46] soul, and you're longing for reality,
[1:39:49] you're thirsting for a living God. I
[1:39:51] tell you what it is. It's God that has
[1:39:54] already fornew you. And he already knew
[1:39:58] that you were predestinated to life. So
[1:40:00] he's knocking on your heart's door. And
[1:40:03] he's saying, "Whosoever would open their
[1:40:05] heart, I will come in and I will shut
[1:40:07] with them and I'll break the bread of
[1:40:09] life." I tell you friends, you can run.
[1:40:12] You can try to hide. You can try to
[1:40:15] drown out that voice. But there is
[1:40:17] something about God. He knew you before
[1:40:20] the foundation of the world. And he
[1:40:22] chose you into Christ. And he's never
[1:40:25] going to give up on you. He's never
[1:40:27] going to let you go.
[1:40:30] I'm thankful for that kind of a grace. A
[1:40:33] grace that is a keeping. A grace that
[1:40:36] you can go so far in sin and stooped in
[1:40:39] sin and yet the hand of God will reach
[1:40:41] down there and he'll pick you up and
[1:40:43] he'll bring you out of the miry clay and
[1:40:45] set you up on a rock.
[1:40:49] This is not like any other age. This is
[1:40:52] a grace where he has swore by himself
[1:40:54] that he'll not lose one.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; He'll not lose one. And I tell you young
[1:41:00] people, he's not going to lose you. He's
[1:41:03] going to keep you, preserve you. He's
[1:41:05] going to fill you. He's going to rapture
[1:41:08] you.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; But you got to catch the vision. You got
[1:41:14] to see it for yourself. Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; You see, Hebrews the 11th chapter
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; verses 1 and 2 says, "Now faith is the
[1:41:27] substance
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; of things hoped for."
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; The evidence of things not seen.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; For by it the elders obtained a good
[1:41:35] report,
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; and by this faith the worlds were
[1:41:40] framed.
[1:41:43] You see,
[1:41:45] Isaiah would ask a very good question.
[1:41:50] To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; And who will believe the report?
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Who will believe the report?
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; And to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:42:03] revealed?
[1:42:05] And you see the prophet of God in the
[1:42:07] opening of the seals would say if you
[1:42:09] believe the word, the arm, the strength
[1:42:14] of the Lord will be revealed.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Believe the report
[1:42:20] and the power of God will be released to
[1:42:24] your life to make manifest what he
[1:42:27] promised.
[1:42:31] So the importance of your faith and
[1:42:34] accepting what God has done for you in
[1:42:36] this hour, believe it
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; and it'll release an anointing upon your
[1:42:41] life.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Now that's what the elders,
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; you see, it's saying for by it the
[1:42:51] elders obtained a good report. But you
[1:42:53] see, there was a group of elders that
[1:42:56] refused to go on into the land,
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; and they produced scarecrows.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; They produced a whole bunch of lukewarm
[1:43:03] spirits.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; They produced a whole bunch of question
[1:43:06] marks on the message.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; You see, and the people got their eyes
[1:43:12] off of a vindicated word that said,
[1:43:14] "It's your land."
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Got their eyes off of the evidence. It's
[1:43:19] a good land. You see, the prophet of God
[1:43:21] says we're living off of the evidence
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; of that other world.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; It's the son of man.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; The word made manifest is the evidence
[1:43:32] of what is in the unseen realm.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Healing is yours. Deliverance is yours.
[1:43:39] Joy is yours.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; And the word made manifest has declared
[1:43:45] what is in the unseen realm. But you
[1:43:47] accept it by faith.
[1:43:53] You see, they
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; they they they talked two million people
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; into staying in the wilderness.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; But there come another group of elders.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; There come another generation.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; There come a Joshua generation. There
[1:44:12] come a a believer that that was
[1:44:14] identified with that Joshua anointing
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; that said, "I'm more than able to
[1:44:19] possess that land."
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; And they begin to tell that generation
[1:44:23] that was coming up.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; It's for you.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; They begin to go to that five and
[1:44:34] sixyear-old, that sevenyear-old, and
[1:44:36] say, "Honey, it's for you.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; This word is for you. This message came
[1:44:42] for you.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; You're a chosen daughter. You're a
[1:44:46] chosen son. Begin to take that
[1:44:48] 10year-old and say, "Honey, you got to
[1:44:50] realize who you are. You're a
[1:44:52] predestinated son. God loves you with an
[1:44:55] everlasting love. He's never going to
[1:44:57] lose you. He's ne he's going to always
[1:44:59] watch over you. Begin to take growing
[1:45:02] them up, raising them up in the fear of
[1:45:06] the Lord." And the beginning of wisdom
[1:45:08] is the fear of the Lord. to fear the
[1:45:10] word, to fear the report, to fear what
[1:45:15] God has given us in this age and say,
[1:45:17] "Oh God, I don't want to be contrary to
[1:45:19] this word. I don't want to sidestep this
[1:45:22] revelation, but I want to believe it. I
[1:45:25] want to come under it. I want to say,
[1:45:27] "Yes, it's my property. Yes, it's my
[1:45:30] possession. Yes, it's my inheritance."
[1:45:35] I say, "You've been hearing it. You've
[1:45:38] been hearing it. You've been hearing it,
[1:45:40] but now it's time to possess it.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Now it's time to put your faith in
[1:45:45] action.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Now it's time to quit looking at mama.
[1:45:50] Quit looking at daddy. Quit looking at
[1:45:52] the preachers and realize that you're a
[1:45:54] chosen generation.
[1:45:56] That you're the Joshua generation.
[1:45:59] That you have been called to go into the
[1:46:01] holies of holies and entertain the
[1:46:03] presence of Almighty God and go in there
[1:46:05] as a possessor, a conqueror.
[1:46:13] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; You see, all things are possible if you
[1:46:18] believe.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; And without faith,
[1:46:23] it is impossible to please God.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; With faith, all things are possible.
[1:46:28] Without faith, it is impossible to
[1:46:31] please God. So Enoch, your type,
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; had a testimony
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; that he pleased God
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; because he possessed the land.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; He walked it out. He walked with God
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; from justification, sanctification, the
[1:46:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And then he
[1:46:51] began to get caught up,
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; the quickening power,
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; becoming so real in his heart and his
[1:47:00] life. And he's just walking with God.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; He just wakes up on Monday walking with
[1:47:05] God. He wakes up on Tuesday walking with
[1:47:08] God. He wakes up on Wednesday walking
[1:47:10] with God. But all of a sudden, there was
[1:47:13] something, a gravitation, a pull that
[1:47:16] was catching him. Come up higher. Come
[1:47:19] up high. There's an open door. Come up
[1:47:22] higher.
[1:47:26] And El just another day. Just another
[1:47:31] time going to work. Just another time
[1:47:33] coming to church. just another time
[1:47:36] going through another trial, another
[1:47:38] situation, another valley, another
[1:47:41] mountain you're trying to climb, just
[1:47:43] another day. But all the sudden,
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Enoch was not for God took him
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; because all things are possible if you
[1:47:59] believe it.
[1:48:03] And that's the testimony that a that
[1:48:05] Enoch left us
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; that he pleased God.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; He was in such harmony with word the
[1:48:11] word of God.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; That he knew how to walk.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; He knew what pleased God.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; And that was just simply Lord I believe
[1:48:20] you.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Lord I believe your word.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Coming in line, coming in contact,
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; getting in direct contact with that word
[1:48:29] and saying
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; that's me. Amen.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; That's my promise.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; That's my inheritance.
[1:48:37] [Music]
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; You see, it's faith
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; that unlocks the promises of God to us.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; And God has to have believers.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; He can't work through make believers.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; He can't just work through some random
[1:48:52] person.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; He's got to have believers. Yeah.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; So, in order to have believers to meet
[1:48:59] the challenge of the age, he had to
[1:49:01] predestinate believers.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; You see, I I I I know the devil's been
[1:49:06] trying to tell you that that that you're
[1:49:08] just going to fall away. And
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; don't even know it's if it's for you.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; But I just want to say what a prophet
[1:49:16] said about you.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; He predestinated believers.
[1:49:19] [Applause]
[1:49:21] You see, when he predestinated in
[1:49:23] Malachi 4, it's got to happen.
[1:49:27] [Applause]
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; You see, when Jesus was saying, when the
[1:49:34] son of man comes, will he find faith?
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 had already been written.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus was not looking at that, you know,
[1:49:46] in ignorance and, well, I really don't
[1:49:49] know. Oh, I don't know if there's going
[1:49:50] to be an elect. I don't I don't know if
[1:49:51] anyone can believe the age is going to
[1:49:53] be so dark and
[1:49:56] but he already looked back to the
[1:49:58] scripture and he knew that Malachi 4:5
[1:50:02] and 6 was for that last generation when
[1:50:06] he was saying, "Will I find that kind of
[1:50:08] a faith?" He knew it was already
[1:50:11] predestinated that there would be an
[1:50:14] elect with a special grace upon your
[1:50:16] life to believe the word.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; But you see,
[1:50:28] let me just put it like this. You are
[1:50:30] sealed up.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; You are still a part of the mystery.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Your name was still sealed up.
[1:50:40] But it was at the time that the son of
[1:50:43] man is going to be revealed
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; that the lamb steps forth that he had
[1:50:47] been in the eternities. John didn't even
[1:50:49] see but he stepped from the eternities.
[1:50:51] He had been interceding upon the
[1:50:53] ignorance of the people through seven
[1:50:54] church ages. But now the day of
[1:50:57] ignorance is over
[1:50:59] because the lamb is coming to take the
[1:51:01] book.
[1:51:03] The people that the devil has been
[1:51:05] beating up and telling you. See, you
[1:51:07] can't believe it's not for you. You can
[1:51:09] just fall away. Now, the revelation is
[1:51:12] being made long.
[1:51:15] Now, he's being bringing you out of the
[1:51:17] ignorance.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; And he's bringing you to an
[1:51:21] understanding,
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; a revelation of who you are. That when
[1:51:27] the lamb takes the book, the word is now
[1:51:30] revealed and your name is a part of the
[1:51:33] revelation. And it begins to speak that
[1:51:36] you are an overcomer. You are my bride.
[1:51:39] You are the one that I've chosen to
[1:51:42] defeat Satan in his old Eden.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; The age of ignorance is over.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Because the word has been revealed.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; So he predestinated
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; in Malachi 4. It's got to happen. Amen.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; When he come over and predestinates
[1:52:08] anything to happen in his word, he had
[1:52:10] to prove his word to be so.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; When he predestinates anything to happen
[1:52:15] and says it will happen, he knows that
[1:52:18] seed will be there just at that time. He
[1:52:21] predestinated a bride. She's going to be
[1:52:23] there. Going to be a rapture. She's
[1:52:25] going to be there. He predestinates it
[1:52:27] by his fornowledge. There's nothing
[1:52:30] going to stop it.
[1:52:35] The religious, the Pharisees, the
[1:52:38] Sadducees, they they tried to stop him
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; because he come as the God prophet.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; He come as the revealing of the son of
[1:52:46] man in his first coming.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Son of man is a prophet.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; And so he's coming and he's and he's
[1:52:53] taking the word and he's saying, "This
[1:52:55] day, this scripture is fulfilled." Do
[1:52:58] they love him for it? No. They tried to
[1:53:01] throw him over a heel.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; They wanted him out of their churches.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what is repeated in this
[1:53:08] last day. The son of man has come, the
[1:53:10] word, and they've hated the word.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; And Christ has been kicked out of the
[1:53:15] churches because they don't want that
[1:53:18] kind of a presence in their midst.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; You see, but then he said, I have needs
[1:53:25] to go by Samaria.
[1:53:28] I believe that he has needs to come by
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Headstone Tabernacle
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; this afternoon.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; You see, he wasn't just going aimlessly,
[1:53:39] half-hazardly
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; because he knew that there was some
[1:53:43] place that there was a predestinated
[1:53:47] seat
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; that he would fight faith.
[1:53:51] [Applause]
[1:53:55] She couldn't go with the rest of the
[1:53:57] women
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; because she was a prostitute.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; What was it? Six husbands and the one
[1:54:02] she was living with wasn't her husband.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; But there goes Jesus.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; The disciples go into town to get some
[1:54:11] food. And Jesus stays behind because
[1:54:13] he's got an appointment.
[1:54:16] because God by his fornowledge knew that
[1:54:18] there was going to be some faith
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; and he wanted to have a believer
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; to anoint him with that faith.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; He wanted to hear someone say, "You're
[1:54:30] the Messiah."
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; He was tired of hearing be elab.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; He was tired of hearing, "Get out of our
[1:54:36] midst. Get up out of our church. Get out
[1:54:38] of our circle."
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; He was ready to find some faith.
[1:54:47] I'm feeling good.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; He was ready to make his journey.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; He couldn't find it down there in the
[1:54:58] city.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; He was unwelcome in the city,
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; but he had to come at a certain time.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; It was a predestinated hour.
[1:55:08] No one else wanted the woman, but Jesus
[1:55:12] wanted to come in contact with that
[1:55:15] woman.
[1:55:19] She had to come out of the camp.
[1:55:22] She had to be just be considered an
[1:55:24] outcast.
[1:55:26] But when Jesus came, he didn't see a
[1:55:29] prostitute. He saw faith.
[1:55:34] I tell you young people, it's not
[1:55:37] popular standing on this message. It's
[1:55:40] not popular to say this day, this
[1:55:43] scripture is fulfilled. We're not
[1:55:45] looking for Messiah. Messiah is here
[1:55:49] now. It's the promise of his word.
[1:55:53] But he's looking for someone to anoint
[1:55:56] him with faith and make this Messiah
[1:56:00] live.
[1:56:02] [Music]
[1:56:06] He lived in the days of William
[1:56:08] Brandham.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; He lived in the days of the revealing.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; But now it's your turn.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Now it's your turn
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; to suffer without the gate.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; To suffer without the camp,
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; to suffer the reproach of standing for
[1:56:27] this message.
[1:56:29] Now it's your time to say you're
[1:56:31] Messiah. You're the living, anointed,
[1:56:34] vindicated Christ. And anoint him with
[1:56:37] your faith and say, "I know you're my
[1:56:39] healer. I know you'll fill me with the
[1:56:41] Holy Ghost. I know you'll change my
[1:56:44] life."
[1:56:50] the old scripture
[1:56:53] mixed with the old scripture, the old
[1:56:56] prophecy of what Messiah would be. And
[1:56:59] the present tense experience that Jesus
[1:57:02] was giving that woman, it made the
[1:57:05] Messiah to her. I tell you friends, the
[1:57:09] old scripture, I will restore, saith the
[1:57:13] Lord. The old scripture, Elias shall
[1:57:16] come and restore the faith. The old
[1:57:20] scripture, so shall it be at the
[1:57:22] revealing of the son of man. The old
[1:57:25] scripture
[1:57:27] mixed with the experience that God has
[1:57:29] given us that he's a living reality. It
[1:57:32] brings Messiah among us.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; It brings him out of the word.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; He begins to walk the aisles. Amen.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; We have a real Messiah.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of impersonations of
[1:57:48] Messiah, but we've got a real Messiah.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; We got a Messiah that knows your heart.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; We we we got a Messiah that knows your
[1:57:57] name.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; We got a Messiah that can change
[1:58:02] situations.
[1:58:03] [Applause]
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; It's a real Messiah. He hears your
[1:58:07] prayer.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; It's not just a man preaching.
[1:58:11] But the prophet of God pointed us to a
[1:58:13] real Messiah,
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; a real vindicated message that still
[1:58:17] deserves the thoughts and intents of the
[1:58:19] heart.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; I may know not I may not know what's in
[1:58:25] your heart, but this word does.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Your pastor may not know what's in your
[1:58:31] heart, but this word does. And this word
[1:58:34] is not a dead letter. This word is
[1:58:36] logos.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; This word is a pillar of fire. And the
[1:58:41] pillar of fire accompanies the message
[1:58:43] jo. And the pillar of fire is what is
[1:58:45] convicting your heart. The pillar of
[1:58:48] fire is what say, "Hey, all you've got
[1:58:50] to do is believe me. All you've got to
[1:58:52] do is accept my grace. I'll be a living
[1:58:56] God to you. I'll change your life. I'll
[1:58:59] fill you with the Holy Ghost. I'll give
[1:59:01] you the grace to inherit all things.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; I'll walk with you. I'll be God in your
[1:59:08] skin.
[1:59:10] Hallelujah. It's a real Messiah.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; You see, every promise is laying right
[1:59:17] here in this Bible.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; And it's just as good as the day he
[1:59:21] spoke it.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; But it takes faith to ignite it.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Some of you hunters may know what I'm
[1:59:29] talking about,
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; but if you've got a rifle, you've got a
[1:59:33] shell,
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; that bullet has the power. It's got the
[1:59:38] It's got the powder within it.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; It's got the bullet.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; It It It It's got the primer in it.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; But you still got to squeeze the
[1:59:48] trigger.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; You got to put it in the chamber.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; You got to point it at the right
[1:59:55] direction.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; That is thus sayeth the Lord. The
[1:59:59] direction,
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; the prophet, the messenger, the
[2:00:02] vindication of his word is the
[2:00:04] direction.
[2:00:06] Not three gods, one God. Not a dead
[2:00:10] tradition, a living reality.
[2:00:12] Not a hope so religion, a no so
[2:00:16] revelation, the power of God in your
[2:00:18] life.
[2:00:22] [Music]
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Now you got to have faith. Don't
[2:00:26] hesitate.
[2:00:27] You put that devil right in your right
[2:00:30] right in your crosshairs. You put
[2:00:32] pornography right in your crosshairs.
[2:00:35] You put all unbelief right in your
[2:00:37] crosshairs. You put sickness right in
[2:00:39] your crosshairs. You put this tormenting
[2:00:42] spirit right in your crosshairs. You
[2:00:44] take those spirits that say you're going
[2:00:46] to the tribulation, put them in your
[2:00:48] crosshairs. And now you got to have the
[2:00:50] faith to pull the trigger and say,
[2:00:54] "Satan, I'm through with you. I'm
[2:00:57] through with your lies. I'm through with
[2:00:59] your torment. I'm through with Leosa.
[2:01:05] [Music]
[2:01:06] Put your faith in action.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Ignite it.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Make this word lit.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Ignite it with faith.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Change your confession. He's the high
[2:01:19] priest of your confession.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Change your confession.
[2:01:23] Change it upon the basis of it's
[2:01:25] written. It is written, I am his
[2:01:28] righteousness. It is written, I am pure,
[2:01:32] virtuous, sinless.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; It is written, I am not man-handled,
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; but I am the virgin.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; I am a virgin of his word.
[2:01:44] [Applause]
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; It's time to put away the scars.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; It's time to put away the past.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; It's time to put away the regrets.
[2:01:57] What's keeping you from pulling the
[2:01:59] trigger?
[2:02:01] Put it in the black. Put in the sea of
[2:02:04] forgetfulness. Get back to the message.
[2:02:07] Get back to believing for all things.
[2:02:10] Get back to claiming your children. Get
[2:02:12] back to believing the promises for you
[2:02:14] and your children.
[2:02:19] Get back to it. The simplicity of
[2:02:23] saying, "God, I believe it's for me.
[2:02:27] When you say that,
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; you've got a high priest that is
[2:02:30] interceding upon your confession.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; But if you won't confess it,
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; then he can't intercede.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Because he's the high priest of your
[2:02:44] confession.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; He's already put the word here.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; He's already vindicated it.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; He's already shown you that he's here.
[2:02:52] He's already proved his presence is
[2:02:54] among us to vindicate this word again
[2:02:56] and again and again and again because
[2:02:58] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:02:59] forever.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; But you've got to believe it and confess
[2:03:03] it and stand upon it.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; And then he is making good before the
[2:03:08] father and saying, "I died for him. I
[2:03:11] died for his victory. I died that he can
[2:03:13] have the Holy Ghost."
[2:03:15] [Applause]
[2:03:21] You see, faith comes by the word.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Faith comes by hearing
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; hearing the word of God.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God would say that
[2:03:31] this is the word age.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; He would actually say it's his age.
[2:03:38] We've had we've had a lot of ages,
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; but this is his age.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; This this is when we've moved beyond the
[2:03:49] carrier stages.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; We've went beyond just an emotion and a
[2:03:55] sensation.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; We've we've we've went beyond. We
[2:03:59] believe in all that. We believe in the
[2:04:00] shouting. We believe in the rejoicing.
[2:04:02] We we believe that there's stimulation
[2:04:04] of revelation, but our experience moves
[2:04:06] beyond that.
[2:04:12] Because when you don't feel like
[2:04:13] shouting,
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; the word is still here.
[2:04:16] [Music]
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; When you're not on top of the mountain
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; and you're down in the valley, he's
[2:04:22] still here. The lily of the valley.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; When you wake up some days and you don't
[2:04:28] feel like you're a Christian and you
[2:04:29] don't feel like you've got the Holy
[2:04:31] Ghost and you don't feel like you're
[2:04:32] going to make the rapture, he's still
[2:04:34] the word.
[2:04:36] Come out of camps.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Come out of the ages.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Come into the reality
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; that he's here.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; His word is here. And
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; his word is what we're feeding on.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; It's giving us faith.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; When not when not everything's going
[2:04:55] right, we still got faith.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; When things are happening and our
[2:05:00] children are wandering off, we still got
[2:05:01] faith.
[2:05:03] Amen.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Young people, when it looks like the
[2:05:06] revival has left your home, you've still
[2:05:08] got faith
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; because your revival is not dependent
[2:05:12] upon mom and dad. It's not dependent
[2:05:14] upon your pastor. It's not depending
[2:05:16] upon it's depending upon your faith.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; It's depending upon the revelation of
[2:05:22] who Christ is and who you are in Christ.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; You're going to have good days. You're
[2:05:30] going to have bad days.
[2:05:32] You're going to feel like you're about
[2:05:33] to make the rapture. Then you're going
[2:05:34] to feel like, "Oh, God, I don't know if
[2:05:35] I'm going to make it."
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't change
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; anything because you've got a
[2:05:42] revelation.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; And the revelation is what anchors you.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; So God knew that you would be in the
[2:05:50] worst of all the ages.
[2:05:53] [Music]
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; So he said, "I'm going to restore the
[2:05:57] faith
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; that was once delivered to the saints.
[2:06:02] And that faith was given by the word
[2:06:05] himself.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Peter that gave us the faith.
[2:06:10] It wasn't Paul that gave us the faith.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; It was the revealing of the son of man
[2:06:14] that gave us the faith.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; For in the beginning was the word. The
[2:06:17] word was with God. The word was God. And
[2:06:19] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[2:06:20] us.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; And this is the faith
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; that the church was built upon.
[2:06:28] And this is the faith that has been
[2:06:31] revealed in the last days
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; that in between the son of god
[2:06:36] dispensation through the seven church
[2:06:38] ages and the son of David dispensation
[2:06:41] there's another turning of the corner
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; and that is when the son of man himself
[2:06:46] is revealed again to restore his faith
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; not a man faith
[2:06:55] not a tradition faith
[2:06:57] Not a denominational faith,
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; not a Baptist faith,
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Presbyterian faith, Pentecostal faith,
[2:07:04] and not a message faith.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; This is the Son of Man himself.
[2:07:12] Will I find faith? When the Son of Man
[2:07:15] comes, when I come, will I find faith?
[2:07:19] He's looking for a certain kind of a
[2:07:20] faith. A mountain moving faith. A
[2:07:24] supernatural faith. A faith that can
[2:07:27] speak the word. A faith that knows that
[2:07:30] as long as you're speaking what this
[2:07:32] mighty angel has given us is thus sayeth
[2:07:35] the Lord. You can say I'm healed without
[2:07:38] any evidence and say I am healed by his
[2:07:41] stripes.
[2:07:43] My children is going to be saved by the
[2:07:46] finished work of Calvary.
[2:07:49] It's because you've been restored back
[2:07:51] to his faith. Before there's one
[2:07:53] evidence, before there's one grain of
[2:07:56] sand moving, the mountain is already
[2:07:58] moving.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; It's a creative faith.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; We look so much and praise God for it.
[2:08:11] Amen. The prophet of God would say that
[2:08:13] this is this is this faith.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. that can speak swirls into
[2:08:18] existence.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; And there was no squirrels.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; He said when Joshua said, "Son, stand
[2:08:23] still,"
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; he said the sun was there.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; But when I said, "Let there be a
[2:08:28] squirrel." There wasn't a squirrel.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; And then the prophet of God says, "We
[2:08:36] are creators."
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, we do not need, we
[2:08:40] don't need swirls.
[2:08:42] [Music]
[2:08:44] If we all sat around saying, "Let there
[2:08:46] be a squirrel. Let there be a squirrel.
[2:08:48] Let there be a squirrel." What's the
[2:08:50] good for a swirl? We don't have faith
[2:08:51] for a squirrel.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; But I tell you what we need, what we
[2:08:56] have faith for. We have the faith for an
[2:08:58] atmosphere.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Because it takes atmosphere for the
[2:09:02] supernatural God to be made manifest. If
[2:09:05] you want healing, create an atmosphere.
[2:09:08] You want the Holy Ghost, create an
[2:09:10] atmosphere. You want a rapture create an
[2:09:12] atmosphere. We are creators because we
[2:09:16] believe not just for swirls. We believe
[2:09:20] for all things.
[2:09:24] We believe for our body change. We
[2:09:25] believe for our children. We believe for
[2:09:27] the the millennium to come. We believe
[2:09:29] from deliverance from all things.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; An atmosphere.
[2:09:40] an atmosphere that can read the word and
[2:09:42] just say, "Lord, I believe it."
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure it out. Don't try to
[2:09:45] explain it.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Just say, "Lord, I believe it."
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm I'm I'm going through some
[2:09:53] great trials." I'll tell you why you're
[2:09:54] going through through some great trials.
[2:09:56] Because God has put you in this age to
[2:09:58] prove to Satan that you are not like
[2:10:00] Eve.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Eve got confused on one promise trying
[2:10:06] to reason with the devil. And that one
[2:10:09] promise was Hebrews 13:8 that Jesus
[2:10:11] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[2:10:13] forever. She can see where he was. He
[2:10:16] was God yesterday. The promise was true
[2:10:18] yesterday. But to believe it for today
[2:10:21] and for tomorrow, she couldn't do it.
[2:10:26] But there's a bride upon the earth
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; that is placed here in the worst of all
[2:10:33] the ages
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; to prove to Satan, you are not a hybrid.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; You're not a hot bed plant.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; You are not someone that is being
[2:10:43] shifted around with every wind of
[2:10:46] doctrine. Your feet are stable upon the
[2:10:49] rock of ages plant for me. Let me hide
[2:10:52] myself in. You are drinking from the
[2:10:55] water from the rock. Your strength of
[2:10:57] revelation is in your soul and you're
[2:10:59] standing there saying, "I will believe
[2:11:02] every word.
[2:11:06] I believe it." Whether I feel like it or
[2:11:09] not, I believe it.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Whether I feel saved or not, I believe I
[2:11:13] am.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Whether I feel like the millennium's
[2:11:15] forming or not, I believe it is.
[2:11:18] [Applause]
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; That's the faith.
[2:11:25] the faith. We're contending
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; for the faith that was once delivered
[2:11:30] unto the saints
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; by Jesus Christ himself.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; The saints is the called out ones.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; Separated from all unbelief.
[2:11:43] And the son of man, Jesus Christ, is
[2:11:45] revealed in this age to restore that
[2:11:48] same kind of faith.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; A super faith,
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; a super race,
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; my word shall bring forth of its kind, a
[2:12:00] super race,
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; justification, sanctification, baptism
[2:12:05] of the Holy Ghost. But now back to the
[2:12:07] grain. My word shall bring forth of its
[2:12:11] kind.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; That word seed will not return into God
[2:12:18] void.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; That word will not return unto God and
[2:12:22] say, "Well, we tried.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; We tried,
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; but we're not going to have a harvest.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; We tried, but there is no sons of God
[2:12:32] ripening to a perfect faith. We tried,
[2:12:35] but the father says, "I'm looking for
[2:12:38] that kind of a faith that my word will
[2:12:42] not return to me void. For when I send
[2:12:45] the word forth out of my mouth, it goes
[2:12:47] as a seed. And I predestinated a bride
[2:12:50] in the last days that has washed her
[2:12:53] garments from all the impurities of
[2:12:55] unbelief." And she will put her
[2:12:58] shoulders back and stand there with one
[2:13:01] foot on land, one foot on sea. every
[2:13:03] power under her feet and say, "Satan,
[2:13:07] you're under me. Satan, you have no
[2:13:10] place in my life. You have no place in
[2:13:12] my confession. You have no authority in
[2:13:15] my life."
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Standing there shoulders back saying, "I
[2:13:20] am a possessor.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; I stand upon this word.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; I am him.
[2:13:29] [Applause]
[2:13:35] You got to have that kind of a faith
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; to be able to say when you see me.
[2:13:44] [Applause]
[2:13:47] [Music]
[2:13:48] [Applause]
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Got to look at that mirror of the word
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; because you're not seeing yourself after
[2:13:54] the flesh. you're seeing by revelation,
[2:13:57] what you're hiding,
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; watch your tabernacling.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; And you're looking at that word and
[2:14:03] you're put looking in there and you you
[2:14:04] see your faults. You see your mistakes.
[2:14:06] You see everything. But you're standing
[2:14:07] there with a revelation and saying, "But
[2:14:09] I am him.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; I am his righteousness. I am his
[2:14:13] holiness.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; I am his perfection.
[2:14:20] That's the faith.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; That we are contending for in this last
[2:14:25] days.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Do I have a little bit more time?
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; I don't even know what time I've been
[2:14:31] got up here.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; There's thousands of voices
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; vying for influence over us.
[2:14:45] We're in an age of influencers.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; Influencers everywhere.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; Someone can wake up and
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; go get a bowl of cereal and
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; turn on their
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; whatever.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Don't even know what thing's called.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; Begin to and begin to eat your bowl of
[2:15:08] cereal if you want to and try to
[2:15:09] influence thousands that
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; this is what you need to do.
[2:15:15] That's right.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; You say that's silly. And yet people's
[2:15:18] doing it.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Young people, it's your generation.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; The thousands
[2:15:29] are trying to influence your life.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; Political voices trying to influence
[2:15:36] you.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Religious voices trying to influence
[2:15:39] you. Yes.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Carnal voices. Your own flesh and
[2:15:45] humanity trying to influence you.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; So much confusion on what's truth
[2:15:53] that this age said that there would be
[2:15:55] gross darkness
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; would cover the earth
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; to anoint us with unbelief.
[2:16:03] You see, it's
[2:16:06] it's these voices that deadens the voice
[2:16:09] of the supernatural.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; That God can be speaking
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; and you won't even hear it.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; But you see, the prophet of God says end
[2:16:22] time message should meet end time
[2:16:24] conditions.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Where they got off, the message ought to
[2:16:29] bring it back. Always end time message
[2:16:33] meets end time conditions. A call back
[2:16:36] to the original word. Amen.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet of God would say
[2:16:41] that it was uninspired leadership.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; That when Jesus came, the word incarnate
[2:16:52] Elohim,
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; incarnate in flesh,
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; uninspired leadership is the one that
[2:16:59] was blinding the eyes of the people
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; from seeing him.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; If you believe that, you're going to be
[2:17:06] in a cult. If you believe that, you're
[2:17:07] going to be crazy. If you believe that,
[2:17:09] you're you're you're you're going to be
[2:17:11] a holy roller.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; You're going to be a Jesusite.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; You see, uninspired leadership,
[2:17:21] leading the people into all kinds of
[2:17:24] traditions
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; and turning the traditions into the into
[2:17:28] the doctrines of man and making the word
[2:17:30] of God of none effect. That's right.
[2:17:33] and all the while saying they believe
[2:17:35] the scripture.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; And the whole time they're pointing the
[2:17:39] people to history
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; and then saying, "Someday it's coming.
[2:17:46] Someday Messiah is coming." And all the
[2:17:48] time reading what Moses said that the
[2:17:51] Lord thy God shall raise up a prophet
[2:17:53] like unto me. And everyone knew it was
[2:17:55] going to be the Messiah.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Everyone knew. Every religious leader
[2:18:00] knew the Messiah was going to be born in
[2:18:03] Bethlehem.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; And yet here comes some wise men
[2:18:06] following the direction of the pillar of
[2:18:08] fire, that star.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; And they could say, "Yeah, it's supposed
[2:18:12] to be born in Bethlehem, but we can't
[2:18:15] believe it."
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; And instead of going to worship him,
[2:18:19] they tried to kill him.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; That just by chance, it really truly is
[2:18:27] the king. We want to kill its influence.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Uninspired leadership.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Killing the influence of the word.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Uninspired leadership. Always pointing
[2:18:41] backwards and always pointing in the
[2:18:43] future, but cannot stand there and voice
[2:18:46] the words of a vindicated prophet. This
[2:18:48] day, this scripture is fulfilled.
[2:18:54] uninspired leadership instead of leading
[2:18:57] the people to say what a prophet says
[2:19:00] that she is him.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; I didn't say it.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; The prophet said it.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; The word that God sent to this
[2:19:10] generation said this bride is him.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; This bride is the final voice to the
[2:19:17] final age under her messenger.
[2:19:23] In the sermon leadership,
[2:19:26] I believe the last sermon outside of
[2:19:28] communion, brother Brennham preached, he
[2:19:31] would again bring up the young man that
[2:19:32] come to Jesus and said, "What must I do
[2:19:36] to have eternal life?"
[2:19:39] And
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; we we know the story, but we find out
[2:19:42] that Jesus told him, "Go sell all that
[2:19:45] you have and follow me."
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; That's inspired leadership. Amen.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Take up your cross, young people.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Take up the reproach
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; of what God has vindicated
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; to be his grace in this hour. Amen.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; What God has proven when he has healed
[2:20:07] the sick and he's raised the dead and he
[2:20:09] delivered the oppressed and he's brought
[2:20:11] jubilee and he's turned our mourning
[2:20:14] into joy and he's taken our ashes and
[2:20:17] turned it into beauty.
[2:20:19] [Applause]
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; And when we can see all around us
[2:20:22] judgment is upon this earth, gross
[2:20:25] darkness upon this earth. And yet God
[2:20:28] has given us his light.
[2:20:35] But all Jesus is saying,
[2:20:38] "Come follow me."
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; You see, I I'll lead you to eternal
[2:20:43] life.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; I And as you're following him,
[2:20:48] he's leading you not to just another
[2:20:51] stage, but he's leading you, changing
[2:20:54] you from glory to glory
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; until you're his image.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:00] It's not your righteousness. It's his
[2:21:02] righteousness.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; It's not your holiness. He's led you to
[2:21:05] a faith to realize it's his holiness.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; You're still going to make mistakes.
[2:21:11] You're going to make mistakes as long as
[2:21:12] you're in this human body. But there's
[2:21:14] something about a faith
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; that can realize you are made perfect by
[2:21:19] the blood of Jesus Christ.
[2:21:25] a faith that it can accept that kind of
[2:21:27] a grace
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; because friends, it's only going to be
[2:21:30] by his grace that we make the rapture.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; You see, you got to you got to follow
[2:21:40] him. What does it mean to take up your
[2:21:42] cross and follow him? Well, you got to
[2:21:44] follow him outside the camp of just
[2:21:46] religious limitations.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; Limitations. You can only go so far. You
[2:21:52] can only believe so much.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Well, you can't believe that's for you.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe so in the future. The
[2:21:59] bride's revival is coming in the future.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; But to be able to take the scripture and
[2:22:03] believe that it's for this day and right
[2:22:05] now in the present tense and say this is
[2:22:07] my generation.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; I've been ordained for this time.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Always putting limitations.
[2:22:16] But you see the prophet of God says the
[2:22:17] limitations are taken off with God
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; because we have moved from one power to
[2:22:23] a greater power to a greater power.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Just as man went from science went from
[2:22:28] horse and buggy to an automobile which
[2:22:31] is just only you know one p one horse to
[2:22:34] 20 horses.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; And then it went from that to a an an
[2:22:39] airplane
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; which was just greater horsepower.
[2:22:43] But then it went to an astronaut age.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; It's just Holy Ghost upon Holy Ghost
[2:22:48] upon Holy Ghost.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; It's just word upon word upon word upon
[2:22:53] words.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; But now we've got unlimited power.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; Not just to make it to the moon,
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; but to make it to the supernatural
[2:23:07] realms
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; of that heavenly dimension
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; where there's angels
[2:23:13] where his presence is,
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; where the supernatural is made manifest,
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; a power pushing us.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; We can't be satisfied with lay out a sea
[2:23:26] of lukewarmness.
[2:23:28] But this message is the flame of the
[2:23:30] hour and it's the flame of my heart and
[2:23:32] we're desiring the power of the Holy
[2:23:35] Ghost to move among us.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; Young people, we've got to have the Holy
[2:23:41] Ghost.
[2:23:43] We've we've moved beyond just a stage.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; We move beyond just going to church.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; We move beyond just just going through
[2:23:52] the traditions of the message.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; But we moved into the realms of
[2:23:57] unlimited power
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; to believe for all things.
[2:24:01] We've been restored back to the
[2:24:03] supernatural
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; where God can change habits and God can
[2:24:08] take things over your life that the
[2:24:10] devil's been holding you captive and it
[2:24:12] can be God in the moment.
[2:24:14] [Music]
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; That's where we're at.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; Unlimited.
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; Believe for all things.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; Don't put a limit on it.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; The rapture could take place. Amen.
[2:24:28] We're not saying it's days away. It
[2:24:31] could take place right now. It could
[2:24:32] take place in the morning.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; We can be changed in a moment of the
[2:24:36] twinkling of an eye.
[2:24:39] [Music]
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; The way that this world is going. No
[2:24:44] longer is just we listening to a
[2:24:46] message. The world is falling apart.
[2:24:48] Everyone knows the world's falling
[2:24:49] apart.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; Whether they believe the message or not,
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; they know that this world is doomed.
[2:24:56] Amen.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; People don't like to hear it, but I I
[2:25:00] dare to say that we're already in third
[2:25:02] in in World War II.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; Things are moving.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; But that's not fear trying to bring us
[2:25:12] to God.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; You don't bring people to the kingdom of
[2:25:16] God through fear.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; But I'm saying that to anoint your faith
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; that God sent a prophet to warn us.
[2:25:28] that we are living in the time that the
[2:25:29] ancient of days
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; has been made manifest.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Daniel saw him and said, "It's the
[2:25:36] ancient of days."
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; John saw him and said that he has white
[2:25:41] hair.
[2:25:44] But when the prophet of God saw him,
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; he said, "I'll tell you who that ancient
[2:25:49] of days is.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you who John saw."
[2:25:54] It's like the judges
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; that when they would sit upon there in
[2:26:00] the old time in the England and I think
[2:26:02] maybe they still do it. I don't I don't
[2:26:03] know. But but but when they were sitting
[2:26:06] on that that seat to represent their
[2:26:09] authority, they would take a white wig
[2:26:12] and put it on them and and it was
[2:26:14] symbolizing the authority they had as a
[2:26:17] judge.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God told us who it was.
[2:26:22] But then he began to tell us that
[2:26:25] there's a there's a there's a second
[2:26:27] climax to my ministry.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; There's something that's about to take
[2:26:30] place.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; These others has just been preparation.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; It's been preparing your hearts to let
[2:26:38] you know that God is here. God's doing
[2:26:40] something.
[2:26:41] [Applause]
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; You begin to tell us what's it all
[2:26:44] about, sir. What time is it?
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; Begin to tell us, is this what it is?
[2:26:49] The Is this the those seven thunders? Is
[2:26:52] is this the mystery of the seven seals?
[2:26:54] What what is it?
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; But then God told him, you go to Tucson?
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; He didn't know exactly what it was
[2:27:01] about. But for one time, he thought it
[2:27:03] was going to be the end of his life. But
[2:27:04] then he found out it was the furtherance
[2:27:06] of his ministry. He was the third pull.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; And there he was there in Sabino Canyon.
[2:27:13] He's got his hands up and he's praising
[2:27:14] God. He's just praying and all the
[2:27:16] sudden something struck his hand and
[2:27:19] he's looking at it. It's so real. And
[2:27:21] he's he's looking at it. He's said, "My,
[2:27:23] that's so beautiful."
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "I remember the kings used to
[2:27:26] have something like this." And he said,
[2:27:28] "I've always been kind of afraid of it,
[2:27:31] but all of a sudden the voice spoke and
[2:27:33] said, "It's the king sword."
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would tell us in the
[2:27:40] seventh seal that he was the third pole.
[2:27:44] Hallelujah.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; The opening of the word
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; and he would tell us that's what those
[2:27:49] consolation of angels was about.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; Seven angels
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; that he told us it's coming.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; But then he would tell us and what's
[2:28:00] this? What's the attraction of the
[2:28:01] mountain? He would say it was prophecy.
[2:28:05] Now it's fulfillment.
[2:28:07] [Applause]
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; What was it all about?
[2:28:11] The prophet of God would say, "A man
[2:28:14] says,"Those seven angels was the third
[2:28:17] pole of my ministry coming back to
[2:28:20] unveil, unfold the mysteries of the
[2:28:22] entire Bible."
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; It was God speaking.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; It was God saying, "Time is no more."
[2:28:32] The judge standing forth, Christ
[2:28:34] standing with the with the open book,
[2:28:37] one for the land, one for the sea,
[2:28:38] declaring time is no more.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; I tell you what that means. What this
[2:28:44] message means for you and I. Time is no
[2:28:47] more.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Time for those denominational system is
[2:28:50] no more.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; Time for cold creeds is no more.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; Cold for lukewarmness is no more.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; Cold. Amen. The time to be bound in sin
[2:29:02] and trespasses is no more.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; The time to wonder if you're going to
[2:29:09] make the rapture, no more.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; The time to just be a beggar and
[2:29:14] wandering around with a low self-esteem
[2:29:16] and a low confession. No more.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; But now is bride time.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; Now is the bride age.
[2:29:26] Now is the time to see who you are and
[2:29:29] say, "That's me."
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; Stand upon the promises of God.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; I'm getting somewhere.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet of God
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; would say, "Now, we've been looking at
[2:29:46] it the wrong way."
[2:29:52] He would say
[2:29:54] everyone looking at the clouds
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; trying to figure out the angels and was
[2:29:59] it is it this one or is it that one? And
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; but then the Lord,
[2:30:06] the angel came to brother Brandham and
[2:30:08] said, "You've got to turn it to the
[2:30:09] right.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; You're looking at it wrong. You got to
[2:30:13] look at it right." He thought, "Well, I
[2:30:15] thought I was looking at it right." He
[2:30:16] said, "No, you got to turn it to the
[2:30:18] right." And when he turned it,
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; there was what Daniel saw as the ancient
[2:30:25] of days.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; There was what John saw as the revealing
[2:30:28] of the son of man, the judge.
[2:30:31] [Applause]
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; And now the prophet is looking at that
[2:30:36] picture and saying, "I'll tell you who
[2:30:37] that is. It's my Lord up there."
[2:30:40] [Applause]
[2:30:44] Now, it brings us to our scripture
[2:30:46] reading.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; Because there's a widow woman,
[2:30:51] she's not under a husband.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; All right?
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; Her headship has died.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; But she's got a need.
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; All right?
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; And she's going before a judge.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; But this judge is unrighteous. He's
[2:31:09] unholy. He's He's unjust. He doesn't
[2:31:11] fear God.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; But she because she's got a need
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; begins to knock.
[2:31:24] And the judge is already in bed.
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; He don't want to get up. He don't want
[2:31:29] to get out of bed.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; It's night time.
[2:31:33] But that woman keeps knocking.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; She's got a need.
[2:31:37] She knows that it's the judge that can
[2:31:40] help her.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; She's not running from the judge. She's
[2:31:43] not scared of the judge. She understands
[2:31:45] that the only one that can help her in
[2:31:48] her situation is someone with that kind
[2:31:50] of authority.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; It's more than a preacher. It's more
[2:31:56] than just a Pharisee. It's more than
[2:31:57] just a Sadducee. It's more than just a
[2:31:59] good man. It's going to take someone
[2:32:01] with authority.
[2:32:04] So she keeps knocking
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; and the judge says, "Unless she weary
[2:32:10] me,
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; I've got to get up.
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; I don't want to, but I've got to get up.
[2:32:16] I don't fear man, and I don't fear God,
[2:32:18] but I fear that woman.
[2:32:20] [Applause]
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; I fear her persistence.
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; I fear that she's not going to give up.
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; I fear that she's going to stay here all
[2:32:28] night if she has to. I fear that she
[2:32:31] understands my authority and my position
[2:32:34] and she's going to re and she's going to
[2:32:36] stay there until I release to her what
[2:32:38] she has need of.
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; So she he opens the door and gives her
[2:32:47] her petition.
[2:32:50] Now fast forward
[2:32:52] because Jesus said, "Will I find that
[2:32:55] kind of faith?"
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; Will I come when the son of man is
[2:33:01] revealed? Will I find that kind of
[2:33:04] faith?
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; Will I find a little bride that is no
[2:33:08] longer under the headship of
[2:33:10] denominations? Will I find a little
[2:33:12] bride that has died out to hurt all the
[2:33:16] other authorities?
[2:33:18] Will I find a bride that will realize
[2:33:23] that I'm her answer? I'm supreme
[2:33:25] authority. I am the judge. I can give
[2:33:29] mercy. I can give healing. I can give
[2:33:32] deliverance. I can grant to her her
[2:33:35] petition.
[2:33:39] Will I find that kind of a faith
[2:33:43] that that little bride is persistent?
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; Persistent means tenacious. You promised
[2:33:48] it.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; We're not standing before an unjust
[2:33:52] judge. We're standing before a
[2:33:54] righteous, holy God who said, "If you'll
[2:33:57] ask it, I'll give it to you. If you seek
[2:34:00] for it, I'll let you find it.
[2:34:06] I will not withhold any good thing from
[2:34:08] you." Young people, you're promised the
[2:34:11] Holy Ghost. You're promised you if
[2:34:13] you'll ask for it, he'll fill you.
[2:34:16] He promised that you he would give you
[2:34:18] faith. Not to just make it from Monday
[2:34:20] to Tuesday, from Sunday to Monday, but
[2:34:24] he's going to give you a faith that'll
[2:34:26] rapture you out of here.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; We're not scared of the judge.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; Judgment has already been pronounced.
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "I don't pray
[2:34:40] for America anymore." She's already lo
[2:34:43] She's already in judgment.
[2:34:46] She's missed her day of visitation.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; But I've got a predestinated bride.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; I have predestinated believers.
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; And it's 2025.
[2:34:55] And I promise I'll never leave her. I'll
[2:34:57] never forsake her, but I'll grant to her
[2:35:00] her petition. Ask that your joy may be
[2:35:03] filled. Ask that you can receive the
[2:35:07] promises that I said you can have.
[2:35:11] [Applause]
[2:35:15] You see, that's why the pillar of fire
[2:35:18] accompanies the message always.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; It's because it's the pillar of fire
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; that companies the word
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; to make it manifest.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; Not a dead letter, not a tradition,
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; but something that's got life.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; What is the pillar of fire doing?
[2:35:36] Looking for believers.
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:40] the prophet of God after the seven
[2:35:41] seals. Remember, I I'm closing. Oh, you
[2:35:44] forgive me. I probably been really
[2:35:46] long-winded.
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; I just want to show you something.
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; Remember
[2:35:56] after the seals and brother Brandham is
[2:35:58] in Albuquerque and he's preaching God
[2:36:00] hiding himself in simplicity in
[2:36:01] Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[2:36:04] And at the end of that service,
[2:36:07] he's talking about seeing the pillar of
[2:36:09] fire.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; And there's believers that are searching
[2:36:12] for the Holy Ghost.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham just begins to say,
[2:36:15] "Now surrender."
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; You see, remember, Brother Brandham
[2:36:20] preached, I believe it was three
[2:36:23] services,
[2:36:24] what is the Holy Ghost,
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; what is it given for, and how to receive
[2:36:28] it.
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; But he didn't record how to receive it.
[2:36:32] Right. Right.
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; But God in his grace.
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; All the way in 1963 in Albuquerque,
[2:36:43] brother Brandham or God allows a
[2:36:45] recording where the prophet of God just
[2:36:47] begins to say, "Now just surrender.
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; Just surrender."
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm looking right at it.
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at the pillar of fire. I'm
[2:36:55] looking at the Holy Ghost. He's
[2:36:57] searching for someone that he can feel.
[2:36:59] I see it. Just surrender. Amen.
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; Just sir, what is he doing? He's
[2:37:03] teaching you how to receive it. You
[2:37:06] don't have to beg.
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; You don't have to repent and so much and
[2:37:13] say, "I don't know if I'm worthy." No.
[2:37:15] Repent.
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; Get it under the blood.
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; But then say, "Oh, God, you promised it.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; God, I surrender my life to you. You
[2:37:24] promised me the Holy Ghost
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; and the same pillar of fire that the
[2:37:28] prophet said, I'm looking right at it.
[2:37:30] Amen.
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; And then he would tell Deus Shakarian
[2:37:33] and say, "Come here. Come here, brother
[2:37:34] Deus." Say, "Right there. Right there.
[2:37:35] Right." See, it's going to it. He He
[2:37:38] says, "It's right over that lady." And
[2:37:39] you can hear on the tape scream.
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; What is he showing? It's your promise.
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; You've got a right to this.
[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; But it's not how much you're good enough
[2:37:57] to earn it. It's not how holy you are.
[2:38:00] It's not how righteous you are. It's not
[2:38:01] how much money you burn. It's it's not
[2:38:03] how much tithe you give. It's the faith
[2:38:05] that you've got
[2:38:08] &gt;&gt; to realize that there's a deep calling
[2:38:11] into the deep and there's a thirst for
[2:38:12] it. And if there's a thirst, then that
[2:38:14] means it's for you.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; It's the same for healing. It's the same
[2:38:20] for deliverance. It's the same for
[2:38:21] anything that you would have need of.
[2:38:23] All you got to do is open your heart and
[2:38:24] say, "Lord, I surrender." Amen.
[2:38:27] Hallelujah.
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; You see, you got to say it like this. I
[2:38:31] I don't have the quote in front of me,
[2:38:32] but I believe the prophet of God said it
[2:38:34] like this. Said, you've got to be like
[2:38:35] that little widow woman and say, "Lord,
[2:38:38] I'm on your hands.
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not giving up.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not turning away."
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; You know what persistence means?
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; Tenacious.
[2:38:51] &gt;&gt; Tenacious.
[2:38:53] In other words, stubborn.
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; In other words, I ain't going anywhere.
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; I need it and you promised it.
[2:39:03] &gt;&gt; And it mean and that means it's mine.
[2:39:06] &gt;&gt; Now, Lord, I'm going to stay right here
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to begin to quote your own
[2:39:11] word and say, "It's your promise.
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; It's your promise,
[2:39:16] &gt;&gt; Lord. Fill my cup,
[2:39:18] &gt;&gt; Lord. Change my life." as the musicians
[2:39:21] just begin to play that.
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; Y'all know that song, I need you, Lord.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord,
[2:39:32] &gt;&gt; right now.
[2:39:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, I need you, Lord.
[2:39:41] I need you, Lord,
[2:39:44] right now.
[2:39:50] I lift my hands.
[2:39:53] I bow my knees.
[2:39:57] I worship
[2:39:59] at your throne.
[2:40:04] I need you, Lord.
[2:40:09] I need you, Lord,
[2:40:13] right now. Could you just bow your
[2:40:15] heads? Just close your eyes. Would there
[2:40:18] be any young person that would begin to
[2:40:20] just from their heart say, "I need you,
[2:40:22] Lord.
[2:40:24] I need you, Lord,
[2:40:27] right now." This is between you and God
[2:40:30] right now.
[2:40:32] &gt;&gt; Not you and the pastor, not you and mom
[2:40:34] and dad, not you and your friend,
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; but you're the individual. It's not to a
[2:40:39] group.
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:41] &gt;&gt; It's a personal revelation. Yes, sir.
[2:40:46] of Jesus Christ to your life.
[2:40:49] [Music]
[2:40:50] Is there something is there a longing
[2:40:54] something in you that would begin to
[2:40:55] say, "Lord, I need you."
[2:40:59] Maybe no one knows about the situation
[2:41:01] that you're going through. No one knows
[2:41:04] maybe what's happening on the internet,
[2:41:07] but I just want you to know that there's
[2:41:08] plenty of blood. There's plenty of
[2:41:10] grace. There's plenty of mercy.
[2:41:14] Yeah.
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; All it takes is an honest heart.
[2:41:19] Say, "Lord, fill me.
[2:41:22] Oh Lord, change me."
[2:41:26] Young people, you're not the generation
[2:41:28] of tomorrow.
[2:41:30] You're the generation of today.
[2:41:33] I know a lot of times we've said,
[2:41:35] "You're the generation of tomorrow."
[2:41:38] But I I I think that we should maybe
[2:41:41] change it and say you're the generation
[2:41:42] of today.
[2:41:45] I'm I'm looking at prayer warriors. I
[2:41:47] I'm looking at overcomers.
[2:41:49] I I'm looking at men and young men and
[2:41:52] young ladies that has the power to take
[2:41:55] the sword within your hand of faith and
[2:41:58] cut out every divine promise of God
[2:42:01] because it's for you.
[2:42:06] Oh, I need you, Lord.
[2:42:10] Need you, Lord, right now.
[2:42:17] I need you, Lord.
[2:42:19] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord,
[2:42:21] right now.

[2:42:27] &gt;&gt; If anyone is needing prayer, you're
[2:42:29] welcome to come.
[2:42:31] &gt;&gt; We'll pray for you.
[2:42:33] I love you young people. God loves you.
[2:42:36] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord.
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; God feels your pain. He knows your
[2:42:40] struggles. He knows everything about
[2:42:42] you, young people.
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; Elders alike if you need prayer.
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:42:47] &gt;&gt; But don't come as beggars.
