John chapter 20 we want to reform was 21 and 22 wanna go Luke chapter 24 from 44 to 33 on revelation 5:8 the 14 so they wanna read said John chapter 20 21 to 22 and when he had so said he he showed unto him his hands and his side and then would recite was glad when this sword and Lord o 21 and then said Jesus unto them again peace be unto you as my father had sent me so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive II the Holy Ghost they want to Luke chapter 24 from verse 44 and he said unto them these are the words which I speak unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the and in the son and the prophets and in the Psalms considered me then open he the understanding that they might understand the scriptures and he said unto them thus it is written and does it behoove Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and he are witnesses of these things and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high and he led them out as far as the Bethany and they lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up in heaven and they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy and they were continually in the temple praising and blessing and go on revelation chapter five you want to read from verse eight and when he had taken the book the four beasts on the phone twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the Saints and the summer new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth and I beheld I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of told you saying with a loud voice worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing on every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as in the sea and all that are in them who did I see and blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worship Him that liveth for ever and ever let us pray one more time father we thank you for your word we pray a common interpreter to our hearts and may a pour out your spirit and confirm a word with signs wonders and miracles we pray bless those here bless those connected us on the Internet may your spirit flow freely and speak to every heart we pray in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated or praise God or blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah oh it's a good thing to be in the house of God it's always a privilege to be in the house of God forgive your health and strength and your heart are you are here you want to get the benefit of being here in the service of the Lord amen how many appreciate the service last Sunday not by might nor by power but by my spirit god bless you but Aiza that was some message that was some sermon I tell you my god my mind was totally blown oh my and I so enjoyed it only was it taken across day in France so we are not creating a new standard this time that already exists oh praise what a standard of holiness standard of righteousness standard of purity a standard of forgiveness a standard of seven living voices the standard of always was and always will be this that is Jesus Christ Oh hallelujah had his only holy Lord to put this thing together like that oh my the people have been taught that Church as a standard but brother Branham left this time they went but her mama left the earth he didn't the standard didn't leave it's not right the standard was in the hand of the spirit and the spirit reveal it to whomsoever he will so so nobody had a license under or what the spirit can reveal isn't that wonderful so the spirit could reveal the ton s of whomsoever he will isn't that right blessed be the name of the law understand that was always here isn't that right and it was handed the spirit and the Holy Ghost is the standard bearer that will stand with any man who stands with the word I love that the Holy Spirit is the standard there was time with any man who stays with the word and this is the balm for me the spirit has no loyalty to man he only has lawyer t - though his word oh praise God do you see it now the spirit have no loyalty to any man so why run after a man please God stay with the world oh praise God hallelujah fight for the word stand by the word the word is God hallelujah praise God amen but this is so beautifully phrased full obedience to the entire word and titles you to be accompanied by the standard error Oh glory to God hallelujah love that when I'm safe full obedience in the food and title you to the Holy Ghost and title is it a token follow meters in the entire world and title you to be accompanied by the standard error it's the spirit that follows the word or you are free this morning to be what God made you to be isn't that right oh is the spirit that follows the woods I so enjoy that message I was tremendously blessed three is God is a message I would want to get on print or put it out that you could read it it's something that you really consider praise God that God will follow his word you see when a good on deeper you realize he's no respecter of persons I became a sponsor son passed a daughter elder son that don't Deacon son didn't daughter Deacon ll die doesn't matter who you think you are what you are board standard is his word and we have to come up to his word doesn't matter what position somebody hold and I told him in Paris Court is added up in the position is it up in the man she took as an engineer a doctor that is irrelevant what are you as a person praise God what are you as a person not a position I could sing good that's have nothing do with what we're talking about gotten us some nut up on your voice yet up in you praise God hallelujah praise God when I come to church I don't miss service that has definitely were talking about was adopting you he wants you brings gonna be told him in Paris not have a pastor is have a father he want that connection between you and him praise God Church supposed to be the conduit the rescue man and reconcile man and bring back man back to God not a system not a church but back to God and when you leave here and you make your prayer answer your prayer if it has a deep inside of you there's a client side of you yep I'm Sinkin who's talking a son is talking once more Lord let me die with the Philistines who is talking our son is talking respond to me the joy of my salvation who is talking a son is talking do I hear a man in the house Oh hallelujah praise God glory to God so God isn't interested in your pity party quite interesting you coming to maturity goodness and fire under your seat if you have to because you want to have a perfect Church an eagle of a perfect man not a perfect boy boy kite Hara clapping the chapel's that's nothing in the maturity you got to come to accept responsibility coming back Oh could somebody say Amen somebody oh this is the worthless of Who am L not by might not by power but by my spirit shared God Almighty Oh hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah every Kingdom is chicken every Kingdom is chicken Europe shaking America shakin everything is rocking you know the world has actually fallen apart so where you want the world for when everything is merciful around you Oh glory to God when we have a word that cannot be moved passed away but this word will never pass away [Applause] [Music] America don't even know what they have my Jesus thank God God's kingdom is not by election my man's election and man food can't thank God you don't have the people's vote to vote you into this position and vote you into that position in the kingdom of God what God have an election but is his election is his chuchi it's his choosin and I've got chose to deliver you this morning there's not enough Devils last night last year is not enough to stop you from your deliverance tonight I believe this morning that somebody wanna be set free praise God nothing gonna stop it this church is that differential this is a sovereign church we do what we want to do how we want to do it we have no bishop we have nobody to tell us what to do and hope to do it we feel that revival this morning you cannot a revival this morning we feel that our old fashioned sin killing demon chasing you name it we could have it this morning praise God because we could speak it and see it come to pass so give the Lord a shout in the house may be seated praise garleon man said a fine time in Paris praise the name of the Lord praise God will fighting or say that judges are treating to do cross the people over fight and then leave an inheritance we have seen the Lord that was a group testimony of the recyclers Christ's resurrection ministry I've seen the Lord since but a bomb left we have seen the Lord seen Revelation inspiration and so on we have seen the Lord but that was that seen the Lord is to point us to dynamics in the upper room it wasn't Jesus staying with them walking where they have no he raised from the dead he come in our mission to open the understanding and open the world that is all because once your understanding is open and the word is awkward when your wood is open to you you know what you have to possess you know why you have to go there is no other way to go the only one place the place of that position of the upper room and in that upper room they were praising and blessing Lord knowing again once in a while when they feel like that's not what the Bible says they were praising God continuing and you have to learn to do that I miss you're trying circumstance I miss you have headache back pain whatever it is I miss disasters you have to still worship because it's a promise praise God hallelujah hallelujah punish to you amen supper title this morning living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's my title this morning living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit you don't want to live under demon powers you don't want to live under the world you don't want to live under your whims and fancies your feeling and emotions you don't want to live under that you want to be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and I have an inspiration these are the words that's the first thing Jesus told them these are the words he didn't give them more words a new words he getting the same words how little that he had before Halloween bring it back and make it more positive or give the Lord a shout in the house oh praise God praise God praise God hallelujah praise be oh my I want to tell you don't be discouraged this morning the Holy Spirit is with you looking over you isn't that right thank you Jesus all right let's go but a Balaam says and I want to tie into what Isaac preached but Isaac reached but Satan mixed appealing his shows and so on it's appealing citizens appealing but the enemy keeps finding a better bait so Satan another kid improving his tactics but but he had a strip off a little more don't worry and so forth right okay but what God doesn't have to do anymore to his God does not sir make it was more prettier he had to go out to make it dim with tinsel and so on no there what happen here he doesn't have to make do anything more to his to make it more appealing the only thing he has to do is the reason a standard of his own word against the enemy and the Bible says when the enemy come like a flood the Spirit of God or I call it raises the standard what does he do he makes the word that he already said more positive [Applause] so that's why Jesus come and tell them these are the words come to make it more positive to you because I want to give you an absolute sake I guarantee that this promise of the Father it is guaranteed behold I send the promise of my father upon you it is guaranteed somewhere the reason standard in your spirit in your life then he breathed upon receiving the Holy Ghost the breath of God was upon them they were living under the Norrington anointing of promise I'm nineteen of dynamics I'm going to receive Oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise God praise this wonderful name hallelujah do believe that so what Quran says he takes the word that he already said and make it more positive hallelujah not not not not new words not not new mysteries same ones he was telling them all along you come to make it more real to them the Bible Senate last days people have itching ears to hear new stuff the tickle in the ears that they wanna live nothing I know just out of here they like that here and right and here and here the more I hear the more they feel good about what it you see but this is not that Jesus was talking to them there wasn't catching a lot of stuff he was telling them that because it didn't have revelation you see revelation gives you a certain behavior I don't care what country you're from what language you speak revelation comes from God not on what you read and study that's your study but when it's revealed Oh spring stimulation it brings excitement it brings real expectation isn't that right so brother Branham says and you know the Bible says when the enemy come on like a flood the Spirit of God will raise up a standard and when God here we go when God gives his church a blessing and they move along with that blessing Sulu until it become common to the world then they begin to run it down then the Spirit of God comes in and raise up a standard again and there's a brick and fort or revival or something the message going slow slow coach look who's everybody forget it right and the righteous and into everything and whether when I'm see I'm what about I'm see but it's not revival be comfortable in the comfort zone and so on but afterwards God want a reason standard a revival freaks out isn't that right and we have a promise he said what we see happen should put every soul in action it should make a church that would make a revival that people be flying in from Europe to see what's taking place not here to see they will see it as a place in Arizona called Maricopa Valley a city called Phoenix there is something broke out here that the seven thunders of Revelation 10 that's not even Lord is being manifested in other words that got to come an hour when we could say this is that that the Prophet Balaam Branum speaker praise God not the bunch of churches all around no not that no dis prophesy here these are the words Oh hallelujah these are the words you have to connect with these are the words Oh hallelujah praise God praise God so he continued know the Angels has gathered up the loose ends and we are here he was about to write those tenders he said I don't like them seal him up and at the day of song in of his last seven angels to change what the mystery of God all about God how God is but one God all these things will be finished at that time the great battles back before had got these loose ends hanging out it ought to be wrapped up together in this age so before the thunders could all the loose ends have to be tied up before you could get your portion the loose ends in your life have to be tied up isn't that right so brother sister we are the endtime let the Holy Spirit influence us to the Word of God let God do the influencing in our hearts and not be influenced by others but Isaac said a powerful thing that people could get desensitized to the Holy Spirit or the Holy Spirit what bring conviction Holy Spirit will bring you're wrong you should change the attitudinal wings and I told him in Paris what about and say I rather somebody wrong and their doctrine and right in their spirit that's somebody right in the doctrine unroll in your spirit when somebody right in their spirit they could be corrected when somebody wrong in your spirit that's terrible you can tell them my power because they're right in the doctrine they may be right go please say this or this but you're wrong in your spirit oh ha that's a religious spirit that's a demon actually Oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord so watch let the Holy Spirit influence us to the Word of God and let God do the influence in your hearts and not be influenced by others this ought to put us in action with reverence and humility the telephonically among us again in the last days he will pour out his spirit do you believe that do you believe this is your promise how many believe this is your promise that you are promised the spirit upon your life Oh glory to God amen but if I know his brain Lord confirm it right now this is from the indictment while I'm before your throne take every one of these people Lord take the world out of us take me lord while we are here in your presence just take the world wring your hearts God right now pull the world and the kids of the world away from us let us be consecrated Christians Oh God to be loving and kind and sweet bearing the fruit of the Spirit won't you Lord we are before your throne sinners left a crimson stain on every one of us but your blood can remitted Lord make it white as snow granted while we are waiting upon you take us we are yours consecrated our lives to you in Jesus name granted Lord the each one of us wring my heart I see all my errors you are not here to see somebody else errors you are here to see what problems you have everybody is out of here if you fix up you don't have to come here you don't always see people come in here people have needs come in here people looking for deliverance they come here people looking for bricks you and help they come here hallelujah people don't know what to do they come here to praise God you're not coming here before you're right you're coming here because you're wrong and you need a breakthrough you not come here because it is nice not nice and you look ever go to intervene looking for Supernatural breakthrough then you're in the right place Oh hallelujah come here to find fault no no no you're coming deliverance Oh blessed be the name of the Lord you're not coming here to see who where what that's none of your business mind your own business you're coming to fight for your portion to fight for your soul Oh glory to God hallelujah thank you Jesus brings God butter bread and ring my hat Lord I see all my errors I see my mistakes God from this time I'm trying to live the best that I can oh I want to go I want to conjugate my life on you to you across here this morning after bringing this indictment against my clergyman friends over there enough to say these hard things Lord I did it by your inspiration I feel you told me to do it no it's off my shoulders I'm glad is off let them do with it whatever they will father I pray they will accept it I pray it would save everyone Lord may their comfort a revival of the just prophecy prophecy and prayer may they come forth a revival of the just and a great power come among the churches just before it is going it is not too hard to pray that because you promised it and we are looking Lord for that that we know will do great things in our myths or get the Lord a sure it's not you have to prayer because he promised it and if he promised the clock can't lie or get the Lord a shout [Applause] hallelujah do you love that coat Mira convert a revival of the just who is the - just that justified grenier me you are justified as if you never that's in so who want to say a sinner let us forget them them talking foolishness who got justify who who could condemn who gorgeous righteous is righteous [Applause] halleluyah halleluyah [Applause] hallelujah that means for you to be justified you have to get a revelation that your name is on the book [Applause] that means you have to get a revelation tell him before there was a moon before there was a stop before there was a molecule before there was a beginning before the beginning you were there or give the Lord a shout Oh hallelujah praise God praise God praise God [Applause] hallelujah glory glory glory this morning when a Stephen sent me this this morning scripture and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses from all sin and there's a good woman in the wings of over snow I dove did you know a real Christian doesn't have any sin imputed to him David said blessed is the man whom God will not impute sin to when you are washed in the blood of the Lamb not by make-believe but really the blood of the Lamb God does not impute to you anything that's done because you are under the blood and he doesn't see it there is a blood sacrifice the only thing he can see you in is the way he saw you before the foundation of the world when he put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life that is all he can look at because you are redeemed from everything that was ever done you are washed in the blood of the Lamb therefore there is no girl in you there is no unclean habit in you because that the blood of the Lamb have did this and God tell it impute sin to you after you got sin offering laying waiting for you Oh hallelujah well you say brother branham I can do what I want - I always do always but when a man can't really see what Jesus done for him and tunnel and be from the contrary to him it shows he never received Christ or give the Lord a shout do you love him this morning Oh bless attacker better Steven hallelujah praise the Living God hallelujah praise God praise Jesus so that is why brother Branham says watch watch this John was weeping because no man was found worthy to take the book John and tears he wasn't happy he was among hallelujah glory glory I know the book and I was in that book hallelujah his name is in that book yo your name is the word hallelujah you are part of that book so he won that book to be released so that he could go back on the earth praise God the caught up in that dimension but did not come back on the earth until that book is unfolded so John is correctly weeping he is crying a man filled with the Holy Ghost he is weeping because no man was found worthy to take the book but notice discovery read when the lamb took the book Oh John behavior change all in heaven all under the earth so therefore your worship will express to me express to us whether you have any revelation so when this is a very quiet the cow worship they're looking to look in the look and they know something is wrong because once you get a revelation that your name is on the book you have to behave the same way John behaved because there was only one Lord there's only one spirit there's only one baptism and there was only one behavior when you're living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit there is only one behavior just like Mary near perumal just like pina Peru [Applause] this is a very important service this will separate seed from shock because seed gets in Revelation the Warnie Upper Room and if you can't worship you have no revelation because God is not coming down on dry one's not coming on top your head on top your memory end up in intellect God is coming on hats praise God that's why training up Aroon gotta understand them the Lord is God and He is calling me worship everything worship worship just worship the four beasts worship all under any upper room and they were praising God continually before the dynamic sale that was gonna be an old pawn of the spirit but before that come you have to break into Revelation fine [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah the devil does nothing to do the woman cell worship jesus said it is not fit the deterrence bread and classes of dogs sister worship you can't stop a believer oh my god I feel like pants and this more you cannot stop a believer : [Applause] [Applause] you know what this is yes is the Jubilee of the Seventh Seal or chlorine of God yeah breakin into the Jubilee put a Brenham said the church will leave you a shout him not morning [Applause] look nearer my God to thee not no solemn no believing a shout [Applause] [Music] my god it looked like somebody sitting in they look like some Gladys he is them they look like some sister see their name [Applause] you'll never see that praise God praise God [Applause] we're balanced said luminously capping a revival I love what God did so then when people run after some man the man however as a man they love the chose and whatnot they figure he is in Manatee or whatever that's the business he said that be revival has to come from the people so somehow this vision of God has to be transferred to you the people know no reason that God the church fell in the beginning the reason it fell is because the people takes the spirit and put it on a man and God say I did it [Applause] God said that the Prophet said God has a core of the audience you shall be my people and I shall be your God [Applause] he's a jealous God so when man played for that is trouble have no other gods before me I have a lot I got hello you have no other gods before me or Jesus I feel the presence of God in this model that is an area smaller began to move this church gonna change Chile not gonna change the world gonna change the mess is gonna change but not same never fire not kidding amongst a man began to move among the people watch what God wanna do [Applause] nobody want to join that church you know Papa said the Lord added to the church such as would be saved no man just tried to join to them or God wanted that judge clean what was in that judge pure don't wanna check on a standard but the devil will destroy it see friend big shots fine and is that a complain too much unknown Squire quite a bit quiet quiet alacrity noise you know

Cooley Holley and you don't want to offend the doc and then they start again special seats the special people and then they have you can gene who come if you selected and given special seats because who the person is cause no respecter of persons just like a backside because in God's sight we are sons and daughters I'm a son behind here you are son dear we are the same we are sons and daughters I'm in a position to speak the word because I was God called me to do you are not I am in this position you are here to worship you're gonna say Amen because if your name is here every word you say [Applause] don't want you keep that for yourself what wanna say Amen hallelujah glory to God open your mouth I'll get the law some praises right now [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I see a seed being anointed 1/7 underfed being anointed the pushpa dynamics to push for charity the push for the Holy Ghost will be seated but Abraham Kenan does not represent the age of the millennium it represents the age of the overcomer the dispensation of overcoming because in Canaan the killin Boonen took cities so this is a cross over Jordan and everything is wonderful no sorry it's not like

got to want to get to but this is where the inspiration from Daniels hidden seven thunders and forbidden and John heard the voices and this book was sealed and the back of book was sea with seven seals but in the days of these seals to be open the mystery of God would be finished in other words God would be known with Church not in three people but as one person the mystery of God will be revealed and when that was completely revealed then the seven mysteries which is sometimes talked about will be open to the church because in there the church would be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him moving in and out showing him signs of been alive a mullah that's a promise to be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and Christ moving in and out he could do a miracle today a healing today a deliverance today he moves in he move out he restore backside as a day somebody got caught in the runs today he's moved in he's moved out get moving in but you're living under the inspiration that's where we are right now living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit create an atmosphere God cannot come and dry that's why they were in the upper room creates an atmosphere praising and blessing what continually yes you have challenges don't let that stop the breezes or chlorine of God your problems don't let that stop your praises when you come here you come here to

thunders uttered the voices he grabbed his pen to write he said don't write it don't write it John's for the same thing it has already been written outside of the Bible had seven seas in the back of the book no man can open those seals that Muslim voices so the seals and the back of the book was voices so you couldn't see the voices but the voices were what reveal what's inside the book what hide the forces out of there so we're on take several seats on the back and put it under the seven seal on the inside to make sure yes seven seals not 14 seals if we didn't do that we'll be 14 scenes same on the back said money inside but the voices on the back he call it voices the books were secret voices seven voices could've gone further no matter what it was but the Bible said and told Daniel and John that in the last days these seven voices would be known by the real true church so if that is so then the real true church must have King LA worship [Applause] if it's revealed to you can stop

you you're not a son of God he give up on that then he had to try a different tactic altogether because the mind is clear who you are there might be a weak son but you're still a son might be a struggling son but you're still a son you might be a battling son but you're still a son he can change that you'd ever catching that so you are accessing your father that's why I'm an angel there we go here we go this is big when the ins I can know when to pop open seven thunders try the voices out the voice in version 10 it says go to the engine you can't go if you don't know who you are and what you're going for you got the engineer watching Ellen ball I'm a greenback God you know what I here for because that book is so important classic book that Adam had lost that's the book what the names are called all sons God would only call by his word so the word was in the book the book I'm lost the book the book went back in the hands of original owner and Jesus Christ came back down as the book version 10 the book was there open though the book is being placed in sons to call the reception's sons calling sons [Applause] so he said as my father sent me so said not you the father that was sent him was in him or give the Lord a shout PC what what about to do to you he's about the tabernacle himself inside of you you are bought to become a house for God you become about to come at embers of God you become the Church of God you yourself [Applause] let me see that Christianity versus idolatry but a burnable no idolatry is a strange thing don't do the ages we've had it ever since the beginning of time now the order for this idol worship is the man sets up the idol fixes the idol then it goes in and prepares himself for this great worship now he believes this idol is made in the image of some God that he doesn't never seen he's without form so he believes he's in an image of this idol that he mixed it as God no don't let that leave you support a banana is bringing a point he said now the image is in the image image of the mythical God that he believes that is then it goes before the either prostrates himself and believes that the god that's unseen person comes down into this Idol and we believe that he talks to God to decide on that God brings himself into the idol and answers him back now many of you teachers here that took the mythology even those gods they had battles with one another they claim now in other words the God hypnotizes himself from this supernatural standing and then his idol speaks back to the worship but surely either and the worshiper in some kind of built up emotional sense believes that the idol speaks to him to his heart and he's forgiven of his sins whatever more which surely shows is the devil is the devil that does it listen is noted or just haphazardly do things these worshippers of idols some of them does but there's real true worshipers of those things for instance listen I could tell you stories of how those Devils in those ideas perform all kind of things make blood come out of things and everything else they were Sadie stone weeping virgin mary repin on these demons devils that they worship in making these things happen watch they are Devils were on Sonya now if you don't believe there's a real devil then you don't believe there's a god sure you've got to believe the contrary that there's a real devil and he's a person not a thought not a thought he is a person Nadia the teaching goes on that the devil just are either torture yet no it isn't the devil is a person the same people believes that the Holy Ghost is got a good torture get but to believe that the Holy Ghost is a missile it is the person of Christ and spirit for all the people saying that the Holy Ghost they off that is just that is just contrary teachings the Holy Ghost is the person of Christ in spirit form now let's go ahead and further now now these idolaters prostrating themselves for the idol believe that the God they are worshiping is represented in this Idol no you have no you got that the worshiper is not a hypocrite sis deep he is actually getting a hole or something that is in that Idol because it come back on him he does something and gets it from that Idol which is a myth God not a real one so they will have testimonies of what that Idol does to them and what they worship and does to them I want to church just for them they have answers they have witness they have confirmation they have all of that but it's Devils and many times have you are you ready the devil gets into those things and the devil get intermittence some time and impersonates himself as God I have seen this in my ministry now this is very deeper this is not skin look he said stay where the teaching has been taught here stay with this word don't you leave it you stay right with the word no matter what comes what goes stay with the world people say come to the altar with nine teachers blind teachers say just oh forget everything make a mind blank you'll become an Elijah you become this that the other what a lie that's open up your soul to all kind of devil spirits that get in don't do that you must remember there is a devil impersonate Christ to the letter almost so just because we can be emotional don't mean we are saved because we go to church don't mean we are saved aha that's a big one that's a big one when the church doesn't mean people said I see people in this message Christians support so-called Christians being so badly it's really disappointment really disappointed they want to know if these people are saved some of them don't even know that were sinners you know they they drop down Pino from heaven I'm satellite was it bring them down until the fall they in the pride and arrogance one is self-righteousness okay let's go on now because we got a church on me we are saved don't believe those enticing spirits a real Spirit of God a real Word of God is the truth of God which is the seed of God we will produce God in your life you'll be godly simply holy it's continued among a lot of people we find my emotions and so forth they become catalysts backbiting all kind of ungodly things but that is sulfuric acid in the church it is demon powers spirit of men and women who get among one another and try to push off and say this one is not right this one is not right that is not right and if you chase it down nine times out of ten is the very person making that still that's not right God hates discord among brethren be reverent be holy love God stand by him and as long as you know your life is giving up with the Bible with the purity of heart beauty of thought love towards your brother trying to have Bester up till the kingdom of God doing those things dressing right living right talking right who in the right places then you can have all the emotions you want and everybody will believe it anti seeing spirits going forth demons under disguises look we in the last days is the end time false spirits come in and begin to tell people this and the other we are broke up in the 900 different nominations every one with different view we say they say we believe this period that's what we believe they can't let the Holy Spirit come in they can't have the right of way Gore got a bunch of people that can shout then everybody had to shout they got some to speak in tongues then everybody had to speak in tongues they got all like this till they become what absolutely listen contaminated with enticing spirits in Tyson's people to do these emotions when there is a know coordinate and all then they go and live any kind of life that is either live and call it Christian oh praise the name of the Lord so I say this because the correctly worship God you have to get rid of the religious spirits and the enticing spirits is that bushin going a bunch of noise and hallelujah glory raise your hands you have to be able to follow through with the word the worship God in spirit and in truth all come you get a lot some praises people say it not just the noise it's not just the shout it's not just a hallelujah it's breaking free from all the religious demons praise God

here this build on the blood sweat and tears and prayers and labor is that magic is it just happen just like that it's a process that's we'll be talking about you could have gravely kind of concrete that seemeth not suitable in has to be formed and therefore all this world yes not the image has to be formed in you has to be built in you have to be more than you has to be shaped in you so Balaam said the land was depleted by inspiration praise God I'm gonna go further the be held in homestretch now we are born of the Spirit of God and received the Holy Ghost and cry Abba Father we are children but we can't get anywhere we can't whipped the Philistines why because people trying to take one on a position to tell somebody do this do this do this and do this if frame don't want to stay one em go over here we find - over there say oh my the Lord gives me a good cornfield and then somebody come and see where I could plant corn - but the ground you harvest is fresh it's for sheep that land don't even go corn good so you're like - a corn field in you look at this if I come back onto just point blank on the plant call I make up a book on I can't call in a picnic on one green any corn waste your time with the bidding in a fight because it's called a real prosper starting but his land is different God put grass for you your shiva's had a pick up the grass like that so and you just rearing sheep and Boren say wait what destiny is a position so why you want to be in a position and then you can Horace my MIDI president America he wanted the position I wonder how we feel in them

to you ain't got nothing to do with corn get oats is your patter is you ain't supposed to herd sheep when you're supposed to hit cattle God wants to place the church but every one of them warns to do the same thing so when you understand that you begin to feel comfortable and the castle of your skin in the calling that God has called you on to and nobody give you a fight with your blessings hallelujah you don't care what they get blessed with that is not yours you're looking the one to give your revelation but this one did someone on more education than me this one how hard on me the big

tell them devil goo teenager but but but but but but but Jake are behave not that but but you know one excuse the church here we go we're home - the church is supposed to be predestinated unto adoption of children where God can take a man here we go and adopt him in the family and give him something okay you understand that a doctor man give him something what are we supposed to do try first try that and see if it is right so it can be do ask no question you're questioning me gotta believe it believe what it in this time yeah I want to know what you have no hide it bring it we had
