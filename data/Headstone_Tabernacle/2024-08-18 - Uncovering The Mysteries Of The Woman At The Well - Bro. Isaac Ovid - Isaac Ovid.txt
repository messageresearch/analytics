atmosphere is right this morning for anything to happen do you believe that keep playing softly let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you this morning to be able to gather one more time in your presence Lord we are so grateful to have the opportunity to come to you to Lord to bring our sacrifices of praise and worship into the house of the Lord and Lord both those that are gathered here physically in the house and those that are connected on the internet and those that would hear the tape father May Lord you get Glory and Honor in the service today Lord may you touch our hearts Our lives our bodies Lord our situations our challenges our issues father Lord the enemy knows that time is short and we have seen an intensifying of the attack but this is what we were trained to expect this is what we were born to address this is what we were commissioned to deal with so we are unfazed Lord by what the enemy is doing in this hour because as the last Lord the last group of people for the last great kill as your Prophet said we stand ready father knowing that the host of angels are behind us Lord when Elijah stood on the earth he told his servant go look again and when he said open up this boy's eyes he said they are more for us than against us so this morning we stand with the assurance that they are more for us than against us father may you bless the word may you bless the reading of the word may you open our understanding to the scriptures may you take me out of the way may you touch Lord our pastor this morning touch him in his body from the crown of his head to the SS of his feet Lord may you heal him completely take away the discomfort and the pain May the anointing even the shikina glory even the August presence drop upon him even now Lord may you touch my wife also father from the crown of her head to the souls of her feet father Lord may she be completely healed and restored Lord there are so many situations in the church Lord not just in this local church but all around the world father the enemy is trying all he could do but we say House of hell you have no power house of Hell give weight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we know in whom we believe we understand in whom we believe this morning so father may you get Glory and Honor to your Holy Name may you bless the service today here lord and there are so many services around the world where the word is being preached in power and demonstration where word and spirit is coming together where the true worshippers are worshiping in spirit and in truth father may be you may you be with your body of Believers father Lord we know that the time is close at hand even so come Lord Jesus so father if there's anyone sick in our midst may you heal them anyone Desiring the baptism of the Holy ghost may they be filled anyone Lord down distressed this whatever it might be father may we Lord lead it all aside and may you walk through the church this morning may you walk through the pews this morning may you walk father from even us through the internet into the homes where this service is being broadcast and Lord may they feel Lord the presence of the Holy Ghost where they might be may you take me out of the way may you touch my body may you touch me a fresh may you use me as your mic phone in the mighty glorious name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah so certainly good to be back in the house of the Lord and certainly grateful for your prayers for your support for the encouragement and if you have your Bibles let's just turn to two portions of scripture so that we can take our seats reading from Isaiah 49 reading from verse one amen blessed be the name of the Lord Isaiah 49 and also reading from St John 4 and this is a powerful scripture in Isaiah just a kind of lay a foundation for a few things we'll touch Isaiah 49:1 listen o Isles that's that's Islands that's Beyond the Seas listen oh Al unto me and hearken ye people from afar so this is Isaiah speaking and he's not speaking to those within close proximity he's speaking to those that are not within the sound of his voice he is speaking I dare say to us this morning listen oh is unto me and hearken you people from far the Lord had called me from the womb from the bowels of my mother had he made mention of my name and he had made my mouth like a sharp sword you know the word is sharper than any two it sword in the shadow of his hand had he hid me and made me a polished shaft in his quiver had he hid me and said unto me thou art my servant o Israel in whom I will be glorified then I said I have labored in vain I have spent my strength for not and in vain yet surely my judgment is with the Lord and my work with my God and now say the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob unto him which is a Ministry of reconciliation Redemption though Israel be not gathered so he's speaking to the fact that Israel is scattered though Israel be not gathered though Israel be not together though Israel be not in one place yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord and my God shall be my strength so Isaiah is speaking but it's really the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ is identifying here right and he said it is a light thing that thou should as be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob so this is not Isaiah can't raise up the tribes of Jacob but this is the ministry of Jesus Christ and to restore the preserved of Israel so there's a preserved of Israel and I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the Earth and let's go to St John 4 and we're going to read from verse one when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John though Jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left Judea and departed again into Galilee and he must needs go through Samaria then cometh he to a city of Samaria which is called SAA near to the pel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph and Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being Wei with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord hallelujah glor everybody feeling fine amen happy to be in the presence of the Lord in such a time as this Hallelujah when the lid of hell is open and streams of demon powers are loosed on the earth to try to stop this bride from coming to Perfection but we know that nothing could stop this bride from coming to Perfection we know that nothing could stop you from ful fulfilling your purpose we know that no weapon that is even formed against you could Prosper we know that the steps of the righteous are ordered by God we know that my help coming from the Lord we know that the present trials and the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us we come into the house of God with Thanksgiving and singing and worship knowing that God is more than able to do what he said he would do we come to push back on enemy we come that like talk about if you don't have any teeth you use your gum to fight the enemy but nothing going to stop you from doing all you could do for the glory of God and there's a plan there's a great plan and a purpose for us being here this morning you feel that way this morning so I have a title this morning Hallelujah uncovering the mysteries of the woman at the well uncovering the mysteries of the woman at the well and a subject and unlike L bridge between the Jews and the Gentiles and an inspiration the unfolding Plan of Redemption so I'm going to take my time this morning good to be back into the seat I'm going to take my time get my rhythm this morning and we'll see what the Lord will do but I know but the Clarence the devil is in trouble Satan is mad because the B the B said once the bride gets to know who she is then it's it's finished and everything that the enemy is doing is try to get you to not see who you are because the moment you understand who you are and see it by divine revelation then you understand the authority that's locked up in you because Authority is ours power belongs to God God gives power to those with the authority and when power and authority comes together then the sick cannot stay sick the dead cannot stay dead those that don't know can stay in ignorance because he comes to those that are in ignorant he'll come in the middle of your marriage he'll come in the middle of your home he'll come in the middle of your life can the ch say Amen so I want to just build a foundation so we know that everything leading up to this time has been this great Plan of Redemption and that's why the inspiration is the unfolding Plan of Redemption because when man fell God told himself I'm not going to leave it this way and we know the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so Redemption was already in motion before man was even here Redemption was in the thoughts of God you were in the thoughts of God before you even born you were in the thoughts of God uh in the middle of your trial you were in the thoughts of God God is not now thinking about you in the middle of your trial he thought about you before you even had a trial he thought about you before you even had a situation he thought about you before you had no money he thought about you before you had a headache he thought about you before you were sick he thought about you before you were depressed can the church say Amen Plan of Redemption and every Apostle every Prophet every King every single piece of this great plan that started in Genesis was leading up to something can the church say Amen in the message identification brother Bram said and when he seen that his creation had fallen Hallelujah now his own loving character this is the character of God molded himself into the person of Christ his nature expressed itself his character expressed itself he couldn't help himself because it was who he was he was love he was Mercy he is love he is Mercy he is redemption he is healing the very definition of God is love so he couldn't help himself his character had no choice but to express itself in the man Christ Hallelujah brother Bram goes on no one could ever do that but God this was done so he could pay the penalty of the fall of his creation brother brandham goes and he said there must be something to save this creation and nothing could save it listen because the highest species of his creation had fallen in other words when man fell this was the highest species hallu hallu this was the highest species that God had created and but Bram said and everything under it fell with it because it fell there's only one thing left that did not fall listen to the listen to The Prophet now and that was God so brother Bram said when man fell he tued down the entire thing with him because he was the highest point of God's creation in other words when God created Man In His Image he was more important than the sun the Stars the Earth he was more important than the trees and nature no wonder the whole creation is groaning the whole of creation not part of creation come on now he said the whole of creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God because when man fell the entire of creation was broken and mother Bram said only one thing did not fall and that was the Lord himself so the only way for Redemption to come was for the Lord himself to get involved in his creation you don't hear me this morning oh Hallelujah I'm building something something this is the prophet's word now there's only one thing left that did not fall and that was God the heavens so something of the heavens had to come down to redeem this creation because there was nothing here that could create it nothing you could do could ever redeem yourself your best efforts could not save yourself your best idea cannot save yourself but when God saw this and some man had fallen saw the trees Fallen saw the animals Fallen saw sickness coming saw death coming the Lord himself said I got to fix the problem because he was the only one that wasn't Fallen I want you to remember Angels fell also Angels left their estate so Angels themselves were subject to a spirit of falling but the only thing that could never fall is the Lord himself so it had to take the Lord himself to unfold for himself I want you to catch that unfold for himself The Plan of Redemption can I go on a bit are you with me this morning can you help me preach this morning the Lord is not going to trust anybody else with his Plan of Redemption he is taking personal responsibility for the Plan of Redemption he is taking personal responsibility for every name on the book he is taking personal responsibility once your name is on the book he is looking for you once your name is on the book he is coming for you once your name is on the book he he's going to deliver you somebody preached back to me this morning he's not leaving that to the preacher he's not even leaving it to a prophet he's not even leaving it to a messenger he is taking personal responsibility for Redemption Hallelujah I'm not talking about preaching I'm talking about Redemption I'm talking about bringing you back to Eden bringing you back to Authority bringing you back to Power that's not my job it's not your pastor's job the Lord himself is taking personal responsibility for Redemption it's his plan it's his plan it's his plan and he's not trusting his plan with anybody you don't hear me this morning can the Church Say Amen [Music] Hallelujah don't worry about your son if her name is on the book God is taking personal responsibility oh don't worry about them don't worry about your daughter don't worry about your husband don't worry about your wife don't worry about your situation he is taking personal responsibility he's not leaving it to an angel he's not leaving it to a preacher he's not even leaving it to the fold Ministry we're talking about Redemption I'm not talking about salvation I'm talking about Redemption he is the only one who knows the inside inside of the Plan of Redemption Redemption by Blood Redemption by power Redemption by fire redeeming you bringing you back hallelujah hallelujah anybody in the house this [Applause] morning but over told me to take my time I want to take my time but we're going to leave here with the George with a knockout punch with the Enemy because let not get ahead of myself you may be seated for a moment so something of the heavens had to come down to redeem this creation because there was nothing here in this terrestrial Dimension that could solve the problem natural solutions cannot solve spiritual problems and God's Own love for the World created the character that was expressed in Christ he was God's character he was God's expressed image in him was God God in Christ revealing himself to the world and no love could ever be greater than that love that such a person would become what he did in order to redeem what had been lost can we go on in the unveiling of God we're going to talk a little bit read some quotes do a little bible study we in church on Sunday is the Lord's day notice there sometime I say I'm going not going to be too long with you but brother Clarence you notice I didn't do that we're going to take our time this morning in the UN of God the prophet said and when Jesus came he was the word in its fullness because the whole plan I want you to underline those words in your mind the whole Plan of Redemption laid in him the whole plan not a piece of the plan the whole Plan of Redemption didn't lay in Moses so in other words Moses only had a measure of the portion of the plan that God allowed him to see and he couldn't see anything more because it was the unfolding of a plan brother brandham goes on the whole Plan of Redemption didn't lay in Moses didn't lay in Joseph didn't lay in Elijah see they were only part of the word pointing to it see now notice keep your thought here it comes as I say see the whole plan wasn't in them they were pointing to it so now I want to get to this scripture that we read in St John and we're going to do a little bible study a little bit if that's okay with you and see some things in here that we would have seen but maybe we want to take a next look at it so St John 4 finds it at a very interesting point in scripture now the Book of John is unique it doesn't bring out the G genealogy like the Book of Matthew and this one beg got this one and this one beg this one John starts off simply with a declaration in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God he he get straight he just punching right away out of out the gate there's no buildup there's no there's no warmer period with John John just goes straight for it in the beginning was the word if you didn't know and the Word was with God and the Word was God GL he goes down to verse 11 he came into his own and his own receive him not he he actually is speaking what is happening and coming to conclusions right away everybody with me so by the time we get to St John 4 a few things would have happened Jesus would have been baptized by John in fact John picks it up he would have gone through the Wilderness he would have called a few of his disciples and in St John 2 is where they he would have gone to the wedding in canaa which was Jesus first miracle everybody with me right so John 2 is wedding in Kaa first miracle John 3 is Jesus almost is the first big aspect of doctrine that we could preach because this is when Nicodemus come to him and say how what what what what what can a man do and Jesus bring out you must be born again everybody with me Jesus would have cleansed the temple and he is now baptizing and because of what's happening with the baptism and the Pharisees here Jesus starts to make a move and it would seem as if he's getting away from the Pharisees can the church say amen amen so the Bible said he departs to Galilee and I want to just kind of honing on these scriptures here verse four and he must needs go through Samaria now when you read that one verse it kind of if you don't already understand what happening here you could just see this scripture as just okay going through Samaria but I want us to focus a little bit on this thing one in all of spiritual history and scriptural documentation Matthew Mark Luke and John Jesus only went to Samaria twice so it was not as if it's a normal Journey for Jesus it's only twice he went the first time he went which was actually before this captured in another book was when he passed through Samaria on the way to Jerusalem and they wanted to get rid of him and they say can we call for fire and burn them up anybody remember that and Jesus say you don't even know what Spirit you of just go your way just keep walking but the Clarance at this day and time no Jew goes to Samaria if you wanted to go from Judea to Galilee you avoided Samaria Samaria was a no-o zone no true Jew Blackman would would decide to go through Samaria so there's a secret hidden inside of this thing because at that day there there was animosity between the Jews and the Samaritans amen am amen amen anybody with me so when Jesus decides to go through Samaria and the Bible said and he cometh he to a city of Samaria which is called SAA near to the pastel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph now Jacob Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being wared with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the 6 hour Jesus would would have been one of the few Jews brother Anthony who would have gone into Samaria for a very long time I want us to settle on this for a little bit so Jesus is going against Jewish tradition to even enter Samaria forget what he about to do just the entrance into that place alone is breaking the pattern of day Samaria a place rich in history a place that was known for its battles for its covenants for its Wars for the history that was written and Rewritten Samaria is critical in the economy of God and for centuries Jews said I'm not go if the service in Samaria I'm not going and it's not just that the Jews felt that way the Samaritans also felt that way we don't want any Jews here anybody with me this morning so I just want to bring a little history so we understand the context because it's important when we get to the conversation with the woman at the well you could ask the question how did Samaria even become significant a little bit of History it was in Samaria at sheim in Samaria that Abraham was given the Covenant and Abraham in Genesis 12 passed through the land onto the place sheam onto the plane of morah and and the Lord appeared unto Abraham and said unto thy seed will I give this land this was a land of promise and Jews were not welcome in this land anybody with me this morning it was in this land that Abraham would have walked and would have meditated and talk to God in this land Jacob settled in this land can the church say Amen not only did Jacob settle here and live here but Jacob built a well in this land this land of Samaria Jacob had spent time and built a well and he and the Bible said he gave a piece of his land to his son Joseph that's rich history that's gathered in this land of Samaria by n sheim anybody with me this morning it'll get important in a minute it was in this same place the Bible said in Joshua 24 and Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to sheam and it was in this same place he said choose you this day whom you will serve and the Covenant between God and the children of Israel was reestablished right there and in this place for centuries but the Thompson a Jew was not welcome to this place can the church say amen and Friends it was not always this way it was on Mount jerim which is in the epicenter almost of Samaria near to Jacob's Well that Moses in Deuteronomy said let the blessings be pronounced from Mount jerim it was on Mount jerim in Samaria by sheam by the the The Well of Jacob that the Samaritans build their own Temple huj and say this is where we will worship Hallelujah why will we worship here because God spoke to Abraham here and Joshua reestablish the Covenant here they had Rich history there can the Church Say Amen amen we're going to get to something in a minute but why is it that Jews were not welcome in Samaria well for two reasons I touch this a few times in different messages we know that under David the Kingdom of Israel was all United was one under Solomon they were all one but after Solomon died because of Solomon's idolatry which brother Branham traced all the way back to balam and to Moab because B Bram said the seed of idolatry was sown there so bam tied the Samaritans all the way back to balam and to the king of Moab I'll read the quote for you everybody with me but let's build here so the children of Israel they are one people and under the rule of David they are one under the rule of Solomon they are one and when Solomon dies there's a split political iCal discontent spiritual Decline and God turned away from Solomon his son is King and his son imposes taxes we preached this before and because of the tax 10 tribes decide to say we are breaking away amen and they formed the northern kingdom so to the north is 10 tribes and to the South is the kingdom of Judah with the tribe of Judah The Tribe of Benjamin and all other 10 tribes are in the north but the brandham said the seed of idolatry which was sown by Moab and balam was carried through into the northern kingdom can the church say Amen so they have you have the kings of Judah and the Kings of Israel and most time in scripture the king of Judah the king of Israel the prophet of Israel the prophet of Judah back and forth throughout spiritual history can the church say amen amen but over time and if you read it Israel always had the worst lot of Kings Israel was known for being much worse than Judah Judah had their own isue but God reached a point where he was fed up of what was happening in the northern kingdom and if you go down to 2 Kings 17 everybody with me yes sir 2 Kings 17 in the 12th year of ahaz king of Judah began HOSA the son of elah to reign in Samaria over Israel so the capital of of Israel is Samaria and King HOSA is the last king of Israel the last king of Israel King hos became king because he assassinated the last king Israel was in is a lot of trouble and during his period here verse two and he did with that which was evil in the sight of the Lord but not as the Kings of Israel that were before him against him came up shal manzar King of Assyria and HOSA became his servant and gave him presence and the king of Assyria found conspiracy in HOSA for he had sent Messengers to so the king of Egypt and brought no present to the king of Assyria as he had done year by year therefore the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison so I want you to see what's happening here this is we are watching here the end of the Kingdom of Israel after this Israel as a kingdom the northern kingdom ceases to exist you know what it is to be the leader of the collapse of of the Kingdom this is King HOSA after this Israel as a as a kingdom the northern kingdom doesn't exist anymore only Judah would have existed for about 10 something years afterwards before the Babylonians would have taken him up but this was by no accident I want to to see the unfolding of this for a few minutes then the king of Assyria verse 5 came up throughout all the land and went up to Samaria and besiege it three years and in the ninth year of HOSA the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away deported them away into Assyria and placed them in Hala and in Habor by the river of gozan and in the cities of the mes and so it was that the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt and had feared other gods and walked in the statutes of the Heathen whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel and of the king of Israel which they had made and the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the Lord their God and they built them high places in all their cities from the Tower of the Watchmen to the fence City and they set them up images and Groves in every high hill and under every Green Tree and there they burnt incense in all the high places as did the Heathen whom the Lord carried away before them and wrought wicked things to provoke the Lord to anger for they ser Idols whereof the Lord had said unto them ye shall not do this thing amen yet the Lord testified against Israel and against Judah by all the prophets and by all the sear saying Turn ye from your evil ways and keep my Commandments and my statutes according to all the law which I commanded your fathers and which I sent to you by my Servants of prophets not withstanding they would not hear but Harden their necks like to the necks of their fathers that did not believe in the Lord their God and they rejected his statutes and his Covenant that he made with their fathers and his testimonies which he testified against them and they followed vanity and became Vain and went after the Heathen and were round about them concerning whom the Lord had charged them that they should not do like them and they left all the Commandments of the Lord their God and made them molten images even two calves and made a Grove and worship all the hosts of heaven and serve Bal and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire and use divination and enchantments and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to anger therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight amen there was none left but the tribe of Judah only also Judah kept not the Commandments of the Lord their God but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made and the Lord rejected all the seed of Israel and Afflicted them and delivered them into the hands of spoilers until he cast them out of his sight yes for he rent Israel from the House of David and they made Jobo the son of nebat King and Jobo drove Israel from following the Lord and made them sin a great sin so you see all I'm not going to read but all of this is Judgment coming upon them because of the idolatry and the worship can we go on so there's the kingdom in the north the kingdom in the South and because of God's being God being fed up of them he sent judgment in the form of the Assyrian army send the people all through the Assyrian Empire so what is left in Samaria is a small remnant of Israel that has not been deported and foreigners who have been brought in and this group of people who is now a mixture of foreigners and the remnant of Israel mixed together and they form the Samaritans it goes on because the Samaritans now are a mixed group of people they're mixed in culture they're mixed in race they're also mixed in religion because but AB Bram said and the Bible said that they worship God but they had little Idol practice kind of here and there there some Little Sim here but it's still acknowledging God is God and because they're in the north and because Samaria is there they can still say but Abraham was here and Jacob was here and we have to worship here so they have enough of spiritual history to stand up and say but we are the True Believers you know can the church say Amen so by the time Jesus is on the earth you know what is the number one spiritual debate between the Jews and the Samaritans the number one debate is where we supposed to worship because the Jews would tell you worship is supposed to be in Jerusalem but any Samaritan would say worship is supposed to be in Samaria on Mount jerusalm because that where God spoke to Abraham that's where Joshua reaffirmed the Covenant and they could go through all of spiritual history to show why it should be in that place and because because of the war of where should we worship that created a big divide when they were trying to rebuild the Temple the Samaritans came and said can we help and the Jews said we don't want your help because you're not pure enough that further created a wedge between the Jews and the Samaritans so it is against this hostile territory Jesus finds himself walking into Samaria one day nobody in Samaria wants to see a Jew nobody in Samar wants to hear truth those that are in Samaria believe that they are worshiping what they're supposed to worship and worship supposed to be on Mount jerusem and here comes the Messiah the book of redemption Redemption himself and and listen because of the way the Jews watched Samaritans no Jew would have ever gone to testify in Samaria no Jew would go and preach in Samaria so the people who were in Samaria who had to hear the gospel they could have never heard it from a normal Jew but this Jew who was walking into Samaria was not a normal Jew he didn't care about tradition he didn't care about the history of where they started and where the church started and who was here and who was there all of that didn't matter to him because he was just interested in one thing Redemption he not interested in location he not interested in who did what where he wants to redeem every name on the book somebody preach back to [Music] me we going to get somewhere in a minute trying to take my time here so I want you to see the drama when Jesus say he have needs pass through Samaria it's been centuries before a Jewish preacher pass through Samaria Hallelujah Jewish preachers didn't decide to go and evangelize in Samaria because the Samaran the Samaritans were firmly of the belief that they don't need to hear what the Jews had to say can the church say amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but we know that Jesus going into Samaria was with a purpose he wasn't just feeling to go to Samaria he could have gone the way any other Jew would have gone and take the road take the taxi take the donkey take the journey take the walk but he said tell said he needs part to Samaria the disciples didn't even know why he was going but there was something in him that compelled him to go into hostile territory in an uncomfortable place where people will say why why is that Jew here or is see the Jew you may be SE itall I want you to see the picture of it because the picture is important for centuries no Jew had gone to The Well of Jacob and here it is a Jew like no other Jew he's walking on the footprints placing adding footprints in the sons of time where Abraham would have walked and where Jacob would have walked and where Elijah would have walked because Elijah was the prophet to Samaria where Elisha would have walked he looked and see where Ahab would have walked because this was have been the headquarters of the northern kingdom he see where king juu would have rode through here come on somebody preach back to me when Elijah was on his way to mount carel he would have had to walk next to the next to The Well of Jacob if Jacob's Well had a voice Jacob's Well could speak of seeing Jacob coming and dipping from this well if Jacob's Well had a voice it could speak of Cena wey Elijah coming to get a cup this wasn't any well this was Jacob's well Hallelujah Jacob's Well had served but a c many a tired wary stranger but on this day in the heat of the sun with the wind blowing ever so quietly here comes the master and he's walking to Jacob's well he's taking his time because he's tired he's taking his time because he's weary he's he's so tired he sits down on Jacob's Well if Jacob's Well had a voice it would say who is this that's sitting on top this well because For the First Time a well met a well oh you don't hear me this morning for the first time Jacob's Well a deep well met a well that was deeper than he was oh you don't hear me this morning come to church see amen [Applause] anybody with me this [Applause] morning I hope I'm not losing anybody you know all right we see the picture now right so Jesus is sitting there and the Bible said he is waiting he's waiting he's waiting I can imagine people looking from the Shadows asking why is there a Jew sitting on Jacob's Well by what Authority is this Jew sitting downall on Jacob's well this is our well this is this is Samaritan well by what Authority where do Jew come from there's something about him there's a confidence he looking tired but there's a confidence that we cannot explain he looks like he belongs here nobody there challenges Jew even though hostile territory everybody keeps their distance because there's something about this man who is sitting on Jacob's Well somebody preach back to me this morning is there any this body this morning wants to go and visit Jacob's Well that well represented transformation you know that well was named after a man that got changed that spot marked a spot of Deliverance it had a historical be but at that point it was also past and future present mixed together at Jacob's [Applause] [Music] Well just to highlight friends how bad the beef was between the Jews and the Samaritans in John 8 in John 8 the Bible says this is Jesus said unto them in verse 42 if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word year of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and not in the truth because there's no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speak it of his own for he's a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth you believe me not which of you convinced me of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because you are not of God listen to the response of the Jews in verse 48 then answered the Jews and said unto him say we not well th a Samaritan and H a devil yes yes yes yes so they were accusing Jesus of being a Samaritan or being demon possessed so you can make a equal sign there they they trying to figure where is the worst insult he either say you have a devil or you're a Samaritan and it's in the midst of Samaria Jesus finds himself in an unlikely place on an unlikely day at an unlikely time in the middle of the day when his son is at the hottest point and he's tired and he's thirsty and he's weary and he's hungry but he's not moving because he's waiting for somebody he is waiting for somebody and his tiredness his thirst his concern about where he is doesn't matter because who he's coming to see is more important than his thirst who he is coming to see is more important than his hunger who he is about to see is more important than his discomfort can the church say Amen could you take some more just encourage you a little bit this morning now you'll see in a short while I am preaching about the woman and the world but I'm not reaching preaching with her you know I'm really trying to get to you that's why my subject is an unlikely bridge between the Jews and the Gentiles because salvation is of the Jews God had to make a decision to get to the Gentiles but before he get to the Gentiles I want you to understand that Jesus walking into Samaria was the first non-jew encounter he had every experience that Jesus had on the earth at that point was with Jews when he entered Samar is the first time he speaking to anybody meeting anybody dealing with anybody who is not a Jew but we read in Isaiah that his ministry is to the ends of the Earth so Jesus his great Plan of Redemption was not just to Jews only it was to Jews it was to Samaritans and it was to the Gentiles but the P said there are only three es on the earth they only Jews they're only Samaritans and they're only Gentiles and before the Assyrian Invasion there were only Jews and Gentiles God allowed the Samaritans to be born because the Samaritan is a hybrid half Jew half gentille Jesus never went to the Gentiles his ministry was not to the Gentiles when he was in the flesh but while he was on the Earth but AB Bram said he was introducing himself to the Jews he was introducing himself to the Samaritans and but AB Bram said if he introduced himself to the Jews a certain way and he introduced himself to the Samaritan a certain way he has to introduce himself to the Gentiles the same way so the woman at the well was not just a sister who needed help she was unlocking a precedent of the Gospel going beyond the Jews that had never happened before if she didn't get the gospel the Gentiles couldn't get the gospel you don't hear me I'm going to prove it in scripture in a minute so that woman in well brother Andrew was more than her situation it was more than her people if the Samaritan because listen you remember when God tell Peter to go to Cornelius and stuff he had to show Peter a vision once twice Peter said no he said how you can be clean with the unclean or because Peter wasn't ready to accept that the Gentiles could get his thing anybody with me so God in his divine plan had to find a way to create you know in court in court of law there's precedent so God between the first miracle and the second Miracle this is not the middle of Jesus ministry this is the beginning the early stage of the ministry he does a diversion in the Samaria to set a precedent in law that could allow a non-jew to accept this thing because he know his end game is to get the Gentiles but if he don't stop this way and find the Samaritans unlock Grace to them unlock Mercy to them unlock Redemption to them nobody could unlock the Gentiles anybody with me this morning and I'm going to find it in scripture anybody with me this morning God loves to find unlikely people in unlikely places Jesus said salvation is of the Jews you know but here he is unlocking this in order for the Gentiles to get a piece of this thing you remember Rahab against all ODS this one woman in Jericho a gentile woman at that somehow some come up on her heart because she's in the book of redemption she's not a Jew she not under any Covenant but somehow her name written there somehow she a representation somehow she rep Nobody Knows It But but God knows it so when the spies go there something in her wakes up she had been looking for this moment entire life and it wed it woke up when she saw them she knew that was her people she had grown up in Jericho but this was her people and that woman married General salmon and OB J see David all the way down in David was some prostitute blood in in David was some Gentile blood in know in David was some general blood you know and God allow all that mix of blood to set a presedent that you who have no chsh blood could be able to receive this or you don't hear me this morning reab was an unlikely Bridge from the Jews to the Gentiles and that woman had the well she was also an unlikely Bridge from the Jews to the Gentiles because if Jesus didn't come to her nobody was coming to her she would have been coming to that well every day but this day was different this day was different this service was different that morning she got up she got her water pot ready you may be seen it that morning but the punch she got to me she got her water pot ready as she normally would maybe she's looking out the window to see what time it is to see if the regular ladies had already gone because but Bram said she couldn't go when the regular ladies were going she had a reputation she had her guilt she had her shame she had her condemnation brother Brom said they would look at her they would talk about her so she had to wait at the the hottest moment when the course was clear after all the good people will finish getting their water Hallelujah friends she was an outcast not from the Jews in know she was an outcast among her own people the same Samaritans who had their little twisted up Doctrine they were rejecting her so it was an outcast people and she was an outcast among Outcast people who would bring Salvation to that woman oh come on somebody help me this morning and there are some Gentiles and there are some Outcast among the Gentiles who will bring Salvation to those [Music] people anybody with me this [Applause] morning I'm trying to take my time Gideon don't worry she got up that morning her water pot she's ready to go amen amen she's thirsty she has a a mix of thirst there's a natural thirst for water that's what people know about they could see it because that's the only reason You' go to Jacob's Well was to get water but she's also carrying a deeper thirst a thirst she can't explain a thirst she can't articulate she had tried to meet that t with one husband and that husband didn't work out and she tried again with her second husband and that didn't work out and when she thought the third husband was going to do it it didn't work out oh God help me this morning she tried this she tried that you've tried this you've tried that SW husband broke her heart we don't know the story we don't know what the situation was but we know it didn't work [Music] out maybe while waiting for the son to go up and for the ladies to go back home she's thinking about that fifth husband while the six the man in the house who is not her husband he is sitting there in the house she's uncomfortable in her own skin even though she's alone she can't live with herself and she has a thirst that she has been longing to quench she can't explain the TST she can't put it in the words but she just knows that something is missing is there anybody in the house this morning who is like this woman at the well you've tried this you've tried that you've tried the other but you know something's still missing money can't fill it a man can't feel it a woman can't feel it a job can't feel it popularity cannot feel it drugs cannot feel it forication can't fill it lust cannot fill it adultery cannot fill it money cars clothes houses cannot fill it anybody with me anybody with me this morning so she wakes up that morning and she's waiting meanwhile she doesn't know that Jesus is also waiting oh Hallelujah she is waiting and Jesus is waiting and when she thinks the course is clear she starts to make this journey to Jacob's wellu she had done this many times before and she doesn't know that this day is different she had come to church many times before but this time is different it was the same place that she had come to many times before it was the same church she had come to many times before but this time as she's walking there's a strange thing this the first time she come in and there's a man sitting on the well not just a man but a different looking man a Jewish man a man who not supposed to be there a man who's not welcome there can the church say Amen [Applause] somebody you may be seated [Applause] she is working she is walking the weight hallu of her water po the weight that they could see but there's also brother Anthony a weight that they cannot see the weight of her guilt the weight of her shame the weight of her discomfort the weight of the silent moments the weight of her tears the weight of her attempts the weight of her desperate cry the weight of her thirst the weight of her dissatisfaction the weight of her need the weight of what she was looking for the weight of everything locked up in her she was walking to Jacob's Well she didn't realize and that day there were two Wells she thought she was walking to one well but there were two Wells on that day one well would have regular water but there was another well that had Living Water oh come on down church one well had regular water but one well had living water and she was walking with a water pot looking for natural water looking to quench a natural thirst and as she approaches she is tired you may be [Applause] seated first means thirst Jesus is thirsty but she is also thirsty tiredness meet tiredness he is tired and she is tired of living in her skin is there anybody tired of living in your skin you're tired of your life and say Lord oh God I fed up I fed up a tired this morning I tired this morning I can't live this way no more I fed up I've come to Jacob's well this morning and I need a drink I need a different kind of drink this morning I need something more than yesterday I've been to this well many times before but this well has to be more than just tradition this well needs to be more than just Jacob's Well it must be my well of transformation anybody with me this morning could you take some more [Music] we're doing okay with time could you take some more [Music] she is walking into the well and she doesn't break the silence she just walks and maybe she sees him and she says Let Let me just do what I need to do and get out hallu hallu hallu let me just get my water quickly and just go back maybe she wasn't in a mood for conversation said people look at my church and they don't want you to talk to them maybe she said I hope this man don't ask me nothing now hallu see what just fed up [Applause] here if I could just get in and just get out just get my little T of water and go back home hallelujah hallelujah but Jesus interrupted whatever she was thinking because she didn't offer Jesus water Hallelujah she didn't ask him what you doing here she didn't say why you're here she was about to go about her own business but when Jesus looked at her Hallelujah he saw something in her that she couldn't see herself and but said Jesus was trying to contact her spirit he wanted to go beyond the flesh beyond what other people were seeing to contact a soul anybody with me and he broke broke the Silence of the day by saying give me to drink and that one phrase broke in Ephesians they talk about the middle wall of partition in that one statement Jesus broke tradition he broke culture he broke the racial divide he broke the religious divide because Jews don't talk to Samaritans men don't just approach women and nobody has speak to outcast and in that one statement he broke the walls between him and [Applause] her verse seven there cometh a woman and in St John 4 of Samar to draw water Jesus sath unto her give me to drink for his disciples were gone away until the seated to buy meat they were hungry Jesus thirsty Jesus tired he's sitting up he not standing up here we see the humanity of the Lord sitting down as it were almost vulnerable weak tired thirsty say give me to drink then said the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew ask it of me which am two things a woman meaning men in that day don't just approach women who you don't know and of Samaria meaning we don't talk we don't believe the same thing we not in the same church we don't have the same interpretation we do have the same understanding of the word for the Jews have no dealings with the [Applause] Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who is it now now let me add something here in all of the Bible Matthew Mark Luke and John if you go and look brother uh bar at every conversation Brother Andy between Jesus and one onone with anybody in scripture this is the longest one onone conversation recorded in the Bible between Jesus and anybody so there has to be a significance with a punch to this particular conversation go read every conversent Jesus had this is the longest one Jesus take his time to talk to this woman Jesus answered and said unto her if knowest the gift of God and who it is that sayth to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee Living Water Hallelujah and this woman brother Bram said she knew more than many of the preachers today don't look at nobody small in this place because that little woman that Samaritan woman that woman who was a woman of brother of ill Fame you know when said the secret is the word in the bride she had some word locked up in her in the midst of her struggles the word had found a resting place there was some good ground in her soul that when it have time to rely on the word she could Rock back on the word anybody with me this [Applause] morning verse 11 the woman said unto him now now this is some what what's an opportun of a conversation with Jesus Jesus bow the ball and she hold the back Hallelujah and say Sir thou Hast nothing to draw it and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that Living Water what come on what are you talking about on and she goes now into the word now a dog greater than our father Jacob so she knew her history there might be some idolatry mixed up there in the bloodline somewhere but she know Jacob is her father you say I thought greater than our father Jacob which gave us this well and drun thereof himself he himself drank here and his children and his cattle yes hallelujah amen so she she bed there so Jesus had to bowl again Jesus answer said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water that I talking about whoever drinketh of this water speaking about the water in the well rather shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him there's a transference from the physical well to the well being on the inside now in him a well of water springing up into everlasting [Applause] [Music] life any with me this morning can we give the Lord a shout of Praise when Jesus said that the woman said n hold on hold on like you and know who you're talking to here today he said sir give me this water that I thirst not listen to her we got I thirst here but I thirst not neither come here to draw in other words if I get this thing I don't need to come back here again I don't have to walk back this way and know the woman watching me and they talking about me and they say look she again that's a real man look at she again that that woman is trouble give me this water that I don't have to pass by this way again and I don't have to thirst again can the church amen Jesus said unto her go this is when now he now he reach a spirit now and he know what he dealing with he know the problem he come to fix he know what her problem is he knows what her situation is and he said go call thy husband and come backl and the woman said unto him I have no husband she looking her wrong day making sure no nobody are heing because this is her deeply held secret this is the Crux of her issue this is the issue that been bothering her this is the issue that's stressing her out Hallelujah Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said I have no husband for thou Hast had five husbands and he whom thou Hast is not thy husband in that sest thou truly amen now when she heard that now you need to be spiritual friends she say I perceive that thou art a Prophet now I want to catch this this is the Pharisees and the Sadducees and all them fellas trying to figure out who is this man and and if doubting and this Samaritan woman outside of the most of the Miracles Jesus would do have not been done yet I want us to catch this most of what they would criticize has even happened yet but the moment he said this she catches a revelation one time about who is she speaking to I perceive that th are a Prophet come on and then she go deeper into the word now so now she jumped on the anointing of who she talking to she say this is a prophet let me let me drive this thing as far as I can go with it she said our fathers Worship in this mountain Mount Jerusalem Abraham was here Joshua was here Elijah was here our fathers were here and ye say in Jerusalem so she now calling out the Jew our fathers claim this mountain and ye say in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship she asking him a spiritual question our fathers have something tight among Jerusalem but you people say Jerusalem is where and are not coming in other words are not coming to Jerusalem because I believe my Doctrine is that worship is in jism on this mountain and you Jews want us to believe that worship has to be in Jerusalem listen to Jesus Jesus said un a woman believe me the hour cometh when he shall neither in this mountain of jism nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father Jesus at that moment busted location based worship he said the hour cometh when it wouldn't be whether you're in jerusem or Jerusalem it don't matter whether it's this church or that church don't matter you don't hear me this [Music] morning the Lord himself stood there the book of redemption stood and busted location based worship anybody tell you you have to be here or you have to be here and listen you may be seated the history nice to know because I could give you a whole message on why I should Worship in Jerusalem and I could preach a whole message about why I should Worship in charism we can find scriptures to defend with the CL B places of worship and Jesus said the hour cometh when it wouldn't be here or there this church or that church this group or this group this country or this country in other words it don't matter where you Fellowship there's something more important than the church you go to there's something more important than the location of your worship or you don't hear me this morning Hallelujah are you getting it Church you may be seated so any preacher any group that say you had to be connected here or you have to go there even reads in John 4 because Jesus himself said the hour cometh when you shall need her on this mountain even though Abraham was here even though Joshua was here even though Jerusalem is the place for the prince of PE and all of that the hour coming when he shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem in neither of these places you will worship the father he goes on you worship you know not what but we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but this is it now this is the one this at this point this the greatest introduction of teaching that Jesus does since he's on the earth because this is how he grafts in the Samaritans and the Gentiles so he busted the place of worship of the Samaritans he busted the place of worship of the Jews between he's ending the doctrinal war between the two groups but the brandham said both the Jews and the Samaritans were looking for the Messiah that's why she could have spoken that way and even though they were both looking for the Messiah their Doctrine was mixed up the Gentiles but the said had no chance because they were not even looking for the Messiah am amen amen but Jesus said list he said you worship you know not what we know what you worship for salvation of the Jews but the hour cometh come on now we going to tell them where to worship oh come on now I I have in my own service here this morning I don't know what service you have it because if it's not Jerusalem and it's not Jerm where should we worship he said the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers because the father looking for some true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth in other words the place where he supposed to worship is where spirit and truth comes together word and spirit Dynamics and mechanics oh Hallelujah and that place is not a physical location that place is another dimension that place is another realm where word and spirit comes together spirit and Truth come together can the church Give the Lord a shout of [Applause] [Music] praise for the father seeketh such to worship Him and Jesus goes on this the longest conversation recorded in the Bible one and one between Jesus and anybody and he not talking to a priest he didn't take this to kyus he didn't take this to the Sanhedrin Council he didn't even share this with Peter bear in mind friends listen oh we going to get into this a minute he has even shared this with his [Music] disciples his disciples don't even know fully who he is yet but here it is a Samaritan woman with a messed up past messed up history rejected by her people rejected by herself and here it is almighty God the book of redemption is reveal it to her truths not to her pastor not to our Prophet to a little sister with a water pot Lord find me here this morning with my water pot fill my cup Lord I Lift It Up Lord come and quench this thirsting of my soul Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah listen to this now we building into something everybody with me this morning could you take some more are you seeing how you are tied up in the word verse 24 God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth when he says that now watch now this is a serious back and forth there's a serious conversation here now he contrast this to these stupid conversations Jesus would have had to have suffered from these Pharisees and these people where they act accuse him is either you're a Samaritan or you're demon possessed after he do all these Miracles but here it is was look at the joy Jesus having in this conversation and she responds the woman said unto him I know that Messiah cometh yes you see it she know Messiah coming which is called Christ she broken she missed but she on the word she know Messiah is supposed to come she knows that there's a power coming she know that the anointed word that's Messiah is going to be here oh my God she doesn't know that she doesn't know yet who she's talking to but she know that is a promise that Messiah will be on the earth woo she said I know that Messiah coming which is called Christ and when he is come he will tell us all things Hallelujah and friends I Shar it but overid you may be SE it sometimes I get excited with the word and I start to preach to people some years ago I had a message for such a time as this with Esther and boys s get our message two three times in the week leading up to the service P my daddy we I said to preach this famous I call him I call him back again and and I said to him this message came to me when he was preaching about two Sundays or so ago and he made a statement and when it get Quicken to me because all through jesus' Ministry he was saying tell no man tell no man tell no man don't tell nobody don't tell nobody don't tell nobody and then it became too much after Lazarus rode from the dead the key couldn't shut them up no more that is what caused the virgins down into Jerusalem because the hosana cry was they say this thing is too much we can't keep quiet no more but check this Jesus public Declaration of who he was this is the first time in the Bible he actually says who he is Jesus said onto H verse 26 I that speak unto thee I'm he this is the first time Jesus ever said he is the Christ he came right out and said it to a woman of ill Fame in some Mar who no Minister was ever going to try to convert he came direct and say I that speak to you that Messiah you're looking for I am he listen his own disciple it was until Matthew 16 he said who do men say I am this is this is way after that you know bear in mind this conversation happening the disciples not there it's just him and the woman they going to find food they going down to they going to KFC they going to Royal Castle they going to find some meat and here it is this is Brother Stephen this is the only person on the earth who has heard the words direct from the Lord I am the Messiah before before this Brothers had speculation they say we believe he's he's the Christ you know go back and read early John with Philip and nataniel and them saying we have found him but Jesus never admitted he never he never approved it he never confirmed it but to this woman who was not a Jew in the middle of Samaria hostile territory a place where he broke his own oh come on he broke the rules of engagement because her name was in the book and the Samaritans had to be grafted in and the Gentiles had to follow that [Music] is after he declared that the Bible say in verse 27 and upon this after this statement come his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman yes yet nobody everybody B in the greas yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her they just watching you know you know when preach testimony on you see he said they were just fellowshipping saying remember when Jesus did this for them brothers day we had chicken here but what Jesus doing hallelujah what Jesus doing anyway you think we just start to eat her really nobody want to talk to him nobody asking him what he looking for and why you talking to her and villagers the sidelines I want you to see the unfolding of this picture and I love vers 28 you know but brandom say when the Revival break the woman can't even wash the dishes verse 20 and the woman then left her water pot but Lon she leave the water pot the reason she thought she came to the well but Mike he she came with a water pot and leave the water part she came to church for one reason and the reason she came to church for wasn't the reason she left with oh God tell somebody help for anybody watching her they had to know something happened because she left a well with no water pot they saw her going to the well with the water pot to get water and he the woman coming back moving brisk brisk no water pot before she said something they already know something happened and maybe when she left they thought the water but break or something but she want to say come see a [Applause] man the woman left her water verse 28 and went her way into the City and said to the men come see a man which told me all things that I ever did listen to our words is not this the Christ the Jews were not talking so the Pharisees when talking so the sadu SE when not talking so here is a woman now who is transformed not only did she leave the physical water pot but with that water pot she left her guilt she left her shame she left her fear she left her desire to be alone she left a desire to not talk to anybody her desire to not Fellowship she ran to the men the men she didn't want to talk to she said come see a man come and see a man who told me all about you is this not the Christ come on somebody preach back to me she had to be extremely persuasive because the next verse of the Bible said then they went out of the city and came unto him amen amen so I preached this before you may be seated I'm feeling Goodall what time is it could you take some more because if I could go you could go if I could keep pushing then you have no excuse anybody feeling tired anybody feel like passing out anybody let's go so I preached it before Jesus when Jesus does something he has the amazing ability to do multiple things at the same time so when Jesus died on the cross simultaneously the failes ran from top to bottom simultaneously he could leave this physical body and go into the realm and take the keys of death and hell so it's only afterwards you could see all the things that are happening with that one event and the second order consequences of that one event Jesus didn't just come for that woman at the well he came for a group of Samaritans who would have been marginalized who would have been ostracized who would have not been allowed to come to a Jewish temple to ever hear Jesus preach or even be in Jerusalem or on the mount to hear The Sermon on the Mount they would not have been welcome to hear the sermon of the mount they would not have been welcome to be in anywhere Jesus went in bethl in Bethany in Galilee in capernium so when Jesus came to that woman it wasn't just her he was coming to he was coming just like Rahab to her family to her house to her people so when she said come see a man which told me all things that I ever did is not this to Christ then they went out of the city and came unto him verse 31 in the meanwhile his disciples play prayed him or ple with them Master eat something now notice Jesus they getting no water yet rightall the woman came with a water to get water she gone without the water Jesus asked the water he get any water the disciples went to buy food to bring it back and they say eat something now and verse 32 he said unto them I have meat to eat that ye know not of he said what I do in here is so this thing like food he said I don't say e here right now because this is his character of love being expressed to a Samaritan woman and to her people it was more important to him not even eating verse 33 then said the disciples one another had any man brought him or to eat meaning somebody give him something because we know reach we know bring the food everybody looking for and like he looking like he not hungry anymore he clearly a tired anymore he a thirsty anymore maybe somebody give him some puffs somebody give some sweet bread somebody because we have the food here but look at look at Jesus verse 34 Jesus said unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish the work come on now somebody speak to me this whole thing is a spiritual thing you know the anointing is so Upon Jesus his appetite gone not because he tired of frustrated because there's a joy to see a soul come to Salvation a joy to see a people will come to [Applause] Redemption Hallelujah verse 35 say not ye they are yet four months and then cometh Harvest Hallelujah behold I say unto you lift up your eyes and look on the fields for they are white or already to harest in other words Jus saying time is short time is short there's work to be done more important than the natural things are coming on a mission you can't slow on the mission there's something somebody who needs me can the church say amen and he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal that both he that SW it and he that reap it may Rejoice together and hearing is that saying true one SW it and one another reap it I send you to reap that whereon he bestowed no labor other men labor and he are entered into their labors can the church say amen amen wo Glory [Applause] let me try to kind of bring these things together you enjoy any word this morning and verse 39 and many of the Samaritans of that City believed on him so here's a converted group of Samaritans for the saying of the woman so her she was the first witness read scripture so she's the first witness for many many and many of the of that c believed on him for the sing woman which testified he told me all that I ever did verse 40 so when the Samaritans would come unto him they besought him that he would t with them and he Abode there two days so for two days Jesus is welcome in Samaria two days they fellowship with two days they get to ask questions two days he get to share things with them and verse 41 and many more believed because of his word and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the savior of the world this is before Matthew 16 this is before Jesus walk on water this is before last restation be dead Hallelujah [Music] Glory Glory let me try to bring this to close everybody feeling fine so my mind is blown friends I just want to talk a little bit to see how Jesus Plan of Redemption God's love for a gentile people for a marginalized people for a people that would not have been welcomed into a temple in Jerusalem and here it is as brother Bram said Jesus didn't go to the Gentiles but he went to the Jews who were were expecting him he went to the Samaritans who were expecting him and I want to now pick up something very powerful in Matthew 10 to even show you something here and you'll see now why this is important and the unfolding of the ministry to the Gentiles Matthew 10 and you'll see here now in Matthew 10 he said and when he had called unto him his 12 disciples he gave them power but this is Matthew 10 verse1 against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease now the names of the 12 apostles are these the first Simon who was called Peter and Andrew his brother James the son of Zebedee and John's brother Philip and Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the Publican James son of alus and leus whose surname was thadius Simon the Canaanite and Judas Iscariot who also betrayed him these 12 listen carefully Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go listen carefully to the command he gives them go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not amen but go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel amen and as you go preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand so this blow my mind because here it is he is given his disciples power but the power they get is jurisdictional he's saying he have power to heal the C devil said but the power given you I'm not giv you enough power to go into the Samaritan and the Gentiles you ready for that he is saying it that way to them but in the divine plan of God you're ready for that yet you need a different kind of power to go after the Samaritans and the Gentiles this is why when he goes to the Samaritans he's he God wants to handle it himself it was not the ministry of those Apostles at that time to go to the Samaritans or he say with this power it is restricted to Jerusalem Judea that's your jurisdiction do what you want in this area but do not enter into the Samaritans or the Gentiles that Ministry is not for you anybody with me it's powerful I want you to say how important you are so we see in scripture Jesus himself went to the Samaritans he didn't leave it to his disciples but now let's relook at a very famous very familiar scripture to us to now reconcile this acts 18 you know the scripture acts: 18 so the power and the ministry given to the disciples before the Holy Ghost P was very different to after because in acts when he says but he shall receive power which is different from Matthew 10 power he said you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and with this PowerAll ye shall be Witnesses unto me listen both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in the job World your job description get expanded he say in Matthew 10 I couldn't give you this part but now that I've died and rose again now this power and releasing gives you the authority let's read it now and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth which is which is to the gentille so in other words the ministry to the Samaritans before Jesus died only he could handle it and even after he died he said I want to be involved so I'm going to give you power which is God himself in the form of the Holy Ghost so is God in Paul is God in Phillip is God in Peter anybody with me so the ministry to the Samaritans and the Gentiles was all Christ Ministry he introduced himself to the Jews he introduced himself to the Samaritans when he went to that woman of the well and to the people there and after that the only salvation to the Samaritans was in Acts 10 after the Holy Ghost poured out when philli went and preached and they were baptized and Peter the SA Peter come and lay hands upon them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost can the church say Amen the unfolding of the Plan of Redemption to see how God created a bridge between the Jews and the Gentiles and why his interaction with the Samaritan woman and the placing of even Samaria within the Great Commission and he shall be witnessed unto me both in Judea in in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and in the uttermost path of the earth amen amen amen can the church say [Applause] Amen a bridge but the bandam said it this way he said and done then in recognizing your day and his message but then one day the lightning begin to flash the Thunders begin to Roar and the Spirit come upon the prophet talking about job and he saw the coming of a man who could put his hand upon a sinful man and a holy God and bridged way we talking about creating a bridge a bridge between Jew that salvation of the Jews and the Gentiles a bridge between you having access to God somebody had to bridge that woman who came to the world because nobody was coming to her Jesus himself became the [Music] bridge and by him being a bridge to her her testimony became a bridge to her people because of her her people were saved and that testimony became a bridge to us that the Samaritans could be saved now the Gentiles could be go after Jesus himself not going physically after them but as the form of the Holy Ghost among his disciples he now goes after the Gentiles the ministry of Paul the Holy Ghost himself veil in Paul the messenger to the Gentiles can the church say [Applause] [Music] Amen in influence I think that's a great thing that we should look at in Christian Life there had to be a bridge to span way for the human race to leave this world someday and there was no one could do it an angel Archangel seraphim a cherubim nothing could do with God himself came down in the form of a man and bridged away and made the way and crossed the bridge first from the grave to glory and it shows through the reflection ameno Hallelujah from a message behold I stand at the door and N but and said going back to that woman of the well she ran into the City and said come see a man who told me the things I've done isn't this the Messiah if that was the sign of the Messiah then to the Jew and the Samaritan ham and jaffet people it's all that's left Jew Gentile Samaritan and now we've had 2,000 years of church God has called the Gentile bride out down through phiney and sanki and so forth the age now we at the end of the Gentile age at the end time as I spoke of last night at anytime something could happen the world's nervous you hear the president speech yesterday and well we just don't know what's going to happen it could happen before morning spotniks in the skies and Jesus said there would be and everything the whole world shaken men dying with hard failure perplex of times and stress between the Nations and in that day he promised to return and do as he did then little while and the world see me no more yet you'll see me for I'll be with you the work that I do shall you do also now he can't declare himself to the Jews and to the Samaritans in that way and leave the Gentiles out so this is the day can the church say Amen so almighty God can we bring it home now almighty God came down in the flesh yes to introduce himself to the Jews who he was his nature his being his attributes and he did it to the to the Samaritans directly himself amen and in our day he came down and veiled himself the son of man veiled in a son of man to introduce himself to the Gentiles through a prophet he wasn't leaving this up to chance he wasn't leaving this up to anybody else can the church say can the church say amen he did it to the Jews himself he did it to the Samaritans himself and he has done it to the Gentiles himself Hallelujah through a message of a prophet Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah a Ministry so the Samaritans and the woman at the well was just a prefigure or a shadow there's a quote brandham said that she was also a type of the Gentile bride God had to find a way to include so extend the ministry Beyond the Jews can the church say Amen oh the musician get ready I'm finished Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah a bridge between the Jews and the Gentiles the Samaritans being a bridge the woman and the well being an inspiration to us as an individual yes sir as somebody who nobody want wanted to reach but here it was Jesus came to her and Jesus found her and then she he found him amen hallelujah may the Lord richly bless you today and may you take courage about that encounter at Jacob's well may you take courage at Comfort at the conversation at Jacob's Well and maybe you came this
