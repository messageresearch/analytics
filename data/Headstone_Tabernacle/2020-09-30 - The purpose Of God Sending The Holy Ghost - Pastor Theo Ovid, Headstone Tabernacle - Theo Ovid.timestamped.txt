[29:02] lord
[29:03] so tonight we want to go to the
[29:05] scriptures we want to read two portion
[29:06] scriptures tonight
[29:08] from sin john chapter 14 verse 14 to 26
[29:11] and luke chapter 16 1 verse 8 verse 16.
[29:15] it's in john chapter 14
[29:18] reading verse 14. if you shall ask
[29:20] anything in my name i will do it
[29:22] if you love me keep my commandments and
[29:24] i will pray the father this is jesus
[29:26] talking
[29:27] and he will give you another comforter
[29:30] so referencing another comforter because
[29:32] he himself being among them
[29:33] he was a comforter with them but he's
[29:35] talking about another comforter
[29:37] so he was the word and he's prophet sign
[29:40] of the spirit
[29:41] i shall give you another comforter that
[29:42] he may abide with you forever
[29:45] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[29:48] cannot receive
[29:49] this is not the spirit of error now it's
[29:51] not a spirit of lies it's spirit of
[29:53] truth whom the world cannot receive
[29:55] because it sees him not
[29:56] you don't know with him but he know it
[29:57] you you know him for he dwelleth with
[30:00] you
[30:00] shall be in you i will not leave you
[30:03] comfortless i will come to you
[30:05] yet a little while the world sees me no
[30:07] more but you see me because i live he
[30:09] shall live also
[30:10] at that day you shall know that i am in
[30:13] my father
[30:14] and hear me and i knew so he's saying to
[30:16] them you don't know that now but at that
[30:18] day you will know this
[30:20] verse 21 he didn't have my commandments
[30:21] and keepeth them he is that love at me
[30:24] he that loved me shall be loved of my
[30:25] father and i will love him
[30:27] i will manifest myself to him and judah
[30:30] said unto him not a scare at lord how is
[30:32] it the tower it manifests
[30:33] thyself unto us and not unto the world
[30:36] answer
[30:37] jesus answered and said unto him if a
[30:38] man loves me he will keep my words
[30:41] and my father will love him and we will
[30:44] come unto him
[30:45] and we'll make our board with him he
[30:47] that loveth may not keep it not my sins
[30:49] and the word which he hear is not mine
[30:52] but the father which sent me
[30:54] these things have i spoken unto you
[30:56] being yet present with you
[30:58] but but the comforter
[31:02] which is the holy ghost whom the father
[31:04] will send in my name
[31:05] send operating word whom the father will
[31:09] send in my name he shall teach you all
[31:12] things
[31:13] and bring all things to your remembrance
[31:15] whatever
[31:16] since that time the kingdom of god is
[31:18] preached on every man
[31:20] will you speak to them take me out of
[31:22] that peter was con
[31:24] responsible for what he shared by words
[31:27] to cornelius house but lord he was not
[31:30] responsible for the moving of the spirit
[31:32] and the dynamic operation of the holy
[31:34] spirit that fell
[31:36] on cornelius and the gathering at
[31:37] cornelius home
[31:39] because the scripture declared while
[31:41] peter yet spake these words
[31:43] the holy ghost fell upon them that heard
[31:45] the word it was such a shocking thing
[31:48] to peter and the other jews with him
[31:49] they were astonished that the holy ghost
[31:52] itself was being poured out upon the
[31:54] gentiles
[31:55] just as they had had it in the upper
[31:57] room and it was an astonishing thing for
[31:58] them to see it
[31:59] so peter wasn't in charge of opening
[32:01] that pipe of the spirit
[32:03] you are in charge of that lord and we
[32:04] pray that you would come down tonight
[32:06] and open up in the people's hearts and
[32:08] lies right in their homes the fire of
[32:10] god
[32:11] the healing virtue of christ the
[32:13] deliverance
[32:14] lord the witness of your spirit the
[32:16] power of god even right now while we are
[32:18] praying
[32:19] may the dove sweep into every home every
[32:21] heart every life lord and bring that
[32:23] victory to them lord
[32:24] oh god we are depending on you tonight
[32:28] uh our words will fail lord but your
[32:30] words can feel
[32:32] and we believe that we are moving to
[32:34] that cycle father of the spirit
[32:36] uh having the preeminences of the spirit
[32:38] having the oversight
[32:39] for your deepest desire is to see your
[32:42] sons in
[32:43] such a position that you can say there
[32:45] is my spirit flowing freely no hidden
[32:47] agenda
[32:48] no politics no unclean spirit no crooked
[32:51] life
[32:52] just a channel of god that you can flow
[32:54] freely
[32:55] father god may you find such a place the
[32:57] night in our hearts
[32:58] where you're knocking all the doors and
[33:00] you are available to every crevice in
[33:02] our lives
[33:03] that with the freedom of spirit lord the
[33:06] liberty
[33:07] and of god that the word could be
[33:09] operational tonight lord
[33:11] in jesus name we ask it amen and amen
[33:16] okay so tonight i have a title
[33:19] the purpose of god sent in the holy
[33:22] ghost that's the title tonight
[33:24] the purpose of god said in the holy
[33:25] ghost i have an inspiration every man
[33:28] must press every man must
[33:31] press i like to always find things that
[33:34] we are responsible for
[33:36] you know like how the bible says the
[33:37] secret thing belongs to god where things
[33:39] that
[33:39] are revealed belong to us isn't that
[33:41] right so secrets
[33:43] god in charge of that but what belong to
[33:44] us belongs to us what is has been
[33:46] revealed
[33:47] amen now uh let's let's go see what the
[33:51] law will do
[33:52] tonight now have you ever seen have you
[33:55] ever seen this
[33:56] you see in our churches today even the
[33:59] groups where we have separated ourselves
[34:00] and make organization
[34:02] we see all of this and you've seen a man
[34:05] here we go
[34:06] pick up a certain scripture and brother
[34:10] that man can take that scripture and
[34:13] make it live
[34:14] new make it live just exactly what is
[34:17] promising in the bible
[34:19] and the next man will see him do it and
[34:21] he will come along and try to do it and
[34:24] fail
[34:24] i hope you're reading now he'll feel why
[34:27] the scripture
[34:29] is not inspired to him he's only trying
[34:32] to impersonate
[34:33] he's trying to act like something watch
[34:36] he said no watch but what about the
[34:38] church what kind of messiah is the
[34:40] church looking for today
[34:42] the church has been crying the loudest
[34:44] we're holding about a messiah
[34:45] we are looking revival no time what are
[34:48] they looking for
[34:49] to do it what more do you want what
[34:53] does the church want anyhow we already
[34:55] got it
[34:56] god give it to us it's his promise
[35:00] for this hour we look in the bible
[35:04] we see it everywhere through the bible
[35:06] anointed ones
[35:08] come on and make that word live again
[35:11] listen to it anointed ones
[35:15] if it's not anointed how could it really
[35:18] live
[35:19] it will take the atmosphere the presence
[35:22] the power the anointing to make that
[35:26] word live
[35:27] dry dead cold formal no life coming to
[35:30] that it has to be
[35:32] the breath of god so here it is now
[35:35] anointed ones come on and make that word
[35:37] live again right
[35:38] in the hour for that over now we have
[35:40] got the messiah
[35:41] this is him the word in the beginning
[35:43] was the word
[35:44] the word was with god the word was god
[35:47] and the word remains god the same
[35:49] yesterday therefore
[35:50] we are wanting a messiah and god give us
[35:53] the messiah
[35:54] what's the messiah his promise word
[35:58] for this day it's just waiting
[36:02] for somebody with faith to anoint it
[36:06] and make it live again o praise the name
[36:10] of the lord
[36:11] so i want to encourage you tonight that
[36:13] all we have need of
[36:15] is in the message of the hour is in the
[36:17] books
[36:18] is in the tapes but it takes fear to
[36:20] anoint every divine promise
[36:22] and you have to claim it for yourself
[36:24] isn't that right so you said
[36:26] he says no martin luther mechanics and
[36:28] dynamics of this day
[36:30] john wesley had them pentecostal had
[36:33] them of their day
[36:34] what about our day this is another time
[36:37] the church should be fully grown now
[36:40] ready to meet christ
[36:42] with the manifestation of
[36:45] every blessing that he promised in the
[36:48] bible
[36:48] operating in that one great body where
[36:51] he promised he would meet the people and
[36:53] be worshiped
[36:54] in this great church of his oh blessed
[36:57] be the name of the lord do we believe
[36:58] that tonight
[36:59] that the church should be fully grown
[37:01] ready to meet christ with what with
[37:03] books and tapes no
[37:04] with the manifestation of every blessing
[37:07] that he promised in the bible
[37:09] operating in that one great body where
[37:11] he promised
[37:12] he would meet the believer the people
[37:14] and be worshiped
[37:16] o praise god so god's purpose of sending
[37:19] the holy spirit
[37:20] is one purpose one purpose that god
[37:23] himself might dwell in his church
[37:26] and continue his plans through the
[37:28] church
[37:29] and that's why the holy spirit told the
[37:31] prophet pick up the pen and write by
[37:33] and through the bride will be fulfilled
[37:36] all that was promised
[37:37] isn't that right that god was in christ
[37:40] continuous plans through christ
[37:42] out of christ into the church continuing
[37:44] his work through the church
[37:45] all god was he coming to christ all that
[37:48] christ was
[37:49] he poured into the church what is it
[37:52] god working in you anywhere in the world
[37:57] that he would want to call on you
[37:59] working in you
[38:00] to do his good will oh we ought to thank
[38:03] god
[38:04] for that thank god the holy spirit is
[38:07] sent for the purpose
[38:08] of god living in his church moving
[38:10] through each age
[38:12] isn't that right he was lifted up
[38:14] between the heaven and earth died
[38:15] and redeemed everything and in bleeding
[38:18] hallelujah
[38:19] he sanctified a church that he himself
[38:22] might live in
[38:23] not come to church now his blood is what
[38:27] sanctified the church
[38:28] because he could only come to a
[38:30] sanctified life oh glory
[38:32] to god and that's why it was so powerful
[38:35] the testimony of cornelius he was just
[38:38] and devout and amanda was praying always
[38:42] he don't know about jesus hallelujah he
[38:45] don't know what's going to unfold
[38:46] but the god was so pleased with his
[38:49] prayer
[38:50] and his testimony that god sent
[38:52] visitation of an angel
[38:53] to tell him to send for peter because
[38:55] peter was part of this body of christ
[38:57] this operational functional book of acts
[39:01] this channel of god that life could come
[39:04] out the mouth
[39:04] of peter oh glory to god and peter
[39:08] on new grounds was challenged to rise
[39:10] and kill and eat
[39:11] and he was challenged to go to these
[39:13] gentiles called to minister to the
[39:15] gentiles
[39:15] oh glory to god and all peter was to do
[39:18] was to give a witness and testimony
[39:20] by word of what happened and why he was
[39:23] given testimony
[39:24] while he was speaking while he was
[39:26] witnessing what he saw
[39:28] what he experienced the spirit bore
[39:30] witness oh glory to god
[39:32] and once more the spirit will return and
[39:35] is returning and has returned
[39:37] to be a witness the bible said the lord
[39:39] himself
[39:40] went everywhere with them confirming the
[39:43] word
[39:44] not a hope this is a blessing to you not
[39:45] that confirming the word
[39:47] with signs following or give the lord a
[39:50] shout in the house
[39:51] supernatural power supernatural
[39:53] vindication supernatural presence all
[39:56] glory to god people have to
[39:57] they they're afraid of the supernatural
[39:59] but something supernatural
[40:01] have to happen to you oh glory to god
[40:03] there's not no morse back church member
[40:05] sitting here and hearing intellectual in
[40:07] your head something has to happen to you
[40:09] is not you stop smoking stop drinking
[40:11] stop doing this it's the operation of
[40:14] god
[40:14] that operated supernaturally that takes
[40:17] the desire for the smoke
[40:18] take the desire to lust take the desire
[40:20] to live all kind of crazy life
[40:22] god working in your life oh hallelujah
[40:25] praise god
[40:26] so he was lifted up between heaven died
[40:29] and redeemed everything
[40:30] and then bleeding he sanctified a church
[40:33] that he
[40:34] himself might live in and fellowship
[40:38] and commune with that lost spot of
[40:40] fellowship
[40:41] from the garden of eden where god came
[40:44] down
[40:44] in the cool of the evening and i could
[40:46] see why god
[40:47] leave these lastly sons to receive the
[40:50] full revelation of the mystery of god
[40:53] that he could fully commune with them
[40:55] and have fellowship with them
[40:56] what a privilege to be in this hour it's
[40:59] crazy outside the dear
[41:00] it is crazy and it'll get crazier but we
[41:03] are blessed and privileged
[41:04] because many wise men and prophets long
[41:06] to be in such a time as this
[41:08] when the birth hallelujah when the sons
[41:10] of god
[41:11] will be born into manifestation oh this
[41:13] is great tonight

[41:23] scorch the earth
[41:24] with the power and the supernatural
[41:26] presence of the jesus christ

[41:30] direct from god they have to hear

[41:34] messenger of the age hallelujah

[41:39] we could
[41:40] walk in that light and manifest that
[41:42] supernatural light do we believe that

[44:47] fool praise god you will get back the
[44:49] same word
[44:50] that was spoken before it will come back
[44:52] again i'll ride the trail once more
[44:55] oh glory to god he will bring it back to
[44:57] remembrance hallelujah because god can't
[44:59] change his word
[45:00] he subject his own self to his word o
[45:03] blessed be name of the lord
[45:04] as soon as the church gets his church
[45:07] and his speaking conditions get his
[45:08] church
[45:09] to a place where he can flow himself
[45:12] through
[45:12] and love and persuade and fellowship
[45:16] then there will come an eden so where
[45:18] does that put all the legalists down
[45:20] where he want to get the spirit that he
[45:22] could flow and love
[45:24] and persuade that's the spirit of god
[45:26] brooding hallelujah that he's not thou
[45:28] shalt not indulge
[45:29] that law get look up long time god after
[45:31] they couldn't obey the law that's why

[45:36] be motivated by the love
[45:38] love for him love for the course love
[45:40] for his people oh glory to god
[45:42] hallelujah when that
[45:43] love is dear then you could step out on
[45:45] the limb
[45:46] then you could accept challenges because
[45:48] there's a love of god in your soul oh
[45:50] praise god
[45:51] so come back even he would take his
[45:53] church back we had left him back to eden
[45:55] again
[45:56] and watch days where we'll be taken back
[45:58] again
[45:59] and so on oh hallelujah praise
[46:02] god notice now god as the light begin to
[46:06] shine in the last days
[46:07] here we go he's expecting us he is
[46:10] expected
[46:11] so god has an expectation
[46:14] you know people don't wait in the lord
[46:15] reason lord listen to this he
[46:18] is expecting us a great thing from us
[46:22] oh glory to god hallelujah if you were
[46:24] here in the church i would tell you turn
[46:25] around and tell somebody he's expecting
[46:27] a great thing from us
[46:28] he's aggressive great thing from you
[46:30] he's expecting a great thing from you
[46:32] come on now another little thing you
[46:34] know a great thing
[46:37] oh glory to god if your mind don't hold
[46:39] that you're in trouble
[46:40] oh glory to god you know i was saying
[46:43] some of my wife
[46:44] are still nowhere you know there's a
[46:46] reason
[46:47] why god didn't show israel the shortcut
[46:50] to go into the promised land
[46:52] it's the reason why there was a shorter
[46:54] way i think 11 days or something
[46:56] they got to hit the land but god wanted
[46:58] to see if
[47:00] he could get them to change their minds
[47:03] because they came out of egypt but egypt
[47:06] didn't come out of them
[47:08] so it's one thing to come out of egypt
[47:10] is another thing to get egypt
[47:11] out of the people because he understood
[47:14] and knew
[47:15] how the human nature is as soon as
[47:18] pressure come they want to go back
[47:20] to the comfort zone they don't want to
[47:22] go beyond
[47:23] to see where they called to it is easy
[47:26] to rock back
[47:27] where they were before and even peter
[47:30] and the disciples found themselves in
[47:31] that position
[47:32] after three and a half years with jesus
[47:35] after doing miracles
[47:36] after seeing miracles after seeing power
[47:39] once jesus was no longer wrong they went
[47:43] back fishing to the original thing that
[47:44] they were in
[47:45] that was the easy thing for them to do
[47:48] and he told them i come to call you out
[47:50] of fishing for fish
[47:51] and make you a fisher of men that's what
[47:53] the calling was
[47:54] but those guys fell right back to their
[47:56] comfort zone
[47:57] right back to what they are custom with
[47:59] and it is easy to do that
[48:01] hallelujah it takes effort to press
[48:05] beyond where you are
[48:06] to where you're supposed to be
[48:08] hallelujah and they said the law and the
[48:10] prophets were until john
[48:11] and since that time the kingdom is
[48:14] preached and every man pressed
[48:16] their way into it hallelujah the kingdom
[48:18] itself have to be preached
[48:20] and you have to press your way you have
[48:22] to see yourself moving forward
[48:23] the press is to push hollywood to battle
[48:26] to fight
[48:27] not to sit back and relax to push
[48:29] yourself oh glory to god you don't want
[48:32] to just do
[48:32] and enter in you want to do better you
[48:35] want to do the very best
[48:36] oh glory the god is adored here and you
[48:39] have to bust past that door
[48:40] hallelujah press into the kingdom of god
[48:44] oh glory to god that woman with a blood
[48:46] issue that's what she was doing
[48:47] hallelujah there was a range that
[48:50] that the people was a wrong jesus but
[48:52] she had a need and that
[48:54] need made her push herself she ran out
[48:56] of money her husband tell her to go to
[48:58] that small church
[48:59] she had everything negative around her
[49:00] but she told herself
[49:02] if i could touch the hem of his garment
[49:04] i would be made whole
[49:05] oh glory to god she told herself
[49:06] something sometimes you have to talk to
[49:08] yourself
[49:08] sometimes you have to encourage yourself
[49:10] sometimes they look in the mirror and
[49:11] say listen
[49:12] you're not going are you supposed to go
[49:13] in you have to change your mind you have
[49:15] to change your thinking
[49:16] you have to press and did that woman
[49:18] press she pressed away
[49:19] oh glory to god everybody wrong jesus
[49:22] but she didn't have that kind of thing
[49:24] she didn't come to just hear him she
[49:25] wanted to get a touch she wanted to get
[49:27] an answer she wanted to get her healing
[49:29] she wanted to get to deliverance she was
[49:31] desperate
[49:32] oh glory to god are you desperate
[49:34] tonight because to get certain things
[49:36] from god you've got to be
[49:37] desperate
[49:41] watch he's expecting us a great thing
[49:44] from us because
[49:46] where there's much given there's much
[49:48] required
[49:49] so he is going to require much more of
[49:52] us than he did of the lutherans
[49:56] or the methodists because we walk in a
[49:58] greater light that's why i will reject
[50:00] deadness
[50:01] reject formality and reject the message
[50:04] spirit
[50:04] i got rejected the trinity spirit all of
[50:07] that be getting blasted and busted
[50:09] we want holy spirit oh glory to god and
[50:11] you have to jump out of your
[50:12] human spirit children that spirit
[50:15] whatever spirit
[50:16] i'm coming to the holy spirit there is
[50:18] one holy spirit
[50:19] if it in india africa wherever the holy
[50:21] spirit is one behavior going with it
[50:23] it's the old time holy spirit and the
[50:26] devil won't go near it that's the reason
[50:28] people fear it
[50:29] but it's good enough for me oh glory to
[50:32] god give me that old-time religion
[50:33] it's still all time isn't that right so
[50:36] he said no
[50:37] because we walk in a greater light with
[50:39] a greater power with a greater
[50:41] witness than they had we have a greater
[50:43] witness of the resurrection
[50:45] we have things more firmer than the hand
[50:48] all right hallelujah god
[50:52] doesn't deal with the church just as an
[50:55] organization
[50:56] he doesn't deal with the church as a
[50:58] group of people
[51:00] he deals with the church as individuals
[51:02] so the ministers who try to tell the
[51:04] group
[51:05] that la group is it he is lying to them
[51:09] and deceiving them because god is not
[51:12] dealing with the church
[51:13] as a group he is dealing with
[51:16] individuals
[51:17] in the group oh glory to god hallelujah
[51:20] just as the church can't hold the holy
[51:22] ghost as a group
[51:23] because the holy ghost is poured out on
[51:25] individuals that is why i believe
[51:27] tonight
[51:28] people in their homes could receive the
[51:30] holy ghost tonight
[51:31] not next week tonight because the holy
[51:34] ghost
[51:34] is poured out on individuals hallelujah
[51:37] and even while the world is going
[51:38] forward now
[51:39] you can receive the holy ghost the
[51:41] operation of god could come
[51:42] right in your home so he said watch
[51:46] he deals with the church as individuals
[51:48] each
[51:50] individual in the church so i care about
[51:52] dice
[51:53] less old man fool me i want to make sure
[51:56] it's the word of god
[51:57] is the promise of the hour i want to
[52:00] make sure
[52:01] that this what i'm seeing as a vision
[52:03] even the prophetic vision is the right
[52:04] one
[52:05] i don't want to wake up and say hey
[52:06] because he tells me that did i check it
[52:08] out myself
[52:09] did you switch it out to yourself i'm
[52:10] not explaining this i'm saying all them
[52:12] books and tapes is
[52:13] 50 plus years people have time to figure
[52:15] out what a man preaching if he's off the
[52:16] water or not
[52:18] oh glory to god he deals with the church
[52:21] as individuals each individual in the
[52:22] church
[52:23] and now it's got to our time here we go
[52:26] it's no secret we all see it
[52:28] when a man proves and god loves him
[52:32] he takes him out somewhere to himself
[52:36] dear in the front of angel he does
[52:39] something for him
[52:40] he lifts him up in the presence of god
[52:43] and
[52:44] gives him fills him
[52:47] and sets him out that's the age
[52:50] we are living in so we are living in the
[52:53] age
[52:53] where god could pull a man aside give
[52:56] him
[52:57] fill him and set him out that is the age
[53:01] we are living in the same holy spirit
[53:04] that saved the lutherans that sanctified

[53:23] what
[53:23] the holy ghost is for we know
[53:26] intellectual selves
[53:28] we know our message self and our talking
[53:30] self can't bring the resurrection
[53:31] it will take god himself is the
[53:34] resurrection
[53:35] power is what brought lazarus from the
[53:37] grace he said i

[53:56] understand that that is the voice of
[53:58] power that's the voice authority
[54:00] not even the dead could stay dead when
[54:02] that voice had to speak
[54:03] oh glory to god and what happened christ

[54:28] a resurrection this is the hope of the
[54:30] gospel this is the hope of us christians
[54:32] this is our hope
[54:33] that there is going to be a resurrection
[54:34] if a man dies shall we live again
[54:36] oh glory to god this is our hope that's
[54:38] how we preach that's why we say amen
[54:40] that's what we believe
[54:41] that there is going to be a resurrection
[54:43] but there's going to be a bride they're
[54:44] going to be changed and transformed
[54:46] in this last day change in a moment in a
[54:48] twinkling of an eye
[54:50] oh my hallelujah he said they live in
[54:52] one day he said he said that's what
[54:54] holds them for they'll be resurrection
[54:55] without us they cannot be made perfect
[54:59] now we need it the spirit of god is a
[55:02] standard
[55:03] what is it he was pouring in his spirit
[55:07] all this this go beyond texts and nice
[55:10] teachings and four hours of revelation
[55:12] and mysteries
[55:13] he's pouring in his spirit those who are
[55:16] resting yonder in the grave
[55:18] under the altar of god as the scripture
[55:20] say crying how long lord
[55:21] how long how much longer god is waiting
[55:24] you can imagine that
[55:25] on me on you i don't be waiting on god
[55:28] god is waiting on
[55:30] me and you the church is waiting on me
[55:33] and you
[55:33] adoption time when god can pour
[55:36] into us his fullness his power
[55:40] his resurrection and when the church and
[55:43] christ become so close
[55:45] together till christ become visible
[55:48] among us and raises the dead and we're
[55:50] going to rapture it is simple
[55:52] no complications the word was invisible
[55:56] until it became flesh
[56:00] and the word became flesh and dwelt
[56:03] among us
[56:04] and that was the invisible god become
[56:06] invisible
[56:07] so if this same word become flesh in a
[56:10] bride
[56:11] then the invisible god will be manifest
[56:14] once more just as they saw god
[56:17] manifested in that elijah

[56:29] the fullness of signs and wonders that
[56:31] stunned the pentecostals
[56:32] that same god that same word that same
[56:35] prophecy hanging over your life
[56:37] if that word become flesh that invisible
[56:39] will become visible
[56:41] and when omnipotent speak the miraculous
[56:43] going to take place
[56:44] omnipotence is god veiled all glory that
[56:46] god and god have to be veiled then he's
[56:48] going to be unveiled

[58:54] hallelujah isn't that right and you are
[58:56] sons and daughters and
[58:57] says if i could only with my human voice
[59:00] placed into your heart
[59:01] the importance of receiving the baptism
[59:04] of the holy ghost
[59:06] it will be the most wonderful revelation
[59:09] you ever had in your life
[59:10] you must do it then you talk about let
[59:13] me make it clear
[59:14] about you are not converted and to give
[59:17] that example
[59:18] you talk about peter and peter he had
[59:21] given power to
[59:22] against unclean spirits he was
[59:24] sanctified and jesus said before the
[59:26] three times you deny me he said but i
[59:28] prayed for you
[59:29] and after you were converted then
[59:31] strengthen your brethren
[59:33] he had shouted he probably had danced in
[59:35] the spirit
[59:36] he had done all kinds of things but he
[59:38] hadn't received the holy ghost
[59:39] yet he said after you are converted
[59:42] then strengthen your brethren that's
[59:44] true to carry out his plan
[59:46] go into all the world and preach the
[59:47] gospel isn't that right not word only
[59:50] but through power and demonstrating of
[59:53] the holy ghost
[59:54] making the word of god manifest is the
[59:57] gospel
[59:58] oh glowing up teachings and revelations
[1:00:01] and mysteries no
[1:00:02] that is a seed of the gospel but the
[1:00:04] gospel has taken the same word
[1:00:06] hallelujah and making it manifest oh
[1:00:09] glory to god
[1:00:10] what's the first thing we read men could
[1:00:12] take the scripture and make
[1:00:14] it live hallelujah waiting for somebody
[1:00:16] to anoint it
[1:00:17] and make it live that somebody is you
[1:00:19] who glory to god god call you with faith
[1:00:21] in your heart
[1:00:22] to anoint what is promised to you oh
[1:00:25] hallelujah
[1:00:26] so jesus knew hallelujah that there
[1:00:28] would be a great intellectual move
[1:00:30] just like there was in his days washing
[1:00:32] pots and pans and
[1:00:34] wearing of clothes and turned around
[1:00:36] colors he said wait a minute
[1:00:37] i am not going to leave you comfortless
[1:00:39] i'm going to come again to you
[1:00:41] the works that i do shall you do also oh
[1:00:44] glory to god not the talk that i talk
[1:00:46] but the works that i do shall you do
[1:00:48] also
[1:00:49] the purpose of sending the holy ghost
[1:00:52] was for god to continue to a bunch of
[1:00:54] people
[1:00:55] to continually manifest god to the world
[1:00:58] yes people believe when we share
[1:01:00] scriptures when we share the word
[1:01:02] and god open up the eyes god is
[1:01:04] operating all that too
[1:01:05] but god's purpose is to manifest himself
[1:01:08] to show he is god he has no hands but
[1:01:11] your hands
[1:01:12] you have no eyes about your eyes he has
[1:01:14] no mouth but your mouth
[1:01:15] step forward brethren he want to use you
[1:01:18] or give the lord a shout make yourself
[1:01:20] available to him
[1:01:21] hallelujah the purpose of selling the
[1:01:23] holy ghost
[1:01:24] was for the god to continue through a
[1:01:26] bunch of people to continually
[1:01:28] manifest god to the world that's exactly
[1:01:31] not by a creed
[1:01:32] not by denomination but by the power of
[1:01:34] revelation
[1:01:35] how by making his word real by taking
[1:01:38] his promise like what we're doing
[1:01:40] tonight
[1:01:40] and standing on the cider mind of the
[1:01:43] minority
[1:01:44] and believe in god and watch the black
[1:01:46] skies roll back
[1:01:47] and the power of god moving and take
[1:01:49] over that is what he wants
[1:01:51] that is what the holy ghost will stand
[1:01:53] for that's the purpose he sent it
[1:01:55] to stay on the side of the minority and
[1:01:57] that's what he said when the church has
[1:01:59] grown him
[1:02:00] hallelujah under how the persecution of
[1:02:02] the outside world
[1:02:03] that the holy ghost is just as real as
[1:02:06] it was on the day of pentecost
[1:02:07] how they grown how they travail but when
[1:02:10] they are born
[1:02:11] unpositionally born then god sets in the
[1:02:13] church
[1:02:14] pastor teacher prophet evangelist let
[1:02:15] him fight that oh glory to god we are
[1:02:17] fighting that channel
[1:02:18] we believe the same holy ghost that
[1:02:20] peter had the same holy ghost that paul
[1:02:22] had
[1:02:23] the same holy ghost that the early
[1:02:24] church had we have to have that same
[1:02:26] holy ghost
[1:02:27] oh glory no no modern thing i am the
[1:02:28] message that is the holy ghost oh glory
[1:02:30] to god when i believe i have the holy
[1:02:32] ghost that's a lie that's a baptist
[1:02:34] doctrine
[1:02:34] oh i am the holy ghost that's another
[1:02:36] lie there's a big lie for glory to god
[1:02:39] you have to receive it because he sent
[1:02:41] it oh
[1:02:42] hallelujah what's the holy ghost is for
[1:02:44] he's the purpose of the holy ghost
[1:02:46] that's what god said the holy ghost for
[1:02:48] the power is to give you power
[1:02:50] hallelujah what are the words that's for
[1:02:53] power

[1:02:56] fight with god fight satan and with some
[1:02:58] rhyme or some
[1:02:59] some catch freeze and i can't say that
[1:03:01] power he said give you power what for
[1:03:03] power in prayer you take a person live a
[1:03:05] good life always defeated

[1:03:13] before god she's not defeated
[1:03:15] she comes boldly to the throne of god
[1:03:17] believing she has a right

[1:03:35] damn
[1:03:36] brass face or bold face we don't want
[1:03:38] that it gives you a power of speech
[1:03:40] or when you see when they will feel
[1:03:41] about the holy ghost they say oh and
[1:03:43] she's the one they say where is rabbi
[1:03:44] jones
[1:03:45] where's the fellow where's that
[1:03:47] intellectual giant
[1:03:49] peter they were scared already you know
[1:03:50] but then come out there this is that
[1:03:52] they where their fellas wear them fellas
[1:03:54] who talking all the time buying us with
[1:03:55] coat and wood and widow
[1:03:57] hallelujah they had they had they had
[1:04:00] they had power of speech it's not right
[1:04:02] god's got a little church
[1:04:04] that will move right on with the baptism
[1:04:06] of the holy ghost
[1:04:07] i want to repeat that one god they know
[1:04:10] pentecost because they prophesied
[1:04:12] there'll be a baptism outside of
[1:04:14] pentecostal
[1:04:15] denomination so he's talking about us a
[1:04:18] fresh baptism
[1:04:20] a baptism of god hallelujah
[1:04:23] god's got a little church that will move
[1:04:26] right on
[1:04:27] so when i don't want baptism i know my
[1:04:28] pen because i never knew six you know i
[1:04:30] don't want to put it because i chose
[1:04:31] speaking in tongues
[1:04:31] and i'm not talking about that i don't
[1:04:33] want to be baptism to get this word
[1:04:34] moving
[1:04:36] because moses had all this big
[1:04:38] revelation you know mother telling my
[1:04:39] father
[1:04:40] tell him he read it he studied it hear
[1:04:42] what he promises but nothing happening
[1:04:44] 40 years take off and run because he was
[1:04:47] defeated
[1:04:48] because he never met god he only heard
[1:04:50] intellectually
[1:04:51] but when that light speak to him when
[1:04:54] fire hit him
[1:04:55] hallelujah something happened within him
[1:04:57] that transformed that man altogether
[1:04:59] he knew he had power he knew god was
[1:05:02] with him
[1:05:02] he had confidence to face any situation
[1:05:05] that's what we're talking about
[1:05:06] oh glory to god the devil is a liar
[1:05:08] tonight oh glory to god all your fears
[1:05:10] will be dissolved
[1:05:11] by the pillar of fire by the voice of
[1:05:13] god by the thunder of god
[1:05:15] by your encounter with the supernatural
[1:05:17] your fears will dissolve
[1:05:19] and something going to break into your
[1:05:20] soul of a faith like you never had
[1:05:22] before that's why when the storm was
[1:05:24] raising
[1:05:24] jesus was putting on a hard sleep on the
[1:05:27] boat and when the disciples were singing
[1:05:28] the specials
[1:05:29] and they recognized it not working it's
[1:05:31] still there moving they're still shaking
[1:05:33] with all the specials they're singing
[1:05:35] they say let's wake jesus yes this thing
[1:05:36] is serious because the devil saw
[1:05:38] opportunity to sink all of them
[1:05:40] oh glory to god they didn't make jesus
[1:05:41] jesus always tumbling in the sea
[1:05:43] oh glory to god awaken me but peace be
[1:05:45] still oh glory to god he rebuilt the
[1:05:48] storm
[1:05:48] hallelujah is fair that doing that he's
[1:05:51] all he have little failures rebuilt the
[1:05:53] storm

[1:10:47] here it will just raise
[1:10:48] and bring it forth and all the redeemed
[1:10:51] that touch that spirit
[1:10:52] so actually the bride will have the
[1:10:55] capstone spirit
[1:10:57] i like to bring it as a magnet that
[1:10:59] magnet anointing
[1:11:01] all them in the grave who are elected
[1:11:04] they are already magnetized
[1:11:06] hallelujah so once this bright magnet is

[1:11:31] to god thank you lord jesus
[1:11:33] and after the seas was open and the
[1:11:35] prophet preached the token
[1:11:38] he said that was the message to cap
[1:11:41] the seals that was the captain message
[1:11:44] after all the mysteries after all the
[1:11:47] revelations
[1:11:48] after all the history the messages were
[1:11:50] capped off
[1:11:51] by this particular message the token
[1:11:55] and the token is not doctrine the token
[1:11:58] is not teaching
[1:11:59] the token is the blood on display
[1:12:03] and the blood display like how the blood
[1:12:05] was on the door post and moses time
[1:12:08] but in this time it is the literal life
[1:12:10] of jesus
[1:12:11] jesus christ on display we're not
[1:12:14] talking about talking apply to the heart
[1:12:15] now we're talking about talking on the
[1:12:17] outside
[1:12:18] so the life on the inside began to ooze
[1:12:21] on the outside
[1:12:22] and that's why he said the ministry has
[1:12:24] reached perfection
[1:12:26] when christ is reproduced in the natural
[1:12:29] oh glory to god do you see it now
[1:12:31] hallelujah some minister can say what
[1:12:32] they want and say they've adopted and
[1:12:34] said that ministry and this and that and
[1:12:35] you're not seeing jesus you know
[1:12:36] something is dead wrong he said the
[1:12:38] ministry
[1:12:39] has come to perfection when christ is
[1:12:41] reproduced
[1:12:42] in natural hallelujah now we don't talk
[1:12:45] about pulpit thing we're not talking
[1:12:47] about
[1:12:47] message thing a nice message a nice
[1:12:49] teacher we're not talking about that
[1:12:50] we're talking about the reproduction of
[1:12:52] christ
[1:12:52] oh hallelujah a life
[1:12:56] thundering oh my oh hallelujah the law
[1:13:01] and the prophet saw until john
[1:13:04] almost finished since that time
[1:13:09] the kingdom is preaching and every man
[1:13:12] presented he said every man presented
[1:13:13] not just simply walk into it
[1:13:15] easily it's got to be pressed into
[1:13:18] it's got to be pressed into stay present
[1:13:20] to wherever you are

[1:13:27] in good and he's preaching good and he
[1:13:29] wishes nice not that
[1:13:30] forget that you have to press into
[1:13:34] the kingdom you're passing of the
[1:13:35] kingdom he doesn't control the kingdom
[1:13:37] he doesn't have the kingdom
[1:13:39] you have to press into the kingdom of
[1:13:41] god
[1:13:42] hallelujah almost finish usually it
[1:13:45] takes a state of emergency to thrust
[1:13:46] into desperation
[1:13:48] it's too bad it has to do that but human
[1:13:50] beings are so slothful in their mind
[1:13:52] it takes emergency something arises and
[1:13:55] when they do
[1:13:56] it throws them into a desperation and
[1:13:58] really in doing that desperation
[1:13:59] it brings out the real thing that you
[1:14:01] are it shows
[1:14:03] what you are made up of hallelujah

[1:14:28] distance and you have crying going on
[1:14:30] a mother wailing because a son is dead
[1:14:32] in a house
[1:14:33] that the angel just moved through and
[1:14:36] the prophet dramatized the children
[1:14:38] asking the father daddy
[1:14:39] are you sure are you sure
[1:14:42] we are safe i hear cries down the road
[1:14:44] and the cry is getting nearer and nearer

[1:15:05] time coming back again
[1:15:07] a desperate time time to leave this
[1:15:09] place
[1:15:10] time to leave this world i want to be
[1:15:12] coming back to that again hallelujah
[1:15:14] a midnight time a midnight cry or
[1:15:16] midnight oh
[1:15:18] people lay back in the message they're
[1:15:19] relaxing
[1:15:21] probably say yeah you're relaxing but
[1:15:22] then something going to happen that
[1:15:24] changes everything
[1:15:26] oh my hallelujah
[1:15:29] it was a shaken time did daddy are you a
[1:15:32] short time
[1:15:33] you see when we have genuine love what
[1:15:35] does it do it pushes our feet out
[1:15:37] to the battlefront for god genuine godly
[1:15:40] love for god
[1:15:41] and for his word and for his people will
[1:15:44] push fate
[1:15:44] out dear love just takes a hold of fate
[1:15:48] that is why it's important to understand
[1:15:51] that this faith to put long charity
[1:15:53] is based upon forgiveness if we can love
[1:15:55] the brethren if we can't have genuine
[1:15:57] forgiveness and dropping out
[1:15:58] how could we access this presence and
[1:16:01] power
[1:16:02] and i was sharing how we need the lord
[1:16:04] we really need the lord
[1:16:07] all this coronavirus the kind of
[1:16:08] variants of respect and if any message
[1:16:10] you believe
[1:16:10] that book someone it will knock you out
[1:16:12] we'll kill you
[1:16:14] because it's a judgment that's what it

[1:16:24] we cannot say send it no we want it no
[1:16:27] we would like to have it now
[1:16:28] we are not in charge of that like peter
[1:16:30] he was just speaking
[1:16:32] but the holy ghost fell on them
[1:16:35] the word seed was going out and the
[1:16:37] spirit is here to water that seed
[1:16:38] and make the word spoken made manifest
[1:16:41] and
[1:16:41] put them into the kingdom of god swear
[1:16:44] turn to spirit
[1:16:45] in their life they receive it spirit
[1:16:48] word
[1:16:48] into their hearts out of peter's mouth
[1:16:51] because peter is in the body
[1:16:52] so he's a dramatized son he's a channel
[1:16:56] of god
[1:16:56] hallelujah life is flowing through peter
[1:16:59] eternal life oh glory to god
[1:17:01] joey god's own life fire from of the
[1:17:04] altar

[1:17:08] jesus name yet
[1:17:09] the man never went to one service the
[1:17:11] man listened to one book one tape
[1:17:14] but he had testimony from a living

[1:17:26] cornelius house the text
[1:17:27] of what peter was preaching wasn't
[1:17:29] written yet he was living it out
[1:17:31] hallelujah and the devil had to move out
[1:17:33] oh glory to god this wonderful tonight
[1:17:36] hallelujah but i'm saying god will
[1:17:38] always meet a desperate soul
[1:17:40] he says usually it takes something to
[1:17:42] drive us into that to that despair
[1:17:45] to that desperation it takes something
[1:17:47] to do it
[1:17:48] james 5 15 the effectual fervent the
[1:17:50] prayer
[1:17:51] of a righteous man of that much the
[1:17:53] effectual favor and prayer
[1:17:54] he said that is desperation where is
[1:17:56] desperation effectual food and prayer
[1:17:58] it's similar to he that committed god
[1:18:00] must believe that he is he's a reward of
[1:18:02] them that

[1:23:45] god heard him he said in the line of
[1:23:48] duty he started to sink
[1:23:50] he failed no matter if you fail
[1:23:53] that don't have nothing to do with it
[1:23:57] we all feel we are fair to begin with
[1:24:01] but we got somebody standing now with a
[1:24:03] strong hand
[1:24:04] who can reach us and take us above the
[1:24:06] water and if you make a mistake

[1:24:34] sister if jesus
[1:24:35] prayingisly how much more have we got to
[1:24:37] pray earnestly
[1:24:38] if god of heaven made flesh had to pray
[1:24:41] earnestly
[1:24:42] then how much more we are still received
[1:24:44] by grace so where are we putting all the
[1:24:46] arrogance that we see
[1:24:47] in this message all the hostile behavior
[1:24:50] all the proud and and so on like that
[1:24:52] and people believe
[1:24:54] that because they have a book or table
[1:24:56] believe this message that
[1:24:58] everything is fine they just made it
[1:24:59] already they are deceived they will
[1:25:01] receive them
[1:25:02] fully deceived they failed to understand
[1:25:06] that those two million people that came
[1:25:08] out of egypt
[1:25:09] wasn't going to make it to the promised
[1:25:11] land yeah
[1:25:13] yeah two million people come out under
[1:25:16] moses tapes
[1:25:17] books and tapes and moses message they
[1:25:19] all say we go in hallelujah they're
[1:25:21] going to the red sea hallelujah
[1:25:23] but they couldn't see the carcass fall
[1:25:25] in the wilderness they couldn't see
[1:25:26] the time begin to unfold and reveal the
[1:25:29] unbelief in their system
[1:25:31] they couldn't see the god that sees the
[1:25:33] end from the beginning
[1:25:34] saw the next generation moving in they
[1:25:37] couldn't see their children
[1:25:39] is who gonna cross over with joshua and
[1:25:40] caleb they couldn't see that
[1:25:42] their attitudes and their mindset was so
[1:25:44] difficult and tough
[1:25:46] that god said you know what not one of
[1:25:47] them going over the children will go
[1:25:49] over
[1:25:50] the children will cross over hallelujah
[1:25:53] it's god we serve
[1:25:54] i think the last message we preach on
[1:25:57] talk about ezekiel 9
[1:25:59] about the incon writer and you know what
[1:26:02] the bible says
[1:26:04] start in my sanctuary
[1:26:08] and then they begin at the ancient men
[1:26:10] before the house
[1:26:12] before destruction struck the city
[1:26:15] before destruction strike los angeles
[1:26:18] before destruction strikes the world
[1:26:20] he was stacked in his house to the very
[1:26:23] people who claim to believe him
[1:26:25] love him and serve him he said begin at
[1:26:27] my sanctuary
[1:26:29] judgment actually begins right there and
[1:26:32] from there
[1:26:33] it goes out begin at my sanctuary
[1:26:37] this is not a game this message is not a
[1:26:40] plea thing
[1:26:41] this is the word from the lord and the
[1:26:43] word of the lord came unto me saying
[1:26:45] oh glory to god when that word come that
[1:26:48] word can fail
[1:26:49] because that word is god oh hallelujah
[1:26:52] thank you jesus but abraham says
[1:26:56] the people had their own camp but they
[1:26:59] had to change the kyam grunge
[1:27:00] in order to see the supernatural when
[1:27:03] god deal with the people for many years
[1:27:05] god is not in the camp anymore
[1:27:07] because they made themselves a self-made
[1:27:09] camp not god's
[1:27:10] camp of his word a camp of their own
[1:27:13] he had to leave them for he is the word
[1:27:16] and he
[1:27:17] cannot stay where people are taught out
[1:27:19] of the word
[1:27:20] every group that off the word god can
[1:27:23] stay there
[1:27:24] yes they acknowledge and this and god
[1:27:26] prophet he move out already
[1:27:28] because god in the world is the same
[1:27:29] that's why he says say what the tape say
[1:27:32] don't say with no cuckoo revelation no
[1:27:34] new revelation some revelation the
[1:27:35] prophet did not bring
[1:27:36] and it's song and good but it's not the
[1:27:38] scriptures it can match
[1:27:40] all from genesis to revelation
[1:27:42] hallelujah so i be able to stay with
[1:27:43] this
[1:27:44] hallelujah who vex lost glory to god
[1:27:48] i'm gonna close if you are not in the
[1:27:52] kingdom of god
[1:27:53] press into it surely i would have
[1:27:55] knowledge of what i'm speaking of
[1:27:57] god would never honor my prayer to do
[1:27:59] what he does and you're outside the
[1:28:01] kingdom
[1:28:01] seek christ as your refuge now oh my
[1:28:06] you say man press into it you don't just
[1:28:08] turn around and say
[1:28:09] pick me up by the color lord push me in
[1:28:11] you press into it
[1:28:12] you get desperate between life and death
[1:28:15] oh my
[1:28:16] you begin to play something i'm done
[1:28:18] tonight and this is what i
[1:28:20] had to share with you tonight oh glory
[1:28:22] to god the purpose that god sent
[1:28:24] the holy ghost he said he's waiting for
[1:28:26] the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:28:29] when god will make himself known oh my
[1:28:32] for 50 years god has made himself known
[1:28:34] by
[1:28:35] scriptures by text by revelation by the
[1:28:36] word
[1:28:38] since the prophet have lived but we're
[1:28:40] talking about
[1:28:41] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:28:44] sons of god
[1:28:46] when god will make himself known when
[1:28:48] they will stop sickness
[1:28:51] they will stop cancer they will stop
[1:28:54] diseases
[1:28:54] do you think can say something the bible
[1:28:57] said there will come a time when men
[1:28:58] will rot
[1:28:59] right in their flesh and the buzzers
[1:29:01] will eat
[1:29:02] off the carcasses before they even die
[1:29:06] cancer is a two take to what's coming
[1:29:08] but remember that horrible thing was
[1:29:09] forbidden in that day
[1:29:11] to touch those who are the seed of god
[1:29:13] that's what we are striving for
[1:29:15] now to get in and be positionally placed
[1:29:19] into the kingdom of god
[1:29:21] before these horrible plagues strike
[1:29:23] kona virus
[1:29:25] that's not the end is how much plague is
[1:29:27] coming
[1:29:28] it have words coming that is just a tip
[1:29:31] of the iceberg
[1:29:32] that the lord could show what he can do
[1:29:35] what he can allow what he can permit
[1:29:37] what he can show to man with all his
[1:29:40] intelligence and in all his science and
[1:29:42] all the technology
[1:29:43] he can show that something that your
[1:29:45] eyes can't see
[1:29:47] hallelujah is affecting people affecting
[1:29:50] lives and all along you see
[1:29:52] masks all over the world because people
[1:29:56] don't want to get this
[1:29:57] virus since he says oh glory to god
[1:30:01] but there is another there's a
[1:30:03] inoculation of the holy ghost
[1:30:06] that god wants to give oh to whosoever
[1:30:10] will who wants it
[1:30:11] who wants the holy ghost tonight who
