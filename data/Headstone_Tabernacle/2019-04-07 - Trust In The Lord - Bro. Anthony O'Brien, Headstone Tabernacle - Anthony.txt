the Gideon over any man that song service this morning a man pre-scored inspired and you feel the practice of God here Thank You musicians so much god bless you a man so now without further delay I just want to go to the wood now if you have your Bibles we'd like to turn to a couple portion of Scripture I have two readings this morning and firstly I want to go to the book of Proverbs chapter 3 and then then after I want to get to Ephesians in man but let's go to chapter 3 Reverb chapter 3 and when I read from verses five and six it says trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths as tell over to Ephesians one also and we want to read from verse 11 their visions 1 and verse 11 says in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that he believed he was sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory and God a blessing to the ring of his word I just bow our heads now and as we want to talk to him just for a few moments Heavenly Father Lord we Lord thank you for the privilege father to be gathered here Lord in this spot of ground Lord Lord we know that it's your voice that has called us at this time and season Lord Father Lord no man could come and Nestor the father draw him so we feel drawn to your presence this morning no we thank you for your presence that is here among us Lord Lorie see the praise upon the lips of your saints this morning lord of the atmospheres filled with your glory we thank you for it father only you could have done this loan in an evil age such as this father you call a people to righteousness lon so father we thank you for your grace Lucy upon our lives now we thank you for the time I worship Lord now as we enter into the Woodlawn me a presence trapped down in a special we Lord Father and speak to our hearts Lord father Lord like you would speak out I'm in the cool of the evening Lord we invite your presence to come in here and blow through here priests gone father me unknowing just people father me a blessing me speak to their hearts Lord father Lord I give myself over entirely to your hands Lord father that you could use me your Lord father whatever you have to see me and see it this morning know me a quality or will and to your poopers father lord of me a bless their hearts of your children Lord you know what we have need of today provide our every need father by the word of the Living God grounded Almighty God now we pray and ask it one more time for your presence in leading in Jesus name Amen and amen praise God he may have his seats him in preschool are you happy to be the house of the Lord this morning certainly a privilege to be gathered in his name to feel his spirit all around us amen amen I said you want to ppreciate but Isaac of in last week and a message a man worries me I am undone amen and it just brings us to a reality of condition and all flesh is as filthy rags in the sight of God and now we need more of him this morning we're not afraid to acknowledge or littleness this morning how low we are how much we need him among how much he needs us this morning to surrender ourselves completely to his word and to his will and to his purpose because there's something he's trying to achieve and because he has a plan and because he has a program on an order he can't have rebels in his kingdom he can't have people who are free thinkers he's got to have people who could use people he could talk to a witness that he could lay his hand upon and say here is my spirit flowing freely he's got to have some brother some sister who's got compassion enough and like the Prophet said compassion is not feeling sorry for somebody but compassion is to be the ability to do the will of God somebody that he could use this morning to do his will and to do his purpose somebody who has a heart this morning so this spirit of God this morning is moving throughout the earth and he's looking for hearts this morning he's looking for lives this morning that wants to be changed that want to be transformed that are not comfortable at where they are that are not satisfied with just a sprinkle that are not satisfied with just a little dash of blessings but they want a shower of blessings this morning because there's a shower of blessings shower blessing we need that's promised in this scripture and it's promised for you this morning it's done to you and to your children it's unto you until your family and as many as a lord or God shall call oh there's a reason to shout this morning there's a reason to worship this morning there's a reason to praise God this morning Oh hallelujah amen any man glory be to God hallelujah Eman so have a title this morning amen my title is trust in the Lord trust in the Lord and I'm gonna take my time because I you know I feel like this kind of needs to be not rushed again so maybe just meditated on but that would trust is just about five letters but it's a big word it's very big you know and we live in a world where it's hard to trust people sometimes you don't know who to trust I worked in a company one time and one time the manager somebody calling the phone and I was like yeah sure and whatever so and then I hung up and then they asked the question who is that so they want a certain product or service or something and when I call they get that number I felt like I was being one interrogated a mess for taking the phone call you know legitimately wanted something from the business but you know they just wanted to know where this call came from you know they wanted to kind of monitor and track you know the activity I guess whatever its to marketing or to with a mouth but it just felt I sold it you know I felt interrogated at the time because you know I'm you know just I didn't mean to take the call let's take the call you know but he asking where this person come from you know who do they hear about us you know that kind of thing and you know they had their ways and so on and you know and they want to just make sure that things was all right and people wasn't commenting and random off the street you know because they had assets to protect they had a you know investments they had their thing going on and they didn't want to feel like their security was being breached by intruders isn't there a praise God we live in such a world like that where we where we where we it's hard to trust because man is in his fallen condition and a heart of man we know is corrupt it's desperately wicked it's doomed to failure it's doomed to fall but for Jesus this morning we'd be doomed to fall we'd be doomed to failure nothing that we do in our laptop could ever attain what God has in store for us but it's because he died he made a way for us to come back to the perfection that we once knew but had he not done that there is nothing that you could do in your natural ability to ever attain Christ but because he loved us he reached out to us because he loved us his love projected itself and that love took on a form that love to go to face and that face was Jesus that love had a voice and that point said Peter come and you come Phillip come pitch you to come come unto me all that I heavily laden and I'll give you rush oh do you want rest this morning do you want help this morning do you need shelter this morning it's in Jesus it's in the Savior don't worry about anybody tries to point you to a certain group or to a certain belief or to a certain thing hope is in Christ belief in God in his word that's the only way out outside of that is just man-made systems man-made ideas because it's not written in his word anywhere that is flesh that flesh will glory in his presence no no no anytime someone's pointing you back to the flesh it can't be that it has to be the word it has to be what he says and that's what we are trusting in this morning not in our own understanding not in our own interpretation not in our own idea not in our own opinion but we want to trust entirely in the Lord this morning because outside of him there's no way out outside of him there's no rapture for the church but because he died he made a way and he rose on the third day as the firstfruits of them that slept to prove that there is a way out that there's coal appear as action that is gonna be a rapture the evidence Oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God and what we see or to make a church not a make a revival what we see or to put every soul into action what we see or the get us desperate what we see all together sprayed up what we see or to get us on fire what we see oughta make us worship or to make a shouts or to make us praise God for what he has done for us Oh hallelujah we have never made it if it wasn't for him Oh hallelujah hallelujah do you believe in this morning man is finite man is measured number than these is nothing hallelujah but God is eternal and it's word is eternal so therefore if God is eternal and it's word is eternal we are only about adoption time then how are we to trust in this God of the universe how are we to trust in this core of the heavens how are we to trust in his ways trust in his word it might sound simple this morning but it's a big way God wants the church you love him prophet said soon not if he to love him you gotta trust him you gotta trust that things will be okay even when it doesn't look like it's going to be okay you're still trusting in something a higher wind a higher power a higher purpose a higher program hallelujah it's so good to trust in Jesus when all the world fails when all our minds fail and all our achievements feel when all that we've tried to do fails God cannot fail when our family fails what our friends fail God cannot fail he is his word or what he promised he'd be with you no I'll be with you always even to the end of the earth no other friend like Jesus no other lover like Jesus he's a lover of your soul this morning he woke you up this morning it wasn't your alarm clock but Isaac alarm clocks never woke nobody up but you had a soul inside of there that caught predestinated before the foundation of the world God has a purpose for you this morning trust in the Lord believing alone hope in God I had an interesting experience yesterday I went to the mechanic and uhm it's funny I am I went there with a problem and then when I left I realized that the problem wasn't fixed you know and I knew that because I was I'm accustomed driving my car so I I think I kind of know how it feels so I left the shop and I said well thank you no I paid the money and everything and I left and after I was driving I was like this doesn't feel right so I I said I got to go back because I didn't get what I wanted I'm not satisfied with you know my service so I went back and I said you know I'm still getting the same problem you know and sometimes I feel like that's how we feel in life sometimes we come for an answer for something and maybe we get a little encouragement along the way but maybe it's not enough maybe that certain thing isn't fixed yet you know it's wrong but you're trying to pretend like it's okay the light is blinking you're ignoring it but you need to go to the mechanic you need to get a checked out don't be satisfied with a halfway performance in your Christianity when you tumble the engine you wanna feel it raw you wanna know that you caught the extra to make it to glory I wanna know that I've done all I can to make it to glory I wanna know I've got what it takes I've made the requirements I've got the Holy Ghost whatever it is that God is asking of us we've got to have it friends it's something else and you know when it's wrong you know and it feels kind of funny in the first gear mash down is just not right you're asking up the engine and it's just not doing what it's supposed to do you're trying to pray in it feel like you hitting a wall somewhere raise up your hand to worship but feel a little condemned you need a mechanic this morning oh need somebody to check you out check out your insides see how you're moving see how you're flowing test it a little bit try it a little bit shake it a little bit do something crazy oh yeah now let's see somebody buys a car they buy a car hypothetically all right $100,000 150 or something you know maybe the back showroom and they love that kind of the car drive around in it that's a little space you know it's a little gospel music you're in your zone a man so if you like your value you value this thing because you can't really get around much and it's kind of expensive to travel these days so it makes sense but now you have to now trust this vehicle that you paid your money with to a mechanic and you have to trust that this guy knows what he's doing this how much have a hundred thousand vehicle or whatever you have to know put it in his hands and say I don't know what to do and that's a big level of trust because in an investment you made for you and your family or whatever you're benefiting from and you're hoping you're praying that this guy knows what he's doing it's nothing so that's kind of how I felt he meant and I and I sat over the bonnet looking at him doing his thing and he and he started yanking stuff out yeah it's tough my heart is in my hand I'm just pulling our tubes he's unhooking this moving that moving that moving that he was saying there's something down there we need to get to he moved the battery out he pulled the poles out rip this out pulled a blow out he said in this house ago that has to go leave a nice idea half my engine is laying on the ground until he got to the source then he took a big drill and he kept going and he didn't stop until he pulled out a tiny little that was just busto a good way this is warning to him you need a new one and he replaced it and guess what when he was put in the back he knew where every piece was he knew where every piece was he wasn't worried he wasn't afraid he knew what he was doing he had the experience the knowledge to know where to put what and today I'm saying that Jesus has he experienced this morning to know where to put what sometimes he's yanking stuff out in their life don't worry just trust him he knows what he's doing this morning he's trying to get to the source of your problem this morning sometimes it's deeper than you think sometimes it's deeper than you feel but it's a problem but he knows this morning how to get it out this small sometimes you take a trial sometimes they take a test some then take a rebuke sometimes they take a correction sometimes he passes to the fire some to the flood but all through the blood all his sons and daughters in order to pass through they've got to be tested they've got to be proven to be the right kind of a son to be the right kind of a doctor that he could say here is my spirit flowing freely trust it's a really big word God wants the church to trust him trust that he'll take over we always talk about that story with butter Branham when he was a guy it's not right and he was a training tracker he knew his way around the woods he knew his way around the forest he knew where to go how to feel the tree and no way it was and different things is not right but it got to a point where he realized that he couldn't lead himself no more because he went around and he'd come back to a point that he recognized it was the same point he was making a circle but he still kept telling himself it's okay I'll make it out and he kept going on again and he came back to the same point he said the Indians call it the death walk and some people make the death walk in their lives making circles going around and around thinking that they're okay like what Isaac said last week but you're not okay you need help you need deliverance you need salvation you need a repentance you need that guy this morning you need somebody to take you by the hand and show you where to go because we don't know the way we have not been this way before but we are leaning on the everlasting arms this morning to show us how to get out of here this world is so full of evil that it's impossible jesus said unless that these are shortened no flesh would be saved but for the elects sake he will shorten those things and for your sake this morning because of who you are God said shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do because you are who you are God has to show you certain things so that the pride is not caught unawares but I should be ready when the bridegroom comes Oh will your lamps be trimmed and burning Brides oh when he comes brother you got to be ready you got to be prayed up you got to be on fire you got to be looking you got to be hungry you got to be testing hallelujah got to be making preparation for the angel to come in your home in your community in your life in your family this morning [Applause] [Music] got to be ready there has to be a way prepared for him to come look at Jesus he couldn't just roll in God ordained John a witness to cool before and to make a path straight that the Messiah could come through he said I am NOT the one I am baptizing only with water but it's coming one who shall surely visit you with fire he's gonna baptize you with the Holy Ghost he's gonna change you my ministry is only to prepare you for his coming my ministry is only to prepare you for what's about to take place the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord hallo Leute make every Valley low oh this later root of the tree I can imagine Chan out there preaching isn't that right but over McDermott has it many times John so Whitney with the Hezekiah obadiah's around there was just this man called John Ethan while locusts and honey in the backside of the desert but God calling for purpose God calling for witness God calling for a specific thing to do honey I might have looked funny to the world hello but John hallelujah was trusting in the Lord he wasn't trusting in what the Pharisees were saying nothing what the Sassy's were saying nothing what the sexes were saying the scribes or whoever prays didn't matter what kind of church they were having didn't matter what kind of service they were having on Sunday John had one message repent and be baptized oh the king is coming repent and be baptized Oh Hollis somebody is coming something is about to happen something is about to take place the anointing is about to strike the church something is about to happen get ready get ready get ready interesting and we are saying this morning get ready this morning something is about to happen something is about to take place the power of God is about to strike the church Oh will you be ready when the bridegroom comes be ready you caught up with him don't get caught with your work undone because behold I come quickly my reward is with me to give every man according to his work so you got to be working in this kingdom the Bible says he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him is now diligently seek the Lord while he may be thrown and call upon him while he is near the Bible also says make your calling and election sure so there's no scripture this morning for laziness in the kingdom of God there's no scripture this morning for slothfulness there's no scripture this morning for halfway for lukewarm huh is not he said I ran in a hot or cold but if you're lukewarm I'll spew you out of my mouth Oh Alleluia God wants you on fire or not on fire make up your mind hallelujah hallelujah or walk away praise God but I know this gospel is true praise God and I'll serve him with all my heart I'll serve him with all my soul hallelujah Holocaust in the Lord and lean not on your own understanding David said put not your trust in Princes horses chariots where there is no help imagine a man like the evening he's a king and yet he is saying my hope is in the Lord my trust is in the Lord yea I have chariots yea I have horsemen I have soldiers there are people at my beck and call but yet with all of that I recognize a voice I recognize a power a serenity that is higher than even my own throne and I'm willing to subject myself I'm willing to surrender myself to this power I'm willing to trust in this power oh I'm willing to believe in this power David said I look unto the hills from whence cometh my help my help cometh from God all we trust in too much frivolous things sometimes we need to turn our attention upon Jesus and trust in the Lord that he who made a good work he who started the work in you is able to complete it to the end that he who brought you out of darkness into his marvelous light he that called you from the Baptist Church from the Catholic Church he that called you out from the world he is able to keep you he is able to keep your feet from falling he is able to make a way for you trust in God this morning trust him for your family trust him for your finances trust him to make a way out trust him for your daughter trust him for your son trust him for your life trusting him for your husband in everything acknowledge him Oh give him a praise offering right now [Applause] [Music] the 11 this one Oh hallelujah I love the word of God the word is enough for me it's enough it's gotta be enough for you it's gotta be enough for you that you don't have to worry about anybody else or anything else so what other people say but you're trusting in the Lord it's enough for you to keep you when things don't go right there's somewhere you could turn to oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah hallelujah David said there's a river streams whereof shall make a city of God though a thousand fall in my right hand of ten thousand on my left shall not come nigh thee only with that I shall shall behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the law which is that habitation to help he is a present help in time of trouble oh-oh we need him we need him we need him every hour we need him every moment oh honey of every day hallelujah you know the shepherds the Shepherd's they they keep the flocks the Bible relate speaks about Shepherd's a lot and especially the Old Testament and different things and Jesus made reference to shepherds you know we think about sometimes Oh shoppers they take the Sheep far out grazing sometimes and you know they are there grazing and bleating and so on sometimes a shepherd would look up into the horizon and there's an oncoming storm sometimes it's it's too far to get back to the to the pen so sometimes a shepherd to take the flock and it would carry them up into the high a high part under a rock and a cleft of a rock sometimes that's the only escape that there is from the oncoming storm and under day might Kindle a fire they might run rally the sheep around the fire and keep warm just until the storm blows over and how precious it is to have a place a safe haven that a shepherd could go with his sheep hallelujah and fine rest and find refuge from the oncoming storm no wonder David's had lead me to the rock that is higher than I when my heart is overwhelmed when the storms are raging when the lightnings flash when the thunders roar Jesus lead me to the rock take me in the cleft of the rock in there hide me in your presence hide me in your bosom sometimes it's the only safe place you could go Oh hallelujah when King Uzziah died I say oh as expose he couldn't go to the psychiatrist he couldn't go to the therapist he couldn't go to his friends he couldn't go to his family they didn't have no answer he couldn't help him but I see a new one place that he could go where he could finally answer for what he was looking for and I say I ran into the temple and they got caught up in a vision see the power of God moving back and forth the post booth what a vision some people come to church first show so we become the church just to make up space but that wasn't Isaiah that's not you this morning we come the catch of vision our vision is greater than us a vision to inspire to wake us up out of our folly and say woe is me I am undone I need your help Lord I need your strength Lord I need your guidance law I can't make it without you I didn't make it this far without you and I can't go on without you oh not the way you feel this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we hid the surrender we hid a let go and let go amen now there's two kinds of trust that I want to speak on that's the trust we haven't gone it's not right and there's also the trust that God places in us I want to speak on out as well because in the beginning God had a man he could trust my name Adam isn't alright says I give you dominion over the fowl of the air the fish of the sea I give you power over every creeping thing God trusted in this man so much that when he was finished he turned about his tiny balcony arrest a man is that right he was able to turn his back and leave man to run and rule things he was able to come down in the cool of the evening just to get a report on how things were doing and how he did this and how he moved that and how he changed this color hand I named this animal here there was a man that God could trust trust him with his woman trust him with power trust him with authority how could he trust this man because he had the same nature he had the same likeness like this man and he was a perfect reflection of God on the earth when God looked down you see himself and God had no problem to trust this man with power and with glory people said who is man did you have crowned him with glory and power what is man that thou art mindful of him there's something about you this morning that's very very special and a devil's job is to try to make you not see that so we're trusting in our eyes what we could see trusting in our ears what we get here but we're not trusting on God we're not leading away from our own understanding it's now looking at the opinions of others rather than what God has to say about it but God's Word is above that above all pinions above what people think above ideas above above any potentate any sovereign throne above all of that it's a word of God no matter what law man makes God's Word is above it this morning so therefore the law of sin and death that dwells within your members it's trying to keep you down this morning it's trying to keep you from praising it's trying to keep you from worshiping then this morning there's a higher law the law of the Spirit which is life in Christ Jesus that is here to set you free this morning from the law of sin and death there's a higher law this one hallelujah hallelujah priest goodie man huh so God had a man Iike trust isn't that right and that man forfeited doctrines it's now right you gave up the word and he received an interpretation of how to multiply and replenish it's not right what the devil thought it was he shall not surely die and him a man and down went the whole nature because so much was entrusted in this man's hand and when he fell it all fell upon a lion would lay with the lamb but when that took place it was a different scene it was chaos it was wall it was famine there was strife there was sickness there was politics there was confusion Burana brought out hearty atmospheres filled with sin filled with with with pollutant in the atmosphere in the spirit world isn't all right but when that holy time come when go to cleanse the earth with fire all that gonna get cleanse away all that's gonna get cleared away John said I beheld and saw a city coming down from God out of heaven adorned as a pride for a husband Oh hallelujah a beautiful city a city with streets of gold a city with Jesus in it where the lamb is the light Oh hallelujah hallelujah that's a promise we have this morning brother when I think about that promise it makes me wanna shout hallelujah thank you Jesus there's something worth living for this morning there's something worth time for this morning this humming wood praying for this morning there's something to get excited about there's a promise beyond ky there's a promise of a new heaven a new earth a new system a new order Ohana all of this pain pills will be over with all of this sin will be over with oh I know sit here where the lamb is the light Oh hallelujah there's no sickness in that city so don't you worry this morning I don't care how you feel parts gonna heal you because you're not going in that city in this condition no no he will wipe every tear from your eyes every frustration every depression you going through it's not worthy to be compared with the glory that's about to be revealed in US Court has called the people out for his name's sake city is not to remain empty but that's for you to walk in it exercise this morning practice this morning practice your walk practice you talk it's a highway to heaven practice loving practice forgiving practice repenting why because they're going to a city whose bacon pillars call or keep a lot of shouter pray yes sir yes sir could you imagine could you imagine every prophet walk the earth seeking a city whose making below is God they were dressed in priests gone all tattered rags sometimes I need a stick in their hand sometimes they were just traveling through but they were not from here they were not seeking anything glory they were not seeking any riches of this world their riches was in heaven holiday came with the wood over the Lord they came with the word of Almighty God that's what they trusted in that's what they rested upon the holy prophets and apostles stood for the truth Oh hallelujah praise God a meddler or here we are 2019 the pride of Jesus Christ Oh hallelujah standing upon that same word that the prophet said upon the apostles sit upon they longed to be here in this age but we are here this morning and we are trusting in this we are trusting what put a pranam said the prophet of this age Oh what he said shall come to pass a man is now right he said I'm only building I'm only laying a foundation for short quick message that's gonna shake the whole nation let's go to shake Europe shake Trinidad shake Africa oh it won't be long but it will be Oh hallelujah so we know today the devil is a liar that the devil's finish his time is over his time is about up the Bible says he has a short time to work but when his time is finished it's finished there's no more he could - so he's doing all he could do now because when that time comes it'll be a different thing when that which is perfect is come that richness isn't Pop's will be torn away which there will be a pride on the earth who will not be moved she will not be shaken she will not be destroyed she will be trusting in God she will do nothing unless the father sure Oh [Music] Halloween or give him praise or give him praise or give him praise Lord of her us to trust him sometimes you have to go through stuff sometimes gotta learn to trust him doesn't happen overnight acknowledge him in all your ways he shall direct thy paths so there's a there's a path that you have to take is now and God knows the way David even said thy word Oh Lord is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path so has that path again and the Word of God is acting as a lamp now just picture it all around the world is darkness everywhere is talk sometimes you can't see your hand in front your face so dark but the word is a lamp unto your feet if that don't make you shout I don't know what will and you know it's interesting because it's not a floodlight we'd like a floodlight that sounds really good but then where's the trust in there because you see everything so now there's no need to trust but if it's a lamp it shows you just just enough oh come on it just shows you what you need to know oh don't worry he knows the wing he'll take you to glory but trust him here first and then trust him a little more again and just keep moving forward don't turn around to the left hand no to the right hand just stay with the work and if you stay with that woman that God will show you a continuation of the church glory to God I feel inspired this morning if we stay with this word you're gonna see another vision you're gonna see another book of Acts the sick is going to be healed the blind will see the crippled walk there be more sons and daughters adopted like the Prophet was praise we stay with that word pray [Applause] I like until your path Oh hallelujah Jesus said straight to the gate now always doing few there be that find it it's not a highway it's not something you can find on ways Oh Google Maps no it's probably unmarked Road I think Google knows about this sometimes they ask Google who's Jesus and Google said I'm still learning well I don't need that Google who Jesus is I just have to flip through this book here praise God a man well He healed the sick he raised the dead he cast out devils he spoke to the storm praise God he made his tongue quiet praise God hallelujah he did this he did that I don't need Google to tell me when science fails Cortland never fail where technology fails God will never fail he will always be on time he's always there for you light onto your path lamp unto your feet I just love that word this morning he just shows you what you need to know you see because there's so much David said knowledge so high for me I cannot attain it description so much to know and people get caught up in that knowledge puffeth us up people get in the spirit of I know that like to keep going a mystery no need to find out that they have the mystery you got to come to them to figure out the mystery so don't miss Church now and trying to corner people you know like the Bible said II the things are secret they belong to God but the things which are revealed they belong to us they belong to you and if God sent a prophet and we believe he reveal every mystery then what other mystery are you gonna bring for me that the Prophet didn't already revealed there's no new message this is the same message that were preaching this morning there's no new revelation there's no new teacher it's the same God but what he's gonna do he's gonna take his word and make it more positive every single time and that's how he raises a standard so that when the enemy comes to try to shake you comes to try to move you comes to try to deter you your soul is anchored he the word in you it's been raised up inside of you he is making that more positive and you know you're gonna be living and you know you're gonna be here I know you're gonna make it you might see anything around you don't worry about what you see but the word that he gives you trust in that this morning trust in the holy spirit his ability will you first trusted in Christ then when we believe we are sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise [Music] so the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit that seal of God is coming to anoint the face inside of you to let you know that you are standing on the word it's going to anoint the word in your soul and make that live then it's no more than letter but the Spirit is now giving it life then you don't have to tell you the worship but the Spirit in you you lift your hands up the spirit in you you can't help it there's a fire in your heart that's burning and his name is Jesus and he bought you with a price and in you speaking back thou art the Son of God that's what I want that's what I come for this morning nothing short of a genuine experience of the Holy Ghost Halle hallelujah is knowledge where it speech and virtue and knowledge and temperance oh no Senora for us to trust him yes sir we have to go through some stuff sometimes not easy but that's the only way you could get us to trust him Abraham was told a promise your name is Abram I called you Abraham father of Nations you're gonna have a son what a pronouncement but Abraham didn't know that would it take a long time for that to take place God spoke that and went away for what 25 years or so it's not right and Abraham had to believe what God said will come to pass and every day he woke up he looked the same you feel the same but the word was also still the same huh Sarah looked the same that's Sarah how you feeling this morning well I'm still old and cranky praise God so nothing changed you said that's okay the wood is still gonna come to pass we're still gonna have a son Oh hallelujah come hell or high water that would remain the same they made their mistakes different things took place but God was still in control God was still gonna get the glory out of his story but Abraham had to trust that God would do it and he know that call would do it even when to talk to said Abraham me too old your wife is too old what are you doing Abraham said I heard from God nothing can move me he counted everything else as though it were not hallelujah praise God and I promise would remain true that promise would remain sure Halle Abraham had Isaac before yeah Liza because the revelation I was in his soul was Isaac in the favor ahem he knew it gotta happen then one day one day Here Come three men walking down the dusty road it's a desert there's nobody like there's nobody if three men come walking down a dusty road there's a visitation on its way this morning it might be dry and hot in your life but get ready for visitation hallelujah if you see the first time of the supernatural you run this one hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah get ready because somebody fix or not happen so we fixin to take place Oh hallelujah and here they come praise God he invited them in and he eat any fellowship then they spoke and I'm saying I'll surely visit you at a time of life Sarah's in a tent she's overhearing this conversation and she laughed within herself isn't there a and hey speak wide Cyril laughs she was shocked hallelujah a team spirit discerning are very hard knowing that there's doubts in there but no matter how much zero doubted God still predestinated her to bring forth that promise son and I don't care how much you doubt this morning you don't believe that it might happen it don't matter it's okay God still pronounced a blessing over your life that not even you could remove don't try to figure it out don't try to match it up God is going to make it come to pass he'll make it work together for your good to them that love call under them that I'll call according to his purpose glory to God so don't you doubt its trust and believe me man I want to read something here from the Prophet said a message called leadership and he said this remember this that each one of us young and old your first step that you ever made in your life he said someone had to lead you that's right and your last step you ever make someone will be leading you it's now right someone has to lead and he said God has liking us unto sheep and if anyone knows anything about or knows about raising sheep and the nature of sheep why you know that a sheep cannot find his way around that he has to be led even in the slaughter pens and we find that they bring that sheep in there and that he's led up into the slaughter by a goat and a goat leads him up and then when he gets up to the end of the day of the shoot he jumps out and the Sheep goes right on into the slaughter so we find that a sheep cannot find his way around he said now I remember experience I had is one time he said I was a state game warden in Indiana and I had I had been out in the field and I heard something the most pitiful cry and he said it was a little lamb had lost his mama and he couldn't find his way to her and the mother couldn't find her way to the little lamb and I picked the little fellow up and how quiet he laid against me and I went along there my hands holding little fellow and crying and I heard him how he just snuggled his little head down against me and it seemed like he knew that that I was going to help he said the Prophet said I thought all Rock of Ages cleft for me pick me up in the arms of the Lord Jesus just be content as I know I'm going home to be with my loved ones I thought that at the end of my life's journey Lord just bring me into your arms Lord just like that he said that I know I'll be carried across the river then they on the other side where there be no more sorrows and sicknesses and things that I'll be loved with the loved ones that I've loved isn't alright it was a prophet picking up a lamb and so tender and so vulnerable and that's how we are in the arms of God sometimes we think we know it all sometimes our knowledge put us up on a pedestal almost or maybe we put other people up on a pedestal trusting in them instead of trusting in the Lord trusting in your hopes your dreams trusting in your ability or maybe own achievements but not trusting in the Lord enough for him to take you into his hands and to guide you and to lead you jesus said unless you be like a little child you can no wise enter into the kingdom of God you know sometimes I was driving in my car I'm driving Eden to school and she's in the backseat sometimes she's just quiet staring out the window and I thought my God how innocent she's trusting that I'm not an evil person and I'm not gonna do any harm and I'm not gonna do her wrong she's just trusting she can't lead herself she can't carry herself to school she can't carry herself to the road or wherever she's trusting that whoever in charge knows what they are about and that what faith is all about this morning a trust in God that he is able to make a way out for you that in every temptation he makes a way of escape but then that love him Oh hallelujah for his loved ones Oh hallelujah Holly just trust and believe this morning and even though the devil trying to shake you try to get into your mind try to tell you can't make it the word stand sure forever and ever there's power in the word this morning to keep you in your trial in your test in your situation the power of the word is able to keep your feet from falling this morning there's power in the world hallelujah isn't the prophet said it's like a policeman he doesn't have power to stop the car but he has authority he might be a scrawny little fellow he might be a four foot five foot something maybe he's a dwarf it doesn't matter if he has on a uniform and he has a badge issued by the government of the country then he's got the authority vested in him as an officer of the law and if he gets out into that road and puts his hand up that car has to stop you have to come out of the vehicle oh because he's backed by the law and that's who we are this morning God is gonna have a people in this landscape whose power the Pope could be in you hallelujah praise call him hallelujah now we know that power is coming but right now you have power in the form of this world here everything that he died for it's written in this book everything that he died for he paid the price for it's belongs to you this morning hallelujah hallelujah and we said on Wednesday night when we were here talking about that lamb and he was stood upon the throne said who is worthy to take the book and to loose the seals thereof and John began to weep John knew that all nature had fallen because a man that was entrusted with his power and Dominion had forfeited it but when he forfeited it he gave up the D to the earth and the devil tried to grab it with his greasy hands but he couldn't hold on to it that title deed didn't stay there but it went back to the hands of the original owner Hollander is not and here was the original owner sitting on the throne he who is ready to loose the seals thereof in this title key to the earth lay our Dominion lay our inheritance lay our promises in this title deteriorate later pop system of the Holy Ghost glory hallelujah hallelujah your family's gonna deliver right in that book your husband your wife your loved one your children whatever you ask for it shall be done until you the authority of the sons of God was leaning it was leaning there I'm John knew it but he couldn't do anything about it the Bible said he wept much it's not right because there was no man found worthy to open the book neither to loose the seals thereof just think about it no in heaven none on the earth none had the right none had the kinsman redeemer shipwrights to do what was required because it had to be one of us it had to be a kinsman redeemer somebody would flesh like us somebody who make mistakes but Jesus made no mistake when he came he came as flesh he was subject to temptation he was something to triumph but here he learned obedience but it sinks he suffered and he came closer to God and he cannot walk talk or work with God I've got to work with him and he said I do nothing unless the father show me and he was used by God though he was tempted though he was tempted saw though he grown with a headache sometimes though he was tired yet and obedience he subjected himself to the Word of God he had power to do whatever he wanted yet he was obedient to the voice of God he walked all over the place and healed one man because he did nothing unless the father show him how was the kind of son he was oh it's not and someone tapped John on the shoulder and said weep not for the Lion of the tribe of Judah had prevailed to open the book and when he turned to look for a lion he saw all and bleeding bloody slain pizza his blood poured out for us his blood poured out for you but that lamb went all the way to the throne and took the book and [Music] John said all in heaven all on the hood I can't praise Cooke hood I can worship and praise and bless His Holy Name O [Music] Jesus and don't praise God because you are power the demons or you're powerless scorpions but praise Him worship Him because your name is written in heaven come temptation come trial come storm you've got to know who you are trusted you've got to know who you are leaning on you've got to know who you are you've got to know your name is written there Oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to call him any man your name is on that book this morning or you couldn't hear the voice of God you couldn't hear the word of God this morning if that name was in that book but praise God he wrote your name and blood he said not guilty he bought you at a price please cause to see his own son smitten upon the cross for attention sake o we ought to praise Him we ought to worship Him we ought to let everything go in his presence this morning how we ought to thank him how we ought to let loose Oh father we praise who we clarify only name worthy is the lamb worthy is the lamb that was slain oh I love you a slain to make a way for you he was slain to make a way for your family he was slain Oh hallelujah your name is on that book don't you worry don't you forget it hallelujah to Revelation Oh you belong you belong in heavenly places you belong at the feet of the master you belong before the throne of God that's where we come from that's what we're going this morning we are not from here we are not from this world don't get tired up with all this natural stuff let loose detach yourself this morning lift up your hands detach yourself this morning give them a surrender Oh hallelujah are they just willing to trust in Jesus just so sweet to trust in Jesus hallelujah hallelujah bill the oaks I think eternal hold to God's unchanging hand if you think about that story but a brown one gave about that slave who was just so different from all the other slaves around I one day a man came by and he said I notice there's something special about that slave he said I want to buy that slave said no he's not for sale he said what make him so different why just see the way he converses way he carries himself he's not slouched around halfway no no no he's upright he's diligent he's industrious he carries himself with a certain level of metal of quality of wood what about that flame and the slave owner said I learn a story from them one time he said that this particular young man is from a particular tribe and then that tribe his father is the king his father is a king and that's why he moves like that and that's why he acts like that and that's why he operates like that he takes different he moves different even though he's a slave just like the rest of them he knows that there's something special about him you think the devil don't know there is something special about you come on now come on now you just move difference you just pray different you just believe different you trash difference oh honey you got the glory of the Lord upon you the glory of the Lord is upon you sister it's upon you brother oh honey you don't care about the world care about the fashions all you care about is see Jesus I want Jesus let me live Jesus let me serve Jesus let me worship Jesus Oh hallelujah Oh when the devil cast his eyes upon the world and upon the people there's a particular ones that jump out at him once you have hitch Oh hallelujah in your trial you praising God listen that that gives the devil of mine battle that gives the devil a headache how you could have fine one reason out of a million reasons why you should not go to church this morning out of a million reasons why you should backslide why you should give up you can still find one reason to give God worship to give God praise one reason this morning and his name is Jesus I got one reason why I oughta shouts why are the tents while to lift my hands why I'm here to celebrate hallelujah Oh appraisin forever oh my oh my hallelujah he may let me continue on quickly here and I know how to wrap up the 11:00 this morning even I'm happy trust in God amen like I said the other night about the hog okay and the sinner prophet said on enticing spirits he said you can't blame a sinner as soon as a sinner don't try to reform him don't try to tell him this or that or the other he's a sinner to begin with he's a pig to begin with there's no right he don't know no different if he goes to the movies and he goes on Sunday and he goes to the ballgames he does all these things he's a sinner to begin with his nature is like a hog the old hawk stick his nose down I'm on your pile and eat all the greens out of it and everything well that well he's a hog you can't blame him he's a hog that's the way with sinners when you go and call yourself a Christian and then stick your nose in with him then you're no better than he is but you're worse come out from among it prophets there let go of the world let go and let God EEMA is all right let go he said how do you let go said so many people are wondering today saying well brother Branham how do you let go you know I he said I heard a lot of theology on it let go and stuff like that he said a lot of people just work up a sweat trying to let go many people come around and say I was going to go on a 40 day fast so I could do something he said you don't need a 40 day fast you need to let go of the world and all these devilish things antique God's Word in your heart you said you've got to be taught how to do that he said in you don't do it by jumping up and down neither do you do it forty day fast you do it by a surrendered heart to all-mighty God what God wants is a surrendered heart this morning someone that he could use not if you could use anything you could use me take my hands take my feet take my body my mind use me Lord as a tool for the harvest oh the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few God wants something someone that he could use this morning why won't you be used by him this morning Oh hallelujah a surrendered heart but all they keep saying all the time dedicated to God is what brings Jesus into present tense a man called will be made visible by a bunch of people who found a secret of surrender who found a secret of humility you want to see real power it's not a pair jumping up and down but it's down on your knees it's where two power lines hallelujah that's where the lamb overcame he said not my will but I will be done right there in the Garden of Eden and your garden of gethsemane sorry the lamb of a king hallelujah true humility what if it's possible let this cup pass from me but yet not my will but thy will be done sometimes you gotta let go and let God have his way in our lives sometimes I feel like the mechanics just pulling things out he's ripping out tubes ripping out stuff don't worry he knows what he's doing you got to trust in him then he's like a doctor he's like a surgeon you've got to trust in him he's got the experience he's used the knife before so you just got to trust him you can't fix it yourself but there's someone who could take care of the problem he's done it before he did it for Joshua he did it for Joseph he did it hallelujah but Jacob he'll do it for you this if you put your trust in him everything will be alright Ohana don't you worry don't try to work up a sweat just let go this morning just trust in him believe that he is able to take out everything out of you that doesn't belong there the great surgeon pulling out meek bitterness pulling out evil pulling out malice pulling out jealousy pulling out Envy pulling out strife Oh hallelujah hallelujah he could do it this morning you don't have to leave this place the same way you come but do you think if you could surrender yourself this morning to the work of the Spirit in your life then he could move among us and you could move in your hearts then you could leave here difference then you could leave here change then you could leave here transform Church ought not to be a place for an emotional workup feel good inspire the purpose was to change us purpose of the wood coming to us wasn't faster just feel good and jump up and down and say hallelujah but you got to be able to walk straight when you come back down from all of that jumping up and hung it's not about the shout South Street you walk when you come back down it's about how much you can trust and apply the word that you've heard apply the world that you know to be true and it takes God the spirit of God a true Spirit of God to overcome even your very own nature this hoc nature that the Prophet talked about Hollis not every man is born with a nature but that nature has to be removed in order for God's Spirit to truly live through us something's got to be pulled out of us and God's Spirit put into us in order for us to truly be change Halle is nice so there's coming a time this morning when it's no longer be jumping up and down but it's got to be a surrendered life there's got to be a life lived though he slay me yet trust him that's what job said after all of the trials after all of the testings after all of the boils after all that this happened and that happened he lost capital he lost property lost this he lost much but he didn't lose his praise he didn't lose his worship he didn't lose his name on the book oh honey I didn't change who he was oh I know your circumstances changed though your situations change God still remains the same and it's bird over y'all still remains the same and his pan over you this morning is love Oh hallelujah Olli put you in a price he made a weight for you now won't you go all the way for him and trust in God I have thing he is able to do what he said he would do is now right a little more I'll finish him Anne said let go see see it's a email that's all right email lost my place here Eman the 11th this morning praise God hallelujah said you don't need a 40-day fast said all you need to do a surrendered heart you do it by a surrendered heart to a mighty go any man that's who he was a man he said it's like a little baby he said I noticed my little baby back there and he said his mother is trying to put his little jacket on him this morning he said he wanted to get his little arm in his sleeve and he said he couldn't you couldn't put his arm in there he didn't know how so he just he said you see you've got to guide his little arm in there he said he wants to get his arm in there but he's just beating all around it he said and he never gets to sleeve he knows he's not in the sleep and so do you know this morning that you're not right with God when you're still backbiting lying doing everything he said you can't be right with God then I don't care how many churches you belong to until your soul becomes converted brother that's old-fashioned Amen that's the old-fashioned gospel don't matter how many churches you belong to no matter how much hands you shake you need a true baptism of the Holy Spirit to give you a new nature to make you walk right to make you talk right to make you cry I take the pill of fire to take you on from here into glory it'll take God's leading you putting your trust in his name that's old-fashioned but that will boil down and put soup in your soul he said that's right try to put his arm in he's got to have someone to direct him in it how to put his arm in he said nobody gets his arm in a little jacket he knows he's all right he said now that's the way it is with every born-again Christian when he really gets into God he watches his life with God's Word and he realizes what is a consciousness now and he realizes he's lined up with every bit of it oh we've got to have that consciousness friends if we're on the street we run a home and if your no job that you're lined up with God's Word wherever you are whenever you are praise God isn't there a man that's what I want priests gone and he knows and he's all right a man is all right when he really gets in God he lines a bit every bit of it he's got long-suffering gentleness quietness meekness power feet love joy peace he ain't tossed about there like a troubled sea he ain't worried about every little thing he ain't jumping hand there like a little bottle stopper no in the ocean but he said his heart is pure his thoughts is pure his intentions are pure that what is that the Holy Ghost still man the Holy Ghost spill woman his thoughts are pure the intentions are pure hallelujah his alternative is right and he knows he's lined up with the word of God and he'll can't move him he's lined by the Word of God he's got divine love purity in his heart for every man and woman he's got he's a stain from the things of the world they're dead to him he don't want them no more a many man it's not right hallelujah hallelujah amen please go on it's a few more cool sound finish preface it encore man he said and so we tonight we want to think on that and remember and in the midst of all this cry God can't send a revival until he's got men in shape to take it we cannot have a revival until we get men God call men not man called men but called call men caught train men Menace not trained up in the schools of theology and enough education but rugged men of faith that God has brought up in the school of his rugged training rocket training hallelujah it's not right you look at soleus going through training sometimes they call into barbed wire trying to move around it'll raise the head up they get caught up in it they could get cut it's rugged it's rough and they
