[24:53] easy kill chapter 9 we want to read 1 to
[24:57] 6 and read in from revelation chapter 7
[25:07] says after these things I saw four
[25:09] angels standing on the four corners of
[25:10] the earth holding the four winds of the
[25:13] earth that the wind should not blow on
[25:15] the earth and on the sea nor any tree
[25:17] and I saw another angel ascending from
[25:21] the east having the seal of the Living
[25:24] God they cry aloud for his to the four
[25:27] angels to whom it was given to hurt the
[25:28] earth and the sea saying hurt not the
[25:31] earth neither the sea nor the trees till
[25:35] we have sealed the servants of our God
[25:39] in defiance and I heard the number of
[25:43] them which was sealed and they were
[25:45] sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the
[25:49] children of Israel revolution eat this
[25:54] one and when he had opened the Seventh
[25:57] Seal There was silence in heaven about
[25:59] his peace of half an hour I won't quote
[26:03] Ezekiel chapter 9 will from verse 1 he
[26:09] cried also in mine ears with a loud
[26:11] voice saying caused them the half charge
[26:13] over the city to draw near even every
[26:17] man with his destroying weapon in his
[26:19] hand and behold the six men came from
[26:23] the way of the high heat which lied
[26:25] towards the north and every man a
[26:27] slaughter weapon in his hand and one man
[26:30] crowed was cluttered with linen with the
[26:33] writers inkhorn
[26:34] by his side and he went and stood beside
[26:39] the brazen altar and the glory of the
[26:42] God of Israel was calling from the
[26:44] cherub
[26:45] funny ones to the threshold of the house
[26:47] and he called to the man clothed with
[26:50] linen which had a writer's ink one by
[26:52] side and the Lord said unto him go
[26:57] through the midst of the city through
[26:59] the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark
[27:03] upon the foreheads of the men that sigh
[27:05] and cry for the abominations that be
[27:08] done in the midst thereof and he unto
[27:11] the others he said in my earring
[27:12] go ye after him through the city and
[27:15] smite let not your eyes spear need a
[27:19] heavy pity slay utterly all and young
[27:23] wood means a little children and women
[27:26] but come not near any man upon whom is
[27:29] the mark and begin at my sanctuary then
[27:33] they began at the ancient men which were
[27:36] before the house may God bless his word
[27:38] you may be seated but tonight is strange
[27:49] what we have to share with you tonight
[27:51] but God is good
[27:53] our title the angel from the east that's
[27:58] the title the angel from the east of a
[28:03] context scripture um Luke chapter 11 are
[28:06] gonna read it out if you want to read it
[28:08] and this is this one Luke chapter 11 and
[28:12] he came the past as he was praying in a
[28:14] certain place when he ceased one of the
[28:22] disciples said unto Him Lord teach us to
[28:24] pray as John also taught his disciples
[28:26] and he said unto them when you pray see
[28:29] our Father which art in heaven hallowed
[28:32] be thy name
[28:34] us worship unto God acknowledge in him
[28:37] his name and thy kingdom come you expect
[28:40] in the kingdom and I will be done in as
[28:43] in heaven so in earth then the requests
[28:47] give us this day my day our daily bread
[28:49] and forgive us our sin
[28:52] what's the condition for we also forgive
[28:55] everyone that is indebted to us and lead
[28:59] us not into temptation but deliver us
[29:01] from evil
[29:02] and he said to them which of you want to
[29:04] get to this which of you have a friend
[29:06] and Charles go on to him at midnight
[29:10] unsealed a.m. friend lend me tree lose
[29:12] for a friend of mine in his journeys
[29:15] come to me I have nothing to set before
[29:17] him and he from within shall answer and
[29:20] said trouble me not the door is now shut
[29:22] and my children are with me in bed I
[29:24] cannot rise and give thee see and I say
[29:35] unto you go listen
[29:37] door he will not rise and give him
[29:40] because he is a friend yet because of
[29:45] his importunity
[29:46] he will rise and give him as many as he
[29:50] needed and that importuning is because
[29:52] of his persistence because of his
[29:55] nagging he will give as many as he
[29:59] needed and then he said this I see on do
[30:01] you ask it shall be given to you seek
[30:05] and you shall find knock it shall be
[30:08] opened unto you
[30:09] for every one that asketh receiveth so
[30:12] you know we put the foot again not now
[30:13] ass kept receiving he that seeketh find
[30:16] it and he that knocketh it shall be
[30:18] opened so he make it clear is not one
[30:21] knock is not one seek is not one ask is
[30:24] ask seek knock it in other words you're
[30:28] keepin on till you get what you have
[30:30] neither because that friend is not a
[30:34] friend is not gonna come off from his
[30:36] bed because he's a friend he's gonna
[30:38] come up because they are a sin that
[30:39] person I have nothing to set before me
[30:41] like that family and I have or that
[30:43] guest that I have I need help I need
[30:46] some bread could you kill me that bread
[30:48] of course I know you're tired I know you
[30:50] had a hard day's work but my friend come
[30:53] from overseas and I have nothing all the
[30:55] stores are closed the restaurants are
[30:57] closed and no you have bread inside the
[30:59] day I
[30:59] by the bakery you can't tell me to have
[31:02] no bread you have bread inside the deer
[31:04] don't lie you have bread inside a deer
[31:06] bring it out I need it I cannot move it
[31:09] I stay in here you can meet me any
[31:13] morning Oh glory to God your hair as in
[31:16] them or glories of Jesus put that
[31:18] parable to give you an idea of your
[31:20] attitude of your persistence of your
[31:22] importunity well glory to God who says
[31:25] Jesus my friend no no no no you have
[31:27] something I need you have something you
[31:29] want you have something I've got to have
[31:32] Oh glory to God hallelujah he has a Mac
[31:36] he have a seal he have a baptism of the
[31:39] Holy Ghost you have a promise for you
[31:41] Oh glory to God and to your children and
[31:43] the temple afar off even as many as a
[31:46] lot of a God shall call he have an
[31:49] experience for you he have a fire for
[31:51] you he has a powerful you do you want it
[31:54] Oh blow it up God know what Jesus is
[32:01] back running this he said he give the
[32:04] all-father prayer I forgive us as we
[32:07] forgive those who trespass against us
[32:08] and then he give this parable about a
[32:10] man of a long a journey a long journey
[32:12] come to see I have nothing to set before
[32:14] me describe this scenario then a friend
[32:17] of mine is journey a long journey come
[32:19] to me I have nothing set before him and
[32:21] then the persistence and any command
[32:24] said well this is the attitude no he's
[32:26] breaking it on ask it shall be given to
[32:28] you and seek and ye shall find a knock
[32:30] she'll be open to you and to the lazy
[32:33] people who say they went and knock and
[32:34] nobody opened the door and they asked
[32:36] and they didn't get and they seek and
[32:39] didn't find he answer all that lazy
[32:41] behavior he come down with the next
[32:42] level here in that ask at him that
[32:44] knocketh him that seeketh not him that
[32:47] not oh god you're lazy that's why you're
[32:49] not not yet you're not knocking enough
[32:51] hallelujah not seeking enough yeah well
[32:54] I pray no no no yes seeking enough
[32:56] you're not seeking you have to see no
[32:58] there's a reason why I'm reading this
[33:00] because he had a next line here if a son
[33:05] shall ask bread of any of you disease of
[33:08] father will he give him a stone
[33:11] if he ask a fish will he for fish give
[33:15] him a sip and if he asks for an egg will
[33:19] you give him a famous copier then he
[33:21] said this if ye then being evil know how
[33:26] to give good gifts unto your children
[33:29] how much more shall your heavenly Father
[33:33] give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
[33:38] him to them to them that check the
[33:52] passing on to death that come and
[33:55] sitting in church and listened and read
[33:56] the word no to them that so this is
[33:59] personal to them that ask him so you
[34:03] give me hold back wrong to show you what
[34:05] is happening and why is the foolish
[34:07] version will remain foolish and while
[34:12] the wise version will be made wise
[34:14] because the wise not taking nothing for
[34:16] granted
[34:17] the wines have extra oil and there's a
[34:21] reason why the wise have extra oil and
[34:24] the foolish oil ran out the Hat you know
[34:28] yes they had a portion you know yes they
[34:31] had the atmosphere they had it but what
[34:34] they had ran out or dried out hallelujah
[34:41] but this wise version she going to ask
[34:46] she's going to receive many others just
[34:50] talking the talk this wise version going
[34:53] to walk that talk
[34:55] or glory to God hallelujah glory to God
[34:59] is at Pune bed one taken one left make
[35:03] sure you are the one that's taken that's
[35:08] an individual affair you have to see it
[35:10] Oh glory to God Amen let's continue
[35:15] you saw my question nan says Mr Bowen
[35:19] dong he said to me I couldn't read a
[35:21] revelation there was a bride standing on
[35:23] the Hmong Sinai there's a bride up
[35:25] yonder he said there was a bride and the
[35:27] water and the Dragons within water is
[35:29] mode to make war with her I said Mr
[35:31] Bowen the first thing of it is you got
[35:32] the wrong thing calling it the brine I
[35:36] said the Jews will stand on Mount Sinai
[35:40] the hundred and forty-four thousand the
[35:43] bride correctly was in heaven with Jesus
[35:45] on the dragon that splitted water out of
[35:47] his mouth will make war with the remnant
[35:51] of the woman's seed that was this group

[56:26] honey the church could hold the honey
[56:28] square to forgiveness all right watch in
[56:30] this church is a message being poured

[56:34] itself here we go
[56:35] this Tabernacle we will see that's where
[56:38] she comes to church this tabernacle is
[56:40] not a Holy Ghost Tabernacle there is no
[56:43] such a thing the Holy Ghost in okay
[56:51] individuals that come in to discharge
[56:53] his Holy Ghost tabernacle
[56:56] they are the Tabernacles that contain
[56:59] the Holy Ghost but not the church in a
[57:01] body or group so that's why nobody could
[57:04] say here is it Jesus has already he said

[57:30] individuals give the Lord a shout on
[57:32] that but Abraham should we speak in
[57:43] tongues absolutely
[57:45] that's gifts of God but those gifts of
[57:47] God with all these virtues in them makes
[57:49] it a stumbling block to the unbeliever
[57:50] it's not accepted by God
[57:53] this rock mud if you choose now has to
[57:55] be first and when you have faith and
[57:57] virtue and knowledge and temperance and
[57:59] patience and coordination but love then
[58:01] the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you
[58:06] as a unit the same as he sees the church
[58:10] ages as a unit so the church ages has to
[58:14] be sealed as a unit hallelujah
[58:17] hallelujah and the individual has to be
[58:19] seen as a unit so them seven things had

[59:19] seen the church is the unit the way he
[59:21] mixed the way he makes his bride okay
[59:24] the way he makes his bride is the way he
[59:27] makes this individual made out of the
[59:29] same material like Eve was made out of

[1:11:08] right and the church has taken a stand
[1:11:11] and mean the Holy Ghost Church and that
[1:11:13] is what I'm interested in friends when
[1:11:16] I'm here oh dear I'll pray for the sick
[1:11:18] but in here I'm interested in one thing
[1:11:21] that is God's born-again church that is
[1:11:25] what I'm interested in anyhow I am NOT
[1:11:27] interested in bylaws Deacons and so
[1:11:31] forth like that orders of churches I'm
[1:11:33] interested in the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:36] Ghost upon the church for this day that
[1:11:40] we are living in go get the Lord and
[1:11:44] show the Lord a show hallelujah not by
[1:11:49] laws or glory to God but the Holy Ghost
[1:11:52] upon the church the Holy Ghost upon you
[1:11:56] the Holy Ghost I come upon you okay the
[1:12:00] Lord comes upon you has to come upon you
[1:12:13] Oh glory to God you may be seated
[1:12:16] [Applause]
[1:12:19] [Music]
[1:12:23] when Jesus was walking with them pizza
[1:12:27] and all I'm can say I have the Holy
[1:12:28] Ghost because they all goes with them
[1:12:31] even chooses to kill them he says I will
[1:12:33] not leave you comfortless come when I
[1:12:36] was with you but shall be in you so what
[1:12:38] was with them had to come in them let me
[1:12:42] say it again because the dynamics is yet
[1:12:46] power is here
[1:12:48] everything you see here up to you see
[1:12:51] everything present tense
[1:12:53] God is here everything is here but that
[1:12:58] to be translated
[1:13:00] Jesus had was a recently dead give them
[1:13:03] clarity of understanding by open
[1:13:06] understanding open the seals of the Old
[1:13:09] Testament to them the word they had the
[1:13:11] understanding open they would an open
[1:13:14] don't know what they had to get he
[1:13:19] didn't give them the understanding the
[1:13:20] educate them enough no more any
[1:13:22] Pharisees that was it was it was
[1:13:27] revelation that they could come under
[1:13:29] expectation for their manifestation so
[1:13:32] when God identified with stammering lips
[1:13:34] and another tongue identify Jewish
[1:13:36] Scripture shall come to pass support my
[1:13:38] spirit jesus taught descriptors to them
[1:13:40] he was reading the courts he was
[1:13:44] bringing an Old Testament prophecy and
[1:13:46] said this is what have to come that's
[1:13:48] why when Peter come he said this is that
[1:13:51] because Jesus showed in that that the
[1:13:55] Prophet joy speak of peace our could
[1:13:58] identify this manifestation is because
[1:14:00] of this prophecy here when Jesus
[1:14:10] overcome Satan in the wilderness and he
[1:14:12] came to the chamber what did Jesus do he
[1:14:14] find the place where it was written
[1:14:17] he found his scriptures and he said his
[1:14:20] prayers upon me and they thought he was
[1:14:22] just reading scripture then he said this
[1:14:25] this good job is fulfilling your ears so
[1:14:34] Jesus thought was to find his scripture
[1:14:36] to identify himself with the bride has
[1:14:40] to find her scriptures to identify
[1:14:42] yourself with we are not going to
[1:14:45] identify with foolish virgins remnant of
[1:14:47] the woman's seed revolution since we not
[1:14:50] identify with that I call them
[1:14:53] jubilation since let's continue there
[1:14:59] are two types of Christianity's seem
[1:15:01] strange I would not say two different
[1:15:04] types I say two different phases will be
[1:15:07] a better word to use not two types two
[1:15:09] phases
[1:15:10] simcha sanity but two phases of it one
[1:15:13] of them is an intellectual or mental
[1:15:16] conception of what God has said in his
[1:15:19] word and of Jesus Christ by way of
[1:15:21] knowledge and the other is an
[1:15:25] experimental experience that God has
[1:15:28] given the man in his heart and ported
[1:15:32] them going to church but I don't believe
[1:15:34] the message water and her books and tips
[1:15:36] but one have an experimental experience
[1:15:39] here and the other one of a head thing
[1:15:43] missing services oh give the loss
[1:15:45] embraces intellectually is hunger in one
[1:15:52] he's feasting on God his feet doesn't
[1:15:55] hole oh the other one seems that the
[1:15:56] vichy all the time nothing butters them
[1:15:58] they're just a solid and anchor as they
[1:16:01] can be no trials no stones bother them
[1:16:04] at all but they seem to have something
[1:16:05] about them the people who are Christians
[1:16:07] trying to live for God admire that type
[1:16:11] of Christian and I often wondered Lord
[1:16:13] what is it that these people have that
[1:16:15] the others create so much for oh my
[1:16:17] hallelujah
[1:16:19] something is in the heart same aside
[1:16:22] shells in manager no but something is
[1:16:25] near heart
[1:16:25] he's a denied Christ Peter run away
[1:16:27] Pittacus but something happened in his
[1:16:29] heart in the upper room that devil got
[1:16:32] kicked told his snake got fire bombed
[1:16:34] and God sat down on the Troon of his hat
[1:16:36] and Peter was a changed man same picture
[1:16:39] they take a picture of him on Instagram
[1:16:41] is the same but a Peter same face him
[1:16:43] tears in everything but he had change Oh
[1:16:46] glory to God somebody else inside of
[1:16:49] that man Oh glory to God His Holy Ghost
[1:16:51] and fire inside of that man
[1:16:53] it proved it man and NASA Sapphira came
[1:16:56] lying in the church it come out of him
[1:16:58] it's a power it's a hidden power it
[1:17:00] comes on as we might need Peter was
[1:17:02] looking to give the man money at the
[1:17:04] gate called beautiful he had no money
[1:17:06] but he only remembered what he had he
[1:17:08] had two selves and olha like number what
[1:17:09] I have I can give you man
[1:17:11] well or I could give you that thing what
[1:17:13] I have will glory rise up and walk in
[1:17:15] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:17:16] because I am now connected to the source
[1:17:18] itself or glava source in me other power
[1:17:22] in me I'm an efficient well in me or guy
[1:17:25] at my auntie and tech or glory to glory
[1:17:28] I'm connected director diviner I am a
[1:17:31] branch and apart from divine flow
[1:17:34] through me as my father send me Jesus I
[1:17:37] saw Sunday oh he was a powerhouse he was
[1:17:40] connected to the very source itself
[1:17:42] all glory to God so the Spirit of God
[1:17:45] was flowing through the line she led
[1:17:47] branch to whosoever will or give the
[1:17:50] Lord a shout this is what God one for
[1:17:52] you
[1:17:54] [Applause]
[1:17:56] Bessy prophet look in the second chapter
[1:18:04] of Joshua find out here that I believe
[1:18:06] in harlot named Rahab Gentile Hallett
[1:18:08] across the river and when they come into
[1:18:10] the Promised Land the spies went over
[1:18:12] the spout all of our family was safe
[1:18:14] under the token now remember listen
[1:18:17] God's destroying angel on earth at
[1:18:20] talking and when the churches went down
[1:18:22] the mayor fell the city went down the
[1:18:25] king went down the governor the educated
[1:18:27] the pretty woman the handsome man the
[1:18:29] important all-sufficient everything went
[1:18:31] down that wasn't under the token so will
[1:18:34] it be in the coming of the Son of God
[1:18:36] his destroying angel will destroy
[1:18:39] everything who hasn't got the token of
[1:18:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon them
[1:18:44] to show that you are being identified
[1:18:46] and guide yourself to your sacrifice and
[1:18:51] are born into the Spirit of God and seal
[1:18:54] there by the Holy Ghost a cadet born and
[1:19:00] they're sealed in there by the Holy
[1:19:01] Ghost oh my do believe that and in the
[1:19:04] last days they're the only two kinds of
[1:19:07] people two classes of people then that
[1:19:09] has the seal and the others that will
[1:19:11] have the mark of the beast so the seed
[1:19:13] of God is the Baptist of the Holy Spirit
[1:19:16] and the mark of the beast is not a stamp
[1:19:18] on your hand the mark of the beast is
[1:19:20] rejecting the seal of God you take the
[1:19:23] mark of the beast
[1:19:26] the first thing you know the time will
[1:19:30] come when you will be God will give a
[1:19:33] message that and you will be sealed in
[1:19:35] or seal all the kingdom of God
[1:19:37] oh my I wonder if that time is really a
[1:19:40] fresh message a fresh prophecy of the
[1:19:44] prophecy Oh hallelujah prophecy a
[1:19:46] message of the seed of God Oh hallelujah
[1:19:49] oh my I read it again
[1:19:52] the time will come when you quad will
[1:19:56] give a message who will give a message
[1:20:01] God will give a message and what the
[1:20:04] percentage changes he said one he said
[1:20:06] the world will hear
[1:20:08] from God once more he left off more
[1:20:11] himself now he's dumb but the spirit and
[1:20:14] the brand the Prophet will say the same
[1:20:16] thing and what the same will have
[1:20:18] already been said in the world once more
[1:20:20] the world will hear it from God how will
[1:20:23] you know it's the voice of God
[1:20:24] it will be a manifestation of the
[1:20:26] prophets world that is how you're gonna
[1:20:28] know the voice of God not I explained
[1:20:30] this that we in this new a manifest this
[1:20:32] is that that the Prophet William Branham
[1:20:33] speak of or give the Lord a shout in
[1:20:36] other words here is a seventh on the
[1:20:38] revival this is that that the Prophet
[1:20:40] said that there will come a time when
[1:20:42] people find them everywhere to see the
[1:20:44] seven thunders being manifested this is
[1:20:46] that that the Prophet take of the bride
[1:20:49] had no revival yet it will take them
[1:20:51] seven thunders to wake up the bride
[1:20:53] again there has been no manifestation of
[1:20:55] God just still the bride he will send it
[1:20:58] there we opposite this is that that the
[1:21:00] Prophet said look he's in it look at
[1:21:02] here or give the Lord a shout glory to
[1:21:05] God hallelujah identifying what the
[1:21:08] prophet prophecy is Oh glory to God
[1:21:11] because when you take the book from the
[1:21:13] angel
[1:21:13] the only prophesy according to the book
[1:21:16] you can't have your own prophecy give
[1:21:22] the Lord a praise I think I want to see
[1:21:26] that again the voice that John good
[1:21:30] means you take the book and almost
[1:21:32] prophesy again how do I say well you
[1:21:33] know what I go to meet the prophesied
[1:21:35] this and prophesied that he's just in
[1:21:37] the book the words in his mouth he has
[1:21:39] to speak from the prophecy of the book
[1:21:43] prophesied the nation to tongue to Kings
[1:21:45] that Micah go any part of this world and
[1:21:47] prophesy oh yes we could prophesy two
[1:21:51] kings and portentous and countries and
[1:21:53] nations or glory and prophesy to the
[1:21:56] bright room until a church member bkerr
[1:21:58] prophesied judgment to the church and

[1:29:06] promised it has nothing to do with their
[1:29:08] Pentecostal church we're not talking
[1:29:11] about that or glory to God God didn't
[1:29:14] kick out justification because I profit
[1:29:16] come he didn't call significant because
[1:29:18] the profit come you need justification

[1:29:49] it can't produce a possible to save its
[1:29:51] soul a greener wheat will bring forth a
[1:29:54] green or wheat and the Holy Spirit
[1:29:56] leading the church leads it in the power
[1:29:59] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:30:01] that's when Holy Ghost leaden Oh glory
[1:30:04] to God so but of it
[1:30:06] the Holy Ghost is the power exactly the
[1:30:08] Bible is a road map the road map the
[1:30:10] power seat takes you there
[1:30:12] Oh glory to God power to do what
[1:30:14] reproduce he promised anything power
[1:30:17] comes at the shake on this for long it's
[1:30:19] the produced he promised power come to
[1:30:21] identify the promise when power come
[1:30:23] upon Jesus the Bible said he returned in
[1:30:25] the power of the Spirit and then in the
[1:30:28] power of the Spirit
[1:30:29] scripture what was promised the Spirit
[1:30:32] is upon me because he has anointed me Oh
[1:30:34] glory to God that was the promise of the
[1:30:36] hour he identified with it and the power
[1:30:38] to shew the channel of that prophecy and
[1:30:41] there's a put the manifest these are the
[1:30:43] Messiah or give the Lord a shout India
[1:30:47] was this commission under bright
[1:30:48] commission to be creatively of vengeance
[1:30:52] of our God to finish the Commission Oh
[1:30:54] hallelujah praise the Lord amen oh I
[1:31:00] love him
[1:31:02] he said no when you hit a bone you're
[1:31:05] the trouble chicken a week it's really
[1:31:07] blown away so if a prisoner I've
[1:31:09] appreciated hit a bone see the bone just
[1:31:13] put it bonus fact you eatin cherry pie
[1:31:17] you're under siege in actually pea we
[1:31:19] just truly Siddalee so you do the same
[1:31:21] thing in listen to this I believe the
[1:31:25] reason there is so much confusion today
[1:31:27] about the Holy Spirit
[1:31:30] it is not correctly taught I believe the
[1:31:34] baptism is taught and just said baptism
[1:31:36] but when you say automobile no I've got
[1:31:39] several mechanics in the church I don't
[1:31:40] know one thing about it so if I make a
[1:31:42] mistake is I'm another mechanic they are
[1:31:44] coils plugs points vowels everything
[1:31:47] else that makes an automobile so when
[1:31:49] you talk about baptism of the Holy
[1:31:51] Spirit
[1:31:52] there's a lot that goes with that so you
[1:31:56] can all the experience and says you're

[1:32:04] want to feel nothing I want to move you
