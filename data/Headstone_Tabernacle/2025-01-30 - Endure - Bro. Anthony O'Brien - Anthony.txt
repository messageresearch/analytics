thought to share with you this evening if you have your Bibles you can begin to take it now and we want to go to two portion the scripture thank you thank you brother Stephen oliv two portions of scripture we want to read from tonight by the grace of God Matthew chapter 24 and we want to go back into Ecclesiastes uh ch chapter 9 afterwards so uh Matthew 24 will be our longest reading and in Ecclesiastes 9 we'll just pick up one verse there but reading from Matthew chapter 24 we'd like to read from verse 4 Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am crying Christ and shall deceive many and he shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that he be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places all these things are the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then shall he be uh shall many be offended and shall betray one another my and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be Sav and then turning over now to Ecclesiastes 9 for our last reading just one verse there Ecclesiastes 9 chter 9 verse 11 which says I returned and saw Under the Sun that the race is not to the Swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to Men of understanding nor yet favor to Men of skill but time and chance happeneth to them all may God add blessing to the reading of his word let us bow our heads as we pray almighty God Lord you are the Lord you are the creator of all things Lord you are Our Shepherd you are our leader father you are the one we look to Father Lord in especially in the times that we now live in Lord we see the darkness stretching forth against the world Lord in every aspect of this life Lord and we know that it won't be long now soon we'll be leaving here and your son will come amen with with healing in his wings Lord and we we thank you for your word and and presence here tonight with your people Lord for a few moments as we get into your word to speak your word father and to talk about you Lord we pray your presence would come Lord as we invite you here tonight one more time to Lord anoint us and bless us and help us father open up your your word to us Lord that we could see Lord the age that we're living in the time that we're living in and what you're requiring of us oh god father we we need so much from you tonight Lord we acknowledge that we cannot go on on our own strengths Lord but that your strength will be made perfect in our weakness father so we pray that you would come in a mighty way Lord and may you lift us up father Lift us up Lord beyond the natural Lord May the spirit of God just sweep in and Lift Every Soul up here tonight Lord those on the internet Lord those who within the sound of us Lord father may you just sweep over them now and may anoint them Father Lord and bless them Lord and help them as we go along in this service Lord may you minister take me out of the way and bless these few scriptures this inspiration that we have here tonight to share by the grace of God won't you pour out your spirit tonight and you Minister Lord You Take Control in Jesus name I pray and ask it amen and amen you may be seated hallu praise God hallu Amen well again it's good to be here tonight and amen oh every time we come now it's more and more of a blessing because we don't know how much time is left but but what time we do have we want to uh uh take full advantage of it amen in the presence of God Amen we we we already here if the devil is trying to stop us from getting us here uh he's too late so now that we're here we're going to praise him we're going to worship Him and we're going to stay on fire for God amen amen for straight is the gate and narrows way few there be that find it so we thank God for you here tonight who found the way the the the higher way amen the narrow way so God bless you tonight and certainly appreciate you being here now we just have a a a small message we want to preach here tonight amen but I have a title and my title is one word endure uh that's my title tonight uh endure if you can get one one word from God tonight then it'll be enough for me amen uh that one word tonight is endure and um you know I was just it just the thought just come to me and I I told my wife I said you know what what does it mean to endure you know and I just began talking to her and then all these scriptures start to unfold like that and that was a while ago and so you know just listening to the service we had last Sunday gone with our precious uh pastor Solomon Aina amen was such a tremendous blessing amen you appreciate that message talking about the time and season God does things in his time and in his season he will unfold himself amen amen all you have to do is wait on God wait for him to do what he promised that he would do to do what he said he would do amen isn't that right and he will fulfill it in his time in his season praise God isn't that right he has a Time for everything I I so appreciate that message on Sunday you know and I heard a a brother say one time that you know when God makes us wait like that it tempers our faith U because we want things when we want it and we feel that we need it right now but God being know a God of all wisdom who who knows what's good for you he's a good father and because he knows what's good for you he knows when to give it to you he knows when your faith is ripe enough for you to receive it he knows when you're you're ready to have what you're asking for he doesn't want you to be like the prodigal son who comes and asks for his inheritance but he's not ready for it God wants you to be trained for the battle he wants you to be prepared for what's coming next because there's coming a famine in the land and you've got to know how to maintain your resources how to handle your yourself in times of trouble and how to endure when the tough times come what you can lean back on what you can rest on because this race is not for the Swift nor the battle for the strong praise God but for them who could endure to the end the same shall be saved do you believe it tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah so what does it mean to endure we talk about it we mention it but what does it mean to to endure it means to continue in the same state meaning unwavering uh uh uh you're still in the same Fresh Fire that you had when you first started out uh you are unmoved you are unwavering in your resolution about what you are enduring with isn't that right or enduring towards amen hallelujah it means to remain firm under suffering or Misfortune without you building Amen in other words there's no retreat in your language there's no retreat there's no surrender in your vocabulary oh you remain firm even under suffering even under Misfortune oh H you are still strong in your resolve because something is keeping you something is holding the rains in your soul and won't allow you to give up the battle it won't allow you to let go of the rains oh Hallelujah you know something more than you tonight is what brought you all this way and you know you're not alone just like Caleb was was not alone he had another spirit with him and you have another spirit with you tonight the Bride of Jesus Christ this bride in 2025 she has another spirit with her oh it's the Holy Spirit making the word more positive making the word more real to her that's the anointing we feel tonight amen in this place and we know that it is God keeping us helping us to endure it means to undergo especially without giving in it means to regard with acceptance or with tolerance in other words you're going through stuff and quite frankly you just have to put up with it you're enduring it doesn't mean uh it's a situation of great discomfort enduring doesn't mean that we necessarily are having fun in the moment isn't that right uring means uh it doesn't mean that we're enjoying the activity in which we are involved enjoying means we just got to put up with it because that's what we've been dealt and we just have to to go through we we we can't go around it we we can't go dig a hole and go under it we we can't ignore it because it's in your face it's it's it's spitting in your face and it's flying in your face and the emotions are real and the feelings are real and the anguish is real and the pain is real and the nails are real and the poob wire is real and the Thorns are real yet you've just got to endure the devil is not a figment of your imagination he's a real person with a real objective just like the person sitting next to you he's just as real as that and he doesn't like you very much he has an intention tonight to kill you tonight he wants you dead and the only reason you're not dead is because God told the devil you can do anything to them but don't you touch their soul because their soul belongs to me and I am the Lord and you got to play by my rules Satan you can go so far and no more because even in the midst of every trial and every circumstance oh there is still the grace of God oh God will not let you go through a Temptation that you cannot bear he puts a spirit upon you to help you endure the tough times when when the early Christians were being persecuted we always talk about that that was the spirit of the ox uh having to Bear the burden the weight of uh a persecution literal persecution this is not uh being ridiculed in school or or being ridiculed for your race or something like that this this was you being killed because of your belief and those early Christians were slaughtered they were mimed they were were sa aund cut in two literally is what that means they were thrown out into the middle of the the Roman uh uh uh entertainment circles and and they were lions were released upon them and while their eyes were lifted up to God to Jesus they were caught and destroyed and teeth went into them ripped their bodies apart their insides were gouged out were left seen and the open display there was blood everywhere people will killed this gospel that we believe in is dripping with blood people died for this thing and they had to endure come through all of that and yet still with all of that the Bible still says that they without us are not made perfect because we having some better thing or waiting in store for us brother sister we ought to be excited tonight about what God is about to do he he he he's got a better thing tonight oh he's got the Holy Ghost tonight he's he's got an outpouring of the spirit tonight if you would only Surrender Your Soul Surrender Your Heart give him everything tonight he can seal you with the Glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire would burn into your soul and change you forever oh Hallelujah that's what I want that's what we need tonight and old fashion sky blue sin killing Revival of the Holy Ghost when men and women get right with God at the altar and meet the pillar of fire personally and are change forever oh Hallelujah eternity breaks into your soul and God does something for you that this world cannot do and that this world cannot take away that's what the church needs tonight and that's what we are here for tonight oh Hallelujah not to S so people into the gospel not to write the names down in a book and join a church no but have you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost since you believe you need to receive it and if you haven't received it may God make your pillow as a rock and make you so uncomfortable until you are compelled to scream at the altar of God to receive the fire of [Music] God before the judgments cuz there's only so much time left for blood to be upon The Mercy Seat because it becomes a judgment Throne it was always a judgment Throne it was the blood that made it a mercy seat we thank God for the blood tonight Hallelujah sprinkled seven times Eastward for our sake that we could come in that we could be grafted in well we were strangers and foreigners we were pilgrims we were lost and undone without God and his son until he reached down his hand for us and picked us up pulled us out of laia a age of darkness and confusion God pull us up out of that amen into a bright age by fi the prophet put a little sliver of light in lisia showing that there will be light in the evening time and that light will be only in the predestinated ones shining forth the glory of God testifying of the oncoming son oh Hallelujah morning stars as was raised up for such a time as this oh you are privileged tonight you are royal priesthood you are Nation you are peculiar people and right in this age of Darkness God's going to manifest light in your lifej and show you off for the world to see that this is my beloved Son this is my beloved daughter in whom I am well pleased to dwell in amen we want God to say that of us one day amen that is what we're here for tonight amen oh wonderful so let me continue here so so it comes with great stress enduring it's not uh walk in the park as they say it's not a walk on TR Road it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a It's a Grind it's a grit it's it's pushing it's pulling it's stress it's heartache there's there's pain in there untold stories isn't that right of just going through if you could sit with some young people you need to start with some of these older ones and let them tell you what it means to endure some of us frankly just don't know we we are just too green we need to understand what it means what it takes because we look at them now looking all Victorious in prayer but but but that didn't just happen overnight they had victories they they had battles they had to fight they they have scars from from times when things were not so good they they they had stories to tell you you ought to sit and listen to some of those stories come off your phone for 2 minutes and begin to talk to some of these older ones and begin to understand why they're sitting in this building tonight it is not by happen stance it is not by chance or or by accident but God allow us to go through the things that we went through so that we could come out better for it we could come out Victorious oh knowing that he conquered in us not we and ourselves but we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture and the only reason we made it out alive was because Jesus was on our side and had he not been on our side we the Earth would have swallowed us up quick oh hallelujah our enemy would have consumed us but like a bird out of the snare of the Fowler tonight we have escaped oh hallelujah hallelujah we have escaped the wicked one oh you escaped the world you escaped lust you escape the darkness called in his rich and mercy in his wisdom and his power allowed us to see something greater than ourselves and something in US was awakened and we ran after it and we are still running tonight running away from Fear running away from everything else we are running home tonight running home to Jesus do you feel that way tonight so when man is enduring it usually comes with a sound of great trial and great stress isn't that right heartache pain growth process all of those processes that are necessary for character development amen that is what we do when we endure yes sir amen and it's because we are in this temporary State uh where we have to learn we have to grow we have to come into the stature of a perfect man isn't that right but God doesn't have to come into the stature because he is perfection he doesn't have to to grow because uh he is God he he always was and he always will be isn't that right uh if anybody knows anything about enduring it is God because he he always was and he always will be isn't that right so when we talk about man's enduring it usually comes with great heartache and trial and pain because that's a process we have to do to get to where we want to get to but God is already there tonight he's already where he is he's just waiting on us to come back oh can you say Amen tonight amen amen so when God endures it is usually at the sound of rejoicing when we talk about the endurance of the Lord oh when we talk about how God has endured throughout the ages how God has endured all time it usually comes with rejoicing because we are so confident in God's ability to endure isn't that right Psalms chapter 9 and verse six says oh thou enemy destructions are come to a Perpetual end and thou has destroyed cities the memorial is perished with them but the Lord shall endure forever he had prepared his throne for judgment and he shall judge the world in righteousness he shall Minister judgment to the people in uprightness Psalm Chapter 30 says Sing unto the Lord oh ye Saints of his and give thanks at the remembrance of his Holiness his anger endureth but for a moment and in his favor is life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning the joy of the Lord can endure the Weeping of the night the joy of the Lord can endure Hallelujah all of the darkness all of the sorrow all of the despair all of the storm in other words God goes beyond that he can Outlast anything oh that this world has to offer he can Outlast any moment oh Hallelujah that this world can throw at him he can endure he can Outlast and if God can endure then if that same spirit of God were to come upon you tonight he could give you that same strength in order to endure the things you have to go through oh won't be your strength it be his strength in you giving you the ability to endure Hallelujah that's what we need tonight because this world is not void of burdens this world is not void of troubles and Sorrows regardless of whether you go to church or not you're are going to face Hard Times regardless of whether you go to church on a Sunday or not tough times will come that is life that is that is blanket life uh it it it hits everybody it's it it is as an unforgiving sea raging on and on and regardless of who you are how rich you are or what your name is whether you're a big shot or your medium shot it doesn't matter uh what rank or status or file or social structure you have in life you are going to be hit by this Raging Sea at some point or the other you're going to be hit by by the storms of life you're going to have to face it uh uh doesn't matter where you come from or where you're going you're going to be faced with trials in some way but Jesus said my yoke is easy and my burden is light oh Hallelujah if you bear the Yol of this world you you'll have a weight to Bear but but if you carry my Yol oh it's a lot easier if you carry my burden oh there a much light to load so you do the math this tonight but I want the light to load tonight if I got to carry a load then oh Jesus give me the lighter one because oh Hallelujah sometimes it's just too much sometimes we need Jesus to take control one time my wife looked at me and she said how do atheists make it through how do people who don't believe that there is a God how are they getting through this life how do people who say there is no God David said is a fool had said there is no God she said how is it that people say there is no God how are they making it through this life because she said if anything I've learned to do is to trust in Jesus if there's anything I've learned how to do is to trust in God when all my intellect fails when all my memory and my strength and my ability fails that's when God's strength endures oh it endures a trial it endures a tough time it endures oh hallelujah hallelujah it's not for the Swift it's not for the skill you don't even have to have talent all you've got to do is to be able to make the next step in the direction towards the cross that's all you've got to do sometimes that's all it come down to is a choice you make to serve God one more time oh Hallelujah Hall you don't even have to have education to do that oh that's just a choice that you make to love God despite the condition despite the trial and despite the situations that you are in you choose to say Lord you know better than I and I trust your will over mine I trust your your reasoning over mine your your understanding I I I'm in the midst of this storm I can't see my way out I don't know right from left I don't know up from down I'm trusting that he tonight has a higher perspective that he could navigate me that he can show me how to get out of this because I'm not able to do it on my own and and I believe when we come into that kind of a condition now we're ready to be yielded and molded and shaped by the master oh some he wants to he wants to get you trained but you're pulling against a chain you don't want to be subjective you don't want to be surrendered oh Hallelujah triy to hold you down and you're pulling against it pulling against it sometime you just got to leave you let You Yank on that chain and yell yell until you're finally ready to whimper down until you're finally ready to submit until you're finally ready to to to surrender to your situation to to the harness that God has you in so that he could now mold you and shape you because you can't go on uh pulling against the the the kicking against the Pricks isn't that right got to get you in a state of mind first isn't that right surrendered with your arm lifted up I surrender to you Lord amen that's what we come to do tonight we come to surrender to him Hallelujah so that we could understand it better by and by we won't all get it all at once um but when we look back we can be assured that we could see the plan of God unfolding throughout the years and give praise to what he has already done because at that point he's already done it and all he needs now is just all the praise and glory for what he had already brought you through even in times when you didn't understand uh he always understood amen and amen we give him praise tonight glory to God Amen Psalms 100 says enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth truth endureth to all generations amen and amen Now 1 Corinthians 15 says oh death where is thy sing here's Paul testifying oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren he said be steadfast and un un movable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain of the Lord isn't that right oh my God's love endures uh there is nothing more enduring than the love of God isn't that right and our mission tonight is to make it to the top of that pyramid isn't that right to make it to charity the absolute the love of God that is so rich that is so pure it shall forever more endure amen and and 1 Corinthians 13 says though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become as a sounding brass as a tingling symbol amen isn't that right charity suffer it long verse four and is kind do you believe it charity Envy it not charity want it not itself it is not puffed up oh Hallelujah it does not behave itself unseemingly seeketh not her own it is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things and endureth all things charity never faileth oh Hallelujah Glory but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether they be tongues they shall cease whether they be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come oh and then that which is in part shall be done away and we know that there's coming a time when that which is perfect is going to come upon the church in the last days and give her the anointing praise God hallelujah isn't that right to show forth Jesus Christ in the last days do you believe it amen brother brandham says here seals the anti christ says no matter how no matter you might join churches he said you might shake hands with pastors put your name on the books all these things are good he said you might Paul said though I might speak uh with the tongue of man and angels and though I have wisdom and understand all the knowledge of God though I give my body to be burned earn as a sacrifice though I do all these things I am still nothing that's right but he said where there's tongues they shall cease where there's knowledge it shall vanish where there's prophecies it will fail but When Love Comes he said it will endure forever he said now what the church the Pentecostal church needs tonight he said along with all the other churches is a good oldfashioned baptizing of the Holy Ghost and love that will make you straighten up oh Hallelujah it'll make you straighten up he says oh and get together and come together like brothers and sisters in the Lord Jesus Christ in other words let the walls fall down let the walls that divide us and hide us and cut us off all those walls will fall When Love Takes Over oh brother brand said one day we'll be standing and sitting just like we are now and talking and all of a sudden love is going to come down into the building and it's going to take every wrong and make it right oh Hallelujah heal the sick he's going to raise the dead if we can get that thing fixed in five minutes there'll not be a feeble person in our midst there'll not be one person that would desire the Holy Ghost but would receive it oh Hallelujah so he come to straighten you out he's going to do the straighten it out amen he is the good father uh to correct his children he's going to straighten it all out amen and get together and come together like brothers and sisters in the Lord Jesus Christ and break down all these walls of partition what is that man-made walls partition walls it look like it's a barrier but when you knock at the the the heart of it it's Hollow there's nothing inside it just it's just just a facade cutting you off with all these ideas and doctrines and and and wisdom of men and thing all throughout the years have cut people off isn't that right but we have promised the love of God to sweep in there like a flood and rise above all those partitions sweep away the Refuge of lies that they have hid themselves in and God will expose the lies expose the filth and he will bring in his mercy and his grace and his forgiveness and his pardon and his freedom because there is freedom in the name name of Jesus Amen isn't that right Hallelujah get together amenallah he said amen Prophet said where there's love God is love love suffers long and love is not provoked love is not puffed up when you get puffed up love is gone and where there's all this malice and strife and wars and envy and Malice against one another brother God just moves out that's all and it's a fact he said you could see it amen now you've got the right Road brother you've got the right path but what you need to do the prophet said is to come back together again for an oldfashioned uh zua Street meeting where the men and women will come together in all denominations break down all their barriers amen hallelujah is that right we say interpretations in the message and so on break down all their barriers and recognize one another as brothers and sisters in the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ amen isn't that right that's the prophet said that's what we need and we agree with that tonight amen hallelujah so when we endure we have to go through it uh it takes a lot more than what we've got in order to go through something isn't that right you have to have a a a strong resolve you have to have a real purpose you have to have a real vision and it takes Faith to reveal the vision of God it takes Faith to reveal the desire of God to you it takes a revelation to reveal it and Faith to stay with it isn't that right and stand on that Revelation that he give you 2 Corinthians 4 but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power of God uh may be of God and not of us Paul says we are troubled on every side but yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair oh Hallelujah persecuted but we are not forsaken we are cast down but we are not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body Hallelujah isn't that right oh in other words we're dying daily and that Life of Christ is being manifest in our body in our flesh in our works not of man that we should boast but but but in God Hal we could find strength we can find courage for another day we could find the right word for the situation it takes God to be able to do that it takes God to be able to give you a kind answer to turn away the Wrath to turn away um the situation to deescalate the work of the enemy it takes the wisdom of God to do that and I believe tonight there's a people in the land who under their messenger are going to find these seven things and put them all together praise God God for the glory of God that we could begin to live Christ in these last days that we could be as Christ Hallelujah to our brother to our sister praise God because some of them a book won't do it maybe a track won't do it they need to see a life living they need to see a reality they need to see God manifested and then they'll say what shall I do to be saved isn't that right oh my that's what we want to be our testimony our example of God therefore in order to endure something we have to possess certain qualities isn't that right in order to come out victoriously after having gone through it to endure means to withstand it means to persevere difficult situation requiring a combination of mental fortitude resilience and a strong sense of purpose this is what it means to This Is What It Takes into your uh the ability to adapt to challenges oh and the pyramid will help you adapt to challenges praise when you need patience he can patience will come out of you when you need virtue virtue will come out brotherly kindness will come out godliness will come out Hallelujah isn't that right he will give you the ability tonight to adapt to any challenge that you will face from here on out if you have these things in you amen and amen and often uh and uh they say you often need a support system to help you navigate through these hardships essentially especially when it takes uh uh it takes the capacity to remain steadfast even when facing adversity this is what it it takes in order to endure this is what you need to fortify yourself with and we know that the holy spirit gives us everything we need to fortify ourselves with what we need in order to face what we're going to face amen because we we can't avoid it amen amen hallelujah is not Goliath is coming ready or not praise God what you've got to know is you have what it takes to fa Goliath when you get there um but he will be there praise God you better believe that your God is there also amen that the Revival is in you praise God and you've got what it takes to conquer every devil on the field but to learn it to shame it takes God to do that in youj amen and amen and amen praise God perfect strength by Perfect weakness here's the brother R he says there's so many of us likes to testify or likes to think that we're insufficient and therefore we make that an excuse he says so this is like you say you don't have it you say I don't have any education I have no ability I'm unable to do this Prophet said if you keep that up and do that in that way you keep going like that then you can't amount to anything but the very thing that we make excuses by our weaknesses butam said God uses that very thing to tackle the job with oh Hallelujah can we say Amen see he waits for us to get to that condition so that he can use us isn't that right and we take the excuses and we say well I'm I I can't do this and so on in other words we believe the excuses amen is we are standing on the excuses rather than standing on what God said uh I'm insufficient uh I can't do it and God takes that very thing to do the job with he says that's true amen and that's the reason why he chooses us because we're in that condition he says now that sounds strange but just a few moments we'll get to the reason if God be willing he said we find out that just as we've been reading that weaknesses and rejections the prophet said we find out that those people who are the weakest and the rejected by the outside world is God's Heroes oh my that conquer in the front line those are God's Heroes that those uh takes those who are that feel themselves unworthy oh my that's what it takes my to to be used of God isn't that something let's read back Ecclesiastes 9 again we read it uh just as we started right I return and so Under the Sun that the race is not to the Swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet yet bread to the wise yet riches uh to Men of understanding praise God and we've seen that we've seen rich people who who see might know split beans from coffee but they were able to put one and two together and make money praise God uh it's a it's it's it's astounding isn't that right nor yet favor to Men of skill but time and chance happeneth to them all in other words we are all faced with situations where we have to make a choice and that choice is what will ultimately Place us uh uh uh uh whether um uh in eternity or in damnation my that choice that can either place Us in life or death isn't that right oh my what this verse is suggesting is that in order to make it to the end actual overcoming comes down to a choice it is not as obvious as one thinks isn't that right amen if this Christian Journey Was a Race then this race would not be for the Swift a lot of people start off hot and Swift and they look like they're going to make it all the way through they all pumped they all ready they're dressed in the best Nike uh running shoes and they have on their Reebok uh t-shirt and they have on their dry fit and they they they've got their all their bandages in the right place and they've got their knee brace on and they Before the Race even starts they're jumping and they're they're looking like they're already muscly and they've got what it takes but but sometimes when it all boils down to it it come down to endurance it come down to who who can cross the finish line praise God Hallelujah at the end of it all can you even cross the finish line at all praise God because it's not a flat race it's not a short distance we in this thing for the Long Haul oh how we in this thing for the day in day out and though it get dreary though the road get tny no more pray oh stay in the spirit stay on fire soak up in the presence of the Lord hide me in the Cliff of The Rock and when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I oh hallelujah hallelujah let me hide in his Pavilion hide in a secret place and find strength in the word of God find glory in his glory in his word uh find rest in his word uh because when the world gets weary when the world drains us we got to have something to lean on we got to be able to lean on prayer we got to be able to lean on the word got to be able to lean on Jesus Oh hallelujah hallelujah job said though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God for myself and not another oh he had a promise from God that he was going to see God for himself no matter what Abraham went through oh he made mistakes along the way oh but God revealed he was going to have a son and come hell high water oh he had to make it oh he staggered not of the promise of God oh Hallelujah Hal but was strong in Praise giving Faith giving praise unto God oh hallelujah hallelujah oh when the going gets rough you've got to endure you've got to know that you know that who you're who you're working for in order to endure the tough times isn't that right Hallelujah the fastest may not be necessarily the ones to win this race it's not about skill it's not about a certain education or particular human skill when it all comes down to it it's a choice you make isn't that right there are people who are skilled to give up people who seem very promising isn't that right the good uh the seed the SE went forth to seow and seeds fell everywhere fell on the wayside it fell on the Thorns it fell on the Rocks some of them sprung up looked like they was going somewhere but then the cares of Life begin to wrap its way around them and legitimate things begin to tie them up legitimate things work and family and this and that and it started to become too much praise God and instead of leaning on Jesus they try to do it on their own oh Hallelujah and all of a sudden that seed begins to lose its grip it begins to lose its strength it begins to lose its fervor oh Hal begins to fall away from its first love all of a sudden begin to wax and get cold isn't that right oh Hallelujah not everyone is going to enter in not everyone is going to make it all the way to the end only those that fall upon good ground isn't that right praise God springing forth bringing forth 60 fold 80 fold 100 fold isn't that right so the seed is not the problem it's where you put it it's the environment you put the seed in because no man has power to make a seed grow all we got to do is create an environment for that seed to bring forth and Bud and Blossom and and show forth its Glory isn't that right no more than a Shepherd can make sheep uh make wool he cannot make the Sheep make wool the the Sheep makes wool on its own his job is to provide a safe environment for that sheep to Blossom and to prosper and to feed on the good alala weeds and to be in the right place with the happy sunshine and the safe cool nights and all of a sudden something naturally begins to happen wool begins to pop out of the sheep because it just comes naturally and and praise God if you are in the right environment tonight God knows there's a seed in your soul and is just waiting for the light to strike that seed uh and he's been cutting things away from your life cutting away negativity cutting away this happened and that happened cut cutting a away cutting a path for you tonight so that you could bur and Blossom and bring forth and do the things that he has in store for you he has inside of you Hallelujah you will show forth the Praises of his glory once you're in the right place isn't that right my God so we thank God to be in the right place at the right time God's got a promise for us tonight amen oh my so they choose to move forward despite what they're facing isn't that right that's that's what it means to endure amen uh uh so Hebrews 12 it says um for consider him that endureth such contradiction of Sinners against himself yes ye be woried and faint in your minds ye have not uh res yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and he have forgotten the exaltation which speaketh to you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when Thou Art rebuked of him for who whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receive it you've got to enjoy chastening you got to enjoy correction it's not again it is not a pleasant experience enjoying is not talking about a walk in the park or a Bed of Roses it's not something you particularly enjoy but you have to go through in order to come out Victorious on the other side you have to go through it some people give up halfway and and say I don't need to go through all of this I could just take a shortcut or pay $2,000 to the guy at the desk and get in legal something and I'll be good and then all of a sudden something happens along the way that they're not thinking about that that that stunts your growth when you could have stayed in the atmosphere when you could have stayed in the right place and done the right things you'd have made it out alive you'd have made it out successful um but some people don't go into the thing right and they end up with a scrap peap isn't my so see so we want to run the race and endure in this race the race that is set before us amen he said but um for whom God loveth he chasen it scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement whereof all all are partakers in other words all these Heroes of Faith were chastised at some point in time amen amen praise go when you make it to the other side you're going to hear Moses tell his story and Joshua tell his story and Joseph tell his story and this one and that one isn't that right they had to go through their stuff but they come through Victorious and if you go through your stuff with Jesus you're going to come through Victorious tonight isn't that right Joseph had no clue that he would have to go through Jail and to be wrong wrongfully accused of a trifling Woman by the uh poyer's wife we don't have her name but we know that she she she was a home wrecker she was a kind of a character and I think about her because her story almost seemingly just left unfinished you know we never hear about poyer's wife later on in the story I don't know if she ever got arrested later on down for for her trifling ways I don't know if she ever got caught if if her judgments ever got caught up with her the Bible never revealed whatever happened to Piper's wife as far as we know she's a dignitary's wife she went to the best restaurants she had a really nice wedding photography shoot at her wedding all of the best were there the Prime Minister and his wife was there and all the other dignitaries were there she has clinking glasses with the best she drinks from the best she has the best she has access to the best I pray isn't that right and here was Joseph just an immigrant slave trying to make his way through trying to keep his head low and do his N9 to five ends up in prison wrongfully accused from a woman who has everything got going for her and yet she still wants to step out of her crease to get something she feels she deserved and got him in trouble for it that seemed very unfair there's no story that tells us that Piper's wife ever got chastised or ever got thrown in prison or ever if that story was ever resolved but guess what tonight the story is not about Piper's wife the story is about Joseph and the story is not about anybody who accuse you or try to destroy you or try to discredit you or try to to take you down or try to V victimize your character the story is not about them tonight the story is about you the story is about how you going to run your race oh are you going to finish your course are you going to do what God called you to do are you going to stand for righteousness are you going to get the Holy Ghost and get out of here for this world is not my home I'm just passing through tonight and the devil is a liar no matter what he tried to throw at me or stick at me it won't stay because his grace is sufficient for me his his pardon Release Me From Any prison that the world can put me into I'm already free and who the son of man sets free is free indeed do you believe it tonight amen oh my we're getting ready to wind down you've been such a wonderful audience tonight amen praise God so he talks about chastising and so for like that isn't that right now no chastising at for the present seem to be joyous but Grievious nevertheless afterward if yield it yielded Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees is not is that right give God praise stay in prayer hallu and make path straight for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let uh let it rather be healed isn't that right oh my okay so I think we got the message there Amen brother baham said God pro uh Covenant with Abraham he said God doesn't take uh make any difference between his children every son that cometh to God must first be tried or chastised you get it first be tried or chastened or corrected child train schooled everyone not one exception everyone there's no exemption form there's no exemption form you could fill out and say well I want to be Exempted from this trial because I have a bad ankle uh or because I I have a little more money in my bank account than the other guy there's no exemption forms if you fill out an exemption forms it gets thrown into the bin the bin is where we put all the exemption forms from the ones who want to escape the trial because there really is no escape from The Trial tonight everyone that cometh to God must go through trials and testing isn't that right the prophet said have you went through trials have you went through tribulation have you suffered persecution then you endure these things and you're are real children of God Prophet said Hallelujah but when you can't bear chastisement when the rod comes down heavy and you run off and back into the world the Bible said you are illegitimate children and not the the children of God for when a man's born of the spirit of God he expects those things oh my wonderful he expects those things he's looking for correction because he wants to see how he can get better isn't that right and you learn more from your failures than your successes you learn more from the stuff you did wrong than when you're on top of the mountain it's the valley that teaches us how to trust God it's a valley that teaches us how to temper our faith it's a Valley that teaches us how to wait on God wait for God and get right with God so that we when we're on the top it just reflects the things we've learned when we are at the bottom amen isn't that right he loves those things and the Bible said that when the Trials come upon us fiery trials it is more precious than gold to US think of it the prophet said so you see with these ups and downs they've never been in there at the first place they just uh make believe amen salvation is for believers not unbelievers or make Believers it's for True genuine Believers and it's not a case of Law and God's going to make you do something but it's because you love to do it amen amen praise God what the prophet say they will love him and they will keep his Commandments they will have thus sayth the Lord or they will keep still amen that's the Bride of the last day do you believe it endure see the important thing Prophet said one of the important things we must Master now remember thise he said especially you young preachers oh you speaking to me now amen lay members alike amen there's one thing we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think we can do it on our own oh my oh wonderful intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we could get rid of the thing oh kick it out entirely that's wonderful amen and lay it aside so that God can use us that's right and make a complete surrender oh I love this we cannot use one ability we've got to make a complete surrender and come to God you've got to surrender to him both soul body and spirit everything that you are has to be surrendered to God in order that he can work his will in you and me oh do you believe that tonight amen and amen praise God hallelujah I'm getting ready to close out Prophet said he swore by himself if our foundation is firm and sure in Jesus Christ then brother there's nothing can shake you he said you're you're just anchored oh my all right he said and after he said 15th verse now after that he had patiently endured he obtained the promise Prophet said oh say I don't know whether we're going to get down to that se chapter or not praise God but he said after that he patiently endured amen he obtained the promise the prophet said can you say the same thing this morning can you say the same thing tonight can you set your faith and say it's thus sayth the Lord and no matter what comes or goes whether today is easy or tomorrow is hard and the next day they're teasing you the next day they're making fun of you the next day they say I'm crazy he said brother BR said I Endure amen amen and he said after he said not before he endured but after he endured he obtained the promise oh so there's a promise to gain tonight after that you endure amen and amen amen you can only overcome after you've endured after you've come through everything isn't that right brother see can get come forth man I'm closing up here bre in praise God oh Wonderful Tonight here my my here it is he said you see it brother he said that shakes all the devils and everything else away see see there it is and pro Prophet said Satan come up Satan come up and say oh now I tell you you're just a little worked up you just might as well just kind of reasonable about this thing and and and he said but say say thus say the Lord Satan no matter how hard it comes what it looks like what anybody says he said I want to with patience not with fretting person can can't have patience and freten all the time uh uh uh you just go to set your sails right straight right there he said and walk right on no matter what takes place move right on Prophet said listen I'm going to say something uh uh praise God is not oh okay I'll skip on down here amen they you love it tonight amen amen amen hallelujah glory to God Amen pray we begin to play something softly and here you are to fulfill it too he said right see he just what walk on walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism we heard about unconscious Faith right he said walk unconscious to the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right hand or to the left just keep moving on and if something comes up in the church walk with God hallelujah he said if sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep on Walking with God you can begin to stand each one day R walk with God just like that he said Enoch one day walked like that and he said you know what he done he walked all the way home with God got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore amen he said walk with God doctor says you're going to die walk with God yeah doctor says you can well walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised you he said I'll never leave you or forsake you but I'll be with you to the end of of the world that's his word tonight oh and it cannot fall to the ground he took an oath by the Covenant that he gave you that he would confirm it he said just walk with God then he said you'll have your ups and downs said but don't worry you got to go through Brier patches sharp rocks over Buffs and over hillsides and all up through the mountains over the waters he said but walk with God yes sir there's so many Hills to climb up with you've heard that old song but how little it'll seem when you get to the end of the way my my just look at there all that's been look back at your Footprints he said it won't be very much but random said get weak so you could get strong it'll conquer every devil it'll put the learner to shame it'll bring men and women whom God has called and that only oh Hallelujah he said remember as it was in the days of no Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man eight Souls were saved in the Days of Elijah was 7,000 only had it oh just think of where we're living now and when John come on the scene the little church certainly was in the minority but there was empty vessels to pour the oil in Hallelujah let's empty ourselves out tonight oh god let's empty ourselves up get empty friends get weak deny your own ability and you out in radio not in radio but that hear these tapes he said wherever they come empty yourselves out and pour yourselves out upon God's altar as a sacrifice and let the angel come with a coal of fire and fill that vessel with the power of the almighty God and get then and then he'll make you strong he'll give you Grace to stand oh I'm finished tonight may the Lord richly bless you oh hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah let's give him
