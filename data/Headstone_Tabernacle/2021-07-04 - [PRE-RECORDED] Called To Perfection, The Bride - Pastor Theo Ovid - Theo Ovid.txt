father we know your blood is here this morning speaking on our behalf we are so unworthy we look away to you we are dependent upon you without you we can do anything bless your word bless your people father and jason we ask it amen and amen god bless you and i want to go straight into the word no comments we have matthew chapter 5 1 verse 48 we are first corinthians chapter 13 verse 9 and 10. hebrews chapter 6 one verse was one thank you musicians my what's singing this morning my mind is blown uh sometime when i'm speaking or talking about old-fashioned or home-cooked fire when everybody brings the fire from home then they put it together in the church we have a real bonfire and i feel that that that's what we have this morning amen and i'm so appreciative of that that you are applying the word i could feel it feel the anointing my goodness oh we are grateful to god so reading matthew chapter five to read verse 48 be there for perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect and from first corinthians chapter 13 9-10 for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away we also go to hebrews chapter 6 verse 1. therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection amen not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith towards god let us pray father we thank you for the reading of your word any man could read the scriptures we have had scriptures read for so many years but it will take the holy ghost to come and anoint the word and breed life and fire and presence and power and deliverance and quicken the word to the people father made a ministry of the spirit be effective today in jesus name we ask it amen on amen before you have your seats i want to turn around and shake somebody's hands and greet somebody in jesus name just before you have your seats so oh glory you may be seated when you give the lord some praise it's always a privilege to be in the presence of god amen amen to be under the anointing of the spirit just think without the spirit of god we're just another group of people on a sunday morning just gathering together and meeting each other and shaking each other's hands when the spirit of god is here makes a whole difference in the entire world praise the lord there are some who in life are called into different vocations careers positions examples to be a writer a doctor teacher mechanic farmer an engineer father minister but besides all of that or in addition to that there's another calling a higher calling this call differentiates them from others this is a call to perfection there are some who are great family persons they genuinely love and care about the family but besides that they still remain a higher calling they are those who are content and satisfied nothing moves them nothing really inspires or motivates them they have it all figured out how it should be how they want it how they see it and according to where they are in life they control everything around them especially if they have money power and position there are those who are not fortunate to be in money power opposition life just swirls around them things happen to them and around them they're those who somebody always do them hurt them affect them stumble them hinder them they're those who choose to be lazy have no ambition no desire for anything life is just so so for them life just happens they are no better off in spirit and attitude and behavior after 5 10 15 years they are the same person they always was all types go to church all say amen but there's a bunch of individuals among those who are called to perfection something drives them a purpose a deep an unexplained something that drives them to dig deeper climb higher press further certain key words connect to these types i press towards the mark forgetting the things that are passed i can do all things through christ let us go on to perfection aimlessly contending for the fate these are actionable words things to apply and effect change in one's life a call to perfection only the bride will have that call some are called to follow the message come and call to follow a church some are called to follow family follow a preacher or minister or church or congregation that they love take them out of that congregation they are lost they can't find happiness for them it's church choosing the minister of their chosen they have a real struggle to struggle they have a problem to accept praise god hallelujah that all things work together for good to them that love god hallelujah they have a problem to accept that nothing takes god by surprise god doesn't wave his eye open his eyes big like something surprising they have trouble accepting that nothing takes god by surprise hallelujah they have problems accepting trials except intestines except in tribulation they really don't want any of that god is not at the center point god is not your center point god is oh hallelujah money is god is not their center point the family is god is not your center point self is i me i god the word is a reference point it's like a dictionary a book that you check the meaning of the word sometimes there is no real burden to see god to see his power to see his glory there is no daily the life is a daily judge but there are some who are called to perfection [Music] and the title of the message this morning is called to perfection the bride that's my title this morning call to perfection the bride and an inspiration when that which is perfect it's come on i'm feeling good to be here tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah so now we come down where the tire hits the road come down to the real deal know in part prophesying part accept a lot of things in part but there comes all when part is no longer you know good enough you see when you know when when when better is expected god is not good enough when it reaches where it's a standard and a requirement where it comes to the higher calling all of a sudden you find yourself naked you find yourself undone you find yourself needing to come up to meet god requirement that is what this means let us go on to perfection the bride being called to that perfection so it would mean allowing christ to move in every era of yourself and life i'm going to change those words allow in christ to invade your self life your human spirit not just have christ on a sunday morning the anointing in the presence and you you get a quote and you read get a scripture no no no but but it becomes a daily inventory a daily connecting with a daily receiving of and from now you understand why the prophet said read your bible and pray every day and you're going to grow hallelujah not live in church some people who they feel they could live in church the wichita churches have rooms where they could stay away from the devil away from trials the only hearing songs and psalms like angels singing harp playing but the bible said the trial of your faith being more precious inside the church some people go to church and get a fight i don't understand that i'm not going there but the thing of it is is when you leave here when you get out there then give god the opportunity and give the devil an opportunity to see what you hear and what you really [Applause] believe as far as devil concern you went to you're going to you you're going to hear things he's not even sure you believe those things you were hearing and he have a right to investigate that but god using him to fix you right you don't hear what i'm saying you're not hearing what i'm saying if you understand that you will thank god that the devil is a good adversary [Applause] and god made you worthy of combat you don't hear what i'm saying qualified to lose you under your doors put the new recruit up new recruit on the battlefield you have to get trained they're going to put you on lives that fulfill so really and truly it have no room to be children be no more children get your boots get your clothes because we are going somewhere oh glory to god so some point in time that which is perfect must come and then we have to step up now to meet up with it oh glory to god god we give the lord a shout hallelujah [Applause] says allowing the holy spirit to come and influence your human personality you living and walking and moving and applying the presence of god there are too many who contend just to be saved just to be messaged babies and they're looking for pampers every service under our purse it's not something there are doors nobody could tell them anything not even the husband wife not even the pastor they are truly on their own they want to run their life their own way by their own emotions by their own fancies whatever come whatever they want they want and if they don't get that they get they're going to attract it to a tantrum as if that's what children do you know that's what children do they throw tensions and you see god god have no time with that god will leave you in your tantrum and when you finish you still god god will leave you in trouble and when you finish he is still god until you understand he has no time with that because the whole creation is groaning struggling travailing for the manifestation of not children of the sons of god when born sons mature sons responsible sons qualified sons anointed sons trained sons sons who fail and rise back up some who get knocked back down and knock up and come back up all rugged sons gutsy sons overcoming sons sons you're not afraid to fail because failure doesn't make you a failure feeling doesn't make you a failure healing doesn't make you a failure or give the lord a shout we have a word from the lord for you today [Applause] [Applause] [Music] i'll repeat that you must want an experience with god said so i don't care what your feelings tell you it's what god said you have to experience the word against your feelings the word against your emotions the word against your better judgment [Applause] did you get that if isaiah was studying his thinking and his mind when god said say of what he shall conceive as i would say as i was saying could you repeat that but isaiah was in that mood when god's approaching you conceived he shall force you to conceive how could that virgin could you did you show you me do you really want me to to say that no no these guys not using the head that this holy man moved but by the holy ghost the holy ghost by passing the head and striking the heart and the heart going to the mouth to speak the word right out so these guys was only speaking what god put upon the heart one time a man come and say speak speak what everybody else say and he said i want to speak what god put in my mouth i cannot speak what i feel to speak i gospe god not allowing me to do that because the word comes to me the word of the lord came to jeremiah the word of the lord came to ezekiel the word of the lord it comes to them bypass their mind dropping their heart as a thought and when they speak it it expresses a word [Music] are you ready for some more we talk about perfection and some people freeze but i'm not talking about sinless perfection let the word tell you about this thing called perfection from god's provided way no righteous man is not a sinless man for if you notice he said elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are he had his ups and downs his defaults differences and the scripture of his life proves he had his ups and downs like we do but he had times of wondering his times that his temper got away from him he had lots of things that went wrong but he was still a righteous man because he confessed his unworthiness and believed in god so that is what made him righteous we are not righteous within ourselves we are righteous through jesus christ i cannot be sanctified within myself i am sanctified through jesus christ who stands in the presence of god in my place it isn't my holiness it's his holiness my holiness won't work at all but his does because god done accepted him and in accepting him he had to accept me because i am in him and that's what make it real [Music] then we don't have to depend on ourselves now that doesn't make us to say we can sin brother if you sin you just gotta be from god that's all there's only one thing to do confess it get right with god as long as you desire to sin this desire of sin is still in your heart then it's time for you to stay at the altar till that thing is taken out now you will sin you are bound to sin cause you just can't help it not willful sin but he that sins willfully after receive the knowledge of truth they remain no sacrifice for sin but every day you're born to sin you are born to be backslidden constantly so it takes a constant prayer to god that's why paul said i die daily and if paul had to die daily how much more am i going to have to stay and dead all the time if paul had to die daily to stay right with god we all have to do that to die out to ourselves and that is getting god's way oh can we give the lord some praises people hallelujah and there's only two ways of doing anything that's the right way and the wrong way and them ways are your ways and god ways and you can't be in your way and god we at the same time you've got to forget your own way to get into god's way and you've got to get out of your own way to get in god's way as long as you're in your own way you're out of history so forsake your way forsake your thoughts forsake everything and rely on just say the lord and then you know you're right though you can't see it none of the sensibility is right every one of them will say it's wrong but you know what it's right because god said so amen so you are rejecting and denying and giving your senses trouble your sense is boring you know but you are saying god set you up god's provided way for humans is to live not by your senses but by his word because humans was given these five senses to contact them here but a different sense was given to contact up there god put man his own image and god is a supernatural being he was a supernatural man and none of those five senses declare his heavenly home so those five senses the food they said nice that does not mean they haven't really have any home you're touching this you're feeling this and your emotions don't do what you have only home or what you're feeling experience in these five senses it's for down here could we give the lord some praises are you with me so these five senses control the human body and two senses control the inside man faith and unbelief you've possessed one or the other oh my i think it's a good thing in florida somebody's death was three monkeys one of them had his hand over his eyes see no evil or the one on his fingers over his ears hear no evil the other one had it over his mouth speak no evil i think that's a good thing you keep your mind pure on christ no you see if you don't watch you will get yourself over into a place and thinking you would you you can't live listen you can't live so perfect till you don't make that mistake now don't you think you'll ever get that way you are not sinless and you are certainly you will certainly get off of the track on this side or that side but a man that wants knock down if he's a real sawyer he'll rise up again so don't ever talk about a man knock dog knock down oh you're not don't come yet maybe you still crawling yes i don't walk yet that's why you ain't full yet but once you are managed eight you'll get knocked down hear what the prophet said lord let me rise and try again but a coward as soon as he sees he make a little mistake like the bug on the water spider will go right back in the water again so that's why some people they don't ever get criticism because it doesn't they do nothing they try nothing they affect nothing they stand for nothing they're just like a dish rag everybody loves them they have trouble with no hope howdy they are very good and nice if they pre-see them you play spring with holy water they'll make them an acolyte in the church or whatever it is nobody troubles them nobody bothers them they bother nobody they're just nasty nicey but anytime you try to do something there's always going to be opposition always going to be criticism for the kingdom of god you think the devil just lays back and said oh go ahead uh god bless you the devil and god bless you god already bless you what a pronounced blessing on the devil he is yet to hinder upset amen for straight and sauna once you understand that your whole picture begin to change and recognize truly romans 8 28 apply and we know we know we know if others don't know we know that all things not some things all things do you believe that you could say amen to that but do you really believe that because when things happen you don't believe it [Applause] because your behavior demonstrates you don't believe it [Applause] your commenting then go in hand and when you find single you'll take it back out and god said i told you i'm leaving it take it back yes because i had to fix them i can't stand this no more i can't take this no more i can't take this no more and you raise your voice at whoever really where is that and the reason we said god and all right because you're all right it's up to you because i'm forcing you so go say oh to my hand now it's your hands and you know how your hands is already yeah you're long enough you know how your hands is already yeah i'm not good your hand is troubled all by itself so god said waiting waiting for the bring it back and said oh you know get the message bring it back to my hands i could take care of it i could handle it my hand's big enough to deal with it oh glory to god this is what i want you to do dependent upon me oh get the lord and shout in the house [Applause] god looking through the blood he doesn't see you no more as a sinner he sees you're redeemed you're redeemed because he sees you through christ that's not enough amen and just i don't want to rebuke you but amen means that you are confirming that you believe that word [Applause] when you don't say amen the devil says in you amen it's you confirming the word to be god you are saying this is my truth and the truth is what sets me free i will say it again god sees you through christ sound like 75 percent [Applause] amen thank i say it again just one more time this morning right now god not seen you with your glasses with your extra hair on your special here with your stockings with your shoes with your tie he's not seeing your color clothes [Applause] with your cologne with the perfume he's not seeing that with the brand new shoes [Applause] right now he is seeing you through christ oh give the lord a shout oh thank god for the blood this morning [Applause] so god looking through the blood amen he doesn't see you no more than sinner he sees you as redeemed you're redeemed because he is always he always i miss that word he always sees you through christ that's the reason we can be perfect [Music] not perfect nose perfect mouth perfect teeth you will get perfect wrinkles perfect ball head perfect gray hair and you will go to a perfect grave so forget about it we are not talking about this physical thing this natural thing we're not talking about that not perfect in the sense of sinless we are perfect in the eyes of god when we are in christ that's the reason be there for perfect as your father miss perfect he doesn't mean walk with a long gun and a beard and do your hand like that he doesn't mean that it means you are gonna be in him when he died at calvary he made a win he gave up his spirit the holy spirit sent it back on the earth for you to live by that's what calvary means to us to follow him okay now we have got to accept it and to accept it is to accept his personal in our hearts then we are free from sin the perfect sacrifice made us perfect for jesus said be there for perfect even as your father is perfect there is no more to be done but we are made perfect in the presence of god now dear is where we lose our position if we don't watch we try to look back to what we was and as long as we look back to what we was the sacrifice means nothing to us you know i come like you're a smoker you're a drinker you're a real terrible person and god come in as mercy and love and they get saved they get baptized and you have oh simply wash my sins away and leave your burden down my riverside and so on carry them no more and you're feeling in love with christ all the birds all the birds looking fresh on you everybody's bred people hugging you and loving you and whatnot after a few tries and what time the fun thing you feel is so strong you start to make your point so they get arrogant and whatnot and afterwards afterwards something happens next inside look at yourself and you start to perfect yourself you start to think for yourself and carry them about yourself that's not what god wants he wants you dependent on him surrender to him heal it to him he'll love you just when you first come to the lord you know take a little baby and say baby walk people can talk god ain't taking no christian baby no small babe in christ and say walk speak the word you can't talk you don't even know what god say so as far as god is concerned it's bottle of milk for you the sincere milk of the world that's what you need until you grow in god that you can handle more stuff as you go is that less stuff is more amen because we want more from you we are at the end of the age at the end of time we want manifestation from you that means we have to become the word we have to become like christ you have to walk i can talk i can act like him we have to be perfect like him not sinless perfection oh give the lord so watch can you see a church i would not try the job there's no need of trying you're lost to begin with as long as you look at what you've done but don't look to what you've done look at what calvary did for you it paid your price it settled the question your sins be a scarlet they'll be white as snow red like crimson white like wool then you have no sin you're perfectly sinners no matter what you have done or what you do you're still sinless as long as you have accepted jesus christ as your savior your sins are forgiven anything that's forgiven is remitted and forgot about hallelujah what does it do it gives you after the condition his spirit to follow him and do as he did he was just one man a perfect man he gave his life he made an example for you that we must do the first i want to say is jesus here we go never live for himself so as we say this you have to examine you jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfect eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others husband love your wife that is for your wife wife or be a husband or respect your husband and reference your husband that is for your wife so i will salute all those sisters who find yourself their spirit in the bible your husband could testify about your subjection about your behavior on your attitude if god gave your husband to correct your papers he have full marks to give you he must have to get light and if god gave the wisely paper to cut the husband he she has full marks to give because he's loving his wife he's cares for his wife and so on she in other words god not giving a husband to correct his own people people don't do you don't do that you don't get the children the paper and say correct correct they were all important on it but god will give the wife god will give the husband i said how do they fear well my goodness my husband he is such a abraham i want to be a sarah oh god because everybody say amen hallelujah he's such an ibrahim i want to call him lord oh you're not hearing what i'm saying oh jesus i don't want to go there i don't want to go there you don't want when the wife no my husband [Music] no you don't want that you want your spirit to be in the scriptures because god going to bless his word and once your spirit is in the word i don't care but i'm saying give me a housewife give me a farmer give me a preacher any man that will put god first i will show you somebody that will be successful despite all what the devil come against them glory hallelujah i know what god wants to make it his proof jesus is alive how are we know that you you vindicated he's alive you are confirming your life confirms that he is alive because your life is being changed oh do you believe that do you receive that now here we go now so watch his sinless nature express god's word oh my he was the word so god express himself by his sinless nature now look how let's go deep notice his sinless nature expressed what he was if his sinless nature god expressed himself through that sinless nature it shows that our nature is evil 10 say amen your nature will be real good boy his nature was sinless proving our nature is evil in case you forget let me remind you that we were born in sin and i know sometimes we forget that because we we go to church and we are christians amen amen glory but i want to remind you that you were born in sin and shaped in iniquity and happened to come into the world without your mother teaching you speaking lies and that is because of a nature issue hallelujah so christ come to address that nature issue that you can be transformed and and peter said by these promises we become partakers of his divine nature now you have a natural faith and natural virtue a natural kindness and naturalness and natural that that is still you that's not his nature you have to fire bomb that you have to blow that up so that's not your patience patience you're playing patient you're playing patient until somebody just rock you off your own patience you say you can't stand it no more you're fed up you can't take it no more your patience run out but his patience can run out it's the patience of jesus christ could somebody say amen oh hallelujah this is making it real [Applause] his virtue his knowledge his temperance hallelujah his charity charity suffered how long you're suffering you you're suffering short and yeah you know charity traffic suffering law so if you're feeling short you you start yet a classic kind of suffering because it's bringing out certain things out to you [Applause] you can't go to the hospital doctor get my stick here doctor i want the red one that's nothing sweet that thing in that bottle there oh wow i do like that black looking one give me the red one why don't you say what you come to me for take whatever you want fix yourself it cannot be that when the doctor put all his instruments and saying well your heart your diss your dad you need this you see i need along like that you say i want a short needle and say what this say come and come this long little one is it dark he said to in your eyes if you really want to be cured you really want to help you have to get a long needle you have to get this particular tablet let it get its operation you have to get this you have to get down when you come to the gospel dr jesus is here this morning and when you use a sword which is his word he's make a clean cut don't move don't do like it's not you with you say amen but it cut you'll be healed one time too hallelujah cut off the excess flesh cut out the world cut out of the world cut out along the leaf put the desire back in your heart in your spirit we are going to have a revival [Applause] so watch if it all right so it shows up when it is evil and no matter how much here we go no matter how much we try to patch it up [Music] you could tie it up jack it up long dress it up messes up wear book red tie where pain mark jesus loves me look at nothing like that that i'm not doing with nature not much behind that now it's bad behavior behind that so we're not talking about that so be real people god going to change you and transform you that's why god loved i could see why god loved jacob he was real he was really out to trick everybody good trick he wasn't making playing with no tricks saying he wasn't patrick's in 10 tricks a hundred percent father brother mother sister anybody at all ripping them off [Music] that was jacob but god said jacob i love yes [Applause] because one thing with jacob he's focused he wants to be the best thief the best con man the best his focus or when he

judge anybody how do you think the message world will judge a woman at the well it's only because you record there how jesus handler they could talk about but let that come back again not troubling to show action attitude behavior life that's what i'm saying it's it's good to look back on the records of david and samson and different things and so they stand up and and and and and something say once more lord and whatnot and whatnot it's good because you could read that you could rejoice about that but but you could you think you're losing your eyes i'm making a jail sentence and coming out

no matter how much we try to patch it up how much you try to i like this word indocumented with other things that's another word but there's the prophet word in documenting other things it's got to become sinless like he was then god's word can flow through it that's a big one he is saying we've got to become sinless like he was let's go down deeper that don't mean perfection in yourself you can't beat that [Music] then he said even our people are getting from the practice of holiness wholeness have to be practiced it's a choice action for you to sanctify yourself turn ahead some filthy woman aim and go in the right places and so that is something that you have to do nobody can't do that for you you have to do that you have to overcome you have to fight you have to get off your laziness and say you know what enough is enough deadness finish bad attitude finish enough is enough my mind has to transform god transform my mind [Applause] hallelujah glory amen sinless need to express the word of god so much that he and the word was one he said i and my father are one i ordered that which pleases and my father one he was so perfect in the image of god until he and god was expressed the same thing he was the flesh the son expressed the deity of god so that made him deity and man in order to redeem man he and the word was one now i am not sinless but a random speaker i've got plenty hanging on me and every hour i confess it constantly now that has to do with all with relationship with god this is not church now because you come to church once every sunday and if

be free from the devils that torment in you all these years do you want it finished with overweight don't wait oh glory to god somebody give the lord a shelter praise [Applause] jesus [Music] he was the word in full the word of god flow to him so freely that he could speak the word it will create amen that's how powerful it was through jesus and he knew it when at lazarus did he said father i pray i know you always hear me but for those are wrong and so he knew he knew the power of his words when the lazarus is dead and he said he's sleeping i go wake him he he knew he knew the power of of the words in his mouth it was so powerful one day he said back and forth have not have not earth will pass away but my words will never pass but that's the power that was in his mouth and that coming to the sons of god in the last days so how would god entrust men with such power if they have no character some men don't like me you know what they will do speak me out of existence they will say i ain't like to you of it disappear it's only that right now when they speak them things it just their words just disappearing because there's a human god not even bothered with that god not even honoring that so i could see the burden of god all these years was to get his word in his people because he really want to entrust you with power i'm going to stephen brought a tremendous exhortation on sunday but olivery on tuesday night that god's pleasure is to see you adopted it's the good pleasure of his will god is getting excited [Applause] did you get that god himself is getting excited because the pleasure his pleasure is being fulfilled when is his sons coming into maturity sons coming in character sons with the burden of the word with the burden of god i always do that which pleases my father sometime i was preaching how could you please god if you don't know his will if your dog go into his word how will you know his will you need to get the word to know his will because his word reveals his will and that is how you please him you can say please and god lord that's the whole thing with with um abel and king king and evil god say offer something and and and either just bring flowers and say well take that i i feel like to drop that on you flowers fruits and what the cane can do that yeah it'll take a lamb it's not looking look so pretty take a rock slash detroit blood come out and god rejoice over that he said abel offer a better sacrifice than king okay so god rejecting offering can get right god said listen again listen again you don't even need revelation just do what your brother do and you'll get the same blessing he get you don't even need a revelation he did it i confirm it and bless it if you do what he do he shall you shall he prays you pray he pray you pray he prays you press come on now come on now help me somebody you hearing all of this god don't want your um keep him keep keep it god don't need it he want to hear your mouth shout out [Applause] when i beg you to shout shout and the world's gonna come tumbling down [Applause] hallelujah what did prophet say about adoption he wanted to say there is my spirit flowing freely not doctrine being taught teaching [Music] in cameroon he said before you could speak the truth in love you have to have a love of the truth [Applause] i just love that i just love that before you could speak the truth and love you see many men speak lovely the truth but you have to have a love for truth allah for what is right allah for what is principle glory oh we are different amen you know that right so he was perfect in harmony with him and the word was so perfectly until he created whatever he done here and the word become one he the bridegroom took away your shame amen and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word of god hallelujah listen so now we understand is not sinless perfection now we understand righteousness doesn't mean no sin in that sense because the confession is through the blood through christ now you're gonna get this quote let me see what they're gonna do for you this is from invisible unity bride he said you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church he said if you are standing on god's word with god's word amen every every title what i'm telling you pull away from the shots get out there in the wheat where you can write before the sun i hear the comment of the combine you are standing complete justified not forgiven this is a bigger word than forgiven justify means you never did it so when satan bring up his his confirmation sheet and the evidence of all what he recorded you doing with his tape recorder because he videotaping and he's accusing the veteran and he come to play it back go to where when how and god say where christ died at calvary shed his blood pay the price all of a sudden satan's scream goes you say where as he's called about the blood on the cross see then you know what happened you can't see it you can't see your sins you can't see where your fall can't see where you're feeling you can't see anything go go take all your sins and drop it you'll be seated drop it in the sea of forgetfulness listen he ain't drop it that they floating you know because they float and sit and pick it up so he had to drop it with some kind of rocks maybe the rock is christ and you just drop it drop it drop your sins down in in the sea of forgetfulness see i think you'll find that therefore you could free the way of your hand you're free to say amen glory hallelujah you're free to worship you're free to smile some of you have smiled good for a long time very smart babies man no you feel the laugh hallelujah because you are free you free to have joy [Applause] you may be seasoned your joy is not in your husband your joy is not in your life your joy is not in your children your joy nothing your money or your pay

him will i put my trust oh some trusted army and horsemen but i trust in the lord glory talk about thanksgiving you are the pure food you are sinless bride of the son of the living god every man that's born of the spirit of god watching the blood of jesus christ believes the word stand as though you never sin at the first place you are perfect you are standing completely like you never stand in the fruit god don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness not even god can remember it amen you are the virtuous bride of christ washing the blood of christ precious virtue of sinners you see god telling me that god telling you that this is what say the bride she is the one that is the called to perfection some people call to for church they love church bad they can't get rid of the system tell them the word that's not important to them they love church they like the singing they like the pastor they like the believers they like they like how they think go and whatnot some people like the old time where the old time away the old time songs as i said all the jews squeeze out of those songs they sing it so long so much you have no more juice in it you can't get voodoo from these songs no more i want to bring a new song they get fight but the old song is like old tradition [Music] and you know the devil is staying old-timer this is your point the devil not saying old time i test looter so i had to give him a literal test definitely nothing nothing never know all what he loose and looted like salute him because i was horse and buggy bunnies internet age where the children don't even know what it is they have a book just now they wouldn't even know the spin page you don't need the tablet so like they're born and they only seen a tablet in front of themselves in the present listen that he is in that personage and you want to have the old time prayer lord you know how it is pressure and when god started hear you pray that god has been a god feeling shame for son in this last day to be talking that kind of talk it's almost embarrassing when you're supposed to become the revelation of the blood when you should be coming with a version of authority when the child comes sick in your house or your neighbor sent for you and you could go and sit by the authority vested in me as a son of god in jesus name get out god must be able to find you anywhere [Applause] and you are ready to utter a prayer unto god [Applause] that's the life i'm talking about that's the life worthy of the gospel of jesus christ not when they call you i can't come now you know um because i i am feeling good in my heart so what are you going to church for who's supposed to feeling good and happy piper you coming to church you're supposed to have a hard thing like people god supposed to be sending people to you listen god sent out a possum for the prophet to pray animal and all coming to the prophet i read something internet today some elephant an elephant was shot nobody knew the elephant shot and the elephant went up a hill by a whole bunch of people to get help they said normally a elephant would stay down on the plane and whatnot and the man knew something was wrong they sent her a doctor he'd be covering a check on the elephant was shot and what the elephant train treat him or whatnot elephant they said the intelligent animal every frontier gets shot and say you know what i'm going strong [Laughter] i don't call the pastor i ain't calling no elder i'll pay god for myself afterwards elephant dead that's what we're here for you're sick call the elders they're in trouble call somebody don't just sit there and die do something this is what i'm here for to be disturbed as long as i am not disturbed i can disturb mine or this stupid man but i'm here to be disturbed i'm here to take up a responsibility that is why you identify yourself to belong to this church you ask to be a member of this church you pay your tithes you're offering in this church then i'm responsible then you have issues you have challenges that is where you get a phone call your call you want to see the pastor you want to talk you want to relate you want help and sometimes a word comes maybe people come in the office and they get a direct word from the lord i'm not even thinking but because god sees your need he has to use a vessel you have to use an office you have to use the position that's what it is about so when you sit down in your human spirit thinking i want to do this i want to do this how are we going to look how are we going to look how are you going to look when you nikov you look like a pretty cops don't just sit there and die live god wants you alive you can't praise him in the grave come [Applause] on listen somebody could be 92 95 95 96 years old you don't hear him say look at the dead you know boy where'd he go from they're looking to see the next birthday with cake and cameras to blow out some of you want to look more dead than them that's why i can't handle the dead young people and even that old people and all we're not supposed to be we're not supposed to be addressing death we're not supposed to be preaching to the dead we determine this yet to be raised up no body should leave you dead if you're dead you're supposed to be resurrect by telling your service is over if you're backsliding you want to be restored if you're a sinner you want to be saved but you're here to enjoy the lord oh glory that god enjoys covering and blessing you are covered this morning you know bright blood but i know some of you don't understand that yet but the devil job is to make sure you don't get understanding amen to be blindsided you don't have full information that you could be sidetracked and knocked off the position that you're in if the devil could get you to believe your sword is a butter knife then they wouldn't use it as a sword you see that long thing you have there that could do a good button and look the badgering here look at the blue burning here dip it and paste your bed with that if you listen to that devil you will take a sword and find yourself stick it in iso and button your bread quite here so use a butter knife for that but when you understand the word is a sword and when you pick it in the hand the hand of faith is what going to conquer that devil and recognize you are sons and daughters of living god you're not children you're not babies praise god you're not idiots come on now you're not just dumb dumb people glory to god god bless you with sense and understanding god called you into this message that you could be shaped that you can be formed that you could be honed that you can be cut that you can represent him on the earth you're not a church boy you're a son of god you're a good man come on give the lord a shout you're not ashamed of the gospel you are happy to be in the gospel i am not ashamed of the son of man nor his words oh glory to god what a blessed message that we have received from that malachi for elijah prophet oh hallelujah thank god for that profit [Applause] oh hallelujah oh glory to god as in that dragon anointing descends in america hallelujah that land anointed but he set up on the bride oh hallelujah praise god i'm going to try to wrap up here at home stretch sin john 16. 12 jesus speaks i have many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now i like that in other words i wouldn't waste my time talking stuff to you now that you can't handle how be it when he he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you first corinthians 2 6 to 8 how we do speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that come to know it but we speak wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto her glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory if they knew it if they knew it they wouldn't crucify the effect of the word upon the people because we supposed to be looking for a seven thunderbird revival if they knew it they wouldn't crucify the effect of the seven seal upon the people if they knew it they wouldn't crucify this message the way they have and reduces the denominational denomination where you just have the books and the tips and the prophets and man just say a few things couldn't have done that listen to what abraham said marginally voice know that the seals are open amen the spirit of truth directs us to the word give the lord a praise did you hear that okay write with me for the home stretch now know that the seas are open what the spirit of truth because remember this image has come from trinity to gather the scattered word to tie it back into the word to bring down the holy ghost so the holy ghost is to open the seals which was the spirit of truth released to all the earth so he is saying now that the seas are open the spirit of truth directs us to the word that explain all the mystics made down to the ages god never did have any time a group of men to run his church it's always been the holy spirit amen the holy spirit that's the teacher when this prayer that you just come he will guide you into all truth the holy ghost alone is the divine revealer of the divine revelation of christ the holy ghost alone so therefore it disconnects this top man teacher man best man more educated man more limited man or more revelated man amen we know that's not a word but that is what he's talking about he is more revelated he has more revelation so he's the man of the hour yet the bible talk about doctrines of devils the devil's bringing doctrines to teach no more talking no more lies than manifest you believe this you don't really get out of it we believe we believe we believe like as if the detention when they shall come they just say we believe we believe we believe no all was commissioned is when i see the blood i'll pass over so all them were teaching and adopting and the the vets because because the vets because we're not riding with deduction and teachers it's foolishness could you live in london england tell them when imagine any businesses had the right and and and and they tighten up and whatnot somebody come with some coach somebody quoting a prophet in last days the beast will lick them up yeah man you can't go on with beast's system after 50 plus years and talk about ghosts look tell them in london you have to become the book by then it's beast power you know it's a force in you know understand this it wasn't easy for those two boys to say we will not bow down we still praying they took a stand they were working with the government and they took a stand and they take the penalty of it fiery furnace they don't care you can be the best worker the best this when pressure compression come laws come laws come america being wrapped up in laws they're creating the laws that they could shut down the churches they're creating the laws fixing up homosexuals freaking out transgender fixing up everybody else it's an agenda loose by the devil to ensure those christians are squeezed out according to prophecy that no man buy or sell unless they take the mark of the peace so they sit here and watch on me something is moving something is turning but when that bit is perfect is come we have a higher calling hallelujah it's easy to join the church you could leave this one and join that one and join that one that's easy but to answer the call to perfection that's different you got yourself that's mean you're gonna get your life shake up but ram said this way it means a lot of shaking down for me it means a lot of shaking down for you but together we gonna make it by the grace of god perfection means shake up hallelujah you cannot continue as you are oh my we are grateful to you to know we are living in the last days just before the coming of just one that wonderful glorious loving son of yours our lord and savior jesus christ who we love and we know the bible speaks of an appearing before the coming listen good this is good did you hear that the bible speaks of the appearance before they're coming and there's a difference in the word appearing and then coming now further we realize that the church has come through the stage of justification come to the stage of sanctification come to the stage of receiving the holy spirit now the stones are being owned for the fitting of the ministry of jesus christ so god has to cut men to fit that god had cut in the military to fit the man god cut into man to fit the ministry and every man i caught you good enough he can't fit because he had to be fitted in oh give the lord some praise people now remember appearing uncommon is two different words to appear and then to come no is the appearing he already appeared in these last days right here with us in the last few years no it's a sign of his coming he's appearing in his church so we could talk to him if he blew in the face we have to see jesus appear among us then we can talk about christ coming he has to appear so why all these years ministry of the word books and tapes and rules and and whatnot but now it has to turn into the spirit

brought the virgin but produce jesus christ three denominational ages carriers which must die and dry up just like the shock and so forth have to give room for the seed the seed cannot get ripe until the shock stalk leaves all dry it saps the very life of it out of them so that is why after a while the anointing began to drop everywhere because the bride started absorb the anointing because the bride becomes the word the seed that is why you're so well connected scripture connected bible connected because the pentecostals ah they couldn't come to perfection with the gifts they rejected the prophet who brought the word so the pentecostal couldn't go on to maturity so god leave them there with their gifts and they have big churches millionaire empires i'm going to leave them there with that so god decided to call it a bunch of people a bunch of people that couldn't be bribed he called it bite material that he wanted to cut out from glory to god hallelujah so god come like god wrote about the cloth i said this is the material i'm going to use i can't use neutrons i can use wesleyans archaic pentecostals and bring out a word message to roll out this ball to court and out of a group of the two seed of the world out of this court i'm going to cut out the bride a pyramid bride a virtuous bride a seven thunder bride an elected bride a predestinated bride i'm gonna roll this message court hallelujah let them hear the shout but i'm going to bring another call a call to perfection oh glory to god and the bride could answer that call oh get the lord our praise off for it

the secrets of god is known to the prophets he spoke the word and when he spoke the word it became material for it was the spoken word of god and in its season happened just like that now when he spoke the word the word was a seed and it matured in its season so when god spoke for us that was had a season you have a season for the bite to come forth that you can't force that right now it's mango season right everywhere mangoes right now mangoes falling like rain mangoes everywhere everybody's selling mangoes why it's mango season two months ago you get leaves falling no mangoes but when

hallelujah your reader god my god we have come here for our funeral service we're coming to prepare for the wedding supper the world prepared for our funeral service the world going downhill we prepare for our wedding supper glory to god you might be seated whether or not john preached here he said when they grew up in the astronaut they have to rehearse down here never go in a tube with the witnesses and float on walker then i get trained to that because up they don't have uh gravity and so on so whenever when you have your milk or a bottle of juice it flying away from you floating in the air so if you never test that and experience that when you go up in space and you see your food flying say lord have mercy i will starve but they train them on earth in that weightless environment so when the food fallen around you have to know how to put your hand how to drink or when the water fell through in slow motion you have to know all of that when you get that skill then you're ready to go up so therefore your muscles are still down here before you go up you must cast off some devils you must heal some sick they must raise some death you must ah come on now come on now you must handle a beer you must deal with a lion then you can say good luck i'm coming for your head my mom after a while we said it before some time ago when when they have all the different men trying to be present in america don't bother with them when they come back to the field decide to get protection now fbi protection cia whatever they have the security protection then they get to protect the people don't don't control the channel the government controls that they protect that candidate because that may be the future president of america what about you your god's chosen candidate god already elected you nobody can vote for you come on this is before the foundation you should be shouting this before before the foundation of the world god already elect you so he's sending them in angelic escorts oh hallelujah the footsteps of the righteous are ordered ordered ordered ordered the footsteps of the righteous i ordered by the lord [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah he will not let you fall the lord will keep thee oh he that keeper there will not struggle asleep [Applause] oh give the lord some praises people [Applause] okay let's go the further now whoa now watch unfeeling of god after the stalk has been formed after the test has been formed after the grain has come unto the cub then it has to come to perfection so you kind of took perfection until you see green perfection can be preached to stalk perfection can be piece of the hub it has to be the green once you come back to green you're going to be perfect oh hallelujah oh glory to god brother branham and villain of god now when did he reveal himself in a different form stalk tassel all leaves he revealed himself same spirit different form but the last of that corn it comes back to the original grain it has to come back to the original laodicean notice this false vine come into full fruition in his age her fruit would mature and ripen that is correct this evil spirited church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree wherein large the falls of the air at her head will be antichrist the mystery of iniquity all this is true and if this is true then it must also be true that the bright church will mature and her rightness shall be an identification with her lord by means of the word and her head who is a mystery of godliness which is christ hallelujah this false church with all cunning and diabolical power made up of political force physical force and demons of darkness that's a trinity that combines that false church political physical and demonic the true vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts and power that jesus did in england i preach about one body one spirit and one head there's only one body that jesus head of that's the body called the church that's not a physical body that's an international bright body and by one spirit you're baptized into that one body and when you get into that body nobody could pull you out so the key is to go into the body once you're in the body they could send you in australia new zealand they can send you to england china they can send you anywhere you'll still be a christian you'll be a christian in any church in any group in any country you will still be a christian listen we survive in a long time our testimony and history and believers just survived a long time ibrahim survived his people his family jacob survived jews have survived oh come on the history is already there they're looking where they put us in egypt we're going to survive in babylon we're going to survive oh they can't hold the light the light just continues on as they try to cut us out we pass the torch to somebody else hallelujah paul passes irenaeus and martin and columbus and wesley all them keep passing one to another hallelujah and where's the passage of william round the pentecostal pentagon passes to paul and branham and but i'm passing to the bride i know we are running we are running running where done to the resurrection did you hear what i'm saying [Applause] why why why running because i take perfection to bring resurrection no perfection no resurrection there got to be a people that go to that perfection oh glory to god in order to bring the resurrection oh that people is here tonight i believe that's you you're a part of that hallelujah so here it is the true vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts and power that jesus did then as she nears her headstone becoming like him through the word jesus will come that the bride and groom may be united together as one yet it is harvest time then they must come forward as seen in this age those who will bring the wheat and tears to maturity the tears already maturing very fast under corrupt teachers who turned people from the word but the wheat must also mature and to her god is telling the prophet messenger with the vindicated ministry that he might be accepted by the elect they the elect will hear him as the first church with paul and she will mature in the word here we go until becoming a world bride the mighty works will be found in her that are always attendant upon pure word and fate you're written epistles right of all men translate that turn it around you are epistles that have been written you can't add nothing to it that's rid of all men manifested word of god in other words peter and john jesus was manifesting himself through them christ veiled in their flesh manifested made alive like he was in moses oh hallelujah so the seed is the word and the god and the on every age have it seen on his time and the people that of that age that manifest that promised word is the seed of that age according to what jesus said they are the children of the kingdom the manifestation of the holy spirit operating through his children is though seed of the kingdom at that age notice he never talked about doctrine deduction the chairman teaching is the manifestation you see the mystery the preaching no he didn't say that hallelujah the manifestation of the holy spirit operating to his children is the seed he said no we become tabernacles of that holy spirit which is christ that's the real seed then if the real holy spirit here we go gets into the real seed it won't take part of it because the devil uses that you've got to take all of it oh oh wait a minute brother over you'll be the devil take part in the message of course cartago the word becomes the life in our own flesh and that shows the presence of god so as the word becomes flesh you get more presence present did you hear that as the word becomes flesh you get into more presence the word coming into your flesh then you are walking with the presence of god and you have to become aware the presence is with you then you become aware i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you in trying circumstance you have to know god is dear you have to strain your head and scratch your head and pull okay here and bite your nails god is dear so when i manage my faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he's incited from the entire world become a new creature in christ then now you are getting into bright material you're getting into rapture and condition that means for each one of us not just the pastor the deacon or the trustees it means a laity every individual walks in a world with god alone [Music] every individual what walks with god alone if your family not walking with god you're walking with god if you're a good friend that walk with god you're walking with god if you're brother mother husband white children whatever not working with god but you walking with god you're responsible to walk with god not friend first god first [Applause] hallelujah no you're coming to perfect faith perfect for people perfection that kind of feel that faith never feels he was a mistake mystic to the world oh my oh can we take a little more just a little more i'll be going good you enjoying the lord this morning how many how many times got there christian now remember there won't be any denomination watch okay the shark's pulling away no cooperation nothing with it always pulls away there can be no more it's weak now and we are plenty green for the branagh listen to the description we are plenty green we have to lay in the presence of the sun to be mellowed up aha so he's talking about coming into presence and staying there to get mellow plenty green we haven't got and he called him pen degree now he's interpreting it we haven't got the sincerity the sacredness the thing we ought to have in our midst so coming out of greenness is the coming into sincerity coming into sacredness coming into respects like i always wanted the church that i serve to be one noted by brotherly love and respect because i know people are going to be judged by blasphemy and what the spirit of god began to do and i was always scared and concerned by people seeing the wrong thing that's why i'm saying say something nice see something good say something loyal say something truthful don't just lose your tongue and say anything you would pay for that but say the right thing and train yourself to speak the right thing because one of these days you might just end up saying the wrong thing at the wrong time and god will judge you right there on the spot for that you don't want that amen be humble be gracious be grateful holla don't be arrogant and puffed up god looking for somebody the more he blessed the more humble becomes he said usually when people get blessed they get puffed up they get arrogant two little blessing and they like like they're drunken and blessed a full air of corn a full wheat balls empty head stick up stick up stick up sticker this is how i always know it you know always used to do it but i'm telling you not that way but pastor you know the lord show me i am telling you the lord and show you nothing is all puffed up in your mind it's a religious spirit upon your life that you need to repent of because if i am the pastor telling you you're supposed to listen to the pastor because he is god's mouthpiece servant speaking the word to you now if the pastor is a cuckoo man that's different but if the past is on the word that's something else [Applause] you can hardly find a man on the world that preaching pure word the preaching themselves the ministry the position of cutting life amen [Music] after preaching about suffering trouble trouble trouble to get in real trouble call them bishops and poops they have down there they don't want that they want to take over they feel their natural thing no no why why i want to rule somewhere church what why are you trying to rule some other country that is crazy shouldn't have enough trouble all by itself right inside your way amen at the end of the day i have to answer for you i have to answer for what i have done that's what i say i accept responsibility it's not you fail i have failed because i suppose it presents leadership by the holy ghost that will inspire you to press on that's what's supposed to be here i can come to this monitor could it be whatever it is [Laughter] but what if it's not could it be this could it be that could it be this and your head goes so could it be could it be could it be could it be and we don't even know what what what's going to be so i'm not here to preach could it be i'm here to tell you god save the lord just say the lord is the word i told his brothers in africa i don't study saturn and mars and moon and and i don't even bother with that no explain star falling this happening and whatnot i am not an astrologer i'm not looking up there at all i have seven stars to deal with in the right hand of almighty god i bring the word first to the rapture for me to wonder if mars i assign this line up this line up so could it be so could it be so i don't know my faith can handle that i want to know dossier the lord that i'm gonna have a revival i want to know just say the lord they know they're near breaking bands and wickedness and people leaving here transform those lepers they say lord have mercy upon us they are lepers you don't hook them up and say oh pressure slipper you stay far from those folks that is high contagious disease jesus and all and touch them he said go and show yourself to the priest these guys just walking they're just walking going going down to the priests obedience that's these are all just a little word just just a little word to obey and they're walking down all of a sudden they recognize they're healed they didn't read they reached the priests the obedience brought healing let me say it again obedience brought healing obedience will bring healing to your life your home your marriage your situation obedience is going to bring it warn him come back and worship jesus he said where he rest he knew all you amen where'd he rest he said your faith has made you whole so you see what happened the rest gets blessing of healing by obedience this one confirmed something more than what they had because this won't come back to worship music has come up please i believe the church is beginning to hear the message begin to understand it but friend we've got to lay in the presence of the sun we've got to be ripened our fate isn't right intellectually we're hearing the message that god gave us seeing the signs proven it by the bible hallelujah listen to this prophecy no there's some god being misunderstood this is the bible i'm speaking and he's speaking it i want to speak into your spirit into your heart into your mind now as your father in the gospel and as your pastor i would like a little later on when your spirits and gifts begin to come to perfection did you hear that he's prophesying it will come to perfection if you go to watching them flying loose and getting just watch that person let it go because it's not the spirit of god on them when they are sweet and meek and humble and ready and everything that's the spirit of god if somebody gets out of order and the pastor has to call it on and that spirit flies up it is not the spirit of god the spirit of god don't fly up the spirit of god always stands and comes to the word every time what is he saying the gifts order will come to perfection and any rebuke correction instruction the person will humble themselves to the world and they wouldn't keep their self and the way they think and what they feel and their feeling led which time we get deal with that people feeling led and there's no letter no lord you know there's a letter ahead imagine there is no more shock after the shack is gone it's seed god is ready are we ready if he isn't doing it now he's going to call a chase to perfection by his word jesus christ oh hallelujah if he is not doing it now he's gonna do it do what call a church to perfection by his word jesus christ so william branham message was designed to call a brighter perfection isn't that right the prophet word was to call us back to perfection oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah do you believe that oh praise the name of the lord oh hallelujah praise god praise god thank you jesus oh my i think i'll just push on here now this great last great step okay he's talking about three elements that constitute a birth adam had his bride taken from his body christ had the bright taking from the body when christ died there was three elements that came from his body water blood spirit justification true believing water sanification through the blood and then the bathroom holy spirit here we go now now this last great step must come into perfection that the holy spirit has to live in that church so perfectly so we're not talking about teaching and lecturing and no no we're talking about where it comes to the spot where the holy spirit begin to come down now i began to live in the church live in your life live in your house live in your home your husband could feel it from you your wife could feel it from you your children your vibrating of the spirit of god so perfectly to make the head and body united get a sea he is
