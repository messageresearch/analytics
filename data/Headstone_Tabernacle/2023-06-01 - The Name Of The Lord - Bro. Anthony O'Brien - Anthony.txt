we feel the presence of God tonight in the house of the Lord and we're so happy to be in his presence amen so good to have you here tonight so God richly bless you by the inclement weather praise God I think we are in for a blessing tonight amen from the Lord we appreciate the Lord tonight appreciate our our brother brother Steve moliveria man thank you so much sir for the songs tonight we certainly appreciate the musicians amen so God bless you amen so let's just turn to our Bibles now we like to change your order to service amen and we have just two portion of scriptures we like to read first from proverbs chapter 18. and just one verse in there for context for a title and Saint Luke chapter 10 for context for subject tonight amen so Proverbs chapter 18 verse 10. it says the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous runeth into it and is safe amen until over now to Saint Luke chapter 10. amen just if you could raise a monitor brother uh man that'd be great amen thank you Saint Luke chapter 10 reading from verse 17. and it says and the 70 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven behold I give you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven and in that hour Jesus rejoiced in the spirit and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight may God have blessing to the reading of his word let us bow our hands almighty God we thank you for your word tonight Lord your word that has lasted from generation unto generation father and here we stand tonight on this same word Lord Lord you are never changing so father we thank you Lord that Lord we can rest our hearts and our faith upon you tonight Lord we pray now that you take the same word Lord that has kept the prophets of older kept every saint of God throughout all the ages father in your word tonight also as we hide behind it Lord and as we look to see what you will speak to us tonight Lord we just bow ourselves before your throne of grace Lord we pray that you open your word to us and bless us Lord pour your spirit down upon us and breathe life in the word father and Lord may it satisfy our needs oh God may you answer every question in our heart Lord may you bless our lives with more of you tonight as we wait upon you take charge in this service tonight we pray that you have your waived us for a few moments in Jesus name we pray and ask it amen and amen please the Lord amen you have your seats tonight praise God amen well Sydney feels good in here tonight and praise God certainly appreciate the Lord amen so just for us uh title tonight amen from our scripture reading I choose for a title the name of the Lord and for a subject I chose your name is written in heaven amen and so um I was just thinking on these things and um you know I was asking the Lord what to come tonight to say and I was thinking about a long time and I had a lot of Inspirations written down but it just didn't get a witness back from it and I just kept praying like that and all of a sudden God like he just spoke to me and told me but I give it to you already so um so it was almost like a why cry speak moment and I went back to something I wrote down and then the last convenience service and we had plenty tape on brother Branham um and I and the spirit just dropped on me like that and began to give me this word so I just wrote run down real quick down by the bathroom and I wrote it down the whole message and I actually didn't know I'd forgotten I'd done it so here was a few weeks later and God is bringing back to my remembrance all these things amen praise God so uh it it's not me praise God Amen I I is what he just gave me in in the in the moment and so he reminded me of these things and when I went back through it I just felt that it was right so amen so that's what I have tonight amen the name of the law are you happy tonight so we know that everything in this world has a name it's not right you have a name I have a name most of us are born into we were born into our family we are all given a name a family name and then you have a a given name isn't that right but the most important name is the name you make for yourself like to say Amen it's not right because behind every name there's a spirit behind every name there's a personality that's why naming children is such an important thing because there's a spirit behind that and that when you speak that name you're actually pronouncing a blessing over that child or over that person give your children Bible names pronounce a blessing over them amen that that comes from the Lord there's a testimony behind the names amen it's not old-fashioned it's the truth amen and um we ought to be careful what we name things it's not right naming is very important and so there's a spirit and a life behind a name a name takes a form of an identity if you name something isn't that right so if we call someone by name if we call you by name by your name your full name and you know sometimes mothers like to call their children by their full name you know that that's a lot of trouble amen full name middle name included you know they usually they're addressing a specific somebody isn't that right so because Mama doesn't want to miss she calls you by your full name so you know exactly who she's calling isn't that right and when someone calls your name you can't help but respond to it because that is your name you know that they're not speaking to the person next to you you're not speaking to the person in front or somebody behind you know that it is you that they are speaking to if they call someone else's name then that's someone else's response but when they call yawning you are responsible for responding to your name because that name belongs to you isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah and the book that God has in heaven is a book of names isn't that right it's a book of names and that book has many names the names of all of the men and women that would walk the earth God knows them all by their names and he knows your name tonight it's not by accident it is not by chance that you are living the life that you are living tonight it is because you have a name and God knows your name tonight he knows who you are and he knows where you are tonight he knows how you feel he knows the individual experiences that you are having right now in this instance of time that you are living in God knows the end from the beginning and he knows what name that you are going to pick up when you drop down here on Earth oh Hallelujah not right that's why when he come down he could call Abraham he could call Abram by name and he said come out from among your people and be separate say it gone walk unto me walk before me and be therefore perfect oh that's why he could come down and speak to Jacob and speak to Isaac and speak to Ephraim and speak to this one isn't that right he knows them all by their names and you have a name tonight oh Hallelujah do you believe it your name is not leaving your name is not John Jones but the mystery of what this book is while it is calling those names oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so a name is a very important thing it identifies someone isn't that right and every soul is precious to God isn't that rhyme a name represents a life a person spirit is so appreciated brother Gideon's Ovid service on The Last Cry amen was a real inspiration and on that message he was talking about Samson and he said that how Samson had a name that was feared when the name Samson was proclaimed there was a certain reputation that went behind that name the enemy know what to expect when they hear the name Samson is coming through all you had to do was mutter the word Samson and that had a certain feeling behind that it had a certain energy behind that oh hello isn't that right when you name the name Abraham oh the father of Faith oh hallah isn't that right who stood for God who built an altar who was the sacrifice his son but the Lord provided for him a sacrifice oh Hallelujah and he called that place Jehovah oh hallelujah hallelujah when the name Abraham was spoken you know who he was talking about when you say in the name Jacob when you name the name Joseph when you name the name Isaac you know who you was talking about but tonight we want to talk about the name that is above every other name when God came down and he spoke to his people he said I am the god of your fathers Abraham I am the god of Isaac and I am the god of Jacob in other words the same God that walked with Abraham and call them out of his people out of his nation and separated him is the same quarter was upon Isaac oh Allah who got for him a wife who is the same God I was upon Jacob oh wrestle all night long and overcame and when he overcame God gave him a new name oh he renounced the old name and he gave him a name called Israel oh because he overcome with god oh and he was a prince with God and when God dropped down he said I am the god of Abraham I am the god of Isaac I am the god of Jacob I am the god of Joseph I am the god I was with Moses when I parted the Red Sea I was the god I was with Moses when I spoke flies into existence when he spoke frogs into existence that same God is here tonight that same God made his witness with men and women on the earth who walked like you did who talk like you did who had failures like who did who had shortcomings like you did but that chord was made Mighty in their weakness he was made strong and if God could do that for them tonight then God could do the same for you I believe in all my heart oh hallelujah hallelujah somebody speak back to me tonight Oh Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah so there is a name that is above every other name and that name is fulfilled every expectation of that of that name isn't that right that name Jesus is able to fulfill every expectation of that name in other words because Jesus Is A Healer when we speak the name Jesus there is healing because he is a Healer and that is what his name means oh Hallelujah because he is able to do it because he is able to accomplish it because he has done it before he can do it again I know he can do it again because his name is the same oh Hallelujah and there's power behind that name there's a certain expectation behind that name when we speak the name Jesus demons start to get edgy they're starting at Unseen they start to get troubled they say you come to torment us before time because they're scared of that name Jesus oh oh one of these Glorious Days God is going to put his name into a pride and she's gonna have to say the Lord she's gonna speak and it'll flash like lightning oh Hallelujah because Jesus is a deliverer when we speak the name Jesus there's Deliverance amen because Jesus is the light when we speak the name Jesus Darkness has to flee because Jesus is a Shepherd when we speak the name Jesus I shall not want oh Hall is not right oh Hallelujah he leaded me beside the paths of righteousness for his name's sake oh Hallelujah he leaded me beside the Still Waters because his name o Hallelujah is a refresher his name always an oasis in the desert doesn't matter what you're going through his name represents something Supernatural all the men that walk this hurts couldn't do what Jesus did all the men that came around in their tail couldn't amount to what Jesus did for you and I oh and he made a name for himself oh a name in heaven and a name on the earth oh hallelujah hallelujah when you speak that name Darkness knows where to go because that name has a light with it when you speak that name sickness knows where to go because he is a mighty healer when you speak that name the devil knows where to go oh Hallelujah because he has the key of death of hell and the grave oh Hallelujah in his name There Is Power in that name isn't that right Hallelujah the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want Psalms 23. he maketh me to lie down and Green Pastures he leadeth me beside The Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness what for his namesake oh Hallelujah he does it for his namesake amen I believe it was her precious brother maduka who was preaching one time in one of the conventions we had and in the past and he was saying that if a company if a businessman has a name then what he has is his reputation to protect he has a reputation at stake therefore for the cause of his name he will do things because his name his reputation is at stake he doesn't want no one saying bad things about his name he doesn't want anyone tarnishing his reputation so therefore his product has to be perfect every single time and if someone has a complaint about the product he will be quick to reimburse he'll be quick to fix a problem why is he doing it for his name's sake and if God made a promise if natural man would try to protect his name then God has an obligation tonight to protect his name and when you were thought of on his mind he wrote your name down in the Book of Life oh Hallelujah he swore by himself that he would bring you out and for his name's sake he would move mountains for you he would take you out he would break the back of the enemy he would wrote righteousness or for his name's sake he would move mountains tonight because he loves you and because he has elected you because the king projected his love to you Sovereign Grace took over oh Hallelujah and he claimed you to himself for his name's sake whoa Hallelujah he said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and because he chose you he put his reputation on the line therefore God is obligated to meet you on the basis of every promise that he made because his name is at stake he's got to meet you on the basis of the promised World he's obligated to meet you on it all you have to do is say Lord you made a promise and if you don't bring your promise a pass then you'd have told a lie but God is not a liar God is not a man that he will lie when God makes a promise he keeps his promise and if God promised a heal you tonight he's going to heal you if God promised to deliver you he's going to deliver you there are not enough temples in this universe to stop God from delivering you if he promised her to do it he's going to make a way somebody say Amen somebody say Amen oh hallelujah oh glorial God amen yay do I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil why for his name's sake thou art with me thyroid and thy stuff they comfort me thou prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies doesn't matter who hates you doesn't matter who lie on you doesn't matter who treat you bad they cannot devalue what God has valued when you value something you put trust in it God is entrusting a bride tonight oh Hallelujah all that is all that is it takes to overcome in this last stage oh for his name's sake he's gonna shape you and form you and make you a testimony a walking living pyramid on this Earth and prove to the devil that you are not like Eve oh honey you will not be deceived oh honey you're gonna become that word and speak that word and live that word and Shake every tevel on the field hey that's what you were raised up for oh can somebody praise him tonight Hallelujah presence of mine enemies our anoint is my head my my cup runeth over it's not just full it'll run over the god that we serve is a cup running over God oh hallelujah hallelujah when he blessed He blesses you don't have a cup big enough for this blessing pray there's no cup you can make that's big enough for what God's getting ready to pour out upon you I has not seen air has not heard nor has it entered the heart of man what's fixing to take place oh brother oh sister there's coming a time when the sick cannot stay sick when the blind cannot say blind when the cannot say because Jesus that name that is above every other name is gonna step into 16 elements and he's gonna walk again he's gonna talk again oh Hallelujah I believe it do you believe it tonight Philippians 2 verse 5. Apostle Paul says let me let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation this man Jesus this is what he lived this these words here is what he vibrated oh Hallelujah this is what made the devil so sick oh Hallelujah because king after King and potentate of the potentate and ruler after ruler but never was there a man that walk like this man Jesus never was there man that lived like this man Jesus isn't that right and if we name our name there's a spirit behind our name my brother Branham said of the spirit of Ludwig van Beethoven amen it was in me I would do what he did I would write songs I would write it is not right for I'd be inspired if that Spirit living me if I had a spirit of Don Dillinger I'd be an outlaw he said isn't that right but if I had the spirits of the same Jesus inside of me then the same works that he did you shall do also if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you you it will Quicken your mortal body you you can't be the same anymore all of a sudden the devil that had you bound that you are running from they will be running from you because of the Jesus that is in your soul or somebody say Amen oh oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah because when Jesus is around the dead cannot stay dead when Jesus is around there's always a noise about him abroad oh they went out of Fame about him around the region round about that Jesus was passing this way and anytime Jesus is passing this way there's an expectation if you are sick all of a sudden in the midst of a dead life in the midst of a life filled with sickness all of a sudden light Springs up and you get hope because the man that could heal sickness the man that could heal diseases is walking through the aisles tonight oh I wonder if that same Jesus From Galilee tonight was to walk through these Isles what would be your expectation what do you have me to do for you oh oh what would be your answer tonight oh Hallelujah my it's an expectation isn't that right so he said he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant he was the high and lofty one who created all things yet he took the form servant said let the greatest among you let him be your servant that's really the key friends it's not about what you can get it's about what you can give it's not oh my God wants true Silvers in this end time I generally believe that if God's Gonna raise up a faithful Ministry by his spirit and they have to be servants because Jesus said a servant is no greater than his Lord therefore if I wash your feet then so much you do likewise to your own brothers and if I forgive you then so much you also forgive them that trespass against you them that speak evil against you be kind that isn't that right amen no we give evil for evil oh but do good oh father isn't that right if your brother asks you'll go on my I'll go to with him live the life that Christ live isn't that right Hallelujah that's what we're called to do we're called to be servants oh Hallelujah to serve God's people amen amen there's a reward praise God for God servants isn't that right it was made in the likeness of man still reading the scripture here and being found in a passion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also had highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name oh that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in Earth and everything under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father oh Hallelujah that's the name that I am praising tonight that's a name that we cry out when we're in trouble don't be afraid to cry out the name Jesus to call Upon Jesus oh he is able to answer your cry he can hear your prayer tonight anything that you have need of he is able to provide Jesus can provide it Jesus can help me Jesus alone God likes to bring situations in your life where you know that you cannot make it on your own you know that you can't fix this because the more you try to fix it is the worse it gets when you're gonna turn over when are you gonna give up when are you gonna give yourself over to Jesus let him fix the broken things in your life in your marriage in your walk in your talk how long are you gonna make circles in the deserts oh come on tonight there is a fountain filled with blood tonight drawn from Emmanuel's veins where Sinners plunge beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains Jesus is here to help you tonight in ways that I can't do your mother couldn't do it your father can't do it but I know Jesus he can do it tonight whatever you have need of don't just listen to me tonight but call Upon Jesus he is waiting to hear your cry oh Hallelujah yeah Oh Glory one time we had come from a Victory Heights Camp I think and it was a really Victorious One I came back home and I was wary but I was happy we had a great time in the lawn and I remember falling asleep and I felt like a dream because the room got dark and evil and the presence came inside and it felt I could want to wrestle me while I was on the bed and I was fighting up with it and all of a sudden something spoke in my ear and said why don't you call on Jesus and as I said Jesus help me the power that was holding me down smashing down billion pieces scattered across the room and then I woke up moments after and I felt a peace come in the room praise God it's not the name of Jesus there's power in that name to do stuff that you can't do when it's too much for you it's not too much for Jesus when you can make it on your own Jesus can help you Jesus alone oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah this is not just something I'm talking about it's something you have to experience for yourself that when you cry out the name Jesus he comes to your rescue oh he always hears a desperate cry call upon the name of the Lord tonight and so shall you be saved amen amen from your distress it's not right it's nine praise God Hallelujah so Isaiah talked about this Jesus that was to come it's not right Prince of Peace Mighty God counselor Everlasting father isn't that right but one day a little Virgin Mary was doing about her Duty going about her daily routine when all of a sudden her life was interrupted by the visitation of an Angel it is because she was special she didn't look special to everyone in her community she might not have looked special to everyone in her family she might not look special to any of the other young girls who was just about her age but God has a special prophecy over her life God had a special thing that he wanted to do for Mary that at the time appointed when her word would come to her God already prepared hearts to receive that word god already prepared womb to receive his son Jesus and when the angel come down on the earth he said fear not Mary you are blessed you are highly favored oh honey you are gonna conceive and bring forth a son oh his name Shall be Called counselor his name Shall be Called Prince of Peace Everlasting father name is Jesus Oh Hallelujah the first time that name was uttered oh it's from the mouth of an Angel declaring it to be so isn't that right praise God Amen Hallelujah amen and she was excited she only had one question how shall these things be how shall it be that this will happen I I I believe but I just want to know and the angels said the Holy Ghost oh the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you and conceive this man-child oh Hallelujah and when she heard the words of an Angel when you hear the words of an Angel you better get to running brother she ran she left what she was doing she ran to her I am at Elizabeth hallelujah praise God and he said we won't believe what happened you won't believe what I heard you won't believe what I've seen and when she spoke the name Jesus Sean in the womb began to jump and Shout oh something Supernatural begin to happen just as that name begin to alter oh begin to spread around something about the name Jesus it is a sweet ass name I know oh how I love that name that name brought me through hard times that name brought me through dark times when I didn't have money in my pocket when I didn't have a wishbone when I didn't have nothing to hold on to Jesus was my anchor Jesus was my typos Jesus is my absolute Jesus is the reason I'm standing here tonight preaching to you tonight and I never made it if it wasn't for Jesus I owe him my life I owe him My Worship I owe him my praise I owe him my shout I owe him all that I have all that I ever will peel is in Jesus tonight or somebody help me Praise Him Hallelujah oh Hallelujah my son is alive tonight because of Jesus my daughter's alive tonight because of Jesus my wife is in her right mind because of Jesus he brought us through the my reclaire he put my foot on a rock to stare as for me and my house we will serve God oh Hallelujah foreign that's the conviction oh Hallelujah Hallelujah if I stand before God I'll say the same thing wanna praise His name for all he's done for me he means so much to me [Music] can I preach a little bit amen oh my in the beginning when God created The World God spoke he said let there be light isn't that right and then the next thing he did was he separated a light from the darkness and then the next thing he did was the name Delight because God is into this naming thing he's been doing it a long time when he created a world he began to name things because that is how God shows his authority over something when he gives it a name and when Adam had Authority on the earth he had the ability to name the things around him and whatever name he gave it was the name thereof The Authority was signed on on on on unretractable isn't it undoable it was all irrevocable isn't that right it was already spoken so shall it be it's not I was the authority I was being expressed in Adam from God it's not right oh my God's gonna have a people like that one more time oh Hallelujah they're gonna be walking into hospital rooms and stuff that the doctors can't figure out these Supernatural intelligence will drop down and say thou foul Spirits you've been here these past 15 years I cast you out don't know about you'll be naming them you'll be calling them I said get out get up and move the authority is on the earth now I charge you Hallelujah isn't that right the authority will be in the pride to speak and you create itself just like that and so the prophet said isn't that right that same Authority it's going to come upon a bride amen amen oh my see so he named the light call it like d ude and he called The Darkness night give it a name so from since that time we know that it takes light to declare the day it's not right it takes light and what is the light the prophet said the light is actually the Vindicated word of God to declare the day that we are actually living in isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah uh Jesus said on that day you shall know Saint John 14 18. he said I will not leave you comfortless but I will come to you and yet a little while and the world see at me no more but you are going to see me and because I live you shall live also and at that day you shall know that I am in my father ye and me and I knew what day that's this day and what declares are they the light and the light is a Vindicated word or declaring the day that you are living in isn't that right oh Hallelujah II Peter 1 he said uh verse 19 he said we also have a more sure word of Prophecy where unto ye do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the Daystar arise in your hearts who is that day sir jsus the son of the Living God arising in your hearts arise and in power arise in an anointing oh keep on believing believing unto the Holy Ghost when until that day Dawn and until the day star arise in your hearts oh isn't that right the Bible says arise and shine for thy light has come because gross Darkness cover the Earth cross Darkness cover the stools cross Darkness cover everywhere cover politics cover the Genesis comma children with all kind of satanic sodomite Spirits running loose upon the Earth but God promised to lift up your heads that there shall be light oh Hallelujah arise and shine for thy light has come oh that though there be darkness in the world will there be darkness in the politics though there be darkness in the governments do there be Darkness on the streets and everywhere god promise that you are gonna have light he said the Gentiles shall come to thy light oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you're gonna come to your light in other words you're gonna come to understanding of who you are of who God is of who the devil is you're going to under stand that your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life you're gonna understand that it's not about the works lest any man should post but it's about the power it's about the predestination or that he's put inside of your soul that's the only reason you made it out the devil is a liar tonight he told you you couldn't make it he told you you were just like everybody else but he doesn't know who you are it takes God to reveal in his word who you really are it takes Court to Center profit to speak to you to let you know just say the Lord that he's coming back for you he's coming to heal you say Amen he's coming to deliver you say Amen he's coming to fill you with the Holy Ghost he's coming to heal your body he's coming to heal your mind he's going to heal your hurts heal your pains and transform you into what you're meant to be oh Hallelujah knowing this that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not an old time by the will of man but holy man of God speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost the light for our day has a name it's not right the Vindicated word of God in Noah's day was the life of his day when he said it will rain that was the word for his day which represented a light for his day that way he was walking in our Vindicated light for that day oh Hallelujah to walk not in that light to walk not in that word for that age we were walking in darkness isn't that Raj and he preached that word for about 120 years and only eight Souls were saved who went into the ark they received the light for their day and all the rest perish and darkness oh because I received not the light isn't that right to disbelieve it was to walk in darkness isn't that right the word of God and Moses day was the light for his day let the uh Let My People Go isn't that right that was the light for his day to not be in Goshen to not walk in that lunch is to walk in darkness is to be under plagues is to be on the famine and pestilence but once you were walking and with the lights you were under the protection you were Under The Canopy of life that God had ordained for that tale to walk with Moses God told Moses get those people out of Egypt and bring them to this mountain and let them worship me here therefore God gave Moses a one-way ticket to come all the way back to the mountain give him a return ticket he said don't let no devil don't let no demon don't let no egyptian get in your way holy whatever you have to do Break Down The Walls but I'm taking my people out oh come on now you don't hear me tonight when God sent out his decree I don't care how many Devils they are in your life I don't care many devils are in your home I know many devils in your marriage I don't care many devils in your car God that cannot stop the mouth of God when God has spoken it he will perform what he has promised or somebody say Amen he's gonna heal you he's going to deliver you he's going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost he is going to deliver your family my Lord deliver Daniel and my Lord delivered me oh somebody give him a shout of praise hallelujah hallelujah glory of God glory to God Amen [Music] let there be light amen Vindicated word of order so what is the Vindicated word for Audi Malachi for profits isn't that right is that the word he spoke is a light forward let there be a bride oh it's not right that bride will have not say the Lord will keep still who is he talking about he's talking about you no he's talking about you who has come come to manifestation of what he spoke isn't that right before Mary come on the scene all we knew about Mary was that she was supposed to be a virgin that was going to conceive and bring forth the sun that's all we knew it was just a prophecy of the words of the book so Canal are only Earth for hundreds of years was just the singular prophecy that was meant to meet a singular woman at a singular time at a singular event and a singular instance oh Hallelujah and God knew that time and the season that he was supposed to appear to marry Mary herself didn't even know who she was she was just walking around learning how to knit learning how to sew learning how to draw from the water pots learning how to go out into the Harvest fields and help the man when the wheat come in she was just doing her daily thing until all of a sudden here come the word of Prophecy concerning Mary's life and you might be walking around Norma you think you're normal the devil think you're normal you think you're nothing you think you're waste of time you think you're ordinary until all of a sudden the word of Prophecy concerning your all comes over you and you are overshadowed by something Supernatural that is not by chance you always were Supernatural because you are predestinated to be conformed to the image of God you are only having up to that time and natural experience but you are a supernatural being from somewhere else and that you were meant for something else not this humdrum dreary life that you are accustomed to not this three-dimensional world that you're accustomed to but you come from God and you're going back to God tonight God dropped on in time the god of Eternity dropped on in time what do you come for the names on the book there's your name is written here oh you might not have heard it yet but you're gonna hear it in your time in your season he's gonna call your name and he's gonna answer my file oh and there's not enough Devils could hold you not enough demons could hold you I don't care how long you've been in slavery God is here to crack those chains off of your soul off of your hands off of your feet so that you can shout and give God praise Hallelujah you were created for his glory you are not created to be upon slave to the devil somebody lift your hands and praise Him somebody lift your hands if you know what I'm talking about oh hallelujah oh I could have been anything I didn't have to be a preacher I could have been a weed smoker I could have been a cocaine addict I could have been a young man going out there oh whining and carrying on but something Supernatural happened to my heart he arrested me I can't explain it it's not rational it doesn't make sense but he spoke to me and I could never be the same again oh I heard from my father and he spoke to my soul and he answered the questioners in my heart how can I walk away how can I walk away from him to talk to me told me I was his own now my name I know my name is written there oh Hallelujah one of these Glorious Days I'm gonna be filled with that Holy Ghost Fire baptism of fire hey many many you my Christian friend may you receive it my Christian brother that Holy Ghost a promise keep pressing on to that promise we didn't come all this way all these years to warmer Church bench or to occupy his face or to take up space plenty of people going to church but what you want to be is in the bride by one spirit is how you get into that bride by one spirit is how he stamps his name into your soul makes you a creature of Eternity no more creature of time you're in the world but you're not of the world you're building your hopes on things Eternal and your whole to God's unchanging hand oh how do you come from Glory you go back to Glory [Music] let me hurry up here amen glory wow all right seven times couple per minute man prophecy boom was never capped but it's going to be capped these seven Sundays amen so it's gonna cop it is not right in you praise God God's Gonna manifest himself all these seven Mysteries I was laying off as mystery shortages God's getting ready to reveal it in you many men show off to the world finally who he was just like how in the Old Testament he was mysterious mystery mystery Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Nissi Jehovah mystery mystery girl he's the God of this he's a god of that many titles but when he step on the earth he was God and paid flesh he was in the image of a man yet he was all God he was completely God completely man he cried when Lazarus died but when he appeared before the stone and he said roll away that stone there came a voice out of him oh that was not a voice of a man that was the voice of God he said Lazarus comfort and that voice call Lazarus from wherever he was and brought his soul back into his body and that same voice is on the earth tonight and that voice is what called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light oh how can I help but praise him I how can I help but worship him every day of my life to hear his voice speak to me in these last days oh hallelujah hallelujah Glory Prophet said here on turn on the light the son is the king of all the lights of the Earth in the natural lights he said no matter how much artificial light that we can have how much great electric Rays we can produce yeah it is Big spotlights they have when they're doing construction in the night always look at atena you're driving down the road and sometimes they have these construction things up the big China big life is a huge halogenberg I guess they call it and it's so bright sometimes you can feel a heat from it and he said wow it's almost like daytime you know but when the real light comes out when a real sun come up well that bulb is a joke they want nothing on the real light and that's what goes uh ghost Prophet is talking about here said that light not how many electric Rays we can produce when that sun rises all the rest of them came out oh holiday I said and that's the same thing it is with the word of God he said when the word of God arises all superstitions denominational fanaticisms and things they spread away and it just shows up exactly what it is [Music] shall proceed no further when the real light comes up oh brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God's Gonna raise up the real Pentecostal lights and when that light strikes the Earth One More Time all these denominational schisms and all these isms will fade away when God fails himself in a bride on earth oh brother there's coming a real Revival brother that's coming a real stirring the bride hasn't had a stir in the edge but he said it will take these seven unknown Thunders to wake her up again he will send it he promises oh and I believe it and that settles it tonight I could praise God on that one I could shout on that one I could dance on that one I've got a victory what is it faith is a victory that overcomes the world oh faith in God's word faith in what he said not the one a man thinks but just take it as as he says if he says he'll heal you he is of no private interpretation take it just the way he said it isn't that right Professor always said that and I heard a preacher say one time he said the word of God has to be enough for you it has to be enough enough for you to sustain you he said if it's not enough for you you will go look in for other deceptions you'll go looking for other gospels you will have itching ears looking for other knowledge looking for some new mystery or some new thing to excite you but when the word of God is enough for you you don't need the devil's lie you don't need the devil's tricks all you need is God's word that satisfies the long and hearts that satisfies the thirsting soul that's what I want tonight I hope that's what you want tonight but if I don't always talk about that day when the day is weak and wounded I'm being chased by the wolf when the day is low and running out of battery and he needs a recharge Barbara said there's some glands in the hoof of that of that day anytime they touch water something happens to them physically they get an energy they never had before they gotta recharge every time they drink water real water I'm not talking about Blue Waters water soft drink can't give you this kind of buzz Minute Maid not ready for this we're talking about God's water we're talking about Adam's ale we're talking about the real deal when that hit the deer something else takes place and brother nothing this world could produce can ever satisfy the long and hearts and The Thirst and soul the real believer who wants a real Revival she is looking for it brother he is looking for it brother he is looking for a real Revival in his soul something that satisfies the long and hearts something that answers the question that is in his soul something that revives something that heals something that delivers something that restores only God could do that only God could transform a disfigured life isn't that right prison try to transform people and the best they come up with is reform they try to reform people into society and make you fit to walk back out those prison doors again they have tried and they've failed because sometimes some people go into prison and come back out worse than when they went in prison could only do so much the systems can only do so much but only God has the power to transform he's in the transforming business whatever however disfigured you are God could take your life and change it over and make something better out of it he is the Potter tonight you are just declare don't try to be the Potter you can make yourself the Bible says it's not we that have made ourselves but it is he that had made us he is our Shepherd and we are the Sheep of his pasture and to enter his gates with Thanksgiving and come into his house with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name tonight for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endure to all generations blessed be the name of the Lord be believer tonight amen oh my all resting on demo that's the same thing of the word of God spreads away he said let it be light the light only comes with True Light and the King light comes by the word of God see and God separated the light from the darkness in the beginning and the word of God made manifest always separates the light from the darkness amen is that right he said people can rise up with this or that or isms rise up communism fascism he said all these are isms can rise superstitions Cults whatever it might be might rise but when that King light of the Bible Rises up all superstitions and things see goes away see but you see now you know it's there but until it's Vindicated proves it is light he said then we have no right to argue against that because it shuts all other lights out Jesus said amen God's word God's light shuts all other lights out he said let every man word be a lie and mine be true be true his word is superior over all man's words over all anything his word is so there's power in a name isn't all right we're talking about that right let me come in this thought here and just kind of drop down get ready to close out and wind down so when God met Abraham he changed to Abram changed his name to Abraham what happened somebody took place Abraham overcome with God isn't that right God gave him a name to reflect the promise that he had gave to him to make him a father of Nations he may pronounce a blessing over Abram's life no more would he be called Abram but now he was called Abraham the father of Nations bear that name until his son Comforts he had to bear that name isn't that right oh Hallelujah did the doctors laugh at him though he had mockers and scoffers he said God promised me a son and I'm gonna have it that's the say of the Lord and I'm hanging on to God's every word oh hallelujah praise God isn't that right hallelujah amen amen glory and I understand what I understand if Adam Adam's name in the Hebrew is actually Adam which means of the land which means every time God spoke the name Adam who reminded Adam of where he had drawn him from he said I call you up from the land to serve my purpose and to serve my cause and to serve amen is not right and to walk before me and to have dominion over to follow the air and to have dominion over the fish of the sea and over everything that is upon the earth oh hallelujah how far has man fallen from that understanding and that Consciousness that it is God that raise him up from the dust oh Hallelujah to thus return it was not spoken of the Soul you have a soul tonight with our Eternal destination and one day you will have to answer for the things you have done in this body make sure Hallelujah very sure you're calling an election today pray to make sure you know where your soul is traveling onto in the Hereafter isn't that right oh my praise God all right amen you change the company to Israel is not right praise God the overcoming God Jace Joseph when he come out of prison into Power his name was changed as a sign isn't that right praise God Amen to the god that speaks and the god that lives amen praise God in Egyptian isn't that right even when Jesus met Simon of bad Jonah he gave him a name called him cephas which means Little Rock and little did we know that later on in the Scripture it was only a sign of the Revelation that he was going to place in Peter's heart praise God only at all who do men say I the son of Madam many were wondering some say it is some say it out and then when Jesus tells us who do you say that I am they didn't know but the name that was pronounced upon upon cephas all of a sudden anointing come around him Jesus knew what was taking place and Revelation shook his heart as he towered the Christ son of the Living God and Jesus come around and said power Peter pray and Upon This Rock I'll build my church to identify that the rock that Jesus is building his church upon is the revelation of Jesus Christ praise God Amen Upon This Rock the Gates of Hell will come against it but they'll never prepare oh and that's a rock that we are standing and on tonight although the Gates of Hell come against it they could never Prevail because we by Revelation see Christ reveal in his own word oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God oh how we see all through the years what God has been doing he's been building a pyramid it was a mystery in Paul's age a mystery in Iran that's a mystery of Martin a mystery in Colombo we're going to come on down to the end it's been revealed to us what he was doing all the time oh he was building a perfect man praise God he's gonna cap it off with seven perfect Spirits oh hallelujah hallelujah and bring down the headstone amen upon the Bodywork isn't that right and then up into glory and that's the whole story amen do you believe it oh my getting ready to close out amen Revelation Jesus Christ you said you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that the book they were studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages he said then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together Prophet said you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real he said it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost oh Hallelujah so not an enticing words of man's Wisdom but is in a revelation that the Holy Ghost brings to the individual of who Jesus Christ is in his own word just like Jesus walked the streets and the Pharisees didn't know he was the Sadducees didn't know who he was but prostitutes recognize him the woman at the well recognized him why because he revealed himself to whomsoever he will oh honey Mr she could come amen and tonight he's bypassed the rich he bypassed the learner he does it again he should keep repeating itself God don't need Great and Mighty Man Lord hide himself in Badger skins and babes such as would learn he hide himself in you tonight oh Hallelujah because it pleased God to reveal his love to you it please call it put a smile on God's face to elect you to predestinate to you to write your name in his blood to call you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Lights to raise you up for such a time as this to pour into you his holy ghost fire it please call oh hallelujah how can I help but praise him tonight when I think about his love oh Hallelujah he said it takes the operation of the Holy Ghost he said that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people oh hallelujah hallelujah he said he'll take one with prophetic inside he said it will require the ability to hear from God oh what do you have tonight the ability to hear from God he said oh how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know it's not right and why am I gonna against organize religion Prophet said the Holy Ghost today the manifestation of Holy Ghost spirit is that angel trying to get you the people back to the world why because the Holy Spirit would only vindicate the word oh he said it can't vindicate dogmas there's no life in them he said is he is life and his life is a light of men and that's the light we're walking in today oh Jesus the light of the world and he declares a day that we're living in and until the day Dawn and the day star rise in your hearts walk in the lighter night the seventh and the seventh seal mystery of God or reveal in this last day is the light that we are walking in Christ in you the hope of glory the Life of Christ and the individual isn't that right oh do you believe it praise God Amen Hallelujah Exodus 23 says behold I sent an angel before thee to keep me in the way to bring it into the place I have prepared oh God has prepared a place for you tonight oh that's a place for you that's not for anybody else God has a place for you tonight and he's prepared that place for you to come into it and he said his Angel before you to bring you to that place there's no devil can stop you tonight brother there's no sister no it's no Satan no evil no no Spirit could separate you from the love of God he said Beware of him obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions why for my name is in him oh Hallelujah there's that name again it's not right oh my praise God only for his namesake praise God he will do it praise God okay brother when I'm sending a question answers on the seals praise God he says uh he says uh is it true that every Jew born since Christ came will be saved praise God who would have put 144 000 we know this quote right so he steps down he says well there's about two questions here but he said no he said nothing will be saved only those names were put on a Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Jew or Gentile see that's all he said the book holds that mystery the mystery of what the name is and reveals it in a time that it's supposed to be revealed oh man and here you comfort your name come you come out when your name is spoken through the mystery isn't that right oh my no wonder God sent a prophet to call your name from the book that's why we come here tonight it wasn't by chance because God ordained you in his mind from the beginning and said because you are coming on the earth I need to announce my bride coming by sending a prophet behold I send Elijah hallelujah praise God to prophesy amen the names in that book and here we are tonight he said uh that's all see the book holds a mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it is calling those names he said you finally understand it now amen is not your name literal name praise God but the word of God concerning you for this age oh Hallelujah so when he said there'll be a bride on the earth he to manifest the things that are written in this book for the time is at hand oh Hallelujah Hallelujah hey man you can begin to play something softly man oh the book doesn't say Lee Veil to be saved in the time of this church age or something or Orman Neville or whoever no don't say that it just shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of what the thing is and he said but we lay we ourselves by faith believe it and that's what I said the other night amen we connect with it oh one last quote not finish in the hidden Life of Christ Prophet said the Bible said that he that overcome it I'll give him a new name I'll put my spirit what name I'll put my spirit in him that's it right there I said watch there's an overcoming first you've got to overcome these things in order to be in Christ he said there's where the church is fear are failing in one place overcoming overcoming Temperance temper overcome difference overcoming Church Prejudice overcoming hatred many people tonight who shout and speak with tongues and run up and down the aisle and hate their neighbor that has brother brother you're lost yet he said that's hard to say he said but it's the truth he said that's right you've got to overcome you can only overcome when you say I'm eating the Manna glory to God yeah but look what happens from one day to another you get Miss meal cramps he said come on in inside where the Manna is fresh all the time he said whether your neighbor treats you right or not you love him anyhow that's right whether he agrees at you or not you love him anyhow that's the way you've got to do it he said that's that hidden life that's that consecrated life that's that life that veils of the world he said and you're shot off from the things of the world he said and you only live in Christ you see what I mean church I don't want to hurt your feelings he said but I've got to stand with your judgment someday he said I'm responsible for telling you the truth that's right God bless you tonight I'm finished praise God you go stand oh Father we thank you we praise you we glorify your Holy Name the name that is above every other name oh you promised to put that name in us oh by your spirit by your power oh Hallelujah [Music] amen coming on precious sweetener now listen sleep times just worship him oh
