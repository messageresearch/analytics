[1:13:11] read from James 5:1
[1:13:13] verse seven it reads be patient
[1:13:17] therefore brethren under the common of
[1:13:20] the Lord behold a husbandman waiteth for
[1:13:23] the precious fruit of the earth
[1:13:25] I had long patience for it until he
[1:13:28] received the early and the latter rain
[1:13:31] this bore his father we thank you for
[1:13:32] your word speak Lord and come and
[1:13:35] confirm the word with signs wonders and

[1:13:40] my asket amen and amen you may be seated
[1:13:43] praise be to Jesus praise God our title
[1:13:48] this morning the time of the latter rain
[1:13:51] that's my title this morning the time of
[1:13:54] the latter rain and an inspiration
[1:13:57] occifer rain oh praise God you got to
[1:14:00] have the acts for the rain yourself and
[1:14:03] that marina's calling for everyone grass
[1:14:05] in the field oh praise the name of the
[1:14:08] Lord blessed be the Lord so just all the
[1:14:11] time would last on the message about a
[1:14:13] word living word a word made flesh and
[1:14:15] this is the prophet from the comforter
[1:14:17] he says now watch what is our comfort
[1:14:20] today it's when we received the baptism
[1:14:23] of the Holy Ghost and the power of the
[1:14:26] Living God
[1:14:27] living in us and that's with the word of
[1:14:30] the Living God we stand and that word
[1:14:33] made flesh dwell among us now that same
[1:14:35] word that was made flesh and dwell among
[1:14:38] us has become our flesh he is with you
[1:14:42] now but he shall be in you know that
[1:14:45] same word that that prophet spoke that
[1:14:47] same word that was made flesh that same
[1:14:50] word dwells in the church
[1:14:53] and here the catch now therefore if we
[1:14:56] don't compromise that word and we stay
[1:14:59] right with it if we don't compromise it
[1:15:02] that same word living in you will
[1:15:07] produce the same thing that it did when
[1:15:10] he was made flesh because your flesh
[1:15:13] holds it so God made a way for your
[1:15:16] flesh to hold the world remember it has
[1:15:19] to come into your walk into your flesh
[1:15:21] and your feet isn't that right and
[1:15:23] that's the reason visions can break
[1:15:25] through the song barrier that's the
[1:15:27] reason vision can break through the
[1:15:28] sound barrier the seer the Lord because
[1:15:30] it's a word coming forth from a spirit
[1:15:32] amen
[1:15:34] so here we go now are you ready so this
[1:15:37] is a vision that the prophet had in the
[1:15:40] early years so we starting with official
[1:15:42] this morning this is a vision two years
[1:15:46] later I've been praying in a cave where
[1:15:48] I would go to pray got a dusty in a cave
[1:15:51] one afternoon I walked out lead my Bible
[1:15:54] on a log on the wind blew that opened
[1:15:56] the Hebrews a sick chapter which said
[1:15:59] that in the last days how it would be if
[1:16:02] we fell away from the truth and renew
[1:16:05] ourselves again unto repentance there
[1:16:08] was no more sacrifice for sin how that
[1:16:10] falls and T cells which were 9 to
[1:16:12] rejection whose energy be burned but the
[1:16:14] rain commits upon the earth to water it
[1:16:18] to dress it and Torn's anticipable
[1:16:20] rejected but the wheat would be gathered
[1:16:22] and I thought well it just had the wind
[1:16:25] blow that open well I'll lay the Bible
[1:16:27] down again and I thought well no and
[1:16:28] here come the wind and blew it open it
[1:16:31] happened three times seems please I said
[1:16:35] it strange and I raised up and thought
[1:16:38] Lord why would you open the Bible for me
[1:16:40] to read that when I get down to where
[1:16:44] Torn's and thistles which is nigh on the
[1:16:46] rejection whose nsab burnt
[1:16:48] I thought why would you open that to me
[1:16:51] there and as I look across the vision
[1:16:55] broke now these visions come without
[1:16:59] pull in any gear it's just God
[1:17:03] I looked now don't miss any words now
[1:17:06] just listen carefully I looked and seen
[1:17:10] an earth that was turning in front of me
[1:17:12] and it was all discs up
[1:17:15] I guess that is like when it have like
[1:17:18] to take a fork and fork it up like us
[1:17:20] till it up then this Cup
[1:17:22] there was a man dressed in white when
[1:17:25] the wrong showing wheat and after he
[1:17:27] went around the curvature of the earth
[1:17:29] Arrancar my man look horrible he was
[1:17:31] just in black he was trying weed seeds
[1:17:34] over it the board come up together when
[1:17:38] they did the booth was thirsty because a
[1:17:42] rain was needed boot with this tea
[1:17:46] because Irene was needed each one looked
[1:17:51] like prayin with his little head bent
[1:17:54] over Lord send rain send her in know
[1:17:59] this is the vision and create clouds
[1:18:01] come up and the rain fell upon both of
[1:18:04] them and when it did the little we jump
[1:18:08] up and begin to say praise the Lord
[1:18:09] praise the Lord a little we'd jump right
[1:18:12] at the same time and more praise the
[1:18:13] Lord praise a lot and then the vision
[1:18:17] was interpreted the rain falls on the
[1:18:20] just and the unjust the same spirit can
[1:18:23] fall in a meeting and everyone with
[1:18:24] Joyce and it hypocrites Christians all
[1:18:26] together exactly right but what is it by
[1:18:29] their fruits the unknown that's the only
[1:18:32] way it can never be known then you see
[1:18:34] how since Wild Oats while wheat and
[1:18:37] grain sometimes impersonates genuine
[1:18:40] domestic great so close that it would
[1:18:43] deceive the very elect 'add I think we
[1:18:46] are living in a timely age that these
[1:18:48] things should be preached on and talked
[1:18:50] about so close in the last days that he
[1:18:56] could not depend upon us sit in church a
[1:18:57] separate them same Methodists or
[1:19:00] Baptists or Pentecost some so he sends
[1:19:02] his angels to separate them
[1:19:04] an angel is coming to bring the
[1:19:08] separation between right and wrong and
[1:19:10] no one can do that but the angel of the
[1:19:13] Lord and he is the one that's gonna tell
[1:19:17] which is right and which is wrong God
[1:19:19] sent he sent his angels at the last
[1:19:21] times not angels don't you hear but
[1:19:23] angels at the last time and an angel is
[1:19:26] actually a messenger notice he said the
[1:19:30] shooters or world and also what the seed
[1:19:33] was so you have to identify this is a
[1:19:35] vision yet no he's gonna identify the
[1:19:38] shore and what the seed is because you
[1:19:41] have to know what the seed is and you're
[1:19:43] gonna know what seed is coming inside of
[1:19:45] you and what seed you already got oh
[1:19:47] praise Him a lot isn't that wonderful
[1:19:50] no the saw was he the Son of God who
[1:19:53] sent for when forth sowing seed the
[1:19:56] enemy came behind him was the devil and
[1:19:58] sowed the seed of discrepancy behind the
[1:20:02] right seed no he said the seed is the
[1:20:06] word of God and Jesus enters in a place
[1:20:09] the word is a seed and every seed will
[1:20:11] bring forth of its kind
[1:20:13] now if the Christian the cheerin of the
[1:20:16] God has become the seed of God so you
[1:20:19] have to become God's seed like Noor was
[1:20:22] like Moses was like Abraham was you
[1:20:26] yourself have become God seeded on the
[1:20:29] earth hallelujah
[1:20:31] now if the churn of God has become the
[1:20:34] seed of God there must be the Word of
[1:20:36] God the word manifested in the age of
[1:20:39] living in so God gave his promise at the
[1:20:42] beginning and each it had its seed its
[1:20:45] time and its promises when Noah came on
[1:20:48] the scene he was a seed of God for that
[1:20:50] age the Word of God when Moses come he
[1:20:53] couldn't combat Knaus message it
[1:20:55] wouldn't work he was the seed of God at
[1:20:56] that time when Christ come he could not
[1:20:58] combat nor on Moses age message isn't
[1:21:01] that right now we have left you Luther's
[1:21:04] aged Wesleyan Methodist age Pentecostal
[1:21:07] age each age has given my promise of the
[1:21:08] world and the people of that age that
[1:21:12] manifests
[1:21:14] not porcfest not not not not a doofus
[1:21:17] that manifests this the promise word is
[1:21:22] the seed of that age in other words the
[1:21:26] manifestation will be the interpretation
[1:21:29] you'll have to wonder about it it's
[1:21:31] being manifested or do you believe that
[1:21:34] now Island is happen under a church and
[1:21:37] who Church and watcher I'm gonna doing
[1:21:38] that you know this has to do with the
[1:21:40] word promised being manifested because
[1:21:44] when Jesus came is that Pharisees in
[1:21:46] that Sadducees a larger audience it had
[1:21:49] all kind of types of churches but he
[1:21:51] came according to promise all glory to
[1:21:55] God and the bride will come according to
[1:21:57] promise he promised a revival he
[1:22:01] promised a super church he promised the
[1:22:03] people that know their God shall be
[1:22:06] strong so if you're weak you have to
[1:22:08] know your God it means you have to come
[1:22:10] forward not to get to know who you
[1:22:12] bought is your blood bigger than your
[1:22:14] problem so it also coming with a heavy
[1:22:16] shoulder like that your God bigger than
[1:22:19] your situation just a joke on me Eddy
[1:22:22] press you only kept that way before you
[1:22:24] don't know your God but your God open
[1:22:26] the Red Sea you're gonna open the blinds
[1:22:28] I your God raise the dead your God heals
[1:22:32] the sick you're bored pastor that's your
[1:22:34] God
[1:22:34] [Music]
[1:22:36] your boat is away mate huh that's your
[1:22:39] God I don't know what Nordic God your
[1:22:42] God he's a koala mommies he's a court of
[1:22:45] war Oh hallelujah praise God hey man so
[1:22:55] jesus said they are the children of the
[1:22:57] kingdom the manifestation of the Holy
[1:23:01] Spirit operating to his children is the
[1:23:06] seed of the kingdom at that age not
[1:23:09] somebody in this group or somebody in
[1:23:11] that group or somebody said a seed no he
[1:23:14] said he can try it he qualified the
[1:23:18] manifestation of the Holy Spirit operate
[1:23:22] him in those children is the seed of the
[1:23:26] kingdom of God so Satan sowed discord or
[1:23:29] the seed of discrepancy he loves discord
[1:23:35] amen he was the one guilty of doing this
[1:23:38] horrible thing
[1:23:39] and Satan sword is see from the
[1:23:41] beginning when God places for his
[1:23:42] harvest of humans upon the earth Adam of
[1:23:45] course not had another the truth and
[1:23:48] right and wrong but he has never come to
[1:23:50] that yet but we find out God give his
[1:23:53] children his word for the defense we
[1:23:55] have no other defense than the Word of
[1:23:58] God that is our defense there's no bomb
[1:24:02] shelter there is no hiding place
[1:24:04] there is no Arizona or California or
[1:24:07] they were into America there is no
[1:24:09] defense but the Word of God the Word of
[1:24:12] God is your defense and it will defeat
[1:24:15] the devil anyplace anytime anywhere
[1:24:18] under any condition the word can never
[1:24:21] be defeated it is so powerful that Jesus
[1:24:25] said heaven and earth will pass away but
[1:24:28] my word that never pass away
[1:24:31] could we get my shot for the world and
[1:24:35] every word is a seed are a yummy season
[1:24:42] he's our only defense being in him we
[1:24:47] are safe
[1:24:48] Jesus was so confident of the prophetic
[1:24:51] utterance
[1:24:52] from the pivot smote I shall not suffer
[1:24:55] my Holy One see corruption David spoke
[1:24:57] that out jesus knew the scripture so he
[1:25:00] know he half the brains within three
[1:25:02] days he was so confident of the
[1:25:05] prophetic creative word that was spoken
[1:25:07] to the Prophet David he said destroy
[1:25:10] this body I mean three days I will raise
[1:25:13] it up myself
[1:25:18] Laurie Jesus wasn't imagining anything
[1:25:23] he wasn't hope ain't gonna happen
[1:25:25] he know cordial I see you that was not
[1:25:29] David that was the Spirit of God coming
[1:25:33] up on David ringing prophetic creative
[1:25:36] utterance
[1:25:38] [Applause]
[1:25:41] and if that spirit come upon me today
[1:25:44] and speaks to you it can't feel because
[1:25:49] pluck a line or give the Lord ahsoka No
[1:25:53] [Applause]
[1:25:58] hallelujah hallelujah yes yes yes no be
[1:26:04] seated we men know this harvest time at
[1:26:09] the beginning when God saw a seed upon
[1:26:10] the earth and give it into his hands of
[1:26:13] his children his family to keep that
[1:26:15] world that was the offense/defense to
[1:26:17] keep the world
[1:26:18] here come the enemy broke the barrier by
[1:26:21] sowing a seed of discrepancy contrary to
[1:26:24] the Word of God God told him you can eat
[1:26:26] of every tree in the garden but the
[1:26:27] trees in the midst don't touch that
[1:26:29] because they dare you eat that day you
[1:26:31] die Satan came to the serpent and asks
[1:26:33] what did God say the cold blood wasn't
[1:26:36] talking to him so you have to invite
[1:26:39] information and when Eve said because
[1:26:42] her husband was out to work and when the
[1:26:44] Eve where God say we could either vote
[1:26:47] achieve a dead tree in the midst we
[1:26:49] shall show you that he said you shall

[1:27:15] husband piece of it later and he fell
[1:27:17] true but she was deceived because she
[1:27:21] thought she was right the husband wasn't
[1:27:23] received he went with her and you know
[1:27:24] he's wrong because you know what God
[1:27:26] said it's not right that's why caught on
[1:27:29] the break the curse and that's why
[1:27:30] cavalry come to break the curse of sin

[2:03:34] never was a chicken son you always a
[2:03:40] evil
[2:03:41] [Applause]
[2:03:53] maybe season continued now the Word of
[2:03:58] God within the Bible is as good to us
[2:04:00] and every promise has the same power of
[2:04:04] creation behind it that is God's Word
[2:04:07] did at beginning if we believe it to be
[2:04:09] the Word of God it depends on where the
[2:04:11] seed falls if it falls into growing that
[2:04:14] can create a moisture and nourishment
[2:04:17] around the promise of God it will bring
[2:04:19] forth every promise the Bible me that is
[2:04:22] why we strongly emphasize worship here
[2:04:23] I'm praising God because Balram says the
[2:04:27] praising and worshiping is decrease in
[2:04:28] water atmosphere for the sea to
[2:04:30] germinate and grew and so on either and
[2:04:33] he type it with Rebecca Elijah
[2:04:35] lilius asked the Lord the damsel that
[2:04:38] watered my camel and give me water let
[2:04:41] her be the one raisa okay everybody one
[2:04:44] husband but you see the other a certain
[2:04:47] behavior so Eli Lilly is there was
[2:04:52] looking for a certain behavior
[2:04:54] he wasn't looking for look you look
[2:04:56] every kind of clothes and clothes he
[2:04:58] wearing you were looking for behavior he
[2:05:00] asked sports-specific let the dams and
[2:05:03] that will give me water and water my
[2:05:05] camels if you know what come and have a
[2:05:07] big hump
[2:05:08] I'd almost guarantee this whole two and
[2:05:14] a half buckets pull camel nice custody
[2:05:16] children see that but has he not
[2:05:19] knowledge - a technique that she's a lot
[2:05:21] of water - water cover all them sisters
[2:05:23] by some snobbish notion one who is that
[2:05:25] man
[2:05:25] the man who died - I'm a nice man behind
[2:05:29] that man you know that man bein a man
[2:05:32] Isaac
[2:05:32] so watch Rebecca come she said to see
[2:05:36] can I water for you when you come
[2:05:38] Rebecca can think more no Isaac she's
[2:05:41] not thinking about that she sees
[2:05:42] somebody does she want the self
[2:05:45] [Music]
[2:05:46] in half and have no um I like holy look
[2:05:51] Isaac wasn't there for him and like how
[2:05:54] we look the blood I take him he's not
[2:05:57] there for your blood to take him or not
[2:05:58] ethically it's a Sylvan was sent out and
[2:06:02] Eli and Rebecca know nothing about that
[2:06:05] so here what the brown said the same
[2:06:07] camera she watered and the same camera
[2:06:10] ticket Isaac I mean say the same word
[2:06:13] yeah that you water with your praises
[2:06:18] but take it to the Holy Ghost
[2:06:20] [Applause]
[2:06:27] so that's why I know if you're not
[2:06:30] prison and worshiping God us stature
[2:06:32] coming right yet so you don't know
[2:06:34] whether it was the Isaac or Gloria of
[2:06:37] course if you want to see Isaac start a
[2:06:41] camera right by giving the camera some
[2:06:43] good water because the camera represent
[2:06:46] the word which is a power to take it
[2:06:49] away after go but that word need water
[2:06:52] sadness area
[2:06:54] [Applause]
[2:07:00] maybe season prophecy there's some spoke
[2:07:06] original seed prophecy ah you enjoying
[2:07:09] the Lord this morning you enjoying the
[2:07:12] world this morning you in the spirit
[2:07:14] this morning listen to the prophecy
[2:07:17] remember there will be a denominational
[2:07:20] put together and pretty soon it will be
[2:07:22] terrific they will bring themselves
[2:07:25] together into this Federation of
[2:07:27] churches and this kind of a church will
[2:07:31] be put out of operation as far as they
[2:07:34] know it's at that time that Jesus will
[2:07:40] appear and he will show which is by
[2:07:43] languages not remember Christian friends
[2:07:46] I'm a man I can make mistakes but God
[2:07:49] being God cannot make a mistake all the
[2:07:52] words that's been written must be
[2:07:54] fulfilled jesus said so so we got things
[2:07:58] in the scripture that must fulfill and
[2:08:00] this is one of them this boycott is to
[2:08:03] come but before this worker can come of
[2:08:06] the mocking of the beasts here we go
[2:08:09] there has to be a seat soon forgot to
[2:08:13] take our church out of it before the
[2:08:17] master of the beasts before the boy
[2:08:20] could come there has to be a seed shown
[2:08:23] to take the church out Oh
[2:08:26] Florina caught so what'd you come here
[2:08:29] for to get seed
[2:08:31] [Applause]
[2:08:42] what's the secret the work is in the
[2:08:46] brain deafening the bride concealing her
[2:08:48] she is pregnant with God all right let's
[2:08:58] go
[2:08:59] [Music]
[2:09:01] the shock has to leave the seed to get
[2:09:06] the seed in the presence of the Sun so
[2:09:09] it can be ripened rightly so we know the
[2:09:13] shock come like the Pentecostals was
[2:09:15] like a shell over the seed and when it's
[2:09:18] green the shock is green and the seed is
[2:09:20] dream but then here comes the Sun and
[2:09:23] when the Sun set the heat and trials and
[2:09:26] tests and tribulation and pressure
[2:09:30] people do like that you know pressure
[2:09:32] come to Jesus everything will be all
[2:09:34] right come to Jesus tool best to be
[2:09:35] stress is that right not just a sign on
[2:09:37] pipoca ignore that all that come to
[2:09:42] court must suffer persecution don't call
[2:09:45] me that too blessed to be stressed
[2:09:46] foolishness that not anything memorize
[2:09:48] this man figured I want to comfort this
[2:09:51] day self so after the pressure comes
[2:09:55] downside of heat the shock after dry and
[2:09:58] pull away for the sea to get right me
[2:10:02] so when he sucked shot drying under the
[2:10:05] Sun its ripening seed she becomes more
[2:10:08] mature right ok so then in the
[2:10:12] revelation is the shock was only a
[2:10:14] carrier of the green all the plant life
[2:10:17] ok so I plant a seed alpha church it
[2:10:20] shoot up a blade stalk tassel and it
[2:10:24] come back to original again to the top
[2:10:25] all this promoted life is as carriers
[2:10:28] it's a carrier of the life but all the
[2:10:32] life is got up in the seed when it come
[2:10:35] back in the seed the bride or the church
[2:10:38] or the elect have original seed with the
[2:10:41] life locked up in it all that Syrian
[2:10:44] true is the gate
[2:10:45] and then be buried because it cannot
[2:10:50] bury a green seed so that's why going to
[2:10:52] harvest you into rightness or glory to
[2:10:55] God as you can see the need to die out
[2:10:57] break out and reproduce the green Oh
[2:11:02] hallelujah
[2:11:03] furtive Adam says Squatch remember
[2:11:07] there's no more seed promise to a woman
[2:11:09] after Mary so Mary had to see but she
[2:11:12] was like shocked the seed was Christ in
[2:11:14] Mary isn't that right there's no money
[2:11:16] nominations promised after Pentecost
[2:11:17] it's the rapture and the bride coming
[2:11:19] forth from here the seed the wood will
[2:11:22] manifest again okay here we go notice
[2:11:24] how close it is Matthew 24:24
[2:11:26] the two spirits in the last days the
[2:11:29] church spirit of the church people it's
[2:11:33] a spirit now and the bride spirit of the
[2:11:36] bride people would be so close together
[2:11:37] that we see the very latest possible so
[2:11:40] the chest of aspirational do let them
[2:11:42] tire squat inside a gig and I was the
[2:11:51] bright spirit with the worship God
[2:11:54] because jesus said the overcome and the
[2:11:56] true worshipers will worship the father
[2:11:58] in spirit and in truth just members yet
[2:12:03] hinder you untied upset you but you're
[2:12:06] the person go remember weed and wheat
[2:12:08] growing together you know you can't
[2:12:10] separate them in oh now I carry bleak
[2:12:14] all the ways you can't reach
[2:12:20] if you can't speak that because I don't
[2:12:22] know who is who the Bible said leave
[2:12:25] them alone until time I harvest what
[2:12:28] glory to God
[2:12:28] so therefore Yaga rest within the stalk
[2:12:32] remember God spoke to Abraham about
[2:12:34] Sarah bringing her child she adopted
[2:12:36] pass it on to Hagar then he got and
[2:12:39] after tree woman he got Sarah and Mary
[2:12:41] and then here come the manchild
[2:12:43] he said but Pentecost represent a Mary
[2:12:45] Mary the last teach of it she was not
[2:12:48] the seed yet the life of the seed was in
[2:12:50] her but it had matured yet it had
[2:12:53] matured so when they like mature they
[2:12:55] have to pretty shotgun hold it no more
[2:12:57] shock filter you want to ban you stay
[2:13:01] there boy I stated nine months up coming
[2:13:04] out Luther when the hospital's first
[2:13:07] word justly by fate Wesley told
[2:13:10] sonification second definite worker is
[2:13:12] Pentecost
[2:13:13] till wood restoration of the gifts but
[2:13:15] the entire seed has to come forth and
[2:13:18] that is what William Branham came
[2:13:20] because the only apart so he came with
[2:13:23] the full seed justification was part son
[2:13:25] sectionals part penny kostas was part
[2:13:27] but where abraham came with the full
[2:13:29] seed the entire word the message came to
[2:13:31] that elijah is not right the entire seed
[2:13:34] has to come forward
[2:13:36] how did it nominated one word another
[2:13:39] word another word here we go but there's
[2:13:41] got to be something that cannot be
[2:13:42] denominated are you ready do you want to
[2:13:46] know what it is something that cannot be
[2:13:48] denominated it's the entirety of the
[2:13:51] life you cannot denominate the life
[2:13:55] [Applause]
[2:13:58] you can't miss the wrong words but you
[2:14:00] can't fool around their life like you
[2:14:03] put concrete underground the plant was
[2:14:05] discord aside and come up got killed in
[2:14:07] life so there's got to be some that
[2:14:10] can't be dominated is the entirety of
[2:14:12] the life that Sandhya has to produce
[2:14:14] itself again on a bride are you hearing
[2:14:19] what I'm saying
[2:14:20] okay the Bible's to be finished the
[2:14:24] Gentile dissipation is disposition is to
[2:14:26] be finished which the church is of
[2:14:28] course when this anointed messenger
[2:14:30] arrives of course he will plant the seed
[2:14:32] of the entire Bible
[2:14:33] so whatever on plant the seed of the
[2:14:37] entire the entire Bible so he plant the
[2:14:41] permit because the permit is a Bible
[2:14:44] that's the total see deal Oh hallelujah
[2:14:47] praise God who is the son of man the
[2:14:50] shore what is the seed the entire Bible
[2:14:55] we're not supposed to go in you let's
[2:15:00] continue to teach book this messenger
[2:15:03] Malachi for revision 10-7 is going to do
[2:15:05] two things one a corner Malachi for he
[2:15:08] retained a hostile return to the
[2:15:09] father's true he revealed a Michelin
[2:15:11] seven thunders in revision ten which are
[2:15:14] the revelations contained in the seven
[2:15:16] seals it will be teased divinely
[2:15:18] revealed mystery truths that will
[2:15:21] literally turn the hostile return back
[2:15:23] to the father's so butter brown came to
[2:15:26] reveal the thunders
[2:15:26] to the hospital Sharon back to the
[2:15:29] fathers from the Seventh Seal
[2:15:31] he said now at the end D and the end
[2:15:34] time seal when it starts seventh seal
[2:15:37] and time see you when it starts will be
[2:15:40] a total secret remember aeration ten at
[2:15:43] the end of the seven angels message we
[2:15:45] are the end time the opening of the
[2:15:47] seventh seal
[2:15:48] seventh seal announces or Sheridan begin
[2:15:52] time what time is that going to run out
[2:15:55] so every single day we are running outta
[2:15:57] time
[2:16:00] think about that now alone
[2:16:04] age is picking up on you tangle alone
[2:16:07] then in the guide he said at the
[2:16:10] finishing of the seventh season when it
[2:16:12] starts stops in silence it starts as a
[2:16:14] secret but I had the finish of the
[2:16:15] Seventh Seal the mystery of God should
[2:16:17] be finished in who've audience what he
[2:16:19] is how we live his nature
[2:16:21] you supposed to be all the way up there
[2:16:23] by that time to bring us into the full
[2:16:27] statue of the son the daughters of God
[2:16:29] at the finishing we can't be lacking we
[2:16:33] have to be climbing that ladder there

[2:28:01] that's the word
[2:28:09] Oh
[2:28:14] maybe season Luke 8:11 2:15 Jesus
[2:28:19] speaking now the parable is this the
[2:28:23] seed is the word of God do it by the
[2:28:25] wayside I did it here then commit the
[2:28:28] devil and take it away the word out of
[2:28:29] their hearts at least they should
[2:28:31] believe and be saved they on the rock a
[2:28:33] day which when they hear receive the
[2:28:35] word with joy these have no root for
[2:28:37] what for which for why believe in time
[2:28:39] of temptation following David fell among
[2:28:42] thorns a day which when they have heard
[2:28:44] go forth and a choked with cares and
[2:28:47] riches and pleasures of life and bring
[2:28:49] no fruit to perfection but that on good
[2:28:53] ground are they which in an honest and
[2:28:56] good heart haven't heard a word keep it
[2:28:59] and bring forth fruit with patience
[2:29:03] that's Luke description Matthew
[2:29:05] description and 13 treaty 11 says this
[2:29:07] and he spake many things unto them in
[2:29:09] parables saying behold I saw and for the
[2:29:10] snow when he sowed some seeds fell by
[2:29:13] the wayside the falls came and Evod him
[2:29:14] up some fell upon stony places where
[2:29:17] they had not much as 4:20 sprung up
[2:29:20] because they had no deepness of earth
[2:29:22] when the Sun was up they were scorched
[2:29:24] because they had no root they withered
[2:29:26] away some fell among thorns and the
[2:29:29] thorns sprung up choked them
[2:29:31] others fell into good ground brought
[2:29:33] forth fruit some one hundredfold some
[2:29:34] sixtyfold and some thirtyfold who are in
[2:29:40] stir hear let him hear
[2:29:41] Cypress came and said unto Him wise
[2:29:44] because I want troubles because it's
[2:29:45] given unto you to know the mysteries of
[2:29:47] the kingdom of heaven but to them it is
[2:29:50] not given so the parable of the saw
[2:29:53] pictures the whole cost for this age
[2:29:56] isn't that right it shows the Word of
[2:30:00] God in different hearts and the results
[2:30:03] that follow and perfection cannot come
[2:30:06] by the ones that fall on rocky grounds
[2:30:09] by the one that fallen through a side by
[2:30:12] the one that fallen stony or the one
[2:30:14] that fell in thorns
[2:30:15] it can only come from a heart good wrong
[2:30:20] put on your bigger amen
[2:30:22] so now we have the world is perfect know
[2:30:26] we coordinate is something that's not in
[2:30:27] the heart the word is the seed the son
[2:30:30] of man is the soul but let's deal with
[2:30:32] the heart now because what Jesus dealing
[2:30:34] with you know is for heart conditions

[2:34:16] God be and record of his word by
[2:34:17] vindicating what he said he would do now
[2:34:20] we know this is day of salvation
[2:34:21] where God is calling men from the world
[2:34:24] from a life of sin into a life of
[2:34:27] service and in the day that God has part
[2:34:31] of his Rivermen high great signs and
[2:34:33] wonders after a company the ministry of
[2:34:36] this day when the former and latter in

[2:36:03] I'm gonna Branham talk about that time
[2:36:04] of lingering he talked about people he
[2:36:07] said no he said no I always church the
[2:36:09] Holy Spirit fell upon and upon Jesus
[2:36:12] chose 12:1 and my fallen and they chose
[2:36:14] my task to take his place and the Holy
[2:36:17] Spirit reasons it all it was in order
[2:36:19] before the dynamics felt
[2:36:21] isn't that right before it fell and I
[2:36:22] believe all these things that has a time
[2:36:24] of lingering waiting for a time for the
[2:36:27] secret to be fulfilled he said if we
[2:36:29] just impatient like a challenge and run
[2:36:32] ahead it hinders the work we must move
[2:36:34] reverently another purpose and heart
[2:36:37] that if God would is asked to do such
[2:36:39] and such so he is talking about they
[2:36:41] always come a time of lingering the link
[2:36:43] of attendees in the upper room Moses had
[2:36:45] to wait all of them have to wait until
[2:36:47] the appointed time when even court came
