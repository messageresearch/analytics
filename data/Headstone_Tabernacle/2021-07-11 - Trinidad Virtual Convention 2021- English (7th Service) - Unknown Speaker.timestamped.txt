[24:59] for inviting me to greet the virtual

[25:12] last january my wife was diagnosed
[25:16] with a stage 4 cancer yes a stage 4
[25:20] cancer she had to go to
[25:23] through many treatments but before
[25:27] going through their treatments we called
[25:31] upon the name of the lord and all along
[25:34] we trusted the lord jesus and this week
[25:37] the oncologist called to say to my wife
[25:41] mrs ailstock i have good news for you
[25:45] all traces of cancer are gone
[25:49] praise be to god what a mighty god we

[25:53] praise the lord amen
[25:57] praise god
[26:07] we started
[26:36] hallelujah
[26:38] have a little thought here um as
[26:41] to greet the convention first
[26:43] corinthians
[26:44] 13 8 charity never fails
[26:57] i believe the bride has entered the
[27:00] season
[27:00] of that love that never fails
[27:04] yes
[27:12] because we see now everything is failing
[27:15] nations are failing israel's awakening
[27:19] this whole civilization is failing
[27:22] and also the love of many christians
[27:25] is failing it has waxed cold
[27:46] is hallelujah
[27:49] but when everything is failing
[27:52] there is a bride on this earth today
[27:56] that stands in love under the anointing
[28:00] of charity that never fails amen
[28:04] charity that never fails and it's a
[28:06] paradox
[28:21] she stands in love yes
[28:24] she stands in love way up in the pyramid
[28:28] she stands in that last virtue called
[28:31] brotherly love which is
[28:35] her requirement
[28:50] listen the bride knows how to say
[28:54] forgive me my brother and yes i forgive
[28:58] you
[28:59] my brother praise god
[29:03] we can disagree with one another yet
[29:07] be friendly yes the true bride of christ
[29:11] knows
[29:12] that rapturing faith is based on what
[29:17] unforgiveness
[29:24] is
[29:46] amen let me say this i believe that
[29:49] there was
[29:50] a season where we had to learn
[29:54] all the teachings pertaining to this
[29:57] glorious
[29:58] message that god gave us we had to
[30:01] receive this mystery
[30:03] and that mystery this mystery and that
[30:06] mystery
[30:08] but this time is past
[30:12] now this is the time to display what we
[30:15] received in our hearts don't you believe
[30:18] it brother
[30:19] and sister
[30:49] if for instance you have studied
[30:52] many years at the medical school to
[30:55] become
[30:56] let's say a a heart surgeon
[31:00] after all your schooling well
[31:03] you have to start somewhere to put it in
[31:06] practice
[31:08] to put in practice what you have learned
[31:12] amen for example
[31:25] now here comes your first patient he
[31:28] says to you
[31:30] doctor i badly need the heart surgery
[31:33] i want you to operate on me
[31:38] passion
[31:44] period what if you start telling him
[31:48] all the the uh theoretical
[31:52] knowledge you learned at the medical
[31:55] school
[31:56] you you would say let me tell you
[31:58] everything about the
[32:00] heart and the tummy and its functioning
[32:04] the patient would say well that's fine
[32:07] doctor
[32:08] but i want you to operate on me i want
[32:11] you to apply
[32:12] all the things
[32:40] well the bride all these years
[32:44] let me take let me say this the bride
[32:46] all these years
[32:47] since malachi 4 left she has learned
[32:52] the abc she has learned
[32:55] all the algebra to know who god is
[33:00] what he is how he lives his nature
[33:03] his being but now brother
[33:07] sister it's time it's time to display
[33:11] the token from faith to charity
[33:15] yes it's time to display that token
[33:18] from faith to charity
[33:22] le pools pano
[33:46] the earthly goal of each member of this
[33:50] bride
[33:51] is the stature of a perfect man
[34:01] so in closing i'll say this
[34:04] bride keep on pressing let go
[34:08] and let god have his wonderful way
[34:12] on our foundation our faith that's in
[34:15] him
[34:16] let virtue knowledge temperance patience
[34:20] godliness and brotherly kindness
[34:23] the requirement of our age work in you
[34:28] work in me so the fond mother nature
[34:32] foreign
[35:06] then charity that never fails
[35:09] will cap off the pyramid of our life
[35:13] and then praise god praise god
[35:16] praise god we will unite with the dead
[35:19] in christ

[45:17] the shadows of redemption and
[45:20] my inspiration is the seven seals
[45:24] bring on another ephesians
[45:28] and my subject the seven seals of
[45:31] redemption
[45:33] i've got a few kind of scriptures here
[45:35] um romans
[45:37] 15 and verse 4
[45:40] and um hebrews 10 1.
[45:46] i'll read romans 15 verse 4 uh
[45:51] romans 15 verse 4 written this was for
[45:53] whatsoever things were written
[45:55] at four times were written for our
[45:57] learning
[45:58] that we through patience and comfort of
[46:00] the scriptures might have hope
[46:06] uh brother branham in his ministry
[46:09] he brought out a lot of the
[46:13] teachings of scripture by using
[46:16] what he called and what bible scholars
[46:18] call types and shadows
[46:20] the apostle paul also did the same thing
[46:24] paul went into the mysteries of the that
[46:28] were hidden in the old testament and by
[46:30] bringing out the types and the shadows
[46:32] he brought out the
[46:35] deep truths of the gospel story of
[46:39] our redemption and brother branham
[46:42] uh um took this to an act
[46:45] in bringing out the real truths and the
[46:49] deep things of scripture by
[46:52] employing types and shadows
[46:57] he brought a lot of deep truths out just
[46:59] by showing us in types and shadows
[47:01] what um god was trying to tell us
[47:05] in the holy word of god um but the
[47:08] banham said on this quote here
[47:10] excuse me um
[47:15] um from the seat of god 1954
[47:21] may the 14th now i know
[47:25] you say now i'm a topologist that's
[47:27] right
[47:28] because i know i know one thing if i'm
[47:31] going towards my shadow
[47:33] and i see what my shadow looks like i
[47:35] have some conception or what
[47:38] i look like whether i'm in a whether i'm
[47:40] a four-footed beast
[47:42] or a feathered bird or whatever it is
[47:46] it will shadow and the old testament was
[47:49] the shadow of the new
[47:51] we got it last night in revelation 12
[47:53] the woman with the law under her feet
[47:56] the man i mean the moon and the sun at
[47:58] her head and it
[47:59] and he typed how all those things
[48:02] hebrews the 11th chapter tells us
[48:04] there were all types and shadows i
[48:06] believe hebrews 12 said
[48:08] that sin we are compassed about with
[48:10] such a great cloud of witnesses
[48:12] let us lay aside every weight and the
[48:14] sin that does so easily beset us
[48:16] that we might run with patience the race
[48:19] that is set before us
[48:21] now we sin those things
[48:24] also i i think i should at this point
[48:26] here i forgot to acknowledge
[48:29] my other ministry brothers who have gone
[48:31] before and who are going to come
[48:33] afterwards
[48:34] thank you so much brothers for your
[48:35] ministries and the blessing
[48:37] that your messages have been in this
[48:39] convention and always
[48:40] and the blessing that you always are to
[48:42] the blood of jesus christ i'm so proud
[48:44] and thankful and happy to be associated
[48:46] with you in the work of the lord
[48:48] god richly bless you so brother benham
[48:51] on this career let us see
[48:53] that he is a topologist he just you know
[48:56] goes into the word of god and brings out
[48:59] the truths
[49:01] of the mysteries of redemption
[49:05] from the types and the shadows and let
[49:07] us understand the old testament like
[49:09] paul said
[49:10] is the shadow of the new testament and
[49:13] when
[49:14] the real thing comes and the shadow
[49:15] disappears as the
[49:17] shadow and everything are coming
[49:19] together the shadow decreases in size
[49:21] and emerges and becomes a new thing
[49:26] now what the bible says about taps and
[49:29] shadows
[49:30] is said in so many places hebrews 3
[49:32] hebrews 4 hebrews 10
[49:34] different places but
[49:37] we can paraphrase what the bible says
[49:40] this way he said these things all of
[49:43] these things were written for our
[49:44] example for our learning like reading
[49:46] romans 5
[49:47] for our learning so that will not come
[49:49] after the same manner of unbelief
[49:52] also that will get the same personal
[49:54] results that they got
[49:57] in other words all the stories in the
[50:00] bible
[50:01] all these things these types and shadows
[50:04] hold within them lessons life lessons
[50:08] positive lessons negative lessons
[50:11] lessons
[50:12] that we can take and apply to our lives
[50:15] so we don't come to the same negative
[50:17] spot
[50:19] and so we can come to the same positive
[50:22] spot
[50:24] the shadows in the bible preview for us
[50:27] what it's going to be like and what it
[50:31] is that if you see the shadow the shadow
[50:33] is a preview of what's coming
[50:34] the shadow is a foretaste of what's
[50:37] coming the shadow
[50:38] is a the evidence of what is coming
[50:42] and shadow lets us see and understand
[50:44] the
[50:45] end from the beginning let us see the
[50:47] end from the beginning let us preview
[50:50] once we see the shadow we can know what
[50:52] is going to come when we can
[50:54] see the shadow so the shadow is a
[50:57] preview
[50:59] and just like faith is a preview the
[51:01] shadow is evidence of what's going to
[51:03] come
[51:04] just like faith is the evidence of what
[51:06] is going to come
[51:07] what this means that when you see the
[51:09] shadow and you can
[51:10] identify the shadow in the old testament
[51:13] in the bible
[51:14] then you know what's going to happen and
[51:16] that inspires faith
[51:18] so the shadow
[51:21] um like faith inspires your faith
[51:24] the shadow lets you know what's gonna
[51:27] happen
[51:27] because forever oh lord that what is
[51:30] selling heaven
[51:32] faith is a shadow the shadow
[51:35] the shadow is faith the shadow inspires
[51:38] faith
[51:38] the shadow is evidence of what's going
[51:40] to be so
[51:41] shadow is an evidence it encourages
[51:43] inspires our faith
[51:46] it gives us faith it inspires us
[51:48] encourages us to
[51:49] press on because when we take a look at
[51:51] the shadow we know
[51:53] what is going to happen the shadow is
[51:55] the substance the evidence of what's
[51:58] going to be
[51:59] so the shadows in the scriptures they
[52:01] give us faith
[52:02] they give us confidence for every
[52:05] situation
[52:06] today sums up i mean summing
[52:09] summing it all up the shadow is all
[52:12] about
[52:13] life application taking the stories in
[52:15] the bible
[52:16] and finding the lessons in there to
[52:19] apply to our
[52:20] everyday living and when we see how it
[52:23] works out in the bible and we go
[52:25] the same condition the same everything
[52:28] we know we are likely
[52:29] going to get the same result so the
[52:32] shadows in the bible the stories of the
[52:34] bible
[52:35] the lessons that we can get from those
[52:37] who is not just for us to
[52:39] for our head knowledge but so that we
[52:41] can apply to our lives because the bible
[52:43] says
[52:44] these things were written for our
[52:46] learning for our
[52:47] example so we take the lessons from
[52:50] these shadows
[52:50] from these different things and apply
[52:52] them to our lives
[52:54] we apply the lessons of scripture to
[52:57] every single area of our lives so we can
[52:59] become
[53:00] like jesus and indeed all scripture
[53:03] all scripture old testament new
[53:06] testament
[53:07] is for life application to apply these
[53:10] things to our lives
[53:11] and that's what all boys and friends
[53:13] every single word in the bible
[53:16] excuse me boils down to this one thing
[53:19] life application to apply the lessons of
[53:22] the scriptures
[53:23] to our hearts and our lives so we can be
[53:27] like jesus
[53:28] christ that's what it's all about
[53:31] friends
[53:31] so when we read our bibles when we read
[53:34] the stories in the bible
[53:35] what we want to do is number one what
[53:38] does that story mean
[53:39] number two what's the lesson what was
[53:42] the lesson for that day
[53:43] number three what's the lesson from that
[53:45] story today
[53:47] number four how do i apply the lessons
[53:50] from that story
[53:51] to my life today so i'll be a better
[53:54] person
[53:55] i'll be more like jesus christ every day
[53:57] so it all comes down
[53:58] to life application friends that's what
[54:00] it's all about
[54:01] so we might be like jesus christ every
[54:04] single day of our lives
[54:06] and god's made it so easy for us to send
[54:08] us the prophet and the prophet of god
[54:10] the prophet and venom makes the word of
[54:12] god present hence
[54:14] brother branham by employing types and
[54:16] shadows
[54:17] he's made the word of god come down to
[54:20] also
[54:20] simply the prophet makes the world
[54:24] present ends by employing
[54:27] types and shadows he's made the word of
[54:29] god present
[54:30] ends he brings all the stories from the
[54:32] old testament from the new testament
[54:34] and he brings them right down into
[54:36] present-day present context
[54:38] so you and i don't have to figure out he
[54:40] lists principles in the word of god for
[54:42] you and i
[54:42] to go into the scriptures by and we can
[54:46] uh break down the word of god for every
[54:49] single situation
[54:51] so the prophet by employing types and
[54:53] shadows makes the word of god
[54:55] present in so we can find the word of
[54:58] god the scriptures
[54:59] relevant for today so we can apply
[55:02] the scriptures to every single area
[55:06] of our lives that's what
[55:09] the prophet does that's the the the
[55:12] importance of a prophet to break down
[55:14] the word of god to bring down the
[55:16] mysteries
[55:17] from from the man of god to you and i
[55:20] as the word of god the word of god
[55:22] broken down
[55:23] are made into presence and so we can see
[55:25] the world in present tense
[55:28] and indeed we see all scripture in that
[55:30] context
[55:32] in the present for life application
[55:34] because the prophet makes
[55:35] what present ends so we can relate to
[55:38] the world we can find the word of god
[55:40] relevant
[55:41] all the stories in the bible all the big
[55:43] gods all the genealogies
[55:45] it brings them down into present tense
[55:47] so we will
[55:48] know how to apply these things to our
[55:51] lives
[55:52] so it's not just a story it's a message
[55:54] in there
[55:55] so that the what's the message so that
[55:57] we can apply the life of god in the
[55:59] scriptures
[56:00] so we know how to live we'll know how
[56:02] not to live
[56:04] so the life of god or in the scriptures
[56:08] revealed and unveiled throughout the
[56:09] scriptures which is the life of jesus
[56:12] christ
[56:12] his literal life will be manifested in
[56:15] each
[56:16] of our own lives and the story of
[56:19] redemption
[56:20] is all about the literal life of jesus
[56:23] christ
[56:24] back in the believer today that's the
[56:27] story of redemption
[56:29] and that's god's original plan in the
[56:31] garden of eden
[56:32] let us make man in our own image after
[56:35] our likeness
[56:36] so the shadows and types in the bible
[56:39] the stories of the bible they're not
[56:42] just stories
[56:43] god put them there for you and i because
[56:46] he wants you and i to get the input the
[56:49] lessons from those stories
[56:51] that we can apply them to our lives so
[56:54] that god's original plan and program to
[56:56] make man in his image
[56:58] will be achieved every single day in
[57:00] each of our lives
[57:02] so to recap quickly the old testament
[57:06] is a shadow of the new testament
[57:10] and so when paul came he went into the
[57:12] old testament
[57:14] and brought out the shadows and
[57:16] explained the message of redemption
[57:18] he took the children of israel uh uh
[57:21] took them from
[57:22] uh uh uh from egypt and
[57:25] expounded and showed them as the church
[57:28] of the living god
[57:29] as a type and shadow of the christian
[57:32] church today
[57:33] and going through the red sea going
[57:35] through the wilderness he put
[57:36] all the shadows for us all the times and
[57:39] brought up the input for us
[57:41] how those things were depicting and
[57:43] typing out redemption that was
[57:44] going to be revealed and unveiled in the
[57:46] new testament and all down through the
[57:49] bible
[57:49] all down through the bible paul did this
[57:57] uh uh uh uh uh uh many preachers
[58:00] go into the world and show you types and
[58:02] things so
[58:03] the bible is uh uh
[58:07] uh uh is written in symbols written in
[58:09] stories
[58:10] because god knows human beings will
[58:12] learn best by
[58:14] stories by uh uh all these
[58:17] different things but it means nothing to
[58:19] you and i if
[58:21] the stories in the bible cannot be
[58:23] brought down into present context for
[58:25] you
[58:26] and me and that's what the prophet of
[58:28] god did he brought the word of god down
[58:30] for you and i
[58:32] in present context and so the old
[58:34] testament
[58:35] the odds man is all about when the
[58:37] oldest man opened
[58:39] we see god in his creation the garden of
[58:42] eden
[58:43] and then the four adam and eve you know
[58:46] in a perfect state
[58:47] and then the fall and then the rest of
[58:49] the old testament is god
[58:51] dealing with his people uh the children
[58:53] of israel uh
[58:54] typing are they called out tapping out
[58:56] the church of believing god and then we
[58:57] go new
[58:58] when we get to the new testament we see
[59:00] also god
[59:01] coming down the beginnings of it god and
[59:04] his cr
[59:05] his son just like in eden god and his
[59:08] son
[59:09] are on bringing our for a new creation
[59:13] um jesus christ and then the the
[59:16] uh are the i mean the gospels were
[59:18] written and then the epistles and the
[59:20] book of revelation
[59:22] so the new testament is all about
[59:25] the uh the gospels the epistles
[59:29] and the book of revelation and in the
[59:32] gospels
[59:33] john stood out john's writing stood out
[59:36] and the epistles
[59:37] paul's writing stood out and how paul's
[59:39] writing stood out
[59:41] is because of the
[59:44] by types and shadows he was able to
[59:46] bring out the great stories the great
[59:48] mysteries of redemption he was able to
[59:52] dig deep and bring them out for you and
[59:53] i
[59:54] all through the ages
[59:57] so all scripture when you read the old
[1:00:01] testament when you read the new
[1:00:02] testament
[1:00:03] and these stories about jesus and this
[1:00:06] story is about the disciples these
[1:00:08] stories about
[1:00:09] the red sea these stories about all the
[1:00:12] all the happiness in the old testament
[1:00:15] elijah and
[1:00:16] samson the patriots all of these stories
[1:00:19] in
[1:00:19] all these stories there is a message
[1:00:23] a message of redemption there is a
[1:00:25] message in there
[1:00:26] all these tabs and shadows in there is
[1:00:29] hidden a message
[1:00:31] a message of redemption and it's this
[1:00:33] same message that has been from eden
[1:00:36] since eden is the same message god has
[1:00:39] only had one message
[1:00:42] is revealed that message in every type
[1:00:45] and shadow in the bible
[1:00:46] but it's just one single uh strange you
[1:00:49] will find there
[1:00:50] the message of redemption that has been
[1:00:53] the gospel story since eden
[1:00:56] in the old testament through the seven
[1:00:58] church ages
[1:01:00] and is the same gospel story today
[1:01:04] is the message of redemption hallelujah
[1:01:10] and the essence of this gospel
[1:01:11] redemption is simply this
[1:01:13] god wants his sons and daughters
[1:01:16] to be like him that's the essence
[1:01:19] of the gospel story of redemption to be
[1:01:22] in his very image
[1:01:24] to walk like he walked to talk like he
[1:01:26] talked to have his own life
[1:01:28] do the works that he did born of his
[1:01:30] bone flesh of his pledge
[1:01:32] spirit of his spirit work works of his
[1:01:35] works
[1:01:36] as it was in eden as was in the early
[1:01:38] right that's
[1:01:39] the essence of the gospel story of
[1:01:42] redemption
[1:01:43] but then the essence of this story was
[1:01:47] lost
[1:01:48] in eden with the passage of time
[1:01:52] adam and eve lost the essence of this
[1:01:54] story
[1:01:57] and that when they lost that that that
[1:02:00] brought the very
[1:02:01] need for redemption because adam and eve
[1:02:04] were created
[1:02:05] in the very image of god
[1:02:08] having god's image on the face of the
[1:02:11] earth
[1:02:12] doing the works of god on the face of
[1:02:14] the earth living on this area
[1:02:16] in the place of their father god god was
[1:02:18] the god of the universe but adam
[1:02:20] was the god of the earth he had
[1:02:22] ownership
[1:02:24] authority rulership over the earth amen
[1:02:27] he not only had
[1:02:28] worship of that he owned the earth he
[1:02:30] was the earth was his inheritance
[1:02:34] but when he lost that that was the
[1:02:36] essence of this gospel the message
[1:02:39] the stories in all of these uh uh
[1:02:42] um shadows in the bible that was the
[1:02:46] essence that was a hidden message there
[1:02:48] god wants his sons and daughters to be
[1:02:51] like him and when that was lost
[1:02:56] by adam and eve god brought it right
[1:03:00] back
[1:03:01] again here came jesus when he was born
[1:03:04] he restored that right back and took it
[1:03:07] higher
[1:03:08] with the new testament the new testament
[1:03:10] age opened
[1:03:12] and the the the the the bread of christ
[1:03:15] was the church of god was breath in the
[1:03:18] new testament
[1:03:18] age on the day of pentecost but like
[1:03:22] again
[1:03:23] the essence was lost with time the
[1:03:25] passion of time
[1:03:26] the essence of the gospel was lost that
[1:03:28] early bird of pentacles was there in the
[1:03:31] beauty of his holiness
[1:03:33] with the same life spirit of his spirit
[1:03:36] works of his works
[1:03:37] life of his life born of his bone
[1:03:41] that was who they were but with the
[1:03:43] passage of time
[1:03:44] like it happened in eden the essence was
[1:03:47] lost again
[1:03:49] and god said i will restore
[1:03:53] see the lord and he began to restore
[1:03:56] he started the work of restoration in
[1:03:59] luther
[1:04:00] in wesley pentecostals until
[1:04:03] he sent a great prophetic prophet the
[1:04:05] prophet of malacca for the prophet
[1:04:07] william branham in this end time here
[1:04:08] with a message to restore this essence
[1:04:13] back and bring back a people
[1:04:15] on the face of the earth by his message
[1:04:19] the people who under him their messenger
[1:04:22] will be the final voice
[1:04:24] to the final age and malacca for the
[1:04:27] propaganda was sent
[1:04:28] with a message of redemption to re uh
[1:04:31] with a message to reveal full
[1:04:33] total complete redemption
[1:04:36] by the seven seals he said the seven
[1:04:40] seals was direct commission
[1:04:42] to reveal and unfold
[1:04:45] and open up redemption
[1:04:48] to open the mystery of the seven seals
[1:04:51] of redemption
[1:04:52] that was his ministry that was his
[1:04:54] message
[1:04:55] so that the blood of all the ages
[1:05:00] would come right down to full
[1:05:03] total complete redemption
[1:05:06] and have a life and a ministry like adam
[1:05:09] had in eden
[1:05:10] like the blood of pentecost had oh my
[1:05:13] malacca first message of the seven seals
[1:05:16] of redemption
[1:05:19] is a story of the bible and that's the
[1:05:22] message
[1:05:23] in there was hidden all of these
[1:05:26] glorious things
[1:05:27] to bring us right back to the garden of
[1:05:30] eden
[1:05:30] the seven seals message of malachi 4
[1:05:34] is a story of redemption
[1:05:37] now you and i know the seven sails
[1:05:39] originated
[1:05:40] right in the man of god before the
[1:05:43] foundation of the world
[1:05:45] the seven seals had their origins in the
[1:05:48] man of god on the back
[1:05:50] parts of elohim's mind and so the seven
[1:05:53] seals
[1:05:54] they're all about our redemption all
[1:05:57] about
[1:05:58] our redemption and and
[1:06:01] and god splashed at names in blood
[1:06:04] that's when the seven seals
[1:06:05] had his origins when the seven seals
[1:06:07] came into being
[1:06:09] that was god himself coming into being
[1:06:11] and that was when
[1:06:12] your name my name was splashed in blood
[1:06:15] so whereas eternal
[1:06:16] as eternal himself whereas eternal as
[1:06:18] the eternal god himself
[1:06:21] the seven sea the seven seals from the
[1:06:24] back parts of god's mind
[1:06:26] that's where they had their origins from
[1:06:28] and the seven seals
[1:06:31] uh uh uh uh were the seven spirits of
[1:06:33] god because a seal
[1:06:35] is a the holy spirit is the seal of god
[1:06:38] and the seven seals of god is the seven
[1:06:41] spirits of god
[1:06:43] before the foundation of the world and
[1:06:45] that's the lamb of god
[1:06:46] and that's what you find in revelation 5
[1:06:48] you will get there
[1:06:50] and by these seven spirits over seven
[1:06:52] seals
[1:06:54] god brought forth a perfect man
[1:06:57] in the garden of eden the seven seals
[1:07:01] brought forth a perfect man in the
[1:07:04] garden of eden
[1:07:05] a perfect god bringing for the perfect
[1:07:08] son
[1:07:09] into a perfect world and that world
[1:07:12] was ephesians
[1:07:18] the perfect god the perfect son
[1:07:21] in a perfect world that was ephesians
[1:07:25] oh my
[1:07:28] adam lived in this efficient nature
[1:07:31] in the garden of eden brought him by the
[1:07:34] seven seals
[1:07:36] the ephesians the lamb of god
[1:07:39] elohim himself before the definition of
[1:07:41] the world
[1:07:43] in eden the seven seals brought on
[1:07:47] an efficient age he put adam into these
[1:07:50] ephesians in eden
[1:07:54] and like i said before adam lived in
[1:07:57] this
[1:07:58] perfect glorious state until he fell by
[1:08:00] sin
[1:08:01] and god walked around right back because
[1:08:04] the seven seals was the seventh seal the
[1:08:08] seven spirits of god
[1:08:10] was what brought up the ephesians
[1:08:14] in adam in the garden of eden
[1:08:20] and here come the seven sails himself
[1:08:24] jesus christ the ephesians himself the
[1:08:27] perfect god himself the perfect one
[1:08:29] himself
[1:08:30] here he came down born of a virgin a
[1:08:33] manger
[1:08:35] and he became our lord and a savior when
[1:08:38] he gave himself on calvary's mountain
[1:08:41] and he died res
[1:08:44] went to hades and resurrected and rose
[1:08:48] again
[1:08:49] and on the day of pentecost the church
[1:08:51] of god was
[1:08:52] birthed what was it the seven seal
[1:08:56] christ coming back into his church
[1:08:58] by his seven spirits again to
[1:09:01] unfold and unveil amen
[1:09:04] efficient in that early efficient church
[1:09:08] age
[1:09:09] and we see the story book of acts it was
[1:09:11] a perfect church
[1:09:12] it was a god because paul's writings to
[1:09:15] almost all of the churches
[1:09:17] was one problem or the other he was
[1:09:19] trying to
[1:09:20] sort out but when he spoke to the
[1:09:23] efficient church
[1:09:24] there was no prominent efficient church
[1:09:25] at all it was just about the regional
[1:09:27] church
[1:09:28] you can i mean bible scholars can call
[1:09:30] you whichever way but the fish
[1:09:32] the efficient church was all about unity
[1:09:34] all paul wrote to them
[1:09:35] he wasn't addressing any particular
[1:09:36] prayer it was a prophet church he was a
[1:09:38] church on fire was a church focused
[1:09:41] on the deep things of god and all paul
[1:09:43] talked to the ephesian church was
[1:09:45] unity in christ unity in the church
[1:09:48] unity in the home and putting on the
[1:09:51] whole armor of god
[1:09:52] to become a perfect man in jesus christ
[1:09:55] to be
[1:09:55] to become the born of his bone flesh of
[1:09:58] his flesh spirit of his spirit
[1:10:00] that's a vision a perfect church and
[1:10:02] jesus christ the ephesians
[1:10:04] came down and after him
[1:10:07] he produced an ephesians church age and
[1:10:09] those people
[1:10:10] were ushered by the holy spirit on the
[1:10:12] day of pentecost
[1:10:14] into the early efficient
[1:10:18] church age and we are promised
[1:10:22] after they lost it i will restore see
[1:10:25] the lord
[1:10:26] i will restore that efficient church
[1:10:29] right back
[1:10:30] again i will restore a perfect church a
[1:10:33] perfect bride
[1:10:36] right back again and so we were promised
[1:10:39] that there's going to be another
[1:10:41] efficiency
[1:10:43] jesus christ is going to come back
[1:10:44] himself he is the ephesians
[1:10:46] he's going to come back himself he is
[1:10:48] the ephesians
[1:10:49] he is the seals he is the seven spirits
[1:10:52] living in flesh
[1:10:53] the fullness of the godhead dwells in
[1:10:55] him bodily and through him
[1:10:58] when he comes he is going to bring on
[1:11:01] another ephesians
[1:11:05] and we saw that in malachi 4. malacca 4
[1:11:08] jesus christ was willing him and he
[1:11:10] lived in these ephesians we saw
[1:11:12] the works of christ we saw the spirit of
[1:11:14] god
[1:11:15] operating that prophet he lived in an
[1:11:17] ephesians
[1:11:20] and just like jesus christ in the days
[1:11:22] of his flesh police and ephesians he was
[1:11:24] the efficient
[1:11:25] and priests and efficient in the early
[1:11:27] price same way
[1:11:29] jesus christ in malachi 4 produced an
[1:11:32] efficiency in that prophet
[1:11:33] and will produce an efficiency in this
[1:11:36] bride a perfect man stand on the face of
[1:11:38] a perfect bride that's going a perfect
[1:11:40] rapture to go to a perfect
[1:11:43] garden of eden like adam lived in
[1:11:46] before he fell by sin
[1:11:51] speaking about ephesians um
[1:11:54] let me read you a quote or two here from
[1:11:56] brother branham
[1:11:59] [Music]
[1:12:03] all right
[1:12:06] on the message the horizon of the song
[1:12:09] brother branham said it probably through
[1:12:11] it
[1:12:11] he's the one who opened those seals he
[1:12:14] is
[1:12:15] those seals for the whole word of god is
[1:12:17] christ
[1:12:18] and christ is the seal that was opened
[1:12:22] what is the opening of the seals then
[1:12:24] revealing christ
[1:12:28] and the seven the very seven angels
[1:12:31] which
[1:12:32] represented the seven churches all
[1:12:34] completed and we couldn't even
[1:12:36] see it they did they took the picture
[1:12:38] not us
[1:12:39] and there he is standing there supreme
[1:12:41] george
[1:12:42] showing that he's alpha and omega the
[1:12:44] beginner and the
[1:12:48] end
[1:12:50] and he said on a paradox
[1:12:53] now we are taught in revelation the
[1:12:56] sixth chapter i believe
[1:12:58] yeah the sixth chapter of the seven
[1:13:00] seals
[1:13:02] that's the book to be sealed up with
[1:13:04] seven mysteries or seven stills
[1:13:06] revelation six and the last day
[1:13:09] revelation 10
[1:13:10] revelation 10 we find out that the
[1:13:12] laodicean last
[1:13:13] messenger of the last age and during the
[1:13:16] time
[1:13:16] of his prophecy that the seven sales
[1:13:19] will be
[1:13:20] opened the seven mysteries
[1:13:23] seven four misses that had been left off
[1:13:26] in every age there have been some of it
[1:13:28] left off
[1:13:29] the reformer uh didn't have
[1:13:32] the reformer didn't have enough time to
[1:13:35] uh um
[1:13:36] excuse me didn't have enough time to
[1:13:38] take care of it
[1:13:40] in the days of luther he only
[1:13:41] prejudicial by faith he was gone
[1:13:44] they made a church after that come
[1:13:46] wesley he preached sanctification
[1:13:49] very there it was and along come the
[1:13:51] pentecostals
[1:13:53] but we are promised according to
[1:13:55] revelation 10
[1:13:57] and according to malacca iv
[1:14:01] 2017 i mean it meant 20 1730
[1:14:05] and so forth there is that there is got
[1:14:08] to come
[1:14:09] an efficiency to this in other words in
[1:14:11] this day there's going to be an
[1:14:12] efficiency also
[1:14:14] jesus christ is the ephesians and jesus
[1:14:16] christ
[1:14:17] is was veiled in that prophet that's
[1:14:19] what he's talking about here was very in
[1:14:21] that prophet
[1:14:22] the ephesians here but after
[1:14:25] him all the time he always brings on
[1:14:28] an efficiency in his bright group too
[1:14:31] and that's why
[1:14:32] when he came the ephesians in the days
[1:14:35] of his bodily flesh
[1:14:36] after him was the efficient church and
[1:14:39] he
[1:14:39] is here there is going to be an
[1:14:41] efficiency we are promised there is
[1:14:42] going to be an efficiency to this also
[1:14:45] and an an efficient bride will also
[1:14:47] follow these efficient
[1:14:49] jesus christ that we saw in the prophet
[1:14:50] malachi 4.
[1:14:54] but we are promised according to
[1:14:56] revelation 10
[1:14:57] according to malachi 4 according to luke
[1:15:00] 22 17
[1:15:01] and so forth that there is to come an
[1:15:03] efficiency to this also
[1:15:06] there is promised it friends the most
[1:15:08] common efficience
[1:15:10] that these seven four mysteries of the
[1:15:13] word of god must be unfolded
[1:15:15] there it is the seven seals brings an
[1:15:17] ephesians
[1:15:19] the seven seeds the seven seeds of god
[1:15:22] creates
[1:15:23] in the people and ephesians
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:27] the ephesians jesus christ gives birth
[1:15:31] to
[1:15:31] the ephesians bread of jesus christ
[1:15:36] and it's the legion churches that it
[1:15:37] takes place i believe we're there
[1:15:40] i believe we are right in the shadows of
[1:15:42] the coming of the son of god
[1:15:44] and as joshua just before the ephesians
[1:15:47] raised up
[1:15:48] so that john the baptist raised up just
[1:15:50] before the next official and we are
[1:15:52] promised
[1:15:52] another ephesians
[1:15:56] in malachi 4 in the bride
[1:16:00] jesus in malacca for the ephesians
[1:16:04] bringing on the ephesians
[1:16:08] in the bride it's predicted here in the
[1:16:10] scripture
[1:16:12] therefore i think we're living in the
[1:16:14] ephesians
[1:16:15] again there it is it's telling you right
[1:16:17] plump and plain
[1:16:19] the ephesians is here jesus christ
[1:16:23] back again we are promised that what was
[1:16:26] left of
[1:16:26] during those seven church ages
[1:16:30] oh my
[1:16:34] here is here it is friends again
[1:16:37] what is ephesians the ephesians is the
[1:16:40] literal
[1:16:40] life of jesus christ living in human
[1:16:44] flesh
[1:16:45] the literal life of god like adam had
[1:16:48] the literal life of jesus christ like it
[1:16:51] was in the early breath the literal life
[1:16:53] of jesus christ
[1:16:54] like malachi for heart living
[1:16:58] in the believer exactly
[1:17:01] as adam had the early bright heart as
[1:17:03] malacca for demonstrating this age here
[1:17:05] the ephesians in this age
[1:17:12] and after jesus came it would have been
[1:17:14] a long efficient day
[1:17:16] because that's the purpose of god in
[1:17:18] redemption
[1:17:20] so that his sons and daughters will live
[1:17:23] and have his own life he let us make man
[1:17:25] in our image
[1:17:27] after our likeness so they'll be like us
[1:17:30] so they'll have our image on the inside
[1:17:32] of them so their behavior their life
[1:17:34] their ministry their works everything
[1:17:37] will be
[1:17:38] and reflect us we'll be god walking in
[1:17:41] human skin on the face of the earth
[1:17:43] that's what the original plan that was
[1:17:46] what god
[1:17:47] planned to do and when he brought the
[1:17:49] ephesians on in eden
[1:17:52] the perfect man if adam didn't fall
[1:17:55] the whole world would have been filled
[1:17:57] with perfect perfection
[1:18:00] but adam fell but god come right back
[1:18:02] down again the ephesians
[1:18:04] himself jesus christ came and he
[1:18:07] brought an efficient church right after
[1:18:10] him on the deal of pentecost the spirit
[1:18:11] of god come down
[1:18:12] and the fullness of the holy spirit was
[1:18:15] come in that
[1:18:16] age to anoint the word of god
[1:18:19] that he spoke into the souls and paul
[1:18:22] came on
[1:18:22] and put it on an unefficient church was
[1:18:26] birthed
[1:18:27] through the first church age but then
[1:18:30] they fell again
[1:18:33] and the seven church ages instead of
[1:18:34] being an efficient church
[1:18:36] you saw the trail of the serpent trying
[1:18:39] to do
[1:18:40] uh damage to the work of god through
[1:18:42] those seven church ages
[1:18:44] so the efficiency is connected
[1:18:48] in all the ages the efficient is what
[1:18:52] god
[1:18:52] wants to bring all of his children into
[1:18:55] as a matter of fact
[1:18:56] when all of god's children go back into
[1:18:59] that
[1:18:59] great eternity that's going to be
[1:19:01] efficient perfect perfection
[1:19:03] that can never fail
[1:19:06] so there's a connection between the
[1:19:09] seven seals
[1:19:10] which is jesus christ there's a
[1:19:12] connection between the seven church ages
[1:19:16] and the seven seals and ephesians
[1:19:19] and perfection and eden
[1:19:22] and this connection is the story
[1:19:25] of the whole bible oh glory to god amen
[1:19:32] and the book of revelation holds
[1:19:35] the key to unveiling and untying
[1:19:40] this connection
[1:19:43] between all of these elements
[1:19:47] the seven church ages the seven seals
[1:19:51] efficience glory land the gun of eden
[1:20:02] now
[1:20:05] malacca for knew all of this thing
[1:20:07] because he taught us these things
[1:20:10] and he knew you must you need to
[1:20:12] understand the connection
[1:20:14] between the church ages and the seven
[1:20:16] seals
[1:20:18] because when you understand that the
[1:20:20] whole gospel story comes into
[1:20:23] clear context for you and i
[1:20:28] only that prophet was the one that was
[1:20:30] able to go into the man of god to bring
[1:20:33] down this connection
[1:20:34] for you and i but message people
[1:20:38] the message becomes very common to us
[1:20:40] sometimes and we
[1:20:43] tend not to value like we ought to but
[1:20:45] these are glorious truths rashford from
[1:20:47] the mind of god
[1:20:48] the prophet going to the man of god with
[1:20:50] a gift of knowledge to bring down
[1:20:52] not that the god is saying any new thing
[1:20:54] for today but the things that god has
[1:20:56] spoken
[1:20:57] before the foundation of the world for
[1:20:58] this day the prophet goes up and brings
[1:21:00] them down
[1:21:01] and makes them present tense for you and
[1:21:03] i
[1:21:05] so malakai for he let us understand
[1:21:09] there's a connection between the seven
[1:21:10] churches and the seven series when you
[1:21:12] get that
[1:21:13] you understand god's program got
[1:21:15] planning redemption for
[1:21:17] all his children of all the ages from
[1:21:18] eden right back to eden again
[1:21:21] and so in his ministry
[1:21:24] if you notice 1960 he it it
[1:21:28] he he preached on uh uh the seven
[1:21:30] churches which we call
[1:21:32] the revelation series the relation of
[1:21:33] jesus christ he put on the revelation
[1:21:35] series and when he finished
[1:21:36] he moved on to revelation 4
[1:21:39] revelation 5. he was trying and he said
[1:21:42] we're going to go on to the seals
[1:21:44] he was trying to show you the connection
[1:21:46] there
[1:21:47] but he didn't get into the city because
[1:21:48] the tabernacle wasn't in a condition
[1:21:50] to be able to take a ladmin like the
[1:21:52] sales world the
[1:21:53] revealing of the seals will take and if
[1:21:56] you notice when he came right back 1963
[1:21:59] to preach on the seventh season he went
[1:22:00] through the same pattern
[1:22:02] because he appeared in seven churches he
[1:22:04] saw where he left off he was
[1:22:06] what he was going to do he preached
[1:22:07] seventeen years and was gonna connect to
[1:22:08] the seven seals
[1:22:10] and he appeared revelation 4 revelation
[1:22:11] 5 but he didn't go on
[1:22:14] so when he came right back he started
[1:22:16] off
[1:22:17] on the revolution of the seven seals
[1:22:18] right where he left off
[1:22:21] he put the message god in simplicity
[1:22:24] which was a dedication of savage showing
[1:22:25] us the simplicity of god how god comes
[1:22:28] right down
[1:22:28] the spirit of god breaks down and
[1:22:30] becomes the word of god so that you and
[1:22:32] i can understand and appreciate the
[1:22:33] things god is telling us
[1:22:35] but then what is he moved on right into
[1:22:37] revelation 5
[1:22:38] where he left off and called it the
[1:22:41] bridge between the seven church edges
[1:22:43] and the seven seals he was connecting
[1:22:46] you
[1:22:46] right back to what he was telling you
[1:22:48] there's a connection there
[1:22:51] when you understand the connection
[1:22:53] between seven churches and seven seals
[1:22:55] the whole redemption plan opens up to
[1:22:57] you and malaca
[1:22:58] already unveiled that by his message
[1:23:01] over seven sales and the seven thunders
[1:23:06] so there's a connection there the seven
[1:23:09] seals
[1:23:10] seven church i mean seven church ages
[1:23:13] the seven series
[1:23:14] that's what malaca was trying to show
[1:23:16] you and that's what
[1:23:17] he showed you and i on the seals because
[1:23:20] he was telling you
[1:23:21] in so many words that you need to
[1:23:23] understand this connection with the
[1:23:25] church ages
[1:23:28] or you will not be able to understand
[1:23:31] the essence of what's coming in these
[1:23:33] seals
[1:23:34] many people see the eruption of the
[1:23:36] series as one horse rider
[1:23:38] towards writer third rather i know it's
[1:23:41] deeper than that
[1:23:43] and malachi 4 let us understand the
[1:23:46] secret
[1:23:47] veiled in here in the bridge
[1:23:52] now i taught us revelation 1 1 to 20
[1:23:56] uh was preparation for the seven church
[1:23:59] ages
[1:24:00] uh chapters two and chapter three were
[1:24:03] the seven church ages
[1:24:05] revelation chapter four was the rapture
[1:24:08] come up either the narration chapter
[1:24:11] five
[1:24:12] was the breach which was the preparation
[1:24:15] for the opening of this
[1:24:17] of the seals it was literally saying you
[1:24:20] need to understand this connection here
[1:24:23] between the church ages and the seers
[1:24:27] between all these sins in the old
[1:24:29] testament and all these things
[1:24:31] in the new testament church age who have
[1:24:33] gone on before on this
[1:24:35] age there's a connection there to
[1:24:37] connect every one of those edges to the
[1:24:39] seven seals
[1:24:43] and revelation 5 the bridge holds the
[1:24:46] secret
[1:24:47] to this connection between all of these
[1:24:49] elements
[1:24:50] the seven church edges the seven seals
[1:24:53] ephesians
[1:24:54] glory land all the central medium back
[1:24:56] to eden
[1:24:58] the bridge holds the secret
[1:25:01] of the connection between all of these
[1:25:05] elements in our redemption
[1:25:08] now revelation 5 normally we call it the
[1:25:12] bridge
[1:25:13] but what is that a bridge is a gap
[1:25:17] revision 5 is the bridge that bridges
[1:25:19] over the bridge
[1:25:21] the gap the original 5 is not the gap
[1:25:23] rotation 5
[1:25:24] is the revelation that will take you
[1:25:27] over that causing that
[1:25:29] that that gap between that gap in your
[1:25:32] understanding
[1:25:33] your understanding your revelation on
[1:25:36] the connection between the seven church
[1:25:38] edges and this
[1:25:39] and efficiency and the seven seals
[1:25:42] because the seven c is what's going to
[1:25:44] take you into
[1:25:46] that eternal church age at the end of
[1:25:47] the season
[1:25:50] and you got to understand the connection
[1:25:53] so malacca let us understand this thing
[1:25:56] so what's in revelation 5 here
[1:25:58] quickly as we are running down
[1:26:00] revelation 5 you find the lamb
[1:26:02] you find the lion the book
[1:26:06] version 5 open
[1:26:13] a crown went out who is worthy to take
[1:26:15] the book and to lose the seven seals
[1:26:17] thereof
[1:26:18] and i got to understand john all the
[1:26:20] elders that they
[1:26:21] understood what was going on here they
[1:26:23] understood exactly
[1:26:25] what was going on many church people
[1:26:27] don't have a clue
[1:26:28] what's going on well thank god for the
[1:26:31] prophet malachi 4
[1:26:33] we understand by the grace of god not
[1:26:36] we no no the prophet of malachi 4
[1:26:39] brought a message that let us
[1:26:40] understand all these things that were
[1:26:42] going on there
[1:26:44] and we were represented by john so we
[1:26:46] understand what's going on
[1:26:47] my everyone what was john crying about
[1:26:50] you'll understand what was kind of about
[1:26:51] malachi photos
[1:26:53] but we don't understand what he was
[1:26:54] going about
[1:26:56] so revelation 5 the crowd wanted who is
[1:26:59] worthy to take the book
[1:27:01] and to lose the seven sales thereof
[1:27:05] so you understand right away this is the
[1:27:06] call here for losing sales so that
[1:27:09] what so that we can have an efficiency
[1:27:11] lose the seals unveil this is openly
[1:27:14] sealed
[1:27:14] so we can have a perfect man a
[1:27:17] perfect bride a perfect people on the
[1:27:20] face of the earth again
[1:27:21] like adam and eve were in the garden of
[1:27:23] eden
[1:27:24] like the early church was that's what
[1:27:27] they only
[1:27:27] understood that call they understood
[1:27:30] that when the seas open
[1:27:32] it unveils ephesians when it sees the
[1:27:34] open it brings on a perfect man a
[1:27:36] perfect people a perfect bread and face
[1:27:38] of the earth when he says open
[1:27:39] it brings that a prophet uh uh uh
[1:27:42] uh uh uh uh people on the face of the
[1:27:45] earth
[1:27:49] so we find the crown went out
[1:27:53] and when the crown went out who is
[1:27:54] worthy to the book
[1:27:56] unknown man was found worthy and john
[1:27:59] wept you
[1:28:00] understand why you wept we're doomed
[1:28:03] we're not going to be able to go back to
[1:28:05] that perfect state we're not going to be
[1:28:06] able to go back to ephesians
[1:28:08] john had experienced it and he knew
[1:28:12] that's how the bread of god must be to
[1:28:16] go in to their home in the skies
[1:28:19] and so john wept john wept
[1:28:28] and the elder told him don't weep john
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:32] the elder who has been training the
[1:28:34] world from malaca
[1:28:36] don't weep john
[1:28:39] the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:28:42] the root and the offspring of david he
[1:28:45] hath prevailed he had overcome
[1:28:48] to take the book and to lose
[1:28:51] the seven sales thereof so that there
[1:28:54] will be an efficiency
[1:28:55] so there will be perfect people on the
[1:28:56] face of this there'll be another people
[1:28:58] on the face of the earth who under their
[1:28:59] mention
[1:29:00] will be the final voice to the final age
[1:29:05] and when the elder told him that john
[1:29:09] was glad and happy
[1:29:11] and he looked looking for the lion to
[1:29:14] come and take the book
[1:29:15] and open up the seals so that the
[1:29:18] revealing of the series the open of the
[1:29:20] seals one more time
[1:29:22] will bring on ephesians will bring down
[1:29:24] another efficiency will bring on
[1:29:26] redemption full total complete
[1:29:28] redemption
[1:29:29] on the face of the earth like it was on
[1:29:31] the day of pentecost
[1:29:33] he looked to see the lion come take the
[1:29:36] book
[1:29:37] and when he looked there came a lamb
[1:29:42] right straight from eternity you will
[1:29:45] not hear anybody tell you
[1:29:46] only malacca will tell you that
[1:29:49] that lump came all the way from eternity
[1:29:53] from the throne of intercession from the
[1:29:56] back paths of god's mind
[1:29:58] he came and entered into the picture
[1:30:02] and he walked and he destroyed the lamb
[1:30:05] the lamb
[1:30:07] having seven eyes and seven horns which
[1:30:10] are the seven spirits of god
[1:30:13] sent forth into all the earth these
[1:30:16] seven spirits
[1:30:17] have been sent forth into god's i
[1:30:20] have incentive all the earth from eden
[1:30:22] right now to eden again
[1:30:24] these seven spirits of the lamb have
[1:30:26] been
[1:30:27] how god has dealt with men from eden
[1:30:30] right back to eden again
[1:30:31] shannon falling to all the earth all the
[1:30:34] seven dispensations of man's
[1:30:36] history it has been these seven spirits
[1:30:40] that have been god's ways of
[1:30:43] dealing with man of relating interacting
[1:30:45] with men
[1:30:46] through seven church ages of
[1:30:49] man's existence on the face of this
[1:30:52] earth here
[1:30:55] and the lamb went and took the book out
[1:30:58] of the hand of him that set upon the
[1:31:00] throne
[1:31:00] the one on this one has the book in his
[1:31:03] hand
[1:31:04] and in his hand means ownership
[1:31:08] there's a difference between in the hand
[1:31:10] and
[1:31:11] on the right hand in the right hand and
[1:31:14] on the
[1:31:14] on the right hand means the authority
[1:31:18] the power i saw jesus standing on the
[1:31:21] right hand of god
[1:31:23] it means jesus with the authority and
[1:31:26] power of the
[1:31:27] almighty god but in the right hand
[1:31:30] means ownership i have the documents in
[1:31:33] my hand i
[1:31:34] own the documents in the right hand of
[1:31:37] him that sat on his own
[1:31:38] he went and took the book out of his
[1:31:40] hand who could this be
[1:31:43] who could this be it must be the same
[1:31:46] one
[1:31:47] the on the book the original owner of
[1:31:50] the book
[1:31:52] oh hallelujah but quickly
[1:31:56] what is the lamp represent the bible
[1:31:59] tells us
[1:32:00] the lamb was the seven
[1:32:04] spirits of god sent forth into all the
[1:32:06] earth
[1:32:08] into all seven dispensations of man's
[1:32:11] history
[1:32:12] into all seven ages of god's interaction
[1:32:16] and dealing with man
[1:32:18] and this seven these seven spirits this
[1:32:21] lamb
[1:32:21] represented the spirit of god the
[1:32:24] seventh
[1:32:25] the holy spirit of god the abstract
[1:32:30] from the beginning the book in the hand
[1:32:33] of the original owner was the title deed
[1:32:35] to earth to man's inheritance on the
[1:32:37] earth
[1:32:38] but he needed the abstract to search it
[1:32:41] all the way
[1:32:42] back to the very beginning
[1:32:46] you hear many people preach about the
[1:32:48] world the world the world
[1:32:50] and they do it very beautifully but
[1:32:52] without the abstract
[1:32:54] you are not going to get full total
[1:32:57] complete redemption
[1:32:59] on the face of the air because the seven
[1:33:00] seals come from
[1:33:02] way back on the back path of god's mind
[1:33:08] the seventh season just become a book
[1:33:11] you have to trace the book
[1:33:13] right back to his very origins and
[1:33:15] that's what the abstract that's what the
[1:33:17] lamb represents
[1:33:18] remains the abstract the holy spirit the
[1:33:21] abstract from the beginning
[1:33:23] that traces the book from the beginning
[1:33:27] trace the book way back to his very
[1:33:31] origins to his very foundations in
[1:33:33] elohim's mind
[1:33:35] and that's what makes this message
[1:33:36] different we preach justification just
[1:33:39] like everybody has the practice
[1:33:40] pentecostals preacher's question but we
[1:33:42] preach just question with the abstract
[1:33:44] searching
[1:33:45] your just nation all the way right back
[1:33:47] to the very origins of justification
[1:33:50] to where you know you never did it in
[1:33:52] the first place
[1:33:53] that's the difference same with
[1:33:55] sanctification
[1:33:56] but some of the holy ghost searching all
[1:33:59] the way
[1:34:00] back to where anything against you
[1:34:04] is cancelled to where you never did the
[1:34:06] first place to where
[1:34:08] you were with god you as old as god
[1:34:11] himself you are in god's genes
[1:34:14] the father jesus of god rested in you
[1:34:17] from way back before the function of the
[1:34:19] world only the abstract can take
[1:34:21] you to that place
[1:34:24] it's not just preaching the world the
[1:34:26] abstract will take you all the way back
[1:34:29] to that spot
[1:34:35] so the lamb represents the holy spirit
[1:34:38] the abstract from the beginning
[1:34:41] that goes all the way back to the
[1:34:42] origins that goes all the way back to
[1:34:44] the very foundations that goes all the
[1:34:46] way back
[1:34:49] to elohim's mind to search out these
[1:34:51] deep truths
[1:34:53] that's why you'll never hear these
[1:34:55] truths from anywhere else
[1:34:57] but from elijah's message the prophet
[1:35:01] malachi
[1:35:01] 4 because he is the only one that showed
[1:35:04] you the
[1:35:04] abstract the seven seals
[1:35:08] being such all the way back men
[1:35:10] completed seven seals
[1:35:12] um first fossil broke
[1:35:16] and a white house rider with no bu
[1:35:20] no hour they can say those things but
[1:35:22] the abstract must be there to search
[1:35:24] that revelation
[1:35:25] all the way right back into the minds of
[1:35:29] god
[1:35:29] and bring it to you
[1:35:33] as your message there's a difference
[1:35:36] friends
[1:35:37] i will get into it shortly all glory the
[1:35:42] seventh the
[1:35:43] the lamb represents the spirit of god to
[1:35:45] reveal
[1:35:46] to open to expand to take you right back
[1:35:50] to the very foundations of the war
[1:35:52] before the wars were ever formed before
[1:35:55] lucifer ever came into before angels
[1:35:57] were created
[1:35:58] where you were a part of god you are a
[1:36:01] jinn
[1:36:02] a seed gem in god before the foundation
[1:36:06] of the world
[1:36:07] the lamb represents the spirit of god to
[1:36:10] reveal
[1:36:10] to open the lamb represents the seven
[1:36:14] spirits of god
[1:36:16] which is the seven seals the lamb
[1:36:21] the seven spirits of god that came and
[1:36:23] took the book
[1:36:24] and opened the seals
[1:36:29] the lamb the seven spirits of god
[1:36:33] that opened up the seven seals
[1:36:38] what are we doing i've said revelation 5
[1:36:42] is where the secret is to tie all these
[1:36:44] things together
[1:36:45] the church ages seven church ages seven
[1:36:47] seals
[1:36:48] efficiency redemption the glory land the
[1:36:52] new jerusalem eden
[1:36:54] on the other side new jerusalem on the
[1:36:56] other side of jordan
[1:36:57] in the fields of eden where the tree of
[1:37:00] life is blooming again where the tree of
[1:37:02] life is
[1:37:03] is growing again
[1:37:06] revelation 5 the breach holds the key
[1:37:08] with revelation 5
[1:37:10] there's a bridge there's a gap in your
[1:37:12] understanding
[1:37:13] of the seven church edges how it's going
[1:37:16] back there's a gap in your understanding
[1:37:17] of so many things
[1:37:18] adam did they go to heaven they go to
[1:37:21] hell
[1:37:22] lot did they go to heaven they go to
[1:37:23] hell uh uh uh
[1:37:25] samson they go to heaven that's their
[1:37:26] bridge in your knowledge but
[1:37:28] malaka afros message such is all the way
[1:37:32] back to the man of god and gives you the
[1:37:34] real revelation
[1:37:35] the truth of these things so you'll know
[1:37:39] not guessing that it but straight from
[1:37:41] the man of god
[1:37:43] so we're talking about revelation 5 what
[1:37:46] were the things in revelation 5 so we
[1:37:47] can bring it together and tie it
[1:37:48] together for you
[1:37:49] number one celebration five is the thai
[1:37:51] block the diamond hitch
[1:37:55] is trying to tell you like that the
[1:37:58] rubbish is not a bridge
[1:37:59] it's a diamond hitch to connect over the
[1:38:02] bridge
[1:38:03] over the bridge over the gap version 5
[1:38:06] contains the understanding the
[1:38:08] revelation the teaching the deep mystery
[1:38:11] truths
[1:38:11] the bridges all of these things for you
[1:38:16] it's a diamond each that ties in the
[1:38:18] last part
[1:38:19] of the lyricion church age ties
[1:38:22] everything and ties it all in
[1:38:25] amen
[1:38:29] so we have in version five the lamp and
[1:38:32] we're just showing through
[1:38:33] all the things the lamb represent
[1:38:36] and then we have also the lion
[1:38:39] and the lion represents the spirit of
[1:38:42] judgment
[1:38:44] that smites the earth and the people
[1:38:46] that is going to smile the earth
[1:38:48] and the people after all the names in
[1:38:51] the book
[1:38:52] have received the seven seals and have
[1:38:54] come into ephesians
[1:38:57] the lamb the lion represents that the
[1:38:59] spirit of judgment that's going to
[1:39:00] obstruct the earth
[1:39:02] lest i come and smite the earth with the
[1:39:04] cross
[1:39:05] but before the time i'll send you elijah
[1:39:07] the prophet
[1:39:09] with a revelation of a seven seals
[1:39:12] to call you out to drive you back to the
[1:39:16] tree of life
[1:39:17] to drive you back into the tree of life
[1:39:20] so that you can by the revelation
[1:39:23] unveiling number seven sales to you
[1:39:26] taking you all the way back by the
[1:39:28] abstract to the title deed
[1:39:30] that you might be able to come to
[1:39:32] ephesians a perfect man
[1:39:34] standing on the face of the earth here
[1:39:36] and they are waiting on you and i
[1:39:37] because they're without us
[1:39:38] cannot be made perfect and that's what
[1:39:40] the seven churches have to do with it
[1:39:42] that's
[1:39:42] the connection there where the seven
[1:39:44] churches are connected in there
[1:39:47] the lion
[1:39:51] after the last name on the book after
[1:39:55] the last cedar god
[1:39:57] has received these seven seals and these
[1:39:59] seven secrets has ushered them into an
[1:40:01] efficient
[1:40:02] the seven series ephesians jesus christ
[1:40:06] veiled malacca fulvilling the world the
[1:40:09] mysteries of redemption that we have
[1:40:10] received
[1:40:11] after this has called you out and has
[1:40:14] anointed the last name on the book
[1:40:16] and ushered them into the same efficient
[1:40:19] age
[1:40:20] that eternal church age at the end of
[1:40:23] the seals
[1:40:25] after that then
[1:40:29] the lamb becomes a lion
[1:40:33] on the throne of intercession where the
[1:40:35] lamb came from
[1:40:39] changes and becomes the throne of
[1:40:41] judgment
[1:40:44] lest i come and smile after the course
[1:40:48] but i have a little space there a dam on
[1:40:50] a hitch there
[1:40:51] i'll send elijah the prophet into that
[1:40:54] little slot there
[1:40:57] oh my because after the last name
[1:41:02] has come into efficiency their
[1:41:04] redemption is over
[1:41:06] the mediterranean work is done and the
[1:41:09] savior of the lamb becomes
[1:41:11] the judge the savior of the lamb becomes
[1:41:13] the judge these seven
[1:41:14] spirits driving you to the tree of life
[1:41:17] becomes the judgment that god's gonna
[1:41:19] judge the world by
[1:41:21] so this message here these thunders and
[1:41:23] things
[1:41:24] lightening thunder's voices you are
[1:41:27] gonna understand then
[1:41:29] amen oh my the lamb and the lion is one
[1:41:34] on the same thing
[1:41:34] you know that so here is the lesson here
[1:41:38] here's
[1:41:38] here's here's the understanding that we
[1:41:41] need to understand here
[1:41:42] between because he said who's while you
[1:41:46] take the book
[1:41:47] and john wept and then i said the lion
[1:41:49] has been able to take the book so the
[1:41:50] lion is going to take the book
[1:41:51] but before the lion takes the book he
[1:41:54] has taps the lamp to
[1:41:55] take the book first
[1:42:00] so the lamb takes the book first and the
[1:42:02] lion is also going to take the book
[1:42:04] but between the time the lamb takes the
[1:42:07] book and the time the lion takes the
[1:42:09] book
[1:42:11] in between those two times in there you
[1:42:14] can slot in there the seven seal book
[1:42:17] you can sort in there the john and the
[1:42:20] elders worshipping
[1:42:22] you can slot in there the elders crying
[1:42:24] out
[1:42:25] we shall reign on the earth
[1:42:29] amen
[1:42:32] the elder said the lana prevailed
[1:42:36] to take the book but the lamb took the
[1:42:39] book so the lamb took the book well the
[1:42:40] lion is also going to take the book how
[1:42:43] the lamb is going to switch and become
[1:42:47] the lamb i mean the lion the savior is
[1:42:50] going to become the church
[1:42:52] the the spirit seven spirits of god
[1:42:55] that's driving you
[1:42:57] to the uh uh tree of life driving you
[1:42:59] into ephesians
[1:43:01] is gonna become the church to judge
[1:43:03] everyone that's
[1:43:04] outside glory to god
[1:43:08] but when the lion takes the book is
[1:43:10] judgmental
[1:43:11] so between these two times when the lamb
[1:43:14] takes the book and when the lion takes
[1:43:15] the book
[1:43:17] in between there are the seven seal book
[1:43:20] the opening of the seals
[1:43:22] the revealing of the seven series the
[1:43:25] mystery truth in the seven seals
[1:43:28] searching out going around looking for
[1:43:31] sons and daughters of god
[1:43:32] to drive them back to the tree of life
[1:43:35] and drive them back to the garden of
[1:43:36] eden
[1:43:37] drop them back to ephesians drive them
[1:43:39] back to a perfect man
[1:43:40] standing on the face of the earth
[1:43:44] between the lamb and the lion of the
[1:43:46] seven seal book between the lamb and the
[1:43:48] lion
[1:43:48] ah john and the elders worshipping what
[1:43:50] is that john
[1:43:52] the bride worshiping seeing the capstone
[1:43:56] coming on top of the pyramid where were
[1:43:58] you when the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:44:00] and the monsters sang together and
[1:44:02] malacca said you were there you
[1:44:04] shattered because you saw the capstone
[1:44:06] commit capping up the pyramid of your
[1:44:08] lives
[1:44:09] that's why john and the elders shouted
[1:44:13] wept i mean cried for joy
[1:44:16] and john said
[1:44:20] all creatures in heaven on the earth
[1:44:23] under the had had a
[1:44:24] john sharding crying rejoicing
[1:44:28] for the cap stone is coming to cup of
[1:44:31] the pyramid of my life
[1:44:32] by the revelation of the seven seals
[1:44:35] of redemption oh glory to god amen
[1:44:39] and no wonder the crowd are the others
[1:44:40] cried out
[1:44:42] thou hast beat us unto our god kings and
[1:44:44] priests
[1:44:46] and we shall reign on the earth
[1:44:50] they understood what it meant the seven
[1:44:53] seals when the seven seals opened
[1:44:55] then god's ready for the children of god
[1:44:58] the city of god to take the title deed
[1:45:00] back
[1:45:00] not jersey title did now they've had the
[1:45:03] title deed down through the edges
[1:45:06] notice the main age preaching the world
[1:45:08] preaching the word but
[1:45:10] tattle did such all the way back and
[1:45:13] that's why they abstract
[1:45:15] to the title deed the spirit that goes
[1:45:18] and searches the rings on the ancients
[1:45:20] of god
[1:45:20] and brings it to you here in the form of
[1:45:22] a message of the seven seals
[1:45:24] from that great elijah prophet of
[1:45:26] malachi 4
[1:45:28] oh my so the lamb took the book
[1:45:32] and the land is gonna take the book

[1:45:57] and the book is from before the
[1:45:59] definition of the war of malacca photos
[1:46:00] on the series different places
[1:46:02] the seventh seal book has its origins in
[1:46:05] the mind of god from the foundation of
[1:46:07] the world
[1:46:09] and the book was closed in the hands of
[1:46:12] the one that sat on the throne
[1:46:14] in his hands he was the original owner
[1:46:18] but this book was open at one time oh
[1:46:20] yes it was
[1:46:22] now let's quickly trace the origin of
[1:46:23] this book through the bible and then
[1:46:25] we'll close
[1:46:28] malachi 4 told us that this book here
[1:46:31] is a seven seal book of redemption you
[1:46:34] don't see that there he said is
[1:46:36] the book written within and on the
[1:46:38] backside sealed with seven seals
[1:46:40] closed closed up with seven seals but
[1:46:43] malacca fossa is the book of redemption
[1:46:44] and you understand that from what we've
[1:46:45] been saying tonight
[1:46:46] i mean we've been saying saying i mean
[1:46:48] uh these this morning
[1:46:51] malacca for also taught us that this
[1:46:54] book
[1:46:56] has its origins in the man of god before
[1:46:59] the foundation of the world
[1:47:01] where the redemption story was planned
[1:47:04] and
[1:47:04] actually affected don't
[1:47:07] pass present tense before the world
[1:47:11] was even formed the seven seals
[1:47:15] is based upon the finnish work of
[1:47:18] redemption not
[1:47:19] trying to be saved you always was you
[1:47:22] always were saved you always was a son
[1:47:24] you just come here to recognize it
[1:47:28] hallelujah oh my
[1:47:32] on the seven seals on the man of god
[1:47:35] seven seals seven spirits of god
[1:47:38] seven spirits of god send forth
[1:47:41] into all the earth from the man of god
[1:47:44] these seven spirits here
[1:47:46] come down in eden and we see him in the
[1:47:50] garden of eden the tree of life
[1:47:52] jesus christ in the garden of eden the
[1:47:55] seven seals himself the perfect one
[1:47:58] in the garden of eden
[1:48:01] the perfect one
[1:48:07] there he was the tree of life
[1:48:10] jesus christ the seven spirits of god
[1:48:14] sent fallen to all the earth but here he
[1:48:16] was amen
[1:48:17] and because he was there adam
[1:48:21] could maintain he created adam into a
[1:48:24] perfect state
[1:48:25] and because of the seven seals adam
[1:48:28] could stay in a perfect state the seven
[1:48:31] seals not only
[1:48:32] brought on the efficiency for adam it
[1:48:34] maintained adam
[1:48:35] in an efficient perfect state
[1:48:40] the tree of life was open god told him
[1:48:43] of the tree
[1:48:43] of both trees uh are everything in the
[1:48:46] garden you may eat
[1:48:47] you'll never find in the bible white
[1:48:49] ever said giving specific instructions
[1:48:51] instructions about the tree of life
[1:48:53] because open adam knew that
[1:48:54] he didn't say of the tree you may eat
[1:48:56] the tree of life no it's just
[1:48:58] of the tree of the knowledge of good and
[1:48:59] evil thou mayest not eat
[1:49:01] because the day you eat thereof that
[1:49:03] then you die but he never told him
[1:49:05] or the tree of life if not he was open
[1:49:07] to him he didn't have to tell him that
[1:49:13] the tree of life was the seven seals the
[1:49:16] tree of life was jesus christ the tree
[1:49:18] of life was the ephesians
[1:49:21] and it was by that that adam could live
[1:49:24] and maintain he said so adam knew
[1:49:25] he knew the importance of this tree he
[1:49:27] knew the importance of these seven seals
[1:49:29] he knew the importance
[1:49:30] of this efficiency he knew the important
[1:49:32] partners of this tree in the garden he
[1:49:34] knew it
[1:49:37] and by this seven sales
[1:49:41] book tree of life in eden adam lived in
[1:49:44] rulership
[1:49:44] dominion and authority on the face of
[1:49:48] the earth
[1:49:50] by this tree of life adam could exercise
[1:49:53] authority
[1:49:54] and ownership on the face of the earth
[1:49:57] and by the open book the tree was open
[1:50:00] to him you may eat
[1:50:02] it now tell that he was open and by that
[1:50:04] open book of the seven seals
[1:50:07] jesus christ in eden the tree of life
[1:50:10] brought on an ephesians
[1:50:12] a perfect man in the garden of eden
[1:50:16] hallelujah that book was opened in
[1:50:19] adam's hands the tree of love was opened
[1:50:21] to him the seven seals were opened to
[1:50:23] adam
[1:50:24] and by it he lived
[1:50:27] and experienced the life
[1:50:30] in ephesians a perfect man on the face
[1:50:34] of the earth
[1:50:38] book was open to adam triola was open to
[1:50:40] adam
[1:50:41] the mysteries of how to get into the
[1:50:44] life of god was open to adam
[1:50:47] how to keep the devil out was open to
[1:50:50] adam how to navigate between
[1:50:52] the two spirits in the garden of eden
[1:50:54] that's the story of the seven seals
[1:50:57] that's the story of the seven seals to
[1:51:00] such all the way
[1:51:01] back to the beginning and know so that
[1:51:03] you'll know how
[1:51:05] to be and how not to be so you'll know
[1:51:08] the
[1:51:08] essence of the gospel is to get the
[1:51:11] spirit of god in
[1:51:13] and the spirit of god coming in get the
[1:51:14] spirit of the devil out and know the
[1:51:16] truth of the
[1:51:17] enemy the trail of the serpent the two
[1:51:20] spirits walking within the framework
[1:51:22] of a christian church those two
[1:51:24] influences on the face of the earth
[1:51:26] today
[1:51:27] i don't know that that's why adam was
[1:51:28] not deceived
[1:51:32] amen
[1:51:34] but when adam sinned you know the story
[1:51:38] wouldn't have to go over that he lo he
[1:51:40] lost his access to the book
[1:51:42] in other words the book became a close
[1:51:44] book to him
[1:51:46] and the book remain closed and went back
[1:51:49] to the hands of original owner
[1:51:51] and that book remained closed and that's
[1:51:54] why we find the book in the hands of
[1:51:55] region owner in revelation 5
[1:51:57] closed book still within and on the back
[1:52:00] side
[1:52:02] written within and sealed on the
[1:52:04] backside
[1:52:05] with seven seals genesis 3 verses 21-24
[1:52:09] details how the book became close to
[1:52:12] adam
[1:52:13] and went back into the hands of the
[1:52:16] original owner
[1:52:17] it was it became a closed book an
[1:52:19] otherwise open book before became a
[1:52:21] close book to adam
[1:52:22] it was close with caribbeans and a
[1:52:25] flaming sword
[1:52:27] and so so will the book remain closed
[1:52:30] all throughout the
[1:52:31] old testament years new testament years
[1:52:34] unt
[1:52:35] till revelation 5 when the crime went
[1:52:38] out
[1:52:40] who was worthy to take the book and to
[1:52:42] open
[1:52:43] the series to guide the way back to the
[1:52:46] tree of life so that we can go back to
[1:52:48] them so that we can go back to ephesians
[1:52:51] who is worthy and so the book remains
[1:52:53] closed
[1:52:55] all those years oh my
[1:52:58] so genesis 3 verse 21 to 24 we see the
[1:53:01] book
[1:53:02] was closed until revelation chapter 5.
[1:53:06] but down through the years god
[1:53:07] temporarily opened the book every now
[1:53:09] and then
[1:53:09] like open the book to elijah and he saw
[1:53:12] seven thousand names under there like
[1:53:14] i'm the only one god said no you are not
[1:53:16] open up the book and saw seven
[1:53:18] thousand names under there who had not
[1:53:19] defiled themselves with burial
[1:53:22] and jesus even when he came he opened
[1:53:24] the book temporarily he went to the
[1:53:25] temple
[1:53:26] he got the peace he was closed in the
[1:53:28] hands of the priest
[1:53:29] jesus took the book and opened it and
[1:53:32] found the place where it was written he
[1:53:33] picked out a promise for that day
[1:53:35] the spirit of the lord is upon me and
[1:53:38] left the promise of judgment
[1:53:41] the day of vengeance of our god he left
[1:53:43] that off
[1:53:44] because he was the seven seals being
[1:53:46] unveiled to the people
[1:53:49] to bring them to ephesians which was
[1:53:51] coming on amen in that first church age
[1:53:54] he cut off from
[1:53:57] he did not go into the day of vengeance
[1:53:59] which is when the lion comes
[1:54:01] and takes the book hallelujah
[1:54:07] so god every now and then open up the
[1:54:10] book and close but the book remain
[1:54:11] closed
[1:54:12] effectively from genesis 3 21 24 until
[1:54:16] revelation 5. and you understand
[1:54:20] john and the elders understood these
[1:54:21] things and they knew if this book is not
[1:54:23] open
[1:54:24] we're not going back to eden if this
[1:54:25] book is not open we're going tribulation
[1:54:27] period
[1:54:28] because laodicea ends up in the
[1:54:30] tribulation period
[1:54:32] the only way you'll go a liberation
[1:54:34] period in this legion church age
[1:54:36] is that you go in revelation 4 1 into
[1:54:39] the rapture in the skies
[1:54:41] and the only thing that's going to take
[1:54:42] you go there is
[1:54:45] the seven seals bringing you into
[1:54:47] ephesians
[1:54:48] and efficient is the bridge the bridges
[1:54:52] between denominations
[1:54:53] and glory land and that's why john wept
[1:54:56] he knew if if the book wasn't opened
[1:55:00] he was in the tribulation period already
[1:55:03] where the fairness of the wrath of god
[1:55:05] will be putted upon all mankind
[1:55:10] but even though the book was closed
[1:55:13] what that book represented god
[1:55:17] throughout the old testament years
[1:55:19] demonstrated and depicted that
[1:55:22] in his relationship with the children of
[1:55:23] israel the hebrew children which one of
[1:55:25] the hebrews
[1:55:26] because adam was god's first born son on
[1:55:29] the face of the earth
[1:55:30] jesus christ came he was the first
[1:55:32] person he is the
[1:55:33] original son of god the firstborn son
[1:55:36] and every one of us is the firstborn son
[1:55:39] because
[1:55:40] we are born direct from god we are not
[1:55:42] born
[1:55:43] through another person we are born there
[1:55:45] from god so that's why
[1:55:46] paul calls it the general assembly of
[1:55:50] the first born
[1:55:51] every believer is a first born son
[1:55:55] so god to show the input of that book to
[1:56:00] his first born general assembly of his
[1:56:02] first born family
[1:56:03] where everybody is a frostbound son
[1:56:05] direct lineage from god
[1:56:12] he had israel the children of israel
[1:56:15] every frostbound son in the family every
[1:56:18] family
[1:56:19] had the birthright
[1:56:24] this birthright was representative of
[1:56:25] what adam had in the garden of eden adam
[1:56:28] was the firstborn son adam had
[1:56:29] inheritance adam had the birthright
[1:56:33] in the garden of eden
[1:56:37] and if you look at all just many years
[1:56:38] the birthright that every firstborn had
[1:56:40] considered of three things number one
[1:56:42] the birthright number two
[1:56:44] the priesthood every frostmonson
[1:56:48] accessed the authority of the priesthood
[1:56:50] in his family
[1:56:51] and number three the inheritance went to
[1:56:54] the first one
[1:56:57] let me say that again what the book
[1:57:00] represent to adam
[1:57:02] even though the book was closed god
[1:57:04] depicted all that
[1:57:05] in his dealings with the children of
[1:57:06] israel through the old testament years
[1:57:08] a shadow of redemption to show us what
[1:57:12] we are to have previewing for us
[1:57:16] to have given us the evidence of what we
[1:57:18] are going to have
[1:57:20] shadows of redemption and so
[1:57:23] every frostborn son had the birthright
[1:57:27] every firstborn son had uh uh uh the
[1:57:30] priesthood
[1:57:31] every firstborn son had the inheritance
[1:57:34] in the family
[1:57:37] put aside what adam had adam had eternal
[1:57:40] life
[1:57:41] fellowship with god and the inheritance
[1:57:43] in his eternal life
[1:57:44] what was it the birth weather every
[1:57:47] frost person had
[1:57:48] was the same equip equates with what
[1:57:51] adam had
[1:57:52] eternal life the birthright eternal life
[1:57:56] the priesthood the fellowship with god
[1:57:59] to go into the presence of
[1:58:00] god for fellowship for for for
[1:58:03] relationship with god
[1:58:06] and number three the inheritance the
[1:58:08] ownership rulership on the face of the
[1:58:10] earth
[1:58:11] god put all that together into the
[1:58:13] birthright for every firstborn son
[1:58:16] in israel a shadow of redemption
[1:58:24] and that's how i remained the side was
[1:58:27] until reuben jacob's first bounce on
[1:58:30] reuben sinned
[1:58:31] and lost that bathroom lost his bad god
[1:58:34] he went into his father's concubine
[1:58:37] and after reuben god split this
[1:58:41] birthright into three
[1:58:43] he no more gave it to every firstborn
[1:58:45] son no more
[1:58:46] he broke into three and how he do that
[1:58:50] he spilled and gave the birthright to
[1:58:51] joseph
[1:58:53] he split it and gave the priesthood to
[1:58:55] levi
[1:58:56] the levitical priesthood was born
[1:58:59] and he split it and gave the authority
[1:59:02] and inheritance and power to judah
[1:59:07] what was it who said besides what adam
[1:59:09] had
[1:59:11] the birthright was eternal life and
[1:59:13] joseph had that
[1:59:14] the priesthood was fellowship and levi
[1:59:18] had that
[1:59:18] to lead the people into the prince of
[1:59:20] god for fellowship
[1:59:21] and the authority and inheritance and
[1:59:23] the parent dominion
[1:59:25] ownership on the earth the inheritance
[1:59:28] that adam had judah had that
[1:59:33] when adam lost the book and he lost
[1:59:36] these three things
[1:59:37] god restored god slew a lamb that same
[1:59:41] lamb
[1:59:43] and restored back his eternal life
[1:59:46] in other words his birthright restored
[1:59:48] back his fellowship in other words his
[1:59:50] priesthood so he can come into the
[1:59:52] presence of god still and have
[1:59:53] fellowship with god
[1:59:55] but the inheritance that authority that
[1:59:58] rulership and dominion
[2:00:00] which went to judah was not restored
[2:00:03] that wasn't restored
[2:00:06] and god put that there for character
[2:00:09] formation to grow and mature to be
[2:00:12] a song that the father can trust with
[2:00:14] his power and authority
[2:00:17] to rule and and and be a king in the
[2:00:21] domain on the earth
[2:00:23] in the place of his father god that was
[2:00:25] not restored
[2:00:30] and that's why
[2:00:33] in genesis 49
[2:00:38] that all patriarch jacob prophet signed
[2:00:40] literally
[2:00:42] on judah his son the scepter shall not
[2:00:45] depart from judah
[2:00:46] until shallow come in other words
[2:00:51] when shallow comes back when it's coming
[2:00:54] shallow the lord jesus christ that's
[2:00:57] when the scepter of authority will be
[2:00:59] back again
[2:01:00] on the face of the earth john and the
[2:01:03] elders knew these things
[2:01:05] they knew these things they knew
[2:01:08] these things when they saw when they
[2:01:10] heard the and when
[2:01:11] when the john cried but when the elder
[2:01:14] told him the lion of the tribe of
[2:01:16] judah has prevailed john knew he is
[2:01:19] coming now with the scepter of authority
[2:01:22] hallelujah john knew
[2:01:26] amen the authority is coming back
[2:01:31] we had the birthright we've had the
[2:01:34] fellowship
[2:01:35] we've had the priesthood we've had the
[2:01:37] birthright but
[2:01:38] now we are going to have the kinship the
[2:01:40] authority the rulership
[2:01:42] dominion the inheritance on the earth
[2:01:44] and that's why john scream that's why
[2:01:46] the other scream
[2:01:48] you have made us unto our god kings and
[2:01:50] priests and we
[2:01:51] shall reign on the earth oh hallelujah

[2:02:07] right away we are going back to the tree
[2:02:08] of life we are going back to rulership
[2:02:09] to dominion to authority on the earth
[2:02:12] no wonder they cried out we shall reign
[2:02:15] on the earth and i say we shall reign on
[2:02:17] there the scepters come back
[2:02:19] authority by the opening of the seven
[2:02:21] seals they knew right away
[2:02:23] right away they knew right away the book
[2:02:26] was going to be
[2:02:26] open once more like it was open to adam
[2:02:31] they knew what adam could not why
[2:02:34] couldn't get back to that
[2:02:35] tree was because the scepter of
[2:02:38] authority
[2:02:39] was removed from him but once they saw
[2:02:42] this after coming back they knew right
[2:02:44] away
[2:02:44] the book is going to be open oh my
[2:02:48] the new writer with the seven seal book
[2:02:50] closing the hand of the
[2:02:52] original owner is the same seven seal
[2:02:55] book from eden they knew that
[2:02:58] they understood the call who is willing
[2:03:01] to open the book
[2:03:02] and to lose the seven sales thereof they
[2:03:04] knew what it meant
[2:03:06] they knew what he meant this book here
[2:03:09] amen
[2:03:10] gonna take us back to fellowship i mean
[2:03:14] kill us by the eternal life such all the
[2:03:15] way

[2:03:19] mind
[2:03:19] fellowship right back into god's mind
[2:03:22] that's going to take us back to the
[2:03:24] inheritance in life
[2:03:26] search all the way back to god's mind to
[2:03:29] where this quarter can have nothing to
[2:03:32] do with it
[2:03:33] oh hallelujah glory to god
[2:03:36] oh my they know right away they
[2:03:39] understood
[2:03:40] and knew that the opening of the book
[2:03:43] would mean the restoration
[2:03:45] of eternal life would mean the
[2:03:47] restoration of
[2:03:48] fellowship would mean the relation of
[2:03:50] inheritance
[2:03:52] exactly as adam had it they know the
[2:03:55] opening of the seven seal book
[2:03:57] will produce and bring on another
[2:04:00] ephesians
[2:04:02] a perfect man with perfect holy ghost
[2:04:05] works
[2:04:07] as adam had before he felt by sin as the
[2:04:10] early bread had
[2:04:12] efficiency perfection perfect perfection
[2:04:16] that can never fail john and the elders
[2:04:19] know these things
[2:04:21] would happen when the lamb takes the
[2:04:23] book
[2:04:26] they saw a new when the lamb takes the
[2:04:28] book
[2:04:29] the seven seals will be open
[2:04:33] sons and daughters of god are going to
[2:04:34] be ushered into ephesians
[2:04:36] the servants is gonna break them the
[2:04:37] seven seals jesus christ himself
[2:04:39] is gonna break them into ephesians by
[2:04:42] the seven
[2:04:43] seals there are being officials like
[2:04:45] he's in ephesians
[2:04:50] reigning on the earth they knew these
[2:04:53] things
[2:04:54] oh hallelujah so they knew
[2:04:58] that that's going to happen with that
[2:05:01] all that has to happen before
[2:05:03] the lion takes the book so here's the
[2:05:07] lesson today
[2:05:08] we know from allah careful like i said
[2:05:11] before that when the lands take the
[2:05:13] then the lamb takes the book
[2:05:17] all these things that have happened when
[2:05:20] the lion
[2:05:20] when the lamb took the book all of these
[2:05:22] things happened the seven seals opened
[2:05:25] the seven sails seven spirits driving
[2:05:27] sons and daughters to go back to the
[2:05:28] tree of life
[2:05:30] when the lamb takes the book sons and
[2:05:32] daughters being ushered by the seven
[2:05:34] seals jesus christ who is ephesians
[2:05:36] himself they have been ushered into
[2:05:37] ephesians
[2:05:39] perfection a perfect man standing on the
[2:05:42] face of the earth
[2:05:43] doing it for all the other seven church
[2:05:45] areas that's gone on before
[2:05:47] because without us they cannot be made
[2:05:48] perfect all of these things happen and
[2:05:50] when the last
[2:05:51] name on the book is brought into
[2:05:54] ephesians
[2:05:56] that way
[2:05:59] then the lion takes the book the lamb
[2:06:02] becomes a lion and the only thing that
[2:06:04] is different
[2:06:05] is that judge intercession is over
[2:06:10] redemption is over there's no more drop
[2:06:12] of blood on the throne
[2:06:13] is now judgment time oh hallelujah
[2:06:18] when the lion takes the book
[2:06:21] only other thing that's added is
[2:06:23] intercession is over mercy is over
[2:06:25] judgment is here now is the land of
[2:06:28] judah time
[2:06:29] a judgment time with the scepter of
[2:06:32] authority to rule and reign with a rod
[2:06:35] of iron
[2:06:36] that's what it was that's what the elder
[2:06:39] announcer john
[2:06:41] is so close but before the time here
[2:06:44] come the grace of god the lamb stepped
[2:06:46] on the scene
[2:06:47] with the revelation of a lamb to take
[2:06:50] the book and break the seals and send
[2:06:52] the revelation down
[2:06:54] on the artery seventh oh my
[2:06:57] mama so when the lamb stepped fought and
[2:07:00] took the book first
[2:07:02] what is that that's not fixing the
[2:07:04] clothes
[2:07:05] what is that it represents the lamb
[2:07:09] and that lamb there represents a little
[2:07:13] space of time
[2:07:15] to drive the elect names on the book
[2:07:19] drag them back to the tree of life the
[2:07:22] same seven spirits that drove you away
[2:07:25] from the tree of life
[2:07:26] close the book to you like it was closed
[2:07:29] in the hands
[2:07:29] of the original owner raising fire the
[2:07:31] same seven angels
[2:07:33] seven spirits are driving you back to
[2:07:35] the tree of life now
[2:07:38] oh my you see how are the elected ones
[2:07:41] driven back to the tree of life
[2:07:42] they're driven back by the lamb because
[2:07:44] he opened the seas he took the book
[2:07:48] and the lion is waiting in the wings but
[2:07:50] the lamb takes the book
[2:07:52] and broke the revelation torsil
[2:07:55] after seal the seal is the spirit of god
[2:07:58] he said the book was written within
[2:08:01] writing was within on the backside there
[2:08:03] was no writing it was a seal on the
[2:08:05] backside
[2:08:06] the seal is the spirit of god the seal
[2:08:09] is the spirit to anoint the world
[2:08:12] the lamb broke the seals
[2:08:17] so how the elected one driven
[2:08:20] back the tree of life they are driven by
[2:08:22] the lamb
[2:08:24] who is the lamb we said it before the
[2:08:27] bible tells us that version 5
[2:08:29] who is the lamb the lamb is the seven
[2:08:30] species of god from before the
[2:08:32] foundation of the world
[2:08:34] the lamb is the seven spirits of god
[2:08:37] from the origins
[2:08:38] the very beginning the lamb is the
[2:08:40] abstract
[2:08:42] that goes all the spirit of god that
[2:08:43] goes all the way
[2:08:45] back to the man of god
[2:08:49] and from the man of god breaks open and
[2:08:52] reveals this series to you
[2:08:55] so when all these guys say brother
[2:08:56] branham took what what
[2:08:58] uh um mr lakin said about the sales and
[2:09:01] all that
[2:09:02] but abram said he read what those guys
[2:09:04] had to say
[2:09:06] and the angel came down every single
[2:09:09] day with the abstract the tarot day to
[2:09:13] show him from the mind of god
[2:09:16] trace it all the way back to the man of
[2:09:19] god
[2:09:20] while showing him also tracing the
[2:09:22] origins of the enemy
[2:09:24] to his very very foundation to the very
[2:09:27] very beginnings
[2:09:30] the seventh sealed book of redemption
[2:09:34] and open up the seals the lamb of
[2:09:38] god driving you back open the seals to
[2:09:41] you
[2:09:43] he takes you all the way back to the
[2:09:46] very origins
[2:09:47] to the man of god he takes you way back
[2:09:51] because he's the abstract to the title
[2:09:54] the revelation five
[2:09:55] the book is written within like i said
[2:09:57] before and on the back side still with
[2:09:59] seven seals
[2:10:00] the book is written within that's words
[2:10:03] on the back side see with seven seals
[2:10:04] that spirit
[2:10:05] seals seven spirits on the backside
[2:10:09] the carabins in in the garden of eden

[2:10:19] spirits of god
[2:10:21] protecting the way of the tree of life
[2:10:24] oh hallelujah
[2:10:28] so the lamp the seven spirits that
[2:10:30] breaks the seals
[2:10:32] is the same one that closed and sealed
[2:10:35] up the book
[2:10:36] with seven seals on the backside in eden
[2:10:41] on the eastern side in the eastern side
[2:10:44] of your bible
[2:10:45] is the back of the book and the
[2:10:48] angels the holy spirit
[2:10:51] the seven spirits of god closed up the
[2:10:55] book
[2:10:56] amen in eden and he's the same one
[2:11:00] that comes right back from the origins
[2:11:04] as the abstract to the title did to open
[2:11:07] up
[2:11:08] the seven seals in opening the seals
[2:11:11] in opening these seven seals he comes

[2:13:02] that's what it does
[2:13:03] that's the difference that is right

[2:16:41] making you lose all your fear knowing
[2:16:43] that is already done
[2:16:44] the pyramid already the pyramid of your
[2:16:47] life was already capped off by the
[2:16:48] capstone
[2:16:49] way before the definition of the world
[2:16:51] in elohim's mind
[2:16:53] you have finished complete work you're
[2:16:56] only here
[2:16:57] and god's gonna manifest all of that so
[2:17:00] bring you to a perfect man another
[2:17:02] efficient as adam was
[2:17:04] in the garden of eden and bringing you
[2:17:06] to your inheritance
[2:17:08] in life that adam lost
[2:17:12] but which was not restored back to him
[2:17:15] but which the lion of the tribe of judah
[2:17:18] and that's why when
[2:17:19] the last name on the book is
[2:17:23] redeemed and the lamb becomes a lion
[2:17:27] and the door is shut that's when you're
[2:17:28] going to see the power of god
[2:17:31] really strike this church and you are
[2:17:33] going to see
[2:17:34] for about 30 40 days you are going to
[2:17:36] see absolute power
[2:17:40] like the wall has never seen before when
[2:17:42] the door is
[2:17:43] shut that's when you are going to see
[2:17:46] the fullness of the power
[2:17:47] as they get adopted get adopted the
[2:17:49] power is there spoken with power
[2:17:51] but when the door is shut and the lion
[2:17:54] comes right
[2:17:55] back with the book the deceptive
[2:17:58] authority back in judah's hand
[2:17:59] shallow has come now you are going to
[2:18:03] see
[2:18:04] the full display of the power of god but
[2:18:07] the venom said
[2:18:08] when the squeeze comes then
[2:18:12] you are going to see that's when the
[2:18:13] door is shut you are going to see that
[2:18:15] which you have seen in me
[2:18:17] manifested in the fullness of its power
[2:18:20] because the lamp has become the lion and
[2:18:24] when the land comes along comes the
[2:18:25] deceptive authority
[2:18:28] amen the lion of the tribe of judah with
[2:18:30] the scepter of authority that shall not
[2:18:32] depart from judah
[2:18:33] he has it now on the fullness of the
[2:18:36] power of the living
[2:18:38] god will be unveiling his church that's
[2:18:41] why we
[2:18:42] know that the power of god is in this
[2:18:44] church
[2:18:45] that's why we know the blood of jesus
[2:18:47] christ has access even right now to the
[2:18:49] power of the living god that's why we
[2:18:51] pray for the sick we cast our devils
[2:18:53] amen that's what whatever it is the
[2:18:56] power of the living
[2:18:57] god because it searched all the way to
[2:18:59] the
[2:19:01] origins by the abstract to where the
[2:19:03] devil don't have authority over to where
[2:19:05] is the finished work your salvation your
[2:19:08] healing your deliverance your joy is the
[2:19:10] finished work
[2:19:11] and the devil cannot put a finger on you
[2:19:15] oh hallelujah all this because the seven
[2:19:18] seals of redemption
[2:19:19] have been unfolded to you to bring you
[2:19:21] to another ephesians
[2:19:22] a perfect man standing on the face of
[2:19:24] the earth oh
[2:19:26] hallelujah saw the seven seals
[2:19:30] amen the lamb driving you back to that
[2:19:33] inheritance
[2:19:35] that adam lost but which has now been
[2:19:37] restored
[2:19:38] by the revealing of the seven seals
[2:19:42] to this end time bride oh my bringing
[2:19:48] you
[2:19:48] to ephesians a perfect man standing
[2:19:53] in all of his glory that's what you
[2:19:55] potentially are right now because the
[2:19:57] seals have been revealed
[2:19:59] they have been revealed he's not going
[2:20:01] to come into monica
[2:20:02] but he's there oh man that's why i said
[2:20:06] go to the angel
[2:20:09] amen say give me the little book give me
[2:20:12] the book
[2:20:14] take me all the way back to the man of
[2:20:16] god take me all the way
[2:20:17] back amen where are the incumbents
[2:20:19] against me it's canceled out
[2:20:21] take me all the way back to amen these
[2:20:23] great truths
[2:20:24] are their very origins that's the power
[2:20:27] that's in this world here
[2:20:28] over seven sails from malacca for the
[2:20:31] great elijah prophet
[2:20:32] that god sent was the message of
[2:20:34] redemption the seven seas of redemption
[2:20:36] i'm bringing to you in our full
[2:20:38] total complete redemption bringing to
[2:20:41] ephesians
[2:20:41] a perfect man stand on the earth in all
[2:20:44] of his glory life of his life born of
[2:20:46] his own spirit of his spirit
[2:20:48] works of his works oh my
[2:20:53] already closed here since the opening of
[2:20:55] the seven seals this is the opening of
[2:20:58] seven seals
[2:21:00] god has raised the mud gate the title
[2:21:02] did to the earth
[2:21:03] released and the abstract the title deed
[2:21:08] that takes you all the way back to your
[2:21:09] inheritance has
[2:21:11] already been poured out also
[2:21:14] has packed that message overseas into
[2:21:17] your soul
[2:21:20] to bring you to ephesians like adam had
[2:21:24] to bring you to efficiency like the
[2:21:26] early brad hatch
[2:21:27] on the seven seals brings on another
[2:21:31] efficient a perfect man fully totally
[2:21:35] completely redeemed on the face of
[2:21:37] theirs only waiting for one thing
[2:21:39] you get ready and go to the angel give
[2:21:42] me the book and the angel gives you the
[2:21:45] book
[2:21:47] when he gives you the book you this is
[2:21:48] all we said tonight you know what it
[2:21:50] means to give you the book
[2:21:51] he's driving you all the way back to the
[2:21:54] abstract that's why malachi first
[2:21:56] message
[2:21:57] is so is it is so strong on
[2:22:00] what happened before the foundation of
[2:22:02] the world what happened in elohim's mind
[2:22:04] it's the abstract of the title deed
[2:22:06] it's not the title deed they abstract
[2:22:08] the spirit of god the seven spirits of
[2:22:10] god taking you all the way
[2:22:11] back to the man of god none other
[2:22:14] message like it on the face of the earth
[2:22:16] to bring you to perfection to bring you
[2:22:18] to another ephesians
[2:22:20] to bring you across the bridge
[2:22:23] amen and when you understand this then
[2:22:26] you are going to be ready to go in the
[2:22:27] rapture in the skies
[2:22:29] because revelation 3 amen 14 to 22
[2:22:33] is the messenger and reverend four is
[2:22:35] the rapture
[2:22:36] and the black goes up in the rupture in
[2:22:38] the skies and ration four to nineteen
[2:22:40] is the tribulation period on the face of
[2:22:41] the earth if you don't go prohibition
[2:22:43] for
[2:22:43] your intuition period but you cannot go
[2:22:45] up into revelation for until revelation
[2:22:47] five
[2:22:48] is sucked in on direction 3 42 22
[2:22:51] and this message of redemption in the
[2:22:54] breach the thai block the diamond hitch
[2:22:57] the bridge over denominations
[2:23:00] is anointed into your soul and the seven
[2:23:03] seals
[2:23:05] amen will bring you into efficiency the
[2:23:06] perfect man and that's the bridge
[2:23:09] that bridges you from the end of
[2:23:11] laodicea denominations into glory land
[2:23:14] louisia denominations going into
[2:23:16] traditional period but you are breached
[2:23:18] over
[2:23:19] into eternity by the seven seals jesus
[2:23:22] christ veiled on the
[2:23:24] inside of you and that's gonna be
[2:23:27] your efficiency bridge to take you up in
[2:23:30] the rapture
[2:23:31] in the skies one final quote and i'm
[2:23:33] done
[2:23:35] brother branham here amen
[2:23:38] oh glory to god amen
[2:23:41] amen
[2:23:45] on a paradox january 17 1965
[2:23:49] brother braham said it is grace
[2:23:50] permitting it that will bring these
[2:23:52] people conscious of god
[2:23:54] he was there doing the discernment and
[2:23:56] all of that to show you the demons
[2:23:58] demonstrate to you the power
[2:24:00] the authority the rulership the dominion
[2:24:03] like adam demonstrated like the early
[2:24:04] bread heard never imagined the apostles
[2:24:07] of the power and the glory like malachi
[2:24:09] for heart
[2:24:10] because the seven seals in him brought
[2:24:12] him to ephesians
[2:24:15] and you have promised the same thing
[2:24:18] because jesus christ
[2:24:19] was the ephesians in him and jesus
[2:24:22] christ deficiencies in him
[2:24:23] amen he's driving you back to the tree
[2:24:26] of life by this message
[2:24:30] and when you get
[2:24:33] right there he said thou must prophesy
[2:24:36] again
[2:24:37] before many peoples nations and tongues
[2:24:39] and kings
[2:24:40] you're going to prophesy how like the
[2:24:41] early bride did
[2:24:43] because the testimony of jesus is the
[2:24:45] spirit of prayer you're going to testify
[2:24:46] of jesus christ
[2:24:47] jesus christ the official is going to be
[2:24:49] built on the inside of you
[2:24:50] and they're going to see a perfect bride
[2:24:52] standing on the face of the earth
[2:24:54] amphibians you are in that efficiency
[2:24:56] then you have stepped onto the bridge
[2:24:58] you have stepped out of denominations
[2:25:00] leo this year in other words
[2:25:02] and you are ready to go into the rapture
[2:25:04] in the skies and lyricia slides on into
[2:25:06] the tribulation period that's why john
[2:25:08] cried
[2:25:09] if you don't get on that efficiency
[2:25:10] bridge you are not going in the rapture
[2:25:12] in disguise
[2:25:12] it's a tribulation period but thank god
[2:25:15] for a mighty prophet
[2:25:18] amen amen
[2:25:21] you serious grace permitting it a
[2:25:24] paradox
[2:25:25] that will bring these people conscious
[2:25:27] of god
[2:25:28] now not knowing nothing about you not
[2:25:31] even knowing you
[2:25:32] no way just a strange man that come here
[2:25:36] now it will be absolutely a paradox for
[2:25:38] something to happen
[2:25:39] to know what was wrong with you or
[2:25:42] something you had done or something you
[2:25:44] ought not to have done
[2:25:46] or something or who you are or something
[2:25:49] about you
[2:25:50] it will have to be a paradox because
[2:25:52] there is no way for anybody to know that
[2:25:55] asset or some revelation of the unseen
[2:25:58] that's right now if you'll do that for
[2:26:00] you
[2:26:01] between you and i so that the audience
[2:26:04] not as sure
[2:26:05] but that they might see the ephesians is
[2:26:08] here
[2:26:09] they might see the ephesus is here
[2:26:12] perfection perfection don't mean is the
[2:26:15] power of
[2:26:16] god in the church of the living god the
[2:26:19] spoken word power of god
[2:26:20] thus seeing the lord keep still that the
[2:26:23] man or the
[2:26:23] if ephesus is here that they might know
[2:26:26] that this is the thing
[2:26:27] the ephesus that bridges between
[2:26:30] denominations
[2:26:31] and glory land in other words bridges
[2:26:34] between
[2:26:35] leonisia and glory land that's how you
[2:26:38] get into a glory land that's how you get
[2:26:40] the glory and glory line
[2:26:42] eden on the other side of the rapture
[2:26:46] ethan is done on this side of the
[2:26:47] rapture eden is on the other side of the
[2:26:49] rapture
[2:26:51] so that they might know that this
[2:26:52] episode is the thing that bridges
[2:26:55] between denomination and glory land
[2:26:58] he promised their friends that they
[2:27:00] might be assured
[2:27:02] that what we are telling is the truth oh
[2:27:06] my
[2:27:06] revelation 5 who's the secret friends
[2:27:09] the key
[2:27:10] to tie up for you the connection between
[2:27:13] the seven church ages
[2:27:14] on the seven seals and the seven seals
[2:27:18] will put into you the spirit of god the
[2:27:20] seven
[2:27:21] spirits of god that that you might know
[2:27:24] like he said this message on teaching
[2:27:28] is to tell you and show you that man
[2:27:32] that redeemed man that's going to be in
[2:27:34] that eternal church age
[2:27:36] glory land at the end of the season but
[2:27:38] to get from the end of the seas
[2:27:40] to the end of it to that glory land you
[2:27:43] need to be on that bridge
[2:27:44] and ephesians is the bridge the seven
[2:27:46] seas is the bridge
[2:27:48] jesus christ is the bridge he is the
[2:27:50] ephesians
