[0:06] I believe it was Paul it said we are
[0:24] written epistles of God read of all man
[0:28] when you're on the street and when
[0:31] you're at your work and wherever you are
[0:35] somebody's watching you and especially
[0:38] after you have said a major confession
[0:41] that you are a Christian they'll watch
[0:44] you much closer than and that gives an
[0:48] influence to the people that's around
[0:51] about you and we should watch what we do
[0:55] because if we produce the wrong
[0:59] influence then we bring reproach not so
[1:02] much of on ourselves but of all what we
[1:05] claim to be Christian we bring it up on
[1:08] Christ and no one if we would think you
[1:11] would never want to bring reproach upon
[1:13] Christ but the wrong act at the wrong
[1:18] time or certainly cause the wrong
[1:21] reflection towards the first that's
[1:24] watching you and every body is watched
[1:27] when you profess to be a Christian
