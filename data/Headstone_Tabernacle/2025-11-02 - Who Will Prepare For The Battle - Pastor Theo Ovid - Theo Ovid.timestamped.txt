[1:00:06] Hallelujah. Well, I bring you greetings
[1:00:09] from India. And we had a a real
[1:00:12] tremendous time in the Lord. I preach
[1:00:15] four messages there. Making the
[1:00:18] prophetic vision of the end time plane,
[1:00:20] the open book of our redemptive rights,
[1:00:23] the finishing of the seventh seal, and
[1:00:26] another time of jubilee, then judgment.
[1:00:29] And for the very first service, the
[1:00:31] spirit broke through. It's quite
[1:00:32] something to see. Um they have the
[1:00:35] sisters on one side, brothers on one
[1:00:37] side and you know to see the spirit just
[1:00:39] broke through the from the very sur from
[1:00:42] the very service very first service was
[1:00:45] quite an experience and the people were
[1:00:48] expecting they got much more people than
[1:00:50] what they expected as far as from Nepal
[1:00:53] some people 3,000 miles away. It was a
[1:00:56] tremendous victory for the honor and
[1:00:58] glory of God and we thank God for that.
[1:01:00] [applause]
[1:01:01] I thank you for your prayer. I actually
[1:01:04] burnt out the translators. There was two
[1:01:06] of them. They had no voice when they
[1:01:07] finished. I had my voice, but those guys
[1:01:10] were burnt out. But um I wouldn't say I
[1:01:13] say this way. I felt strong like a ox
[1:01:15] when I was finished. [laughter]
[1:01:17] So I thank God. I know it's your prayers
[1:01:19] of the saints. You been prayer. I
[1:01:21] appreciate that. And um I have some
[1:01:24] other meetings ahead of me. uh flying
[1:01:26] out this uh uh Wednesday uh to to to
[1:01:30] France and then Germany and then Lagos
[1:01:32] and then to the Nigeria. So we have some
[1:01:34] some things ahead of us. So I trust then
[1:01:36] that the Lord you're being kept. I feel
[1:01:39] good to be here this morning.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; I feel good to be alive where I could
[1:01:44] give God praise and worship. And I'm
[1:01:47] looking to see the power of God break
[1:01:50] through
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; because the brother Brandham prophesied
[1:01:52] and say what we see should make a church
[1:01:54] that would make a revival that people
[1:01:57] would say something broke out
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; or we have been talking preaching
[1:02:00] sharing teaching for years but he's not
[1:02:02] talking about that he's talking about
[1:02:04] something breakout
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; hallelujah God is not going to leave the
[1:02:07] bride's tail you know we're not going to
[1:02:09] leave here ordinary you know bye-bye we
[1:02:11] leaving the neighbor it's not going to
[1:02:12] work so you know this bride will be on
[1:02:14] display God will display himself. Even
[1:02:17] if you do want it, God will point you
[1:02:19] out. This this here is my son. This here
[1:02:22] is my daughter.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; You and and you will know you. Don't
[1:02:25] touch God's anointed. Do his prophets no
[1:02:28] harm. Don't touch God's people. Don't
[1:02:30] interfere with them. Not in this hour.
[1:02:32] You wait too long to to face Satan in
[1:02:35] this battle. This end time bride is
[1:02:37] God's woman. This end time bride is a
[1:02:40] bride. The bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:02:43] Hallelujah. May not feel like that. It's
[1:02:44] not going by feelings. You're not going
[1:02:46] by emotions. And Lord, help me tonight.
[1:02:48] Praise God. This thing is certainly not
[1:02:50] your feelings and your emotions. This
[1:02:51] have to do with the word. There's the
[1:02:53] only way the bride will not be deceived
[1:02:55] because she is not going to be part of
[1:02:57] the word. She's going to be the word
[1:02:58] itself. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the
[1:03:00] house. Do you get that this morning? The
[1:03:02] only way the bride will not be deceived,
[1:03:04] she will be the word itself. The church
[1:03:06] is part of the word. The church believe
[1:03:08] part of the word, but the bride receive
[1:03:10] and believe all of the word. Oh, give
[1:03:12] the Lord some praises. That's the
[1:03:14] difference between the elected and the
[1:03:16] rest.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And this great battle we
[1:03:19] talking about is about to begin.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; I told him in in in Miami, war is
[1:03:23] coming. And I come to tell you this
[1:03:25] morning, war is coming.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Prepare for it.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to Jesus. Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; So, we're looking for what the Lord will
[1:03:32] do among us this morning. And there's a
[1:03:34] great thing to come and a great
[1:03:35] expectation.

[1:03:38] And you know after the meetings in in in
[1:03:41] um in in India the people have to head
[1:03:43] back to the trains, head back to the
[1:03:44] homes is quite a responsibility and you
[1:03:47] know it's different from what we might
[1:03:49] know convention wise. They have to feed
[1:03:51] the people. You have to come and they
[1:03:53] have to have the setup and everything
[1:03:54] else. It's not like you have to have
[1:03:56] everything just smooth and whatn not.
[1:03:57] They have to have set up. They have to
[1:03:59] plan for it and execute it well and to
[1:04:01] see how the Lord had worked so
[1:04:03] powerfully. I just just thankful to God
[1:04:05] for the experience of those brethren.
[1:04:07] This is the third time I'm going to the
[1:04:08] Punjab area
[1:04:10] that that particular place. So this
[1:04:13] morning I have one scripture to read for
[1:04:15] you as we stand. 1 Corinthians 14 we
[1:04:18] want to read from verse 1 to 8.
[1:04:22] 1 Corinthians 14 if you have Bibles
[1:04:24] verse 1 to8. Follow after charity and
[1:04:28] desire spiritual gifts but rather that
[1:04:30] you may prophesy. For he that speaketh
[1:04:33] in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto
[1:04:35] men, but unto God. For no man
[1:04:37] understandeth him, how be it in the
[1:04:39] spirit he speaketh mysteries. But he
[1:04:41] that prophesieth speaketh unto all men
[1:04:43] to edification and exhaltation and
[1:04:46] comfort. He that speaketh in an unknown
[1:04:48] tongue edified himself, but he that
[1:04:51] prophesied edified the church. I would
[1:04:53] that ye all speak with tongues, but
[1:04:55] rather that he prophesied. For greater
[1:04:57] is he that prophesieth than he that
[1:04:59] speaketh with tongues, except he
[1:05:01] interpret that the church may receive
[1:05:03] edifying. Now, brethren, if I come unto
[1:05:06] you speaking with tongues, what shall I
[1:05:07] profit you? Except I shall speak to you
[1:05:09] either by revelation or by knowledge or
[1:05:12] by prophesying or by doctrine. And even
[1:05:14] things without life giving sound,
[1:05:16] whether pipe or harped, except they give
[1:05:19] a distinction in the songs, how shall it
[1:05:22] be known what is piped or harped? But if
[1:05:25] the trumpet given and sitting sound, who
[1:05:27] shall prepare himself to the battle?
[1:05:29] Let's have a word of prayer. Heavenly
[1:05:30] Father, we thank you for your word. May
[1:05:32] you come among us and interpret it.
[1:05:33] Father, we living in dangerous time.
[1:05:36] We're living in a peculiar time. We live
[1:05:38] in a time Lord where your word is about
[1:05:40] to fulfill and manifest among your elect
[1:05:42] people. Grant Lord that the word made
[1:05:44] plain this morning to your people. In
[1:05:46] Jesus name I ask it. Amen. You may be
[1:05:47] seated. And as you sit down, give God
[1:05:49] some praises.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember, [cheering]
[1:05:56] when you come to church here, you come
[1:05:57] here to worship.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; You ain't come here sit down and just
[1:06:00] take notes or sit down. No, you're
[1:06:01] coming here to worship. Your number one
[1:06:04] job is to worship. That's how you fight
[1:06:05] this battle. That's part of the fighting
[1:06:07] of the battle. Praise God. You have to
[1:06:09] worship God. Praise your hand. Say amen.
[1:06:11] Say glory to God. Praise God. Just as
[1:06:14] people go to football and all. Yes. And
[1:06:15] the team and goal and whatn not. When
[1:06:17] you come here, you come here to praise
[1:06:18] God and worship. Your job is to worship.
[1:06:20] Your job is not to study your problems
[1:06:22] and your build and what going to happen
[1:06:23] tomorrow. No, you don't know if what you
[1:06:25] do now healing come to your house. If
[1:06:27] what you do now, deliverance come to
[1:06:29] your house. If what you do now,
[1:06:31] breakthrough come to your house. You do
[1:06:33] what you're supposed to do in the house
[1:06:34] of God. You do what you're supposed to
[1:06:36] do now. If your husband get in trouble,
[1:06:38] if your wife get in trouble, if your
[1:06:39] children give in trouble, whoever get in
[1:06:41] trouble, don't bother about that trouble
[1:06:42] this morning. You are here to worship
[1:06:44] God. Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[1:06:46] God could make a way. Hallelujah.
[1:06:49] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be
[1:06:51] seated. Praise God. That woman came to
[1:06:53] Jesus and and talking about my daughter
[1:06:55] is vex with the devil. The daughter was
[1:06:56] not there. She was standing there.
[1:06:58] Hallelujah. My daughter is vexed with
[1:06:59] the devil. He says not fit to take the
[1:07:01] children's bread and casting the door.
[1:07:02] She stood her grounds. She said I am
[1:07:04] moving. I ain't going nowhere. You have
[1:07:06] the answer to my problem. You could
[1:07:08] deliver. I know you have the power to
[1:07:10] deliver. You can give a breakthrough. I
[1:07:12] heard you open the Red Sea. I heard you
[1:07:14] because the blind eye to see. I heard
[1:07:16] YOU DID THIS, THAT, and the other. And
[1:07:17] if they could do it for them, they could
[1:07:18] do it for me. Well, give the Lord a
[1:07:20] praise this morning. That's the kind of
[1:07:21] attitude you want to have. If you do it
[1:07:23] for them, you could do it for me. If you
[1:07:24] do it for that brother, you could do it
[1:07:26] for me. If you do for that sister, you
[1:07:27] could do it for me. You could do it for
[1:07:28] my children. You could do it for my
[1:07:30] body. Oh, I heard YOU HEAL CANCER. YOU
[1:07:32] COULD HEAL CANCER THIS MORNING. I heard
[1:07:34] deliver from tumor and leukem from
[1:07:37] prison and from HEARTACHE AND FROM ALL
[1:07:39] KIND OF THINGS. I HEARD YOU'RE A
[1:07:40] DELIVERER. WELL, give the Lord a shout
[1:07:42] in the house. That's when you're
[1:07:44] claiming the promises. That's when
[1:07:45] you're believing what God have said.
[1:07:50] Glory.
[1:07:51] Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. You may
[1:07:54] be seated. You have to be willing to put
[1:07:56] your emotions off the line and put your
[1:07:59] belief and faith on the line and say,
[1:08:01] "God, you said so. You promised and you
[1:08:03] can't lie." If you said, "If I walk, you
[1:08:06] will bless. If I praise God," you
[1:08:07] understand what I'm saying? You're
[1:08:08] reminding God of what he promised. That
[1:08:10] is pleading the promise. God, you
[1:08:12] promise me victory. Fix you over the
[1:08:14] world. Fix you over the lust of the eyes
[1:08:16] and lust of the flesh and the pride of
[1:08:17] life. You promise me deliverance. You
[1:08:19] promise me a breakthrough. You promise I
[1:08:21] the Lord thy God THAT HEAL THEE. ARE YOU
[1:08:23] A HEALER? LORD, I'M SICK IN MY BODY AND
[1:08:26] I NEED A SUPERNATURAL TOUCH. LORD, I
[1:08:28] HAVE FIBROIDS. LORD, I HAVE THIS. I HAVE
[1:08:31] THAT. I have headache. I have female
[1:08:33] condition. WHATEVER CONDITION, I HAVE
[1:08:35] AIR. I'M NOT HEARING GOOD. I'M NOT
[1:08:36] SEEING GOOD. I have cataract. Whatever
[1:08:39] you have this morning, GOD TO BLOW IT
[1:08:41] OUT THE WATER. UH FINANCIAL TROUBLE, HE
[1:08:44] COULD DEAL WITH THAT TOO. That you could
[1:08:45] pay your taxes. He said go catch a fish.
[1:08:47] He could deal with that too. He could
[1:08:49] deal with whatever problem. BUT THERE'S
[1:08:51] LAWYER PROBLEM, DOCTOR PROBLEM, MONEY
[1:08:53] PROBLEM, FAMILY PROBLEM, WHATEVER
[1:08:56] PROBLEM, SCHOOL PROBLEM, [screaming]
[1:08:58] WHATEVER SITUATION IN YOUR LIFE, HE
[1:09:00] COULD DEAL WITH THAT THIS MORNING, NOT
[1:09:02] TOMORROW, THIS MORNING. BECAUSE NOW
[1:09:04] FAITH IS come to preach you out of your
[1:09:06] foolishness. We come to PREACH YOU OUT
[1:09:08] OF DARKNESS. WE COME TO PREACH YOU OUT
[1:09:09] THE UNBELIEF AND TO PREACH YOU INTO THE
[1:09:11] LIGHT. OH, THIS GOSPEL GOING TO BE
[1:09:14] PREACHED AND THEN THE END SHALL COME.
[1:09:16] OH, CAN THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE?
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN, brother Blackman. Now
[1:09:25] be seated.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; I didn't say it. Jesus said it. You
[1:09:29] shall hear wars and rules of wars,
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; but not yet.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; The end IS NOT YET. NATION SHALL RISE UP
[1:09:37] AGAINST NATION. NOT YET.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE SHALL BE PESTILENCES
[1:09:42] AND STORMS AND EARTHQUAKES. NOT YET. BUT
[1:09:45] THIS GOSPEL [screaming] SHALL BE
[1:09:47] PREACHED AND THEN THE END SHALL COME.
[1:09:50] OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME SHOUTS IN THE
[1:09:52] HOUSE.
[1:09:57] [cheering]
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; May be seated.
[1:10:00] [applause]
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Do you see how a man emotions could move
[1:10:11] him?
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; That president of America, anything that
[1:10:14] pass here, he see and what not he
[1:10:16] moving.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; He acting he here, he see
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; and they could show the wrong thing to
[1:10:20] him.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; God don't move by feelings and emotions.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; So day before yesterday when I hear
[1:10:27] about bombs going to fall just now and
[1:10:29] people all the gas station full up with
[1:10:31] cars and groceries. What foolish is
[1:10:33] this? We going inside. I want to get
[1:10:36] some gas for my vehicle. I could get see
[1:10:37] light and nothing that foolish you know.
[1:10:39] I going back home. Next morning I come
[1:10:41] there, it gets empty.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; People thinking all kind of think in the
[1:10:47] heading for
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; hearts feeling for fear.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; If the missile will come across here,
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; they don't know what kind of defense we
[1:11:00] have.
[1:11:01] What defense we have?
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; They don't know about our army. What
[1:11:05] army we have?
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; That's why we had to be underneath the
[1:11:09] blood. You know,
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; God have to be our protector.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; David said 10,000 fall on the right
[1:11:16] side.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; I shall not be. David say, "Oh God, I go
[1:11:20] hide."
[1:11:22] David say, "I'm going to duck." He said,
[1:11:24] "Oh, 10,000 fall on my right side. I
[1:11:25] shall not be moved."
[1:11:29] This this message people faith hasn't
[1:11:31] been challenged as yet. You know,
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; they have been sitting in benches and
[1:11:34] churches and thinking that it's bright
[1:11:36] thing for years includ
[1:11:41] lost his wife.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; He lost the anointing.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; He lost his baby.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; And he was a prophet. Amen.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; He was the floodsaving people and his
[1:11:57] family was dying.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; And he had to serve God still.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; And the devil coming to whisper in his
[1:12:02] ears, look at you.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; You're serving him all these years.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Your wife going to die, you know.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; He's praying for the sick and people are
[1:12:12] being healed.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; But his wife going to die, you know.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Daughter going to die, too.
[1:12:17] The devil whispering you see and he say
[1:12:20] he love you and he said see he say he
[1:12:22] with you
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; that devil not easy you know
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; pumping in the prophet ears and as he
[1:12:28] almost given something something b out
[1:12:31] of him
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; the Lord give and the Lord take it away
[1:12:37] blessed be the oh don't let the devil
[1:12:39] take your [music] praise
[1:12:41] DON'T LET DON'T LET THE DEVIL TAKE
[1:12:44] [screaming] YOUR PRAISE
[1:12:46] DO I HEAR A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE THIS
[1:12:48] MORNING? [cheering]
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK GOD DOESN'T KNOW THE PRESSURE
[1:12:54] YOU UNDER?
[1:12:56] [applause and cheering]
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK GOD DOESN'T KNOW THE STRESS
[1:12:59] YOU UNDER,
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; BUT YOUR feelings mustn't put ahead of
[1:13:03] God.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Put faith ahead of your feelings and
[1:13:07] give God praises because he is worthy of
[1:13:10] praise.
[1:13:17] How about say write the vision and make
[1:13:18] it plain. There's a reason for that.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; There's a reason when we have clarity.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; That is the that is why I say make it
[1:13:26] plain.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; When things are made plain, you could
[1:13:29] act. You could act decisively.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; You could act with purpose. Is when we
[1:13:35] are not sure, we get this. You know, I
[1:13:38] wonder if I wonder if God don't want a
[1:13:40] wondering.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; He want your mind to be clear.
[1:13:43] Hallelujah. Praise God. When God spoke
[1:13:45] to Joshua, Joshua instructed the elders
[1:13:48] and the whole congregation. 3 days we
[1:13:50] are crossing over.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Prepare yourselves.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; We are crossing Jordan.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Nice elders, nice brothers. Come and
[1:13:57] tell Joshua if you wait a month um the
[1:14:00] water will go down. He said three days.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Joshua know what going on? No.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; God told him three days
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; and he speak what God spoke.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Three days. The Levites with the ark on
[1:14:12] their shoulder. They know that to cross
[1:14:13] Jordan. They're not waiting for boat.
[1:14:16] They're not waiting for yacht or ship.
[1:14:19] They have to cross.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; They be hide. They have the ark in their
[1:14:22] hand and they walking towards Jordan.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; They don't know how it going to open,
[1:14:26] but they go in.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Do you do you understand what faith
[1:14:29] does?
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; If you're feeling fear, you would not
[1:14:32] go. THERE'S GUYS WALKING. AS SOON AS
[1:14:34] TOUCH JORDAN,
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Jordan open up. Some of you am moving.
[1:14:39] You're watching to see who raising their
[1:14:41] hands. DON'T WATCH NOBODY. YOU RAISE
[1:14:43] YOUR OWN HANDS. [cheering]
[1:14:46] Some of you looking to see who praising
[1:14:47] God. Don't watch nobody. Are you
[1:14:49] PRAISING GOD? YOU HAVE TO OPEN YOUR
[1:14:51] MOUTH for yourself. DON'T BE NO DUMB DOG
[1:14:54] in Israel.
[1:14:56] You have to open your mouth AND SPEAK.
[1:14:58] YOU HAVE TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND CLAIM.
[1:15:00] You have to open your mouth AND ASK, ASK

[1:15:21] IN THE HOUSE. [cheering]
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; I don't want to ask. I don't want to
[1:15:25] bother God. What kind of foolishness is
[1:15:27] that? You think God is a man?
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; How many you don't want to bother God?
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Let God remind God.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:15:47] UPON YOU.
[1:15:49] GOD, GIVE ME STRENGTH. GOD, HELP ME. OH

[1:16:26] TO DO. HALLELUJAH. HELP YOU BUST THAT

[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:38] [applause]
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; For if the trumpet given and sitting
[1:16:41] sound, who shall prepare himself for the
[1:16:44] battle? The question asked, who going to
[1:16:46] prepare the self?
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Church, remember the comfort that people
[1:16:49] some people don't like to change because
[1:16:50] they like themselves? They in love.
[1:16:52] Bible said that in the last days people
[1:16:54] shall be lovers of themselves. When they
[1:16:55] look in the mirror, I like me.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; I'm in love with me.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Bible talk about that.
[1:17:02] Because see if you hate yourself
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; you want to change
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; when you look you don't like what you
[1:17:09] see
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; but you see this is what you call the
[1:17:13] default position default status your
[1:17:16] normal status now we were born in sin in
[1:17:20] it
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; and shapen iniquity in it
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; no nonrighteous no not one
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; so when God called us out he called us
[1:17:28] out to infect and affect our lives Amen.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; That change could begin.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; You're not changing overnight,
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; but change could be to begin.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; A little light that could grow inside of
[1:17:41] you.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; As you allow it to grow.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying?
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; A LITTLE LIGHT TO COME INSIDE OF YOU.
[1:17:48] AND AS YOU ALLOW it to grow, it grows.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; The more you get rid of you, the more it
[1:17:52] expands.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; And you get more reflected of God
[1:17:56] through you and by you.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:18:00] Hallelujah. And we said and we said
[1:18:02] Friday that the battle didn't start on
[1:18:04] earth. It started in heaven.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; When Michael and Lucifer fought
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; And the battle dropped down upon the
[1:18:10] earth.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; And the battle of angels became the
[1:18:12] battle of men.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; So when you see Russia fighting this one
[1:18:14] and that one is spirits,
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; his demon powers, his principalities,
[1:18:18] his territorial spirits. I want your
[1:18:20] land. I want your property. And that's
[1:18:22] how the devil feel about you and about
[1:18:24] here on the earth. But earth wasn't made
[1:18:26] for the devil.
[1:18:28] Hell and fire was made for the devil and
[1:18:30] his angels. He got kicked out and he
[1:18:32] fell on the earth. But earth belong to
[1:18:34] the sons and daughters of God. And
[1:18:36] because Adam fell, an avenue opened up
[1:18:38] for demon powers to rage upon the earth.
[1:18:40] But God is raising up sons to take us
[1:18:42] back. We're going back to the original.
[1:18:45] We're going back to what God called us
[1:18:46] to do and raises up to do. We're going
[1:18:48] back because the book has been restored.
[1:18:50] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:18:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So the battle of
[1:18:54] angels had become the battle of men and
[1:18:56] the human mind was given for the battle
[1:18:58] to rage. So that's why you have
[1:19:00] thoughts. That's why thinking and
[1:19:02] thoughts and fighting and battles
[1:19:04] inside. Is that that mind of yours?
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? So the battle wrong is
[1:19:07] a human mind with five senses. Memory,
[1:19:09] affection, conscience, reason and
[1:19:12] imagination.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; A battle of fate, revelation versus
[1:19:17] reasoning from the mind.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Lucifer uses human reasoning.
[1:19:23] That is why when Sarah tell Abraham to
[1:19:26] go with Hagar, that was reasoning
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; because Sarah didn't believe for herself
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; because Sarah didn't have a revelation.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; And that what we see now is the results
[1:19:35] of unbelief
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; that we have a whole set of people
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; that different
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; and it's still family to Isaac.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Faith versus doubt.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Revelation versus reasoning. The
[1:19:50] greatest battle ever fought is going on
[1:19:52] right here, right now.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Between life and death, between sickness
[1:19:55] and health, between faith and doubt,
[1:19:57] between liberty and bondage. And Paul
[1:19:59] exhorted us to put on the whole armor of
[1:20:02] God.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let America do they do? They
[1:20:06] have to do they do. Who can make war
[1:20:08] with the beast?
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; And God take a pope out of America,
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; put him right in the Vatican.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; So they have an American man across the
[1:20:15] Vatican.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; He is the head of Rome. Yes.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; And Americano.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Now,
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Russia, I want to say this for the
[1:20:28] benefit of the veterans and so forth and
[1:20:30] you Bible students. What you fussing and
[1:20:32] hing about Russia? You don't hear me
[1:20:34] telling you to build bombshelter, do
[1:20:35] you? What are you fussing about Russia?
[1:20:38] Russia ain't nothing.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; They ain't going to win no wars.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; They ain't going to conquer no world.
[1:20:45] Communism isn't going to conquer no
[1:20:48] world.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; God's word can fail. Listen this on tape
[1:20:53] now to the world I speak. Wherever these
[1:20:55] tapes may go and to you people here, no
[1:20:57] matter what happens to me, you believe
[1:20:59] this. Russia, communism isn't going to
[1:21:02] conquer nothing. God's word can't fail.
[1:21:04] Romanism is going to conquer the world.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Romanism,
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; the spirit of Rome,
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; most powerful
[1:21:16] empire that was ever on the earth.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Built roads, armies, this thing called
[1:21:21] Rome. And Rome, physical Rome, switched
[1:21:23] to papa Rome.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; A lot of these big guys and
[1:21:26] billionaires, they are Roman Catholic.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; The spirit upon them.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Notice who is controlling the media.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Who's controlling WhatsApp, Tik Tok,
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; who's controlling all Facebook and all
[1:21:36] these things. It's the billionaires.
[1:21:38] There's not no man in his shop around
[1:21:39] the corner.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; They controlling technology.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; My god. And I just discovered a next
[1:21:45] company called Palanteer. Do you
[1:21:46] understand what they were doing? But
[1:21:48] they collecting information on
[1:21:49] everybody.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Not just in America, but around the
[1:21:52] whole world.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; This man, man called Peter Teal.
[1:21:57] H
[1:22:00] Satan.
[1:22:02] That's why they call it AI right now.
[1:22:03] Artificial intelligence. But the bride
[1:22:06] would not have artificial.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; The bride will have the intelligence of
[1:22:10] God.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Because to outdo these guys, you would
[1:22:13] need the intelligence of God, which is
[1:22:16] the mind of Christ.
[1:22:19] Give the Lord a shout in the house. Ride
[1:22:21] with me this morning. The prophet was
[1:22:24] the seer or the eyes. He said there was
[1:22:26] no moving faculty past the eyes. He said
[1:22:29] the next indeed is the intelligence
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; that God will reveal what to do with his
[1:22:34] word.
[1:22:36] Hallelujah.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; That is the intelligence.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; The intelligence is what led Jesus to
[1:22:41] pick up the scripture and say the spirit
[1:22:42] is upon me because he has anointed me to
[1:22:45] bring good tidings and so forth. Held
[1:22:47] open the eyes of the blind. The
[1:22:48] intelligence tell him move now and read
[1:22:51] the scripture. And then he said this day
[1:22:53] the scripture is fulfilling your ear.
[1:22:56] You're going to live to see it young
[1:22:57] people. You're going to live to see this
[1:22:59] word manifested. God will not leave this
[1:23:02] earth without a witness. God had TAKEN
[1:23:04] OUT THIS BRIDE WITHOUT A WITNESS. THERE
[1:23:05] HAS TO BE A CLEAR witness of this bride.
[1:23:08] The battle is about to begin. Oh, glory
[1:23:11] to God. You see the rise of the false
[1:23:13] anointed yet. YOU SEE CHURCH MEMBERS
[1:23:15] FIGHTING THE BRIDE YET. Understand this.
[1:23:17] Before they crucify Jesus, the the the
[1:23:20] church members had to come against the
[1:23:21] Christ.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:26] Jesus manifested
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; forced the PHARISEES AND THE SCRIBE and
[1:23:32] the Sadducees to form the SAHIAN
[1:23:34] COUNCIL.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT FORC IT? The Jesus
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; or let's say it this way the word
[1:23:39] manifested.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Forced them TO COME TOGETHER TO FIGHT
[1:23:44] the word before the government could
[1:23:46] come down on Jesus. Remember the the the
[1:23:50] religious people is what arrest what
[1:23:52] corner Jesus
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; and then the government come AFTER THAT.
[1:23:56] THIS BRIDE will be THE REJECTED. THIS
[1:23:58] BRIDE will be Joseph.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; OH COME ON PREACH back to me somebody.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Do you understand what I'm
[1:24:04] saying? SO I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THE
[1:24:05] BATTLE IS NOT YET. WHEN DYNAMIC STRIKE
[1:24:08] THE BATTLE BEGINS. OH GIVE THE LORD A
[1:24:10] SHOUT. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. RIGHT NOW
[1:24:12] WE IN A BATTLE BUT A BIGGER BATTLE
[1:24:14] coming brother. Oh give the Lord some
[1:24:17] praises. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:24:20] The dynamic is nearer than when you
[1:24:21] first believe. This Holy Ghost power,
[1:24:24] this Holy Ghost anointing, IT IS NEARER
[1:24:27] than when you first believe. It is
[1:24:29] coming. Coming. Coming. Get ready for
[1:24:30] it. Get ready. Get ready. Get ready. Get
[1:24:33] ready. Get ready. IT'S COMING. DON'T
[1:24:35] BACKSLIDE. DON'T give up. DON'T LET GO.
[1:24:37] DON'T STAY HOME. Come on.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Come on. This thing is coming.
[1:24:44] Hallelujah.
[1:24:45] But Brandham, don't worry about Russia.
[1:24:48] Russia is a small pebble on the beach.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about communism. You watch
[1:24:52] Romanism when it's united with the
[1:24:55] churches.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; There is nothing written in the
[1:24:58] scripture about communism ruling the
[1:25:00] world. And I go by the word regardless
[1:25:03] of what anything else goes. It's the
[1:25:05] word. I believe it is Romanism that will
[1:25:08] take the world. And Romanism is the
[1:25:10] mother of organization. There never was
[1:25:13] an organization till Rome and every one
[1:25:15] of them come out of it. She was the
[1:25:17] mother of harlots.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; She was the mystery Babylon, prostitute
[1:25:21] Babylon. And she had daughters. Isn't
[1:25:23] that right?
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; The mother of harlots. I could stay in
[1:25:25] it half a day. All right. Let's take
[1:25:27] Daniel vision. Thou Daniel, thou king
[1:25:29] Nebuchadnezzar is the head of gold.
[1:25:31] Babylon.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Another kingdom will succeed which is
[1:25:36] silver which was me and Persia.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Another one was Greece, Alexander the
[1:25:40] Great. Next coming Rome and there was
[1:25:42] nothing said about communism. Rome
[1:25:44] conquered the world.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was born in the Roman
[1:25:49] kingdom and persecuted. His first time
[1:25:52] come here was by Roman kingdom. On his
[1:25:54] second advent coming now, his message is
[1:25:56] persecuted by the Roman denominations
[1:25:58] which is the mother of all of them. And
[1:25:59] when he returns, he will come back to
[1:26:01] wipe out that Roman kingdom.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; And the Jews has always looked up for
[1:26:05] him to come and wipe out the Roman
[1:26:06] kingdom. The Catholic hierarchy with all
[1:26:10] the denominations in the world right now
[1:26:11] coming together as an organization, the
[1:26:13] confederation of churches organizing
[1:26:15] themselves together. It isn't Russia,
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; it is Rome.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; That's why he said the devil coming down
[1:26:25] in his dynamics on in the under the
[1:26:28] opaces of United Nations will enforce
[1:26:31] the laws.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; That's how they going to close down the
[1:26:34] churches. Amen.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; The devil.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Under the opaces of the United Nations.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet say when the
[1:26:45] press come down,
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; watch your third pull then
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; because they're going to press you out.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; So people think in having churches and
[1:26:51] in the message and whatn not that going
[1:26:53] to be it that they don't even know
[1:26:54] what's coming.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; There's somebody had a dream when press
[1:27:00] come people to burn this book with
[1:27:01] books. They no longer want to be
[1:27:03] identified with this message.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; You understand? It's one thing to say
[1:27:06] you believe it.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Let me just talk a
[1:27:09] little bit.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Peter believed to him.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; But when they see it start to be Jesus,
[1:27:14] they
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Peter start to believe a little
[1:27:21] differently.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; He believed, you know, but
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; is licks passing, you know,
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; is that the Messiah? Get any man in
[1:27:27] charge there you know
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; and the guy licks
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; and they hold him
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; and somebody say hey you one of you boys
[1:27:35] see your grand service
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; said no not me at all I was not there I
[1:27:40] was not there man
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Peter denied the first one
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; but if he sure next say yes boy you
[1:27:47] looking like I see your hair cut
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; you're looking like one them see no ears
[1:27:54] no see
[1:27:57] He said, "No, it's not me." But the
[1:27:59] third one who tells this and not he's
[1:28:01] not he
[1:28:03] people following Jesus will cuss.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Peter had to cry and weep.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; You see it's a difference when a pig
[1:28:13] fall in the mud ped
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; and a sheep falling in mud.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; It's two different thing.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; When a pig hit the mud when you see he
[1:28:20] was in the house all the time. He never
[1:28:21] got out yet. He had the bow tie and
[1:28:22] thing inside the house. When he get when
[1:28:24] he master leave open my chance and he
[1:28:26] fall in the mud he I mean he he and the
[1:28:28] mud is one
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; he's very comfort you know you know
[1:28:32] crying there
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; he at home with the mud
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; when the sheep fall in the mud is bad
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; the sheep crying
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; and when you fall in the mud if you are
[1:28:41] sheep
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; you're going to cry because THEY WANT TO
[1:28:44] GET out
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; they want to get out that cancer stuff
[1:28:48] they want to get out that horrible stuff
[1:28:52] oh give the Lord some praise says
[1:28:56] it's one thing to say you believe but
[1:28:58] when drama starts is how much you really
[1:29:00] believe. Peter wept and Jesus still went
[1:29:04] and find them.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; When Peter said I go fishing, he's a
[1:29:07] leader. You know
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; people following the leader.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; They say we go fishing too. Three and a
[1:29:11] half years no fishing but Jesus not
[1:29:13] around.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; When when you see like the Holy Ghost
[1:29:15] not around or feel the Holy Ghost not
[1:29:16] around or feel this one not around. You
[1:29:17] do what you want to do.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; You go back to default. You go back into
[1:29:21] your normal positioning.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus found him. Try and have you any
[1:29:25] meat.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; They're fishing all night. Jesus. We
[1:29:28] fish all night and caught nothing. Yes.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Watch these words
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; day by experience. No, it's all night.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Cast your net to the right side. Words.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; What if they go my feelings? Oh god, I
[1:29:40] tired. But something tell them obey that
[1:29:43] voice.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; And when they cast your net, they get
[1:29:46] help
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; because a voice tell them cast your net.
[1:29:50] I don't care how long you're fishing.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; If Jesus say cast your net to the right
[1:29:54] side,
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; you're going to get what you're supposed
[1:29:56] to get. We have too much of unbelief.
[1:29:59] Give the Lord some praises.
[1:30:02] You have to let go your feelings and let
[1:30:04] go your emotions and let go your tears
[1:30:06] and let go your fears AND LET GO ALL
[1:30:08] THIS THING AND LET YOUR FAITH THROW OUT.
[1:30:11] COME ON, PREACH BACK TO ME SOMEBODY. Let
[1:30:12] your faith throw out.
[1:30:16] God could give you house car land. God
[1:30:18] could give you God could bless you. Your
[1:30:20] cup could run over. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:30:22] shout. You don't even have to have
[1:30:23] what's inside your cup. YOUR CUP COULD
[1:30:24] GET go be pouring or you say David say
[1:30:26] my cup run it over. Surely goodness and
[1:30:29] mercy SHALL FOLLOW ME ALL THE DAYS OF MY
[1:30:31] LIFE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY BLIGHT. YOU
[1:30:33] DON'T HAVE TO STAY DOWN. YOU DON'T HAVE
[1:30:35] TO STAY LOW. LET IT BREAK OUT. BUST
[1:30:37] THROUGH. BREAK OUT. HALLELUJAH. GIVE THE
[1:30:39] LORD some praises.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:30:47] You may be seated. I would never let
[1:30:50] this message world limit me.
[1:30:52] That's what people do.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; People try to out your dream or out your
[1:30:55] vision. That's why sometime they can't
[1:30:56] even tell people your stuff
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; cuz the spirit upon them want to bind
[1:31:01] you.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're not saying go BOY,
[1:31:04] GO BOY, RIDE, RIDE, RIDE. NO, THEY
[1:31:06] KEEPING a stable
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; as if the growing horse inside of there.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; The horse was made to run.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Just ship was made to steal. Ship wasn't
[1:31:15] made to be by the sh. I didn't want to
[1:31:16] sink. I ain't flowing no way.
[1:31:19] They said get a car.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; You get that?
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; A ship was made to sail the sea.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; A ship ain't going out. You see storm.
[1:31:29] You see you see the waves. So where you
[1:31:32] want to go? Ship was float on land. You
[1:31:33] want to put wheels on the ship.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Ship was built to sail.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Eagles was built to fly.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Chicken was built to scratch.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; So you could scratch if you want
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; or you could fly if you want.
[1:31:49] And on this flight there is no red light
[1:31:52] stopping you and turn to the right and
[1:31:54] turns up. You fly where you want to fly.
[1:31:56] You go where you want to go. You go down
[1:31:58] in prayer. You go up in praise. You go
[1:32:00] down in the word. Nobody can hinder you
[1:32:02] getting revelation, inspiration. Nobody
[1:32:05] can bust up your blessing. Praise God.
[1:32:07] You come here anointed. You come here
[1:32:09] inspired. YOU COME HERE WITH FIRE OVER
[1:32:11] YOU. OH, GLORY TO GOD. THE ANGEL WITH
[1:32:14] YOU. Give the LORD SOME PRAISES.
[1:32:17] GLORY TO GOD. ONE IS A MAJORITY IN GOD.
[1:32:20] YOU COULD SAY, "GOD, I'M A MAJORITY
[1:32:23] BECAUSE I AM CALLING UPON YOU. IF NOBODY
[1:32:25] IS CALLING, I'M CALLING. IF NOBODY IS
[1:32:27] ASKING, I AM ASKING. IF NOBODY'S
[1:32:29] BELIEVING, I AM BELIEVING." COME ON NOW.
[1:32:31] IF NOBODY IS KNOCKING,
[1:32:33] I AM KNOCKING THIS MORNING. IF YOU
[1:32:36] KNOCK, THE DOOR SHALL BE OPEN. IF YOU
[1:32:38] SEEK, YOU SHALL FIND. COME ON NOW. IF
[1:32:40] YOU ASK, IT SHALL BE GIVEN. GIVE THE
[1:32:42] LORD SOME PRAISES this morning. Glory to
[1:32:45] God. You can sit there in your stinking
[1:32:47] rotten unbelief as if God is dead. AS IF
[1:32:50] GOD CAN'T make a way. AS IF GOD CAN OPEN
[1:32:53] UP THE RED SEA FOR YOU. OH, glory to
[1:32:55] God. He is still a way maker.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; I don't want you saying he's a way maker
[1:33:02] and you don't believe that because your
[1:33:05] action is reflecting. You don't really
[1:33:06] believe he's a way maker
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; because you want to make your own way.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my. It's dust says the Lord. Praise
[1:33:13] God.
[1:33:15] Now watch.
[1:33:17] Now they found out recently that your
[1:33:20] body is full of light. X-ray proves that
[1:33:24] the X-ray does not have any light of its
[1:33:26] own. It's your light that it uses. You
[1:33:29] are born with four rays. This is deep.
[1:33:33] After a little while, say 20, 25, one
[1:33:35] ray goes out.
[1:33:37] 35, another. 40, another one goes out.
[1:33:41] And finally, when you get past 65,
[1:33:44] you're living on your last ray. And
[1:33:46] every time you take an X-ray picture,
[1:33:48] you're tearing them rays down. And
[1:33:50] that's the reason you stick those feet
[1:33:52] uh kids feet in them machines and just
[1:33:54] tearing the rays right out of little
[1:33:55] bodies. That is cosmic light that is in
[1:33:58] you. You are made up of full of light
[1:34:01] cells. That is cosmic light.
[1:34:05] God is a different light
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; and yet he is light. And I think of the
[1:34:11] picture here as a proof of what I'm
[1:34:13] fixing to say that God is light. And
[1:34:15] when we were walking in the light of God
[1:34:18] as sons of God, God is not cosmic light.
[1:34:22] But God's life operated through the
[1:34:26] cosmic light of our bodies and our
[1:34:29] cells. So as a human being, we have
[1:34:31] cosmic light. God light is different.
[1:34:34] And God light could work through the
[1:34:36] light that he put in us.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Amen.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; All right. He said now and then the fall
[1:34:42] came. Okay. Not read but God's life
[1:34:44] operates through the cosmic light of our
[1:34:46] bodies, ourselves and we become we were
[1:34:49] absolutely at one time real genuine sons
[1:34:54] of God.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Then the fall came and then here we go.
[1:34:59] When the fruit of the spirit today is
[1:35:03] love, joy, faith, longsuffering,
[1:35:07] meekness, gentleness, patience, all
[1:35:10] supernatural.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; So these things on the pyramid that
[1:35:15] people take very lightly at your feet,
[1:35:16] virtue, knowledge, they think there's a
[1:35:18] board, you know, that just things just
[1:35:20] written there, you know, but these
[1:35:22] qualities are
[1:35:24] supernatural.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; These virtues are actually supernatural.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:35:34] So, watch. It's got to a spot to where
[1:35:36] all the whole body like a seaweed,
[1:35:38] right? You get in the bottom of the sea.
[1:35:40] Lots of time divers, they get under the
[1:35:42] seaweed and before they know it, they're
[1:35:43] wrapped in such a way they can't get out
[1:35:44] of it. Well, that's the way sin has done
[1:35:48] to the human being. That's the way, here
[1:35:50] we go, coldness has done to the church.
[1:35:53] That's the way communist has done to the
[1:35:55] nation. It is so treacherous. Then in
[1:35:57] the human body, it wrapped us and is
[1:36:00] pushing out this light of God by
[1:36:03] denominations and denying faith and so
[1:36:04] forth. It is pushed out all the rays of
[1:36:07] God's great power of faith that's in us.
[1:36:10] That should be he pushed all those rays
[1:36:12] out in such a place till we got a lodge.
[1:36:14] And now below the lodge, the church
[1:36:16] cause it just push all the darkness. He
[1:36:19] said this doesn't happen. Denying it
[1:36:20] could happen. The miracles of God. Here
[1:36:22] we go. Listen. Yet the man somewhere
[1:36:25] down in him, somewhere in him, if I'll
[1:36:28] illustrate it like a button. Here we go.
[1:36:30] When a man is saved, that much of him is
[1:36:34] God, that's the little light that comes
[1:36:38] in to make you quit doing what is wrong.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; So when you give the life to Jesus
[1:36:44] Christ, you get baptized in Jesus name,
[1:36:46] you have an experience with God, a
[1:36:47] little light coming to you.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; That light is what make you stop going
[1:36:51] to baptis dance. That light is make you
[1:36:53] give up cigarette and smoke. That light
[1:36:56] something happened inside of you.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; It's a little light like a button.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me now?
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; That little light that comes in to make
[1:37:05] you quit doing what's wrong. Now, are
[1:37:08] you ready? Yeah.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; If you can take all the malice and envy
[1:37:13] and strife and unbelief out, that little
[1:37:18] buttonlike of the light and the power of
[1:37:20] God will keep growing.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; So God give you a start,
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; a light. I can give you a scripture.
[1:37:28] It's a familiar scripture. As many as
[1:37:29] receive him, to them give he
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; power to become.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; It doesn't make you an instant son, but
[1:37:36] you get the start. You have faith. God
[1:37:39] give you a start. He give you virtue
[1:37:41] which is power to add the rest of the
[1:37:44] life. Knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:37:47] godliness, brotherly kindness. And then
[1:37:49] you can't get closer to God. When you
[1:37:51] say you want to get uh nearer to God, he
[1:37:54] starts you with faith.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; When you get virtue, you're getting
[1:37:57] nearer. Oh God, I want more of you. Give
[1:38:00] you knowledge.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh God, I need you more. He
[1:38:04] give you temperance and patience. You're
[1:38:06] getting closer to him. And after a
[1:38:08] while, you can't get any closer. You
[1:38:09] become one with him. Then the spirit is
[1:38:11] upon you. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:38:13] praises. Hallelujah. Give the Lord a
[1:38:16] shout in the house. Then you're mature.
[1:38:19] You are ready to be positionally placed
[1:38:21] as a son that God could identify himself
[1:38:23] with you. So it's no longer you identify
[1:38:25] yourself with him. Is now he identify
[1:38:28] himself with you. Oh, GIVE THE LORD A
[1:38:29] SHOUT. THIS is our promise. Oh, GIVE THE
[1:38:32] LORD A SHOUT in the house. WE'RE NOT
[1:38:35] TALKING ABOUT THE PASTOR OR THE PREACHER
[1:38:36] or elder or a deacon. We're talking
[1:38:38] about you.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; God identifying himself with you.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; You remember Elijah and Elisha.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; When Elijah cross over and he get the
[1:38:50] mantle and he hit him and soo the mantle
[1:38:52] from only have a camera take a picture
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; but that can't get him across you know
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; taking pictures of getting him across.
[1:38:59] You know
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; he have no boat to build to go. Elijah
[1:39:02] walked across
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Jordan
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; on dry ground
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; and now he left and gone.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Here is a young man with the mantle on
[1:39:10] him. All of a sudden you get a
[1:39:11] revelation. It's not the mantle.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; It's the God of Elijah.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; It's not the mantle. It's not the books.
[1:39:18] It's not the tapes. It's the God of the
[1:39:21] books and tapes. OH, GIVE THE GIVE THE
[1:39:22] LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. AND WHEN THAT
[1:39:26] YOUNG MAN RECOGNIZED THAT, HE TOOK THE
[1:39:27] MAN AND SAID, "WHERE IS THE LORD GOD OF
[1:39:29] ELIJAH?" AND WHEN HE STRUCK THE JORDAN,
[1:39:31] JORDAN KNOW WHAT TO DO when a SON COMING
[1:39:34] THROUGH. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT.
[1:39:37] JORDAN KNOW WHAT TO DO. WHEN A SON IS
[1:39:40] COMING THROUGH,
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Jordan open up.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; And when all them school of the prophets
[1:39:45] LOOKING A FAR OFF, WHEN THEY LOOKING AT
[1:39:47] IT SO AND HE COME THROUGH, THEY SAY THE
[1:39:49] SPIRIT OF ELIJAH, GOD REST upon Elisha.
[1:39:52] AND ONE OF THESE DAYS THEY WILL SAY THE
[1:39:55] SPIRIT OF ELIJAH IS UPON THE BRIDE OF
[1:39:58] Jesus Christ. Okay. THE LORD A SHOUT
[1:40:00] DOING THE SAME WORKS THAT THAT PROPHET
[1:40:02] DIDTH. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE IT'S THE
[1:40:04] SPIRIT OF Jesus coming upon the bride.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; I HAVE A SCRIPTURE. THE SPIRIT AND THE
[1:40:10] BRIDE.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; SAY COME.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS THE BRIDE BECOMES THE WORD
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; AND THE SPIRIT COMES UPON YOU
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU NOW ARE BECOME THE VERY WORD
[1:40:20] ITSELF. OH GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE
[1:40:23] HOUSE. NOT PART OF THE WORD, THE WORD
[1:40:25] ITSELF.
[1:40:29] OH, GIVE the Lord some praises.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Do you get it?
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; The spirit
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; comes to the word.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; So Jesus was the word.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; The word became flesh.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; And the spirit came to him
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; and he said the spirit is upon me.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; I ain't know about nobody else.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; But I know what's upon me.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; It's the spirit
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; that's upon me
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; because he had anointed me. I didn't
[1:40:54] ANOINT MYSELF. HE OH, GET THE LORD SOME
[1:40:56] POWER. JESUS, A man of God, APPROVED BY
[1:41:00] GOD WITH SIGNS, WONDERS, AND MIRACLES
[1:41:02] among you. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:41:04] praises. Therefore, you have to be under
[1:41:06] expectation for the spirit to come upon
[1:41:08] you. NOT LUTHER. COME ON NOW. NOT
[1:41:10] WESLEY. COME ON NOW. NOT THE
[1:41:12] PENTECOSTAL. NOT COME ON NOW. THE
[1:41:14] DYNAMIC ITSELF,
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; the spirit itself.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; WHAT WE ARE PROMISED, the Pentecostal
[1:41:25] never had.
[1:41:27] Hallelujah.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Let me say it again.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; What we are promised
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; the Pentecostal never had.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; They had the birth that was to take into
[1:41:39] adoption. But they rejected the word
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; which was the tutorship cuz any son that
[1:41:44] going to be adopted must be under tutors
[1:41:46] and governors until the time appointed
[1:41:48] by the father. So they rejected the
[1:41:50] tutorship of the word. So what we were
[1:41:52] under for the past 50 plus years is the
[1:41:54] tutorship of the word. THAT TSHIP BRINGS
[1:41:57] DISCIPLINE. That discipline bring order.
[1:42:00] OH GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE.
[1:42:01] THE PROBLEM IS PEOPLE DON'T WANT
[1:42:03] DISCIPLINE. PEOPLE DON'T WANT ORDER. But
[1:42:05] God is a God of order. Oh give the Lord
[1:42:08] some praises in the house.
[1:42:11] Hallelujah.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; So God don't have no haphazard kingdom
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; and neither does Satan.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; So when they was accusing Jesus of being
[1:42:26] the king of Belieab and Bub champion and
[1:42:28] whatnot and he cast no devil by the the
[1:42:30] prince of devils bleub he said that no
[1:42:32] kingdom
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; any kingdom that's divided
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; cannot stand.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Satan's kingdom cannot stand if it's
[1:42:39] divided. So he's showing that Satan Kim
[1:42:41] is not divided. He have principalities.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; He have powers. He have spiritual
[1:42:46] wickedness. He have a whole host of
[1:42:48] demons. All passing through Hollywood
[1:42:49] and sports.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Didn't expect that one, did you?
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Was reading about a man who actually
[1:43:05] they want him to sell his soul to the
[1:43:06] devil to be in football. And he's one of
[1:43:09] them who turn it down
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; man open say would you sell your soul
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; to the devil do you take all them sports
[1:43:15] and whatn not all them uh heroes and
[1:43:17] whatnot it's not just heroes just so you
[1:43:19] know
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; there is spirit power behind that
[1:43:22] because all these things break
[1:43:24] influences Satan is a see is not a
[1:43:26] comedian you know
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; he not for entertainment you know he for
[1:43:31] destructional
[1:43:34] [cheering]
[1:43:35] Yeah.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; All in Hollywood.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; It's witchcraft.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; There's all kind of demonic activity.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; They in the realm of the spirit.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; How much time I heard about actors and
[1:43:48] whatnot. They will go in rooms and stay
[1:43:50] by yourself and whatnot to to channel
[1:43:52] the spirit of what they want to act.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; You're not acting like if it's a book um
[1:43:56] you know um go here and they talking
[1:43:59] talking. That's normal thing.
[1:44:01] But when they start,
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; they actually in the spirit of the
[1:44:04] thing.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; That is why they get them Emmy and
[1:44:07] awards and so on. They manifest certain
[1:44:09] things. They channeling certain things.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Spirits.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, the devil having a good time.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; With all these characters
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; because because the spirit is harmless
[1:44:22] until it get a body to use.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; That's that's all them devils we talking
[1:44:26] about now. But the Holy Ghost is
[1:44:28] harmless
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; until he gets somebody to use.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; So I was studying about the fall of
[1:44:35] Rome,
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; how Rome fell, how R was entertaining
[1:44:38] the people with the gladiators and whatn
[1:44:40] not, keeping them entertained.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; And then giving them free grain
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; so that they wouldn't question what is
[1:44:47] happening behind
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden ro money going down
[1:44:50] down down. First they had the gold and
[1:44:53] afterwards they they have half gold less
[1:44:56] gold and they have silver and half is
[1:44:58] not silver and the money lost value.
[1:45:01] Afterward was the car pays the soldiers
[1:45:03] so things went down economically
[1:45:06] spiritually and that was the collapse of
[1:45:08] Rome.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Same thing happened with
[1:45:11] France. I didn't realize France was the
[1:45:12] biggest army in Europe.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Same thing happened.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Extend themselves. Money fell and
[1:45:18] everything collapsed.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; America is next. America in that right
[1:45:22] now.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Super debt
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; overextended by the army and whatn not.
[1:45:26] Money going to collapse.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; No longer the strength of the US dollar
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; because they have to have a new system
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; that you can't buy or sell
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; unless you take the mark of the beast.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; A new system have to be bured. So the
[1:45:39] old system have to die.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; So you are seeing a collapse of an
[1:45:43] empire that once was great and powerful.
[1:45:45] Not even China bing with them anymore.
[1:45:48] The rest of the world not even but
[1:45:49] they're losing ground every single day.
[1:45:51] The bride is different.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; So we know the devil cannot get stronger
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; because the devil will all be the devil.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; But we can.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Do you get that?
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; You are in a position to get stronger.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. YOU
[1:46:12] ARE IN A POSITION TO get stronger
[1:46:16] [cheering]
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; because you in a position to receive
[1:46:19] revelation from God.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:26] So watch
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; if you can take that all the all the
[1:46:30] malice and envy and strife and unbelief
[1:46:33] out that little button light of the
[1:46:35] light and power of God will keep growing
[1:46:39] growing growing and crowding out
[1:46:41] unbelief. And you don't do it by
[1:46:43] exaltation of body exercise. You do it
[1:46:45] by a sanctified You do it by a
[1:46:47] sanctified consecrated life that the
[1:46:50] Holy Spirit moves through you.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.

[1:46:57] consecrated life. The Holy Spirit will
[1:46:59] move through you and that's the thunder
[1:47:01] that going to shake the devil. Devil
[1:47:03] don't care about shout and dance and how
[1:47:04] holl and what not. What hurts the devil
[1:47:06] is to see a sanctified life. You can't
[1:47:08] touch that life. That's a channel of God
[1:47:11] that you becomes a channel of God
[1:47:13] through a channel. Praise God out here.
[1:47:15] Ma come evil and good. You can't cuss
[1:47:17] out and bless God bless you and then you

[1:47:42] ashamed of what you wear. You're not
[1:47:44] ashamed of how you look. You're not
[1:47:46] ashamed of who laugh at you. You're
[1:47:47] looking like a old woman. You're looking
[1:47:49] like some old this and old that. You're

[1:48:03] Glory.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandon was talking about um
[1:48:10] sick and praying and whatnot. If the
[1:48:11] devil says, "Hey, you know what? What
[1:48:12] you're feeling, don't even speak to him.
[1:48:15] Just keep going." The devil know the
[1:48:17] devil say but you know so and so when
[1:48:20] they got the Holy Ghost they almost lost
[1:48:21] their mind
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; don't speak to him
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; just keep on going
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; if you and God that's right keep go he's
[1:48:29] anointed servants he said I got to hurry
[1:48:32] he said listen lady talking to lady now
[1:48:34] here we see the tactics of the devil so
[1:48:36] he's talking to a sick woman how do we
[1:48:39] do I've got a lot of scripture here in
[1:48:41] prophets and so on it's his tactic to
[1:48:43] try to get the people to disbelieve
[1:48:46] God's word.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Listen you soldiers of the cross. When
[1:48:50] you disbelieve one word of God's written
[1:48:53] Bible, you are disarmed.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; In other words, to fight, you have to
[1:48:59] get the weapons.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible talk about put on
[1:49:04] the whole armor of God, press of
[1:49:05] righteousness, the sword of the spirit,
[1:49:07] the shield of faith and everything else.
[1:49:09] You have to have the armory to fight.
[1:49:12] But if the devil come and that sword you
[1:49:14] have there know that's a butter knife.
[1:49:18] See, let me show you. You see, you could
[1:49:20] take the butter here and put in the
[1:49:21] bread.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; And he make you think that your sword
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; is like a butter knife. It's not
[1:49:28] effective. If you believe his words,
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; you lost the power right there.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; See, Samson didn't catch it. He was
[1:49:38] covenanted with seven locks.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Not 127 locks. Was a raster.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Seven locks.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; And he was covenanted by that. That is
[1:49:50] what kept the power on him.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; When the tried to tell him this and he
[1:49:56] just tie me, I lose my power and he
[1:49:58] break. He laughing. He making fun.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; He's lying and laughing.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; My lord,
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; you hear that? Amen.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; That servant, that son is lying
[1:50:10] and laughing
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; and still have the power with him
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; because he hasn't broke the covenant
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; with God. He said, God says, "As long as
[1:50:18] you have them seven knocks, the power is
[1:50:20] with you."
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Do you know all kind of crazy stuff? You
[1:50:22] see, he's backsliding slowly. He's going
[1:50:24] backwards.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; He's not recognizing by discernment the
[1:50:27] devil upon that woman.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; You see, nice woman.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; She not from church. She not in church
[1:50:34] but she looking nice outside
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; here recognize he is a future target
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; to be killed
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; to be destroyed to be wrecked
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; he finds you looking good
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; and the mother likes you too somebody
[1:50:49] give you know mother completely under
[1:50:52] the spirit
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; family like her you know
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; yeah the family deserve the devil behind
[1:50:57] that woman behind
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; the devil behind that two feet walking
[1:51:01] there you know Are you nice and peaceful
[1:51:04] and no
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; it is looking here now is later on is
[1:51:07] the danger
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; that same woman have a force behind her
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; that same woman have money behind her
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; get his secret
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; get his secret
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; when she finished with him so
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; and cut his locks because right now she
[1:51:21] break him
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; the Bible says Samson shake himself like
[1:51:25] other times he custom shaking self the
[1:51:27] power hallelujah glory
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; but then he recognized he's just another
[1:51:32] He didn't realize he was always another
[1:51:34] man.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; A normal man is the power of God was
[1:51:36] upon him.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; That made a difference. He thought he
[1:51:39] had it.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; He thought it was locked down. It was
[1:51:42] not.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; You have to stay with God.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; You have to stay with the word.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; You have to stay with the covenant
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; and God will be with you.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Can we give the Lord a shout in the
[1:51:54] house?
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. BUT ONCE A SON,
[1:52:00] always a son. And when they beat up
[1:52:02] Samson had enough licks to have enough
[1:52:04] sense in his head. Sometimes people to
[1:52:06] go through the stuff to get sense in
[1:52:07] their head
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; because in front of them so and they
[1:52:09] acting stupid
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; as we were saying acting moxy.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; It's in front of your face.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; You go through the pressure
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; eyes out now. And anybody once more.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; The only reason he could say once more,
[1:52:23] he had it before.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; You can't say once more and you never
[1:52:26] had it. and he never tasted it. He
[1:52:29] tasted of the power of God. He tasted of
[1:52:31] the supernatural anointing. Therefore,
[1:52:33] he could say once more, "Release the
[1:52:35] power. RELEASE THE ANOINTING. RELEASE
[1:52:38] THE HOLY GHOST." OH, GIVE THE LORD A
[1:52:39] SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. AND THE DYNAMICS OF
[1:52:42] THIS CHURCH WILL BE A REFILLING OF THE
[1:52:44] Holy Ghost. Going to fill you with power
[1:52:46] that you CAN SAY, "GIVE ME MORE, LORD.
[1:52:48] [screaming] MORE OIL IN MY LAMP TO KEEP
[1:52:49] ME BURNING." HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:58] Praise God.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; So brother Bam is talking to her sister.
[1:53:01] I understand the sister was on a wheelch
[1:53:03] on on a on a crutches and when he
[1:53:05] finished she came out of it.

[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; On on on the um on what she was lying
[1:53:14] on.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "Little little lady, listen
[1:53:17] close." So he's speaking to her. the
[1:53:20] tactics of the devil. When you

[1:53:25] Bible, you're disarmed. Believe that,

[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; God have no retreat in him.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Be in a battle.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; What God said is true. Every man word is
[1:55:13] a lie. And as soon get you to listen to
[1:55:16] one thing like it's tactic or disarm.
[1:55:18] How many things? How many things did Eve
[1:55:20] have to listen to?
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; One.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Wasn't a whole Bible. The message is so
[1:55:27] difficult. What books I read? No, just
[1:55:29] one.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; She husband tell she we could eat
[1:55:33] everything but she's that tree. The day
[1:55:35] we eat we shall
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; surely die.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Satan don't know what God said. She
[1:55:40] asked Eve he's wise you know. You stupid
[1:55:43] devil. This devil have a degree.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Come to Eve. What did God say? Because
[1:55:51] God not talking to me.
[1:55:54] He don't know what God say. She She
[1:55:56] excited. God said [laughter]
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; she was talking too much.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; You have to know when to shut up.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; You have to know who you're talking to.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Be yapping, yapping, yapping, yapping.
[1:56:10] She could have tell him wait till my
[1:56:11] husband come homeay.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Oh no the devil's screwed.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; But she said God say we can have
[1:56:18] everything but that tree. Oh if we only
[1:56:20] eat that we shall surely die. He say he
[1:56:21] said that
[1:56:24] you shall not surely die.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; But you can't just say that alone. You
[1:56:28] have to give an offer.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Devil don't tell him not just know
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; if you shall not surely die. But God
[1:56:34] knows that if you eat, you shall have
[1:56:37] the knowledge of good and evil. He want
[1:56:39] to hide you from that. I'm here to
[1:56:42] reveal this mystery of the knowledge of
[1:56:44] good and evil. He's exciting evil. I'm
[1:56:47] telling you.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; When he finished, but she was hooked,
[1:56:51] lying, hook and sinker
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; for that lie of the devil.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Note everything man have is knowledge of
[1:56:56] good and evil.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Car very nice and whatnot. Bouncing
[1:57:00] people, killing people.
[1:57:02] Everything man make you could think
[1:57:04] about have some kind of flow in it.
[1:57:06] Amen.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; You ever hear them advertisement for
[1:57:09] them pills have in America and whatn not
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; for this disease and that disease and
[1:57:13] they talk fast know this will give you
[1:57:15] heartache sometime they have I think
[1:57:16] this makes my s blind you know they
[1:57:19] could check your doctor and think t and
[1:57:22] you know it's it's mindboggling they
[1:57:24] could get spinal problems and this
[1:57:26] problem and that problem and kidney
[1:57:27] problem what check
[1:57:32] and if when you take it you get the
[1:57:34] symptom consult your doctor after the

[1:57:38] say I didn't tell you
[1:57:40] every bill or everything man have it
[1:57:43] have some kind of corruption inside of
[1:57:44] it because there's the knowledge of good
[1:57:46] and evil. Oh, give the Lord a shout in
[1:57:49] the house
[1:57:51] [applause]
[1:57:52] man. Wicked. You know them
[1:57:54] pharmaceutical companies wicked. You
[1:57:56] know
[1:57:59] tell my wife I want to take the pill but
[1:58:01] I have no faith in them. You know
[1:58:03] you see when I juicing the celery and
[1:58:05] the green apples and the green thing and
[1:58:06] thing and I have confidence in that.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; That's nature. I drink all of that and
[1:58:10] that charge me up. But them pill say
[1:58:12] pill. I have no faith in that. I just
[1:58:14] put you inside. I no believe in that.
[1:58:17] Hallelujah.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; I will give myself my own charge.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; So listen to brother Ramier now.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; How many things did Eve listen to? She
[1:58:26] was disarmed right then. What did the
[1:58:29] devil do? Swept right through her mind.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Into her spirit.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; And there she was perverted.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; See what the devil does.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Mind spirit. What does God do? Mind
[1:58:44] spirit. When you come to church, what
[1:58:46] you're hearing? The word.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; The word trying to pierce through your
[1:58:49] mind into your spirit. And if you
[1:58:52] receive it willingly and inwardly, it
[1:58:54] have an effect upon you.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Then you know you have to do something
[1:58:57] about it. God never sends his word and
[1:59:00] it's just like they eat like chewing
[1:59:01] gum. You chew it and you spit it out
[1:59:02] afterwards. No. When God send his word
[1:59:04] is for you to act on it. There's always
[1:59:06] something to act upon.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Those lepers come to Jesus, Lord, help
[1:59:12] us and save us. And what he said, go
[1:59:13] shoot yourself to the priest. Yes.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Act
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; disobey.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew they was not going to reach
[1:59:20] the priest, but they was heading towards
[1:59:21] the priest.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; On their way, they were healed and one
[1:59:24] came back and worship.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS TOLD THAT ONE, "Thy faith have
[1:59:29] made you whole."
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; The others were healed by obedience. But
[1:59:32] this one had faith because faith is
[1:59:34] bringing into worship.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Brother George, HOW THE CHURCHES IS DEAD
[1:59:38] AND THEY CLAIM TO HAVE REVELATION. THEY
[1:59:39] DON'T HAVE THE revelation that they
[1:59:41] claim they have. Because faith, which is
[1:59:43] revelation, brings you into worship. Oh,
[1:59:46] GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. COME ON, PREACH
[1:59:47] BACK TO ME, SOMEBODY. HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:50] BECAUSE FAITH IS A SUBSTANCE THAT YOU'RE
[1:59:52] HOPING FOR. FAITH IS A REVELATION OF
[1:59:54] WHAT YOU'RE HOPING FOR. IT'S REVEALED TO
[1:59:56] YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE IT YET, BUT YOU
[1:59:57] COULD PRAISE GOD IN ADVANCE FOR WHAT IS
[2:00:00] COMING. OH, GIVE THE Lord a shout in the
[2:00:02] house.
[2:00:05] HALLELUJAH.
[2:00:07] HALLELUJAH.
[2:00:08] THE REVELATION OF DAVID. THE LORD IS MY
[2:00:10] SHEPHERD. I SHALL NOT WANT.
[2:00:14] [cheering]
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; OH, give the Lord some praises. He is
[2:00:20] covering you this morning. Oh, the bed
[2:00:22] is over you this morning. HE'S A
[2:00:24] PROVIDER THIS MORNING. HE'S A PROTECTOR
[2:00:27] this morning. HE'S A WAY MAKER THIS
[2:00:29] MORNING.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [cheering]
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[2:00:37] GLORY TO GOD. IF THAT devil tell you
[2:00:39] can't GET A BREAKTHROUGH, THE DEVIL'S A
[2:00:40] LIAR. HOW DO WE KNOW HE'S A LIAR? EVERY
[2:00:43] TIME HE OPEN HIS MOUTH, HE CANNOT speak
[2:00:45] the truth because the TRUTH IS NOT IN
[2:00:47] HIM. OH, give the Lord SOME PRAISES. BUT
[2:00:51] GOD IS NOT A MAN THAT WOULD LIE. EVERY
[2:00:53] PROMISE HE SPEAKS, HE IS big enough TO
[2:00:55] KEEP IT. HE IS BIG ENOUGH TO FULFILL IT.
[2:00:57] HE IS BIG ENOUGH TO CONFIRM IT. HE SAID,
[2:00:59] "MY WORD SHALL NOT RETURN UNTO ME VOID.
[2:01:08] HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; God's soldiers are commanded to put on
[2:01:15] the whole armor of God.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Satan's weapon
[2:01:21] against you is to try to get you to
[2:01:23] disbelieve your weapon. He disarms you.
[2:01:26] Praise God. Sometime it switches to
[2:01:30] disbelieve your minister, not even
[2:01:32] reading what the word saying. Minister
[2:01:34] tell them all kind of things talking
[2:01:35] nice sounding good types. Minister
[2:01:38] playing prophet too revealing things
[2:01:40] because he seen it. So when he had a
[2:01:41] dream last night and whatn not I no
[2:01:43] prophet at all. God sent a prophet to
[2:01:45] take the burden for me to figure out
[2:01:46] nothing. I have nothing to figure out.
[2:01:48] God sent a prophet and the words are
[2:01:51] here from the book.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; They are spirit given words.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; His words spoke to the mouth of the
[2:01:55] prophet that a man shall live by bread
[2:01:58] alone but by every word that proceedth
[2:01:59] of the mouth of God and the mouth of God
[2:02:01] eyes are prophets. So if I say what the
[2:02:03] tape say or say what the prophets say, I
[2:02:05] am saying from the mouth of God. So you
[2:02:07] are hearing from God's mouth this
[2:02:09] morning. Oh give the Lord some praises.
[2:02:11] Hallelujah. So when you disbelieve the
[2:02:13] word, you get disarmed. You have no
[2:02:15] weapon. SATAN HAVE YOUR FINISH. MILLIONS
[2:02:18] OF PEOPLE GOING TO CHURCH this morning
[2:02:19] and THEY ARE DISARMED. HALLELUJAH.
[2:02:22] HALLELUJAH. NO, THEY HAVE NO ammunition
[2:02:24] to fight the devil. But we have this
[2:02:26] morning. We are armed this morning. We
[2:02:28] are READY AND ARMED. WHO SHALL PREPARE
[2:02:31] HIMSELF FOR THE BATTLE. OH, GIVE THE
[2:02:33] LORD A SHOUT. YOU HAVE TO BE READY AND
[2:02:35] ARMED. OH, give the Lord some praises.
[2:02:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:02:40] Let's go.
[2:02:43] What does the spirit fight with? But let
[2:02:46] the mind that was in Christ, the Bible
[2:02:48] said, what kind of mind did he have? He
[2:02:50] stayed with the word. Stay with the
[2:02:51] word, the father's word, and defeat the
[2:02:53] enemy every time.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Now, when the enemy attacks and try to
[2:02:56] say you got to do this and do that, what
[2:02:58] are you going to do? Stay with the word.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Now when you when watch watch when what
[2:03:04] you want to do then take the word. What
[2:03:06] is the word? The Bible said we read it
[2:03:08] for the spirit of the God is the word.
[2:03:11] Look here. Take on the helmet of
[2:03:12] salvation. The sword. The sword of the
[2:03:14] spirit. The sword of the spirit. What
[2:03:17] the spirit. Here we go. That comes
[2:03:19] through your mind and enters into you.
[2:03:22] And the sword of that spirit is the word
[2:03:26] of God.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Question. What does the spirit fight
[2:03:29] with? I'm reading what he's asking. What
[2:03:33] does the spirit fight with? What does
[2:03:35] the Holy Spirit fight with? Sensations?
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Feelings?
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; The word.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; You say, "What does it fight with
[2:03:42] feeling?" No, the word. Let's say the
[2:03:44] word.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; And he make them say the word.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; The word of God, which is the spirit.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; So the spirit fights with the word.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; So if you're not in the word, how you
[2:03:52] going to fight
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; with comic strip, with Hollywood, with
[2:03:57] some daily word? What? What what you
[2:03:58] going to fight with? You have to have
[2:03:59] the word to fight with.

[2:04:03] devil tell him and you know human being.

[2:14:59] show great signs and wonders in so much
[2:15:01] it shall if possible that shall deceive
[2:15:03] the very elect.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; All this have to come here now.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; This part of the battle today.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:12] This also know 2 Timothy 3. Perilous
[2:15:14] time shall come. Men shall be lovers of
[2:15:16] their own selves, covetous, boasters,
[2:15:18] proud, blasphemers, disobedient of
[2:15:20] parents, unthankful, unholy, without
[2:15:22] natural affection, truth breakers, false
[2:15:24] for accusers, incontinent, fierce,
[2:15:26] despisers of those that are good,
[2:15:27] traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of
[2:15:29] pleasure, lovers of God, having a form
[2:15:31] of godliness, church folks,
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; but denying the power of thereof in the
[2:15:35] message mind you.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about Pentecostal and
[2:15:37] baptism, Methodist, talking about
[2:15:39] message folks. Yes.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Ever learning. Let me speak. For days
[2:15:46] these are the sort which creep in the
[2:15:48] houses and leave captive silly women
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; laden with sins. Love them kind of
[2:15:51] characters. Let away with divers lost.
[2:15:53] Ever learning and never able come to the
[2:15:55] knowledge of the truth. Now as Janice
[2:15:57] and Jambas with Moses so these resist
[2:15:59] the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate
[2:16:03] what? Concerning what? Concerning the
[2:16:04] faith.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; They shall proceed no further. For their
[2:16:08] folly shall be made manifest unto all
[2:16:09] men as there also was.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; Some time ago I read the scripture to
[2:16:13] you. Joel 3:10 said, "Beat your
[2:16:15] plowshares into swords."
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; What you have in your gardening, you
[2:16:19] said bees into swords,
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; your pruding hooks into spears, and let
[2:16:23] the weak say,
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; "I am strong.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; I am strong."
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; We about to close.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Lucifer coming with two main attacks.
[2:16:32] one to try to get you, deceive you off
[2:16:35] the word
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; because Eve was only a part of the word,
[2:16:38] part of Adam. But this pride will be the
[2:16:40] word itself.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; And number two, praise God, when the
[2:16:46] devil recognized he couldn't catch the
[2:16:47] pride, he will go after the foolish
[2:16:49] virgins
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; like a roaring lion and judge them with
[2:16:52] three and a half tribulation period.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; That's the attack.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; In other words, the devil would lose the
[2:16:59] bride. The bride escaped the grip of the
[2:17:01] enemy and then the Bible said he
[2:17:03] declared war with the remnant of the
[2:17:05] woman's seed which is church members.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham watch Jesus said at this
[2:17:15] end time that the two spirit will be
[2:17:18] close together. He said this is the end
[2:17:20] time. Listen children, God have mercy
[2:17:22] upon us. He's I'm still reading. It's it
[2:17:25] would be even so real till it would
[2:17:27] deceive the very elected if possible.
[2:17:30] How are you going to how did we tell it
[2:17:32] in them days? He said now praise God.
[2:17:35] Now hear all this message when you
[2:17:37] listen to the tape even maybe I'm gone
[2:17:39] someday when the Lord is finished with
[2:17:41] me here on earth you'll refer back to
[2:17:43] this listen to my voice what I'm telling
[2:17:45] you. If he takes me before he's coming
[2:17:47] just remember I spoke to you in the name
[2:17:49] of the Lord. Notice it'll be so close it
[2:17:51] will deceive the very elected if it were
[2:17:53] possible to do the same signs and
[2:17:55] wonders. Praise God. So this battle
[2:17:57] praise God that the devil going to have
[2:18:00] going in with. Praise God. Matthew 24:24
[2:18:04] that is their five-fold ministry.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; False anointed ones.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Their congregation will be 2 Timothy 3
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; 1-9. The five for ministry of the bride
[2:18:14] will be in Ephesians 4
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; and their congregation will be in second
[2:18:17] Peter 1
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; 4-7
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; faith and virtue and knowledge and so
[2:18:21] on.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; These two spirits will come to a clash
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; in this message.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to be very clear
[2:18:28] in this message
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; a big CLASH IS COMING.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD GOING TO SEPARATE RIGHT
[2:18:33] FROM WRONG,
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; RIGHTEOUS from unrighteous. He called
[2:18:36] the foolish virgin the unrighteous. He
[2:18:37] going to separate the church from the
[2:18:39] bride. The bride that will be hewed out
[2:18:41] from the church
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; and she'll be rejected.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. What happened to this?
[2:18:46] What is this bride about? She's a bride
[2:18:48] that is walking by revelation or by
[2:18:50] faith.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; By faith, Abel offered unto God a more
[2:18:52] excellent sacrifice and came. And Jesus
[2:18:55] said, "Upon this rock, I'll build my
[2:18:57] church and the gates of hell will not
[2:18:58] prevail against it." So, it was
[2:19:00] revelation. He said, "What is faith?"
[2:19:02] Faith is something revealed to you that
[2:19:03] is not yet what you believe it will be.
[2:19:05] Faith is a revelation of the will of
[2:19:08] God. Isn't that right? So this bride
[2:19:10] will be walking by revelation. Not you
[2:19:12] hear what going on in this church. You
[2:19:13] hear what this pastor say and you're
[2:19:14] going back and forth and back tossed to
[2:19:16] and fro. That's not revelation.
[2:19:18] Revelation when God speaks to you. Not
[2:19:20] when you get something on WhatsApp. Not
[2:19:22] when you get something on Tik Tok.
[2:19:23] Praise God. I want to go back to
[2:19:24] something I was saying. Didn't finish.
[2:19:27] Now come back to my mind.
[2:19:29] In Rome they were giving people free
[2:19:31] grain and entertainment. And I write a
[2:19:34] man was saying that's what's happening
[2:19:36] right now. Tik Tok and all these things
[2:19:38] people scrolling. I see people selling
[2:19:39] things inside the road and instead of
[2:19:40] watching and saying come and buy the Tik
[2:19:41] Toking
[2:19:44] you have to stop and buy and say you
[2:19:45] want to buy something you know they're
[2:19:46] not interested in selling you know
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; this entertaining them
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; free food and entertainment free checks
[2:19:52] and entertainment that's what the devil
[2:19:55] have Facebook Tik Tok scrolling all kind
[2:19:59] of them small thing small in and YouTube
[2:20:02] what they call it real
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; shorts
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; shorts shorts because people mind they
[2:20:06] can't take long like not taking shorts
[2:20:09] social media, all kind of cuckoo thing.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me somebody say if you're
[2:20:14] in boy scouts will sign up to train an
[2:20:16] army. If you use a caps gun, all kind of
[2:20:19] thing just to make joke, fun, anything
[2:20:21] you think about entertainment.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; If you don't want basketball, you have
[2:20:26] football. You know football, you have
[2:20:27] cricket. If you don't cricket, you have
[2:20:29] net ball. If you name it, they have a
[2:20:32] full full of offense.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; You have enough sense in your head. This
[2:20:36] is not progressing. This not helping
[2:20:37] you.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; People who really progressive and think
[2:20:41] have no time for their foolishness. You
[2:20:42] know, they're not even on Facebook.
[2:20:43] They're not on these things.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; You know what friend requests I get? I
[2:20:50] have no friends.
[2:20:56] I have nothing against friends and
[2:20:58] friends and friends and family. I have
[2:21:01] none.
[2:21:03] Not one. No. Not one. [laughter]
[2:21:07] Ton people send me friendship friendship
[2:21:09] friendship I don't have time
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; to think friend think I I don't have
[2:21:14] sorry
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; maybe I just too busy
[2:21:18] praise God amen
[2:21:22] I close him I want you to know this for
[2:21:25] sure you that listen to this tape
[2:21:28] I have no more to do with this than
[2:21:30] nothing no more than just a voice I
[2:21:33] wanted to be a trapper but it's the will
[2:21:35] of my father that I declared to do and
[2:21:37] determined to do. I wasn't the one that
[2:21:39] appeared down at the river. I was only
[2:21:40] standing there when it happened.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that performed these
[2:21:43] things and fortell these things that
[2:21:44] happened as perfect as they are. I am
[2:21:46] only one that was near when he does it.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; I was only a voice that he used to say
[2:21:51] it. It wasn't what I knew. It was I what
[2:21:54] I surrendered myself to
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; that he spoke through. It isn't me. It
[2:21:57] wasn't the seven angel. No, it's the
[2:21:59] manifestation of the son of man.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the angel his message. It was
[2:22:03] a mystery that God unfolded. It's not a
[2:22:06] man. It's God. The angel was not the son
[2:22:09] of man. He was the messenger from the
[2:22:10] son of man. The son of man is Christ. He
[2:22:13] is the one you are feeding on.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're not feeding on a man.
[2:22:17] His words will fail, but you are feeding
[2:22:19] on the unfailing body word of the son of
[2:22:22] man."
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; And then he begins to pray. He said,
[2:22:24] "Dear father, this is a hard thing. It's
[2:22:26] not easy for mortal to do it. Thou
[2:22:29] knowest all things. And I pray thee,
[2:22:31] dear God, that will not be
[2:22:33] misunderstood. Father God, I know I
[2:22:36] don't know who the elected is. Thou
[2:22:39] knowest. I know, I don't know when your
[2:22:41] coming is. I only know that you said
[2:22:44] when this takes place. These false
[2:22:47] anointed ones, not right when they
[2:22:49] started. Moses just let him alone for he
[2:22:52] could do no more about it. He could only
[2:22:54] say what you were saying. You told him
[2:22:56] call fleas and he called them. You told
[2:22:58] him, "Turn the water to blood." Then he
[2:22:59] did it. Moses only carried word by word.
[2:23:01] No father, you are God. Yet the same
[2:23:04] word said that this would happen in the
[2:23:06] last days. Many honest persons we said
[2:23:08] last morning putting their hands on that
[2:23:10] ark upon the new cart, not upon the
[2:23:12] shoulder of Levi, fell dead. Many
[2:23:14] ministers sitting in the study read that
[2:23:15] word and change the page quick to keep
[2:23:18] from having to blast out to know he
[2:23:20] would lose his social standing with the
[2:23:21] public with his church and with his
[2:23:23] denomination. God, help us never to do
[2:23:24] that. Amen.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; Then he said these words, "Cleanse our
[2:23:28] heart, Lord,
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; from all the filth of the world, Lord. I
[2:23:31] stand ready for cleansing. I stand ready
[2:23:34] with this church, with all that is
[2:23:36] listening in. And whoever will listen to
[2:23:38] this tape, I stand, Lord, and ask for
[2:23:40] cleansing. Lord, take me to the potter's
[2:23:43] house and break me and moan me, a
[2:23:46] servant that you want." For Lord Jesus,
[2:23:48] I'm a man of unclean lips. Isaiah cried,
[2:23:51] dwelling with the people of unclean
[2:23:52] lips, "so is me. I see revelation of God
[2:23:54] being made manifest. Let's all [music]
[2:23:56] stand. I see the end time, Lord. Woe is
[2:23:58] me and my family. Woe is me and my
[2:24:00] people. Oh, eternal God, have mercy upon
[2:24:02] us. I plead for myself and the people.
[2:24:04] Let us not perish with those who believe
[2:24:06] not, but may we live with the believers.
[2:24:09] Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[2:24:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Lord, we praise
[2:24:14] you this morning. And we thank you for
[2:24:15] your word this morning. May you have
[2:24:16] your own way and bless your people. Oh,
[2:24:19] glory to God. Have your way in Jesus
[2:24:21] name. Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. YES, LORD.
[2:24:27] YES, LORD.
