[40:11] all right iy 8: 1-20 and then 9:
[40:16] 1-4 this is
[40:19] um uh because we're talking about the
[40:21] kingdom of God and what um was always
[40:25] the comp of the kingdom of God anyway we
[40:27] we'll get to you let me not keep you
[40:29] standing too long um Deuteronomy 8 and
[40:32] verse1 okay like I've explained over and
[40:34] over and like as you know if you like
[40:36] you know uh um get your Bible and study
[40:39] it and know what this the history and
[40:42] things are Moses wrote the first um five
[40:46] books of the Bible Genesis
[40:49] Exodus numbers and
[40:51] Deuteronomy and um the children of
[40:55] Israel you know wanted Journey to the
[40:56] promised land and the whole 34 or so
[41:01] chapters of Deuteronomy took place in a
[41:03] period of one to two weeks just one to
[41:05] two weeks because what it was was Moses
[41:08] was doing a review of their journey and
[41:12] their existence in the kingdom of God
[41:16] and they were now going to enter the
[41:18] land that's flown with milk and honey
[41:20] the Land of Plenty the land where there
[41:21] was going to be a flow and so he wanted
[41:24] to remind them of many things and in the
[41:27] book of Deuteronomy a lot of times it
[41:29] was said like and remember don't forget
[41:33] remember don't forget remember don't
[41:36] forget because God knows what's going to
[41:39] happen in the in the in the new land
[41:42] could make them forget him and so he won
[41:45] them ahead of time and all of these
[41:48] things took place in one or two weeks
[41:50] and this was like in the 11th month of
[41:53] the 48th year after they left Egypt and
[41:56] um they spend the the last week of that
[41:59] 11th month to mourn Moses and in the
[42:02] first week of the 41st
[42:05] year the record is that or history says
[42:09] that Israel entered the promised land

[44:17] to hunger that they were hungry was
[44:20] because they were in the wilderness or
[44:21] because God couldn't provide food in the
[44:23] wilderness come
[44:25] on he brought water from a rock he sent
[44:28] Mana from Heaven he he he could have
[44:31] given them a fat cow proess every single
[44:34] minute but God withheld that for a
[44:38] purpose he had a purpose in withholding
[44:41] that to Humble them he actually let them
[44:46] go hungry for a
[44:51] purpose and he humbled thee and suffer
[44:54] thee to to hunger and and fed thee with
[44:56] manner this is God speaking and telling
[45:00] them what was going to the purpose the
[45:03] reason why not what others are saying
[45:07] but what the prophet Moses the
[45:09] mouthpiece of God was telling
[45:12] them and he humbled thee and suffer thee
[45:15] to hunger and fed thee with
[45:17] manner which thou knewest not you didn't

[45:38] do with that it's actually said call no
[45:42] man here father it doesn't mean we
[45:44] disrespect the parents but God's purpose
[45:46] is all to keep our eyes on him is he
[45:50] wants to be the source the only one in
[45:53] our
[45:54] orbit he wants to be the champion of Our
[45:58] Lives he say I'm a jealous God I don't
[46:01] want to share with anybody at all come

[46:14] that he might make thee know that man do
[46:18] not live by bread alone bread only Jesus
[46:21] quoted this but by every word that
[46:24] proceeded out of the mouth of the Lord
[46:27] do man live so all of this hunger all of
[46:31] these difficulties in the wilderness had
[46:34] one purpose to turn their eyes on the
[46:38] cross to turn their eyes on God to turn
[46:40] their eyes on
[46:42] [Applause]
[46:44] Jesus not to complain not to mumble
[46:47] Israel complained plenty but this is God
[46:49] telling them now the reason why they
[46:52] were sh of food sometimes they were sh
[46:54] of water sometimes he wanted he tells
[46:56] them he wanted to get to their hearts to
[46:59] that they might know that man does not
[47:00] leave by bread alone but by every word

[59:30] already verse
[59:32] 14 let me RSE again when th hurs and thy
[59:35] floods multiply and thy silver and thy
[59:37] gold is
[59:38] Multiplied and all that thy H is
[59:40] Multiplied then thine heart shall be Li
[59:43] then then thy heart be lifted up and
[59:44] thou forget the Lord thy God which
[59:46] brought thee forth out of the land of
[59:47] Egypt from the house of
[59:49] bondage who led thee through the that
[59:52] great and terrible wilderness
[59:55] wherein were fiery serpents and
[59:57] scorpions and drought where there was no
[1:00:00] water who brought thee forth water out
[1:00:02] of the rock of
[1:00:03] Flint speak to the
[1:00:06] rock it could have just spoken and and a
[1:00:11] seven course menu will be there all your
[1:00:14] all your all your fantastic eies in v
[1:00:19] and Ley all that will just appear before
[1:00:22] he could have spoken all that but he
[1:00:23] didn't do it for purpose
[1:00:25] because you want them to know they
[1:00:26] needed him want them to be able to sing
[1:00:28] to him I need him now more than ever
[1:00:30] before I need him now more than I ever
[1:00:33] did in my life oh I need Jesus now more
[1:00:36] than ever more than ever I need Jesus
[1:00:38] that's what he was trying to drum into
[1:00:49] them who fath in the wilderness with
[1:00:51] manner verse 16 which the father s knew
[1:00:54] not he's repeating that to them again
[1:00:57] that he might humble thee and that he
[1:01:00] might prove thee to do the good at thy
[1:01:04] latter end are you at your latter end
[1:01:06] you think it's too late no it's never
[1:01:08] too late it was all God's hands look
[1:01:11] nothing happens to you everything
[1:01:14] happens for you if you only know the
[1:01:17] reason the purpose why those things
[1:01:20] happen and it's all in the
[1:01:23] Bible the Bible tells me so the Bible
[1:01:27] has all the answers it's not a story
[1:01:30] it's not just a story the story of
[1:01:32] redemption it is real brother it is real
[1:01:35] sister the story of
[1:01:37] redemption oh
[1:01:40] brother
[1:01:43] amen now
[1:01:45] watch but thou shall remember the Lord
[1:01:47] thy
[1:01:48] God oh oh no verse verse verse 17 to
[1:01:52] prove they the L the latter end so it's
[1:01:54] never too
[1:01:54] late get that there there are things
[1:01:58] anyway verse 17 and so when you have all
[1:02:01] these things going for you and you begin
[1:02:03] to say in thine heart my power and the
[1:02:06] might of my hand have gotten me this
[1:02:09] wealth God telling them you are going to
[1:02:11] a land of
[1:02:14] wealth not
[1:02:16] riches
[1:02:17] wealth the Bible warns against riches
[1:02:21] because the rich only think about
[1:02:23] accumulating money
[1:02:26] the wealthy think about getting wealth
[1:02:29] which is really the what there is not
[1:02:31] get is creating
[1:02:37] wealth sorry you got to forgive me I got
[1:02:40] to my jacket
[1:02:49] okay are these air conditioners on okay
[1:02:53] but it's okay I think I leave them the
[1:02:54] sisters can get cold too cold sometimes
[1:02:56] so I'll I'll manage all
[1:03:02] right
[1:03:08] um and thus seeing then have verse 17
[1:03:11] that my power and the mind of my hand ha
[1:03:13] gotten me this wealth my degree my this
[1:03:16] my that my skills my my whatever my this
[1:03:20] have gotten me this wealth wealth I mean
[1:03:22] and when we didn't do that many times
[1:03:23] it's just you know very good very good
[1:03:26] pay or something not talking wealthy air
[1:03:30] but even when you talk wealthy air is
[1:03:31] one you don't get the the power of my
[1:03:34] hands got me this don't get there and
[1:03:37] you'll understand as I go on in the
[1:03:40] story all
[1:03:43] right but thou shall remember the Lord
[1:03:45] thy God for it is he that giveth thee
[1:03:48] power to get wealth now that word get in
[1:03:52] the Greek really is to create at wealth
[1:03:55] because get when you say I get it from
[1:03:57] you it's like somebody's getting
[1:03:58] something and somebody's losing
[1:03:59] something get wealth get it like deprive
[1:04:02] somebody or something and I get it no
[1:04:03] it's the creation of wealth that's what
[1:04:07] they that's what uh um the Greek really
[1:04:11] expounds to you and
[1:04:13] I or the original you know um
[1:04:17] verse for it is he that giveth thee
[1:04:20] power to create wealth that you may
[1:04:24] establish his
[1:04:25] Covenant which is swear unto thy fathers
[1:04:28] at it as it is this day and it shall
[1:04:32] be if thou do do at all

[1:04:40] other gods when you full and you are

[1:04:47] and and worship them I testify against
[1:04:51] you this day that you shall surely

[1:15:44] Nations the Lord brought uh the Nations
[1:15:47] that the Lord do do the Lord do drive
[1:15:49] them out from before the like we were
[1:15:51] speaking last week go wanted Israel to
[1:15:53] be paric with him to fulfill his word to
[1:15:55] the amorites when their sins are full
[1:15:57] God will destroy them and give the land
[1:15:59] to Abraham's seed but Israel's unbelief
[1:16:02] in spite of this
[1:16:03] admonition in spite of all the preaching
[1:16:06] in spite of all the admonition people
[1:16:08] are so bent in their own evil
[1:16:14] ways not for the righteousness verse
[1:16:18] 5 or for the uprightness of thine heart
[1:16:21] does thou go to possess their land but
[1:16:24] for the wickedness of these nations the
[1:16:26] Lord thy God doth drive them out from
[1:16:28] before thee that he may perform the word
[1:16:31] which the Lord spake swear unto thy
[1:16:33] fathers Abraham Isaac and
[1:16:35] Jacob understand therefore that the Lord
[1:16:38] thy God giveth thee not this good land
[1:16:40] to possess you for thy righteousness for
[1:16:43] thou are a stiff necked people and he
[1:16:45] went on on like that may Lord his BL the
[1:16:48] of his holy
[1:16:50] words
[1:16:52] amen
[1:16:56] let me just read quickly con scripture I
[1:16:57] have Exodus
[1:16:59] 9:37 and mo went up to God this was
[1:17:01] where God was going to establish a
[1:17:04] covenant with Israel to he brought them
[1:17:07] out of Egypt to be a people a nation to
[1:17:10] himself a nation where God and his
[1:17:12] people and they're going to have a
[1:17:14] system of government where God was going
[1:17:15] to be their God and going to speak to
[1:17:17] them through his prophet and he was
[1:17:19] going to take care of them them all they
[1:17:21] had to do was follow him wholly
[1:17:23] there going to be a royal priesthood it
[1:17:25] was going to be a nation of priests it
[1:17:28] was when that failed when the people
[1:17:30] quickly fail that's when God turn over
[1:17:33] to the tribe of Levi Aaron's children
[1:17:36] and made them a tribe of of of priests
[1:17:40] but when Christ died and rose again what
[1:17:43] Israel refused to be the New Testament
[1:17:46] Church the bread of Jesus Christ now is
[1:17:50] 1 Peter 2:9 I think I think I read it
[1:17:52] last week for you I Ro show forth the
[1:17:54] glory to show forth
[1:17:58] his thus shall thou say to the house of
[1:18:01] Jacob and tell the children of
[1:18:03] Israel you have seen what I did unto the
[1:18:05] Egyptians and how I bear you on eagles
[1:18:08] wings and brought you unto
[1:18:12] myself now therefore if you will obey my
[1:18:15] voice inde did and keep my Covenant then
[1:18:17] you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[1:18:19] above all the people for all the Earth
[1:18:22] is mine
[1:18:24] amen and you shall be unto me a kingdom
[1:18:27] of priests that's where it was not just
[1:18:29] a tribe of a kingdom of priests and an
[1:18:32] holy
[1:18:33] nation these are the words which thou
[1:18:35] shallal speak unto the children of
[1:18:36] Israel and Moses came and call for the
[1:18:39] Elders of the people and laid be and
[1:18:42] laid before their faces all these words
[1:18:44] which the Lord commanded commanded him
[1:18:45] and like Israel said all that the Lord
[1:18:47] has said we will do and quickly they
[1:18:49] violated
[1:18:50] it but Jesus restored the this back and
[1:18:54] made us 1 Peter 2:9 a kingdom of priests
[1:18:57] we are priests and Kings unto our
[1:19:01] God a holy nation a royal
[1:19:04] priesthood we don't need no set high
[1:19:07] priest to come before the Lord we don't
[1:19:08] need the th me we have the word of God
[1:19:10] and we have Jesus the high priest of our
[1:19:12] confession that can lead us into the god
[1:19:15] plan of God not once a year but any time
[1:19:17] any any hour of a day or night we are
[1:19:21] free to come into His presence we is
[1:19:23] royal priesthood A peculiar people what
[1:19:25] he wanted to display with Israel is not
[1:19:28] displaying with his bride but
[1:19:30] unfortunately many people in The Bride
[1:19:33] just like Israel of
[1:19:35] old all right so this morning um um um I
[1:19:40] spent long time already like 30 minutes
[1:19:42] reading the scriptures but we pick up
[1:19:45] from where we left last Sunday about the
[1:19:47] kingdom of God being a theocracy which
[1:19:50] is God's form and system of government
[1:19:52] can you see God God bring this people
[1:19:53] out God is a god of order he brought
[1:19:55] them out so there's a government there's
[1:19:57] a chain of command there's a hierarchy
[1:19:59] of command there's a line of authority
[1:20:02] not a line of superiority line of
[1:20:04] authority from God to Moses to the
[1:20:08] Elders of the people Aon and the Elders
[1:20:10] of the people down to their tribes God
[1:20:12] is a god of
[1:20:14] order God's system of government a
[1:20:17] theocracy and theocracy had always been
[1:20:19] God's um system of government since the
[1:20:23] gun of Eden because God desire was to be
[1:20:26] with his people God in Christ Christ in
[1:20:28] the bride God in authority and in
[1:20:31] Supremacy and in pinenes in their lives
[1:20:34] that's all you
[1:20:36] desire so this was the system of
[1:20:39] government even in Eden a theocracy we
[1:20:42] have a democracy today in Many Nations
[1:20:45] and you know I'll get to that
[1:20:49] so as CH went on from from Eden and the
[1:20:54] fall all nations develop all other forms
[1:20:57] of government the
[1:20:59] monarchy Empires federalism socialism
[1:21:03] communism
[1:21:05] democracy and number of those are still
[1:21:07] in existence till today because you see
[1:21:10] that when Israel went to Egypt Egypt was
[1:21:13] ruled by a king not a theocracy they had
[1:21:16] a human King and when Israel said to the
[1:21:20] prophet Samuel we want to be like the
[1:21:21] other nations
[1:21:25] so God's people had a different set of
[1:21:28] rules and government to govern and guide
[1:21:31] them guide their lives because they were
[1:21:33] supposed to be a peculiar people to him
[1:21:37] not odd and peculiar people but a
[1:21:39] peculiar peculiar as in
[1:21:44] special the hand and the grace and the
[1:21:46] favor of God was upon them and anybody
[1:21:49] saw them could see the favor of God upon
[1:21:51] their lives amen men could see them and
[1:21:54] glorify their father in Heaven like they
[1:21:57] saw Jesus Jesus was in the temple the
[1:22:00] favor of God was he was a peculiar human
[1:22:03] being he was a royal person the The
[1:22:06] Whispers went around the Tabernacle and
[1:22:10] they said blessed be the womb that bore
[1:22:13] thee it was that
[1:22:16] special what manner of man is this here
[1:22:19] what manner of man is this the home that
[1:22:23] carried you was special blessed be the
[1:22:26] that's what God wants us to be and the
[1:22:28] child grew and increased stature and in
[1:22:31] favor with both God and man that's what
[1:22:34] we're supposed to
[1:22:36] [Music]
[1:22:37] [Applause]
[1:22:44] be but whatever the Sy of government of
[1:22:47] those Nations they all have a common
[1:22:50] theme common theme whether was Fidelis
[1:22:54] monarchy um Empire status at the time of
[1:22:59] Jesus the empire was Rome ruling over
[1:23:03] and had like you know Governors over the
[1:23:05] different places whatever the system of
[1:23:07] government socialism communism democracy
[1:23:11] whatever the same of
[1:23:12] government they all have a common theme
[1:23:16] and that common theme was around some
[1:23:18] form of quote unquote disguised slavery
[1:23:23] of the mass majority of the population
[1:23:25] no matter what the Bible's words I'll
[1:23:27] show
[1:23:29] you and this disguised slavery is
[1:23:31] summarized in 1 Samuel
[1:23:34] 8 and that's the summary that God gave
[1:23:36] Samuel when Israel rejected him and
[1:23:39] requested for a form of government like
[1:23:42] the other nations have and Sam was sad
[1:23:45] that the people are rejected him and go
[1:23:47] said no
[1:23:48] Samuel it's not you they
[1:23:51] rejected you're not the king you're only
[1:23:54] the prophet and the judge but I'm the
[1:23:56] king I tell you and you tell them but
[1:23:59] it's not you the re ultimately I'm the
[1:24:01] one they have
[1:24:03] rejected just like they mmed against
[1:24:06] Moses and God said it's not Moses Moses
[1:24:08] said you are not Ming against me you are
[1:24:10] mming against
[1:24:12] God say it's God there God said someone
[1:24:16] step aside it's me they are rejected not
[1:24:20] you and the one came give let let let
[1:24:23] them have their heart's desire let them
[1:24:25] have their wish give them a
[1:24:29] king but let me tell
[1:24:32] them what the manner of King they're
[1:24:36] going to have let me tell them what the
[1:24:39] king whoever the king is saw or whoever
[1:24:42] whatever is going to be go through
[1:24:43] Israel's history whether it was Judah or
[1:24:46] Israel whatever the northern kingdom
[1:24:48] Southern Kingdom and watch how many of
[1:24:50] the Kings really serve God
[1:24:55] watch how many of the Nations the world
[1:24:57] really align themselves with God hardly
[1:25:00] any so he was talking not just about
[1:25:03] that day he was talking about of all
[1:25:04] times the kind of the kind of government
[1:25:08] they are going to have when they reject
[1:25:10] is making clear God's type of government
[1:25:13] and the human type of government
[1:25:14] whatever you want to call it US
[1:25:16] democracy social democracy you know uh
[1:25:19] um um tury democracy what ever you know
[1:25:23] Islamic whatever it's whatever system of
[1:25:26] government Russian communism Socialism
[1:25:29] or whatever they call it now you know
[1:25:33] whatever it
[1:25:35] is God
[1:25:36] summarized and gave
[1:25:39] them the characteristics of that
[1:25:42] government what that government was
[1:25:43] going to look
[1:25:45] like I won read you can read that you
[1:25:47] can read it 1 Samuel chter 8 the whole
[1:25:50] chapter vers 1- 22 I'll show you what
[1:25:53] they let tell them what they are going
[1:25:55] for when they reject my type of
[1:26:01] government and he told them is some form
[1:26:04] of organized slavery your sons your
[1:26:06] daughters and all that you can read it
[1:26:08] your
[1:26:09] time so but before Israel got to that
[1:26:12] spot where they asked to be like all
[1:26:15] nations God was their King they lived in
[1:26:17] God's economy they lived in God's
[1:26:19] theocracy system of government God was
[1:26:22] their ruler their king and the head of
[1:26:24] their government in each of their lives
[1:26:27] as individuals and in the home as a
[1:26:30] collective and in the nation as a
[1:26:32] nation God was their lord and
[1:26:35] King
[1:26:36] amen and God's form of government from
[1:26:41] Eden was always a
[1:26:43] theocracy before the fall and even after
[1:26:46] the fall God kept a theocracy in place
[1:26:50] with only minor variations to suit uh uh
[1:26:54] that was dictated the divisions were by
[1:26:56] the um Covenant we have with his people
[1:26:59] whether it was you know a conditional
[1:27:01] Covenant or it was a unconditional
[1:27:03] Covenant it was always there in place
[1:27:06] that theocr God the head and the people
[1:27:10] he is
[1:27:12] subjects not subjects like the Gentiles
[1:27:14] do but his subjects who will love him
[1:27:16] and he will be in love with a love aair
[1:27:19] in other words partners partners like
[1:27:21] husband and wife
[1:27:23] so in God's theocracy in God's form of
[1:27:25] government the people sered him with
[1:27:27] their whole hearts and
[1:27:28] lives they live by his righteous
[1:27:33] laws that was all they had to do that
[1:27:35] was all he required them to do that was
[1:27:38] all and in response to them doing
[1:27:41] that God supplied all of their needs for
[1:27:45] food for clothing shelter so this is the
[1:27:49] backdrop all have been saying about the
[1:27:51] wilderness and all that and all this is
[1:27:54] a backdrop for Jesus saying seek ye
[1:27:57] first the kingdom of God and his
[1:27:59] righteousness let the kingdom of God be
[1:28:01] your
[1:28:03] lifestyle morning afternoon night in
[1:28:06] your sleep every time let the kingdom
[1:28:08] and the principles of the kingdom of God
[1:28:11] the righteousness of God Amen be your
[1:28:14] LIF child and when they do that God will
[1:28:18] supply all of their needs for food for
[1:28:20] clothing and for shelter
[1:28:23] and this arrangement of the theocracy
[1:28:25] worked excellently well in Eden
[1:28:30] Adam was in subjection to God God was in
[1:28:33] premen over him and he was in Prem over
[1:28:35] the Earth he had everything that he
[1:28:37] needed all I have needed thy hand I
[1:28:40] provided Great Is Thy Faithfulness
[1:28:42] morning by morning new mercies I
[1:28:50] see and this this Arrangement even after
[1:28:53] the
[1:28:55] fall that Arrangement was kept in place
[1:28:58] like I said and it was on for God's
[1:29:01] people until Israel God's chosen people
[1:29:05] rejected his theocracy his form of
[1:29:07] government and um opted for a for
[1:29:12] government by man whatever it is
[1:29:15] theocracy whatever they all the same
[1:29:17] thing some form of slavery the Communist
[1:29:19] say like that they are a collective they
[1:29:21] are like you know everybody has
[1:29:23] everything equal it's not true it's not
[1:29:24] true it's not true I read a lot of
[1:29:27] stories I read a lot of I read I read a
[1:29:29] lot of biographies autobiographies in
[1:29:32] the in the uh communist years the guys
[1:29:36] in government were living large they
[1:29:38] were living like they were living like
[1:29:40] they were living in the white
[1:29:41] house but the people on the street were
[1:29:44] living like popers for of slavery let's
[1:29:48] again to that we don't have to much time
[1:29:49] here don't want we have lot supp today
[1:29:52] all
[1:29:53] right but whatever the system of
[1:29:56] government it was all the same thing it
[1:29:57] was a form of slavery refined modified
[1:30:00] whatever it was
[1:30:02] slavery even the biggest Democrat in the
[1:30:05] world the US is a form of
[1:30:09] slavery the Americans say you just walk
[1:30:11] for Uncle
[1:30:12] Tom that's right whatever the St of
[1:30:16] government that's what it
[1:30:20] is anyway
[1:30:24] um um many examples abound in scripture
[1:30:27] both in the Old Testament and New
[1:30:29] Testament of God's people living in his
[1:30:31] theocracy in his
[1:30:33] economy and because when Israel rejected
[1:30:36] God and chose to be like all nations it
[1:30:40] devolved into in the
[1:30:43] individual having God living in God's
[1:30:47] Kingdom in his in his um uh under his
[1:30:51] form of of government a theocracy
[1:30:53] individuals not Nations now not Israel
[1:30:55] not Nations
[1:30:56] now and so the favor that will be on
[1:30:59] Israel for living the theocracy that
[1:31:01] favor now devolve onto the individuals
[1:31:03] who will live in God's
[1:31:06] economy but you got to know what that
[1:31:08] means to live in God's economy you got
[1:31:09] to know what that means because many of
[1:31:12] us claim we're living in God's economy
[1:31:13] but we're not we're living in our own
[1:31:15] economy and that's why nothing happens
[1:31:17] for us and we putay it on
[1:31:20] God and not judging you I'm just going
[1:31:22] to let you see like that so you don't
[1:31:24] think oh what I'm saying we been living
[1:31:25] in God no you have not been no you have
[1:31:26] not been no you no you have not been and
[1:31:29] I'll show it to you no you have not been
[1:31:31] so I want you to listen to me real
[1:31:33] good amen not because I'm s you don't
[1:31:36] know but maybe you have never really
[1:31:38] taken to
[1:31:41] you
[1:31:43] so let's follow um um the children of
[1:31:48] Israel as they in their Journey so will
[1:31:51] be able to understand what living in
[1:31:53] God's economy looked looked like then
[1:31:57] and what it looks like still
[1:31:59] today amen because the New Testament did
[1:32:02] not cancel out the old it only Amplified
[1:32:04] it it only expand it only magnified it
[1:32:09] but let's even see if it can get to the
[1:32:11] level the standard that they
[1:32:14] had which we supposed to live at an
[1:32:17] amplified magnified level beyond what
[1:32:20] they had
[1:32:25] so Israel you know uh let's follow their
[1:32:28] journey and they live in this theocracy
[1:32:30] just like their F father Adam lived in
[1:32:33] like their father Abram and the
[1:32:35] Patriarchs their forefathers lived in
[1:32:38] but quickly before we get to Israel Adam
[1:32:41] in the beginning lived in God's economy
[1:32:42] in a
[1:32:43] theocracy all Adam and Eve Leed to do
[1:32:46] and same thing same principle same set
[1:32:50] of rules same set of laws that governed
[1:32:53] it same thing that economy works in your
[1:32:57] heart the same way works in my heart
[1:33:00] some Nation practice democracy different
[1:33:02] from the next nation and they all
[1:33:03] practicing democracy you know our nation
[1:33:06] we have democracy we copy the American
[1:33:07] St of
[1:33:08] democracy tell me another
[1:33:12] one I sometime we CH to call it
[1:33:15] homegrown
[1:33:20] democrac
[1:33:22] why don't understand about people and
[1:33:23] that's what you guys a lot of you people
[1:33:25] did during the elections and you get
[1:33:28] into that racial bigotry thing people
[1:33:31] who belong to the nation the kingdom of
[1:33:34] God because of some politicians because
[1:33:38] of their tribe they stepped out of the
[1:33:40] kingdom of God and started attacking one
[1:33:42] another in the same home who come to the
[1:33:45] same lot table like we're going to do
[1:33:50] tonight
[1:34:02] all Adam and Eve needed to do was to
[1:34:05] serve God fully and holy because this
[1:34:07] system was the same
[1:34:10] thing is the same principle in Eden as
[1:34:14] it is in Your Heart Right
[1:34:16] Now Nigerian democracy under bhari is
[1:34:19] different from under
[1:34:20] tinubu
[1:34:22] American democracy under Donald Trump
[1:34:24] from
[1:34:26] under Biden because the principles they
[1:34:29] say are the same but the man runs it the
[1:34:31] way he fits his
[1:34:33] agenda one supports
[1:34:35] lgbtq one says no one supports big
[1:34:39] government one supports small government
[1:34:41] one supports Social Services one says no
[1:34:44] and they all practicing democracy but
[1:34:47] not God God is the same constant
[1:34:52] it doesn't change I am the Lord I change
[1:34:55] not what he said at the beginning is
[1:34:57] always the same he doesn't have a better
[1:35:01] idea than he had at the start because
[1:35:03] he's the perfect one that's the kingdom
[1:35:05] we belong to the kingdom of the most
[1:35:07] high the kingdom of the most high no
[1:35:11] shadow of variableness with it no
[1:35:16] variability no variableness no changing
[1:35:19] according to the Shadows in this Kia
[1:35:22] remains constant as constant as constant
[1:35:26] as constant can be as constant as the
[1:35:30] northern stair
[1:35:33] amen so all ad man even to do was to
[1:35:35] serve God fully and holy live in his
[1:35:38] righteousness that was always there seek
[1:35:41] ye
[1:35:42] first the kingdom of God and his
[1:35:45] righteousness and all they needed
[1:35:48] everything they needed for living
[1:35:50] natural and spirit spiritual life was
[1:35:52] added to
[1:35:53] them because the operative verb the op
[1:35:58] operative spirit in this kingdom is a
[1:36:01] kingdom of addition is a kingdom of
[1:36:03] increase it's a kingdom of abundance
[1:36:06] that's the Opera what in this kingdom
[1:36:07] here is not subtraction it's
[1:36:10] abundance it don't take from you that's
[1:36:13] slavery they take from you you may not
[1:36:16] be a SL they take from
[1:36:20] you
[1:36:23] but in God's kingdom he adds to you
[1:36:25] serve him and he adds to you and his
[1:36:28] kingdom in your heart of his of his
[1:36:30] increase there shall be no End Amen we
[1:36:34] receive a kingdom which shallot be
[1:36:35] shaken everything is going to be shaken
[1:36:37] but a kingdom we receive cannot be
[1:36:39] shaken the kingdom of the most high God
[1:36:43] which kingdom has sent you fora as Moses
[1:36:46] with his crooked Seck he said the
[1:36:48] kingdom of the most high the kingdom of
[1:36:50] the most high oh Hallelujah I have a

[1:37:40] godliness was added to them food a home
[1:37:44] a shelter a beautiful Garden of Eden for
[1:37:47] life was added to
[1:37:49] them the authority and the control of
[1:37:52] the earth that they needed to exercise
[1:37:55] on the Earth in God's stead as amatal
[1:37:58] God's creators innovators with wisdom on
[1:38:01] this Earth here was added to them for
[1:38:04] godliness oh
[1:38:07] hallelujah amen Adam's life before the
[1:38:10] fall demonstrated what God was like you
[1:38:14] may be
[1:38:17] seated Adam's Adam's life before the
[1:38:20] fall demonstrated the goodness of God
[1:38:23] the mercy of God Adams Liv with God and
[1:38:26] viewed God through the lens of goodness
[1:38:29] many of you view view God through the
[1:38:31] god of a strick father who just has a
[1:38:33] stick when you do anything wrong he's
[1:38:35] breaking your head Adam did not see that
[1:38:37] kind of a god Adam saw a father who was
[1:38:39] a good father he punishes sin but that's
[1:38:42] when you don't listen to his words when
[1:38:44] you don't listen to his warnings but in
[1:38:46] his basic relationship with his children
[1:38:48] he's a good God I say he's a good God
[1:38:51] isn't he amen wisdom is a good God isn't

[1:40:12] like his goodness his Mercy his kindness
[1:40:15] his loving and tender care towards his
[1:40:18] children toward all of his creation
[1:40:21] and his provision for them and his
[1:40:24] ability to provide for them in super
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:33] abundance and so Adam and Eve
[1:40:36] prospered I not lack one thing until the
[1:40:40] fall Abram and the
[1:40:43] Patriarchs they also lived in God
[1:40:45] economy under theocracy and they
[1:40:49] prospered
[1:40:51] all they do was chased after God not
[1:40:56] chased after these things that the
[1:40:58] Gentiles chased after chased after
[1:41:01] God and all these things that J has
[1:41:03] chasen after were added unto
[1:41:06] them it comes with a
[1:41:17] territory Moses and the Hebrew children
[1:41:20] let's follow this nation of Israel now
[1:41:21] and going to listen to me really really
[1:41:23] Clos and if it's if it gets to too late
[1:41:25] I'll close I mean I want you need to get
[1:41:27] this so you'll be able to understand
[1:41:29] where you are right now so you to
[1:41:32] understand how to make the kingdom of
[1:41:34] God work for you even in a tough economy
[1:41:37] even the if you work for them in the
[1:41:39] wilderness sure it can work for you
[1:41:41] [Music]
[1:41:44] here and how it will work for you and
[1:41:48] you begin to create wealth
[1:41:51] that's what the promised land
[1:41:55] represented for he gives you power to
[1:41:59] create
[1:42:06] wealth remember that the children of
[1:42:08] Israel the Hebrew children were slaves
[1:42:10] in Egypt Moses
[1:42:13] was the next to the throne he gave all
[1:42:16] that up and joined the M do as the
[1:42:19] slaves
[1:42:24] they was SL in Egypt but even at
[1:42:27] that God made sure they not live by
[1:42:30] Egypt's
[1:42:31] economy instead they live by a totally
[1:42:34] different set of rules in God's economy
[1:42:36] in the land of Goan you might not know
[1:42:38] it from the economics because they were
[1:42:40] slaves they were limited in what they
[1:42:43] could do on the economic front but in
[1:42:46] terms of the politics of the day in
[1:42:48] terms of the uh uh the wars of the day
[1:42:52] the the disasters the natural disasters
[1:42:55] of the day the judgments the plagues God
[1:42:57] showed the living totally different
[1:42:59] economy because while all the plagues
[1:43:00] were falling in Egypt the land of Goan
[1:43:02] was
[1:43:03] protected he didn't come near them a
[1:43:06] thousand can follow your right and
[1:43:08] 10,000 the left hand but it shall not
[1:43:09] come neither how many still believe
[1:43:13] that how many still believe
[1:43:15] [Applause]
[1:43:19] that
[1:43:22] the economic and political Wars and
[1:43:25] plagues all of disasters that were fing
[1:43:27] in Egypt did not touch
[1:43:30] them but notice notice this very one
[1:43:34] important
[1:43:35] notice even though and this is very
[1:43:38] important CU that's going to be a theme
[1:43:40] right down to this day even though they
[1:43:43] live by God's economy but but because
[1:43:46] they were
[1:43:47] slaves the economy of men the go
[1:43:50] government of man that Israel opted for
[1:43:53] later because they were
[1:43:59] slaves it's important that I point out
[1:44:01] to you that the economic circumstances
[1:44:04] because they were slaves were such that
[1:44:06] they never had
[1:44:08] enough they had food to eat because they
[1:44:11] go got make sure about that because they
[1:44:13] were in the wilderness they were
[1:44:14] boasting to Moses we would to go we went
[1:44:17] back to Egypt and to the gaks and G Al
[1:44:20] and onions of Egypt but they never said
[1:44:22] they never had enough which slave has
[1:44:26] enough no that's the system of these
[1:44:29] economies they never had
[1:44:31] enough but at least they had the licks
[1:44:33] and garlics and but once they had in the
[1:44:35] wilderness that's why when it comes to
[1:44:36] church their AR are so different when it
[1:44:38] gets to Egypt they're so grateful for
[1:44:40] the little that they
[1:44:41] have and they are boasting about
[1:44:44] it when it comes to God they say you you
[1:44:46] told us this you where's the milk FL
[1:44:49] with milk and honey hang
[1:44:54] [Music]
[1:44:54] [Applause]
[1:44:55] [Music]
[1:44:58] on
[1:45:00] hall
[1:45:02] hallelujah
[1:45:03] amen so even though they live in God's
[1:45:06] economy that ensured they had food but
[1:45:08] because they were slaves as it is in
[1:45:11] these economies they never had
[1:45:15] enough in terms of having their nement
[1:45:17] they never had enough which slave has
[1:45:20] enough
[1:45:21] but the God is El Shai you know what El
[1:45:23] Shai means a double breasted one
[1:45:25] Hallelujah the god of more than
[1:45:29] enough which is in the promised land not
[1:45:32] even in the
[1:45:33] wilderness they never had enough in
[1:45:35] terms of having their need men simply
[1:45:37] why because they were slaves they were
[1:45:40] God's people but they were
[1:45:43] slaves
[1:45:44] Hall and they were F
[1:45:47] simply by God's provision through the
[1:45:50] whims of others all the people
[1:45:53] determined their pay what they were
[1:45:55] worth what they got the food they ate
[1:45:58] their task Masters because that's the
[1:46:01] economy of
[1:46:02] man and they never had
[1:46:10] enough but at least God s to it that
[1:46:12] they were
[1:46:14] fed and then they moved out God's Mighty
[1:46:17] hand broke down the barriers the ch
[1:46:21] of bondage in Egypt and they moved out
[1:46:23] in the wilderness Journey to the
[1:46:24] promised
[1:46:25] land and Moes and the Hebrew children
[1:46:28] the children of Hebrews Contin to live
[1:46:30] in and by the economy of
[1:46:33] God in the
[1:46:36] wilderness
[1:46:38] still it was God's provision not what
[1:46:41] they had to do themselves not what they
[1:46:43] had to do
[1:46:44] themselves under the economy of
[1:46:47] man it was the whims of others what
[1:46:50] others thought they deserve is what they
[1:46:52] gave them the Egyptians gave them food
[1:46:54] even though they lived in God's economy
[1:46:57] when it came down to the Brass jaacks
[1:46:59] the plagues and things didn't touch them
[1:47:01] but because they were slaves they didn't
[1:47:02] have the capability or the capacity or
[1:47:04] the opportunity to provide food for
[1:47:07] themselves and so God ensured that they
[1:47:09] had
[1:47:10] enough I mean they had food but was
[1:47:13] never really enough because no slave
[1:47:15] ever has
[1:47:18] enough but in the wilderness
[1:47:21] even though they live I mean they they
[1:47:22] they came out and they were living under
[1:47:24] the economy of of God now directly
[1:47:29] directly and let me ask you what economy
[1:47:33] was there in the wilderness were they in
[1:47:35] any particular Nation they went through
[1:47:37] Nations that's why I uh let me leave
[1:47:39] that alone they went through Nation
[1:47:41] different nations different lands and
[1:47:42] every obstacle in their way they
[1:47:44] overcame including the Red Sea they
[1:47:45] overcame it and God it was God economy
[1:47:48] that they went through so but in this
[1:47:52] economy they were fed directly by God
[1:47:53] himself not from anything they had to do
[1:47:55] very important notice here notice fed by
[1:47:58] God himself nothing they had to do but
[1:48:00] it was God's economy or how could they

[1:50:26] you oh
[1:50:28] my what economy was that the economy of
[1:50:32] the kingdom of God got show me one
[1:50:35] nation in the world where the people
[1:50:37] none of them had a lack for 40 years
[1:50:40] show me one let's let's be fair one year
[1:50:43] one year no let's be fair one month show
[1:50:45] me one economy in the world throughout
[1:50:47] human history where not a single person
[1:50:50] in the land would have a need for health
[1:50:52] care for provision for food for shoes
[1:50:55] for clothes for one month no for one day
[1:50:59] show me one nation in the world in all
[1:51:01] history you won't find
[1:51:02] one you won't find one because there is
[1:51:05] none holy as the Lord there is none
[1:51:08] beside
[1:51:09] thee none
[1:51:14] none but notice notice notice and I'm
[1:51:19] trying to see where I can wind on the
[1:51:21] clothes notice even with all that
[1:51:24] Supernatural provision from
[1:51:27] God they had just enough not abundance
[1:51:31] just
[1:51:33] enough they had just enough food for the
[1:51:35] day and that was it if they try to be
[1:51:40] greedy and take more God made sure that
[1:51:42] he spul my gods Came Upon
[1:51:47] it there's a reason for all that
[1:51:54] except for the weekend for the Sabbath
[1:51:56] days the food will keep so it was God
[1:51:58] that was doing that
[1:52:03] amen you know the reason why they
[1:52:06] couldn't keep more and all that
[1:52:09] abundance the
[1:52:12] flow was not for the Wilderness it was a
[1:52:15] promise for the promised
[1:52:18] land because the Wilderness only
[1:52:20] represented Israel's training and
[1:52:23] Preparatory School in the kingdom of God
[1:52:26] they were called out and they were in
[1:52:27] training now because the promise is
[1:52:29] ahead of them that's always the pattern
[1:52:32] for the kingdom of God the Wilderness
[1:52:34] was the process that Israel had to go
[1:52:38] through before the abundance that the
[1:52:41] kingdom of God promised and the
[1:52:43] Wilderness is the process the training
[1:52:45] school of life that you and I have to go
[1:52:47] through before the abundance that the
[1:52:50] kingdom of God promised for you and I
[1:52:52] also the promised land that Israel was
[1:52:56] promised was the land of abundance in
[1:52:58] both life and
[1:53:02] godliness like I said already the book
[1:53:04] of Deuteronomy they were about entering
[1:53:06] the promised land now and Joshua was
[1:53:10] telling them about I mean Moses rather
[1:53:12] was telling them about all the things
[1:53:15] was doing a review like a debrief of all
[1:53:18] the past 40 years what God has done for
[1:53:20] them the God's purpose in sending them
[1:53:22] through the Wilderness let me see it was
[1:53:23] a training for them because God wanted
[1:53:26] their hurs before they will get the Land
[1:53:28] of Plenty God wanted to make sure they
[1:53:31] were spending their lives seeking first
[1:53:33] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[1:53:35] making that their lifestyle before God
[1:53:37] will bless
[1:53:40] them before they would have the flow in
[1:53:43] the land of
[1:53:48] promise let's follow them to the land
[1:53:51] of that flow with milk and
[1:53:53] honey if you if you go through you'll
[1:53:56] see I said already but you see that the
[1:53:58] purpose of the trials the testings the
[1:54:00] hunger the humiliation how many times
[1:54:03] you been humiliated no fruit no rent
[1:54:06] whatever what and you say like that I
[1:54:09] knew it this religion means nothing to
[1:54:11] me but God let the Israel know I did
[1:54:15] that to humiliate you to Humble you so
[1:54:19] that you will turn to me your One
[1:54:25] Source we to have a cross to put
[1:54:27] somewhere in this church really so turn
[1:54:30] to me and face the
[1:54:33] cross and keep me in remembrance all the
[1:54:36] time when you at work when you are home
[1:54:38] when you are empty when you are low
[1:54:41] remember me when you are full
[1:54:44] especially remember me so he told he he
[1:54:47] told them like we read already and and I
[1:54:49] already explained the source of their
[1:54:52] trials The Source The Source trials the
[1:54:55] source of their testings the hunger was
[1:54:58] not the
[1:55:01] economy it was not the dry and
[1:55:04] non-existent economy of the
[1:55:07] Wilderness that dry and nonexistent
[1:55:09] economy of the Wilderness was only a
[1:55:11] tool in God's
[1:55:13] hands but economy was not the end it was
[1:55:16] a means to an end the end was God wanted
[1:55:20] to turn their eyes on him because when
[1:55:23] God needed to he gave them food in that
[1:55:25] same Wilderness he gave them water in
[1:55:26] that same Wilderness why did God keep
[1:55:28] the water away at the Waters of America
[1:55:30] until they asked why did he keep the
[1:55:33] food away until they asked
[1:55:38] him the source of all their
[1:55:41] tumor the economy was only a
[1:55:45] tool get me real
[1:55:47] good the economy is a tool is not the
[1:55:50] end the economy of the
[1:55:53] Wilderness was only a tool in God's
[1:55:56] hands the source of all their
[1:56:00] tumor of all their hunger the rocky
[1:56:03] times the Thirsty times the hunger the
[1:56:06] source of it was none other than God
[1:56:09] himself he said I made you hungry I
[1:56:13] humiliated you so that you will know
[1:56:16] that man does not live by bread alone
[1:56:18] but by every word that comes out the man
[1:56:20] of God so that you will have me in your
[1:56:24] heart that's the
[1:56:27] purpose no you don't get
[1:56:29] me the economy is there but you're not
[1:56:32] suffering because of the economy God
[1:56:34] allowed it why are you living at this
[1:56:36] time when the economy is like this
[1:56:38] [Music]
[1:56:40] why and just in case you think let me
[1:56:43] not get that let me let me just try to
[1:56:46] run
[1:56:47] quickly what I'm saying will be clear as
[1:56:50] I'm sure clear already but as we're
[1:56:51] going
[1:56:55] along because as though the rocky you
[1:56:59] know rough harsh and unpleasant
[1:57:01] circumstances they had to face in the
[1:57:03] wilderness was not enough on top of all
[1:57:06] that was Hunger was
[1:57:11] humiliation and all of these things here
[1:57:13] God is telling them was not because of
[1:57:15] the economy of the Wilderness because
[1:57:17] when God needed to he provided in spite
[1:57:19] of that
[1:57:21] economy he he overr overrode the hunger
[1:57:24] the Wilder I mean The Thirst the water
[1:57:26] lack of water they the drought he overr
[1:57:28] it when he needed to but he kept it the
[1:57:31] way because he needed to get to his
[1:57:35] children too many of you are wasting a
[1:57:38] crisis the crisis that you are in you
[1:57:42] are wasting it crisis when crisis comes
[1:57:46] is God's opportunity to get his children
[1:57:48] to run after
[1:57:50] him because that's the that's the best
[1:57:54] time that he can get your attention if
[1:57:58] he doesn't get your attention in times
[1:57:59] of Crisis he's not going to get your
[1:58:01] attention in terms of
[1:58:02] Plenty why waste a crisis why waste the
[1:58:07] crisis why waste the Nigerian economic
[1:58:09] crisis right now are you hearing me why
[1:58:12] waste the crisis why not use this crisis
[1:58:15] to run into Jesus why not use this
[1:58:18] crisis to fall in love with Jesus more
[1:58:21] than you ever before I keep falling in
[1:58:23] love with him over and over and over and

[1:58:35] all crisis on your job where was the
[1:58:38] crisis let that crisis drive you into
[1:58:41] Jesus because that's the shortest time

[1:58:46] when your your belly is full and your
[1:58:48] table is full of something
[1:58:53] you are wasting this crisis you are
[1:58:55] wasting this crisis husbands are

[1:59:55] wilderness in the midst of the crisis in
[1:59:57] the midst of this economic crisis or
[2:00:00] whatever the crisis you are in whatever
[2:00:02] it
[2:00:07] crisis the point of this of the sitation
[2:00:09] is that it was the hand of
[2:00:12] God he had a purpose in sending this
[2:00:16] specially designed trials
[2:00:20] each day of their lives while they walk
[2:00:22] through the Wilderness because they were
[2:00:24] living in God's
[2:00:27] economy what was it God was trying to
[2:00:30] get to their soul he was trying to use
[2:00:32] the purpose the economy was only a tool
[2:00:35] to withdraw from them so that they run
[2:00:38] to
[2:00:39] him many of you pray pray pray I want a
[2:00:41] job when you get a job the job is so
[2:00:43] important you even forget to pray with
[2:00:45] you too you don't have time now you just
[2:00:47] run away what it is here you are in the
[2:00:48] wild wild and that Wilderness is just a
[2:00:51] land of just enough it's not a land of
[2:00:53] abundance just enough if that's where
[2:00:55] you want to live stay there stay that
[2:00:58] but we are going to the promised land I
[2:00:59] said come with us we're going to the
[2:01:00] promised land the land of more than
[2:01:02] plenty more than enough is more than
[2:01:04] enough is El Shad the god of Plenty the
[2:01:07] all sufficient one God Almighty is more
[2:01:10] than enough oh Hallelujah H can I have

[2:01:17] let's try to wind down here
[2:01:19] oh
[2:01:21] brother
[2:01:26] amen what was the purpose God was trying
[2:01:28] to get to their soul the inner man he
[2:01:31] was he was trying to get get to them
[2:01:34] with all this crisis to seek after him
[2:01:38] with their whole heart soul mind and
[2:01:40] strength first and foremost over and
[2:01:42] above all else to see him as their
[2:01:45] Source he will do everything so that
[2:01:47] your only provision comes because you
[2:01:49] look up to him I will look up into the
[2:01:51] heels for when cometh my help my source
[2:01:54] Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven
[2:01:56] and
[2:01:56] [Applause]
[2:01:56] [Music]
[2:01:58] [Applause]
[2:02:05] Earth you may be
[2:02:09] seated he was only trying to attract the
[2:02:11] attention fully and holy he was trying
[2:02:15] to get them to walk every single day
[2:02:17] with
[2:02:17] Jesus with him trying to build and grow
[2:02:22] their
[2:02:23] faith in him so they could walk with God
[2:02:27] because without faith is impossible to
[2:02:29] please God and Enoch walk with God
[2:02:31] because he had faith that pleased God so
[2:02:35] was trying to build their faith their
[2:02:36] trust in him don't look at these things
[2:02:38] around here look to me look to me look
[2:02:41] to me the source your Source level mind

[2:02:47] rock
[2:02:51] I can send food down from heaven angel
[2:02:55] cake
[2:02:58] Hallelujah God was trying to get them to
[2:03:01] see him as the source of everything in
[2:03:04] their lives he was trying to get them to
[2:03:06] see that without him they could do
[2:03:08] nothing oh my that was the purpose of
[2:03:12] the hunger the humiliation the pain the
[2:03:16] seeming abandonment by God
[2:03:19] and that has been the purpose of your
[2:03:21] hunger your seeming abandonment by
[2:03:25] God but how have you used the crisis
[2:03:29] have you used the crisis to complain and
[2:03:31] Mumble that God's not taking care of you
[2:03:33] or have you even used the crisis to to
[2:03:35] run into Jesus I'm running I'm running
[2:03:37] I'm running into Jesus what have you
[2:03:39] been doing with your
[2:03:41] crisis what have you been doing with
[2:03:42] your
[2:03:43] crisis mumbling grumbling complaining
[2:03:46] like the mixed m in the wilderness or
[2:03:49] you are running to Jesus in the midst of
[2:03:50] your
[2:03:53] crisis listen Moses went through the
[2:03:56] same hunger a prince a
[2:04:00] prince a prince of Egypt went through
[2:04:02] the same hunger these were
[2:04:05] [Music]
[2:04:07] MERS a prince he did not complain about
[2:04:10] the younger because he knew the purpose
[2:04:13] while the hunger was
[2:04:16] there Aaron went through it uh Joshua
[2:04:20] kill on you never have them complain but
[2:04:23] this mixed multitude who have no regard
[2:04:25] for God at
[2:04:27] all every need every pain they complain
[2:04:30] about God where is God where is he we
[2:04:33] better go back to
[2:04:35] [Music]
[2:04:40] Egypt and that in the kingdom of God
[2:04:44] hallelujah
[2:04:47] hallelujah wow
[2:04:52] [Music]
[2:04:55] so they miss the purpose of the hunger
[2:04:57] they just got humiliated for nothing and
[2:04:59] they saw the humiliation as an end in
[2:05:01] itself but the humiliation the hunger
[2:05:03] was a means to an
[2:05:06] end and the president is they are
