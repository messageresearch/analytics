[35:06] India and there was a man that was
[35:09] blind and he had no
[35:11] [Music]
[35:13] shoes and the first thing
[35:16] did was to take off his
[35:19] shoes to see the
[35:22] man put on his
[35:25] shoes he was SE for the
[35:28] man he was having
[35:31] compassion some sense of
[35:35] feeling the man is already
[35:38] blind but he has no
[35:40] shoes and
[35:43] eventually God healed the

[35:48] sight I had a
[35:51] testimony or somebody came up

[45:37] Nation you may be seated and
[45:41] the there's a
[45:43] message the second coming of the
[45:46] Lord and that
[45:48] message he describe at that
[45:51] time they didn't have a wedding
[45:54] ring
[45:58] for a woman to
[46:00] wear sh a wedding Banner on her
[46:04] head and in the band have
[46:08] coins that represented different
[46:13] virtues and if she was caught in
[46:15] adultery or caught un clean
[46:19] living they will take her to the
[46:22] priest and they will take out that
[46:24] particular coin
[46:28] and when her husband comes
[46:30] home and see the coin
[46:34] missing he will divorce her and put her
[46:39] away so the prophet says he took the
[46:44] scriptures which
[46:46] woman having nine coins or
[46:50] whatever wouldn't lost one and and seek
[46:52] diligently until she find
[46:54] it
[46:58] and he took that
[46:59] scripture and identified the
[47:03] bride in that
[47:05] [Music]
[47:06] scripture he was saying a husband was
[47:10] coming now the
[47:12] husband of course represent
[47:16] Jesus and the
[47:18] bride must have all the
[47:23] coins so this woman she knew she lost
[47:29] one and she began to uh clean up the
[47:35] finance he was talking about she had to
[47:37] light a
[47:40] candle and she had a
[47:43] broom and she went to house
[47:46] cleaning now you
[47:48] know if you're cleaning your
[47:51] house and you don't want your neighbor
[47:54] to know you're cleaning your house or
[47:57] you clean
[48:00] quietly you might push some dirt under
[48:02] the
[48:06] carpet you're moving very
[48:08] [Music]
[48:10] easy because you don't want to beor to
[48:15] know your house is
[48:18] dirty but this
[48:20] woman she wasn't like
[48:22] that she was dra on the caret
[48:29] got to find that
[48:31] coin find that
[48:36] coin
[48:40] every
[48:43] huah when you behave like
[48:46] that that you don't care who in front of
[48:51] you at the side of
[48:53] you you don't care who is behind
[48:57] you you praise God
[49:01] anyhow you pray anyhow oh Hallelujah you
[49:05] cry out
[49:07] anyhow but abam said she had a read
[49:10] house clean and
[49:13] time brother we the Church of the Living
[49:18] God we need to check up and go before
[49:21] God the church has no conscience no more
[49:26] you could hardly wake them
[49:30] up the Bible say they would come in that
[49:35] condition when they will say the Lord
[49:37] delay is
[49:39] coming and they'll be fighting one
[49:43] another Oh Glory to
[49:45] God praise God praise God he said the
[49:48] Lutheran Church lost his
[49:49] [Music]
[49:51] light Methodist Church lost a
[49:54] light she had a house cleaning
[49:57] time she scrubbed the

[51:53] with
[51:54] you may be seated
[51:58] 1981
[51:59] [Music]
[52:01] 1981 we had a little church in a country
[52:03] [Music]
[52:06] area uh at that
[52:08] time we were worshiping a little house a
[52:11] wooden
[52:14] house there was no
[52:18] electricity there was no running
[52:22] water just maybe about six eight people
[52:26] and we used to pump gas
[52:30] lamp to to to to have
[52:36] services and go to a
[52:39] well to get
[52:41] water and one
[52:43] night we had a prayer
[52:46] meeting and I was
[52:48] praying and a vision
[52:51] broke the first Vision that I
[52:54] saw a sheet dropped
[52:58] down I saw the second coming of the
[53:03] Lord and when I and when I came out of
[53:06] of
[53:06] [Music]
[53:09] it I wanted to know if bam preached on
[53:14] this when I searched out I found he did
[53:17] preach in
[53:19] it message called the second coming of
[53:22] the
[53:24] Lord
[53:26] so I begin to study that
[53:29] message and when I came to this quot
[53:31] here this
[53:36] prophecy I said
[53:38] church this is a prophecy
[53:41] here this must be
[53:45] revealed now I know what was in my
[53:49] heart who ignored me and treat me badly
[53:52] in
[53:54] Trinidad
[53:58] I knew I had ill feelings towards
[54:02] them because they didn't try to
[54:05] understand or know me or meet me they
[54:06] just say what they want to
[54:09] say sometimes when people don't know
[54:15] you and you hear negative
[54:19] things it can affect you and give you a
[54:24] complex so when I found this here this
[54:28] prophecy I began to preach on it and
[54:31] preach for about
[54:36] forgiveness and one day I was behind the
[54:41] ppit and I said God forgive me of my
[54:45] sins why can't I forgive
[54:49] you and then the Holy
[54:52] Spirit brought to us in in
[54:55] [Music]
[54:57] Trinidad revelation of Brotherly
[55:01] kindness now at that
[55:03] time I've never seen the spirit pour out
[55:10] before we preached the word and share
[55:12] the word and so
[55:15] on and I came from a Catholic
[55:18] background not
[55:20] Pentecostal so I don't know about
[55:22] worship and all this sort of things
[55:26] but when brotherly kindness
[55:29] broke the Holy Spirit poured
[55:32] out and it was quite an
[55:37] experience to see the spirit pour out
[55:39] upon the
[55:42] people now that changed
[55:45] me and all the issues that I had in my
[55:50] heart
[55:51] left I had no ODS against anybody
[55:55] [Music]
[55:56] later
[55:58] on I
[56:00] understood the prophet
[56:03] said faith is based on
[56:09] [Applause]
[56:13] forgiveness so if you want to be
[56:17] healed you can't have oughts and
[56:23] grudges but but I want to show you
[56:26] this in this
[56:28] age God put brotherly
[56:32] kindness as the
[56:35] blood as the
[56:41] door so he put right
[56:45] here that's
[56:47] you that's what you have to
[56:50] manifest regardless of how Brethren
[56:52] treat
[56:53] you
[56:56] what your wife do husband do children it
[56:59] doesn't
[57:02] matter you have to
[57:05] forgive yes why yes
[57:10] why brotherly
[57:12] kindness give you
[57:14] [Music]
[57:15] access Holy
[57:19] [Applause]
[57:23] Spirit
[57:26] [Applause]
[57:28] do you see
[57:30] it so there Spirit of
[57:33] [Music]
[57:34] forgiveness has to be
[57:36] there to break into that Holy Spirit
[57:42] be seated
[57:45] or I can put it this
[57:48] way the book of
[57:52] Jude small book
[57:55] is just before the Book of
[57:56] [Music]
[57:58] Revelation that book of
[58:01] Jude and in that book of
[58:04] Jude Jude
[58:06] said and of
[58:09] some have
[58:11] compassion making a
[58:15] difference and Jude was
[58:17] [Music]
[58:19] teaching that their Believers their
[58:23] people who might be weak in the
[58:25] [Music]
[58:27] flesh deser the
[58:32] difference be between people who are
[58:37] weak and people who are badp
[58:41] spirited people that don't
[58:44] care so there are people that do wrong
[58:47] things and they don't want to do wrong
[58:53] things
[58:55] have compassion they have a heart for
[58:57] [Music]
[58:58] God but they have different
[59:01] weaknesses so
[59:03] Jude brought brotherly
[59:06] kindness that
[59:08] book just before
[59:11] Revelation so before you move into real
[59:17] Revelation Book of
[59:19] Revelation you have to get into
[59:23] Jude and
[59:26] compassion but you have the
[59:29] opportunity to get into brotherly
[59:32] kindness not as a
[59:35] Doctrine but I'm talking about brotherly
[59:40] kindness the spirit of
[59:43] it not the text of of
[59:46] it not not not not speaking lovely the
[59:51] truth but speaking the truth in love
[59:56] it is not the
[59:58] same so we need to get in the spirit of
[1:00:00] Brotherly
[1:00:02] kindness to have true brotherly
[1:00:05] kindness one more when brother Bram came
[1:00:09] to the
[1:00:11] church and the two people was making
[1:00:13] love in the
[1:00:17] church begging stop it please please
[1:00:19] stop
[1:00:21] it don't do that here
[1:00:26] and all of a
[1:00:27] sudden Holy Spirit dropped
[1:00:30] down and say whatever you
[1:00:33] say it going to happen to
[1:00:36] them if you say that they will
[1:00:40] die if they say blind they will go
[1:00:44] blind he gave the prophet
[1:00:46] [Music]
[1:00:47] options option one option one option two
[1:00:51] option two option three option three and
[1:00:53] he shows none of them
[1:00:56] he said I forgive
[1:01:01] [Applause]
[1:01:04] you and
[1:01:07] God was
[1:01:08] [Music]
[1:01:10] pleased I forgive
[1:01:12] you because he knew he did things that
[1:01:15] needed
[1:01:16] forgiveness I'll give you one
[1:01:18] more you be seated but abam had services
[1:01:25] and he went to a
[1:01:27] restaurant
[1:01:30] hungry and when he went to the
[1:01:32] restaurant he saw this woman with some
[1:01:36] men music playing and everything
[1:01:39] else and he said
[1:01:42] God is this the world that you're going
[1:01:44] to have here
[1:01:47] now daughter to grow up
[1:01:49] [Music]
[1:01:51] in why don't you judge and destroy it
[1:01:57] he felt a top of his
[1:02:01] shoulder call him
[1:02:04] aside then God gave him a
[1:02:07] vision and the vision was him as a young
[1:02:10] child young
[1:02:11] [Music]
[1:02:12] boy everything he was doing
[1:02:16] wrong was going up to
[1:02:19] God and Jesus
[1:02:21] blood were like a bumper
[1:02:25] pumping it back
[1:02:27] off keeping it from going to the
[1:02:29] presence of
[1:02:32] God in the
[1:02:34] vision he saw
[1:02:36] God took his
[1:02:39] sins and right
[1:02:42] pardon put it in the sea of
[1:02:47] forgetfulness and God told
[1:02:50] him I forgive
[1:02:53] you and you condemn
[1:02:56] her the Lord
[1:02:59] Praises did you get that he said I
[1:03:02] forgive
[1:03:04] you you are condemning the
[1:03:08] woman hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I
[1:03:12] don't know why I'm going there
[1:03:14] Hallelujah I don't know why I'm saying
[1:03:16] these
[1:03:18] things
[1:03:19] soam went to the
[1:03:22] woman said woman I was just condemning
[1:03:27] you and the Lord show
[1:03:30] me my own sins that he
[1:03:34] forgave say I was a
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:38] Believer and things went
[1:03:40] [Applause]
[1:03:41] wrong and I'm all messed
[1:03:44] up and right there
[1:03:48] brother went on his
[1:03:50] knees he and that
[1:03:53] woman he
[1:03:55] prayed and she was

[1:06:59] coming is Malachi
[1:07:05] 4 Revelation
[1:07:08] 10:7 the promise of the
[1:07:11] shout that came to the
[1:07:14] prophet of Seven tunders and Seven
[1:07:17] Seals and he says
[1:07:19] here watch in the last days there's got
[1:07:23] to be a place
[1:07:26] prepared for the word to be made
[1:07:29] manifest listen to these words
[1:07:32] now and we are now
[1:07:35] living by the evidence of the new
[1:07:38] [Music]
[1:07:43] land so William Bram
[1:07:46] Ministry the words on the books and the
[1:07:50] tapes is not a
[1:07:52] man it's is the son of
[1:07:55] man and that son of
[1:07:58] man is
[1:08:00] evidence of the land where we going
[1:08:02] [Music]
[1:08:04] through remember this remember this
[1:08:08] Israel was in
[1:08:10] Egypt 400 years God promised to deliver
[1:08:14] them Egypt was not their
[1:08:18] land even if you build a three story
[1:08:20] building in Egypt it's still not your
[1:08:22] land
[1:08:26] that is
[1:08:27] Egypt so let's say Egypt is
[1:08:31] here let's say the land is across
[1:08:34] there God sent
[1:08:36] Moses to take them from
[1:08:39] here to get them to across there we know
[1:08:43] the
[1:08:44] story two million people leave
[1:08:47] Egypt and out of two
[1:08:50] million only two made
[1:08:52] it because of
[1:08:55] unbelief so God was
[1:08:57] [Music]
[1:08:59] interested children that those mothers
[1:09:02] were having on the
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:06] journey because God was raising up a new
[1:09:12] generation to take them into the
[1:09:17] land so when Moses
[1:09:20] died God told Joshua
[1:09:25] Moses my servant is
[1:09:28] dead take these people
[1:09:31] over and let me
[1:09:35] prophesy there's going to be a fold
[1:09:40] Ministry a new
[1:09:43] generation to take the people
[1:09:47] over give the Lord some
[1:09:50] prais you are going
[1:09:52] over
[1:09:55] into your
[1:09:57] land Oh Glory to God
[1:10:02] hallelujah thank you

[1:10:10] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:10:14] Hallelujah listen to this notice the
[1:10:18] coming of Jesus is so close at
[1:10:21] hand until the spirit
[1:10:26] justification
[1:10:27] [Music]
[1:10:29] sanctification just Spirit justification
[1:10:34] sanctification the church has got to be
[1:10:38] so perfectly like
[1:10:41] Christ and hear the prophecy
[1:10:44] now we have got a Ministry
[1:10:48] coming that's exactly like the Life of
[1:10:52] Christ
[1:10:54] what does that Ministry
[1:10:58] identify the coming of the
[1:11:00] Lord
[1:11:02] behold the
[1:11:04] com listen there's a
[1:11:07] prophecy that Jesus Christ
[1:11:11] Ministry there will be among
[1:11:14] us not not my
[1:11:17] Ministry not his
[1:11:20] ministry not his
[1:11:22] ministry not the their
[1:11:25] Ministry
[1:11:26] Jesus
[1:11:28] ministry work to
[1:11:32] them that's the
[1:11:34] promise Christ own
[1:11:38] Ministry brother
[1:11:40] Bram identified a
[1:11:42] [Music]
[1:11:44] shout he did that in rupture
[1:11:47] message he said three things
[1:11:50] happen when Jesus is
[1:11:52] descending and Jesus does all
[1:11:56] three shout a voice a
[1:12:01] trumpet has to
[1:12:03] happen before Jesus

[1:12:11] shout what is the
[1:12:13] shout it's the message going
