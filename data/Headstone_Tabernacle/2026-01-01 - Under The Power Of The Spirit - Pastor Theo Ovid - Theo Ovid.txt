[music] So, we'd like to welcome to the platform tonight our precious brother Andy Henry. He has a [music] testimony he'd like to share with us tonight from his heart to glorify the Lord. You appreciate him as he comes. [music] Amen. God bless you. Amen. As you would share [music] the grace of God with you. Amen. God bless you. God bless you brothers and sisters. Is a privilege for me to stand before you this morning, this evening. Sorry. See, I'm mixing up my words all kind of thing. Um, I thank God for this opportunity and I just want to share a quick short testimony of something that transpired in the life of our family in our family. So, it is mostly my son's testimony. So I would just read what it is he wanted to say and then I would you know add to it in that sense. So it is this is the the words of son Andrew. He recently got baptized and this is his testimony of the events leading up to his baptism and even afterwards. So it goes like this. Greetings Jesus name brothers and sisters. This is my little testimony of how the Lord spoke to my heart and helped me to make the decision to serve him. Coming to church as a young boy that's all it was at the time going to church. My parents always encouraged me to sit upstairs and listen to the service. Sometimes I did some other times not so much. Several services passed where I felt a strange feeling during and after the service that almost always brought me to tears. There was an altar call after service one Sunday and I felt an urge like God telling me to go up, but I was scared because I didn't know what was happening or how to react. I broke down in tears and explained this to my dad. He said, "That was God speaking to my heart." And when you get that feeling again, go up. Don't hesitate. My mom said, "If you want me to go with you, I will. Next time there was an alter call, I told mom I wanted to go up and she immediately went up with me." I had many experiences after that where I felt convicted and started to pray more. A few weeks after an outer call was made again. I was downstairs at the time and the thought came to me to get baptized before this year ends. To my surprise, I never thought about this because I already had it in my mind that I'm getting baptized at the age of 12 and I'm 11. I mentioned this to my mom. She said, "We'll speak to the ministry. We'll arrange it and whatnot." Before I knew it, I was in the office with brother Isaac and he had a little talk with me. After the meeting, my dad asked me how soon I wanted to get baptized. I didn't know, but then I realized the faster I got baptized, the better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then I chose the following week, the following week. And yes, ever since then, the Lord has been leading me in my life, speaking to me when I'm not too sure about things or should not too sure about things I should or shouldn't do. This has also helped me to pray more and seek God's help. And he has always helped me. Little by little, I am understanding how to live this Christian life. That God has called me to live because I believe that he has a purpose for my life. And by his grace, I know he will keep me. I hope this small testimony will be an encouragement to you to keep pressing the battle. God bless you, Andrew Henry. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; So brothers and sisters, it is a a a wonderful feeling when speaking as a father, &gt;&gt; your children comes to the Lord, &gt;&gt; makes that decision to serve him. And sometimes as parents uh we might feel that we keep praying for our kids and you know things not really looking or shaping or going the way that we would want it to go. But I am here tonight just to encourage you all that continue praying for your children. continue covering your family, your spouse, everyone with the blood because you don't know when God will actually speak to their heart and turn things around. Continue. Don't give up. God is awesome. He promised that he will bring all our children, those who we love. And if we give up now, then I mean our prayers won't fall to the ground. But as parents, as guardians, as stewards, we are entrusted to keep lifting them up. Lift keep covering them with the blood. &gt;&gt; You understand? Because at the end of it all, we have to give account for our children what it is we do for them. So, I didn't really want to stay too long, but I just wanted to share this and encourage you all that God is real. He is still working among the lives of our young people and keep holding on. All right. God bless you. [applause] Amen. You appreciate that testimony tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God richly bless you and thank you, precious brother Andy Henry. Amen. And we uh we uh take encouragement [music] with that tonight. And we want to just follow right along with the program. Uh we also have another testimony [music] we'd like to uh call up tonight. Uh this is from our precious uh brother Clarence Clark. You appreciate our brother Clarence tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; And uh as he makes his way up to the platform, uh we'd like to have him share another word of testimony with us as well tonight to encourage our hearts tonight in a special way. Amen. So you may have your seats one more time as he gets ready to come. Amen. God bless you. God blessings. Uh before I see this testimony, I just like to read two portions of scripture please. Taken from book of Acts 1 from verse 10 and 11. And while they looked steadfastly towards heaven, as he went up, as he went up, behold, two men stood by him in white apparel, which also said, "Ye men of Galilee, why stand the gay gazing up into heaven. The same Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven &gt;&gt; shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. &gt;&gt; Next scripture is 1 John 3. Behold, what manner of love the Father had shown upon us, that we should be called the sons of God. Therefore, the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. For we shall see him as he is. And every man that had this hope in him purified himself even as he is pure. uh take these two scriptures because at the end of it um all glory have to be to Jesus Christ. some months ago. I I I normally call my testings tri um and trials training. So some months ago I end up in hospital. Now I was home and I got up, went to the bathroom. I knew I went to the bathroom and the next thing I was conscious of is I find myself waking up between my bathtub and the toilet bowl and I want to know well what really happened here. I know I went to the and that's now I find myself waking up. So I got up. I know. I got up and the next thing you know I was conscious that my face on the ground and like a drooling and a fighting to breathe. And I say but what it is happening here? Now the first thing you know the devil has tried to give you a kind of thing where they going on dead and all them kind of thing but saints no fear came at that point in time no fear and I started to say Lord what is happening here God help me God fighting to breed a car breed I said well look let me come out because it's a master bedroom so from the toilet to go back into the so I said well let me try and see if I could get to the phone. I realized I can move hard to move. And I started to try to crawl from just the bathroom. I couldn't even reach the door. I I said, I don't know what happened me. And the next thing you know, I don't know how long I was on the ground. I don't know what happened, but maybe all I recognized after it was brother Popwell in [clears throat] the house in upstairs in the bathroom talking to me. Now, it was a strange thing because all my all my gates lock up mean my house. So he had to climb the gate to come upstairs, go over a banister and enter my bedroom and then come in. Now I maybe he could tell you I don't know why he came [laughter] because it's a Sunday and normally I know brother Pel in service and at the end of it brother Poppel called the ambulance he prayed and I fighting to breathe and I can't I don't know what happening because I don't know what happening now when you look back at it. I realized that his steps were ordered. &gt;&gt; You understand? He didn't just come by chance. That was ordered steps that come. I went to the I was taken to the hospital and fighting for bread. They end up telling me that you know something with my heart. I don't have no heart. No, I have no heart problem. You understand? So at the end of it they inject me and they had us to strap me down because I fighted to breathe and they telling me you know relax. How you going to relax and you can't breathe? It don't make sense. So here was I fighting to breathe. They eventually well whatever injection the thing this they start a thing and before I know it well brother papel was with me in the you know he was in the hospital and some of my children came and then the next thing you know I two of my daughters who live in Tobago I see them appear now I don't know it appears that well brother called them immediately. Now I don't know how they reach down so fast because during the um Christmas season it's difficult to get uh aircraft to come down to Trinidad but both of them was downhill and they came in one of them well you know she's in uh you know in the uh medical field she came in check talked to me And the next thing you know at the end of it they end up putting me in a certain ward to eat and then the rest of the children was there. So it take me about two weeks I was in the hospital and at the end of it I said I look back at the I look back at this I just say training and I wanted to know well Lord what is happening what why can't figure out now but I in respect in in in going back to all these things I realized that during my lifetime is about about four or five times Satan tried to kill me. I thought I was gone but it at times I I remember distinct um I thought I was drowning. I I was with some brethren and I was under the water for a while and I it is a strange thing. I was conscious under the water conscious that a day a long time but I am fully conscious and I thinking well this wave is dead or something and when I did come up because that wave end up pushing me up the brother was panicking and they want to know well how can I stay and I and all don't know so is a few times the devil tried to take me No, he can't. &gt;&gt; He just can't, &gt;&gt; you know. And when I look back, especially for this last um occasion here after coming out of the hospital, you know, I'll say um my one of my daughters, that's Chanel. Um I don't know what I don't know if it's a conspiracy. I don't want to say it's an arrangement she she probably made with the doctor because the day she came the sometimes after because she stayed here she said daddy um you will you'll be be you are being discharged to the I say okay no problem she came change my clothes she take the pillow everything and she jump in she was driving jump in the She came straight down the highway. She passed Mosa road. She passed Maloney. She passed Pia Junction. So I said, "What are you going?" She said, "Relax yourself. Relax yourself." She drive me straight on a boat and it's the big where I was. I I I don't know how that fix now. You know when I look at it I say boy like these people kidnapped me here like you know but you know there's a syndrome I can't quite remember the there's a syndrome where the kidnappy just fall in love with the kidnapper and I am saying I fell more in love with my kidnappers you understand and I I I could be kidnapped by them anytime you know during that period I I couldn't I was a bit taken back because I couldn't understand where and when I give up my authority because I thought I was the parent but I realized it was taken away from me and I have to do what they say. So I just had to be obedient you know and it take me a while to take me some months but I say all this to say that God is the one who control all this thing. Now many times we have troubles as far as I concerned that was a trouble that came and many time we have troubles cancer wherever wherever trouble but our prophet taught us that God he put a bit in troubled mouth &gt;&gt; you know what is a bit is something to control a horse &gt;&gt; pull it here &gt;&gt; so any trouble that you come is not a runaway trouble &gt;&gt; it is a controlled trouble. Always remember that &gt;&gt; these are the things that help me &gt;&gt; to to survive and to come up because when I realize that hey this is a control trouble. So sit on the highway in the first place. He do not have the keys of hell and death because that was the trump card debt. &gt;&gt; But he no longer have the keys of hell and death &gt;&gt; and all the bars. You know sometime you you you find yourself in a trouble and things happening to you and like you b you know like you have bars you know like a gate you cage up &gt;&gt; push the gate &gt;&gt; it don't have no key it don't have no lock be lying [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; understand what I say now you see we and this is why I say I look at all my thing as a training Because the devil have been pushing us so long that we we have that fear. &gt;&gt; But the thing is we have to say what the word says. Stick with what the word say. The word say listen to me &gt;&gt; first to begin. He don't have no keys. &gt;&gt; He's a liar. &gt;&gt; Two trouble is controlled. &gt;&gt; So whatever happening with you at this point in time it is controlled. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is not run away. Sometime we think well, oh God, this thing going to kill me. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; God just testing for reaction. &gt;&gt; He testing to see how he will behave. &gt;&gt; How you will adapt. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? First again remember not only he don't have no keys and hell and death. Remember our prophet taught us that listen there is a time that is here and coming. &gt;&gt; We will stop cancer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will stop diseases. &gt;&gt; Now if we have to stop it then he can't really have no real authority over it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He lying. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he just using effects and and and using the five senses and trying to make make that but he lying because we have to stop that &gt;&gt; and once we have to stop it then it means then we have control over it for so he lying. So I want you to understand that regardless of what happening to you, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; remember he is a liar, remember who you are. &gt;&gt; You understand? Remember not only is is is that is that um he he he he don't have keys at hella debt or uh we have to stop cancer. Remember we are we are sons and daughters of God that a promise is made to us. &gt;&gt; I believe this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know we had to understand that this message is real. &gt;&gt; You know sometime we we people go to church for years. You understand? You go to church for years. Please no. This is not church thing. Is God trying to bring his children, his sons and daughters to recognize who they are? All right. And just think about it. Who do you say this message is? &gt;&gt; Not what, but who do you say this message is? &gt;&gt; This message is not just talk. No, no, no. &gt;&gt; When you get the answer to who you say this message is, you're going to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I'll give you a little hint. The whole family in heaven and the whole family on earth named Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; God bless. [applause] Oh, do you appreciate it tonight? Let's all stand. Hallelujah.

The latter [music] raining the dynamics of the mechanics. Granted God in Jesus name we ask it. Amen. And God bless you. [music] I don't know what to say but the atmosphere. Thanks [music] for the special testimonies. Very encouraging. So I believe I'll go straight to the word. Time is ticking on us. Genesis chapter 26, we want to read verse 1-6 and 12-4, Ecclesiastes 11, reading 4-6 and Acts 18 for scripture reading this night. &gt;&gt; Reading Genesis 26, and there was a famine in the land &gt;&gt; besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Aimilec, king of the Philistines, unto Jira. And the Lord appeared unto him, and said, "Go not down unto Egypt. Dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of. Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee. For unto thee, and unto thy seed I will give all these countries, &gt;&gt; and I will perform my oath, which I swear unto Abraham thy father, &gt;&gt; and I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of the heaven. I will give unto thy seed all these countries and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because that that Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. And Isaac dwelt in Jira. Verse 12. Then Isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year a hundfold. &gt;&gt; And the Lord blessed him. &gt;&gt; And the man waxed great and went forward and grew until he became very great. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For he had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great store of servants. And the Philistines envied him. Ecclesiastes chapter 11 reading from verse 4. He that observeth the wind shall not sow, and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. For thou knowest not what is in the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child. Even so thou knowest not the works of God who make it all. In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand, for thou knowest not whether shall prosper either this or that, or whether they be shall be alike or good. Last scripture, Acts 18. But he shall receive power &gt;&gt; after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you &gt;&gt; and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, in Samaria, and in the uttermost part of the earth. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word. We thank you for the testimonies, the specials, the singing, the worship, the atmosphere and your people gathered here. Father, we pray as your blessing come down tonight that you would forgive their past and bless their future. I pray dear God that this will be a special year being birthed Lord that we will see the dynamics in the mechanics &gt;&gt; and the letter rain spirit of the promise to Paul upon the bride seed &gt;&gt; and the secret is the word is in that bride. &gt;&gt; You have we have been seated on for years waiting upon God. Father God, come down tonight and confirm your word with signs, wonders, and miracles. We await you in Jesus name we ask it. Amen. You will be seated. As you sit down, give the Lord a shout of praise of worship unto God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. My God. We are nearer than when we first believe. &gt;&gt; Be narrower when we first believe. You have been holding for all these years. But one day the God that made that promise will fulfill that promise &gt;&gt; in your life, in your heart, in your mind, among your family, in your own body. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise. We were already blessed on Sunday with the message. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. [applause] And God said in Micah uh um Malachi rather, I love thee and you say, I have not loved thee. But as I brought it out so tremendous, God showed in answering about love, he said, "Let me show you what hate looks like." &gt;&gt; And the opposite of hate is love. &gt;&gt; If I hated you, I was going to show you how I'm going to treat you. But I want to bring a scripture just to fall in line with that. It's from Proverbs chapter 6 verse 16 says, "And six things that God hate. &gt;&gt; Seven is an abomination to him. One, a proud look, a lying tongue, &gt;&gt; hands that shed innocent blood, &gt;&gt; a heart that devisth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running mischief, a false witness that speaketh lies, &gt;&gt; and he that sweth discord, watch that one now, &gt;&gt; among brethren. God hate that. &gt;&gt; If you want God to hate you, &gt;&gt; this is things that God hate. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. All right, let's go. So the prophet said there'll be form and latter rain and in the latter rain will both be form and latter rain together. &gt;&gt; A great church universal that would sweep from one side to the other of the world. A great message, great signs and wonders would be accomplished by this church. &gt;&gt; Daniel said the people that know their God shall do great exploits. &gt;&gt; So we can't leave here dry. &gt;&gt; We can't leave here dead. We can't leave here like an ordinary church. If this is what the Bible said, the people that know their God shall do great exploits. That must happen because one thing we know that God can't do, he can't lie. &gt;&gt; If God said that, he said that &gt;&gt; and he means that. A good reading is a Lord of praises. &gt;&gt; The title tonight is under the power of the spirit. Amen. That's the title. Under the power of the spirit and have an inspiration, the latter rain. Amen. Praise God. So the latter rain, you're talking about Sarah. When Sarah when the Abra when the Elohim came to visit Sarah, he said, "I'm going to visit you according to the time of life. &gt;&gt; And you're going to have that baby that you're waiting on. The latter rain is fixing to fall. You have held that seed in there long enough now. Believe him. But we are looking for a coming son. He is coming." &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. They're trying to manufacture a latter rain. Nonsense. The latter rain will sweep the world. Praise God. Then you will see what the rain produces. There'll be an affiliation and the groups will come together and they will shut the doors of those guys that wouldn't listen to it and you won't be able to open your mouth and then he will come. &gt;&gt; That is when you will see a rain just lay still and be quiet. &gt;&gt; Let it go. &gt;&gt; In other words, shut up. Keep quiet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When your rain come, your rain come. &gt;&gt; And nobody can stop your rain. &gt;&gt; You can't stop the rain. What you have to make sure is what seed is inside of you. And once you have the right seed inside of you, the rain will produce itself. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Praise God. Praise God. So then the latter rain can only come after the teaching rain. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I read a very strange scripture tonight speaking about famine in the land &gt;&gt; where Isaac went into this land. And God told Isaac to sjourn day and I'll bless you. &gt;&gt; And guess what? Isaac obeyed. The key here is watch Isaac's obedience. &gt;&gt; God reminded him that his father Abraham kept the word, &gt;&gt; kept the commandments. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? But the part I want to get to is that Isaac swed in that land and received in the same year 100fold &gt;&gt; and the Lord blessed him. &gt;&gt; Isaac swed in a time of famine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; What was the next chapter we read? Let me just get it here quickly. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He that observeth the wind shall not sow. &gt;&gt; He that regardeth the clouds shall not weep. So what is he saying there? You don't have to wait for the conditions to be favorable &gt;&gt; to find favor with God. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, I like this seed reference because it takes God to produce a crop. &gt;&gt; Man not making the seeds grow. Not God to do that. &gt;&gt; So, Isaac didn't just operate on a level of faith, but it shows that heaven honored his faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; And I want you to see that is how you have to be for 2026. Yes. &gt;&gt; You're not looking for everything to be fine. You look everything and to be in order. All the clouds in place and the this in place. Forget all about that. &gt;&gt; Put whatever you got. Put your hands with Put your hands and sew. Put your hands and press whatever you want to do. Do it. [applause] God can't bless what you have not done. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout. [screaming] Give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. God can't bless emptiness. &gt;&gt; God can't multiply what you don't have. &gt;&gt; He have to take what you have &gt;&gt; and multiply it. Oh, give the Lord some praises. [applause] &gt;&gt; So, I want to bring a faith attention to you, &gt;&gt; a picture in your mind and heart what you have to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come like somebody praying to God, praying for God for a blessing and they have no cup to get it. &gt;&gt; They have no vessel to receive. God, bless me, Lord. Bless me, Lord. Where's the room for it? God say, "Where to pour it?" Um, you clear your throat. You ain't ready for no blessing yet. &gt;&gt; If you want a better job, you have to get better skills &gt;&gt; or get more education to get a better job. &gt;&gt; I want a better job, more pay, more pay, more pay, more pay. &gt;&gt; God will bless your effort in studies. for you to get the qualifications, get a better job and get a better pay. &gt;&gt; God will bless your effort to get the skills &gt;&gt; to get a better job to get a better pay. &gt;&gt; God blessing you sitting at home say pay pay. &gt;&gt; You will pay &gt;&gt; with your laziness. &gt;&gt; You have no work to get come inside your house. You're looking for a work not come to the house. Work doesn't come to the house. Sorry. pastor like a trouble man. But God would honor the fate. Here we go. I wrote this down. That acts when the conditions are not favorable. &gt;&gt; I challenge you tonight [applause] &gt;&gt; to act when the conditions are not favorable. Too many of you want to fail. Too many of you, you don't want to fail, so you don't try. Too many of you don't want to do because you don't want to embarrass. You don't want this to happen, that happen. Forget that. &gt;&gt; You don't know how things going to do. So you sew in the morning. You sew in the evening. Let God bless. Hallelujah. But if you don't sow, you have nothing to get. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Do a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Have a next one for you. I ain't getting the message yet. &gt;&gt; No, you know I'm not going 3 hours. I could go two and a half but not three. &gt;&gt; See? All right. Just have midnight across. Right. All right. So, Isaac obeyed and God blessed him. And watch. I like how the words were phrased. The man waxed great and went forward. Some people could ask great and go backward. You know &gt;&gt; that what I shown here know he went forward and grew. He grew again &gt;&gt; until he became very great for he had possession of flocks, possession of herds and great store of servants and the fullest had ever envy him. Remember that ah didn't have the scripture but remember that man who buried the talent. &gt;&gt; You see what God said about him? &gt;&gt; He's wicked. &gt;&gt; Now we in our human self might think it's so at least he get back you know he lose it. God not this unproductive thing you know &gt;&gt; he say add to your faith virtue unto virtue knowledge and God want God in the multiplying business in the adding business God into business you know &gt;&gt; God is a serious businessman you know &gt;&gt; when he come and see the man buried he say you wicked servant why didn't take it to the bank and get some interest on that just plain bad behavior when he said take that from that man and give it to the man who make multiply and so on he said to him that hath &gt;&gt; more shall be given &gt;&gt; and to him that hath Not even what he had shall be taken away from. &gt;&gt; You not hearing me tonight? &gt;&gt; Oh, you have to start somewhere. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. The first parable Jesus gave was the parable of the seed because that is where you start from. &gt;&gt; A seed of attitude, &gt;&gt; a seed of thinking, a seed of behavior, a seed that reframes your mind, how you think and why you think. And I'm going to show you this here right now. &gt;&gt; So Isaac swed during a time of famine. This blow my mind when I saw it. I couldn't believe it. It was famine. You know in famine you don't s you know you complain you had the fan because no rain falling. You know what I mean? You're fing your blowing and whatnot but I accident that rain falling yet but I s in the ground because you're having faith that the God that you serve will send you rain. When when brother Isaac was preaching last Sunday, he said I was home with a with a pop rail. The maxi will stop here and pick up this one as this one come up on next because God making a way. He will handle all the traffic lights, all the traffic just to make sure you get the passengers to get your bills paid. Oh, give the Lord some praises. That's when God making a way. Can we give the Lord a shout? [applause] So in a time of famine when there is no rain, this man planting Isaac planting Isaac planting. He's under expectation. Isaac of revelation. The God he serve is a God of his fathers. The God of Abraham. Oh God, he's the God [screaming] of Isaac. Hallelujah. He's swinging in faith. The conditions are unfavorable. It is dusty. It is [laughter] like desert. But he is still pulling the seed. He can't control the rain. God does. Oh, come give the Lord a shout. No man can control latter rain. God does. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The [screaming] real rain is fixing to fall. But make sure you get the seed in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the fact here we go that the Bible call and says he got a hundfold blessing. &gt;&gt; It means it's a little more than just his showing. &gt;&gt; So it wasn't just the physical act. I want to share something with you. Lots of times things we do in the natural have a a spiritual effect to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; What you seen as ordinary is not ordinary. &gt;&gt; Example, woman come to Jesus say I have a daughter of sex with the devil. She has said it's not fake to take bread casting a dog that's supposed to throw that woman off. Said she off go to Facebook and WhatsApp and Tik Tok and blow herself out and blow out the church and blow out the Jesus and blow out everybody else. She stood her grounds &gt;&gt; and say if that man called me a dog, there must be a reason behind that. &gt;&gt; Maybe God want me to see something. and she enter into what a dog sees. &gt;&gt; That's what she did. You know, &gt;&gt; she said, "But Lord, even the dog get crumbs." &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm willing to take crumbs. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "For this, &gt;&gt; your daughter [applause and cheering] is delivered." Her words affect something in the heavenly realm. [applause] Come on now. So words are not just words. There's power behind words. Hallelujah. If you can't make it and you say I can't make it, you can't make it because you said that. If you said I can make it, you can make it because you said that. Give the Lord a shout. What are you saying tonight? Tonight will be different. Oh, glory to God. Because you can get delivered tonight. You can get healed tonight. You can get free tonight. God can heal your case, heal your mind, heal your spirit, set you free tonight. All right. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; 2 Kings 4, &gt;&gt; we want to read 1-7. And I saw something this I never saw before. That's why I'm reading it. &gt;&gt; That there are certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophet of unto Elijah, saying, "Thy servant th my husband is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord." This is 2 Kings 4. And the creditor has come to take away him my two sons to be born. This fine sister lost her husband. The creditors is after her. The banks is after her. They come in to take her husband. In those days, if you can't pay, you take a turn into slavery or whatever. &gt;&gt; And Elijah said unto her, "What shall I do for thee? Tell me, what has thou in the house?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God have to have something to start with. The prophet said you had to do something for something to take place. &gt;&gt; He took up a rock and he threw it up in the air and dunk come a whirlwind &gt;&gt; and the voice of God thunder through that. He said you got to do something for something to happen. &gt;&gt; You did something tonight to come to service tonight. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; The first thing the prophet asked her is what has thou in the house? She said, "Thy handmade hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil." &gt;&gt; Just a pot. &gt;&gt; He said, "Go borrow thee vessels abroad &gt;&gt; of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels." Watch that word empty. &gt;&gt; Borrow, not a few. &gt;&gt; You know, I don't talk to their neighbors. Now, &gt;&gt; you know how long me say good morning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see how your behavior &gt;&gt; could affect your blessing? &gt;&gt; I private. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I want to ask. &gt;&gt; You going to lose your sons. You know &gt;&gt; because the critiques coming f &gt;&gt; the prophet began an answer. &gt;&gt; He said, "What in your house?" She said, "A pot of oil. Go get some vessels. &gt;&gt; What you going to do with that?" then not your business. &gt;&gt; Your business is to hear &gt;&gt; and obey. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Not of you." In other words, get them sister. &gt;&gt; Go get them. &gt;&gt; That sister had to be a sister that was a connector. &gt;&gt; Neighbor, you know, neighbor. &gt;&gt; Empty [snorts] vessels. And she going down the street, empty vessels. You have any empty vessels. They don't know what she want that for. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet continues, "And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee, upon thy sons, and shall pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full." Amen. &gt;&gt; So she went from him, shut the door upon her, upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her, and she poured out. And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, she said unto son, "Bring me yet another vessel." So this one potter of vessel of oil was pouring fulling. Once that vessel empty it full it &gt;&gt; what she now empty full &gt;&gt; empty full &gt;&gt; and she keeps pouring this one pot of oil filling buckets of oil. &gt;&gt; Get the point I want to get that. &gt;&gt; It came to pass when the vessels were full she said unto son bring me yet another vessel. He said unto her, "There is not a vessel more." &gt;&gt; And the oil stayed. &gt;&gt; What about Isaac? This blow me out. &gt;&gt; Oil was coming as long as there was enough empty vessels there to collect it. &gt;&gt; You cannot expect God to pour where the vessels are not empty. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [cheering] In the amplified, this verse says, "When the vessels were full, she said to her son, bring me another vessel." And he said to her, "There's none left." Then the oil stopped multiplying. &gt;&gt; The oil was multiplying based on vessels being empty. &gt;&gt; Do you want to be an empty vessel tonight? &gt;&gt; Or you're full of yourself. Or you're full of your ego. Or you're full of you have to prove a point. Or do you want to empty that out tonight? Give the Lord a shout. There must too much people full of the self. God want that self empty out. God want you to be the empty vessel that he could pour out into [screaming] you. The oil of God. You have been hindered yourself. Don't blame the pastor. Don't blame the elder. Don't blame some cousin, uncle, aunt or father, mother. You have nobody to blame. &gt;&gt; Get it [screaming] out of you. become an empty vessel. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness. They shall be filled. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. Too much of blaming. Cut it out. [cheering] You are immature when you're blaming. Accept responsibility for your actions and your attitude. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Isaac didn't curse the famine. Isaac didn't curse the dryness. And there's no rain. What Isaac did, he cut the corn, he got the seeds, and he put it in the ground. Because you know God is responsible for rain. I am responsible to put the seed in the ground. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Some of you stunned. [cheering] You didn't expect on the oldest night. &gt;&gt; So you expect God to take the seed and plant it for you? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; You really expect that? Even you may be seated. &gt;&gt; Even the parable with Jesus and SW seed, he says some fell on the way side, &gt;&gt; boys come and take it. You come home. God again. They going to throw seeds. There some people know they're so negative. They throw it and it flop and birds take it and you're done. &gt;&gt; The birds must take some. They can't take all. &gt;&gt; Some fell on rocks. &gt;&gt; Some fell among thorns. But some fell on good ground. &gt;&gt; Don't bother with the birds take. The bird must take some. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You're planting. I had teeth and you want the teeth to thief. The chief must leave some. &gt;&gt; You have 10 acres. If the teeth one acre, you have 9 acres remaining. [applause] &gt;&gt; I planting the teeth. &gt;&gt; You're a fool. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, preacher, preacher, don't be so rough now. &gt;&gt; Why you getting the message home now? &gt;&gt; Some fell on the way side. &gt;&gt; Jesus preached that. Some fell among the rocks. The jumpy jumpy jump fast. After two services, they gone. &gt;&gt; It's rock. They have no anchor. &gt;&gt; Some fell among thorns. Oh god, it's the work. It's the job. It's my husband and the vine up. So, &gt;&gt; you know what? Bubble corn. You corn with one grain in it. You plant one grain to get one grain. The cares of life choke you. &gt;&gt; So instead of you come blossoming and strong and anchored as a vine, you complaining and you're vexed and somebody triggering you and you're off key and what vines you know tie you up, you know. &gt;&gt; But some fell among good ground &gt;&gt; bringing forth 60fold, &gt;&gt; 80fold, 100fold. You [screaming] are good ground tonight. [applause] Empty vessels, &gt;&gt; empty of self, &gt;&gt; empty of the insecurities, empty of all what you want to do to get validation &gt;&gt; to prove your worthow. I go show them wait. Come on, get out of that. Okay. All right. Let's go. So, brother Brandon was very zealous of the kind of seed he had to sw because orus was there to sew the Pentecostal seed. Billy Graham was there to sw the denominational seed and he was there to bring a seed to catch a bride. &gt;&gt; So, we are not brandites. We are not a denomination. We are sons of God &gt;&gt; that going to be birthed out of the word of God. Because man shall not by bread alone, but by every word that come out the mouth of God. If God's mouth speak to you tonight of your healing, of your deliverance and breakthrough, there's not devils in hell to stop that. &gt;&gt; This power goes through time space, goes through barriers. This is what we talking about. The power of God by the word of God. I'm here to preach the word. God is here to confirm the word that I'm preaching. And God will confirm it to you because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Go give the Lord some praises. Let's [cheering] go. God never intended the church to be run by men. &gt;&gt; God runs his church and he runs it through the gifts of the spirit. The gifts of the spirit in the church is to correct the spirit. &gt;&gt; He got five ministerial offices in the church. Apostles, teachers, prophets, evangelists, pastors. That's the elected officers of the church. And in each local church, there's nine spiritual gifts that's come among the people, which is knowledge, wisdoms, gifts of healing, working of miracles, speaking with tongues, interpretation of tongues. All these things go in a local body and every person in the church has an individual ministry and that individual ministry goes individual ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry to edify the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; So you are not here for yourself. You are here to be part of this glorious body of Christ to edify the body of Christ. This here is a fellowship where we come to. But the body of Christ is a universal body because by one spirit God put you into that body called the body of Jesus Christ. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is a woman touched his garment and she was healed with a blood issue. A soldier spit in his face but a crown of his thorns in his head felt no virtue. It's your approach. The attitude is what it takes. And that's what it is tonight dear friend. It takes the attitude. We are and believe that we are in the presence of Jesus Christ. It's your attitude that brings the results. &gt;&gt; The mechanics is here and so is the dynamics. &gt;&gt; But hear the fine print. If you can get started, &gt;&gt; God will do the rest. Give the Lord a shout. If you could get started, God will do the rest. When David challenged when Goliath challenged David, David said, "I'll go fight him." He said, "I'm a dog. You bring a little boy to me." David start to wing up his his sling. Run to me, Goliath. And each one of us have our own Goliath to deal with. You can't you can't defeat what you're not prepared to confront. You have to confront your own Goliath. You have to confront your own demons. You have to confront your own issues. Stop blaming everyone. If you could get started, start it tonight with the right attitude. Start tonight to change your thinking. The whole world is against you and like God vex with you and you're angry with God. God say I love you. &gt;&gt; That's why you're here. That's why you're alive. He going to kill you a long time ago. He said, "But I love you." &gt;&gt; His love is elective love. He can send you through the waters. He can send you through the flood. He can send you through the fire. But all come through the blood. Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It don't have to work out how you think it going to work out. But it's going to work out fine because Romans 8:28 teaches us all things work together for good. To them that love God. To them who are the called accord to his purpose. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Oh, we know God. God kill you for your first sin, but they're still here because God put blood there. Oh, give the Lord a shout because the judgment seat have blood in it. It's a mercy seat. Do I hear a shout inside of here? It's a judgment seat, you know, but God put blood in it and that makes it a mercy seat. [applause] Let me drop a bomb here one time. And the mercy seat of the blood for this is brotherly kindness. &gt;&gt; Without that is judgment. &gt;&gt; Jesus prayed a prayer. Father, forgive us as we forgive those that trespass against us. You have no forgiveness if you don't want to forgive somebody else. Give the Lord a shout in the house. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Faith is based upon forgiveness, not anger, &gt;&gt; not temper, &gt;&gt; not bad behavior and bad as you. Faith &gt;&gt; is based upon forgiveness. Even Jesus on the cross, them wicked people saying crucify, he said, "Father, forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; The old crooked thief on the side of him too said why you don't save us and save yourself. So &gt;&gt; he dying &gt;&gt; but your mouth hot. &gt;&gt; He dying but he still don't care. The other thief said oh God we are old man. This man different. &gt;&gt; He reframed things. Lord remember me. That man never opened a Bible, never went to a church, never again baptized, never hold hallelujah glory or sing some special or sing some church song. Jesus said today &gt;&gt; you will be with me. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. [applause] [cheering] Let me see that. I shared in Africa, shared other places about the woman caught in actry. &gt;&gt; How that went to public to private. &gt;&gt; How all them had their big stone to stone tree &gt;&gt; because she got she caught in the very act. And Jesus said okay. The act Moses lost it a stone. He said okay. He said yeah. Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; All have stone. Good. &gt;&gt; Which one of you without sin? Loose that stone. And he turned his back to them, not to embrace them, not to shame them, but to get them the opportunity to examine their hearts to walk away because they were hypocrites. &gt;&gt; And when all of them walk away, he said, "Woman, where are your accusers?" &gt;&gt; She said, she she she herself didn't even know when they left. &gt;&gt; She said, "None, my Lord." He said, "Neither &gt;&gt; do I condemn thee. &gt;&gt; Go and sin no more. You could live harder than that. You could be better than that." He point out where she could go. in terms of life &gt;&gt; freed her from that. &gt;&gt; But you know something about that story? &gt;&gt; Nobody was there to hear Jesus said that to her. &gt;&gt; Nobody was [screaming] there. It might have be good if them hypocrit was there to hear Jesus forgive me. Everybody know but was she and Jesus alone. &gt;&gt; So she had to walk &gt;&gt; with faith &gt;&gt; with revelation knowing everybody know what she did. But God Rich in mercy, [cheering] set her free. That is why you should be shouted tonight. And don't sit there like some dumb dog in Israel. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Give the Lord a praise. [cheering] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. Jesus saved me. There's a song we sing. The Lord save me. Why should [screaming] I be bound? I've been baptized in [music] Jesus name. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Watch this. [applause] &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Job had no Bible to read. He went by inspiration &gt;&gt; with inspired. &gt;&gt; That's it. It's got the mechanics ready. The church if only dynamics tonight. If we get the mechanics ready, &gt;&gt; get our hearts right. &gt;&gt; The things that we can do. &gt;&gt; What's the mechanics? The car. The dynamics come like the battery. So if you have a car and there's no battery inside the car and you're taking pictures on Instagram and you're telling people, boy, you have a brand new ride, but you see that right car drives. A little boy with a three tricycle passing you straight. He more power than you. You understand? Because you a fancy car. You had the rims and you and you polish it and whatn not. Let us go. No, not not today. Not today. You want [laughter] to move today? You only taking pictures today &gt;&gt; because all you have is mechanic. you have nothing. If you have dynamics, you could turn the key and let the engine tumble, &gt;&gt; let the engine rumble. I don't want to know mechanics. I want to be able to turn the key and press gas and drive. &gt;&gt; Well, that is what the church needs, &gt;&gt; the power to press gas and drive. But we have a [screaming] promise. You shall receive power after the Holy Ghost comes upon you. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So you getting into 2026 under a power, under an expectation, under a [screaming] promise. Well, give the Lord a shout in the house. That is where we at. [cheering] Glory. Hallelujah. If you get the mechanics ready, get our hearts right. the things we can do. Follow every word, follow him in baptism, follow him in every order he told us to do. Get every mechanic ready and stand there. Then we are ready for the dynamics to be lit off. And only God can do that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; So we know Jesus from age 12 to 30, he was under silence. &gt;&gt; He said nothing. &gt;&gt; He was just working in the carpenter shop. He was normal living. &gt;&gt; But then John the Baptist came &gt;&gt; and cause a rock in the island. &gt;&gt; So to rock the place. He said there is one standing among you. &gt;&gt; You see the man yet? &gt;&gt; By faith he is preaching &gt;&gt; because he know he was forced sent to forrun the Messiah. &gt;&gt; One day Jesus come down the water. Stand up in line to get baptized. And John baptized this one and baptized that one. Here come Jesus. He said I have need for you to baptize me. And Jesus said that might be so but behoo us to fulfill our righteousness. And and John baptized Jesus and the dove came upon Jesus. And the Lord told John the one that you see the dove come down &gt;&gt; and remain &gt;&gt; because sometime the dove has come down and go. &gt;&gt; When the dove come down thinking is an alarm is a wolf. &gt;&gt; But when that dove come upon Jesus, it stayed there. &gt;&gt; And John said, "Behold the lamb of God." &gt;&gt; It changed from the prophet to the prophecy. Oh give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It changed from the prophet to the prophecy. &gt;&gt; And Jesus now led by the spirit &gt;&gt; gone into the wilderness. No elder, no deacon, &gt;&gt; no song tape. &gt;&gt; And he beat that devil. &gt;&gt; It is written. &gt;&gt; It is written. It is also written. And when he come back, the Bible said he came back in the power &gt;&gt; of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. [cheering] &gt;&gt; But he he went into the temple and they said somebody I want somebody to read this morning. Was not Bible like this was scrolls. &gt;&gt; And Jesus went and find Isaiah scrolled down to Isaiah 61. And he begin to read. Hallelujah. The spirit is upon me &gt;&gt; because he has anointed me &gt;&gt; to preach to God. Now they think he reading text you &gt;&gt; they think that was a text that night you know &gt;&gt; but he was reading a living word &gt;&gt; he knew it anointed him &gt;&gt; he knew God is with him it's a present tense reality but they think it's just an text [applause and cheering] he sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captive and the recover of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised and to preach is the acceptable year of the Lord. And then Jesus closed the book. And then he sat down and said, "This day this scripture is fulfilled &gt;&gt; in your ear." &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. What are we going to say this year? Hallelujah. One of these days, Revelation 20:17, the spirit and the bride say, "Come." &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; The bride will have a voice. The voice of God will be in her. Every devil will know it. Hell will know it. The message world will know it. Those false anointed going to know it. Or give the Lord a shout because the manifestation will be the interpretation. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. My God. Paul to Timothy. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but will heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and will turn from the truth to fables. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So Jesus told his own disciples, don't preach anymore until they went in the power of the spirit, &gt;&gt; waiting in the seat of Jerusalem until you endure with power from on high. &gt;&gt; You are not to go out until it's not you but God. Here it is. That the people can see. Here we go. Brother Angley. The reflection of Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Not not not I have a gift I could preach. Anybody could preach. &gt;&gt; Anybody could take the scripture give without repentance. But what he's talking about is a life &gt;&gt; because that's the thunder that's going to shake the devil. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; How much ministers and pastors crack because there's no life there. &gt;&gt; You ever knock a piece of wood and it's empty? &gt;&gt; You're knocking. So yeah, afterward chilly BB they call it a lot of finding coming out there. You know the worms eating out on the inside then &gt;&gt; it looking good on the outside. And Jesus told them Pharisees he said your white is the fulcers outside looking white and clean be like inside of you dead men bones. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Am I frightening you? &gt;&gt; Hell, hell hotter than this, you know. &gt;&gt; So, this is not frightening you at all. &gt;&gt; This is just trying to get the word to you &gt;&gt; because the word is God. &gt;&gt; Don't blame me and don't shoot me, you know. &gt;&gt; Don't wait to beat me up in the corner when I leave the church. You know, not this not my message, you know. This is his message, you know. &gt;&gt; He said every mountain shall be made low. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the Messiah is coming. Anytime Jesus coming, you got to make a way. You can't just ordinary. Listen, you may be seated. &gt;&gt; We just come through Christmas there. &gt;&gt; It's power washing. &gt;&gt; It's lights. &gt;&gt; It's is all kind of thing the people pay &gt;&gt; for Santa. &gt;&gt; Santa coming to town. &gt;&gt; You better do go by them when the Christmas season over that anointing way off. They want to know what you're doing in front of the see all now. So it might still get end up a little small a little cake and thing. But you going out the season, you want the water on you from my house. What that Christmas atmosphere go on, you know. &gt;&gt; This is just a spirit atmosphere, you know. &gt;&gt; So Jesus come back with the power of the spirit. &gt;&gt; And when he said it's fulfilled, they kick him out. &gt;&gt; It's not this Joseph's son. &gt;&gt; Are you talking? &gt;&gt; And when he walk out, he said heal the sick, cast out devils, rock Jerusalem, &gt;&gt; scribes, Pharisees, Herodians, Esenes, all of them. They're in trouble &gt;&gt; because this young man rocking the place. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a [screaming] shout. Wait till this bride strike the latter rain. She going to rock this place. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Devils cast out. Blind seeing cripples walking. Oh, give the Lord a shouting house. Power feel it. It is promised. I'm expecting it. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Are you expecting it? Are you looking for him? &gt;&gt; Paul Paul was unorganized but led by the spirit. &gt;&gt; All right. He said Paul an apostle not of men neither of man but by Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Galatians Paul says he said um that that many false brethren unawares brought in who came privy to spout our liberty. For brethren, &gt;&gt; they find you making much of noise. &gt;&gt; They call us the exercising church. We get up not become migrants. &gt;&gt; This the place exercise shout and jump &gt;&gt; but they sit down &gt;&gt; like most back church members dead as a doornail &gt;&gt; rocking in the arms of Morpheus &gt;&gt; killing sleep in church. man even saying it going on his subconscious men snoring [snorts] and a man will say it going on your subconscious what what foolishness is that you understand what the devil does why you get people on cigarette and smoking and gi whatnot to mess their mind up that they receive Christ &gt;&gt; when they boozing they can't be sober enough keep them drunk keep them stupified [applause] &gt;&gt; what devil make Tik Tok on them thing for &gt;&gt; keep them busy &gt;&gt; everywhere You go man selling thing and they watching where they selling you know they have things to sell. I seen them on the side of the road, but they doing so now. If it wasn't before, hey, coconut this they calling people for to to buy, but no, they doing so. You have to stop them is big shots. &gt;&gt; If you don't stop, they going to say and they don't mind because &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Once you have something going, you have to make preparation. That's why God was so angry when the king invited the people to the wedding supper. He said, "Come, come." I said, "Ah, let's buy a cow. They have this excuse. Just get married." He say, "Listen, go to the highways and get the byways and go and get them because I already killed the meat. It have curry goat. It have curry chicken. It have roti. It have what? All the meals you're talking about, it is there. Get them and let them sit down there." &gt;&gt; The man come and said there was moon. He said, "Go, go, compel them. &gt;&gt; Compel them." &gt;&gt; So if you sit here in your arrogance, if you sit here in your pomposity, there's a big word. Never used that word here before. If you sit here and you're big shot, God will bring people in. &gt;&gt; Halt, lame, [screaming] blind, prostitute, you name them. They will come in here and God will free them and they're going to shout and dance. And you will stay with your stiff hand that can't go off. Go give the Lord a shout. I'm going to dance tonight. I'm going to shout tonight. I'm going to praise God tonight. Oh, glory to God. I am not now. So, God coming at 17 years old. I was on fire 1975 and I am still on fire now. [cheering] Give the [screaming] Lord a shout. If I die and I'm in a box, you be be careful if you pass by that box. If you touch that body, you may get fired through. Look at the Lord. I shout. [screaming] There's fire in my [laughter] There's fire in my feet. There's fire in my bones. It is all over me. It is keeping me alive. It is the Holy Ghost and fire. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; My Lord. Hallelujah. Paul is the one that said, "I came unto you not with excellency of speech, but I watch but I was in weakness and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power." &gt;&gt; Why? That your faith should have stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there sat Acts 14:8. And they sack a certain man at Lististra, impotent in his feet, being a from his mother's womb, who never had walked. The same heard Paul speak, who steadfastly beholden him, and perceiving him to have faith to be healed, he said with a loud voice, stand upright on thy feet, &gt;&gt; and he leaped and walked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was Paul. &gt;&gt; That is under the power of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There sat a widow, a certain young man named Eruus, being fallen into deep sleep. And Paul was preaching long, he sung down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft and taken up dead. And Paul went down and fell on him, embracing him. Trouble not yourselves, for his life is in him. And when the devil was come up again and broken bread and eaten, and talked a long while till the break of day, so he departed, and he brought the young man alive, and they were a little comforted. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. right away. If they are held in his hands, they are associated with his power. That is what the hand signifies. It signifies the power of God and the authority of God. Not one of them came in his own power and authority. That is what Paul said. No man would dare to. It takes the authority of God and the power of the Holy Ghost. The gospel is preached by the authority of God and the in the power of the spirit. These men were all empowered by the Holy Ghost. They all stood up to the world. They could not do that. They were full of God. They were sent or authorized by God, not by self or another man. &gt;&gt; So it goes to show men could be authorized by another man &gt;&gt; or by self. &gt;&gt; How about the close as the time just picks on us? My message of grace. The prophet said this. He said, I want you to notice he shall never say shall bring forth the cornerstone. He shall bring forth the headstone. And we know that the scriptures say that Jesus Christ in the f chief chief cornerstone. Therefore, this end time 78 messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers. In other words, rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit. And that is what I'm looking for in 2026 to see the church built and all the flesh pots and the fleshly people. You lost your flesh and you come out the flesh and come out the spirit and you walk by faith and you talk by faith and you live by faith and you do like Isaac. You're putting seeds when it's time of famine because you know rain is coming. Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One man look on the ground and say famine, I can't plant because there is no rain. Another [screaming] man look at the same ground as I planting. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because rain coming. &gt;&gt; Oh the Lord I shout rain is coming. All right, let's go. The promised land. Music. Come on, please. The promised land. Oh, let me read it back here a little bit now. The promise is the baptism of the spirit, &gt;&gt; which is promised in the Old Testament and the new. The promise is, "Behold, I send the promise of my father upon you." That is the promise. &gt;&gt; The promised land is to live in this land of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; that God promised for the church. Is to live, Here we go, in the power of the spirit. &gt;&gt; It's another world. It's another land. &gt;&gt; Hear this. Hear this. You have to come out of the condition that you have been in to come to live in this land. &gt;&gt; And as we close, as we hear the explosions and money literally go up in smoke, &gt;&gt; literally all these explosions, money literally exploding in smoke. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon prayed. Heavenly Father, as we stand here, as many torches dying out in the hearts of the mistakes of the last year and we approaching the debt of we say 2025 and the birth of 2026, God may we be one step higher up the ladder until we can see Jesus on his program. May everyone here Lord in prayer while the old year is dying and the new birth of the new year is coming in. May the old man of sin and unbelief doubt in our heart and the new birth come in with 2026 like a rushing mighty wind. Make us fit servants. Forgive our past. Bless our future. Guide us, oh Lord, with thy mighty hand. Bless these ministers here. Bless all the ley, all the visitors. Be thou with us, Lord. We are your servants. We give ourselves holy to you for 2026. that the power of your spirit might have more preeminences in our life, in our being. Help us God. Forgive us and help us. We pray. Raise up mighty men. Raise up mighty wires of the faith. Open this year Lord that hidden manner that rock beneath the rock that we might see the program of God. Cap off the pyramids of our life. Put on the capstone Christ Jesus. May each and everyone upon us, each and every one of us. May his great magnificent holy blessing come upon us. May the fire of the Holy Ghost come upon us. May the power of the resurrection be manifested. How we thank thee tonight. We are yours. We give ourselves holy to you.
