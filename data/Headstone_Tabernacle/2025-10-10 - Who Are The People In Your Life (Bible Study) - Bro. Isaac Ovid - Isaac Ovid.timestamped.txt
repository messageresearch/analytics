[11:36] I have desire
[11:39] to follow Jesus.

[12:46] No turning back.

[13:03] back.
[13:05] No turning back. No turning
[13:10] back.
[13:14] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[13:19] Uh so good to be here this evening.
[13:23] Trust everyone is doing well. Can we
[13:24] just bow our heads for a word of prayer?
[13:27] Our gracious heavenly father, we thank
[13:29] you tonight that we could gather in this
[13:32] way Lord in this format Lord on a Friday
[13:35] evening. There are so many things we
[13:38] could be doing but we have chosen to be
[13:40] here only by your grace Lord. You have
[13:43] invited us Lord to hear a word from you
[13:47] Lord. So we thank you for life, for
[13:49] health, for strength, for your mercy,
[13:51] for your loving kindness, and Lord, for
[13:53] being able to bring us together in this
[13:55] way. Lord, at this time, we pray for the
[13:58] Bible study that we're about to have. We
[14:00] pray for those that are already in this
[14:02] meeting, those that would join along the
[14:05] way, those that would listen to the
[14:07] recording, and Lord, we commit the
[14:09] entire session into your hands. We pray
[14:11] for each one that's here, Lord. That
[14:14] Lord, we come into this meeting looking
[14:17] for different things, Lord. Looking for
[14:18] a word of encouragement, looking for a
[14:21] word to remind us of who we are, Lord.
[14:23] Many dealing with situations in their
[14:26] homes, in their families, on their jobs,
[14:27] in their lives. But through it all, we
[14:30] are dependent upon you to, Lord, be our
[14:32] anchor, to be our shield, to be our
[14:34] protector, and be our guide. We pray for
[14:37] anyone that's sick this evening, Lord,
[14:39] that needs a touch in their body, Lord,
[14:41] in their mind, in their soul, whatever
[14:44] it might be. Whatever frustration, pain,
[14:46] sickness, whatever the doctor may have
[14:48] declared that they have, we resist it
[14:51] tonight and come against it tonight in
[14:52] the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, knowing
[14:55] that you already paid the price for all
[14:57] our sicknesses, you pray the you paid
[14:59] the price for every disease, Lord.
[15:01] You're not now doing it. It is already
[15:03] done. So, we are claiming it tonight. We
[15:04] are applying it tonight Lord. There are
[15:06] so many situations Lord Father
[15:10] domestically, regionally, globally Lord
[15:12] that we can lift up in prayer to you. So
[15:14] we come tonight, Father, looking for
[15:16] more of you and that you would speak a
[15:17] word to us. We commit each one into your
[15:20] hands in the precious name of Jesus
[15:21] Christ. And the church says, "Amen and
[15:24] amen and amen." We are certainly happy
[15:26] to be here one more time tonight for a
[15:29] Bible study. Certainly welcome the
[15:31] church. Welcome any visitors who are
[15:33] here. And if you are here for the first
[15:35] time, we are so delighted to have you
[15:37] with us as we celebrate around God's
[15:40] word. We have only one objective to lift
[15:43] the name of Jesus higher. And we believe
[15:46] that the Bible is the word of God. We
[15:49] believe that God through scripture has
[15:52] placed all things in the word that
[15:55] pertains to life and godliness. And
[15:57] through the passage of time, different
[15:59] prophets, messengers, voices would have
[16:02] been identified to help bring light to
[16:04] what was written in the word. And in
[16:06] this age that we live in and this time
[16:08] we live in, we believe that God sent a
[16:10] prophet to make things plain to us. And
[16:13] it must dovetail perfectly with
[16:14] scripture. So, we are so grateful
[16:16] tonight that we could be gathered
[16:18] together and be able to have fellowship
[16:20] around the word of God um in a time when
[16:23] the world is characterized by so much
[16:25] darkness, so much uncertainty, so much
[16:28] calamity, so much stresses. To know that
[16:30] you could have something that you could
[16:32] hook on to or connect with that reminds
[16:34] us that we are creatures of eternity
[16:37] trapped in time. Reminds us that there's
[16:39] a world that's more real than this world
[16:41] that we experience. that there is a hope
[16:44] that's more valuable than the depression
[16:47] and the frustrations and even though we
[16:49] are connected virtually in this this
[16:51] Zoom room that I pray that as the word
[16:54] comes forth and this conversation around
[16:56] scripture takes place that your home
[16:58] could become a a holy ground a place
[17:00] that you could find Jesus because he's
[17:03] not limited by time he's not limited by
[17:05] space he's not limited by distance and
[17:07] our objective is that at the end of this
[17:10] session we are drawn closer to him and
[17:13] that's a principle of life itself. If as
[17:16] days progress you are not seeing
[17:18] progress in your life, you are not
[17:19] seeing achievements in your life, it
[17:21] should be a cautionary tale. We need to
[17:24] look at ourselves because our goal, our
[17:26] ambition must be to be better than we
[17:29] were yesterday. We must be able to look
[17:31] back and see that something has changed
[17:33] in us. You know, we can't keep living
[17:36] the same way all the time. Something has
[17:38] to have progress. And you meet a lot of
[17:40] people today. People are talking about
[17:42] more depression, more frustration, more
[17:44] anxiety, more mental health issues,
[17:47] challenges, more stresses, and that's
[17:49] the nature of it. But God has said, "I
[17:51] am the Lord and I change not." He is
[17:53] still a peace in the midst of the storm.
[17:56] He is still a comfort. He is still a
[17:58] friend that could stick closer to a
[18:00] brother. So, I will not be too long with
[18:02] you tonight. Um, but by the grace of
[18:04] God, we trust that something will be
[18:07] said tonight. If it's just one word from
[18:09] the Lord to one person, it's worth us
[18:11] coming together tonight. So I encourage
[18:13] you if you are here, be here. If you are
[18:15] present, be present. Don't take this
[18:17] casual. Don't take this light because
[18:20] words are very powerful and the future,
[18:23] your future is really defined by the
[18:25] words that you hear. You know, if you
[18:27] listen to certain voices every day,
[18:28] you're getting a channel of that voice
[18:30] that you hear. But if you have the right
[18:32] voice coming to you, it could point you
[18:33] in a way and push you into where you
[18:35] want to go. And to that end, it's tied
[18:39] to our study tonight. And the study is
[18:42] really a question tonight. And the
[18:44] question is, who are the people in your
[18:47] life? That's what we want to talk about
[18:49] tonight. Who are the people in your
[18:53] life? And I think it's an important
[18:56] question because when you look at a
[18:59] person, you don't just see that person.
[19:02] That person is the product of every
[19:04] influence, every conversation, every
[19:07] experience they have had. They are the
[19:10] product of good advice. They are the
[19:12] product of bad advice. There are things
[19:14] that I'm sure you could remember that
[19:15] your primary school teacher may have
[19:17] told you. Your secondary school teacher
[19:19] may have told you. You may have been in
[19:20] the cadets. You may have been in this
[19:22] and that. And you are the sum total of
[19:25] the people who have been in your life.
[19:27] If you could look back and see there
[19:30] have been situations that you have been
[19:32] through or experiences that you have had
[19:34] or decisions that you would have made
[19:36] because someone told you you should do
[19:38] this you know you should do that why you
[19:40] don't do this why you don't do that and
[19:41] had it not been for these people in your
[19:44] life your life would have been in a
[19:47] different place today and this applies
[19:50] on both sides because there are people
[19:51] in our lives who have a positive
[19:54] influence on us and there are people who
[19:56] in our lives and they have a completely
[19:58] negative influence and that is looking
[20:01] at it from your perspective. But what
[20:03] about the people's whose life you are
[20:05] in? Are you an influence? Are you having
[20:08] a positive influence on anyone? And part
[20:11] of this thought tonight comes from a
[20:14] conversation we would have had in church
[20:16] a few weeks ago where we would have
[20:18] referenced two men and and we would
[20:20] probably close on that thought. in the
[20:23] days of Jesus that they were both
[20:25] paralyzed. They were they both had
[20:27] needs, they both had situations and the
[20:31] only real difference because Jesus was
[20:33] present, healing was available,
[20:35] deliverance was available, hope was
[20:37] available and the only difference
[20:40] between these two men was the people who
[20:44] was in their lives. In the case of one,
[20:47] he said there is no man. And it it
[20:50] speaks of the man who was at the pool of
[20:51] Bethesda for 38 years. Year in year out,
[20:54] he is looking for deliverance. He's
[20:57] looking for help. He's looking for
[20:58] change in his life. And that's a good
[21:01] thing. When you want change, that's a
[21:02] positive thing. It speaks volumes about
[21:04] your character that you want to be out
[21:06] of the condition that you might be in.
[21:08] Whether it's it's it's a financial
[21:10] issue, whether it's a family issue, a
[21:12] job issue, a health issue, a issue of
[21:15] identity, whatever it might be, this man
[21:17] for 38 years was looking for a solution.
[21:20] And the Bible says that at the pool, at
[21:23] a certain season, the angel would come
[21:25] and stir the water and whoever jumped
[21:27] into the pool first would get whatever
[21:29] they asked for. And this man had the
[21:32] right objective. He understood the
[21:34] assignment, as they would say now. He
[21:36] understood that if he got there and he
[21:38] understood that if he got in first, help
[21:40] would come to him. But when Jesus met
[21:42] him and Jesus did, if I could use the
[21:45] word, the interview, he made the
[21:47] statement, there's no man who could put
[21:49] me in the pool. In other words, there
[21:51] was nobody in his life who he could have
[21:54] relied on, who he could have counted on.
[21:57] And I draw reference during COVID in
[21:59] particular on a global level. There were
[22:02] people who passed away and no one knew
[22:04] they passed away because there was very
[22:06] sadly no people in their lives. How
[22:10] tragic it is when you can't build
[22:13] connections.
[22:15] And it's important to build connections,
[22:17] but it's more important to build the
[22:19] right connections. We could contrast, we
[22:21] could compare the scenario of this man
[22:24] at the pool of Bethesda with another
[22:26] paralyzed man who had four friends. And
[22:29] while Jesus is preaching, they open up
[22:31] the roof above Jesus. And these four
[22:34] friends interrupt the service to drop
[22:36] their friend in front of Jesus for
[22:39] healing. Paralyzed man. But there was
[22:41] something about him that built a
[22:43] relation. So we want to take it through
[22:45] scripture. And I want to start in the
[22:47] book of Genesis. I'm going to talk a
[22:49] bit. We're going to read a bit and by
[22:51] the grace of God share a few things that
[22:52] hopefully could reframe our thinking and
[22:54] our approach with a few things.
[22:58] In the beginning,
[23:00] everything was perfect.
[23:02] As God was progressing through the days
[23:05] of creation,
[23:08] every single day he said it is good.
[23:12] Animals good, trees good, sea, land
[23:16] good. The entire sequence of creation
[23:19] from day one to day six there was a
[23:22] status report at the end of every day
[23:24] and the conclusion was good. If you had
[23:27] taken a picture on the seventh day it
[23:31] was good.
[23:32] Every single thing was good. That's what
[23:34] the Bible says. It was good. It was good
[23:36] at the conclusion of every day. And then
[23:38] the pattern broke after that. And for
[23:42] the first time in history, God could
[23:44] describe something he saw as not good.
[23:48] And when he said not good, this was
[23:50] before sin. This was before sickness. In
[23:54] a perfect Eden with a perfect man, in a
[23:57] perfect environment,
[23:59] there was no drugs. There was no sin.
[24:01] There was no robbery. There was no
[24:03] fornication. There was no adultery.
[24:05] There was no temptation. There was no
[24:07] issues. God actually found something
[24:09] that was not good. in a perfect
[24:12] creation. And he looked at man in his
[24:15] condition, in his position, his position
[24:18] of power, his position of authority. And
[24:20] I want us to be very clear here. This is
[24:23] before fallen man. And God said, "What
[24:26] is not good? It is not good for man to
[24:28] be alone."
[24:30] And we realize it was a parallel between
[24:33] God himself.
[24:35] Because before God created man, before
[24:38] God created angels, before God created
[24:40] what we see today, he existed alone and
[24:44] it was not a comfortable feeling. In
[24:46] fact, he did not want to be alone. So
[24:48] the very product of creation was to
[24:51] create fellowship. God himself wanted
[24:54] fellowship. And God looking at his son
[24:57] in a perfect place Eden in a perfect
[25:00] state position as a perfect man Adam
[25:03] said I'm not satisfied with this picture
[25:05] because if you live your life alone with
[25:08] no connections
[25:11] your life is limited. So from God's own
[25:15] intervention. So I want to make the
[25:17] point very clear to us. It was not Adam
[25:19] who went through a process of
[25:21] selfdiscovery
[25:22] and say you know what I'm missing
[25:24] something. He did not even know he was
[25:27] missing something.
[25:29] It was God who was observing on the
[25:31] outside who brought to the four or
[25:34] brought to presentation that there's
[25:37] something missing from this picture. And
[25:39] therein we see before sin even came
[25:42] there was a problem before sin. And the
[25:45] problem was solitude.
[25:47] The problem was a lack of connection.
[25:50] And therein lies the foundation of
[25:52] having the right type of connections in
[25:55] your life. I'm not just talking about
[25:57] marriage. I'm talking about brotherhood.
[25:59] I'm talking about friendship. I'm
[26:00] talking about connection in general that
[26:03] we were created to have relation. We
[26:06] were created to have fellowship. We were
[26:08] created to be able to connect with other
[26:11] people. It is a tragedy when people
[26:14] achieve quote unquote success and
[26:17] there's no one to celebrate with.
[26:20] There are countless stories of people
[26:22] who fought to get to the top and when
[26:24] they got to the top there's nobody else
[26:26] with them. They're there and they are
[26:28] not happy. They have money in the bank
[26:30] and they look in the mirror and they are
[26:32] not happy. They have a car, they have a
[26:34] house, they have three houses, but
[26:36] there's no one they could fellowship
[26:38] with. And across the board when it comes
[26:41] to the closing days of their lives, they
[26:44] would always say, "We I wish I had more
[26:46] connections. I wish I had invested more
[26:49] in my children." I And what they're
[26:51] really speaking about is relationship
[26:53] and having the right kind of
[26:56] relationship.
[26:59] So I want to underscore even in a
[27:02] perfect environment with a perfect man
[27:04] in a perfect position, there was a
[27:06] missing element.
[27:09] And in this we could build in this and
[27:11] I'm going to jump a bit through a few
[27:13] scriptures to kind of reconnect certain
[27:15] dots. So I want to jump now to
[27:20] the law if I call it the law of
[27:22] association that we'll find in Psalms 1.
[27:26] very familiar scripture but I want to
[27:28] just read through a few verses then to
[27:30] slow down again because here we are
[27:33] building that God who is relational in
[27:37] nature expects us to have relations
[27:40] expects us to have connections expects
[27:43] us to relate with others but he's very
[27:45] careful in how we do it so Psalms 1
[27:49] verse1 said blessed is the man that
[27:52] walketh not in the counsel of the
[27:55] ungodly very familiar scripture. Nor
[27:57] standeth in the way of sinners, nor
[28:00] siteth in the seat of the scornful, but
[28:03] his delight is in the law of the Lord
[28:05] and in his law that he meditate day and
[28:08] night. And he shall be like a tree
[28:11] planted by the rivers of water that
[28:13] bringeth forth his fruit in his season.
[28:16] His leaf also shall not wither and
[28:18] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. So
[28:21] within these three verses speaks about
[28:23] success, speaks about prosperity. Are
[28:27] you with me? Speaks about progress. But
[28:29] before you even talk about those, God
[28:31] deals with your connections. He talks
[28:33] about who is in your life, which is the
[28:37] question tonight. Who are the people in
[28:39] your life? And he takes it through a
[28:40] journey. He speaks about walking,
[28:42] standing, and sitting. So let's take it
[28:45] a bit slower again. Now he said,
[28:46] "Blessed is the man that walketh."
[28:50] So God expects you to be in a state of
[28:53] action and move in. So you say, if
[28:54] you're walking, be careful who you walk
[28:56] with
[28:58] because I don't want you to walk in the
[29:00] counsel of the ungodly. Many people get
[29:03] into trouble because of bad advice. You
[29:06] have to be careful who you getting
[29:08] advice from. There is such a thing as
[29:11] good advice. There's such a thing as bad
[29:13] advice. There's such a thing as godly
[29:15] advice. There's such a thing as ungodly
[29:17] advice. There's advice that will push
[29:19] you closer to God. There's advice that
[29:21] will take you away from God. Who is
[29:24] advising you? And here it is. Before God
[29:27] talks about planted by the tree and and
[29:30] and planted by the river of the living
[29:31] waters and all these and and and before
[29:33] he he presents this case of bringing
[29:36] forth your fruit, before he deals with
[29:38] fruit and before he deals with season
[29:40] and before he deals with your leaf not
[29:42] withering, he's saying let me address
[29:44] the issue first of who are the people in
[29:48] your life. I want us to get the flow
[29:51] here of scripture.
[29:53] Blessed is the man that walketh not in
[29:55] the counsel of the ungodly. So he moves
[29:57] from moving from walking to standing
[30:02] because there are people who you make
[30:03] progress. You're walking and walking.
[30:04] Then there's a time you have to stand or
[30:06] you end up in a time when you're
[30:08] standing. You say so you're not walking
[30:09] anymore. You're standing. Who are you
[30:10] standing with again? In that state of
[30:13] standing versus walking in that state of
[30:16] rest or pause or sailor or whatever it
[30:19] is, are you in the way of sinners? Do
[30:21] you take your rest? You want to go by
[30:24] the bar. You want to go here because
[30:25] you're you're you're not in movement,
[30:28] but you're standing. You have stopped.
[30:30] You have taken a pause from action, a
[30:32] pause from activity, but you are
[30:34] standing in the way of sinners. And then
[30:36] he goes now from walk to stand to now
[30:40] sit in the seat of the scornful. Again,
[30:43] in the three states of life's journey,
[30:45] in the three conditions we find
[30:47] ourselves in, you're either these are
[30:49] these are the two natural positions we
[30:50] find ourselves in. You're either moving,
[30:52] you're either standing or you're sitting
[30:54] up. The only thing he has to say here is
[30:55] light up. But it's a picture he is
[30:58] painting that in every state of your
[31:00] life because walking could be who you're
[31:02] working with. You're in movement.
[31:04] Standing is who you pause with or
[31:06] sitting down who you relax with. These
[31:08] are all different states of who are the
[31:11] people in your life.
[31:15] Now we know
[31:18] Adam fell
[31:21] and in God dealing with the issue of
[31:23] Adam falling
[31:25] in Genesis 3 verse 9. And the Lord God
[31:29] called unto Adam and said unto him,
[31:31] where art thou?
[31:34] And he said, "I heard thy voice in the
[31:36] garden and I was afraid because I was
[31:39] naked and I hid myself."
[31:43] And God said, and he said, "Who told
[31:46] thee that thou was naked?"
[31:50] Now, I want us to pause there again
[31:52] because the question God didn't have,
[31:55] the first issue he attacked was not the
[31:57] condition of the man.
[31:59] The question he really ask is who
[32:03] was in your life? In other words, who
[32:06] talked to you?
[32:10] God didn't address his condition first.
[32:12] The first thing God asks is who he was
[32:15] with.
[32:18] Are we seeing that there?
[32:20] I'm raising this point to us because
[32:23] everyone in this room, I believe, want
[32:25] to have success. They want to achieve.
[32:26] They want to make it to heaven. They
[32:28] want to to be able to grow spiritually,
[32:30] grow financially. And we see in both
[32:33] success and failure, there's a
[32:35] significant value to be placed in who is
[32:38] in your life. So God didn't say, "You're
[32:40] wrong. You should have done it." He
[32:42] asked one question. Who told you? Who
[32:44] have you been speaking with?
[32:47] Who has reframed what I instructed you?
[32:52] Anybody with me?
[32:58] In the stillness of Eden, in the
[33:00] perfection of Eden,
[33:03] a voice entered into the environment of
[33:06] Eden through the serpent.
[33:10] Genesis 3:1, familiar scriptures, but
[33:13] foundational because of principles. Now,
[33:16] the serpent was more subtle than any
[33:18] beast of the field which the Lord God
[33:21] had made. And he said unto the woman
[33:24] again, here in there in lies a
[33:27] conversation. Therein lies an
[33:29] opportunity because Eve could say,
[33:31] "Don't talk to me."
[33:36] young people, adults, when people do
[33:39] things more often than not, you know, I
[33:42] hear somebody say this or somebody tell
[33:44] me I should do this or my friend is do
[33:46] it this way or we was just having a
[33:48] conversation in the lunchroom or I went
[33:50] to a family meeting.
[33:52] You know what's right in in many cases,
[33:54] but you hear somebody get away with
[33:56] this.
[33:59] He said unto the woman, "Yeah, had God
[34:01] said, you shall not eat of every tree of
[34:03] the garden." And the woman said unto the
[34:04] servant, "We may eat of the fruit of the
[34:07] trees of the garden, but of the fruit of
[34:09] the tree which is in the midst of the
[34:10] garden." God had said, "Ye shall not eat
[34:12] it, neither shall ye touch it, lest he
[34:14] die." And the serpent said unto the
[34:16] woman, "Ye shall not surely die." Again,
[34:21] for God doth know that in the day you
[34:24] eat thereof, then your eyes shall be
[34:25] opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing
[34:27] good and evil." And when the woman saw
[34:29] that the tree was good for food,
[34:33] and it was pleasant to the eyes, and a
[34:36] tree to be desired to make one wise, she
[34:38] took of the fruit thereof, and did eat,
[34:40] and gave also unto her husband with her,
[34:43] and he did eat. Now, I want to make the
[34:44] point very clear here. The only reason
[34:46] her eyes were open was because of the
[34:49] conversation.
[34:52] The serpent didn't deny God exists. He
[34:55] asked, "What did God say?" So we know
[34:56] the devil is not an atheist. You say,
[34:59] "What did God say?" He wasn't denying
[35:02] God exists. He wasn't denying God spoke.
[35:06] What he was trying to do was change
[35:10] the influence of God on her life.
[35:15] And it is very easy for you to allow a
[35:18] c-orker, a family member, a neighbor, a
[35:21] friend or an enemy to have an influence
[35:23] over you to make you act or do something
[35:26] you're not supposed to do. And I'm
[35:28] coming back to who are the people in
[35:32] your life.
[35:35] The fall of man began because of a
[35:37] conversation.
[35:39] I'll say that again. We're talking about
[35:42] cause and effect. If Eve hadn't had that
[35:45] conversation and allowed for that brief
[35:48] moment, that encounter,
[35:51] that situation would not have taken
[35:53] place. So, we have established God wants
[35:56] us to have fellowship. He wants us to
[35:58] have communion. He wants us to have
[36:00] relations. But it must be in the right
[36:01] way, in the right order, for the right
[36:03] reason, in the right context.
[36:06] The Bible will tell us in Ecclesiastes 4
[36:09] and verse 9, "Two are better than one
[36:13] because they have a good reward for
[36:15] their labor. For if they fall, the one
[36:19] will lift up his fellow. But woe to him
[36:22] that is alone when he fall, for he hath
[36:26] not another to help him up." I want to
[36:29] read that one more time. Two are better
[36:31] than one because they have a good reward
[36:34] for their labor.
[36:36] For if they fall, the one will lift up
[36:39] his fellow. But woe to him. It's a
[36:42] warning to him that is alone when he
[36:45] fall. For he hath not another to help
[36:48] him up. Who do you have in your life who
[36:52] could help you up?
[36:56] Because the scripture is saying, "Woe to
[36:58] him who is alone when he falls." Because
[37:01] falling is a part of life. Needing
[37:03] support is a part of life. If you don't
[37:06] invest
[37:08] in real relationships to help you get
[37:11] closer to God, when you get in trouble,
[37:14] you have no one to lean on. And if the
[37:16] bulk of your conversations as a believer
[37:19] is with unbelievers around subjects and
[37:22] topics that are not edifying you, you
[37:24] have nowhere to go spiritually. The same
[37:26] is true in the natural. If you spend
[37:28] your time with depressed people every
[37:30] day, if we say that's so depressed, this
[37:32] is wrong. Life is you will leave that
[37:34] every day in you will get more and more
[37:36] depressed in them. If the people around
[37:39] you saying you know you can't make it
[37:41] and you can never be successful. That's
[37:43] a very the context. It takes a lot to
[37:46] break out of that. But if you are
[37:47] surrounded by people who say, you know
[37:49] what, there's nothing you cannot
[37:50] achieve. There is nothing that is is
[37:53] impossible for you. Don't look at
[37:56] anything else. Don't get distracted by
[37:58] your environment, your context. And
[38:00] there are many examples. There's a in
[38:03] the business world. There was a young
[38:04] man who started selling insurance around
[38:06] November, December,
[38:08] and he beat the numbers, beat the
[38:11] records. All the other agent want to
[38:12] know what was happening because normally
[38:14] in their mind December is the period
[38:16] when people don't buy but this young man
[38:20] never got the opportunity to get
[38:21] attached to the old fingers in the
[38:23] company. So nobody told him December is
[38:26] a hard month. So he didn't know it was a
[38:28] hard month. So he sold as if it was
[38:31] nothing was wrong. And because he had no
[38:35] kind of association towards that
[38:37] negative type of conversation because
[38:40] most of us we are the average of they
[38:42] say the five people around us.
[38:46] When you look at somebody and look at
[38:48] who around them most time you have no
[38:51] savings check the people around you and
[38:52] see if they have any say savings in the
[38:54] bank account. You have a healthy mindset
[38:57] around life. Check who around you. Look
[39:00] at seeing the connection. This is why
[39:03] even on a national level when you fly
[39:06] there are reason communities are
[39:07] structured the way they are. It's a
[39:10] global thing. It's not it's not a
[39:11] Trinidad thing. It's not a a US thing.
[39:12] It's a global thing. Birds of a feather
[39:15] flock together. People associate with
[39:17] what they like. So a negative based
[39:19] person they have negative friends. We
[39:21] call it a pity party. You walk in that
[39:23] room you see negativity if you know what
[39:26] good for your head straight out. But
[39:27] many of us we want to get gossipers.
[39:30] Gossipers don't spend time with people
[39:31] who do gossip because you can't be a
[39:32] gossiper. A gossiper and a non-gossiper
[39:35] can't get along.
[39:37] If you are a gossiper and you really
[39:40] meet a non-gsipper that something will
[39:43] have to give because the two can't
[39:45] agree. You want to talk about this one
[39:47] and that one and this one is the
[39:49] non-gsipper is focused on achievement
[39:50] and objective and progress and success.
[39:52] They are not time to talk about people
[39:54] and and that kind of they're not in that
[39:56] mindset.
[39:58] So if you want to change your life
[40:01] story, your life destiny, one of the
[40:04] first places to start to address the
[40:06] issues around your life is who are you
[40:08] spending time with? And the issue for
[40:11] many of us is we need to eject some
[40:14] people from our lives and we need to
[40:16] introduce the right people in our lives.
[40:18] I have seen young people on fire for
[40:20] God. And when you see them decline, you
[40:23] could trace it back to a friend in work,
[40:25] a family member, somebody who has a
[40:27] different objective. And well, the
[40:28] friends doing this, you know, the
[40:29] cousins who this or I can see someone
[40:32] who has been struggling get into the
[40:34] right company and their life story
[40:37] changes because they meet the right
[40:39] people. That principle applies in the
[40:42] natural as much as it applies in the
[40:45] spiritual. I trust it is helping
[40:48] somebody tonight.
[40:52] Every purpose, the Bible says in the
[40:54] book of Proverbs, not some purposes.
[40:57] Every purpose
[40:59] is established by counsel. That's
[41:03] Proverbs 20:18.
[41:05] So, every purpose is established by
[41:08] counsel. Even in Genesis, God said, "Let
[41:11] us make man."
[41:13] Every purpose is established by counsel.
[41:16] Who are your adviserss?
[41:22] Someone having trouble in their marriage
[41:24] and some single person who don't know
[41:26] nothing giving them advice. That that
[41:28] making sense.
[41:31] Who are your adviserss?
[41:35] Because if purpose is established by
[41:39] council,
[41:40] it means our influences may have more
[41:43] impact on us than we realize. I could
[41:46] scream and shout tonight for the next
[41:49] hour
[41:50] and you could choose what you listen to,
[41:53] who you talk to and literally break the
[41:56] impact because what we are saying
[41:57] tonight is to things to set you free.
[42:00] Free from yourself for you to realize
[42:02] that you are really a spiritual being.
[42:04] You're not natural. God didn't come to
[42:06] make natural. God is a spirit. God is
[42:08] spiritual. He's calling us to heavenly
[42:11] places. He's calling us a life that's
[42:13] above sin. He's calling us to a life of
[42:15] holiness. He's calling us back to Eden.
[42:18] He's calling us to redemption and to
[42:20] perfection and to putting your foot on
[42:22] top the devil and not yielding to
[42:24] temptation. He said, "Bring your body
[42:26] under subjection, make your body obey
[42:28] your confession, all this is scripture
[42:30] in the Bible. If you spend your time
[42:33] with people who think like that, speak
[42:36] like this, all that God bel all
[42:38] everything on this earth belongs to God.
[42:40] I can do all things through Christ who
[42:43] strengthens me. When you begin to think
[42:45] and speak like that and you surround
[42:48] yourself with people like that, how do
[42:49] you end up in the state of negativity
[42:51] and depression and I can't make it and I
[42:54] don't know how I going and I go
[42:55] backslide and I'm a failure.
[42:57] Failing is a part of life. It's not
[42:59] about if you fall is getting back up.
[43:02] The Bible say a righteous man fall but
[43:04] he get back up. So if you are surrounded
[43:07] by that kind of conversation, that type
[43:10] of dialogue, that type of environment,
[43:12] then it's very difficult for you to end
[43:14] up into problems. Can the church say
[43:16] amen?
[43:18] Every purpose is established by counsel.
[43:22] Even tonight we having counsel because
[43:24] tonight you are being presented that you
[43:27] are more than meets the eye, that you
[43:29] are stronger than you even imagine, that
[43:31] there's more in you. Because the Bible
[43:33] said, "Greater is he that's in you than
[43:35] he that's in the world."
[43:37] That you could only come here tonight
[43:39] because something pulled you. Yes,
[43:41] someone may have invited you, but
[43:43] something have to pull you for you to
[43:45] respond in 2025. People don't want to
[43:48] hear about God.
[43:49] The Bible said there'll be level of
[43:51] pleasures. There'll be truth breakers.
[43:54] There will the the way the Bible
[43:56] describes this last day people. You see
[43:58] it in the news.
[44:00] the crime, the sin, the disrespect, the
[44:03] approach is not a national thing. It's a
[44:06] spirit of the world. This is what the
[44:08] end time spirit, end time condition
[44:11] produces. It takes God himself to be
[44:14] able to arrest someone out of that. And
[44:16] especially for young people to be able
[44:18] to say, you know what, I want to go to
[44:20] heaven. And heaven is not a catchphrase
[44:23] because I want to go, I will go. But the
[44:25] Bible defines what that must look like
[44:27] in the word. But again, this is impacted
[44:31] by who is in your life. Because
[44:35] ultimately, I want to make the point
[44:36] very clear. God is measuring us by our
[44:39] choices. You had a choice to be here
[44:41] tonight. You have a choice to come to
[44:43] church. You have a choice to work with
[44:46] your family, to love your children, to
[44:48] take a job, to improve yourself, to go
[44:50] to that's all these are choices.
[44:53] But all of our choices are influenced.
[44:57] So another way to describe this study
[44:59] tonight is really about influence. What
[45:01] is influencing you? If somebody say well
[45:04] I lost my joy about coming to the Lord
[45:07] then what is the influence that took
[45:09] that away? Because that could only
[45:10] happen because of another influence
[45:12] because if you are in the right
[45:14] environment having the right
[45:15] conversation doing the right things it
[45:17] is impossible for you to just fall away.
[45:20] What is influencing you to not pray?
[45:22] What is influencing you to not read your
[45:24] Bible? What is influencing you to not
[45:26] forgive? Even forgiveness but I can't
[45:30] forgive that man and somebody say n
[45:32] slide you know just that one statement
[45:35] you can't let that slide know and you
[45:37] holding an alt and a grudge because
[45:38] somebody tell you let slide a year two
[45:41] three years you still vex over something
[45:42] that you could have dropped a long time
[45:44] ago because somebody say you don't think
[45:45] them things so you know and you know you
[45:47] know trick chain up
[45:50] so don't don't let us slide and you in
[45:53] that mindset and your blessing is being
[45:55] hindered because of Who
[45:58] is in your life? Again, every purpose is
[46:02] established by counsel and with good
[46:04] advice
[46:06] make war.
[46:11] Righteous counsel will always align with
[46:14] God's word.
[46:16] So if you have someone in your life and
[46:18] the advice they're giving you, in the
[46:21] old days I would say this is for the
[46:22] young people, but this is for everybody.
[46:25] If you can't check what somebody's
[46:27] saying you, because every answer you
[46:30] need to every single problem is in the
[46:32] Bible. I'll say this again. Every answer
[46:36] to any problem you could ever meet,
[46:38] past, present, future, is in the
[46:40] scriptures.
[46:42] And if somebody's giving you advice that
[46:44] doesn't align with scripture, check the
[46:47] source of this thing.
[46:49] Because godly advice will always, not
[46:52] sometimes, always align with God's word.
[46:57] Corrupt counsel does find a way to
[46:59] compromise with it. Don't have to do it.
[47:00] So, you don't really need to do it that
[47:02] way. You could really compromise here.
[47:04] Righteous counsel brings clarity. God is
[47:07] holy. God is righteous.
[47:11] There's no compromise with God. He said,
[47:12] "I rather you're hot or you're cold." If
[47:15] you want to serve God, serve God. It
[47:17] can't be. Well, God is not operating a
[47:19] buffet. Well, you know, I I I just eat
[47:22] this, I don't eat this, I want this, I
[47:23] don't really like this, this is that's
[47:25] not how God operates. God hasn't given
[47:27] us, well, choose from me what you want.
[47:30] No, it's either you want God or you want
[47:32] the world. There's no three options
[47:34] here. So, righteous counsel will align
[47:37] with God's word. It will bring clarity
[47:39] to you. It will strengthen your
[47:41] conviction. If at the end of this
[47:44] meeting you cannot say to yourself, you
[47:46] know what, I've not been operating as I
[47:48] should and I want to do better. There
[47:50] are four numbers in my phone I need to
[47:52] delete. There are some people I need to
[47:54] stop talking to. Recently a brother said
[47:56] to me, he told his friends, "Listen, we
[47:58] need to end this thing because the
[48:00] advice you giving me not bringing me
[48:01] where I need to go."
[48:05] Can the church say amen? Righteous
[48:08] counsel will protect your purpose.
[48:10] You have to know you are born for a
[48:12] purpose. You have to know there's a
[48:14] reason for your life. You have to know
[48:16] that God put you here to achieve certain
[48:18] things. In the natural, in the
[48:20] spiritual, you are a reflection of God.
[48:23] There are people who may not be in this
[48:25] meeting tonight, but when they see you,
[48:27] they are inspired to understand why are
[48:29] you positive when things are the way
[48:31] they are. Why are you still happy and
[48:34] hopeful and excited with the way things
[48:37] are today?
[48:39] Can we build a little bit? I'm not going
[48:42] to be too long with you, but I want you
[48:44] at the end of this session to really ask
[48:47] yourself, who are the people in my life?
[48:52] Who are the people I want to keep? So,
[48:53] you're having you're leaving this
[48:54] meeting tonight with homework? Who are
[48:57] the people I could afford to keep? And
[48:58] for some of us, we need to let real
[49:00] people go.
[49:02] And what are the kind of people I want
[49:03] to meet? This underscores why church and
[49:08] fellowship is important. Now don't get
[49:10] me wrong in every church has three kind
[49:11] of believers. But the reality is for
[49:14] even maturity and for growth to take
[49:16] place. You can only truly grow when
[49:18] you're challenged by people around you.
[49:21] And there are people who may pass
[49:23] through your life for a season to show
[49:25] you how not to behave.
[49:29] So sometimes somebody have a season that
[49:31] show you that is not how I want to be.
[49:33] You see that kind of husband, that kind
[49:35] of father, that kind of businessman,
[49:37] that kind of leader, that kind of
[49:39] whatever it is, that is not what I want
[49:41] to be. And they will be there for a
[49:44] season to give you a lesson, to give you
[49:46] insight into what you don't want to be.
[49:48] And there are people in your life who
[49:50] are there to show you exactly what you
[49:51] want to be, how you want to look, what
[49:54] you want to achieve.
[49:57] Abraham and Lot, very familiar,
[50:00] foundational characters in scripture.
[50:02] Lot would have zero relevance in
[50:05] scripture had it not been for Abraham.
[50:08] The only reason we know Lot exists is
[50:12] because of Abraham.
[50:16] God never spoke to Lot. He called
[50:19] Abraham.
[50:21] It was because Abraham was in Lot's
[50:23] life. Lot had a financial blessing just
[50:26] based on proximity. I want us to
[50:29] appreciate that.
[50:31] So you could have somebody in your life
[50:32] and you are blessed because of that
[50:36] person in your life and you could look
[50:37] at it from two perspectives. Do you have
[50:40] people that are connected to you that is
[50:42] leading to you being blessed? And on the
[50:44] other side are you even a blessing to
[50:47] anybody? Could anybody say that you know
[50:49] what having you as a as someone in my
[50:51] life has been a blessing to me? There
[50:53] are people who live life having zero
[50:55] impact.
[50:58] Lord help us to have an impact.
[51:00] Because Jesus called disciples say go
[51:03] into the world and preach the gospel and
[51:04] change the world. And from 12 disciples
[51:07] you have millions and millions of people
[51:09] who have heard about Jesus. So the
[51:10] impact took place. What is your impact?
[51:13] Have you impacted anyone's life
[51:15] positively or when people see you they
[51:17] say boy I really trying to be with you?
[51:19] I really not really trying to hang out
[51:21] with you today.
[51:27] Lot's entire relevance in scripture
[51:30] existed because Abraham was in his life
[51:36] in so much that the blessings from
[51:38] Abraham pour into Lot so much that Lot's
[51:41] whole business grew. The conflict
[51:43] between Abraham and Lot's men because it
[51:46] wasn't Abraham and Lot in conflict was
[51:48] because of the blessing of the Lord was
[51:50] so much upon Abraham that Lot's
[51:52] blessings was so much that their
[51:54] businesses grew and their cles grew and
[51:57] there was conflict that took place.
[52:00] But you would notice friends the moment
[52:02] that Lot because Abraham being the
[52:05] spiritual one the mature one say Lot
[52:07] here's what it's not right for us to
[52:09] have this kind of conflict. You choose
[52:11] your journey wherever you go. I don't
[52:14] have a problem with it. And the Bible
[52:17] say Lot look around, look around, look
[52:18] around. And he pitch his 10 towards
[52:20] Sodom.
[52:22] You would notice that during the period
[52:24] that Lot was with Abraham, God was
[52:26] really talking to Abraham like that's
[52:27] enough because as much as Lot was being
[52:30] blessed because Abraham was in his life,
[52:33] Lot was also almost a weight on Abraham.
[52:37] Are we together?
[52:39] The moment Lot separated himself, God
[52:43] started to talk to Abraham again. Say,
[52:44] Abraham, come now that you're alone.
[52:49] Because during this thing called life,
[52:51] there are people who have to join your
[52:52] life. There people have to leave your
[52:54] life. There are stages and journeys
[52:57] and you have to know again to answer the
[53:00] question, who are the people in your
[53:03] life? And when Lot would have left, then
[53:05] God could say, "Abraham, look to the
[53:06] left. Look to the right, look to the
[53:07] north, look to the south. Everything
[53:09] your eye could see is yours." I couldn't
[53:12] tell you this before because there were
[53:13] people in your life who didn't want to
[53:16] hear this thing. Does that make sense to
[53:18] us?
[53:22] And this builds,
[53:26] let's jump to Moses. I'm just pointing
[53:29] out different characters in scripture to
[53:32] show the impact. the influence.
[53:35] I would just throw in a quick point. We
[53:37] talked about we did a Bible study some
[53:40] time ago about Morai
[53:42] that we say Queen Esther would have
[53:45] never risen to the position she did if
[53:47] Morai was not there
[53:49] because it was Modi's advice, Morai's
[53:52] counsel. It was Morai told her how to
[53:55] operate. It was Morai say how to speak,
[53:57] how to dress. It was Mori. He was her
[54:00] men. His amentor.
[54:03] Esther couldn't sit down and say, "Well,
[54:04] I reach here by myself." You know,
[54:08] and this is one of the reasons it is
[54:10] such a powerful lesson in of itself
[54:12] because many of us, we get so proud with
[54:14] our achievement and we forget that there
[54:16] are people along the journey that God
[54:18] place in our lives that help us see
[54:19] certain things, help us achieve certain
[54:21] things, help push us in a certain kind
[54:23] of a way that you cannot take credit for
[54:26] everything yourself. More importantly,
[54:28] you have to be able to acknowledge that
[54:30] without God, they cannot do it. And God
[54:32] allow people to come into your life. But
[54:35] now we are trying to reframe as we come
[54:37] to the end of this year because
[54:38] typically when they come into the end of
[54:40] a year, people do a lot of reflection.
[54:42] When you look back at just this this
[54:44] year alone, forget the last year, just
[54:45] this year alone.
[54:48] How have you progressed in 2025?
[54:52] Did you progress as much as you wanted
[54:54] to? Because with God, God don't speak
[54:56] about subtraction and division and
[54:59] breaking down. God speaks about
[55:00] expanding your borders, expanding your
[55:02] territory, achieving more, being able
[55:05] through the grace of God and the
[55:07] strength of God. This is not prosperity
[55:09] doctrine. This is you understanding that
[55:11] you have to make progress. He say add to
[55:14] your faith virtue and to virtue
[55:15] knowledge and the knowledge temper. In
[55:16] other words, you should be making
[55:17] progress. You should have saved more
[55:20] this year than last year.
[55:24] You should have achieved more in your
[55:25] health. You should have achieved more
[55:26] with the right type of relationships
[55:30] because it's principles that you're
[55:32] tapping into.
[55:34] And if no one is telling you that you
[55:37] could achieve more, you could do better.
[55:39] Yes, you could be a better husband. If
[55:41] you're not around people who telling you
[55:42] you could be a better husband, yes, you
[55:44] could be faithful in your marriage.
[55:46] There are people in rooms. Those
[55:48] conversations do not take place. We
[55:50] cannot underestimate these things. Now,
[55:53] there was a time 50 years ago, 100 years
[55:55] ago, that was normal. But look at the
[55:56] world today in 2025.
[55:59] Is there anyone in your life telling you
[56:02] that being a Christian is achievable?
[56:06] That there is a reality to this thing,
[56:08] that the Holy Ghost is real, that the
[56:10] promise of God is real, that living and
[56:12] God being able to visit you, commune
[56:14] with you, that you could have a home
[56:15] that is a altar.
[56:18] Are there people in your life who say
[56:20] you should have a family altar?
[56:24] Or are people in your life telling you
[56:25] that it's longtime thing?
[56:28] Because if you don't have people in your
[56:30] life pushing you for spiritual maturity
[56:32] and growth, then who are the people in
[56:34] your life?
[56:38] And we could flip this thing down to who
[56:40] are you testifying to? Who are you
[56:43] encouraging? Who are you saying that
[56:45] yes, you could be a real man? You could
[56:46] be a real woman of God. Being male
[56:49] doesn't make you a man. Being female
[56:51] doesn't make you a woman
[56:54] because you have all kind of people
[56:55] around there having children and no
[56:57] context. Abandoned home. All kind of
[56:59] foolishness. That's the world we live in
[57:00] now. But the standard of the Bible
[57:03] hasn't changed because God said, "I'm
[57:04] the Lord and I change not." This is to
[57:06] encourage us to really check where am I
[57:09] getting my advice from? Who am I
[57:12] listening to? And more importantly,
[57:15] beginning to be conscious of the
[57:17] environments you place yourself in, the
[57:20] homes that you visit, the conversations
[57:22] that you have, whether is in the
[57:24] lunchroom, whether it's in your car,
[57:26] whether it was whatever it is to be very
[57:28] cautious there.
[57:30] Again, we're talking about people in
[57:32] your life. Moses,
[57:36] Exodus 17
[57:39] from verse 8. Exodus 17 and verse 8.
[57:43] Then came Amalecch. We have spoken about
[57:44] Amalecch many times. The Amalachites,
[57:46] right? Then came Amalecch. This is the
[57:49] descendants of Esau, right? All the way
[57:51] down, right? And fought with Israel and
[57:53] Refford. And Moses said unto Joshua,
[57:57] "Choose out men and go out, fight with
[58:01] Amalecch. Tomorrow I will stand on top
[58:04] of the hill with the rod of God in my
[58:06] hand."
[58:07] So Joshua did as Moses had said to him
[58:11] and fought with Amalecch.
[58:13] And Moses, Aaron, and her went up to the
[58:17] top of the hill. And it came to pass
[58:20] when Moses held up his hand that Israel
[58:24] prevailed.
[58:26] And when he let down his hand, Amalecch
[58:29] prevailed.
[58:30] But Moses' hand were heavy. And they
[58:33] took a stone and put it under him, and
[58:37] he sat there on. And Aaron and her
[58:40] stayed up his hands, the one on the one
[58:43] side, and the other on the other side,
[58:46] and his hands were steady until the
[58:48] going down of the sun. And Joshua
[58:52] discomforted Amalecch and his people
[58:54] with the edge of the sword. In other
[58:56] words, Joshua route the enemy, destroy
[58:58] the enemy.
[59:00] The picture I want to paint here is
[59:04] Moses is unique in scripture.
[59:07] We have Moses in the Old Testament. We
[59:10] have Moses on Mount Transfiguration.
[59:12] We'll have Moses again to the Jews in
[59:13] scripture. Moses is a critical piece of
[59:16] the puzzle of God. Moses is a strong
[59:19] man, spiritually strong, called for a
[59:22] purpose. But in this moment, we see
[59:24] Moses tired. We see Moses weak.
[59:29] Leaders get tired.
[59:31] Leaders go through weakness. And leaders
[59:34] need the right people in their lives.
[59:40] Sometime as a father, and I say this to
[59:41] young people many times, you look at
[59:43] your father, you look at your mother,
[59:44] you look at the people who you they may
[59:46] not show you when they're going through
[59:48] stuff.
[59:51] Many could tell you of they would not
[59:53] never know that their father or their
[59:54] mother or their grandfather was going
[59:56] through that because the more mature you
[59:58] get, the older they get, you learn how
[1:00:00] to master certain things. But don't
[1:00:02] underestimate the stress, the pain, the
[1:00:04] struggle that leaders have to go
[1:00:07] through.
[1:00:09] And Moses was at a point in his life
[1:00:13] that when his hands were up, the victory
[1:00:15] belonged to Israel. In other words, the
[1:00:17] real war wasn't the war in the valley.
[1:00:22] The real war was the war on the
[1:00:23] mountain.
[1:00:25] The real war was the leader being able
[1:00:28] to stay in leadership and be effective
[1:00:30] at the calling. And had it not been for
[1:00:34] Aaron and her literally holding up his
[1:00:37] hands,
[1:00:39] the battle would have been lost. The
[1:00:40] battle was very clear. When his hands
[1:00:41] fell, the war was being lost. When his
[1:00:44] hands was up, the war was being won.
[1:00:47] This applies in so many different
[1:00:49] contexts because you could apply it to
[1:00:52] leadership, church leadership, company
[1:00:54] leadership. Have you created enough
[1:00:57] value that you could actually help the
[1:00:59] leader take things further?
[1:01:02] Because life, success, homes,
[1:01:06] governments, countries, companies rise
[1:01:08] and fall on leadership. Here it was. If
[1:01:11] Moses wasn't even honest enough to say,
[1:01:13] "Well, brothers, it look like I need
[1:01:15] help you now." Or the men themselves
[1:01:18] wouldn't say, "Here's it. Moses, hear
[1:01:20] us. We need to help you."
[1:01:24] What if Moses say, "Brothers, just leave
[1:01:25] me alone."
[1:01:29] These brothers
[1:01:32] were key to success for Israel because
[1:01:35] Moses had to be part of the picture, but
[1:01:37] Aaron and her had to help his hands up.
[1:01:41] Who are the people in your life? Another
[1:01:45] example with Moses, one of the greatest
[1:01:47] leaders, and I want us to contextualize
[1:01:49] this. Moses led 2 million people
[1:01:54] out of Egypt
[1:01:58] in a day when he had no cars, no buses,
[1:02:01] no trucks. You know what the logistical
[1:02:03] process to lead a thousand people or
[1:02:05] even 100 people? There are people with
[1:02:07] two cars following them and they get
[1:02:08] lost. Two cars way by traffic light. No,
[1:02:11] don't turn. I see on the indicator are
[1:02:14] calling you out because the fourth car
[1:02:16] get lost. Five cars on the highway is a
[1:02:18] problem. You don't need to move two
[1:02:19] million people. Food, logistics,
[1:02:22] everybody see where so and so is. You're
[1:02:24] not in this group. You're not in that
[1:02:25] group. Here's a great leader. And when
[1:02:27] we come to Exodus 18 verse 13, again,
[1:02:32] we're talking about who are the people
[1:02:33] in your life. And I'm hoping in some
[1:02:36] small way the words tonight would be an
[1:02:39] impact to you to not only look at the
[1:02:42] people in your life, but for you to look
[1:02:43] at others around you because we need
[1:02:45] each other.
[1:02:47] Exodus 18:13. And it came to pass on the
[1:02:51] tomorrow that Moses sat to judge the
[1:02:54] people. And the people stood by Moses
[1:02:56] from the morning unto the evening. And
[1:03:00] when Moses father-in-law
[1:03:04] saw all that he did to the people, he
[1:03:07] said, "What is this thing that thou
[1:03:09] doest to the people? Why sit thou
[1:03:13] thyself alone,
[1:03:15] and all the people stand by thee from
[1:03:17] morning unto evening? Hearken now unto
[1:03:20] my voice." In other words, listen to me.
[1:03:24] I will give thee counsel,
[1:03:26] and God will be with thee. Be thou for
[1:03:30] the people to God what? And that thou
[1:03:32] mayest bring the causes unto God, and
[1:03:35] thou shalt teach them ordinances, and
[1:03:37] laws. Moreover, thou shalt provide out
[1:03:39] of all the people able men such as fear
[1:03:43] God, men of truth, hate, and
[1:03:45] covetousness, and place such over them.
[1:03:48] So Moses hearkened to the voice of his
[1:03:51] father-in-law, and did all that he had
[1:03:54] said. And effectively what Moses did, he
[1:03:56] appointed leaders over Israel.
[1:03:59] So Moses father-in-law look at say
[1:04:02] listen Moses if you keep this up you'll
[1:04:03] kill you'll kill yourself you cannot
[1:04:05] keep this up
[1:04:08] I have a brother that send me messages
[1:04:10] to encourage me say hey you need to take
[1:04:11] a rest
[1:04:13] if you don't have people who at least
[1:04:16] saying I know you have the right motive
[1:04:19] right objective but if you don't pause
[1:04:22] you will reach nowhere fast enough
[1:04:24] that's good advice that is people who
[1:04:27] care about
[1:04:28] Because you could be zealously foolish
[1:04:30] in it.
[1:04:33] You have a good direction, a good
[1:04:36] motive, but you have to pace yourself.
[1:04:39] Who are the people in your life that
[1:04:41] will give you tell you the truth,
[1:04:44] encourage you, help you, help you. And
[1:04:48] the question you have to ask yourself is
[1:04:50] when you check who your quote unquote
[1:04:52] friends are, are they really helping
[1:04:53] you? Are you in a better position
[1:04:58] having these friends in your life or are
[1:05:01] they giving you temporary comfort and
[1:05:02] when you ready look are you moving
[1:05:04] anywhere you know?
[1:05:06] Anybody with me tonight?
[1:05:09] I'm not going to be too much longer.
[1:05:10] This tonight is more for us to think a
[1:05:13] little bit, reflect a little bit. Who
[1:05:17] are your Aon and her? Who are the people
[1:05:20] in your life that when your hands get
[1:05:21] tired, they could help carry you?
[1:05:26] Who are the people in your life when
[1:05:29] they see you, there is such a thing as
[1:05:31] doing too much. We talk a lot about
[1:05:34] being lazy and not doing enough. But
[1:05:35] there is such thing as doing too much.
[1:05:38] Life is about balance. You could be
[1:05:40] doing too little or you could be doing
[1:05:42] too much. You have to find the balance.
[1:05:43] Who is it to tell you when you're when
[1:05:45] you're not doing enough say you need to
[1:05:46] do more? And who? Hey, listen. You need
[1:05:49] to slow down
[1:05:51] because if you pause and you rest and
[1:05:53] you catch yourself, you'll be more
[1:05:55] effective tomorrow.
[1:05:58] Was he saying you work until midnight
[1:05:59] and you you're messing up all the
[1:06:01] numbers, the whole spreadsheet mashup?
[1:06:05] Anybody with me tonight? So don't think
[1:06:07] for a minute I'm telling you work hard,
[1:06:10] push, push, push. There's a balance. But
[1:06:12] sometimes and this is what is important
[1:06:14] friends if it's anything you get to you
[1:06:16] really sometimes cannot see yourself you
[1:06:18] know
[1:06:22] this is something we have to appreciate
[1:06:24] and you have to have people who you
[1:06:26] could trust
[1:06:28] who will tell you the truth even if the
[1:06:30] truth hurts
[1:06:34] who could tell you the truth even if the
[1:06:36] truth is not comfortable.
[1:06:38] I rather have somebody in my corner, in
[1:06:40] my circle who could tell me the truth.
[1:06:44] Even if it make me feel a certain way, I
[1:06:46] say, "No, you know, you're really right.
[1:06:47] I really should have approach it better.
[1:06:49] I really said it the wrong way. I really
[1:06:51] did the wrong thing."
[1:06:53] Because you have people to
[1:06:56] I want to do a Bible study on David's
[1:06:59] general.
[1:07:01] David's general versus the prophet.
[1:07:05] Nathan the prophet. When David wanted
[1:07:07] Bacha,
[1:07:09] David general is the one who carry the
[1:07:12] man to the front line and leave him to
[1:07:13] die. In other words, you could have
[1:07:15] people in your corner who will just
[1:07:17] listen to where you want. And
[1:07:19] now don't get me wrong, David's general,
[1:07:22] without that general, David would have
[1:07:24] been in real trouble.
[1:07:27] David's general was the one who when he
[1:07:29] saw Saul in the tent say, "Why don't
[1:07:31] kill him now?"
[1:07:33] And David said touch not God's anointed
[1:07:37] with this Bat Sheba situation. Nathan
[1:07:40] the prophet who is who say David you
[1:07:41] know you move wrong. His general never
[1:07:44] tell him to move around. His general was
[1:07:46] the first one say well I go and carry
[1:07:47] this man to the front line.
[1:07:50] They both love David
[1:07:53] but the context of the love and the
[1:07:55] expression the love because that so that
[1:07:56] general for David will fight whatever
[1:07:58] David tell he doing. But Nathan is the
[1:08:02] spiritual one. Nathan is a prophet and
[1:08:04] Nathan saying God not happy with this.
[1:08:08] So within context of life and leadership
[1:08:11] because again this bears into making
[1:08:14] decisions. You want to have the right
[1:08:15] approach to do something. This is why
[1:08:17] when we do a wedding we say it should
[1:08:20] not be ending into unadvisedly. You ever
[1:08:22] hear that line? Anybody ever appear to
[1:08:24] unadvisedly? If you reach out to the
[1:08:26] front of the church there and there was
[1:08:27] no way they advise you
[1:08:31] problems you know because you're not
[1:08:33] supposed to enter unadvisedly but if you
[1:08:35] go to the people with the wrong advice
[1:08:39] and I want to tell you this that that
[1:08:41] that I think you should be but you so
[1:08:42] confused you don't know where you're
[1:08:43] starting where you're ending where
[1:08:44] you're finishing how will the marriage
[1:08:46] last if you don't have the right counsel
[1:08:48] the right advice people who have walked
[1:08:49] the journey even people have made
[1:08:51] mistakes but they get it right because
[1:08:53] you really have to discern who you
[1:08:55] allowed to speak into your life when
[1:08:58] somebody says to you you should do it
[1:09:00] this way or you should do it and then
[1:09:02] you hear people say if I had gotten
[1:09:04] advice like this 20 years ago but life
[1:09:06] we're in a different place
[1:09:10] and then you kind of just take thing
[1:09:11] wholesale because even Paul as a leader
[1:09:15] the apostle Paul says follow me as I
[1:09:17] follow Christ
[1:09:20] and Paul didn't just bring doctrine as
[1:09:22] in spiritual guidance he spoke about
[1:09:24] life he spoke spoke about everything
[1:09:27] so that those who were under his care
[1:09:29] had an understanding.
[1:09:32] I hope this is helping us because the
[1:09:34] word of God comes to bring a complete
[1:09:36] being. The Bible says God has given us
[1:09:39] all things pertaining to both life and
[1:09:41] godliness. How could you profess to be a
[1:09:44] successful Christian in the spiritual
[1:09:46] realm and your natural life can't match
[1:09:48] that?
[1:09:51] You can't convince anybody because your
[1:09:52] work ethic is so terrible.
[1:09:55] It is disappointing when you hear
[1:09:57] somebody say some of the worst employees
[1:09:59] are people who are Christians.
[1:10:02] I have heard that many times. How is
[1:10:04] that a testimony? And the same Christian
[1:10:06] in the workplace is on the front line in
[1:10:08] church worshiping harder than everybody
[1:10:09] else. But their work ethic is terrible.
[1:10:12] When the Bible says when you work, work
[1:10:14] unto the Lord.
[1:10:16] I've said many times you can't say
[1:10:18] you're a Christian and I have problem
[1:10:20] with the man and the man and the job and
[1:10:22] I just do the people work. Christians
[1:10:24] cannot speak like that. That is not the
[1:10:26] Bible.
[1:10:28] The Bible say when you do your work do
[1:10:29] it to the Lord. Promotion don't come
[1:10:32] from the east from the west. Your boss
[1:10:33] could never promote you.
[1:10:37] He might express it but the Bible says
[1:10:39] promotion don't come from the east. It
[1:10:41] comes from the Lord. If God wants to
[1:10:43] promote you, trust me, your promotion is
[1:10:44] booked. It's guaranteed. it'll taking
[1:10:46] place.
[1:10:49] Increase comes from the Lord. Success
[1:10:51] comes from the Lord. He said, "Meditate
[1:10:53] on the word day and night and you'll
[1:10:55] have good success." We try to have
[1:10:57] success in our own strength that God
[1:10:58] give us the principles and formula.
[1:11:00] Meditate on the word day and night and
[1:11:02] you'll have good success. Why? Because
[1:11:04] within the word has the answers on how
[1:11:06] to approach things, how to approach
[1:11:08] people, how to speak,
[1:11:11] a soft answer, turn away wrath. You
[1:11:13] don't need to go to a course to learn
[1:11:14] that in the Bible.
[1:11:17] conflict resolution, all these things.
[1:11:20] But if you spend all your time
[1:11:22] gossiping, all the time on Facebook, all
[1:11:24] the time on Instagram, how you expect to
[1:11:27] grow
[1:11:28] as a believer? I trust this is helping
[1:11:31] somebody tonight.
[1:11:34] So we see different context,
[1:11:37] different example. So Moses tell his
[1:11:40] father-in-law, well, you are the
[1:11:41] father-in-law. You can't tell me
[1:11:42] nothing. This is how I feel led. Moses
[1:11:45] is showing a leader who is willing to
[1:11:47] listen to advice, willing to ask for
[1:11:50] help, willing to lean on help. Are you
[1:11:53] that kind of person tonight?
[1:12:00] I already touched this concept, but I
[1:12:02] want to just touch it again
[1:12:05] as we look to close out again.
[1:12:10] man going to the pool 38 years is a type
[1:12:14] of being very clear he had a desire
[1:12:18] for his life to change. I would like to
[1:12:21] believe if you're here tonight
[1:12:23] by your own choosing or by invitation
[1:12:26] that you're here because you want
[1:12:27] something more, something more than
[1:12:29] yesterday.
[1:12:31] You want a closer walk with God. You
[1:12:33] want to be able to connect
[1:12:37] with something beyond this natural
[1:12:39] realm.
[1:12:41] Friends, we are at the end of time.
[1:12:44] This world is falling apart. Politicians
[1:12:46] will never be able to solve it. The
[1:12:48] Bible tells us that the world is
[1:12:50] destined for judgment. The Bible tells
[1:12:52] us that the only hope is the Lord Jesus
[1:12:55] Christ. The Bible tells us that we are
[1:12:57] however challenged to live until he
[1:12:59] comes. We are challenged to be able to
[1:13:03] abide in the context of the world to be
[1:13:06] in the world but not of the world until
[1:13:08] he comes. We are challenged to flee from
[1:13:12] all sign of sin not put ourselves in the
[1:13:15] environment of it. So when sinners
[1:13:17] entice you the Bible say to go and do
[1:13:19] things you need to be able to say no I'm
[1:13:20] not this is not who I am that's not my
[1:13:23] identity. The Bible said Moses refused
[1:13:25] to be called the son of Pharaoh's
[1:13:27] daughter. That's a choice that he made.
[1:13:29] He grew up in that home. It was his
[1:13:31] background. It was his environment. But
[1:13:35] the moment he got a realization of who
[1:13:37] he was, he started to make certain
[1:13:38] choices. And he refused to be called by
[1:13:41] that name.
[1:13:43] I don't know what name you have been
[1:13:44] called by. I don't know what background
[1:13:46] you have, what neighborhood you grew up
[1:13:47] in, what village you, but the way God
[1:13:50] sees things, your past has nothing to do
[1:13:52] with your future.
[1:13:54] In the truest sense of it, the way God
[1:13:57] sees you is a picture he has of you that
[1:13:59] is very different from your reality.
[1:14:02] The devil's job is to keep you in a
[1:14:04] state of your reality.
[1:14:07] And the job of the word of God and God's
[1:14:10] objective is to pull you out of your
[1:14:11] reality. If your reality now is sickness
[1:14:14] and you think that sickness is my family
[1:14:16] had this thing and and this is what I
[1:14:18] have now and that is a natural reality
[1:14:21] and the devil will pull everything out
[1:14:23] including the doctor to say that is
[1:14:24] yours. And I'm saying tonight by the
[1:14:27] power of God sickness doesn't belong to
[1:14:28] you. I don't care how long you've had
[1:14:30] it. I don't care what the doctors say.
[1:14:32] God is a healer.
[1:14:34] He is he is the same yesterday, today
[1:14:36] and forever. And even in this Bible said
[1:14:38] you could be completely healed from the
[1:14:40] crown of head to the soles of your feet.
[1:14:41] He is a way maker. He is a deliverer.
[1:14:44] And some of you have heard it before.
[1:14:46] Some of you hear it in letter. You hear
[1:14:48] it in word, but it never register
[1:14:50] because you still walk around as if God
[1:14:52] is not going to do it for you.
[1:14:55] You have to believe that your miracle is
[1:14:58] coming. On Wednesday night service, we
[1:15:00] read the quote about miracle.
[1:15:02] God is a miracle working God. And you
[1:15:06] have to know that your situation could
[1:15:08] change. Your environment could change.
[1:15:11] Your condition could change. And we
[1:15:14] could switch that word could to must
[1:15:16] change. Not just will change. It must
[1:15:18] change because something has to happen
[1:15:21] in your life that you see and you
[1:15:23] understand and you believe that this is
[1:15:26] a God of the impossible. So this man as
[1:15:29] we preparing to close out for 38 years
[1:15:32] that's that speaks of endurance.
[1:15:35] It speaks of staying and and and and and
[1:15:38] and being committed to the cause.
[1:15:42] But I want to challenge us.
[1:15:45] Are you investing in relationships with
[1:15:48] the right people?
[1:15:51] And are you strong enough to have an
[1:15:53] impact on people? Can you walk into a
[1:15:55] room and say, "No, I don't drink. I
[1:15:57] don't smoke. I don't party."
[1:15:59] But if you want to hear about what God
[1:16:02] could help you to see, I'll be happy to
[1:16:03] share about that.
[1:16:07] Do you have the strength to be able to
[1:16:08] have that impact on someone? And I talk
[1:16:10] about being self-righteous. I'm not
[1:16:11] talking about everybody being a pastor.
[1:16:13] But you have to be able to understand
[1:16:15] the source of your supply, the source of
[1:16:17] your strength. If you a Christian, be a
[1:16:19] Christian. Be a proud not pride, but be
[1:16:22] proud
[1:16:24] to stand up for what you believe. Don't
[1:16:27] hide it. The Bible says, "And my people
[1:16:29] shall never be ashamed."
[1:16:32] And in this world we live in now, people
[1:16:33] believe all kind of foolishness.
[1:16:36] People stand up for all kind of causes.
[1:16:38] Causes when they find out what the cause
[1:16:39] really is, they realize the cause never
[1:16:40] even made sense in the first place.
[1:16:45] So if you know this is the truth, then
[1:16:47] how much effort are you putting it?
[1:16:49] Because again I want to make the point
[1:16:51] that if you stand for something the
[1:16:53] people who are connected will stand with
[1:16:56] it as well, you know. But if you have
[1:16:57] nothing to stand on then then what will
[1:16:59] people associate you with? People
[1:17:01] shouldn't wonder if you're a Christian.
[1:17:04] People shouldn't have to wonder.
[1:17:06] Somebody shouldn't be surprised when
[1:17:08] they see you in the Bible study.
[1:17:09] Somebody shouldn't surprise when you see
[1:17:10] that. You just go to church.
[1:17:13] I say if your neighbors car give a
[1:17:15] testimony about you, you need to check
[1:17:17] yourself
[1:17:19] because everywhere Jesus went, you know
[1:17:22] Jesus.
[1:17:24] This is not to rebuke. This is to
[1:17:25] encourage us tonight
[1:17:28] because not only are we to be influenced
[1:17:32] by the right influences, but we all have
[1:17:34] to be an influence. The great commission
[1:17:37] is to go into the world and preach the
[1:17:39] gospel. That's the great commission.
[1:17:40] That's Jesus instructions. Go into the
[1:17:43] world from Jerusalem unto Judea, unto
[1:17:46] Samaria to the uttermost parts of the
[1:17:47] world. And the promises unto you, unto
[1:17:49] your children and them are far off. All
[1:17:52] believers supposed to be telling people
[1:17:54] about the Lord Jesus Christ. It's the
[1:17:55] great commission given from the Lord
[1:17:57] Jesus Christ himself. This is not from a
[1:17:59] pastor or apostle or teacher or prophet.
[1:18:00] The Lord himself. This commission has
[1:18:02] never been cancelled.
[1:18:07] But for you to have an impact on others,
[1:18:09] you must have a testimony.
[1:18:11] People must know you're trying. You have
[1:18:13] an effort. You're making progress. The
[1:18:15] things you used to do in the past, you
[1:18:16] don't do them no more because your
[1:18:17] nature is being changed. You're making
[1:18:19] because now that brings people into a
[1:18:21] rhythm that you're pushing your you're
[1:18:23] looking to achieve something.
[1:18:26] We dialing on this man here 38 years.
[1:18:29] The Bible in that context speaks of
[1:18:32] there were people and and we could just
[1:18:34] read it and we could kind of close out
[1:18:35] with this and and and and that aspect
[1:18:38] there in John 5 from verse one.
[1:18:42] After this there was a feast of the Jews
[1:18:44] and Jesus went up to Jerusalems. This
[1:18:46] book of St. John 5 and verse one. Now
[1:18:49] there is at Jerusalem by the sheep
[1:18:51] market a pool which is called in the
[1:18:53] Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five
[1:18:55] porches and these lay a great multitude
[1:18:59] of impotent folk and the Bible is now
[1:19:02] describing the nature of these
[1:19:04] situations of blind halt withered
[1:19:08] waiting for the moving of the water. So
[1:19:10] the picture here is like a hospital.
[1:19:13] There are people with different
[1:19:14] conditions,
[1:19:17] some blind, some hall, some withered. It
[1:19:19] would mean similar to a hospital room
[1:19:22] that there are people who have greater
[1:19:24] emergencies, lesser emergencies,
[1:19:26] different situations there.
[1:19:30] For an angel went down at a certain
[1:19:32] season into the pool and troubled the
[1:19:34] water, whosoever then first after the
[1:19:36] trouble in the water stepped in, was
[1:19:37] made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
[1:19:42] I wonder tonight if the agent were to
[1:19:45] trouble this water in their zoom room
[1:19:47] tonight, who would be the first person
[1:19:48] to say, "I am diving into this thing. I
[1:19:51] am going all in. Maybe I've been
[1:19:54] backslitten. Maybe I've been in church,
[1:19:55] but I already have not been as
[1:19:56] committed. I am diving all in to be
[1:19:58] completely whole." This is the picture
[1:20:00] that's there.
[1:20:03] And a certain man was there which had an
[1:20:05] infirmity 30 and 8 years. When Jesus saw
[1:20:09] him lie and knew that he had been now a
[1:20:12] long time in that case, he said unto
[1:20:14] him, "Wilt thou be made whole?"
[1:20:17] The impotent man answered him, "Sir, I
[1:20:19] have no man." This is the statement. "I
[1:20:21] have no man. There's nobody in my life.
[1:20:24] I have no cousin, no neighbor, no school
[1:20:28] friend, no church friend, nobody.
[1:20:33] I have no body." when the water is
[1:20:36] troubled to put me into the pool.
[1:20:41] But while I'm coming, another step down
[1:20:44] before me. And Jesus said unto him,
[1:20:47] "Rise, take up thy bed, and walk."
[1:20:51] Jesus healed him. And this is powerful.
[1:20:55] The issue for me is not the fact that
[1:20:57] Jesus healed him or the fact that he was
[1:21:00] coming or the fact that he had his
[1:21:02] children for a long time. The question I
[1:21:04] ask is this.
[1:21:06] How different his life would be if
[1:21:10] maybe he had invested in people in a
[1:21:12] different way. Even in coming there is
[1:21:15] there somebody who was next to him. He
[1:21:17] said here you see my condition was worse
[1:21:19] than yours. You want to help me?
[1:21:23] You looking younger and fit. Maybe you
[1:21:25] could go next year and and jump in. But
[1:21:28] and I want to just talk about the value
[1:21:30] because we're seeing here in scripture.
[1:21:34] There's not such a thing as so strong
[1:21:36] you will always stand alone. I want to
[1:21:37] make the point very clear. There will
[1:21:39] come a time in your life you will need
[1:21:41] help.
[1:21:43] And you have to have people you could
[1:21:45] rely on who could help. Somebody help
[1:21:47] may just be a word, an advice, a
[1:21:49] counsel.
[1:21:51] It could be a business decision you need
[1:21:53] to make, a family decision, a marital
[1:21:55] decision, a decision with your child you
[1:21:56] need to make, and you want to know. You
[1:21:58] could call somebody and say, "Here's
[1:21:59] what this is the situation. How would
[1:22:02] you approach it?
[1:22:05] Am I missing something? Am I not seeing
[1:22:07] something?"
[1:22:11] And we give the other example of the man
[1:22:14] who was healed through the roof because
[1:22:15] he had his four friends there.
[1:22:19] Despite his condition, he had
[1:22:21] relationships.
[1:22:24] In closing,
[1:22:27] the same way God longed for connection
[1:22:30] before creation
[1:22:33] is the same way God wants to see
[1:22:35] connection
[1:22:37] within creation.
[1:22:40] We have spent time talking about natural
[1:22:42] connections and God's desire for us to
[1:22:45] have natural connections. But the most
[1:22:48] important connection that you could
[1:22:50] leave with tonight is what I call the
[1:22:52] divine connection.
[1:22:57] While it's good to have people in your
[1:22:58] life who could point to you, point you,
[1:23:00] give you good advice, if you don't have
[1:23:02] the Lord Jesus in your life, this has
[1:23:05] nothing to do with church. People
[1:23:06] sitting in church and they don't have
[1:23:07] Jesus.
[1:23:10] People sit down and they believe and
[1:23:11] they don't have a relationship with the
[1:23:14] Lord.
[1:23:18] They know scriptures. They know church
[1:23:20] but they don't have a relation because a
[1:23:21] relationship speaks to their prayer
[1:23:23] life.
[1:23:26] And I've used the example many times.
[1:23:28] There are some people I know everybody
[1:23:30] in this room could tell me there's
[1:23:31] somebody who when you see their number
[1:23:32] on your phone calling, you know they're
[1:23:34] calling for something.
[1:23:37] The only time they call is when they
[1:23:38] call them for something outside of that
[1:23:41] you hear from them at all.
[1:23:44] Anybody know anybody like that? And the
[1:23:47] time people call when they calling you
[1:23:49] know it's some kind of stupidness. You
[1:23:51] know it's nothing positive, nothing
[1:23:52] good.
[1:23:55] Some of us that's how we are like with
[1:23:57] God. The only time we go to God is is a
[1:24:00] problem is a big problem because you
[1:24:03] don't do everything. you you going to
[1:24:05] get yourself into trouble and now you're
[1:24:06] saying Lord help me help me help me I
[1:24:08] can't fix it we don't have a
[1:24:10] relationship so the so so this is now
[1:24:12] taking it now to bring the point home to
[1:24:15] all of us
[1:24:17] if we were to ask because if I ask your
[1:24:20] coworker you have a relationship with
[1:24:21] this person this person has talked to
[1:24:22] you on the job you have people who tell
[1:24:24] you I don't talk to nobody I go to
[1:24:28] but if the Lord were to sit on here for
[1:24:30] an interview
[1:24:32] I want you to picture it and were to ask
[1:24:34] the Lord, hear this now. What would you
[1:24:37] say about this person in this room
[1:24:38] tonight? Do what is your relationship
[1:24:40] like with them? How often do they talk
[1:24:42] to you?
[1:24:44] How often do they have fellowship with
[1:24:46] you? Is it every day? Is it is it in
[1:24:49] morning and evening? Is it is it three
[1:24:52] times a day? Is it once a week? Is it
[1:24:53] once a month? What is the quality of the
[1:24:56] relationship that you have with this
[1:24:58] person? Because this is a two-way
[1:25:00] street. Because the Bible said, "I stand
[1:25:02] at the door and knock and whoever open,
[1:25:04] I will come." Because Jesus wants a
[1:25:07] personal relationship with all of us.
[1:25:10] But we are so busy
[1:25:12] in this thing called life that we have
[1:25:14] no control over because we don't hold
[1:25:16] tomorrow. We don't know what tomorrow
[1:25:18] will have. We don't know what Sunday
[1:25:19] will have, Monday. We live with a lot of
[1:25:21] assumption that we'll be here to do
[1:25:23] whatever we want to do.
[1:25:26] And we don't even know if we'll see
[1:25:27] tomorrow or Sunday or Monday or Tuesday
[1:25:29] or whatever that is.
[1:25:32] And we live our life in such reckless
[1:25:34] abandon. I ask ourselves the question,
[1:25:36] how could you leave your home in 2025
[1:25:39] and not commit your day to the Lord?
[1:25:41] Commit your way to the Lord. Commit your
[1:25:42] home to the Lord.
[1:25:45] You could have the best alarm system and
[1:25:46] the best dog and the best this. But I
[1:25:48] can guarantee you the Bible said the
[1:25:50] angels of the Lord encamp around among
[1:25:52] them that fear.
[1:25:55] There's no security like the security of
[1:25:57] the angels of the Lord.
[1:25:59] There's no covering and no protection
[1:26:01] than the Lord being able to do battle
[1:26:04] for you.
[1:26:07] I want a better relationship with God.
[1:26:10] That's my desire.
[1:26:12] I want a better relationship with my
[1:26:14] brothers, with my sisters, with with
[1:26:16] those who could have an influence over
[1:26:18] me, who I could have an influence over.
[1:26:19] That's a positive one. Not for
[1:26:21] foolishness.
[1:26:23] I've reached a point in my life by my
[1:26:25] tolerance of foolishness is very low. I
[1:26:27] don't know if it's a thing with getting
[1:26:29] older, but my tolerance of foolishness
[1:26:31] is just getting lower and lower because
[1:26:34] you're realizing how critical life is
[1:26:37] when people end up into real issues,
[1:26:39] real problems. And after the kiki and
[1:26:42] the laugh and the joke and the fun and
[1:26:43] this and that and recognize that is a
[1:26:45] life and death matter is a situation on
[1:26:47] the on the table or something and
[1:26:49] recognize here's what the laughing and
[1:26:50] the fun is not the currency that moves
[1:26:53] the needle.
[1:26:57] Do you have the currency of faith to
[1:26:59] move the needle? Do you have the prayer
[1:27:02] warriors
[1:27:04] that could really enter into the
[1:27:06] suffering with you to pray you through
[1:27:09] something? Do you have a relationship
[1:27:11] with God
[1:27:14] that your voice doesn't sound strange to
[1:27:16] God because he's hearing from you all
[1:27:18] the time? So when you do go to him in
[1:27:19] prayer, he knows he say that's that's my
[1:27:21] boy. The Bible speaks about Cornelius
[1:27:24] that Peter went to and the Bible said
[1:27:26] there was
[1:27:28] vial
[1:27:30] of prayers for him.
[1:27:33] In other words, he was praying so much
[1:27:36] they could have stored his prayers.
[1:27:40] You hear the context?
[1:27:42] So, however they storing prayers in
[1:27:44] heaven, they say that Cornelius
[1:27:46] says prayers stored up there.
[1:27:49] Is there a storage of prayer that have
[1:27:52] your name on it in heaven?
[1:27:57] Do you have that kind of a relationship?
[1:28:03] And have you, as we getting ready to
[1:28:04] close, have you emptied out your life
[1:28:08] that God could truly fill your life
[1:28:12] so we could shift the conversation from
[1:28:13] who are the people in your life to is
[1:28:17] there the person of Christ Jesus in your
[1:28:19] life? Is he in your life?
[1:28:23] A lot of people want to relate to church
[1:28:25] as a a feelood. I get a blessing. I hear
[1:28:28] a word. And but I don't want you to
[1:28:30] leave tonight. I feel encouraged.
[1:28:32] already we no is Jesus in your life.
[1:28:36] We sing the song come into my heart.
[1:28:42] I Is that something you really want?
[1:28:44] Because I can guarantee this. If he
[1:28:46] really comes in your life, there will be
[1:28:48] change. There will be transformation
[1:28:51] because light and darkness cannot live
[1:28:53] in the same house.
[1:28:55] for God to be able to have free reign.
[1:28:59] God's prophet spoke a message doors
[1:29:02] indoors. He says there are some people
[1:29:03] when you invite them to your house or
[1:29:06] they come to your house, you leave them
[1:29:07] right in the porch. You don't want them
[1:29:09] coming anywhere more than the porch.
[1:29:11] There are others you let them come into
[1:29:12] the living room and they can sit under
[1:29:14] the couch. You don't want them near the
[1:29:15] kitchen. There are people who you
[1:29:18] comfortable with. They come in the
[1:29:19] porch, they come in the living room,
[1:29:20] they can go in the kitchen, you tell
[1:29:20] them, "Listen, wherever you want, go and
[1:29:22] take it."
[1:29:23] because you have a better relationship
[1:29:25] with them. You have people that have no
[1:29:26] problem. So go into my bedroom and take
[1:29:28] a thing off the shelf.
[1:29:31] And he preach doors in doors. God wants
[1:29:33] to walk through every door of your
[1:29:35] house.
[1:29:38] Are there doors in your house that you
[1:29:40] trying to keep closed or you need to
[1:29:42] keep closed or you want to keep closed
[1:29:45] because there are things behind those
[1:29:46] doors that really and truly you don't
[1:29:48] want God to see or God really don't want
[1:29:50] to see.
[1:29:52] It requires a change, a choice, a
[1:29:54] rededication, a commitment. And that's
[1:29:56] why I would have said during the
[1:29:57] teaching tonight. There are people on
[1:30:00] your phone. Get them out. The people who
[1:30:02] you talk to, you had to stop. It's a
[1:30:04] hard stop. Do don't don't even let it
[1:30:05] down slowly. No. As for me and my house,
[1:30:08] we will serve it. If you want to serve
[1:30:09] God, you have to make a clean cut.
[1:30:15] You have to decide. And is a real
[1:30:17] decision. You need to be relentless
[1:30:21] with if you want to make progress
[1:30:23] spiritually as much as naturally,
[1:30:27] you have to make the tough decision to
[1:30:29] say, "Lord, I'm doing this all the way."
[1:30:33] Let us pray.
[1:30:35] Heavenly Father, we thank you tonight
[1:30:37] for this opportunity to gather, Lord,
[1:30:40] and to spend some time with this Bible
[1:30:43] study to have a conversation,
[1:30:46] Lord, around the influences
[1:30:49] in and around our lives. Lord, with
[1:30:53] the climax being you being the complete
[1:30:56] influence, you want to have the
[1:30:58] preeminence in us.
[1:31:00] You want to be the one to direct us, the
[1:31:02] driver of this car of our lives. Too
[1:31:05] many times we try to drive it and every
[1:31:07] time we drive, we end up into problems
[1:31:09] because we go against your will.
[1:31:12] But tonight, we want to allow you to
[1:31:15] take the driver's seat. And Lord, as
[1:31:17] Jesus said in the garden, he said, Lord,
[1:31:19] not my will, but thy will be done. Our
[1:31:22] will will always run contrary to yours.
[1:31:25] He said, for your ways are higher than
[1:31:27] our ways. Your thoughts are higher than
[1:31:28] our thoughts. Father, and when we look
[1:31:30] back through our life and see the things
[1:31:32] we thought we would achieve and thought
[1:31:33] we would do and even with sometimes the
[1:31:36] successes we have and we there's an
[1:31:38] emptiness that we feel because we could
[1:31:40] always find places where we didn't
[1:31:42] include you in it. The Bible says to
[1:31:45] acknowledge you in all of our ways and
[1:31:47] you will direct our paths. And Lord,
[1:31:50] there are many times we have done our
[1:31:52] own thing, done it the way we want, and
[1:31:54] when we look back, we realize we were
[1:31:56] missing the most important element. We
[1:31:59] never got your advice. We never got your
[1:32:00] counsel. We never sought you. We never
[1:32:02] prayed on it. We never spoke to the
[1:32:04] right people because you placed people
[1:32:06] in our lives so that we could have the
[1:32:09] right anchors and the right connections
[1:32:11] so that we could make better decisions,
[1:32:13] not worse decisions, better decisions.
[1:32:15] So Lord, help us to reframe this issue
[1:32:18] of who are the people in our lives. Not
[1:32:21] just you in our life, but the
[1:32:23] connections because on a daily basis, we
[1:32:25] interact with people, family members,
[1:32:27] neighbors, co-workers, whatever it might
[1:32:29] be. And it's so easy to get caught up
[1:32:32] until we don't even realize we have
[1:32:34] drifted away from our first love,
[1:32:37] drifted away from our calling, drifted
[1:32:38] away from our purpose. And what was one
[1:32:41] step away becomes two becomes five,
[1:32:43] becomes 10, becomes 15. We still come in
[1:32:45] the church. We still believe, but we're
[1:32:47] not as strong as we were because we have
[1:32:48] drifted away by words. The same way
[1:32:51] words allowed Eve to drift away. The
[1:32:54] same way words had an impact. Lord, help
[1:32:58] us to seek the right influences. Help us
[1:33:00] to have the right connections. Help us
[1:33:02] to get the strength to cut out people
[1:33:05] from our lives who are not helping us
[1:33:07] get closer to you. Because at the end of
[1:33:08] the day, it is no good. We do all of
[1:33:11] this and we don't get closer to you. May
[1:33:13] you strengthen those here tonight, Lord,
[1:33:15] who are looking for more of you. May you
[1:33:18] minister in homes, in families. May you
[1:33:20] bring peace, joy, deliverance. May you
[1:33:23] present something to your people, Lord.
[1:33:25] Lord, I'm just a microphone, a vessel.
[1:33:27] May you continue to work, Lord. And may
[1:33:29] you bless your people. May you bless the
[1:33:31] service this coming Sunday. May you be
[1:33:33] with your people in the precious name of
[1:33:35] Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. May the
[1:33:37] Lord richly bless you tonight. Thank you
[1:33:39] for being a wonderful audience. I pray
[1:33:41] you have a wonderful evening, a blessed
[1:33:43] weekend, and I look forward to seeing
[1:33:45] you in church on Sunday, Lord willing.
[1:33:47] God bless you and have a great night.
