[16:07] of our Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ
[16:09] amen amen
[16:12] well praise the Lord we want to turn to
[16:14] the book of Ephesians when I read a
[16:16] scripture from there
[16:17] chapter one
[16:24] [Music]
[16:29] Ephesians chapter 1 and we read from
[16:33] verse 3 read a few verses with the Lord
[16:47] blessed be the God and father of our
[16:51] Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[16:54] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[16:57] places in Christ according as he had
[17:02] chosen us in him before the foundation
[17:05] of the world that we should be holy and
[17:10] without blame before him in love having
[17:16] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[17:18] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[17:20] according to the good pleasure of his
[17:23] will to the praise of the glory of His
[17:27] grace wherein he had made us accepted in
[17:31] the beloved in whom we have redemption
[17:35] through his blood the forgiveness of
[17:38] sins according to the riches of His
[17:39] grace wherein he had abounded toward us
[17:43] in all wisdom and prudence having made
[17:47] known unto us the mystery of his will
[17:49] according to his good pleasure which he
[17:53] had purposed in himself that in the
[17:58] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[18:01] might gather together in one all things
[18:03] in Christ both which are in heaven which
[18:08] are good even in him in whom also we
[18:11] have obtained an inheritance being
[18:14] predestinated according to the purpose
[18:16] of him who worketh all things after the
[18:19] counsel of his own will praise the Lord
[18:25] wanna take another reading from chapter
[18:30] 2 and verse 18
[18:36] just any page I believe for through him
[18:39] we both have access by one spirit unto
[18:42] their father no therefore you are no
[18:46] more strangers and foreigners but
[18:48] fellow-citizens with the Saints and of
[18:53] the whole soul of God and I built upon
[18:56] the foundation of the apostles and
[18:58] prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the
[19:02] chief Cornerstone in whom all the
[19:05] building fitly framed together grid into
[19:09] a holy temple in the Lord in whom you
[19:14] also are builded together for habitation
[19:17] of God to the spirit may God are a
[19:20] blessing to the reading of his wound you
[19:22] may be seated
[19:23] praise the Lord praise the Lord
[19:29] help me tonight you read glory all right
[19:36] please the Lord now let me get a cootie
[19:43] a
[19:54] all right
[19:56] no Bella Bannon says I want to talk a
[19:59] little bit on the adoption but I BAM
[20:04] said what is adoption he said your
[20:09] adoption is not your booth he said your
[20:15] adoption is your place in so he said
[20:22] that we are born we are born by the
[20:25] Spirit of God we are children now when
[20:27] we were born were infants your children
[20:30] if you look at the infantile one could
[20:32] hardly do much he has everything has to
[20:34] be done for him that's how we are born
[20:37] however we born spiritually - we are
[20:39] infants you don't born again today and
[20:43] tomorrow as well I am say you're adopted
[20:46] it's not like that you born and you grow
[20:49] you're mature you are tried you are
[20:53] tested and then you are placed into the
[20:57] body of Christ so it's a process it's
[21:03] something we have to go true he said
[21:09] when Israel crossed the Jordan and
[21:13] entered into the land he said they were
[21:17] all Hebrews they were Hebrews they were
[21:20] born Hebrews they were children of
[21:21] Abraham descendants and all of them they
[21:23] were born that and across the Jordan
[21:26] into this promised land they were
[21:28] already Hebrews but they had to conquer
[21:31] the land and Joshua the leader of the
[21:34] day had to place them in their position
[21:37] in the land every tribe had a portion
[21:41] and every family in every tribe was
[21:43] given a portion of that tribes
[21:45] inheritance so that was the natural type
[21:48] so he said we are born with cheering
[21:52] aboard we say Abba Father hallelujah
[21:56] praise the Lord he say but we can't do
[21:59] much you say we cannot whip the
[22:02] Philistines but we have glory and we
[22:06] have princes and we have shouts we are
[22:08] children aboard
[22:10] he said but we we can do much we can rip
[22:14] the Philistines in so we have to be
[22:17] tried and tested and trained and put
[22:21] into the body of Christ that God could
[22:24] drive the enemy oak know that's the
[22:27] purpose of it God gave the earth to man
[22:31] he gave it to Adam and Adam was to bring
[22:35] 40 other sons of God and the earth was
[22:38] man's even today the scripture says that
[22:41] the whole creation is crying and
[22:43] groaning the looking forward to the
[22:47] manifestation of the sons of God the
[22:50] earth the very earth is crying for his
[22:53] master and to come back to his position
[22:55] to rule the earth the creation itself is
[22:59] groaning for that Abraham said who are
[23:01] these people everybody claiming to be
[23:04] these people did this religion and I
[23:08] will everybody claiming to be the sons
[23:09] of God but then God will manifest put
[23:13] his sons up he will place them in his
[23:16] body he will give them and they will
[23:19] comfort now but I'm saying they wouldn't
[23:22] even have to say anything it will speak
[23:24] for itself the winner you and I become a
[23:27] say well I'm a manifested son he said it
[23:30] will speak for itself but abarim once
[23:34] walked into a meeting and he didn't pray
[23:39] he had a gift for healing we know right
[23:40] he was given gifts of healing he didn't
[23:43] have to pray he just walked into the
[23:46] building and people started get up of
[23:49] out of wheelchairs people said I get
[23:51] healed people sought to be healed just
[23:52] like that without him I say in a word
[23:54] it's it speaks by itself but I'm saying
[23:59] if you stay in the gospel if you stay
[24:01] right one of these days God will call
[24:05] you aside and in the presence of angels
[24:09] he will gift you with something that
[24:11] will shake the world
[24:13] I drove a sail correctly but it's worse
[24:16] than that effect
[24:17] God will do it if you stay in the gospel
[24:20] if no you're born you are Hebrew in that
[24:23] sense
[24:23] you come into the land but you have to
[24:27] be placed you have to be positionally
[24:29] placed then everybody has a place every
[24:33] member of God's predestinated chosen
[24:36] bride there is a position then I
[24:39] Parabellum say let us not stop because
[24:42] God clean up our life and because you
[24:45] know he stopped us from we don't want to
[24:48] drink i me do wanna smoke and we don't
[24:49] wanna carry on we don't wanna run along
[24:51] you see let us not stop there but press
[24:54] on to a position there's a place for you
[24:58] God God has ordained for each and every
[25:01] one
[25:01] Amen all right who is the Lord praise
[25:10] the Lord
[25:10] he made me burn pits a mess at a time
[25:13] called he him where he went to where
[25:17] Paul spoke about the son though he was
[25:20] born a son but yet he was nothing more
[25:24] he wasn't above the servant in the house
[25:26] he was a son child a little child but
[25:30] I'm saying even shaven and he little
[25:32] child 1 the reason handle it yet you
[25:37] reach that stage where you could handle
[25:38] a razor but he might one degrees up so
[25:42] he has to grow and become a man I've
[25:45] become aware of what is what on you know
[25:47] on and before he could be handling these
[25:49] sort of things Obama say we are placed
[25:54] into the body is about what is the body
[25:56] of Christ he said some apostles some
[25:59] prophets some are teachers some
[26:04] evangelists and some pastors is all
[26:07] right we are called to he says butters
[26:10] has gifts of tongues interpretation of
[26:13] tongues wisdom knowledge miracles
[26:17] working of miracle all these different
[26:19] gifts so you see they are different is
[26:23] not only pastors and prophets and
[26:24] teachers and evangelists there are give
[26:29] up tongues
[26:30] anybody could ever give up tongue once
[26:33] it's God will for you you can have a
[26:34] give up the interpretation of tongues a
[26:36] give of wisdom a give of knowledge I'll
[26:41] give up miracles that ever work in a
[26:43] miracles all these different gifts so
[26:45] all of these things are in the body but
[26:47] you have to be placed into the body
[26:50] you're not just born again a little in
[26:53] front you can be placed yet you have to
[26:54] be trained and we know the story of the
[26:57] e the Father put in a tutor over his son
[27:01] to teach him the business and the tutor
[27:04] will be reporting and he typed that as
[27:06] the Holy Spirit reporting back to board
[27:07] and Simmel boy but if you see when your
[27:10] son do did you touch him to quantify the
[27:13] holy son behaving you know and he has to
[27:18] be tested and tried and even when this
[27:21] son because my beloved always saying
[27:23] that is what type a son he's not did
[27:26] nine years son you know you're born
[27:28] again a child of God but the
[27:30] Pentecostals were born again in 1906 and
[27:34] they taught that was it they taught the
[27:38] born of God and that was it and gives
[27:40] you among them and they they misuse he
[27:45] gives the misuse he gives you know they
[27:50] went about it and you're wrong and but
[27:52] did he teleport is that they taught that
[27:54] just to be born again that was it
[27:58] no we are born again you a child but
[28:00] then the message that we are received
[28:04] let me just read this year
[28:06] the message we have received is a take
[28:09] us from the birth we could stay at the
[28:13] Bottineau and field as a - yes
[28:20] Parabellum says here do you believe in
[28:22] dispensations Bible said so in the
[28:26] dispensation of the fullness of time
[28:28] what is the fullness of time there's
[28:31] been a dispensation of well there was a
[28:33] dispensation of the Mosaic law there was
[28:38] a dispensation of John the Baptist
[28:40] there was a dispensation of Christ
[28:44] there was a dispensation of church
[28:46] organization there was a dispensation of
[28:50] the outpouring of this holy spirit and
[28:53] hear what he said
[28:53] know the dispensation of adoption what
[29:01] the world written and runing for the
[29:06] would the creation itself god made man
[29:09] master of the earth where bam said Adam
[29:14] in the garden could have spoke to the
[29:17] river and say instead of going this way
[29:22] go this way so the earth knows is master
[29:27] and the earth is grown and the old one
[29:31] to see is master to Commander rule yet
[29:34] again what even God can take a man and
[29:49] adopt him into the family and give him
[29:52] something that first ride up and see if
[29:57] is right the Bible said try this spirit
[30:00] this man claim a certain thing try it
[30:03] and see if it's right if it is right
[30:07] move right with it then say Lord send us
[30:11] something else
[30:12] keep moving see just keep moving till
[30:16] every fellow takes his place then you're
[30:21] going to see the Church of God begin to
[30:24] get to its place then you're going to
[30:27] see the church I've got begin to get to
[30:29] split tens when the Philistines will go
[30:32] to backing up before last I'm not going
[30:36] to back up from a little child you
[30:38] understand I mean your child yes but you
[30:41] you wonderful it's tiny how is it the
[30:48] shorts that's when the church gets to
[30:50] this place the shorts will go off here
[30:54] will grow down
[30:56] faces will be washed cigars will be
[31:00] missing that's right when the church
[31:03] begins to get into its mighty power yet
[31:06] is when they have an Ananias and
[31:11] Sapphira and a few of them yes sir
[31:16] you'll see when that Holy Church stands
[31:19] together in its power positionally
[31:21] pleased
[31:22] sons of God adopted into the family of
[31:27] God
[31:28] powerful church standing there in his
[31:30] glory who that's what he's coming for no
[31:37] I mean since I come into the Ambassador
[31:40] looking to go in the rapture but you
[31:43] hear what you come in for is not just a
[31:45] Christian born-again believe God and
[31:50] baptized into the battle with holy
[31:54] spirit born again but you see the kind
[31:56] of church is coming for this that we
[31:59] just read yeah just standing in his
[32:00] power
[32:04] that's what he's coming for and there
[32:07] was a quote I do know it a friend but
[32:09] her heart is written here to let the
[32:11] people positionally find their place and
[32:14] be ready for the hour of battle and he
[32:20] talked about alright let me read this
[32:21] one year his Holy Spirit is here and
[32:25] he's trying to place his church in order
[32:28] place it in the promised land so that
[32:32] all the enemies can be drove out so is
[32:37] that train church like when Abraham Chi
[32:39] trained his his servants and he went
[32:42] after lot was taken by some kings there
[32:45] was this battle king some Kings against
[32:47] for against fight King and so on and so
[32:49] on and they had captured Sodom and they
[32:51] took a lot and his family and if we are
[32:53] trained his servants showing them men
[32:56] who grew up in his house trained them
[32:58] and went after the enemy and brought
[33:00] back his brother amen and this is what
[33:04] it's about because we had to start
[33:09] looking
[33:10] well I mean do that really you know in
[33:14] the spirit and seeking God they would be
[33:16] looking always I've been looking out I
