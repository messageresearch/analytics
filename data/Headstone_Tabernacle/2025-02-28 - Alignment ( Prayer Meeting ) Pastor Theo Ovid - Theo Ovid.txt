listening on those that would hear it later on Father be with them in a special way we are such a need people and we confess that be an need of you gr it Lord in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen God bless you and welcome thanks for being here tonight uh for this prayer meeting and uh what a week we had uh we had put up uh but Andrew's um things pertain a life and godliness he didn't want to go up but I felt it was something uh helpful and um it will edify you the science of favor when you have God's favor it shows and you find favor you get access to key persons and the reason that they are key persons is because they have keys don't waste time with your critics and haters who have no keys that's so powerful very encouraging Joseph as an example man finding favor and you know how the brothers felt about it but I want to read two scriptures in that regard Luke 1:30 says and the angel said unto her SP Mary fear not Mary but th was found favor with God and Luke 2 52 and this is a powerful scripture Luke 252 says and Jesus increased in wisdom and sture and in favor with God and man and brother Anthony Wednesday night what a powerful was a masterpiece power belonged unto God and he said that faith is a hack to your operating system God by passing your senses to power you up and darkness is the absence of light is because the sons of God are out of position God can restore back the factory settings or manufactur theault I say it this way like we had in the Garden of Eden that is what happened to about brandham he was restored to theault setting of sunship before the four was such a so much nugget inside the day was such a blessing and God did not fight with Darkness or argue with Darkness he just called for the light let there be light so that's a really a blessing on on Wednesday night and I was tremendously blessed so but aie was talking about the reference to like a cell phone and it have uh different things dear that you may not be aware of but when a need arises if there's issues you could get it reset reset and I trust tonight that God help us that if there are issues that we could get reset get aligned correctly tonight so in getting down into prayer the devil wants to mess up with this signals so you don't get a connection Daniel was praying in the real of the spirit Angel got delayed because of the battle which spirit is trying to hinder the answer from coming true but Ram said This Way Daniel has stop praying the angel have to stop coming so Daniel prayer was actually activating things in the realm of the spirit and so would we tonight and crying out unto God sometime you just have to change the position I experienced it you're going to country area there may be a static space there may be a a blank spot may not have a cell tower you can't get a connection you can't get through until you change your position sometimes it's a company you keep affecting things from coming through like Abraham and lot when lot separate from Abraham the connection come through lot look Abraham look east west north and south all this yours tonight I have two scripture I like to read from Genesis 114 and Amos 33 two scriptures genesis4 says and God said let there be light in the firment of of the heaven to divide the day from the night let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and Amos 37 says can two work together except it be agreed at tonight I have one word let to share for this perent alignment one word alignment alignment refers to the proper position or adjustment of parts in relation to each other so you can't really align to yourself you have to align to someone or something it can also mean arrangement in a straight line or being arranged in a line or in proper position so when God set the Stars up the lights in the filament he said them for times seasons and so on like that and but talk about uh the cloud that came down 19 20 uh February 1963 we say February 28th and today is February 28th and tonight there say seven planets align on February 20 which is tonight time where to watch what you need to know Mercury will join Mars Jupiter Uranus Neptune Venus and Saturn in the nights sky in a phenomenon that will not be seen again till 2014 so to me this is very significant because here is what brother Bram says in 1962 the 19th of March he said tree is the number of perfection we all know that tree is number is numerology God is known by numbers Tre is perfection seven worship 24 is worship 40 is Temptation 50 is Pentecost Jubilee all these numbers is numerous God is perfected and perfect three is a number Perfection and we know uh seven is completion he said now we know God is perfected in three grace is five seven is completion like the world seven is completion he said eight is the first day again he said now what happened we see the roar in the paper host newspapers and so on he said what taking place five stars fell in what was it introducing of what this 962 since then look what took place Germany almost wash off the map he says England the other day a storm that Blown Away 70,000 houses in one day disasters he says Los Angeles like to wash into the ocean what is it the beginning of Storrow earthquakes has begin to pick up everywhere why what is it five stars come in line God's grace what happened an infant Church a bride infancy that the power of God has begin to fall on her she's taken form a bride for his bridegroom and so on so in 1962 the prophet identify that this bride by a sign of five stars aligning itself together was a bride in its infancy well 2025 is a long ways from 1962 the question tonight is these Seven Stars that align itself what does that mean but the church for the bride for the revelation of the word what does that mean is it that the bride now is mature coming into rightness because at some point in time we must come into maturity that's what rightness is about when the fruit comes to full maturity it means that it no longer have to grow anymore in other words the plant put forth his flower his bird his flower then come the fruit the food is green then it gets bigger then afterwards it doesn't grow anymore it stops and then something happens it begins to ripe and the sun light helps to accelerate that ripness and the growth is no longer there's no need to grow because the frood has reached its maturity it's a ripening it's a bacon out of the greenness it's a bacon out of the foolishness it's a bacon out like how the scripture says in Corinthians when I was a child I speak like a child on as a child when I became a man I put away childish things I write unto you children I write to you young men I write your fathers the object is to get to fatherhood the object is to get to maturity the object is to get us to a position where we are aligned with the word and with the spirit not just with the word but with the spirit same as how the prophet said we have to get into the unity of the spirit until we come to the unity of the faith men love argument men love debate men love to know that they have words that they could beat down somebody else and ridicule somebody else and uh make laughter and criticize somebody else but all of that will come to a close because the manifestation will be the interpretation God have allowed men and are talking about men a spirit of man um with all his glory and power with all in numbers and church power and people power and influence power and whatever power they think they have but all of that must come to an end because it's man is human but Anthony kept it off last night power belonged to God this power that belongs to God God himself in his sovereignity will allocate that power or give that power out for example uh look what God Said to Brown he says you have been given power to bind a m but be more sincere now that is God zooming in on the prophet's heart mind and spirit that's not physical that sincerity is calling for it's not a natural thing it's not like getting a brand new car and the car is dirty wash it down this is something internal this is something human other human other fellow ministers preachers they can't see that they can't speak that they can't talk that this is the god this is the omnipotent all powerful God that knows the end from the beginning that knows when the fly B its eye that God that same God is what could go the manufacturer then the the the producer of this being called man when he looks into the the stream the consciousness of the man he recognized there something need to be sharpened something need to be hounded this same God is who tap him by a bar behind his shoulder and tell him I forgive you and look you condemn her talking about the woman he was condemning that same God did that that same God is who give him options of power if you say die they will die if you said blind will blind and everything else to see what the sun will do so we know it I've preaching it so many times you are tested before power tested with power tested to see what you going power man is corrupt who can know it but God the heart of man is desperate to corrup you see if you want to see what in somebody give them power give them money put them in some power position see how they manage that we have seen it over and over without character without the metal without What It Takes and that's why we have to go through stuff to get that that metal out of it the fire the burning the how they say it gold tried with fire the fire to as talk about beaten out until you could see the reflection so if the reflection is not being seen is mean then stuff still started here and God have to keep working on this so I trust tonight that these few things that we sharing tonight would help to realize that God want us to align you know I here it's something called the S PG skill and you know it D do it's just s and afterwards it go back to one just like seven days and 7 go Sunday go back to Saturday and then the next day is back to Sunday again the e8th day is back to the first day do that octave goes back to see so the original church that sat the Pentecost we have to come back to that it went through processes doti do it comes right back to that door and that do mean same signs same wonders same Miracles but brand them now he said the other Angels was men of the Earth but this Angel the one that come down he said didn't come from the earth he come from Heaven because the miss Myster is all finished and when the mystery is finished the angel said time shall be no more and seven Thunders throw their voices out what if it is something to let us know how to enter into Rapture in fate is it will we run and leap over walls is just something fixing to happen and these old mad VI bodies are going to be changed can I lift a see it oh Lord is it so close that I'll see it in this generation still is my brethren what time is it where we at then he said this here it might be closer than you think it is it got me scared I haven't done enough where are we at time shall be no more he announces that time is over what happens what happens could that be son Brethren seriously think if it is then the pyramid is kep by the seven thund this is such a powerful thing if it is the pyramid is cut by the seven Thunders then he went down this route you remember the P message it's a Capstone what did it do the Holy Spirit capped off the individual and sealed it when we added to our faith righteousness and godliness and faith and so forth kept adding till we got seven things the seventh one was love so he's saying to our faith we add seven things the seventh one is love which is God that is how he makes the individual and it caps him and seals him with the Holy Spirit then if that be so here's what this person got he's got seven Church agents that he's had seven Mysteries that been sounded away and they fought for to bring back and now the headstone comes to cap off the church does the Thunders mean that my brethren Sayes where we at he identified the seven Thunders seven voices he identified the seven thund seven seals he identified the seven thund seven Mysteries he identifi the the seven lights and go on and on and on what do you want him to be tonight he's the I am he could be a lawyer could be a Healer baptizer people don't want to connect with each others with the virtues at all they they angry upset they wanted to be just Mysteries alone but he said more than just that these divinely reveal mystery truth and like to say the seven Thunders seven voices revealing the hidden mysteries of R 10 3 and 4 it reveal every mystery who reveals the mystery but Christ who is Christ Christ is the Holy Ghost all seven virtues Christ is that so it's two things what the Thunders is and what the Thunders does it's not the same thing let me repeat it again tonight what the Thunders is what the seven Thunders does if that be so then the seven Thunders Capt the perit why am I saying that tonight why because there's seven stars up there align itself there's an alignment going on tonight there some people don't like to align by anything they're so in love with theel they just parade the beef they do their own thing you tell them do it so so they don't want to follow in line you have problems and you will have continue to have problems if you don't want to line up like what alignment means alignment means it's a set pattern it's an order it's a structure God have things set a certain way God doesn't do random things he doesn't just you know get a say a lapse and just how to do no no no things are set that's why they could predict when the next uh uh uh sat uh thing will be comet or whatever thing in the stars because God have it set a certain way the only people out of alignment is man his sons and that is why there's so much Darkness because the alignment we we have to come into alignment God here Judah here Ephraim here so who God Called to raise oats should raise oats who God Called to raise a sheep supposed to what whatever it is and to stay in position we have not yet matured into that too much jealousy envy and Petty foolishness that why men keep running believing that if they out your candle their light will shine bright which is foolishness that is what caus men to be that what Joseph Joseph just a quote the a quote a rainbow quat and his brothers get a fight that was once in a fight when he start to give them dreams now the fight he's get optimized the heat of the fight get higher they are jealous they're angry and they come to conclusion you know what just get rid of this problem that's what the mistake that they made or how sometimes God uses or allowed to be used these issues of life and these challenges of life to put you into your place and your destiny so they didn't even know that by rejecting Joseph by rejecting him and selling him out they were actually send him into his Destiny and Paul Joseph he had a terrible time but eventually he he grew he matured he ripened and he understood to the point that he could tell them and say this way God send me ahead of you to preserve life he didn't say you you all Wicked he didn't say you all sold me out he knew the higher purpose and sometimes I ask the question what will it take for you for the people to see the higher purpose why do you grel in the human in the natural as if the battle is flesh and blood why do you think that is this one and that one and this and that and you have all the accus in the world why and when are you going to see this battle is not flesh and blood it's not human it's the Battle of angels have become the Battle of men and we are caught up in between hell trying to pull you down Heaven trying to pull you up and we are caught up in between the Angels already came down put a sign in the sky and he throw the Thunders in the sky that's what this is about throw the Thunders in the sky to tell us there's something we could look up to we could look up to this Capstone we could look up the Dynamics we could look up to this Glory we could look up to this power we can look up because our Redemption draw it now we have something we can look up to and this power belongs to God this power belong to some Pastor or some man or some Apostle man or Prophet man or teacher man or evangelist man this power don't belong to them they they they have that to hand out and and I'll show you why I'm going to close uh let's get to this here now but he's talking about his a Shepherd dream here and he said now five streams coming down and it's the holy spirit that bed this span Church the holy spirit that give the pamos church the Titar Church in Dark Ages is the holy spirit that built that bride the elect that is pulled out of all organization system to the I want you to think the elect is never a group The elect are individuals okay so the holy spirit in program was right now there's an elected a predestinated bride of Jesus Christ that the Holy Spirit has called out the elect it's been the Holy Ghost in This age that age that age on up down up to the Holy Spirit now this is what he saying now as I wrap up here and now as in the individuals these virtues and things knowledge and Temperance is added to Our Fate then when the Capstone comes the whole Holy Spirit cemented together there is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is why so short today he said now coming from the Holy Spirit what is come then he will give you Supernatural Faith spiritual Faith at the bottom now that spiritual Fai recognizes only the word no matter what anybody else says it don't do no good that only knows the word if somebody says this a miracle is past that Faith only knows the word and number one coming into your mental Faith Comes the Holy Spirit into your mental faith and makes it a spiritual faith that recognizes only the word number two three then you'll have spiritual faith and you'll have the Holy Spirit that will seal all these things into you as the Holy Spirit covers this then listen to this from your faith up to the Holy Spirit and so in other words he's talking from Faith virtue knowledge Temperance until that slot called Holy Spirit from your faith up to the Holy Spirit seals you with with with Christ then you become one you become one you and Christ become one and Christ live together at that day so he's quoting in John 1420 now you will know I'm in the Father the father in me I in you you in me and that's a sealed unit of the Lord God now and when and then they are Vindicated and placed and when that time takes place they become Vindicated Sons and Daughters of God not before but when that time takes place they become that I'm closing three scriptures Psalms 19 105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my part that is when the word begin to get the pinenes in your life the word itself becomes your lamp Romans 12:2 and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect well of God and the last one Matthew 6:33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you you aligning with God's plan you aligning with God God's will you aligning with God's purpose God want the word to be a lamp God want your mind to be transformed because he want you to know his will and God want you to seek first the kingdom I close with these words that I started off with alignment refers to the proper positioning or adjustment of parts in relation to each other it can also mean arrangement in a straight line or being arranged in a line on in a proper position when God asks Ezekiel can these bones live and the Bible talk about bone come to Bone the neck bone car go down to the foot bone the backbone can't go to the neck you know in other words it has to line up so the knee bone have to go to the hipbone and the hipbone everything have to line up and then the prophecy for the Flesh and the skin and then the breath friends we have to line up with God's word and we have to line up with each other let's bow ahead Heavenly Father we thank you for you said that there will be a fivefold Ministry for the Perfection of the Saints for the work of the ministry till we all come to the unity of the faith to the knowledge of the Son of God that we don't be no more children tossed to and through but each joint supplying Lord therefore there must be connections to get supplied we as a human being you who made us so wonderful and fearfully we were fearfully and wonderful made made you put everything in position the ears where it's supposed to to be the eyes the mouth and we don't want anything to get out of alignment or get out of order we want to stay whole we want to stay sober and sound this is a natural body what about the spiritual body and people talking negative instead of talking positive and I pray and Trust then that the words that you spoke through but Anthony about how Darkness was addressed you didn't even speak to Darkness but you just say you call for light and darkness have to scatter when light comes forward and light is the word made manifest father God I pray tonight as your people get down in prayer may your spirit come upon them speak to them anoint them Quicken them Inspire them may this prayer prayer supplication come upon them may they know tonight that even though there's rry there's the carnival Atmos and people in the spirit of what's Happening Now aside apart from that up in the sky the lights that you said will be here for Saints God is speaking something and the other scripture we read how can two walk together L they are agreed there must be an agreement there must be a partnership there must be an alignment that we could truly work together but we know according to your word there there's going to be a Unity of the faith nothing will stop that not what any Pastor or minister or church or whoever think whatever they are there's going to be a Unity of De Fai that is what you send the prophet to do to restore heart back to the faith of the fathers there's only one fate it's not 10 it's not 20 it's not 15 Lord have different doctrines and interpretations but there's only one fate even there's one Lord and even there's one baptism Bless the people tonight as they get on in prayer Ines name I ask it amen and amen so friends I trust that these words would help you and that you would seek God to align with his word I like what brother Andrew shared about favor because in favor you have to be seeking God for God's favor and if you're really looking for God's favor why you have to worry about who think what shake that off seek to please God to favor with God and he will make a way for you so God bless you as we get down in prayer tonight praise the Lord [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
