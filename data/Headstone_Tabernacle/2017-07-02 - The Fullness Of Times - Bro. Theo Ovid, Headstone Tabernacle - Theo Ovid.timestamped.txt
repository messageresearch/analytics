[42:30] 100 watt 1 to 11 Ephesians chapter 1 on
[42:34] the word between verse 3 to 10 Thank You
[42:39] positions regions in Jesus name - you're
[42:43] welcome we tend to all those connected
[42:46] to us on the internet welcome you to
[42:49] Sunday morning worship fellowship unto
[42:54] God Daniel chapter 12 we have of one to
[43:02] four and at that time shall Michael
[43:05] stand up the Great Prince which standeth
[43:09] for the children of thy people under
[43:12] there shall be a time of trouble such as
[43:16] never was since there was a nation even
[43:18] to that same time and at that time thy
[43:23] people shall be delivered every one that
[43:26] shall be found written in the book many
[43:29] of them that sleep in the dust of the
[43:31] earth shall awake some to everlasting
[43:35] life and some to shame and everlasting
[43:40] contempt what did that be wise shall
[43:43] shine as the brightness of the firmament
[43:46] and they that turn many to righteousness
[43:48] as the stars for ever and ever but Thou
[43:52] O Daniel shut up the words and seal the
[43:55] book even to the time of the end many
[43:59] shall run to and fro knowledge shall be
[44:02] increased even from first Corinthians
[44:05] chapter 10 when I read from verse 1
[44:10] moreover brethren I would not that ye
[44:12] should be ignorant how that all our
[44:15] fathers were under the cloud and all
[44:19] passed through the sea were all applies
[44:22] unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea
[44:24] did all eat the same spiritual meat did
[44:27] all drink the same spittle drink for the
[44:29] junk of that spiritual rock that
[44:31] followed him that rock was Christ but
[44:35] with many of them God was not well
[44:39] pleased for they were overthrown in the
[44:42] wilderness now these things were our
[44:46] examples to the intent we should not
[44:51] lust after evil things as they also
[44:54] lusted neither be idolaters as were some
[44:59] of them as it is written the people sat
[45:02] down to eat and drink and rose up to
[45:06] play neither let us commit fornication
[45:09] as some of them committed and fell in
[45:11] one day three and twenty thousand
[45:13] neither let us tempt Christ some of them
[45:17] also tempted and were destroyed of the
[45:19] Serpent's neither murmur ye of them also
[45:22] murmured and were destroyed of the
[45:25] destroyer now all these things happen
[45:30] unto them for example and they are
[45:36] written for our admonition upon whom the
[45:40] ends of the world come final scripture
[45:44] Ephesians chapter three one we want to
[45:47] read from verse 3 blessed be the God and
[45:52] father of our Lord Jesus Christ God
[45:54] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[45:56] in heavenly places in Christ according
[45:59] as he had chosen us in him before the
[46:03] foundation of the world I would be
[46:05] wholly without blame before him in love
[46:08] having predestinated us unto the
[46:10] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[46:12] himself according to the good pleasure
[46:14] of his will to the praise of the glory
[46:17] of His grace where any admittance
[46:19] accepted in the beloved
[46:20] whom we have redemption through his
[46:21] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[46:23] to the riches of His grace wherein he
[46:26] had a bond towards us in all wisdom and
[46:28] prudence having made known unto us the
[46:31] mystery of his will according to his
[46:34] good pleasure which he had purposed in
[46:37] himself that in the dispensation of the
[46:40] fullness of times he might gather
[46:43] together in one all things in Christ
[46:47] both which are in heaven and which are

[1:04:29] when he did God call this man listen he
[1:04:34] wasn't a Nocera seminary when he called
[1:04:37] him he was plowing a field but a yoke of
[1:04:40] oxen the service taking care of his
[1:04:42] mother and father God called him to be
[1:04:47] the successor of Elijah Elijah perhaps
[1:04:50] many up at the school thought they were
[1:04:52] sure to do going to be his successor
[1:04:55] they weren't aware his role as soon as
[1:04:57] he was finished but God does the callin
[1:05:02] God does the chosen God does the
[1:05:07] electing and God does the second in
[1:05:11] order do you love him God are set in the
[1:05:19] church some apostles some prophets some
[1:05:22] teachers some evangelists and pastors
[1:05:23] God does that himself we cannot make one
[1:05:28] hair black or white neither can be added
[1:05:31] wanting to over stature by taking
[1:05:33] thought God in His infinite grace and by
[1:05:38] his election and foreknowledge sets
[1:05:42] these things in order
[1:05:45] and every real was just right I like
[1:05:50] that I would be a discouragement this
[1:05:52] morning is I didn't believe in the
[1:05:55] election and calling of God if I thought
[1:05:59] that this world was Lester the outcome
[1:06:02] of it by the power men and by the wisdom
[1:06:05] of man and by United Nations who never
[1:06:08] mentioned God's name I'd be discouraged
[1:06:10] person but I'm not looking at that for
[1:06:12] the outcome I looked at the pages of
[1:06:14] this old book here where God wrote it
[1:06:17] out and everything will come just
[1:06:20] exactly the way he said it so you're not
[1:06:23] looking for man for your outcome you
[1:06:26] don't give an uncle and Aunty and
[1:06:27] Pantheon this bishop and this ministers
[1:06:29] Association
[1:06:30] you don't look if attack for your
[1:06:31] outcome you look into the world for your
[1:06:34] outcome because once that word is spoken

[1:29:56] some priests not to some bishops but you
[1:29:59] have your own line back to your father I
[1:30:02] want a number
[1:30:04] [Applause]
[1:30:09] but this part is incredible after the
[1:30:14] doors of the Gentiles exclus God would
[1:30:19] anoint a church then what does that mean
[1:30:24] that those of the Gentiles is closed
[1:30:27] Bible call the Jews the olive tree olive
[1:30:32] branch and God cut them off to put this
[1:30:35] while olive branch in called the
[1:30:37] Gentiles and the Bible talked about the
[1:30:40] times of the Gentiles until the fullness
[1:30:42] of the Gentiles come in so therefore the
[1:30:44] Gentiles have a specific train not a
[1:30:47] specific time but called the fullness of
[1:30:48] the Gentiles until the time the center
[1:30:50] come in so it means that when that time
[1:30:52] come in not one more name person would
[1:30:55] be seized so don't wait for the door to
[1:31:01] shut because no harder 120 years where
[1:31:04] people had an opportunity to receive it
[1:31:05] to receive the message then when goats
[1:31:08] are the telling oil is in time of your
[1:31:11] fullness of time has come so started
[1:31:13] getting emails in two by two people see
[1:31:15] that and total at work we do not have
[1:31:17] enough found inside earlier when they
[1:31:19] confronted or but after was go at the
[1:31:21] door seven days it talks had visions of
[1:31:25] doomed
[1:31:26] people the acts at recent the people who
[1:31:31] could not be seized oh yes whatever
[1:31:34] repeat again yes in church yes people
[1:31:38] have accomplished a turn here and table
[1:31:40] you see because they were already
[1:31:42] rejected you mean those people that was
[1:31:45] preaching to no fun for no yes for seven
[1:31:47] days until the rains out of all those
[1:31:49] people say no no I said no but the only
[1:31:54] problem is Noah didn't shut the door got
[1:31:57] it and what watch door what shut no man
[1:32:02] could open
[1:32:04] what God or man or God opened Noman good
[1:32:07] shot
[1:32:08] so when God the door the door shut Oh
[1:32:10] hallelujah so while you have a chance to
[1:32:13] make things right while you have a
[1:32:15] chance to be reconciled to God please do
[1:32:18] I could with my family to save the Lord
[1:32:26] you know I will have with no choice but
[1:32:28] I choose that I choose this is the hard
[1:32:31] way is now our way either smoke and
[1:32:33] drink and run around but this is the
[1:32:35] hard way it is Christian soldier did not
[1:32:39] natural soldier this is Christian
[1:32:41] soldier well your real life is beer
[1:32:45] before all a Christian life is a public
[1:32:47] ledger or each other privatized no is a
[1:32:54] public life is a public life in a public
[1:32:57] testimony let me live in our Friday your
[1:33:00] Christian a way a way to move you're a
[1:33:03] Christian
[1:33:04] maybe impersonating a Christian is a
[1:33:06] public servant
[1:33:07] that's why God they take the blood
[1:33:09] opportunity or post your put it behind
[1:33:11] the door well I am like how I look in
[1:33:13] the color my blendin no we don't have

[1:33:50] God will add not the church with the
[1:33:52] power of God and things will be taking
[1:33:55] place not only then that's prophecy even
[1:33:59] as now as a resident Branham recognizing
[1:34:02] the in his message but a man says now
[1:34:04] the church has not recognized the day I
[1:34:05] get her back and a whole Palestine she
[1:34:07] is going to be forced into work on the
[1:34:09] churches why she didn't recognize this
[1:34:11] bahawa he said let him that 3230 still
[1:34:13] let him that holy be holy still
[1:34:16] no above ye a woman she can't be because
[1:34:20] was a woman look at you here you see a
[1:34:22] bugger woman she can't be no that sounds
[1:34:25] very slack that the scripture the Bible
[1:34:28] says she dishonored her head her head is
[1:34:31] a husband his head is Christ so she does
[1:34:33] honors Christ how can she be
[1:34:35] dishonorable and the facility let's see
[1:34:38] that God Bob here let us keep it so
[1:34:41] now's when that time come
[1:34:43] it sets your condition it's like a
[1:34:47] snapshot that stops you and that's your
[1:34:50] picture you can't change it that's what
[1:34:54] that means

[1:35:23] the current carrier will evade it
[1:35:25] whatever it wants that's the stream of
[1:35:27] life and you go in with life everybody's
[1:35:29] doing that but that same driftwood could
[1:35:33] be carved out into a boat and put a
[1:35:35] power of an engine to power it to guide
[1:35:38] it like directed this is what you want
[1:35:41] you don't want to be drifting because
[1:35:43] even just your head there was the fall I
[1:35:45] want to say if you just go ahead towards
[1:35:49] the fall
[1:35:50] don't risk let your eyes be guided let
[1:35:54] your life be directed by the Spirit of
[1:35:56] God Oh hallelujah

[1:36:20] Israel in the womb is a massive force
[1:36:23] but Israel in the homeland that's not
[1:36:25] force I put the work on the churches but

[2:36:26] is driven aside by manifestation they
[2:36:30] don't have to see one word about it no
[2:36:33] people just the money necessary so kind
[2:36:40] so Christ like God call this genocide by
[2:36:44] manifestation they don't have to say one
[2:36:46] word about it you see something happen
[2:36:48] positionally placed tons of God God
[2:36:50] getting into him to order exactly what
[2:36:53] the same thing and he just has as much
[2:36:55] authority his word is just as good as an
[2:36:57] angel even better
[2:36:59] the son was adopted within the hybrids
[2:37:02] set out the changes ropes changes colors
[2:37:04] the father of ceremony this is my son of
[2:37:07] henceforth his governor his ruler he's
[2:37:10] over all my heritage all I have belongs
[2:37:12] to him
[2:37:12] oh praise and that's the reason the
[2:37:15] coming of the seals at the finishing of
[2:37:17] the seventh seal the mystery of God to
[2:37:20] be finished to know who God is what he
[2:37:23] is how he lives his nature his being you
[2:37:26] are supposed to be all the way of death
[2:37:28] by that time to bring us into the full
[2:37:32] stature of the sons of God of God they
[2:37:35] come right back to the mystery of the
[2:37:37] seventh seal under little seven feet of
[2:37:39] seven thunders and he says we supposed
[2:37:41] to be all the way up here like that time
[2:37:43] or the imposed you suppose me in there
[2:37:45] spike that time what time to put this on
[2:37:47] time when the fullest sense of them is
[2:37:50] trained to see the manifestation of the
[2:37:52] sons of God we are weakened on it
[2:37:55] Oh glory to God hallelujah praise be to
[2:37:58] Jesus hallelujah
[2:38:00] seven seals but I wanna know for the
[2:38:02] endtime message this seal he reveal all
[2:38:07] these two kills but he don't see nothing
[2:38:09] about the seventh so the seventh seal is
[2:38:12] for the endtime essage
[2:38:16] first four seas history also fifty
[2:38:20] thousand reorder for steel be system and
[2:38:22] source acute earthquake 7c silence it
[2:38:28] does another one is seven seals
[2:38:29] but the end time seal when its acts will
[2:38:33] be a total secret only when it sucks but
[2:38:36] I was finishing we just went that you
[2:38:39] suppose we wait of the road now all
[2:38:40] faith and virtue and knowledge members
[2:38:42] at the finishing what it is for the top
[2:38:45] of the pyramid when the pyramid comes
[2:38:47] through stuff we are at the end time the
[2:38:49] opening of the seventh seal
[2:38:51] Oh glory to God so when he made man of
[2:38:53] God he give him a domain as a zoo domain
[2:38:56] goes from sea to sea from shore to shore
[2:38:58] he had control of it and Jesus came
[2:39:00] being the one without sin he proved it
[2:39:02] when the winds blow he said peace be
[2:39:04] still it was more than talk he proved it
[2:39:07] by my position isn't that right then he
[2:39:09] said if you see this long can be moved
[2:39:11] the dock you shall have what you said so
[2:39:13] go back to Genesis now the world and
[2:39:15] nature is growing moving for what for
[2:39:18] the manifestation of the sons of God
[2:39:19] when two sons born son third son speak
[2:39:22] and their word is back I believe under I
[2:39:24] started getting bored of it now see this
[2:39:26] mountain and brother desire and so I
[2:39:28] give it to you in the name of Jesus
[2:39:30] Christ oh praise God from future whom
[2:39:33] almost done now in Ephesians 1:10 you
[2:39:36] put the null is called the fullness of
[2:39:38] time it's called not the seven days

[2:39:42] fullness of fame has come when time has
[2:39:44] been fulfilled when there is no more
[2:39:46] time then you go into eternity after the
[2:39:49] 72 Jesus over

[3:04:19] encouraging and inviting anyone who

[3:06:25] under great expectation or we have
[3:06:27] believers arriving as early as this
[3:06:29] Tuesday right ahead of us so the Train
[3:06:33] is in motion and we are under great
[3:06:36] expectation for God to do wonderful
[3:06:39] things in our midst this weekend I got a
[3:06:42] couple messages but the conscience that
[3:06:45] the meeting is already blessed the
[3:06:47] convention is already it's already it's
[3:06:50] already blessed so we under great
[3:06:52] expectation for God to do exceedingly
[3:06:54] abundantly above all that we could ask
[3:06:57] or think and I want to encourage you
[3:06:59] Church back there when you read the
[3:07:02] Bible they told them one time when they
[3:07:03] didn't have green and it for on water
[3:07:05] for a long
[3:07:06] I am the Prophet - let me go dig a
[3:07:09] valley full of ditches because the rain
[3:07:11] is going to fall and how much water you
[3:07:14] get his directories tied to hold much
[3:07:17] ditches you take and how deep how deep
[3:07:19] you take it so if you dig a little bit
[3:07:22] you're gonna get a little bit of water
[3:07:23] but if you take many ditches and you dig
[3:07:26] it deep then God has more blessing than
[3:07:29] you could even fill David speaks of his
[3:07:31] running over so don't don't let me
[3:07:33] god this weekend don't let me go to your
[3:07:36] situation what be under expectation for
[3:07:39] your family for your loved ones for the
[3:07:41] promised revival because one of these
[3:07:43] days the Prophet said we'll be standing
[3:07:44] talking sitting and the love of God will
[3:07:47] just drop down in on this and I'm under
[3:07:48] expectation that this we think it'd be
[3:07:50] that kind of meeting is that how you
[3:07:52] feel so we are dismissed
[3:07:55] [Music]
[3:08:01] in addition those who are tied to the
[3:08:04] other aspects for the convention the
