I will praise the Lord with my whole heart in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation. The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. His work is honorable and glorious, and his righteousness endureth forever. He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered. The Lord is gracious and full of compassion. He had given meat unto them that fear him. He will ever be mindful of his covenant. He had showed his people the power of his works that he may give them the heritage of the heathen. The works of his hands are verity and judgment, and all his commandments are sure. They stand fast forever and ever and are done in truth and uprightness. He sent redemption unto his people. He had commanded his covenant forever. Holy and reverent is his name. &gt;&gt; The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. A good understanding have all they that do his commandments. His praise endureth forever. &gt;&gt; God bless his word tonight. We believe it and we will pray now together.

And please pray for my nephew who was battling for his life in an ICU with sickle cell anemia from sister Elizabeth Pinkra. And maybe there's someone in the room tonight with a need. Maybe for you, maybe for a loved one. And as we approach the throne of grace tonight, knowing that God is more than able. He is still a healer. He is still a restorer. He is still able to replace the missing limbs as the prophet said. He is able to turn back what body issues you have had. High blood pressure, low blood pressure, diabetic. It doesn't matter what the situation is. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Shall we approach the throne of grace? Heavenly Father, we thank you Lord for Lord your presence that's here. Father, you have taught us through your word that Lord, where there are two or three gathered in your name, there you are in the midst of them. And we thank you for your August presence that's here. We thank you for the believers who have come from near and far father to do one thing to lift the name of Jesus higher. Father Lord in this age of darkness where gross darkness is upon the earth and upon the people Lord we are Lord commissioned by the word to arise and shine for our light is come. And father we come and unite in faith Lord for Lord this nephew of sister Pinkra Lord battling for life in the ICU knowing Lord that Lord Lazarus was dealt with and Lord there are so many situation in the scripture where you are proven yourself time and time again. We pray dear God that the angel of the Lord will visit him right now. May you touch him from the crown of his head to the souls of his feet Lord.

Lord, may you touch your people one more time. May you give us a charge in the supernatural. Lord, we were so blessed in the service this afternoon, Lord. We pray you strengthen your servant with Hashem.

We thank you for the love gifts in the body. We thank you for Brother Joash. And Lord, we thank you for what you're about to do tonight. Father, may you lift us even higher. Father, may you give your people a charge in the supernatural. Lord, we are not a normal people. Father, you called us for such a time as this. If there's a backslider in our midst, may tonight be their night. If there's someone sick, may they have a testimony that while Peter yet spake these words, healing poured out. The Holy Ghost poured out, deliverance poured out. May you touch the fathers, may you touch the mothers, may you touch the children, may you touch the visitors, may you touch every single believer in the mighty precious name of Jesus Christ. And when it is over, we'll say, "It was good to have been here." We commit this service into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. And amen. You may be seated for a few minutes. Certainly a great privilege to be here tonight in the presence of the Lord. One more time. There's no place we'd rather be than in the house of the Lord. When God's people gather themselves together and call on Jesus, something is about to happen. Hallelujah. Something is about to take place because you are here. This gospel is about you and I, friends. We are here to cause something to happen. But the Brandham said they got to do something for something to happen. It doesn't matter how you came in, how you feeling. It doesn't matter. He's the same yesterday. But the Brandham said if the people get into one minor and one accord in 5 minutes, there'll not be a feeble person in the room. May this be that kind of a service. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; So I'm just here to welcome you tonight. On behalf of our host, Pastor Bovit, I'd like to welcome one and all to the second service of the convention and to salute the portion of the body of Christ that's here. We certainly want to acknowledge all of the visitors and in particular we want to acknowledge uh some of the ministers who already announced uh in the first service. But to add to the ministers that uh came from overseas, how many appreciate our president Charles Akachchobee from Inugu, Nigeria? He's here with his wife and his daughter and his son. God bless you, brother Charles. Certainly happy to have you here with us. We want to acknowledge our precious brother, Olu Yimbo. God bless you, brother Olu. We love you. We appreciate you. And there are a number of ministers that are here from uh his church with him as well. Brother Andrew Alasa, God bless you. Brother Tuks, God bless you. Absolutely. Wonderful to have you here as well. Brother Emmy, don't hide in the front. God bless you. Certainly a great blessing and a privilege uh to be here. And we certainly want to also acknowledge uh some of the local ministers that are also here this evening with us. Uh precious brother Terren Tornel. God bless you, brother Tornel. We appreciate you. your wife for being here with us this evening. We also recognize brother Roland Samuel is here as well. God bless you, brother Roland. And his wife also, brother MelchzDC and his wife. God bless you. Welcome. We are so happy to have you here with us by the grace of God. We thank God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know somebody's hiding. &gt;&gt; Brother Harry. Brother Harry is hiding. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Brother Harry. So good to have you here with us and uh certainly want to salute our precious brother Yadel Thornill who is here on the platform with us. We're going to hear a greeting from him. He has always been a blessing. You you love and appreciate our brother Yadel Tornill. Amen. And tonight our minister tonight will be brother Stephanus Colen Brener from Germany. How many appreciate brother Stephanus a true son and servant of the Lord with a humble heart dedicated to the people of God and we are so grateful for every single one all the churches all the believers that are here. We love you. We appreciate you. We salute you. There's only one Lord. There's one faith, one baptism. We have one enemy and that enemy is going to be destroyed before we leave this place. In my heart as the children of Israel were leaving Egypt, it was not just they were not leaving one hoof behind. And I don't believe we're leaving one young person behind. We're leaving no family behind. The prophet taught us all that we love or loved us is going to be there. We are taking them. We are arresting them. And I believe God has raised up men of God like Stephanus and Yadel who will drive this message to the coming of the Lord. So as brother Yadel gets ready to come to the platform to greet before brother Stephanus preaches let's just sing that song only believe only believe all things are possible only believe [Music] all things are possible All things are possible. [Music] I'm falling. [Music] Oh, there. [Music] Oh. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How we give him praise and thanks. We thank you father presence with us. The privilege to be gathered in your house tonight. May you bless your people. Bless these few words is our prayer. In the name of our loving Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. Amen. and greetings in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; What a privilege it is to be with you all again one more time by God's grace to see brethren of like precious faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we all come for one motive is to be drawn closer to him. &gt;&gt; At the end we see no man save Jesus and him glorified amongst us. So we thank brother Tio and the headstone tabernacle on this side for allowing us the opportunity to be here. If we have our Bibles we just want to take a little portion of scripture reading before we have our seats taking from St. John chapter 8, it says verse one, then Jesus went unto the mount of olives, and early in the morning he came again to the temple, and all the people came unto him, and he sat down and taught them. And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, they said unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery in the very act. Now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned. But what sails thou? This said they tempting him that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not. So when they had continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said unto them, he that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. &gt;&gt; And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, &gt;&gt; even unto the last. And Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus lifted up himself, he saw none but the woman? And he said unto her,"Woman, where are those thine accusers? Had no man condemned thee?" She said, "No man, Lord." And Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How we love him tonight. May the Lord add his blessing to the reading of the word. We may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a lovely scene that God has given us here in the book of St. John chapter 8. And uh we know that John was the eagle. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. We had Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. These four zone you had Matthew was the lion. We had Mark was the ox. We had Luke the scribe. That was the man. &gt;&gt; And we had John was the eagle. &gt;&gt; He was the one lifted up the highest. &gt;&gt; Brother, he saw our day. &gt;&gt; He saw the bride. He saw the new Jerusalem. Hallelujah. The one that knew the love secrets of God. And here was John writing and God in ordaining the chapters John gave us a scene here that he God allow him to write &gt;&gt; and we know John was a man of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in God gave a story here through John and he say all the chapters you put in it put it in the eighth chapter. Hallelujah. Because God is specific about his numbers. &gt;&gt; God is in nature. He's in numerology &gt;&gt; brother. So God knew that eight is a number of eternity. Eight speaks of new beginnings. &gt;&gt; Eight cries you back to the first. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we saw in Genesis chapter 8, Noah, brother, eight souls were saved &gt;&gt; to make it over into the new land. &gt;&gt; And in Genesis chapter 8 is when they left that old earth and they entered into the new land, &gt;&gt; brother. And Noah offered an offering up to God. So God is in numerology. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Put this eight inside of here." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because something new starting here. &gt;&gt; It looked like a a a story that look a kind of a how adulterous woman. &gt;&gt; But it was something new that God wanted to do with her. &gt;&gt; What I could say here tonight, I want to type her brother as part of the bride. It might be hard to say but I don't believe she was a serpent seed &gt;&gt; because a serpent seed they they are not considered in redemption. &gt;&gt; Redemption is only for predestinated seed. &gt;&gt; Serpent seed cannot be forgiven. &gt;&gt; So to hear go thy way and sin no more. Esau can hear that. &gt;&gt; Judas can hear that. Hallelujah. But she could have heard that. So I want to place her among the bride. &gt;&gt; And God said, "Put it in the eighth chapter because this is a new beginning." &gt;&gt; And in this chapter, the scene starts off not down in a valley, but up on a mountaintop. &gt;&gt; On the Mount of Olives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a place to be. &gt;&gt; This is the mount from where the ascension took place. &gt;&gt; This is the mount on which brother Jesus wept. David years before wept over Jerusalem &gt;&gt; on this mount, &gt;&gt; oh Jerusalem. So that was the mama eagle longing to hover &gt;&gt; over her brood. &gt;&gt; And they would not. &gt;&gt; But here was a little eagle. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was predestinated in God's mind to respond to mama eagle. &gt;&gt; And they met up on a mountain top. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a place to be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. on this mount of olives &gt;&gt; because there are great things prophesied for here. &gt;&gt; Zachchariah shows us this mountain will cleave &gt;&gt; and that city will push up from this mountain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the bride was brought to this city to this place and Jesus taught in the temple very early in the morning. So it was a sunrise. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was a rising of the sun on that morning. And here was an adulterous woman brought into his presence. at the rising of the sun. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But what brought it there were accusers. &gt;&gt; There were people seemingly using the law of Moses. So they knew God for what he was, &gt;&gt; but they couldn't recognize him for what he is. Hallelujah. The present tense God made flesh amongst them. They couldn't have that revelation. So they said Moses in the law said that such should be stoned. &gt;&gt; Now you realize what happened. &gt;&gt; It takes two people to commit the act. &gt;&gt; But here we saw one person. &gt;&gt; You see, but that wasn't important. &gt;&gt; You were the one that was important. &gt;&gt; So he come to take one of a household, one of a family. The important thing is not how you came or who brought you but the important thing is coming. &gt;&gt; So the accusers seemingly religious people &gt;&gt; brought her into the presence of the master. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they using the Bible &gt;&gt; to bring condemnation to the bride. But &gt;&gt; Jesus had a way he handled this. &gt;&gt; They accused him. They accused her. &gt;&gt; And you know what Jesus did? &gt;&gt; He stooped down. &gt;&gt; And he started right on the ground. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When anything about the bride comes into effect, The Lord himself must come down. &gt;&gt; So you know what happened in this last age? &gt;&gt; God didn't stay above. &gt;&gt; A mighty angel descended from heaven. &gt;&gt; And we know it was none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself. He stoop down &gt;&gt; and when he stoop down the hand came into effect. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Yeah, &gt;&gt; we know the hand is the fivefold. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So there is one that points out &gt;&gt; we don't write with the little pinky. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't write with the evangelist. You have the pastor. &gt;&gt; You have the prophet. &gt;&gt; You have the apostle, the one that goes the furthest, &gt;&gt; the teacher, the other one. And then you have the evangelist, &gt;&gt; short and fiery. &gt;&gt; But God stood down and he start to use the finger. &gt;&gt; He started to write with the prophet. What an age this bride is living in &gt;&gt; things that the world never saw before. Things they never heard. &gt;&gt; God started right. The prophet started coming operation. &gt;&gt; And they continued condemning him. And brother, the scripture said he rose up. &gt;&gt; Now we know when he came down, he had a book open in his hand. &gt;&gt; He had names in his &gt;&gt; redemption was in progress. Hear what he said. &gt;&gt; He that is without sin among you &gt;&gt; cast the first [Music] &gt;&gt; the religious people of that day with the all the religious scholars and so forth. They didn't have what it took to bring condemnation. &gt;&gt; He never condemned Moses's law. But he was the God of Moses's law. So there is something called grace &gt;&gt; that supersedes the law. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before there was a law, grace was in effect. &gt;&gt; Because the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world. So there was already a supreme sacrifice on her behalf before the sin was committed. &gt;&gt; Who was first? The sinner or the savior? Amen. &gt;&gt; The savior was first. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the voice started speak now. &gt;&gt; He that is without sin. &gt;&gt; And you know what happened when these brothers recognize &gt;&gt; they can't go according to the law is something different he brought. &gt;&gt; But you see grace and love goes together. &gt;&gt; Jesus had to love this woman. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is not failure now. Because we will notice she ought to be condemned. &gt;&gt; She didn't ask for forgiveness. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But her name, it was who she was. &gt;&gt; She didn't ask for it, but he brought it to her. Adam didn't go looking for forgiveness, but the law was slain before the foundation of the world on his behalf. Love and grace are twin sisters. They go together. And it took the love of God for that woman to apply this grace to her life. &gt;&gt; And in the application of grace, there was no condemnation to her, but a word that was given to the accusers. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God dealt with the accusers &gt;&gt; in expressing grace to her. Zambulat Tobaya in the book of Daniel a lot of accusers that accuse Daniel and cause him to be dung in the lion's den. But all accusers have their part in the lake of fire &gt;&gt; because the book of revelation shows us the accuser of the brethren is cast down which accuse them before our God day and night. &gt;&gt; So God deals with all the accusations. He stoop down &gt;&gt; and he started right again. &gt;&gt; I believe God's still writing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have names that you're writing. &gt;&gt; God know how to write. You know how to spell. &gt;&gt; God wrote on mountains &gt;&gt; in our generation. &gt;&gt; If you ever doubt, &gt;&gt; come back and look at this. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God have things that are written &gt;&gt; and God have things that are written between the line &gt;&gt; that people can't see but the bride know what he said &gt;&gt; things to inspire faith in our heart &gt;&gt; to continue along this journey. So this lady when the accusers you you know allow for the scripture say &gt;&gt; they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience Paul say herein do I exercise myself that a conscience fight of offense before God and man &gt;&gt; and that's how we practice &gt;&gt; hallelujah where we could be justified in all things of our lives brother the prophet say if he could reach to that stage we have brother he say he's fit for the rapture then &gt;&gt; so the bride must reach to a place brother where we be sure of who we are and where we are standing. The scripture says they went out one by one beginning at the eldest. So the big high priest with the might on &gt;&gt; seemingly the most holy one for the edge &gt;&gt; from the elders straight down to the lowest &gt;&gt; drop the stones &gt;&gt; and the woman was left standing in the midst with Jesus on the mount. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where that city would be. So what brought you to Christ don't always stay with you. &gt;&gt; Sometimes your sickness bring you to Christ. &gt;&gt; But that that don't don't when they left if you leave the mountain top it's down you going. &gt;&gt; So all the accusers went downwards after that. But the woman was on the mount. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Pyramid mountain. The top of the pyramid brother. She was up in the capstone. She and him alone. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Woman, where are thy the accusers?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Had no man accused thee? &gt;&gt; She said, "No, Lord." &gt;&gt; He said, "Neither do I condemn thee. &gt;&gt; Go and sin no more." &gt;&gt; You see what happened there is a name change took place there. You know, it was a nature change. She was no longer a church. She was bride. She wasn't just forgiven, but she was justified. Justified is as though you never did it. And that is what it takes for her to enter into that city up on the mountain top. The prophet say your new life is in lamb's book of life. Your marriage certificate. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where the true eternal germ from the beginning take hold. You're not only forgiven but you are justified. [Music] &gt;&gt; That is what is taking place with this bride here &gt;&gt; to recognize who we are. &gt;&gt; We are part of him &gt;&gt; and one day we all will be with him on that mountaintop. &gt;&gt; All accusers will be cast out &gt;&gt; and we will spend an eternity together. &gt;&gt; May God bless you all. We love you all. [Applause] Oh, you appreciate. Hallelujah. How precious brother Yana Hill. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What a greeting. Hallelujah. What a word in due season.

Now I want to come on in the mighty God unwave before us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There was a wave chief that preached this message and he not only preached this message but he lifted out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And one day he said come to the mighty the unveiling of the mighty God unveile it. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you he was a wave chief. &gt;&gt; That means there's others coming behind &gt;&gt; that are going to lift this message and there will be one more right one more availing of almighty God in your life in this message. Brother Prenham says, "I'm telling you when you break that traditional barriers that Jesus is the way back and he isn't now." When you find he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, he says there's no limit to what God could do right here in his convention. And I want to sit in a meeting. I want to rejoice in a meeting where there's no limit what God will do in a convention like this. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And show this world what they need. Not a world far off, but a world revival that will be filled and baptized with the presence of the living God and more faith in whailing himself into human flesh. &gt;&gt; What is going on, brother Stephanus in this meeting? God is pouring down. Praise the Lord. And maybe someone here, maybe someone here where God will unveil it. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. He has broken every barrier, every veil, every veil. Nothing could hide his presence. &gt;&gt; He says when people gets hungry in their heart. &gt;&gt; There's a whale ready to be broke. &gt;&gt; Are you hungry in your heart? &gt;&gt; Then there's a whale ready to be broke. You can't just depend on that. Rent everywhere by his great Holy Spirit tonight. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let us go to the scripture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I want to read from Colossians 1:27 from Romans 8 18 and 19. Ephesians 3:8 and John 17:52- 24. [Music] Let's just pray before we approach the word of God. Dear heavenly father, Lord God, as we approach your sacred word, Lord, it's anointed, Father. Lord, it's open. It's revealed to us, Father, Lord. But Lord, may you anoint it that it becomes the living word in our lives, Father. Lord God, may you reveal to everyone what these scriptures means to them personally, Father. Not to a group, Father. Not to the church in in general, Father, but to each one of us individual. May you bless your word as we read it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. Colossians 1:27. To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery &gt;&gt; among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So Christ is in you &gt;&gt; and his mystery hidden to the world &gt;&gt; comes with a glory. Hallelujah. And the riches is the fullness of this glory will be made known which means made visible in your life. &gt;&gt; It will be unveiled one day. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The riches of this glory. Romans 8:18. For I reckon that the suffering of these present times are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us. &gt;&gt; So there's a glory to be revealed in you &gt;&gt; and it's not comparable to all the sufferings you have gone through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. for the earnest expectation of the creator wait for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; So there's a glory that is going to be revealed in you. Praise the Lord. And that glory is the same glory that you had with him before the foundation of the world. And when this is revealed in you, it will become a manifestation. And all creatures are waiting for his glory to be revealed and manifested. Ephesians 3:8 and it talks about how this glory will be unveiled. Amen. in Ephesians 3 and Paul speaking about it and he says personally he says unto me this personal testimony who I am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ now watch and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery Praise the Lord. So Paul says there's a fellowship of the mystery and all men will see what what a fellowship of the mystery will produce. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; John 17:E5. And now Jesus is praying. He says, "Oh now, oh father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was." &gt;&gt; Verse 22, "And the glory which thou has given me, I have given them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That they may be one even as we are one. In verse 24, Father, I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thy lovest before the foundation of the world. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, I want to speak tonight about the glory that you had with him. restored back &gt;&gt; by the true fellowship. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because Paul is speaking about a fellowship with the mystery. Praise the Lord. And the mystery is Christ. The mystery, Christ in you, the hope of glory, the mystery that has been hidden before all ages. But this mystery has to be revealed. Praise the Lord. And it comes by a fellowship with this mystery first on the inside then to a manifestation on the outside. And this mystery is coming with a glory. And this glory is going to be the same glory that you had with him before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; My inspiration Christ in you the hope of glory. Amen. Let's get started. Hallelujah. What was before the beginning? Before the beginning, you had fellowship with God. It started with fellowship. You had fellowship in the mind of God. You were then an attribute with God. Praise the Lord. And you came to be a son and a daughter of God. And Joe picked it up and says, "Where was thou?" When the sons and daughters of God shouted for joy, you were there. I was there. And we had fellowship with God Almighty. Praise the Lord. Before the foundation of the world. So this was before the beginning. Now what was in the beginning is it was Adam and Eve. They had fellowship with Jehovah God. Praise the Lord. He was her father. He was their mother. He was all to them. And they had fellowship with him. And today we find out, Amen. By the grace of God, we will find out that your fellowship will determine your future. And I want to speak about it because the fellowship that you have will determine your future. &gt;&gt; If you take one thing is what fellowship do you have? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And by the grace of God, I want to speak it to prove to check yourself. What fellowship do you have in your life? Because your fellowship will determine your future. And by the grace of God, I want to lay it out. Praise the Lord. Amen. in heaven. Twothirds of the angel they they stopped the fellowship with the word of God and it determined their future. Praise the Lord. They took side Amen with the devil. They took side with Satan and it determined their fellowship. They took it determined their future. Their future they were cast out on this earth. But one day they're going to be destroyed. Praise the Lord. Their fellowship determined the future. Hallelujah. But there's one third that stood with Michael. One third that said, "No, I cannot leave it. Whatever you say, where should I go? Where should I go?" You have words of eternal life. The disciples had fellowship and they stayed in a fellowship. And one day the fellowship turned into a manifestation on the day of Beccent and it determined their future. Their fellowship they had determined their future. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, let's go back in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve had fellowship with God. Brother Brandham in the voice of God in his last days. He said, "Adam heard his voice in the cool of the evening." Amen. I pray you hear his voice. Brother Brandham prays while the message go. He says, "Father, while I preach, may the still small voice speak to them and have fellowship. Praise the Lord. May God grant it tonight in the cool of the evening. Praise the Lord. And he said, Adam heard his voice and he had fellowship with him and there was no condemnation to Adam. No condemnation when you have fellowship with Christ. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Now in one, Brother Bram says, "Now when Adam and Eve listened to the lie of the devil, the holy image of God left them. &gt;&gt; They went out with the fellowship of the word. They started to have fellowship with a lie and this actually broke their fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; So we are coming back to the word. The faith is restored. The world is revealed. The word is revealed. And we are coming back to real fellowship. I tell you this word brings us back to real fellowship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now when Adam and Eve listened to the lie of the devil, the holy image of God left them. Their fellowship was broken with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, not only their fellowship with God was break was broken, Brother Brandham says, he continues, he says, as soon as their fellowship was broke between God and them, he says, then their fellowship between each other was broken. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So your def fellowship will determine your future. &gt;&gt; And God said I will restore. &gt;&gt; He said I will restore divine fellowship. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He said there going to be an Eden condition where we have fellowship with Christ. &gt;&gt; And that's why I say first we have divine fellowship with him and then we have fellowship one with another. Praise the Lord because it will be a restoration of the fellowship with Christ Jesus the word. Praise the Lord. And then we will have fellowship one with another. Praise the Lord. Talking about an Eden. Talking about a love of God. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. So God created man in the beginning but man lost fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; I want to go in the message the basis of fellowship. Now we find out, but now we find out that what makes men longing to fellowship. Now the fellowship was lost. &gt;&gt; The fellowship with God was lost. &gt;&gt; And he said we find out that what makes man to long to fellowship &gt;&gt; is because that he had once had fellowship &gt;&gt; and his fellowship was with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Your fellowship was with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's a longing inside for something to have fellowship back with God. &gt;&gt; There's somewhere he's trying to find his way back &gt;&gt; because his origin was to fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; Brother Benam since two in 6,000 years after he lost his fellowship with God, he became a wanderer. Had to shift for himself. God taken care of him before then, but now he finds he has to man finds out he has to shift for himself and it's a pretty hard thing to do. &gt;&gt; And we all experience that. It's a pretty hard thing to do without him. Praise the Lord. So he doesn't have a loving father man to watch over him and to protect him and to guide him and to direct him and to feed him and to close him and to care for him like he did. So instead of coming back, he tries to fight his own way. &gt;&gt; Praise the all the world. Praise the Lord. They are trying to find their own way instead of coming back to him. Praise the Lord. To a true fellowship. Hallelujah. Amen. So the own way is not working. Look at Cain. Look at K Cain tried to do it by his own way, but he couldn't enter into the fellowship. Amen. Hallelujah. He couldn't just do it by himself. Praise the Lord. But a true revelation with Abel brought back fellowship. Amen. Hallelujah. So question, what brought back the what brings back the fellowship? Hallelujah. Let's go. Praise the Lord. Amen. What brings back the fellowship? No intellect will bring you in fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said sin came by civilation. So your intellect will never get you back in fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; So your thinking mental conception time is over. Praise the Lord. Because it can never bring you back in fellowship. No man can bring you back in fellowship. No idea can bring you back in fellowship. No Greek can bring you back in fellowship. Nothing can bring you in fellowship that is coming back in fellowship. No idea can bring you back in fellowship. No greed can bring you back in fellowship. Nothing can bring you in fellowship that is coming by man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Brother Brham says, brother Brennham continues. He says you'll never be able to done to to denominate people to fellowship. All right. &gt;&gt; So no denomination will you bring you back in fellowship maturity group God in a fellowship but God will take individuals. &gt;&gt; He will pick up on here. &gt;&gt; He will pick up on here. He will pick up on here. He will say this is my chosen one. I have predestinated him and I long to have fellowship with him and he will reveal himself to him. Praise to whoever he wants to, he will do it. But it will be the grace of God coming to your way. Praise the Lord. Giving you something. Hallelujah. A longing in your heart to say, I want to go back to my father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you will never be able to denominate people to fellowship. It just won't work. It's not God's program. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. So the denomination will not bring you your intellectual will not bring you. Brother Brandon says justification will not bring you in fellowship. &gt;&gt; He says now hearing the word and being just as religious as you want to be. Still that don't put us in fellowship. But there's a work of justification. But justification just doesn't bring you back in fellowship. Brother Brennan says, he continues, "Sanctification will not bring you in fellowship. Your sanctification still not in fellowship. Still didn't do it." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But there's more to come that brings you back in fellowship. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In the message, brother Benim continues, "But when the true blood came, the blood of Jesus Christ, God's son." Now, what is the blood? The blood is the life. It's not the literal blood of Jesus Christ, but the life that was in the blood. When this comes, the Holy Spirit in the blood of Jesus Christ, when he comes, hallelujah, praise the Lord, he broke down the middle part of the middle wall of partition. Praise the Lord. So, something has to be broke to bring you back in fellowship. And it's the blood of Jesus Christ, the life of Jesus Christ, the spirit of Jesus Christ. It will break down every partition wall that has separate you from the fellowship of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Benham, he tore down the curtain from the top to the bottom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. He turned it down. And now the believer whosoever will let him come into the shakina glory. Praise the Lord. So true fellowship you will only find in the shikina glory in the same glory that you had with him before the foundation. And God made a way by his blood by his spirit to bring you back into shina glory. So you have the same glory that you had with him before the foundation of the world. The same fellowship you had with him before the foundation of the world. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Brother Branham, and a man through justification, believing the word, sanctification, cleaning from his sin, he is subject to enter into the Pentecostal chakina. Praise the Lord. So justification, sanctification makes you subject to enter into the Pentecostal china. Praise the Lord. And how do you enter in? By one spirit. We are all baptized into one body. In this body. Hallelujah. Is his glory. In this body is his power. In this body is life. Praise the Lord. And by one spirit, you are baptized into this body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now maybe as a little help an example of the royal priesthood of the high priest in continues brother Brenamin's message he speaks about a high priest. He said then now then once a year the high priest had to be dressed in a certain way. &gt;&gt; He had to be anointed in a certain way. &gt;&gt; He had to have a certain ma made clothes. &gt;&gt; And on the end of his garment he had a bell and a prom a a a pom grenade. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he had to walk a certain way to make that play. And you have to work to walk a certain way. You have to be dressed in a certain way. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. For real fellowship with God, brother Pam. And he had to walk a certain way to make that play. &gt;&gt; How did he walked? Holy, &gt;&gt; holy, &gt;&gt; holy unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Holy, holy unto the Lord. He was sanctified. He said they're holy, holy unto him. Hallelujah. What was he doing? He's approaching the shikina glory. Brother Bram says the real fellowship. That's why I say a true fellowship. A real fellowship in Shikina glory. Praise the Lord. There's where you find the real the real fellowship. Praise the Lord. But now watch what has what he had to be dressed. Brother Brandham said, "Up a certain way." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it reminds me, Joseph was dressed by his father in a certain way. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. This robe had seven colors. It was a certain way. He had to be dressed. And the bride of Jesus Christ has to be dressed in a certain way with a certain role. Praise the Lord. To enter into Shakina glory. It's a certain rope, a certain made close. Praise the Lord. Amen. And a priest was anointed in a certain way. And there's only one true anointing we know. It's by the Holy Spirit. Praise the Lord. And he had to walk in a certain way, worshiping holy, holy unto the Lord. Now, Brother Brandham says, now you see, he said he had to make a noise. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In this convention, you have to make a certain noise. &gt;&gt; If you want to walk like the high priest walking into Shakina glory, you have to walk a certain way. You have to make some noise. Praise the Lord. Before you enter into Shakina glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Bren says, "I tell you, when the church lets off its noise, there's something happens &gt;&gt; right as sure as the world. Cuz everywhere the Shikina glories, there's a noise." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When you come in this fellowship with Shikina glory, there's going to be a noise. There's going to be a shouting. There's going to be a worship. Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. You cannot stop praise the Lord. But you start. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Father. I saw your grace upon my life. I cannot do else than to cry out to you. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, tonight I hear the noise of some people. They are ready to break through their inner whale. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Now brother Brandham we know that brother Brandham says then praise the Lord in Jesus day before Jesus day man to enter behind the inner whale was this. &gt;&gt; But he said now not to enter into this fellowship is this. &gt;&gt; So if you want to make it in the rapture you better get ready and start to enter into this kind of glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God made a provided way where you can enter in, how you can enter in. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is happening in a shakina glory? Brother Brandham, the basis of fellowship. He said that stuff from Aaron that was dead. Nothing but an old stick. It had to come to life. It bloomed and it blossom on it laying in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You take a old stick, &gt;&gt; a dead stick. &gt;&gt; But there's a chain of God in that stick. &gt;&gt; That stick was once a word of God made manifest &gt;&gt; because God spoke, "Let there be trees." &gt;&gt; And there was a cheat of God for life. &gt;&gt; But when this stick came into the presence of God, that stick couldn't help anything else than to bring forth life. &gt;&gt; That stick had to blossom out. That thing has to bring forth fruit in the presence of God. Praise the Lord. Brother Brandham says when divine fellowship is restored, he says the fruit is ready to come forth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You are looking for a miracle. You're looking for deliverance. You're looking for anything. Come into the presence of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let me go deeper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Luke 17:E 20, &gt;&gt; Jesus, praise the Lord, he was asked a question before. He said, "When is the kingdom of God coming? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in this kingdom is a shina glory. He says, "When is this kingdom coming? When is this glory coming? When will it be revealed?" Praise the Lord. Brother Jesus turned around and he says, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When this starts in your life, your wife might not see it. Your son might not see, your church might not see, but something is going on. Jesus said, "Behold, the kingdom of God is within you." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But something is going on on the inside. Praise the Lord. Something is started in the inside. The devil cannot stop it. The accuser cannot stop it. But something is going on on the inside. But one day, what is on the inside will come out to the outside. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. This kingdom is not coming. But Jesus said this kingdom is in you. How can it be be in you? By predestination. &gt;&gt; This kingdom is in you. Hallelujah. But it will be manifested one day. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let us go on. 2 Corinthians 3. But even unto this day when Moses is read, the whale is upon their heart. &gt;&gt; So Jesus was speaking to the Pharisees, he said, "In your heart, there's a whale." Amen. There's a whale that is separating you to see the truth. &gt;&gt; It's separating you. You cannot see. Praise the Lord. The whale is upon their heart. So not, he's not speaking about a whale in the temple, but he says now is a whale in your heart. It says, "Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the whale shall be taken away." When it's turned to the Lord, now what did Peter said? He said, "Repent." He said, "Return, be repent and baptize, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." If you turn to the Lord, the the whale on your heart will be rent away. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now the Lord, praise the Lord, the Lord is that spirit. And where the spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty. So Jesus was speaking, when that whale is rent in your life, the spirit of God has a liberty. We were singing about the river that is flowing freely. Praise the Lord. But when this whale is ran, you come back in fellowship and that river starts to flow from your heart from Shakina glory from the altars of your heart it will flow out. It will flow out to others. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And then Jesus continues, but we all Hello. Paul continues, "But we all with open face now beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the image from glory to glory even as the spirit as by the spirit of the Lord." So you're going to be changed from one glory. There's a glory along with justification, a glory with sanctification. But there's another greater glory coming by the baptism of go of of by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And the baptism of the Holy Ghost will rent down the whale. The blood of Jesus Christ in your life will rent down every way for the shakina glory itself. The Holy Ghost itself. Praise the Lord. Here is my spirit flowing freely. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. So I believe Hallelujah. I believe I believe tonight there's a people in the land that know their God. Where the whale is ramp tonight where the spirit of God can flow freely. Shina glory in the sockets of your heart radiating out the love of God. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. A people in the land that know their God, they will do great exploits because they have fellowship with God himself. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. So, let me say this. The time is at hand that God will make known the riches of this mystery. Christ in you, the hope of glory. This time is here. &gt;&gt; The this kingdom &gt;&gt; will come in a power. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; This kingdom will come in power. Praise the Lord. The king of kings will sit on the throne. The presence of God will be all over this place. Hallelujah. You walk in a room, Shakina glory is going with you. Brother Brham had it when he was walking in the tent. Praise the Lord. Shakina glory was going with him. Paul had it. Shakina glory was with him. He had true fellowship with almighty God. The sick got healed in his shadow. The lame got to walk. The blind got to see. Praise the Lord. And he came by true fellowship with God Almighty again. Fellowship. Praise the Lord. In his people. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But let me lay it out. Praise the Lord. Paul speaks in Ephesians 3. He says, "And I preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ. &gt;&gt; And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery." &gt;&gt; Paul &gt;&gt; had fellowship with the mystery &gt;&gt; because he broke through. &gt;&gt; He knew &gt;&gt; the shikina glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew the liberty of the spirit. &gt;&gt; The whale was rent for Paul. &gt;&gt; He had this fellowship. &gt;&gt; But he said that all men will see. Then it will be made known now what a fellowship of the mystery produces. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If we have fellowship with the mystery, &gt;&gt; all men will know that you had fellowship with the mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me make it plain. &gt;&gt; Noah had fellowship &gt;&gt; with the mystery of his day. &gt;&gt; The word of God came to him &gt;&gt; and he had fellowship with the mystery. &gt;&gt; Moses, he had fellowship &gt;&gt; with the mystery of his day. &gt;&gt; Pharaoh didn't know nothing about it. &gt;&gt; Pharaoh couldn't stop little Moses. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he had a mother that teach him the mystery about his life. &gt;&gt; And he has started to have fellowship with the mystery. Joshua had fellowship with the mystery of his day. &gt;&gt; Paul had fellowship with the mystery of his day. &gt;&gt; William Brham had fellowship with the mystery of his day. &gt;&gt; Until when? Until the mystery the fellowship of the mystery was made known. Noah, and I want to make it plain. Noah said, "It will rain." &gt;&gt; Why did he said it? How could he stand 120 years and say, "It will rain. It will rain. It will rain." Because he had fellowship with that mystery. He may God may turn the wife around, and children around. He didn't take care because he had fellowship with the mystery. It will rain. But one day the fellowship business mystery had to turn into a manifestation be made known &gt;&gt; that all men shall see that he had fellowship with the mystery. The manifestation is the vindication of the fellowship. &gt;&gt; And I thank God that Noah took fellowship with that mystery in heaven. I want to speak with him about it. How did you hold on? He will say, I had fellowship with the mystery. It couldn't be stopped. Amen. Brother Pam says Joshua and Caleb had it in their heart. Praise the Lord. They had the promise in their heart that this land belongs to them. So they started to have fellowship with this mystery and it was so strong upon Caleb that he said this mountain is my mountain. This was coming with fellowship with the promise. So he continued, praise the Lord. He didn't care if it's 10 years in the desert. He continued to have fellowship with the mystery. 20 years he continued fellowship with the mystery. 30 years he didn't stop at fellowship with the mystery. But in the 40s years he something was pushing him out. He said, "Therefore, give me this mountain. I had fellowship 40 years with this mystery, but now the time has come for my mountain. Therefore, forgive me. I want to see a manifestation of the mystery of the fellowship I had with him. Praise the Lord. There was a mystery laying in Moses and Moses tried by his own strength to fulfill that mystery. But you cannot produce it by your own self because brother Brandham said it's not by intellect. It's not by forming a group. It's not by this. It's not by this but by my spirit says the Lord. Praise the Lord. 40 years. 40 years he was running away from the presence of God. 40 years he was in the wilderness. But the mystery stayed with him. But one day a burning bush experience. Praise the Lord. The Holy Spirit came down upon him. Praise the Lord. He said come. Come to the presence of God. Come to the shina glory. There's a shikina glory tonight in the burning bush. Praise the Lord. It is here tonight. But he said, "Come, come to the burning bush in his presence." That mystery started to operate. And now it was ready in the burning bush. The whale was rent for him. He understood that I, Lord God, will deliver my people. Moses, you don't have to do it, but I will do it. I'm going to use you. Praise the Lord. And the fellowship with the mystery started into a manifestation. Pharaoh couldn't hold him. No greed could hold him. Nothing could hold him. But now the fellowship by the spirit. Hallelujah. Produced a manifestation and it came to pass. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Brother Brandham at fellowship is that mystery. He was reading Malachi 4 and something was striking his heart. He says there's going to be an Elijah before that great and dreadful day. There's going be to be an Elijah. But one day he was baptizing one person and a voice came out to heaven from heaven and said your message will forun the second coming of Christ. Praise the Lord. And he started to have fellowship. He didn't put it aside, but he started to have fellowship with what the angel with what the voice said and he started to fellowship and he found where it's written &gt;&gt; and God manifested it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. There's a bride here in Trinidad. There's a bride all over the world that is having fellowship because the seed is in the bound. Brother Brandham says the word is in the bride. But what it needs to have fellowship with that word. You can hear it a 40 years. You can hear it at 20 years. But once you get in fellowship with that mystery, praise the Lord. It will start. It will bring the revival. It will bring, hallelujah, the manifestation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What seed is in the power? A seed of a right conduct as a Christian. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There's a seed of behavior in this message for a Christian. Hallelujah. There's a seat of the life of Christ in the bride because brother Brandon preached a message called the token. So there's a life seed in you. Praise the Lord. But this life seed has to come into manifestation and it will come by fellowship with that mystery. Praise the Lord. How can Christ live in me? How can Christ live in you? Let me challenge you. How is Christ living in you? You only start. Brother Bram says just get in the spirit. Just get started. You say, "Lord Jesus, Christ in me, the hope of glory." But Lord Jesus, you said, "This will come alive. This will start to work in me. Let charity, let the love of God, let faith, let virtue, let knowledge, let temperance work in me. Father, build me up. Oh Lord, what is that?" It's a prayer to have fellowship. Build me up, Lord. Build me up into that stature. And you start to have fellowship. And one day God can come down and well and bring it to a manifestation &gt;&gt; in this message. &gt;&gt; There's seats of adoption of a power of authority that is resting upon you. Praise the Lord. But we are looking forward for the full power of God to bring it into a manifestation. Hallelujah. Seeds of perfections. Hallelujah. Many seeds have been sold, but we are waiting for the manifestation. It's already manifesting time. We are singing this song. It's manifesting time. What is it? Hallelujah. You have fellowship with that mystery and Satan cannot stop it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not a fellowship &gt;&gt; on the outside, &gt;&gt; but the fellowship you have on the inside &gt;&gt; that determines your future. [Music] &gt;&gt; David said Psalm 1, he said, "Blessed is the man." &gt;&gt; Let me say it different. Blessed is the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; That walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, &gt;&gt; nor standeth in the way of sinner, &gt;&gt; nor sitth in the seat of the scornful, &gt;&gt; but her delight, her delight &gt;&gt; is in the law of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the law of the Lord is this. &gt;&gt; The law of the Lord is this. &gt;&gt; But her delight is in the law of the Lord. and in his law does he meditate day and night. So David knew the secret place in meditation in fellowship with the word &gt;&gt; and it was his experience &gt;&gt; and he said blessed is the man &gt;&gt; that mediates day and night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is following &gt;&gt; after mediation in your heart &gt;&gt; day and night &gt;&gt; he shall be &gt;&gt; like a tree planted &gt;&gt; by the rivers of living water. &gt;&gt; What is David saying? Here is my spirit flowing freely. &gt;&gt; There's no more whale that can separate you from the operating of the Holy Spirit. He shall be there will be a manifestation &gt;&gt; of another tree of life. &gt;&gt; And I heard a message. There's going to be a restoration of a bride tree. And this bright tree will be restored once again by a true fellowship in your heart. &gt;&gt; And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that brings forth his fruit in his seasons. &gt;&gt; And his leaves shall not wither. and whatsoever he does. &gt;&gt; Shall prosper. &gt;&gt; Brother Prenham says there's going to be a bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; She will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Whatever she said, it will prosper. &gt;&gt; She will have dust, says the Lord, or she will be quiet, &gt;&gt; but it will be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it will become it will come &gt;&gt; by the fellowship &gt;&gt; with the mystery &gt;&gt; David continues the ungodly are not so &gt;&gt; they don't have fellowship &gt;&gt; with a promise &gt;&gt; but are like the chuff which the wind drive away &gt;&gt; but God said I will restore &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; abiding fellowship with his word &gt;&gt; and Jesus said if you abide in me &gt;&gt; and my words abide in you &gt;&gt; what is he speaking he's speaking about a fellowship he said there will be someone somewhere somehow he will start to come in fellowship with me and he will not go in and out but he will be abiding fellowship with me the word praise the lord hallelujah and he said he will be this fellowship will be so intense I will be in him my words will be in him. So whatever then from this fellowship he will speak of it will happen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you fellowship with this mystery, &gt;&gt; brother Brenam says no one can persuade you different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because something has happened on the inside. There's no more whale. &gt;&gt; The whale is rent. The glory of God came down into your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me take that. Amen. His presence is here. &gt;&gt; But let me just strive that when Joshua was there, praise the Lord. God spoke to him. This book of law shall not depart out of thy mouths, &gt;&gt; but thou shalt meditate therein day &gt;&gt; and night. &gt;&gt; Lord, let me meditate. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; More day and night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That thou must observe to do according to all that is written therein. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he had praise the Lord, this God continued and he says, "For then &gt;&gt; thou shalt make thy way prospers." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing shall stand before you. &gt;&gt; And then thou shalt have good &gt;&gt; success. &gt;&gt; Joshua, if you have fellowship with this word, &gt;&gt; take the law of Moses. Take the law of God. Have fellowship and nothing will stand before you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Joshua did so and a manifestation came forth. Jericho's wall failed. &gt;&gt; It could not stand before that. &gt;&gt; But in the midst of the congregation, there was one man. &gt;&gt; And this man called Akan. And Akan. Now watch. I just want to lay it out. Ahan. You say Akan. Achen. Thank you. Achen, he saw the miracles that was done among the people. &gt;&gt; Achen was walking through dry sea. &gt;&gt; Achen saw the cloud of glory. &gt;&gt; Achen saw the mana from heaven. &gt;&gt; Achen was eating the mana from heaven. &gt;&gt; Achen saw the rock beneath the rock. He saw the living waters flowing. &gt;&gt; Achen felt the anointing of God. &gt;&gt; Achen saw the miracles. There was no sick among two million people. &gt;&gt; Achen saw the power of God. &gt;&gt; Achen saw it all. Praise the Lord. Achen might have seen a vindicated prophet for his day. &gt;&gt; Achen saw it all. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But Achen, he was looking to the riches of Jericho. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now watch out. In his heart, he started to desire the items of Jericho. &gt;&gt; So Achen started to shift from the fellowship of the promise for the complete country, for the complete land to be theirs. Achen started to shift his fellowship in his heart and he turned to the riches of the world to the riches of Jericho and he started to have fellowship with his desires for the riches of Jericho. [Applause] And in shifting his desire, in shifting his dis his his fellowship, he started to become disobedient &gt;&gt; to the word of God. &gt;&gt; What was the result? &gt;&gt; His inside fellowship that he had &gt;&gt; started to come to a manifestation. Israel lost the battle. &gt;&gt; Not only here, but all Israel lost the battle. &gt;&gt; 36 Israel's lost their lives. &gt;&gt; And he, his family, and his house was destroyed. &gt;&gt; Blooded out &gt;&gt; because God is looking on the heart &gt;&gt; of one single Israel out of two million. one had had changed his fellowship with the promise for Israel and he was blotted out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he shifted his fellowship. &gt;&gt; Balam. &gt;&gt; Balam. &gt;&gt; He had a wrong fellowship. &gt;&gt; Not on the outside, but on the inside. First, &gt;&gt; he had a desire of influence. &gt;&gt; He had a desire of money. and his desire, his fellowship, what he had on the inside. One day it became a manifestation. &gt;&gt; And he was killed by the Israelites along with the Medidianite kings. &gt;&gt; Let me take another examples. Judas &gt;&gt; his chariot is &gt;&gt; he was walking with Jesus &gt;&gt; and Jesus was speaking in parables &gt;&gt; then he was revealing it to his disciples &gt;&gt; but something on the inside of Judah's &gt;&gt; exeriot he didn't started to have fellowship with this mystery that was expressed to him &gt;&gt; but he kept on a fellowship with a hidden mystery that he had in his heart. &gt;&gt; He had a desire for the lust of the money &gt;&gt; that he kept a little desire in his heart for money. He was seeking for a natural kingdom to come in power. &gt;&gt; And he kept that secret all over the time he was with Jesus. &gt;&gt; And he kept the fellowship. And that fellowship on the inside of his heart was so strong. &gt;&gt; It became so strong he couldn't push it back. &gt;&gt; But one day he betrayed Jesus Christ. [Applause] And when he recognized it, &gt;&gt; it was too late. &gt;&gt; The rich young ruler. &gt;&gt; He kept all the commandments. &gt;&gt; He came in church &gt;&gt; and if you wanted to point to one in a church, you would have pointed to him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Look how he walks. &gt;&gt; He never missed one commandment. He's perfect on the spot to every commandment that is given by God. &gt;&gt; Everything you could see him, you could put no finger to him. &gt;&gt; There was no condemnation in the church towards him. &gt;&gt; He said, "I have all done this." What a prophet said. &gt;&gt; And Jesus looked deeper, &gt;&gt; more deeper, &gt;&gt; more deeper. He was looking through the flesh. He was looking to his spirit. But he came to his heart. He came to his soul. And he said, "One thing lack." He said, "Give up all your money and give it to the poor." Because Jesus saw that a rich young ruler still had fellowship with something else in his heart. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus was be standing before him. And the word is trying to correct the error. &gt;&gt; Maybe tonight. &gt;&gt; The word is trying to correct an error in your life. &gt;&gt; The rich Rangulo didn't want to give up the fellowship &gt;&gt; he had with the money &gt;&gt; and he turned around. This fellowship in his heart was more important to him than the fellowship in Shikina glory abiding with Jesus Christ. He said come follow me. &gt;&gt; What does it mean? Come stay with me. The presence of God is with me. The stay within his presence. He will do everything that is wrong. He will do it right. But he just couldn't let go. &gt;&gt; He kept on holding with the mystery that he had in his heart. So the fellowship in his heart determined his future. &gt;&gt; Let me go through it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let me take another example. &gt;&gt; There was a son and he was the son of a rich man. &gt;&gt; Very rich man. And all the land that you could see belonged to him. All the treasures in this land belonged to him. He had cattle like no one else had cuddles. He had servant like no one else had ser had had servants. He had all the riches there was in this land. And he had two boys. &gt;&gt; But one boy started to desire &gt;&gt; the prosperity of his father. [Music] He started to have a desire and in his heart you see before you speak something you have it in your heart. &gt;&gt; So he had something in his heart. He saw the riches &gt;&gt; and he wanted to have it before it's time. &gt;&gt; So he went went to his father and he said give me my inheritance &gt;&gt; before the time. &gt;&gt; And he speak. Why did he said it? because he was thinking in his heart. &gt;&gt; He was meditating on his heart about the riches that his father had. &gt;&gt; But little did he take care about a fellowship his father had in his heart. &gt;&gt; But he missed the point. &gt;&gt; So he started to have fellowship and he said, "What can I do with this riches?" And he started to have fellowship with this with this riches with this inheritance. And he went to his father and he said, "Give me my inheritance." &gt;&gt; And the father didn't said, "I don't give it to you." But the father said, "Okay, you have it here, &gt;&gt; but you're going to learn a hard lesson." &gt;&gt; He had fellowship. &gt;&gt; Now, the fellowship in his heart became a manifestation &gt;&gt; and the father gave it to him &gt;&gt; and he said, "Now I now it all belongs to me. Whatever was for me is in store. it's now mine. And he went his way &gt;&gt; and a manifestation of the desire in his heart of the fellowship he had in his heart started to manifest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it became lesser and lesser &gt;&gt; and lesser &gt;&gt; and lesser. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Until all the inheritance, all that his desire was no more. verse. &gt;&gt; He found himself with a pig. &gt;&gt; And he had only one desire. He said, "If I could eat, what a pig eat." &gt;&gt; Speak about a hungry soul that lost fellowship with the true mystery. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But one day the mercy of God dropped down. &gt;&gt; And he, brother Bam says, he came to himself. He said, "I had fellowship with my father." &gt;&gt; And there was another mystery with my father. And there was a desire in his heart for another fellowship. The money was not enough. The world was not enough. Nothing was enough for him anymore. But he said, "Let me go to the father's house. And if I only can be a servant. If I only can come near to the presence of God. If I only can come near to Shakina glory. If I only can labor in shakina glory. I know all is going to be well. But let me just be near in the shina glory. I don't care what is it. But father just let me serve you. &gt;&gt; And he turned around. He made his steps. He walked to his father. Praise the Lord. And his father was waiting for him because his father had a desire in his heart for fellowship. And he knew one day he will come back again because he know his son was a true seed of God. Praise the Lord. And this seed, brother Prelim said, it might be concrete over the sea. It might be down in the earth. It might be hidden somewhere. But one day when the light will struck the sea, praise the Lord, nothing can stop the sea to come forth. Why? Why? Because the prodical son in a pig's stand, he started to change his fellowship. He said, "I know where I come from. I know my father. I know where my destin I know my hope." He says, "I want to be back there in fellowship." And he drove him back into the father's hand. Praise the Lord. Speaking about a restoration. Speaking about something in his heart that has changed. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He started to meditate about his father's home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he went into action. &gt;&gt; Let me give another example. Samson. &gt;&gt; There was a promise hanging over Samson. &gt;&gt; But Samson, he had a gift of God. &gt;&gt; But in his heart, &gt;&gt; he had lust for the liar. &gt;&gt; He was laying in the night and he was meditating about the liar. He had fellowship in his thought first before he had fellowship in a manifestation with the liar. &gt;&gt; His fellowship in his heart became a manifestation. &gt;&gt; And God let it happen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Samson, &gt;&gt; I'm going to teach you a lesson. &gt;&gt; I'm going to teach you a lesson. A true fellowship with the divine promise for your life &gt;&gt; will bring something to pass. A supernatural happening will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; And in a prison, his eyes blotted out. &gt;&gt; He couldn't see. &gt;&gt; You speak about a man that was broken &gt;&gt; in a prison door behind prison doors. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People were mocking him. Yes, &gt;&gt; people were laughing him. &gt;&gt; Not only were laughing them on him, but they were laughing about Jehovah, God. &gt;&gt; Because in him they saw the power of Jehovah &gt;&gt; and they said, "We defeated it. It is finished. We have the victory." &gt;&gt; But the promise stayed with Samson. But somewhere in a deep dark prison, &gt;&gt; not seeing anything, &gt;&gt; Samson started to meditate on the promise. &gt;&gt; He felt something on the backside of his hair. &gt;&gt; He said, "There is a promise still coming out." &gt;&gt; And he started to meditate. &gt;&gt; He started again to have fellowship &gt;&gt; with the promise over his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I said, "Lord God, if it's possible, Lord, let me at one more time fellowship with the mystery over my life." And he said one day, he said, "Lord God, once more, Lord, I meditated on your Lord. I meditate on your promise. But today, Lord, let it be, let it be a manifestation of the true fellowship with the divine promise for my life. And he called the young lad and he said, "Lead me to the pillar. I feel the locks have grown out. I feel it's back again. I have found a true fellowship with my personal promise." And he said he was strong. He said, "Lead me to that pillar." Praise the Lord. And it should be power between the pillars. And he said, "Let thy praise the Lord." And he started to push. He started to push once more, Lord. Praise the Lord. Once more, Lord, let this promise, let the fellowship that I had with this promise, let it come to a manifestation. And he started to push, push, push, push. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And the pillars started to give up. They said, "There's a stronger force in Samson. Praise the Lord. The pillar looked to Samson. The pillar acknowledged a mystery in Samson. They acknowledge a power of God in Samson. And it had to push back. They had to pull back. And they pulled back. Praise the Lord. Until the building fell down. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me say it in a different way. &gt;&gt; Samson had fellowship with the promise of seven locks. Again, [Applause] &gt;&gt; it was his personal secret of his personal seven seal. &gt;&gt; There was something for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was hidden to the outside world. But it was open for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; His seven virtues &gt;&gt; was growing out again. &gt;&gt; What you had before the foundation of the world is growing out again. &gt;&gt; What he lost in the valleys of sin &gt;&gt; was growing out again. &gt;&gt; And he started to have fellowship &gt;&gt; with his secret. and he started to prepare himself &gt;&gt; for the final victory. &gt;&gt; And when his life &gt;&gt; uttered its final voices, it thundered in the house of the Philistines. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Talking about a bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. A promise, a statue of a perfect man. You only get started in a fellowship with the stature of a perfect man. Brother Brennham said, "If we prostrate ourselves before living virtue, a living patience, a living temperance, a living godliness, a living brotherly kindness, and a living charity," he says, "Praise the Lord." We just have fellowship with it. You're going to see a manifestation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me wind it down. &gt;&gt; In a message the mighty God unveiled before us, Jesus said, "Well, that's exactly what a church has done." It come from Luda Wesley. Now, back to the original grain. &gt;&gt; He says, "Back to its original glory." &gt;&gt; Back to the glory it was at the beginning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It changed from Pagan down into Luther and from Luther down to Wesley, from Wesley out into Pentecost and on and on changing from glory to glory producing the hidden mana. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says now it's ripe. &gt;&gt; And I believe it's ripe. This message has come to a maturity. &gt;&gt; This message is ripened. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. By fellowship with the promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now it's ripe to bring back exactly like he was at the beginning. He says the same ministry, &gt;&gt; the same Jesus, &gt;&gt; the same power, &gt;&gt; the same Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; the same one that came down on the day of Pentecost &gt;&gt; is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested today from glory and to glory to glory. So, brother Brandham says the same glory, the same power that was in the church will be manifested again. Praise the Lord. Why? They had fellowship with the mystery. Praise the Lord. And one day it will come to pass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, brother Brandham. And it's back to its original seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the same signs the same wonders the same baptism some kind same kind of people &gt;&gt; same kind of people &gt;&gt; acting &gt;&gt; the same way &gt;&gt; with the same power &gt;&gt; the same sensation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's from glory unto glory. &gt;&gt; And he said the next will be change from this glory into a body like his own glorious body where we shall see him. &gt;&gt; May the musician come. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in the message the basis of fellowship. He says, "Under the blood which is the life." He said, "And the blood brings the fire." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The sacrifice was offered by fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you play something softly, let's stand to our feets. I'm finished. You see, if the rich rang rangul young ruler would have only given up &gt;&gt; the fellowship in his heart if he would have sacrificed it, &gt;&gt; the fellowship that he had in his heart. The high priest was standing before him and he God Almighty Jehovah, God Almighty Jehovah &gt;&gt; and his brother was there making by his mental ideas &gt;&gt; a sacrifice and God told him if you would only do so what he does. But you see the fellowship he had in his heart to say it has to be something I can do was greater and instead of putting that on the altar to say Lord that's the way I always thought it has to be &gt;&gt; and he didn't laid it out &gt;&gt; and his destiny was determined &gt;&gt; yeah by what was in his heart. &gt;&gt; Church, we can preach mighty messages, &gt;&gt; but this is coming to the bottom of your heart. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What fellowship? Check yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before we continue with this convention. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What fellowship? With what? Do you have fellowship in your heart? &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is asking you. &gt;&gt; What fellowship did you had two weeks ago? What fellowship? What desire is in your heart? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What were you meditating day and night? &gt;&gt; And we all have failed. But his mercy and his grace &gt;&gt; is greater than that. &gt;&gt; It's greater. We heard that. &gt;&gt; We heard that with the woman that was caught in adultery. &gt;&gt; But there was something in her heart that is that she stayed in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; She could have run away when the others were running away. But she said there's something in Jakina presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whatever he says, [Music] &gt;&gt; let it be, Lord. &gt;&gt; But he had words of eternal life for her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's your ideas, &gt;&gt; maybe you had fellowship with your plans, with your carrier, with your ideas being above the promise of God for your life. If your carrier was stronger than the way that God laid out for you for your life, may you lay it on the altar tonight. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. If his sicknesses &gt;&gt; has come upon your life and the devil started and you're turning around your sickness, &gt;&gt; brother Brennan says don't look on your circumstances. &gt;&gt; Don't even have fellowship with your sickness. &gt;&gt; Don't have fellowship with depression. &gt;&gt; Don't even have fellowship with the backslitting condition. Don't keep on continuing with fellowshipping with your condition you are in &gt;&gt; but put it on the altar of God. &gt;&gt; A sacrifice has been provided. &gt;&gt; The blood has been shed. &gt;&gt; God is ready to break the whale in your personal life. That shina glory can be spread all over your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Benm says the sacrifice he says is offered by fire and he says today when the sacrifice has been burned by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whatever you put on this altar tonight &gt;&gt; may be burned by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you take your own sacrifice by the blood of Jesus Christ and throw yourself on the altar, he say it's covered by the blood and the Holy Ghost gets a hold of that and he sends a sweet smelling savior &gt;&gt; to God that brings you in shikina glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said that's the only place of fellowship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You apply the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let the Holy Spirit answer by fire. &gt;&gt; Elijah one day he made an altar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he laid it all on the altar. And he said, "Let the God, let the God of Jehovah, let it answer by fire." &gt;&gt; It brings you back into Shakina glory. &gt;&gt; And in this fellowship, all things are possible. &gt;&gt; In this meeting, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When we have entered in true fellowship, &gt;&gt; Amen. Lay aside everything that so easily besets us. Lay it on the altar tonight &gt;&gt; and watch the Holy Spirit brings you back. &gt;&gt; There's a restoration in your personal life for divine fellowship &gt;&gt; and it will produce a manifestation of every promise &gt;&gt; that is promised for you. &gt;&gt; Amen.
