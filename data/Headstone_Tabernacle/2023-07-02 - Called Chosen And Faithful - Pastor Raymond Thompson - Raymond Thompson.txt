worthy the lamb took the book loses he is thereof oh what a victory and my my mind well next week lose the convention begins to notice are we looking under great expectation and there's something special when God's people got it together and we have people from Nigeria from from different parts of the world from Ghana from Ivory Coast South Africa America and I'll be coming and there'll be those that connected life they're here and connect with these meetings and because there's a prophecy that there will be a great Gathering somewhere somewhere a gathering of gorgeous people where God will be so pleased to come down and do something special for them and our prayer is that God will anoint the ministers with the proportion our prayer is that God will know the people with the double portion of his presence we need power to face the challenge of the hour what Luther had and Wesley had on the early church Father's Heart can't work for this time you know we have to get the present-day Dynamic power to deal with the issues that we have to face and there are issues that you have to face because the bride will be oppressed people I remember when the bride is taking up the devil make war with the remnant of the woman's seed that the devil looking for twitch members so your job is to ensured that you're not to be a church member and you walk a church bench you want my chest man you want to be part of that bride but the Bible say his wife not the church member his wife Hotmail herself ready you have to see the need to be made ready and don't take for granted because it is the Lord I need a message everything will be all right that's not so two million people came out and all of them perish except Joshua and Caleb the same God that brought them all killed them God is the word God is not a Trinidadian God is not your feelings God is not your emotions God is what he said in his word if he said he will blessing God bless you and the devil's a liar every second gonna heal you he gonna heal you and the devil is still a liar what can the Lord some Praises there's gonna be a mighty Victory and a mighty reverence among God's people I believe that may it start this morning may it start right here with you oh glory to God Amen and it's so great you may be seated to have the right attitude a favor to get to get fever towards God when Jesus when the woman came and begging for a child who's next to the devil and and Jesus told her he's not supposed to take the Germans bread and custody the dogs it was a test a verbal would test a test of your attitude and reaction to words being parental at you and Jesus Through the words is that fit to take the Terrence back he didn't look at her his back was towards her maybe it's not fit to take the children's bed and cast it to dogs and the woman stood her ground she didn't go on Facebook and complain and call this one and complain and go like yeah yeah and La La Land and and complaining and and mumbling and grumbling she wasn't in grumbling mode this man who is he or he could talk to me so and she wasn't going down that road she stood up wrong she said even the dogs get crumbed some of the master table she stood out wrong because she had a need she stood out wrong because nobody else can help her she stood a girl because nobody cared or gave the Lord a shout but if you care Jesus care if you care God care don't ever say I don't care you'll be in real trouble saying that don't say that you better care [Music] maybe season and Jesus did not go to a house Jesus did not delay hands upon her he said for this sin so that I'm convinced you could say the right thing and I just as I could say the writing you could say the wrong thing too that's what we have been saying most of the times the wrong thing but you come to church dedicated words of God that you could God help you to say the right thing hallelujah praise God tell my wife I had an experience recently and it was all negative and so on but I was never negative in it and I realized something what the devil does he shows you the negative part and don't show you the way that God has made that's right so he show you okay the bear the lion Goliath and whatnot but he never show you the sling and the stone and the faith that David have stop looking at what is happening present tense to you in the negative ask yourself if this is happening where's the way out where do I pass out where do I break out where do I contact something higher than I who can the Lord some praises because God always have a way out that's what I'm saying he may leave the storm but give you peace he neither hate all around you but if you love so nobody would hear the wrong oh God they were so upset I'm so angry what do you have in your heart I told my wife I'm happy I'm happy on the inside I don't need nothing external to make me happy I'm internally happy there are some people that don't have happiness inside nothing outside can make them happy there's light to the self and light in the family if I get this I'll be happy if I get that I will be happy if I get that and the devil is Shifting shifting shifting all this and that and when I get this you're still not happy you get that you're still not happy you get a jacket to get a tired they got a plane they get a boat you're still not happy happiness body inside and what happened to the inside no devil could motivate you and influence any outside [Music] [Applause] [Music] sorry you gotta have peace on the inside the other Journey inside let me join me outside your day your wife get upset your joy loss she controlling your joy did they start happening this loss and the peace lost because it's happening but when you have everything inside oh my that's what I want to say when peace [Music] [Applause] when sorrows like she the Lord's room [Music] whatever my love though has told me to say [Applause] it is rare it is bad with My Soul is it well but your soul this morning it is when with My Soul [Music] it is well Oh Glory to God by Jesus I love him this morning it is when hey my soul thank you is it where question is it where with your soul [Music] maybe seated but the Branham speaks I can only be able to help you as God will permit it done by me and God can only help you as your faith will permit him to operate in you I think I'm worth reading him I can only be able to help you as God were permitted done by me and God can only help you as your faith will permit him to operate in you that's why Jesus said by faith at me the whole but this morning we have a special blessing to you my special tip you'd like to share with you this morning it's a message called chosen faithful by the Raymond Thompson preached the 12th of February 2023 you want to go

Lord a hand a priest praise God what a joy greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh what a blessed sunrise the resurrection morning and to be in the presence of God you know this is the best place to be in is enough of God so uh welcome everyone David I need some here thanks so we're gonna go straight into the world let's just have a word of Prayer and if you have a requests you can raise your hand have any fathers in the precious name of Jesus Christ we come to your Mighty throne of grace we say thank you for this privilege to be the house of God many has gone to so many ungodly places many has just gone to church but today Lord we come into your presence and in your presence is fullness of joy and that's what we want Lord to be in your presence father we do not want to occupy a seat and our minds are somewhere else we want the Holy Spirit to Captivate Us by Your Word of God and we know this word has enough power in it Lord to transform a life today Lord so there's anyone with their needs and their requests and their hands up May the Holy Spirit meet with them Lord even those that didn't Lord but maybe requesting for a family member that's not here May the Holy Spirit meet to them may the Holy Spirit be in attendance to give us Revelation and may you inspire Us by this message we know this word of yours is already inspired the message is inspired but we need that inspiration to come on us Lord so that we can know how to walk and live in this evil day so heal the sick amongst us those that are downwarded may they be lifted up those that neither touch the baptism of the Holy Spirit only you can do that God and we know the people didn't come to see any man they come to see Jesus so may you place the service and when we come to the end of the meeting we won't forget to give you all the honor the praise and the glory and the church shall say amen amen amen amen so if you have your Bibles we're still in the Book of Revelation so it's Revelations 12 12. Revelation 17 and Revelations 19. Isn't it nice to be in the Book of Revelation my I hope you brought your Bibles with I hear a few Bible today okay so uh [Music] if you have it Revelations chapter 12 verse 12. therefore rejoice in Heavens and he that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great Wrath now listen we must listen to the scriptures because why is he so Roth because he knoweth that he has but a short time so there's a reason things are happening so speedily in the world if you can see what's happened he knows his time is short so he has to do whatever he can do and it's woe unto the inhabitants of the Earth but there's a people in the Earth that he cannot touch Hallelujah and then revelation 17. [Music] so it's always good to go back and read the whole chapter but we just sort of pulling out your 14 let's read from verse 13. he's having one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the Peace So speaking of all these Kings at that time gives its power to the peace this shall make war with a lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and King of Kings and they that are with him now this is going to be my title so please you must listen to me today and these that are with him so yes they come into the final battle Yeah of human beings and he says but these that are with him are called chosen and faithful sure so there's a people that comes with him but they are called Chosen and faithful and then uh Revelations chapter 19. and let's read from sliven and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon the upon him was called faithful true now this is the one that's we coming with but check what he's called faithful and true and in righteousness he does judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire on his head were many crowns and he had a name written he had no man knew but himself and he was clothed with a white Vista dipped in blood so you can see who it is kept in Blood and his name is called the word of God and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean now what's use this it's the same people in Revelation 17. he says and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword and that worth it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and treated the wine press or the fierceness of the wrath of almighty God and he had in his and he had on his fisture my again and on his thigh a name written king of kings and Lord of lords may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word and you may be seated what a blessing just to read those scriptures so uh I I think today those scriptures we can read it and go home what a blessing it is really to see where we are and what time we did leveling now remember with the midnight service I preached on Satan's time is short he knows his time is short so I won't call this part 2 but I'm taking up from there so may the Lord bless you amen glad to see everyone and we trust the Lord is going to bless us so I just want to sort of pick up in the Satan knows this time is short here end time he says that the devil is in this last days are like a roaring lion going around whoever he can find to devour for he knows his time is short he hasn't got very much time longer now we eat this so I'm just recapping for those that weren't here uh we are not ignorant of Satan's devices so he's come down because he's Wrath so now whatever is going to Chuck on the human beings he's going to Chuck because he knows his time how many he can get he wants to get the Bible's even said hell is enlarged it's borders so that he can get more on his side the Bible we quoted the letter of Alice come out and demon powers are streaming out and that's why you can see brother this is one place Satan even feeds on the Flesh of his own people you can't believe people that serve him and yet look how they dine they they they're smoking all kinds of uh drugs uh what's this Orca pipe they they caught them by the thousands with liquor with murder with rape that's the enemy that's not God so we seek in whom we can devour but remember we read the scripture he goes around like a roaring lion but he's not a lion because it's only one lion and that's a lion of the tribe of Judah Hallelujah so he says here uh he's dumping all his evil on the people but brother says while he's doing that I believe that all the blessings of God will be poured out Hallelujah by the heavenly father upon the church in the last day so no matter what he does God is pouring out his Blessing so just recapping uh brother man says he even sent down extra troops that's why he took the Lord off so extra troops are coming but did you know when the Seven Angels Came extra troops came why to assist his pride knows this time is short Satan knows his time is short but the bride also knows her time is short amen and then we saw how one will say sir and you shall Chase your enemy he shall fall before you the sword and five of you shall chase a hundred come on uh a hundred and hundreds are put ten thousand to flight and your enemy shall flee before you now I want to start from here this is from 26 resurrection of Lazarus there's nothing in Army okay let me give my title first my title is called yes anointed I mean chosen and faithful so remember that called chosen faithful now there's no way you can come outside of those three things then my my subject is Satan knows his time is short my inspiration is is king of kings and his Lord of lords now that the lone brother puts me in Victory knowing that so he says yeah there's nothing can harm you there's no powers that people present in the future nothing can separate us from him we in him and he says we never come on our own will now you're gonna see why you called because you couldn't come on your own world something had to call you you're not even sitting here today something drew you here this morning amen he says he by choice elected us through brought us into him amen so it's his business yes to take care of what he took so you mean brother Raymond I'm not standing in my own power he took me so now he sees is is uh it's his business to take care of me because I didn't come of my own something threw me he pulled me now then it's his duty to take care of me so when I fall he must pick me up when I make a mistake and I confess it he must forgive me why because he called me he took me from The Dungeons of hell he took me from the puts of sin but he called me out today he left many of my friends but he pulled me now it's his duty to take care of me as I go in this journey so why are you called of God [Applause] mind so no man can put you from the father's ends because he's the greatest of all of them he says amen is the father who took care of it he's got to take more he says who's got more power than God so what is the power that you have got over you to take care of you so what power when he's stronger mine the whole powers that's created the universe he says amen that took the solar system and blew it like that like a star went out of place and then he watches over it and that's the kind father we serve so the same father that spoke the universe for billion billion brother still there for billions of years now he he says the same power that took you is the same power that spoke to that star how can you go lost brother how can God forget you when he took you from the mud of the world and place you where you are today we serve a mighty God oh I like the sun we are not a denomination I he says don't let nobody tell you any kind of move in the world can ever interfere with God's he's moving right on it was planned back there in the beginning there ain't a devil enough or enough Devils can interfere with God's program no you want to see there's enough Devils you must say you might say but he calls me to do that and he calls me you know God knew that oh my come on no man this comes fresh you know God created his own enemy in Eden he didn't know about the serpent he didn't know what no he created his own enemy to deceive Eve because in him was attributes to be a savior to be a deliverer so he allowed it to prove to the devil you're not gonna keep my child up I'm Gonna Make A Way right in Eden now you mean he didn't know the end when you're gonna make mistakes and you're gonna fall and you're gonna do things but don't worry he comes right back redeems you cleans you make a way for you and nothing can separate you from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus come on Brothers come on sisters man shake off that demon powers shake off that fear you can't go lost foreign [Applause] [Music] so there's not enough Devils can interfere with God's program so God's program is still in effect it doesn't look like it when you look at the world you saw the earthquake now in uh turkey and uh what's it sabibi or whatever Syria and you see there's almost what 3000 people killed one time yes interviewed some journalists they said what's the distance of the earthquake it says from Johannesburg to Cape Town everything was so flat that's the distance one mother gave birth in the umbilical Court was still on the baby they they could say the baby mother was gone so you uh someone formed me last night and said pastor you preach this God is going to interrupt somebody's program we're not always going to be like that twice Satan has come down with great Wrath and in the end at this time is fulfilling Matthew 24. as I say when they ask him about the end he says there'll be earthquakes in diverse places not only one place all over who would have thought that turkey would ever earthquake the worst thing I think a thousand years or 100 years but you see signs of the end time now when we hear that we we I mean we feel sorry for the people but at the same time for the bride Jesus told him when this happened look up your Redemption draweth nigh [Music] [Applause] [Music] so he says here okay I'm reading art to preacher 7. now oh it says here mark of the beast now oh when I read this sometimes my heart leaps what's a prophet he says my heart leaps for Joy all right when I think of how that we live in here in the last days he says my heart lives for joy and then the ten horns which thou souls are Ten Kings remember I said which received no Kingdom as yet but received power as kings one hour with a beast these have one mind and shall give their power and strength to the Beast well we know the Beast is wrong watch then so we shall make war with a lamb and the lamb shall overcome them so please in this meeting you must be sure you're on the right side they shall make war with a lamb and the lamb overcome them oh I hope you run into the right side because who overcame them there comes maybe for the millennium [Music] sure for he is Lord of lords and King of

says yeah Hebrews chapter 4. people who follow the pillow of fire will certainly have a rough time so you see we can't look for easy times because they gonna persecute the Christians the true ones now there's a lot of Christians denominational Christians you name it Pentecostal Christians all of them but you see when it comes to the pride she's gonna take a stand she's not going to fall for this and what we saw yesterday it blew our minds I just told everyone I just appreciate the message because all that looks so real but it's not real foreign but watch but they're ready for the translation at that time yay come on brother you mean brother Raymond when a squeeze move in what's the third pool then he says the people that follow the pillow fight will certainly have a rough time but they

baptize this soon so God bless you ready for the translation that's right ready to go for the lamb watch overcame them said the Bible and them that followed him because they are called The Chosen yes sir and the faithful the elected of God now why does the bible emphasize this they that are with him so he's given an expression here the Christ don't come along because now he came to fetch him now I hope you can be able to answer it he came to fetch them but now when he comes this time for the final battle there's some people with him and they also ride in white horses clothed in white Raymond and the Bible says they some are pointed them out he wanted the John wanted the people to know who's this people then he says yeah in why we not to denomination they have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the peace that's those five Kings and this shall make war with a lamb but the lamb shall overcome them Glory brother premises for the Lord he is Lord of lords and king of kings and then he goes again and they that are with him are called chosen faithful Hey Brother this excites me my God hallelujah they are called Chosen and faithful now you remember we were ever coaching you didn't call yourself so who called you God called you now you come in with him so you are called chosen now it's got a compound meaning cold and then Chosen and faithful my name oh I love this problem he says wish I could preach a sermon right now on that [Music] wish I could preach a sermon on that right now God give us the grace to preach at someone well rather than there is something laying there and I hope you catch it today and it raises your feet to a bracket where when the enemy won't trip you no more he'll come but he'll not prevail okay he says here uh I wish I could preached a sermon right now on that chosen what before the foundation of the world abiding faithful in their calling so to what are they faithful do they calling so I can't be you and you can't be me

your seed be empty you must be faithful because these that are with him are faithful they faithful and pray they Faithfully in dedicating their lives they're faithful in everything they faithful in their calling [Applause] Hallelujah can I tell you something brother and sister a calling doesn't mean a position yeah it doesn't mean a position you Faithful in your calling as a prayer Warrior it's called to pray you there in the benches yes to aim in the world calling you know what David said he said I'd rather dwell in the house of the Lord for one day than to dwell in the course of the ungodly and I'd rather be a doormat in the house of God than to dwell in the courts of the ungodly make sure you're in the house if your calling is a dormant be the best omit if it's a dick and be the

conjunction in other words it doesn't stop there so it means it goes on they are they shall overcome him no matter how great they get [Music] so that means no matter how great the World Council of churches become how great wrong becomes how great he gathers all his armies he says the it says and faithful and they now speaking of us because we come in with the lamb they shall overcome so you think you have a better now brother wow you're gonna see the little better almost imagine on a white horse I always wanted to ride those but I'm coming on a white horse and I got the white cow a white cloak system can't can you imagine and I'm riding with him whose vest just dipped in Blood and only spies written the word of God yeah brother so we were the King of Kings hey we were the Lord of lords can you imagine coming back brother to face this enemy that gave you such a hard time but now this is the final whoo Hallelujah you you're gonna seem destroyed brother sister Mary you're gonna seem destroyed and Sister Mary you won't be 84 or 83 you're going to be young again Hallelujah imagine all those that has gone on we're coming back riding brother yay Hallelujah I tried to picture this in my mind he says hallelujah that and they are called the chosen in the faithful and is in his conjunction see and the Chosen and faithful they overcome him no matter how great they get did you see the world counts the whole world is I don't care how great they get the minority is going to be the majority [Applause] [Music] he says here questions and answers Genesis he ordained us called us and then he quotes Ephesians 1 now that you all know that's my favorite scripture Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to Saints which are in Ephesus Jesus Christ now here it is notice according as he has chosen us yeah there's so much scriptures sister girl there's so much scripture according his he has chosen us in so when you were chosen you were chosen in him and Christ found no uh God found no fault with that body so when he chose you you were perfect so why you shook up man I made a mistake here I fell then this day you were perfect when God chose you you were perfect and he knew the mistakes you're gonna make but he already made provision for that Hallelujah that's why young people if you make a mistake or anyone don't stay away come right into that doors with your mistake this is the house where God fix him this is a hospital this is where God connects was broken this is a scrap yard that God wears together Hallelujah come with your mistakes come with your thoughts because God can fix you the devil will tell you don't come and he'll take you back to drugs but if you come here God can deliver you and take it away from you man [Applause] so he chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that's pretty good isn't it he's saying no that's not pretty good that's real good okay is that real good man this is real good quotes real good because the prophet went into the mind of God and pulled it down so he said it's real good before there was a foundation in the war wall poor speaking to the Church of Ephesus said he has chosen Us in him now we all the members of the body of Christ is that right and God before the world was ever formed chose you and I in before the world was ever formed he says fuel my isn't that wonderful isn't that good but isn't it real good hey I got a new one man isn't that real good then he goes to Romans 8 moreover whom he did pre knighted then he called and whom he called then he also Justified and whom he justified them he already glorified What does justify mean like you never did it in the first place that's the God we serve now they may point you to your sin but God forgave you years ago plungy beneath the flood as if you never did it [Music] Hallelujah my already glorified so in your presence God you sitting here you already glorified tell me I know it's about hot and so forth but stick with me here's something at the end is something and I hope you're gonna get it he says you're the believer's position in Christ to them that are in Christ's faithful call chosen in Christ that's who pulls the dress in the letter two aren't you happy today you're in Christ isn't that real good or already chosen in Christ that's what Paul said so he wasn't addressing it to the world he was threatening to the vision church that was called and we are representation okay wow it's Luke I'm finishing earlier they don't expect it maybe I'll go by inspiration you love the word and just in your mind and I told you New Year's Day tonight when every trial comes upon you say Satan I know you your time is short you're trying to pull me away from this and pull me away your time is short and sometimes that battle becomes so vicious it almost looks like you're losing your mind but tell him you're a liar it is written you shall have the mind of Christ tell him Satan is written the word is already in us as it was in Mary tell him it is written Hallelujah now we are the sons of God tell him brother because he's so vicious in his attack he's gonna attack marriages he's gonna attack churches he's going to attack homes he's gonna attack your personal life he's going to attack you as a Christian make you lukewarm [Music] and that's one of the most dangerous things because you come to church you sing the image you go back you do your same thing but you must come to that place where he says amen enough is enough oh I feel like a boxer now enough is enough I took enough blows but it's time for me to hit back how do I hit back with the word of God and I know my position now he says here okay now they are joining themselves together coming to The Showdown to Armageddon riding watch on a mixed colored horse and one horse was white one horse was red one horse was black so the three colors was mixed yes and he come out with a pale uh political power horse political power spiritual power controlled by demons watch demon powers which is the Antichrist so this idea that we're speaking of the pale horse rider now young people you must know this because it's good to know that your school and your curriculum whatever you call it that's all good but you need to also know why we had a cloud why was there a Prophet you need to know why because he came to reveal to us this and we must also be ready to prepare ourselves we can't go with our friends and we blink bling and beat this time there and that time come to church is the only time I'm religious you must go back and read read the scriptures that I read and see where does it fit in and what does it do to your life we need that so he says here it's it's mixed it's a political power what spiritual power control Power spiritual he says controlled by demon power Yo which is the Antichrist mixing that all together and you got a Pale Horse now look how he came to that color sickly looking thing is riding on and look what he's riding on this pale looking Crystal colored horse mixed with black red and white come into the battle now watch here now now you have to catch please you're awake all of you okay he says here Gathering these subjects from every nation under heaven did not Daniel interpret the dream and seen the streak of iron run into every Kingdom of Rome yes they are come Gathering so the ten toes of Daniel's statue was mixed with iron and Clay that's the Ten Kings that ran into all the nations and they mixed with clay and iron clean iron doesn't mix but these are the Kings so he's giving them what uh is subjects from the Nations under heaven so that mean the EarthBound so that means they on the earth these subjects they are gathering in now to do it bringing his subjects from the four corners of the Earth riding a pale sickly colored mixed horse say man just a different color horse so it has different powers in the different Church ages this is the final one now in Revelation 19 oh I hope you're ready please man I'm so excited about it I don't know about you and I hope the Holy Spirit can bring it across to you he says now in Revelations 19. not only is he getting ready but Christ Hallelujah is getting ready to meet him now I remember when I read the quote they say never run from a lion remember don't turn your back on the line but facing head on and when you run to him he runs it's time to run to him brother stop running away run to your challenge run to what's happening in your home don't run away they say don't run away run to him young people when he comes your way at school run to him [Applause] [Music] Amen brother Miller but Elijah we gotta run to him can someone close his door please man thank you so he says here revelance not only is he getting ready but Christ is getting ready to meet him so Christ is not running Christ is running to meeting sure the battle is going to be hot and heavy Christ in Beverly since 19. Christ is gathering not from the four corners of the Earth because there's going to be a little bitty Remnant what's he doing he's gathered them from the four corners of Heaven [Music] Satan is given years from where Isis Gathering is from so what happened to this Overcomers and how come they're in heaven that means something happened before this battle oh I hope you see it man Hallelujah you spiritual I think you caught it something happened before the battle so now Christ can't get them from the earth already because something happened before that and he's coming for the final battle so where are these that Christ is gathering they're not on the Earth but this gathered him from the four corners of Heaven hallelujah oh I hope you see where you are you're not on the earth oh I don't know I'm sure I gave it away already you're not on the earth at that time but you're in heaven somewhere because Christ is not Gathering from the earth he's Gathering From the four corners of heaven so what happened to those that overcame that was faithful that was chosen where what happened to them come on young people man I hope you see that there's something that took place amen look Hallelujah we were speaking about it there's something happened [Music] [Applause] oh God man the People Are Spiritual I'm sure you caught it already so you're gonna see your enemy is a defeated enemy he loves you and he makes everything look so real he tells you you lost he tell you you won't make it he's a liar and you're gonna see her so he says here we'll uh now what she says he's getting from not from the Four Corners corners of the earth there's going to be a little bitty Remnant what's he doing is getting him from the four corners of Heaven will get themselves under the altar tomorrow night and you'll see whether it's right or not four corners of Heaven on a snow white horse he also has a name not death but the word of God now remember the other Rider this one has got the word of God and the word of God is life so upon Him is written life sure so someone is riding you this morning [Music] and you better be sure it's the horse rider with life because it only ride you into the resurrection and into the rapture but the other horse rider rides them into the tribulation where there's going to be weeping and gnashing of teeth so young people I'm always they don't say I'm on your case my heart goes out for you don't go the wrong way don't listen to that music don't dress like the world don't act like the world but say Lord I want to give my life to you I want to surrender because there's coming a showdown and we sit in the earth already how can almost 25 they say the numbers going to thirty thousand wiped out from joburg to Cape Town our old place white out 1500 miles and they still count in the deaths anyone believe just five days before this earthquake someone sent me a six minute clip I thought of playing it but maybe next time where the Jews are thousands by the wall crying and praying brother woman and man praying there and about five days after that yeah the earthquake [Music] uh Israel once they Messiah they want their land back don't you want your land back the Holy Ghost we must be frightened we must be victorious let's say I'm in the service I want the Holy Ghost I want to be full mother if you will fold and brother you must ask God for a refilling Lord I wonder if all in that experience I had when I came to Christ I want that God you young people have got baptized that's your fight this morning I came in here to be filled mama and daddy speaking to you why they want to see you filled with the Holy Ghost mine I got another message he says the way he deals with the Earth he deals with the individual the way he saves you that's the way he saves the Earth so you can't go in without the Holy Ghost it's incomplete that's why the Earth must ever fire baptism it's gonna clean every germ every sinner every drunkard every prostitute is going to be burnt and the righteous come back Hallelujah that's why he said behold I send you Elijah before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and we come walking away on the ashes of the wicked thank you [Applause] Ma I like that when I drink water you're still aiming me man it keeps the flow of the spirit man Hallelujah so he says that he also has a name not death but the word of God life amen God wrote right on his thigh there the word of God that's the only life because God is the only source of eternal life there is Zoe that's right and he says congregation says amen and he has got root life riding on a white horse and here he is a man with three different powers mixed up Called Death Gathering to the Earth Gathering his Earthbound delegates Christ is gathering his heaven-born subject they haven't born when you drop from your mother's womb you already haven't born subject Saints he's got death wrote on him Christ has got life wrote on him those who are with him those are with him on the White Horse and they are called chosen before the foundation of the world Amen and they are faithful to the word now watch chosen to obey the word to stay in their position faithful to what do the word he says amen if you I like that one but on the Belmonts are so excited call Chosen before the foundation of the world and then faithful to the word by their choosing all stimulated with new wine and oil just riding right alone coming down to meeting they know the Thunders will issue this thing for pretty soon so people don't understand this but it says this thing well the Thunders will issue it forth the Thunders will bring it forth who is chosen and who's elected and who is faithful and who's call the farmers will issue that so we we cannot stop preaching the Thunders Hallelujah [Music] yeah just a few more praises now what's your next quote the fourth seal yeah so Satan knows that then that the bottomless put is ready for him see oh my while death wrote the Palos mixcreed denominations followed him oh my to watch where he writes him now to Eternal separation from God that's why you must be sure who's riding you if it's the Payless Rider he's writing you to death and eternal separation so you must Shake him off say Lord I want the white horse rider this guy's got death I want life so the minute you see is pulling into the world there's death your Fashions and all that the clothes then all that that's that's the world it's a horse rider that's riding you to death is Mom says here Satan knows the bottomless but he's ready for him that's why so Roth Brothers that's why we have those vicious attack he says here and eternal separation he wrote them to Eternal separation from God that's where he wrote them right into Eternal separation Eternal means you can never come back yeah but watch Christ rode his church right into Glory in the resurrection so now you're gonna see who are those Chosen and faithful because where did Christ ride him because he says the preach now he comes forth steps out from eternity backyard off the Throne of the father where he set as an intercessor now he comes to be king and to rule the nations with the Roar of iron that will be the Millennium Satan will be bound a thousand years he says then what does he do he calls his con his contestants hand in other words they have a game of gods they play so you

words I got the carbon I've got the trump card so play your card because I already raise them from the grave and he takes all the liars and perverters of the world and all that with Satan and destroys them in the Lake of Fire she is all over now and throws them in the Lake of Fire he says oh my hey don't that make you feel good man he rode us into the resurrection Satan wrote them were into the tribulation so don't you want the horse rider of life blood so you still redeemed still Redeemed by the blood these festivals dubbed in blood his thigh got on the word of life so young will you can't

to the enemy there's two books he don't like is Genesis and Revelation and I can prove to you the lamb that's here is the same lamb from Eden hallelujah it's the same lamb and you remember Abram and Amina Caleb and uh I mean Kane he was able slam he was Abraham's lamb and we can bring it all down to so it's the same lamb he was a lamb on Calvary he was the lamb in Revelation chapter 5. when no

when he died at Calvary same lamb lamb stronghold and when he said it's finished it was finished oh Hallelujah that's why I like you a twofold being he can touch this body but he can't touch the soul brother he could take sister Teresa and make a secret body but God got the soul he might hit you and hit you but he can't take your soul [Applause] Hallelujah Jesus stopped him of every uh legal right he was he died recovery the whole question of Salvation the healing was settled at Calvary oh brother your church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year what the theologists failed to do in 2000 years give me a church full of the Holy Ghost and that's what we want we want to see how young people fill with the Holy ghosts our own people fold we want to see everyone filled with the Holy Ghost and and we're not speaking of emotion and sensation but the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will bring that it will show that but Batman says you know you can act as you have it and that's not put on it's not hypocritical that's a quote like you got it before you even have it hey that's wonderful man so I come in there shouting I come in there rejoicing I have the pushes in power for the Holy Spirit give me a church full of the Holy Ghost and God will do in one year what the Theo theologists failed to do the anointing of the church when it really strikes home to that fateful little remnant my after the doors of the Gentiles is close oh God will anoint the church then he that is filthy let him be filthy still you see what happened when the anointing its own it's over for the gender is filthy keep on going in that slime keep on line him that's doing you see this normal it's over so that's why you've got to come now you got to make your choice now the world is very nice it's very appealing sun is very appealing young people when you see your school friends all dressed playing doing what they do and they'll tell you it's so nice you mustn't you're not losing nothing I always say the world is garbage and the devil puts cream on top of it and the people see the cream and they think they're having a good time but you know when they eat in that cream they're eating garbage

going off I don't know oh yeah okay I keep looking in I think I have so much time okay he says yeah that message says the digital watches uh not working now watch Satan once uh possessor because of the fall of the garden is bound and cast into the Lake of Fire his days are finished that's why I said like Goliath there was a timeline on me he should have stayed the 40th Day he shouldn't have come in the camp but you see God uses them to take Glory so if he didn't come out the 40th Day why did David come the 40th today God wanted to take glory and so he I'm still with Israel sure even Pharaoh should not have run after them he said go leave them but you see God said I'm going to take Glory out of favor sure what does he do then he disposes of his contestant Satan he throws him in the Lake of Fire with all those who was inspired by Satan to reject the word of redemption so it's not only him but it's them that decided with him and many that rejected the word of redemption they all get cars the Bible says they cast into the Lake of Fire Satan with these angels gets cast into the Lake of Fire I wonder if the pain must come forward I think this is my last one yeah wow I hope you enjoyed the message can we give the Lord a hand a praise my [Applause] I got some powerful stuff but I'm sure we can pick it up some other time so you are chosen I mean you are called Chosen and elected now if you read the Scripture it says cold chosen any and faithful speaks he only speaks of Chosen and faithful I don't know if you notice now I'm coming to you with a and see how many quoted but you that's why I say the scripture is a compound meaning you can't come if you are so you can't come you have to come only because you are called so even Revelation says that when you read it here it says here 12. so I want to see this oh yes just get my eyes [Music] yes it is this shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for his Lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called so he says call comma and chosen comma and faithful but if you see the quotes we read it almost just speaks of Chosen and faithful but Brahman says all scripture is a compound meaning so number one you must be called so we can't rule out calling right so I have to come then I said something came to me said but brother Raymond what if they challenge you and say many are called but few are chosen don't worry you're still in the chosen group [Applause] still in the chosen group you say brother remember I might not be cold that's right and I go back to David he wasn't qualified but he was chosen the woman in the well wasn't qualified but she was chosen Hallelujah Peter who denied the Lord wasn't hey come on man he wasn't Justified he wasn't even in the plane almost but the difference was he was chosen so people were pointing the finger at the woman at the well point the finger at the Peter point the finger at the David because uh the prophet was saying but the law to me as a king and he brought all the big guys he says it's not one of them is he said don't you have another one he knew he's there he said yes but he's a Shepherd boy he's not qualified bring him bring him bring him bring him bring him bring him hey and when the prophet saw him brother he took that horn of oil and knowing that young boy he wasn't qualified but he was chosen I hope you see election now coming in brother I know I'm not qualified I made so many mistakes I did the most evil in the world but Lord why did you choose me so until you chose me oh glory be to God chosen to fulfill his word the other thing you Faithful and this I wanna drive down consistency brings faithfulness do not consistent some people can't come to church you see them this week you don't see them next week you've got to be consistent and I'm gonna give you a scripture the man in the pool went for 38 years consistent brother he went and you know what when Christ came there was thousands brother misses about 6 000 people that was worship than what he was but where did he go to he went to that man that was consistent oh we got to be consistent in prayer consistent in worship consistent in serving God on our job on our school or wherever we are in our neighborhood we've got to be consistent you can't witness to your school friends and then afterwards you do something that's not right they're gonna tell you but you said you're a Christian so let's be faithful in our calling chosen to fulfill the word of God now if you look at the world and compare how little the bride is you then you'll be shocked to see the minute but God is going to defeat this world with that little bride that scattered right across the world [Applause] [Music] used to write them my ends are up I got both up Lord please write me write me into that Resurrection write me to the rapture and if you see what I was saying where was these people and from heaven where were they that means they went in the Rapture before this battle and I said this is beautiful man it's something that slipped and hid in there so sister Ross said they already made it they already was called here and they were chosen and they were faithful now Faithful is a big word I wanted to break every word down but I knew it will take time but you know what chosen me and when before the foundation of the world I mean called then chosen when also before the foundation war and to fulfill the world faithful to your calling if it's just to pray younger worship to show God on whose side you are men to make your stand and get baptized before it's too late the enemies come down with great truth check out who is taking out the young people own people I mean we were at that funeral yesterday it was so late but there was like what 14 funerals look still busy at that time just bearing people people are dying like flies not one of us has got the guarantee we will see tomorrow not one of us sitting here my how my heart goes out for pastor hidden I mean just last week on his way to church to preach gets a heart attack who's got that guarantee will be here that's why I preach the way it might be the last man I don't know and I always want to warn you young girls and warn people and say be ready don't be like the world get rid of the fashions don't worry about those things that's attracting you uh thirty thousand people killed in one earthquake they say it's the worst in the world is that getting ready for the big one for Los Angeles where brother brim says six million people will die and the little documentary shows how that fault runs all the way and that how a 200 mile chunk is going to slide into the ocean and the tidal wave will come right up to the mountains of Tucson see what's going to happen any here we taking it easy we need to pray we need to dedicate we can't look at the world we can't play around now with a boyfriend and a girlfriend I don't say it's wrong but first get seek the kingdom first and all things will be added you get your husband you'll get your wife but seek the kingdom of God first young man that's what's going to get you in the rapture those things will be added to you and listen to your parents they're not fighting for nothing they fighting because it's real and they want the best for you they want you full with the Holy Ghost and don't look at your friends please and pattern after them don't look at the Fashions and pattern after that that's the Payless Rider riding you to Eternal separation and you won't be able to come back you know the foolish virgins was in the message so the stuff are all coming fresh they were in the message but they didn't have enough oil now how come the wise virgins was in the same message same church but they had extra oil so are you taking enough oil to get you through to the wedding supper are you on fire for God you not lukewarm you're not just in the message [Music] [Applause] so I want us to stand while I read this quote and please just see on which side you fit yes such beautiful stuff I have here but my burden is for you and I want you to if this is the last meeting you ever hear me preach I want you to take heed today and say Lord I don't want to miss what is going on here now if your presence is here and it's speaking to me then I want to yield because you see no one next to you is going to stay next to you on that day but the holy spirit is here convicting you and seeing young man make your life your life to Christ right with God plead for the holy spirit it's yours by promise but God wants to ask for it [Music] oh God what anointing in this place man and I hope it speaks speak to your heart and you don't see the past but you see the Holy Spirit and you don't hear my voice you hear his voice mine will mean nothing but I hope you hear the Holy Spirit I can almost feel tears of the Holy Spirit dripping down like falling upon you and saying son I love you don't walk away I wanna ride you into the resurrection in the Rapture he says your time is at hand look at the title it's come now for us to realize these things time has come when God is breaking the boundaries down the time has come the devil is rising up like a wild line going around about roaring doing everything but the great battle has been set what I wonder what it would be tonight and I say this morning if

on the expectation for God to continue to do something tremendous for us I feel it any day now any minute now and truly we're in a countdown for a wonderful time in the convention and I'm under great expectation for God to do something for his people amen before we uh close out in prayer and get to the announcements do have some notes of praises so firstly from sister Alicia O'Brien thanking God for healing my 101 year old mom my Lord he is still in the healing business thank you brother Ovid and the scenes for your sincere prayers and how we have so we thank God for that what a testimony huh my my mind but the Rupert Nigeria I'd like to thank God for 66 birthday years on the 27th of June so he's thanking God for another year [Applause] from uh brother Nathaniel and sister with nights given thanks for seeing another year in this past week so we thank God for them as well may God bless you richly and for their friend Ansel who is here with them today as well amen another note of Praise greeting Saints in the powerful name of Jesus Christ I would like to give God praise for making a way on last Tuesday I encountered a young man in his family struggling to open their car he somehow had locked the key that he used to open the car on the inside of the car and the only key he seemed to have was the one that locks the car so I kept trying everything possible to open the car I didn't ask him for the key used to lock the car to try to open it so he tried to take the thing that's supposed to lock it to open it and I got tired after a while and felt like giving up but I decided to pray and try once more as I was praying I heard a click and the door opened um a man next to me told me I'm a real boss but I told him it's not me it's Jesus praising Jesus for making away brother Sabu I love that brother and that's that's tremendous so this time let's just bow ahead to a word of Prayer we don't have any written prayer requests but if you do have a request today that you want to approach the throne of grace as we pray this evening that's just ball heads blow our hearts our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we don't have the words to thank you for lord your word that you shared to us through your son servant and Minister pastor Raymond Thompson the Lord we thank you for the message Lord and how you use them and the burden in his heart Lord of this masterpiece called Chosen and faithful and we have been challenged Lord to be more faithful faithful in our prayer lives faithful in our journey faithful in our purpose faithful in the fact that we have been chosen and faithful in our calling so father God we thank you for the word that has been spoken and Lord we see every service Lord it just moves from the word into the spirit truly the ministry of the spirit is here to Quicken the word and Lord we see the vibrations of glory Lord as we come together every service we know Lord are what we are prophesied about what we have preached about what we have

eve of the conventional we are only evil of the convention we just have two Services left before the convention so service this coming Wednesday will be a virtual only service there will be no physical service here at the Tabernacle so this Wednesday virtual service there will be no service uh no Zoom service this coming Friday all our teams are Marshall to prepare for the convention so we just have Wednesday virtually this Wednesday and this coming Sunday will be our last service before the convention next week Lord willingness convention week and we have Believers flying in as early as next week Tuesday arriving on to the beautiful shores of Trinidad and Tobago with swords drawn and Hallelujah Ephesians 6 armor of the Lord you know ready for battle you know one of these days will be the last service you'll be the last song It'll be the last service preach but before we leave this place I can tell you one thing we're gonna give the devil a run we're gonna clean the devil's Kingdom out we're gonna take back every inch or ground it whatever you lost along this journey and whenever you're supposed to have you're gonna have it and I believe we are this much closer than when we first began so I don't feel no Ways Tired I've come too far from where I started from so so we want to give us this final push for the virtual Services coming Wednesday and of course next Sunday our final service of preparation before the convention to give it our all and I want to encourage you to remember the various ministers in prayer who would be ministering and greeting and testifying and song leaders and the musicians that are coming in and all the efforts and the sacrifice to be here so at this time the technical team is ready I really want to appreciate but Anthony O'Brien homina picture brother Anthony he wears many many many many hats I don't know how he juggles them all um but he wears many many many hats and together with brother Ovid um they worked very hard on the non-span video for the convention so if the technical team can take us to that we'd appreciate it key in the inspiration of the convention Parable unto them to this position or always to pray and not to faint saying there wasn't a city a judge which feared not God neither regard [Music] Ed that City she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but after what he said within himself though I fear not God nor regard man yet because this Widow troubleth me I will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge said [Music] and shall not God avenge his only lect which cried day and night unto him though he bear along with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth Jesus never questioned when he came back would he find respects he never questioned whether he had find Saints he never questioned whether he had found righteousness but what Jesus questioned whether he had fined or not is what I'm trying to uphold will I find faith when I'm coming beloved when I gave all diligence to right unto you of the common salvation it is needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be [Music] faith is the revelation of the will of God now the only way that we're going to ever know what if we can only find out what these days is then we can earnestly contend for that faith is that right what the face now that the sea faith that was once delivered to the Saints now if we'll go back to where they were first call Saints and find out what kind of a face they had then we'll know or more or less uh what they can get what to contend for he was talking about when the first church would set an order was inaugurated on the day of Pentecost and now we'll notice what kind of faith that they had they had a faith in a resurrected living Christ someone who would rose from the dead and was living among them just as same as he was before he ever died now that see they wasn't contending for some historical Affair but they were contending for a living Christ a resurrected one who was in their midst [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] a lot of powerful inspiration and a lot of gifts in the church so we thank you but Anthony God bless you for that for putting that together was the director so they seem to have quite a time working on that so may the Lord bless them so we continue to solicit your prayers for the ministry for the song leaders for the musicians up to yesterday the team was here technically as you can see in the back when you walk out we're building the boots with the translation we have Believers will be coming with will need headphones for French and then we're trying to stream out in French and Spanish so it's a lot of moving pieces that we're trying to coordinate for the convention so we continue to appreciate your prayer your support for those of you who have made pledges and commitments we encourage you to continue to support in that area also there were questions around the availability of lunches as you know we provide lunches for our International guests we also have the menu available on the notice board downstairs if you are interested um in ordering lunch or dinner that's available via the menus downstairs and there will be sisters downstairs who

to have that taken care of the menus are on the noticeable downstairs along with the associated costs and you can feel free to speak with which of the sisters are downstairs taking care of that responsibility uh we are also asking for some volunteers uh for during a convention in particular for the Friday evening and the Saturday evening at the end of the day to help us just put back the Tabernacle in order for the next day's services so of course Friday after the first day of the convention uh we look for some assistance to kind of sort things out and then again on Saturday after the last service the Sorting of a Sunday service and of course we'll need a little support to bring back the church in order after the convention is over so if you are available to help and this in a sense will be all of the various group ones etc etc coming together for this great effort but we do want to solicit some additional help so we'll ask you to please give your name to Brother Andy uh
