[45:16] are some people you go into filled with

[46:22] preacher so god bless you brother over
[46:24] thank you for the invitation and the
[46:27] lovely church that has to work so hard
[46:31] listen I have been on the other side of
[46:35] planning these conventions and things
[46:38] like that and I know how much planning
[46:40] and how much sacrifice people have to
[46:44] sacrifice their time their their
[46:47] finances and things to make this a
[46:49] reality but I just want to let you know
[46:52] that you've done a perfect job in making
[46:55] us feel comfortable thank you a man
[46:58] headstone Tabernacle we certainly
[47:02] appreciate you and greetings to the
[47:06] pastors and the ministers that have come
[47:10] from all over and visiting ministers
[47:13] tonight I greet you in a wonderful name
[47:16] of Jesus Christ and in case you don't
[47:19] know who I am I am brother Jesse Robledo
[47:21] and I am brother Coleman son-in-law the
[47:27] late brother Coleman son-in-law and I'm
[47:29] not ashamed of it amen because he's a
[47:33] great man of God
[47:35] and we'll find out after this message
[47:40] and the weekend that no matter what
[47:43] happens there is nothing more powerful
[47:46] than love nothing is more powerful than
[47:54] love love will defeat any problem any
[48:00] situation it will straighten the crooked
[48:05] ways it will well it's the total answer
[48:12] in just love and if you let the love of
[48:16] God come down I believe he will take
[48:19] care of the rest sometimes we try to do
[48:21] God's job he doesn't want us to do just
[48:23] wants us to let go on that God
[48:25] he'll take care of the rest amen so
[48:29] greetings to everyone online and
[48:31] wherever you come from and I just wanted
[48:33] to thank brother Chandler and brother
[48:36] Solomon for letting God use their gifts
[48:42] in a mighty way may God richly bless you
[48:46] the New Testament brother Chandler in my
[48:50] blood I love that you see because it had
[48:53] to be the death of the testator in order
[48:56] for the New Covenant to be to come into
[48:58] effect and that covenant is an effect
[49:02] tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[49:06] he not only forget he's not only
[49:08] forgiven your sins but you've never did
[49:12] it in the first place
[49:14] hallelujah the Old Testament blood could
[49:17] cover a man but it could not destroy I
[49:20] like what brother Branham said but this
[49:23] this blood it not it breaks down the sin
[49:27] and and at the very end you have just
[49:29] little fragments of sin and it goes back
[49:33] to the original owner who made you do it
[49:36] and he has to pay for it
[49:38] amen he has to pay for it glory be to
[49:42] God because sin must be judged a man I
[49:46] didn't do it the devil praise God
[49:48] Oh hallelujah I'm not going to say the
[49:51] devil made me do it
[49:53] but you know we all have our
[49:55] shortcomings and we're not perfect I
[49:57] thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ
[50:00] in this hour amen I believe that's what
[50:03] this meeting is all about a man and
[50:05] brother
[50:06] Solomon amen the robe of perfection
[50:09] thank you brother Solomon God richly
[50:13] bless you my brother I really enjoy that
[50:16] message this this afternoon and I was
[50:20] telling for the obut in the room how
[50:23] impressed I was and the way our brother
[50:27] delivers the message and you know made
[50:29] me kind of feel old when he began to
[50:31] speak about years ago he when he first
[50:34] heard us you know and but it's so good
[50:38] to actually see these brothers and God
[50:42] called men come amen
[50:44] knowing that perhaps our time the Sun is
[50:48] setting you see but God will give us the
[50:52] strength to go on and to possess every
[50:55] promise that is before us amen there's
[51:00] much more land to possess amen
[51:03] so I'm not quitting yet no no no no no
[51:07] I'm not quitting yet I'm not over amen
[51:10] we have much more land to possess but we
[51:11] thank God for the young men praise God
[51:14] that is not ashamed of the gospel of
[51:17] Jesus Christ amen and we'll call sin sin
[51:22] right right wrong wrong and stand on the
[51:25] truth of this revealed word amen
[51:28] especially in this hour where it has
[51:30] become so confusing to so many but it's
[51:34] very simple
[51:35] this message doesn't change you know men
[51:40] changes people change but God does not
[51:44] change amen and we serve Jesus the same
[51:48] yesterday today and forever so therefore
[51:52] we're going to preach a message tonight
[51:54] that has been spoken about I'm sure by
[51:57] your pastor and brother branham you've
[52:00] heard you've heard the tapes and things
[52:01] these tapes don't get old you know no no
[52:04] no you they say the best wine is the old
[52:08] wine the one that's left in the cellar
[52:11] for a while and is blue blue busy
[52:13] fermenting and it's getting more and
[52:15] more powerful all the time you may have
[52:18] heard that message or read that message
[52:20] before but then you come back to it who
[52:22] was more powerful than it was when you a
[52:25] man first heard it a man that's just the
[52:28] way it is
[52:29] amen to me so therefore I am very
[52:31] passionate and will stand to our feet
[52:34] shortly I am very passionate about this
[52:39] theme of the meeting here to apply the
[52:43] token I hope that we can all get the
[52:50] revelation and understanding of what
[52:52] this means my friends when the token
[52:58] comes into view it was at the evening
[53:02] time in the evening time it was in
[53:06] effect and it didn't last long because
[53:12] after they apply the token Pharaoh not
[53:16] only let them go he kicked them out he
[53:20] had enough with these people called the
[53:23] Israelites so I want to speak on that
[53:26] subject tonight that the devil will will
[53:28] have enough of you
[53:30] where you know he doesn't have to let
[53:32] you go he's gonna say leave my presence
[53:36] hey man
[53:38] glory be to God because we don't know
[53:40] who we are yet but by God's grace we
[53:43] will find out let us stand to our feet
[53:45] amen so if God requires a token surely
[53:49] he's got to make a way for a man the
[53:52] Prophet said in desperation 1963 after
[53:54] the seals the token was the highlight
[53:58] message of his entire ministry so we're
[54:02] not just talking about something that we
[54:04] should make light of and after the seals
[54:07] a message is capped off by one thing the
[54:11] token the holy ghost this is what
[54:16] brother Graham said the holy ghost the
[54:17] token follows the blood all the way from
[54:20] the book of redemption the token Jesus
[54:24] Christ the Holy Spirit is among us we
[54:28] should reverence that so we're here to
[54:32] reverence amen the token the Holy Ghost
[54:37] amen and this is a showdown I truly
[54:41] believe with all my heart because we
[54:43] have heard messages quotes and
[54:45] scriptures and battles and what group
[54:48] were you in what denomination do you
[54:52] belongs what church you belong that
[54:53] means nothing do you have the token
[54:56] that's all that means
[54:58] amen so let us turn the stand as we turn
[55:02] to the book of Exodus and I'm sure you
[55:05] have read this before
[55:15] book of Exodus 12 and verse 11 through
[55:19] 13 and Joshua chapter 2 verses 17
[55:25] through 21 let's see what the Lord will
[55:32] have us to speak on tonight and we pray
[55:37] that God will have his way my alarm
[55:43] clock is I am on the clock now so I just
[55:46] want to redeem the time Exodus chapter
[55:49] 12 and verse 11 and and thus saith and
[55:55] doth shall you eat with your loins
[56:00] girded your shoes on your feet and your
[56:05] staff in your hand and ye shall eat it
[56:09] in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I
[56:14] will pass through the land of Egypt this
[56:16] night and I will smite all the firstborn
[56:18] and in the land of Egypt both man and
[56:22] beast and against all the gods of Egypt
[56:27] I will execute judgment I am the Lord
[56:32] and the blood shall be to you for a
[56:38] token upon the houses where ye are and
[56:42] when I see the Blood I will pass over
[56:48] you and the plague shall not be upon you
[56:53] to destroy you when I smite the land of
[56:58] Egypt
[57:01] hallelujah these judgments are strictly
[57:05] for Egypt not for the called out church
[57:10] and we have a covenant that is a token
[57:15] to make sure that it is our place of
[57:19] safety Joshua chapter 2
[57:26] Joshua chapter 2 let's start with verse
[57:32] 17 and the men said unto her we will be
[57:41] blameless of this dino 'the which thou
[57:45] has made us swear behold when we come
[57:50] into the land thou shalt bind this line
[57:54] of scarlet thread on the window which
[57:58] thou did us let us down by and thou
[58:03] shalt bring thy father and thy mother
[58:06] and thy brethren and all thy father's
[58:10] household home unto thee and it shall be
[58:16] that whosoever shall go out of the door
[58:19] of the house into the street his blood
[58:24] shall be upon his head and we will be
[58:30] guiltless and whosoever shall be with
[58:33] thee and the house his blood shall be on
[58:36] our head if any hand be upon him and if
[58:42] thou utter this our business then we
[58:47] will be quit of thine oath which thou
[58:52] have made us to swear and she said
[58:57] according unto your word so be it and
[59:00] she sent them away and they departed as
[59:05] she bound the scarlet line in the window
[59:10] now the scarlet line was the sign that
[59:16] they would be looking for when they
[59:19] returned
[59:23] she couldn't hide it in in the house if
[59:27] she wanted to live she had to display it
[59:31] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[59:33] reading of his word let us have a word
[59:35] of Prayer our gracious Heavenly Father
[59:39] we are so thankful to be here tonight
[59:42] Lord and feel the anointing of the Holy
[59:46] Spirit Lord in the building and Lord we
[59:50] have been blessed already by brother
[59:53] Peter Chandler's message in brother
[59:55] Solomon's message father setting the
[59:58] tone and tonight I just feel just to
[1:00:01] speak a little bit on what is fixing to
[1:00:05] take place and we don't approach this
[1:00:08] with fear we approach this with faith
[1:00:10] believing their God that the God who
[1:00:13] requires the token is also there to
[1:00:16] provide it as well and father what a
[1:00:19] time because the token means it's not
[1:00:22] simply judgment in Egypt it means that
[1:00:25] we are leaving it means that our days of
[1:00:29] bondage is over it means that we're
[1:00:32] going over to the promised land it means
[1:00:35] also that the Egyptians and taskmasters
[1:00:40] that Oh for over 400 years have taught
[1:00:43] us that we're nothing but slaves and mud
[1:00:45] dobbers we have a greater revelation
[1:00:47] that we are children of God we are the
[1:00:51] called of God hallelujah and the Phyllis
[1:00:55] rather the Egyptians and the enemy we
[1:00:58] will see them no more amen because we
[1:01:03] will be driven out dear god and led by a
[1:01:07] mighty hand father so I pray dear God
[1:01:10] that you would bless your people tonight
[1:01:12] bless the word and may the spirit follow
[1:01:15] the word dear God to anoint it Lord to
[1:01:18] the hearts of the people we ask it in
[1:01:20] the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen
[1:01:23] god bless you you may be seated let's
[1:01:25] give the Lord a hand the phrase
[1:01:29] [Applause]
[1:01:34] amen hallelujah so I don't want to be
[1:01:37] too long with you tonight I know we've
[1:01:39] had three services today and I just want
[1:01:44] to get right to the message the title of
[1:01:46] my message tonight if I would redemption
[1:01:50] by blood and by power Redemption by
[1:01:55] blood and by power we know that without
[1:02:01] blood there is really no redemption amen
[1:02:06] Redemption means to bring back to
[1:02:09] original fallen state to restore a
[1:02:13] person to his original state and you
[1:02:16] must Redemption brother Graham set is in
[1:02:19] two parts is a coming out of and a going
[1:02:22] in two so if when we're talking about an
[1:02:25] exodus we're talking about it coming out
[1:02:27] oh and a going in two so therefore God
[1:02:31] will not pull you out unless he has
[1:02:33] somewhere to put you in so therefore we
[1:02:36] are sure a man that God has better
[1:02:39] places and things for us a Mendez
[1:02:42] promised but I want to start off with
[1:02:45] this just to leave a little thought in
[1:02:48] your mind food for thought as it were
[1:02:52] and we could just look at it examine it
[1:02:57] and see how the Lord will well use it on
[1:03:02] October the 14th in 1962 brother Branham
[1:03:08] preached a message the statue of a
[1:03:10] perfect man very powerful message
[1:03:13] everybody was interested in coming
[1:03:17] becoming that perfect man that brother
[1:03:20] Branham was speaking about and yet today
[1:03:24] what Christian does not want to be
[1:03:26] perfect everybody wants to be perfect
[1:03:28] we're striving for perfection and yet I
[1:03:32] remember when brother Coleman told me
[1:03:36] years ago that after brother Branham
[1:03:39] preached that message statue a perfect
[1:03:41] man
[1:03:42] there were many that went out and were a
[1:03:46] little confused as to how to apply the
[1:03:52] virtues and so therefore brother Coleman
[1:03:56] said there was preachers that he knows
[1:03:58] if they were preaching well all you need
[1:04:01] to take his seven deep breaths now you
[1:04:08] have faith now you have virtue you see
[1:04:12] how the intellectual mind will will make
[1:04:15] something spiritual at a very natural
[1:04:18] thing and it had nothing to do with
[1:04:20] anything so but if you notice that three
[1:04:24] weeks later brother Branham no doubt
[1:04:28] having heard of this on November the
[1:04:31] fourth 1962 the Prophet came back and
[1:04:35] spoke a message on blasphemous names and
[1:04:39] if you notice on that message brother
[1:04:42] Branham he begins to really clarify how
[1:04:48] to add and what it is to add to your
[1:04:51] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:04:53] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:04:54] and actually it's as clear and yet a
[1:04:58] revelation is needed you see because the
[1:05:01] Prophet will make it clear to a certain
[1:05:05] point but it yes needs to be revealed to
[1:05:09] the individual so therefore so you'll
[1:05:12] understand but in this clarification
[1:05:16] that he come he brought with him sister
[1:05:20] scheppers dream he brought with him
[1:05:23] sister scheppers dream and he began to
[1:05:27] explain certain things about sister
[1:05:32] scheppers dream and we I'm not going to
[1:05:34] get into the whole thing but the reason
[1:05:37] why sister Shepherd was so disturbed
[1:05:41] after hearing the message statue of a
[1:05:45] perfect man is that after hearing that
[1:05:49] she had a question
[1:05:52] in her heart whether she really had the
[1:05:58] Holy Ghost so I want to just drop this
[1:06:04] off here because I cannot tell anybody
[1:06:08] you have the holy girls this one don't
[1:06:10] have it but I can tell you one thing
[1:06:13] that God can only build his structure on
[1:06:17] the Holy Ghost not a sensation Amen not
[1:06:24] goosebumps whatever because brother
[1:06:26] Branham said add to your faith not at
[1:06:30] faith but add to your faith and he types
[1:06:33] out the Holy Ghost as being faith the
[1:06:37] foundation that's the foundation
[1:06:42] hallelujah because God is not going to
[1:06:45] build his building on our emotions he's
[1:06:48] not going to build it on a church he's
[1:06:50] not going to build it on a man he's
[1:06:53] gonna build it on himself hallelujah
[1:06:56] glory be to God so the foundation must
[1:07:00] be there
[1:07:01] amen he is not only the cornerstone but
[1:07:04] the stone which the builders has refused
[1:07:07] have become the head of the corner glory
[1:07:11] be to God and that is why I will say
[1:07:19] this and this is why the problems you
[1:07:20] have today and we all have today we see
[1:07:23] people's and works are crumbling and
[1:07:25] everything but I'm going to tell you
[1:07:27] something
[1:07:27] God's work can never crumble Oh God's
[1:07:32] work works God's building will stand the
[1:07:37] test of time glory be to God because he
[1:07:41] builds it upon himself and heaven and
[1:07:43] earth will pass away but my word the
[1:07:47] foundation will never pass away lower
[1:07:50] beats are God's say him as somebody
[1:07:53] hallelujah there shall be the
[1:07:56] manifestation of the sons of God a man
[1:07:59] standing on it earth a man manifesting
[1:08:02] and displaying all these of virtues
[1:08:06] praise God but now but that's why
[1:08:09] brother Branham said we have to be born
[1:08:11] and positionally born
[1:08:13] hey man hallelujah born and positionally
[1:08:18] born glory be to God the Holy Ghost you
[1:08:21] must be born again we cannot even God
[1:08:24] can't even build upon us until we are
[1:08:26] born again glory be to God because it
[1:08:29] won't hold the weight of the building
[1:08:32] amen hallelujah praise this wonderful
[1:08:36] name so amen so we realize that the Holy
[1:08:39] Ghost is faith on the bottom the
[1:08:42] foundation so amen so it behooves us to
[1:08:45] ask well and and and take inventory to
[1:08:48] see if we do have the same if we have
[1:08:51] the Holy Ghost and what it takes to hold
[1:08:53] this building because I've seen so many
[1:08:55] buildings crash and works crash and well
[1:08:59] God knows and he will certainly take
[1:09:03] care of those things so therefore but
[1:09:05] now let us get into our subject tonight
[1:09:08] because I want to begin to for the young
[1:09:12] people especially excuse me I'm a slow
[1:09:16] starter a man I want to for the young
[1:09:23] people who have not heard or you
[1:09:25] probably heard token message I'm sure
[1:09:28] but I want to get on a level where you
[1:09:32] would understand I like that because I'm
[1:09:36] not here to preach great mysteries and
[1:09:38] whatever everybody ministers according
[1:09:40] to their measure of faith but as we know
[1:09:44] that in the natural we realize Israel
[1:09:52] left the land the promised land Jacob
[1:09:58] because there was a famine in the land
[1:10:03] and if you could only understand that
[1:10:08] all things work together for good to
[1:10:14] them that love God and to them that are
[1:10:17] called according to his purpose
[1:10:20] now Joseph he had a dream he was a
[1:10:23] spiritual man he was a a prophet
[1:10:27] quite frankly and God had already
[1:10:30] revealed to him his destiny he shared
[1:10:35] with the other brothers who were
[1:10:37] short-sighted who didn't share that
[1:10:40] vision so Joseph had to stand alone on
[1:10:45] this vision and his destiny and he began
[1:10:50] to share with the brothers a man that
[1:10:54] one day Wow I dreamt this that you know
[1:10:57] you're gonna bow before me your sheaves
[1:10:59] and everything else and and they got mad
[1:11:02] because I mean who how dare you how dare
[1:11:05] you you know and sometimes you know you
[1:11:07] begin to speak spiritual things and it's
[1:11:09] just all of a sudden people just they
[1:11:11] get a it's a spirits you know they just
[1:11:13] dislike you but it's okay because Joseph
[1:11:18] knew where he stood you see that's fine
[1:11:20] so now here's here's what I want to say
[1:11:23] now Joseph in order for him for his
[1:11:27] destiny to be fulfilled he had to be
[1:11:32] sold to Egypt
[1:11:34] [Music]
[1:11:39] understand that God's in the program
[1:11:42] this is that there is no oops with God
[1:11:46] you may think oh my god why am I in this
[1:11:49] and why and why this and why that
[1:11:51] go where you're just a few steps closer
[1:11:53] to where God wants you to be hallelujah
[1:11:58] glory be to God amen
[1:12:01] because God had a plan for Joseph a man
[1:12:05] that he would be a ruler in Egypt amen
[1:12:10] he will be second-in-command a man he
[1:12:13] had gone from prison he was going to be
[1:12:15] placed into power but before he could be
[1:12:18] placed into power he had to learn Amon
[1:12:22] how to be a servant he had to learn how
[1:12:25] to forgive he had to learn how a new you
[1:12:28] how to have the character of Jesus
[1:12:30] Christ amen
[1:12:32] because power amen I am a character
[1:12:35] without power I mean a power the
[1:12:38] character is satanic rather so we know
[1:12:41] God working on your character a man
[1:12:44] that's a tough part but God is working
[1:12:46] every day right now he's working on your
[1:12:49] character glory be to God man
[1:12:52] Oh hallelujah so we know then he was
[1:12:56] then sold into Egypt which got him a
[1:13:00] little closer to Pharaoh he never knew
[1:13:02] Pharaoh but God had predestinated him
[1:13:05] before the foundation were to be
[1:13:07] Pharaohs right-hand man okay so he got a
[1:13:12] job with the Potiphar who was well he
[1:13:17] knew Pharaoh he knew who failure was but
[1:13:20] of course he was interrupted by his
[1:13:23] wife's should I say weaknesses and
[1:13:29] Joseph was accused for doing nothing
[1:13:37] and I've often said Annie if anyone had
[1:13:41] a reason to kind of figure out try to
[1:13:45] figure out Laura why it was Joseph
[1:13:48] because Joseph he tried to do everything
[1:13:51] well he tried to do everything right but
[1:13:56] it so happens that everything that he
[1:14:00] when he would do right evil was always
[1:14:03] present we all know that but he ended up
[1:14:06] in jail he was getting a little closer
[1:14:10] to the throne in that jail you mean to
[1:14:15] tell me my trial my tribulation I am in
[1:14:18] trees I'm getting a little closer to the
[1:14:21] pro yes Laura beats our God because if
[1:14:29] it had not been a man his time in jail
[1:14:32] he would have never met that Butler he
[1:14:35] would have never met the Baker who was
[1:14:37] in contact with payroll Oh hallelujah
[1:14:40] God knows how to do it don't try to
[1:14:43] figure him out a man God has taken you a
[1:14:45] little step closer praise be to God I'm
[1:14:49] feeling good now because of what steps
[1:14:53] of the righteous has ordered of the Lord
[1:14:56] glory be to God amen amen so therefore
[1:15:00] of course Joseph told Amen de Bakker
[1:15:04] please remember a rather the butler
[1:15:06] please remember me when you go back amen
[1:15:10] you restore to Pharaoh and remember me
[1:15:12] he forgot what I'm gonna tell you
[1:15:16] something it was because I and I believe
[1:15:18] with all my heart Joseph was not ready
[1:15:22] he wasn't ready he needed a little more
[1:15:27] molding down and breaking off b'man he
[1:15:30] wasn't ready for power
[1:15:34] he had to wait until God knew that he
[1:15:37] was ready and when God saw that he was
[1:15:41] ready here comes the core Joseph Peres
[1:15:46] wants to see you oh hey man don't worry
[1:15:51] that call is coming
[1:15:53] praise God God will say here's my spirit
[1:15:56] flowing freely over here here's another
[1:15:58] one over there here's another one over
[1:16:00] there this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:16:03] well pleased praise God God has got to
[1:16:06] see it nobody else
[1:16:07] hey man hallelujah hey man I love that
[1:16:13] praise God I love that don't ever think
[1:16:16] that something has gone wrong in your
[1:16:18] life if your name isn't a Lamb's Book of
[1:16:21] Life don't worry he may take you this
[1:16:24] way he may take you that way you may not
[1:16:26] understand what is going on in your life
[1:16:29] but at the end of it all you'll come to
[1:16:32] the place where he wants you to be
[1:16:35] hallelujah glory be to God because we
[1:16:40] are the people of God Amen hallelujah
[1:16:45] hallelujah so then of course he
[1:16:48] remembered when Pharaoh had to have the
[1:16:51] dream that nobody could interpret but of
[1:16:54] course then he remember oh yeah you know
[1:16:56] the Baker the Butler said I forgot I
[1:16:59] forgot a please forgive me but there is
[1:17:02] a man down no he's not he's not in a for
[1:17:05] he's down he's down in a dungeon he's
[1:17:10] closed God put him there to be close to
[1:17:14] be within the core the range of the core
[1:17:17] to come a man could you imagine
[1:17:20] Joseph coming up to the to Pharaoh and
[1:17:22] telling him exactly amen what was going
[1:17:25] to take place for the next seven years
[1:17:27] 14 years and so forth and and Joseph was
[1:17:31] saying what you need to do is get a man
[1:17:33] that is wise and follow the Holy Ghost
[1:17:36] and knows how to do something and
[1:17:38] Pharaoh is looking at him my god you are
[1:17:41] that man
[1:17:43] what are you talking about go find a man
[1:17:46] I see a man hey man hallelujah
[1:17:52] I see a man praise God
[1:17:55] a man he didn't ally you had the job
[1:17:57] there was the interview you got the job
[1:18:00] glory be to God but now let's go back a
[1:18:02] moment because then we realize that that
[1:18:05] was in the times that was times of
[1:18:09] Pharaoh and Joseph and thing but they
[1:18:12] came of time where this Pharaoh knew not
[1:18:16] Joseph that was where the problem began
[1:18:20] not for the children of Israel but for
[1:18:23] Pharaoh I'm gonna put it in place I'm
[1:18:35] gonna I'm gonna flip the tables over now
[1:18:37] hey man I mean we can deal with the
[1:18:40] trials because God has taken through us
[1:18:42] through all kinds of trials and
[1:18:43] tribulations he takes care of us but oh
[1:18:46] when somebody don't know your God he's
[1:18:49] in trouble if somebody don't know the
[1:18:53] power of your God he's in trouble
[1:18:56] hallelujah if somebody know don't know
[1:19:00] the right hand of Almighty God he's in
[1:19:02] trouble
[1:19:03] hey man hallelujah to the lamb glory be
[1:19:07] to God hey man as Pharaoh was was in
[1:19:12] trouble from the very beginning amen so
[1:19:19] now let's look at things I want you to
[1:19:22] see the patients that we nut must have
[1:19:24] now we realize that God told Abraham
[1:19:28] nothing was was by surprise God told
[1:19:31] Abraham that his seed would be in
[1:19:34] bondage he said it no surprise it was in
[1:19:39] the word it wasn't in everybody know it
[1:19:42] he was in the scripture you see his seed
[1:19:45] would be in bondage but after 400 years
[1:19:48] they were come out with a strong and
[1:19:53] mighty head
[1:19:55] so it means that the time of bondage had
[1:19:59] a time limit Oh hallelujah and that time
[1:20:05] limit had to be fulfilled but when we
[1:20:15] read here now when Abraham we just read
[1:20:20] it at Genesis 15 and he said unto Abram
[1:20:25] know of a surety that thy seed shall be
[1:20:29] a stranger in the land that is not not
[1:20:33] there see and shall serve them and they
[1:20:36] shall afflict them 400 years 400 years
[1:20:42] he already told Abram was going to
[1:20:44] happen and also that nation listen
[1:20:47] here's the other part of the also that
[1:20:49] nation whom they shall serve I will
[1:20:55] George and afterwards they shall come
[1:21:01] out with a great substance but now we
[1:21:09] read now also in Exodus chapter 12 and
[1:21:12] verse 40 that it a treasonous wise now
[1:21:17] the sojourning of the children of Israel
[1:21:20] who dwelt in Egypt was 430 God told
[1:21:28] Abraham 400 but the total time of their
[1:21:35] bondage was 434 God is a is a God of
[1:21:41] mercy and he's long-suffering so don't
[1:21:45] ever think that God is late God is on
[1:21:48] time don't worry about it
[1:21:50] because until the last predestinated
[1:21:53] seat of God comes in God will hold that
[1:21:59] Exodus until the last predestinated seat
[1:22:03] of God but now listen God was on time
[1:22:06] but Moses disappeared for 40 years he
[1:22:10] was running around running away from the
[1:22:12] Commission
[1:22:13] listen if God tells you to do something
[1:22:16] you might as well give up and do it
[1:22:19] because guess what he's not looking for
[1:22:22] somebody else he won't find you he will
[1:22:26] track you down and he won't have you do
[1:22:29] it because you are his man
[1:22:32] glory be to God hallelujah God's not
[1:22:37] saying ok if you don't want to do it
[1:22:39] I'll find somebody else to do it amen
[1:22:41] amen he was born to be a prophet
[1:22:44] [Applause]
[1:22:46] Amen hallelujah amen glory be to God
[1:22:51] didn't God tell Jeremiah a man before
[1:22:54] you were formed in your mother's womb I
[1:22:56] knew you and ordained you to be a
[1:22:59] prophet to the nation's a man a man
[1:23:03] while you were in your mother's womb God
[1:23:05] had a predestinated seed in your heart
[1:23:08] to do exactly what you're doing here
[1:23:10] today and what you're going to do in the
[1:23:14] future in other words your future in God
[1:23:18] is already history
[1:23:19] did you hear what I'm saying amen so now
[1:23:28] they were sojourning the children of
[1:23:31] Israel was sojourning in the land of
[1:23:32] Egypt amen and you can be seated so
[1:23:36] therefore we see this that they had come
[1:23:41] down and they in the time of Joseph they
[1:23:44] settled in the land of Goshen now I want
[1:23:48] to make a distinction between Goshen and
[1:23:50] Egypt because Egypt is where Pharaoh was
[1:23:54] of course and this is where the covenant
[1:23:57] people was in Goshen the plagues
[1:24:03] that fell upon Egypt God put a wedge
[1:24:08] between Egypt and Goshen these are my
[1:24:17] people
[1:24:19] but I'm going to judge Egypt in a way
[1:24:21] that they have never been judged before
[1:24:25] secondly I want you to notice Pharaoh is
[1:24:30] the biggest liar you can find how many
[1:24:37] times did he say he would let them go so
[1:24:49] now you're dealing with a liar number
[1:24:54] two he's not gonna let you go easy if
[1:24:59] you understand that then we are we're on
[1:25:03] the same wavelength now right now
[1:25:07] because Pharaoh who did not know Joseph
[1:25:11] after while begin to teach the children
[1:25:14] of Israel that they were slaves and they
[1:25:19] after while believe that they were slave
[1:25:22] they loved the leeks and gun
[1:25:25] the onions in the world I don't I don't
[1:25:27] know i don't like leeks and whatever i
[1:25:30] can't talk to nobody after that him the
[1:25:35] leeks and onions in the world i mean it
[1:25:38] back in egypt but now listen here here
[1:25:43] is what i want to say to you
[1:25:46] there was Goshen and then there was a
[1:25:51] but in the land of Goshen where the
[1:25:55] promises of God they were a covenant
[1:25:59] people
[1:26:01] under what covenant it was a covenant of
[1:26:04] circumcision
[1:26:07] they were the children of Abraham and
[1:26:11] Abraham was given a covenant and he
[1:26:15] received the sign of circumcision and
[1:26:18] every child that he had from generation
[1:26:21] to generation had to be circumcised and
[1:26:24] God honored them and that identified
[1:26:27] them as a cold out people or as a
[1:26:30] separated people and God treated them
[1:26:34] like that a man so therefore we realize
[1:26:38] that when the plagues fell nine of the
[1:26:45] plates the Covenant was in effect nine
[1:26:56] of the plagues the Covenant God honored
[1:26:58] to cover but on a tenth flake it was a
[1:27:07] war between life and death so therefore
[1:27:13] you had to have a type of life and life
[1:27:17] always defeats death this is why the
[1:27:24] life of the Lamb you have to be
[1:27:28] identified with the land that you slit
[1:27:31] that you slew
[1:27:32] now just to make this as easy as I can
[1:27:36] people can say well I have the blood I
[1:27:39] killed the lamb I do this I but I don't
[1:27:43] know it's gonna mess up my house you
[1:27:46] know I mean I did have a fresh paint job
[1:27:49] on the outside and I don't want to be
[1:27:51] all messy okay go right ahead and do it
[1:27:56] go right ahead and do it but my point is
[1:28:00] this obedience because they're very
[1:28:04] specific instructions that night if you
[1:28:09] wanted to live you had to follow
[1:28:12] instructions
[1:28:16] clear instructions and full obedience to
[1:28:21] the word what entitles you to the token
[1:28:27] so it doesn't matter if you were in
[1:28:30] message Church it doesn't matter if you
[1:28:32] were okay
[1:28:33] you can show your seal of circumcision
[1:28:35] and so forth that wasn't in effect that
[1:28:37] night when I know brother song so it
[1:28:41] wasn't in effect that night hallelujah
[1:28:44] well I could show you I have a man I'm
[1:28:46] very I've been a staunch to ever since I
[1:28:50] like a man
[1:28:52] my daddy was a priest and whatever it
[1:28:54] meant nothing that night Oh hallelujah
[1:28:59] [Applause]
[1:29:03] what you see we realized that Israel was
[1:29:07] pushed into we realize the land of Egypt
[1:29:11] when they left the land of Canaan it was
[1:29:14] a it was a national force it was a
[1:29:18] famine in the land so they had to go in
[1:29:21] but they did not know Joseph the Pharaoh
[1:29:25] knew not Joseph but God honored them in
[1:29:31] the seal of circumcision rather into
[1:29:33] flesh for 400 years I want to say this
[1:29:38] for 400 years they cried and cried and
[1:29:43] cried and meanwhile God was recording
[1:29:49] every prayer
[1:29:53] every single prayer that was ever
[1:29:56] uttered God was recording it because
[1:30:04] when he come down and told Moses I've
[1:30:06] heard the cries of my people 430 years
[1:30:11] worth of cries Pharaoh had taught them
[1:30:16] already that they were mud dobbers and
[1:30:19] that's they you know you can't accept
[1:30:22] the norm what the devil wants you to
[1:30:24] believe is normal you living as a slave
[1:30:28] is not normal young people if you live
[1:30:37] below your privileges this is not normal
[1:30:42] you've got to understand that greater is
[1:30:46] He that's in you than he that's in the
[1:30:48] world and if you act like a slave live
[1:30:54] like a slave and sleep like a slave
[1:30:57] after why you're gonna believe that you
[1:30:59] are a slave and you wake up early in the
[1:31:02] morning with a routine and you just make
[1:31:04] Pharaoh cities and so forth and he's
[1:31:06] happy stay a slave but because this is
[1:31:09] what they were taught oh but here comes
[1:31:13] Moses amen now listen God was fixing to
[1:31:19] redeem his people now the reason I chose
[1:31:24] this text or this title was redemption
[1:31:29] by blood and by power there can be no
[1:31:36] redemption without blood
[1:31:38] you all know that but the necessity of
[1:31:42] power was needed because fara was a
[1:31:45] hardhead
[1:31:48] God had redeemed his people by telling
[1:31:52] them and instructing them to slay a lamb
[1:31:55] and they had to be identified with the
[1:31:59] lamb a man and put the blood on the
[1:32:03] doorpost
[1:32:05] because it was coming in Death Angel now
[1:32:08] I'm going to say this that you that
[1:32:12] revelation had to be followed word by
[1:32:15] word by word by words those instructions
[1:32:19] you couldn't know you couldn't go out
[1:32:22] that night and say well death angel I am
[1:32:25] the Holy Ghost it wouldn't have worked
[1:32:33] you're as good as a dead man
[1:32:35] I am the token really okay show me the
[1:32:49] token I don't I don't want to hear
[1:32:52] whether oh you have it or so is in your
[1:32:54] pocket show it to me
[1:32:56] and when I see the Blood I pass over you
[1:33:00] or it beats our God there's so many
[1:33:03] people that talk and talk and talk and
[1:33:05] talk
[1:33:05] Oh bless God I have the Holy Ghost I
[1:33:07] have the Holy Ghost and there is no life
[1:33:09] let me start preaching here tonight
[1:33:11] amen there is no life they want to kill
[1:33:14] you they hate you there
[1:33:15] all kinds of bitterness in the heart
[1:33:18] amen they run you down where is the love
[1:33:20] now is come down to the love we must
[1:33:25] love one another
[1:33:28] [Applause]
[1:33:29] we must act like Christ be like Christ
[1:33:32] talk like Christ nor because glory be to
[1:33:36] God hey man no one beats our God
[1:33:41] hallelujah
[1:33:43] so therefore now notice I'm gonna I have
[1:33:48] a few minutes left but I'm trying to
[1:33:50] keep it short
[1:33:52] now let's look at the plagues down in a
[1:33:54] Goshen God had provided a man a prophet
[1:33:59] for the exodus of his people thank God
[1:34:03] for the prophet that has covered
[1:34:06] whenever a prophet comes on the scene
[1:34:08] especially the prophet of this last days
[1:34:11] you know that there is an exodus coming
[1:34:14] and not only that if the things are
[1:34:17] going to get worse and worse and worse
[1:34:19] and worse and worse and guess what Satan
[1:34:21] is gonna make your life miserable he's
[1:34:23] gonna make your life miserable and he's
[1:34:26] not gonna let you go Oh devil why are
[1:34:28] you I thought I was he's not gonna let
[1:34:30] you go
[1:34:32] you know why he's a liar
[1:34:36] [Music]
[1:34:37] today you shout and glorify God
[1:34:40] hallelujah and the devil tells you
[1:34:42] tonight oh I'm gonna let you go and
[1:34:44] tomorrow he has you again amen
[1:34:50] oh I overcome this habit a man okay I'll
[1:34:52] let you go and tomorrow he has you right
[1:34:54] back where he was because he is a liar
[1:34:57] and the only thing that will break the
[1:35:03] devil's power is a power of Almighty God
[1:35:07] Redemption by power glory be to God amen
[1:35:13] but don't think it's strange because God
[1:35:15] has hardened Pharaoh's heart God so
[1:35:22] desired to have him hardened in such a
[1:35:25] way that he won't let you go you know
[1:35:29] why because God has a plan for for
[1:35:32] Pharaoh he does he does now listen
[1:35:36] listen if he had let the children of
[1:35:38] Israel go in the third plague 4th plague
[1:35:41] whatever okay they would have gone and
[1:35:44] they would have you know but God
[1:35:45] wouldn't feel that the job was done he
[1:35:52] had bigger plans he had bigger plans for
[1:35:55] Pharaoh
[1:35:58] and he was gonna entrap him in his own
[1:36:02] plan he was gonna entrap him in his own
[1:36:06] hardness of his heart but now let's look
[1:36:10] let's look at Egypt and let's look at
[1:36:12] Goshen let's go are you are you with me
[1:36:16] okay young people are you with me I hope
[1:36:19] your understanding is because I just
[1:36:20] want to bring it down to your level so
[1:36:22] you'll understand
[1:36:23] so now God has provided our Goshen and
[1:36:26] as in Egypt as well and the fight is
[1:36:30] always any man God will protect you and
[1:36:33] the plagues will not come nigh your
[1:36:36] dwelling as long as you are in Goshen if
[1:36:41] you hang around in Egypt
[1:36:43] well you're on your own the Covenant was
[1:36:46] in effect in Goshen Amen
[1:36:51] because when the plagues had come down
[1:36:54] and Moses had to ask
[1:36:58] nine times thus saith the Lord let my
[1:37:02] people go oh but this time he come
[1:37:06] within his enforcer see Moses words he
[1:37:14] could speak it but it had to be made
[1:37:15] manifested to make sure that he Pharaoh
[1:37:18] knew and of course the Egyptian
[1:37:22] magicians could imitate us a few but it
[1:37:26] came a time they couldn't imitate this
[1:37:29] no impersonation there's coming a time
[1:37:32] they're not going to look the life
[1:37:34] cannot be impersonated you either have
[1:37:36] it or you don't you either have the life
[1:37:39] or you don't and it is the life behind
[1:37:42] the name that makes the demons tremble
[1:37:45] [Applause]
[1:37:49] glory be to God but now listen you can
[1:37:55] be seated what was his message thus say
[1:37:58] the Lord and let my people go and
[1:38:00] brother and the Bible says that his
[1:38:03] people see was also considered God's Son
[1:38:09] son was Israel so Pharaoh was holding
[1:38:14] his son now that's more personal now uh
[1:38:19] if your son is bound and being kept
[1:38:22] captive somewhere as a father oh you're
[1:38:26] gonna do everything you can as a father
[1:38:31] and it's a shame that this this man
[1:38:33] who's doing the kidnapping or holding
[1:38:36] them back though know the god of Joseph
[1:38:42] you don't know what I can do hallelujah
[1:38:46] so therefore the enforcer was with him
[1:38:52] so young people understand never think
[1:38:57] that this way is going to be easy it's
[1:39:01] impossible it's gonna get harder and
[1:39:05] harder and harder you know why because
[1:39:06] that God has hardened Pharaoh's heart
[1:39:12] but you're coming out now you're coming
[1:39:17] out he's gonna make you make bricks
[1:39:20] without straw but you're coming out he's
[1:39:26] gonna put the pressure on you in such a
[1:39:28] way you don't know where you're coming
[1:39:29] or going but you're coming out you're
[1:39:32] coming out
[1:39:34] hallelujah you're coming out glory be to
[1:39:38] God you're coming out now listen Gloria
[1:39:45] so now let's look at the place for nine
[1:39:48] plagues it was a plague of water it was
[1:39:54] turned to blood and I would imagine the
[1:39:57] water utility company down in Egypt they
[1:40:01] could not figure this out this is beyond
[1:40:05] our ability to the water failed all of a
[1:40:13] sudden frogs come down only because
[1:40:15] Pharaoh hardened his heart frogs come
[1:40:18] down lice and gnats and flies and
[1:40:20] livestock
[1:40:22] Boyle's diseases the CDC was going crazy
[1:40:28] never seen these cases before no answer
[1:40:34] why you can't figure out god hail hail
[1:40:41] come down like never before the weather
[1:40:45] forecasts in Egypt the forecasters were
[1:40:48] baffled they'd never seen such hail but
[1:40:55] in Goshen so here's what I want to say
[1:41:10] wow the plagues are falling there is no
[1:41:15] reason you can't praise God if you are
[1:41:18] in Goshen don't worry about the world
[1:41:25] you are in Goshen no repeater God
[1:41:30] hallelujah
[1:41:30] did you read the paper this is what
[1:41:33] happened to Joe I read it but Frank
[1:41:35] Peter God he has kept me there has been
[1:41:39] no hail there have been no plagues God
[1:41:42] will take care of his own don't worry
[1:41:44] about it no way be to God a many many
[1:41:49] man glory glory no damage to their crops
[1:41:56] no damage amen to their livestock and
[1:42:01] everything else because God honored the
[1:42:03] covenant of circumcision but now let's
[1:42:08] get down to the tenth plague which I
[1:42:13] believe this is the reason why we have
[1:42:15] gathered tonight under the solemn nosov
[1:42:20] this moment because there is something
[1:42:26] that is now required of everybody
[1:42:31] both Goshen and Egypt God the wedge is
[1:42:36] no longer there because God demanded a
[1:42:42] token and he made a way and this is all
[1:42:46] in type you know he made a way for the
[1:42:50] deliverance of his children and it was
[1:42:54] through the blood sacrifice of a lamb
[1:43:00] that was without blemish watch what kind
[1:43:04] of thing you offer to God it has to be
[1:43:06] without blemish just don't throw any
[1:43:09] lamb on there it has to be without
[1:43:10] blemish it has to be your very best or
[1:43:13] don't put it don't offer it at all
[1:43:16] hallow your very best don't offer it at
[1:43:18] all Amen but you see and it was the you
[1:43:23] aid it a very specific instruction and
[1:43:26] had a with fire and bitter herbs and
[1:43:30] everything else and guess what also he
[1:43:33] told them to eat it with your shoes on
[1:43:38] eat it in a hurry
[1:43:41] you know why I'm gonna tell you why
[1:43:45] because God knew that this plague
[1:43:49] Pharaoh wasn't gonna let you go he was
[1:43:53] gonna run you out of each other but
[1:43:55] because he couldn't take you no more and
[1:44:00] you had better be able to run you had
[1:44:02] better be able to walk eat it in haste
[1:44:06] glory be to God because let me tell you
[1:44:09] something between the tenth and the last
[1:44:12] plague of death and the Exodus there
[1:44:15] wasn't much time it won't last long but
[1:44:18] it will be here Oh hallelujah
[1:44:22] it won't last long amen is a token
[1:44:26] display nor would be to God the last
[1:44:30] plague was a man the plague of death and
[1:44:33] the token is the Holy Ghost today amen
[1:44:37] now let me just show you something that
[1:44:38] I brought with me because amen I hope
[1:44:41] I'm not boring you but you may be seated
[1:44:43] just a second just want you to
[1:44:44] understand this now you see this here I
[1:44:48] I brought this with me I had an actual
[1:44:50] coin back home of my own but since I
[1:44:54] moved I have it in a box somewhere and I
[1:44:57] couldn't find my my coin but this here
[1:45:00] is a New York City Transit coin it's a
[1:45:05] token that's what it is
[1:45:07] okay it's not money it's a token now
[1:45:13] this the way this worked years ago now
[1:45:17] you could have had all the money in the
[1:45:19] world but it wouldn't get you on the
[1:45:24] train there was a procedure you had to
[1:45:31] take the money that you had and this was
[1:45:34] a cost and you had to take it to the
[1:45:37] token clerk and a token clerk will
[1:45:41] examine your money make sure it's not
[1:45:44] counterfeit make sure it's enough and he
[1:45:52] would in turn give you a token which
[1:45:56] qualified you to ride the train now this
[1:46:00] token was a little smaller than a
[1:46:03] quarter or you know 25 cents and of
[1:46:06] course bigger than ten cents it was made
[1:46:09] a certain dimensions where only the
[1:46:12] Machine only this dimension can fit in
[1:46:15] the machine and when you drop the token
[1:46:18] in the slot and it went through his
[1:46:22] mechanism and so forth and if it fit if
[1:46:25] you dropped a quarter wouldn't fit it
[1:46:27] geez get jammed so when it fit and it
[1:46:31] reached down to trip a switch and then
[1:46:33] it releases the turns
[1:46:35] you go through you were through you got
[1:46:41] over to the other side you couldn't buy
[1:46:44] a token on the train you had to go to
[1:46:48] the token booth so so today the blood
[1:46:57] you see brother branham said today the
[1:47:00] Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost is the token
[1:47:02] and you've got to take the blood and
[1:47:06] present it to the token clerk to make
[1:47:10] sure you've done it correctly and he in
[1:47:12] turn gives you the Holy Ghost which in
[1:47:15] turns gives you the right a meant to
[1:47:18] ride a train and you wouldn't buy a
[1:47:22] token unless you are traveling somewhere
[1:47:25] I know where I'm going hey you there be
[1:47:35] no need to buy a token unless you're
[1:47:37] traveling somewhere I'm going home on
[1:47:41] the morning train Oh hallelujah
[1:47:49] listen there's going to be a rapture
[1:47:52] amen and all this forgery and all these
[1:47:57] different things that we hear today and
[1:48:00] I am this and I am that and surely if
[1:48:02] there's going to be a rapture I am gonna
[1:48:05] be in it amen and everyone else is not
[1:48:08] listen that is a lie because the only
[1:48:11] thing that will make it in the rapture
[1:48:13] amen if you have the token don't tell me
[1:48:19] you are the token don't tell me you are
[1:48:21] the Holy Ghost
[1:48:22] don't tell me Oh bless God I belong to a
[1:48:25] certain church that qualifies me to get
[1:48:27] on the train that don't qualifies you to
[1:48:29] get anywhere but do you have the token
[1:48:35] you already took aha hey man okay years
[1:48:41] ago years later I'm just I'm gonna get
[1:48:44] back to something years later we're not
[1:48:47] this dystopian was when I was a little
[1:48:49] kid you know and I have to confess you
[1:48:52] know confess is confession is good
[1:48:54] because I can confess to the people that
[1:48:57] love me and they forgive me half the
[1:49:00] times I didn't have the money for for
[1:49:02] token so I would I would jump the
[1:49:04] turnstile I'm forgiven
[1:49:13] but it had to be done a certain way the
[1:49:16] Train had to be there if the Train
[1:49:18] wasn't there you couldn't jump the
[1:49:20] turnstile they're gonna catch you you
[1:49:21] know you time it the train comes into
[1:49:24] the station that you jump the turnstile
[1:49:26] you get in then you ride and you feel
[1:49:28] convicted later but but there won't be
[1:49:37] no no jumping the turnstile this way
[1:49:39] they will not be no jumping a term staff
[1:49:46] and when I was working for IBM years ago
[1:49:49] and I they change his whole system it
[1:49:53] was no longer talking it was a what to
[1:49:55] call Metro pass and you bought a Monthly
[1:49:57] Pass and it was a little different
[1:50:01] because you had to have the pass on you
[1:50:07] at all times if you got on that train
[1:50:10] you had to have the pass
[1:50:12] now you could know the conductor or the
[1:50:15] ticket collector your best friend but
[1:50:19] when he comes down the aisle he's gonna
[1:50:22] ask you where's your ticket so you see
[1:50:26] there is no favoritism or there's no
[1:50:28] friendship or that he has to do his job
[1:50:30] I don't care how mad you you you get and
[1:50:34] said yeah I have it it's in my pocket
[1:50:36] it doesn't belong in your pocket let me
[1:50:39] see the ticket
[1:50:42] well I showed it to you yesterday don't
[1:50:45] you remember let me see your ticket
[1:50:47] today
[1:50:47] and I remember the voice that would boom
[1:50:50] out through the the train carts and says
[1:50:54] the ticket you know collect or whatever
[1:50:57] he would say Oh tickets please tickets
[1:50:59] please everybody ticket and there were
[1:51:02] times I didn't have it I left it at home
[1:51:04] and I'm I'm having my battles I'm
[1:51:06] thinking whoa what am I gonna tell him
[1:51:08] guess what I paid every time if you
[1:51:11] leave your token or if you leave your
[1:51:13] ticket you will pay so the truth is this
[1:51:17] it's what I'm saying don't ever leave
[1:51:19] the house without the total because you
[1:51:25] will pay you will pay so therefore in
[1:51:30] the land of Egypt there was great
[1:51:32] plagues but I'm going to tell you
[1:51:36] something one powerful plague that had
[1:51:39] come finally in the land of Egypt is as
[1:51:43] a judgment and plague of darkness for
[1:51:48] three days they couldn't even look at
[1:51:49] one another they couldn't see one
[1:51:51] another the utility grid went no power
[1:52:01] but in Goshen there was light in Goshen
[1:52:06] and don't you ever think I'm just gonna
[1:52:11] say this you're here tonight because of
[1:52:14] the grace of Almighty God
[1:52:21] you may sit there tonight and say well
[1:52:24] God has not done anything for me
[1:52:27] that's a devil's lie the point that
[1:52:33] you're here tonight shows that he's been
[1:52:35] with you oh but I don't I don't have
[1:52:44] everything that I want from God God has
[1:52:47] been with you God promised to provide
[1:52:52] your needs according to your riches and
[1:52:55] his riches in glory not your once we
[1:52:57] want a lot of things and we don't get
[1:53:01] what we want and we're upset but I'm
[1:53:04] gonna tell you something our God has
[1:53:07] been never ever forget to thank God for
[1:53:09] the little things and everything because
[1:53:12] it's His grace that you are here and he
[1:53:15] has kept you this far brother Ovid had
[1:53:20] talked about we know knowing each other
[1:53:24] 35 years I'm wondering where did the
[1:53:26] time go
[1:53:28] you can't plan that he's been with you
[1:53:31] and times when you thought you're gonna
[1:53:33] give up and you God he lifts you up and
[1:53:44] these are the things you have to thank
[1:53:46] on tour I'm gonna tell you something I
[1:53:53] like what brother Branham says about a
[1:53:56] righteous man can I say it he said a
[1:54:03] righteous man is not a sinless man
[1:54:07] but he's a man that knows how to get
[1:54:10] right with God he knows how to get right
[1:54:20] with God and David was a man after God's
[1:54:24] own heart and David murdered and he
[1:54:27] committed adultery and everything else
[1:54:29] but he was a man after God's own heart
[1:54:34] and that's a great mystery you know I'm
[1:54:37] going to tell you something because
[1:54:39] there's a lot of people oh if they only
[1:54:41] would make right with God then it's all
[1:54:44] over a man you get right with God you
[1:54:47] want to be you know on speaking terms
[1:54:49] with God but now listen the token clerk
[1:54:53] he had to check out the money and so
[1:54:54] forth
[1:54:55] amen but now if you look notice here how
[1:54:58] I don't know if you can see it good for
[1:55:02] one fair good good for one fair now I
[1:55:09] think the natural speaks of the
[1:55:11] spiritual as well now the Holy Ghost you
[1:55:14] cannot ride Your Mama's experience you
[1:55:19] cannot ride your papa's experience the
[1:55:22] Holy Ghost experience is an individual
[1:55:26] experience your mama has to have it your
[1:55:32] sister has to have it your brother has
[1:55:34] to have it
[1:55:35] Amen your uncle tutu has to have it
[1:55:37] everyone has to have it Amen because
[1:55:40] it's good for one fair hey man you can't
[1:55:47] rest on your mama's goodness or your
[1:55:49] father's goodness oh my father's our
[1:55:51] deacon whatever it doesn't matter
[1:55:53] do you have the token do you have the
[1:55:58] token and if you haven't taken out of
[1:56:01] your pocket and show it because it has
[1:56:05] to be displayed now I'm gonna get to
[1:56:08] another part here amen
[1:56:10] the token displaying many you see many
[1:56:14] people all bless God I have the Holy
[1:56:16] Ghost amen in church they're happy they
[1:56:20] go to school if
[1:56:21] in the pocket ain't nobody know what
[1:56:24] they are you you you go to work and
[1:56:30] nobody knows who you are I mean it you
[1:56:34] go to you go to pray for the food
[1:56:43] because you don't want to feel out of
[1:56:45] place you know you want to be accepted
[1:56:48] that's the natural mind you see that's
[1:56:50] the natural human spirit you hide the
[1:56:53] token or you hide whatever I'm gonna
[1:56:55] tell you something once you get the Holy
[1:56:57] Ghost I doubt very much if you hide it
[1:56:58] you want everybody to know hallelujah
[1:57:03] you're so on fire for God hey man
[1:57:06] there's not a devil that can keep you
[1:57:08] silent
[1:57:09] a man now we're gonna find out
[1:57:12] amen and here's the question I have and
[1:57:15] I don't want to you know cause any waves
[1:57:17] and so forth but I'm gonna tell you
[1:57:19] something God doesn't give the Holy
[1:57:21] Ghost to take it from you I'm gonna say
[1:57:25] it now can I say it God doesn't give you
[1:57:28] the Holy Ghost to take it from you
[1:57:31] so many people I've heard over the years
[1:57:34] I mean Oh bless God I have the Holy
[1:57:35] Ghost and so and they're nowhere to be
[1:57:37] found today something is wrong with this
[1:57:44] picture because my Bible says Amen that
[1:57:50] you are sealed until the day of your
[1:57:53] Redemption breathe not the Holy Spirit
[1:57:59] of God whereby we're sealed until the
[1:58:02] day of redemption you can see that man
[1:58:05] thirty years from now he'll still be the
[1:58:08] same man he still had the same fire he
[1:58:10] still be the same person he's still
[1:58:13] serving God glory be to God hallelujah
[1:58:17] [Applause]
[1:58:18] amen amen glory beats our God and many
[1:58:22] people have forgotten the life you know
[1:58:23] the life the life the life you don't
[1:58:25] they don't touch that no more they don't
[1:58:27] even touch the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:58:29] no more they'd rather say you have it
[1:58:32] already you are it that is the highest
[1:58:38] form of intellectualism I want you to
[1:58:43] tell the Death Angel I am it see how far
[1:58:46] you get listen I'm trying to get I'm
[1:58:49] trying to be straight up and now Amen
[1:58:52] that hour is late and we must have the
[1:58:54] real thing and if this structure was
[1:59:02] built on the correct foundation that's
[1:59:06] why brother Branham came back on
[1:59:09] blasphemous names and made sure that he
[1:59:12] identified the foundation part as the
[1:59:16] Holy Ghost because only the Holy Ghost
[1:59:21] can hold this body work word hallelujah
[1:59:27] it is the cornerstone and now we are at
[1:59:32] the headstone and the stone which the
[1:59:35] builders have refused down here has
[1:59:39] become the headstone of the corner there
[1:59:42] is no way to ignore it there is no way
[1:59:45] you have to have the Holy Ghost Oh
[1:59:50] hallelujah glory glory glory amen
[2:00:01] but now listen I have ten minutes are
[2:00:04] you still with me
[2:00:06] amen this is to our young people just
[2:00:09] want to make sure you understand because
[2:00:11] you know God this was an ordinance that
[2:00:14] was born in Egypt now this was a feast
[2:00:20] the Passover because God wanted to do
[2:00:25] something as a memorial
[2:00:29] to demonstrate his power and for them to
[2:00:33] put it in a book that when their
[2:00:36] children would ask what does this mean
[2:00:39] and what does that mean or what does
[2:00:41] this mean let him know what happened in
[2:00:44] Egypt let him know what a mighty God you
[2:00:47] serve and guess what down when Joshua
[2:00:51] just before us he just before he crossed
[2:00:53] over into the promised land those young
[2:00:56] people they were not circumcised yet and
[2:01:00] what happened they kept the Passover
[2:01:01] there just before crossing over to the
[2:01:05] promised land they had to circumcise a
[2:01:07] man the young people because they had
[2:01:10] not been circumcised in the wilderness
[2:01:11] and there they had feasts and they
[2:01:14] talked about amen the mighty God of
[2:01:16] Israel a man just before they went into
[2:01:20] the new land to encourage them amen what
[2:01:23] a mighty God they served lower it beats
[2:01:26] our God but now you can be seated now
[2:01:29] let's hurry very specific instructions
[2:01:36] the sign a man had to be displayed
[2:01:39] outside that's number one don't tell me
[2:01:43] you have it oh yeah but you know it's in
[2:01:45] your pocket whatever it's okay you know
[2:01:47] no it's not okay
[2:01:49] this is lifetime heard a lot of messages
[2:01:54] over time but you see brother Branham
[2:01:58] said what we need today in
[2:02:01] Jeffersonville Indiana is thousands
[2:02:07] that's the funding that shakes the devil
[2:02:10] and the devil gets so disturbed by
[2:02:15] having someone manifest that life he
[2:02:22] shakes he shakes in a way that oh it's a
[2:02:27] life remember the power of the life
[2:02:30] Jesus was walking through the tones that
[2:02:33] you know in the place of God era and
[2:02:35] there was a drama there
[2:02:39] screamed out have you come to cast me
[2:02:42] out before my time doesn't never spoke
[2:02:47] to him walking but the devil could feel
[2:02:54] there's some kind of life there
[2:02:57] oh he felt uncomfortable he for all he
[2:03:01] was he felt in trouble
[2:03:04] have you come to cast me out before my
[2:03:07] time and Jesus didn't even say a word he
[2:03:12] was just passing through
[2:03:13] okay going to the swine's you know this
[2:03:16] wise when they jumped into water and
[2:03:18] whatever and they got angry with Jesus
[2:03:21] for doing that but let me tell you
[2:03:23] another thing the life is very important
[2:03:27] the genuine huh life of the Holy Spirit
[2:03:31] Paul rather yeah Paul was in the city
[2:03:37] casting out Devils and here healing the
[2:03:39] sick because the life was in him he had
[2:03:44] the experience of the Holy Ghost the
[2:03:46] life was in him so he could lay his
[2:03:52] hands on people who were sick
[2:03:55] demon-possessed and everything and they
[2:03:57] came home streaming out they could they
[2:04:00] were commanded to leave and they left
[2:04:04] but they were vagabond Jews in the area
[2:04:09] hmm looked at what power does he have i
[2:04:16] wonder how how this is done hmm
[2:04:20] I see first he says he laid his hands
[2:04:23] and he ended and he cries to somebody
[2:04:32] we can do that we can do that we could
[2:04:38] do that so they got together they got
[2:04:42] together one day okay here's a case we
[2:04:45] could pray for they got together as it
[2:04:50] is now double
[2:04:54] I urge or thee in the name of Jesus who
[2:05:02] Paul preaches come out of them come out
[2:05:06] of this person he heard a voice
[2:05:13] yeah well sitting right there he wasn't
[2:05:17] moving he had a few questions for those
[2:05:22] that were trying to crack a say here's
[2:05:24] the question Jesus I know Paul I know -
[2:05:38] that man makes me nervous
[2:05:43] Jesus oh but who are you what made the
[2:05:51] difference it was a life that was in
[2:05:54] there

[2:05:58] shake glory be to God that Devils will
[2:06:02] shake and shake and shake hey man they
[2:06:05] get so uncomfortable listen let me tell
[2:06:07] you something that devil should be
[2:06:08] uncomfortable here tonight every last
[2:06:10] one of the devil should be uncomfortable
[2:06:13] because he is sitting next to a son of
[2:06:16] God now are we the sons of God it does
[2:06:22] not yet up here what we shall be but we
[2:06:24] know now right now right now well the
[2:06:29] cancers and tumors and diabetes it
[2:06:33] doesn't matter they're shaken here

[2:08:00] guys are doing their best to undo and
[2:08:04] destroy intellectualism let me tell you
[2:08:09] something you can't make somebody an
[2:08:11] apostle you can't make anyone an
[2:08:16] evangelist whatever a pastor whatever
[2:08:18] you have God has got to recognize that
[2:08:22] person God has put in the church some
[2:08:25] evangelists some prophets some teachers
[2:08:28] God God God so my warning to you is
[2:08:38] watch these guys watch watch these guys
[2:08:48] see an closing now the token for the
[2:08:51] believer today is the Holy Ghost not a
[2:08:53] blood a chemistry but the Holy Ghost the
[2:08:57] Holy Spirit that is a token that God
[2:09:01] requires of the church today God must
[2:09:05] see this token he must see it in every
[2:09:10] one of us now they were fixing to leave
[2:09:15] I have one minute I'm just gonna stop
[2:09:20] the clock here just not gonna go further
[2:09:23] stop I don't want it to ring but now
[2:09:27] they were fixing to leave an exodus now
[2:09:30] I'm going to tell you something your
[2:09:32] battle your trials your tribulation and
[2:09:35] what you're going through now is are not
[2:09:36] worthy to be compared not worthy to be
[2:09:42] compared with the glory and the shouting
[2:09:45] and devorah that awaits you yes it got
[2:09:51] harder and harder and harder and harder
[2:09:53] and harder but there is still not worthy
[2:09:56] to be compared now let me tell you what
[2:10:05] God was doing all along to bring them to
[2:10:08] an expected end now this was planned did
[2:10:14] you know the devil has a planning God
[2:10:15] has a plan and one plan is going to work
[2:10:18] I believe in God's plan I don't know how
[2:10:23] what you believe one plan is going to
[2:10:25] work one plan is going to work in one
[2:10:27] plan only so God had already
[2:10:31] predestinated for this to come to an
[2:10:33] expected end he hardened the Pharaoh's
[2:10:36] heart because he didn't just want them
[2:10:38] to be in darkness that's they didn't
[2:10:41] want he didn't want them just to have
[2:10:42] frogs and so forth you know look you
[2:10:45] have troubled my people for over 400
[2:10:49] years I'm going to punish you I'm gonna
[2:10:53] make you cry you're gonna you're gonna
[2:10:56] regret the day that you ever even met an
[2:11:00] Israelite and you're gonna find out with
[2:11:08] a mighty hand what a mighty God we serve
[2:11:13] glory Peter Kostis a man so God set a
[2:11:18] trap for them you know what the trap was
[2:11:21] he opened a way for you and the devil
[2:11:26] thought he could still follow you
[2:11:32] and here you are but God's timing is
[2:11:38] perfect
[2:11:39] listen when God makes a way for you is
[2:11:42] for you is that for you and the devils
[2:11:45] and your tumors and your trials where
[2:11:50] you go they cannot go glory be to say
[2:11:54] Amen somebody oh man how on earth is
[2:12:02] gonna open up the door for you and the
[2:12:04] devil come to slip right by that's not

[2:12:11] sure that all come all the Egyptian army
[2:12:13] come on come come on
[2:12:15] follow them chase them a man and let me
[2:12:19] tell you something the stress levels of
[2:12:21] of the Israelites were oh very high to
[2:12:25] the end because they were running for
[2:12:27] their life even down through the Red Sea
[2:12:30] oh but when the time of delivers had
[2:12:33] come listen here your mind battles you
[2:12:38] probably know it by name

[2:13:00] tormented you today you will see that no
[2:13:06] more

[2:13:16] because when they got almost to the
[2:13:19] other side and the last predestinated
[2:13:22] seat crossover here comes God began to
[2:13:28] let go of the waters and horses and
[2:13:32] Egyptian army was drown now let me ask

[2:17:27] other help he didn't know the pressure
[2:17:30] was coming from people and Moses said
[2:17:33] unto the people fear you not but stand
[2:17:37] still and see
[2:17:43] the salvation of the Lord which he will
[2:17:48] show you showed to you today for the

[2:19:31] right
[2:19:32] trains leaving to rapture Express and I
[2:19:38] don't want my ticket to be invalid I

[2:19:43] wanted to be checked by the token clerk
[2:19:45] I want him to check my everything that's
[2:19:49] required that when he sees the blood
[2:19:53] Jesus he'll pass over us remember the
[2:19:58] Covenant was in effect for nine plagues
[2:20:01] but this last one that included
[2:20:04] everybody and this is why brother
[2:20:07] Branham said it is it was the capping
[2:20:10] off of my entire ministry
[2:20:14] this message of the Tolkien I love him
[2:20:20] do you love him have you ever thought
[2:20:23] where would you be if it wasn't for his
[2:20:27] love that's that that's something to
[2:20:32] think about I remember trying to ask God
[2:20:39] to help me and there seems like no help
[2:20:41] was coming around I said lord I can't do
[2:20:43] this no more
[2:20:44] and I wanted to give up but something

[2:23:09] somehow it would have been a blessing to
[2:23:12] your people somebody who would catch
[2:23:15] faith and not only faith but the
[2:23:18] importance of applying the token
[2:23:22] not only applying it but displaying the
[2:23:25] token oh because it is the only thing
[2:23:29] that will be able to stand in these days
[2:23:32] oh it is because this is a showdown Oh
[2:23:37] the last plague was a plague of death
[2:23:40] and we see death all over the place I'm
