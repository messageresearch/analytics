[49:27] expectation for great things are you on
[49:28] expectation this morning

[49:33] or rather let me get the scriptures
[49:34] first psalm 71
[49:37] saint luke 21
[49:40] and hebrews 12.
[49:44] psalm 71 deliver me
[49:46] in thy righteousness
[49:48] and cause me to escape
[49:51] incline thine air unto me and save me
[49:55] saint luke 21 and reading from verse 32
[49:59] verily i say unto you this generation
[50:01] shall not pass away till all be
[50:04] fulfilled
[50:06] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[50:08] words shall not pass away
[50:11] and take heed to yourselves lest at any
[50:13] time your hearts be overcharged with
[50:16] fighting and drunkenness and cares of
[50:18] this life so that they come upon you
[50:21] unawares in other words be prepared
[50:23] always huh for as a snare shall it come
[50:25] on all them that dwell on the face of
[50:27] the whole earth watch ye therefore and
[50:30] pray always that you might be accounted
[50:33] worthy to escape
[50:35] all these things that shall come to pass
[50:38] and to stand before the son of man and
[50:40] our last reading
[50:43] hebrews 12 25 see that ye refuse not him
[50:46] that speak it for if they escape not who
[50:50] refuse him that speak on it much more
[50:52] shall not we escape if we turn away from
[50:55] him that speaketh from heaven whose
[50:58] voice then shook the earth but now he
[51:01] had promised saying yet once more i
[51:04] shake not the earth only but also heaven
[51:08] and this would yet once more signify it
[51:12] the removing of those things that are
[51:14] shaken as of things that are made that
[51:16] those things which cannot be shaken may
[51:18] remain wherefore we receive we receiving
[51:22] a kingdom which cannot be moved let us
[51:24] have grace whereby we may serve god
[51:27] acceptably with reverence and godly fear
[51:30] for our god is a consuming fire may the
[51:33] lord have a blessing to the reading of
[51:34] his word you may be seated this morning
[51:38] for a title this morning the way
[51:41] of escape
[51:43] the way of escape
[51:45] anybody looking to leave this place
[51:47] leave this world behind leave all these
[51:50] troubles behind leave all these
[51:52] pressures and stresses and every day
[51:54] it's a new thing every week it's a new
[51:56] thing every with this a new every month
[51:59] is a new situation i was sharing with my
[52:01] wife this morning how they are now two
[52:03] sub-variants and it's is every day is a
[52:05] new thing it's an it's a new issue it's
[52:07] a new challenge it's a new problem and
[52:09] and and that's fine because that's what
[52:11] the scripture tells us we're supposed to
[52:12] have is is the way things are but god
[52:15] has a way of escape
[52:17] there's a way to get away from all these
[52:19] things there's a way to get away from
[52:21] all the troubles and get away from all
[52:22] the worries and get away from all the
[52:24] situations in your life and hallelujah
[52:28] he gave us power to overcome and he gave
[52:30] us power to survive and power to make it
[52:32] and power to stand in power to have a
[52:34] testimony and the word comes to remind
[52:37] us that we are not creatures of time but
[52:39] we are creatures of eternity that are
[52:41] trapped in time and because we are
[52:43] trapped in time they has to be a way for
[52:45] us to leave time and get back to
[52:47] eternity but the devil's job is not to
[52:50] make that easy the devil's job is to
[52:52] make that as difficult as possible and
[52:54] because of this there needs to be an
[52:56] opportunity to escape but jesus is
[52:58] saying but you have to watch and do
[53:00] certain things so you could be counted
[53:02] worthy to escape because the ass this
[53:05] escape that we're talking about this
[53:06] morning is not for anybody and everybody
[53:09] it's an escape to those that are counted
[53:11] worthy so i want to be counted worthy so
[53:14] i could escape escape the corruption of
[53:16] this body escape the corruption of the
[53:18] mind escape the corruption of technology
[53:21] escape the corruption of this body this
[53:24] this body that is given trouble every
[53:26] other day is a new issue a new a pain a
[53:29] new situation your mind and all these
[53:31] things but
[53:33] there's a way of escape
[53:35] a way to leave this place a way to leave
[53:37] it all behind and you have to want to
[53:39] leave it all behind you can be so
[53:41] comfortable
[53:42] that it it it becomes something that you
[53:44] don't mind doing no it's it's an escape
[53:47] it's not a way to leave i'm not talking
[53:49] about leaving you know i'm talking about
[53:50] escape because there's a difference
[53:52] between leaving and escaping when you
[53:54] leave something you can go back to it
[53:55] but when you escape it means you don't
[53:57] want to go back to it
[53:58] can the church say amen we're talking
[54:00] about escaping this corruption in this
[54:03] world you don't want nothing to do with
[54:05] it hallelujah oh blessed be the name of
[54:08] the lord i was having a conversation
[54:09] with over yesterday and we were talking
[54:11] about leaving and departing because you
[54:13] could leave but you still have
[54:14] connections
[54:16] but when you depart it means you're
[54:17] ready to want to go back there you know
[54:19] hallelujah you don't want to go back
[54:20] goodbye world you're burning the bridge
[54:22] behind you you don't want nobody to
[54:24] chase you to find you because you want
[54:26] to get out of where you were before so
[54:29] hallelujah so we know god promised a way
[54:32] of escape and in the message god
[54:34] provided away brother branham said on
[54:36] god always before he sends judgment do
[54:38] you know judgment is guaranteed do you
[54:40] know judgment is already set there's
[54:42] nothing going to stop the judgment
[54:44] but before he sends judgment he always
[54:47] makes a way of escape out of every trial
[54:50] god makes a way of escapes before he
[54:52] sends his judgment i must first say
[54:55] before he sends judgment he always sends
[54:57] mercy oh hallelujah but ibraham said in
[55:00] that same message there's not a bit of
[55:03] need of anyone going to hell
[55:06] when god has made a provided way of
[55:08] escape he said you can't help being a
[55:10] sinner you can't help but he was born a
[55:12] sinner but you can help staying a sinner
[55:15] oh hallelujah you can't help you how you
[55:17] were born you can't help what house you
[55:19] were born in you can't have the name you
[55:21] were born into you can't help any of
[55:23] that stuff but you could help staying a
[55:25] sinner because if you accept jesus he
[55:28] was made sin for you god's way of escape
[55:31] then you don't have to be a sinner no
[55:33] more you'll be a christian and you'll be
[55:35] holy not your own holiness but his
[55:38] holiness what you are but but what god
[55:41] has done for you in christ jesus
[55:44] hallelujah brother branham said your own
[55:46] ways you can quit lying you can quit
[55:48] stealing you can quit smoking hallelujah
[55:51] he said that don't even mean you're
[55:52] saved you're saved because god ordained
[55:55] that you should be saved and called your
[55:57] heart that's why you're saved no man can
[56:00] come except the father draws me first
[56:03] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[56:06] lord in spiritual food and due season
[56:08] i'm just laying a foundation he made a
[56:10] way for the believer the same thing he
[56:12] does each time in the days when he was
[56:15] going to destroy the world by water he
[56:17] made a way of escape for noah in the
[56:19] days he was going to deal with egypt he
[56:21] made a way of escape across the sea for
[56:24] his people how god makes a way where
[56:27] there is no way because he is that way
[56:29] he is that way oh hallelujah hallelujah
[56:34] hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the
[56:37] lord and he cares do you care he said he
[56:40] cared for those who care to escape in
[56:42] the days of noah he sent them a prophet
[56:45] and this prophet directed them to god's
[56:48] provided way now that's god's way of
[56:50] doing things god spoke to noah and told
[56:53] noah to prepare an act oh hallelujah and
[56:56] we also have a prophet that god spoke to
[56:59] so we could know the way of escape and
[57:01] it's going to be a great escape oh we're
[57:03] going to have an opportunity to break
[57:05] free from the confinement of this world
[57:07] from the control of this world to escape
[57:10] means to get away to get out to run away
[57:14] to run off to break out to break free to
[57:18] get free to break loose to make a break
[57:21] for it to make a run for it to bolt to
[57:24] clear out to flee to fly to take flight
[57:28] to make off to take off to slip away one
[57:32] minute detail next minute the devil
[57:33] don't know where you're gone hallelujah
[57:36] but something in you knows that you
[57:37] cannot be satisfied with just existing
[57:40] on the earth you know that you're a
[57:42] creature of eternity and you're trapped
[57:44] in time and no devil no demon no
[57:47] sickness no mind battle will hold you
[57:50] back

[58:32] to look for the right opportunity

[58:41] hour oh blessed be the name of the lord

[58:47] hour but at the midnight hour when they
[58:50] were worshiping when they were singing
[58:52] when they were praising god at the least
[58:55] likely moment oh hallelujah the
[58:58] opportunity for escape presented itself
[59:01] and the door began to open they couldn't

[1:03:21] escape from your past paul said
[1:03:23] forgetting the things that i pass
[1:03:27] i press
[1:03:28] i press
[1:03:30] oh hallelujah
[1:03:32] oh my
[1:03:33] you can't escape prison friends
[1:03:36] without a plan
[1:03:37] this jail keeper has been keeping people
[1:03:40] in prison for a long time oh hallelujah
[1:03:42] we are here for a short time on the

[1:03:46] keeping me for a long time
[1:03:47] you can't just be a random you can't be
[1:03:50] just try to escape this easy easy like
[1:03:52] that you have to have a plan
[1:03:54] there has to be a little distraction you
[1:03:56] have to have a coordinated system things
[1:03:58] have to happen in different ways at
[1:04:00] different times
[1:04:02] so that you can move and the devil don't
[1:04:03] even realize you're moving when you
[1:04:05] think you're bending down and just
[1:04:06] eating your food you don't know you're
[1:04:07] praying he don't know in the meantime it
[1:04:10] looks like you're just doing normal
[1:04:11] living but you're ready putting things
[1:04:13] together
[1:04:14] oh hallelujah hallelujah anybody with me
[1:04:16] this morning is it anybody in the house
[1:04:22] when you study
[1:04:23] breaking out of prison some people take
[1:04:25] years and they move stone by stone
[1:04:28] rock by rock and
[1:04:30] when when it is all over and it's only
[1:04:32] when it over people understand what took
[1:04:34] place
[1:04:35] because it is such a slow process
[1:04:37] sometimes of taking your time when
[1:04:40] nobody watching it you take a little
[1:04:42] piece of spoon and you just you're
[1:04:44] scraping but you're doing it
[1:04:45] consistently
[1:04:47] you're doing it all the time you know a
[1:04:49] drop of water
[1:04:50] over and over and over could cut through
[1:04:52] something
[1:04:54] what it means is consistency

[1:07:43] listen
[1:07:44] the devil can't see this you know
[1:07:45] because his whole escape plan

[1:07:49] under the seventh seal even when we talk
[1:07:51] about it he can't understand it he's
[1:07:54] hearing us in a different language
[1:07:56] because this mystery of who you are he
[1:07:58] can figure it out
[1:08:00] hallelujah you know what brother branham
[1:08:02] said if the devil could
[1:08:05] only get under the blood then he'll be
[1:08:07] able to understand certain things but he
[1:08:09] can't come under the blood underneath
[1:08:11] your blood the devil can't reach you and
[1:08:13] what we are preaching is from under the
[1:08:15] blood and the blood is speaking on your
[1:08:17] behalf letting you know you could escape
[1:08:20] and when you trip away it's for your
[1:08:22] family it's for your situation
[1:08:24] it's for your loved ones
[1:08:26] [Applause]
[1:08:28] [Music]

[1:08:38] listen
[1:08:40] hallelujah in prison
[1:08:41] yes get visitations let's get visits
[1:08:45] all these visitations is when you have
[1:08:47] to understand the plan
[1:08:49] and help
[1:08:50] execute the plan and help talk about the
[1:08:53] plan because you can't just escape and
[1:08:55] be standing out outside the prison and i
[1:08:56] don't know where you're going
[1:09:01] so this thing have to be so perfectly
[1:09:03] timed that when you get out there's a
[1:09:05] waiting vehicle
[1:09:08] you have to get out and cross ground you
[1:09:11] may have never walked before
[1:09:13] so you have to study the map in your
[1:09:15] mind
[1:09:16] you have to know how much pss is going
[1:09:17] to take
[1:09:18] how much steps if it's 22 steps and then
[1:09:22] turn left because you never walk there
[1:09:23] before you've been locked up
[1:09:25] anybody with me you got to know where to
[1:09:27] turn right and turn left you got to know
[1:09:29] with the eyes closed you got to know it
[1:09:32] if it's dark you got to know it when oh
[1:09:34] come on somebody help me
[1:09:37] and this whole bible is an escape plan
[1:09:40] you have to know it with your eyes
[1:09:41] closed you have to know it when the
[1:09:42] light's off you have to know when to
[1:09:44] turn you have to know when the enemy
[1:09:46] going gonna move and decide and when the
[1:09:48] enemy comes in like a flood you know the
[1:09:50] spirit will have to raise a standard
[1:09:52] because you're escaping you don't have
[1:09:54] no weapons but they're escaping
[1:09:56] hallelujah somebody helped me
[1:09:59] anybody want to escape their sickness is

[1:10:22] hallelujah
[1:10:24] we have studied it so many times and
[1:10:26] listen
[1:10:27] the devil's job is to break your mind
[1:10:30] break your spirit
[1:10:31] you tell somebody we escape you say what
[1:10:33] happened if we don't make it out you
[1:10:34] know what they will do to us

[1:10:41] you're suddenly fine you put down your
[1:10:42] spoon you're putting on your bread knife
[1:10:44] and you stop chipping
[1:10:45] because you start to wonder
[1:10:47] if things go wrong
[1:10:49] but when you have scriptures like all
[1:10:50] things work together for good
[1:10:52] and you don't have to take no taught
[1:10:53] about these things and don't worry about
[1:10:55] these things you're wondering what the
[1:10:56] children warned about listen just keep
[1:10:58] tripping
[1:10:59] [Applause]
[1:11:02] worry has not solved one thing since
[1:11:04] adam fell to no warrior fixed anything
[1:11:06] yet but fate has the ability to move
[1:11:10] mountains
[1:11:11] and it is an act of fear because faith
[1:11:12] without works is dead your work is
[1:11:14] expressed by your daily actions in the
[1:11:17] face of situations that should tell you
[1:11:19] to stop
[1:11:22] oh you don't hear me this morning every
[1:11:24] single day there are situations that
[1:11:26] challenge you to give up
[1:11:29] situations come that asks you why is it
[1:11:31] what's the use
[1:11:34] but something on the inside when you
[1:11:36] feel like giving up
[1:11:38] when you feel like giving up
[1:11:40] when you feel like throwing in the towel
[1:11:43] when you feel like this thing is not
[1:11:44] worth it
[1:11:46] something holding on to you when you can
[1:11:48] hold on to yourself
[1:11:50] that's why you hear this this morning
[1:11:52] that's why in church this morning
[1:11:59] you may be seated you know the stories

[1:13:37] and you know how much harder it is for a
[1:13:39] whole group to escape
[1:13:44] and just think in this rapture a whole
[1:13:46] group of people
[1:13:48] around the world that the devil wants to
[1:13:50] keep
[1:13:51] suddenly breaking free
[1:13:53] at the same time and the devil can't do
[1:13:55] nothing about it that's what's about to
[1:13:57] happen you know
[1:13:58] but are you ready have you have you
[1:14:00] cleared your pathway to get out of here
[1:14:05] [Music]
[1:14:07] in the message eagle stirring her nest
[1:14:08] brother said i thought
[1:14:10] that was the most saddest sight
[1:14:17] experience he had he said i'd give that
[1:14:18] man a hundred dollars more than he paid
[1:14:20] for the ego
[1:14:22] he saw a man with an eagle in a cage
[1:14:24] he said that a purely man more money
[1:14:26] than he paid for the eagle 100 more if
[1:14:29] he'd let me open that door
[1:14:31] and let him out
[1:14:33] oh to think he was born to seal those
[1:14:36] blue skies
[1:14:38] and he looked up there and couldn't do
[1:14:39] it
[1:14:40] somebody had put him in a cage
[1:14:44] i thought that was a sad sight but
[1:14:46] brother when i see men and women who
[1:14:48] were born to be sons and daughters of
[1:14:50] god caged
[1:14:52] in old cage of the nomination
[1:14:55] that says the days of miracles has
[1:14:57] passed and
[1:14:58] keep you away from the real thing of god
[1:15:01] walking around out here trying to
[1:15:03] satisfy that blessed hunger
[1:15:06] that god put in you to thirst after him
[1:15:10] and you're trying to satisfied with
[1:15:12] wearing shorts and drinking and joining
[1:15:14] church and all these things is the
[1:15:16] saddest sight i've ever seen
[1:15:18] you were born to be a man and woman of
[1:15:21] god
[1:15:22] the sword you unexplored
[1:15:24] hallelujah and explore the unknown
[1:15:28] god made you thus
[1:15:30] not to be caged in by my denomination
[1:15:33] don't believe in miracles i don't care
[1:15:35] what your denomination does your savior
[1:15:38] said so and that settles it
[1:15:40] don't let no man put you in a cage you
[1:15:42] don't need in a cage you need to be free
[1:15:45] the reason you look upward is because
[1:15:47] you are a born eagle
[1:15:49] friends you know you can't become an
[1:15:51] eagle you're either born an eagle or
[1:15:53] you're not born or eager and if you're
[1:15:55] born or eager it's already built in in
[1:15:57] you to fly whether you're in prison or
[1:15:59] out of prison the ability to fly is
[1:16:01] already built in we are not trying to
[1:16:03] change due to eagles this morning you
[1:16:05] know we are here to remind you that
[1:16:07] you're born an eagle
[1:16:08] and it is not expected of you to display
[1:16:10] eagle behavior
[1:16:12] eagle strength eagle attitude eagle
[1:16:15] perseverance
[1:16:20] hallelujah
[1:16:21] the reason you look upon is because
[1:16:23] you're a born eagle
[1:16:24] the reason you love to do that is
[1:16:26] because god made you thus
[1:16:28] hallelujah there's something in you
[1:16:29] brother congress looking up for your
[1:16:31] redemption there's something in you that
[1:16:33] drives you every morning it doesn't
[1:16:35] matter what trials you go through god
[1:16:38] made you thus
[1:16:40] you can't stay cooped up in a chicken
[1:16:42] coop you were made to be an eager to fly
[1:16:44] in the sky the heavens above and sail
[1:16:47] into the unknown into the power of the
[1:16:50] living god
[1:16:52] hallelujah but abandoned goes on he said
[1:16:55] you wasn't made to be like other birds
[1:16:58] that's what's the matter today that's
[1:16:59] what your hearts are hungering for is to
[1:17:01] get loose and to get free because you're
[1:17:03] an eagle to begin with
[1:17:05] hallelujah an eagle is an eagle to start
[1:17:07] with he was born an eagle that's what
[1:17:10] make him hunger and peaceful
[1:17:11] righteousness but long as you're
[1:17:13] standing in a cage that says that
[1:17:15] there's a miracle of pass or you don't
[1:17:18] listen to those fanatics there's no
[1:17:19] divine healing there's no baptism of the
[1:17:21] holy ghost there's nothing but a bunch
[1:17:23] of holy rulers don't you believe that
[1:17:24] don't you believe that oh blessed be the
[1:17:27] name of the lord
[1:17:29] yet an eagle all he hears how much
[1:17:30] different he is from a chicken but they
[1:17:32] are bored birds
[1:17:34] what is a chicken is his nomination
[1:17:37] brother but he's a chicken how much
[1:17:39] different is it from a chicken the eagle
[1:17:41] goes just as high as he can
[1:17:43] and builds his nest in the cleft of the
[1:17:45] rock and when he gets up there no
[1:17:47] predator can get to him see why the
[1:17:49] devil wants to keep any cage because you
[1:17:50] could go so high i think i preached it
[1:17:52] last week however you live so high
[1:17:54] situations can't get to you anymore you
[1:17:56] fly so high your trials can't reach that
[1:17:58] high they don't have the ability to go
[1:18:00] that eye but when you go that high oh
[1:18:03] god lord almighty the predator can't get
[1:18:05] to you
[1:18:06] oh
[1:18:07] hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the
[1:18:10] name of the lord but god has some eagles
[1:18:12] who will escape god has some sons who
[1:18:15] will escape god has some daughters who
[1:18:17] will escape i'm sorry but i can't
[1:18:20] apologize for what i believe i believe
[1:18:22] that there are some sons and daughters
[1:18:24] who are tired of this world and they
[1:18:26] really say goodbye world oh and good
[1:18:29] morning glory
[1:18:33] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:18:37] the whole bible is about escaping
[1:18:39] hallelujah
[1:18:42] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:18:45] luke 4 when jesus came look at the
[1:18:46] scripture the spirit of the lord is upon
[1:18:48] me because he had anointed me to preach
[1:18:51] the gospel to the poor he had sent me to
[1:18:53] heal to broken-hearted to preach
[1:18:56] deliverance to the captives you know he
[1:18:58] had to preach deliverance to the
[1:18:59] captives
[1:19:00] hallelujah so that they know that
[1:19:02] there's a way out you've been in
[1:19:04] captivity but there's a message of
[1:19:05] deliverance that breaks you out to your
[1:19:07] captivity hallelujah there are people in
[1:19:09] all kind of chains this morning

[1:19:15] depression oh hallelujah but you could
[1:19:17] go free this morning you ought to be the
[1:19:19] happiest people on the face of the earth

[1:19:23] are built to fly above it
[1:19:25] and fly as an eagle into the eye of the
[1:19:27] storm and confront every challenge every
[1:19:30] trial every testing just like david the
[1:19:33] beer the lion when goliath come you're
[1:19:35] not backing down because you're an ego
[1:19:37] you know the lord who took you through
[1:19:38] the first trial the lord who took you
[1:19:40] through the second trial the lord who

[1:22:13] hallelujah
[1:22:16] oh i hope this is encouraging you this
[1:22:18] morning and every single listen and
[1:22:21] that's why it's a way of escape the way
[1:22:23] of escape from noah was different from
[1:22:25] lot
[1:22:27] the way of escape from enoch was
[1:22:29] different
[1:22:30] there's a way of escape
[1:22:32] for time and season and operation for
[1:22:35] the children of israel to come out of
[1:22:36] egypt with occurrence guardians and a
[1:22:38] flood he had another way of escape
[1:22:41] what worked for noah was not going to
[1:22:42] work for moses moses couldn't say let's
[1:22:45] build a act that was not the way of
[1:22:46] escaping that day anybody with me this
[1:22:48] morning oh hallelujah and when it was
[1:22:51] time for the children of israel noah had
[1:22:53] to not speak to no king no pharaoh he
[1:22:56] was preaching a message get into the act
[1:22:58] during his coming that was a different
[1:22:59] kind of thing but when moses time come
[1:23:01] now god said go down to pharaoh and tell
[1:23:04] pharaoh let my people go hallelujah
[1:23:07] blessed be the name of the lord this
[1:23:09] escape is different hallelujah my
[1:23:11] children have been in bondage for a long
[1:23:12] time they're born into bondage some of
[1:23:15] them don't even know what freedom looks
[1:23:16] like because they are a son or
[1:23:18] grandchild or a great-great-grandson
[1:23:21] they're born in egypt they just born
[1:23:22] into slavery but i want you to go down
[1:23:24] there and tell pharaoh that let my
[1:23:26] people go i don't care how what
[1:23:28] condition what is happening tell pharaoh
[1:23:31] let my people go
[1:23:34] do i say moses say lord i can't talk
[1:23:37] this is the same moses who was most
[1:23:38] likely to succeed in university most
[1:23:40] likely to be the next king most likely
[1:23:43] to be a politician most likely to be
[1:23:45] qualified but when he saw the magnitude
[1:23:47] of the task
[1:23:48] to lead and escape for two million
[1:23:50] people he said i can't talk hallelujah
[1:23:53] and i preach a message no more excuses
[1:23:55] when moses finished say what can happen
[1:23:57] and what car work out and he said you
[1:23:58] have any more
[1:24:00] you have any more reason why you can't
[1:24:02] go you have any more reason why you
[1:24:04] can't worship you have any more reasons
[1:24:06] why you can't pray you have any more
[1:24:08] excuses for why you're not on fire you
[1:24:11] have any more reasons for why for why

[1:24:15] shouting because after you say you can't
[1:24:17] and you can't in a card i'm here to let
[1:24:19] you know you're still going because
[1:24:21] that's what you were born to do you're

[1:24:24] in a chicken cuban and eating chicken
[1:24:27] food and wearing chicken clothes and
[1:24:29] going to a chicken job and you're trying
[1:24:31] to fit in but after all it's said and
[1:24:33] done you're still going
[1:24:34] [Applause]
[1:24:36] and little moses
[1:24:38] rejects his staff and just his wife and
[1:24:41] his son go down into egypt to come and
[1:24:44] take over to come and set the people
[1:24:46] free you see oh god loves to create a
[1:24:48] way of escape that just defies
[1:24:50] expectation every single time nobody
[1:24:53] when they left moses said if they only
[1:24:55] knew what moses was coming to do they
[1:24:57] stop him at the border
[1:25:01] if they only knew what moses was coming
[1:25:04] to do because they didn't consider him a
[1:25:06] threat he said come in come in come in
[1:25:08] come in
[1:25:09] say hello old man with a stick
[1:25:11] and his wife and a child
[1:25:13] walking into egypt and they don't even
[1:25:15] know that locked up in that man is
[1:25:17] nuclear power
[1:25:19] locked up in that man is a walking
[1:25:20] nuclear weapon just walking and good
[1:25:23] morning how you doing good good evening
[1:25:27] hallelujah moses himself didn't even
[1:25:29] know how this was going to play out he
[1:25:30] was just walking in his purpose
[1:25:33] his purpose led him to walk in egypt
[1:25:35] walk the same streets that he walked as
[1:25:37] a boy he walked the same street study he
[1:25:40] played in but he didn't even realize the
[1:25:42] nuclear power that had been locked up in
[1:25:44] him that was part of that pillar of fire
[1:25:46] experience
[1:25:47] oh come on now somebody help me his wife
[1:25:50] was walking with him and she didn't even
[1:25:52] know
[1:25:53] that the husband she was with was such a
[1:25:55] changed man she she knew he had an
[1:25:57] experience but she didn't realize how
[1:26:00] much he had changed he didn't realize
[1:26:02] how much he had had such an encounter
[1:26:04] that he was a different man and moses is
[1:26:07] walking and he's walking and his son is
[1:26:08] looking at daddy the same daddy you may
[1:26:11] be swimming with entire shoelaces and
[1:26:13] his son don't even realize that that
[1:26:15] daddy is a channel of inspiration for
[1:26:17] god to speak through and here it is
[1:26:20] moses find himself walking one foot in
[1:26:23] front of the other
[1:26:25] not even knowing how we're gonna say it
[1:26:27] and what he gonna say because god is now
[1:26:29] using as an instrument do you see what's
[1:26:31] coming your way i'm trying to paint a
[1:26:33] picture oh hallelujah because it's not
[1:26:36] your might it is not your power it is
[1:26:38] not your ability it is not your strength
[1:26:41] it is not your ability it is not your
[1:26:43] strength
[1:26:48] and
[1:26:48] moses coming to map out the way of
[1:26:51] escape
[1:26:53] he said pharaoh
[1:26:55] let my people go
[1:26:57] pharaoh looking at see but this is
[1:27:00] this is not moses
[1:27:05] was this long time we say it's 40 years
[1:27:07] we look in fear
[1:27:10] you remember the maniac
[1:27:14] and moses stood there and have to take
[1:27:16] the critique the comments
[1:27:19] through along his staff and you know the
[1:27:21] unfolding of it and
[1:27:23] out of that came more pressure for the
[1:27:25] children of israel
[1:27:28] let them make bricks without straw
[1:27:31] and now the children of israel do people
[1:27:32] who he would expect excited to go free
[1:27:35] start to have problems with him now
[1:27:41] you see you come to oppress us more
[1:27:44] why didn't just stay quiet
[1:27:46] why are they still i'm trouble and
[1:27:48] telling us we can leave this place
[1:27:50] now things get harder you give us hope
[1:27:52] that we can leave but now like a squeeze
[1:27:54] come in boy
[1:28:01] but that's how god operates
[1:28:03] because god wanted to break pharaoh
[1:28:06] and every preacher before every single
[1:28:08] plague that came was attacking one of
[1:28:10] the egyptian deities
[1:28:12] one by one god was saying fly sending
[1:28:15] frogs and then walking up pestilence
[1:28:18] to break down his system there
[1:28:20] until the last great one
[1:28:23] hallelujah
[1:28:25] oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:28:28] lord
[1:28:29] the last great one
[1:28:32] slay
[1:28:33] every firstborn
[1:28:35] slay every firstborn
[1:28:38] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:28:42] and there it was it didn't matter if
[1:28:44] you're jew
[1:28:44] it didn't matter if you're egyptian if
[1:28:46] you didn't do what was required you're
[1:28:48] in trouble
[1:28:50] hallelujah if you didn't apply the token
[1:28:52] because that was the only way of escape
[1:28:58] the way of escape wasn't what church
[1:29:00] you're into what what what what what
[1:29:02] tribe or the brandon preacher so many
[1:29:04] times it didn't matter if you're an
[1:29:05] israelite it didn't matter what child
[1:29:07] you belong to
[1:29:09] blessed be the name
[1:29:11] of the lord and we know it
[1:29:13] they all escaped
[1:29:16] and even on the journey of escaping they
[1:29:18] had more situations that they had to
[1:29:20] escape from
[1:29:21] because the devil is not going to make
[1:29:22] it easy they headed out to egypt and as
[1:29:24] they come to the red sea we know it
[1:29:26] pharaoh now coming behind them
[1:29:28] and once again after all of the power
[1:29:31] and all the miracles again human
[1:29:32] behavior human condition moses they're
[1:29:35] crying and god say why cry speak
[1:29:39] and move forward
[1:29:41] oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the
[1:29:44] name of the lord could he take some more
[1:29:51] here's the escape theater friends this
[1:29:54] escape we're talking about another
[1:29:55] casual experience
[1:29:58] it's not a casual thing there's a level
[1:30:00] of urgency that we want to have
[1:30:05] for i cannot do anything till thou
[1:30:07] become fitter
[1:30:09] that's what god would have told lot
[1:30:13] hurry up and escape
[1:30:16] leave this thing behind you
[1:30:20] hallelujah
[1:30:22] saying luke 17 26 and as it was in the
[1:30:25] days of noah so shall it be also in the
[1:30:27] days of the son of man they did eat they
[1:30:29] drank they married wives they were given
[1:30:32] in marriage until the day that noah
[1:30:34] entered into the ark and the flood came
[1:30:36] and destroyed them all
[1:30:40] likewise also as it was in the days of
[1:30:42] lot did it eat they drank they bought
[1:30:44] they sold they planted they built it
[1:30:45] they went to school they went to work
[1:30:47] but the same day that lot went out of
[1:30:49] sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[1:30:52] heaven and destroyed them all even thus
[1:30:54] shall it be in the day when the son of
[1:30:56] man is revealed
[1:30:58] in that day he which shall be upon the
[1:31:00] housetop and it's tough in the house let
[1:31:02] him not come down to take it away and he
[1:31:04] that is in the field at them likewise
[1:31:06] not returned back remember lot's wife
[1:31:11] escape flee flee run for your life young
[1:31:14] brother young sister
[1:31:16] run for your life
[1:31:18] father mother are you on the run
[1:31:21] are you looking to escape are you
[1:31:22] looking to get away from this thing or
[1:31:24] you or you're comfortable just hoping
[1:31:26] that something will work out and you're
[1:31:28] going to make it through
[1:31:30] second timothy 2 22 to 22 flee also
[1:31:34] youthful lusts
[1:31:36] but follow righteousness faith charity
[1:31:38] peace with them that call on the lord
[1:31:40] out of a pure heart
[1:31:43] time of escape
[1:31:46] but ibrahim said in the message is your
[1:31:47] life worthy of the gospel
[1:31:50] now we see when god gives a man an
[1:31:52] invitation
[1:31:54] to do something or to receive the
[1:31:56] invitation that he's given him and he
[1:31:58] returns it down then there's nothing
[1:31:59] left
[1:32:00] after mercy is pulling but judgment
[1:32:03] if you step over the boundaries of mercy
[1:32:05] then there's only one thing left and
[1:32:07] that is judgment
[1:32:08] and we find that man has done that in
[1:32:10] all ages it happens most every age in
[1:32:13] the bible why are you saying this
[1:32:15] brother isaac
[1:32:17] we're preaching about escaping and there
[1:32:18] are people who will do nothing about it
[1:32:24] no zeal no burden no crying no sign no
[1:32:28] holding on to the horns of the altar
[1:32:31] but ibanum goes on when god sent noah
[1:32:33] his servant and made a way of escape for
[1:32:35] all the people who wanted to be saved
[1:32:37] but the people only laughed and scorned
[1:32:39] that noah
[1:32:40] but god made the way but they had an
[1:32:43] excuse
[1:32:44] it wasn't according to their modern
[1:32:46] thinking
[1:32:47] it wasn't the way they wanted it so they
[1:32:50] made excuses in the days of noah
[1:32:53] you making excuses young brother young
[1:32:55] sister are you making excuses for why
[1:32:58] you're not praying and you're not
[1:32:59] reading the bible and you're not trying
[1:33:00] to live right and not cleaning out your
[1:33:02] house and and lightening up yourself so
[1:33:05] you could leave here are you making
[1:33:07] excuses for why you're still holding
[1:33:09] oughts and grudges
[1:33:11] so brother branham said the reason they
[1:33:12] didn't escape the days of noah is
[1:33:14] because they made excuses
[1:33:19] he goes on they made excuses in the days
[1:33:21] of moses
[1:33:22] they made excuses in the days of elijah
[1:33:24] they made excuses in the days of christ
[1:33:26] and they make excuses today
[1:33:31] now him speaking the record to israel
[1:33:33] the one that was called to the feast you
[1:33:35] remember when
[1:33:36] they gave the parable and man said come
[1:33:38] to the feast
[1:33:42] one man said i have to go and do this i
[1:33:43] have to go and do that i have to go and
[1:33:45] do this i can't make church because i'm
[1:33:47] going to do this i can't be in prayer
[1:33:48] meeting because i have to do this i can
[1:33:53] the ones that was called to the feast
[1:33:55] that i would also apply today to men the
[1:33:56] church who has been bitten to come to
[1:33:59] the feast
[1:34:00] and won't do it a spiritual feast of the
[1:34:02] lord
[1:34:03] and they wouldn't do it they didn't want
[1:34:04] to do it they got other things to do
[1:34:06] they find excuses
[1:34:11] but ibraheem goes along with israel two
[1:34:13] thousand years ago would have accepted
[1:34:15] the invitation that they were given they
[1:34:17] wouldn't be as they are today
[1:34:19] two thousand years ago israel turned
[1:34:21] down the invitation to come to the
[1:34:23] wedding supper and they turn it on went
[1:34:25] into judgment
[1:34:28] but as jesus said they stoned and killed
[1:34:29] the prophet that was sent to them by
[1:34:31] making excuses
[1:34:35] hallelujah
[1:34:38] jesus said listen prophet that the
[1:34:40] excuses is what killed the prophets
[1:34:43] do you realize how your excuses are
[1:34:44] holding you back
[1:34:47] the things you should be doing but you
[1:34:49] don't do but you have a reason to know
[1:34:50] you have a legitimate reason that is the
[1:34:52] excuse
[1:34:58] we are good at making excuses
[1:35:02] and some excuses we can identify you
[1:35:04] know i've made too many mistakes that is
[1:35:06] my issues

[1:42:53] pushing you what are you feeding on let
[1:42:55] me see where it's all true stories let

[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:21] i'll tell you what you're made out of
[1:43:24] yes sir that's what your soul is feeding
[1:43:26] on
[1:43:27] that's why i say it to the church all
[1:43:28] the time when you can't get into the
[1:43:29] spirit go track back what to do
[1:43:31] yesterday the day before the day before
[1:43:33] that he did what you're feeding on
[1:43:35] because what you're feeling on is what
[1:43:36] you become you are what you eat but if
[1:43:38] you're feasting on this manner from
[1:43:40] under the seventh seal and you are
[1:43:42] identified with a death burial and
[1:43:45] resurrection and you understand that
[1:43:47] this message of the hour is to turn your
[1:43:49] heart back to the original faith and to
[1:43:52] bring you to adoption and perfection and
[1:43:54] the holy ghost itself
[1:43:58] the person of christ
[1:43:59] then it will show in your conversation
[1:44:02] it will show in your operation it will
[1:44:05] show in what you do and how you live and
[1:44:06] how you act and how you move and it will
[1:44:09] show
[1:44:10] that even if you lose your teacher still
[1:44:11] will come the devil because i want to be
[1:44:13] identified with the lord's side can the
[1:44:16] church see amen
[1:44:20] regardless of what your testimony is
[1:44:22] your fruits prove what you are
[1:44:25] your soul feeds on something
[1:44:28] that's the reason jesus said by their
[1:44:30] fruit you shall know them
[1:44:32] in a message straight is the gate we're
[1:44:34] talking about the way of escape right
[1:44:36] you have to make a choice
[1:44:38] you can't stand neutral
[1:44:40] you've got to say yes or no
[1:44:44] anybody with me
[1:44:45] every day is a choice i'm just taking it
[1:44:48] from the prophet's message because it's
[1:44:49] a way
[1:44:52] listen you can only backslide if you
[1:44:53] leave your way
[1:44:56] you can't backslide if you're on the way
[1:45:00] it's a straight way it's a narrow way
[1:45:03] if you stay on the straight way and in
[1:45:05] narrow way and you keep moving something
[1:45:07] might move slower and move faster but if
[1:45:09] you stay there you have no backslider no
[1:45:11] no
[1:45:12] the problem is when you leave the way
[1:45:15] you leave the way of escape and they
[1:45:17] take in your own way
[1:45:21] i hope this helps somebody
[1:45:23] are really dedicating this message to
[1:45:25] the young people we haven't had service
[1:45:26] in a long time this is youth service
[1:45:32] you can't stand neutral
[1:45:34] i'm a believer you know believe in what
[1:45:36] what do you believe
[1:45:38] because your belief should have you
[1:45:39] speaking a certain way dressing a
[1:45:41] certain way living a certain way pray in
[1:45:43] a certain way worship in a certain way
[1:45:45] acting a certain way having a certain
[1:45:47] kind of conversation a certain attitude
[1:45:49] a certain resilience a certain strength
[1:45:52] a certain zeal a certain enthusiasm
[1:45:54] [Music]
[1:45:58] you've got to say yes or no
[1:46:01] ah yes sure if i want to go to the party
[1:46:04] already let me let me see i i
[1:46:07] will get our feedback
[1:46:11] feedback
[1:46:12] feedback is yes or no
[1:46:16] and friend doing the right thing is is a
[1:46:19] year on a straight thing you know
[1:46:22] if you're a christian what are you doing
[1:46:23] there
[1:46:24] if a christian why are you listening to
[1:46:26] that
[1:46:27] if you're a christian why are you doing
[1:46:28] that there's no middle ground there's no
[1:46:30] gray area
[1:46:33] you've got a choice to make make it for
[1:46:34] christ
[1:46:39] but the random goes on they thought
[1:46:40] everything that belonged to church would
[1:46:42] be saved
[1:46:43] i know there are people in the message
[1:46:45] who believe that because in a message
[1:46:47] they're all right you know
[1:46:53] there are people sitting only messing
[1:46:54] with the clients who believe that
[1:46:56] because they know and believe this
[1:46:57] message that they go into heaven
[1:47:00] and they go into the rapture is an
[1:47:01] automatic thing
[1:47:04] they're people who believe that because
[1:47:06] they love jesus and they believe jesus
[1:47:08] said
[1:47:13] when people pass on everybody's saying
[1:47:15] they go into heaven if the family go
[1:47:16] into heaven really is that always work
[1:47:19] it dies by bible
[1:47:22] see you in heaven fly with what
[1:47:27] living any kind of life is is that is
[1:47:29] that the qualification to go on the
[1:47:30] other side
[1:47:33] or can a gangster criminal and walking
[1:47:35] up people who are kind of crazy and say
[1:47:37] fly high with the eagles what eagles
[1:47:43] your life your testimony
[1:47:48] but when i'm saying here they thought
[1:47:50] everything that belonged to the church
[1:47:51] would be saved jesus said straight is
[1:47:53] the gate and narrow is the way but few
[1:47:56] there'll be that find it
[1:47:58] this way of escape is for a few that
[1:48:01] find it and to find it means you're
[1:48:03] looking for it
[1:48:05] you're not going to stumble on this way
[1:48:07] i accidentally find myself in the way no
[1:48:11] you have to be seeking you have to be
[1:48:12] hunting you have to be looking you have
[1:48:14] to ignore you're putting on blinders
[1:48:16] because you recognize time is short
[1:48:18] time is late and the devil has taken out
[1:48:22] people in this season
[1:48:24] message believers being taken out
[1:48:27] in delusions that they're comfortable to
[1:48:29] be in church
[1:48:35] listen to the prophet's words now
[1:48:37] let me warn you this morning church be
[1:48:40] careful listen to the prophet listen
[1:48:42] carefully church
[1:48:43] if this is the last message i preach
[1:48:47] let me warn you this morning church be
[1:48:49] careful
[1:48:51] it takes time today
[1:48:54] in our self-righteous
[1:48:56] self-sufficient generation of hypocrisy
[1:48:59] that we're living in
[1:49:00] an hour when men and women stand in the
[1:49:03] churches and in the pews and sing
[1:49:05] anthems of god
[1:49:07] singing they're worshiping
[1:49:10] jesus said in vain do they worship me
[1:49:16] they worship you don't know but it don't
[1:49:18] count
[1:49:19] god can't receive it he can't accept it
[1:49:24] when it comes up to him be free granted
[1:49:26] the worship is not right because behind
[1:49:29] that
[1:49:32] listen to the prophet
[1:49:33] stand in a church within a pews and sing
[1:49:35] the anthems of god and walk out of that
[1:49:37] church and smoke cigarettes
[1:49:39] and drink whiskey and go to dances and
[1:49:42] live for the world and tell dirty smutty
[1:49:45] jokes

[1:50:28] but i like standing out what do you
[1:50:30] think highly like under the bushel
[1:50:33] i like attention we're not looking for
[1:50:35] attention you're different
[1:50:36] you can help being different

[1:51:40] a way of holiness
[1:51:42] a way of decency a way of righteousness
[1:51:45] [Applause]
[1:51:47] your language cannot be like the world
[1:51:56] our language evolves our world's
[1:51:58] evolving people have different things
[1:51:59] and and listen i understand it's on the
[1:52:02] job it's in your school it's an
[1:52:03] environment you see what's happening in
[1:52:04] schools now
[1:52:06] the first week school opens seven fights
[1:52:08] merited tv that's what military news
[1:52:11] imagine the ones that make it
[1:52:16] things you never heard 10 15 20 30 40
[1:52:18] years ago
[1:52:20] normal normal children with weapons and
[1:52:22] this and that you what you think will be
[1:52:24] in five years 10 years 15 years you know
[1:52:26] terries
[1:52:30] wonder the prophets say is this the kind
[1:52:31] of world which you're gonna have to grow
[1:52:32] up in
[1:52:34] the litter of hell uncovered and streams
[1:52:36] of demon powers these children are
[1:52:39] possessed
[1:52:42] some have never been to a church their
[1:52:44] parents never told him about god never
[1:52:46] told him about a heaven that's high in a
[1:52:48] hell that's hot
[1:52:51] and they don't know better but judgment
[1:52:53] hangs over them
[1:52:56] and if it wasn't for praying grandmas
[1:52:58] and praying grandparents and the blood
[1:53:01] and mercy and grace and god sending a
[1:53:02] prophet
[1:53:04] we will be just like that we are no
[1:53:06] better than anybody else but it's grace
[1:53:08] and mercy
[1:53:12] that was instructed to follow us every
[1:53:14] day of our lives once we walk this way
[1:53:17] of escape
[1:53:22] [Music]
[1:53:23] don't wait until your problems stack up
[1:53:26] to say lord i want to come back home
[1:53:28] don't wait until you're back against the
[1:53:31] wall to say i need to make things right
[1:53:34] don't wait until everything is falling
[1:53:36] apart to say lord i really need you
[1:53:48] it's a predictable pattern you know
[1:53:53] when pressure comes
[1:53:55] when stress comes then it drives us to
[1:53:57] look for something so there's a health
[1:53:59] issue there's a family problem there's a
[1:54:01] financial problem there's a dis i know
[1:54:03] you're looking for help until you
[1:54:04] recover wait a minute where's god um
[1:54:07] said god never leaves us go right back
[1:54:09] to where you left him because he can't
[1:54:11] leave the way he is the way
[1:54:15] [Applause]
[1:54:19] he can't leave what he is he is the way
[1:54:23] and he hasn't closed the door to the way
[1:54:26] it will close one day sure
[1:54:28] because mercy will come to an end
[1:54:35] it's a judgment seat with mercy on it
[1:54:38] the blood speaks mercy on the seat of
[1:54:40] judgment he is a judge he's a king he's
[1:54:43] a ruler and he is holy he said i am holy
[1:54:47] and you are called to walk in holiness
[1:54:49] it could never be your way
[1:54:53] how you think it should be and your
[1:54:55] plans and your ambitions and your
[1:54:57] desires and what you want and what you
[1:54:59] value and what your family stands for
[1:55:02] and what you will to achieve and your
[1:55:04] legacy and your heritage that's dead to
[1:55:07] the believer
[1:55:08] there's only one heritage there's only
[1:55:10] one legacy there's only one destination
[1:55:13] and that is through this way of escape
[1:55:15] [Applause]
[1:55:16] [Music]
[1:55:17] that takes us right through calvary
[1:55:20] where you lay there to cross and say
[1:55:23] lord now run my god today
[1:55:27] search my heart change my heart break my
[1:55:30] human spirit it's good enough to solve
[1:55:33] your home problem it's good enough to
[1:55:35] solve your business problem it's good
[1:55:37] enough
[1:55:38] you don't think god cares
[1:55:40] his disciples had taxes to pay taxes
[1:55:43] he said go
[1:55:44] fish
[1:55:46] and when the fish in the fish was gold
[1:55:49] he said go go give to caesar what this
[1:55:50] is own
[1:55:52] go take care of your taxes go take care
[1:55:54] of your financial issues because i need
[1:55:57] you to be focused on this spiritual
[1:55:58] thing these secondary things are
[1:56:00] secondary there's a bigger issue at hand
[1:56:03] that is walking in this way of escape
[1:56:06] so you could be counted worthy to escape
[1:56:13] [Applause]
[1:56:14] you are christians you are sons and
[1:56:17] daughters of the living god you are not
[1:56:19] message believers you are sons and
[1:56:21] daughters of the living god climb higher
[1:56:24] than the message believers climb higher
[1:56:26] than people who follow in christ
[1:56:28] walk in the way the way of truth the way
[1:56:31] of holiness the way of escape
[1:56:36] [Music]
[1:56:38] [Applause]
[1:56:42] you may be seen we have preached so many
[1:56:44] times before
[1:56:47] after the the lutheran message came the
[1:56:50] joshua lived by faith the wesleyan
[1:56:53] scheme and sanctify
[1:56:54] themselves and they left such sanctified
[1:56:57] lives that the holy ghost wanted to pour
[1:56:58] out
[1:57:00] because the sanctified life attracts the
[1:57:03] holy ghost
[1:57:05] the holy ghost is here looking for a
[1:57:06] sanctified life this morning

[2:00:26] [Music]
[2:00:34] we still in that court
[2:00:37] let me warn you this morning church be
[2:00:39] careful it takes time today in our
[2:00:41] self-righteous self-sufficient
[2:00:43] generation of hypocrisy that we're
[2:00:45] living in this is the prophet an hour
[2:00:48] that when men and women stand in the
[2:00:50] churches
[2:00:52] churches around the world pentecostal
[2:00:54] baptist methodist said okay and in the
[2:00:56] message to stand in churches
[2:00:59] and sing the anthems of god
[2:01:01] and walk out of that church and smoke
[2:01:03] cigarettes and drink whiskey and go to
[2:01:06] dances and live for the world and tell
[2:01:09] dirty smarty jokes and call themselves
[2:01:12] christians
[2:01:13] and men and women can walk from the
[2:01:15] pulpit or from the church and from the
[2:01:18] place of the power of the resurrection
[2:01:20] where that same messiah signs are moving
[2:01:23] among them and not be a new creature in
[2:01:26] christ there's something wrong
[2:01:34] as it was in the days of noah so shall
[2:01:36] it be in the coming of the son of man
[2:01:39] listen in the days of noah the world was
[2:01:41] populated
[2:01:42] about like it is today
[2:01:44] their science was exceeding ours
[2:01:47] they built things and pyramids and done
[2:01:49] things we cannot do today and exceeding
[2:01:51] great smart people
[2:01:53] and remember science yesterday is one
[2:01:55] minute before midnight it's one minute
[2:01:57] before the clock strikes the dead hour
[2:02:00] is later than we think
[2:02:03] i hope
[2:02:04] trust that the holy spirit will sink
[2:02:07] this into every believer's heart
[2:02:09] as the days of noah how many were saved
[2:02:12] in the days of noah out of that
[2:02:13] generation eight out of many millions
[2:02:18] are you going to really take this thing
[2:02:19] for granted
[2:02:23] as it was and it is a so shall it be the
[2:02:26] coming of the son of man oh the tens of
[2:02:28] thousands that
[2:02:29] there was three saved
[2:02:34] [Music]
[2:02:37] time of escape
[2:02:39] the purpose of this message today is for
[2:02:42] every predestinated seed
[2:02:44] to come out of the world
[2:02:46] and rush to be sealed with the token
[2:02:50] and the token must be displayed that's
[2:02:52] why i'm saying young brother young
[2:02:54] sister in your school it has to be on
[2:02:56] display
[2:02:58] in your job it has to be on display in
[2:03:01] your house it has to be on display as
[2:03:04] you walk the street it has to be on
[2:03:06] display we are in a state of emergency
[2:03:10] we are in a crisis
[2:03:14] you realize the war in ukraine is still
[2:03:16] going on right
[2:03:18] and you see how as time progresses the
[2:03:20] sensitivity to it has just died on
[2:03:23] and because it's not close to you you
[2:03:25] don't feel it unless you're following it
[2:03:32] make no mistake about you know we in a
[2:03:34] crisis
[2:03:36] different levels different changes
[2:03:37] economic changes all these things
[2:03:39] everything is moving in order
[2:03:43] and life comes and life happens feature
[2:03:45] just get back in the state of normalcy
[2:03:46] again
[2:03:48] and you have to be just spiritually
[2:03:49] censored to realize listen there's
[2:03:51] movements in the spiritual realm
[2:03:53] but the brown said he seemed angel is
[2:03:56] here right now setting in order for the
[2:03:57] coming of the lord
[2:03:59] and he seems that the devil is playing
[2:04:00] out his plan as well
[2:04:05] i'm getting ready to wind down shortly
[2:04:08] god hates sin
[2:04:12] and sin must be judged
[2:04:14] i'll say it one more time god hates sin
[2:04:18] and sin must be judged
[2:04:21] i'm reading the prophet's words you know
[2:04:22] it's been sedative god doesn't judge
[2:04:24] america trinidad wherever all around the
[2:04:26] world
[2:04:28] pretty soon saying he will have to
[2:04:30] resurrect solomon gomorrah and apologize
[2:04:32] to them
[2:04:35] we will reap what we saw and everybody
[2:04:37] that got any spirituality to them is
[2:04:40] realizing that it's the truth we are the
[2:04:41] end
[2:04:42] of the road
[2:04:44] we are not wandering guessing young
[2:04:46] brother young sister we are not
[2:04:48] speculating we are not hoping we have a
[2:04:51] message of vindicated message that is
[2:04:53] designed to take us out of here and who
[2:04:57] the son of man set free
[2:04:59] is free indeed
[2:05:02] hallelujah and this word that we have
[2:05:04] been preaching
[2:05:05] cannot fall to the ground god is calling
[2:05:08] out to this escape
[2:05:10] he calling every age he called on the
[2:05:12] lutherans he called it the wesleyans he
[2:05:13] called the pentecostals
[2:05:15] and today he's calling out from the
[2:05:18] church he's calling a bride
[2:05:20] he's calling out from the message he's
[2:05:22] calling a bride
[2:05:24] from whatever inspiration he's calling
[2:05:26] our bride
[2:05:27] god are coming for message inspiration
[2:05:29] group following teaching movement that's
[2:05:31] not it you know it's pride
[2:05:35] from the shout a group that will be the
[2:05:37] final voice to the final age called out
[2:05:40] separated an elect lady are you
[2:05:43] separated
[2:05:44] are you separated unto god
[2:05:48] who is going to respond to this call
[2:05:51] to escape
[2:05:53] you can't respond in your own time
[2:05:55] friends
[2:05:59] go to lord he is the escape theater
[2:06:02] do it now do it quickly
[2:06:04] but about him many times with in his
[2:06:05] healing services he would say stand up
[2:06:08] receive it receive it now stand up right
[2:06:09] now
[2:06:11] stand up quickly
[2:06:14] uh you see me i was just
[2:06:16] i just moved when i you know
[2:06:21] i it's just me does you well you stay
[2:06:23] there
[2:06:27] my whole life is just
[2:06:30] let's take things i said take it take it
[2:06:32] i said no i keep it
[2:06:34] you have to realize listen you have to
[2:06:36] do something different
[2:06:38] i never see one time you have to respond
[2:06:40] respond quickly
[2:06:44] don't respond in your own time
[2:06:46] you're doing church how you want praying
[2:06:48] when you want walk in here any time you
[2:06:50] want no urgency no desperation
[2:06:54] you see put a macabre suicide and cry
[2:06:56] for the abomination
[2:06:58] when lies did you say and cry
[2:07:00] for the abomination when does it bother
[2:07:01] you
[2:07:03] because for some of us we have become so
[2:07:04] insensitive
[2:07:06] that you don't bother anymore you know
[2:07:08] so there's no compelling reason to sigh
[2:07:10] and cry it just is it it is what it is
[2:07:16] it's time to escape
[2:07:18] that is that the devil has desire to
[2:07:20] have you that's what jesus told peter
[2:07:23] did he did he's ever did the devil
[2:07:25] desire to sift you like wheat
[2:07:28] that's the devil's job you want to feel
[2:07:30] like wheat
[2:07:31] shake up your life interrupt your life
[2:07:33] but i've prayed for you
[2:07:34] that your faith would feel not
[2:07:38] so we're not wondering what the devil
[2:07:40] desire is it is disruptive it is to this
[2:07:43] it is to kill you
[2:07:45] so jesus told me that he died that is if
[2:07:47] you like wheat the devil wants to have
[2:07:49] you but i prayed for you
[2:07:51] not that he wouldn't come after you not
[2:07:53] that you wouldn't have trials and
[2:07:54] testing but your feet
[2:07:56] in the midst of your child would not
[2:07:58] feel
[2:07:59] that in the midst of your test it will
[2:08:01] not feel in the midst of oppression
[2:08:04] your faith would hold you
[2:08:06] keep you standing on a solid rock of
[2:08:09] revelation that you are predestinated to
[2:08:11] overcome and that you're going to make
[2:08:13] it
[2:08:16] god told lot hasty escape tether i can't
[2:08:19] do nothing
[2:08:21] unless they escape first
[2:08:23] so friends there's a period of escape
[2:08:25] there's an opportunity to escape before
[2:08:27] judgment
[2:08:29] and ones that escape window closes
[2:08:32] then it's judgment
[2:08:37] he told lot i can't judge the world
[2:08:39] until you come out
[2:08:42] i can't fail you completely until they
[2:08:44] come out i can't take control until you
[2:08:46] need to come out if they come to the
[2:08:48] world
[2:08:50] i can't take him to the promised land if
[2:08:51] you're still in egypt you have to come
[2:08:52] out
[2:08:54] i cannot bless you fully if you're still
[2:08:56] there
[2:09:00] god told abraham leave your country
[2:09:03] leave your family
[2:09:05] leave your household
[2:09:06] and walk to where i will show you
[2:09:12] my family boy yes you really
[2:09:17] in other words you can't go on to
[2:09:19] anything with god holding on to what you
[2:09:20] had before you know
[2:09:23] and that also requires a level of trust
[2:09:25] that god was able to keep you and bless
[2:09:28] you and open for you abraham didn't even
[2:09:30] know what he was walking into but the
[2:09:32] bible said he's seeking a city whose
[2:09:34] building maker is god
[2:09:36] when god speaks your heart keep it
[2:09:39] closed guard your heart
[2:09:42] oh hallelujah
[2:09:44] i'm getting ready to wind up shortly
[2:09:46] and then nothing could separate us from
[2:09:48] that love
[2:09:50] of god that is in christ jesus
[2:09:52] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:09:55] lord so it's a conference
[2:09:56] because god isn't going to let the
[2:09:58] righteous perish with the wicked there
[2:10:00] is an escape there's going to be a
[2:10:01] rapture god has made a way he always has
[2:10:03] a way of escape do you see me made away
[2:10:05] from moses for joshua for david for
[2:10:06] daniel he has to make a way for his
[2:10:08] bride
[2:10:10] escape follow me into safety into the
[2:10:12] token the holy ghost itself
[2:10:15] follow me into adoption perfection and
[2:10:16] other ephesians follow me to your
[2:10:19] inheritance
[2:10:24] blessed be the name of the
[2:10:26] lord i've preached this many times but i
[2:10:29] want to close out with this
[2:10:34] maybe it helps our young brother young
[2:10:35] sister who's here today maybe listening
[2:10:37] on the internet
[2:10:39] on this way of
[2:10:40] escape there's no scripture
[2:10:43] that says remember moses
[2:10:46] remember david remember joshua remember
[2:10:48] psalms remember daniel there's nothing
[2:10:49] like it
[2:10:53] but the bible says remember lord's wife
[2:10:56] because she was given the opportunity
[2:11:00] to escape
[2:11:02] i wonder if people in sodom knew what
[2:11:05] was about to happen and they were given
[2:11:07] the opportunity
[2:11:09] what they would have done with the
[2:11:10] opportunity
[2:11:13] how many people in life said they wish
[2:11:15] they had a better opportunity
[2:11:18] and some people who are privileged have
[2:11:20] better opportunities than others
[2:11:23] how valuable is just an opportunity
[2:11:27] how blessed are we to just have the
[2:11:29] opportunity
[2:11:31] to hear the word
[2:11:34] the opportunity
[2:11:36] to know this message the opportunity to
[2:11:39] know what christ did for us
[2:11:41] the opportunity to not just know but to
[2:11:43] accept it the opportunity to not just
[2:11:45] hear but to recognize the opportunity to
[2:11:48] let us hear and recognize but to act on
[2:11:49] the word
[2:11:52] but lot's wife for whom we don't have
[2:11:54] her first name
[2:11:56] her second name
[2:11:58] she had an opportunity
[2:12:01] we don't have her name but we are
[2:12:02] commanded to remember her
[2:12:05] we remember moses and david and daniel
[2:12:07] and joshua and elijah
[2:12:09] but we are actually commanded by god
[2:12:13] to remember lord's wife
[2:12:17] i preached this you could forget how to
[2:12:18] do algebra how to interpret literature
[2:12:21] how to relate to history you can forget
[2:12:24] the periodic table
[2:12:26] pythagoras theorem
[2:12:29] you get other verses of
[2:12:31] scripture but make sure you remember
[2:12:33] lot's wife
[2:12:40] it remains a message we have to preach
[2:12:43] because if there's an instruction to
[2:12:45] remember this thing there's something in
[2:12:47] there that is an anchor and a note star
[2:12:50] to us so that we don't make the mistake
[2:12:52] that she made
[2:12:54] given the opportunity that she had and
[2:12:56] given the opportunity we all have this
[2:12:58] morning to walk in this way of escape
[2:13:06] we know the story abraham and lot had
[2:13:08] conflict
[2:13:09] touching it last week
[2:13:11] and abraham being who he was said lot
[2:13:13] you choose it don't make sense we fight
[2:13:15] on issues and this we have to be bigger
[2:13:17] than these things and he said a lot
[2:13:18] wherever you choose you go
[2:13:20] and lot made his choice again we read
[2:13:22] the quote you have to make a choice yes
[2:13:24] no you have to decide you are here by
[2:13:26] decision what you do later this evening
[2:13:28] is by decision what you do tomorrow on
[2:13:29] the holiday is by decision what you do
[2:13:31] on tuesday is a choice what you do on
[2:13:33] wednesday night when it's church is a
[2:13:34] choice
[2:13:36] this friday night we have zoom premium
[2:13:37] that's a choice
[2:13:40] you can make it the most important thing
[2:13:42] on friday that's your choice
[2:13:44] you could make sunday so it's a priority
[2:13:48] i preached this through the whole
[2:13:50] pandemic when we couldn't gather
[2:13:51] together people had a choice but how
[2:13:53] they approach the live stream services
[2:13:57] and you know what god is the one marking
[2:13:59] your papers
[2:14:00] not the pastor not the assistant pastor
[2:14:02] not the elders and the deacons of the
[2:14:04] choices
[2:14:06] god mark any papers still a choice
[2:14:11] lot didn't go to sodom with bad
[2:14:13] intentions
[2:14:16] some of you in school on your job you
[2:14:18] didn't go to your job some of you thank
[2:14:19] god to get a job you didn't go there
[2:14:21] with bad intentions
[2:14:24] you didn't go there saying i want to i
[2:14:25] want to fall and say no you open up a
[2:14:28] business not with bad intentions
[2:14:32] but the road to hell is paved
[2:14:35] with good intentions
[2:14:40] and i think brother gideon in a session
[2:14:42] we had a few weeks ago speak about
[2:14:44] lot pitched his tent to sodom
[2:14:47] he leaned to sodom his direction was
[2:14:49] sodom
[2:14:51] and i preached so many times lot was
[2:14:53] stronger
[2:14:55] and strong enough
[2:14:57] for sodom and didn't realize that his
[2:15:00] family wasn't strong enough
[2:15:03] i wonder if lot understood the impact on
[2:15:06] his family if he would have still gone
[2:15:08] there
[2:15:09] sometimes we
[2:15:10] overestimate the people around us
[2:15:14] sometimes we have expectations that
[2:15:16] people around us that are beyond their
[2:15:18] ability to fly where we could fly
[2:15:21] something we need to think beyond just
[2:15:23] ourselves
[2:15:24] because we could almost argue that lot
[2:15:26] was somewhat selfish
[2:15:29] because he didn't understand the impact
[2:15:31] it would have on his children i wonder
[2:15:33] if lot could have seen a preview of what
[2:15:35] was going to happen if he would have
[2:15:36] still done what he did
[2:15:38] but friends it's unfortunate in life we
[2:15:40] don't get the preview
[2:15:42] we don't get the opportunity to see
[2:15:44] what's going to happen before it happens
[2:15:47] and then we end up making choices and
[2:15:49] decisions that we would regret and we
[2:15:51] say to ourselves if i only knew better i
[2:15:54] would have done something different
[2:15:56] and that's why i said this morning don't
[2:15:57] wait until it becomes a crisis in your
[2:16:00] life to come back to the altar don't
[2:16:02] wait for it to be a crisis in your life
[2:16:05] to get back onto the way of escape
[2:16:09] and god as he would with every prophet
[2:16:11] on the earth say abraham shall i hide
[2:16:13] from you what i'm about to do
[2:16:17] i'm about to go and bring judgment
[2:16:19] the stench of sin
[2:16:21] the stench of this thing has reached me
[2:16:23] and i can't let it exist the way it is
[2:16:25] anymore i need to bring judgement what
[2:16:27] do you think is happening in the world
[2:16:28] when brother branham was here he was
[2:16:29] looking around it he saw that lady in
[2:16:32] the mall with the makeup he said that's
[2:16:34] what i saw when i went down to hell
[2:16:36] he said hell is already on here that no
[2:16:39] how much years ago is it
[2:16:42] he wanted another lady was sick
[2:16:44] when he saw the makeup on her face he
[2:16:46] couldn't believe that she willingly put
[2:16:48] it like that because he said that's what
[2:16:50] i saw when i went into hell
[2:16:54] and you realize hell is on the earth
[2:16:57] do you realize hell is on the earth
[2:17:04] has a lot in his family moved into sodom
[2:17:07] son of moved
[2:17:08] into them
[2:17:10] you go to your job you go to your school
[2:17:12] you
[2:17:13] talk to your family your cousins your
[2:17:15] neighbors your relatives and
[2:17:17] you might be clean
[2:17:20] at the beginning but if you don't watch
[2:17:22] carefully
[2:17:23] you don't realize when you're not just
[2:17:25] in sodom but now sodom is in you
[2:17:31] the styles the fashion the music the
[2:17:33] entertainment the desires the desire to
[2:17:36] fit into compromise
[2:17:37] the haircut the clothes they find the
[2:17:40] clothes
[2:17:41] you just you're getting pressure
[2:17:44] because you're feeding on it you're
[2:17:46] allowing it to affect you
[2:17:52] and i preached on it
[2:17:53] and we saw how god justified peter how
[2:17:56] oh peter rather justified lot
[2:17:59] in second peter 2
[2:18:01] verse 7 and delivered just lord vex with
[2:18:03] the filthy conversation of the wicked so
[2:18:06] lot was there in sodom but being
[2:18:09] bothered by the filthy conversations
[2:18:12] shame on you men women who not bothered
[2:18:17] lot in sodom and the bible said vexed
[2:18:20] with the filthy conversation of the
[2:18:22] wicked
[2:18:23] you there in the lunch room on your job
[2:18:25] and then you did it not vexing you
[2:18:29] it's not bothering you you're not
[2:18:30] disturbed by it in fact you're you're
[2:18:31] danny middle
[2:18:33] brother so and so sister so and so
[2:18:40] verse 8 of 2nd peter 4 says for that
[2:18:44] righteous man lot
[2:18:46] lot maintain a testimony you know
[2:18:48] that righteous man dwelling among them
[2:18:51] in seeing and hearing vexed his
[2:18:54] righteous soul from day to day with
[2:18:56] their unlawful deeds
[2:18:59] so lot is sitting there and he's
[2:19:01] bothered he is stressed out he's
[2:19:02] affected
[2:19:06] and we know it
[2:19:07] the angel spoke a lot
[2:19:09] see listen judgment is here you know
[2:19:11] i've given you an opportunity to escape
[2:19:14] you don't have to die you don't have to
[2:19:15] suffer you don't have there's a way out
[2:19:17] of this world there's a way out of this
[2:19:19] thing
[2:19:21] and lot's wife she heard the message
[2:19:24] she knew the message not just on the lot
[2:19:26] ministry she grew up under abraham
[2:19:30] she would have known abraham's testimony
[2:19:32] knew what they believed but beyond that
[2:19:36] she recognized the angels
[2:19:38] it wasn't a man came to speak to him as
[2:19:39] he angels came
[2:19:41] she would have heard the angels talking
[2:19:42] about they came into his house
[2:19:46] she knew the message
[2:19:49] she knew about praying she knew about
[2:19:51] church you know about being in
[2:19:52] convention she knew
[2:19:54] enough about the way god operated
[2:19:57] and she listened to the warning
[2:19:59] she even
[2:20:00] responded to the warning
[2:20:03] she knew the truth she heard a warning
[2:20:05] she was given the opportunity
[2:20:07] he could begin to play something softly
[2:20:10] and she started to walk
[2:20:12] on the way of escape
[2:20:15] and friends this is why it is such a
[2:20:17] painful message to preach
[2:20:20] because it's truly not he who starts
[2:20:23] because she responded
[2:20:25] [Music]
[2:20:26] and god just said one thing
[2:20:28] don't look back
[2:20:30] if you want to be a christian be a real
[2:20:33] christian
[2:20:34] but if i'm saying many times you want to
[2:20:36] be a bum be the best bum
[2:20:38] you want to be a christian be the best
[2:20:40] christian live your whole life for the
[2:20:42] lord
[2:20:44] but as she is walking
[2:20:52] the sodom in her
[2:20:55] begin to overwhelm her
[2:20:58] i would have preached that lot was i've
[2:21:00] been walking down because he's leading
[2:21:01] his family
[2:21:03] saying come on come on come on we can
[2:21:05] make it come on
[2:21:07] let's get out of here
[2:21:10] [Music]
[2:21:16] we don't know at what point
[2:21:18] he stopped here in our footsteps
[2:21:22] and the most painful part
[2:21:23] is he couldn't even look back to see
[2:21:25] what was happening
[2:21:28] honey everything okay
[2:21:31] you there
[2:21:33] i'm not hearing you
[2:21:35] are you there
[2:21:37] daughter are you hearing her
[2:21:40] no daddy i can't hear anymore
[2:21:43] and you can't even look back
[2:21:45] to see if she's okay
[2:21:49] [Music]
[2:21:52] lot had to keep
[2:21:55] walking
[2:21:56] along the way of escape
[2:22:00] because if he had also looked back he
[2:22:02] finished
[2:22:05] i want to encourage you friends
[2:22:08] this way of escape is before you this
[2:22:11] morning
[2:22:13] maybe you've been
[2:22:15] hanging around maybe you've been tipped
[2:22:17] to win maybe you've had one foot in one
[2:22:20] foot out

[2:22:22] and i don't know your condition if
[2:22:24] you're listening
[2:22:26] on the internet to stay
