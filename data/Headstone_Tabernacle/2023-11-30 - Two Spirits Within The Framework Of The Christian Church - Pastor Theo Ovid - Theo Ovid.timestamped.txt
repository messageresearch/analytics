[24:35] right after the service God bless you
[24:37] and thank you for being here
[24:39] tonight I have two portion of script I
[24:41] like to read Ephesians
[24:43] 41-13 and Matthew
[24:45] 24:4 script reading tonight Ephesians
[24:49] 4 and he gives some Apostles and some
[24:52] prophets and some evangelists and some
[24:54] pastors and teachers for the Perfection
[24:57] of the SA Saints for the work of the
[24:59] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[25:02] Christ till we all come in the unity of
[25:04] the faith out of the knowledge of the
[25:07] Son of God unto a perfect man unto the
[25:10] measure of the stature of the fullness
[25:13] of Christ and Matthew 24:24 reads for
[25:16] there shall arise false christs and
[25:20] false prophets and shall show great
[25:22] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[25:24] were possible they shall deceive the
[25:27] very elect let us pray again father we
[25:29] thank you for the word the written word
[25:31] and I pray you would comeing upon it
[25:33] Lord Lord I couldn't wait to get here is
[25:36] all whole day waiting to come to this
[25:39] Pulpit Lord as you open up the word in
[25:41] our way we have never seen before may it
[25:44] bring Clarity father may it be the
[25:46] vision be made plain tonight that is not
[25:49] a game is not a play thing father but
[25:51] it's a reality that is coming right
[25:53] before us granted father in Jesus name I
[25:55] ask it amen amen you may be seated oh oh
[25:57] blessed be the name of the Lord Praise
[26:01] His wonderful name thank you Jesus
[26:04] hallelujah praise
[26:06] God so since I'm under a great
[26:08] expectation tonight see what the Lord
[26:10] will do sir and the title I have for
[26:13] tonight's message is two Spirits within
[26:16] the framework of the Christian Church
[26:19] title of it two Spirits within the free
[26:22] of the CH Christian Church all right so
[26:24] let's uh hit the ru tonight amen
[26:27] Hallelujah but when Moses when God told
[26:31] Moses take off your shoes Moses on Holy
[26:34] Ground I've heard the cries of my people
[26:37] I've remembered my promises I made to
[26:39] Abraham I'm going to send you down to
[26:41] deliver them now Moses know that voice
[26:44] was God how because it was
[26:49] scriptural listen listen close now
[26:53] anybody that passes and see a voice and
[26:55] if it is not a scriptural voice
[26:58] leave it
[26:59] alone there's a slight echo on the
[27:02] platform listen anybody that passes and
[27:05] and and and sees a voice if it's not a
[27:08] scriptural voice leave it alone if the
[27:11] Bible says so then believe it because
[27:14] it's a scriptural voice people seeing
[27:17] angels and so forth Joseph Smith seen
[27:19] one I different with Jose Smith because
[27:22] it was not scriptural now I don't say
[27:24] the man never saw an angel I'm not the
[27:27] disput the man's word there have been
[27:29] many angels but Paul said Galatians 1:
[27:32] 18 if a angel come down from heaven and
[27:35] preach any other gospel than which was
[27:38] preached unto you let him be a curse so
[27:41] man seeing light man seeing Angel Angel
[27:43] tell them this and tell them that now
[27:44] tell them bring the angel and come
[27:46] because they have a word to examine the
[27:47] Angel by Hallelujah it has to be a
[27:51] scriptural voice so all these brothers
[27:54] like Moses and William branam and all
[27:56] them they heard a voice voice but the
[27:58] voice was tied to the scriptures so that
[28:01] means you have to back up with a
[28:02] scriptural voice not not a message voice
[28:05] a scriptural voice because the message
[28:08] itself come from the scriptures oh give
[28:10] the Lord some Praises do you see that
[28:12] tonight do you catch it tonight now so
[28:15] watch this now so
[28:18] Satan used his
[28:20] ministers oh I didn't know that see the
[28:23] minister yes Matthew
[28:25] 24:24 false anointed one
[28:28] since the prophet left in
[28:31] 1965 false anointed and false teachers
[28:34] come among the bride with all kind of
[28:37] interpretations and ideas and
[28:39] inspiration to try to deceive the end
[28:42] time
[28:43] bride but the way I'm seeing that my
[28:46] totally my totally blown it's not
[28:48] churches you know it's not people saying
[28:50] I want to get infu it's Lucifer Lucifer
[28:54] trying to keep the bride away from her
[28:56] promises keep keep the bride from coming
[28:58] to Perfection keep the bride from having
[29:00] a Revival keep the pride from breaking
[29:02] out is Lucifer at work again oh glory to
[29:06] God hallelujah I hope you see the way
[29:09] I'm seeing it tonight now watch this God
[29:11] spoke to that prophet and say seven T
[29:14] give faith it wasn't the prophet saying
[29:16] that you know God spoke to him seven T
[29:19] will gather the right together seven T
[29:21] will show the out repair seven T will
[29:23] give the bright fith seven T will Bri
[29:25] Revival God said that
[29:28] not a man God said that oh glory to God
[29:31] hallelujah and that there'll be going to
[29:33] be a Unity of the faith and the devil
[29:35] fought that but we saying what God said
[29:39] Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[29:41] hallelujah glory to God so every false
[29:44] teacher false prophet false messenger
[29:47] was to sent to try to get us off the
[29:49] word the objective is to get you off the
[29:52] word but the bride will stay with the
[29:54] word glory to God hallelujah praise do
[29:57] you believe that tonight Glory I'm not
[29:59] talking about outside the message I'm
[30:01] talking about in the message two spirits
[30:03] in the framework of the Christian Church
[30:06] Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[30:09] glory to God thank you Jesus now we see
[30:12] there are two
[30:15] churches each one have
[30:19] ministers the
[30:23] bride Ministry ministers come from
[30:26] Ephesians 4
[30:29] 11-13 and the bride herself come from
[30:33] second Peter 1
[30:35] 427 that's the scripture Hallelujah and
[30:39] the false Church their ministers come
[30:42] out of Matthew
[30:44] 2424 that is their Ministry 54 Ministry

[41:56] tonight if men and women could only get
[41:58] into the position where their soul their
[42:01] thinking their attitudes would be
[42:03] perfect in the sight of God that would
[42:05] be one of the most powerful churches
[42:08] ever
[42:09] existed therefore if a man or woman
[42:12] could ever get his thoughts and their
[42:14] testimony and their lives so line up so
[42:17] you have to want to think God thoughts
[42:18] you have to want his word you have to
[42:20] want to get in the atmosphere you have
[42:22] to want this thing to get line up with
[42:24] it we don't know God's mind and God's
[42:26] plan and purpose it's in his word we
[42:29] come to church to get line up with it we
[42:31] getting line up with something tonight
[42:33] God is bringing something to us tonight

[42:38] thoughts and testimony in their life
[42:39] shall with the word until the channel of
[42:42] the Holy Spirit would be perfectly one
[42:44] with God what would take place if the
[42:46] man and the woman could ever get lined
[42:48] up where they were where they with
[42:50] freedom from their hearts with the Faith
[42:52] from the innermost many people come to
[42:54] the altar to be prayed for they have int
[42:56] ual Faith they confess their sins and
[42:58] join a church by intellectual Faith he
[42:59] don't look at your intellectual Faith he
[43:02] looks on the heart where on the inside

[54:04] wasn't really observing they they come
[54:06] in watch who were of all ordained to
[54:09] this condemnation on Godly men turning
[54:12] the grace of God into lishness and
[54:14] denying the only God and the Lord Jesus
[54:16] Christ all right we read this and we're
[54:19] going to say this is where I get the
[54:20] core title here from let me show you why
[54:24] Satan hat his book of Revelation he he
[54:26] know that God changes not he knows God
[54:28] is unchangeable in his nature immutable
[54:31] in his ways do Satan knows assuredly
[54:34] that the original church at Pentecost
[54:36] with the power of God Mark 16 in action
[54:39] is the true church that Jesus claim as
[54:41] his own all else is false it has to be
[54:45] now remember Christ in the true church
[54:47] in the last day the true church and
[54:48] false church right Christ in the true
[54:49] church is a continuation of the book of
[54:51] Acts in which was the acts of the Holy
[54:53] Ghost in the apostles was the acts of
[54:55] God among God's people oh glory to God

[55:12] house glory to God this is something
[55:14] inside of here we we tired read this but
[55:16] this is something tonight watch this now
[55:19] but the Book of Revelation shows how
[55:21] that the Antichrist Spirit would come
[55:23] into the church and defile it making it
[55:25] lukewarm evidence of defilement lukewarm
[55:29] evidence of defilement formal evidence
[55:31] of defilement powerless Hallelujah it
[55:35] exposes Satan and be he said now watch
[55:39] watch he he he knows that if the people
[55:44] get the true revelation of the true
[55:47] church what she is what she stands for
[55:51] that she can do the Greater Works she
[55:53] will be an invincible Army that's one
[55:56] part if they get a true revelation of
[56:00] the two Spirits within the framework of
[56:03] the Christian church and by God's spirit
[56:06] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[56:08] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[56:11] her Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise

[1:00:50] glory to God all right let me see we can
[1:00:54] stress you
[1:00:55] know watch brother Bram and you now
[1:00:59] understand how we judged what the church
[1:01:02] was was like what she was at Pentecost
[1:01:06] and what she was in the Apostle age as
[1:01:08] set forth in the word in the book of
[1:01:10] Acts we can apply the same rule to show
[1:01:13] us how the church failed the basic error
[1:01:16] or errors that crept into the first
[1:01:19] church and will reveal in the book of
[1:01:21] Acts and Revelation also in the Epistles
[1:01:23] will become more and more visibly
[1:01:25] manifested in each subsequent age until
[1:01:28] we come to a complete blackout of the
[1:01:30] Lan age now we find out this first key
[1:01:34] that we have received of the Lord there
[1:01:36] comes another less slightly yet
[1:01:37] wonderful truth I said that the true
[1:01:41] church would always try to be like it
[1:01:44] was in the book of
[1:01:45] Acts always that's exactly right but we
[1:01:49] have discovered that the word also
[1:01:51] teaches an invasion of error until
[1:01:55] there's a complete blackout of Truth in
[1:01:56] the last days when the Lord is about to
[1:01:59] appear the question now Aris in our
[1:02:02] minds does God forsake his own and let
[1:02:05] them fall into a state of complete
[1:02:07] deception on no account for the
[1:02:09] scriptures clearly stated in Matthew 24
[1:02:11] that the elect cannot be
[1:02:14] deceived what then the answer is clear
[1:02:17] before us there is a true church and a
[1:02:21] false church so i a ping crazy thing
[1:02:23] tonight there's a true church and a
[1:02:25] false Church there is a True Vine and a
[1:02:27] false Vine but of course that false Vine
[1:02:31] body will try to usur the position of
[1:02:33] the true church and contend that she and
[1:02:36] not the elect are the real and authentic
[1:02:39] the false will try to kill the true it's
[1:02:42] never the true tried to kill the false
[1:02:44] and how does the false try to kill the
[1:02:46] True by trying to
[1:02:48] break your influence kill your
[1:02:53] effect yes
[1:02:55] amen it come like a a crazy housewi
[1:02:58] just all right affecting the husband to
[1:03:02] cancel his authority over the
[1:03:04] children to cancel the authority over
[1:03:07] his home because she fail because she

[1:03:27] watch I want to carry this thought all
[1:03:29] the way through Let's us step further

[1:05:05] of God in power watch and every time God
[1:05:09] moves Satan is there to move also in the
[1:05:11] days of the great wealth Revival most
[1:05:13] people don't know this the insane
[1:05:14] asylums fill up quickly there was a
[1:05:17] great display of devil power to take
[1:05:19] away the attention from God it is
[1:05:21] written that in wesle day the people
[1:05:22] would do the most peculiar things that
[1:05:24] were definitely of Satan to try to mock
[1:05:26] the goodness and the power of God in
[1:05:28] Luther day it was said that the miracle
[1:05:29] of his ministry did not lie in the fact
[1:05:31] that he successfully protested the
[1:05:33] Catholic church but the miracle L of
[1:05:34] fact he could and stay sng and sing
[1:05:38] amidst the Fanatics who were often
[1:05:40] filled with guided by wrong
[1:05:43] Spirits that's in Luther's
[1:05:46] message and if you have been aware of
[1:05:48] the last day Ministry you'll notice the
[1:05:49] same invasion of false and wicked
[1:05:52] Spirits I hope and trust you that are
[1:05:54] spiritual minded enough get that and
[1:05:56] capitalize on
[1:05:57] it just to seal the point on the true
[1:06:01] and false Vine mingling and
[1:06:03] demonstrating the two spirits of work
[1:06:06] and brother brandham quote the scripture
[1:06:08] we read just now there 1 John 4 belove
[1:06:10] it believe not every Spirit but try the
[1:06:13] spirits to see whether of God because
[1:06:16] many false prophets have gone out in the
[1:06:19] world and so on hallelujah praise God
[1:06:21] listen to this part now then he talk
[1:06:23] about certain many he quot Judah and so
[1:06:25] on spots in your Feast it cannot be
[1:06:29] denied in the face of these scriptures
[1:06:32] that the true church and the false
[1:06:35] church are
[1:06:39] intertwined having been planted together
[1:06:43] but of different
[1:06:45] seeds remember the parable Jesus give
[1:06:48] when you s seed the next man come and S
[1:06:50] some seeds and then when Harvest Time
[1:06:52] come time of harvest come they say shall
[1:06:54] we separate them he said no no no
[1:06:57] least get the false The Good Seed let
[1:07:00] them grow he said let them grow because
[1:07:03] who planed that let them grow in time of
[1:07:04] harvest we'll reap Angels come and reap
[1:07:06] and separate them Harvest Time Coming Oh
[1:07:10] Glory to God hallelujah praise God all
[1:07:12] right are you ready brother
[1:07:17] BR this concluding chapter was given in
[1:07:19] order to trace the two churches and two
[1:07:21] Spirits from Pentecost to the country
[1:07:25] this age started just as a turn of the
[1:07:26] 20th century as it was to be the age in
[1:07:29] which the true church would return to
[1:07:32] being bride she was at Pentecost watch
[1:07:35] these words we know that there must of
[1:07:39] necessity be a return of dynamic
[1:07:42] power the Believers sense this in their
[1:07:45] spirits and begin crying out to God for
[1:07:48] a new outpouring such as was in the
[1:07:50] first century what seemed to be the
[1:07:54] answer came as many begin to speak in
[1:07:56] tongues and manifest the gifts of the
[1:07:58] Spirit it was then believed that this
[1:08:01] was indeed the long awaited
[1:08:04] restoration it was not for the Lin
[1:08:09] prophecy now can only come after the
[1:08:12] former rain which is the spring or
[1:08:15] teaching reain the lattering den is the
[1:08:18] Harvest rain how could this be the real
[1:08:21] thing when the teaching rain had not
[1:08:23] come
[1:08:24] the prophet messenger who was to be sent
[1:08:28] to teach the people and turn the hearts
[1:08:31] of the children back to the Pentecostal
[1:08:33] fathers had not yet come who's the son
[1:08:36] of man Jesus is a son of man and what
[1:08:39] the son of man does he sow the seed so
[1:08:42] the prophecy Luke 17:30 that the son man
[1:08:45] will reveal again meant that seed was
[1:08:48] coming
[1:08:49] again to SW for a bride oh give the Lord
[1:08:52] a shout
[1:08:54] because rain coming to fall on seed so
[1:08:57] it doesn't make no sense looking at at
[1:08:59] rain and there's no seed here that's
[1:09:01] what he's saying here now all right now
[1:09:02] watch
[1:09:04] thiso thus what was thought to be the
[1:09:07] restoration and the final quickening
[1:09:09] unto the Rapture had not come amen it
[1:09:11] was a mixture of unrighteous partaking
[1:09:13] of the spiritual blessing and manifesta
[1:09:16] in the Holy Ghost as we have kept
[1:09:17] pointing to you it was also the devil
[1:09:21] power here we go as many
[1:09:25] were under the control of
[1:09:28] devils yet no one seemed to realize
[1:09:34] it this is a scary thing you this is
[1:09:38] scary you know when people start to see

[1:10:35] fast to that which is good when anything
[1:10:37] is proven it will be proven right or
[1:10:39] wrong and when there's anything in
[1:10:42] question it should be proven until you

[1:15:02] disciples what did he have to do get the
[1:15:05] very literate type men and women who
[1:15:08] were can't even sign their own name
[1:15:10] Peter and John they were ignorant and
[1:15:11] learn watch but if the intellectual
[1:15:13] wouldn't they wouldn't hear him they
[1:15:15] wouldn't hear him now they got their own
[1:15:17] course they're on their own Road they
[1:15:20] follow that road because they have been
[1:15:21] instructed that way because your pastors
[1:15:24] and their Bishops and Cardinal have
[1:15:26] directed them on that road here we go
[1:15:29] but the holy spirit will bring you back
[1:15:32] to Pentecost every
[1:15:35] time they did it in the scripture to
[1:15:37] everybody and it will do it this day to
[1:15:39] everybody it will bring you back to that
[1:15:41] reality it will bring you back to the
[1:15:43] baptism of power of the
[1:15:45] spirit that would lead you and never
[1:15:48] take one word off the Bible it will stay
[1:15:51] right in the Bible Oh Glory glory to God
[1:15:54] hallelujah they were ignorant fishermen
[1:15:55] and sheep herders didn't know how to
[1:15:57] write didn't know how to read or nothing
[1:15:59] but they had nothing to lose and he got
[1:16:01] to them and they surrendered and when
[1:16:03] they were completely surrendered and
[1:16:05] give themselves over to God God gave
[1:16:07] them a Pentecostal
[1:16:10] reality Oh Glory to God hallelujah he
[1:16:13] led them up to Pentecost and give them
[1:16:14] the Holy Ghost and the very first time
[1:16:17] Eve disbelieve one word from God it
[1:16:19] broke off fellowship with the great
[1:16:21] Union and the minute the church
[1:16:23] disbelieves any one word of God's Bible
[1:16:25] and places it somewhere they break off
[1:16:27] that wonderful Fellowship that was
[1:16:29] offered to them oh praise God and then
[1:16:31] brother R dropped this bomb he said no
[1:16:32] man no woman can believe the devil's lie
[1:16:36] until they disbelieve God's truth so
[1:16:38] before they get under the spirit of
[1:16:39] deception they have to reject truth
[1:16:41] coming to them everybody but a George
[1:16:43] with that Spirit of deception around
[1:16:45] them is because they denying some part
[1:16:46] of the word oh and that denying open my
[1:16:49] back door for the deceiving Spirit to
[1:16:51] come oh God a ling Spirit come and say
[1:16:53] let me go and anoint all of them praise
[1:16:56] God that the prophecy will come true oh
[1:16:58] give the Lord a shout brother Bram said
[1:17:01] this think seriously because we will
[1:17:04] never be able to think anymore after
[1:17:06] this after this Mortal life is over your
[1:17:09] thinking is now you cannot choose after
[1:17:11] this you must choose now for this is the
[1:17:14] day of choosing make your choice now one
[1:17:17] word not a whole decalogue one word she
[1:17:19] questioned God because it was presented
[1:17:21] to her in that light and that word was
[1:17:23] questionable God word cannot be
[1:17:25] questioned he meant just what he said
[1:17:28] and I want to Anchor that one word off
[1:17:30] and we lose our
[1:17:31] fellowship unto Deb Eternal separ from
[1:17:34] God just as Adam and Eve did we must
[1:17:37] believe God's truth hallelujah Satan
[1:17:40] tried to get in there and spy out and
[1:17:43] hold the human race and he showed he had
[1:17:45] to be Supernatural power to think of it
[1:17:47] so Satan no stupid man all right he used
[1:17:51] this the first time and was successful
[1:17:53] he done it ever since and still
[1:17:55] successful to a certain extent he used
[1:17:57] reason instead of fi Satan come to Eve
[1:17:59] and begin to reason with the word of God
[1:18:01] is only reasonable and God will not
[1:18:03] destroy you surely you will not die
[1:18:05] that's Satan tactic to begin with he
[1:18:07] still uses the same thing still
[1:18:09] successful with it reasoning and I try
[1:18:12] to reason that's why watch you try to
[1:18:14] reason why would we need the Holy Ghost
[1:18:17] today when the seed is in the
[1:18:21] soul but you someone jumping and
[1:18:24] shouting and praising God and he SE his
[1:18:25] soul and I know who I am you know what I
[1:18:27] mean because teaching position it places
[1:18:28] you who you are the kingdom of
[1:18:33] God Peter had SE his soul white Peter
[1:18:35] didn't say I ain't going to theupper

[1:21:13] going to be adopted Sons with the
[1:21:15] ministry of Jesus Christ behind the
[1:21:18] pulpit adopted evangelists adopted
[1:21:21] Apostles adopted prophets

[1:21:25] pastors do you believe that you will see
[1:21:28] that in your very eyes Oh Glory to God
[1:21:32] hallelujah I'm going to
[1:21:35] close persecution and trials are natural
[1:21:39] normal part of Christian Life hallu
[1:21:41] there's only one thing you can do about
[1:21:43] them commit them all to God judge not
[1:21:46] leave the outworking and fin judgment to
[1:21:49] him thou can not bear them which are
[1:21:52] evil
[1:21:53] thou has tried them with s the apostles
[1:21:55] and a n and found them Liars these
[1:21:58] Ephesians believe that God's people
[1:22:00] ought to be holy yes according to this
[1:22:02] verse they took steps to keep the body
[1:22:04] unle from sin most evidently the
[1:22:07] apostasy had started sin entered the
[1:22:10] church but they were obedient to the
[1:22:11] words of Paul he said put away the
[1:22:13] wicked from among them that coming back
[1:22:16] in put away the wicked from among them
[1:22:19] they were a separated people they had
[1:22:22] come out of the world world and now they
[1:22:23] weren going to let the world come among
[1:22:25] them they would not put up with sin in
[1:22:27] the church Holiness wasn't a phrase with
[1:22:30] them or a figure of speech it was a way
[1:22:33] of life thou try them with say the
[1:22:36] apostles and not as found them Liars my
[1:22:38] that's is a blunt statement that was try
[1:22:41] them who call them Apostle isn't that
[1:22:43] presumptuous what wrers are people to
[1:22:46] try those who call themselves Apostles
[1:22:48] how do we try them I love this you see
[1:22:51] he's quoting the scriptures Galatians 18
[1:22:52] but though we or an angel from heaven
[1:22:55] preach any other gospel among you other
[1:22:57] than what we have preached unto you let
[1:22:59] them be a curse it was the apostles who
[1:23:02] brought the original word to the people
[1:23:05] that original word could not change not
[1:23:07] even a DT or a dash of it Paul knew it
[1:23:11] was God's word who had spoken to him for
[1:23:13] he said even if I come and try to bring
[1:23:16] a second Revelation try to make a little
[1:23:19] change to what I originally give let me
[1:23:21] be a cursed you see Paul knew that the
[1:23:24] first revelation was correct God can't
[1:23:27] give a first revelation and then a
[1:23:29] second Revelation if he did he would be
[1:23:31] changing his mind he can't give he he
[1:23:34] can give a revelation and act to it he
[1:23:36] did it in the Garden of Eden when he
[1:23:38] promised a seed to the woman and then
[1:23:39] later designated the seed to come to
[1:23:41] Abraham then later it would come to the
[1:23:43] bloodline and David and and it was the
[1:23:45] same
[1:23:46] Revelation it only give people more
[1:23:49] information to help them receive and
[1:23:52] understand stand but God's word can
[1:23:54] change and you see what those false
[1:23:56] prophets are doing they are they come
[1:23:59] with their own
[1:24:00] word this is it here right here they
[1:24:04] push the tapes aside they push the books
[1:24:06] aside and they're bringing forth the
[1:24:08] Revelation so the people have confidence
[1:24:10] that is my man woo nobody could bring
[1:24:12] word like that you know oh but it's
[1:24:14] their own
[1:24:15] word but the spirit the prophet and the
[1:24:17] bride will say the same thing and what
[1:24:19] they say will be already said in the
[1:24:22] word so they came with their own word
[1:24:24] those Ephesians knew what the word as
[1:24:27] Paul taught it they were full of the
[1:24:29] Holy Ghost by the Lan of Paul's hands
[1:24:31] they looked those false prophets in the
[1:24:33] eye and said you are not seeing what
[1:24:35] Paul said you are therefore false this
[1:24:38] coming back too straighten their eye I
[1:24:41] don't care how much in the congregation
[1:24:42] how long the preachers straighten their
[1:24:43] eye if you're not saying what Paul said
[1:24:45] you are false
[1:24:47] Hallelujah say oh that sets my heart on
[1:24:50] fire get back to the word it is not you
[1:24:54] that really tries the Apostle Prophet
[1:24:55] and teacher it is the word that tries
[1:24:57] them oh give the Lord some Praises it's
[1:25:00] not you trying to fight up a midur war
[1:25:02] you know oh glory to God is the word
[1:25:05] that is trying them the bride will
[1:25:06] become the word and the spirit will come
[1:25:08] upon the bride Oh Glory to God do you
[1:25:11] love him final
