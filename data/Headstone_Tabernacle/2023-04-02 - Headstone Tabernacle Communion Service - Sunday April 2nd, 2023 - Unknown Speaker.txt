Lord bless you and you enter in now as you hear the the word of God this evening to our hearts amen so God bless you as Italian amen [Music] how true it is that we limit God and time God and he's Eternal we can't do that so tonight we're facing something else now is a communion three years are waiting for church to come in through songs but it's here we're here so be thankful Lord you just let us wait till we appreciate it now there's one thing that I want to say just before we start a communion is this that I believe that we have seen enough in our day that we live in that we ought to really give every all of our being to God we should really serve God I believe that he has blessed us with the direct answer to scripture as brother Perry gave it a few moments ago that we we are we're at that time we're not blind we we see that we're here we've arrived amen and we also can look around and see the the way that the human mind is leading the people that we we can't stay too much longer we've been in a complete insane institution the whole world would be thing so we we're at the end time well as brother Perry ended up there seeing these things are true see that they are true they're not myth they're not just something that we imagine there's something that's been directly given to us by the word of God and manifested publicly before we know we are here we don't own now because again we come back to a watch you see what time it is but we're we know we we've here we're at the time whether God's time I'd imagine someone give a little time that said that if God put up with him uh according if he was the last time one one thousand years or just one day so if a man lives 70 years old and just be a few minutes of God's time right well it said to be four years that would even meantime Hardy get bad he died they just that's how quick it is the whole thing is if it be a lot of time which it doesn't have any time so it's just it's Eternal I believe it's Sarah that ruled Joseph the other night said in Hebrews there he said Daddy when did God come on this thing well where did he come from see he had to have a beginning Jenny did he have to start off the no anything that has a beginning has an end right but it's that which had not a beginning has no end of course he's 10 years old that was kind of a real mouthful for him see how can he even see that knowing that something never did begin not only to him it is today it's a great big dose for me how did it ever begin now we're fixing to observe something here that's really sacred I was told on a few days ago to some very fine Christian gentlemen that uh it's never had this and he understood that we've taken communion literally they take it what they call spiritual communion and uh which as far as communion I say all right because communicate is to talk to see and the brother give me the scripture says brother bran don't you think now a reason I'm saying this is sorrowful the reason I'm saying this so that you would understand what you're doing you know if you're walking it ain't blindly you don't know what you're doing you can't have even confidence if you don't know what you're doing but you must understand what you are doing and why you're doing it he said now if we take the word of God isn't that God that we're taking I said exactly right sir it's true but we read here that they actually claw talk taking the literal Lord's Supper this dude remembered to me said Jesus as often as you take it and remembers me you show forth the Lord's death till he comes see now we are to take it we understand that Saint Paul who ordained it in the church being the prophet of the New Testament of Peter James John all of them they wrote Matthew Mark Luke what Jesus did ascribe but Paul stepped the thing in order he was the uh he was the prophet of the New Testament just as Moses went into the Wilderness to receive the inspiration to write the the five books of uh of the first five books of the Bible where Paul also went into the desert and received inspiration from God to set the New Testament Church in our room and type it with the old under there you had the sacrificial lamb and Israel kept that foreign it was actually used one time coming out of Egypt but then they kept that as a memorial all after the age whereas the law being a shadow of things to come and see now I do believe that communion of what we call communion now is the Lord's suffered now we only have three physical Divine orders left to us one of them is is communion feet washing water baptism that's the only three things that's the Perfection of this reason is that's the only three orders we have we realized that that was the issue given by Saint Paul in the New Testament now if we would say it the communion should just be taken the word I don't believe anyone has a right to take the Lord separate until he's taken the word of the Lord into his heart see because I'll read something for you in a few moments and you'll see now on the same basis we could absolutely justify the Salvation Army they do not believe in any form of water baptism except we don't need it now if we don't need water baptism why are we baptized if a water can't save you the blood saves you I'll agree with that amen amen right that's right the blood station off the water but we must take the water as an outward emotion that an inwardly work of Grace has been done so bless we own communion when we have taken the Lord our sacrifice into us as a matter of spiritual birth interest in his body we live by him by the word we also should symbolize it because it's a commandment repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ or the remission of your sins Paul said I have received to the Lord that which I also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night which is betrayed took bread and break it and give it to the disciples and and said Take and Eat This dude and remembers to me for his office you take this bread you show forth his death till he comes now we find out that in that they had people who comment this uh precious brother very dear brother he came and he said I never I never you take a program I don't understand what it is I've been taught the other side I said remember we will admit that Saint Paul said it in order in the early Christian Church they went from church to house the house broke the bread and singles to the heart and so forth now I said he did but is in the church Galatians 1 8 he said if an angel from heaven comes and says anything else let it be a curse amen the same one ahead of me rebaptized again from the uh baptism of John to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you see there are three things that we must three things that we must do is simple Lord's Supper deep ocean water baptism see there's he said well the now the Salvation Army takes it from the point the dying sea when he died he wasn't baptized here Jesus said he would be in heaven that's exactly the truth that's exactly but you see he he he only recognized Jesus right there in an hour he was dying see [Laughter] Lord remember me and Jesus Christ be baptized and refuse to do it then that'll be between you and God Amen same thing in communion now when we take this communion it isn't just the things that come up here and go to eat some bread and I believe I'm a Christian but if you notice the Bible said he that eateth and drinketh unworthily shall be guilty of the blood and the body of the Lord you've got to live a life that that before the people that and before God and the people that show that you're that you are sincere are just a moment longer now in the Old Testament when the sacrifice was made a statue or an ordinance and so is water baptism on ordinance all of his Commandments that he might have a right to enter into the tree of life now notice in this now that in that first when it was first in ordinance of God to bring a sacrifice to the church and uh to the temple and the altering offer your gift and for your sins the sacrifice of a lamb or I can just imagine seeing some Jewish a brother coming down the road knowing that he was guilty and he goes to the altar or brings his fat box or whatever he had Iran lamb something he brought down the road Justice sin serious he could come you walked up there keeping God's artists just as sincerely as he could then he laid his hands up on it confessing his sins of a priest placing this his sins upon the lamb and the Lamb's throat was cut and uh and then died for him as he laid there the little lamb kicking and bleeding his hands being full of blood and flying all over him a little lamb plate and died he will realize that he had sinned and something had to die in his place therefore he was offering this Lamb's death for his death these the lamb died in his place and a man done it was sincerity with deepness of his heart finally over and over it kept going until finally it become a tradition commandment of God became a tradition to the people now we'll see it's a swords or David yeah I better offer of Abdullah he went out well Lord see there's no sincerity in it there's no understanding to it or we don't want to take communion like that that's the same thing as we come to a large table on this uh 35 no big report Isaiah 60. now let me take that back I I believe it's Isaiah 28 that's where we find this I'm pretty sure that's the right chapter he said priesip must be up on precept and line upon line up online here's a little darling okay for that what's good for stamina lips other tongue so I speak to these people and this is the rest these are all the tables of the Lord has become full of vomit who can I teach Doctrine who can I make to understand see I think that was the right scripture I did 20. who can I make understand Doctrine see the table now we find out today that this great thing that we're fixing to do tonight is commemoration of his death and his body that we believe that we eat daily or just got through Eden as our brother preached to us take in the word of God we believe it with all of our hearts we sit manifested we should give unto us we said Vindicated we feel it in our lives and we must come to this with a deep conscience of what we're doing not just because it's an order you go into church and many times they get out an old silly cracker or some kind of a or something breaking up a light bread or or something and and break it up and people who smoke drink everything else because they're a member of the church they come and take the large supper well that's filthiness before God even the sacrifice said your holy days your sacrifice become a stance in my nose yet we are paying them to make that sacrifice but the way they treated it it become a stunt sacrifice that he ordained that's the way we take the word of God too many Christians today so-called does that we stand up here and teach this word and say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever and entice the things that he promised us that he would honor [Applause] in his nose he will not receive it by many that's Reason by our traditional habits you don't take the Lord's Supper by tradition you take it because it's the love of God in your heart and keeping the Commandments of God that's what you take it for so if you don't take it in sincerity just it's a tradition well our church observes communion once every Sunday or once every month or twice a year and you go upstairs my time and I'm going to take the communion why it's a stink God see that's just a tradition even like anything else sincere God wants the depths of your heart you remember the very God that brought you here on Earth is the one-year servant your goodness because he said so because it's his order then we want to come up with deepness ignoring that God God's grace that we have been saved and we we love him and we feel this presence and we we sit uh change our lives or our whole being is changed we're different people we don't live like we used to we don't think like we used to like in the book here and a small air was talk about the the two books being one The Book of Life The First Book of Life coming up was when you were born that was your natural birth okay but then one time way back down in there there was a little green of life as I was explaining to some of the young sisters at the house this afternoon see there's a little green of Life laying there that you'd wonder where did it come from what what these strange things a saying is taken for myself I just go see William Branham well 40 years ago the William Brown they used to the same one tonight there's somebody back there said we rang he was a rank Rascal because I was born of Charles and ellebrand in that nature I was a sinner I came to a rural a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there too was another is in there by God in the same body two Natures in there well I only cater to one is it growed out good as the baby Dead Eye first thing in orbit come a liar become everything else that's a sinner because I raised up that way but down in there was a little speck of Life all the time I used to remember as a little boy I hope I'm not horny children but Floyd uh sitting out in the uh on the creek Bank might sit there and look one at night time talking Mom they're going on out to their rest and uh them days they were Sinners the whole Christianity in our homes are all in our own my drinking at parties and caring it made me sick I take my my rain on and my dog and grow up the woods to stay all night in the wintertime I'm hunt until the party was over maybe daylight in the morning come home wouldn't be over I'll lay on top of the shed and sleep waiting for daylight to break then I'd think of how the times then being out there in the summer time get uh sticks and put it down for a little wind break or if it rains later I have a pole sticking in the water fishing my whole clean dog laying there after looking here you know last winter I came back here one night I'll build a fire right here when I was waiting for my old dog here to treat and uh I had a fire it was froze five inches deep in the ground [Music] where did you come from foreign what hard house did they bring you out or what about where'd you come from see that little fire stick while it was frozen everything in our building followed up here besides the freezing uh that a heat element being here on a big old long drive and yet here you are you're alive where'd you come from what was it there was another William brand of eternal life down there from the the was placed in each one of you can make a similar thing it was working now look up to the trees I think me I'll see you fall off last year and why are you back there again where'd you come from that brought you here see it was that eternal life working in the Box now thing one day as I walked on their boys talking don't never smoke drink so forth and the young fellows you know I got older see there was something moving but yet all it wants to ask looked up and I said I'm not the son of Charles now LeBron there's something called like a little eagle another chicken or something at the honor somewhere whoever you are open up I welcome home there's something in Decline then I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was pulled up on it they need to give the girls ah that old life was forgiven but in the sea of God's forgiveness to Never Be Remembered against me no more they now we stand Justified as though we never had sin in the presence of God remember we come to the Lord's table we must come in reverence love and respect the look where we would have been if it hadn't been for him look where it was it therefore Paul I think it sent it hopefully when you come together to eat Harry one for the other that is in other words just wait a few minutes three check yourself out and if you know a brother's in there just about to do something that's wrong or something uh and you pray for him too see if Terry won the other wait just a minute pray if there's any feelings between you or something don't do it don't make it right first see go straighten that up first because they want to come here just as cure as we can be in our thoughts one another and to God and to each other and then we come in Fellowship around the table of the Lord see and we do this because that we are giving thanks to him and among one another eating your bread between each other drinking the wine between your asses blood and his flesh except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you see you see that's what the Bible says except you do it there's no life you see you are then more or less showing you are ashamed to identify yourself as a Christian because of the life that you live and then this is really The Showdown then if you don't do it you have no life if you do do it unworldly you're guilty of the body of the Lord same thing in water baptism if we say we believe on Jesus Christ he saved us from sin and we're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ while we bring we bring disgrace to him we do the things that's wrong and we we have to pay for that and another thing when we do that we are trying to profess one thing and do another that's a trouble of this today what I think I'm saying us me in the church that the Lord God has let me speak to in these last hours that we believe we're in the closing time we believe that God has given us a message it's been ordained David of God of God short of God now we must come to him with reverence and with love and with with the purity of heart and mind and soul for our sin Horizon when right Among Us will be the holy spirit will speak out like it did in an inner knife and Sapphire amen is arriving see and we are now you just remember that see the God is going to dwell among these people that's what he wants to do now we can receive the message as Sin if I was a young man hunting for a wife and I could find a wife I said she's just perfect she's a Christian she's a lady she's older I Got Confidence no matter how much confidence how much I think she's not I've got to receive her she's got to receive me see upon these vows well it's the same thing we find is a message we see it's right we see God vindicates it's right it's perfectly right year after year year after year continues right continues right everything it says happens just exactly the way he said now we know it's right but see don't do it from an intellectual standpoint if you do you got a second-handed religion we don't want a second-hand religion something if somebody else has experienced it and we are living off of their testimony as I believe it was Jesus said to pilate uh uh or something in the world I was thinking he said there just a few moments ago uh who told you that it was a revealed to you how did you know these things in other words I don't know it's what the word is now it's been a long time since I've read but how did you how'd you know this how who reveals to you about him being the Son of God who revealed it if some man tell you that or as he said is it my Father in Heaven which has revealed it to you did you learn it a hand or or Revelation from God is this communion just something I grew up for honors say well the rest of them take this I will too it's a revelation [Music] I love you and I love him and we're taking this together as a singular of our love to God and our love and fellowship to one another now I want to read some from the scripture and then I guess whichever way brother Perry desires today I wish you'd read it with me if you got your Bible First Corinthians the uh the 11th chapter and begin with the 23rd verse and then also and our Tabernacle we've always observed this and feet washing always because they go hand in hand together I believe the brother announced it Wednesday night because of the crowds and you don't have enough room to get the people in for feet washing they're going to observe this Wednesday night now 23rd verse of the 11th chapter of First Corinthians this is Paul now remember keep this in mind Galatians 1 8. if we are an angel from heaven preaches any other gospel unto you in this gospel that he had preached let him be a concursor for I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he gave thanks you break it said Take and Eat This is my body which is broken for you this dude in remembrance of me now let me stop right here to say but take in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ in this communion does not mean that that communion is the literal Body of Christ that's Catholic I do not believe is that's right I believe it's only an ordinance that God made with us it isn't the actual body it's not it's really a little piece of kosher bread that's right it's just an ordinance neither do I believe that the baptism of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ in water just forgive your sins is perhaps people sitting here who come from the apostolic church I mean the United Pentecostal Church which they teach that but you see I I do not believe that the water forgives sins or if it was in Jesus died in vain amen I believe it's only an ordinance of God see to show that you have been forgiven but to be baptized for regeneration no I I don't believe that I don't believe that water producing neither I believe it is bread and wine has anything to do with you only keeping an ordinance that God has ordained for us to do 16. as every water baptism it's the same thing our biggest compelling to us to do it that you've done it all for our example and you've done this for our example and he wore Street for our example now after the same manner also 25th verse after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had set sin this cup is the New Testament in my blood this Duty as off as you drink it in remembrance of me far as off till he comes huh therefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord let me stop just a minute the reason he said this she noticing a verse sure no chapter that he said I understand when you when you come together you're eating either getting drunk that the Lord's table they misunderstood it you see they just flattened in see just like people doing today just live any kind of life and take it see he said you've got homes to eat and think but this is an ordinance that we should keep seeing now let's let a man examine himself and so let him eat all the bread and drink of the cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eat it and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body here question amen you live before everybody as a Christian and if you take that and don't live as a Christian you're not Discerning the Lord's body you're putting the stomach back in somebody else's weight see as they see you trying to do that and they're not living what you're supposed to live see you're not Discerning the Lord's body now that's what it what's the curse of it is for this taught us many are weak and sickly among you and many are asleep the right translation that word bro peria is dead for if we for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged that's right we judge ourselves we will be judged but when we are judged we are chastened out the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world see body attached to the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat pray one for the other see and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come knock together into condemnation and the rest I will set an order when I come see now in other words don't just come to take it as a as I said a lot of robot talk to Jews or sacrifice they it was wonderful it's given by God but it got to a place where they didn't do it and sincerity in reverence in an order then it becomes just a it become a stanch in his nose now the same thing is the r coming to take the Lord's Supper amen that we must come knowing what we are doing just like when you go into the water to be baptized
