another people he belonged to another race altogether oh hallelujah isn't that right oh hallelujah moses just didn't know it yet oh hallelujah but it come down to a time of uncertainty for him oh hallelujah because he thought he was this only to find out he was that he thought his mother was this woman only to find out his mother is this other woman hallelujah isn't that right he thought he was an egyptian only to find out he was a hebrew he thought he believed in all these egyptian gods only to find out that there's only one true god oh holland you've got to meet him for yourself and not another oh and moses spent 40 years on the backside of the desert oh hallelujah waiting waiting waiting hallelujah oh he might have been uncertain coming all the way up there thinking about himself thinking about a mistake he made thinking about the egyptian he killed thinking about this thinking about that but when moses met the pillar of fire when moses wet the burning bush there was

your healing he paid for your deliverance he paid for your baptism of the holy ghost and fire he prayed for your salvation on that old rugged cross oh i dare you to believe it tonight i dare you to take the word of god and shove it in the face of the devil and say here i am here's why i'm searching here's why i shout here's why i worship here's why praise god here's why i'm not afraid oh hallelujah of the hour of flight by day of the pestilence that walketh in darkness or the destruction of walking on tunde noonday though ten thousand follow my right hand it shall not come nighty tonight oh hallelujah give him a shout of praise oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah oh isn't that right isn't that right moses might have been uncertain all his life but when he met that pill of fire here was a certain sound here was a short word here was something he could rest his soul upon hallelujah hallelujah when he was finished his countenance was changed his behavior was changed his actions was changed his wife asked him where you're going i'm going down to egypt plan what for to let god's people go oh holland that's all he had in his mind that's all he had in his heart oh hallelujah god turned the purpose of his help into moses oh hell and he went down there as a servant of god oh hallelujah hallelujah god told moses he said bring my people to back to this mountain to worship me to worship namaste god of israel hallelujah to worship the holy one to worship the pure one to worship the only god there is or the creator of heaven on earth bring my people back to worship me moses was handed a one-way ticket from god himself it was stamped from god himself he had a one-way ticket to bring the people back to the mountain to worship god therefore no more amount of devils in hell could stop moses no power in egypt could stop moses and i tell you church there's no power on earth that could stand against a blood wash once god has made away tonight oh and

have to be grounded in this word that we're talking about isn't that right i heard a story one time of a guy who was trying to grow a tree amen and it was growing up but he found it was kind of weak and frail and he didn't understand so he called a friend of him of his own and he said come take a look at this tree here and his friend took a look at the tree and he didn't stay long he said brother i know exactly what's wrong and the brother said well what's wrong he said this tree's got too much supports it's got too much stuff holding it up amen probably had it since it was a sapling but now that it's growing up he said you've got to remove the supports he said when you remove the supports hallelujah then it begins to get strong because now you are opening it up you are making it vulnerable to the wind and to the rain he said this tree has never shaken before he said you have to shake this tree man this tree's got to take some pressure man this tree's got to take some battle man and when that happens he said the tree naturally begins to grow its roots deeper into the ground to handle the pressure to handle the storm to handle the facilities of life or the tree knows what to do oh he says it's built in but you've got to remove the supports and i feel tonight oh there may be no people in this building here tonight maybe god's removed the supports in your life but he wants to see what you are going to do with the word of god that you have heard all these years are you going to apply it are you going to stand up on a rock oh hallelujah are you gonna fall to the

glory give him honor give him thanksgiving at the remembrance of his holiness oh hallelujah i'll skip some of this down here amen when the prophet talked about be certain of god he talked about that woman in the land harley isn't all right he was an honorable woman isn't that right he said she must have been that type of woman at elijah hallelujah because god chose a woman out of all the women that was in israel he chose that woman to entertain his prophet he would have never chosen an immoral woman the prophet said oh hallelujah and there's something about you tonight oh there's something about you that god loves you have found grace in god's side tonight oh holly and god has sent the word of god to you tonight oh hallelujah has he has a commanded blessing upon your life tonight oh hallelujah prophet said she had a little baby to raise and she was struggling to try and make a living for the fellow and finding brine in the bread isn't that right finally finding out that the bread has begun to cease isn't that right the oil was running dry and so forth isn't that right it was coming to a place one day when she went in to look at her little fellow she said she seemed seeing her sleeves out torn oh she might have looked herself in the mirror seeing how she left that table with something on there for the baby but now her own cheekbones were sticking out her little frail looking arms she didn't mind it for herself but a little boy oh she didn't want to see him die isn't that right holly musician could get ready so finally one day she went to the meal barrel and she said there was just one handful of me left he said and she went over to the cruise to see how much oil and just about a good tablespoon full that stood between her and death oh what a condition oh everything run right down to the end of the line isn't that right down to the end of our own ability isn't that right everything run right down to her own hollow what she could do isn't that right

everything that you know how and met every requirement that god has required that's where faith takes a whole that's where faith comes in holly isn't that right if you've met every requirement that god required you to do oh holly then sometimes god tests your faith to see what kind of reaction that you have on your action oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right so after you check up after you've done all that you have to do then it god test your faith he said that's where faith comes in after you met every requirement that god required you to do then it requires faith for you to stand there and believe and be certain of god that god is able to do what he said he would do that god won't leave you comfortless but that he would come to you yet a little while on the world see me no more but you are going to see me hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen oh he's going to come to you he's going to manifest himself to you oh hallelujah and the prophet said on the power of the devil

come god's promise is true and we ask him for anything he said we don't touch we believe that what we ask for we will get because we met god's requirements and given our life to him and surrendered our will to him oh our lives our soul all that we are you can make play something softly all that we are have surrendered to god and then our lives condemn us not our hearts condemn us not isn't that right then we can have whatever we ask for if he abide in me and my word in you then you can ask what you will and it shall be done unto you hallelujah pray that's his promise the prophet said just be
