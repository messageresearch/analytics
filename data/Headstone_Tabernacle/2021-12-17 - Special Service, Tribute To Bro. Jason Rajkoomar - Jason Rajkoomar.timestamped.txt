[10:44] jason rajkumar
[10:47] he is the son that you would like to
[10:48] have
[10:50] the brother that you would want to have
[10:53] the son-in-law you'd like to have
[10:56] the believer you'd like to have
[10:59] that's the kind of person
[11:01] that jesus was loved jesus and was not
[11:04] ashamed
[11:05] his shout was one of the loudest in
[11:07] church he always knew when jason was
[11:08] there
[11:09] he had a bubbly effervescent personality
[11:12] such a joy
[11:13] original
[11:15] authentic
[11:16] there's nobody like him
[11:18] he's virtually one in a million very
[11:21] rare you get
[11:22] somebody with all these qualities that
[11:25] make them a person that you want to be
[11:27] around
[11:29] make jokes make you laugh
[11:31] say cute things
[11:33] that was jason he was real
[11:36] he wasn't uh imposter
[11:39] impersonator
[11:40] he was just who he was in god
[11:43] and without a doubt
[11:45] he loved the lord
[11:46] and we really
[11:48] appreciate and thank god for his life
[11:50] as a member of his own tabernacle
[11:53] he
[11:54] was somebody that would clean around the
[11:56] church
[11:57] and serve in whatever capacity was it
[12:00] was a testimony around the believers and
[12:02] we are grateful
[12:04] to god
[12:05] to have encountered and to see jason
[12:08] um god bless us to have him pass his
[12:10] life
[12:11] you know and pass through it or we
[12:13] we're always grateful and thankful
[12:15] because we don't know
[12:17] what time what day
[12:19] uh you know that we will get a call
[12:22] and
[12:23] it shows us how humble how
[12:26] uh dependent we have to approach life
[12:30] even so much more than going forward
[12:33] you know and um
[12:35] so i would
[12:36] at this time i want to
[12:38] pass over to berligidion
[12:41] we'll take it from there and we'll
[12:42] continue on but gideon principle
[12:47] good evening friends
[12:50] i
[12:51] know it is
[12:52] such strange circumstances that has
[12:54] brought us together tonight
[12:57] but
[12:58] at the same time
[13:00] i think it allows us to really reflect
[13:04] on all that he represented
[13:08] and to really capture some of that and
[13:10] to share with us as a memorial
[13:13] on his behalf
[13:15] i'd like us to start off with a relative
[13:18] a dear friend none other than sister
[13:21] angela bechan to just share a few few
[13:24] words from my heart
[13:26] about her nephew jason
[13:32] good night each and everyone returns in
[13:34] the precious name of our lord and savior
[13:36] jesus christ
[13:39] for us as the family this has been
[13:42] a most
[13:44] unusual time and almost something that
[13:47] we had not really
[13:49] you know we would not be prepared for
[13:52] this
[13:53] it happened you know we were all for
[13:55] information and we were all you know so
[13:59] full of hope
[14:01] and you know we believed that he would
[14:04] have made it
[14:05] and that was what our cause will
[14:08] but suffice it to say
[14:10] you know god saw it best
[14:13] to take jason
[14:14] home and i was reading some of their
[14:17] comments today on facebook
[14:20] and you know sometimes when somebody
[14:22] dies
[14:24] sometimes it is so sad because you have
[14:26] to look
[14:27] for things to say you have to think you
[14:29] have to search your memory to think
[14:32] about you know good things to say sad
[14:34] does that mean but it is true
[14:37] but with json
[14:39] every single comment
[14:41] that was made about json
[14:44] it was the truth
[14:46] it was not fabricated
[14:48] it was not exaggerated
[14:50] it was the truth about jason
[14:53] my nephew jason was a very unique person
[14:57] and unique in all aspects
[15:00] from very early in his life but i would
[15:03] like to i would want to more emphasize
[15:06] on json spiritual life
[15:09] because from very early jason loved the
[15:13] lord there is no doubt about it
[15:16] from very young
[15:17] and every each and everyone who knew
[15:20] jason could attest to this
[15:22] you know he loved the lord
[15:25] and as much as he loved the lord
[15:28] jesus also embraced life to the fullest
[15:32] his love for the lord was also compared
[15:35] to his love for food
[15:37] his love for traveler his love for
[15:39] sports
[15:40] his love for spending time with his
[15:42] family
[15:44] all the nephews the cousins they would
[15:47] gravitate towards jason
[15:49] just from the time uncle jason came
[15:52] it was oh my god like it was like
[15:54] christmas was every day and even though
[15:56] jason at times would play christmas you
[15:59] know play santa claus for do any
[16:01] questions period but jason coming to
[16:04] anybody's home was like christmas
[16:06] anger
[16:08] it would be hugs and kisses and and he
[16:11] would say something to make everyone
[16:13] laugh and that was jesus
[16:15] you know his son misha oh my god that
[16:18] was his
[16:19] greatest pride and joy he loved that
[16:23] child and he was a role father
[16:25] for misha
[16:27] but as i said i want to talk more about
[16:29] jason's spiritual walk with the lord
[16:32] because he loved the lord all and i want
[16:35] to remember i don't want to stay too
[16:36] long tonight because i know there are
[16:38] many other people to speak but one of
[16:40] the things that stayed in my mind
[16:43] very much was i remember that in 2016
[16:47] jason went to one of the biggest trials
[16:49] in his life
[16:50] where the son that he had longed for
[16:54] he had a baby and he i think he and yes
[16:57] it was in 2016 that he um the baby came
[17:01] here he lived for a month and then he
[17:03] died and the day in question when it was
[17:06] the baby's funeral
[17:09] we were all by the grave and after
[17:12] they did the um you know the
[17:14] crystal was there and she was you know
[17:16] really really tearful and so forth and
[17:18] they put the baby down into the gong and
[17:21] they piled the earth on the grave
[17:24] and json
[17:26] felt
[17:27] he fell
[17:28] stressed flat
[17:30] on that dirt and all jason would say
[17:34] is hallelujah hallelujah and you could
[17:36] feel
[17:38] the pangs of agony
[17:40] in jason's voice but what stood out to
[17:43] me is that
[17:44] how he did not say
[17:46] lord why did you do it
[17:48] you know lord this is so unfair
[17:51] his cry was hallelujah hallelujah
[17:54] and how many you know times we go
[17:57] through things and and sometimes we we
[18:00] we question god and we you know and it
[18:02] takes a good bit of faith and courage
[18:05] to be able to go beyond that and still
[18:08] praise god and give him praises
[18:11] you know and this is one of the things
[18:12] that stood out you know with jason with
[18:15] me
[18:16] and there were many other things that
[18:18] that we would go anywhere you go and
[18:20] somebody wanted to us json would not
[18:23] hesitate as a young
[18:25] man he would not some people sometimes
[18:27] they are ashamed to pray or they would
[18:29] pray very softly and jason but you
[18:31] already had jason painted the top of his
[18:33] voice
[18:34] you know and without any
[18:36] any kind of you know feeling shame or
[18:38] reservations
[18:40] and these are the things that i know
[18:42] that that kept jason for all his life
[18:45] his faith his faith in god through the
[18:48] good times and the bad times she was
[18:49] always always faithful to god regardless
[18:52] of what and he had he got a few knocks
[18:55] in his life but again he stood on
[18:58] wavering as a young man
[19:00] and i know that god maybe at this time
[19:03] it was you know his time you know for
[19:05] him to be with the lord and we will miss
[19:08] him he will miss him because as i said
[19:11] he was a live wire of in our family
[19:14] jesus would go to the most serious
[19:16] person
[19:17] and he would hug them and they would be
[19:19] so shocked and they would just be taken
[19:21] aback but that was jason you expected
[19:24] jason to do the unexpected in his job he
[19:28] was an exemplary person as you would he
[19:30] see on facebook you know and there's so
[19:33] many other things that i could say about
[19:35] my nephew jason but i don't want to take
[19:38] take up too much time but we will miss
[19:41] him you know he has lived a life for us
[19:44] um and we have to learn from his his
[19:47] walk with god and we know that he is in
[19:49] god's arms and he is the only other side
[19:52] with his mom and his son that he lost
[19:55] and we know that one day we live in that
[19:58] hope we have that hope that we will all
[20:00] be together so even though it is a time
[20:04] for us to be you know it is a star time
[20:06] but in the spirit we know
[20:08] that you know to be
[20:10] to be absent in the body is to be
[20:13] present with the lord
[20:14] and um i we will celebrate jesus and
[20:17] life
[20:18] and i just want to say you know thank
[20:20] you everyone for all the support from
[20:22] brother ovid straight back to all the
[20:24] family the friends thank you so much for
[20:26] the support in love that we have been
[20:29] receiving and may god bless you all for
[20:32] all your love and support thank you and
[20:35] good night
[20:39] tremendous tremendous you really
[20:41] appreciate your kind words and we know
[20:42] it's nothing but the truth a true
[20:45] testimony of who he is and who he was
[20:48] and what he stood for
[20:51] at this time
[20:53] i
[20:54] am not sure they're here but we'd like
[20:57] to invite a representative from the
[21:00] office of the prime minister
[21:02] to share a few words
[21:04] as it relates to jason at this time i
[21:06] don't know if miss jack martin is with
[21:08] us
[21:28] okay if she comes in a little later we
[21:31] will
[21:32] revert to her
[21:34] but
[21:35] we'd like to to move on to invite
[21:38] brother mike blackman
[21:44] hi good night all those who
[21:46] are on the zoo tonight
[21:49] uh
[21:50] brothers and sisters from the church
[21:52] friends and well-wishers
[21:54] uh
[21:55] jason
[21:56] and the family
[21:58] let me first extend my condolences to
[22:01] the rajkumar family
[22:03] and i just want to give a short
[22:05] testimony of of my
[22:08] um interaction with jason
[22:11] jason i know jason you know
[22:13] through as a little boy
[22:15] coming to the church um with his mother
[22:17] sandra it's about the same age as my
[22:20] full son
[22:22] and um
[22:23] we
[22:24] he would have grown into a young man
[22:27] and
[22:28] during that time you know he would have
[22:29] connected more with my son than with
[22:31] myself however
[22:33] within the last
[22:35] year or so couple years really
[22:38] jason um applied to go into the customs
[22:42] and excise division
[22:43] where i had worked
[22:45] before i retired
[22:47] and he had approached me to get some
[22:49] sort of understanding of what the
[22:52] division was about and he had to sit an
[22:54] exam for entry
[22:56] so i had helped him with some papers you
[22:58] know some people put together a little
[23:01] juicier for him
[23:02] and that is how we started to speak with
[23:05] each other and communicate a little
[23:07] closer than we were in church you know
[23:09] just brother mike and brother jason
[23:12] um during that time i got to really
[23:15] know some of the you know thoughts that
[23:18] he
[23:19] because you know he would tell me about
[23:21] his plans you know first weekend his
[23:22] main thing was to get into customs
[23:25] as a career pathway so you know he would
[23:27] be asking me about different things and
[23:29] telling me about different things that
[23:31] they do
[23:32] but um i think we'll be really connected
[23:35] strange is that you know a couple months
[23:37] ago
[23:38] jason and i
[23:40] spoke about getting fit because you know
[23:42] i was telling them that you know if
[23:43] you're gonna go into customs there's a
[23:45] law enforcement um you know you need to
[23:47] be fit
[23:48] and jason and i would have arranged to
[23:51] go up to chan lady chance on the hills
[23:53] and we did a couple we did a circuit
[23:55] and it was during that time that you
[23:57] know with him talking to me
[23:59] about his plans for his future
[24:03] that i i got to really appreciate
[24:06] you know who this young man was
[24:08] um i can say some of the things that he
[24:10] shared with me one of them is he spoke
[24:12] about his wife crystal
[24:15] he spoke about him thinking that he
[24:17] would have to live as a bachelor for the
[24:19] rest of his life because
[24:21] no one had come into his life there was
[24:23] no one he had seen that
[24:24] made him feel
[24:26] um how crystal made him feel then he
[24:28] talked about crystal coming into his
[24:30] life how much he meant to him
[24:32] and also his his young son
[24:35] so it was indeed a tremendous feeling of
[24:37] grief and loss when
[24:39] i felt that jason was plucked away
[24:41] before he could realize some of his his
[24:44] his great ambitions and dreams
[24:46] one was the entire customs and excited
[24:48] vision the other one is that then he had
[24:50] started his house
[24:52] and he
[24:53] um had a lot of plans about you know how
[24:55] the family would grow and store
[24:58] um jason was exemplary
[25:02] because in in the midst of everything
[25:05] jason had
[25:06] one central
[25:08] thing that he spoke to me about and that
[25:10] was his love for his family and being
[25:13] you know a provider a shelter a
[25:16] protector for them and you know
[25:18] god put man
[25:19] on the earth as as as a leader of a
[25:22] family
[25:24] and jason exemplified all the things
[25:26] that
[25:27] a leader a father should be
[25:30] in a family
[25:32] jason was someone who you know he would
[25:35] come to me and say brother mikey i ring
[25:38] them and ring a ring service commission
[25:39] said they might let them sleep on a
[25:41] thing or not making sure that you know
[25:43] they are on top of my case that was the
[25:45] kind of person he was jason was a
[25:47] go-getter you know he always had some
[25:49] little thing going on i decided to make
[25:51] some extra money and stuff like that
[25:54] and one of the things that i admired
[25:56] about jason was is always that bubbly
[25:58] personality you really know how jason
[26:00] was in church jason will be at the front
[26:03] worshiping and praising god
[26:05] and um
[26:07] the last time i spoke with him we were
[26:09] in the in the mail
[26:11] washroom bathroom
[26:13] and jason was part of the cleaning team
[26:15] daddy and i was just sharing with him
[26:18] you know the he was asking me about some
[26:20] of the cleaning stuff he hadn't seen so
[26:21] i was just sharing with him you know
[26:22] what he uses what but the point is jason
[26:25] was always helpful
[26:27] he was always a
[26:28] a loving person with a nice aura of you
[26:31] know kindness and gentleness
[26:34] and always looking to give
[26:36] a way to somebody
[26:38] to bring a lovely atmosphere and a
[26:41] lovely spirit into the interaction with
[26:44] althouse
[26:45] what i want to say tonight is
[26:47] jason has left
[26:48] some footprints on the sounds of time
[26:52] and he has left some footprints that i
[26:54] think any young person would do well to
[26:56] follow
[26:57] for those of us who are grieving
[27:00] i want us to remember one thing today i
[27:02] saw a picture of jason resplendent in a
[27:04] white suit on a bench
[27:06] and as i looked at it i just got a
[27:09] feeling that this is jason sitting in
[27:10] heaven right now
[27:12] you know in a lovely white suit
[27:14] resplendent in white i mean immaculate i
[27:17] think it's white
[27:18] i'm a living with colors but i mean he
[27:21] looked like an angel sitting on a bench
[27:23] in that suit
[27:24] just to remember that
[27:27] sometimes we grieve and i remember there
[27:30] was one incident where that great
[27:32] prophet called his wife back
[27:34] and she said why did you call me back
[27:36] you preached about it you talked about
[27:38] it but you would never you would never
[27:40] know what it's like until you get there
[27:42] you know so
[27:44] we grieve but you know what jesus jesus
[27:46] is sitting on that bench with that smile
[27:48] on his face
[27:49] i'm saying his favorite words
[27:51] everything nice in jesus name and that
[27:54] is what i want us to remember jason's
[27:57] always positive faith and the fact that
[28:01] in spite of whatever challenges whatever
[28:03] conditions face him
[28:05] his cry was everything nice in jesus
[28:08] name
[28:10] i'm wishing the family
[28:12] all god's comfort from the great
[28:14] comforter and that crystal and all the
[28:16] other members of the family would gather
[28:19] wrong
[28:20] and give priscilla the support and the
[28:22] strength to to raise little measure and
[28:25] the way he should be
[28:26] um you know there's something we seen
[28:29] animal kingdom with elephants if there's
[28:31] a wounded elephant
[28:34] um when a fund that is is weak
[28:37] all the other elephants get together and
[28:39] they surround that elephant and they
[28:40] prop it because once that elephant goes
[28:42] down it's very hard for it to get back
[28:44] up so they prop that elephant to make
[28:46] sure that it doesn't go down at all and
[28:49] they will lean on that lean with that
[28:51] elephant and prop it until that elephant
[28:53] can support itself and i think that's
[28:55] what we need to do prayerfully right now
[28:58] for sister crystal and the rest of the
[29:00] family we need to be together wrong as a
[29:03] family and give them all the support all
[29:06] the props that are necessary to make
[29:08] sure
[29:08] that they can survive this period and
[29:10] come out at the end of it stronger
[29:13] better
[29:14] and walking in the path with the json
[29:17] when i wanted so to all those who are
[29:20] on the zoom tonight i say god bless you
[29:23] let us remember jason jason's crying all
[29:27] the time everything nice in jesus name
[29:29] and he didn't just make out a talk he
[29:32] walked the talk he didn't just talk he
[29:34] walked that talk
[29:35] so i think he has left a great
[29:38] um
[29:40] story behind in terms of his life
[29:43] let's all learn from it as we continue
[29:45] to walk on the pathway to that great
[29:48] place where we will meet him once again
[29:50] god bless you
[29:51] thank you
[29:55] thank you very very much for the
[29:57] blackman what timely words i think
[30:00] it really speaks and you can see a
[30:02] consistent theme
[30:04] no matter what perspective it comes from
[30:06] he was truly an
[30:08] exemplary person
[30:10] if i could add one little thing i would
[30:12] say jason is one of the most passionate
[30:15] people i know and he's for real
[30:18] she doesn't have no hangups at all
[30:21] if
[30:22] this is black italian black if you don't
[30:25] like it you tell you don't like it if
[30:27] you love it he tell it he loves it
[30:29] and
[30:30] as i said that i could could remember if
[30:32] i were to identify four things that he
[30:36] was
[30:37] overzealous and passionate and really in
[30:40] love with
[30:41] it was one
[30:43] god
[30:44] he really really really loved the lord
[30:47] two
[30:48] you see his family
[30:50] you couldn't get between jason and
[30:53] family
[30:54] he spoke of would work hard would do
[30:57] everything all his ambitions was driven
[30:59] to his wife and son
[31:02] always spoke about them the next thing
[31:05] he was super passionate about
[31:07] if you know him you'll know he's
[31:08] passionate about food
[31:10] jason love good food
[31:12] love to eat it didn't matter
[31:15] how much food what kind of food once
[31:17] there was food he said coming
[31:20] and lastly
[31:22] he might look so but he loves sports
[31:25] especially basketball
[31:27] jason was a sport man in his hat he
[31:30] really really you could talk that he
[31:32] could walk and and he could play it as
[31:34] well
[31:35] with that said
[31:36] i want us to just pause a little bit
[31:39] and
[31:40] ask that the technical guys in the
[31:43] background would share the screen
[31:45] and we take in a video clip
[31:48] of jason at this point

[36:53] [Music]
[37:03] [Music]
[37:22] [Music]
[37:31] all along the way
[37:43] you know it's clear that as that clip
[37:46] was played jason was a worshipper
[37:50] jason
[37:52] may not have been the best singer but
[37:54] you see when it comes to worship he
[37:56] would make a joyful noise as you see
[37:59] morning time
[38:00] noon night time he say go and plant peas
[38:04] probably going to work some now on the
[38:06] whole crystal making out but you know
[38:08] what i could also recall
[38:11] when the
[38:12] within the early days of the pandemic
[38:13] itself which would have been last year
[38:15] probably march april also we would have
[38:18] bible study and praying for me
[38:21] so via zoo
[38:23] and jason
[38:24] i know his aunt described him as a
[38:26] unique person
[38:27] but one of the unique things he used to
[38:29] do and i'm sure a lot of us might recall
[38:32] is that he would be on this zoom
[38:36] wherever he was
[38:37] if he was at work
[38:39] he on the zoom prayer meeting at work or
[38:41] bible study at work if he on the road
[38:45] zoom on the road
[38:47] when he arrived home
[38:49] zoom at home
[38:51] he was one of the more consistent
[38:54] persons
[38:55] that i could identify
[38:58] really really really a true worshiper
[39:01] you know a lot of these clips shared
[39:04] would have been shared with with a
[39:06] brother's group we had on whatsapp
[39:08] and it's interesting to know that it
[39:10] wasn't mandatory to share anything like
[39:12] this but many a sunday morning
[39:15] when you think getting ready to the
[39:17] church also
[39:19] jason would i assume he would be making
[39:22] eclipse at that time
[39:24] so sunday morning before church he
[39:26] wasn't waiting until he got to church
[39:27] and when he got to church he on fire
[39:29] already singing like this
[39:31] worshipping like this at home and it was
[39:33] a true testimony to us
[39:35] of the life he lived and what he stood
[39:39] and identified you know as brothers and
[39:44] and as friends and and family members
[39:46] and so i know a lot of us have so many
[39:49] things to say at this point i want to
[39:51] invite
[39:52] a friend of his brother andy henry to
[39:55] share with us a little bit in terms of
[39:57] his experience his relationship um
[40:01] as i invite brother andy henry
[40:03] to share share with us with us sorry
[40:08] goodnight brothers and sisters friends
[40:10] family members
[40:13] uh work colleagues
[40:17] um tonight is
[40:20] is somewhat bittersweet because
[40:24] we
[40:25] no longer have a uh
[40:27] a gem of our brother with us
[40:30] but
[40:31] at the same time tonight we could
[40:32] reflect
[40:34] on
[40:36] the life that he lived what he stood for
[40:39] and
[40:41] also
[40:43] the memories that
[40:45] we would have made
[40:47] together
[40:49] yeah so tonight i just want to touch on
[40:51] a few things
[40:52] that
[40:55] um
[40:57] that i
[41:00] remembered about jason
[41:02] first and foremost just as everybody
[41:04] said
[41:05] jason love the lord
[41:07] as could be seen by the way that you
[41:09] worship you see the video clips that we
[41:12] saw just now is not
[41:14] um
[41:15] [Music]
[41:16] is nothing different
[41:18] to what would have happened in church
[41:23] as brother also said he was one of the
[41:27] the loudest voices he would have heard
[41:28] in church
[41:30] many a time he would run up to the front
[41:33] and you know
[41:36] chair on on the wood and you do
[41:40] the brother i was preaching and all
[41:41] those things because he was excited
[41:44] about
[41:46] the things of god about god he was
[41:49] excited he was passionate about it and
[41:51] that is
[41:52] one thing that is very
[41:55] very uh
[41:58] how to say memorable about him
[42:01] that's something we always remember
[42:02] jason for if nothing else that's
[42:05] something always remember him for
[42:07] another thing is that jason was
[42:10] an um
[42:12] personal experience with him he is
[42:15] always willing to help anybody that he
[42:18] could
[42:19] there was a time that i had a uh
[42:21] a little court matter
[42:23] thing so i know just not one point that
[42:25] i used to work in the judiciary
[42:27] so call him up and say jason so so is
[42:30] the case boy
[42:31] where i could help middle because i
[42:33] forgot the court date i'm all kind of
[42:35] drama
[42:36] you say yeah man don't worry yourself i
[42:38] don't have a partner working there i'll
[42:40] just call them up and think i will
[42:42] find all that no problem
[42:45] so i said all right cool
[42:47] so it so happened that someday i was
[42:49] heading in that direction
[42:51] so i called him i said hey jason think
[42:54] thing thing
[42:55] give me the fella number call
[43:06] so we went on the road and we fell out
[43:08] shipping down the road and
[43:10] it ended up taking longer than ex
[43:12] expected
[43:13] so when you're coming back up now back
[43:15] into porter spain i say bye jason bye
[43:17] sorry to keep you so long like you say
[43:19] nah man nice small thing i'll just take
[43:22] a two hours launch then i think they're
[43:23] gonna understand
[43:28] you know yeah and it was no big deal for
[43:31] him you know he
[43:32] he was just cool and normal
[43:35] and i mean always willing to help
[43:38] however he could he he jason was someone
[43:42] that
[43:43] um
[43:46] is very passionate was very passionate
[43:47] about his family he loved his family his
[43:50] son his wife and he always
[43:54] uh
[43:56] work hard to provide for them
[44:00] and all these all these things you know
[44:01] which was very
[44:03] very um
[44:05] commemorable about him because
[44:08] is just
[44:10] as as if it was
[44:13] how
[44:14] can he find a right word right now but
[44:16] he had such a driver and such a passion
[44:19] for his family that as um bro blackman
[44:22] really said
[44:23] no oh oh
[44:25] somebody nothing could come in between
[44:27] him and his family
[44:29] you know you couldn't get in there at
[44:30] all at all because
[44:33] family was important to him and he made
[44:35] it a priority
[44:37] you know his family made his family a
[44:39] priority another thing to his jason just
[44:42] as everybody would
[44:44] you know is is so
[44:47] it's like everyone has these almost the
[44:50] same things to say about jesus because
[44:52] jason was
[44:54] the same way wherever he was
[44:57] jesus was a life at the party wherever
[44:59] he is i remember the first time we had
[45:01] um
[45:02] uh a brother's lime first one was at my
[45:05] home
[45:06] so
[45:08] him and joelle

[45:12] time
[45:14] so i said let me go inside and we go
[45:16] wait for them followers on them he said
[45:18] now
[45:19] we've done good out here sitting in the
[45:21] yard
[45:22] we cutting coconut are we drinking and
[45:24] you know jason was normal he made
[45:27] himself comfortable
[45:28] you know no no no no no kind of hustle
[45:32] or nobody and even self indy
[45:35] while everybody was there we was
[45:37] uh fellowshipping and all these things
[45:41] jason was always
[45:44] the life for the party is it was like it
[45:46] was like a a competition between him and
[45:48] and another brother it's like who could
[45:51] um
[45:52] you know make the most jokes and it was
[45:55] it was amazing
[45:56] you know and that was something that i
[45:59] would always remember even jason

[48:17] he could you know and even um
[48:21] he
[48:22] he um
[48:24] we had a youth service sometime a couple
[48:27] years ago
[48:28] in the tabernacle
[48:30] and but isaac was talking about
[48:34] praying and
[48:36] that sort of thing how you shouldn't be
[48:37] ashamed to pray
[48:40] and and and pretend you're on the phone
[48:43] and you're praying and that kind of so
[48:44] nobody wouldn't know
[48:46] so
[48:47] after isaac said that jason put up his
[48:49] hand he said well
[48:52] uh let me tell you something
[48:54] i just do that tonight when i walk and
[48:56] down from
[48:57] from portland spain going down the city
[48:59] gate i just pull out my phone
[49:01] and pretend like i talking on the phone
[49:03] by really praying you know and it was
[49:06] such a uproar and laughter
[49:08] in the in the youth service because
[49:11] you wouldn't really expect you synthesis
[49:13] nobody to say something like that and
[49:14] then jason just opened you know so i
[49:17] mean
[49:19] it was it was something
[49:21] he was always no matter the
[49:24] the
[49:25] forum he was always there he always
[49:28] you know bring in
[49:31] light
[49:32] or or or make any place light somehow it
[49:35] will in in the way that he would have
[49:38] you know interacted with everybody and
[49:40] that kind of thing
[49:42] so um
[49:43] i don't want to be too long i just i
[49:45] just want to extend my condolences to
[49:48] the family to his wife
[49:49] his son misha
[49:51] and
[49:52] pray that god will give you guys the
[49:55] strength
[49:56] and the the courage to go through this
[49:58] time it definitely will be missed
[50:01] uh not only in his family but also
[50:05] in his workplace the places he used to
[50:07] work in it is
[50:09] in church on all these things as well
[50:11] too
[50:12] but
[50:14] taking all things into consideration
[50:18] god knows best
[50:20] god knows what what is best so we just
[50:23] have to thank god
[50:25] that we were able to
[50:27] know him
[50:28] and to be part of of his life
[50:31] on this so god bless you all
[50:35] and have a good night this is my
[50:36] contribution tonight
[50:39] thank you very very much andy
[50:42] thanks for
[50:44] sharing again you know it it reminded me
[50:46] as he spoke that a few words that come
[50:49] to mind when you think of jason
[50:51] is ambitious
[50:53] jason was industrious hard working jesus
[50:56] was working all the time
[50:58] if you talk to jesus in in his short
[51:01] life
[51:02] he tells him that he might docks
[51:04] he pulled bull or with taxi he would
[51:07] just look magician caught with officer
[51:09] the pm he always was no matter what time
[51:12] you call him he always had something to
[51:14] do he heard him any worship say he won
[51:16] plant pancakes he always had a plan to
[51:19] do something
[51:21] but at the same time he was also a
[51:24] comedian
[51:25] this was natural innate he could have
[51:28] gone to hollywood and made millions in
[51:30] comedy because it was natural to him
[51:34] but he chose to direct the energy
[51:36] to christ and to church and to worship

[58:42] been the last conversation with my
[58:44] precious brother

[58:48] showing the sentiments of all was on the
[58:50] call one before but by the batman
[58:53] and the different ones

[58:59] um
[59:00] you know he was very very happy
[59:03] happy jolly person
[59:05] and he always had that smile that you
[59:07] know that lit up the room lit up the
[59:09] whole atmosphere and change the
[59:10] atmosphere you can be feeling down and
[59:12] out
[59:13] and you know when you're talking to
[59:15] jason
[59:16] you know he he will he will change the
[59:18] whole mood
[59:19] you know he had that gift that where you

[1:03:03] met in my entire life
[1:03:05] everything everyone has said about jason
[1:03:07] so far is so true but
[1:03:10] it's like
[1:03:11] he's one of the few persons who were the
[1:03:13] same way with everybody but he wasn't
[1:03:16] changing it up for somebody else when he
[1:03:18] on work he act differently when he whom
[1:03:20] he died differently when he reached the
[1:03:22] church friends he act differently when
[1:03:23] he it was like that he was the same way
[1:03:26] right through he was so genuine
[1:03:28] and um
[1:03:30] over the past few years i just listened
[1:03:32] to some of these stories there that you
[1:03:34] know brother andy shared and gideon and
[1:03:37] jason and a few others and so on and
[1:03:38] then
[1:03:39] over the past few years i had the
[1:03:40] opportunity to to really get a lot

[1:05:05] soon as he come
[1:05:07] fire one time
[1:05:08] you might never have to walk up
[1:05:10] one time it's just like joel said
[1:05:12] earlier

[1:07:59] i say a little experience but
[1:08:01] i say well nobody called me nobody
[1:08:04] checked me he was there
[1:08:06] but that meant
[1:08:09] you know
[1:08:10] and he didn't come to you know talk
[1:08:11] about what you know i can't oh you know
[1:08:13] why you don't think that he just just
[1:08:15] came from fellowship just
[1:08:17] i've just been around him
[1:08:19] yeah
[1:08:20] there's no way you can be dogging out
[1:08:22] once you're wrong jason like his
[1:08:25] spirit his personality was so huge it
[1:08:27] was so large it was so
[1:08:29] powerful it was so radiant it was like a
[1:08:32] light a shining star in the midst of
[1:08:35] this dark but he stood out he stood out
[1:08:38] from the rest head and shoulders above
[1:08:40] everybody else
[1:08:42] he was truly a beautiful man and
[1:08:46] i and you know it hurts it hurt me a
[1:08:50] lot you know when i heard because
[1:08:54] you know i have this thing i just do
[1:08:55] know when i put something before the
[1:08:57] lord i just accept it i believe it and i
[1:08:59] move forward and i you know i just i
[1:09:01] just knew because
[1:09:02] i said jesus i said you told me in your
[1:09:05] word
[1:09:06] that if you asked for anything in my
[1:09:09] name you would do it
[1:09:11] you know but
[1:09:14] when i read the news i was
[1:09:16] i was heartbroken
[1:09:19] but then you know something came to me
[1:09:21] and said you know
[1:09:22] that god god is suffering
[1:09:25] god is suffering and uh
[1:09:27] we don't always understand it
[1:09:30] it doesn't mean that you know because
[1:09:31] you know we trust in him and we know
[1:09:33] that you know and he have a plan that it
[1:09:36] doesn't hurt
[1:09:38] it doesn't mean an adulthood
[1:09:40] but it does
[1:09:42] but um
[1:09:43] god is suffering and you know
[1:09:46] his will be done
[1:09:48] but if there's one thing
[1:09:50] given here that we had among the
[1:09:52] believers
[1:09:53] [Music]
[1:09:54] i turned to my wife and i said i said um
[1:09:57] i told her i said hey look i said i said
[1:09:59] god can take jesus
[1:10:01] i said that means he taking his best
[1:10:03] people off the job and
[1:10:05] i said when you're taking your best
[1:10:06] people of your job is that your wine and
[1:10:08] normally work or your finishing work
[1:10:11] i say that's what we're doing right now
[1:10:13] so you know
[1:10:15] that really shook me up to the point
[1:10:17] where
[1:10:18] i realized that i i know to jesus life
[1:10:21] was such a testimony
[1:10:23] but i am
[1:10:25] a person saying about how he worship his
[1:10:27] life was a worship his entire life was
[1:10:29] worshipped you know it wasn't like
[1:10:31] that's what i thought he wasn't changed
[1:10:32] he told me and i'm glad i'm glad to show
[1:10:34] the videos he told me he said stephen
[1:10:36] when i
[1:10:37] he said when i'm doing my thing i'd be
[1:10:39] shocked and think just like always in
[1:10:41] church
[1:10:42] he told me that long before and he
[1:10:43] started selling videos he said i didn't
[1:10:45] do nothing
[1:10:46] normal he said sometimes they don't like
[1:10:48] guitar but
[1:10:49] you know
[1:10:52] i just i i just
[1:10:56] speaks to the you know the character
[1:10:57] that he had
[1:10:59] and he
[1:11:00] and you know above it all as an amazing
[1:11:02] christian and person that he was he was
[1:11:04] still human
[1:11:06] you know we had many conversation of all
[1:11:08] a lot of mistakes and things he would
[1:11:09] have made in the past so you always make
[1:11:11] you feel like it was human just like
[1:11:13] christ even though christ was
[1:11:15] you know
[1:11:17] what and so on he was human but anyone
[1:11:20] jason jason felt that same way even
[1:11:22] though he was such an example to the
[1:11:24] young people and you know to me in
[1:11:27] particular and so on he was human but he
[1:11:29] was he wasn't a perfect man you know he
[1:11:32] made mistakes and things like that it
[1:11:33] was one thing i admired about him and i
[1:11:35] this is something that i definitely
[1:11:36] applied to my life he never let his
[1:11:38] mistakes pull him down sometimes we make
[1:11:40] mistakes and we pull onto that for years
[1:11:42] and oh lord are you feeling so guilty
[1:11:45] and we keep ashamed to go before the
[1:11:47] lord i think that was not jesus he never
[1:11:50] let his mistakes you know and and and so
[1:11:53] on held him back you know he was
[1:11:56] he was true to form he was a genuine
[1:11:58] he was a genuine christian
[1:12:00] and i i
[1:12:02] as much as i will miss him i know i i
[1:12:04] it's impossible for me to miss him as
[1:12:07] more modern
[1:12:08] his wife crystal and his son shark
[1:12:11] and so on so i and his anderson and his
[1:12:13] entire family so i just wanna just i
[1:12:15] could spend the rest of my life speaking
[1:12:17] about all the things
[1:12:18] you know that jason and i would have um
[1:12:20] discussed and you know all the plans i i
[1:12:22] was also i had my background speaking
[1:12:24] about it all the plans that he had when
[1:12:26] he you know applied to be part of the
[1:12:29] uh
[1:12:29] whether it was customs and
[1:12:31] build another one so much so many things
[1:12:34] you know and
[1:12:35] i heard one of you i wanted the
[1:12:36] president mentioned that oh he was such
[1:12:38] a supportive guy when i was selling
[1:12:40] insurance i came to jesus
[1:12:42] and jason bought insurance to me you
[1:12:44] know what he told me
[1:12:45] he says stephen shawn's already you know
[1:12:48] him i don't need
[1:12:49] but he said just because it's you i
[1:12:51] would buy
[1:12:52] i didn't buy once again
[1:12:54] he buy twice he didn't buy twice or no
[1:12:57] he bought three times
[1:12:59] just because it was me
[1:13:01] that's the kind of friend he was
[1:13:03] you know he just wanted to show support
[1:13:04] anything you're doing you just support
[1:13:07] and
[1:13:09] i mean i i
[1:13:11] i think a lot of stuff that i that i can
[1:13:14] speak about will kind of fall into line
[1:13:15] with what everyone else has said
[1:13:17] but i just want to encourage everyone
[1:13:19] not to um
[1:13:20] you know to to able to continue to show
[1:13:22] the family love and support
[1:13:24] you know
[1:13:25] not not just throughout this time but
[1:13:26] even beyond so many times we gotta we
[1:13:28] got other situations like this and after
[1:13:31] it's said and done we all disperse you
[1:13:33] know into different areas of our life
[1:13:34] but let us continue as a family as a
[1:13:36] community to show love and support
[1:13:39] you know to crystal and to me shack
[1:13:41] and to the entire family as much as we
[1:13:43] can let us not forget let's not forget
[1:13:45] them you know because

[1:16:23] tonight will have been impacted by
[1:16:25] jason's presence
[1:16:27] if one is to give a true and honest
[1:16:30] description of jason it will be that he
[1:16:32] was a friendly warm delightful person to
[1:16:35] be around he had the type of personality
[1:16:38] that drew you to him one would not be
[1:16:41] angry with him for long he had the gift
[1:16:43] of chair and of charm
[1:16:46] he was indeed a charismatic person
[1:16:49] jason's journey with us began when he
[1:16:51] was appointed as an auditing assistant
[1:16:54] in the internal audit department in
[1:16:57] 2017.
[1:16:58] from the internal audit division his
[1:17:00] career catapulted to the administrative
[1:17:03] officer too in the general
[1:17:05] administration department in august
[1:17:07] 2018. then in february 2020 he was
[1:17:10] transferred to the general fleet
[1:17:12] division
[1:17:13] working with mr rajkumar was indeed
[1:17:16] a delight one of his major tasks in the
[1:17:19] division was to procure items such as
[1:17:22] school items for the government shelters
[1:17:24] basically to ensure that the needs of
[1:17:26] the shelters are met
[1:17:28] once he receives information a shelter
[1:17:30] needs a particular item mr rajkumar
[1:17:33] would ensure that the item is received
[1:17:36] it may not be immediately but they would
[1:17:38] get the items in cressi he always uses
[1:17:41] his charisma to get out of situations
[1:17:43] that causes your throne to turn to a
[1:17:46] smile
[1:17:48] he loved this job
[1:17:49] he would often call me if you see that i
[1:17:52] am not at my desk
[1:17:53] miss john martin i see you not here are
[1:17:56] you coming in today i have ps to sign
[1:17:58] for the shelter but if you are not
[1:18:00] coming in i could always leave it for
[1:18:02] tomorrow or i could bring it up by you
[1:18:05] to suck and let you sign it and i live
[1:18:07] in trinity and he didn't mind coming all
[1:18:09] the way from puerto ricity to bring
[1:18:11] those people for me to sign certain
[1:18:12] shelter needs could be met
[1:18:14] he said this is not a problem he always
[1:18:16] came up with a solution nothing was so
[1:18:18] difficult for jason
[1:18:20] he was helpful and often goes beyond the
[1:18:22] call of duty to assist
[1:18:25] we are all saddened by his by this lord
[1:18:28] and we share in your grief
[1:18:30] this news was a blow to me as it was for
[1:18:33] everyone in our midst jason would be
[1:18:35] remembered for who he was a caring
[1:18:38] loving cheerful individuals who touch
[1:18:41] the hearts of everyone with his charisma
[1:18:43] sleep on my colleague until we meet
[1:18:45] again thank you
[1:18:50] thank you very much
[1:18:52] it's chuck
[1:18:54] jack martin a representative from the
[1:18:55] office of the prime minister and it's
[1:18:57] very very clear the impact and profound
[1:19:00] impact he had on different divisions
[1:19:02] within the ministry itself
[1:19:05] at this point we want to invite
[1:19:07] brother isaac ovid
[1:19:13] to share with us this time
[1:19:16] god bless you and
[1:19:17] good evening to one and all
[1:19:21] i would like to take this time um to
[1:19:24] express condolences deep condolences to
[1:19:26] the family
[1:19:28] and um
[1:19:29] so the many people who are here friends
[1:19:31] family well-wishers
[1:19:33] um
[1:19:36] jason
[1:19:38] for my almost my entire life i can see
[1:19:40] i've known jason like many who have
[1:19:42] already spoken we are about this image
[1:19:46] and we also had a very unique
[1:19:48] relationship i
[1:19:49] want to thank everyone who already spoke
[1:19:51] and i want to take a note from brother
[1:19:53] stephen kangary who
[1:19:54] just spoke that it's not his way of
[1:19:56] making you
[1:19:58] one as an individual feel like you have
[1:20:00] that relationship with him you know so
[1:20:03] everyone could say he had a unique
[1:20:04] relationship with him you know
[1:20:06] um he was both a brother to me and a
[1:20:08] friend
[1:20:09] and in my portfolio at church
[1:20:12] i had the opportunity to serve him and
[1:20:15] to
[1:20:16] preach to him for many years you know
[1:20:18] and i could share something that
[1:20:20] truly that nobody would know because we
[1:20:23] see jason in his public
[1:20:25] you know display of worship and what you
[1:20:28] would see when he's you know shouts and
[1:20:29] screams in church
[1:20:31] but i could remember many times you know
[1:20:34] and particularly during the pandemic
[1:20:36] when we had to speak
[1:20:38] um virtually
[1:20:40] i would come off the pulpit
[1:20:42] and i would have a range of whatsapp
[1:20:44] messages that would have been taken
[1:20:46] place sometimes unbeknownst to me while
[1:20:48] these services going on
[1:20:50] so jason from our home would be
[1:20:53] whatsapping my phone while i'm preaching
[1:20:56] shouting amen
[1:20:58] and there was a particular time i had my
[1:21:00] phone on the pulpit
[1:21:02] and i was like i'm getting ready to
[1:21:03] close out and a whatsapp comes through
[1:21:05] don't close out and um um it's it's
[1:21:08] something else and that's that's how
[1:21:09] jason was so that part for me is truly
[1:21:12] unique
[1:21:13] and that jason truly felt you know
[1:21:15] that you know he could reach out and
[1:21:17] kind of communicate that in the in in
[1:21:19] this way you know so
[1:21:20] just for a few minutes just to share
[1:21:22] something
[1:21:23] um to kind of close
[1:21:25] uh this night out i just want to read
[1:21:26] one scripture
[1:21:28] and just speak for about five minutes or
[1:21:30] so and i want to take it from luke 4
[1:21:31] verse 18
[1:21:34] the bible says the spirit of the lord is
[1:21:36] upon me and this was jesus speaking
[1:21:37] because he had anointed me to preach the
[1:21:40] gospel to the poor
[1:21:41] he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:21:44] to preach deliverance to the captives
[1:21:47] and recovering of sight to the blind to
[1:21:50] set at liberty them that are bruised to
[1:21:53] preach the acceptable year of the lord
[1:21:54] may the lord have a blessing to the
[1:21:56] reading of his word
[1:21:58] and we'll pray after this for the family
[1:22:01] and i read this scripture because this
[1:22:03] was the
[1:22:05] opening declaration of jesus's ministry
[1:22:08] of his purpose of his objectives
[1:22:10] he would start off this way but at the
[1:22:12] end of jesus ministry he would begin to
[1:22:15] speak about him being the resurrection
[1:22:17] and the life
[1:22:19] but this introduction of jesus's
[1:22:21] ministry
[1:22:22] says because he had anointed me to
[1:22:24] preach the gospel and it was the gospel
[1:22:27] that connected to jason
[1:22:29] he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:22:31] and no doubt
[1:22:33] for many of us
[1:22:35] there is a level of brokenheartedness
[1:22:38] is a level of
[1:22:40] sadness and grief
[1:22:42] but as the bible said we sorrow not like
[1:22:44] they who have no hope
[1:22:45] because we have a hope
[1:22:48] to say that his passing was a shock to
[1:22:50] me would be an understatement
[1:22:53] to me it was completely unexpected i
[1:22:55] know jason he had many many plans it has
[1:22:58] been said
[1:22:59] many times tonight in this meeting
[1:23:01] he had many plans but god had another
[1:23:03] plan
[1:23:05] a master plan
[1:23:06] and this master plan not only involved
[1:23:09] jason but
[1:23:10] somehow it seems to have involved all of
[1:23:12] us
[1:23:13] because none of us knew we would be here
[1:23:15] tonight
[1:23:16] none of us planned to be here tonight
[1:23:18] none of us expected
[1:23:20] to be here tonight
[1:23:22] the life that jason lived the testimony
[1:23:24] of his life
[1:23:25] and the fact that we are all here
[1:23:27] tonight
[1:23:28] is by divine design
[1:23:31] speaking at any celebration of the life
[1:23:34] of someone is always challenging
[1:23:37] it is even more challenging when it is
[1:23:39] someone close to you
[1:23:41] and someone you actually connected with
[1:23:44] he will be greatly greatly missed
[1:23:47] but i'm comforted tonight that i will
[1:23:49] see my friend again
[1:23:51] i am comforted because i know what he
[1:23:54] believed
[1:23:55] i know what he stood for and i know what
[1:23:58] he desired
[1:23:59] i am comforted in the faith he had
[1:24:02] his love for the lord and his passion to
[1:24:05] worship god
[1:24:06] his was the kind of worship that came
[1:24:09] with a genuine understanding and
[1:24:10] revelation
[1:24:12] of worship
[1:24:14] often times i've taught the distinction
[1:24:16] between praise and worship
[1:24:19] when you read through the bible praise
[1:24:21] him for his mighty acts praise him for
[1:24:24] and you can read all the scriptures that
[1:24:26] speak about praise but worship
[1:24:28] is different worship has nothing to do
[1:24:30] with us worship has to do with who god
[1:24:33] is
[1:24:34] he is worthy of worship no matter what
[1:24:36] our current situation is he is worthy of
[1:24:38] worship no matter how we feel and that
[1:24:40] is what connected to jesus
[1:24:43] i cannot personally remember a service
[1:24:46] that jason was in that he was not
[1:24:48] shouting at the top of his lungs
[1:24:51] often time after service
[1:24:53] jason's voice is hoarse because he has
[1:24:55] given his all
[1:24:57] and giving his all was consistent with
[1:24:59] everything that he did
[1:25:01] and it has been mentioned and i want to
[1:25:03] reinforce it it is not that jason didn't
[1:25:05] have ups and downs he did we all do
[1:25:07] but he never ever let the challenges and
[1:25:11] issues of life
[1:25:12] separate him from his worship
[1:25:15] nothing
[1:25:16] could separate jason from his worship
[1:25:19] he could have the worst day
[1:25:21] and when we had when we were able to
[1:25:23] come on a wednesday night he would come
[1:25:25] to church and he would worship
[1:25:28] he would say isaac things are rough with
[1:25:30] me you know but he is worshiping
[1:25:33] when i first met crystal who would
[1:25:35] become his wife i marveled
[1:25:38] because i told myself it takes a special
[1:25:40] kind of woman to deal with a man with
[1:25:42] that kind of wishes
[1:25:44] i saw crystalline church one time and
[1:25:46] there's jason and you know there are
[1:25:47] times when there's one person standing
[1:25:49] in church shouting and
[1:25:51] this time it was just jason yeah at that
[1:25:53] particular point he was screaming at the
[1:25:55] top of his lungs
[1:25:57] and crystal was there
[1:25:59] as if this is just normal and i'm like
[1:26:01] my
[1:26:04] but it was it was not a show it was not
[1:26:06] our performance it was not him doing it
[1:26:09] to impress nobody or to come across in
[1:26:11] any kind of way
[1:26:12] he was genuinely a worshiper
[1:26:15] understanding who his god was
[1:26:18] understanding his expectation
[1:26:20] and many spoke about his desire to get
[1:26:22] into custody i remember he called me say
[1:26:24] isaac pray for me i have the exam
[1:26:26] tomorrow and i know if we all agree i
[1:26:28] could and that's the kind of person he
[1:26:30] was he wasn't even trying to go on his
[1:26:32] own ability you know so it was just
[1:26:34] genuine as a preacher whether jason was
[1:26:36] the kind of believer you wanted to
[1:26:38] preach to
[1:26:41] jason was known for many things it has
[1:26:43] been said tonight
[1:26:46] and what is amazing to me and it's so
[1:26:48] consistent because his ancestor angela
[1:26:50] said just look into the facebook
[1:26:52] messages
[1:26:54] jason was
[1:26:55] unashamedly a believer
[1:26:58] whether you were in church or outside
[1:26:59] the church everybody who know jason
[1:27:03] knew this statement everything nice in
[1:27:05] jesus name
[1:27:07] and if i had to give this thought a
[1:27:09] title
[1:27:10] i said the title should be everything
[1:27:12] nice in jesus name
[1:27:14] no matter what is going on everything
[1:27:16] nice
[1:27:17] in jesus name even when you don't feel
[1:27:20] like it everything nice in jesus name
[1:27:23] in this simple powerful statement there
[1:27:25] are many resounding truths
[1:27:28] the bible tells us that all things work
[1:27:30] together for good to them that love god
[1:27:32] and who are called according to his
[1:27:33] purpose it didn't say some things
[1:27:36] they say all things
[1:27:38] all things equals everything
[1:27:41] so when jason would make his statement
[1:27:42] everything nice in jesus name he was
[1:27:45] capturing in that one statement the
[1:27:47] grand magnitude of god to be able to
[1:27:50] take situations that we cannot
[1:27:52] understand and make sense out of it
[1:27:54] even when he does it in his own time
[1:27:56] beyond our ability in this exact moment
[1:27:59] to figure it out everything
[1:28:02] nice
[1:28:03] in jesus name
[1:28:05] the bible says to be absent from the
[1:28:07] body is to be present with the lord
[1:28:09] jason has left this house of flesh
[1:28:12] and has accepted his heavenly promotion
[1:28:16] my grief was tempered by the thought of
[1:28:19] jason joining the heavenly chorus
[1:28:23] and if the jason we see worshiping in
[1:28:26] church where to be part of that great
[1:28:29] heavenly host shouting i am assured that
[1:28:32] jesus is part of the front line
[1:28:34] they would have had to make room
[1:28:36] and welcome him gladly to join the
[1:28:39] chorus of those who are singing holy
[1:28:41] holy worthy wordy
[1:28:43] is the lord god almighty
[1:28:46] in the fatigue anxiety and stresses of
[1:28:48] life
[1:28:49] that have only been amplified by the
[1:28:51] last two years
[1:28:53] if ever there was a time to be certain
[1:28:55] of god is now
[1:28:57] there is a popular statement today you
[1:29:00] only live once
[1:29:01] young people love to say if you only
[1:29:03] live once
[1:29:04] this is a lie
[1:29:06] there's nothing wrong
[1:29:08] in trying to enjoy life
[1:29:10] because as his aunt said he enjoyed life
[1:29:13] he enjoyed good food he loved to travel
[1:29:15] but thought and consideration must be
[1:29:17] given to the life after this
[1:29:21] the thought and consideration of this
[1:29:23] reality is what led jason to not only
[1:29:26] serve the lord but to serve the lord the
[1:29:28] way that he did
[1:29:32] he was not always a hundred percent in
[1:29:33] church he struggled but as he fought his
[1:29:36] way back and what blew my mind in
[1:29:39] particular during these last two years
[1:29:41] of the pandemic when we were locked down
[1:29:44] and unable to meet in the way we we were
[1:29:46] able to
[1:29:48] jason would be
[1:29:49] on the stream
[1:29:51] and is the first time i've ever seen
[1:29:53] someone actually find the emojis to
[1:29:56] amplify use a speaker emoji because
[1:29:59] saying hallelujah was not enough saying
[1:30:01] amen was nothing love he would use four
[1:30:03] speakers as emojis and then hallelujah
[1:30:06] so to let you know that it's not just
[1:30:08] hallelujah but it's the amplified
[1:30:10] shouting hallelujah
[1:30:13] and you know when jason in church
[1:30:15] physically or virtually
[1:30:17] and one time i recognized i said i have
[1:30:19] not seen jesus name and i didn't see him
[1:30:21] these same speakers and hallelujah under
[1:30:23] a different name i say hey daisy he was
[1:30:26] another device but it was so consistent
[1:30:29] his speaker speaker speaker and the
[1:30:30] hallelujah glory that was him
[1:30:33] at that point in time it really as
[1:30:36] others have said resonated how real
[1:30:38] he really was because in the virtual
[1:30:40] environment when people didn't have to
[1:30:42] come to church and you have nobody to
[1:30:44] show that you're shouting and you're
[1:30:45] jumping he had a choice to sit back he
[1:30:48] had a choice to act he had a choice to
[1:30:50] worship and god help him he did
[1:30:54] he was a believer he believed in a
[1:30:56] rapture he believed in the resurrection
[1:30:59] he believed in getting your heart right
[1:31:01] with god
[1:31:02] as a minister of the gospel
[1:31:05] i knew certain services that he would
[1:31:07] respond to a certain way because in his
[1:31:10] heart in his deep heart he desired
[1:31:12] perfection he desired adoption he
[1:31:15] desired the holy ghost he desired a holy
[1:31:18] sinless life it was it resonated with
[1:31:20] him and that is not something that he
[1:31:22] could have put there is something that
[1:31:24] god put in his heart that he was just
[1:31:26] responding to the word he saw his name
[1:31:29] the mystery of who he was he knew he was
[1:31:32] more than just an existence on this
[1:31:34] earth he knew he was a creature from
[1:31:36] eternity trapped in time and he has just
[1:31:39] returned
[1:31:40] from his origin
[1:31:43] everything nice in jesus name
[1:31:45] all is well
[1:31:47] all will be well everything nice in
[1:31:50] jesus name
[1:31:51] that statement everything nice in jesus
[1:31:54] name it is well with my soul it's the
[1:31:56] same thing and i believe tonight all is
[1:31:58] well with his soul
[1:32:01] i always say when i'm given the
[1:32:02] opportunity to speak at services such as
[1:32:05] these i am not worried about brother
[1:32:07] jason tonight
[1:32:11] my worry is not for him tonight
[1:32:15] these
[1:32:16] moments these opportunities pause and
[1:32:19] cause us to reflect on us
[1:32:22] because i want to see my friend again
[1:32:26] and now as brother stephen kangali said
[1:32:29] when god takes some of his best men of
[1:32:30] the scene
[1:32:32] it is for the rest of us who are here to
[1:32:34] step up to finish this great work
[1:32:35] because we have a great commission and
[1:32:37] we have responsibilities to make a
[1:32:39] church that will bring a revival
[1:32:42] to come to perfection to bring on the
[1:32:44] resurrection jason has joined all the
[1:32:47] believers who have gone before who are
[1:32:49] waiting for us to come into our position
[1:32:51] in god
[1:32:52] also we shall not all sleep
[1:32:56] but we who are alive and remain will be
[1:32:58] caught up with them who have gone before
[1:33:00] so jason has joined those who are
[1:33:02] waiting on us we have a responsibility
[1:33:05] tonight
[1:33:06] and the question remains and the
[1:33:08] question will always remain
[1:33:10] are you ready
[1:33:12] in closing for me in particular jason
[1:33:15] was an especially
[1:33:18] a real shock because as well jason
[1:33:21] williams said and everyone say it's it's
[1:33:23] a different generation
[1:33:26] we consider ourselves a young people
[1:33:29] and that is what made it resonate
[1:33:31] because it brought a stark reality
[1:33:34] that god is the boss
[1:33:36] he is in control he is sovereign he can
[1:33:39] do what he wants to do and each of us on
[1:33:42] a daily basis have to be in a position
[1:33:44] to give an account it's easy to get
[1:33:46] caught up in the hustle and bustle on
[1:33:48] his life and he struggled and he
[1:33:49] listened and the news and he and it's a
[1:33:52] lot going on it's a lot of voices
[1:33:55] but we have to be reminded if it's
[1:33:56] anything about jason we hold tonight is
[1:33:59] he knew how to draw that line of
[1:34:00] separation between his work between his
[1:34:03] family and maintenance walk with god
[1:34:06] he did not let anything compromise his
[1:34:09] walk with god
[1:34:11] the reckless abandon with which he
[1:34:14] worshipped god was not somebody who was
[1:34:16] thinking about his mortgage tomorrow or
[1:34:19] what have to happen in work tomorrow or
[1:34:21] this or that situation when he was in
[1:34:24] church he was a hundred percent present
[1:34:27] as but as stephen said it's an
[1:34:28] inspiration to us it's an encouragement
[1:34:30] to us to give one thousand percent
[1:34:33] because whatever but jason did he did it
[1:34:35] all he gave his all and that is what he
[1:34:38] leaves with me to give
[1:34:41] all
[1:34:42] and to take that statement everything
[1:34:44] nice in jesus name
[1:34:46] to make us relook at situations which
[1:34:49] will be forced to confront situations we
[1:34:51] cannot control situations we have no
[1:34:54] influence over and to look at these
[1:34:57] things with a positive perspective just
[1:35:00] like jesus would say through the
[1:35:01] scripture let the weak say i am strong
[1:35:05] it is looking at situations you may not
[1:35:07] have control over or when things go
[1:35:09] wrong and still having a positive
[1:35:11] outlook god help us to be more positive
[1:35:14] even in this situation to see the
[1:35:16] positive that god wants us to see who
[1:35:19] would expect over 200 people in a zoom
[1:35:21] room tonight but jason is doing in his
[1:35:24] passing and in his promotion he is
[1:35:26] having an impact of all all of our lives
[1:35:29] to reflect so at this time before
[1:35:32] brother anthony comes to sing
[1:35:34] let's just bow our heads as we pray for
[1:35:37] the family
[1:35:39] pray for one another
[1:35:41] oh gracious heavenly father
[1:35:43] lord you are god
[1:35:45] you are king of kings you are lord of
[1:35:47] lords you are the great i am
[1:35:49] you put man in the garden of eden in
[1:35:51] genesis 1 as a spirit man and in genesis
[1:35:54] 2 you pick the dust of the earth and
[1:35:56] place that spirit man in that dust man
[1:35:58] and that man became a living soul
[1:36:01] lord you created us from your thoughts
[1:36:04] and your thinking and lord god in this
[1:36:07] world that we are in lord is just a
[1:36:09] passing light that flashes before we are
[1:36:11] snapped back into into your presence
[1:36:15] lord but just as heaven is real and just
[1:36:18] as lord being in your presence is real
[1:36:21] there's a reality
[1:36:22] lord of another place
[1:36:25] there's also darkness there's also the
[1:36:27] consequence of sin for those who have
[1:36:30] not made things right
[1:36:32] we thank you for the life of our
[1:36:33] precious brother jason
[1:36:35] lord who did everything in his power to
[1:36:37] make things right with you not to
[1:36:39] impress anybody
[1:36:41] not with what people would say or think
[1:36:43] it did not matter to him he wanted to
[1:36:46] serve you we thank you for his testimony
[1:36:48] for his commitment his zeal his passion
[1:36:51] his enthusiasm his consistency father
[1:36:55] lord it's a testimony and encouragement
[1:36:57] to us we thank you for his life and we
[1:36:59] thank you for the impact of his life
[1:37:02] upon all of us
[1:37:03] now at this moment father lord we want
[1:37:06] to pray for his wife
[1:37:08] lord sister crystal in a special way
[1:37:11] lord may you minister to her in the way
[1:37:14] that only you can
[1:37:16] lord there are many ways that we could
[1:37:17] comfort her with words there are many
[1:37:19] things that we can do to assist
[1:37:21] lord but there's an inner peace that
[1:37:23] only you can provide lord the peace that
[1:37:25] surpass it understanding a peace that we
[1:37:28] can't even write about the peace that we
[1:37:30] can't even sing about because lord once
[1:37:32] there's a personal connection and a
[1:37:35] personal interaction with you lord it is
[1:37:38] indescribable so father may you minister
[1:37:41] to her in a special way may you reign on
[1:37:44] love upon her may you bless her
[1:37:47] abundantly lord may you bless lord
[1:37:49] meshach in a special way the son
[1:37:52] father and lord may you cover them and
[1:37:54] protect them with your love with your
[1:37:56] grace with your mercy lord all the
[1:37:58] family members lord near and far local
[1:38:02] and foreign father may you give them the
[1:38:04] comfort lord by these words tonight and

[1:38:15] associates and relatives and neighbors
[1:38:17] and well-wishers and father lord and his

[1:38:30] our walk with you our relationship with
