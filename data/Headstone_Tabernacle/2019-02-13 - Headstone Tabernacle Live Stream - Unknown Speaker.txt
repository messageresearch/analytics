man and I didn't have to be here praise God just yesterday I was in the middle of an incident on the road and it's just the grace of God to show you what you could have what you just missed amen I was coming I was going on my regular route to lunch and work and a few things happened before and it delayed me and I wondered about it but then when I got to that point I caused swallow to the street and there was an exchange of fire gunfire and there's a police officer behind and it was just wild shots happening and then they stopped in a little road and there was this Mexican standoff the drivers of the vehicle had their guns and they were pointing at the officers and everything so I just ran off just enough to slip up the street and run away anyway but a man if I was a second earlier I would have been right in the middle of it because that was my regular route to go where I was going so just God just shows his grease in your life I was right there just to see what I had just been saved from it was just the grace of God to me tonight so I know that I'm here for a purpose tonight because if the devil had his way he would have cut me off but I made it tonight mama I made it praise hallelujah the devil is a liar the devil is defeated his sword goes before us and consumes his enemies round about there's nothing that could touch you tonight that God would not allow that court would not defend you we're not you're not looking great when you are not aware he is cutting off the enemy from around you from in front of you from behind you oh I have every right to shout tonight to praise God tonight to dance to sing or when I see my enemies praise God cut off before me I feel like Miriam tonight I got my tambourine and I'm dancing tonight dancing in the river my enemy hallelujah Oh hallelujah the devil can have some but he cannot have all the devil could have some of them hallelujah but he can't have you tonight because you are predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son you are predestinated to make it in this last hour I believe it all my heart or there's going to be a people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age the final junction of time when the devil say he got everything on the edge of people rise up like Lord of people or until to the works of God the Saint Jesus will be failing them because I Jesus

filled tonight blessed are you blessed us tonight Alleluia was standing on Molokai forward tonight Oh get a lot of shadow pray amen amen amen so I'm so happy tonight and privileged to be called a son of God amen amen hallelujah when I look back and think about all he brought me through when I look back at the times when I didn't have and he's still provided when I did when I was low and he brought me up when I was weak and in my weakness he was made strong when I felt like I was gonna lose my mind when I was crying in the night huh I never snow buddy dad told me Jesus was holding me I may not

stop that when God's prophecy friend God's prophecy is hanging over your life whatever can stop it tonight well hallelujah is too late tonight it's too late for the enemy it's too late for the devil he try to cut you off praise God but you're on your way to the resurrection man so I have a title tonight to give every man according to his work a man to give every man according to his work oh

bring for Christ in this how I want to think about that I think about her marriage because here was Mary she had a revelation and she knew she was to bring for Jesus Christ in her hour nobody else had that responsibility but Mary she was an individual and God didn't matter how many Mary's it had at that time this Mary had a revelation that she was to bring for child of the Holy Ghost she was pregnant she was burdened she had to ride on a donkey all the way to Bethlehem yes it was uncomfortable yes it wasn't a smooth ride she didn't have an air-conditioned car but there was a revelation tongue in her soul that kept her let her know that this journey is not in vain this journey is not in vain this travail is not in vain and your praying is not in vain tonight you're holding on is not in vain there's Sunday we have to bring Forks we are pregnant with something tonight and the devil can't deceive us because we have already received the seed of corn free our world too late to pray another man's seed or the woman's clothes we are not repair we are know who we are a time of silence groaning and travailing silent cry for the abominations that being done in the city somebody gotta cry somebody have to terse somebody have to get real somebody have to get gritty somebody have to get serious somebody have to go to calling on God somebody have to prayer god Rosa panel when Daniel saw a vision I'm sorry I was too boyish for the prophecy to come to pass Daniel caught that's words begin to cry begin to carry on as these Daniel begin to call on God and something gonna happen to you tonight I'm gonna drop upon your heart for you to pray without ceasing until every one of these virtues are living a new hallelujah [Applause] halleluyah halleluyah so tonight after all we've heard and we so blessed to hear these services they've gone on so far and the pastor so anointing bringing good word to us bringing us in a channel of the Holy Ghost bringing us in a channel of the Holy Spirit to beyond expectation for another book of hallelujah Christ in the true church will be a continuation of the book of Acts what caught it in pizza he wants to do in you tonight what part didn't marry he wants to do in you tonight what caught it and Philip and James and John what happened they all received there like a fire they all receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and by one spirit we are baptized into one party one Lord one faith one baptism hallelujah hallelujah back to oneness and God Oh hallelujah holidays we are striving for not this interpretation and that interpretation no back to one God one understanding one Bible one truth one prophet messenger never sent us turn our hearts back to the feet of the father's hallelujah the Pentecostal father's back to another penny costs back to another book of Acts back to more healings battler deliverances back to break through the restoration battle missing limbs being restored but the people being healed and Peters shadow back to another people Oh under the messenger will be the final points to the final age I will shake this world once more hallelujah to give every man I want into this book so it's according to your work you are rewarded hallelujah it's not just a gift give come without calling and repentance what we are talking about are the reward it's a policing of sons it's different praise God hallelujah signs and wonders are gonna follow them that believe the placed ones in the kingdom hallelujah hallelujah amen amen so we don't go flying off the gifts however we're looking for policing of sons in this last hour we're looking for placing of tortures for eight sons positionally place in the father's kingdom place by who my man by politics no but by the pillar five placing the sons that is who place the man in the upper room that is who place the apostles up there wasn't some man come down with an interpretation and had a tree our service about placing and then they go place no no no there wasn't a vote that was gas the Holy Spirit suddenly came into the temple and fill the whole house where they were sitting and the brothers had each one received their liquor fire and otherwise tonight you could receive your own liquor fire the Holy Ghost will pour out on individuals and give individuals a lick of fire and give to every man according as his work shall be hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but we must work while it says t because he our Comment when no man could work and it's kept late and it's time for those eleven our Gentile workers hallelujah hallelujah who a promise that lasts that same penny huh little what final our holiday for the judgments time before the midnight hour is night hallelujah hallelujah so we're getting closer to that time and as we get closer what we see or to put every soul into action what we hear every Sunday every Wednesday or to put every soul in in panic mode because of our deterrence / breach demand that's not too long ago we gotta be circumcised every man had to be circumcised don't city servant had to be circumcised every male anyhow had to be circumcised that is how explicit God was hallelujah hallelujah couldn't escape the Covenant finally every man gotta come true the Holy Ghost it's a humbling thing because no matter how much you preach how much you sing how much you claim to be a Christian you still have to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost no matter how much choirs you try doesn't matter how much you pay you still have to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't care about your dress I don't care about your nice tie you gotta get down on your knees down on your top you got to grovel you got to scream you got to cry you got to kill him you got the travail until bored or something wrong inside your soul it is not something that will keep you hollow when the devil try to take a holy your life Sunday's not to keep you something's gonna rise up and say though he slay me yet I trust him your money can keep you your house can keep you your car can keep you your land I keep you nothing you own can keep you no education nothing your friends for to nothing your family could do God is looking for the token doesn't matter what church you belong to doesn't matter how long you've been a Hebrew how long you been a true he wants to see the token applied he wants to see the blood applied upon your hearts upon your life don't play games with the gospel of Jesus you make your calling and election sure it's a scary thing it's a shakin thing it oughta shake us into a reality to realize that there's not much time left hallelujah why there is still time while there is still a knock we should be groaning we should be travailing we should be looking we should be on an expectation we should be burning but in our hearts to see Jesus to see a reality in my life if the past is anointed that's wonderful but you have to get your own anointing if the pastor got revolution that's wonderful but you have to have your own revelation it's not good enough to say you come to this church but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe the theme of every apostle is how we receive the Holy Ghost since you believe I don't care who you belong to I don't care how long you in the message have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe are you in the church triumphant are you in the Savior's pride come and be baptized into the party for without idolaters sorcerers whoremongers he that loveth and maketh a lie oh my my my I come quickly and my reward is with me there's a reward for your labor but what do we what have you if you label nothing what do we what have you if you haven't put the work in in a natural in order to achieve it take a sacrifice if you do what you're comfortable doing between 9:00 to 5:00 you can never grow beyond that you'll be very good at your 9:00 to 5:00 you'll be very good at your routine but in order for you to get from one stitch to annex it takes growing pains it takes a little extra it takes some night hours it takes some groanings in the night time when people not looking when people not seeing you are they're plugging away you are they're praying away you are there personally you are there filling up your vials you are there putting in your extra oil you are there making your calling making your election sure giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge you are diligent in your prayer closets and your secret space oh jesus said don't do like the publicans they pray in the open looking for commendation looking for accolades but going to your prayer closet shut the door behind you and pray to your father in secrets and he prays and secrets he that season secrets he shall reward you openly raju with the holy ghost he reward you with the person of jesus he'll reward you with that rainbow presence that was around the prophets that was five feet from him that he was sick the Grays are dead that casts out Devils Jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask whatever you will out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water so there's a work to do but all they keep saying and no Reviver didn't come without some kind of sacrifice and he was talking about South Sea more prayed five hours a day and different things isn't that right I need disciples were in the upper room ten days they were up there worshiping they were object creating atmosphere they were up there praying they were up there calling upon God it takes a certain kind of attitude and the Prophet said the right mental attitude is what will bring the Prophet promise the pass is night hallelujah cut out the right attitude gotta have the right approach and I've got to be doing your part in order for the father to take place hallelujah prophet said let me be the revival so we not even putting this on anybody else tonight we are putting this in your lap you've got the Peter revival somebody say Manson you've got to be the Reviver you've got to pray you've got to praise he's got to worship you've got to call upon God you've got to get serious with God we've got to get next to yourself you've got to get dressed for it if you know you have demons in your life not your struggle in which the protoplanet said you did the Synod now you got to do the plain you got to do the callin ouch can't do it for you the pastor can't do it for you but they can't can't do it for you Jasha can't do it for you you got to do that for yourself you got to get up and get or you will get nothing if you don't work jesus said come unto me all ye that heavily-laden I'll give you rest a man is not right I'll give you rest from your labors but you must be laboring it must be a burden it must be a groan there must be a travail hallelujah otherwise what are you resting from know if there's no burden then you get it easy now as they say easy come easy go it's nice but that's not the kind of Christians God wants in this hour because I don't got it easy Adam was given Dominion and he forfeited it for the sin in the Garden of Eden is Arash so God fouled himself and he would not have it like that again but that you would have to fight for your individual inheritance you have to fight to enter back in to that tree of life again Holland God set it up that way yes he did his part but you've got to do your part also it's not pretty enough they just say I'm a Christian and I pay my tithes and I'm a nice person hallelujah between good and perfect and this ministry comfort to bring forth perfection therefore if reflection is required we cannot settle for anything less than that you can't settle for justification come on armed you can't settle for sonification you can't even settle just for the baptism of Holy Ghost but you've got to be willing to go all the way to add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance Oh hallelujah to give every man according as work he said I'm out phony Omega the beginning and the end it's not right he's the beginning and the end there's no it was he that was in the Alpha Church and he that place the Apostles it was he that please Paul in his position is not I was tying the right hand of God when he was positionally placed he himself said that no angel come down and say anything else to you than what I have said let him be accursed because what I'm preaching to you is not my own anointing it's not my thoughts but as what court hasn't feel to me hallelujah right Allah for the church I Jesus have sent mine angel Paul was anointed Paul's an angel sent to the Church of Ephesus to see certain things to reveal certain things the speak certainty was anointed and just as he was anointed it's gonna be a pride anointed to speak the Word of God it will flash like that hallelujah prophets that will flash like lightning when she speaks why because he'll be the authority of God field in a bride and she was in the Alpha socially being in the Omega he is the beginning he is the last hallelujah he is what started this thing and he will end it tonight he'll be in you to bring on the day of vengeance Oh hallelujah on lock the scripture Oh hallelujah hallelujah to bring the manifestation of God for this last thing is now right blessed are they that do His commandments blessed I do who keep his word tonight amen amen blessed are you who keep what a prophet said Oh hallelujah is now right you stay with that word tonight and God will bless you that they might have right to the Tree of Life hallelujah why because you kept his commandments because you obeyed his voice the voice of the angel or it wasn't a man's voice that called you it was a voice of God that spoke to your heart that called you out hallelujah that's why we're here tonight we're not here by chance but it was called a call it was quite a pull us up when we were town when we were in sin when we couldn't speak for self or the voice of the blood spoke better things on our behalf and the blood of evil that blood says not guilty that blood says drop your charges earlier Satan has nothing on you that blood says case dismissed case dismissed on your family case dismissed on your loved ones case this mess up on your life tonight you can receive the Holy Ghost your case has been dismissed the blood of Jesus o Halle kill veto rights or holler to enter in and to receive your portion to receive your inheritance to receive your rights to receive your hallelujah amen amen do you believe it tonight hallelujah Springbok it comin all right okay and bring something here now Minister cannot bring a revival there's no preacher can bring a revival he doesn't pack it with him I know we've read as many times but it's the truth and it needs to be said until it's anchored on in our soul and we take ownership of this quote here because if we all as individuals take ownership of this quote that Springs that the Prophet brought here praise God you see a different church you see a different attitude praise God huh because you are responsible for the anointing that you are bringing into the sanctuary camacho Reviver you come with your noise you commit your one turd you commit your hallelujah atmosphere you Allah you are bringing it with you praise God the minute second branch is now the only thing to do is be loyal to God and His Word you separate a revival has to come by the people in your home in your life been working with you in when nobody else is looking in your home in your life on the job when nobody is looking that when you are working European diligence to make your calling and to make your election sure you are creating an atmosphere you are worshiping you are giving God praise you are doing all that you can all that's required of you is arrives hallelujah hallelujah presidential party I live in sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God no reasonable service it's not right hallelujah to whom much is given much is required isn't alright 3/5 let's to come by the people Wow in your wing in your life now revive her as a definition he's saying he isn't adding new members to a church but it's reviving what you've already got revived means to bring back so a revival to bring back to revive to stir up isn't that right the Prophet said ëi said I stood here some years ago I said for the first time he said by a large body of water which was Lake Michigan I was used it was he was a you know Dean as a missionary any parts of shapes and so on he was about 20 or 21 years old he said and he went up the air when they had some great Easter service and so on and he wanted to see yeah you want to see this large body of water he said it's the first time he saw something like that so he went out on Lake Shore Drive he study a little while ago he said I noticed all them waves jumping up and down and he said they were they were just splashing around so I can imagine the Prophet is his first time seeing such a large majestic body of water and he's observing it for the first time and he said it was just splashing around like that and he said and he thought to himself what what is so excited about what is all the excitement he said and the little waves would start and run out and then be great big waves and bounce into each other and break apart and then the phone would fly up and it will come back in and then I'll see the big waves coming in again and break on the bank like you're used to here he said but he said but that was something new for me he said a man is all right he said so he said well what doesn't what must it be he said well that Lake is having a revival he said that's must be what it is he said it's having a revival is now right it's having a big time he said it's just jumping up jumping down is now right he said and I thought what that's good that's fine he said but you know I thought well I wonder he said if it gets a lot of extra water when it's not a revival he thought he said no there isn't one more drop in it right now than if it was perfectly calm not one bit he said it's the same water he said it's just having a revival it's just jumping up and down when I I thought holily is nice well he said what good does that do he said come to find out that when it's having revival and jumping up and down like that he said it washes all the trash up on the shore he said that's what the church needs is a revival to boil the trash out of the church all the trash down in the seabed all the things you can't see up on the surface sometimes you got trash in your life sometimes you got some things growing up some things stuck up in there only I need some time to water laying little cow and just a little trickle here I thought that they'd never liked to keep you in that atmosphere don't get too riled up don't get too emotional now you just a real common and God will bless you but any time you get to move in any time you got to jump in any time you get to crying any time you get to screaming there's a reaction that takes place the trash all the trash that's in it begins to jump up on the on the bank it begins to purge it

son a man isn't her own he said I do not believe that a revival and we're looking to come it's gonna comment a fashion that we're looking for it he said it always comes contrary to what we're looking for he said on Christ come different John the Baptist and so on he said well if not if anyone would have thought he said I suppose that some of the interpreters of the scripture in John's day would have said well the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare we have the Lord make his paths straight the Prophet said I imagine some of them thought God would slip the corridors of heaven and have an angelic escort coming down quite dramatic is enough coming down to the ground and having some great dignified prophet would come up walking out of glory he said and it was to be so great until this this ministry I was to come forward he said it would be so great the prophecy was that all the low places would be made high and at all the high places with me made low and the mountains would skipped like rounds and all the leaves were gonna clap their hands and so forth he said what an event it was gonna be or what the people must have looked to see in those times but what did they come to pass to be he said on all fuzzy-looking preacher with a sheepskin wrapped around him probably never took a bath every three or four months but he walked out of the wilderness prophet said standing up in the mud on his knees and hollering repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand already he said that is when the high places was made low that is when the low places was made high when John come on screaming hallelujah a different name he wasn't like Hezekiah but I or any one of them he was John God called him difference he was eaten looks and wild honey he was a different man he was a
