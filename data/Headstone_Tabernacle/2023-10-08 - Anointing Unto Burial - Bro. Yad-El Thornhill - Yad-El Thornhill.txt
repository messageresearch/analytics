brother tonel about something that happened about 30 plus years ago I had invited him to uh to eat have a something to talk with him fellowship with and he never asked me why how it came about but only this year I shared with him something the Lord showed me concerning him and I feel today I'm actually walking into a vision so I know that uh it's just what's timing of things you can't speak everything but you could just walk by faith so since way back then I couldn't tell him that but I told him that this year I told him what the Lord told me about 30 plus years ago so I know that uh nothing is by chance and everything is in order and everything according to Romans 820 work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose so nothing is out of timing I always believe that God have his men everywhere God have his Davids everywhere remember David didn't just come out from the Army David wasn't polish in Boots he was seeing about sheep in the backside of the desert nobody knew they wasn't there they wasn't there they wasn't there they didn't see what happened but when ready when God is ready God will take a man from the back and bring him to the front when God is ready when God is ready God could do whatever he have to do you may be seated and what I love about God he doesn't have to ask anybody permission to do anything he could bless he could deliver he could give you a miracle this morning he could free you from your past free you from your guilt free you from your fears he could do that right this morning oh give the Lord some

all the people round about and when they shall be in The Siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem and at that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people and all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it in that day sayith the Lord I will Smite every horse with astonishment and his rer with Madness and I will open my eyes unto the house of Judah and will Smite every horse of the people with blindness and today we in this service right where Israel said they at War Israelites Israel's

of our loving Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is certainly a privilege to be with you all over on this side of the vineyard is something that uh God had in his mind before the foundation of the world and we creers of time you know would have been making plans over the past few months and uh but it was God had had this great day in mind and we pray that his thoughts would be expressed to us we know what we come expecting is what we would receive by God's grace believe our cups are emptied and lifted up and brother he's here to f fill our every heart's desire to God we give all the glory so while we are standing we just want to turn in our Bibles we want to go to Matthew chapter 26 verse one and it came to pass when Jesus had finished all these Saints he said unto his disciples so we know what Saints they're talking about right Matthew chapter 26 is on the heels of chap 24 which you have him opening up the Seven Seals and then go over into chapter 25 with the wise virgins and the foolish virgins the bride that could take that word and hand it there a bride that has oil in her lamps after these things uh when he finished all these things he said unto his disciples you know that after two days is the Feast of the Passover when the son of man is betrayed to be crucified so he knew the Jun he that then assembl all the chief priests and the scribes and the Elders of the people unto the Palace of the high priest who was called cifas and consulted that they might take Jesus by subtlety and kill him but they said not on the feast day least there be an upro among the people and when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper there came unto him a a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat his meat and when his disciples saw it they had ignation saying to what purpose is this waste for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor and when Jesus understood it he said unto them why trably the woman for she had wrought a great a good work upon me for you have the poor always with you but me ye have not always for in that she poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial verily I say unto you they prophecy now wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world right Jesus was going to die but he knew the gospel would live up you could take the messenger away can't take his message Hallelujah wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman had done be told for a memorial of Me no of her glory be to God in highest Blessed Be name may the Lord Jesus add the riches of His blessings to the reading of his word we may be seated this morning am amen and amen so we certainly feel the warmth the welcome the atmosphere that created here in the Assembly of the Saints the Church of the firstborn brother we thank God for the opportunity to be here that has been in trusted unto us brother to a mighty man of Valor brother Isaac all the brothers here that would see fit to allow a little nobody as I am to come and say something to God somebody's amen I'm just a little nobody trying to tell everybody about somebody Hallelujah brother who can save their souls amen hallelujah hallelujah so as the prophet say we are Mortals we will have shortcomings we will have mistakes but this word will never fail amen and uh you know uh do believe need any introduction to this morning brother Theo say we don't need any introduction he said just go ahead into the word so we want to go straight into the word by God's grace uh you know we want to see what God would have have in stored for us this morning amen and uh we want to take for a little thought this morning anointing unto burial uh this comes from this chapter here we want to read a few scriptures this morning and see what God would give us Grace what the holy spirit will open up to us this morning and this scene here this anointing uh unto burial this was a season 2,000 years ago that was a junction there but we know the Bible is not a hist history book where things happen and that is it you know but our God is the present tense Hallelujah present continuous Hallelujah he is the great I am not I was or I will be but the I am he's ever present Hallelujah so that God you know things would happen and we would see things happen in the Old Testament things happen in the New Testament but those are shadows there are a lot of prophecies there are lot a nuggets locked up inside of there for us coming down on the journey now remember this is the Golden Age this is the age that all men long to live Hallelujah this is the climax this is the closing and God keeps the best wine for last so in this closing of time the scene the events the things that taking place there is a selected bunch of people to keep up with the continuity of what is going on and how we keep up with continuity we watch what was and we understand what will be and it gives us a clear picture of where we are all right so in this scene here we want to see from this little scene this morning what God would have for us this morning because I believe it was anointing dear un to burial that was quite back there but it have a lot to do with us today all right so our God is the same yesterday today and forever he change it not and we saw you know it was coming down to the time of the crucifixion which was the for ordained predestinate predestinated councel of almighty God that Jesus should being the lamb should walk this journey he should Walk This Way he knew Hallelujah as your pilot and they said Bo you don't know I have power over you he said what you have no power unless it given you from above for this cause came out into the world Hallelujah so he knew based on scripture his ministry started brother his entire life was scripture before he came brother prophets prophesied of him his birth was under prophecy his life was prophecy Hallelujah he was introduced the man to introduce him was prophesied of thousands of years hundreds of years before he was born that's John the Baptist his death his resurrection was side everything about his ministry was was in Prophecy so with prophecy the thing about prophecy is that you cannot make it come to pass there there's a lot of time for it to come to pass so we would understand with Jesus Jesus understood his Junctions all right and there was a time for everything so Jesus coming down here and we had the opening of the World chapter 24 and chapter 25 he give them the the the the foolish virgins the wise virgins and you know he was bringing them into an atmosphere Hallelujah of something yeah and chapter 26 here we saw where the council had to tighten up to bring certain things to come to pass so for them to tighten up they needed some inside information Hallelujah Israel and end up in war J you know so they want know how those bombs thousands of bombs could drop missiles and Israel don't know anything it had to come some inside thing had to be covered up something had to leak from inside so they they want to deal now with the intelligence agency how you all don't know that this was coming on all right but man could be caught una awes but not almighty God hallelujah so the man to unite with the state was Judas he was the inside man that was to give information he had to sell that information Hallelujah and Jesus knew from the beginning he said I've chose 12 but one of you is a devil so he understood exactly brother what it took to bring him to that stage so it wasn't a disappointment for him weers get disappointed Hallelujah but but God is not disappointed that was already written in the script so Jesus here he knew the time was coming down and uh these Chief priests wanted to get him but that had to be so now notice the lamb had to be inspected he had to pass you a period of inspection so Jesus now coming up to that week of inspection Hallelujah he had to be spotless Hallelujah very good now he end up here in betting in the house of Simon the leper and an event took place now before he came to Bethany it was a journey he was on because he was wrapping up coming down to the end of his ministry and he left Jericho and he was coming down he had bet araba and then he had Bethany had Jerusalem Bethany was n unto Jerusalem so leaving Jericho the cursed he go into the city of the bless hallelujah amen glory be to God in the highest coming down to the end of his of his journey leaving the curse going to the bless Hallelujah and going to the bless There They Crucified him they the most holy place they the most holy people crucify the most gruesome that him the most holy one what a paradox all right so leaving there on his journey what took place is that Jesus had a close friend and this friend's name was Lazarus amen so we we could trace the story in different gospels Matthew the king portrayed it a certain way uh if we go over to John the eagle we would see John's description of this same event uh in chapter 12 in the Book of John and uh chapter 12 in St John came on the heels of chapter 11 yes now chapter 11 11 was the resurrection of Lazarus now let us watch this scene a little bit here this morning to understand because the anointing took place after the resurrection Hallelujah of Lazarus okay so Lazarus being one that Jesus loved fell sick Lazarus as a scribe brother in the temple he dealt in all the books he understand the he understood the word of God hallelujah he was he was a great friend with Jesus now you see the kind of friends that Jesus had Hallelujah show me your friends and I'll tell you who you are Hallelujah now notice Lazarus was not a disciple he wasn't an apostle but he was a friend Hallelujah and God deals a certain way with his friends Hallelujah Glory P to God in the highest and Lazarus fell sick and Mary and Martha who were sisters sent to call Jesus so St John chapter 11 a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany now we know Bethany means House of misery so the location have a lot to do with what was go on in your life that was a house of misery so there would be things that would happen there that uh it was miserable for them Hallelujah that came in in the house and notice that always come when Jesus is absent when AB when Adam was absent the serent came to eeve Hallelujah so it's in the absence is where the devil slipping and it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wipe his feet with a hair whose brother Lazarus was sick so we understanding now who it was it was Mary so Matthew say a woman Hallelujah but John the eagle Hallelujah he saw a little higher he gave us a name you see because name is important oh glory be to God in the highest amen you know for the anointing to drop in the book of Acts you had 120 in the upper room and you know the scriptures say they they check the number of the names Acts chapter 1 verse 15 so your name is important in Hallelujah Prophet show that new name will be revealing it th all right so God have something in store for us a revelation specific to this bride it had to be revealed to you personally and God don't really count numbers people he count names Hallelujah in those days verse 15 acts 1:15 in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said the number of the names together were about 120 namous characteristics so not just number of people but number of names your name is important Hallelujah rejoice when you see a name written in the book Hallelujah because this flesh is not important this flesh is not written any book this flesh can get sick but there's a name Hallelujah that is Ted down to this the name is inside there and the name causes this to behave a certain way your name is over your feeling Hallelujah you might be sick but because of who you are your representation in God's word it brings this under subjection Hallelujah so name is important Hallelujah sometimes you're born and your family give you the wrong name Hallelujah but because of fats and things that are done yeah men receive a name change for the work that lays ahead you shall no more be called Simon but Peter Peter is Stone is Rock his confession had to do with his ministry what is coming up Hallelujah so Jesus changed his name Abram is not father Nations but Abraham so just before brother the manifestation came the name changed right so name is important so John give us the name he identified who it was now this Mary was a certain kind of a woman and um they sent a CER to tell Jesus that so he left Jericho and he was coming down he was in bet Arab somewhere around there and uh his this messenger came with the message Jesus he whom thou lovest is sick and you know what Jesus did Hallelujah he heard the message Meer and he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God and he remain where he was the script say when he heard thereof he was sick he had Bor two days still in the same place where he was then after that he said to his disciples let us go to Judea again so two days on the third day he said let us go the journey day and by the fourth day Lazarus done dead and buried it's four days he dead all right so look at this when Jesus came I was showing you this family this Mary and Mara when Jesus came to the house well he didn't reach to the house yet but as he was going we know the disciples say well boy Jesus say he's sleeping they say well if he's sleeping he do well and Jesus now you see what he was in a real he saw something already and he saw this was for the glory of God so the disciples now down in the humanistic realm Jesus in a realm of divine revelation in a realm of vision he a little higher so it's possible you could be walking with someone but they in a different realm they're in a different dimension than you are in Hallelujah Elijah saw innumerable company of angels all around and Elijah was at ease and GES worried said Lord open the boy [Applause] eyes Hallelujah so it depends what you're looking at it depends what you're seeing Hallelujah God taking us higher in every day with God is higher and higher is deeper and deeper so the Propet shows us if you have like a fish or or let's say you mission missing a sense of sight and someone tell you boy those flowers so beautiful but all you could do is touch it all right then when you receive your sight now it is an added sense that makes this thing so much beautiful now the sense don't put it there you know but the sense now gives you the ability to to Rich it to appreciate it Hallelujah your healing is there already know fear don't bring it in it is there Hallelujah but by we can walk through it when that senses open up to us amen so you sure now if you missing your sight you cannot appreciate it but then when you receive the sight you can appreciate it you so on that next side when you receive your new body that body don't function by T see taste smell touch it function in a higher realm Hallelujah we receive a higher sense that is a thousand times better than these senses what would that life be Hallelujah glory be to God in highest so God giv us glimpses of that he taken us into a higher realm now Glory you watch Faith now Jesus in that realm he say sleep it they say if he sleep it that good Jesus said no what he dead he said but I'm going to wake him they said all right we going wake him now when Jesus reached and they heard that Jesus was coming so they run before he came he came into the village he didn't reach to the house yet he came into the village and news came Jesus is coming now while Jesus delayed there is a test of their Fai because this is the man that they love this was a friend he had a room in the house and now when difficulty come he know where wrong so imagine what the Pharisees would have been saying to Mary and at that time all right Hallelujah but Mary wasn't weak in F Mary is a type of the Bride is a certain kind of woman hallelujah hallelujah early on in Luke I believe it's Luke chapter 10 we saw Jesus in the house before they sickness took place right in Bethany in Mary's and mata's house and and while Jesus was there it came to pass he went verse 28 M Luke 10:28 he entered into a certain Village in and a certain woman named Mara received him into her house yeah and she had a sister called Mary which also sat at Jesus's feet and heard his word be not yeah Mara received him into the house but Mary sat at his feet and received the word Hallelujah two sisters this is the same sisters later down Hallelujah I'm showing you your test is be Faith your faith is be test right Glory she received his word and Mara was cumbered about much serving if we have enough juice if we have enough plates we have no napkins on the table yet the food ain't finished who ain't bring this this one us to bring that and she cumbered and the word going [Applause] [Applause] about she could as come upon what certain and came to him and said Lord does not now care that my sister had left me to serve alone better her therefore that she helped me glory be to God let us hear Jesus's response now now the private show with sister maida when she got the tumor and she was sick she always want to know how she could serve the Lord better and like she can't do enough and he said little does she know how you serve your husband is how you serve the Lord right so the woman really supposed to make sure that things prepared and in an order to feed Elohim but you see in the season a Revival the prophet told us the the housewife now they turn over the [Applause] part glory be to God any highest Hallelujah the season changed you see because it's more than than natural food Hallelujah we need some spiritual food Hallelujah so let us hear Jesus's response Jesus has has some kind of response Hallelujah so here let's hear the you see the word disc correct the error let's hear what the word had to say about this and Jesus answered and said unto her m m Thou Art careful and trouble about many things but one thing is needful and Mary had chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her Hallelujah glory be to God in the highest so it's a long time Hallelujah Mary at Jesus feet Mary receiveing the word your food will pass how good that meal all that is good these things are good but one thing is needful and that is the word Hallelujah that is the most important thing you see because that wasn't a a a a a something he was listening from Noah time and Moses time that was scriptural revealed mystery truths for that day Hallelujah present fulfillment this is the same Jesus that opened the eyes of the 200 amus Hallelujah so you have a way break that bread and when that word start to come Hallelujah food is not important your bills don't become important your sickness is not important that word is brother be like a fire in your bones Hallelujah one thing is needful and Mary chose the good part which shall never be taken from her so watch that word is like a seed when it's planted it do go it's only produced after it kind glory be to God in highest train up a child any ways should go when he's old he won't depart from it Mary had chosen the good part brother we want to make the right choice this morning you see because life how life is busy have many things you could do besides P emphasis on that word of God many other things to distract you we need to spend time in the word at the feet of Jesus Hallelujah glory be to God in the [Applause] highest hallelujah amen so when MAA now so Mara got a rebuke there in front of everybody so when Lazarus died and Jesus didn't come the Pharisees and their say but and that is the man that love all you all you see about him all you make clothes for him and now here and come I tell all long time all leave our church so go and follow this man who are nothing and in he time and need he know where wrong hallelujah hallelujah but look M fi waver a bit but Mary F didn't W she knew just recently there was a widow n coming down with a dead son and Jesus rast the boy so even though he doesn't come let him answer for himself when he come here he knows best Hallelujah so Martha was a bit cumbered so when the news came now that Jesus entering the village Mara left the house and she run down to meet [Applause] Jesus and when she she met him she said Lord if you had been here my brother would have never die Hallelujah but I know even now Lord you see that even now Hallelujah whatever you ask God he more than able to bring it to pass Jesus say your brother rise again he said well yeah I know you Rising the last day he said no no no he said that thing you're looking for down there you got to recognize all that locked up India that New Jerusalem the Millennium all of that is in a person when Jesus walked there all of that was in him he is [Music] it Hallelujah and if we have him we have everything Hallelujah so don't put it on for another day it is here with us is Christ revealing his word hallelujah the person of Grace that could satisfy every need that is there's nothing too hard for death and if it come to pass and death come then he allow it that's his will all right you got to understand that so it's who with us there's someone with us don't look down the road this it it here and you're going to see something Hallelujah believest thou this and the key is to believe it with the prophet the angel told him get the people to believe you and nothing even cancer will stand in your way so the key about it is getting us up into that atmosphere you see it's a certain presence that he bringing us into Hallelujah and those pulsations of Faith this they start to move Hallelujah in this Seasons those moments are crisis Hallelujah and you start to see the hand of God on the scene so believest th this you see the word for your Day present tense so he spoke to Martha there but Mary wasn't there notice [Music] Hallelujah she said I know I believe you are the Christ verse 28 and when she had so said she went away and called Mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and call it for the he talking to Mara yes but we Mary Hallelujah that's the one where is she Hallelujah you see because for the vision to be fulfilled everybody had to be in order Hallelujah the prophet taught us that whether is a lady with a red dress had to sit on in a certain chair or somebody with her glasses glory be to God it had a brother that needed to be healed uh there was some Demon on him either epilepsy or some forceful demon that would come on him and they told the prophet they wanted him to pray for him the prophet said all right bring him loose him I will pray for him they said no he he terrible and if you lose him and we can't do that and they afraid So eventually they say well after the service and um God showed the prophet a vision and they took him out to this park and the the thing about it is that in the vision everything was right the guy was in the car but there was a certain car parked on the other side of the park that was really gold or red or something like that and at that time when they after the meeting was dismissed uh they they went to open because they they afraid if they let go the man he would destroy the prophet so we going and do this thing now in a field it could run so they they went by a park and they loosen him in the back but the prophet see the thing already and he say watch we had a wait in him because there was the car over there but it's supposed to be either a red or a gold or something red right and at that time of the night the car looking let me say white or gold or gray whatever so they had to wait he said that is not the car so they had to wait whole night and then when the sun start to rise in the morning and the sun start to shine on the car that whether it's black or gold car or whatever it turned to red or whatever I may have the colors mix up but you understand but the reflection of the Sun on it changed the color and then the prophet say now is the time loose him Hallelujah glory be to God any higher so there's a timing for everything your deliverance there's a timing for it Hallelujah glory be to God in the highest where is Mary call for her hallelujah hallelujah amen the master call it for the was a relationship hallelujah thank you sir so he call it for thee and amen GL God in now watch the prince of the House of David the prophet referred to that book and um that book has a lot of nice things about Jesus and his walk and and what they were saying there is that Mary remained in the house she heard Jesus was coming but she wasn't answer she you know she went remain in the house because if you hear Jesus coming everybody get up and the Run matter get up and run but Mary remained preparing his room she had confidence brother that he is coming he has a purpose all is well amen so she stayed there and she prepared his room and there were some Jews that were with her and uh look at the as soon as she heard that verse 29 she arose quickly so when Mara came down she called she say he the master calling for you then she arose quickly and she went and Jesus was not yet come into the tongue but he was at a place where Mara met him and then this is where all the Jews came up and they were following him and uh the the tomb of Lazarus was before before the house of Lazarus all right so on the way the idea is after this Mata ran to the house to start to prepare things now because Jesus say he will live again amen so after Mary prepared a room for Jesus Mar run back home now to prepare for Lazarus because Lazarus coming the thought is Jesus not coming in the house without Lazarus everything taking place on the outside when he reach back here Lazarus will be at his side Hallelujah Glory Peter confidence Hallelujah and this is what God bringing us in today by day is a confidence that God will keep his word what he said he's able to bring to pass Hallelujah we talking about a raptor we talking about a body change Hallelujah we can't produce that we can't do it but we believe in one who promis it Hallelujah and his words his promises are yeah and there if he say it he will bring it to pass Hallelujah so this is where the resurrection of Lazarus took place on the outside before he came home and Mary came now no Noti when Mary came verse 32 she go onto the grave to weep there so everybody say well Mary going and weep and they start a follow off verse 32 and when Mary was come where Jesus was she saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him Lord if thou been here where she fell at his feet again now when she fell at Jesus's feet there those were Dusty bruised feet from the journey Jesus didn't come in an air conditioned car is [Applause] walking she found herself down at Jesus's feet and her attitude was Lord if you had been here my brother had not died and then Jesus when he saw Mary weaping he started Gro within him said he said where you put him where you lay they said let him come and see and Jesus WEP this is the shortest verse in the Bible Hallelujah and when they saw Jesus weeping they said boy look how we loved him and uh they said boy he could have been here uh he wouldn't have died but God had a purpose in this all right and he told them take away the stone and we know the whole story how it went and Jesus now he lifted up his eyes to Heaven he said father know you always hear me Hallelujah it was a vision he saw he knew that's right this was the time when the son should be glorified Hallelujah Glory I thank thee that thou has heard me father I know that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by I said it that they might believe that thou has sent me and when he had does when he D had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come Fort and he that was dead came for so wherever his Spirit was in that Dimension brother corruption his eyes had sunken already and all that went on corruption was already in the body when Jesus called corruption knew it master and everything started to come back together and Lazarus came out Jesus told him loose him let him go so he came out bom W but he had to be loosed hallelujah look at it out of your situations now the word just call you out of your situations but you still had to REM uh be able to take correction Lazarus come and say boy I raise no he can't lose himself the people are wrong you with love and with affection and watching what going on in your life they could be able to take those napkins and cloths from off of you Hallelujah that the master could hug you up now Hallelujah so it's humility this thing we can't be proud about this is a life of humility even though you delivered you had to be loosed and who loosen you not Jesus now but he led the people around you all you loose so the word coming but you to allow your neighbors your fellow brothers to Luci you from that condition let him go now [Music] Jesus after this when this took place you know what happened many Jews the scripture said then many of the Jews which came to Mary had seen these things with Jesus they believed on him you know what going on that was on the heels of his entry into Jerusalem right after that it's gy donkey now you see what going on there scriptures had to be fulfilled Daughters of Zion Hallelujah [Music] Rejoice but God had a allow before that season he had to get people to believe he had to get people to Rejoice he had to get people hallelujah animated they they had to be so what God did the thing look bad it look like your loved ones dead so we going to lose some loved ones just before the entry Hallelujah going to lose some loved ones but God has a purpose in it do we understand that this morning the thing look bad but it's to get people to believe because those same people had a scale palm trees cut down branches show the clothes on the floor to welcome that man in Hallelujah so that scene there it's St Revival in Bethany and Beany was just 2 miles to Jerusalem Hallelujah GL Glory so when they singing hosana hosana To The King D just saying hosana just so hosana the King Jesus Christ is Lord hallelujah amen it's a triumphal entry he ain't begging for worship now it's Triumph Hallelujah there were armies that was following him glory be to God in highest in that first coming was a donkey a cult but brother we saw in third coming brother is a white stallion and there were armies following him of which we are part of this morning so God allowing these dark situations for his glory to get people to believe now we coming to the anointing here is after this now where Jesus in chapter 12 6 days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was which had been this in John 12:1 which Lazar where Lazarus which had been dead whom he raised from the dead so this was just before the feast six days how they counting it is in that way so it's just the day before the seven day now is where you're coming into the feast so is around two days there and then the feast so the feast coming up the entry coming up and here is a little setting in the home so you would see uh they show you that the house of Simon the leper was not too far there from from the house of the the tomb of Lazarus all right so in that same vicinity there was the house of Simon the leopard now we don't want to confuse the scripture because this anointing this was in the house of Simon the leper in St Luke chapter 7 there was another Simon also but he was a Pharisee all right not the same Simon it was a different Simon and it was a different woman all right that anointed his feet now the woman in chapter 7 in St Luke is the the ill Fame woman that came brother and she recognized Jesus was unwelcomed in that Feast brother and she went and she spent all that she had to buy the best perfume to come and anoint the [Applause] Lord it was a sinful woman and now she washed his his feet with her tears wipe them with her hairen and everybody that stood by say if he was a prophet he would have know what kind of woman is that Hallelujah he says Simon I want to ask you something you have two men right there was a creditor vers 41 Luke 7 ver 41 which had two debtors and one owed 500 p and the other one 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgiv them both tell me therefore which of them will love him the most Hallelujah everybody quiet in the feast Simon say well I suppose that he whom thou forgest most he said unto him thou has rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon seest thou this woman I entered into thine house and thou givest me no water for my feet that was the custom yeah the fot wash flunky by the door to wash the feet right but had wash but she had washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in had not ceased to kiss my feet look at verse 46 now my head with oil thou did not anoint but this woman had anointed my feet with [Applause] ointment so normally the custom is anoint head and anoint feet we saw Aon when they thr that anointing it's from his head run down all his beard D to the skirts of His Garment Hallelujah that's the kind of experience we have this morning for Brethren to dwell together in unity Hallelujah so anointing is head and feet Capstone and Cornerstone hallelujah hallelujah now this woman was a sinful woman Oh Glory so she wasn't worthy Hallelujah enough to F him in the eyes to anoint the [Applause] head brother but in Hallelujah humility in reverence in a broken Spirit she came at his feet but and tears just side of all Hall she who owe plenty was forgiven so watch at Jesus feet good things has happen at Jesus's feet you can receive he pardon oh glory be to God any [Applause] highest amen good things is happen the feet amen it was at boaz's feet root pulled the cover and she [Applause] entered that was the lord of the Harvest the entrance into that invisible Union starts at the [Music] feat you had to be able to accept the Cornerstone Hallelujah to be connected with the headstone you see because the Cornerstone is a rock of offense there a stumbling and many stumble right there and if you cannot be identified with him there you can't be identified with him amen so is a union taking place yeah I don't know your position she came at the feet now when we go to Mary now Matthew show us that Mary Anointed The Head isn't that right Hallelujah Glory we going back to Matthew chapter 26 she came with verse seven there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head Mary didn't come for [Applause] forgiveness that was a Justified prde Hallelujah as though she never did it Hallelujah the word was already open to her she saw her name she was him expressed she was born of his BN word of his word hallelujah she had boldness in the day of judgment Hallelujah that woman don't you know the Saints will come in king of kings and Lord of [Applause] lords Hallelujah so Mary didn't come for forgiveness there it was in gratitude for what go because the last time we saw Mary she was at Jesus's feet outside the house and the entrance of the city there but he had Dusty feet bruised feet it didn't she had a need at his feet at that time but at this time oh glory be to God was a different time you had the dead in Christ Lazarus we had the dead in Christ resurrected you had the Liv Zs gathered and you had the Lord himself at the head of the table that wasn't Dy Fe then brother that is a a a a wedding supper setting Bread and Wine at the head of the communion table where he'll wipe all tears from our eyes you don't have to worry no more Pride it is over it is done that was a different setting so at that time when we reach and we cross over it had no more I did wrong the blood is for here you know the blood is for here you would need blood there blood is for here right huj the token is for here the red cord is for here but when when the red cord was fulfilled that time with Rahab was fulfilled she entered into a union with Solomon she didn't need red cord again she was with the Savior she was with the head of the alley no har can come near her amen so the season was a different season amen glory be to God in the highest so s John 12 now Hallelujah when this woman at Jesus's feet here now in this Feast let us watch this you love the Lord Jesus Hallelujah we had to sit down at his feet a little bit this morning and the Housewives is turn over the pots when we at his [Applause] feet at Jesus's feet look let's watch this from St John let's see how the eagle wrote it St John chapter 12 and they made him a supper Mara served so Martha still serving but Lazarus was one of them that s at the table with him then took Mary a pound [Music] anointment of [Applause] SP only mentioned in the Bible in Ecclesiastes now they should have came from it could be from up in India somewhere around there so it's imported [Applause] thing right A P that's a latinum now what this not perfume but we and get spray she is praying enough glory be to God in highest she took a p of [Applause] ointment of spite now when the script talk about spite n it cry back to Ecclesiastes ready beloved she was sitting at the feet s s songs sorry songs one Hallelujah and when she was at this songs one Hallelujah we love the [Applause] [Music] Lord glory be to God set the king sat at the table and the come on how not seeing it here right there 46 King sat his table rise up uh 11 112 that is it that is it while the king Songs of Solomon 112 come on you know Songs of Solomon that beloved come on Hallelujah and the bride might girl is a love relationship and with love you don't make love don't we know the labas labas is where they GA all the rubbish and your cble flying and it a certain stench there you don't take your wife out for a date down by the labas all right so the atmosphere had to be right the fragrance had to be [Applause] right while the king SED at his table my spard sended forth the smell [Music] [Applause] thereof so the king sit down and the Beloved have something to fragrance a fragrance to to change the atmosphere at that time it not coming from Jesus now it coming from the [Applause] Beloved all right now look at this the King sitting at the table that Jesus and the spite now all right let's read it verse three John 12:3 then took Mary a pong of ointment of nard so for her to have that she had to bring that [Applause] in so sometimes we get trouble people say all believe in a white man thing this in come from Trad this is important stuff but the thing about this it in a [Applause] vessel right what this was locked up in wasn't a glass bottle but it was a Alabaster bottle it was an alabas no Alabaster what they said Alabaster is really a kind of a white [Applause] [Music] stone locked up in the white stone have some contents inside of there that light never Shine On that he had to break the cap of it Hallelujah glory to God you need someone to be caught up into the headstone to give you the revelation of that now that is a costly thing you know you had to go out to get that the prophet couldn't get that East you had to go west now is a fragrance is a revelation it's things locked up inside that box that is had to break the Box Don't Spray it now you had to break the Box a stone now is a stone it's not it's not like M it's a white stone stone is revelation locked up inside of there there's a fragrance that needed at that season at that [Applause] Junction all right now let us watch this here let's watch this fragrance a little bit quickly we're going to we could take it from either mark glory be to God [Music] in Matthew chapter 26 Judas got real trouble with that we got to understand it Judas get real trouble because she anoint head and foot and as far as judah's concerned you waste that glory be to [Music] God Judah say you could have sell that and get 300 P of [Applause] that glory be to God in how we love the Lord Jesus all right so I want to show you this here what took place here hallelujah right glory be to God thank you Lord Jesus so hallu amen s John same chapter and John all right we take it from John 4 John 12:4 just sorry for that but look at this here this is important for us to understand in this season all right because um Judas now simonon verse4 which should be Tri why was not this ointment sold for 300 P so he no [Applause] [Music] money he know how much he could have get for that 300 p and given to the poor this said he not that he cared for the poor but because he was active and had the bag and bear that which was put there in 300 P now I want us to understand something that's a lot of money you know one pence is like we know the scripture that the the laborers went into the the vineyard to work and their hire was a penny right for the day so that word Pence is the same penny is a Denarius uh so you work whole day for one p Comm on sense a whole day pay is one p this is 300 P so that's a whole year work that's not just one year working when you're working you have bills to pay you to eat food they have all that so that not a year work it's a year work with no money for you so that would be really years of saving to make up 300 [Applause] P Hallelujah glory be to God in highest it costly now you know what just to show your money the Widow went to throw some money a day amen and that was called a might that's a little cup of coin she had two mites there they said that might is one5 of the the Pence well the Pence is really 15 cents and the might is really 1/5 of a cent right so one day pay you'll get 15 cents which is like a pence 15 cents is one p the might that the Widow putting is one fifth of one of those 15 and in Jesus's estimation Hallelujah when she put that she put more than all the rich men amen she put more than the rich man so God is not watching quantity now she placed out of her abundance she placed out of her needs s she had needs you know when we come in the church and we putay offering not because you have but because you know there's a blessing inside of there and you have needs and maybe you put in the offering and you don't know what going to happen tomorrow for the children for school but he's still Jehovah Gyra amen look at [Music] this we going over to Matthew how Matthew put it chapter 26 the scripture says Judas get real trouble with that so you see you can't serve God by what people feel you should do you had to do as you are [Music] LED amen now look at this um Judas now in in Jesus said she did this verse 14 in Matthew chapter 26 then one of the 12 this Matthew 26 ver 14 called Judas Iscariot went out so this after that feast and that night atmosphere and the place smelling up Judas and all with with a smell on him because that smell don't it don't finish you wash it it's still there and if you're going B come out smelling Smokey right so Judas left with that sent on him but it couldn't change him the anointing cannot change the [Music] seed hallelujah amen he was in the atmosphere of it Hallelujah the prophecy is because you are seen you could be reborn but baptism don't change nothing right so when the that Dynamics fall and that anointing dropped down former and latter R together in the first month tears and we rejoicing so it bringing them to fullness and it bringing the brighter fullness [Applause] [Music] just bringing out what inside of you so that's why his colors had to show before pus right now Judas went unto the chief priest so he went with the World Council of churches there now he have inside information he sell out and said you know Judas is the one on money he said unto them what will you give me and I will deliver him unto you and they covenanted with him for 30 pieces of silver watch this in her estimation she took years of saving to pour out in one [Applause] second and Judas watched to reveal word for the hour the person of Christ made flesh amongst us and sell out for 30 pieces of silver which is just about 3 months it's just like 30 P then 30 days work right so it it really how it work out is it's a little more value but just let me say a month or two of work pay so the value Saints young people when you sell out you just always get less than what the real word is right God give us certain things we had to preserve young people right your Chastity you had to preserve certain things when you s out to the devil you don't get much 30 pieces of silver and this woman when she estimate that just TR Hallelujah it's something about Jesus you know that is I believe is Napoleon was saying he said something about that man Jesus he said because for me he said I could get men to die for me you know he said but my presence would be necessary he said but Jesus is gone he said anywhere around the world at this time men will still give their life to him what is that we don't serve God by sh them men when they are wrong you give up your life because they wrong the boss the mafia there Jesus not like that when you really enter that relationship with him you realize everything you have is his you've given it freely you see because that that was the atmosphere when in Exodus when uh Moses was building the Temple the the all the vessels and the gold for the temple and the the CLA the goate here died and the badger skins and all this came from the people and the people had to give [Applause] willingly so look at this now we watch sister hatti a little woman working on the hills and the church was doing some Renovations and she pledge $50 my my my my when the trustees heard that they said you can't do that you can't get $50 the Propet said that would be six months work of her working on those Hills to bring $50 they said give 20 you understand what going on there this is anointing unto burial now so you got to understand the season you in it requires your participation there not something you sit down and watch happen you had to be involved in it you had to walk with your sacrifice it's things that God revealing it's personal Revelations this is where your name calling now she had that thing home waiting Hallelujah for the right season now Jesus said but she point out on on Jesus's feet now foot is Ministry yes hallelujah how blessed upon the beautiful upon the mountain are the feet of those that bring the Good Tidings of Tidings of Peace So feet is Ministry feet is the foundation that's the head of every that's the starting point of everything everywhere we go our foot had to carry us hallelujah and this is where she anointed Hallelujah your foot wonderful you know when you watch the makeup of your foot you have part going down first so it going like this and then it coming how your foot just go when we walk in you have some fellas in front called the toes that is always be pointing up in prayer before almighty God they always up and then now when you your your heel hit the ground God had to put some dampers in your heel shock [Applause] absorbance that's right Hallelujah so they call it planter flat pads so it's pads that God have in your foot to absorb the Peril of the journey because that part down there serving the entire body so God is has certain members now in a congregation to Bear certain burdens and they sh absorbers things that the ministry going through they there they absorbing it but they needed for the ministry to go forward then you have some now like the toes in front they're always in prayer they're going forward first for the success of the ministry and now after now these fellas absorb the shock and it come down now flat yet the toes now God have now you see because is is your your your foot not flat like that there's an arch on your foot so that now there's a certain elasticity elasticity there that allows now for go you could have ah you have energy now that had to be dissipated it's like David slinging the sling it's energy inside every move he make the faster he go more energy Hallelujah so a man that running now if you you run you can't run flat foot is a motion yeah Hallelujah and inside there is you have contraction you have things that would be contract and then you have those that expanding and it's a whole nice motion that going on there that nobody seeing but he functioning and then you need a push now these fellas that was in front you now they become now the push to push you now to go forward prayer is important so those who were up in front pointing upwards now they come behind and they pushing you know to go forward so you have who was first become last in every step in every step who was pointing forward first they are the last one to leave the ground you have some people come to church they are the first to be here open up they pray they make sure everything in order and sometime when you look at them they are the last to leave you people like those are important for a Ministry to go your labors of love he wouldn't [Applause] forget amen hallelujah so the foot is something important God has stabilizers inside here now that is where when Mary was at Jesus's feet at that time those are the same feet that one day John saw it F brass that will judge the enemies the script they talk about he'll trample them the blood Hallelujah that's the same foot know what a privilege it was for her to be identified with those feet over there Hallelujah those are the same feet that will one day stand on the Mount of Zion when those feet stand there he will surely remember what she did down there for him [Applause] Hallelujah so now notice Jesus said coming down he said when she did this she did it unto my burial amen now Jesus's burial lasted just about two days Friday night Saturday he remained in the Tomb by Sunday morning he was up now for him to the scripture say when he understood it so there would be things happening God didn't show Jesus everything one time The Book of Revelation came after the resurrection so when he resurrected that Revelation was open unto him Adam didn't know he was inside of him brother but after God put him to sleep and God did an operation and took him up that struck him he said that is Bor of my bone Flesh of My it wasn't she was inside of him but it wasn't yet revealed amen so Jesus as in flesh there are things he didn't know all right so he said the day and the hour no man know it at that stage he didn't know save the Father in Heaven All right so at that stage when it was revealed Jesus watch it now he said wait now scriptures had to be fulfilled burial coming up when he came into the ministry he was anointed when he leaving the ministry he had to be anointed you see is when the thing look washed up it's then when God come to it Hallelujah and notice David said he anointed him in the presence of his enemies his C it over so you have all those Pharisees and all who are wrong and and Mary coming out with that ointment inside of there you watch for the prophet to go west where it came from sixth year dreams came from where among the body dreams from inside of the church Hallelujah a bunch of spirit filled people hallelujah brother Junior Jackson wasn't among them but you have dreams that came from putting it as he bright body de that could have given him the assurance and the inspiration to go forward so this thing is not about just come into church and get a nice message you got to be connected you had to be following something you walking with your sacrifice your amens help the minister what you do for the ministry it goes a long way your word of advice what you going through in your life brother it is those things will be Milestones Jesus said this thing here wherever the gospel is preached it will be a memorial of her so you see because where we at now is the bright coming of [Applause] Christ what he highlight is a bride he is here a memorial is a great thing you know when you look Memorial he say I am that name I am will be the memorial for all generations so when you hear Memorial is more things that God did when all you cross the Jordan 12 Stones that will be a memorial all right feast days blowing a trumpet's memorial take some Stones put it on the ephod of the the high priest your name is written there every time you going to the holies of holies you locked up there it's a memorial and in all those memorials in the scripture Jesus choose to take this thing here what this woman did as a memorial for all generation wherever this gospel is preached what she did brother will be mentioned Hallelujah that Memorial so you you have a part to play in your ministry Hallelujah God is what and and when you watch the prophet there he went and he connect with these angels uh it was something for the church and Jesus now that anointing there at that time was unto burial but we no longer at burial Mary Magdalene and the other Mary and different ones came with anointing later on they came with M and all these things to anoint the body of Jesus spices and he gone already so the thing that she did that was the time to do it so sometime you think no I wait we had the Dead first anoint to die they wait until they waited until that time that was a waste of money not what she did there you see so it's understanding the will of God for your life present tense when the spirit move on you it's then brother you had to give open up your BS Hallelujah Hallelujah so at that time she came to the Cornerstone but where we are now is Capstone in this Capstone time if there was a if there was a bride there at the Cornerstone to anoint him for that season there what about up here in The Headstone it must have a pride also there must be a Ministry also that willing to give up the all Hallelujah for the uniting of that headstone hallelujah [Applause] amen it's God taking us into something when that Mighty angel came down Hallelujah you see because what we we worshiping no man no man because if Mary came to Peter foot feet he would have run Jesus came to watch Peter he said no I Ain worthy Lord Peter know his position Cornelius went and he bow down because Cornelius prayers went up before God as a memorial and Cornelius came and he B down at Peter Peter's feet and Peter pull him up he said do that Paul and they they lift him up as Gods he said no we are men have like passions just like you all John fell on to worship the angel in Revelation he said no don't do that he said I am thy fellow servant so we are worshiping nor man nor man is of Glory all glory deserves goes to almighty God Hallelujah now watch we could receive little roses the prophet say I rather give you a rose while you're life than a rich when you're dead so some brother after the prophet message he said brother Grandma I appreciate that message and he very you know he compliment him and the prophet said TKS man watching say watch at you and the prophet said the only thing about it is that I truthful with it I glad for what he said you know so a little compliment here and there is we can take that but when it comes to worship we can't take that you see because it's not the man but it's the angel on the platform what open those scenes William brandom there was an angel that on that platform every night to open up that se so is it's something we coming into that headstone into that Capstone in this hour there is a bride that have what it takes you see because the two Ministries had to be alike so we not you see because Revelation 10 we closing we closing Revelation 10 when that Mighty angel came down that wasn't no seventh angel in Hallelujah that was the mighty angel that was Christ he came down clothing in a cloud little book open in his hand you see Mary's anointing was for the lamb that was going to be slain but now he's no longer lamb this El lion Hallelujah there is a Mary here tonight this morning Hallelujah now it's open book time he cried with a loud voice as when a lion Ro it when he cried seven Thunders after the voice and John was about to write he said no don't write it seal it up don't but he heard it so this Thunders is not to make books and write up seal it up there's Mysteries containing in that word that would be revealed brother in due time there are Mysteries outside we saw on the outside of the pyramid there were things up on seed and Holy Ghost without sensation and a lot of mysteries on the outside the prophet was interpreting but when you lift up that cap in the pyramid now and you going inside there now is things that light never shown on before those things now you got to be caught up here in the Capstone to get a revelation of what is inside of you all right Hallelujah so if the prophet had to be caught up don't you think that God want to take us up also to see things about our because the prophet inside of there saw his life he was going he was wondering could this be he was he didn't know what it was Hallelujah but then when he reached inside the book became a new book he said met the one with the seven seal he said the thing I wanted all my life it bring a certain finality and wrap up lucens in even in his [Music] life now notice here there are mysteries on the outside the Mysteries would be finished but The Voice verse 8 in Revelation 10 verse 8 The Voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me and said go now you John don't go to the seventh angel now but go up to the Angel that's right which standed upon the sea and upon the Earth dominion over all things Hallelujah you have the privilege to go up to him now when he CED do voice but you go to him you see the junction we yet God calling us into a personal walk with Christ and that's where the word taking us now because there's a Time coming where John he that book and he said thou must prophesy again there's a manifestation coming of this Bri and that was the final thing before the turn into Revelation 11 where go tribulation period to deal with the 144,000 the last thing before there thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and Kings how that coming GL Glory there must be a Mary again that feasting on things that the world don't know about the prophet said the S SE many people do even know s SE had to be revealed they don't know about it but there's a little bride that locked up in a little chamber that promised a meeting in a little room Hallelujah she's promised when you see that counil start to tighten up what you see manifest temporarily here will be manifested in the fullness of its power Hallelujah something that will manifest amongst that group The Prophet say we leap over all [Applause] new body is coming for us it's something coming for us it is already in motion Hallelujah you see if you wait for it then you miss what going on now because Mary didn't wait for till he died to anointed the Raptor is a revelation don't you know the Raptor is already in progress if you wait for Raptor morning you my Miss right now we being raptured right now we being caught up all this is part of your change all this is part of your change God billing you former and you're lattering you're teaching God putting instilling certain things inside of you getting the mechanics right and when the Dynamics St that Hallelujah off it goes Hallelujah Prophet said that that Dynamic no no is just our next refilling at this same Holy Spirit the same thing that we see working here God have it coming in a supernatural way at that Junction at that season to meet the crisis of the hour look at what going on in Israel time clock striking the hour Jesus will soon be here all right so it's perilous times so Wars you hear Wars rumors of War but the prophet Tau us keep your eyes watch Russia and then Israel is the time pce for the bright so brother I believe is a call now to come up take the book eat the book God have things locked up inside of there for us to bring about a change in our lives wonderful and brother we want to be caught up with that that that is your desire this morning don't miss your opportunity that time was the opport opportunity for Mary this morning may be your opportunity every service that come is an opportunity for you to be drawn closer to him he bringing you into he he want to cap the Pyramid of your life it's Christ [Applause] hallelujah it's Christ coming to bring a finality you see because at the end of all of this we realize it wasn't us it was him all alone who did this that call that you got there that strange feeling that there who was that it was Christ who brought you through all these things had you to connect with the headstone Tabernacle put you under a Ministry who did all that it was that same Christ and when we come to the reality in that day because when that comeing that which is in part will when the fullness come that which is in part will be done away with when you appears we shall be like him in his image in his likeness and when we come to that full you realize what it was him all alone it's Christ coming to cap your life belov the Lord Jesus this morning let's all stand [Applause] bying glory be to God in how we worship you we give you praise we give you thanks we give you all
