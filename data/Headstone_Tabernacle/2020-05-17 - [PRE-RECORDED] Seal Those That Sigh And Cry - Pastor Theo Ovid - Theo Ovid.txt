morning if I buy Bibles will enter into three portions scriptures and this morning Zechariah supper for wanna read from verse 1 to 7 Ezekiel chapter 9 you want to read from 1 to 6 and first Peter chapter 4 wanna read verse 17 to 18 a full speeders of the forum reading from zechariah zechariah after for 1 to 7 and the angel that talked with me came again and weak me as a manner is written out of his sleep he said unto me what she is now and I said I have looked I'm Huell a candlestick all of gold the bowl upon the top of it his seven lamps thereon 7 pipes to the seven lamps which upon the top thereof - olive trees by it and one upon the right side of the bowl the other on the left side of the pool lies so I answered and speak to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my lord then he answered and speaking to me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel see not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts who are the whole great mountain before the rubra beldo shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grease grease under it TCK chapter 9 and he cried also in mine ears with a lot voicing caused them that have charged over the city to draw near even every man with his destroyed weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lied towards the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clear with linen with a writer's inkhorn by his side and they went in and stood beside a brazen altar and the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the chair whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed linen which had the writers ink one by his side and the Lord said unto Him the Lord said unto him go to the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof unto the others he said in my hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spear neither Javie pity slay utterly all and young both maids a little children and woman but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they begin are the ancient men which were before the house or last scripture reading some first Peter chapter 4 verse 17 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and never just first begin at us what shall the end be of them that will be not the gospel of God and if the righteous scarcely be seen where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear let us pray father we thank you for your word and we thank you for the Scriptures been read and I and I pray you take me out of the way and circumcised the hearers of the word circumcise my own heart I mean your torch drop down Lord and speak lip to hear to your people even as your promise that the spirit and the bride will speak the spirit come upon the bride and speak the world and the world we hear direct from God may the believers hear hear direc from you this morning granted Lord in GSM I ask at a man you may be seated or praise the Lord don't know how many of you have heard Wednesday night service if you have no good Wednesday night service go back and listen to it and I know it was something that the Lord give and I believe it will bless you the angel from the east having the seal of the Living God this is not more brother and special minister or bishop or whatever it is this is the Holy Spirit God's even angel so this morning of an inspiration of two scriptures sort of context scriptures there's some acts 19 I want to read it and he came to pass that while Apollo's was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper coast came to Ephesus and finance it and disciples he said unto them have ye received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said unto Him we have not understood whether there be any all he goes so this was a new ting all together they haven't heard about this thing called Holy Ghost and when he said unto them unto what will you baptize this another John baptism and he's then paul said john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance similar to the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is done Christ Jesus when they it is they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his hands upon them here we go the Holy Ghost came on them and they speak with tongues and prophesied so this Holy Ghost not a imaginary thing it could come on you it could come into you it could fill you Oprah do believe that it's not a explainin ting explain you have it already and no no no we not explain all of that this is what he will say so Amanda Paul laid his hands upon them I went poorly as hell upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they speak with tongues and prophesied by the other scripture I have is Matthew 5:6 from in the scripture blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled not educated not in form not to bring at a booth they shall be filled those who hunger in and to stand after righteousness so the title this morning is seal dosed at Sian cry that's the title dis morning seal those that sigh and cry you know Jesus said as one of these a sudden man switch B come in and they eat they drank they bought the soul and different things like that normal livin different nothing look this up them that happen no they eat the drunk is soul but luck was luck was called out and when luck came out fire fell so you can wash disguise and you can watch the Sun any moon and you can't watch or the grass growing and and corn barren and you're getting fruit and some on harvests it can't just watch that if doors you will you have to focus on what God said and then you could get clarity or what I stopped think this is please it didn't get you it tuned into you know oh praise that do you believe that or praise the name of the Lord but Abraham we've seen newspapers the uncommon storm when you go home tonight do me one favor don't go to bed till I read revelation it chapter you would see the uncommon plagues and storms that is to hit the earth and thunders and lightnings are gonna shake the heavens wars are going to pass over the nation man will rot in their flesh disease ever strike them that the doctors knows nothing about but remember before that took place there was a ceiling when thought not Titian Ceylon the Death Angel and the plagues was commissioned by God don't come near any of those who was the seal in their forehead and the seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is not join in churches not who your pastor is is not what church ago to the scene of God is the baptism of the Holy Spirit Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption so no matter how hard the a crock no matter how many times the lightning struck close to it ten thousands are falling you're right and thousands the on your left but it shall not come nigh D the Holy Spirit we believe that shall not come nigh thee Amen or glory to God so when I'm and get lost he will do anything when a man get lost prophet described man get lost in the forest they will mix occurs and they would be scrambling because you can't find your we lost a man lost from God he will do anything hallelujah when you lost you need a guide somebody to guide you out of your lost condition you can find your way back out that's why I see paths to be led Oh glory to God a sheep have to be led they gonna have Shepherd they have direct sheep and a guy has the understanding how to go on what to do and God has always sent a guy to his people God has never failed he sends a guide but you got to accept that guide all glory that God sends us a guide to guide us we have got to follow that guy no matter what we think what looks reasonable and what looks ridiculous we are not subject to divide and that the God is the only one I think some time ago as a Christian a message about a guy in Africa and the people are lost sitting and he said I'm the honey man cuttin grass and they following him they say but horn only way he said I am the way that's him and territory the man nor the bush inside out so he know I was going the man who follow him don't know where he's going and looking like there's more bushes scenery cut any cutting he cut any whoa who are you no way no way I I am the well you just have to follow me and you will get out your condition that you're in because we're every situation is away so every situation is a mind of God your situation is not unknown to God before you got in it God saw it and if God saw it there must be a way out of it because he don't ever give you more than you can hear if you feel you under pressure you will see nothing yet you may be seated we began frighten saying that you know if you figure you under pressure no you se nothing yet pressure is yet to come pressure going to wreck the world pressure gonna rock nations governments find the mrs. right no pressure rock in China or glory they got every day the content that numbers ability a closer look at the virus and so on every day is special you know it's challenging kingdoms and and put intense as all the super power and super board is what are they just drop let the angel come and just drop it like that rains god you're playing super power you playing your powerful God to bring it down to zero or give the Lord a shout glory to God hallelujah I am God and I changed not we go to prove who here or Chloe Daniel saw a vision ahead of coal and all the other structures coming right down to iron and clay and he said I Daniel saw a spoon cut out without the hands of men go and shut the image and that image came tumbling down man's kingdom must fall and we ever see this one in Parliament's fallen Babylon has fallen confusion is fallen we are not confused or glory of God we are not confused we know where we are going Jesus is the way he said I am the way around the truth I am the life Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah ministers and confusion cash and confusion messes in the confusion but the bride will not be confused because God sent us a guide Oh glory to God hallelujah glory look gorgeous continue hallelujah so you have to follow the guy no man I was ridiculous God in the Old Testaments and prophets the will guides because the word of the Lord comes to the prophets aha so that Kyle is a prophet right and the cat is also the Holy Spirit man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of these guys so go ahead guys through all the ages Oh glory to God the word come directly to them not the word of the Lord come to this one and that one the word Allah comes to the prophet and men under that prophet speak back that same word or glory that God because God sent one guy to the age who no guide or give the Lord a shout one guide not a guy and a half not a guide and his son one guy one message one message a mother in you this morning not trian format one message it has endless interpretations but there's only one message even as there is one Lord even as there is one fit even as there is one per person or give the Lord a show [Applause] halleluyah halleluyah hello million on a small if I guy doorguy Julia seven stars in his right hand seven men seven eyes and those eyes look to the ages and each generation they don't have to be here to see what they see to speak and what they speak is a put it in a book write it but you could read it that you could run in your generation or glory the war when Daniel was watching the prophecy written by Terry mad a prophet and so the time was at him he's I Daniel but by books he's sort of the time as I've handed for something to break thought are you really your books do you understand what is at hand or I'm gonna sit there as if nothing has happened Oh glory to God hallelujah you can't do that too late for that Oh glory to God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus let's continue go to your Testament send prophets they were guides because the word of the Lord come to the prophets they were guides now people stop reading the prophet will turn listening they just listen to preacher listening to this one but this is the prophet that so you know you know is the wood of promises I committed to excite Santelli I dream and tell you on Time magazine and tell you what Putin doing and what China doing and and all that you could read that too you don't meet the company honey and explain it you're gonna need papers and you're gonna internet them and see what they do it but but but but but but you see this year this is dusty at the Lord [Applause] sometimes they can say what I do and you're not even doing that but you see they say but I like when you're here from this year you came to see the Lord I can't bring up my feelings my feelings could lie I can't bring you my dream my dream to be alive but this is no lying I could make mistakes I could be off and wrong but this can't be wrong heaven I will pass away but this one will never pass away your ferritin lighter your husband tonight here but God will not lightly [Applause] [Music] let's continue they were guides profits the instructor the people as we had last night of eyes I use a they were instructed and they instructed the people and guided them and know God has always sent his guys he always never been without a guide all truly ages God always had somebody that represent him on the earth in all ages and sometimes when they get off the guide or off the beam as we would call it when Jesus was young good do you remember jesus said to the Pharisees you blind guides you blind guides blind to spiritual things they were supposed to be guys guides to the people guiding the people to salvation but Jesus a you find he said let them alone for if the blind lead the blind brutal fall in the ditch plain guys how the world has been contaminated with that blind Gaiden and gorse and a prophet in this nighttime to bring light that we would be stumbling our steps once your any ain't and they get in trouble and you come back up a spoke one book or spoken word tape you'll know you hear just hear the Lord other than that it was gonna be in your Baptist Church it was gonna be in the Catholic Church and your only can church but God pull y'all to that to bring light to you like that your church but you come on up did not have so you can go that one thing you have to know you can go back every day has to be one step closer every day has to be one step less okay the Lord has show one step closer God sends a guide and God want you to remember that he's a pointed guy we must remember him here it says Jesus said I will not leave you comfortless but I pray the Father he will send you another comforter and this comforter when he was to come was the guide us to all truth and the Word of God is the truth and the word is Christ I'm the way the truth and the life he is the world is not right and when the churches did they reject how can we ever expect to go to heaven when the Holy Spirit was sent to us for a guide we will take some cadena some bishop some general overseer or somebody like that to guide us they only fight for who for at our faithful in the body and 500 to anybody if I fall in the body are men who are baptized by the Holy Ghost and placed inside are they're the ones who who have I'm sorry buddy they're just men with gifts but no power and the Holy Spirit always speak the word I've got many things to tell you you can understand it now but when he comes he will guide you to it and there is where he brought this coat that's the reason the common of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God shall be finished to know who God is what he is his nature his being you supposed to be all the way up there by that time oh my inter bring us into the full stature of sons and daughters of God a church has washed in the blood of Jesus Christ bought without money paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ oh my hallelujah the guide knows the way he knows every inch of the way he knows every tortoise in your heart he knows everybody that is here he knows who you are what you have done all about you he is God's guide the Holy Spirit and revealed things to you and will tell you things that he heard he can repeat your words write back and say what you said tell you where you have been what you've God what your greater going all glory to God your car the clothes on that guy that guy to tell you your entire life well Gloria I've got what you have done and what you want to do what you're doing now the Holy Spirit will never make you say amen to some kind of man-made Creed it will only punctuate the Word of God with an e Men because the Holy Spirit will not lead you any other way Oh glory to God so you could only confirm the word when you hear the word your spirit your heart you say Amen so you see you need a guide he will guide you to truth and the truth is the world and it always has been God has never had to change nothing but his infinite and he knows what's best he is omnipresent he's omniscient he's God is not right and the Holy Ghost the guide is the confirma of the word that he is teaching so if the Holy Spirit is teaching he confirms the word that he is teaching this he doesn't confirm it then something wrong with it but he's the consumer of the word he is teaching or glory to God and Luke said Luke was led by the guy to say go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and please sign shall follow them that believe what was it signs following what was it the guide vindicated that was to the truth that was gotcha policy that's the Whitley down that's his program it can change them it because he's infinite he can't change from it he is God I can't I can change I'm a man you can change your man a woman but God cannot change I am finite I can make mistakes and say things that is wrong the whole that is how did that compare to all these ministers with more mistakes are made like if they absolute how does this you know what a prophecy you know I am finite I can make mistakes and see things that are wrong no it's easy if you're saying that I wrong we come back and say we're sorry we said the wrong thing if we do something wrong with wrong wrong can be right wrong is wrong one minute says that infinite and absolute suddenly make some big goons and bigotes he's just a man or give the Lord a shout yellow Solomon yellow angel man he's just a man okay the Lord Ashok [Applause] we just make big mistakes somebody taught attainment see the wrong thing treat people in different and so on like that but we grew in how much time you hear me telling you tell you are waiting for the love the smooth me out my time I tell you that we can meet in a certain way and a car handle too much extra penis I can handle too much as Japanese and as comfortably enough is enough that's enough and I will fight that back

handle brotherly kindness and the say me message and the sale interrupted interrupted by that no Raptor winner before the mother brings out the child that's sweet anointing has to come over the mother and that sweet anointing is that brotherly love that's how I know you're about to be born that's how I know you're about to get a breakthrough you will feel a different atmosphere along your life because you're supposed to be pregnant with God [Music] underneath and God after comfort there has to be the spirit of forgiveness because faith to get what you need miss unforgiveness [Music] God is not going to leave it because you're feeling the guy here I see it again God is not going to heal you because you feel him to get you going to heal you because of your faith the one where the bloody shoe mr. Don a minute I don't know why I'm going here I'm here she was not baptized believer she actually earring she keeping the toes sassy ban wrong she foot she has a normal woman with the blood issue but she told herself she care for this man from Galilee GA Bor this little young Messiah this rabbi and people being healed she told us if I could just touch the hem of His garment and a physical condition at that time she not even supposed to go near a man to touch him but she said she's that I'm gonna touch the hem of his so she knows she's bleedin she knows she's not supposed to go near there but she come because she had a need and she decides to press so called press that's what people are not doing enough percent you're staying in a condition but you're not pressing this woman know how money was running out maybe you are too much of money you don't want to be ammonia to run out you go when your money is broken a thing you know oh yeah well nobody is next step because you have in money when the money ran out stay allowed to well her money ran out and she tell us that this is it this is it this is it and when she came to the meetin the press was around Jesus I wanna suppress crowd kick she had a choice today is no my dears I Green back home the same way I came same way I came I going but because maybe next week might have a smaller service and I could get access to Jesus a little better not that woman she came determined it was already in our mind it was ready in our heart she had an attitude some big guys wrong the periphery of this whole struggling Jesus she said excuse me the money move she pushy I'm being pushing man wasn't moving on him focus on Jesus so he preached she push him she gets you this one she judged if I get you down that little Adam and he's smaller than that one cause you push through a big man she pushed again Oh glory to God maybe she had a handbag maybe she saw she hand back to some legging she's excuse me my handbag she push it she has to get nearer maybe she do that she four times when she can see back she choice I get me shake this thing working just joy to the leg I say excuse saving handbag and keep moving forward she's getting nearer someone I met on the leaf some of them just come to here they have no intention of being changed but she want a transformation she want a miracle she want a healing and she told herself not if I hear him but if I touch the hem of His garment so she is saying after get right up and touch when she reach them and she touch him so she just you know put Jesus said who touched my clothes [Applause] did you get that immediately yeah what we for China and Africa were preaching already be careful to the edge preacher neighbors wouldn't sometimes feel scary so I preach another hour make sure I get too close there cuz I'm gonna grab your foot but when that woman touched him Jesus said who touch my clothes Peter said it was true that cinnamon thing he said but no offense but you somebody made a withdraw something leave the bank some money leads the bank somebody made a withdrawal he began to look around for who who may have a job then he saw the woman is you as here as you as you Isuzu then then he didn't say he didn't say my virtue he'll do you know he said your faith come on now come on give the Lord herself he did not say my virtue heal you he say your faith because that fear to pull down and withdraw the virtual look where theaters after faith is what I'll give the Lord a shout hallelujah so once the comfort you can pull down virtue or glory give the Lord a shout and if we can get virtually you can get knowledge you can get temperance you can get patience you forget colonists you could get brotherly kindness hallelujah understand [Music] [Applause] ah blu-ray [Applause] [Music] what do you think what do you think your heart ought to be to him back to faithful to pull along this this capstone never see we right that is wrong but the cup of perfection which is the power of love after come seal the brand up up here diamonds is a long long time my voice hasn't gone like this but let me just continue here right now this water was stopped listen to what went on at a deeper level we know what whoooo one lemon towel and and so on but at a deeper level 1933 God gave but at random seven visions which he said must come to pass before Jesus coming in the seventh vision is when America was bombed up we're not even sure America making the Tribulation Period bombs all over America America destroyed listen to what he said the he said the world went to war 1914 never been pissed peace since constantly swinging and swinging and swinging and they are doing it the very same thing yet and what was good doing talking about the Angels more length he said Oh God have mercy hold him that great thing that I saw in the vision the whole thing becomes a destruction wall in the atomic hole in the wars that they don't destroy themselves until the thing come to destroy it until is returns back and gets herself with together and then the message will go to Israel and she'll be sealed with the seal of the Holy Ghost after the Gentiles is called out the people for his name's sake will be called out which is this age right here now then Israel only receives a tree and a half and six-month message so Israel only and a half years left for a message with Moses Elijah those two lamps those two standing by the lamps those two trees it's not right Moses and Elijah just read a half years for them the Gentiles you and I it is called the times of the Gentiles it is called until the fullness of the come in we have no specific time the Bible talk about we call it the times of the Gentiles until the fullness of the Gentiles come in so in other words once this come in and the seal of God begin to be applied to your heart and life it is over this book is then closed so you don't have all the time to mix that because the slaughter in angel is next after the ink one writer went forth first with a commission to put a mark upon those hallelujah not upon those who say in the message not upon doors going to church doors have certain characteristics that tsiyon cry that means the burden go and beyond you it can be selfish for this thing you you see what is happening you know you need a manifestation of God you needed fire you're living a life without prayer you're ready for no revival yet when you begin to pray you know if I will come in when you begin to pray you know power comment when you bring and obey your healing coming you can't live without prayer let prayer become your life you have no job did job coming because you're praying you want to increase in pay you increase coming because you're praying seek first the kingdom and all other things will be added rich you will be added deliverance will be added more money will be added you want more ties or my host what I've planted after give [Music] [Applause] listen let's continue Elijah and Moses returned on preach to the Jews two men anointed with that spirit isn't that right and then about a third of the earth was blown to bits at that time until it of the earth Sheba listen for these foolish virgins if that man with the ink one writer was the Holy Ghost we realize everybody reads the Bible so is the same angel coming again with the Holy Ghost the last enemy the last plague that struck the earth was dead and the last enemy that's gonna strike the church snow is dead strike the what judge dead spiritually speaking those who will not follow Christ and the baptism of the Holy Spirit will spiritually dry up and die the churches you can see it now oh my you say are you a Christian that's worse you see I'm a Methodist and you're Christian I'm a Pentecostal that don't mean more no more has been a big or hug or horse that has nothing to do with it let's say it this way are you a Christian I'm in a message are you a Christian i fellowship in my brother over that is same thing I are Christian I belong to this Tabernacle in any question are you a Christian well my father is a pastor and the pastor son it's quiet in here that's good I want you to think because you have to answer the question are you a Christian yeah it is bad you are you are you a Christian when you are born again and filled with the Holy Ghost not until that but I start all and you are yielded completely to the spirit that's not all if you are not yielded to the spirit then you're not born again and you don't have the Holy Ghost you might speak with tongues and Shiva and jump and run ball said I can move mountains with faith I can heal the sick have knowledge of the Bible I can do a seminarian all this stuff and I'm nothing yet so he said I'm an character fulfilled in this message and still nothing you have no love you have not charity I'm a kind of a big ministry revealing mysteries from heaven from below from on top from beside from everywhere else in the book OD book and still nothing he cannot immeasurably thunders device he sees he was the one at his son the trumpets the millennium the new city before the beginning where happily God not even he could bring like a picture like I see like a movie I'm still nothing that's still on the knowledge so this is a little more than all of that that we have to press forward for and he gives a description of how charity would charity suffereth long and is kind is not puffed up it's not easily provoked beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things and joy and all things they asked what a random but a brand why is you go among their people and you know what they believe he said knowledge to know what they believe I don't know it is in the heart temperance with them patience hoping someday to see a new light for the light Oh hallelujah so he is showing these virtues has operated in him to go among people not like him don't believe like him don't agree with him he could still go Jesus will invited the cyma knows everybody come into those houses get get a foot wash because that a donkey Missoni groan and you know do it and Dustin what not everybody getting treated right perfumes [Music] Cologne good foot wash nice robe they let tears come in normal normal normal Jesus for 30 his foot smelling dirty smelly and then there's I don't know big coach and chair is grounding so he would stick up in here for the embarrassment and God want to bust in guys God want to bust and bishops damn faithful and that they were too so everybody they drink a nice and they eat a nice and it's dependent bread and it's done what another thing like that a woman out said she got had Horace because she see Jesus with dirty feet and she getting a Horace because she know that that man have something more than them other fellas with a nice Gong and the clean foot and the well polished shoes she know that guy has something more than that and she pulled with her own sins but she got a burden for him with that dirty feet I when she said I remember how bad she behaved at how she left she started crying and she moved and went past the bunks the bunks are even with watch when she slept she made a little more to become nice little pass him McHale move around him I should go on much easier said a cry and she's had a cry and thicker here and had a wipe his feet on watch his feet GSS say nothing and Simon I'm sa not but they thinkin something so they're saying it but they thinking it the thinking if that man only knew the kinda woman that did he wouldn't let her do that go right now we tape in it or we go put it on Facebook we could let you all know what going on with that man and that woman and Jesus just s see nothing and when she finished and sometimes God let you go to stuff and don't say a word but when you're finished he's going to break the silence over your life don't be afraid because he is silent don't be afraid to service for Jesus to service for the Lord music come please listen Simon have a word for you I come in here nobody wash my feet I didn't ask to come you invited me to come this is how you treat me this woman who sends a mess you heard that she she she oh she was forgive me enough when a woman here that all that it's time to tell everybody you know I am forgiven I am free I am free I am free it's time for you to get free free from your past free from your sins free from your fears Oh glory to God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah glory thank you lord what go to the rule to zalem and seal don't seal any of them but then that tsiyon cry for the abominations that done the city how God was celiac IV listen a husband and you in church and you hear in the word you expect what to seeing you you have no scenes again you're rude ya want to answer back on and course all kind of confusion oh well we'll see later you gossip in God could Selah the backbiting go could Selah the jealous God could see let God can see that yes I see a so loose Island grand oh my hallelujah you say I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist so what difference does that make I'm in the message this is same thing he said not that constant burden for the loss he said that sweetness don't never let anything rise up and put bitterness in your soul no matter how bad anybody ever treats you or anything don't never throw be guilty of letting nothing anchor in your soul it will grieve the Holy Spirit away from you so what are long people the sittings beatings yeah and whatever it is he allow them he's not destined amethyst in you don't let that tanker your soul you want to be available to the spirit you want to be available to fate or glory to God hallelujah glory to God amen praise God just wanna get one spot here when God spoke and made man man saw was lost anything outside of that join in church is high Breeden God's got to speak that word back again that makes it likely to know and when God speaks life into you then that's eternal again and when God speaks here we go and places the Holy Spirit in there and sees it it's eternal oh my so when God's check the boxcar which is the busca of your life he found it in anything loose inside idea and when there's nothing shaking inside idea you are then sealed until the day of redemption he said God come along to find a lot of foolishness in us he just don't see it yet he sees a lot of unbelief he just don't steal it yet Oh glory to God so here we go and one the church itself when it strikes the power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost out of denominational churches he's talking with us now out of the Catholic Church otama in the message now wherever it is when the baptism of the Holy Ghost is made real to the people when them that are predestinated like you people here they tell you life ceases and walks on it it's a super sign it has to be made real to you you mean this Holy Ghost yes for you to be baptized with the Holy Ghost yes you're not contented just to be the message no you want the real thing Oh glory to God and he promised we know that the scripture say that Jesus is the chief Cornerstone he also has a headstone now if we will remember that the 70s Messenger was to restore the faith of the churun back to the father's in other words rebuild it again under the power of the Spirit Oh glory to God I wanna my give there are some prizes [Applause] whoo I know I jump in just listen to this know in this rupture in time there will come a time know that this bride will that rejects the head part of the bride so it should be this church that rejects the head part of the bride will have to suffer for her rejection because the gospel wasn't made plain to them back there it's Miriam to you today see it was made plain you done all these years and examples the season so he's saying there will come a time when the head part will be rejected and the people that reject the head part will have to suffer fear the head part is the headstone the best part is the capstone the head part is a dynamics Jesus is the cornerstone he is also the headstone and he was a cornerstone of what the early church our church he comes to keep off the breath so therefore you have to grow into the pyramid that you're pretty maybe capped off you yourself has to become a pyramid and he come into the cap to your pyramid the individual pyramid so you have a promise of him coming to you or glory that God quickly now after the baddest rap that is a question answers will any of the foolish women be same or will they all be lost he said will the fully be saved no whatever happens no after that time she she fully version will have to go to the Tribulation Period and the reason for it is because she has rejected the atonement in its fullness and I was they believe pastor the message not all the message or glory d'accord what she is a believer a professed believer but she will have to go through the tribulation period so you don't want to be a professor believer you want to be a believer with the proof possession not a believer with the profession did you get that you want to be a believer with the possession you actually have a possession not a profession Oh glory to God hallelujah my god here we go and is abomino clues when the spirit falls not if Saul told whether that mean it comin nobody can stop it if I die it's still coming all glory to God is this just fall apart and blow up it's still coming nothing gonna stop this when the spirit falls there will become a move amongst the people the bride had another revival yet there have been no manifestation of God to stir the bride he will send it he promised it the spirit will fall and cause a move among the people them denominations will swing together as certain as I am standing in the pulpit and the Church of God will be on stood they will make such a racket on kill they will Confederated I put a boycott on anybody that don't belong to them when Lazarus was raised from the dead you know what they say we have to stop this man the whole world going after him the miracles be from the small ones right dr. Lazarus raised from the dead but that was the capstone manifestation of Jesus ministry which was a resurrection and everybody knew that Lazarus was raised from the dead that is when the Pharisees and the scribes and the Sadducees came together and formed this hydrant Council to stop the Word made flesh Oh glory to God in that same they're gonna happen when the Holy Spirit falls and the sons of God come into manifestation or glory record the church people in the message will reject the bright people in the message and then the government will come and sit go wrong it or glory no God remember remember is not Caesar that condemned Jesus hello what's the church folks that brought Jesus Jesus a Caesar and when they said this is your king to say no we have no king but Caesar they went political also or give the Lord a shout Oh hallelujah the religious folks condemned Jesus which was the word made manifest and what did the Prophet said I'm gonna close this then the phone fault with the man who was the word nor they're gonna find fault but the word working to the man Oh glory to God so the prophecy hanging over your life is this word that you hear in all these years the secret is
