[47:33] Hallelujah. Oh, what an atmosphere this
[47:37] morning. We feel the power of God. We
[47:41] feel the presence of God in this place.
[47:44] All we want to do is cast down our
[47:47] crowns and worship
[47:49] him. Worship Christ our Lord. Oh,
[47:55] hallelujah. How many thankful this
[47:57] morning? How many grateful
[48:00] today? He brought me through too much
[48:03] for me not to praise him this morning.
[48:06] When I look back, it was all Jesus. And
[48:10] that's the reason I praise him this
[48:12] morning. Oh, hallelujah.
[48:15] Hallelujah. Oh, glory, glory, glory.
[48:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[48:23] Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. Well,
[48:27] you feel good this morning. Amen. It

[48:33] God's praises in the house of the Lord.
[48:35] Amen. I know you brought your praise
[48:37] with you. There's an atmosphere in the
[48:39] house of the Lord this morning. Amen.
[48:41] Praise God. The people are bringing
[48:43] their revival with them.
[48:45] Amen. Praise God. Certainly appreciate
[48:48] Brother Steven in the song service this
[48:50] morning. Appreciate the Lord. Thank you
[48:53] so much musicians.
[48:55] Amen. Thank you
[48:58] worshippers for taking up your position
[49:00] this morning. And uh we feel God's
[49:03] presence. We're so thankful. Amen. So as
[49:05] you switch over now to the word portion
[49:08] of the service. Um I'd like to invite
[49:10] your attention to the reading of the
[49:12] word. And we just have two small
[49:14] portions of scriptures we'd like to uh
[49:18] indulge in this morning.
[49:20] So I have St. John chapter 4 and I also
[49:24] have Revelation chapter 19 and verse 10.
[49:27] Amen. For scripture
[49:29] reading.
[49:36] Amen. Amen. Welcome one and all one more
[49:38] time. God bless you. It's a privilege to
[49:41] be in his house this morning. St. John
[49:44] chapter 4. Uh we'd like to read from two
[49:47] verses there.
[49:50] St. John
[49:51] 4:23 says, "But the hour cometh, and now
[49:55] is, when the true worshippers shall
[49:58] worship the Father in spirit and in
[50:01] truth. For the Father seeketh such to
[50:05] worship him. God is a spirit, and they
[50:09] that worship him must worship him in
[50:12] spirit and in truth." Amen. And turning
[50:15] over now to Revelation chapter
[50:17] 19, one verse there, verse
[50:22] 10. Right? And it says, "And I fell at
[50:25] his feet to worship him. And he said
[50:28] unto me, see thou doeth not. I am of thy
[50:32] fellow servant and of thy brethren that
[50:35] have the testimony of Jesus. Worship
[50:38] God. For the testimony of Jesus is the
[50:42] spirit of prophecy." Amen. May God add
[50:45] blessing to the reading of his word. Let
[50:48] us bow our
[50:49] heads. Dear God, we are thankful this
[50:51] morning Lord
[50:53] for Lord breath Lord for sunshine. We're
[50:57] thankful for this new day that you have
[50:58] given us Lord. This is the day that you
[51:02] have made and we will rejoice and be
[51:05] glad in it this morning. We come to
[51:07] praise you and worship you this morning
[51:09] and thank you for your goodness. Lord,
[51:11] we come now to the word portion of the
[51:14] service. Lord, we pray that your spirit
[51:16] would come in a special way, Lord, and
[51:19] sweep over our souls. Uh we are needy
[51:23] people this morning. Uh we need your
[51:26] presence, Lord. We need your spirit to
[51:29] go with us, Lord. Uh we can't do it
[51:32] alone. So, Father, we recognize how
[51:34] little we are. Lord, we just pray that
[51:36] your presence would come and may you,
[51:39] Lord, bring understanding to the word,
[51:41] Lord, that your people might be able to
[51:44] enter in this morning, uh, and begin to
[51:47] be uplifted by it, Lord Jesus, uh, by
[51:50] the work of the word in their hearts and
[51:51] lives this morning, dear God. Bless your
[51:54] people, Lord, as we, as we look to you
[51:56] now, uh, for you to, uh, bless the
[51:59] scriptures in your own sweet way. May
[52:01] your presence come and confirm your word
[52:02] with signs, wonders, and miracles. take
[52:04] me out of the way this out of the way
[52:06] this morning and uh uh have your way in
[52:08] the presence of God here among these
[52:10] people. Lord, may you just uh minister
[52:13] in your own way this morning. We pray
[52:14] and ask it in Jesus Christ's precious
[52:17] name. Amen. And amen. You may have your
[52:20] seats. Praise God.
[52:30] Amen.
[52:32] Well, it's good to be in his presence
[52:35] and we thank God to be here this
[52:36] morning. Amen.
[52:39] So, I have a title this morning
[52:42] uh for little service
[52:45] today. It is called True
[52:48] Worship by Revelation.
[52:52] True
[52:53] worship by Revelation.
[52:57] And
[52:58] um I've really been inspired by what God
[53:01] has been sharing with us and revealing
[53:04] to us throughout these past services.
[53:06] And we feel like God wants to take us on
[53:09] a level higher.
[53:11] And um so my core intent this morning is
[53:16] to talk about worship
[53:19] because I believe God wants to release
[53:21] power upon the church in the last day.
[53:24] And worship is going to precede the
[53:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost. So if you're
[53:29] looking for the Holy Ghost this morning,
[53:32] we have to get into a kind of a worship
[53:35] that God could receive so that his
[53:38] spirit could come down because it can't
[53:40] come down on dry. We've got to create an
[53:43] atmosphere for the Holy Spirit to come
[53:46] and dwell among us and do the things
[53:49] that he promised to do among his people
[53:52] in the last days. So my objective of
[53:56] this message today, I like to start with
[53:57] my objective so we know where we're
[54:00] going. The objective of our message
[54:03] today is to show the connection between
[54:05] worship and
[54:08] revelation. We want to explore this this
[54:11] connection
[54:12] uh between worship and revelation.
[54:16] Uh because without divine
[54:18] revelation then our worship is turned
[54:21] away.
[54:22] It's turned away from the original
[54:24] objective of God which is the true
[54:27] object of worship which is supposed to
[54:28] be God. Uh but if we don't have a true
[54:32] revelation then we are worshiping
[54:35] something else. Amen. If we don't have a
[54:38] true interpretation or understanding of
[54:40] what we are doing, then it it skews our
[54:44] worship and it turns it into something
[54:48] else. Uh that's why Jesus said in vain
[54:52] but in vain do they worship me. Teaching
[54:55] for doctrines the commandments of men.
[54:58] In other words, when the true revelation
[55:00] of the word of God is replaced by some
[55:04] other interpretation of God's word, it
[55:07] points our worship in the wrong
[55:09] direction.
[55:12] Amen.
[55:14] And that's why God's word doesn't need
[55:16] an interpretation.
[55:18] He is his own interpreter
[55:21] and he will interpret his own word. Uh
[55:24] because most of the time if all of the
[55:27] time I should say when we get into the
[55:30] middle we try to interpret God's word it
[55:33] always gets messed up. That's right. Uh
[55:36] because we ourselves are messed up and
[55:37] we are filtering God's word through our
[55:40] own ideas and our own opinions through
[55:43] our messy selves. But when we get a
[55:46] divine interpretation, hallelujah, when
[55:49] we get a clear truth from God, then that
[55:53] we can worship on that. Hallelujah. Then
[55:56] it's what we do next comes out of a
[55:59] genuine understanding of what God has
[56:02] shown to us. What God has revealed to
[56:05] us. Isn't that right? And in every age,
[56:08] God has revealed something that helps
[56:11] point God's people towards the truth.
[56:14] And it points their worship in the right
[56:16] direction. Isn't that right? And we
[56:18] believe today that God has revealed the
[56:21] truth through a prophet that helps point
[56:24] our worship this morning in the right
[56:27] direction. Oh, we know who we worship.
[56:30] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. And Yahweh
[56:32] come now is when the true worshippers
[56:36] will worship the father in spirit and in
[56:40] truth. Isn't that right? And this was
[56:43] the whole battle in the beginning. We
[56:45] always talk about in the beginning when
[56:47] God created the angels and everything
[56:50] else that was there, the devil was there
[56:53] also. And he had an issue with this
[56:57] worship thing. He wanted the worship for
[57:00] himself. He wanted to be worshiped. He
[57:04] wanted to be exalted just like God was
[57:07] exalted. But he couldn't just randomly
[57:10] make people worship him. He couldn't
[57:13] just randomly force them to worship him.
[57:16] So the first thing he had to do was to
[57:18] attack the word. The first thing he had
[57:21] to do was to attack the true
[57:23] interpretation of God so that he could
[57:26] point the worship in a different
[57:28] direction because all of the worship was
[57:31] going to God. And so in order to affect
[57:34] that, he had to affect the word first.
[57:37] He had to affect the truess of what was
[57:39] taking place first. And then when that
[57:42] got misconstrued, then he was now able
[57:44] to move the worship in the direction or
[57:47] bend it to his will uh and point it
[57:50] obviously to himself. Because if you're
[57:53] not worshiping God, then you're
[57:55] worshiping something else. If you're not
[57:58] worshiping the Jehovah, the the the one,
[58:01] the creator, then you're worshiping
[58:03] something else. Maybe you're worshiping
[58:05] his creation and not the creator. Let's
[58:08] get back to the creator this morning.
[58:11] Let's get back to the giftgiver this
[58:13] morning. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[58:15] Because he's the one
[58:18] uh under whose divine will we are
[58:20] following. Isn't that right? So, he
[58:22] wanted to worship. He wanted the worship
[58:25] and the only way to get it was to attack
[58:27] the word. So, when he attacked it, it
[58:30] turns the worship away from God. That's
[58:33] right. And it turn it towards the
[58:35] interpret the new interpretation. That's
[58:37] right. Or or or the person who's giving
[58:39] the new interpretation, which of course
[58:42] in this uh scenario was the devil. But
[58:45] Michael fought and the dragon fought.
[58:48] Amen. It was his interpretation versus
[58:50] the true interpretation. And guess who
[58:53] won? The true interpretation won. And we
[58:56] kicked the devil out of heaven. Amen.
[59:00] Amen. And he fell as lightning upon the
[59:02] earth. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[59:04] Hallelujah. So we worship God this
[59:06] morning because our names are written in
[59:09] heaven because our names are written up
[59:11] there and we did not receive the devil's
[59:14] lie
[59:16] but we received the truth. We stood with
[59:19] the truth. We resisted the devil and we
[59:23] withtood amen the forces of evil. Amen.
[59:25] Brother Gideon. Amen. Just Wednesday
[59:28] night, he was talking about uh uh stand
[59:30] and withstand.
[59:32] And when you have a true revelation, the
[59:35] gates of hell may come against it, but
[59:38] it will never prevail. It gives you the
[59:40] power to withstand the attack of the
[59:44] enemy on any ground he comes upon. You
[59:48] are clothed with the word of God. Amen.
[59:51] Hallelujah. Clothed with the armor of
[59:53] God. Hallelujah. Isn't that right? So,
[59:56] we want to talk about worship this
[59:59] morning. So, this is just a gentle
[1:00:01] reminder to you. Nothing we're going to
[1:00:03] say this morning is is new or or or
[1:00:06] something like uh you know like a brand
[1:00:09] new thing. Yeah. These are things we
[1:00:11] know already. But I pray that God would
[1:00:14] make it a fresh to you this morning that
[1:00:17] uh we understand why we come in here.
[1:00:20] Because the devil is on a rampage and
[1:00:22] he's trying to attack individuals and we
[1:00:26] have to know where we're standing at in
[1:00:28] order to resist the attack in order to
[1:00:31] come out victorious. Isn't that right?
[1:00:34] So worship
[1:00:36] just like revelation is an individual
[1:00:39] affair.
[1:00:41] That's good. You could only truly
[1:00:43] worship God based on your measure of
[1:00:46] faith and how much has been revealed to
[1:00:49] you personally.
[1:00:52] Worship is not a random event.
[1:00:56] Worship is not something we just uh feel
[1:00:58] like doing because we have nothing else
[1:01:00] to do. It is not a filler material.
[1:01:04] Worship is is not random.
[1:01:07] Worship is intentional. Amen. There's an
[1:01:10] intent behind it. We intended to wake up
[1:01:13] this morning. We intended to put on our
[1:01:16] clothes. We intended to let the devil
[1:01:19] know whose side we are on. We intended
[1:01:23] to come in here with a purpose in our
[1:01:26] heart to praise God, to worship God, to
[1:01:31] tell the devil which side we are on. We
[1:01:34] intended to lift up his name and make it
[1:01:37] glorious. That that's our intention this
[1:01:39] morning. Our intention is to defy Satan.
[1:01:43] Our intention is to defy the armies of
[1:01:45] the of the of of Satan. Isn't that
[1:01:48] right? Our intention is to lift up the
[1:01:50] name of Jesus. That's our intention this
[1:01:54] morning. We didn't get up this morning
[1:01:56] randomly, but something woke us up this
[1:01:59] morning. That's his spirit calling us,
[1:02:03] beckoning us, wooing us to his presence,
[1:02:07] drawing us into himself. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:02:10] You didn't do that on your own, but God
[1:02:13] woke you up this morning and put a faith
[1:02:16] in your soul. God passed you through the
[1:02:20] valley, passed you through the test,
[1:02:23] passed you through dark shadows because
[1:02:25] he knew that the fate that was inside
[1:02:28] your soul would stand the test anyhow
[1:02:32] and that you would come out victorious.
[1:02:35] that you would see the purpose of God in
[1:02:38] the midst of your sorrow, in the midst
[1:02:40] of your pain, in the midst of your
[1:02:43] circumstance, in the midst of the broken
[1:02:46] glass, you can see the purpose of God.
[1:02:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:02:53] Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:02:55] Hallelujah.
[1:02:58] Amen. And I love that thought that
[1:02:59] brother Gideon over brought on
[1:03:00] Wednesday. He was talking about true
[1:03:03] soldiers. coming into the army of the
[1:03:06] living God to be dressed in this whole
[1:03:09] armor of God. And I love it. Praise God.
[1:03:12] Because that's the attitude we have to
[1:03:14] have. That's right. To endure hardship
[1:03:17] as a good soldier, testing, and trials
[1:03:22] because we understand that it's meant
[1:03:24] for our shaping. Isn't that right? And I
[1:03:28] had the privilege to have a conversation
[1:03:30] with men who were in the army because
[1:03:32] I'm not in the army myself. So I had to
[1:03:35] hear what these brothers testimony was
[1:03:38] about. And one of them was saying that
[1:03:40] if you could last at least one or two
[1:03:42] months in the army then you could do the
[1:03:45] whole thing. He said because the first
[1:03:48] mission of the army is to break you.
[1:03:52] They know that. That's why they bring
[1:03:54] you in. They shave your head. They give
[1:03:58] you clothes to wear. You can't wear your
[1:04:00] mama's clothes. You can't wear what you
[1:04:03] want to wear. You got to wear what we
[1:04:04] tell you to wear. You got to run where
[1:04:06] we tell you to run. You got to stand
[1:04:08] where we tell you to stand. And you got
[1:04:10] to keep on running. Keep on standing
[1:04:13] until we give you a different
[1:04:14] instruction. But he said the main
[1:04:16] purpose of it is to break you. They have
[1:04:19] to break you in order to build you up.
[1:04:22] They have to break you in order to make
[1:04:25] you the way they want you. They have to
[1:04:27] break you. Every soldier is broken.
[1:04:31] Every soldier comes to a point. They hit
[1:04:33] a wall where they break down, where
[1:04:37] their mental breaks down, where their
[1:04:39] physical breaks down, they take away
[1:04:42] medicines from them. They take away
[1:04:44] vitamins from them because their body
[1:04:46] have to run on just pure energy until
[1:04:49] they break down.
[1:04:51] They know this.
[1:04:53] Each one of them. That's why you have to
[1:04:56] pass through medical. You can't come in
[1:04:58] the army with heart murmurss and
[1:05:00] respiratory issues. They tell you go
[1:05:02] home. You're not fit for this academy.
[1:05:05] Because if you're coming in, you have to
[1:05:07] go be able to run the whole nine. You
[1:05:10] have to be able to go where we tell you
[1:05:11] to go. Run where we tell you to run. Oh,
[1:05:14] there can't be no hindrances to this
[1:05:17] because the idea is to break you down so
[1:05:20] that they could build you up. And then
[1:05:23] when they begin to build you up, the
[1:05:25] training changes. It changes from do
[1:05:27] push-ups and run and jump here and do
[1:05:29] this. Then it changes. Then they say,
[1:05:31] "This is how you hold a gun. This is how
[1:05:33] you use a grenade. This is how you
[1:05:35] dress. This is how you survive the
[1:05:38] wilderness. This is how to build a tent.
[1:05:40] This is how to dress. This is how to
[1:05:42] clothe yourself. The training changes
[1:05:45] from running around what it would look
[1:05:47] like randomly. Then it begins to train
[1:05:49] because now begin to fine-tune you
[1:05:52] because at the end of the six-mon
[1:05:53] period, you're coming out a soldier.
[1:05:58] At the end of the training session, you
[1:06:00] have to come out a soldier. And when God
[1:06:03] is finished with us, we are coming out
[1:06:06] soldiers.
[1:06:07] But God has finished running us through
[1:06:10] all the trials, all the pain, all the
[1:06:13] torment of soul. You come out a sier in
[1:06:17] the army of God. Oh, hallelujah. Praise
[1:06:22] God. Somebody say
[1:06:26] amen.
[1:06:27] Hallelujah.
[1:06:30] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. You must be
[1:06:34] able to face the devil anywhere, any
[1:06:37] time, any place, under any condition.
[1:06:41] Oh, you can fight and you can still win.
[1:06:45] You can win with a toothpick because you
[1:06:48] are trained to defeat the enemy.
[1:06:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:06:56] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:06:59] Praise God. Hallelujah. So it's not a
[1:07:02] random event.
[1:07:05] Stuff that you are going through.
[1:07:07] Hallelujah. It's not random.
[1:07:10] There's an intent behind
[1:07:13] all of your experiences
[1:07:15] to bring you into this mindset,
[1:07:19] this this mind of Christ, this
[1:07:22] understanding. Isn't that right? So we
[1:07:24] got up with one thing on our minds this
[1:07:26] morning. Our mind is stayed on Jesus.
[1:07:28] Isn't that right?
[1:07:30] David said, "One thing have I desired,
[1:07:32] now and that will I seek after that I
[1:07:35] may dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:07:37] forever to behold the beauty of the Lord
[1:07:40] to inquire in his in his temple." We're
[1:07:43] here to inquire this morning. If you
[1:07:45] have a question on your heart, Brother
[1:07:47] Brandham says there's an answer in here
[1:07:49] for every question that you will ever
[1:07:51] have in this world or world to come.
[1:07:55] Hallelujah. Isn't that right? God has
[1:07:57] the answers this morning.
[1:08:00] He said, "Amen." Isn't that right? So
[1:08:02] when certain Greeks came up at the
[1:08:03] feast, they said to him, "Sers, we would
[1:08:05] see Jesus." Isn't that right? When the
[1:08:07] wise men traveled from afar, they came
[1:08:10] into Jerusalem to worship. They started
[1:08:13] making some noise. They started causing
[1:08:16] some stir in what was dead Jerusalem at
[1:08:20] the time because they were not looking
[1:08:22] for anything. They were they were
[1:08:24] humrum. They were about their regular
[1:08:26] business, about their regular show when
[1:08:30] these men from the east came and
[1:08:33] interrupted the program of whatever was
[1:08:35] going on, the siesta, the sleep time
[1:08:39] that was happening in Jerusalem. They
[1:08:41] they interrupted all of that and they
[1:08:43] said, "We are looking for a messiah. We
[1:08:46] have seen his star in the east. We have
[1:08:49] come to worship him. We have seen
[1:08:52] something that has stirred our hearts.
[1:08:55] It is not a random event. It is not
[1:08:58] haphazard. But Lord, worship is directed
[1:09:01] at someone or worship is directed
[1:09:04] somewhere. That star brought us here and
[1:09:08] we are here to worship this morning. How
[1:09:10] have you come this morning? Have you
[1:09:13] come randomly or have you seen something
[1:09:15] in the word that woke your soul up this
[1:09:19] morning and you said unto yourself,
[1:09:22] "Sir, we would see Jesus. I know that
[1:09:25] there's a promise for me this morning. I
[1:09:28] know he promised the Holy Ghost. He
[1:09:30] promised to deliver. He promised to
[1:09:33] restore. He promised to make a way. And
[1:09:36] my
[1:09:38] worship is
[1:09:40] directing in the direction of that
[1:09:43] revelation this
[1:09:45] morning. That is how I came this
[1:09:48] morning. I came to cause something to
[1:09:50] happen based on what I've seen, based on
[1:09:54] what we've heard, based on what God has
[1:09:57] revealed to us.
[1:10:00] The things that are secret belong unto
[1:10:02] God. But if God ever reveals anything,
[1:10:06] that thing belongs to you this morning.
[1:10:09] Oh, it is not a secret anymore, but it
[1:10:12] is revealed. And the purpose of its
[1:10:15] revealing is to give it to you, to
[1:10:18] empower you, to encourage you, to give
[1:10:21] you a vision, and show you what you are
[1:10:24] to
[1:10:26] possess. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:10:29] and your worship what you are expecting
[1:10:32] to happen. Because in spite of how you
[1:10:35] feel, you worship. Therefore, worship is
[1:10:39] not a feeling. Worship is not an
[1:10:42] emotion. Worship is not something that
[1:10:44] just comes out of the sky like like
[1:10:47] airwick. No, no, no, no. Worship comes
[1:10:50] out of a divine revelation from God. You
[1:10:54] know within yourself why you put on your
[1:10:56] shoes this morning. Oh h you know why
[1:11:00] you put on your clothes this morning.
[1:11:01] You know, hallelujah. Hallelujah. That
[1:11:03] the devil could get all but he can't get
[1:11:06] those elect. Oh hallel whose names are
[1:11:09] written in the lamb's book of life
[1:11:11] because the beast shall deceive all that
[1:11:14] is upon the earth. All shall worship the
[1:11:17] beast except those names that are
[1:11:20] written in the lamb's book of life. Oh,
[1:11:23] don't worship God because they have
[1:11:26] power.
[1:11:27] Oh, hallelujah. That's the reason that
[1:11:31] we came in here this morning. Because if
[1:11:33] your name is there, then the inheritance
[1:11:36] is there also. If your name is there,
[1:11:38] then you have a possession. With your
[1:11:41] name on it, you have a possession this
[1:11:44] morning with your name on it. The Holy
[1:11:47] Ghost is mine. Joy is mine. Peace is
[1:11:51] mine. Love is mine. Anointing is mine.
[1:11:55] Presence is mine. Spirit is mine.
[1:12:00] Everything he died for. Belongs to me
[1:12:04] this morning. I'm here to get it. Oh,
[1:12:07] Satan, get out of my way. Oh, somebody
[1:12:11] praise him this morning. I feel the Holy
[1:12:14] Ghost. Oh, wants to sweep in here today
[1:12:18] and baptize you with the fire of God.
[1:12:21] Oh, hallelujah. We had enough of church.
[1:12:24] May the angel of God sweep in here and
[1:12:28] may he touch you. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:12:32] Amen. Amen. Brother Batiste.
[1:12:36] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:12:41] Hey, point your worship this morning
[1:12:44] in the right direction
[1:12:47] so that we could truly worship
[1:12:50] God in spirit and in truth this morning.
[1:12:54] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:12:58] Oh hallelujah. Glory.
[1:13:02] Amen.
[1:13:04] Hallelujah.
[1:13:06] To worship
[1:13:08] is to
[1:13:09] honor. It is to show reverence.
[1:13:13] Reverence to a divine being
[1:13:16] means you recognize that there is a
[1:13:18] divine being.
[1:13:20] that he is here this morning to meet our
[1:13:23] needs. And your worship recognizes that
[1:13:26] he is here.
[1:13:28] Your worship says to the devil that he
[1:13:31] is here. Your your your worship says to
[1:13:34] your own human body that he is here.
[1:13:36] He's here to to touch me. He's here to
[1:13:39] heal my condition. He's here to fix what
[1:13:43] I can't fix. He's here to restore what I
[1:13:46] can't do on my own. He is here to move
[1:13:49] in a way that only he can do. Oh
[1:13:53] hallelujah.
[1:13:55] I recognize him.
[1:13:58] I see him.
[1:14:00] Oh, and because I see him.
[1:14:03] I want to worship him. I want to honor
[1:14:07] him. I want to make him high and lifted
[1:14:10] up. I want to push him up up
[1:14:13] above all other circumstance.
[1:14:18] cuz he deserves it. He is above all
[1:14:21] things.
[1:14:23] All things he he exists.
[1:14:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. To show show
[1:14:29] reverence to a divine being to show
[1:14:32] reverence to a supernatural power.
[1:14:36] Lay ourselves prostrate before the Lord.
[1:14:40] Many men when they encountered this
[1:14:42] mighty presence
[1:14:44] fell as one dead. Amen. They were almost
[1:14:47] unconscious. They they couldn't even res
[1:14:50] move because they were stunned by the
[1:14:53] presence of God. Brother Brandham said,
[1:14:54] "We know the blessings of God." But we
[1:14:57] don't know the power of God. When the
[1:14:59] power of God hits you, Brother Brandham
[1:15:01] said days after he is still feeling the
[1:15:05] effects of that power. He's still
[1:15:07] feeling the effects of that presence.
[1:15:10] And that's the kind of presence we want
[1:15:12] to affect us this morning.
[1:15:15] so that it doesn't just last on Sunday,
[1:15:17] but but days
[1:15:19] after you're still feeling the effects
[1:15:23] of his presence,
[1:15:27] it lingers.
[1:15:30] It stays with you.
[1:15:32] Never leaves you.
[1:15:34] Never forsakes you. He wants to go with
[1:15:37] you wherever you go. He promised it'll
[1:15:41] be that way. cuz I genuinely believe
[1:15:43] that God's desire is for the church of
[1:15:46] the living God in the last days to live
[1:15:48] in the spirit to walk in the spirit to
[1:15:52] operate in the spirit. We we are too
[1:15:55] fleshly still. We too carnal still. We
[1:15:57] need some of that greenness baked out
[1:15:59] and burnt out in that hot July sun so
[1:16:03] that we could come into maturity. Bake
[1:16:05] out all of our greenness, all the stuff
[1:16:08] that that makes us respond to things.
[1:16:10] Hallelujah. Help us to die out to
[1:16:12] ourselves. Die out to what we think. Die
[1:16:16] out of how we feel so that the light of
[1:16:19] Christ could shine through you without
[1:16:22] any hindrances
[1:16:25] unfiltered by anything else or that we
[1:16:29] have in us. Amen. Oh my. Let me time
[1:16:32] myself here. Amen. So we know a lot
[1:16:34] about worship. But if we ask a question,
[1:16:37] what is worship? A few first thoughts
[1:16:39] would come to mind. Isn't that right?
[1:16:41] Some people think about singing. They
[1:16:44] say singing is worship. Some people
[1:16:46] might say shouting unto the Lord. Some
[1:16:49] people might say music is worship. Isn't
[1:16:52] that right? Lifting our hands uh and
[1:16:56] rejoicing in the Lord. And while all
[1:16:59] these things are attributes of worship,
[1:17:02] the truth is worship is a lot deeper
[1:17:04] than that.
[1:17:06] People know about worship. But what does
[1:17:08] it really mean? When we worship, we
[1:17:11] acknowledge. We acknowledge the Lord.
[1:17:13] Isn't that right? We are honoring him.
[1:17:16] We are making him feel welcome. Proverbs
[1:17:19] 3, trust in the Lord with all thine
[1:17:21] heart and lean not unto thine own
[1:17:24] understanding. In all thy ways
[1:17:27] acknowledge him and he shall direct thy
[1:17:30] paths. It says in all thy ways. Not just
[1:17:34] on a Sunday when you raise your hand,
[1:17:37] but also on a Monday when you start your
[1:17:39] car. Acknowledge God. When you walk into
[1:17:42] the bank, acknowledge God when you go
[1:17:45] out to carry the trash. Acknowledge God.
[1:17:49] When you come home at night and you lay
[1:17:51] your head on your pillow and you think
[1:17:53] about all he has accomplished for you
[1:17:56] today, acknowledge God in all your ways.
[1:18:00] And the Bible says he shall direct thy
[1:18:03] paths.
[1:18:04] So therefore, worship is not just on one
[1:18:06] day, but it's on all the days and in all
[1:18:11] thy ways.
[1:18:13] Acknowledge him. Isn't that right?
[1:18:16] Worship requires a sacrifice. Isn't that
[1:18:19] right? After man fell in the Garden of
[1:18:22] Eden, God drove man and woman out from
[1:18:25] the garden. That's right. And then later
[1:18:28] down we see Cain and Abel with their
[1:18:31] offspring and it come to a point where
[1:18:34] they had to worship. Yes sir. And they
[1:18:36] had to bring a sacrifice. Isn't that
[1:18:39] right? Revelation. By revelation they
[1:18:42] had to bring their own. They weren't
[1:18:43] told what to bring. That's right. They
[1:18:45] had to bring what their interpretation
[1:18:47] was of who this God was that they had
[1:18:50] heard about in Eden because they weren't
[1:18:53] there when when things were created. So
[1:18:56] they had to bring their their
[1:18:58] interpretation of this. Oh, isn't that
[1:19:01] right? And so Cain and Abel, they
[1:19:03] brought an offering to the Lord. And
[1:19:05] Hebrews 11 says that by faith, Abel
[1:19:09] brought a more excellent sacrifice than
[1:19:11] Cain. And in other words, it was
[1:19:14] revealed to Abel what sacrifice to
[1:19:17] bring. He brought of the the the the the
[1:19:21] cattle of the land. Isn't that right?
[1:19:23] And the fat thereof. And God accepted
[1:19:26] his sacrifice. But Cain bought fruits.
[1:19:29] Cain bought flowers because he was a
[1:19:32] gardener. So he tell himself, "Well, if
[1:19:34] I'm in gardening, surely God will enjoy
[1:19:36] my gardening as much as I enjoy it." Oh,
[1:19:39] hallelujah. Hallelujah. He went
[1:19:41] according to his own experience and
[1:19:43] brought an offering he thought was okay.
[1:19:47] But God rejected it. And here was Abel
[1:19:49] bringing something by revelation. He
[1:19:52] brought a lamb. He brought a sacrifice
[1:19:56] that was acceptable to God at that time.
[1:19:59] Isn't that right?
[1:20:01] Sacrifice is personal.
[1:20:04] That's good. This whole scenario here
[1:20:06] with Cain and Abel shows that it is
[1:20:09] personal.
[1:20:11] What sacrifice you are bringing, it's
[1:20:14] coming from you. And you have to know
[1:20:16] what you're bringing. And why you're
[1:20:19] bringing it and in what condition you
[1:20:21] are bringing it. Hallelujah. in order
[1:20:23] for God to bless it. Isn't that right?
[1:20:26] Amen. Isn't that right? There has to be
[1:20:27] an altar set up where you could come and
[1:20:30] bring that sacrifice to God. And it's
[1:20:33] not a random event. It is not something
[1:20:36] that just thrown about because when
[1:20:38] Elijah was rebuilding the altar before
[1:20:41] the fire fell, when he put the altar
[1:20:43] together, it was not a random event. He
[1:20:47] got a certain number of stones and he
[1:20:50] set them up together with the altar and
[1:20:53] he told them dig trenches fill it with
[1:20:56] water. There was an exactness. There was
[1:20:58] a preciseness about his methodology.
[1:21:02] There was a way he was doing it. There
[1:21:04] was something he was expecting to happen
[1:21:07] because he was expecting fire. He tell
[1:21:10] them pour water because he was expecting
[1:21:13] the consuming fire of God. He said,
[1:21:16] "Let's put this thing beyond all doubts.
[1:21:20] Pour water. Pour water. Pour more
[1:21:24] water." Because our God is a consuming
[1:21:29] fire. Whatever we set up here, he is
[1:21:32] about to consume it. Oh, nothing will
[1:21:36] stop the power of God. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:21:41] Hallelujah. It was precise. It was
[1:21:45] measured. It was calculated.
[1:21:48] It was by revelation.
[1:21:51] Isn't that right? And it made the
[1:21:53] difference between all the other ba
[1:21:56] worshippers who was just screaming and
[1:21:58] crying and making a whole lot of noise.
[1:22:01] Making a whole lot of noise doesn't
[1:22:02] necessarily mean you've got what it
[1:22:04] takes. You've got to know where you're
[1:22:06] coming at. Isn't that right? Hallelujah.
[1:22:10] Hallelujah. Isn't that right? Now there
[1:22:13] is a noise connected to worship. Don't
[1:22:15] get us wrong now. There is a certain
[1:22:17] sound that is connected to our worship.
[1:22:20] Psalms 89 and:e15 says, "Blessed is the
[1:22:23] people that know the joyful sound."
[1:22:26] Well, isn't that right? And they shall
[1:22:28] walk, O Lord, in the light of thy
[1:22:31] countenance. There it is again. That
[1:22:34] joyful sound is connected to a walk.
[1:22:37] You're not just making a noise, but
[1:22:40] you're walking in the truth. You're not
[1:22:42] just shouting, but you're walking in
[1:22:44] righteousness. You're not just making a
[1:22:47] whole lot of drama. Oh, hallelujah. But
[1:22:50] you're lining up with the word for your
[1:22:53] day and for your message. You recognize
[1:22:56] who God is. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:23:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Isn't that
[1:23:02] right? And there's a people yet in the
[1:23:04] land today who recognize who their God
[1:23:07] is. Isn't that right? Because Luther in
[1:23:11] their day, praise God, they recognized
[1:23:13] who he was. The word was revealed to
[1:23:15] them and they understood justification
[1:23:19] and they walked in the light of his
[1:23:21] countenance for their day and their
[1:23:23] noise, their worship was accepted in
[1:23:26] their day. Wesley walked in the light of
[1:23:29] God's countenance of that day and it was
[1:23:33] called sanification. And there was a
[1:23:35] people connected to that who worshiped
[1:23:38] according to that revelation and God
[1:23:41] poured out upon that. Isn't that right?
[1:23:43] The Pentecostals walked in the light of
[1:23:45] their day with the gifts in and the
[1:23:48] birth. Isn't that right? And God poured
[1:23:50] out and accepted their worship. Oh, what
[1:23:54] about our day? God revealed to us seven
[1:23:58] living voices, seven virtues. Oh, how it
[1:24:02] has been expounded to us. has been
[1:24:04] revealed to us. We are about to walk in
[1:24:07] the light of our day and God is going to
[1:24:13] receive our sacrifice.
[1:24:16] Isn't that right?
[1:24:18] Amen and amen.
[1:24:20] Wherever God goes, there's always some
[1:24:23] kind of noise happening around him.
[1:24:27] There's shoutings of hosana. There's
[1:24:29] blessings. There's honorings. There's
[1:24:31] there's always something happening
[1:24:33] around
[1:24:34] God. Brother Brandham said here on
[1:24:37] earnestly contending, he said, "I know
[1:24:39] that you think we're an awfully noisy
[1:24:42] bunch." He said, "Well, brother, I can
[1:24:44] prove to you that if there ain't noisy,
[1:24:48] then there ain't no God there."
[1:24:51] Oh, hallelujah. Let me say that again. I
[1:24:54] can prove to you that if there ain't no
[1:24:57] noisy, then there ain't no God there.
[1:25:01] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory. I
[1:25:06] rather you hot or you're cold. Oh, if
[1:25:10] you're hot, then get on fire for God.
[1:25:13] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. And if
[1:25:15] you're cold, get
[1:25:17] out. But God will be worshiped.
[1:25:23] He said, "Listen, in the Old Testament,
[1:25:25] when Aaron anointed the rose of Sharon,
[1:25:29] and when he had that anointing oil that
[1:25:31] run down his bed to the hems of his
[1:25:34] skirt, he taken the sacrifice and he
[1:25:37] went into the holies of holies." And
[1:25:40] when he went in, behind that curtain,
[1:25:43] across his garment, he had a pomegranate
[1:25:47] and a bell. a pomegranate and a bell and
[1:25:51] they would hit together and when he
[1:25:54] walked it played holy, holy, holy unto
[1:25:59] the Lord. He said that is the anointed
[1:26:03] church of God moving into the holies of
[1:26:07] holies. That representation he's talking
[1:26:10] about is the anointed church of God
[1:26:13] moving into the holies of holies like
[1:26:16] what we attempting to do this morning
[1:26:19] moving into the holies of holies. This
[1:26:22] anointed church of God. We've got a
[1:26:25] bell. We've got a pomegranate and we are
[1:26:28] maring anointed with the oil that runs
[1:26:32] down the beard. anointed with the spirit
[1:26:35] of the living God to take up your
[1:26:38] scripture for your day. Oh hallelujah.
[1:26:42] Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord.
[1:26:48] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:26:53] Oh hallelujah. We make a noise, holy,
[1:26:56] holy unto the Lord according to our
[1:27:00] faint, according to the revelation of
[1:27:02] Jesus Christ in this last day.
[1:27:05] Hallelujah. That points us in the
[1:27:07] direction of him. Oh, who sits on the
[1:27:11] throne. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. He
[1:27:15] said, "And look here, brother." The
[1:27:17] reason they did that, that was the only
[1:27:19] way that they could tell that he was
[1:27:22] alive. They listened to hear if there
[1:27:25] was any noise. And he said, "If there
[1:27:28] was no noise, then he was dead." Oh,
[1:27:32] hallelujah. And he said, "And that is
[1:27:34] what it is today. A church that is born
[1:27:38] again going into the holies of holies,
[1:27:41] anointed with God's pomegranate bell."
[1:27:44] Hallelujah. He said, "Yes, sir. You know
[1:27:48] that they are alive when that bell is
[1:27:51] ringing.
[1:27:52] Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. Holy on
[1:27:58] a Monday, holy on a Tuesday, holy on a
[1:28:03] Wednesday, on a Thursday. Doesn't matter
[1:28:06] what day. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:28:12] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:28:16] Oh, he said the outsiders pass by.
[1:28:19] Hallelujah. And the scoffers say, "Look
[1:28:21] at them." Prophet said, "That's all
[1:28:23] right." He said, "Well, look at them
[1:28:26] then." Oh, look at them. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:28:30] Hallelujah. Take a good look at them.
[1:28:32] Hallelujah. How wonderful. Holy, holy
[1:28:35] unto the Lord. Played the bells against
[1:28:38] the pomegranates. Oh, halle the prophet
[1:28:41] explaining. Isn't that right? Do you
[1:28:43] appreciate that? Amen. My
[1:28:46] So, it's always a noise connected.
[1:28:49] Wherever Jesus went, there was always
[1:28:52] some kind of a noise going about him.
[1:28:56] Imagine Jesus is going on his way and
[1:28:59] someone just runs up to him and says,
[1:29:01] "Son of David, have mercy on me."
[1:29:05] Imagine he's about his business with his
[1:29:08] disciples and some woman come screaming
[1:29:10] and crying, "Lord, my daughter is vexed
[1:29:14] with the devil." Wherever he goes,
[1:29:16] somebody's always crying. Come by here,
[1:29:19] Lord. Come by here, Lord. Come by here,
[1:29:22] Lord. Because something in them
[1:29:25] recognizes that the master is near. And
[1:29:28] whatever need they have can be addressed
[1:29:31] right now because he's in the building.
[1:29:34] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:29:37] Hallelujah. Oh, glory, glory, glory.
[1:29:41] Hallelujah.
[1:29:43] If you go by an office and the boss is
[1:29:46] not there, it might not make sense stay
[1:29:48] in because if you need something signed,
[1:29:51] you might have to wait until he comes.
[1:29:54] So, it might better you come back. If
[1:29:56] you talk to the receptionist, she'll say
[1:29:58] come back. Maybe he's on lunch. Maybe
[1:30:01] he's out at a meeting. But once the head
[1:30:04] guy is there, once the head signatory is
[1:30:07] there, you could get your stuff signed
[1:30:10] because he's there to do it right now.
[1:30:14] And what I'm telling you is there's
[1:30:16] somebody in the building this morning.
[1:30:19] If you have an application that you need
[1:30:22] to get signed, you could get it signed
[1:30:25] this morning. You don't have to wait for
[1:30:28] tomorrow. Oh, because he is here.
[1:30:32] Oh, and a
[1:30:34] revelation declares it to be
[1:30:37] so. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:30:40] Hallelujah. Worship him until you get
[1:30:43] what you want. Worship him until the
[1:30:45] testimony of Jesus and the spirit of
[1:30:47] prophecy. Worship him until the promise
[1:30:50] is fulfilled.
[1:30:53] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:30:56] Glory. Don't be afraid. Run up on Jesus.
[1:31:00] Say, "Glor, son of God, have mercy on
[1:31:03] me. Son of David, have mercy on me."
[1:31:10] He'll sign your application this
[1:31:13] morning. Hallelujah. Cuz he is here to
[1:31:15] do it. Isn't that right? Amen. Amen.
[1:31:21] Jesus got to that mad man at Gdara,
[1:31:24] remember God, he had to cross the the
[1:31:26] the sea. Isn't that right?
[1:31:28] come over to a different place. The
[1:31:31] other side.
[1:31:33] America have a term called the other
[1:31:35] side of the tracks.
[1:31:37] It's another place. We don't we don't go
[1:31:39] to that place. And uh you know the
[1:31:42] disciples, I don't know if it was on the
[1:31:44] itinerary at all to get to go to Gdara,
[1:31:47] but this didn't seem like one of the hot
[1:31:49] spots. This didn't seem like one of the
[1:31:52] places that they were supposed to be
[1:31:53] today. But Jesus was on a mission.
[1:31:57] He was honor. He had an agenda. He
[1:32:00] needed to get to Gdara because there was
[1:32:02] a man there that he had to deliver.
[1:32:05] Isn't that right? And one of the most
[1:32:07] astounding things is that when Jesus
[1:32:09] begin to walk towards the tombs, begin
[1:32:12] to walk towards a cemetery. I don't
[1:32:14] think a cemetery was on the itinerary
[1:32:16] for today, but but they found themselves
[1:32:18] in a cemetery. Wherever Jesus is going,
[1:32:21] we will follow. If he's going into the
[1:32:24] tombs, I'm going with him. I'm safer in
[1:32:26] there than I am out there. Praise God.
[1:32:29] Without him. So, the disciples are
[1:32:31] following along, but but but they're
[1:32:33] hoping there's a plan here somewhere
[1:32:35] because they know that there's a man in
[1:32:36] there that is chained because he's too
[1:32:39] strong for anybody to hold on to him.
[1:32:42] He's possessed with devils. A man
[1:32:45] possessed with devils named Legion. Many
[1:32:48] devils. Isn't that right?
[1:32:50] uh he was scraping himself and crying to
[1:32:53] himself because he was looking for
[1:32:55] deliverance, looking for a breakthrough,
[1:32:58] but there was nobody to deliver him from
[1:33:00] this circumstance. But then here came
[1:33:03] Jesus with a mission to go to the other
[1:33:06] side because there was a man there that
[1:33:08] needed to be delivered. And as soon as
[1:33:11] that man saw Jesus, he ran towards Jesus
[1:33:15] and he began to worship. He began to
[1:33:18] worship him. He hadn't been delivered
[1:33:20] yet, but he began to worship him. He
[1:33:23] hadn't been saved yet, but he began to
[1:33:26] worship him. He was still in his
[1:33:28] condition, but he began to worship him.
[1:33:31] Because whenever Jesus is around, he
[1:33:34] demands worship. And whatever your
[1:33:37] condition is this morning, whatever
[1:33:39] situation you find yourself in, all you
[1:33:43] have to begin to do when Jesus comes
[1:33:47] near is to worship. Oh, and then the
[1:33:51] impossible becomes possible. Then the
[1:33:54] sick could be healed. Then the blind
[1:33:57] could see.
[1:34:01] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:34:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. A man packed
[1:34:06] with devils
[1:34:08] worshiping God. What a phenomenon.
[1:34:13] What a paradox.
[1:34:15] Because there were Pharisees,
[1:34:18] Sadducees,
[1:34:19] scribes who couldn't put it in their
[1:34:21] brain to worship him. They find fault
[1:34:25] with him. They pick at him. They they
[1:34:27] they they throw at him. They they they
[1:34:29] called him heretical. They said he was
[1:34:32] be elabub. They they they they said he
[1:34:34] was a blasphemy because he called
[1:34:37] himself God or they called him all kinds
[1:34:39] of names. But simple people, ordinary
[1:34:43] people, people who look messed up,
[1:34:45] people who look twisted up, people who
[1:34:48] look bent up and broken, people who look
[1:34:51] like they're beyond the point of
[1:34:52] recovery. God, the God that can mend the
[1:34:56] broken hearts. That God reached tongue
[1:34:59] into every situation.
[1:35:03] Hallelujah.
[1:35:06] And the impossible was made possible.
[1:35:09] Oh, he can do it for you this morning.
[1:35:13] He can do it for you right now. Don't
[1:35:16] you be afraid.
[1:35:18] Just worship him.
[1:35:21] Worship
[1:35:22] Christ our Lord and watch to see what he
[1:35:27] will do for you.
[1:35:30] Oh, glory. He's doing it right now.
[1:35:34] Just worship him this morning. He is
[1:35:37] healing right now.
[1:35:39] Just worship him this morning.
[1:35:43] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:35:45] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:35:48] Glory. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:35:52] That's all right.
[1:35:54] You can worship.
[1:35:56] We were created to worship him. That's
[1:35:59] all. Hallelujah. Don't let the devil
[1:36:01] deceive you. Your hands, your feet, your
[1:36:04] mouth, your ears, your eyes, your body
[1:36:07] was created to give God glory and to
[1:36:11] worship God. Oh, in the beauty of his
[1:36:14] holiness. To worship
[1:36:17] God. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:36:25] They couldn't recognize him. Hallelujah.
[1:36:28] They couldn't recognize who he was
[1:36:31] because this Messiah didn't come
[1:36:34] according to their interpretation of him
[1:36:37] expectation or the expectation or the
[1:36:39] way they they thought he was going to
[1:36:40] come. He didn't come that way. He come
[1:36:43] born of a virgin of a conspiracy.
[1:36:48] They couldn't receive that. So from
[1:36:49] birth they were thrown off and they
[1:36:51] said, "Is not this Joseph son? Isn't
[1:36:54] that that guy, that copter guy from up
[1:36:57] the road? Isn't that his son? Why is he
[1:37:00] reading the scripture? Why is he saying
[1:37:02] that he is anointed and and
[1:37:04] commissioned? Why is he saying that?
[1:37:05] They they couldn't receive that. But
[1:37:08] people who seemed like they couldn't go
[1:37:11] on met with him and they had a different
[1:37:14] testimony because he revealed himself to
[1:37:16] them in a way that he could never reveal
[1:37:19] himself to others because they had their
[1:37:21] own veil over their hearts.
[1:37:24] and they could not see him. Isn't that
[1:37:25] right? But we were predestinated this
[1:37:27] morning to see him as he is in his glory
[1:37:33] and in his grace. Isn't that right?
[1:37:35] Amen. Amen. And that is because
[1:37:38] revelation is sovereign. Amen. God
[1:37:40] reveals himself to whomsoever he will.
[1:37:44] Now, when you drill down into this root
[1:37:45] word of worship, the root word of
[1:37:48] worship is worthy.
[1:37:50] Which means that if you're going to
[1:37:52] worship something, we first have to find
[1:37:55] something that is worthy of our worship.
[1:37:58] Isn't that right? The root word of
[1:38:00] worship is actually worthy. So
[1:38:02] therefore, if order to worship, someone
[1:38:05] had to be worthy of our worship in order
[1:38:09] for us to worship. Isn't that right?
[1:38:12] Isn't that right? And man was created to
[1:38:14] worship. His whole being, isn't that
[1:38:16] right? Was just was created to worship.
[1:38:18] was created to worship God. And because
[1:38:21] we know who created us, we have a
[1:38:23] revelation with that someone and we
[1:38:26] worship him because he had created us
[1:38:28] for his glory. Isn't that right? Isn't
[1:38:32] that right? And as Christians, we pray.
[1:38:35] And prayer is how we connect to God.
[1:38:38] It's how we communicate with God. And
[1:38:40] it's how we ask for the things that we
[1:38:42] need. As Christians, we praise. And when
[1:38:46] we praise, we thank God. for the things
[1:38:49] that he has done for us for which we are
[1:38:52] grateful. We are thankful to the Lord
[1:38:55] for his wondrous works towards the
[1:38:57] children of men. Isn't that right? We
[1:38:59] are thankful. We are blessing his name.
[1:39:02] But worship has nothing to do with any
[1:39:05] of that. We worship God because of who
[1:39:09] he is.
[1:39:11] Worship has to do with the revelation
[1:39:15] of who he is. Isn't that right? And it's
[1:39:18] revealed to you who he is. You have to
[1:39:21] have a revelation in order to worship
[1:39:23] God.
[1:39:24] And revelation is faith.
[1:39:27] Cuz when God reveals himself to you,
[1:39:31] that gives you faith to believe on him
[1:39:34] when you worship him. Hallelujah. Isn't
[1:39:36] that right? Psalms 100 says, "Make a
[1:39:39] joyful noise unto the Lord all he
[1:39:42] lands." There's that word noise again.
[1:39:45] Oh, we come to make a joyful noise unto
[1:39:48] the Lord. Wherever you come from, all ye
[1:39:52] lands, worship the Lord. Serve the Lord
[1:39:55] with gladness and come before his
[1:39:58] presence with singing. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:40:02] There's your singing. There's your
[1:40:04] noise. There's your joy. There's your
[1:40:07] gladness. But verse three, it says,
[1:40:09] "Know ye that the Lord, he is God." Oh,
[1:40:14] in order to worship God this morning,
[1:40:16] you have to know that he is God. You
[1:40:20] have to know that he is a healer. You
[1:40:23] have to know that he is your savior. You
[1:40:27] have to know that he is your deliverer.
[1:40:30] He is a way maker. He is a restorer.
[1:40:35] That he is a baptizer. You have to know
[1:40:38] this morning. You have to know that he
[1:40:40] is able to meet your need. He is able
[1:40:44] this morning to set the captive free. He
[1:40:48] is able to break the bands of wickedness
[1:40:51] and unbelief. Whatever situation you're
[1:40:54] in this morning, you have to know that
[1:40:56] he is
[1:40:59] Oh, he is God.
[1:41:02] It is he that had made us in the
[1:41:05] beginning. He formed you in his mind.
[1:41:07] And he knew who you were. Oh, he made
[1:41:10] you. Oh, hallelujah. The beauty of
[1:41:13] holiness. He didn't make yourself. You
[1:41:16] didn't call yourself. You didn't raise
[1:41:18] yourself up. You didn't save yourself.
[1:41:21] You couldn't deliver yourself. But he
[1:41:24] made a way for you to be delivered in
[1:41:27] this time that you're living in. He
[1:41:30] opened the door. He pulled your soul
[1:41:34] from out of darkness into his marvelous
[1:41:37] light. And that's the reason that I
[1:41:40] shout his praises because it is he that
[1:41:43] had made
[1:41:44] us and not we
[1:41:46] ourselves. We are his
[1:41:49] people and the sheep of his pasture. Oh
[1:41:54] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:41:56] Hallelujah. Oh we can praise him today.
[1:42:01] So it says, "Enter into his gates with
[1:42:04] thanksgiving
[1:42:06] and enter his courts with praise. Be
[1:42:09] thankful unto him because you know that
[1:42:12] he is. Bless his name for the Lord is
[1:42:15] good and his mercy is everlasting. His
[1:42:19] truth endureth to all generations."
[1:42:23] Hebrews 11 says, "But without faith it
[1:42:24] is impossible to please him. For he that
[1:42:28] cometh to God must believe that he is,
[1:42:32] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:42:36] diligently seek him. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:42:39] You're not just seeking him, but you're
[1:42:41] seeking him diligently. Diligence means
[1:42:44] I need to get a product out of my
[1:42:47] actions, out of whatever I'm doing. I
[1:42:50] can't go back empty-handed. Diligent
[1:42:52] means I must get a reward. Oh, I must
[1:42:55] get something back. A return on my
[1:42:58] investment. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:43:01] [Applause]
[1:43:03] Glory.
[1:43:06] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:43:08] God is the object of worship.
[1:43:12] That's right. He is not God unless there
[1:43:15] is someone to worship him. Hallelujah.
[1:43:18] The prophet said that, isn't that right?
[1:43:20] Worship is what makes him God.
[1:43:24] That's good. And I had this written
[1:43:26] here. Worship. Your worship actually
[1:43:28] defines who he is.
[1:43:34] Because brotherham said he was God. But
[1:43:36] he wasn't exactly God at that time. He
[1:43:38] said because God is an object of worship
[1:43:42] and there wasn't nothing to worship him.
[1:43:45] So he wasn't God. He was actually
[1:43:47] undefined. He was l Eli Elohim, the
[1:43:50] self-existent one alone by himself.
[1:43:54] Isn't that right? He was undefined.
[1:43:56] In other words, he wanted to be a
[1:43:58] father, but there's nobody to be a
[1:43:59] father to. So then what was he? He
[1:44:03] wanted to be a healer, but there was
[1:44:04] nobody to heal. So then what was he?
[1:44:08] Think about it. And scientists, I think
[1:44:10] even uh we talk about Einstein and he
[1:44:14] and all these other guys like Isaac
[1:44:16] Newton had these theories about
[1:44:17] relativity. theory of relativity and
[1:44:19] relativity principle. And in basics,
[1:44:22] what that means is if I took an object
[1:44:25] and I put it in a room and took the
[1:44:27] lights off with no other reference
[1:44:30] point, then that object is actually
[1:44:33] undefined because there's nothing else
[1:44:36] to relate that object to. There's
[1:44:39] nothing else in that space to relate
[1:44:42] that object to. I am only as far as I am
[1:44:46] from brother Popwell because brother
[1:44:48] Popwell is there and I am here. But if I
[1:44:51] couldn't relate myself to brother
[1:44:52] Popwell then where am I? Am I far from
[1:44:55] him? He is not even there. Do you
[1:44:58] understand it? So God is existing in
[1:45:00] alone by himself. There's no one else
[1:45:03] relative to him that we can relate to
[1:45:06] that we can make him understandable to
[1:45:09] us because there's nothing else to
[1:45:11] understand. Amen. I know this is going
[1:45:13] over your head,
[1:45:15] but if I put you in a room by yourself,
[1:45:17] there's nobody in that room. Who do you
[1:45:19] talk to?
[1:45:21] Whose mother are you? Whose father are
[1:45:24] you? There's no one else in that room,
[1:45:25] then who are you? You're just undefined.
[1:45:28] But as soon as something or someone
[1:45:30] comes into that room, now there's
[1:45:32] relativity. Now you are either further
[1:45:35] from that person or nearer to that
[1:45:38] person based on how you move towards
[1:45:40] them or further away from them. But that
[1:45:43] principle couldn't exist if that person
[1:45:46] is not there. And God could not be God
[1:45:49] if he didn't create subjects to worship
[1:45:52] him.
[1:45:54] He couldn't be God.
[1:45:56] He was just alone by himself existing in
[1:46:01] nothingness until he created something
[1:46:04] to worship him. And because that
[1:46:07] something was created, now those beings
[1:46:09] could give him worship and then he
[1:46:12] became God.
[1:46:14] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:46:17] Hallelujah.
[1:46:19] So, brother Bam said in my opinion the
[1:46:21] first thing he did was he created angels
[1:46:24] and then they worshiped him and that
[1:46:27] made him God and then he started from
[1:46:30] there. And as in previous message he
[1:46:32] said he tried to break it down when
[1:46:34] those angels began to worship him. That
[1:46:37] was before there was even a molecule on
[1:46:39] the earth there was nothing. It was all
[1:46:42] darkness. There was no sun, no moon, no
[1:46:45] stars and no nothing. Then he was God.
[1:46:49] And he asked Job, he said, "Where was
[1:46:51] you when I laid the foundations of the
[1:46:54] world?" See, when the morning stars sang
[1:46:57] together and what the sons of God
[1:47:00] shouted for joy, see, now where were
[1:47:04] you? You were those sons of God back
[1:47:08] there worshiping him. And your worship
[1:47:11] defined who he was. Your worship
[1:47:15] declared who he was. We were saying you
[1:47:18] are our redeemer. You are our Lord. You
[1:47:21] are our maker. You are hallelujah the
[1:47:25] chief cornerstone. You are who was and
[1:47:28] is and is to come. You are the eternal
[1:47:31] one. He always was, always will be. Your
[1:47:36] worship. Oh hallelujah. Defines
[1:47:40] who he is.
[1:47:42] It testifies of him and lets the whole
[1:47:45] world know who God is to you as an
[1:47:49] individual. Your worship does that.
[1:47:52] That's how powerful that is. That's how
[1:47:55] significant that is. That's why God
[1:47:57] wants your worship because as soon as
[1:48:00] the devil got worship for himself, that
[1:48:03] worship start to define who he was.
[1:48:06] Isn't that right? Hallelujah. Isn't that
[1:48:07] right? As a false god. See, and then
[1:48:10] they had two waring factions,
[1:48:12] loggerheads, because uh uh there was a
[1:48:15] new principle in in in uh created in
[1:48:17] there. Isn't that right? But God wants
[1:48:19] to bring it back to the original
[1:48:21] principle where God is or was and always
[1:48:24] will be Lord over all things, over all
[1:48:28] our lives, over all territories, over
[1:48:31] all denomin um nominations and whatever.
[1:48:35] God will be in charge of everything
[1:48:37] else.
[1:48:38] Lord of all things. Isn't that right? Oh
[1:48:40] my worship invites his presence.
[1:48:43] Hallelujah. Isn't that right? It invites
[1:48:45] his presence to confirm the faith that
[1:48:48] you claim to have in the word of God. It
[1:48:52] is evidence that you have received his
[1:48:54] word. Isn't that right? Prophet said and
[1:48:58] whatever he says you to do, do it.
[1:48:59] Prophet said let's say praise the Lord.
[1:49:02] He said praise be to God. He said God,
[1:49:04] the word of God means the word God means
[1:49:07] object of worship. See and he said and
[1:49:09] God wants to be worshiped. Jesus said
[1:49:13] God is a spirit and they that worship
[1:49:16] him must worship him in what? Spirit and
[1:49:19] in truth. Truth is what is truth? He
[1:49:23] said he said I am the truth. And here he
[1:49:26] is tonight. Brother Bham said in our
[1:49:28] midst being the truth. Hallelujah. The
[1:49:31] truth vindicating his presence. He is
[1:49:34] both spirit and truth. Isn't that right?
[1:49:37] Woman says that's the truth. Man says
[1:49:39] that's the truth. He said then that's
[1:49:40] the truth. You have no right to doubt
[1:49:42] it. Oh, isn't he wonderful? Prophet
[1:49:45] said, "Amen." Hallelujah. Worship is a
[1:49:48] lifestyle.
[1:49:50] Isn't that right? Worship is a
[1:49:52] lifestyle. Adam's entire lifestyle was
[1:49:56] like a worship unto God. From the moment
[1:49:58] he woke up to the moment he laid down
[1:50:01] his head at night, his entire being, all
[1:50:04] that he did, all of his expressions was
[1:50:08] as a worship unto God. And that's what
[1:50:10] it's going to come back to. That's
[1:50:12] that's what we talk about when we say
[1:50:14] going back to Eden or Eden condition
[1:50:17] because we're going to come into such a
[1:50:19] state and condition that everything we
[1:50:22] do is going to be a worship unto God.
[1:50:26] Everywhere you walk, every conversation
[1:50:29] you have is going to be holy, holy unto
[1:50:32] the Lord. Is going to be defined by your
[1:50:35] worship. Isn't that right? Amen. Amen.
[1:50:38] His work, his actions, his words, his
[1:50:41] whole being was continually in worship
[1:50:46] unto God.
[1:50:47] Second Peter 3 said, "But in the day the
[1:50:49] Lord will come as a thief in the night,
[1:50:52] which the heaven shall pass away with a
[1:50:54] great noise, and the elements shall melt
[1:50:56] with fervent heat. The earth and also
[1:50:58] the works that are therein shall be
[1:51:00] burnt up." So then he says, "Seeing that
[1:51:03] all these things shall be dissolved."
[1:51:06] What manner of persons ought ye to be?
[1:51:09] Hallelujah. In all holy conversation and
[1:51:13] godliness. And that word conversation,
[1:51:15] brother over it always says means
[1:51:17] lifestyle. It means in your daily
[1:51:20] living. How what manner of people we
[1:51:23] ought to be this morning in all holy
[1:51:26] conversation in all holy lifestyle and
[1:51:29] godliness looking for and hasting until
[1:51:32] the coming of the day of God wherein the
[1:51:35] heavens shall be uh be on fire shall be
[1:51:37] dissolved and the elements shall melt
[1:51:40] with fervent heat. Isn't that right? Oh
[1:51:43] my. My oh my. Hallelujah. Amen. So,
[1:51:45] let's touch on Isaiah a little bit. We
[1:51:48] know that he had an encounter, isn't
[1:51:49] that right? With this holy God. Amen. He
[1:51:53] had a worship time. Let's look at it. He
[1:51:55] says, "Now in the influence of another
[1:51:56] prophet said here, now let's look take a
[1:51:59] look at these wings for a few minutes."
[1:52:02] He said, "We find out that two wings he
[1:52:05] covered his face with my I think he said
[1:52:09] even holy angels covered their holy
[1:52:12] faces in the presence of a holy God."
[1:52:16] And the only thing that they could say
[1:52:18] was holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
[1:52:22] Almighty. Holy, holy, holy Lord God
[1:52:26] Almighty. And we are told that they cry
[1:52:28] day and night. And that's the first step
[1:52:31] from God coming down day and night. He
[1:52:34] said, "No letting up." Oh, that's how
[1:52:37] our praise ought to be. That's how our
[1:52:40] worship ought to be. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:52:42] Hallelujah. That's how our lifestyle
[1:52:44] ought to be. No letting up. Holy, holy
[1:52:47] unto the Lord. He said, "And you think
[1:52:49] that we would make a lot of noise? What
[1:52:52] do you think?" He said, "Do you think we
[1:52:54] make a lot of noise? What do you think
[1:52:55] about millions of those around the
[1:52:58] throne with a voice that shook them
[1:53:01] temple pillars when the only one of them
[1:53:04] cried holy holy holy he said you know
[1:53:08] his voice shook the temple he said when
[1:53:11] millions of them crying around the
[1:53:13] throne of God holy holy holy Lord God
[1:53:18] Almighty holy holy holy Lord God
[1:53:21] Almighty he said with wings over their
[1:53:24] faces. Their faces over their feet was
[1:53:27] wings representing reverence, respects,
[1:53:30] he said. Oh my. Skipping down. He said,
[1:53:33] "Now watch. Two wings." He said covered
[1:53:35] his face. Two wings. That meant
[1:53:39] reverence. Reverence before God. Bowing.
[1:53:43] Covering his face. He said, "And now we
[1:53:45] don't have any wings to cover our face
[1:53:48] with." He said, "But we bow our head at
[1:53:51] his feet." Oh, that's what we here to do
[1:53:54] today. Bow our head at his feet. He said
[1:53:58] we bow and pray in reverence, in
[1:54:01] respect. Yes, sir. Recognize it. And two
[1:54:05] wings. He covered his feet. He feet
[1:54:08] covered his feet and represented
[1:54:09] humility. Respects. He said like Moses
[1:54:12] had respects in the respects of God
[1:54:15] telling him that he was on holy ground.
[1:54:18] Prophet said he took off his shoes. See,
[1:54:21] he did something to his feet.
[1:54:24] Hallelujah. Paul in respects to God in
[1:54:26] reverence when the angel of the Lord
[1:54:28] came before him. That pillar of fire, he
[1:54:31] fell on the ground. He fell on his face.
[1:54:34] See, he couldn't look at him because
[1:54:36] there was a holiness there that demanded
[1:54:39] a reverence, that demanded a respect. It
[1:54:42] demanded an action that reflected the
[1:54:45] holiness of God that he had encountered.
[1:54:48] Oh, and there is something we have to do
[1:54:50] this morning. Oh, to reflect the
[1:54:52] holiness of God that we encounter when
[1:54:55] we get into his presence. Oh,
[1:54:58] hallelujah. Our face is bowed. Our hands
[1:55:00] are lifted up. We get in the spirit. Oh,
[1:55:03] holy, holy unto the Lord. Oh, recognize
[1:55:07] him. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:55:11] And pay him homage this morning. Because
[1:55:14] he is worthy.
[1:55:16] Because he is holy. Amen. He demands our
[1:55:19] worship this morning. Amen. When the
[1:55:21] angel of the Lord came before him, that
[1:55:23] pillar of fire, he fell on the ground on
[1:55:26] his face. Hallelujah. Respect. See, John
[1:55:28] the Baptist, he had such respects when
[1:55:31] he saw Jesus coming. Hallelujah. He
[1:55:33] said, "I'm not even worthy to touch this
[1:55:35] feet." See the feet showing respects
[1:55:38] again. See, he pointed all through
[1:55:40] scripture. Thank you, Lord. It is right
[1:55:42] there. He said, "Oh, be conscious." See
[1:55:44] the prophet says here now be conscious.
[1:55:47] Here's only one thing to be conscious
[1:55:49] of. He says your
[1:55:51] littleness. If you want to get somewhere
[1:55:54] with God, he said make yourself real
[1:55:57] little. Oh hallelujah. When you get in
[1:56:00] the presence of God, doesn't matter who
[1:56:02] you are, you are no longer a big shot.
[1:56:05] You're not even a medium shot. You are
[1:56:07] little this morning. All of us are
[1:56:10] little ones in his presence. We are
[1:56:13] little ones to him below. They are weak
[1:56:16] but he is strong. Oh, and we worship the
[1:56:20] father in spirit and in truth because he
[1:56:23] alone can raise up the downtrodden
[1:56:26] and he casteth down the proud and the
[1:56:28] and the prideful. He is God. Isn't that
[1:56:31] right? He said always notice a big man.
[1:56:34] He said humbles himself. That's right.
[1:56:36] He said the way up is down always. He
[1:56:40] said, "Make yourself little and God will
[1:56:43] bring you up. He that exalts himself
[1:56:46] shall be abased, but he that humbles
[1:56:49] himself shall be exalted." Oh my, I like
[1:56:53] that. He says, "Make yourself little."
[1:56:56] Prophet said, "Always be little. Don't
[1:56:58] be the big shot. Be the little fellow."
[1:57:01] See, God is the only one among us that's
[1:57:05] big. Anyhow, he said, "That's right." He
[1:57:08] said, "You will always say it's a holy
[1:57:09] church." the holy people. But oh no, the
[1:57:12] prophet said it's the holy God. That's
[1:57:15] right. He said it's an unholy church and
[1:57:18] unholy people. Right? Ain't no such
[1:57:20] thing as a holy church. He said it's a
[1:57:23] holy God in the church, not a holy
[1:57:26] people. It's the Holy Ghost in the
[1:57:29] people. He said then you're talking not
[1:57:32] of the people. He said they are talking.
[1:57:34] But the Holy Ghost is what is in the
[1:57:37] people. Oh, and that's what we're going
[1:57:40] to come back to one of these days. It be
[1:57:42] a holy God in the people living out
[1:57:46] humility, living out in respects, living
[1:57:50] out a humble lives, thundering unto God.
[1:57:53] Oh, that is the thunder that will shake
[1:57:56] the devil in the last days. It'll be
[1:57:59] holy sanctified lives, humble unto God,
[1:58:03] obedient to his word, holy God upon the
[1:58:07] people, making them holy. That's the
[1:58:10] right interpretation. Amen. Amen. Holy
[1:58:13] God. Ghost is in the people. Amen. Yes,
[1:58:16] sir. That is the right word. Amen.
[1:58:19] Prophet said that struck home. He said,
[1:58:21] "I felt that one." Yes, sir. He liked
[1:58:23] that. I know that. Glory. That's right.
[1:58:26] He said, "Now make yourself little."
[1:58:27] See, he covered his face with two
[1:58:29] reverence. He humbled himself by
[1:58:31] covering his feet. And now thirdly, with
[1:58:34] two he did fly. He put himself in action
[1:58:38] with two of them. He was reverent before
[1:58:41] God. He was humble before God. And not
[1:58:44] only that, he he just didn't sit there,
[1:58:47] but the prophet said he put himself in
[1:58:50] action. Oh, hallelujah. That's what we
[1:58:53] want to do today.
[1:58:55] put ourselves in action. Humble
[1:58:58] ourselves, reverend before God. And the
[1:59:01] next thing to do is put yourself in
[1:59:02] action. Your action has to declare that
[1:59:06] you truly have a revelation of who God
[1:59:09] is. That doesn't make you sit still. If
[1:59:12] you have revelation, it puts you into
[1:59:16] action. Oh, hallelujah. What is your
[1:59:19] action this morning? Oh, did you come
[1:59:22] this morning to sat still? Or did you
[1:59:24] come to get into action? Oh, to pray, to
[1:59:28] praise, to seek his face. Oh, when they
[1:59:32] saw Jesus lifted up before them, when he
[1:59:35] ascended into heaven and the cloud
[1:59:37] received him up out of their sights, the
[1:59:40] disciples went immediately into action.
[1:59:43] They were worshiping. They were praising
[1:59:45] God continually. And they went back to
[1:59:48] Jerusalem praising and worshiping God
[1:59:52] continually in the upper room, waiting
[1:59:55] on God, waiting for God to pour out his
[1:59:58] dynamics upon them. Hallelujah. Oh,
[2:00:04] glory. They went into action. He
[2:00:07] prophesied talk about a church. Amen.
[2:00:10] Put himself in action. Whatever he had,
[2:00:13] he was ready to go with. Yes, sir. The
[2:00:16] only thing he could say was, "Holy, holy
[2:00:19] is the Lord God Almighty." He put
[2:00:22] himself into action. After all that God
[2:00:25] has revealed to you, all that you could
[2:00:28] say is holy, holy unto the Lord God
[2:00:32] Almighty. After all that he has revealed
[2:00:35] to us in these last days, how he's going
[2:00:38] to form himself in us. How the word
[2:00:40] image is going to be formed in you by
[2:00:43] these seven mysteries, by these seven
[2:00:45] thunders. What can we say but holy, holy
[2:00:49] is the Lord God Almighty. Do unto me
[2:00:53] whatever is your will. I want to be
[2:00:56] subject to your will today. Oh holy,
[2:00:59] holy unto the Lord. Oh hallelujah. Put
[2:01:03] yourself in action this morning. Oh
[2:01:07] hallelujah. Hallelujah. He put himself
[2:01:10] in action. That's right. He got in
[2:01:12] action. And that is what the church
[2:01:14] needs tonight. Is first to be reverent
[2:01:18] and next thing to be humble. He said,
[2:01:20] "And then get yourself in action." Oh,
[2:01:25] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:01:27] We've got to do something for something
[2:01:29] to happen. Oh, that's time this morning
[2:01:32] for the church of God to get into
[2:01:34] action. Oh, what we see should make a
[2:01:38] church. That should make a revival. What
[2:01:40] we see ought to put us in action. Oh,
[2:01:44] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Met ought to
[2:01:46] pray and not to faint. Oh, get in action
[2:01:50] this morning. Oh, get on fire. Oh, clear
[2:01:53] everything out. Let's get ready. A
[2:01:56] revival is coming. Holy, holy unto the
[2:01:59] Lord. Get in action this morning. Blow a
[2:02:03] trumpet in Zion. Sound an alarm in the
[2:02:06] holy mountain. Uh let the people pray uh
[2:02:09] from the pillar to post, from the pulpit
[2:02:11] to the backbench. Get on fire for God
[2:02:14] and get in action. Uh and you watch and
[2:02:17] see if God will not work wonders above
[2:02:21] us. If we get on place, if we get in
[2:02:25] line. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:02:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There's another
[2:02:29] holy time coming. Oh, we believe it's
[2:02:33] here. Our faith declares it to be so.
[2:02:37] Oh, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory,
[2:02:40] glory. Do you believe it? Amen. When the
[2:02:42] revelation hit Abel to worship God, he
[2:02:45] got into action. He got a lamb, placed
[2:02:48] it on that flat rock, and he killed that
[2:02:50] lamb and was bleeding. It was bloody. It
[2:02:54] was messy, but it was an action that
[2:02:57] confirmed his faith in the word of God.
[2:03:00] And God honored that sacrifice. Oh, when
[2:03:04] the revelation hit Abraham, he went up
[2:03:07] on the mountain. He told his men's
[2:03:09] servants, I am the lad, go up, I am the
[2:03:12] lad, come back down, he saddled an ass,
[2:03:15] and he and Isaac went up that mountain
[2:03:18] to offer a sacrifice. He went in
[2:03:21] obedience to the word of God and full
[2:03:24] obedience to the word of God. Today will
[2:03:27] entitle you to the token. Oh,
[2:03:30] hallelujah. You will receive the Holy
[2:03:33] Ghost and power in your soul when you
[2:03:36] get into
[2:03:38] action.
[2:03:41] Oh, hallelujah. Align not. Oh,
[2:03:45] hallelujah. Glory. Oh my my
[2:03:49] my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hal
[2:03:53] Revelation 19:10. We just read it. John
[2:03:56] is overwhelmed. He has seen many things
[2:03:59] that the angel has already revealed in
[2:04:01] the vision and he falls down to worship
[2:04:04] him at his feet. He said, "And I fell to
[2:04:07] worship at the feet of him." And he said
[2:04:09] unto me, see that thou do it not. I am
[2:04:13] thy fellow servant and of thy brethren
[2:04:15] that have the testimony of Jesus.
[2:04:18] Worship God for the testimony of Jesus
[2:04:21] is the spirit of prophecy. Worship God.
[2:04:25] He says, "Worship God. Not your idea,
[2:04:29] not your opinion, but don't even worship
[2:04:31] me." He said, "But worship God. God has
[2:04:35] given us today." And Elijah the prophet,
[2:04:38] he said, "Behold, I send unto you, unto
[2:04:40] you. You the predestinated one, you the
[2:04:44] little one, you the one that needs help,
[2:04:46] you the one that needs strength. Behold,
[2:04:48] I send Elijah unto you, the prophets."
[2:04:53] Oh, hallelujah. to reveal every mystery.
[2:04:56] He has revealed all the mysteries.
[2:04:58] Christ veiled in that prophet has
[2:05:01] revealed all things. And therefore,
[2:05:04] therefore, our mission this morning is
[2:05:07] to worship God because we have the
[2:05:10] testimony of Jesus from 1946 to
[2:05:14] 1965. The book has been opened and all
[2:05:18] the seals have been revealed. And this
[2:05:22] morning we can prophesy again from that
[2:05:25] book. It is written. It is written.
[2:05:30] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory. I
[2:05:35] feel the Holy Spirit. Let's close this
[2:05:37] thing out today. Amen. I'm getting ready
[2:05:38] to close out. Testimony of Jesus. What
[2:05:41] is it? Sweeten them out. Sweeten them
[2:05:44] out. You testify. Come and see, brother.
[2:05:47] Come and see, sister. Come and see what
[2:05:50] the Lord has done for me. Don't come and
[2:05:53] talk. Don't come and feel. Come and see.
[2:05:56] Come and drink. Come and experience what
[2:05:59] God has done for me. He woke me up this
[2:06:02] morning. He put faith in my soul. He
[2:06:05] poured into me the baptism of the Holy
[2:06:08] Ghost. This morning, sir, come and see.
[2:06:12] We would see Jesus. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:06:16] Hallelujah. And the spirit of prophecy,
[2:06:19] what is it? Bitter in the belly. That's
[2:06:22] the rejection part. That's bearing the
[2:06:24] reproach of barrenness until the
[2:06:27] fulfillment of all things come. You have
[2:06:29] no evidence to show or all you know. All
[2:06:32] you could say is God said so. God said
[2:06:35] so. Holy, holy are you, Lord. God
[2:06:38] promised a revival. God promised to
[2:06:41] heal. God promised to deliver. God
[2:06:43] promised to restore. Hallelujah.
[2:06:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:06:48] Hallelujah.
[2:06:50] Oh, glory. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[2:06:55] Revelation. Worship. And then a
[2:06:57] manifestation comes.
[2:07:01] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory.
[2:07:05] Isn't that
[2:07:06] right? Get ready to come. Revelation.
[2:07:10] What did he do? He opened the word to
[2:07:12] their understanding of the scriptures.
[2:07:14] He breathed on them, receive ye the Holy
[2:07:17] Ghost. And when he was ascended up on
[2:07:19] high and led captivity captive, the
[2:07:22] Bible said he gave gifts to men. But
[2:07:23] before that, they began to worship holy.
[2:07:26] They were reverent and they were in
[2:07:28] action. They were continually in the
[2:07:30] temple praising and worshiping God. And
[2:07:33] then all of a sudden, all of a sudden,
[2:07:36] there came a sound from heaven. Oh,
[2:07:40] hallelujah. That filled all the house
[2:07:42] where they were sitting. and every one
[2:07:45] of them receive the lick of fire in
[2:07:48] their soul. I pray today may you receive
[2:07:52] your lick of fire in your soul. May he
[2:07:56] burn into you the baptism of the Holy
[2:07:59] Ghost. Oh, holy, holy unto the Lord God
[2:08:02] Almighty. Let the redeemed say so.
[2:08:08] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:08:12] Glory rest can get ready. Hallelujah.
[2:08:16] Oh, are you ready tonight? Let's close
[2:08:18] this out. Amen. Thank you so much. It's
[2:08:22] a uniting time. Oh, I believe the bride
[2:08:26] of Christ is called. The prophet said,
[2:08:28] he said, I believe she is sealed into
[2:08:31] the kingdom of God. I believe the
[2:08:33] mechanics is here. They are just waiting
[2:08:35] on the dynamics that will take her off
[2:08:38] this earth and into glory and into the
[2:08:41] rapture. I believe it with all my heart.
[2:08:45] We know that he's going to do it. He
[2:08:48] shall do it. The prophet said he is the
[2:08:51] dynamics. We become members of the
[2:08:54] machine of his body, forming ourselves
[2:08:57] into his image as he unites himself with
[2:09:00] us and send us his love gifts just
[2:09:04] before the wedding's supper. We're
[2:09:06] watching for that. You begin to stand.
[2:09:08] Amen. Hallelujah. The dynamics of this
[2:09:10] church, they're big churches to be
[2:09:13] united. But the dynamics of this church
[2:09:16] today will be a refilling of the Holy
[2:09:20] Spirit that we have worked in a small
[2:09:23] measure while the headstone is coming
[2:09:26] down to unite with the body. And when
[2:09:30] that head and that body unite together,
[2:09:35] the full power of the Holy Ghost would
[2:09:37] raise her up just exactly like that.
[2:09:41] Even the dead that's dead in Christ. You
[2:09:43] can play something softly. For hundreds
[2:09:45] of years ago will rise in the beauty of
[2:09:48] his holiness and take a flight to the
[2:09:51] skies. The dynamics is the Holy Spirit.
[2:09:55] For your name is holy. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:09:57] Glory.
[2:09:59] Oh, stand and worship him. Stand and
[2:10:02] praise him
[2:10:03] today. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:10:06] Hallelujah.
[2:10:07] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:10:11] Hallelujah. Oh,
[2:10:14] hallelujah. Final quote. The prophet
[2:10:17] said the mystery of God would be
[2:10:18] revealed. And when that would completely
[2:10:21] reveal the seven mysteries would open to
[2:10:24] the church because in there the church
[2:10:26] would be living under the inspiration of
[2:10:29] the Holy Spirit. Him moving in and out
[2:10:33] showing his signs of being alive and
[2:10:36] among us and living among us. And we are
[2:10:40] then worshiping the living Christ that
[2:10:43] is among us. May the Lord bless you. I'm
[2:10:47] finished this morning. Glory to God.
[2:10:50] Hallelujah. Oh, let us give him a shout
[2:10:53] of praise, a shout of worship. He
[2:10:56] deserves all the honor. He deserves all
[2:10:59] the glory. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:11:03] Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Oh, glory.
[2:11:07] Glory. Oh,
[2:11:09] hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:11:13] Give him praise right now. Give him
[2:11:15] glory. Oh, hallelujah. We had to worship
[2:11:19] him. We had to bow before you. We had to
[2:11:22] glorify his name. Hallelujah.
[2:11:24] Hallelujah. Oh, I see his throne. I am
[2:11:28] lifted up this day. Hallelujah. Oh,

[2:43:14] asking God for the Holy Ghost and my
[2:43:18] purpose, what he wants me to do."
[2:43:21] So the enemy is using this to tarnish my

[2:43:47] God. Amen. So God can do it. Amen. and
[2:43:50] he's all
[2:43:51] powerful. And maybe if you have a a
[2:43:54] prayer request, amen, this evening and
[2:43:56] you want to raise your hand, Amen. that
[2:43:58] God would answer your prayer. Praise the

[2:44:37] that if one attack if an attack on her
[2:44:41] on her health it's it's one attack on
[2:44:44] her health after the next. That's how
[2:44:46] she feels.
[2:44:48] Please agree in prayer as we hold her
[2:44:50] hands through prayer and declare in
[2:44:52] Jesus name that enough is enough. Amen.
