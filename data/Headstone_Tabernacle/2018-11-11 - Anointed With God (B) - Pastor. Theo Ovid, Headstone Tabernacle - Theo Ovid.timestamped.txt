[0:21] the streets at zero
[0:26] [Applause]
[0:33] three of the guardsmen how many want to
[0:36] deal with the issues there's a lot of
[0:39] shout I'm not hearing that so you have
[0:42] to deal with it
[0:46] I'll sit and see it again and again
[0:48] until under it stick you can't defeat me
[0:51] cannot be better consent
[0:55] [Music]
[1:01] [Applause]
[1:22] [Applause]
[1:38] [Music]
[1:47] w otherwise
[1:49] you may be seated praise Micah Rafi
[1:53] under them started the double turn
[1:55] attached all nine years as a same old
[1:58] devil but we can
[2:01] [Applause]
[2:06] smokin the rose
[2:19] [Music]
[2:35] [Music]
[2:46] [Music]
[3:01] [Music]
[3:03] [Applause]
[3:07] [Music]
[3:07] [Applause]
[3:14] we've been anointed God
[3:23] Jesus use the words of spirit is upon me
[3:27] he hunted me all right and the
[3:35] background I was chosen of human mind
[3:37] because a human mind is where decisions
[3:39] are made friends dad forgive me but I
[3:41] love decisions I love the truth
[3:45] I love from my choice because I choose
[4:22] that
[4:32] choice
[5:15] is there something in house
[5:33] because you
[5:51] [Applause]
[5:57] let me see them
[5:59] Sam C is presented as a mallet big
[6:01] muscles and big activity nihilism but
[6:05] the truth was something with a smaller
[6:07] fella them
[6:24] right
[6:27] [Applause]
[6:30] Oh mr. Taylor didn't miss nothing
[7:35] [Applause]
[7:59] [Applause]
[8:11] [Applause]
[8:25] what she says
[8:27] although real
[8:29] Oh glory
[8:34] see what you feel is what Samson's feel
[8:37] came upon him he had no books you have
[8:41] no church leader even you come on now
[9:02] I'm gonna be anointed I'm dragging
[9:14] [Applause]
[9:15] a man cannot sing until the first cast
[9:23] aside godswood until she gets rid of the
[9:29] word of God the presence of God cannot
[9:31] sing though I've ever said the Lord is
[9:34] at my right hand I shall not be moved
[9:39] I'm still again but he said the Lord is
[9:41] on my right hand I shall not be moved in
[9:44] all ways they both used to be practicing
[9:46] the presence of God at the glories with
[9:47] him because when people feel the Lord
[9:49] not be the one that did this they want
[9:51] to do that but they want to do that they
[9:53] want to do that because the Lord he's
[9:55] not they cannot see him but if he said
[9:57] the Lord is of mine shall not be moved
[10:03] hallelujah that's why the Bible says in
[10:07] the mount of torchi witnesses learn
[10:09] everything they establish so you can't
[10:11] just a report about someone and there's
[10:14] no evidence or witnesses you'll be
[10:16] receiving a report isn't that right
[10:18] that's why if somebody offend you or
[10:20] something we won't tell somebody good to
[10:22] that person with them I give a reference
[10:26] one time you can see somebody calls
[10:28] about some water or something some
[10:30] bottle and that's when a report come he
[10:32] wasn't about drinking you didn't see him
[10:34] drinking that's a report but a car
[10:39] broke down when I got some water tap on
[10:41] a radiator but because it was seeing
[10:44] that we and instead of verifying
[10:46] information somebody won with that an
[10:47] estimate he was drinking evil figures in
[10:49] Curitiba that's assumption that's come
[10:53] saying like everything in a garage that
[10:54] car but suppose they learn more
[10:59] the four wheels it was in the guard
[11:07] things like that love for truth not
[11:23] gossip not personnel not just talk for
[11:27] truth because they cheated what sets
[11:30] people free
[11:37] but I can t give a testimony about a
[11:40] woman with five boys and he didn't
[11:42] finish it off finish it off in London
[11:43] you just got the tip and we gonna put it
[11:45] on your website Charlie got it but he
[11:47] was telling a woman listen if the
[11:49] doctors take off your wing
[11:50] I think you do I don't see you happy
[11:52] feet yeah if you kind of feed for the
[11:54] fibers to be healed how you are
[11:56] faithfully sorry going to be restored
[11:59] the other long story short the woman was
[12:02] healed and completely decided probably
[12:07] this sucks this sucks I have five boys
[12:10] such as right 1390 facts but what is
[12:18] right
[12:20] what is akela

[12:28] challenge

[12:41] in a box because they might have feit
[12:43] that you go ahead are you going higher

[12:48] in say can't bother with people trying
[12:50] to put boxes around me they have to
[12:53] study what God want unfolding your very
[12:55] life amen

[16:35] said not Church of there's no certain
[16:37] organization not Google say we have it
[16:39] yes Aaron doesn't have it that's a
[16:41] spirit you know it's a superior agency
[16:49] okay if this church right now could be
[16:57] put together and knitted together with
[17:00] such that every person would be one
[17:02] accord with not one shadow of doubt
[17:04] anywhere there would not be a feeble
[17:07] person in our midst in another five
[17:09] minutes there will be nobody here design
[17:14] the Holy Ghost but pop would receive it
[17:16] you can get that certain thing fixed
[17:22] it
[17:29] if I could change America changer
[17:31] behavior if the worker change our mind
[17:34] if you change your life but you have to
[17:37] wonder change be transformed by the
[17:41] renewing of your mind
[17:45] you're mine have to change before you
[17:48] have to change that's why God started
[17:51] writing some new heart I'll give you and
[17:53] you stir it and then I put my spirit
[17:55] inside your spirit what it is changing
[17:57] your mind changing the torch changing
[17:59] desires we said court invading your very
[18:02] life all right
[18:10] when Jesus came on the scene what always
[18:13] been against the truth that's the reason
[18:16] today we can't have faith faith is not
[18:17] based upon man's theology feet is based
[18:20] upon the solid rock of God's eternal
[18:22] world before continue I want to see back
[18:25] something we talked about right spirit
[18:27] wrong doctrine better than right
[18:31] doctrine done wrong spirit that's true
[18:33] but God didn't send a prophet for staff
[18:35] right spirit on wrong doctrine he's on a
[18:38] profit of you have the right spirit
[18:40] unlike doctrine I want a meal that dog
[18:44] so I'm not advocating this right spirit
[18:46] right spending on those on a profit
[18:49] Natasia the Lord and that profits that
[18:52] the spirit the bride and the Prophet
[18:55] will be saying the same thing
[18:59] and what they say will have already been
[19:02] said in the world it can take away from
[19:06] it it stops here the Lord
[19:13] so watch so jesus a carpenter's son
[19:17] physically speaking when it came to this
[19:19] here he was known of the data John
[19:22] baptized him God vindicated him
[19:25] God spoke from the heavens John so I'm
[19:28] coming on in the form of a dove and said
[19:29] this is my beloved Son in whom I am
[19:33] pleased to dwell the right translation
[19:34] here is in whom I am pleased to dwell in
[19:39] Jesus immediately anointed with God he
[19:47] was just a man till that time no he
[19:52] becomes a god man
[19:57] so the anointing of God brings you to
[20:00] become a god man you see God is a spirit
[20:06] and Christ means The Anointed One
[20:09] a man anointed with God or give the Lord
[20:15] some praises people and just as a man
[20:21] could be anointed with God a man could
[20:23] be anointed with the devil
[20:26] listen to this Jesus was God yet a big
[20:31] job he went over to the mimic in Dodaro
[20:33] who has been a wild man for years a
[20:35] young fellow we were told had lost his
[20:37] human reasoning lived in trillions with
[20:39] an evil spirit what a place for a man to
[20:41] live in a great job is very fitting for
[20:43] the devil to the among dead things so he
[20:47] lived out there and was so terribly
[20:48] afflicted with these demons he proteins
[20:51] his trait was super strength did he ever
[20:57] see a man that had been stricken by the
[20:58] evil spirit like that is several times
[21:01] of strength I have noticed them in the
[21:04] meetings
[21:05] when groups of police could maybe heal
[21:07] them they would tear them produce the
[21:09] pieces and carry on because why he is
[21:15] fully surrendered to the evil one took
[21:18] possession of him and had not a stone
[21:21] understanding he only did what the evil
[21:24] spirit put in him to do then I taught
[21:26] but complete surrender to the devil
[21:30] a man can be five times of strength
[21:33] what could complete surrender to God to
[21:41] a man that's weakened the body that
[21:47] can't walk if we could complete the
[21:50] yield to the Holy Ghost God will give us
[21:52] a super strength to rise in the name of
[21:56] Jesus
[21:58] Rasulullah is in the world center chorus
[22:01] in you is greater than any infection
[22:04] that can come upon you there is nothing
[22:06] can overtake you but usually superseded
[22:09] because you are foolish and that super
[22:13] is the holy spirit that dominates your
[22:17] life
[22:18] if you are Christian
[22:26] meaning everybody that could be here
[22:29] every sick person to get a punch on
[22:31] their own you could shake it off
[22:33] yes
[22:37] [Applause]
[22:39] oh Jesus he was not Pat God he was all
[22:50] gone
[22:51] he created the winds of waves other
[22:54] things have to obey Him he was the
[22:55] creator notice let us remember he also
[22:58] created our bodies he create wings to
[23:02] create waves if it sees you officials
[23:05] and he created our bodies let man come
[23:09] for the dust of the earth and God for
[23:11] man fruits of the spirit man Genesis 1
[23:13] then a dustman Genesis 2 and God put the
[23:16] spirit man in the dust man that's you
[23:19] and I here this morning moon and stars
[23:26] and everything else to obey Him so now
[23:38] he's coming out the poet was safe
[23:41] that's why I'm understood Jesus he was
[23:44] he went into the wilderness overcome the
[23:46] loss of the eyes become the lusts of the
[23:47] flesh
[23:48] we welcome the pride of life because
[23:49] before born empowers a man but full
[23:51] power he has to be able to himself
[24:00] that's nothing that's gospel that's
[24:04] nothing but the truth
[24:05] people power and have no character no
[24:08] power for them
[24:13] I think on rolling back power no because
[24:17] what stingy and what paying hard to get
[24:21] hard to give his ruling back power lucky
[24:24] you know you seen characters no no power
[24:27] to behold it isn't much is it kept on
[24:29] top of that maybe Ruth Oh hallelujah
[24:33] the Prime Minister's president time in
[24:35] opposition to one week so they call it

[24:56] somebody to mow God blesses in more

[52:56] you to follow the Holy Spirit and the
[52:58] Bible for he is the one who do these
[53:01] things Jesus Christ in the form of the
[53:04] Holy Spirit or my praise God
[53:08] so for my resume my other two teachers

[53:14] Lord for giving us a marine moderately I
[53:17] will course a comment for you to rain
[53:19] the formal arena in the first month and
[53:20] the floor shall be full of wheat and the
[53:22] faction were heard when an oil and I
[53:24] restore to you the years
[53:26] Lucas eaten the concubine the
[53:27] caterpillar family my great army shall
[53:29] eaten plenty and my people shall not be
[53:31] ashamed
[53:32] now it says God will restore the neutron
[53:35] is to know restore the church it starts
[53:37] at the Reformation Israel right
[53:38] watch now this very moment we are in the
[53:41] complete fulfillment of Matthew 24:24
[53:43] and so much if it possible deceive the
[53:46] very elect and who is it that they
[53:48] attempt to deceive the very elect this
[53:50] print of the antichrist and the false
[53:52] waiting one the last is these false one
[53:54] already come in Jesus name claiming that
[53:57] they've made an idol of God for this
[53:58] last day the affairs massage anointed
[54:01] ones they claim their profits what they
[54:04] are one with the world never we have
[54:06] added or taken from it no one denies the
[54:10] spell of God manifested ins dis upon
[54:12] them but like Balaam the all of the
[54:14] programs made up even money exercise
[54:17] gives the deny the word and bypass it
[54:19] for fear that a controversy might
[54:21] diminish their chances for it again yep
[54:23] it's our vision on deliverance through
[54:25] the power of God like Judas with a
[54:27] ministry and patted by Christ but
[54:29] because they are wrong seed
[54:30] consequently they have the wrong spirit
[54:33] motivate in them and watch this part of
[54:36] a negative the outshine elect an effort
[54:38] and zeal but it is now addition not of
[54:41] Christ for it looks for big crowds big
[54:43] programs
[54:44] signs among them the preacher second
[54:46] coming and so forth
[54:47] but deny the advent of a prophet
[54:49] passenger though in power and signs and
[54:51] true revelation eclipse in them all yes
[54:54] it is part this falls through the last
[54:56] days is so close to real can be
[54:59] distinguished here we go only by its
[55:03] deviation from the word not by an region
[55:08] that by shouts that might jump in my
[55:10] singing not by specialist not by worship
[55:13] but by deviating from the world that's
[55:17] why we said the prophet and the bride
[55:19] and the Spirit sees the same thing and
[55:22] what they say will be already in the
[55:24] world are you with me much they can
[55:28] distinguish only by its division from
[55:29] the world and whenever it is caught in
[55:32] the ant world it falls back on one
[55:34] argument we already are shown to be
[55:36] forced we get results don't we we have
[55:38] to be of God how we get results
[55:41] oh my my are you with me
[55:46] watch watch what he didn't want to go
[55:51] those prophets had things
[55:52] it was hard thing to do didn't want to
[55:55] be going out and this corner they want
[55:57] enough fellowship and go the rest of
[55:59] them I don't want to do this but God has
[56:01] spoken and I must have it what is it
[56:03] like it was it they crucified Him but it
[56:04] is told him whatever it is God has put
[56:06] his heart or pigeons is better than
[56:08] sacrifice watch it was in his heart you
[56:12] must do it
[56:13] it was his life he couldn't hold it
[56:15] there was something I'll see son that
[56:18] push them they couldn't bless opposite
[56:20] God had so much complete control of them
[56:23] till he was their voice diction these
[56:27] prophets so look at Elijah Elijah said
[56:30] not even rain or Dew will fall till I
[56:33] confer
[56:35] the heavens imagine a mandala I never
[56:40] not even do or renal for tonight over
[56:43] these guys wanted but God the Word was
[56:47] God
[56:51] member one promised I'd give me a church
[56:53] that's so completely anointed that God
[56:56] till their every action of movers duster
[57:00] the Lord work and uh Chicana glory I
[57:02] will show you a messiah Anointed One of
[57:05] God standing upon the earth today
[57:06] Oh give me a church goer get one year
[57:11] when all the alleged feels to do in two
[57:14] thousand years you wait till the
[57:16] anointing of the church strikes home did
[57:19] that feels a little remnant after the
[57:21] doors of the Gentiles close call with a
[57:24] anointest juice them he was full to be
[57:26] filthy still he's right to the register
[57:28] all mine at a time so praise God so G
[57:37] Joseph must get my coat of many colors
[57:39] and the pressured hated him he who came
[57:42] to bring them peace but the
[57:43] misunderstood him the hated him with all
[57:45] the coins they didn't try to stop to see
[57:48] what he was trying to achieve
[57:49] they just judge him because listen he
[57:52] didn't agree with them said you agree
[57:56] damn they judge you he makes himself
[57:58] swan song song so the composes it
[58:00] couldn't help trill himself there he
[58:02] didn't dude hypocritically when God
[58:04] tells Moses get away their mother
[58:05] destroys people no just put in Stephanie
[58:07] kept us in Lord before I destroy them
[58:08] destroy me he was genuine spirit of
[58:17] Christ in them so before you take the
[58:18] people take me first there was a spirit
[58:21] of Christ and Moses
[58:24] hallelujah are you with me he never did
[58:27] it for SAP glory watch if they would
[58:29] have looked to the word Buddhist in his
[58:32] purpose he will always do that to
[58:34] glorify the father neither will any
[58:36] servant of God take glory you know what
[58:38] any servant take the gift of God and try
[58:40] to verify himself I want to read it
[58:42] again a servant of God will not take
[58:44] glory Nina what any sort of God take a
[58:46] gift of God and try to glorify himself
[58:49] the Spirit of God working in men make
[58:54] men like God no wonder jesus said is not
[58:59] it with ear gods that is small Gina the
[59:01] G and if they are poor cord doesn't the
[59:04] Spirit of God came to how can you
[59:06] condemn me when I say I'm the son of God
[59:08] they were God's command G because they
[59:11] would hell yeah all right all right
[59:13] because they had completely surrendered
[59:16] themselves to the Spirit of God and they
[59:18] were working for the glory of God David
[59:22] said you come with me and she longs fear
[59:24] but I come to you the name of the Lord
[59:26] he had the right objective here like
[59:28] milk earth
[59:29] isn't that right so when a man is
[59:32] anointed with the spirit now let us go
[59:35] real deep under the fifth rib on the
[59:37] left side when a man are you ready
[59:41] everybody alive
[59:44] is so anointed with the spirit when a
[59:47] man is anointing of the Spirit of God
[59:49] his habits his actions and everything is
[59:53] moving in him some time he's misjudged
[59:57] look at the difference my God might go
[59:59] wild or forsake me that was a spirit of
[1:00:02] Christ indeed it I went to reason with
[1:00:04] Sam who could ever see that it was the
[1:00:07] spirit seen my caught my god somebody
[1:00:10] said this lets the bucket up there who
[1:00:11] hands his peers who features peers
[1:00:12] that's the intellectual but one word is
[1:00:15] limit of spirit would know that was the
[1:00:16] Spirit of God in him crying out when a
[1:00:19] man is anointed here we go again of the
[1:00:22] Spirit of God he has got the action of
[1:00:25] God
[1:00:26] are you ready and the action of God is
[1:00:29] never to break us up the action of God
[1:00:34] is to draw us together so we are one in
[1:00:38] Christ Jesus God's purpose is to bring
[1:00:41] us together to love one another
[1:00:45] did you get that the actual employer is
[1:00:48] not to break up pick up husband and wife
[1:00:51] pick up families break up churches pick
[1:00:53] up this book uh back then of the action
[1:00:55] of God the actions ones that bring
[1:00:56] together he's making a bride he is hewn
[1:01:02] the chips no chopping off the world
[1:01:04] watch he's cutting you don't know cut
[1:01:07] you down to his word only cutting all
[1:01:09] the crease and drachmas and everything
[1:01:11] away from you trying to get back a bride
[1:01:13] for the son
[1:01:13] another masterpiece part of the world
[1:01:15] hopefully become bright cut cheese shape
[1:01:19] you to be his bride you got already all
[1:01:21] to himself
[1:01:23] he wants the Christ with his taking a
[1:01:26] bride for his son Jesus Christ not a
[1:01:28] church of his son a bride for his son
[1:01:31] and that bride is made up of members who
[1:01:34] are part of him who is part of that
[1:01:36] world so you could never get fight with
[1:01:39] the word because you are going to be the
[1:01:41] wood itself so when the word hit you you
[1:01:43] could let me say Amen what is you you
[1:01:46] are part of that word isn't that right
[1:01:49] so therefore you get boot to the tree on
[1:01:52] the day of Pentecost isn't that right
[1:01:53] move twenty
[1:02:03] for 39 and do a performant hi and here
[1:02:07] you can eat to the tree the holy ghost
[1:02:09] Pentecost justification sonification the
[1:02:12] path only goes and then Christ come to
[1:02:14] dwell in it to bring forth the proofs
[1:02:16] fruits
[1:02:16] justification summer vacation back to
[1:02:19] the Holy Ghost
[1:02:20] then the person of the Holy Ghost comes
[1:02:22] in that to bring forth the fruits oh my
[1:02:27] so all to the ages all these
[1:02:28] organizational vines or branches rather
[1:02:31] and what God keep doing cutting them off
[1:02:33] they produce a Baptist branch Methodist
[1:02:36] branch pentecostal budget-cutting at all

[1:21:49] spirit is the life of Christ is that
[1:21:52] right the life of Christ and the life of
[1:21:55] any seed which he was the root seed
[1:21:57] brings the seed to leave if that life is
[1:22:01] lean in the seed the seed is the word
[1:22:04] and this baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:22:06] comes upon it it wants to bring that
[1:22:09] seed so the 7-inches message is not the

[1:23:01] the original production of the world and
[1:23:03] it constructed the ethan time and watch
[1:23:05] no matter how much you preach here we go
[1:23:08] whatever you do it cannot be ripened it
[1:23:12] cannot be manifested it cannot be
[1:23:14] vindicated only my image that i am the

[1:26:30] received the Holy Ghost but we received
[1:26:32] enough Holy Ghost to make us the place
[1:26:34] or we don't want to lie we don't want to
[1:26:36] steal we don't want to do anything but
[1:26:38] God wants to fill every fiber of his
[1:26:42] church he wants to fill your thinking he
[1:26:45] wants to fill your mind he wants to fill
[1:26:47] a bit of you so if you watching movies
[1:26:49] movies movies what chance would have to
[1:26:51] put anything in your mind because you
[1:26:54] caught up in that movie world you caught
[1:26:56] up in that magazine or the columns in
[1:26:58] that nother world and God have no place
[1:27:00] to inject himself but as you die out and
[1:27:02] all the nervous side up move this way
[1:27:04] the movies had to move out there and go
[1:27:06] at a moving movies move out
[1:27:12] this presence in the individual with the
[1:27:16] personal vindication of himself
[1:27:18] expressing himself the living world that
[1:27:21] is promised itself through you it's not
[1:27:23] a group I'll take one I'll live one
[1:27:26] it's a nonce indication of a pragmatic
[1:27:30] child of God I'm longing for the
[1:27:32] Honorable to meet you and and create you
[1:27:35] and God bless you and they know your
[1:27:36] Christian they don't know what church
[1:27:39] you go into your Christian because of
[1:27:41] your life you're not a Christian or I go
[1:27:44] to church Christian because you have a
[1:27:47] testimony of Christ in fact in your life
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:27:55] so filled with the Holy Ghost but live
[1:27:58] in itself watch personal vindication
[1:27:59] it's an individual one person all hell
[1:28:03] is against this teaching all hell is
[1:28:04] like in this truth I own that musician
[1:28:06] talk please thank you Jesus
[1:28:10] the Lord is in the midst of his people

[1:28:21] play something softly verse seven he

[1:28:33] surrender to his will to his power he
[1:28:37] cannot break forth until he he have a
[1:28:39] heart so cleanse please draw me nearer

[1:28:44] until we have our hat so claim some
