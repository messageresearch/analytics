[0:00] Welcome tonight. God bless you all.
[0:04] Amen. Certainly glad to be here tonight
[0:06] one more time and thank God for his
[0:09] grace. Let's just bow our heads as we
[0:11] want to start in a word of prayer this
[0:13] evening and ask God's blessings upon us.
[0:16] Amen. As we enter into prayer and seek
[0:19] his face tonight. Amen. Heavenly Father,
[0:22] Lord, we we are grateful tonight, Lord,
[0:25] for your goodness and your mercy upon
[0:26] us, Lord, upon our lives, Father. You
[0:29] promise never to leave us, Lord, never
[0:32] to forsake us, Lord. Father, and we

[0:39] unfailing, Lord, and you are faithful to
[0:42] the end, Lord. And we know that you are

[1:34] the sharing of the word tonight, Lord,
[1:36] and your speaker tonight as you would
[1:37] come and minister, Lord. And may you
[1:39] bless him and anoint him and inspire him
[1:42] to say something tonight to us, Lord, an
[1:45] answer, Lord, Father, that we're
[1:46] seeking, Lord, to our hearts, Lord, that
[1:48] will help us along the way. Give us
[1:50] strength, Lord, for the journey. Uh,

[1:56] Christ's name, we pray and ask it. Amen
[1:59] and amen. Praise God. Why don't you just
[2:01] give him praise? Why don't you just give
[2:03] him glory? Why don't you just give him
[2:05] honor? Thank you, Jesus. Thank you,
[2:08] Father. Glory to God.
[2:10] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Let's lift
[2:13] your hands where you are and just begin

[9:52] fill this
[9:56] place.
[9:58] Amen. Amen. God bless you and thanks for
[10:01] being here tonight. Let's bow our heads
[10:02] for a prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank
[10:04] you for your presence tonight and the
[10:06] atmosphere of the Holy Spirit being here
[10:08] among us and live on homes, Lord. I pray
[10:11] that they take it Lord serious take it
[10:14] with a consciousness that we are
[10:16] privileged and honored to have you in
[10:18] our midst as brother Isaac preached some
[10:20] time ago about the ark being in
[10:23] someone's house for 3 months and how
[10:26] that ark was there and the blessings of
[10:28] God to be there and it's a privilege to
[10:30] host the presence of God it's a
[10:32] privilege to host your spirit to host
[10:35] your care your burden your concern to
[10:37] host that father God may to take us out
[10:40] of the way tonight. May you bless your
[10:42] people as they meditate on what will be
[10:44] spoken and shared. May you be with them
[10:46] in a special way. Help them in their
[10:48] decisions. Help them in their
[10:50] challenges. Help them in their health
[10:52] issues. Help them in their family
[10:54] issues. Help them in their marital
[10:56] issues. Granted, God, I ask in the name
[10:59] of Jesus. And father, I pray that you
[11:01] remember Unique Lopez granddaughter that
[11:04] your holy spirit will touch her with
[11:05] this kidney disease and may she be
[11:07] healed completely. And any person here
[11:08] needed a special touch on you tonight,
[11:11] have an unspoken request and they are
[11:12] dear, distrusting you, may you speak to
[11:15] them tonight in a special way by your
[11:17] word, by your truth. Granted, God in
[11:19] Jesus might ask it. Amen and amen. God
[11:21] bless you and thanks again for being
[11:23] here. And I want you to pay attention
[11:26] tonight. We have something upon our
[11:28] hearts we like to share with you. And I
[11:30] pray that God inspire it to you and by
[11:34] by God's grace. Tonight I want to read
[11:36] three portion of scripture from 2
[11:38] Corinthians
[11:39] 5:7, Romans
[11:42] 4:16-2, and Romans 1 verse 17. So 2
[11:47] Corinthians 5:7 says, "For we walk by
[11:51] faith, not by
[11:53] sight." For we walk by faith, not by
[11:55] sight. And that that's the title of the
[11:57] exhortation I want to give you tonight.
[11:59] We walk by faith and not by sight.
[12:01] Romans 4 reading from verse 16. The
[12:04] scripture we touched before but several
[12:06] times over the years but I want to take
[12:08] a peek at it again tonight because I
[12:10] feel it pertains to us and now in what
[12:14] we are going through. Therefore, it is
[12:16] of fate that it might be by grace to the
[12:19] end that the promise might be sure to
[12:21] all the seed, not to that only which is
[12:24] of the law, but to that also which is of
[12:27] the fate of Abraham, who is the father
[12:29] of us all. As it is written, I have made
[12:32] thee a father of many nations before him
[12:35] whom he believed, even God who quickenth
[12:38] the dead, and callth those things which
[12:41] be not as though they were. Note, God
[12:44] actually told him before Isaac was even
[12:46] born, I have made thee not a father of a
[12:50] child, but a father of many nation. I
[12:54] want you to think about the weight of
[12:55] that statement. not will make but I have
[12:59] made thee a father not of children but
[13:02] of many nation and the Bible says verse
[13:05] 18 who against hope believe in hope so
[13:08] there where you it this here catches
[13:11] everybody who's in depression who is in
[13:13] frustration who fed up who can't take it
[13:15] no more who against hope believe in hope
[13:18] that he might become the father of many
[13:19] nations according to that which was
[13:21] spoken so shall thy be and being not
[13:24] weak in faith this is the part. This is
[13:26] the key. And being not weak in faith,
[13:30] here's what he had to do. He considered
[13:32] not his own body now dead when he was
[13:35] about 100 years old, nearly at the
[13:37] steadiness of Sarah's womb. He staggered
[13:40] not at the promise of God through
[13:42] unbelief. So his feelings, what he's
[13:45] going through wasn't counted. The Bible
[13:47] record, he staggered not at the promise
[13:48] of God through unbelief, but was strong
[13:50] in faith, giving glory to God, and being
[13:52] fully persuaded. That's that's that's a
[13:55] the powerful thing right there. Being
[13:57] fully persuaded that what he had
[13:59] promised he was able also to perform and
[14:02] therefore it was imputed unto him for
[14:05] righteousness. Now it is not written for
[14:08] his sake alone that it was imputed to
[14:10] him but for us also to whom it shall be
[14:13] imputed. If we believe on him that
[14:17] raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead
[14:20] who was delivered for our offenses and
[14:22] was raised again for our justification.
[14:25] And our last scripture to read Romans
[14:27] 11:17 we familiar familiar scripture and
[14:30] for daring is the righteousness of God
[14:33] revealed from faith to fate and is
[14:36] written the just shall live by faith.
[14:39] May God bless his word.
[14:43] All right, let's go brother a message
[14:46] called fate by experience. Now usually
[14:49] we find most people are afraid to accept
[14:51] it. Usually people who have faith here
[14:54] we go is someone who has experienced
[14:57] faith. So faith is not something
[15:00] intellectual. Faith is something that
[15:02] you actually can experience. Now, when
[15:05] you accept Jesus as your personal
[15:07] savior, there's not a way in the world
[15:10] for you to ever be saved only by your
[15:13] faith. You had to act only only by your
[15:16] faith. You had to accept it. You had to
[15:19] believe it. Notice, you could get on the
[15:21] altar. Here we go tonight. You could get
[15:23] on the altar. You could cry all night
[15:25] long. You could beat upon the altar and
[15:28] scream until they could scream no more.
[15:31] And still you're not saved. You could
[15:34] feel real good run all over the building
[15:38] shouting and still not be safe. The
[15:41] devil can beat you around, stomp on your
[15:44] feeling. If I had to go by my feelings,
[15:48] there'll be many times I'll be all out
[15:50] of condition. But I don't rest on my
[15:53] feeling. I rest upon the unconditional
[15:56] word of the living God who made a
[15:58] covenant with me. If I could would
[16:01] believe it, it's not what I feel. It is
[16:03] what I believe. Jesus never said, "Did
[16:06] you feel it?" He said, "Did you believe
[16:08] it?" Faith happens. It is far beyond
[16:11] feeling. You could rest, feel tonight
[16:14] like you're saved, run around praising
[16:16] God, and next morning you wouldn't have
[16:17] any feeling about it at all. Then you
[16:19] say, "I'm lost again." But when faith
[16:22] takes a hold that Jesus Christ God's son
[16:26] died in yourstead and he become you in
[16:29] your sins that you in your sins might
[16:31] become him in his righteousness and
[16:34] accept him as your only propriation for
[16:37] your sins then faith takes a hold and
[16:40] all devils out of hell can't move it.
[16:43] Faith endures. Fate locks something. It
[16:47] seals something. And if a man has had
[16:51] faith to accept Christ, he walks up from
[16:54] the altar, he goes outside his associate
[16:57] and they say, "You haven't got nothing."
[16:59] So this is your friends, your family,
[17:00] neighbor trying to tell you, "You
[17:02] haven't got nothing. Why? Your eyes are
[17:05] still blue. That's the same suit you
[17:06] wear in there. Your nose is just as big
[17:09] as it was when you went in. Your
[17:10] fingerprints are all the same. There's
[17:12] no difference. But you know there is a
[17:14] difference. And in the ages to come and
[17:17] in the days and the weeks, you will
[17:19] prove there's a difference because your
[17:21] faith will vindicate that you are a
[17:24] Christian. How many knows that to be the
[17:26] truth? Every man and woman that ever
[17:29] accepted Christ if you will step out and
[17:32] trust your eternal destination upon your
[17:35] faith. How much more can you step out
[17:38] with that little body of yours upon the
[17:40] same atonement that he was wounded for
[17:42] transgression as with his stripes they
[17:45] were healed. So you can see clearly but
[17:47] the brand was challenging their faith to
[17:50] shift them to divine healing to shift
[17:53] them in a way where they could get that
[17:55] breakthrough that they deserve and he
[17:58] has to bring it by the scriptures and I
[18:00] am sensing tonight or I want to share
[18:03] with you tonight or somewhere along the
[18:05] line just as I am convinced in
[18:08] somebody's Christian walk they must come
[18:11] to the spot to say I am sorry please
[18:13] forgive me or to say I forgive give you.
[18:16] I don't believe that God will allow
[18:19] anyone to bypass that part of the road
[18:22] of Christianity. And in the same way, I
[18:25] want to present it that there's somehow
[18:29] there's got to get a way where we could
[18:32] get away from our own senses. Now, we
[18:34] live here in our senses or I could say
[18:37] this way, we live here in our flesh.
[18:40] What we fell from in the garden of Eden
[18:42] was this thing called fate which was the
[18:44] six sense which was the original sense
[18:47] that Adam was working with. So Adam was
[18:50] connected to what God said. He had
[18:53] nothing to do with anything contrary to
[18:55] what God said. Now if you notice what
[18:57] the devil did to Eve he what he asked
[19:00] her what did God say because he wanted
[19:02] to twist it. God is not speaking to him.
[19:05] He doesn't have the word. He needs to
[19:07] get to hear what God have said in order
[19:10] to twist it and throw off her fate. And
[19:12] that is what happened to Eve. When he
[19:14] got her to believe what it sh you shall
[19:17] not surely die, that brought her from in
[19:20] that fate realm into the flesh realm and
[19:23] that is where everything fell. So God
[19:27] have to get us out of our senses realm
[19:32] into this realm of faith and he chooses
[19:35] to take a man Abraham to bring something
[19:38] that is
[19:39] impossible by the eyes of man by Abraham
[19:43] own eyes and say you know what you old
[19:45] man you're going to have a son not only
[19:47] that you'll be a father of nations and
[19:50] God dropped that on this old man and
[19:52] walk away and the Bible said Abraham
[19:54] stacked not at the promise of God
[19:56] through unbelief. Now this original
[19:58] faith that that brother Brandon came to
[20:00] turn our hearts back to the faith of the
[20:02] fathers. This faith of the fathers is
[20:04] the same faith that Adam had is the same
[20:06] fate that was in the garden of Eden.
[20:08] This faith is what you could call the
[20:10] original faith. So this faith is not
[20:12] just uh when Paul was here. This faith
[20:16] goes way back. This is the faith of God.
[20:19] And this is the seed that God placed in
[20:22] you. The prophet said you are not the
[20:24] believer. The word is unbeliever. For
[20:26] you to step forward in salvation, step
[20:28] forward to receive Christ. It's an act
[20:30] of faith. It's a walk by faith. I'm
[20:32] challenged tonight to get out your
[20:33] senses to put your senses to one side to
[20:36] begin to believe what God have said. And
[20:39] in that light, I want to go back now and
[20:41] read that same scripture in Romans from
[20:44] Romans 4:1 16-2, but in the amplified.
[20:48] And I want to kind of go through and um
[20:50] see where what the Lord will do. So in
[20:53] verse 16, here we go. Therefore,
[20:57] inherited the promise is the outcome of
[21:00] faith and depends entirely on faith in
[21:04] order that it might be given as an act
[21:07] of grace, unmmerited favor to make it
[21:10] stable and valid and guaranteed to all
[21:13] his descendants. Not only to the
[21:15] devotees and inheritance of the law, but
[21:17] to those who share the fate of Abraham,
[21:20] who is the father of us all. So right
[21:22] away this faith that we are walking by
[21:24] tonight is directly connected to Abraham
[21:28] the father of us all because that is
[21:30] where the seed is at. Not seeds plural
[21:33] but seed which is Christ. So through
[21:36] Christ we connect to the original seed
[21:38] that Abraham had through Christ because
[21:41] we becomes Abra. We become Abraham's
[21:44] seed through faith. Do you see that
[21:46] tonight? Do you catch that tonight? All
[21:48] right let's go watch. As it is written,
[21:51] I have made you the father of many
[21:52] nations. He was appointed our father in
[21:55] the sight of God in whom we believe who
[21:57] gives life to the dead and speaks of the
[22:00] non-existent things and he has foretold
[22:02] and promised as it was already existed.
[22:05] For Abraham, listen to this, human
[22:08] reasoning for hope being
[22:10] gone, hoped in faith that he should
[22:14] become the father of many nations as he
[22:18] had promised. So numberless, so shall
[22:21] your descendant be. He did not weaken in
[22:24] fate, but he considered the utter
[22:26] importance of his own body, which was
[22:28] good as dead, because he was about 100
[22:31] years old. When he considered the
[22:33] aroness of Sarah's deaden womb, no
[22:36] unbelief or distrust made him weaver,
[22:40] doubting question considering the
[22:42] promise of God. But he grew strong and
[22:44] was empowered by faith as he give praise
[22:47] and glory to God. Fully satisfied and
[22:51] assured that God was able and mighty to
[22:53] keep his word to do what he had
[22:55] promised. That is why his faith was
[22:58] credit to him as righteousness. And this
[23:02] is where you get the just or we could
[23:04] say the justified truly lives by faith.
[23:07] That's why you hear me say certain
[23:09] things over and over and over and hope
[23:11] this sound like just repeating stuff.
[23:13] But I cannot understand a bride member a
[23:16] member of the bride of Jesus Christ
[23:18] holding and grudges when God has
[23:20] justified them. In other words, God has
[23:22] declared you to be righteous that you
[23:25] could have the confidence to approach
[23:27] God because that is what is about him.
[23:29] We were all sinners. But what Jesus did,
[23:31] he he he come and bring a covenant, a
[23:34] contract. He come and do something to
[23:36] give
[23:37] us that we could have words with our
[23:40] father. And that is what we're going to
[23:41] do here tonight to talk to him. That you
[23:43] can have words with your father and be
[23:45] reconciled to God. that's in the privacy
[23:47] of your home in your tent and meet you
[23:50] there right in that purple closet where
[23:52] you are tonight God could meet you there
[23:54] as a son as in daughter but you have to
[23:56] know your son and daughter it has to be
[23:58] a revelation to you ought to be an
[23:59] awareness and a cautious to you let's go
[24:01] ahead praise the lord time go all right
[24:06] this is a message called
[24:10] fellowship the only way you will ever
[24:13] appreciate or understand is to come back
[24:15] to fellowship with
[24:17] How can the carnal mind ever understand
[24:19] the things of God? They are foolishness.
[24:21] The Bible says again, he can't
[24:23] understand it. But the bornagain spirit
[24:25] doesn't reason it. It just believe it
[24:28] and act on it. Then he referred to
[24:30] Abraham. Abraham the father of the
[24:32] faithful. God told him when he was 65
[24:34] years old. His wife was 65. He was 75
[24:37] that they wouldn't have a baby. You
[24:39] imagine that? Could you imagine a man in
[24:40] Germany going down to a fine doctor to
[24:42] make room at the hospital? 75 years. his
[24:45] wife 65 living with her since he was 17.
[24:48] No children yet and says you are going
[24:51] to have one. And Abraham believed God.
[24:53] No matter what science says I believe
[24:55] God listen to this. 2 years no
[24:58] difference. 5 years no difference. What
[25:00] is your condition? What is your
[25:02] situation? 2 years no difference. 5
[25:04] years no difference. 10 years no
[25:05] difference. But Abram kept saying praise
[25:07] God I'm going to have it anyhow. God
[25:09] said so. That's a good reason to believe
[25:12] it. God said so. I could imagine he went
[25:14] in little napkins, pins, everything
[25:16] ready for God said no matter possible
[25:19] God said so that settled it. 20 years
[25:22] passed no baby yet. But Abraham still
[25:24] believed God. He got stronger. He kept
[25:26] giving God praise. Uhhuh. So you see the
[25:30] giving God praise is evidence of your
[25:32] strengthening faith. Isn't that
[25:34] something tonight? Let me repeat that
[25:35] again. You giving God praise is evidence
[25:39] of your faith being strengthened because
[25:42] it's evidence that you yourself is be
[25:44] are becoming say fully persuaded that
[25:46] what God promised to you he's able to
[25:49] keep. We're not talking about
[25:50] generalization
[25:52] uh you know God could heal everybody and
[25:54] God could bless everybody and God could
[25:56] heal anybody but we're not talking about
[25:58] anybody or everybody talking about you.
[26:00] Do you believe God could heal you? And
[26:04] when you look in the mirror, you alone
[26:05] could answer that. Do you believe God
[26:07] could deliver you? When you look in the
[26:09] mirror, only you could answer that. Do
[26:11] you believe God could fill you with the
[26:12] Holy Ghost or do you find yourself that
[26:14] you are unclean? You alone can answer
[26:16] that because if you're unclean, you have
[26:18] an opportunity to get by the blood to
[26:20] become clean. If you are not whole, you
[26:22] could get the opportunity to become
[26:23] whole. So when you really recognize when
[26:25] you look at it deeper then all this
[26:27] thing about what grandfather do and
[26:29] grandmother and when there was that
[26:30] childish happened that happened when you
[26:32] really take that and you really put that
[26:34] on the microscope of under faith all
[26:37] that cancel out everything you know if
[26:39] you become a Christian regardless
[26:41] whether your mother was this your mother
[26:42] was a drunkard and your father was a
[26:44] cocardic or whatn not that is irrelevant
[26:46] you know because your faith actually
[26:48] raises you above your past your faith is
[26:52] what will declare you to be righteous
[26:54] Your faith disconnect you from the past
[26:56] and put you into a present tense
[26:58] relationship with God full of confidence
[27:00] because the Bible said against hope he
[27:02] believe in hope. He believe his own body
[27:04] now dead. He examine himself and say
[27:06] listen you dead but guess what I'm going
[27:08] to have a baby anyhow. My wife B is dead
[27:10] guess what I have a baby anyhow. Could
[27:13] you talk like that in this hour 2025?
[27:16] Could you have the confidence that the
[27:18] God who start the work in you, he's able
[27:19] to complete it and you will come out
[27:21] your deadness, your sluggishness, your
[27:23] coldness, your formality, and you
[27:25] wouldn't have to be whipped up every
[27:26] service, whipped up for the song
[27:28] service, whipped up to praise God and
[27:29] worship, whipped up and whatnot. No, you
[27:32] coming from home with your fire because
[27:34] you're coming from home with your feet.
[27:36] You're coming from home with your
[27:37] expectation. You're coming from home
[27:39] built up. You're coming to add, not
[27:41] subtract. You're coming to add. You're
[27:43] not coming to draw down. You not like
[27:45] you like the woman the blood is you the
[27:46] message all these years and when you
[27:48] come you only come to draw down who
[27:51] is your withdrawal
[27:53] client. What kind of question is
[27:56] that? You can't say go have I none. You
[27:58] just yeah go I want I I I I need. Okay I
[28:04] could understand if you need this first
[28:05] Sunday, second Sunday, third Sunday but
[28:06] oh God a year pass you still need. Come
[28:08] on. Because this faith is granted uh
[28:12] faith come by hearing hearing the word
[28:13] what you're
[28:14] hearing. Now there's mental faith and
[28:16] there's spiritual faith and that's why
[28:18] devil fight the Holy Spirit operations
[28:20] of worship and atmosphere. They fight
[28:22] that people want to sit on the message
[28:24] and get it like that. But they can't get
[28:27] it like that. You have to walk by faith
[28:29] not by sight. And what I'm about to
[28:31] share with you would blow your mind. So
[28:33] let's listen a while. Okay. And we get
[28:34] on and pray. Let's listen to this.
[28:39] 20 years passed. No baby yet. Abraham
[28:41] still believed God. He got stronger. He
[28:43] kept giving God praise. Now, what would
[28:45] you do if you were prayed for tonight
[28:48] and tomorrow you wasn't well? You would
[28:51] say there's nothing to it. That shows
[28:53] you need to be born again. Abraham's
[28:56] children, Abraham children has the
[28:58] blessing, we being dead in Christ, take
[29:00] on Abraham's seed. Thus, that that gives
[29:03] every believer that's been born again,
[29:07] Here we go. the same faith that Abraham
[29:09] had to call what God said to be the
[29:12] truth and to call what you see with your
[29:16] eyes if it's contrary to God's promise
[29:18] to be a
[29:20] lie. We walk by faith. He said we don't
[29:25] go by sight. We don't walk by sight. We
[29:28] don't go by feelings. Hear it. All you
[29:30] feel inside here. All you feel in the
[29:33] church. We don't go by feelings. We go
[29:38] by God's word. No matter what the
[29:41] outside looks like, we believe it. All
[29:44] right, we're going good. Now, German
[29:47] people, listen just a moment. Look at
[29:51] Abraham when he offer up Isaac. He said,
[29:53] "You wait here while and the lad go
[29:55] yonder the land and I shall return."
[29:57] Praise God. How is he going to return?
[30:00] He's going to kill
[30:01] him. How can the lad return?
[30:04] Oh, listen. In his heart, this is
[30:07] Abraham's heart now. He knew that God
[30:10] was able to raise him up from the dead,
[30:13] for he had received him as one from the
[30:16] dead. My brother, sister, can't you
[30:19] understand now when God shows
[30:21] supernatural with his word, he expects
[30:24] you to believe it? He had promised
[30:26] Abraham and then he by supernatural had
[30:28] prove it to Abraham. And God said in
[30:31] these last days that he will pour out
[30:33] his spirit and he would show the same
[30:35] signs he did at the beginning. There'll
[30:37] to be a former and latter rain together.
[30:39] We are seeing it. We should believe with
[30:41] all our hearts. Here is his word. It
[30:43] proves it. His spirit comes nightly.
[30:46] Shows the supernatural knowing it's got
[30:48] to be the spirit now. He can't heal you.
[30:51] He wouldn't let me heal you. But that's
[30:53] his finished work. He already did that
[30:54] at Calvary. So he wants you to believe
[30:57] what he did that he did that for you.
[30:59] Here we go. If it is only the love of
[31:03] our father that loves us so much that he
[31:06] sends his word, he sends his ministers
[31:09] to preach the word, then he sends gifts
[31:11] into the church with his arms spread out
[31:14] trying to get you to believe it. He
[31:18] wants you healed tonight. Could somebody
[31:20] say amen out there? He wants you healed
[31:24] tonight. A thousand times more than you
[31:27] want to be healed. So, I not accepting,
[31:30] well, this is how I am. My father had it
[31:32] and my grandfather had it and my
[31:33] grandmother had it and my
[31:34] great-grandmother had it as a family
[31:37] thing. Don't make the devil thing a
[31:39] family thing. Don't make all kind of
[31:42] contrary sickness and diseases like if
[31:44] you're supposed to live with that. You
[31:46] have to begin to believe what God said.
[31:48] And this is what is bringing tonight. He
[31:50] wants you to heal you tonight a thousand
[31:54] times more than you want to be healed.
[31:57] and you are
[31:58] afraid. You go by how you feel. This is
[32:02] a message problem. This is a church
[32:04] problem. This is a believer problem. You
[32:06] go in by how you feel. What if we could
[32:09] get everybody to shake off your feelings
[32:12] tonight? Don't go by your feelings. Your
[32:14] whole life has been wrapped in that. But
[32:18] you must get away from that. Act on
[32:21] God's word. Not what you feel, not what
[32:25] you see, what God said. Act on that.
[32:28] Make a confession of that. Confess means
[32:32] to say the same thing. And he is at the
[32:34] right hand of the father with his own
[32:36] blood to make intercession on your
[32:39] confession. And here they bomb. Now he
[32:42] cannot do anything for you until first
[32:45] you accept it and confess it and then he
[32:49] can act on it. For he's an high priest
[32:51] of what you confess that he is to you.
[32:54] Do you get what I mean? What is he
[32:56] saying? If you want him to be a healer,
[32:59] you he cannot be a healer to you until
[33:02] you accept him as your healer and know
[33:04] that he's going to heal you and say,
[33:05] "Thank you, Lord, for healing me. I
[33:07] accept him as a healer." And then he
[33:09] could act on that. So, in other words,
[33:12] prayer become a vital tool in the
[33:15] ammunition of God's army to get a
[33:18] response from God.
[33:20] You know there are some of us we live
[33:22] such entitled lives as if because we
[33:25] believe or because we are Christian or
[33:27] because we go to church certain things
[33:29] supposed to work out and we don't
[33:31] understand that we ourselves have to act
[33:34] things out. That is why the Bible said
[33:37] the just shall live by it's not a mental
[33:40] activity by faith. The just shall live
[33:42] by faith because it's not it's going
[33:45] beyond thought now. It come be it comes
[33:47] to be alive because if it's a thought
[33:51] when you go by your feelings and
[33:52] emotions that whole thing shut down.
[33:54] Abraham shut down after you know he see
[33:56] this old woman I living with and I don't
[33:58] I don't have that already you know I
[34:00] sign this thing off. So he couldn't
[34:03] resign himself to that. His eyes seeing
[34:05] Sarah every day, you know, walk by
[34:07] Satan, not by sight. But it's not like
[34:09] if he have a a young picture in front of
[34:10] him of what Sarah will be, you know,
[34:13] he's seeing this age woman in front of
[34:14] him every single day for 20s something
[34:17] years. And he had to watch that and say,
[34:19] "That's a lie. That going to be changed.
[34:23] God will make the impossible possible. I
[34:26] want to hear we speak like that. I want
[34:28] to hear us talk like that. I want to
[34:29] hear us act like that. make the
[34:32] impossible possible. We are believing
[34:34] for impossible things. All things are
[34:36] possible to them that believe. We are
[34:38] believing that there's going to be a
[34:40] thirdful faith that not only will speak
[34:42] to the storm, but could speak to your
[34:44] loved ones, speak to your children,
[34:45] speak to your family, speak to them who
[34:47] rascals who want to do their own thing
[34:49] just like Lazarus. Lazarus come forth.
[34:51] We have to believe that it's not only
[34:53] for Jesus. It's not only for William
[34:55] Brandon. is for us also because we are
[34:58] part of this uh kingdom of of God.
[35:01] Kingdom of as I will say priests and
[35:03] kings. Let's first finish up a wrap at
[35:05] the
[35:06] end. Oh
[35:11] we God prophesied through the prophet
[35:14] and said I will write my laws in their
[35:17] hearts where I put them in the tables of
[35:20] their heart showing that that would be
[35:22] the dwelling place of God in the human
[35:24] heart.
[35:26] Not the human head but the human heart.
[35:29] I will write them in their heart and
[35:32] they will keep my statutes. God said
[35:34] another place in Ezekiel, I will in that
[35:37] day take out your old fleshly stony
[35:39] heart. I'll give you a new spirit. I'll
[35:42] put my spirit in you. Now a lot of
[35:45] people even you Pentecostal people lots
[35:48] of time get mistaken in that you get a
[35:50] new spirit that is not God's spirit.
[35:52] That is you. That isn't God. You get a
[35:56] little happy because you got a new
[35:58] spirit. You jump up and down, run around
[36:00] the floor, shout a little bit, speak
[36:02] with tongues, run around a little bit,
[36:04] think you got the Holy Ghost. That's not
[36:05] it. That's a new spirit. That's you.
[36:08] Then after he gave you your spirit, then
[36:11] he said, "I'll put my spirit." Now, that
[36:13] is the matter today. Notice, here we go.
[36:17] Put a new spirit.
[36:20] God has to give you a new spirit or you
[36:25] wouldn't you couldn't get along with
[36:28] him. You can't get along with yourself
[36:32] that old devil spirit in you had in you.
[36:35] So he got to put a new spirit in you so
[36:39] you can get along with his
[36:41] spirit. Now this I could stop here
[36:44] tonight and I could spend the next half
[36:45] an hour on that because there are so
[36:47] much bad behaved Christians. I have
[36:49] encountered ministers. I wonder if some
[36:50] of them even saved with their behavior
[36:53] gift and talking at the pulpit and
[36:54] sharing word that just one part of it.
[36:58] But that is not all of it. You have it
[37:00] it have a it have to have a life behind
[37:02] that. And God is concerned about the
[37:05] life behind gifts not just the gift. We
[37:08] could say the gift is God. Uh he give
[37:10] gifts. is perfect and perfect gift and
[37:12] whatn not but the life behind the gift
[37:15] is more important than the gift itself
[37:18] because we have seen gifts ruined by bad
[37:21] life poor life terrible life and God
[37:24] want gift that is have correct life
[37:27] because the Pentecostal that was the
[37:29] problem they didn't have the life the
[37:31] life was in the word and they turned on
[37:32] the word they rejected the prophet they
[37:34] end up in gifts and they're still in
[37:35] trouble today so do you get what I'm
[37:37] saying there so God want us to have a
[37:39] life of the word which is life of faith.
[37:42] Now it's not I don't want to ask which
[37:44] one come first the chicken or the egg
[37:46] but the reality is this Abraham
[37:48] testimony of faith or life of faith was
[37:52] before he got that seal of
[37:55] circumcision. So you cannot say when I
[37:57] get the Holy Ghost I will walk by faith.
[38:00] No you walk by faith as you hear the
[38:02] word. You walk by faith because you
[38:04] believe the word. You walk by faith
[38:05] because you're acting on the word. And I
[38:06] could prove to you and show you all
[38:08] through the Old Testament, those
[38:10] believers, those brothers, they walked
[38:11] by faith, trusting God, believed in God.
[38:15] When Joseph was was was betrayed by his
[38:17] brothers and sold out to Egyptians and
[38:20] so on, Joseph had to live a life of
[38:21] faith. Joseph could sit down and say, "I
[38:23] ain't studying nothing. I learn the
[38:25] language. I keep my language. I keep my
[38:26] tongue. I ain't working. I doing
[38:28] nothing. Vex are depressed. I'm
[38:30] frustrated." And Joseph say, "No, no.
[38:33] Joseph choose to educate himself. You
[38:35] choose to be smart,
[38:38] sharp. So Joseph say, "I ain't going to
[38:40] be a duny head. I ain't going be like
[38:42] ignorant." No, he sharpened himself. He
[38:46] applied himself. He worked diligently.
[38:49] It was so impressive. He got promotion
[38:52] because of his quality of
[38:54] work. He got promoted so high. The man
[38:57] say, "Listen, you're in charge of
[38:58] everything except my wife." The wife
[39:00] wanted Joseph to be in charge of her
[39:02] too. So said, "No, I ain't coming here
[39:03] for that job.
[39:05] and Judah end up in prison because he a
[39:07] want to submit to her and prison is
[39:11] where God wanted him. Now if you have a
[39:14] problem with your feelings and God hit
[39:17] you a prison trouble because you see
[39:20] Joseph had an anchor revelation that God
[39:22] can't lie and God can't fail. Joseph
[39:26] anchor revelation made him blessed even
[39:28] in prison and he had to wait there until
[39:31] they sent for him. a prisoner. They sent
[39:34] for him a jailb bird. They sent for him
[39:36] a man wrongly arrested. They sent for
[39:38] that same man because God ordained that
[39:40] man to be used of him. Do you know that
[39:43] God ordained you to be used of you? That
[39:45] God want to use you. Do you believe
[39:47] that? I want to challenge your faith
[39:49] tonight. I want to rock you inside your
[39:51] home tonight. I want to when you finish
[39:53] here tonight, you must feel
[39:54] uncomfortable with you and say, you know
[39:56] what, regardless of how people see me,
[39:59] all my family see me, God, you see me a
[40:01] certain way. You know me a certain way.
[40:03] And let me drop this scripture. You
[40:04] shall know as you are
[40:07] known. What do we say? You shall know as
[40:10] you are known. God see you a certain
[40:12] way. Way you see yourself like Gideon.
[40:14] God say mighty man of valor. But Gideon
[40:16] he wasn't seeing himself that way. But
[40:18] God saw Gideon a certain way. And I'm
[40:20] saying to you tonight, God see you a
[40:22] certain way. You have faith tonight. I
[40:24] want you to believe that with all your
[40:25] heart. Besides your mistakes, failures,
[40:27] shortcomings, and failures, you have
[40:28] faith in your heart tonight. All right.
[40:30] Woo. Time, time, time. Good Lord, help
[40:33] me Jesus. I'll put a new spirit with
[40:35] you. I'll put my spirit in them. He said
[40:38] after he gave you a new spirit, that is
[40:40] you. Don't get it confused with God's
[40:43] spirit. It is not. It is your new spirit
[40:47] so you can get along with the Holy
[40:49] Spirit. So God say respect your husband,
[40:52] honor your husband. You want to carry on
[40:55] and carry on and carry on.
[40:58] How could you as a wife agree with God's
[41:03] spirit when you can't even harmonize
[41:04] with that little piece of word
[41:07] respects? I know you go and beat up
[41:10] Satan and fight and wrestle in the den
[41:11] and face lion and all kind of thing like
[41:13] that. That just respect husband love
[41:16] your wives. That just the word wives
[41:18] submit yourself to your husband. That's
[41:19] just the word. I know big drama. So, I'm
[41:23] showing you, and I know I don't hear
[41:24] this much in the message, but the new
[41:26] spirit is to give you something that
[41:29] could work with the Holy Spirit. What
[41:31] does that mean? That means the sinner
[41:34] spirit can't work with the Holy
[41:36] Ghost. That's why he say, "A new heart,
[41:38] I'll give you a heart towards God. A new
[41:40] spirit, I'll give you a spirit that will
[41:42] work with the Holy Spirit." So when you
[41:44] get a new spirit, you now could get an
[41:47] antenna, a a tune in to the Holy Ghost
[41:51] because the Holy Ghost is God himself.
[41:53] Oh, let me see. I wrap up and close now
[41:55] going on and on and on. So watch cause
[41:58] in the condition you never get along.
[42:00] You can't get along with your wife. Look
[42:01] at the problem right here. Look at right
[42:03] here. You need you need a new spirit.
[42:06] You can't get along with your wife. You
[42:08] can't get along with your husband. You
[42:10] can't get along with your neighbor. How
[42:12] are you going to get along with God? So
[42:15] he has to give you a new spirit before
[42:19] you can get along with him. So he puts a
[42:22] new spirit in you and then he puts his
[42:25] spirit in you and give you a new spirit,
[42:28] a new outlook, a new feet. Then he puts
[42:31] his holy spirit in
[42:33] you. Oh my. Let's continue.
[42:37] So he talk about
[42:42] um and he said brother Brandham didn't
[42:44] didn't know me. He called all the way up
[42:46] for the balcony somewhere sir you have
[42:48] prostrate trouble sitting here and he
[42:50] told him who he was where he was from he
[42:52] said every bit of it was truth he told
[42:54] me you are healed and Dr. Tur said to
[42:56] him was you healed says yes sir for a
[42:59] year I wasn't bothered with it at all
[43:01] and you know what the thing come back on
[43:03] me Mr. church said that proves he is
[43:06] false. Said if God healed they stay
[43:09] healed. I would like to see how many of
[43:12] these Nazarines that got sanified one
[43:14] year the next year was back for
[43:16] sanication again. I thought he kept it.
[43:18] I thought you couldn't hold back. Oh
[43:20] brother, some men are so narrow-minded.
[43:22] Listen. Listen what he's saying here
[43:23] now. You could put a pencil between
[43:25] their eyes and it'll blind them. That is
[43:27] right. So narrowsighted. Salvation
[43:30] lasts. Here we go. As long as faith
[43:32] lasts. Divine healing lasts as long as
[43:35] your faith lasts. That you got to
[43:37] experience 40 years ago. You forget you
[43:40] ever had that experience and you go out
[43:42] there tonight and say, "I don't even
[43:43] believe in it. I'm not God's servant no
[43:46] more." Watch how long your experience
[43:49] lasts. When an unclean spirit gone out
[43:51] of a man, he walks in dry places. He
[43:54] comes back with seven other spirits
[43:55] worse than he was. He enters in by
[43:57] force. And if a good man of the house
[44:00] ain't there to keep him out, you don't
[44:03] go by your feelings. I never was saved
[44:05] by my feelings. Here we go, church.
[44:07] Brother, I never was saved by my
[44:10] feelings. I was wasn't saved because I
[44:13] felt good. I am saved because I met
[44:15] God's promise. That's right. The devil
[44:17] can beat you down the stump on feelings,
[44:20] but he cannot speak on dust yet alone
[44:22] and condemn it. Praise God. And I'm
[44:26] finished. When my brothers turned me
[44:28] down for a few days more of living about
[44:31] six or seven years ago, I'm healthy and
[44:33] strong tonight because I believe God
[44:35] said so. I took him at his word. It's
[44:38] your faith in God. The only thing that
[44:40] will start that's the only thing that
[44:42] will ever heal a sick person is their
[44:45] personal faith in God. Not what some man
[44:48] can do for you. Is what the man Christ
[44:51] Jesus has already done for you and you
[44:53] accept it. Here we go. I'm closing. Last
[44:56] words, you refuse to see symptoms or
[44:59] anything else. You walk by faith. The
[45:02] just shall live by it. The just shall
[45:06] live by faith tonight. So I trust
[45:07] tonight that this will get to you. It's
[45:09] not the screams, not the shouts, not the
[45:11] holler. Is something that anchored in
[45:14] your soul. I feel tonight is a special
[45:15] night. I feel God will bless you
[45:18] tonight. I come here in a great
[45:19] expectation. I don't know what are your
[45:20] needs. As I said, I'm not in psychology
[45:22] or psychiatry and what is your problem
[45:24] and why Mexican make when he was young
[45:26] and you know young again. All these
[45:29] things irrelevant when they come to this
[45:30] thing called faith because faith doesn't
[45:32] consider anything else but what God
[45:34] said. And if God want you free, that's
[45:37] what you must want. What God wants. If
[45:39] God wants you to deliver, that's what
[45:41] you must want. If God want you filled
[45:42] with the Holy Ghost, Peter, full of the
[45:44] Holy Ghost. Andrew, full of the Holy
[45:45] Ghost. You want to be full of the Holy
[45:46] Ghost. That's what you must desire in
[45:48] your heart. The devil's a liar tonight.
[45:51] We live in this five senses and we are
[45:54] against these these these other senses.
[45:56] We we to connect with the six sense of
[45:59] faith. But ramp preach a message about
[46:01] the six sense. It's a sense of God.
[46:03] Something you can't explain but you just
[46:05] know it is God. Something working inside
[46:07] of you that going to work out. You can't
[46:09] explain it. There's a lot of stress, a
[46:11] lot of things around you. Moses at the
[46:14] Red Sea, Pharaoh coming for him.
[46:16] Mountain on both sides. Where do you go?
[46:18] You look to God and God say go forward.
[46:20] Where? Into the sea. Yes. Because he
[46:23] going to make a way right where is
[46:24] impossible. Into the sea. We want to
[46:27] walk where God want us to walk. He say
[46:29] into the sea. Yes. Into the seat. Into
[46:32] danger. Yes. Wherever. There are lions
[46:34] out there. It doesn't matter. As long as
[46:35] God is with us, he could take us
[46:36] through. Let's go on this. Heavenly
[46:38] Father, I thank you tonight for your
[46:39] presence in your spirit. And we feel
[46:41] empowered tonight to share these things
[46:42] in faith. The people have to have faith
[46:44] to move forward. Lord, they cannot go on
[46:46] their past and the history. There's so
[46:47] much people love history. love what God
[46:49] used and how God dealt with them 20, 40,
[46:51] 50 years ago, but they have no testimony
[46:53] right now. Struggling right now because
[46:55] the right now needs now faith is right
[46:57] now needs a president's reality. We live
[47:00] by faith. We walk by faith. We don't
[47:02] walk by sight. We don't walk by
[47:03] feelings. We come by faith tonight.
[47:05] There's going to be a bright revival.
[47:06] Our faith says so. Our faith declares
[47:09] there's going to be a seventh revival.
[47:11] There's going to be a manifestation of
[47:12] God that will stir the bright. There's
[47:14] going to be signs and wonders and
[47:15] miracles. Our faith stays so. We don't
[47:16] have to wait for feelings and emotions.
[47:18] We don't have to wait until every
[47:19] condition is right and the atmosphere is
[47:21] right. We could speak it and declare it
[47:23] and believe it because you said it.
[47:24] Father, bless the people tonight as they
[47:26] got in prayer. Lord, may faith rise in
[47:28] their souls and may a pillar of fire
[47:30] come into their homes and meet them in
[47:32] there. Meet them in that little room, in
[47:34] that prayer closet. Meet them in their
[47:35] prayer need points. May they not go by
[47:37] feelings and emotions and begging God in
[47:40] that kind of a way in all their flesh
[47:41] and their human spirit. But may by
[47:43] revelation, Father, they take a hold of
[47:45] your word and say, "God, you promise
[47:47] deliverance. You promise healing. You
[47:48] promise restoration. You promise
[47:50] forgiveness. You promise cleansing. You
[47:52] promise a new heart, a new spirit, your
[47:53] spirit. Grant it tonight, Lord. Send a
[47:55] revival in my soul. Quicken me, Father.
[47:58] I want to reach Sunday service
[47:59] empowered. I want to go service and to
[48:01] contribute something. Father, to add to
[48:03] the service. I want to put fire on top
[48:05] of fire. Oh God, I want to come not to
[48:06] draw down, but to add to that, that we
[48:08] going to have a bonfire this coming
[48:10] Sunday. Bless the coming Sunday service.
[48:12] Bless the people as they're going in
[48:13] prayer tonight. In Jesus name I ask it.
[48:15] Amen. Amen. God bless you as you're
[48:17] getting in prayer. I pray that God will
[48:18] be with you and inspire you in your time
[48:21] with the Lord tonight. God bless you.
[48:23] God be with you. Praise God.

[1:29:44] Lord. Thank you oh God your commitment
[1:29:46] to this the last day entering bride
[1:29:48] church. How we thank you Lord for your
[1:29:50] spirit moving. How we thank you for your
[1:29:51] spirit unfolding. How we thank you Lord
[1:29:53] for coming confirming your word with
[1:29:55] signs and wonders and miracles. How we
[1:29:57] thank you. You haven't abandoned us nor
[1:29:58] forsaken us but you have sent light in
[1:30:00] our path that we could follow through
[1:30:02] with your word. Thank you Lord. Thank
[1:30:03] you Lord for your presence Lord. Thank
[1:30:05] you Lord for your spirit. Lead us and
[1:30:07] guide us. We await you father. We await
[1:30:09] your spirit. Send the anointing upon the
[1:30:11] elders upon the deacon upon the trustees
[1:30:13] upon the believers. Father, from the
[1:30:15] purpose of the backbench, Father God. Oh
[1:30:17] God, may you just look over the church.
[1:30:19] Look over your people as they struggle
[1:30:20] through life as they struggle through
[1:30:22] the journey. Father, this greatest
[1:30:24] battle ever fought between the five
[1:30:26] senses and the six sense of faith. And
[1:30:28] that sense is what you want to rule us
[1:30:31] and to guide us with. Father, this six
[1:30:32] sense of faith to trust you, to trust
[1:30:34] your word, to trust your promises that
[1:30:36] you fulfilling, Father. And just as the
[1:30:38] prophets in the 50s could prophesy when
[1:30:40] they take the pope out of America. And
[1:30:42] Lord, they just have to wait until time
[1:30:44] unfolds for materialize. Each promise
[1:30:48] have a time and a season. And father
[1:30:50] God, may we await it with great
[1:30:52] expectation of your coming, Father. And
[1:30:54] as you said in your word, your appearing
[1:30:56] among us is a sign of your coming. So we
[1:30:59] look for that appearance, Lord, that
[1:31:00] you're going to move in and out among
[1:31:02] us, Lord, delivering, healing,
[1:31:04] restoring, baptizing, rescuing. Oh God,
[1:31:07] start the work tonight. Start the work
[1:31:09] in the homes of your children. Start the
[1:31:11] home work in the homes of your people.
[1:31:13] May they see the importance of the
[1:31:15] connection of talking to you and
[1:31:17] fellowship with you and praying and
[1:31:18] crying out, believing just as Peter, oh
[1:31:21] God, was in prison and the church in one
[1:31:23] mind, one accord begin to cry out unto
[1:31:25] God on his behalf. And based upon their
[1:31:27] crying out, based upon their
[1:31:28] communication and fellowship, great
[1:31:30] deliverance was wrought. Father, may we
[1:31:32] begin to see that same thing as the
[1:31:33] believers cry out in one mind, one
[1:31:35] accord, believing that you would work
[1:31:37] among us and we'll fulfill your word,
[1:31:39] Lord. And we would just sit down
[1:31:41] intellectually, but we participatories
[1:31:43] of your word, acting on your word, and
[1:31:45] walking in the same feet as Abraham.
[1:31:46] Bless your people tonight. I commit
[1:31:48] their lives into your hands, their walk
[1:31:49] and talk and action into your hands in
[1:31:51] Jesus name I ask it. Amen. God bless you
[1:31:54] saints. Thanks again for being here
[1:31:55] tonight. I trust that you are blessed
[1:31:57] tonight. or bless you.
