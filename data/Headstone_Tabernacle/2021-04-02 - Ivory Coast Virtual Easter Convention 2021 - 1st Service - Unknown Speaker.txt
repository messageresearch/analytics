you you might receive one more time amen as they come god bless you amen the manifestation of the sons of god is aware in the garden of eden what is subject what a title this is a virtual convention cedar is hosted by our precious brother on enchika in ivory coast and we greet everybody we agree the people that i can see and the people that i cannot see i greet you in the name of jesus christ he is alive hallelujah and nothing can hold us to be alive also hallelujah and i have a for a short greeting a title come with me to a glorious eternity we all want such a breakthrough we all want that heaven opens is it true we once said jesus christ becomes such a reality said we have no other thought anymore just him and what he brings this is what we want and uh when we know the devil by his tricks how he can try to stop this to stop this when we know it then we can act upon what we know to defeat him so we break the curtains of unbelief now how can we get unbelievable this wall of unbelief is reasoning trying to understand the gospel by head knowledge education by explaining the gospel is a stimulation of heavenly thoughts out of eternal attributes expressed in an earthly language i'll give you an example jesus said in saint john 6 56 in the synagogue in capernaum he said it is my flesh and drink as my blood dwells in me and i in him and continued in verse 63 the words that i speak unto you see our spirit and they are life how can we explain to our reasoning powers to drink the blood of jesus christ but if you believe it said he is came from heaven jesus came from heaven the bread of life and the life-giver is in him his life was in his divine blood and if you start to believe it and then we can we can take it in us like jesus said we drink it with our chest it and and it changes us it moves it starts to move us it starts to move us away from this world away from our sins away into these heavenly places where we come from and jesus is coming quick and the holy spirit is coming quick he passes he passes this reasoning this these thoughts that are coming he puzzles this and says here i am i am say i'm i'm your satisfying portion i'm your life so let's let's keep this the gospel is a stimulation of heavenly thoughts out of eternal attributes expressed in an earthly language so he breaks the curtains of unbelief reasoning head knowledge and start to think his thoughts it's his word we swear we we just believe it we don't we don't try to understand we just believe what he says i love you how can you understand it said he loves you what he says in his word he loves me so i he loves me i am a lovely one it takes all the fear out see just every word what comes from the bible and we confess our unbelief and we drink his blood and eat his flesh means receive his the bread of life from heaven and and the contents the divine life the divine nature it's a divine spirit and we drink it and we we get changed it transmits us from this world and we find immediately that said it brings us across that unbelief that wall that curtain said chasm that stands between us in the presence of the lord we want the presence of god don't we and and there's and if we can just overcome this wall of unbelief because in his presence as i said come with me to a glorious eternity stop thinking when you come in his presence bring your your burdens to him don't think about them oh how how bad it is just bring it to him and the blood transmits our sins away from us and brings us across that chasm into the presence of god and the prophet said and only then see jesus is only it's not an alternative way it's not an option it's the only way only sin we realize jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever jesus is the same yesterday today and forever is an experience and when you have it you can speak it under this inspiration of this experience his peace his joy comes with me into a glorious eternity this heals the body of christ we are coming into eden condition the manifestation of the sons of god that's the subject in an eden condition waiting for us see these attributes are waiting for us when you when you enter this place sin it comes alive and you get a confirmation by an experience it is really so my soul comes from god and voice in god always and will always be in god god has ordained this glory for us and we are elected for this glory hallelujah from far before the foundation of the world paul said i am determined not to know anything see not any thought not anything among you you may tell me this said or that i am determined not to know anything save jesus christ and him crucify it because in in that realm he lived in the kingdom of god justified holy redeemed connected with eternity what a salvation or that everlasting life what a blissful blissfulness words fail we are so blessed said we have you precious brothers and ministers speaking to us again from your heart stimulated telling us your experience telling us how you got lit how your candle got lit and we believe our candle will also get lit when you tell us how you get lit preach demonstrate testify how he was lifted up into this marvel light and that will cause us to listen to your voice i'm finishing may this convention bring the bride closer to that experience the turn head on the isle of patmos john heard his voice but it was not to finish when he heard his voice in revelation 1 he turned to see his voice so you have to you have to make a turn breaks this down of this this wall of unbelief down breaks that curtain for the prophets prophesied one day this curtain will drop back will open and god will shower down abundantly his spirit so we have to exercise it for the great break when even our our body will will obey his voice hallelujah we have to exercise it and sean did he heard his voice and then he he was satisfied with this he turned to see his voice and then he saw it he saw him standing and then he went into the spirit of his voice come episode revelation 4 and 5 and finally revelation 10 he became his voice this is our pride promise this is our bright promise to be taken in this wonderful glorious eden inspiration in this eden land where where where the stream of life is flowing is flowing through us and in us and out of us and out of you as a big stream when we coming together and the glory is coming down oh i am so

prayer today is as our prophet often said i'd like to say something that'll help you that's all i want to do shall we stand to our feet as we go to the word today as you've seen from uh the the the title of the slide i'm i'm picking up on the inspiration amen the manifestation of the sons of god as it was in eden and i pray that these few words will help you is my prayer and uh translating me today we appreciate brother junior the vega and uh we know that uh the french will hear very well and i believe spanish is being done separately we appreciate those translators as well praise the lord so we just want to say back to eden and greetings to the convention at easter and we go straight away to genesis 3 9. and it reads and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where are thou amen a great question amen romans 8 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god 2 corinthians 11 3 but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ so this subtlety was not confined to eden paul said it's still going on keep it simple stay focused on jesus christ amen and 1 john 3 2. beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is amen we start in genesis let's finish in revelation in chapter 5 verse 10. thou and hast made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth amen let's buy our heads in prayer lord in the name of jesus christ we thank you for this prophet that will take us further than azusa street and even further than pentecost right back to the garden of eden lord where we started how i thank you lord jesus for these promises and lord we receive them and we know that god cannot lie amen lord jesus we know that man doesn't seek god it's god that seeks man and throughout this convention lord may you seek your people may you call them wherever they are if they're hiding lord if they're running if they're backslidden may you call them and ask them where are you adam bless every heart in jesus christ's name amen and amen you can be seated saints and online god bless you so much amen eden what was eden we are left wondering uh concerning the geographical location but the the thing i'm talking about today what eden was in by way of his presence it was a meeting place of heaven and earth and when it got out of cater whatever was there just became ground it just became earth and that glory it separated eden was uh like a county you know uh brother brown said and and nod was another county next door so when you left eden and went to nod it was just like changing counties it's like changing from new york to new jersey it was just changing into different territories the real point is that god was in eden it was a paradise it was a mixture of heaven and earth and when you see heaven and earth coming together again a restored eden has begun praise the lord forever amen amen god be praised today let us go to some slides as we uh study the inspiration that pastor paul has brought to us god above us in the father with us in the sun cleansing his way condescending coming down making a way for me to get back and to bring his people that's all of us back to manifested sons of god like they had them in the garden of eden that's what we're talking about to bring that back amen not just back to the altar not just back to pentecost but back to eden praise the lord the whole world is groaning thank you pastor for this great inspiration and we give god the glory that we have this hope in view that we can make it if we believe it praise the lord amen we're going to make it by his grace as many as receive him gave he power to become the sons of god blessed be the name of the lord it is that power to become that we are preaching we won't get there by legalism we'll get there by the power of the holy ghost what power transformation power amen let me explain how this is going to happen i thank god for this message because these are the seeds that we have in our hands we praise god that we are listening to them that we are hearing them that we are studying them amen listen to these great words now from satan's eden having faith in all his word and his seeds brought an eden amen of holiness love and eternal life that's what god's eden produced holiness it brought an eden of holiness love understanding perfection and eternal life amen does that sound right to you hallelujah that's what happens when you have faith in all his word but when you drop a word satan has beguiled you even if you don't understand it just say amen to it it will bring an eden blessed be the name of the lord and are you ready for the bombshell that's what god is planting his word and his seed that's what he's doing now that's what his church [Music] will be at the end if you believe that shout amen that's what his church will be at the end why because we have faith in all his word blessed be the name of the lord amen god keeps his word amen and it will be the same thing praise be to god all this message is the seeds of god that's what's going to happen it's going to bring forth of its kind and there shall be more sons of god in fact the scripture says now are we the sons of god and i hope to show you eden is not something historical but it is very real it's when heaven meets with the earth let's talk about it today amen this is a very powerful quotation from the church age book it would take an hour to to unpack this quotation he says but god will prepare his holy mountain amen his new garden of eden for the bride and his and her attendance what a great thing this is how long did it take god it took him six thousand years to build his eden it took satan another six thousand years to build his eden but god said because you broke my eden i will break your eden praise be to god and uh for a thousand year honeymoon as adam and eve were in the garden and did not finish out the thousand years amen now jesus our last adam and his eve true church can we all say true church will fulfill or the plan of god amen that last thousand years will happen by his true church blessed be the name of the lord so something is fixing to happen going to do it god's going to do it amen glory to god it is the lord's doing what happened everything back there obeyed item because everything obeyed adam because adam obeyed everything that's good he obeyed everything so everything obeyed him but when he stopped obeying he lost his power he lost control over himself and then the earth became infected amen and the ground was cursed everything obeyed adam that is the beginning of man that's what god give him power over everything on the earth now through the fall he lost that power amen and then he becomes unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and his friendship amen fellowship with the father amen and that's what we're thirsting for fellowship with the father more than anything else more than even success we are thirsting for fellowship hallelujah with our god and our father he says he lost that he became unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship and fellowship with god all of his great channels they became clogged amen he couldn't get through and what adam was in god christ has redeemed us back to that amen amen he has redeemed us back to that now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its origin hallelujah not just back to pentecost that's on the way but right back to eden does that sound correct amen that is the message blessed be the name of the lord amen and there are three uh foes that the prophet has revealed amen he says we are on our way back to the original eden restore restoring back his bride and fellowship number one oh that was in god he poured into christ number one number two all that was in christ he poured into his bride amen and uh number three back to eden praise belo god so that's where we're going back he says and as husband and wife restoring back his bride in fellowship back with god as husband and wife in the garden of eden christ and his bride they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain my right back to eden again as hard as it can go imagine running hard as hard as you can go amen there is the threefold purpose amen oh god help us to know it help us to know it my not just about christianity amen it's not a club it's going back to eden help us to know it lord help us to know it in the same vein as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions my where you can say squirrels sun come out and shine amen before the doctor's hand touches my wife hey man what do you want happy little fishy i'll give you your life this is speaking conditions as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions to a place that he can flow himself and love and persuade and fellowship there will come an eden he'll take his church back to where it left him at eden again where it fell i love speaking conditions when you speak to that storm that's what you're supposed to do when you speak to that problem that is what you should be doing to bring you back to that blessed be the name of the lord that is that is where we're going and nothing can stop it nothing can block you i'm going to prove that to you now he says because he says when jesus ascended something happened and he says so little is spoken but his ascension when he went from earth up to heaven amen the ascension he says it's one of the greatest days when he ascended up because all over the earth since the day in the garden of eden that sin was committed since that day satan is the prince of the power of the air so where there used to be a connection now satan is the prince of the power of the air this channel became closed amen it was blocked amen all all since the day since that day in the garden of eden all heavens shut off he said that's right no man could see his glory no man could understand because the power is just above us heavens means atmosphere above and all these powers from mankind because of sin my there was a closure is closed you cannot go through there but then something happened amen when he rose from the dead that morning that was his own blood amen as high priest normally a high priest sprinkles the blood of an animal sprinkle holy holy holy the high priest but this blood was not the blood of an of our sheep it was not the blood of a an animal it was his own blood he was sprinkling his own blood my what demon to say oh stop amen they couldn't say it he was sprinkling his own blood hey man he went beyond as high priest he had his own blood he went beyond the veils he broke through every sphere because satan in times past he had men blocked from heaven no block block block blocked from heaven he could not get in contact with heaven now we can [Music] now we can now you can now the young people can it's been unblocked amen amen jesus is the real blockbuster hallelujah hey man glory to god he's the real one praise the lord amen when jesus took his own blood the first veil of death the grave the veil in the temple the veil of sickness the veil of fear every veil that was unveiled god to man hallelujah that was his ascension hey then sprinkling with his own blood what demon is going to stop that he is the mighty conqueror praise god when he ascended upon high hallelujah oh what a day that was with his own blood sprinkling sprinkling what happened he made a channel all above he opened the channel that god used god used this channel to come down through the corridors of heaven today with coronavirus two countries france england we have a travel corridor that you can travel to france because it's all agreed france can travel to england you understand these things travel corridor thank god there is a travel corridor from heaven to earth there's a travel corridor amen he says that god used to come down this travel corridor through the corridors of heaven and hand and he used to come down and talk to man in the garden of the eden amen in the in the in the evening jesus god would come down the corridor and have fellowship with adam then he would go back up then he would come down and talk to adam and eve then he would go back up the corridor the travel corridor from earth to heaven amen but that was blocked but because of his blood that corridor is now freed amen when you pray god can come down heaven came down and glory filled my soul hallelujah he can come down that corridor and have fellowship with you my and talk to mankind in the garden of eden satan had by sin blocked them but this high priest with his anointed with his blood went through every veil amen that god and man could be father and son and commune again with one another hallelujah heaven aren't you glad that there is now a hole in the sky hallelujah hey man oh i feel like preaching on that one there's something in the sky hallelujah that we can go down those channels i believe those seven angels they came down that channel they came down that corridor to fellowship with man and to break those seven seals that we could go back to eden what a great travel corridor that is that a god could be a father and son can commune praise be to god what do we say to these things he says now we're at the evening time this is not uh sardis this is not philadelphia this is not just pentecost the shock now we're at the evening time the earthly body is ready to be dissolved and we're preparing amen preparing to enter into the heavenly and we now feel uh the strange call of god how many knows that strange call of god we may not understand it but it's a strange call of god amen samuel he's a samuel samuel don't go to eli this is god calling you samuel the strange call of god samuel samuel i'm going to do something samuel amen a strange call of god to go to the street eden we we feel it we feel like speaking the word and we we feel like saying my family shall be saved the strange call of eden hallelujah strange call to go to this eden praise be to god it's a reality amen but but but man was blocked he was blocked by the sword according to the bible he was blocked why because if man were to eat the tree of life and not be right he would live forever in that condition so god had to block man and that sword he drove out the man and he placed it east of the garden of eden east of the county cherubims and a flaming sword which turned everyway east west south north whichever way you come i mean that sword will stop you that sword was in the middle east south north that would stop you coming to to turn every way to keep the way of the tree of life who is the way thank you who said i am the way to keep the way of the tree of life this ties in that great message called the throne brother branham taught it perfectly amen he said it all connects together judah ephraim reuben dan and all the tribes they all surrounded the ark amen and we know that the lion and the ox and the man and the eagle all surround the throne praise be to god but church let me tell you something we're not living in the age of the lion we're not living in the age of the ox we're not living in the age of man we are living thank god in the days of the flying eagle praise be to god hallelujah that is our day glory to god and this eagle something has changed amen that tree of life in the garden of eden which could not be approached because of the fall of adam something has changed he's not protecting the tree now if you're an overcomer the tree of life will be given to you if you overcome it we won't help us sorry a scallywag amen but an overcomer he that overcometh he that overcometh he that overcometh shall have the tree of life amen now you couldn't approach the tree of life because of adam's four but now it's given amen just go take it amen the flaming sword amen now that that sword is back and don't worry after there's no more blood that sword will come out again but now because the blood the sword is now red with the blood of jesus christ this flaming sword that was facing every way north south east west amen has been sheathed amen it was not here or until it was bloody with the blood of jesus christ and now that sword we said no here is the tree of life the sword is not pointing at your throat stop there no no now no overcomer come in you can now take of the tree of life that was previously blocked now it is given to you the overcomer praise be to god something has changed church amen because look adam lost his inheritance if that is correct shall they mean somebody it passed from his hand this is from the breach to the one he sold out to satan he sold his faith in god to satan's reasonings therefore his eternal life and his right amen to the tree of life and his right to the earth which belonged to him he forfeited every bit to the hands of satan he passed it from his hand to satan that's right amen and we understand these things if you want to know more read the seals but his right to the tree of life right to the tree of life he forfeited that but something has changed amen it says now it's all different oh can we all say oh come and take the tree of life come and take that eagle is not saying stop now the eagle is helping you with his anointing he's guiding you now instead of the cherubims saying stop instead of them guarding this throne trying to guard them back to the throne trying to bring them through the gate back to the tree of life again that they may take this hey man let's clap those hands and thank god for the eagle anointing hallelujah amen that mama eagle is flying over you saying come on come on back to your original beginnings and all the chickens don't understand but that mama eagle amen that was saying no the lion and the ox and all those protectors are now helping you they're assisting you to go to the tree of life amen to guard them back to the throne instead of having opposition and now you have a body guard to bring you in to escort you to the throne of god to bring them through the gate to the tree of life that they might take this is no more stopped if you're an overcomer it is it is yours tree of life tree of life what is the tree of life if any man eats this bread he shall never die he shall never die amen he shall live forever my in other words in other words i am the tree of life from the garden of eden oh my my my i am the tree of life from the garden of eden amen if they eat the tree of death they died but if they eat the tree of life they live hey mr church i say take eat eat the little book hey man eat that book when you eat you shall live thank god the seals are broken and the prophet said he is those seals hallelujah amen he opened those seals because he is those seals hallelujah i am the tree of life is that tremendous i am the tree of life in the garden of eden and the church age book it says thus the tree of life must be the person of life and that is jesus hallelujah and we can eat he said take it this is my body drink this is my blood this is very very powerful this is full of typology the tree of life must be the person of life and that is jesus so we can come to him now amen we are we are not feeding on a man but we are feeding on the body world of the son of man hallelujah i'm so glad for this day that we can feed on the body world of the son of man he is the tree of life and we can live forever who can shout amen to these things god bless you online amen amen this is a very great quote here now this is a picture of brother branham and brother orman neville because brother neville somebody was asking him why brother branham didn't preach on the holy ghost and why i didn't do this he was asking brother neville it's quite quite a rare picture there and he it it fed back to brother brenner now this quote is is is awesome and i wanted to include it he says the holy ghost why didn't he preach on the holy ghost is that a great question he should have well why didn't he okay here it is here it is the holy ghost is the action in you it's a life it is not an emotion is not some sort of fleshly evidence but it is a person hallelujah it is a person jesus christ the word of god established in your heart amen line up online precept upon precept from glory to glory established in your heart to quicken every word of this age oh right you watch the holy ghost in action not so much in demonstration but in action amen what it does according to the world how many was blessed by that quote amen we love the holy ghost amen it is more powerful than we thought it is the person of jesus christ amen that answered the question real well anything i preach amen go back and check the quotes these are just excerpts from there but you go read the whole book turn on the light it's a bright tree jesus was the bride he was a tree they cut him down he was the tree of life that was in the garden of eden they cut him down and he hung on a roman tree for them to make fun of him what did he do he raised up on the third day from the dead and today today there is a bride tree and it started back there at the beginning way back at the day of pentecost there is a restoration of that bright tree the devil attacked that tree but that tree overcame it because the life was still in the roots and i don't care what you're going through your life is still in your roots hallelujah you will have your winter but you will have your spring you will have your summer the devil can't kill you he couldn't kill job god says satan you can do this you can do this you can do this but don't take his life and i don't care what the devil does to you but there's life in the roots there's life in the roots hallelujah you shall come forth you shall be restored you shall come back to where you should be the life is in the roots hallelujah it looks like you're dead looks like you're finished but you're not finished you're going to be restored i will restore says the lord amen i shall restore hallelujah all the years i don't care what years you have gone through i will restore said the lord let's clap those hands to the great restorer hallelujah glory glory glory to god amen and today today there is a bright tree it started back there at the beginning way back in pentecost praise be to god he said the holy ghost bunch is being honed out that it can fit with the same kind of ministry that he had when he went away we've got to have the same ministry as the tree of life himself amen that when he comes back it will catch the whole thing in the rapture where the justified and the sanctified and the baptism of the holy ghost that pyramid will stand again so it already stood once that pyramid will stand again the house of god will live again here it is here it is the tree of life is growing again hallelujah amen again amber jared again praise the lord restore it back go take it hallelujah and god is helping you you're not being stopped now amen johnny crow the rope has been cut nothing's stopping you now you can go back back to eden is my title praise be to god amen he says that's where it is tonight love produces a fellowship we want fellowship more than anything and god said back there that sin separated that divine love that's what got separate that's what happened in the garden of eden god told adam and eve not to eat certain fruits and they did and sin brought separation but hatred be careful malice strife envy i could add to that list is that right what happened what did they do they separated from divine love so to go back we have got to be reconnected to divine love that is my theme amen redeeming love is my theme and shall be till i die praise god they separated adam instead of keeping divine love he went into carnal love a sexual love a human love but he left divine love and went to filial love that we are coming back by god's grace to agape or love amen divine love and when love projects grace takes over hallelujah brother it will trigger the wonderful great the rapturing grace of god hallelujah amen they separated from divine love amen what happened eve she pulled off the holy veil hey man to see what sex was and what lust would do she pulled off the veil from off her eyes she started well with that holy veil what did she say come on what did she say god had said but here come the answer yeah yay god knows you know the prophet said satan can be truthful sometime and the prophet said actually what he said was true you will become like gods and though good and evil be careful of the power of deception in this age don't be corrupted don't be deceived stay with the simplicity of christ love your enemies don't get involved in politics and i i am with this one uh this i'm with paul i i i i'm with i'm with apollos keep the simplicity stay simple god is hidden and revealed in simplicity keep it simple hey man she pulled off the veil from her eyes that the holy thing that god put over her eyes she wanted knowledge to know what it was so she pulled the veil off to see what it was she should have kept her holy veil shall we talk about it we're almost closing they were wholly veiled this is my thought they were wholly veiled they were safe in god's pavilion you get into that pavilion in the time of trouble god's secret place you get into that pavilion they were they were wholly veiled and that's where we have to go back to holy veil they were safe in god's pavilion they were alive they had no death hallelujah what did they have they had perfect love one for another that's eden perfect love one for another perfect life they had perfect love and a perfect understanding of the love of god and that's what we have we have a perfect interpretation with divine vindication they had a perfect understanding of the love of god not just filial love not just human love i love you you want the love of god amen they had god's word and they kept it and they were alive no death around them because they kept that holy veil praise be to god and the bride is going right back to that you see you say they say it's a holy veil a holy veil these words are in the hebrew language which means uh to purely purge hebrew amen to purge david said purge me lord purge me from online purge me lord from netflix me from hatred purge me from unbelief purge me from impatience purge me from ungodliness purge me lord from hating my brother purge me lord from losing my temper purge me lord purge me hallelujah that's my prayer because it's a holy veil you you are so purged until you can't even see what the devil is talking about he said in the greatest battle he's not even in the picture hey amen holy veil he says one was a woman and man and they did not know that they were naked because the holiness of god kept their eyes veiled notice god hid their conscience from sin by the holy veil oh i wish we had time to go on that a few minutes book of hebrews the worshiper once purged has no more conscience of sin sin has passed from him amen daniel says everlasting righteousness you are purged purge sometimes it's not easy god is purging his bride amen with a spirit of burning praise god esther praise the lord i'm speaking hebrew today i feel like a spiritual jew he hid their conscience from sin when rebecca came to meet isaac what what did rebecca do what's the first thing she did she failed her face it wasn't for style she never had a burberry veil it wasn't for style huh rebecca came to meet isaac she veiled her face and they still do it but they don't know what they're doing the married couples all they know is lift the veil that's all they know they don't understand the bride veils her face because the man is her head hey man you can't say that too loudly in america yeah anyway amen a bride veils her face rebecca veiled her face wow her five senses were veiled amen the man is her head the nature of a woman hey sorry america the nature of a woman is to yield to a man okay and that's the reason the church should be veiled by the holy ghost veil in order to meet her head jesus christ hallelujah in order to meet amen him jesus amen the capstone himself we have and that's the reason the church should be veiled it's got a head you've got a head and that's christ praise be to god that's why rebecca had to veil her face because she was coming to isaac and she was coming to her her jesus being led by eleazar amen the churches should be failed and you won't go in the rapture until you are veiled holy ghost veiled to meet jesus and has got ahead and that is christ amen what did she do rebecca she went to meet isaac she jumped off the camel veiled her face she was coming to her head and the bride is coming to her head as we approach that great headstone amen we shall be like him don't worry about this eliezer gave them to her that's right somebody she's wearing jewelry eliezer gave her jewelry correcto she failed her face she was coming to her head they don't know it they have to do it anyhow when a woman gets married she puts a veil over her face she's coming to her head amen and and and the church being the bride should veil herself to any creed she's coming to her head the word christ is the word he is the head praise be to god we have to have a holy ghost veil to come to our head and what happens when eliezer reaches the tent of isaac elias's job is can go now is that correct now isaac wants to be alone with rebecca so eliezer is not invited he has done his job he must decrease amen and i will and and he must increase so when eliezer brings her to the tent of isaac he's done his job thank god our eliezer has introduced us your ministry will introduce you the coming of jesus christ hallelujah on the ohio river your ministry will introduce the coming of jesus christ amen he says that then the holy spirit comes down and a miraculous power transforms your life and picks you up and brings you inside of the veil and there you have fellowship with god and you commune with him as adam hall did in the beginning at the garden of eden oh how we want to go into that presence and the prophet said i'll meet you in there and i'll tell you what to do for the third time praise be to god who wants to meet jesus there amen if you do what i say i'll meet you in the morning as we close now keep our conscience pure listen to his prayer keep our hearts veiled amen lord our eyes veil let me not see this rubbish let me not see this online confusion veil my eyes from satan's eden where satan is in control bring me into your eating lord lord may my my eyes be veiled when these women walk down the street may my eyes be veiled from the things of the world online offline and the vain things of the world feign glory to become a big somebody amen you've got to get the real revelation we are nothing that's your biggest revelation praise be to god keep our hearts veiled lord hey man and she was naked in eden hey man but she was veiled with a holy veil how many wants that holy veil tonight i i i want that holy veil they didn't know nothing because they were veiled with god's spirit amen and here's here's what it is faith doesn't see nothing but victory hallelujah when you start to get veiled is victory faith knows how to zoom out and to zoom in and faith is zoomed on the victory faith doesn't see nothing praise be to god i'd love to sing that song he's able he's able because joshua and caleb they had the holy ghost veil and all the they said oh there's giants but joshua and caleb they didn't see nothing they saw grasshoppers because they were veiled praise be to god when you get veiled all you can see is victory you i don't see no giants amen you see this telescope here that is a replica amen of the telescope of uh of admiral nelson amen and he he he was told oh that he must attack these ships and he disobeyed and he took the telescope he had one blind eye and he put the telescope on the blind eye and then he said those famous words i see no ships and all his men were because he had the telescope that's where the saying comes from to turn a blind eye so here's the telescope but he put it to the wrong eye so he was using his telescope but he he couldn't see and i tell the church when the devil talks to you take your telescope and put it on your blind eye and say lord fail me i don't see no demons i don't see no failure i don't see no for no fear i don't see no problem he's got the telescope on the on on the blind eye praise the lord and the church has got to be blinded i see victory we shall see him as he is hallelujah hallelujah may we just see amen the positive things may we see what god has said and stay veiled i think this is my last last slide here like abraham he was veiled abraham he did not even consider his own body he was veiled he was veiled if abraham looked at his body he would say i would never have a son but abraham he was veiled he just saw victory god said so abraham considered not his own body now dead not even the the deadness of sarah's womb he did he didn't even think about that he was veiled and the bride is failed he didn't even consider it it wasn't brought into understanding he just considered what god said god said so god said so he just said what eve said god said so god said so he didn't consider his body he didn't conceive i mean consider her age he said god said so we're going to have a child he was failed faith veils your mind amen as long as peter stayed veiled he walked but when peter looked at the waves he went down but while peter was veiled he kept walking on the water all he could see was jesus that's all he could see was jesus oh let's go back to eden church hallelujah he just considered what god said come here peter come here peter walk walk walk come on man he just kept on walking and he when he was veiled to the sea he reached his target come on eve come on church let's get veiled and go to meet our head and abraham he says he he says jesus lives in a world that no one know about he was an odd person and that's the way it is to all believers they are odd people they're oddball people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves and can i say they live in an eden to themselves behind the veil of the holy ghost when you have the veil of the holy ghost you can't see the the things they're saying it's like the it's like the the the the the person that was in the hospital and they were pointing to the chart and they said well according to the chart according to
