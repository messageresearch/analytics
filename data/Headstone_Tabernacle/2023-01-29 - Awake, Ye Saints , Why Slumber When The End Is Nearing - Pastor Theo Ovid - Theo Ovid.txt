here today in the house of God Amen so let's go straight to the word of God we want to read three portions of scriptures one from First Peter chapter four I want to read for seven to eight Romans 13. verse 7 to 14 and Jeremiah 5 22-31 certainly appreciate time no longer last week but Isaac what are in Inspiration what a blessing to see these gifts that God has placed among us but Anthony on Wednesday night truly inspiring place in Christ amen praise God appreciate the special this morning let the team Shall Pass God's bright safe at last that's a song in Prophecy but the bride will be in that position to say Let the dead Angel pass amen so let's go to First Peter chapter 4 reading verse 7. and eight but the end of all things is at hand be there for Suba and watch unto prayer no toad that is freeze watch on to prayer and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves not just charity but what they qualifying word before charity charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins Romans 13 verse 7 render therefore to all their Jews tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom Fear To whom fear honor to whom honor Ole man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another had fulfilled the law for this Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt before witness Thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this same namely thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself love wicketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law and that knowing the time that now is High Times are weak out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believe the night is far spent the D is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in writing and drunkenness not in chambering unwantedness not in strife and envying but putting on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not Provisions for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof our last scriptures from Jeremiah chapter five reading from verse 22. God speaks fearing not me say at the Lord will he not tremble at my presence which have placed the son for the bound of the Sea by a Perpetual decree that it cannot pass it and though the ways thereof thoughts themselves yet they cannot Prevail though the roar yet they cannot pass over it but these people had a revolting and a rebellious heart they are revolted and gone neither say they in their heart let us know fear the lord Our God that give it rain but the former and the latter in his season he reserve it unto us the appointed weeks of the Harvest your iniquities of turn away these things and your sins have withholden good things from you for among my people are from wicked men they lay wheat as he that set at sneers they set a trap they catchment as a cage is full of birds so are they Houses full of Deceit therefore they have become great and waxing Rich they are waxing fat they shine ye they overpass the Deeds of the wicked they judge not the cause the cause of the fatherless yet they prosper and the right of the needy do they not judge shall I not visit for these things save the Lord shall not my soul be avenge of such a nation as this a wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land the prophets prophesy fortunately the priests bear ruled by their means and my people love to have it so and what will you do in the end thereof let us pray father we have read your word and this Lord is is something father today and I pray Lord that what you put Upon My Heart Lord that your spirit will take me out of the way completely and speak only what need to be spoken

prophesy falsely and the priests bear ruled by their means and my people love to have it so some people like it so yeah they like that the light before it's prophecy yeah they like the foolishness they enjoy it praise God they like the lies they like deceit they like it that might be tolerated if you don't if they don't like it you can't tolerate false prophecy false are all kind of false

nearer than when we believe High time we sit in the message long enough subsetting and start doing subsidence that acting subsetting I'll get out your Slumber and sleep I trust this rake you and rock you today amen oh please God please God praise God Isaiah 29 go talk about Israel he said for the Lord had poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and I'd Close Your Eyes the prophets on your rulers the seers that he covered and the vision of all is becoming to you as words of a book that is sealed which men delivered unto one that is learned saying read this I praise you he said I cannot for it is sealed oh my Hallelujah all right let's go let's get started let's go to work this morning praise the Lord 90 years ago 9-0 which is 1933. seven Visions came to this prophet you said in 92 to 1933 when the Lord when we were having a meeting over here where the Church of Christ is standing now a vision of the Lord came to me appear predicting that Germany would rise up and we put up a marginal line there and he said no how they'll be all fortified and the Americans would take a great beating right there it also said what will take place about Roosevelt and them things he will run and make a fourth term perfectly I'll come to pass also that cars will keep getting more like an egg until the last days it'll be a shape of an egg and I said it'll come to pass that those cars will not be run by steering wheel it was run by something else and then cars will bring right out now remote control and so on you can't hit another car because of remote control I said remember that day before the end time comes before the end time comes now you all keep this road down there'll be a powerful woman raise up either be president or dictator or some great powerful woman in this United States and she will sink under the influence of woman no remember that is thus saith the Lord let's continue the loudest and age began around the tune of the 20th century perhaps 1906. how long will it last as a servant of God who had multitude of visions of which none has ever failed he said one morning I'll just keep in true June 1933 the Lord Jesus spoke to me and said that the coming of the Lord has joined now but that before he came seven major events would transpire the first Vision was that of Mussolini would invade Ethiopia and the nation would fall at the steps that Vision surely that caused some repercussions some were very angry when I said it I would not believe it but it happened that way he just walked in there with his mother and arms and took over the natives didn't stand a chance but the vision also said that Mussolini would come to Harbor Inn with his own people tilling on him that came to pass exactly Vision number one Vision number two the next vision for Paul that an Austrian by the name of Adolf Hitler would rise up as dictator over Germany and he would draw the world into war it shown the sign fine line and how our truths will have a terrible time to overcome it then it shows Hitler would come to a mysterious end the third Vision was in the realm of world politics for it showed me that there would be three great ISM fascism Nazism communism and the first two would be swallowed up into the Third The Voice admonished what Russia what Russia keep your eyes on the King of the North and we know that Russia is ordained by God under the communistic spirit to inflict Rome with judgment to inflict America with judgment also so Russia are going away anytime soon praise God the fourth Vision showed great advances in science that would come after the second World War it was now this is 1933. being like 90 years ago let's continue it was heading up in a vision in the Plastic Bubble top car that was running down beautiful highways on the remote control so that people appeared sitting in the car without a steering wheel and they were playing some sort of game to amuse themselves but even poor so this was what a kind of view of what the cow shaped like in 1933 but this is not what he saw you know kai was odd shape in that time he saw a different car altogether let's go to the video volume we spend so much of our Lives driving from place to place I'm just going to stop right here yes save us a seat shouldn't it be easier and safer to get where we want to go since 2009 our team at Google has been developing fully self-driving technology and testing it on real city streets every single day until after more than a million miles we were ready to take a big step forward in 2015 we completed the world's first truly driverless ride on public roads just a person in a car no steering wheel no pedals navigating everyday traffic well I've never been in Austin Texas now I'm driving in Austin Texas [Music] it's a profound experience for me to be alone in the car a very important segment of my life was cut away when my vision failed and a self-driving car would give me a huge part of my life back this is just the beginning we're looking ahead to a new way a better way for everyone [Music] foreign say hello to waymo praise the Lord so you know what a vision is when a prophet gets a vision he goes up in the spirit he goes into the future he sees exactly what comes what is happening and come back and say dusty at the Lord it can't fail because it's something directly that he sees in the future that was the third Vision that was the fourth vision the fifth Vision had to do with the moral problem of our age centering mostly your own woman God showed me that woman began to be out of their place with the granting of the vote that they cut off the here which signify that they were no longer under the authority of a man but insisted on either equal rights or in more cases more than equal rights she adopted men closing went in the state of undress until the last picture I saw was a woman naked except for little fig leaf type epon which with this Vision I saw the terrible provision and moral plight of the whole world then in the sixth Vision there arose in America are most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in a complete power I believe that this was the rise of the Roman Catholic Church though I knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in America due to the popular vote by women the last and seven vision was wearing I heard a most terrible explosion as I turned to look I saw nothing but debris and craters and smoke all over the land of America so we're not even sure if America even making it a tribulation all right let's continue so Revelation 13 review 13 stars to two stripes everything is 13 everything is woman Dusty at the Lord there will be a woman rule before the end time she'll either be president vice president or it will be the Catholic Church as a woman I've seen her he said no guess he's not flipping a crystal ball and throw no dice I have seen her a great woman and a Nation about her it will be won before the end time thus saith the Lord write it down and find out you young people see if it happens if it isn't I'm a false prophet or praise the name of the Lord this Wednesday January 25th uh in brother Branham time he said the scientists put the clock they call it the Doomsday Clock at three minutes to midnight so this Wednesday they were unveiling what time they believe it is no and when they unveil it they said right now we are 90 seconds to midnight with Russia invasion of Ukraine and the Specter of nuclear weapon use Earth crept its closest to Armageddon a science oriented adversary group moving its famous Doomsday Clock up to 90 seconds before midnight we are really closer to that than doomsday as I read that I think it's who something already give it a warning until countries begin to stock up on on nuke I heard I said um something that protected from nuclear fallout some kind of medication or something like that we are really closer to that doomsday former Mongolian president elbow Tashia said Tuesday at the bulletin of atomic scientists annual announcement written of how close humanity is doing in itself in he and former Ireland president Mary Robinson joined scientists to underscore that they consider the Gathering of several existential threats with Russian leader Vladimir Putin's action and words Chief among them people and scientists are warning us that we have to wake up now like this week he said the adversary group started in 1947 to use a clock to symbolize the potential and likelihood of people doing something to end Humanity it moved the clock 10 seconds closer than last year making it the closer it has ever been to strike in 12. it has been much as 17 minutes before midnight after the end of the Cold War but the last few years the group has changed and counting down the minutes midnight to counting down to the seconds doomsday has not happened yet we are sending a message that the situation is becoming more urgent so I'm going to just keep that right there oh man they continue a few nights ago just about a month before going over to Africa many of you perhaps has the tape you people here gets a tape choosing a bride was preach in California the last few minutes of that tape I don't remember of ever being dear but the spirit of the Lord came in such a way I have been condemning them the way they were living and doing and after the gospel was preached and declared before them so much all of a sudden the Holy Spirit spoke out and said Capernaum the city that called yourself by the name of the angels that is Los Angeles God exalted into heaven and be brought down to Hell he said it and then when I went into the scripture I said there's something about that in the Bible and it was Jesus rebuking kapuna and all those crucial City that he had to visit he said Capernaum doors exalted into heaven will be brought down into hell he said but if the works have been done in Sodom Gomorrah had been done in you it'll be standing today and just after that maybe a hundred years or something like that of Jesus prophecy Capernaum the only coastal city that he had visited a earthquake sunk it in the sea and you know that was the direct answer to California Los Angeles watch he says he talked about uh the there was a earthquake and some things put loose and so on he said in the pool lose several inches maybe two inches the other day and one was interviewing a scientist and said well it probably won't be in our age he said it could be in five minutes or in five years but it's going to fall in and when I understood that I said there's a scripture that's all I skipped a little bit he says no watch all right he said and then prophesying Los Angeles will be in the bottom of the sea praise God so that's the prophecy now you know we're here now for years but this will surely come to pass oh yes it will be fulfilled it have to be fulfilled because the prophet saw it by vision Revelation 6 says and I beheld when it opened the Sixth Seal that was a great earthquake and the moon and the sun became black a circle out of here and the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell onto the Earth even the victory concept of untimely figs when she's shaking the Mighty Wind and The Heavenly passages of scroll when it rolled together and every mountain and Island will move out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men every Bond man every free man hid themselves in the dens and the rocks in the mountains and settle the mountain on rocks followed us and hide us from the face of him that sitted on the throne from the rat of the lamb for the great day of his rat is come who shall be able to stand so friends we know a dynamic age an age that all history all the the Saints of all I've been looking for for this time this time of Deliverance and Redemption and breakthrough we are not here forever isn't that right praise God question now does man a dead go to heaven or hell immediately or do they wait for the judgment answer that's a very good question it does I was due a good consideration because every man is interested what is he going to be after his life is over every man is interested I'll tell my wife sometimes I'm driving and I'm watching People's Souls on the side of the roads people and I'm seeing dying people Diana don't even know it the walking and they don't even know it they're on their way see young people and so on they don't even know what happened the next martial years but we are dying praise God you're born to live and you're living today isn't that something so the the best thing to do is to live for Jesus Christ the best thing to do is to live for the Lord because we have to answer someday for the life-given on us on the earth okay let's continue this is good the sinner has got this time judgment but there won't be but this judgment is just like a circle or rainbow around the world of the blood of Christ as long as you were here if God could look upon the Earth in his condition tonight any other way than through the blood of Jesus Christ he would destroyed in a second so it's because the blood of Jesus circles the world like the whole secondly hold it so even though your sin your fail your fall you do whatever it is the blood's still counting as a bumper for you as long as you are on the Earth are you with me he would destroyed in a second he have to certainly have to that is where the judgment is coming now as long as a man is under here I want you to believe what the prophet is saying no matter if the man is a drunkard or a gambler or a horrible unbeliever that's why that's why it's hard to understand when people have bad ways and they say they're Christians because we were born in sin shape iniquity and God reached on pick us out and give us Grace to come into this way we couldn't do this if God didn't make a way for us he said no man could come except my father draw him so if God grace extend to you to pick you up how come you want to condemn this one write out this one cut off this one have a bad attitude this with this one and look at this one it doesn't make sense if a man is a drunkard a gambler a horrible unbeliever the mercies of God is still atones for him and a woman she might be ever what she might be a prostitute whatever the blood of Jesus Christ still atones for her but the minute that that Soul leans this body and she goes beyond that she is passed from Mercy to judgment the minute the soul leaves the body judgment she's no longer covered by the circle that circle around the Earth of the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah God's already judging that satellite she's done she's judged you judge yourself by the way you treat God's propagation for your sins you judge yourself you don't judge him you you don't judge him just enough to forgive you if you think he'll forgive you confess your Force he forgive you then by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body and as that body was raised up by God resurrected from the dead Justified sit in his right hand in power matches in heaven so them that I am dead in Christ are in Christ and free from judgment will come forth in the resurrection now when we die no we go directly into the presence of almighty God in a Celestial body are you are you riding with me this morning if I would meet brother Neville up there if we both die now in an hour from now I will meet him and say greetings talk to him I couldn't shake his hand he's in a Celestial body I could talk to him he would look just like he looked us here I would look like I do but we could talk to one another we couldn't touch one another because we haven't got any of the five senses of sea taste feel and smell and hear that that five senses belong to the body that will be in the box or in the Earth are you with me now but this Celestial body is another body that the soul stepped into when you

function of the world right Jesus told his disciples that he was with them and he had chosen them and he knew them before the foundation of the world was ever laid isn't that right praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah prison have you ever heard of Tim Trojan Horse okay a chosen horse a chosen horse is a hollow wooden horse constructed by the Greeks to gain entrance into Troy during the Trojan War the horse was built by IPS a master Carpenter and culturalist the Greeks pretending to Desert the war sailed to the nearby island of tinenos leaving behind sinon who persuaded the Trojans that the horse was offering to Athena Goddess of War that would make Troy impregnable despite the warning of La and Cassandra the horse was taken inside the city Gates that night Greek warriors emerged from it and opened the gates to let in The Returned Greek army the story is told at length in the book two of the anid and is touched upon an odyssey the term trojan horse has come to refer to subversion introduced from the outside beginning the late 20th century the name Trojan Horse was applied to deceptively benign computer codes that seem like legitimate applications but are written to damage or disrupt computers programming or to steal personal information so you understand what the children's horse is they do like they're not there they want to go in they couldn't fight they're fighting all the time you know and the record is not getting through so what they do they build a nice wooden horse big wood nose and say that's our girlfriend for you that's a gift and instead of the Bonnet right there and do get rid of it right outside the gates they they pull it inside they say yeah give go watch them gifts sometimes you never bring it free you know you know Hallelujah glory to God don't Slumber when the end is near him Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God very important show them all the truth or not what we have liked here something like that and the men were inside the horse and they pulled him inside the man they quietly quietly and when they come and recovered Darkness that a master would money you know that build a horse you know a demands inside of there open the gate and let the enemy come in destroy it Hallelujah praise God um Avatar Avatar is a movie that is being played right now and the meaning and that would Avatar came from Sanskrit the Hindu text and the meaning it has a manifestation of deity or released soul in bodily form on Earth an incarnate Divine teacher Avatar comes from the Sanskrit word although I know it looking like a disjointed but it'll all come together see I'll talk about children horse we there's a reason why we said that so we're coming to that just now Avatar come from the Sanskrit word avatara meaning descent within Hinduism it means a manifestation of a deity in bodily form on Earth such as a Divine teacher for those of us who don't practice Hinduism it technically means incarnation embodiment or manifestation of a person or idea an avatar is something that embodies something else in Hinduism the different gods can take many different forms and when they took human forms the human was their Avatar eventually the word Avatar came to meet the embodiment not just of a god but also of an abstract idea now the man who is the director of these Avatar movies and so on like that her name is James Cameron he's an atheist he's not a Saint James he's an atheist he believes not in this true Living God and he has an agenda now the first Avatar movie was made 13 years ago I'm saying this because I had reason to kind of dig deeper into this this guy and he had to wait 13 years because science wasn't ready for the vision he had he helped design the cameras and the whole thing that produced the movie that we have presently called Avatar 2 The Way of the water this film has taught two billion dollars I think under two months or within two months not 2 million millionaires are set of numbers but this is 2 billion that's a lot of zeros behind two billion and it's still going strong his first one crossed 2 billion three of his movies crossed two billion he is a man like no other in India they're going crazy about this Avatar film why because Avatar is inspired by Hinduism the color blue is used the way Hindu gods are depicted the ramayana or ramayana is the inspiration for this place called Pandora which is the mystical world of this place called Avatar now this man got dreams when he was age 18. dreams remember just two influences it's not six or three or five or four you know it have influence from above or below so I'll say it this way the dreams he got from Below he got them when he was age 18. and he draw it out he had it out he had it there and everything else he saw colors he saw everything he is inspired these half-naked creatures they're looking like humans because bodies that you reflect in there in another world have tales and they have little lowering clothes running around all right no it's a world that he has created and that is why I spoke about what I spoke about you are here what you are somewhere else because I learned that one of the stars and the whole thing is a man who is crippled he can't move he can't walk or whatever it is but when he transmits into this Avatar Land he's walking normal he is moving normal so this man is inspired though is negatively inspired to see another world and he had the intention to bring the world put into that world but yeah Paul just put on the picture this is the creatures that is projected in this so-called nice world called Avatar note behind it I have some people on wings and flying and there's the color blue and everything else take the door faster my face no don't stay there too long there take it off now I prefer to see meat on the cedar all right you know I was wondering if so play a video concerning what the part or what they have but to do that now so this this man is inspired he inspired in a way I'm sorry I couldn't get some more pictures but he's having an internet and so on all the actors in this movie called Avatar have dots on their face and special clothing underwear Dava helmet and have a camera so the camera gets the picture of the Feast of expression the smiles the eye blinking everything else and the costume that they wear registers the holy Duchess for that all through the all through the garments have these dots and so on they're doing it in normal place but what the Ducks do it sells signals to the computer and because of that they could add what you call a CGI I think it's computer generated image is what that is and put a layer over how the person is acting so it's not a cartoon is actors that acting and you could see their facial expression as to who it is the emotions are reflected and the acting so this technology this couldn't be done except man reached to the technological advancement to produce the quality of world that they're creating no I understand that after people went and see it they went into a place oh that's that's it that's it right there so you see the helmet the dots on the face and that deer is a computer generation of the man that talking and everything else so there is no mistake of who it is it's an avatar another being from another world thank you Brothers they're good all right so now there was an interview and that is what we're about to play now an interview with him a woman who was interviewing him and I want you to hear what the director say about it yeah Paul let's go to the interview and I think in terms of Avatar I think that the greatest level of sophistication is when you can bring very sophisticated information into simple form and that's what makes Avatar that you could tell that level of sophisticated truth in almost like a cartoon yeah which is what religion and spirituality is and there are religious and spiritual themes right throughout throughout and they're there and they're there by Design they're not accidental I mean the film I think was dismissed by some critics as being too simplistic too familiar a story just to sort of Pocahontas story and so on and I don't think they they realized that it was by design a kind of Trojan Horse to allow you to deal with a very familiar and simple plot line that has these other layers and textures to it which was my focus you know my focus was on the design the fabric of the world the feeling evoked by the watching you know so you can synthesize the plot quite or sum up the plot quite quickly but you can't sum up the experience quickly and so it was experiential filmmaking that was the that was the primary goal praise God did you hear that the woman says here what makes Avatar that you could tell that level of sophisticated truth is almost like a cartoon you say yeah you say which is what religion and spirituality is and they are religious and spiritual teams throughout when they are dear and they are he said he said throughout he said and they are there by Design he said it is not accidental these people are hiding what they're doing he said it is not accidental It Is by Design listen a kind of Trojan Horse we get into somewhere we're getting somewhere he said to himself a kind of church and horse what is Roseanne horse do to get on the inside to allow you to deal with a very familiar and simple plotline that has these other layers and textures to it which was my focus you know my focus is on the design the fabric of the world will the feeling invoked by the watching feelings invoked by the watching he said you could synthesize the pot quite and sum it up quickly but you can't sum up the experience quickly so it was an experiential filmmaking that was my primary goal no in another interview he spoke about somebody uh was saying why is this scene was so long I guess some animal flying or somebody on the animal whatever whatever and he finds so much he said he wanted it so I wanted it so because I want to get the people pulled into the world that was in it will take time to do that by the Brandon from a noted not watch the spirit following it there will come a time In The Name Of The Lord that people will go completely insane the Bible says so they will scream and holler great hideous things in their imaginary mind the radio and things our television programs are producing it there will be such things as ants raised up in the earth that will be highest 14 trees there will be a bird fire across the Earth with wings four or five miles across people will see them and they will scream and holler and cry for Mercy but it will be the plagues wait till I preach on those plagues opening up so there's a prophecy hanging there that through the television through these movies true it is not accidental through all these things things can be activated you see if you get a cut you could put a blast on it you go to a doctor that's external thing you get a wound your liver your kidneys and whatnot but you see that mind that's the defending all together you know get that throat and horse inside of there and then that Spirit come upon that nose and you're crazy and nuts God have mercy we are coming

know their tongues and pain and blasphemed the god of Heaven because of their plans and their souls and repented not of their deeds and the six Angel poured this vile upon the great river Euphrates and the water there was dried up that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared and I saw three unclean Spirit like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth of the Beast out of the mouth of the false prophet and they are spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth of the whole world that gather them to the battle of the great day of God

something like but this time she said come come come come come this thing is serious who's 19. and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and cause him to shave off the Seven Locks of his head and she began to afflict him on his treatment from what is that picture the servant of God few chapters few verses before took the gates and pack it up and she said the Philistine be upon the assumption and he woke out of his sleep and said I will go out as other times before and shake myself and he wished not that the Lord was departed from him it's a dangerous thing be asleep Watch

careful with Slumber and sleeping Hallelujah The Gardener Gethsemane which is in prayer meeting Jesus come onto a place called simony and certain disciples sitting here while I go and pray under I talk with them Peter and Tucson Zebedee began to be very soft and heavy this is Jesus sorrowful very heavy he said unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful he's telling them that here and watch with

Wilt he committed unto disciples find them asleep send it to them what could you not watching me one hour watch and pray one what that you enter not into temptation if you don't watch and pray Temptation coming for sure watch the spirit indeed is willing we know that but the flesh is weak Hallelujah and he went away a second time and prayed saying to my father if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it that will be done he came and found him asleep again for the eyes were heavy he left them went away again and prayed to the time seeing the same words oh my I'm almost done first Samuel 28. I'll be an entirely here in scriptures it's all time together you know Samuel was dead for Samuel 23 and all Israel had lamented him buried him in Rama even his own City and Saul had put away those with familiar spirits and the Wizards out of the land the soul had to run them out and the Philistine guided together came and pitched him and saw God all Israel together and the pigeon gilboa and when Souls so the host of the Philistines he was afraid and his heart greatly trembled it's War you know his battle you know I went Saul and quiet of the Lord the Lord answer him not neither by dream nor by Prophets none God not talking to him God had answering him and then Saul said unto himself and seek me a woman that had a familiar spirit I'll show you how back certain people could become because Soul was rank among the prophets isn't that right and he in a condition now where he is not hearing from God he says seek me a woman and have familiar Spirit then I may go to her and inquire of her and his servants said unto him behold there's a woman that had a familiar Spirit at endo Saul disguise himself when they say you're going to Mississippi when you're still going contrary you can't go as you you know yeah look at these guys because you know you're not supposed to be where you're going you know you're not supposed to do what you're doing you know you're not supposed to be here he disguised himself put on other garment agreement and he went two men with him and they came to the room by night he said unto me I pray that you divine unto me by The Familiar spirit and bring me up him whom I shall name unto thee yeah I want to call him yet now the woman really attacked she ridden the Lord the land to him behold don't know us what Saul had done how we had cut off those that are familiar spirit Soul Run and and and The Wizard out of the land wherefore then they'll list oh a sniff on my life to commit to die so Saul swear to her by the Lord saying as the Lord delivered they shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing then said the woman whom shall I bring up Unity he said bring me up Samuel remember at that time witches and so access them because they were in Paradise okay and then the woman said whom shall I bring up on the D he said bring me Samuel and when the woman saw Simon she cried with love voice and woman stick to soul and said why has thou deceived me for thou art soul you're hiding that Christian look at you you're in church come like Peter when you say you're one of them he's not Christ somebody come out again Peter standing watching it but I saw you in service last Sunday because I know people following Jesus don't do that all right watch he said why has those deceive me for the white soul and the King said unto her be not afraid for those sowest down and the woman said in the soul I saw God's descending out of the earth he said unto her what form is he of she said an old man cometh up he's covered with a mantle and soul perceive it was Samuel he stooped with his face to the ground and bought himself Samuel said to Saul why has thou disquieted me to bring me up and Saul answered I am so distressed for the Philistines make war against me and God is departed from me and answered me no more neither by prophets nor my dreams therefore I've called thee that I always make it known to me what I shall do then Samuel then said Samuel wherefore then has thou asked me seeing the Lord is departed from thee and has become thy enemy and the Lord had done to him as he speak by me for the Lord had rent the kingdom of the thy hand and given to Thy Neighbor even to David because thou has oh not obeyed not the voice of the Lord nor executed his Fierce wrath upon amalek therefore had God done this thing or to this day moreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines and tomorrow shall thou and thy Sons be with me the Lord shall also deliver Thee the host of Israel into the hands of the Philistines oh my brother Branham he said brother we the Church of the Living God and these great hours that we are now living in it behooves us to check up go before God like the candle
