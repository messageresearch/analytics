morning appreciate the song service amen special thanks to the musicians god richly bless you amen praise the name of the lord so without further ado we want to switch over to the word now amen and we want to invite your attention to a few scripture readings i have three portions that we want to read from amen um very small very concise just to bring a context here so genesis chapter one i'll read from first and then i want to go to [Music] first thessalonians 4 16 and also revelation 22 17. amen amen so genesis 1 amen reading from verses 1 to 3 says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light god our blessing and also uh thessalonians uh four and and versus sixteen sixteen to eighteen says for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them and the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words amen and lastly we want to read in revelation 22 17 amen amen praise god revelation 22 17 just at the closing of the bible itself and just this one verse here and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely may god our blessing to the ring of his word let's just bow our heads one more time as we like to pray ask god's blessing upon the service this morning heavenly father we thank you lord to be gathered here once more in your presence lord coming through lord father these last few years lord we know it means so much to us lord father to come into your house and to worship your father lord there are some of that lord father i've gone on to be with the lord that aren't here this morning lord remember them in a special way in their families lord and we pray their god father your holy spirit would strengthen us today lord lord we're so thankful to be alive and to be in your house and in your presence to have one more opportunity lord father to feast at your table to hear you speak to us lord and to to be allowed to be changed and transformed to be given a second chance at life again it seems lord we we thank you for this privilege to be called the sons of god lord to hear your voice and to hear you speak to us lord mayor speak to our hearts this this day lord we put everything aside lord everything that so easily be said to us lord father we lay aside every weight oh god father or we pray your holy spirit would come lord and take me out of the way lord father hide me behind calvary's tree oh god and lord may you speak to your people lord father use me as an instrument lord father lord to speak to your people lord father no other thoughts but your thoughts lord lord for maybe glorify today in your word may your spirit come and and do its marvelous work amongst us father we welcome your holy spirit in this place lord we pray that you have your preeminence pour out your spirit lord may your freedom backslide the lord do whatever you want to do today lord father we i pray you have your prayer minutes bless also your servant this morning lord but always father may strengthen his body we pray for healing we pray for anointing especially afresh upon him today and we pray that you have your weight today lord commit this stay into your hands in jesus name amen and amen you may be seated now praise god thank you so much amen praise god amen praise the name of the lord god bless you saints of god well it's certainly happy to be in the house of the lord today amen and i have a small thought i want to share with you this morning and my thought is the voice of god amen that's my thought this morning amen the voice of god and you know i was thinking about when i was a younger person um being a teenager growing up and thinking back through those years you know there was always something that was in my mind at that time and i uh as a younger person there's a strange sense of not being heard um you know you feel like you have a voice but you know because of the way the world works sometimes your voice gets lost amidst all the other voices that are around sometimes you have feelings and thoughts opinions on things that you want to share with people but maybe because you're not old enough or you're not experienced enough or you know how the hierarchy of the world works sometimes your little young voice gets lost amidst all the other voices that have uh you know societal status background based on where you come from other voices are revered and respected more than yours that's just the way the world works and it's tough you're in a class of probably 15 20 kids and the teacher says anybody asks a question and everybody raises their hand because they want to be heard and sometimes teacher doesn't have all the time to answer all the questions maybe he just answers two or three and you're left with your question sometimes that's just how it is because maybe a certain age and you know you just feel like you get lost and i could see how a lot of young people can that can get lost along the way sometimes they join gangs and sometimes they join small groups clubs sometimes they get caught up in any kind of platform that would give them a voice somewhere where they could be heard where their concerns could be raised and where someone there would be able to address it maybe it's a community leader or someone with some kind of influence amen in their society and somehow they feel that this is the way that they can be heard sometimes they get caught up in the wrong thing and sometimes i think you know and maybe an admonishment here as we as parents we ought to really keep a listening ear for children because sometimes there's things they want to tell us and if we're listening we'll hear we'll hear them out we'll hear their their concerns what they're trying to tell us because they'll become a time when we want to speak to them and they won't have time for us so we want to make time for them and to make sure that any question that they have is answered answered with guidance and with leadership answered with the right spirit and motive and objective to be answered by the word of god isn't that right because that's how we are admonished to lead our homes and to lead our families isn't that right praise god so i just thought about this thing about voices and just the same way that you have a voice and you want to be heard god has a voice also and he wants to be heard just the same as you praise god amen hallelujah we live an age now where there's so many voices and the internet and and you know youtube and different platforms have given people a voice and i've allowed them to express their concerns to express their ideas express their opinions express what matters to them or what's real to them or what their focus is or what they think about the world and i could imagine that with more voices being added every day there are millions upon millions of voices around the world of different people young old praise god of different uh persuasions with their own voices going across the world right now even as we speak people are making new videos uploading new uploading new content talking about this talking about that more voices are being added and the more voices that are being added is a more that it drowns out the real voice that we come to hear this morning which is the voice of god so this morning is a challenge praise god for us to get aside from everything else to shut out every other voice i can imagine no wonder the prophet would get away up into the mountains get away up into the forest get away up into the far away places and sometimes he would go hunting praise god pray he'd enjoy that but there was a great uh of secret in there where he would be able to hear from the lord you have to shut out every other channel every other distraction every other persuasion every other thing that's pulling you down in order to hear the voice of god amen isn't that right isn't that right and i i believe ministers are challenged today praise god to shout out every other voice in order to hear the voice of god speaking to us it's the only way to hear it isn't that right because god is a spirit and he has a desire and there's something he wants to do every day god has an objective when you wake up in the morning you have to find out what is god's objective what is he trying to achieve today oh hallelujah isn't that right there's a purpose for your life otherwise you would not be here this morning but in order to find that purpose you have to seek first the kingdom of god amen seek first his will seek first his desire seek first his motive seek first is objective for your life and then all other things will be added unto you oh don't worry about your pills don't worry about your car don't worry about your house god will take care of everything else if you seek first the one thing oh david said one thing have i desired and that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all my days and inquire in his temple oh and behold the beauty of the lord for in a time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in a secret place he shall hide me and he shall set me up upon a rock and when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i lead me to the rock of my salvation lead me to the rock of ages this morning oh somebody say man hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so are you ready for the word this morning you have a voice i have a voice but god also has a voice amen and a voice what is it it's an expression of a person oh hallelujah isn't that right it's you have a unique voice praise god you have something to answer it if a question is asked to you isn't that right oh holly you can answer with your voice you can make a loud noise with your voice you could praise god with your voice you can testify of his goodness with your voice you could tell the devil no with your voice you can make a stand with your force you can let your desires be made known this morning with a loud voice with your hands raised you could offer a sacrifice or praise this morning because you have a voice don't let the devil tell you that you don't have a voice i don't care how young you are god still hears you this morning i don't care how old you feel god still hears you this morning he hears every cry he hears every voice and he's here to answer every call this morning oh somebody say man [Applause] [Music] a voice is an expression of who you are it's the ability to utter speech the expression of words isn't that right and we know a word starts off as a thought and then it becomes a word express that's your voice expressing the thoughts that was in your minds previously praise god but once it's expressed it can't go back to being a thought it's not a word it's not expression praise god hey it's your voice being heard isn't that right your voice is an expression of you isn't that right the bible says a good man out of the good treasure of his heart this is luke 6 bringing forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringing forth that which is evil for the abundance for also the abundance of the heart his mouth speak it oh isn't that right hallelujah it's a voice being being made known praise god and it comes from what is in your heart then that voice speaks as an expression of what is in your heart oh what is in your heart this morning do you want a breakthrough do you want a deliverance do you need strength do you feel weak then make your voice known this morning oh hallelujah in this tabernacle in this place take the opportunity to make your voice known this morning to put in your request this morning don't stay silent the devil's job is to put a trip trap on your mouth and clam it so that you can't praise god so that you can't testify of his goodness to make you feel like you don't have a voice but god hears every voice this morning every voice in this room every voice on the internet every voice around the world can be heard by god god is not tired he is not wary there's nothing too hard for him he can satisfy your need according to his riches in glory oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen god has a voice he has a desire he had a purpose he had something he wanted to do that's why when we read genesis 1 amen we see the earth spinning in confusion we see the earth spinning in darkness and because of who god is and the voice carries the nature and the character of god that voice had power in it isn't that right so what did he do because he had a purpose because he had something he wanted to achieve he expressed it he spoke the voice isn't that right and that voice carries the nature and character of god that voice had power in it because god has power that voice has a power to heal because god is a healer that voice had can deliver because god himself is a deliverer his voice and him is the same [Applause] oh when he speaks his word is the same oh hallelujah there's no misalignment there's no in between praise god he is his own expression isn't that right so he said let there be light and the bible said there was light praise god amen because the creator hallelujah who was thinking his thoughts finally spoke and for the first time this dark and confused world heard the voice of god oh hallelujah i don't care how dark and confused you feel in your mind all you have to hear this morning is the voice of god or to crack past the darkness in your mind oh to go past the demons pass your flesh pass your feelings pass what your hurts oh hallelujah and speak to your heart this morning oh hallelujah somebody's saying man [Applause] whatever was happening around had to come into obedience to that voice isn't that right your voice is an expression of who you are isn't that right that's why when jacob was wrestling with the angel isn't that right all night long to the breaking of the day the angel tell him i have to leave it's getting late who are you what do you want the angel began to ask him where's your request and jacob answered i am jacob oh hallelujah i am jacob and what he's saying there is a great release he's actually now admitting who he is he has come to terms with who he is yes yes i am jacob i am jacob the sketch man i am jacob the thief i am jacob the robber i am jacob i cheat my father i cheat my brother out of the bird right oh hallelujah i cheat my father-in-law i cheat this one i cheat that one hallelujah i am jacob this is me i'm a wretch i'm a nobody i'm jacob i'm nothing praise i'm jacob oh i need help i'm jacob i'm struggling i'm jacob i need your guidance i'm jacob i need leadership i'm jacob i need change i'm jacob is there any jacob's in the house this morning you ain't afraid to admit that you lost without him i am lost without him i'm not gonna make it if you don't change me right now if you don't change who i am i don't wanna go back tomorrow be in the same person talking the same way act in the same way god is able this morning to change you oh hallelujah from what you are into what he wants you to be this morning oh i can't hear i can't hear oh hallelujah [Applause] it was jacob confronted with the truth of who he was and he wrestled with that angel and the angel touched him in his thigh oh how i want to be touched this morning i don't want to be the same i don't make sense hola isn't that right they say the graveyard is filled with with with riches riches of the people who had potentials to be something to be someone but they died unfulfilled all right without their purpose truly actualize or realize they died that way and it's so sad oh hallelujah don't you why are you don't you take a lesson from those graves this morning praise god and when you come in this house of the lord you lift your hands you worship god you make every opportunity that is being made available to you this morning you take advantage of it this morning and let your voice be heard hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah isn't that right one time jesus was coming towards the boat in the storm you know the story praise god and disciples saw him coming far off they thought it was a ghost but when he came closer they realized it was jesus peter got all fired up he said if that's you lord bid me come jesus said sure come and he began to come on the water isn't that right praise god peter was all brave and bold when he was in the boat praise god if that stupid become he's that kind of a guy isn't that right real zealous kind of person amen praise god we know him amen praise god when he come out the boat and you see what really going on and you see how hardy water was and how these storms was uh crashing all around on the thunder rolling and the rain falling isn't that right he began to sink he began to drown in the water hallelujah but he didn't stay silent one thing about love about peter he does not stay silent he always comes down a noise around him praise god hallelujah peter say praise save me lord i'm sinking oh he made his voice known pray peter was a fisherman peter gotta play style peter gotta make a little possible swim but he needed help because there's not normal conditions this is storm waters all over this thing there's over troyer stormed this mashup ship stormless mashup valley portal kind of thing he don't want to be destroyed he began to scream out and this morning you have a right as a christian as a son and as a daughter of god to scream out and say jesus save me i need your help i need your deliverance i need a breakthrough i need a reality i need the baptism of the holy ghost you have a right somebody say man you have a right this morning to make your voice known [Music] [Applause] [Music] isn't that right the voice of god so therefore when adam spoke it wasn't a man speaking but it was a man under the authority of god speaking from his office in his position as a son of god in the kingdom speaking pray much remove do this do that praise god that was god that was the expression of adam who was a voice of god in adam speaking praise god because he was an attribute of the creator the creator hallelujah gave him the authority to speak and it was done to work amen is now right to move to do this to name the animals praise god that was the authority of god in adam speaking and when that voice was expressed there was an authority to back that up when that voice was expressed there was authority to back up the voice that was being spoken so when adam say lion lie don't hear an authority come down allow you to back that voice up hallelujah and the lion or paid and the lamb all paid and the lamb lay with the lion oh hell is that right because there was an authority there to keep the peace isn't that right hallelujah isn't that right the prophet said on we would see jesus he said now what is the word a word is a taught express he said you have to think it before you express it that's the reason jesus said unto the pharisees you hypocrites how can you say good and when and call me good and so forth when he knew that in their hearts they were thinking evil of him he said from the heart the mouth speak it from the heart isn't that right and we read the scripture just now right okay he said if you don't then it's your thoughts expressing themselves and you express something else see your thoughts and what you're saying he says is not an alignment you're thinking one thing and saying something else god can't honor that isn't that right prophet said then it's hypocrisy it's not come it isn't coming from your heart oh hallelujah so because adam had the right heart praise god because he was in the right condition when he spoke it was in alignment with his heart with the authority of god in him and an authority back that up back that voice up isn't that right oh my said so in the beginning was a word and a word was it god and the word was god it hadn't been expressed yet he said but then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the word christ he said christ is a word now when he came unheard in the beginning was the word and the thought word and then the word once expressed in eden it became reality god cannot say anything and ever take it back i love that once it's done spoken so shall it be so if god said you are gonna be healed he cannot take it back if he said you're gonna be delivered he cannot take it back if he said he's gonna save your family he cannot take it back because it's already done spoken and so shall it be all the authority that is in that voice when he spoke it praise god i don't care how long it takes it's caught to come to pass and he can't take it back oh because he was perfect when he said it and it'll be perfect when it's done oh hallelujah hallelujah god cannot lie oh i serve a living god this morning oh hallelujah how many happy how many glad today that the enemy is defeated you serve a victorious god who is able hallelujah to do exactly what he said he would do [Music] oh my can't take it back he said that's why we base our hopes on god because god being infinite he cannot change oh yeah man he's the same yesterday today and forever isn't that right he said if i can say something today tomorrow i might think different next year i might be a lot smarter i can think different prophet said you can but not god every decision is perfect if god once says anything it's eternal that way and it can never be changed it isn't that right and now god uh that that's the real reason that jesus was the lamb of god slain before the foundation of the world because it was in god's thinking and when the word was expressed then it become flesh and dwelt among us he said oh i

great infinite god known all things before amen is not right how glorious that is the prophet said instead of people get scared he said what are you scared about those who he fought knew he called it's not right those who he called he justified and those who he has justified he's already glorified he said so what are you scared about what are you worried about this morning he knows your name he knows your voice oh you have not because you ask not so make your voice known this morning ask for what you want actual big things ask for great things oh god is greater oh hallelujah hallelujah he's

put peace like onto a river for rest rest in his arms hallelujah hey man hallelujah so don't be scared don't let the devil get you all shook up there many times in the bible that jesus come and say fear not peace be unto you he knows what's in their hearts you can see fear coming off of them like radiation or something it's just eminent they haven't opened their mouth yet and god know they're afraid it's not don't be afraid this morning the devil could smell fair on you you know yeah he's a wolf walk through the pulpit look through the eyes looking for fear looking for anybody you're afraid smashing them out of the out of the pew destroying them praise god you find safety in the ark this morning you run to his arms praise god hallelujah don't matter we'll get you praise god amen amen hallelujah the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and they are safe oh hallelujah how to find anchor find shelter in the in the name of the lord amen it may not take too long wow page five out of 45. this is a tough one all right uh what are you scared about see just take a hold of god little children hold on to it and believe god your father he loves you he's done everything he could to redeem you he said in the bible say the antichrist deceive all that live upon the earth whose names were not written in the last book of life from the foundation of the world god by his foreknowledge saw you comma oh glory put your name in his book and that's the reason you're here tonight the prophet said and that's the reason you're here this morning because god saw you he loved you and he took his own blood oh and wrote your name in a book and that's how you hear today oh the devil is already defeated oh glory to god ask what you will this morning hallelujah praise god because you've answered that call god for knew you and called you and you accepted his call and now you can see see he said every man seeks out his own salvation of fear and trembling he said i hope my name was among that because if it was my name having a work of life if it was put there before the foundation in the world when allah was slain for me in the thinking of god see he's infinite you don't just simply run a business haphazardly he said i don't run my business like that and you wouldn't do it yours see god doesn't his christ come to redeem those who god foresaw and for knew that he that would come to him he said aren't you glad you've come amen we could say amen this morning oh we're so glad we answered that call amen a call to life amen i want to know i want to know what god wants to say this morning do you feel that way amen amen how do we want to hear of his voice speak praise god we want to hear what he has to say to us isn't that right amen this is my personal note here every true servant needs to hear the voice of god the voice of god is thus saith the lord and the bride is promised to have thus said the lord will keep still amen so it's very important that we hear the voice of god isn't that right said what we need today the voice of god in the last days the prophet said in that great need and god has promised to meet the need of the hour he always does that and we need the voice of god today to meet the need of the hour isn't that right to meet the time that we're living in we just spoke about that right and after he has promised it we can rest assured that he will keep his promise that's the confidence that the believer has in his maker amen is not right that he will keep his promise he promised to heal you he will heal you he promised to deliver you he will deliver you he promised to restore you he will restore he will keep his promise oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not unto your own understanding oh hallelujah acknowledge him in all high ways he will direct thy paths amen make thy way straight isn't that right oh my that's the confidence that the believer has in his maker confidence isn't that right hallelujah praise god such confidence praise god you think about some of these guys walk around you give them a job to do and you pay them half because you're not sure that the job is going to be finished the way you want it when you're ready to pay them the other half so you just get them half just to make sure that they do what they promised they would do give it the next half when you finish but not with god you could trust everything into him because he's he's he's just that way you can have full confidence hallelujah you could put it all on god and he will reward you cast your bread upon the water oh don't you worry about tomorrow he can clothe the lily he can feed the sparrow his eye is on the spiral and i know he's watching over you this morning he's watching over me he will not leave his seat to beg bread i might be young and now i'm old and i've never seen david said the righteous forsaken oh hallelujah he will not forsake the ones that seek his face that seek his face oh he jacob lift up your hands oh hallelujah open up he gates and let the king of glory come riding in this morning [Applause] oh my praise god hallelujah that's the confidence he promised me the need and today one reason that the church is in the condition that is in is because there's so many voices so many other voices to attract the church from the voice of god till it's very doubtful that many would hear the voice of god though it spoke right in their midst oh that's a scary thing huh amen won't recognize it he said they perhaps wouldn't even understand it prophet said because it would be a foreign thing to them they've got themselves so much centered on the voices of the day isn't that right and if we notice in the scripture reading that the voice of god was foreign to them and it's become that way again today that the voice of god there's so many other voices and then if god promised he would give us that and if other voices are contrary to the voice of god then it must be the voice of our enemy to confuse us oh hallelujah anything that isn't the voice of god is the voice of the enemy it's a voice of some other thing trying to distract you trying to confuse trying to pervert because the devil is not a creator he's a perverter he's a pervert of the original so if the devil says anything how do you know he's lying every time he opens his mouth his voice is an expression of who he is and he's a liar so the devil will never tell you that you'll get the holy ghost the devil will never tell you that you can make it and if a voice is telling you that you cannot make it this morning then that is the devil because god would never say that that's not god's voice god's voice is always positive oh holy god's voice said go up at once take the land that i swear unto your fathers to give you a land flowing with milk and honey or to satisfy your needs oh according to his riches in glory hallelujah [Applause] oh my god isn't that right there's so many boys in here today see it's absolutely a hard thing because watch uh okay because it deadens the voice of the supernatural that's right i'll say that again there's so many voices here today that it's absolutely a hard thing because it deadens the voice of the supernatural oh so people are not even hearing what the spirit is saying because they have so many channels on oh helen have 98.10 97 points 96.445 on in their head and they're sitting in church did i leave the stove on the little refrigerator the towel on did i pay this bill i'm not sure click click click clicking they say when you're younger your brain waves move very slowly because you're not agitated by the things of life it'll spike like this like how we are thinking did i do this did i do that i have to call the landlord they don't have those problems that's why they could learn spanish and french hunting because they just in that mindset but the older you get is more you have to manage so your mind is is crowded with all kinds of things and that's why i hear the prophet saying it's absolutely a hard thing because he's seeing the people and all of them have needs all of them have voices but there is one voice one singular voice that can address all those needs he's a man he has a prophet he might have the ability to hear certain things in the supernatural to hear the people their hearts their their what are their desires it all comes out in the supernatural i've never experienced it but the prophet talked about discernment and these things seeing pictures of people's lives and things that they've gone through it's i could imagine it's it's diverse the amount of issues and challenges that people have praise god and he's addressing them and there's so much because he's only one man and he's privy to understand and know certain things but he cannot help them he can't do anything about it he said you know who i'm waiting on i'm waiting on him praise god you know i can't do anything for you many people come up to the pulpit he say you know i can't heal you right he said i don't have the power to do it but he said there's someone here who can and and then he goes on ministering and said one jesus one time he was down by the pool of bethesda and he went past everybody but but there was one person that he wanted to touch and and and and he said only by made whole then all of a sudden the prophet break into a vision said i see a certain thing i i know what's wrong with you you come here because you have cancer i'll let you go out in the name of jesus and believe that he's healed you praise god oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah god addressing the need and god knows your story this morning each one of us have stories each one of us have a walk a road that we traveling on my road might be all road your road might me brother so-and-so's wrote us a so-so some of you might be able to handle what brother so-and-so is doing some of you might be able to handle what sister so is going through but god knows what you're going through god knows your heart song in the night when you're all alone and you need help david said look into the hills from whence cometh my help my help cometh from the lord the lord which made heaven an itch he will not suffer that foot to be moved behold the lord that keepeth israel shall neither slumber he shall not sleep he is not asleep this morning he is very much awake he knows what you have need of make your voice known this morning and lift up your voice and let him know what you need oh hallelujah praise god [Applause] there you hear my voice had not your heart amen oh my says uh there's so many intellectual voices voices of great voices of mighty men who are intellectual that in their intellectual conditions even then they shake the nations see so if you look at your eyes you see the fire the earthquake they get caught up intellectuals see they're just not overnight people the prophet said but they shake the nations they study their way into this thing break it great bringing great organization together great campaigns floweredly he said that a person would be a bit confused because obviously what they're seeing looks you know attractive isn't that right it's enough to confuse them and how these things go on and prosper prophecy isn't that right one time david said look at the heating rage and they're prospering and they're getting true and god saying yeah would you consider the end have you considered where they're going with that they're going on you know but the longest rope have i end oh when they're going to yank it wherever the tree leaning is that's where it will for isn't that right he said and there's voices that raise up and and do these things see and it causes the voice of god to be placed way back somewhere the true voice of god it's way back somewhere all we've got our churches we've got our things we've got our groups and then the voice of god gets less and less important isn't that right and the voice of god they say how will we know it's the voice of god the prophet said because for today it's a vindicated prophet but not uh but then she said uh he said oh we know it's a voice of god but today he said then it was a vindicated prophet now today how do we know it's a voice of god he said because it is a manifestation of the prophet's word oh hallelujah this is placed right in time back then we had a vindicated prophet but now that the prophet's gone what are we looking for what are we on expectation for a manifestation today 2020 2022 we're looking for manifestation of the prophet's word oh hallelujah this is god's prophet our true voice god only brings back that real come on now living supernatural god with his supernatural word hallelujah manifestation of true word and then we know that it's a voice of god because of that super word isn't that right he said there's so much in the other realms that almost dead that out but remember it'll glisten it'll come forth he said you know there's a voice today in the world of politics great voices and people absolutely there's it's all mixed up in the churches and everything and many times that we've just seen recently and that the voice of politics is actually stronger than the voice of god in the churches in the american people and so forth isn't that right they've done it amen isn't that right it's such a shame to see it the prophet said isn't that right okay now i want to get something here so the voice of god has authority in it isn't that right it has authority praise god because a voice is him when he speaks his authority speaks when he speaks his power speaks his omnipotence speaks it's an expression of him isn't that right and when the voice of god has failed in this last day brian it will be the voice of the archangel isn't that right the voice of the archangel is the bride's ministry the second part of 1st thessalonians 4 which we read earlier isn't that right this ministry will be in the bride on the earth with the voice of god failed in her thundering out in sweetness thundering out in humility what will it be thousands of live voices all around the world speaking out isn't that right because we're nearing the end times hallelujah and the devil got his eyes on the bride but she has promised to have that voice amen you are promised to have that voice hey mary man hallelujah isn't that right moses when he was in the wilderness was tossed about and driven isn't arrived for 40 years in the desert however you're mining sheep mining praise god all goats and stuff like that praise god i had a man in his father's in law's flock praise god just pride in his time but one time he heard a burning bush he saw something that was different and he said let me go up and see and when he went up all of a sudden he heard a voice spoke to him something spoke to him out of that bush hallelujah something that you heard before hallelujah something he never saw before something he interacted with that was more real oh he said take his shoes from off your feet from where you're standing because this is holy ground because the holy god was on the mountain a holy god was in the bush our holy god was speaking to moses and when our holy god speaks to you you got to get yourself you got to wrap yourself in his presence you got to take off your shoes you got to show your reverence because god is in the building god is in your presence god is in your midst you can never be the same and come out of god's presence no no no no you've got to be changed you've got to be transformed because it's all powerful god has the ability to change you oh hallelujah oh what we see what we hear changes us praise god hallelujah isn't that right praise god hallelujah oh my revelation chapter 4 1 said and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat upon it upon the throne and there was a voice that called him oh that voice he buff up and said i can't get away from that that voice the one that behind him he looked around somewhere and he showed him all of the church ages because he was standing in the church ages the seven golden candlesticks prophet said talking about john he said then he heard that voice after the church ages cease that voice left the earth and went up and when he got into glory he heard him say come up here i'm going to show you what's going to happen thereafter oh my what is that the voice of god oh he said oh my he said that voice he said let's speak on that voice a minute he said i got some scriptures wrote down here let's go to first thessalonians 4. he said listen over here he said oh we will hear that voice what he's going to say he said oh we already know what's going to say before we read it don't we he said we know what's going to happen the trumpet of god shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise he said is that right he said you are putting it down his first session is for he said the voice that voice was the voice of christ is that right he said that's a voice of christ we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the lord in the air oh that's my promise this morning this world is not my home i'm just a passing through oh hallelujah to meet the lord in the air and forever be with the lord the prophet said that same voice that summoned john come up is that same voice that said to john come up that same voice will summon the church or someday amen he said it summons the church oh isn't that right what does the summons mean a summons is an authoritative call by the right of an authority so if you receive a summons you don't have a choice you have to appear or somebody's going to come and get you pray you are being summoned and you are being in summon this morning or you are being called by god will you answer the call this morning he's calling you up out of your condition out of your situation out of your feelings out of your emotions it's calling you up into a higher place a heavenly place where there's glory where there's power where there's healing for your body healing for your spirit healing for your soul he's calling you up this morning will you answer the call there's a summons there's a trumpet being blown answer the call this morning lift up your hands give god a shout of praise somebody answer the call [Music] [Applause] hallelujah he's calling you to the deliverance call into your inheritance calling into the baptism of the holy ghost and fire calling you to the thing that will satisfy you nothing in this world will satisfy you and outside of god's satisfying portion of fire in your heart fire in your spirit fire in your soul fire to burn the demons out burn down the idols burn down the lusts burn down the lies burn down the filth praise god hallelujah to get you ready to go to heaven [Applause] [Music] means you don't have a choice when that voice calls you you must respond because that voice has power in it when that voice goes out and calls the dead from out of the sea boat great and small for the second death every soul must come up from the ocean from that sea to answer the books must be open they must be examined the righteous judge will be on his throne judging rightly praise god is your life right with god oh hallelujah isn't that right oh my you better be ready because the king is coming but i want to be ready now i don't want to try to get ready then what got us here will not take us over there we need something more we need our power like we've never seen before we need to climb higher we need to press further if we want to get there we've got to do more brethren we've got to pray more pray without ceasing seek ye until i find him knock until the door is open hallelujah pray ask and you shall be given we need more of god oh hallelujah okay so the voice of god cannot be denied see also the same voice that summoned john come up is the same voice that summoned the dead lazarus out of the grave that same voice of the archangel christ is the voice of the archangel oh he makes that very clear so this second thessalonians 4 16 voice of the archangel is christ jesus christ does all three isn't that right so it is christ isn't that right oh that trumpet voice of christ that gospel jubilee trumpet amen voice of christ summons john to come up that same voice is what summoned lazarus is that lazarus comfort was that same voice and lazarus had another choice wherever his soul was traveling wherever it was journeying when he heard that voice echo throughout the dimensions sazarus soul was called back to its body oh hallelujah a corruption hallelujah praise god was reversed back and here he was rolling out of the grave isn't that right oh my did he say he said did you notice that the grave of lazarus he spoke with a loud voice he not just amen isn't that right he said lazarus comfort and it summoned him from the dead and he answered said here i am and he come from the dead after he was dead his body were rottening he said that same voice said to john come up here and i'll show you something that's fixing to happen that same voice that shall sound when the dead and christ shall rise for the trumpet he said what is the trumpet the voice of christ that same one that sounded and summoned him he heard a voice like a trumpet sound and said come up hither see how the resurrection will be prophet said it'll be in a moment it'll be in a twinkling of an eye that clear sounding voice isn't that right i called to the resurrection that great summoning voice god helped me to hear it today that day he said oh there's no uncertain sound about it there was nothing uncertain to john when he heard that voice come up oh isn't that right oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord let me skip on down here i'm running out of time he said it's that same thing tonight tonight when that clear sounding voice said sinner repent i'll give you eternal life he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost he said that is the summons nothing uncertain about it oh it's a clear sounding voice it's a clear sounding trumpet shouting out to you come out of confusion come out of the world and be transformed by the renewing of your mind come up come up and i'll show you something come up and i'll give you something come up out of your sin out of your feelings out of your emotions out of what the devil is trying to wrap you in break out come up this morning stand up do something different shout worship get in the spirit shake that thing off of you get out of thoughtfulness get out of laziness shake off depression shake off oppression shake off weariness shake off the devil and all his thoughts forget about it that cannot profit you but there's a voice calling us this morning there's a voice calling us right now calling you higher calling you out of your condition calling you out of your situation [Music] no hallelujah glory to god hallelujah i'm here to answer the call oh it's a sweet sounding voice of jesus oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i can imagine the prophet one time heard that voice he heard it in this rustling of a popular three tree said it was a young boy at the time praise god and that voice spoke to him out of the tree and said don't eat or drink anything ungodly or defile your body in any way because i have a ministry for you when you get older and the prophet always remembered that voice because when he heard it again he said that that same voice that i heard out of popular tree is that same boy speaking to me again ah hallelujah saying son of man look look at these things although it was that same voice oh and it's the same voice today that is calling you that voice called a prophet to call you oh glory that voice called the prophet hallelujah hallelujah again a prophetic authority to call your name from out of the book and here you are this morning you are the words of the book oh you are going to be made manifest in your time in your season in your hour don't be afraid don't be dismayed the lord thy god shall go with thee with us whoever i go it and he shall give you good success all you gotta do is meditate on the word day and night and every place the soul of your foot shall tread upon shall be given unto you [Music] hallelujah hallelujah baba said he came on to his own and his own receive him not he came into his own house and to his own people and they rejected him and they turned him aside oh isn't that right they turned him down but the bible said as many as receive him to them give he power to become the sons of god to them who have the ability to hear the voice of god the bride you the elect lady a special class of people the prophet described this i remember stephen thompson a special class of people that god has on the urge today to hear the voice of god oh the church has turned them out america turned him out but you answered a call oh allah we are badger skins we ain't nothing praise god but god predestinated a church fourteen hallelujah to receive this glorious message oh how can i stay silent oh hallelujah the lion had roared who cannot fear the lord god had spoken who can but prophesy oh hallelujah hallelujah who can't but testify all the things that are fixing to take place oh the bride has a secret what is the secret the word is in the pride oh hallelujah and she's prophesying well it's gonna be it shall be i'm gonna make it oh god said so i heard his voice the devil tried to pull you this way and that way but the bride has something inside of a soul she heard an echo of the trumpet of the seven thunder jubilee trumpet sounding in her heart faith but you know the temperature is probably kind of charity hallelujah praise god that seventh seal seventh hundred message is shouting is sounding out this morning by revelation and by manifestation we believe it amen amen hallelujah oh glory isn't that right oh he that heard my words i'm believing on him that sent me had eternal life he'd believe it on me though he was dead yet shall he live he that lived and believeth in me shall never die believe us thou this said the prophet amen says the pride 2022 praise god hallelujah nothing certain about that he shall nothing uncertain about that he shall live amen my quickly now noah heard the voice of god it was preparing to save his life i'm getting ready to close out and he followed the instructions she stood he said that prophet said that if a man hears the voice he said now listen he's a prophet wisdom he said now listen catch this real good don't fail if a man hears the voice of something and it's proven to be the voice of god and on time then that proceeds forth from the man heavens on earth will pass away but that word that he gave the man will never pass away so if god gives you something this morning if god spoke to your heart heaven and earth will pass away but that word he gave you will never pass away praise god hallelujah it must be fulfilled amen isn't that right so you hold to god's unchanging hand this morning if god said he'll heal you he'll heal you if god said he deliberately he'll deliver you if god said he'll restore you he'll restore you that's the voice of god to you oh hallelujah oh glory noah heard the voice and condemned the world and they laughed in his face the prophet said because his message didn't cope with their scientific achievements but it rained and destroyed the whole world see his voice that went forth the seed was laying there he said prophet said in every age it's been the same way oh my see isn't alright moses when he heard the voice of god was full of theology he knew all the ins and outs but it failed but when he heard the voice of god moses was never the same he said that no man is ever the same you might hear in your ears a voice speaking but when you hear it in your heart see then is when you're hearing prophet said you don't see what you you do not see what you are you look at your eye he said but you see with your heart many many many man psalms 23 and verse 9 says the voice of the lord is upon the waters the voice of the glory the god of glory thundereth the lord is upon many waters oh hallelujah the voice of the lord is powerful the voice of the lord is full of majesty the voice of the lord breaketh the cedars yea the lord break at the cedars of lebanon he maketh them also to skip like a calf lebanon and syrian like a young unicorn the lord of the voice of the lord divided the flames of fire the voice of the lord shake at the wilderness the lord shaketh the wilderness of kadesh the bible said the voice of the lord maketh the hands to calve and discovers the forest and in his temple that everyone speak of his glory the lord sitteth upon the flood yea the lord sitteth as king forever and the lord will give strength unto his people he is giving strength to you this morning the lord will bless his people with peace oh the voice of the lord it gives you peace peace in the midst of the storm peace in the midst of the valley oh holla he can calm the storm in you oh hallelujah hallelujah peace be still don't you worry don't you be afraid he has predestinated you unto adoption he has predestinated you unto perfection he has predestinated you unto a wonderful glorious baptism of the holy ghost and fire the voice of the lord is speaking the day you hear his voice heart not your heart but receive the voice of the law [Applause] blow our trumpet in zion sound alarm in the holy mountain hallelujah let the tribes go up let the people go up let the worshipers arise let the sons and the daughters sing oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah somebody gave him praise musicians could come hallelujah [Music] [Applause] of god this morning while he's calling while he's calling do not pass me by oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah yes voice this morning his voice calling you calling you oh hallelujah unto perfection oh hallelujah now we know what happened when god came down upon the mountain it was so scary he said don't let moses speak god don't let god speak sorry let moses speak oh we don't want god to speak and so from that time god veiled
