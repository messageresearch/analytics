[12:15] i call him a friend a real friend
[12:18] he's gone to the other shore
[12:21] and brother knights was a person who had
[12:24] a passion for
[12:26] to serve the saints
[12:28] duplicating the tapes have a passion for
[12:30] the library
[12:32] to make sure that there's food in the
[12:33] storehouse
[12:35] and it was
[12:36] that the library was effective and he
[12:39] served
[12:40] and you know
[12:43] in the midst of his faults and he had
[12:45] them
[12:46] the midst of his failures and he had
[12:48] them
[12:49] in the midst of his weaknesses and he
[12:50] had them
[12:52] in the midst of all of that he was
[12:54] humble and sincere
[12:55] and honest
[12:58] and i admire that
[13:00] and his reputation of his honesty i know
[13:04] it
[13:05] it was all on his job he reconducted
[13:07] himself and so on
[13:09] and he was somebody quick to admit his
[13:11] false quick to
[13:13] correct things he was a willing school

[17:26] good night saints
[17:28] greetings in the precious name of our
[17:30] lord and savior jesus christ
[17:32] you know
[17:34] myself from our nights we went we go
[17:36] back a real long distance
[17:39] in the 70s we were in enterprise
[17:44] in the 80s we passed through
[17:47] for a spin city in the 90s we went to
[17:49] san diego
[17:51] you know
[17:52] he was living up upper said babs i was
[17:54] doing western vibes i just want to share
[17:57] a few things that
[17:59] stay in my heart with the nights and his
[18:01] experience you know
[18:03] when he wanted to make a future
[18:06] in the police service he went into the
[18:07] barracks
[18:09] and after a couple of weeks he couldn't
[18:11] stand the treatment was given to
[18:13] recruits
[18:15] they were insulting them dehumanizing
[18:17] them kids and different things
[18:19] and he said this is no place for a son
[18:20] of god to be in you know
[18:22] and he tell me he said one morning he
[18:24] got up
[18:25] and he got done in prayer
[18:27] and he prayed and cry to god
[18:29] and we had to leave
[18:31] when the inspector came in the back that
[18:33] morning check on recruits
[18:35] all his baggage and stuff was all packed
[18:38] ready to leave
[18:40] and they expected what is wrong with you
[18:42] he said i no longer belong to this
[18:44] institution he shocked the inspectors of
[18:47] christ he said no longer we've taken
[18:48] this humiliation
[18:51] and he's leaving and they took him to
[18:52] receive
[18:54] the
[18:54] superiors and he spoke to them and his
[18:57] but what is your future
[18:59] what you will do and you send the lord
[19:01] to make a way
[19:03] you know and that was so significant
[19:05] because he had his wife and his family
[19:07] and he made that stand for the word of
[19:09] god it so happened that we went south
[19:11] and my father was a
[19:13] licensed inspector he had some serious
[19:16] condition for the nights and
[19:18] it shocked him over the job and work and
[19:20] i applied for
[19:22] the job as a licensed specializing
[19:24] officer and he got the job
[19:26] and his future
[19:28] went that way i know he was a brother
[19:30] that never compromised
[19:34] and i could remember that
[19:36] when
[19:37] one brother from the church was going
[19:39] for his license
[19:40] and he went
[19:41] to the office he met by the night he was
[19:43] happy
[19:45] that but the knights going to be the
[19:47] officer taking him out on the road
[19:50] so robert took him on the road brought
[19:52] him back inside
[19:54] when he came in i
[19:55] told him he failed
[19:58] several nights he failed me say yes i
[20:00] have no choice
[20:01] so say not ready for the road yet
[20:03] something so i spoke about a night i
[20:05] said so you feel
[20:07] with jason
[20:09] you say yes
[20:10] he said
[20:11] he is not ready
[20:14] he can drive but he's not ready to go on
[20:16] the road because
[20:18] he will be one of those that would be
[20:19] causing accent but he's not disappointed
[20:21] but he learned
[20:23] his lesson but nice never compromised
[20:25] was a brother
[20:26] or not a brother he had
[20:28] to pass the test
[20:31] and later on jason passed the examiner
[20:33] on but the night was one guy never ever
[20:36] compromised when they spoke about all
[20:38] these licensing officers always said
[20:39] there's one person like officer that is
[20:42] not taking bribe he's standing firm
[20:45] when that corruption from parts of the
[20:47] institution the center
[20:49] arima the correctly introduced centered
[20:52] chagonis and different things because of
[20:54] a stand for the lord and stand as a
[20:56] brother not a compromise i remember when
[21:00] the young people
[21:01] was having our first young people
[21:03] meeting
[21:04] he decided to have it in his father's
[21:06] house and that was a momentous
[21:09] decision
[21:10] and a history
[21:12] this historic
[21:14] decision also that when we went here and
[21:16] we got it for the first time the young
[21:18] people
[21:19] the pillar fire came down
[21:21] the holy ghost came and
[21:24] it just came to the window and tackled
[21:26] all these young people
[21:28] and
[21:29] it was such an experience
[21:32] when nobody father came he didn't look
[21:34] in the room he was
[21:36] amazed he was scared
[21:38] he said my god what have they done to
[21:40] these young people they were all spread
[21:42] out on the ground and
[21:44] people are coming from different parts
[21:46] of
[21:48] belmont because
[21:49] it's on a hill and the noise was
[21:52] recognized in the valley
[21:54] and one sister began to sing
[21:57] and she was hardly moving her lips but
[21:59] she was singing like an angel and we
[22:01] were hearing organs and abs coming
[22:04] through the
[22:05] windows and filling the whole house it
[22:06] was a real tremendous experience for the
[22:09] young people
[22:11] and that started revival among the young
[22:13] people
[22:15] and
[22:16] you know
[22:17] a couple years ago about two years ago i
[22:19] know but he i've got an archivist he
[22:22] always has things from way back he wants
[22:25] to know but remember the step you say
[22:27] yes and you get the fear
[22:28] all old messages and different things
[22:30] about two years ago after a series came
[22:32] when he had a piece of paper a piece of
[22:35] copybook page and he was folding it up
[22:38] he said read that when i opened it out
[22:41] it was some prophecies from since 1982
[22:45] amongst the young people
[22:47] that he just brought and hand me
[22:50] and one of the prophecies was
[22:52] that god was speaking he said
[22:55] do not follow your friends
[22:57] your friends do not know the way
[23:00] i am the way
[23:01] and i will baptize you with the holy
[23:04] ghost that was in
[23:06] 1982 in 1983
[23:09] the baptism was also poured and the
[23:12] revival started
[23:14] and you know
[23:15] we've been
[23:16] together he'll even opposite bobs and
[23:18] iron my rifling horse and babson
[23:21] different places together so we had a
[23:22] real tremendous time and then coming
[23:24] down in life when
[23:26] about 15 years ago his wife died and
[23:29] you know he was going through a time of
[23:31] depression and different things and
[23:32] we've got to them
[23:34] myself
[23:35] i've got a clown's clock and one day we
[23:36] went to the mall
[23:38] to fellowship and the satanist and he is
[23:40] talking about you want to go with the
[23:42] lord and this that he does not happy
[23:43] time to eat and clarence turned to me he
[23:46] said terry we have to get a wife this
[23:48] brother are we going to lose him
[23:51] so god by the way
[23:54] i'm going to my wife and sister grace
[23:56] and says the grace praise the lord thank
[23:58] you for the service that you have done
[24:00] for our nights over the years with all
[24:01] his faults and all that he's been
[24:03] through and the part of his sickness you
[24:04] know and then coming down when he
[24:07] started
[24:07] to get sick you know i have this similar
[24:10] problem with pee inside pain she used to
[24:12] lean on me
[24:13] but then he started having more pains
[24:14] and more suffering than me and different
[24:16] things
[24:17] so i started to answer nobody have to
[24:19] fight the opinions and do not live on
[24:22] the anti on the um
[24:23] painkillers because you get
[24:26] a custom thing
[24:28] and be a bad thing for you because this
[24:30] is one of the things that happens a lot
[24:32] of people
[24:33] that they get hooked on the painkillers
[24:35] we started to ease off the painkillers
[24:37] and will bear the pains and then when
[24:39] they say battery
[24:41] i have so much painkillers toward them
[24:43] send me two cards
[24:44] of being pleased to help me because he
[24:46] was taking it on and off on different
[24:48] things you know
[24:50] coming down
[24:52] later on he told me that they want to
[24:54] operate on his back
[24:56] let me tell them not his back
[24:58] he's too old and last year he said god
[25:01] give him the allotted time
[25:03] of three scores and ten and he is going
[25:06] to make it nothing going to stop him
[25:08] from seeing his allotted time that one
[25:11] different treats wasn't 10. so he made
[25:13] the streets close and 10 last year
[25:15] he said everything after that
[25:18] is running up
[25:19] so i believe that but a nice new he was
[25:22] about to leave
[25:24] because he tell me that he have decided
[25:26] to take this surgery
[25:28] on his posture he was seeing
[25:30] it as a way out and on friday when i
[25:32] spoke with him
[25:34] told him he shed you for tuesday and
[25:36] just to pray for him he was so positive
[25:39] about
[25:40] this surgery
[25:42] that he's going to take that he was seen
[25:44] like it was relieved about all his pains
[25:46] and was affliction so i believe in my
[25:48] heart he was prepared he made certain
[25:50] things
[25:51] right and ready for his family different
[25:53] things and he was prepared because after
[25:55] he came out of the surgery
[25:57] he asked his daughter he said
[25:59] i am alive she said yes you're alive
[26:03] so it was something like if he didn't
[26:04] expect to come out of his life he
[26:07] expected to go with the lord
[26:09] so nothing is altercated you know god
[26:12] gave us boundaries we just cannot pass
[26:14] we'll all miss our brother
[26:17] he has shown tabernacles one member shot
[26:20] today we'll miss him
[26:22] for his styles that he has taken over
[26:25] the years
[26:26] to give counsel advice to pray for the
[26:29] sick and the things that he have done
[26:30] amongst us as an elder i will miss him
[26:33] and we'll be fellowship
[26:35] and give me some good advice and
[26:36] different things and i would like to say
[26:38] to the family that
[26:41] be strong
[26:43] because he stood and faced all the
[26:46] challenge in his affliction
[26:48] and in his suffering he stood he's still
[26:51] tall
[26:52] standing on the lord's side
[26:56] he has
[26:57] fought a good fight of faith
[27:00] he has finished his course
[27:02] now he has gone on to his reward
[27:05] it fellas what among us
[27:07] and with
[27:08] his first wife
[27:11] and all the saints

[28:02] hey man thank you so much brother
[28:04] terrence at this time i'd like to invite
[28:06] uh brother michael blackman
[28:08] uh to
[28:09] say a few words god bless you brother
[28:11] mike
[28:14] goodnight brothers and sisters and in
[28:16] the lord
[28:18] tonight
[28:20] i just want to share a few of my
[28:22] memories
[28:24] of my precious brother
[28:26] i called him more than a brother he was
[28:28] my buddy he was my friend
[28:31] and uh
[28:32] like like brother terry
[28:35] we lived for a while
[28:37] close to each other he until we lived in
[28:39] saint bob's
[28:41] and i was going down in belmont
[28:45] no one became
[28:47] my friend i mean we shared a special
[28:50] friendship
[28:51] which was based really on the fact that
[28:54] we kind of helped each other
[28:58] carry all burdens
[29:00] noble and i became very close when i was
[29:03] going through
[29:04] a rough patch in my life
[29:07] and uh he would come and visit me
[29:10] guy was working you know and i have free
[29:12] time and so on and you'll be on the road
[29:14] as a licensing officer
[29:16] uh
[29:17] and he would be out on the road and he
[29:19] would pop in
[29:20] to this school where i would
[29:22] um in order to understand he'd sit down
[29:24] on fellowship and you know he really
[29:27] strengthened me he really strengthened
[29:29] me
[29:30] um
[29:32] he was somebody that i could share my
[29:35] innermost fears and
[29:38] feelings with and um
[29:41] he did the same
[29:43] so there was that that mutual
[29:45] respect for each other that mutual love
[29:48] for each other
[29:49] that mutual understanding that
[29:52] sometimes we need somebody to help us
[29:54] carry that that load
[29:56] we know that jesus is there
[29:59] but sometimes jesus needs
[30:01] hands and feet
[30:03] that are real
[30:04] so that no one was was was that that
[30:08] brother who stood shoulder to shoulder
[30:10] with me
[30:11] and that is when our
[30:13] our closeness grew
[30:15] and as a story with with let's see
[30:19] um unnecessarily said
[30:21] there were times when and nobody would
[30:23] um
[30:24] you know with a little depression a
[30:27] little negativity about
[30:30] a situation or something
[30:33] and you know i would encourage him
[30:36] i would tell him something you know um
[30:39] based on the scripture
[30:42] and then he would you know his
[30:43] responsibility you know i never saw it
[30:45] like that
[30:46] mike you know never i really never said
[30:48] like that thoughts you know and he would
[30:50] get changed man
[30:52] that was the nice thing about nobody
[30:54] know that once you could
[30:56] show him something from the scripture he
[30:58] would hold on to it
[31:01] and he would he would write that and
[31:03] that would strengthen him
[31:06] so
[31:08] tonight i really want to
[31:11] tell you lord thanks for having
[31:13] had the experience
[31:15] of having somebody like brother knights
[31:19] um you know he had his wheeze
[31:21] he had he was he was a stickler but
[31:23] doing things the right way
[31:26] so i would say that he he was always
[31:28] seeking excellence
[31:29] uh even in terms of the the church with
[31:32] the videotaping and so on we will talk
[31:34] about that many times you know i'm
[31:36] training up the young people
[31:38] behind the cameras
[31:41] and the the library and stuff you know
[31:43] so he was always
[31:45] reviewing
[31:46] what was being done
[31:48] with an eye to doing it better
[31:51] so he was never content
[31:53] with just being good
[31:56] and you know i remember saying that good
[31:57] is the enemy
[31:59] of excellent of being excellent
[32:01] and nobody wasn't content with being
[32:03] good
[32:04] nobody strove for excellence
[32:07] and you know sometimes that might have
[32:10] made him seem like a hard task master
[32:14] but
[32:15] um if you understood what his motive and
[32:19] objective was
[32:20] then you know it gave you decrease to
[32:22] deal with
[32:24] um with him at times when he wouldn't
[32:26] settle for what somebody else was quite
[32:28] content and happy with and it might have
[32:31] seemed like he was nitpicking or finding
[32:33] a fault but really
[32:35] what he was doing was pushing someone or
[32:38] pushing an operation or something that
[32:40] was being done he was pushing it
[32:43] to to get into that that that level
[32:47] where it would be they would move
[32:49] from good to excellent
[32:53] as brother who said
[32:56] a funny side
[32:57] i remember
[32:59] uh
[33:00] several several
[33:01] meetings and you know fellowships and so
[33:03] on then we might be celebrating
[33:05] somebody's birthday
[33:06] or something like that that time the
[33:08] trip was very small and we were donald
[33:11] for the supreme brother nathan as our
[33:13] pastor
[33:15] and you know we would we were small
[33:16] churches at the time when everybody
[33:18] lived in the same community
[33:20] so we would be what we would get
[33:22] together very very often each other's
[33:24] houses all the time
[33:26] and um
[33:27] no one was the one who
[33:29] would with the tell a little joke or a
[33:32] snippet from something that happened in
[33:34] his life you know
[33:35] um all nice looking fun and i would be
[33:38] his rival
[33:40] so
[33:41] i remember a particular birthday at a
[33:43] brother what was going on to build the
[33:45] lord and so on you know
[33:46] where we were trying to all do each
[33:48] other but you know
[33:50] little jokes that had everybody you know
[33:52] laughing and rolling so
[33:54] as much as he was a very uh
[33:57] you know very serious person
[34:00] in terms of
[34:01] how he executed
[34:03] um
[34:04] how he's he functioned in his role
[34:06] whatever whatever you gave him or what
[34:08] to do you know if he was in charge of
[34:10] something and similarly with his family
[34:13] you know um the bible speaks about how
[34:15] and how a person who wants an officer in
[34:17] the church how they should
[34:20] run their family or they should rule
[34:21] over their family and nobody took that
[34:22] to her but he also had a very light and
[34:26] juvenile side
[34:28] which we also enjoyed
[34:30] and um nobody was one who has terry said
[34:34] he never compromised on his integrity
[34:37] i after a while you know people had
[34:40] his reputation group people knew who he
[34:42] was his reputation preceded him
[34:45] so that um
[34:46] i could remember more than once
[34:49] walking with nobody through the streets
[34:51] i think he would have visited
[34:53] come on by me maybe like you know
[34:55] sometime after school and let's move on
[34:57] we'd be walking back
[34:59] to tom for something
[35:01] and all no one would after they stand up
[35:03] on a corner
[35:04] and look at the taxi drivers breaking
[35:06] the law and they all knew that man from
[35:08] the time he stood there you know you
[35:10] will see people
[35:12] straightening up getting in line doing
[35:13] whatever they have to do
[35:15] so
[35:16] he had a reputation for for being a
[35:18] no-nonsense type of person as well you
[35:21] know he believed what that you should
[35:23] always do
[35:25] what was right and that you should
[35:26] always be doing the right thing
[35:28] as terry said i've been relating to me
[35:32] that they had sent him to san fernando
[35:34] he salted the island because they wanted
[35:37] him to clean up
[35:38] some of the current practices that were
[35:40] going on going on up there
[35:43] and he was telling me how
[35:45] some of the people would have
[35:46] collaborated to try to keep him
[35:49] away from from doing just that you know
[35:53] but he was a fighter
[35:55] and um
[35:57] no but like i said you know we shared
[35:59] each other's mood and of course there
[36:01] was a sense of sadness on my part
[36:04] uh where we moved apart for a bit
[36:06] because he lived in the east of the
[36:08] island
[36:10] and i was in the northwest
[36:12] uh so that i couldn't visit him as often
[36:15] as i would have liked to
[36:17] um of course there was always a sense of
[36:19] sadness in that
[36:21] this last leg of his journey
[36:23] i could not have been
[36:25] there
[36:26] to give him the kind of support i would
[36:28] have wanted but i always felt
[36:29] comfortable in the fact that there was a
[36:31] brother popcorn cruise by it was clara
[36:34] exclusive
[36:35] and um actually when we when i found out
[36:39] when his
[36:40] daughter um told me his condition with
[36:42] his septic shock and i was praying
[36:46] i was saying to the lord you know well
[36:48] you know if you want to take him you
[36:49] know there's nothing we could do but i
[36:51] mean we really would like to have him
[36:53] around a little longer
[36:55] and i was sharing with somebody that i
[36:56] was actually
[36:58] sitting down and seeing myself
[37:00] spending
[37:02] a couple days in a week by nobody
[37:05] while he was comparison
[37:07] you know see if he came out of it
[37:10] that was my intention you know to spend
[37:12] some time with him because i i knew that
[37:15] if he came out of it we will have to
[37:18] to support him in order to strengthen
[37:20] his mind strength his spirit and that
[37:22] kind of thing
[37:23] so
[37:24] that is what i would like to to leave
[37:27] with with
[37:28] with with the brothers and the sisters
[37:30] tonight that nobody was what you call a
[37:33] brother's brother
[37:34] he was someone who would stand
[37:37] shoulder-to-shoulder with you
[37:39] who would go with you through thick and
[37:41] thin
[37:42] with all compromise as terrorism
[37:46] but he was always there he was always
[37:48] supportive
[37:49] he was always there to create and
[37:52] whenever whatever rule or function that
[37:55] nobody took up
[37:56] he's true for excellence
[37:59] and i remember where the corporate shame
[38:01] with me
[38:02] that nobody would have said to him
[38:05] if anything happens during this
[38:06] operation remember
[38:09] that i have run my race
[38:11] i have finished the course
[38:13] and i think he would have and
[38:15] incidentally he was quite wrong he shot
[38:17] the church several times by winning the
[38:19] fun video dash and family days
[38:21] nobody knew he was so free to foot
[38:25] but yes
[38:26] no one has run the race
[38:28] and he has finished his course
[38:31] and it was a pleasure
[38:34] to have had a brother like this
[38:36] so close to me and as an older one and
[38:39] an elder
[38:40] of course i would have learned a lot
[38:42] from him but he was never
[38:45] never too
[38:47] too big or never so far above anyone
[38:50] that you could not share with him that
[38:52] he could not learn from you all he asked
[38:55] is that you would have some ground some
[38:58] grounds some foundation based on
[39:00] scripture for your advice
[39:02] and he was open to it
[39:04] so to the family to the family to his
[39:07] wife and his family
[39:10] i just want to wish them
[39:12] all god's blessings and grace
[39:15] and
[39:16] i just wanted this drop this year a
[39:18] couple days before nova pass my wife
[39:20] told me she had a dream she just woke up
[39:22] at like four o'clock in the morning she
[39:24] asked me
[39:25] how is normal
[39:26] i said well he's okay he's preparing for
[39:28] an operation she said you know i had a
[39:29] dream that he passed
[39:31] and she was sharing with me afterwards
[39:33] that he looked very happy when he was
[39:34] leaving
[39:36] so
[39:37] you know there's a scripture which says
[39:38] that you know
[39:40] we sorrowed not as the others in the
[39:41] world sorrow because of what we know
[39:44] where we know they are and nobody was
[39:47] looking for a certain quality of life
[39:49] after the operation
[39:51] and if god chose to take him it means
[39:53] god lose them from that word
[39:55] that quality of life that he definitely
[39:58] was not enjoying on that last day
[40:00] because of his health issues so we in a
[40:02] way we can be thankful that he's now in
[40:04] a better place no more pain no more
[40:07] sorrow
[40:08] and he's living a much better life
[40:10] so
[40:11] god bless you all saints god bless the
[40:13] family may they be strengthened may god
[40:15] give them grace and your
[40:17] may they do all that love they know
[40:19] nobody would have wanted for them as
[40:21] they continue along their julian life
[40:24] god bless you
[40:27] thank you so much uh brother blackman we
[40:29] really appreciate that at this time i'd
[40:31] like to invite brother george congoley
[40:33] to say a few words
[40:44] i wanna extend greetings to
[40:48] everyone listening
[40:50] especially the immediate family of
[40:52] baronites
[40:54] wife and children and
[40:56] in-laws
[40:58] nieces nephews wherever they may be
[41:04] tonight i
[41:10] really don't know
[41:11] what to say tonight
[41:14] so i have decided i'll
[41:18] i'll read a little something here
[41:21] and trust that it may be a comfort to
[41:24] everyone
[41:27] and it goes you say here not long ago
[41:30] about 150 years
[41:32] ago there was a great christian
[41:35] in the southwest united states
[41:38] his name was daniel quarry
[41:41] a wonderful man a godly man
[41:43] a sainted man
[41:45] a real christian
[41:47] a man that everybody taught so much of a
[41:49] wonderful person
[41:51] the story goes that he died
[41:53] where he went into a trance
[41:55] and he said as he went up to heaven of
[41:58] course when he died
[42:00] when he got to the pulley gate the
[42:01] caretaker came to the door and said who
[42:03] are you
[42:05] and he said i am the evangelist daniel
[42:07] quarry
[42:09] i've won thousands of souls to christ
[42:11] and i want to come in this morning
[42:14] my life's journey has ended on earth i
[42:16] have no place to go now
[42:20] so when daniel curry came there to the
[42:22] gate they went in said
[42:24] well
[42:26] we'll see if you got your name here
[42:28] they looked all wrong and they couldn't
[42:30] find any name
[42:32] he said there's no daniel curry here
[42:36] he said oh surely
[42:38] i am an evangelist he said i want soul
[42:41] surprise i've tried to do the thing
[42:42] that's right
[42:44] the caretaker said sir i'm sorry to tell
[42:46] you
[42:47] but there's no daniel quarry here
[42:51] he said but do you want to appeal your
[42:53] case you can't appeal it to the white
[42:55] throne judgment if you want to
[42:58] but he said
[43:00] we have no mercy for you
[43:02] at all because you don't have you you
[43:04] don't have your name here
[43:06] there's no mercy for you
[43:08] he said do you want to appeal your case
[43:11] he said sir what more can i do but
[43:13] appeal my case
[43:15] he said well then you can go
[43:17] at the white rune judgment and appeal
[43:19] your case there
[43:22] daniel curry said that he felt himself
[43:24] going through the space for about an
[43:26] hour
[43:27] said he came into a place it got lighter
[43:30] lighter lighter
[43:31] lighter
[43:33] he said farther he went the lighter it
[43:35] got
[43:36] it was a hundred thousand hundred
[43:38] thousand times brighter than the sun
[43:41] ever shined
[43:43] and he said he was trembling trembling
[43:46] and he said when he got into the middle
[43:48] of that light he heard a voice say
[43:51] were you perfect on earth
[43:53] he said he just came out of the leg
[43:55] he said no i wasn't perfect he got
[43:57] trembling
[43:58] said did you always play honest with
[44:00] everybody
[44:01] he said no
[44:03] said a few things came into my mind that
[44:05] i wasn't exactly honest about said no
[44:08] i guess i wasn't honest
[44:10] he said did you tell the truth in every
[44:12] case in your life
[44:14] he said no i remember some things i have
[44:16] told that was
[44:18] shady
[44:20] i never exactly i was never truthful
[44:22] just exactly
[44:24] he said then
[44:26] did you ever take anything that did not
[44:28] belong to you anything money anything
[44:30] else that didn't belong to you
[44:33] said he taught a note he was a pretty
[44:34] good fellow
[44:37] but he was condemned
[44:38] he said no no i took things that didn't
[44:41] belong to me
[44:43] he said then he wasn't perfect
[44:45] he said no i wasn't perfect
[44:50] said he was looking any minute for the
[44:51] blast to come from that great light
[44:54] from where the dove rested condemned
[44:58] he said this then he heard a voice
[45:00] behind him
[45:01] that was sweeter than any mother's voice
[45:04] he had ever heard
[45:06] said he turned to look
[45:07] and the sweetest face he had ever saw
[45:11] sweeter than any mother's face was
[45:12] standing before him
[45:14] and he said
[45:16] father
[45:18] daniel quarry stood for me down on earth
[45:21] it's true he wasn't perfect but he stood
[45:23] for me

[45:44] faults but the thing of it is that we
[45:47] stand for christ we have taken a stand
[45:49] for christ here on earth
[45:51] and he has taken a stand for us there
[45:54] when we get there the scripture tells us
[45:57] that absent from the body is to be
[45:59] present with the lord

[46:49] um
[46:51] i just want to read
[46:52] through the scriptures first
[46:55] this is taken from saint john
[46:59] chapter 11
[47:02] verse 11.
[47:04] these things
[47:06] said he
[47:08] and after he said unto them
[47:11] our friend
[47:12] lazarus
[47:13] sleep it
[47:15] i go with him
[47:18] that i may awaken out of sleep
[47:22] next script is thessalonians 4
[47:26] for this we say unto you by the will of
[47:28] the lord
[47:30] that we which are alive and remain unto
[47:32] the coming of the lord shall not
[47:35] prevent them which are asleep
[47:38] for the lord himself descend from heaven
[47:42] with a shout our voice
[47:44] the voice of the archangel
[47:46] with the trump of god and the dead in
[47:49] christ shall rise first
[47:51] then we which are alive and we men shall
[47:53] be caught up
[47:54] together with them in the air in the
[47:56] cloud
[47:57] to meet
[47:58] the lord up in the air
[48:01] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[48:03] wherefore comfort one another with these
[48:06] weights i'll take this these scriptures
[48:10] you know
[48:11] to
[48:13] kind of bring it in the context of bella
[48:15] knights in the sense of
[48:18] well nice was a brother
[48:21] he was a father
[48:23] he was a friend
[48:26] and
[48:29] there are so many things
[48:31] you know
[48:33] all the brethren testify of
[48:36] all that he used to do
[48:38] his is his jovial his his his excellence
[48:42] in in trying to get things done is
[48:44] stickler for being right and you know
[48:48] trying to get things in order
[48:50] and that is true
[48:52] and
[48:53] like i said as a brother
[48:56] i i had i have added or now the
[48:59] privilege
[49:01] to his last
[49:02] legs
[49:04] of this race
[49:06] in that um as a brother despite of
[49:10] the conditions he was in and the pain he
[49:12] was in
[49:13] many times you know
[49:15] we
[49:16] carrying carry him down to the hospital
[49:19] or whatever
[49:20] and we will be talking and or something
[49:23] he come across by me or i go our cousin
[49:25] and we will talk and many times
[49:28] as you see conditions of life comes
[49:31] and
[49:32] we will share things with each other and
[49:35] as a brother
[49:36] many times
[49:38] i
[49:39] learn and receive so much comfort from
[49:42] his wisdom not just his knowledge his
[49:45] wisdom because the he had a way of
[49:49] you know
[49:50] taking the knowledge and putting him in
[49:53] potential context
[49:55] that
[49:57] you know the timings be right
[50:00] so i recognize that there was a wisdom
[50:03] about it
[50:04] and as a brother
[50:07] i learned a lot as a uh as brothers we
[50:11] share things
[50:13] as a
[50:14] father sometimes
[50:16] i and all sometimes
[50:18] we will talk and we most of the time we
[50:20] talk about each other
[50:22] and
[50:23] you know
[50:25] i know there are some inner parts of him
[50:27] where
[50:29] he will be so
[50:30] ingrieved you know because he wants so
[50:33] much first children he really loves sure
[50:36] and he tries best to be a certain way
[50:39] and i know sometimes as
[50:41] you know we know that many times he
[50:44] he do things a certain way as brother
[50:48] uh black one say he was just trying to
[50:51] strive for excellence and sometimes it
[50:54] is misunderstood
[50:56] you know and i know manchester you know
[50:58] children maybe think he was a bit hard
[51:01] but
[51:02] is that is his love and trying to be
[51:06] the to get them to be the best that they
[51:09] could be
[51:10] as a result of that
[51:12] i know
[51:13] many times in the painting
[51:16] and we will pray we will talk we will
[51:18] laugh
[51:19] you know
[51:20] and like i said
[51:22] there was so many things that
[51:26] we we cherish together as
[51:29] you know and i i received from him from
[51:32] our fatherly context as a friend
[51:34] well i couldn't ask a better friend
[51:37] you know
[51:38] i mean
[51:39] uh
[51:42] you know
[51:44] i will miss him i i know i mean
[51:47] you know the things that
[51:49] we go through the things that we share
[51:51] um
[51:53] yeah so much and
[51:55] it it
[51:56] it you know there's a song that say
[51:59] um
[52:01] when we are sunday party give us inward
[52:03] pain
[52:05] but we shall be
[52:06] joining heart when we meet
[52:09] when we meet again
[52:10] and it's something like that because
[52:13] you know
[52:16] as a friend
[52:18] like i said so many things that he
[52:20] taught me
[52:21] so many things that many times you know
[52:25] i know sometimes i go down in a kind of
[52:27] depth
[52:29] of depression in that
[52:32] you know in our way you know things
[52:34] burning you know and when you talk to
[52:36] him the way he have a way he will just
[52:39] say things comforting he might make a
[52:41] joke and bring it in such a way and
[52:44] you know
[52:45] so
[52:46] [Music]
[52:47] i just want to say
[52:50] to the
[52:52] wife
[52:52] sister grace
[52:55] keep strong
[52:56] brother nice
[52:59] as everyone say he run his race his
[53:02] final legacy
[53:04] to the children
[53:06] i just want to
[53:07] tell you that
[53:09] your father really loved you
[53:12] and
[53:13] he constantly
[53:15] pray for you and
[53:18] one time brother where to your preacher
[53:19] mentions that um
[53:22] not because somebody sleeping
[53:25] i i i try not to i did for this for him
[53:29] i wouldn't say he's dead i say he's
[53:31] sleeping
[53:33] because i i wouldn't say goodbye i would
[53:35] say until
[53:37] so as he sleep at now
[53:41] you know
[53:42] i wanted to try and remember
[53:45] those things that he tried to
[53:48] pass on to you
[53:49] try and remember the wisdom
[53:52] that he had to share
[53:54] because i know a lot of a lot of times
[53:58] it was misunderstood but i'm sure if you
[54:01] look back now you can see a lot of
[54:03] things that
[54:04] he would have told and share with you
[54:08] uh when you go contrary later on you see
[54:12] it woke up if you didn't do it so
[54:14] i i just want to say it to the children
[54:17] try and remember the wisdom that your
[54:19] father showed and the things that he
[54:22] tried to get to you all and
[54:24] remember he he have prayed and i know
[54:27] god will answer this prayer to the
[54:29] church
[54:30] i want to say that as
[54:33] one brother say we'll miss her so there
[54:36] but
[54:37] i take
[54:38] these
[54:40] conditions
[54:41] to show that
[54:44] you know
[54:46] when one go down
[54:48] to the dust and go to sleep
[54:51] it should
[54:52] give us some encouragement
[54:55] for us to recognize that they are
[54:57] waiting on us
[54:59] we have something because they they
[55:02] they will love to be here but for we for
[55:04] them to be here we had to bring them
[55:06] back
[55:07] so these this this this
[55:10] this this
[55:12] to get us you want to put it but as you
[55:14] say we sleep it he's sleeping it's
[55:16] something that we should realize that
[55:17] listen this is only giving us an
[55:20] incentive
[55:21] it's not something that we should we
[55:23] will get paid we will feel good but it
[55:27] is something that is to remind us that
[55:30] listen
[55:32] they are waiting on us
[55:34] we need to come to that to that point we
[55:37] have to get the holy ghost we have to
[55:40] get to that point that we could become
[55:43] what we need to be so the voice of that
[55:46] resurrection could be true us
[55:48] because as
[55:50] i read this script here jesus said i go
[55:53] wicked
[55:54] and at some point in time that same
[55:56] jesus must be in us we've got to find
[55:59] that place these are encouragements
[56:02] this this this passing on is to just
[56:05] provoke us to recognize hey
[56:08] we got to do something because they
[56:10] depending on us so
[56:12] i want to say that
[56:15] am happy and thankful for the time that
[56:18] the lord has crossed our paths and give
[56:20] me the opportunity
[56:22] the vibrant night's friend
[56:26] brother
[56:27] and he being a part of me and i want to
[56:30] just thank everyone and those that are
[56:32] listening
[56:33] uh
[56:34] just just just know that
[56:37] we have something to do and
[56:39] better night is waiting on us all the
[56:41] rest of bridging are within us so come
[56:44] on let's
[56:46] rally wrong together where the world is
[56:48] concerned get our lives together clean
[56:50] up
[56:51] and
[56:53] get prepared because they will cheer on
[56:55] us god bless you

[57:09] really want to express our deepest
[57:11] condolences to the family but the night
[57:14] was very special to us and
[57:17] it has fallen my lot to also say a few
[57:19] things and to
[57:21] give a very brief exhortations in church
[57:24] so i just want to read one scripture
[57:25] before i start tonight
[57:27] and if i found a scripture that i
[57:30] believe describes by the night's life
[57:32] and his testimony and you'll see where i
[57:34] go with it by the grace of god is it'll
[57:36] be this in isaiah
[57:37] 43 and reading from verse 1
[57:40] but now thus saith the lord that created
[57:43] thee o jacob and he that formed thee o
[57:46] israel
[57:47] fear not for i have redeemed thee
[57:50] i have called thee by thy name thou art
[57:52] mine when thou passes through the waters
[57:56] i will be with thee and through the
[57:58] rivers
[57:59] thou shall not overflow thee when the
[58:02] walk is through the fire thou shalt not
[58:04] be burned
[58:05] neither shall the flame kindle upon thee
[58:09] for i am the lord thy god
[58:11] the holy one of israel thy savior
[58:14] i give egypt for thy ransom ethiopia and
[58:17] saba for thee
[58:18] sins that was precious in my sight
[58:21] thou hast been honorable and i have
[58:24] loved thee
[58:25] therefore will i give men for thee and
[58:28] people for thy life
[58:30] fear not for i am with thee
[58:33] i will bring thy seed from the east and
[58:35] gather thee from the west i will say to
[58:37] the north give up unto the south keep
[58:40] not back
[58:41] bring my sons from far and my daughters
[58:43] from the ends of the earth
[58:45] even everyone that is called by my name
[58:48] for i have created him for my glory i
[58:51] have formed him yea i have made him may
[58:54] the lord
[58:55] bless the reading of his word shall we
[58:57] just pray heavenly father we thank you
[58:59] tonight for this
[59:01] body of believers friends family
[59:04] well-wishers who have gathered lord not
[59:06] because they have nothing better to do
[59:09] but because of a life well-lived
[59:12] a life of purpose
[59:14] a life that has touched us in so many
[59:18] ways
[59:18] that we feel compelled tonight to pay
[59:21] respects
[59:22] to honor his life
[59:24] and to take something from him that we
[59:26] can remember so may you bless the
[59:28] reading of the word may you bless this

[59:40] church and may you be with us we commit
[59:42] this
[59:43] lord time into your hands in the
[59:45] precious theme of jesus christ amen and
[59:47] amen
[59:48] for as long as i've known myself i've
[59:51] known brother nobod knights
[59:54] he was not someone i met
[59:56] as i was growing up he was just someone
[59:58] who was always there
[1:00:01] so much has been said and quite honestly
[1:00:04] we could go all night
[1:00:06] speaking about brother knights
[1:00:08] but i would just like to share a little
[1:00:10] about his dedication to the service of
[1:00:13] the lord
[1:00:15] i remember services in arima where the
[1:00:17] knights would come with the video camera
[1:00:19] to set up to record these services
[1:00:22] he pioneered video recording for the
[1:00:24] church as we have today
[1:00:27] his are the shoulders that our tech team
[1:00:29] still stand on
[1:00:31] until today
[1:00:33] as has been said he had a desire to see
[1:00:36] things done a certain way he captured
[1:00:39] understood and embodied the vision
[1:00:42] of a ministry of perfection
[1:00:44] he would ask questions that would seem
[1:00:46] critical
[1:00:48] not out of a desire to criticize
[1:00:50] but to ensure that we were constantly
[1:00:53] working to find a better way and
[1:00:56] ultimately
[1:00:57] the perfect way
[1:00:59] but a knight served in almost every
[1:01:01] office
[1:01:02] in the church
[1:01:04] he was an usher
[1:01:06] he was a deacon
[1:01:07] he was a trustee
[1:01:09] and for most of his later years he
[1:01:11] served in the highest office he could as
[1:01:12] an elder in the church
[1:01:14] standing shoulder to shoulder with the
[1:01:17] other elders he stood watch over the
[1:01:19] affairs of the church
[1:01:21] and was an elder with oversight over the
[1:01:23] library
[1:01:24] and most importantly he operated
[1:01:26] as the aide they come to the pastor
[1:01:29] his was the duty to help manage who
[1:01:31] would see the pastor after a church
[1:01:33] service
[1:01:34] a position that he took very
[1:01:36] seriously when a visiting minister would
[1:01:39] come to minister it was by the knights
[1:01:41] who was charged with ensuring that the
[1:01:43] minister had everything he needed
[1:01:46] when we hosted our annual conventions it
[1:01:48] was by the knights who had the great
[1:01:50] responsibility of overseeing the
[1:01:52] logistics of getting the minister to the
[1:01:54] tabernacle he was reliable
[1:01:57] trustworthy
[1:01:59] committed
[1:02:00] diligent
[1:02:02] disciplined and above all else he was a
[1:02:04] believer
[1:02:06] he believed in jesus christ the same
[1:02:08] yesterday today and forever
[1:02:11] he believed that god sent a prophet
[1:02:13] with a message of deliverance and
[1:02:15] restoration that would take us back to
[1:02:17] the bible
[1:02:18] to the rapture
[1:02:20] to the resurrection
[1:02:22] he believed that no matter what you were
[1:02:24] going through
[1:02:25] the lord
[1:02:27] would make a way
[1:02:28] somehow
[1:02:31] if you really knew brother knights you
[1:02:33] would know that was one of his favorite
[1:02:34] songs
[1:02:36] the lord will make away somehow
[1:02:39] you don't have to take my word for it
[1:02:41] we can go back to the permanent record
[1:02:44] of his life
[1:02:45] and find where he testified
[1:02:48] that the lord
[1:02:49] would make a way somehow
[1:02:53] so for a few minutes i would like to
[1:02:54] take a title
[1:02:56] the lord
[1:02:57] will make a way
[1:02:58] somehow
[1:02:59] and before i speak just for a few
[1:03:01] minutes on it
[1:03:02] i would like to take us back
[1:03:04] just for a few minutes
[1:03:14] for another night if you would come up
[1:03:16] please amen
[1:03:17] and just grace us to the stage you
[1:03:19] appreciate our brother tonight
[1:03:21] amen amen first tonight
[1:03:27] [Music]
[1:03:30] people happy to be in the presence of
[1:03:31] the lord tonight
[1:03:33] let's give another shout out praise
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:57] a ship that tossed and driven
[1:04:02] batted by an angry sea
[1:04:08] when the storms of
[1:04:10] life origin
[1:04:13] its fury
[1:04:15] falls on me
[1:04:16] [Music]
[1:04:19] i wonder what i
[1:04:21] have done
[1:04:24] to
[1:04:34] cause the lord will make a way
[1:04:52] he will take away his sorrow
[1:04:57] so let him have your burden
[1:05:02] sometimes the lord bears long so heavy
[1:05:06] [Music]
[1:05:19] the lord will make
[1:05:21] [Music]
[1:05:31] i try to do the best i can
[1:05:37] but when i try to do the writing
[1:05:41] [Applause]
[1:05:42] he was present on every hand
[1:05:48] so many
[1:05:49] [Music]
[1:05:56] [Music]
[1:06:02] courage cause the lord will make away
[1:06:07] somehow
[1:06:10] the lord
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:25] [Music]
[1:06:27] so let him have your builders now
[1:06:43] but
[1:06:44] i find
[1:06:50] [Music]
[1:06:55] often there's misunderstandings
[1:06:58] [Music]
[1:07:00] all of all the good i do
[1:07:06] i go to friends for consolation
[1:07:09] [Music]
[1:07:11] i find them complaining too
[1:07:17] i look up and i wonder why
[1:07:22] more good fortunes pass me by
[1:07:29] [Music]
[1:07:32] [Laughter]
[1:07:39] the lord will make
[1:07:49] my god
[1:07:56] so let him have your burdens now
[1:08:02] sometimes the lord becomes so heavy
[1:08:07] the wind
[1:08:09] [Music]
[1:08:18] the lord will make a way
[1:08:23] [Music]
[1:08:35] he works in ways
[1:08:41] he will be
[1:08:45] [Music]
[1:08:58] with love and strength for each new day
[1:09:04] he
[1:09:09] [Music]
[1:09:13] god bless you
[1:09:19] [Music]
[1:09:22] amen
[1:09:24] you appreciate that song this evening
[1:09:27] and uh brother nice really really really
[1:09:30] really believe that and
[1:09:31] you know it's one of the first uh
[1:09:33] thoughts that came to me the lord will
[1:09:35] make a way somehow
[1:09:37] and but the knights really believe this
[1:09:40] and he sang it
[1:09:41] and
[1:09:43] when i believe this that the law will
[1:09:45] firstly make a way because
[1:09:48] he is god he could make
[1:09:51] a way
[1:09:53] where no way exists he can make a way
[1:09:57] when you cannot find a way he could make
[1:10:00] a way
[1:10:01] but this song which is a message in song
[1:10:04] is not just that god could make a way
[1:10:07] but that he will make a way it is a
[1:10:10] positive declaration that should inspire
[1:10:13] us all that god will make a way
[1:10:17] god through his word has made promises
[1:10:20] that have been fulfilled he made a way
[1:10:22] then
[1:10:24] he's making a way tonight and he will
[1:10:26] make a way
[1:10:28] he made a way for noah he made a way for
[1:10:31] abraham he made a way for david he made
[1:10:34] a way for joshua he made a way for paul
[1:10:36] he made a way for daniel he made it away
[1:10:38] for brother branham he made a way for
[1:10:40] peter he made a way for brother knights
[1:10:43] and he can make a way for you and i
[1:10:44] tonight because he's the same yesterday
[1:10:48] today and forever
[1:10:50] it is not just what he did but tonight
[1:10:52] he is making away
[1:10:54] we had a zoom room tonight
[1:10:57] and through this
[1:10:58] a way is being made right now for
[1:11:00] somebody
[1:11:01] but the knights found the way
[1:11:03] that god made for him
[1:11:06] somehow
[1:11:07] tonight a way is being made
[1:11:11] a way to salvation
[1:11:13] redemption perfection
[1:11:15] holiness peace
[1:11:18] away is being made to the holy ghost the
[1:11:20] revival tonight is part of somehow
[1:11:24] because god could use anything
[1:11:26] he could use anybody and he could use
[1:11:29] any meeting to make it possible for us
[1:11:31] to be reconciled with him
[1:11:35] i believe and brother knights believed
[1:11:37] that the lord
[1:11:38] will make a way somehow
[1:11:40] for us to have fellowship again
[1:11:43] i believe and very nice believe that the
[1:11:45] lord will make a way somehow for this
[1:11:48] church to come to perfection to bring on
[1:11:51] the resurrection
[1:11:53] somehow
[1:11:54] the lord will make a way somehow to
[1:11:56] restore your joy
[1:11:58] the lord will make a way somehow to
[1:12:01] restore peace
[1:12:02] the lord will make a way somehow to heal
[1:12:05] families
[1:12:06] the lord will make a way somehow
[1:12:09] to mend the broken pieces of our lives
[1:12:13] if you're backslidden tonight i can
[1:12:14] guarantee the lord will make a way
[1:12:17] somehow to restore
[1:12:20] the fact that you are here tonight is
[1:12:22] the lord making away somehow he is still
[1:12:25] using brother nice
[1:12:27] somehow brother knights like samson is
[1:12:30] doing more damage to satan's kingdom in
[1:12:33] his death than in his life
[1:12:35] because somehow i believe that there's
[1:12:37] someone on this call tonight that the
[1:12:39] lord
[1:12:40] wants to make a way for you as well
[1:12:44] the life that by the knights lived
[1:12:46] the testimony of his life
[1:12:48] the fact that you are here tonight
[1:12:51] and that pulsation in your heart is all
[1:12:54] by divine design
[1:12:57] tonight but the night is testifying
[1:13:00] not just that the lord will make a way
[1:13:02] but the lord made our way somehow
[1:13:05] because where he is he is testifying
[1:13:07] there's no more pain
[1:13:08] there's no more sorrow
[1:13:10] no more sickness
[1:13:12] no more sadness
[1:13:14] little did we know
[1:13:16] that but among us brother granville and
[1:13:19] so many others
[1:13:20] would have gone before to be there to
[1:13:23] welcome him
[1:13:24] now he too has joined the ranks
[1:13:27] he has been promoted to that group of
[1:13:30] believers who are waiting for the
[1:13:33] resurrection
[1:13:35] waiting for us to come to perfection
[1:13:38] somehow
[1:13:40] and i believe that the lord will make a
[1:13:42] way somehow
[1:13:43] for each one tonight
[1:13:46] i want to see by the nights again
[1:13:48] and i've said this so many times when
[1:13:50] i've been asked to say a few words at
[1:13:52] homes and at families and
[1:13:54] if it were not for the pandemic we would
[1:13:56] have been at that house tonight
[1:13:59] and it's the bible said it's better to
[1:14:01] be in the house of mourning
[1:14:03] than in the house of laughter in the
[1:14:05] house of mirth
[1:14:06] because it brings a deep level of
[1:14:08] reflection contemplation it really shuts
[1:14:11] you down to what really matters
[1:14:15] to what is really important
[1:14:19] and when i heard it
[1:14:21] i reflected
[1:14:23] and i said look how this pandemic denied
[1:14:25] the fellowship we would have normally
[1:14:27] had and the cadence of what happens when
[1:14:30] you meet
[1:14:31] in church and in a certain rhythm and i
[1:14:33] was saying to brotherhood at the end of
[1:14:35] this whole journey
[1:14:37] you know the the form of the army would
[1:14:39] have changed because we would have lost
[1:14:41] some and gained some
[1:14:43] but i made myself a promise that i want
[1:14:46] to see by the nights again
[1:14:48] and in order to see by the night again
[1:14:51] the word tells us only perfect love
[1:14:52] could get us there
[1:14:54] so somehow the lord has to make a way
[1:14:58] not just has to do it but he will make
[1:15:00] it so i want to encourage you tonight
[1:15:02] as i get ready to close out
[1:15:06] there is a way god has a provided way
[1:15:09] i feel so positive
[1:15:12] to have known a man who found the way
[1:15:16] it was all around him
[1:15:18] it was inside of him
[1:15:20] and as the words of that song said
[1:15:23] trying to do the best i can
[1:15:26] that was his life
[1:15:27] that was his testimony that was his
[1:15:29] declaration and for each of us tonight
[1:15:32] we could leave this meeting when it is
[1:15:34] over with a commitment
[1:15:37] to live the best we can
[1:15:39] and to acknowledge is not just our
[1:15:41] strength but it is the lord
[1:15:43] to make a way somehow
[1:15:45] he will make a way
[1:15:47] for you to connect
[1:15:49] to that provided we
[1:15:51] i encourage you friends
[1:15:53] let the life that brother knights lived
[1:15:55] be an inspiration to us all
[1:15:58] don't turn your back on god
[1:16:01] but a knight stood for something
[1:16:04] he had principles that could not ever be
[1:16:06] compromised
[1:16:07] so i encourage you
[1:16:09] family friend neighbor well wisher
[1:16:12] believer
[1:16:13] the lord will make a way
[1:16:16] somehow
[1:16:17] can we bow our heads a word of prayer
[1:16:20] we want to pray a special prayer for the
[1:16:22] family tonight
[1:16:25] our gracious heavenly father lord we
[1:16:27] have come together as a body of
[1:16:29] believers lord and
[1:16:32] to hear the words from
[1:16:34] all that i've
[1:16:36] spoken and
[1:16:37] shared and
[1:16:38] lord encouraged and
[1:16:40] brought just snippets lord of a life
[1:16:44] well-lived
[1:16:45] lord as but a black man said we sorrow
[1:16:48] but not like the world
[1:16:50] we will miss our brother
[1:16:52] but we know that he's in a better place
[1:16:54] but he's also dependent on us to get
[1:16:56] into a place
[1:16:58] that we could connect to that place and
[1:17:00] lord through your word you have said
[1:17:02] that lord you're gonna make a way
[1:17:05] lord because when we come to the end of
[1:17:07] our strength our efforts our abilities
[1:17:09] it takes you to take us to where we need
[1:17:12] to be
[1:17:13] so we come tonight lord with a burden on
[1:17:16] our hearts
[1:17:17] lord for his wife sister grace
[1:17:20] for all of the children
[1:17:23] for all of the family members
[1:17:26] the grandchildren the cousins the nieces
[1:17:28] the nephews lord is his his his sib lord
[1:17:32] everyone that's connected to him lord
[1:17:34] and even lord as whether george said his
[1:17:37] natural family and his spiritual family
[1:17:39] that you would comfort each one
[1:17:41] lord and he would place into each heart
[1:17:44] lord not just lord of passing comfort
[1:17:47] but the comfort to know
[1:17:49] lord that he lived for you
[1:17:51] and lord and you made a way for him he
[1:17:53] found that way and he walked in that way
[1:17:56] may you bless each one tonight lord who
[1:17:58] made the sacrifice to come to the
[1:18:00] meeting
[1:18:01] lord may you be with the family in a
[1:18:03] special way as they go through what
[1:18:06] needs to be done to prepare for
[1:18:08] lord or the funeral and lord all the
[1:18:12] needful responsibilities that need to be
[1:18:13] put in place even considering this
[1:18:16] pandemic and the various lord situations
[1:18:19] and restrictions and the dynamics of all
[1:18:21] of this so father may you be with them
[1:18:23] and lord be a comfort me a special
[1:18:25] blessing
[1:18:26] lord go upon the family
[1:18:28] knowing how are the nights lived for you
[1:18:30] and sacrificed and dedicated for you may
[1:18:33] you pour out a special blessing upon
[1:18:35] them may you bless everyone in this room
[1:18:38] tonight lord maybe there's someone who
[1:18:41] lost their way can't find their way may
[1:18:44] they leave with the confidence and the
[1:18:46] fate that lord you will make away
[1:18:49] somehow it doesn't matter how far they
[1:18:51] have gone it doesn't matter what has
[1:18:52] gone wrong you are still able to take
[1:18:54] the broken pieces of our lives and put
[1:18:57] it back together again lord we can't
[1:18:59] explain
[1:19:00] lord what your great plan is and how
[1:19:03] this unfolded in this way lord because
[1:19:05] your word teaches us that your thoughts
[1:19:07] are above our thoughts and your ways
[1:19:09] above our ways but we know within your
[1:19:12] divine plan we were all supposed to be
[1:19:15] here tonight because you are a
[1:19:16] deliberate god there's no
[1:19:18] haphazard nature with you there's
[1:19:20] nothing by accident so father may these
[1:19:22] words and every encouragement that will
[1:19:24] resonate in the hearts of your people
[1:19:27] be with each one
[1:19:28] lord and touch each one in the precious
[1:19:31] name of jesus christ as we sing a few
[1:19:33] songs with anthony
