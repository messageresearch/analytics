vineyard thank you so very much and god richly bless you uh this time i would ask that if you are not standing to please let's stand to our feet as we try to go into the scriptures um and try to read from the word of god i'm reading from three parts of scripture said matthew 24 acts 1 and revelation 1. say matthew 24 i read from verse 1 through verse 3. acts 1 i read verses 6 and 7 and revelation chapter 1 i read verses 1-3 say matthew 24 and verses 1-3 read on these wise and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple and jesus said unto them see you not all these things verily i see unto you that shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as you set upon the man of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world like brother branham said there are three questions there and brother brahma explained verses one and two took place on tuesday morning april the 4th 80 30 and that was in the morning the first two verses and because mount the man of olives is a little uh uh uh distance from where they were in the morning he told us that in the evening was when the conversation picked up picked back up again so verse three was in the evening of april the fourth eighty thirty and he said there were three questions here as you can see number one when shall these things be number two what shall be the sign of thy coming and number three what's the sign of the end of the world or when is the end of the world my second scripture acts chapter one verse six and verse seven when the therefore would come together they asked of him saying lord will that at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father had put in his own power very similar you know to the question said matthew 24 because they wanted to know whether he was going to restore the kingdom to israel at this time the kingdom of god on the face of the earth that's what they were looking for in other words the end of the wall and the setting of god's kingdom and he told them it's not for you to know the times or the seasons that's all in the father's hands and he said matthew 24 they wanted to know the time the sign of his coming and he said the time the hour no man knows not even the son only the father knows and revelation 1 verses 1 to 3 reading reads on these wise the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is either readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written may the lord is a blessing to reading of his holy words you may please be seated so for a little title my title uh this morning is the appearing of the lord a sign of his coming the appearing of the lord a sign of his coming now revelation 22 and verse 20 jesus said surely i come quickly that's the last promise in the bible and the very next verse john cried out even so come lord jesus that's the last prayer in the bible now this promise surely i come quickly is like the central theme of the bible the coming of the lord and right from genesis all the way to revelation that's the constant theme of the bible in genesis chapter 3 after adam and eve had seen the fall had taken place and god was you know redesigning the order he spoke in genesis 3 15 about the coming of the seed of the woman which is the coming of the lord and all through the bible we see the coming of lord spoken about but here jesus is coming after he had come the first time he had risen and resurrected he's talking about is coming which is his second coming and he said i come quickly so we find out this coming is going to be a quick walk it's going to be a short quick walk now speaking about the coming of the lord bible readers unlike brother branham taught us he comes three times and also he comes in the name of three sons number one he came to israel as a little babe in the manger that was his first comment second coming he comes to gather his bride of all seven church ages when he comes down for the resurrection the rapture on the going home and number three he comes with his bride in the millennium to reign for a thousand years first time he comes he comes became a son of man second time son of god and in the millennium he'll be the son of david but what concerns us in this uh topic today is the coming of the lord his secret second coming where he said surely i come quickly that's what concerns us here and we message folks no from what brother bannon taught us that we have been in this secret second coming since the seventh seal in the book of redemption brought him back down to earth we have been in this secret second coming it's been going on but how many people know it but thank god we know it the predestination of god has opened our hearts and our understanding to know that we are right now in the coming of the lord now speaking about this coming we are told that there were his first coming was prophesied a lot in the bible but there was more spoken about his second coming most scriptures that pertain and relate to his second coming in the bible than is first coming and these disciples his disciples had known he was talking about going away coming back going away coming back so they wanted to know some more they wanted to some bit of detail and so the conversation we had in luke 24 that we just read was centered around his second coming and they asked him those three questions tell us these things you are saying when are they gonna happen number two tell us the sign of your coming when you're gonna come let's what's the sign number three tell us when the end of the world is gonna be and he didn't answer them specifically like that he just gave them general signs but if you want to watch like brother venom explain he narrowed it all down to the revelation of the seven seals the answer to each of those questions he narrowed it all down to the revelation of the seven seals because the venom completes in matthew 24 with the revelation of the seven seals in in the uh on the sixth seal and let us understand when jesus was answering them he was in other words telling them that the answers to these questions are hidden unveiled in the seven seals and specifically about his second coming when he compared the uh um the seals and revision on matthew 24. his second coming we found out is hitting under the seventh seal and it was veiled with a silence in other words silence a secret is secret of god not only to god alone the secret nature revelation and the secret of god can only be revealed to and by a prophet because amos 3 7 says the lord god will do nothing until and unless he reverses secrets to his servants the prophets so this secret second coming this is veiled under the seventh seal and is uh uh uh a secret that would only be revealed unfolded veil unveiled unfolded by a prophet now in saint matthew 24 if you uh uh if you want to mark it he had verse four and five saint matthew represented the first seal verse six represented second seal verse seven and verse eight the thought still and on down like that and verses nine to 13 represent the fifth seal verses 29 to 31 the sixth seal and verse seven i mean uh the seventh sail verse 32 on down but of that day an hour north no man he failed he's coming underneath the silence amen so after he died and rose again and he came back to disciples in the book of acts when he was going back in the ascension they asked him again in acts chapter one they asked him again will you at this time restore the kingdom back to jerusalem to israel in other words this present system is even when is it going to end and are you now going to restore the kingdom back to jerusalem in other words it was very similar question to what they asked enemy said matthew 24 and jesus simply told them is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has kept in his own hand that's god's secret god alone knows it and he will reveal it when he will reveal it to whomsoever he will but for you go and tarry in the city of jerusalem until you begin deal with power from on high so he covered it up and pushed this coming is a future revelation of the coming of the lord which the father alone knows nobody knows it's not even the son has knows about his own place in it in a very very definite way and so going on down in the scriptures we find revelation chapter one while john was on the isle of patmos for the testimony of jesus christ there came john broke into a vision the lord met him and he gave him the revelation of jesus christ and the bible says like we just read the revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him to tell his servants things which must shortly come to pass and jesus christ sent it through his prophet to his servant john because it's a secret the coming of the lord is a secret and god's secrets are only revealed to and made known to prophets who will speak them to us and that's why he said these things here this revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him the secret that god revealed and gave to the son the son is revealing it now through this series here to on the isle of patmos to john through the prophet to john and so john wrote it all out in symbols and but until that prophet comes on the scene the things are not going to be made really clear we can we can you know group at it and try to make a a sense of all that it is but in terms of real clarity to know what it is to be definite have clarity on the scriptures until that prophet comes on the scene who will take this revelation of jesus christ and revel it to john which is the bride and so remained all down through the church ages until he came to our day and age amen now if you notice revelation 1 the religion of jesus christ which is the entire book of revelation you notice a few things there if you look if you go into revelation you see it's broken up into three distinct paths number one the seven church ages number two the opening of the seals and number three the tribulation period and in the end of the world up the way into the new city so number one the church ages number two the seven seals number three three tribulation all the way into the new city the end of the world so this was the in symbol form the answers to the questions that were asked by the disciples of jesus in samadhi 24 in acts chapter 1 they wanted to know when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming what shall be the time or the end of the war and the sign of it and so when jesus the father gave the revelation of the coming of the lord to the son he gave the revelation to john through a prophet waiting for the time when that will be really made real on the face of the earth waiting for that prophet to step to come on the scene for it to be unveiled to john the bride and so we understand through there that the revelation of jesus christ has been waiting for that prophet to come on the sin amen so uh um um in our day and age okay down through they they ignored at a trying to grasp at it like to to try to understand what is all about there because the secret is the secret that god gave to jesus christ to give to his prophet to give to john the living element of the bride and so that i remain until the end time here when jesus himself came down and sat at the end of the church ages and sat at the top of the at the head of the christian church to unveil these things to a prophet on the face of the earth at the time the prophet william branham the prophet elijah the great elijah prophet of malachi 4 for the time was not at hand the time was not at any time to come for these things the revelation of jesus christ to be unfolded of the seven church ages of the seven seals and the rapture and the going home and the end of the world the time had come for this truth to be unveiled to anoint our understanding with these things what the disciples of all were longing to look into but they could not because the time wasn't at hand here like revelation 1 says for the time is at hand and here we are jesus christ come down and set himself at the head of the christian church and begin to give this revelation out to his prophet who gave it to john hallelujah so the prophet malachi 4 william branham raised up and jesus christ unveiled revelation after revelation after revelation to him answering these questions when shall these things be what's the sign of the coming of the lord and what's the all about the end of the world and malachi 4 he unveiled the revelation to the bride oh how blessed and how privileged we are to know these things because the prophet preached on the seven seals and he preached on the seven church ages to explain all about when these things took place and what still to take place to explain how the seven church ages is part and parcel of the coming of the lord because when the disciples as when are you coming they had no idea there were seven church ages still coming on they had no idea there were those of their brothers and sisters who were not yet you know manifested on the face of the earth and they had to wait for them for them to even understand at all about the coming of the lord because the lord was going to come to gather all literature not just they at that time alone those happens alone but every one of his children all the way back to adam to take them back with him so the prophet preached the seven church ages unveiled all about the seven church ages and taught us how the seven church ages is totally sync with the coming of the lord because out of the seven churches a bride out of each age is gonna form that bride that's gonna go in the rapture in the skies whether as living saints or sleeping saints but they're gonna be spread around through the edges so he preached on the church ages and he preached also on the coming of the lord the seven seals which is the book of the revelation of jesus christ and in there he unveiled the secret the revelation of the mystery of the coming of the lord and then in there he also preached the thought part of the question they asked jesus christ about the end of the world and all the things that's going to be in the end of the world right down into the time that the kingdom of god is going to be set up on the face of this earth what those disciples were asking jesus in the book of acts and also in matthew so malachi 4 william branham with this ministry took the revelation of jesus christ on the three parts of that revelation seven church ages seven seals the revelation of the end of the world what it's gonna be like how he's gonna come malachi for the prophet william branham he unveiled and reveal all of those things to this living element of the bride oh hallelujah so william branham he preached the revelation of jesus christ like i said already the revelation of jesus christ the book of revelation you can class it in three distinct portions seven church ages revelation two and three then you have the seven seals tied up with the rapture in revelation 4 5 6 7 8 and then you have um the tribulation period and the judgments and the new jerusalem and the water in judgment and all of that the end of the world you have those three distinct groups there but if you look in the book of revelation it's not it's not like uh uh the the the chapters are not you know uh line up in order you know step by step like after this will be this it's here a little very little so if you notice seven church ages at the end of it revelation two and three the seven church ages revelation four chapter one the black goes in the rapture come up either i will show you come up either so that's the rapture and then chapter five we see you know heaven and then chapter six the seals are revealed and all that so the question comes how come the bride is going to the rapture and then all these things are still on the face of the earth how come the sales are revealed after the price gone the rapture how come revelation 10 you know elijah's mystery is there when the bride is going to rapture how come revelation 10 and john is prophesying again after i supposed to go in the rapture here's the secret here here's the revelation here because it's not written you know scripture by scripture line after line no it's it's there here a little there is and the revelation is this here revelation 3 verses 14 through 22 that's the seven churches that's the messenger of louisiana that's william branham's ministry that's it right there unto the angel of church the ladies here right and that's his mission right there and here's the revelation there you go in revelation and take every scripture every promise that this messenger was supposed to reveal you put it right under revelation 3 14-22 in other words you put under there revelation 5. you put on there there revision six seven and eight you put under there revelation uh uh uh attend you put under there first thessalonians 4 16 you put under the everything that has to do with the coming of the lord you put it right there and when you do that all you'll have left from revelation 4 to 19 are the things that are going to happen interpretation period you have chapter 11 chapter 12 chapter 13 all the way down there when you by by revelation put all of the scriptures that have to do with this messenger's ministry into revelation 3 14 to 22 all you have left is everything that's going to take place in the tribulation period because the bride goes in the rapture revelation 4 and verse 1 and then the tribulation period and the end of the war takes place glory to god so malachi 4 he taught us this he showed us the scriptures he unveiled the coming of the lord he unveiled and showed us the the the connection between the seven church ages and the coming of the lord they're not it is jonathan because there will be no coming of allah if there were no seven churches because through the seven churches god's spirit walking through the church ages the son of god god sevenfold spirit being spread out through the church ages right until this age and malacca for came and together brought all those spirits together the seven manifestations of god's holy spirit in this age here to unveil and reveal these things so the seven churches apparent parcel of it because they're without us cannot be made perfect and malaca had to come to reveal the things that were left off so that they also can be part of this rapture in the skies because they're gone but they have to go in the rapture in the skies and unless malakai with this world the mystery of the or the revelation of the mystery of the coming of the lord there is no way they are going to be there so malachi 4 revealed this revelation and here we are in the coming of the lord that's the theme of the whole bible and that's the theme of that prophet's message he was sent with the message to get a bride together to prepare a bride for the coming of the lord and that's the most important thing you can do friends to be prepared for the coming of the most important thing you can do minister brother to prepare your people for the coming of the lord nothing else even comes close in terms of importance to be prepared for the coming of the lord in letting us understand from the preaching of the seals and his message he let us understand the coming of the lord is in the threefold manner the lord himself shall stand from heaven from first corinthians 14 i'm in first corinthians 4 i'm sorry the lord himself shall stand from heaven with a shout with a voice of the archangel with a trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first and let us see that the coming of the lord is a shout a voice and a trump and he also said this coming of the lord shared voice trump has an appearing path and a calming path and let us understand the common path is the trump of god that's what the bible says that's what he taught us that's what bible readers know the coming of the lord is the trumpet of the lord shall sound and time shall be no more that's the coming of the lord but before the coming there's a shout there's the voice of the archangel so those represent the appearing part now let me read you a quote from brother branham here um on on that um excuse me all right uh um excuse me um all right on anytime evangelism brother branham said here 62 same thing today same thing today when you see his work now we have already seen and are witnessing the appearing of the lord now remember appearing and coming is two different words to appear and then to come when i'm coming to your house and i appear in the distance i haven't come yet but i appear and i'm walking towards your house and that's what he's saying here appearing and coming is two different words to appear and then to come now is the appearance listen close now is the appearing he's already appeared in these last days right here with us in the last few years now this appearing it's a sign of his coming and that's where i got my title from the appearing of the lord a sign of his coming now it's a sign of his coming this appearing of the lord is a sign of his coming do you understand what we're saying here they were asking jesus tell us what is the sign of your coming when shall these things be those things were things that were going to be explained by the events in the seven church ages and malachi 4 jesus fell in him began to unveil the answers to these questions when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and here is malacca for here letting us know the sign of his coming the appearing is a sign of his coming and he went back he is appearing in his church in the form of the holy spirit showing that it's him because people cannot do these things that you see the holy spirit doing so that's the appearing of the lord now remember it spoke both places appearing and coming this coming of the lord has an appearing path as a common path the coming path is the trump of god every bible reader knows that so malakai he's been appearing with us in these last few years he's appearing in his church in other words the shout the voice that's the appearing part of the coming of the lord hallelujah and he said jesus he does all three jesus does the shout he does the voice he draws the trumpet he does the trump of god and in there he's appearing before he comes at the trump of god so he's been appearing with us all these years malacca for said in the church because all these things that you see doing been done man cannot do it it's going to take the holy spirit himself doing these works here in the appearing of the lord a sign of his coming that's that's what that's what the bible says the things that those saints have all long to look into have been given to us right now they long to look at what they long for to see angels long to look at these things and here we have it right revealed and given to us so here we are in the appearing of the lord in the coming of the lord appearing a sign of his coming in other words is it yes yes he has appeared he has appeared is not in some you know mythical space somewhere he's up here we see him coming we see him coming before he comes come the trump of god too late for anything to happen in terms of repentance and all that when he comes so the appearing he appears in the shout in the voice hallelujah so malachi 4 william branham was sent here by god to do the appearing of the lord the voice of the archangel that do the appearing of the lord how so that you take notice this is jesus coming this is jesus christ and that prophet of malachi 4 he had a ministry that totally identified totally reflected and identified that the lord is coming the lord appeared in his ministry by diverse signs and wonders and miracles and we had to take note that this was jesus appearing and doing his wonders among us and while the prophet did the appearing of the lord he gave her the message a message of the seven seals and the seven funders to call out and prepare a bride for the coming of the lord he's coming that's in the trump but before the time he appears to call out a bride and prepare her for the coming of the lord so that when the lord comes there'll be a bride ready to meet him surely i come quickly even so come lord jesus but he sends a prophet for us in the appearing part of the coming of the lord to prepare a bride call out and prepare your bride for the coming of the lord so that when the lord comes there's a bride ready when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth yes lord because the prophet has come with a message of the seven seals and the seven thunderers to call out a bride and put the word of god in her amen to prepare her for the coming of the lord and here we are a portion of that group now revelation 10 speaks about the coming of the lord in revelation 10 7 the prophet was there in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when it shall begin a sound the mystery of god should be finished and they there you have it malacca for his ministry to unveil every mystery the greater mysteries the lesser mysteries unveil them and the mysteries of the seven churches the mystery of the son of god in the seven churches unveil and reveal them to you and i the mystery of the coming of the lord unveiled them to you and i and after he finished his ministry after i finished the ministry he was gone he was gone and then revelation 10 8 the lord is still standing because he said jesus does all three of them you know the quote in the rapture jesus three things must happen before the lord himself comes shout voice trump shout a message together people together voice a voice of the resurrection to wake up the sleeping dead and the trump of god the trump always a trumpet called israel to the fist a trumpet to call the bride to the lamb supper in the skies those three things must take place for the lord to come and so malachi 4 gave her the short message left on books and tips and he was gone and then the lord himself is still there jesus does all three simply means jesus doesn't shout does the voice does it trump and the shout will change to the voice the voice will change the trump because jesus is one single person he just changed the times and the seasons and he moves from the shout to the voice to the trump i left a revolution for us in there hallelujah so after the prophet is gone here is uh uh the bride january the prophet went december 1965 january 1966 we walked into the shout the sharpness the shot of the king is in the camp we're walking to the shout because he had faithfully given out the short message which was all of these revelations contained in the revelation of jesus christ all the mysteries lit ladies in the seven church ages and the seven seals and the mysteries concerning the end of the world unveil them to us what the disciples wanted to know we have been privileged to have them unveil to us right straight from the man of god to jesus christ to the prophet to john the bride on january 96 the bride walked into the shout out message and god began to call out a five-fold ministry from around the world not one certain man around the world god began to call them out many of us weren't even born then what would have happened if he came when the disciples were asking him no he couldn't do it because he had to wait for because we were predestinated on the lamb's book of life and had to wait until the end here to where the prophet can put it all together go into the man of god and title together for us the revelation of jesus christ to let us see what has been going on what is what was and what is to come things which must shortly come to pass things that are to be and so here we are a ministry began to call out the bread began to take that prophet's message the shackles began to preach it recycled it back immediately began to enter into malacca for his labors his tears his labors the word that he preached nothing added nothing taken away from it rapturing grace faith less on the tapes give it exactly like he said it and and pushing that word out began to look for the bride and the bra began to come who were not even born when malachi 4 was here a ministry after the prophet began to around the world began to go out with the prophet's message faithful men who have been taught who know the importance of saying only what the messenger said because that's the man of god that's the revelation of jesus christ and in doing that and saying that they are preaching and finding that bride going into that brat with a shout message of malachi 4 and in doing that putting jesus christ the revealed word from malachi first message into that bride into that bride and as that what goes in that bride is jesus christ coming in is the coming of the lord come in of the lord jesus christ going into that breath coming into that bride as this men faithfully taught swept across the world god began to call his ministry here and there and they take that prophet's message to go search out for the bride to go search for the bride from denominations wine or prostitution drunken bars wherever you were if you were predestinated that what found you somewhere and here you are today a ministry took that what and somebody might have given you a book booklet or whatever but god was searching for you and here you are today and without warning you that was jesus christ coming into you with his word let me read you a quote here brother branham said um excuse me on god's provided please worship then notice not only does he come in by the holy spirit with the learning of his word he manifests that word malacath was gone the appearing part he's gone here we are because he's gone with a shout here we are the appearing part because until the trump of god comes we're still in the appearing part and here we are malachi for sure is the example how the appearing is is a mystery in mechanics and dynamics together the fullness of the world with the fullness of a spirit on it a manifestation an explosion that would literally be the life and mystery of jesus christ in human flesh on the face of the earth each man in his ministry each man is placed demonstrating and revealing the appearing of the lord before their generation hallelujah so he said here notice these men coming in to you and teaching you setting you in church you come in the message you send the church for tutoring for child training for behavior for character formation amen to take the word of god to correct yourself to to to to reset the purpose of the mysteries to take the word and correct ourselves and and and correct ourselves for behavior for character for maturity that jesus christ coming in is the come in of the lord coming into you with this fullness of the word from malachi 4 and if he comes in with what you are learning jesus christ jesus cried out say matthew 11 28 come and land of me for a make and lull in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls so he comes in first by the learning of his word and malachi 4 told us here he not only comes in with the laying of his word he manifests that word so every single promise every single uh uh promise that has been preached into you from elijah's message must be manifested and that will also be the appearing of the lord so we got a job we got a job to do and we are doing the job so it's not just to believe the world there's the promise of dynamics that's gonna fire up the what on the inside of us that we are receiving from elijah's message and that's going to be a manifestation of this world and the spirit together the mechanics and dynamics together and that will be a manifestation of the life of jesus christ and we have that ministry coming that's going to be exactly like the life of jesus christ oh glory to god amen amen amen amen oh my and one by one the dynamics is going to fall upon this bride one by one right now the ministry going with the world and and calling out a bride going with the world and nurturing tutoring feeding your souls on the word of the living god and that's how jesus comes in you are facing on the world go to the angel you recognize the angel is still on the other jesus christ he was veiled in malachi 4 that's jesus christ using man to call you out and go to the india you're not going to man you are going to jesus christ with the world from malacca for not any man's works not tainted not added anything to it anything from but the what pure was america for and you take that word and eat it and as you eat that world is coming in with the learning of his world but when he comes in learning of his world that's not all he has got to manifest that was that's going to be a manifestation so that it will be mechanics and dynamics together and mechanics and director will be word plus spirit and that will be the total complete reflection of jesus christ and that will be appearing the lord appearing in you he appeared in malacca for he's appearing in his bride a sign of his coming hallelujah glory to god amen and many many men and one by one the dynamics will strike and one by one jesus christ in the bride with his word in the bride which is his voice in the bride because the prophet said the voice of god will be in her and she will be anointed by the holy spirit the word of god the voiced word of god in her soul will be anointed and out of that world will block will explode every promise that world will expand and explode back in the spirit and you are going to see sons of god in manifestation the appearing of the lord god jesus christ appearing in his sons and daughters a sign of his coming they appearing a sign of his coming so one of those disciples asked jesus in matthew 24 they were longing to look at this day to be under this promise that the appearing of the lord will be the sign of his covenant was a sign a sign a ministry a people with jesus christ veil right on the inside of them is what fooling them the word anointed by the dynamics the holy spirit and that what will be and not into their flesh they become the word made flesh demons will scream in their presence all around them there will be the glory of god demons screaming that presence glory and you'll see jesus christ again in his people in his church in his bride the appearing of the lord before he comes and one by one god's sons and daughters will come to this manifestation which is adoption time and jesus christ will be in them and add three more words to them hear ye him the water god in them becomes the voice of god on their lips to speak three more words let me read you a quote here from brother branham about this process the word of god coming into the bride from the lorries and church age the grammarized book a momentary conservation of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word are you hearing me the lutheran spoke for god at that time saint luther was what ruler preached the word the word came into them they spoke for god the water got in their souls became the voice of god on their lips the literal spoke for god at the time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends toward dogma and crete and not simple word they could no longer speak for god because they injected their own thoughts and their ideas organization and that word that they received had become tempted so their voice could no longer be the voice of god they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the lord in his day so when you have the word for your day you become the force of god when the dynamic strikes you and it's pure world comes out pure voice of god and in this edge here dynamic extracts the fullness of the water that we are received from elijah the fullness of the spirit which is dynamic strikes it and it comes out of our mouth the voice of god three more words here ye him then god sent wesley and he was the voice of the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles ran and mourned of all men for their generation they became the world made flesh and when they spoke it was the word speaking when the method is filled god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under the messenger that's us on the malacca four because he had preached this world and it it was faithful pricked the world and and a father mission ordained of god around the world took the same words from the prophet and circled it recycle it back to you and i to call us out to to teach us in church to to to correct us to train us to rebuke us to to just dress us in the wedding comment of the lord jesus christ is pure and adulterated world the fullness of the world through seven church ages and then until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age because the word of god you receive when the anointing strikes you the dynamics for your day and age strikes you that what in your soul becomes the voice of god on your lips yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god so the word you receive it and then you speak it you are the mappings of god but because the church are so backsliding and you and i know that the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is it's all it's it's it's it is its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her in other words god is against her he will confront her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in the bride through the prophet malachi 4 and the bride he has confronted them to the prophet malaca for nice bright time to confound the people through the bride because just like he was a son of the coming of the lord so he's this bride a son of the coming of lord how by a mystery that's just exactly like the life of jesus christ in mechanics and dynamics together the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her the what a god in her soul anointed by the spirit becomes the voice of god on her lips to do spock in what power the the the the the what and the spirit going for together a spoken word power the fullness of the anointing and authority in the church of the living god that's our promise that's our promise now we pray for the sick but then we are going to speak the word and command the demons we are not going to pray for this we are going to speak the word and command the demons because he is going to give you three more words hear him your voice becomes the voice of god yes sir the church is no longer the mouth of god the my peace of god is his own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will confront her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her yes it is for his sick excuse me yes it is the voice of god is in her yes it is for he says in the last chapter of revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come the spirit will anoint the bride the ward in her soul and out of her lips will come the voice of god so the voice of god is in the bride amen the word of god in the bread is the voice of god yes once more the wall will hear direct from god as at pentecost but of course that what bro will be reputated as in the first age oh god still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride these voices in the bride it come from elijah's world because jesus does all three the water god in your soul is the voice of god in your soul and it's the appearing part of the coming of the lord that voice is in the bride as we have said i will talk more about that later and we are talking more about that today thank you jesus and when the last name on the book last name previous name in this edge here as you said the dynamics to our mechanics then the voice of god in the bride jesus will be in that bride speaking his words and then it will come right back to like it was in saint john 11 again when lazarus died and jesus was told him your friend lazarus is dead i didn't go four days passed before he went there but while he was going his apples were saying he said our friend lazarus sleeps let us go and wake him up that's the voice of god to wake up and he went down his disciples with his disciples he wanted to wake him up and in this day and age here jesus will be in these disciples this end time bride anointed adopted the what may flesh jesus in this bride will speak the word and up will come lazarus again from the grave up they'll come from the grave all the saints of old the voice of god in the bride a voice of the resurrection to wake up the sleeping saints the same way jesus the second adam the first adam was to call them from the ground from the from the dust of the earth but before he got to his ministry he fell by sin but this second adam jesus christ did not fail and he in his bride or this end time here will be there to speak his voice a voice of the resurrection to raise up the dead in christ from the graves and that's gonna be how is it gonna be the power of god striking the glories of god striking the bride wave after wave after wave after wave of the power of god will sweep over your soul and up from the grave they'll come that power will be so great the graves will not be able to stay closed up they'll come from there like brother branham said when jesus was at the grave of lazarus if he not called lazarus all the graves would have opened but right now that voice will call out and up they'll come a voice of the resurrection oh hallelujah the voice in the living bride wakes up the sleeping dead bride by his voice a voice of the resurrection how wave after wave after wave after wave of the glories of god till the graves cannot stay closed and up they will come what the first adam failed to do the second adam filled in his bride by the fullness of the spirit upon the fullness of the world will achieve that and call them up from the dust of the ground hallelujah and for 30 40 days there will be convention on the side of the hill while we wait for the going home in the skies there'll be a convention a camp meeting for 30 40 days of resurrecting saints sleeping sins rejected sleeping sins and leaving saints on the face of the earth and when you see the sleeping sins in church oh these brothers gonna you just see him that brother's gone you just see him and brother brahm said god wants us to have that so when we get there won't be wondering did papa make it the mama make it did this person make it that person make it so gives us a chance for about 30 40 days they come meeting on this side here and they appear you'll be in church and leaving since resurrected sins will appear in the assembly what is it is a sign another sign that the rapture is at hand the lord has come to wake up his children and it's a sign that the rapture is at hand on the message going beyond the camp uh brother branham said here um all of us know brother bill dao is sitting here in the corner i oh how thankful we are for all of god's great blessings this is going beyond the camp 60 64 07 719 i know how thankful we are for all of god's great blessings may continue to be with us until the last trumpet blows and you know will be caught up together to meet the lord in the air think of it missing people they can't see you no more but you are getting together with the rest of the group there which are alive and remain to the coming of the lord shall not prevent or hinder uh uh the word is those which are asleep the word is those which are asleep not dead no christians don't die they're just taking a little rest see that's all oh my and the trump of gosh your sound and the dead in christ shall rise first appeared to many and all at once you have understand and look and well there's a brother and you know it ain't long then when you slept with that i made it that was talking about you know it ain't wrong no you're not dead you're alive but eternity is breaking into time to give you a sign that the rapture is at hand you know i'm reading in a few minutes you know will be king in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and together with them will be missing on earth caught up to me the lord in the air oh hallelujah [Music] amen now jesus he does all three the shout becoming the voice the voice becoming the trump the voice becomes the trump a voice of the resurrection because the bible says at the last trump the dead in christ shall rise and but brother braham said the voice of the archangel raised up the dead in christ so you know right away there's a revelation there oh but the boundary found saying something different from the bible that the voice of the archangel raised up the dead and the bible says the trump of god amber by himself quoted that but many times the trump of god that's when the dead in christ will rise up so you know right away there's a revelation there how they how the trump and the voice and the shout how they are you know connected together because jesus he does all three the shout becomes the voice the voice becomes the trump and when the last name on the book is adopted the voice of god in heaven the word of god jesus veils in her like a one with his apples to the grave of lazarus he goes with his disciples to every grave around the world where his seed his sons and daughters all the way back to adam ah and the voice of god jesus christ in them by his voice this trumpeting voice a voice of the resurrection will wake up the dead in christ and for about 30 40 days there'll be a rendezvous on this side here before we go in the rapture in the skies now we're moving to malaca explaining when when shall these things be and on the sign of thy coming we have seen the sign the appearing a sign of his coming we have seen the sign of the resurrected saints is saying that the rapture is at hand now says shout voice trump now let me read you this here from broken systems 6407 26 praying that god will richly bless each of you program 158 that is grace and mercy will be with you through the coming week and if anything should happen that one of you may sleep beyond the veil now just remember there's only a few hours of sleep and rest until we meet remember that they which are alive and remain shall not hinder those which are sleeping for the trumpet of god shall sound thus first thessalonians 4 16 that last trumpet thus first corinthians 15 51 and 52 and then he ties it to the seventh trumpet that last trumpet for the sixth one has just sounded hitland-ikeman in other words he's talking about the trump of god he's talking about the last trumpet he's talking about the seventh trumpet all the trump same thing but they have different portions of what they are going to do malacca revealed these things to bring us on into the rapture and and and to the end of the world to bring on the tribulation period so and the sixth one i just sounded and that last trumpet like the last seal will be the coming of the lord it shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise first just resting till that time in other words this trump of god is the same as the last trumpet is same as the seventh trumpet malacca for let us understand what each portion of that trumpet will do same trumpet but directed to do different things the trump of god that's when a voice of the resurrection works of the dead in christ and they're still here they're still here for 30 40 days and then the trumpet sounds we're going to rupture in the skies that's the last trump for the last trump we shall be changed in a moment in a twin of an eye we're going the rapture in the skies and then the seventh trumpet will be moist and elijah jesus christ coming to morris and elijah the gospel passing from the gentiles back to the jews just the reverse of where the gospel passed from the jews to the gentiles in the house of cornelius same way the gospel same message seven seals seven thunders the revelation of jesus christ passing to the jews through the prophets moses and elijah they have the trumpet same trumpet but doing a different work same trumpet race of the dead same trumpet take the the the the bride into the skies in the rapture same trumpet museum elijah to call the jews to the recognition of the atonement they want forty four thousand jews to call them to the drug at men in the tribulation period and the same trumpet to cross a field called the bloods of the air to a feast on the face of the earth while the bride this same trumpet takes the bride into the wedding supper in the skies this same trumpet calls for a feast on the phrase that they have ungodly men who turn down the grace of god in the tribulation period oh glory to god amen and more is an elijah by the trumpet the seventh trumpet will bring judgments upon this world here and that's gonna be the great tribulation and in there the same trumpet will call the 144 000 jews to the recognition of the atonement the same trumpet will call the birth of the air to fish on the bodies the carcasses of dead men who are going to be dead in the tribulation period for rejecting the grace of god in their day and age and and the the the the the trumpet will bring on the tribulation prayer and the tribulation prayer signals the beginning of the end of the world just what the disciples were asking jesus when shall be the end of the world and malachi 4 revealed these things from the book of the revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him and which is sent to his servant is centered the signature of jesus was on that prophet you took noise this was god jesus christ veil in human skin he wasn't jesus christ he wasn't god don't catch my words but this was god veiled in human skin just like god's going to be veiled in your human skin that was god veil in that prophet mechanics and dynamics together the appearing of the lord a sign of his coming and he's veiling in you by his word his voice words a sign of his coming and when you are adopted it will be the dynamics upon the world in your soul will become three more what's on your lips hear ye him and that is gonna be the same jesus in you speaking out through you are going to be the voice a voice of the resurrection to wake up the dead in christ just like he woke up lazarus that trumpeting voice of christ brother bram said oh god help me to hear that that day that trumpeting voice of christ to wake up the sleeping bride to wake up the sleeping dead thank god the voice woke us up said matthew 25 woke up the sleeping bride while the bridegroom terry they all slumbered and slept and that voice as walking off the sleeping bride and that same voice invoicing you through you will wake up the sleeping dead oh my and moise elijah will usher in the beginning of the end of the world because after the tribulation period will come the battle of armageddon after the balamagon will come the millennium and after that will come the battle of golden magog and after that will come the great white throne judgment and after there will come the fire to bond the all heavens and the earth away and there will be a new heavens and a new earth the heavenly jerusalem the new holy city new jerusalem the kingdom of god is with men when shall you say will you at this time restore the kingdom to jerusalem here is the answer right here reveal unveiled by the prophet of malacca for step by step how is going to come this is the kingdom that disciples were asking jesus about him said matthew 24 in acts 1 hallelujah a malaca 4 by the revelation of jesus christ by his message of the seven seals and the seven thunders has opened up this to us and answered the questions when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and the and of the end of the world and we see the sign the appearing a sign of the coming of the lord oh hallelujah so the angel of god revealing the prophet malaca for i shown the bride he severance the things which must shortly be done according to revelation 1 and verse 1. and here we are friends here we are the word of god is in us every promise this prophet gave us is in us but it's not enough he said the mechanics with that dynamic is no good and the dynamics are the mechanics no good luther had the mechanics and dynamics for his day wesley had the mechanics dynamics what about our day this church should be fully grown up now with the power of the living god the dynamics upon our mechanics firing her up to go meet christ in the resurrection in the skies oh hallelujah it will be the manifestation of the sons of god another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age this bride will have thus saith the lord hear him or keep still the power of god will sweep over you we're here friends we're here we're here and so we know what we have so we pray for the sick we cast our devils we command the demons but we are looking for a promise our promises we are not going to lay hands we are going to speak and the sick are going to be healed we are going to speak and souls are going to run into the kingdom we are going to speak and demons are going to scream out for their life that's where we are friends so i see our eyes shine for that light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee amen and the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the glory of the horizon one final quote here and i'm done adoption tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of god was ever to be manifested outside of this time now when was there ever a time in the history there was to manifest the time to deliver all nature nature the nature itself is growing in waiting for the time of the manifestation it only comes in by the learning of is what he manifests the world and the spirit is here to manifest why before the atonement was made before the holy ghost was ever poured out before all the all all the old testament on down there there couldn't have been manifestations it had to wait till this time revelation 1 1 had to wait till this time for the time is at hand now until malachi 4 came on the scene the book could not be opened you got to take a prophet to unveil the secrets the mystery of the coming of the lord and all these things the questions they were asking jesus the other witch of this time now all things has been brought all the mysteries have been opened all these things when are they going to take place has been brought here we see it all now and lord coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestations of sons of god coming back oh hallelujah sons of god coming back a manifestation by the spirit the dynamics upon your mechanics like they had on the deal pentecost not your little baptism that's good but they're revealing the dynamics of the holy ghost that's going to anoint and quicken the word into your flesh you will become literally the word made flesh oh my all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestations of sons of god coming back and the spirit of god the dynamics coming into these men so perfectly till their ministry will be so close like christ till we join him and his church together we've got a ministry coming that's just exactly like the life of jesus christ what does that mean she identified the coming of the lord one final quote and i'm done oh glory to god amen glory to god amen oh my all right adoption part four now notice then the coming of the lord jesus that's the sign of thy coming the coming of roger is so close at hand until the spirit from way down here in here just barely justification just barely some christian baptism of the holy spirit and now right into the time of the coming of the headstone and jesus came and sat as the headstone at the top of the church at the head of the church and gave all these revelations out through malachi 4 with him not just a religion but by manifestation so we must have a manifestation every day amen oh gloria we are looking for the manifestation of the dynamics to our mechanics oh brother the church are now right on to the spirit from way down in here just barely justification sanctification person of the holy spirit and now right into the time of the coming of the headstone that's jesus christ coming back the church has got to be so perfectly like christ until christ and the church can unite together the same spirit till you use your voice to speak and call out the dead call out the dead in sin color the dead from the graves and if the spirit of christ is in you it makes you live the life of christ act the life of christ do the works of christ that's the dynamics makes you a life of christ makes you live the life of christ makes you do the work of god christ will be veiled on the inside of you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also jesus said that see now we are going to have we got a ministry coming that's just exactly like the life of jesus christ what does that mean she identify the coming of the lord and that will be christ appearing in you as you are perry malacca for in your own position in the body of jesus christ in your own place in the body appearing in you a sign of his coming the mystery of christ veiled in his bride what does that mean identify the coming of the lord god richly bless you [Music] so [Music] [Music] surrender [Music] jesus is [Applause] [Music] one more time [Music] i surrendered [Music] [Applause] speak to him as a
