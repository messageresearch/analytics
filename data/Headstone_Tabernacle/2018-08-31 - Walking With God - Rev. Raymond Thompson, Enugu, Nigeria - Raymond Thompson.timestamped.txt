[10:47] expectation once again I believe that we
[10:53] have all enjoyed the services that the
[10:56] Lord has given us today I believe that
[10:59] the atmosphere and join here is due to
[11:03] the fact that like the prophets say that
[11:05] the preaching of the word will always
[11:09] bring down the holy spirit is that what
[11:11] you have felt in here rainy morning
[11:15] service and afternoon services so we
[11:18] thank God for
[11:21] forgiving my servants I mean the option
[11:26] of the Holy Spirit to be able to preach
[11:28] the word does exactly what it professor
[11:30] if you if the minister is dedicated and
[11:34] consecrated to the preaching of the word
[11:36] the owner the trader Word of the Living
[11:38] God then bound to have the atmosphere of
[11:42] the Holy Spirit where I mean the right
[11:45] atmosphere where children can be born
[11:47] into the kingdom of God and reformed
[11:49] into the world image of Jesus Christ to
[11:52] reflect of an image of the Son of God I

[1:01:31] standing I normally read from the Old
[1:01:35] Testament to the new but I'm gonna start
[1:01:37] from the new ending up to the old so
[1:01:40] we're gonna read first John 1 second
[1:01:44] Corinthians 6 and Micah verse 6 so if
[1:01:48] you have your Bibles we're gonna read
[1:01:51] first John
[1:02:21] first John one I'm great verse three to
[1:02:27] seven that which we have seen in Earth
[1:02:34] declare we unto you that he also may
[1:02:37] have fellowship with us and through our
[1:02:40] fellowship is with the father there's a
[1:02:42] little feedback someone is what the
[1:02:45] father and with his son Jesus Christ and
[1:02:48] these things right we unto you that your
[1:02:51] joy may be full
[1:02:52] verse then is the message which we have
[1:02:54] heard of him and declare unto you that
[1:02:57] God is light and in him is no darkness
[1:03:00] at all if we say that we have fellowship
[1:03:03] with him and walk in darkness we lie and
[1:03:06] do not the truth but if we walk in the
[1:03:10] light as he is in the light we have
[1:03:13] fellowship one with another and the
[1:03:15] blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses
[1:03:18] us from all sin isn't that beautiful
[1:03:21] didn't we have some wonderful fellowship
[1:03:23] this weekend my water place meets beam
[1:03:27] and then we turned to second Corinthians
[1:03:37] from verse 66 verse 16 and what
[1:03:42] agreement has the temple of God with
[1:03:43] idols for ye are the Temple of the
[1:03:46] Living God as God has said I will dwell
[1:03:49] in them and walk in them so I'm
[1:03:53] emphasizing that walk in them and I will
[1:03:56] be their God and they shall be my people
[1:03:58] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:04:01] be separate saith the LORD touch not the
[1:04:03] unclean thing and I will receive you and
[1:04:06] and will be a father unto you and ye
[1:04:09] shall be my sons and daughters saith the
[1:04:13] Lord God Almighty and then Micah
[1:04:21] chapter six and we read from verse seven
[1:04:24] and eight with the Lord we please were
[1:04:27] thousands of rams over ten thousands of
[1:04:31] rivers of oil shall I give my firstborn
[1:04:35] for my transgression the fruit of my
[1:04:38] body for the son of my soul yes show
[1:04:43] thee O man what is good and what does
[1:04:48] the Lord require of thee watch what he
[1:04:52] requires but just to do justly to love
[1:04:57] mercy and to walk humbly with thy God
[1:05:02] make order placing the word you may be
[1:05:05] seated
[1:05:26] so tonight I want the enemy to know it's
[1:05:32] a prey line but I want him to know
[1:05:34] brother brems is the weakest Christian
[1:05:36] the weakest we're not even speaking of
[1:05:39] the eros yet but the weakest Christian
[1:05:42] can defeat Satan anyway
[1:05:46] anytime and under any circumstances so
[1:05:51] tonight I know he's in trouble brother
[1:05:53] because the weakest Christian is going
[1:05:56] to drive him out tonight
[1:05:57] hallelujah so tonight I like to take a
[1:06:00] title walking with God amen and I'd like
[1:06:06] to take a subject fellowship that was
[1:06:09] broken but fellowship restored and I got
[1:06:14] inspiration restored to an Eden
[1:06:17] condition so tonight I don't know this
[1:06:23] is such a well although 2 hours 7 but I
[1:06:28] hope I can speak like you and everything
[1:06:30] so you will have to watch with the
[1:06:32] perspiration when it yields 2 hours he
[1:06:34] said ok so he says here now we we got
[1:06:40] you got to travel with me and we go to
[1:06:42] the Garden of Eden and we looking from
[1:06:44] the outside in and we see this beautiful
[1:06:46] picture and then I can hear he speaking
[1:06:49] our God of Adam telling Eve and then I
[1:06:53] can hear him say dear do you see the Sun
[1:06:55] is setting it's time that we talk to the
[1:06:58] father so they went up to the Cathedral
[1:07:02] a great tree as they knelt down all of a
[1:07:06] sudden a heavenly growing light came
[1:07:09] down the logos the holy spirit that had
[1:07:12] proved them out of the earth came down
[1:07:15] father God
[1:07:17] and he said children have you enjoyed
[1:07:19] yourself today
[1:07:21] sure my so fathers having fellowship
[1:07:27] with his son with his children and then
[1:07:30] Adam says yes father and then he says
[1:07:34] I've come down to kiss you good night
[1:07:37] and to lay you down to to rest tonight
[1:07:40] so he kissed him on the cheeks laid him
[1:07:43] down nothing good on them he was right
[1:07:46] in the bushes with him the lion and he
[1:07:49] laid the lion down and he laid the chips
[1:07:51] are down and the tiger down and laid
[1:07:54] them all down to rest and father was so
[1:07:57] pleased so you can mention while they
[1:08:02] lain their fathers walking around them
[1:08:04] and he's looking in his oh my so
[1:08:06] beautiful
[1:08:07] he's so pleased and he's so happy and
[1:08:11] we're looking at this beautiful picture
[1:08:13] and in the beginning when God came down
[1:08:15] in the evening and talked to Adam and
[1:08:18] Eve in the cool of the day and his great
[1:08:21] voice whispered to them and they had
[1:08:23] fellowship so brother Lou you you spoke
[1:08:30] on the net the three things fellowship
[1:08:33] eternal life and inheritance but I want
[1:08:36] to do out tonight mostly on fellowship
[1:08:38] because fellowship always brings results
[1:08:42] it gives birth to something I mean so he
[1:08:48] says here and there fellowship loved one
[1:08:50] another how the moving of the Spirit
[1:08:52] went through the bushes the Lions come
[1:08:54] up the Tigers in all of them and they
[1:08:56] worship the Lord man was conscious at
[1:08:59] all time that the presence was with him
[1:09:05] hallelujah then he says here he says and
[1:09:08] in the beginning when man used to walk
[1:09:11] in the early age with God in the Garden
[1:09:13] of Eden when the first man was created
[1:09:15] in that Greek great Cathedral under the
[1:09:18] palms he and his wife when the cool of
[1:09:21] the evening come along they come out and
[1:09:23] worship God had a perfect fellowship God
[1:09:26] longs for fellowship and by the overt
[1:09:29] you said God want to save us more than
[1:09:31] what we want to be saved well he says
[1:09:33] now he wants more fellowship than what
[1:09:36] we were at one fellowship tonight so I
[1:09:39] hope you came in here tonight to worship
[1:09:41] Him
[1:09:42] you're not going to get anything if you
[1:09:43] sit in their own data you're gonna have
[1:09:45] to worship Him and fellowship with him
[1:09:48] and show him that you love him that's
[1:09:50] how you get something from God you
[1:09:52] conscious of his presence hallelujah and
[1:10:01] the process and even his wife and the
[1:10:04] cool of the evening come along they came
[1:10:06] out worship God at perfect fellowship
[1:10:09] God longs for fellowship and I'm here
[1:10:12] tonight if that was in the beginning we
[1:10:15] at the end again so now we at the end in
[1:10:18] the spirit they in the beginning God
[1:10:20] love fellowship now we are the last sage
[1:10:23] the climate God still loves fellowship
[1:10:26] and is coming down the gain in assuming
[1:10:30] a bride to do what to have fellowship so
[1:10:34] if you know what the fellowship God is
[1:10:37] gonna raise up somebody to take your
[1:10:39] place and there is no they gonna worship
[1:10:41] Him hallelujah
[1:10:46] he says he yes he wants people to speak
[1:10:49] with him to talk with him he says you
[1:10:53] you might sing too much or you might
[1:10:55] preach too much sometime but they've
[1:10:57] there's one thing you'll never be able
[1:10:59] to overdo and that is to pray he says
[1:11:05] here he says I'm gonna leave the books
[1:11:08] are just going quickly
[1:11:09] now that the beginning of man that what
[1:11:12] God gave him power over everything on
[1:11:15] the earth now through the fall he lost
[1:11:17] the power
[1:11:18] now we watching at this picture
[1:11:20] something went wrong and then through
[1:11:25] the fall he lost that power then he
[1:11:28] become unconscious of the fact after
[1:11:31] losing his relationship so fellowship
[1:11:35] brings relationship so he lost that and
[1:11:38] friendship fellowship with the father he
[1:11:41] lost that and all these channels become
[1:11:46] clogged up and he couldn't get through
[1:11:49] and then loss is a region in the God of
[1:11:52] England his relationship and fell
[1:11:55] that means communion with God was cut
[1:11:57] off right there
[1:11:58] because of sin and unbelief and unbelief
[1:12:01] is what in the world of Almighty God and
[1:12:05] so this picture was painted and out back
[1:12:08] there through our first father and
[1:12:10] mother they fell and that broke off
[1:12:12] fellowship with God and man was drew
[1:12:17] from the Garden of Eden from that hour
[1:12:19] and began to scream and God came down
[1:12:22] Adam Adam where thou he was hunting for
[1:12:24] his lost child now I like this when Adam
[1:12:29] and Eve fell
[1:12:30] God didn't send an angel hallelujah he
[1:12:36] didn't send an angel a decent game no
[1:12:38] God came down himself because it was his
[1:12:43] child that was lost and God didn't it
[1:12:46] wasn't a gift God knew he's gonna fall
[1:12:49] God noon is gonna something is gonna go
[1:12:51] wrong but you see man always runs from
[1:12:54] God there's no man that seeks God this
[1:12:57] look man that says eyes like I saw God
[1:13:00] and I know God so you oh good night to
[1:13:08] you in the voice of God calling you and
[1:13:10] the way down where are you hiding
[1:13:13] what are you hiding behind now what what
[1:13:16] but what made you realize you naked so
[1:13:18] there's a voice calling out my opinion
[1:13:25] why is lost child now what is tricky
[1:13:29] it's not that God didn't know because
[1:13:34] God created his own enemy
[1:13:39] come on ah you must reach back to me it
[1:13:43] was respect to me this God we serve
[1:13:46] created to his own enemy so because now
[1:13:54] there's a challenge going on
[1:13:56] it took out six thousand years to create
[1:13:59] the Eden and his own enemy came right
[1:14:03] into God's Eden after six thousand years
[1:14:07] and corrupted Eve and took them out of
[1:14:10] Eden
[1:14:12] so God say I must be just and Eve my
[1:14:15] enemy the same time so he gave him
[1:14:19] another six thousand years and he
[1:14:21] creates the Satan's Eden so now you
[1:14:24] mustn't be shocked what we hear in what
[1:14:26] we see versus Satan's even this is not
[1:14:30] the one that God prepared now we go into
[1:14:33] a city brother a plan you wanna wear
[1:14:36] there's no Sunnah where there's no
[1:14:38] sorrow with his legs in pain so we
[1:14:42] mustn't be shocked when we this happened
[1:14:44] and that happened versus Satan's Eden
[1:14:48] but brother I am here to tell you I
[1:14:51] always hear God's voice and um Adam when
[1:14:55] about God comes like it's a third season

[1:15:38] back to
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:45] my so God knew what was going to happen
[1:15:52] because in him was attributes and he
[1:15:56] couldn't do it if there was no fool you
[1:16:00] understand how could he be a same as
[1:16:03] there was in the sinner
[1:16:04] how could it be a healer if it there's
[1:16:07] no one's sick so we allowed that to
[1:16:10] prove to the enemy listen man I'm
[1:16:13] greater than you you can make them sick
[1:16:17] but I can heal them Oh hallelujah you
[1:16:22] can make them son and you can make him
[1:16:24] do the most father but you see my blood
[1:16:26] is gonna forgive them and look at them
[1:16:29] standing here tonight you know when you
[1:16:31] come from L suddenly comes short of the
[1:16:35] glory of God but the power God pull from
[1:16:39] the gutters of Al and he saved us
[1:16:41] hallelujah and any changes so he's here
[1:16:48] this contest is between God and Lucifer
[1:16:54] but this power is made manifest in the
[1:16:57] church you with me that's why I say we
[1:17:02] have to walk with God but the scripture
[1:17:05] says and walk with you so it's a it's a
[1:17:09] two-way street this I'll be their God
[1:17:12] they will be my people
[1:17:13] I'll walk in them and he says all I ask
[1:17:16] for you is just to walk humbly don't
[1:17:18] bring me a thousand dreams don't give me
[1:17:20] a troublesome oil no I don't want that
[1:17:21] just be a humble and show mercy and walk
[1:17:24] humbly before me
[1:17:26] God hates a proud spirit man Oh
[1:17:31] [Applause]
[1:17:34] whoa compliment couple we always under
[1:17:39] will came short of the glory of God how
[1:17:42] can I feel I'm bigger than you make me
[1:17:44] small you know we all see that in
[1:17:47] heavenly places in Christ Jesus there's
[1:17:50] no big you in Smoky no we are all the
[1:17:54] same
[1:17:55] [Applause]
[1:17:56] [Music]
[1:18:00] Wow
[1:18:04] so he says you know notice in his glory
[1:18:07] back there when he had sinned God lived
[1:18:11] felt so sorry for the poor fellow seaman
[1:18:14] Eve going away going out of the
[1:18:16] fellowship they would have to shop for
[1:18:18] themselves what do they do they had a
[1:18:21] loving father who would take care of
[1:18:23] them but now through disobedience got
[1:18:26] old fellowship
[1:18:27] no more fellowship they had to make it
[1:18:31] for themselves they had to tell the soil
[1:18:33] there to earn a living by the sweat of
[1:18:35] their brow they had to get sick and die
[1:18:37] in all kinds of troubles holidays and
[1:18:40] disappointments why severed fellowship
[1:18:43] no more fellowship with God it couldn't
[1:18:46] be so now the guy must ship for himself
[1:18:50] oh he says he never had to be sick he
[1:18:54] never had to die he never had to worry
[1:18:57] he never had a headache he never had
[1:18:59] fear he just climbed up in the arms of
[1:19:04] the Father and just like a child
[1:19:05] everything was his and whatever he asked
[1:19:08] he just got it why everything Oh baby
[1:19:11] because he was God's child and the child
[1:19:14] is an heir of all things that's why in
[1:19:19] Dominion he was God's child but when it
[1:19:23] was seven all of that was lost now we
[1:19:26] had to here to fend for himself
[1:19:29] and son son broke that fellowship man
[1:19:32] has been tossed from he says about from
[1:19:35] every wind of doctrine and he still
[1:19:38] tossed about he was turned out of the
[1:19:42] Garden of Eden to shuffle
[1:19:44] and then the skin looks great time he's
[1:19:46] still talking about God kills some
[1:19:48] animal took that skins
[1:19:51] innocent blood of an animal brought the
[1:19:53] skins and wrapped them around
[1:19:54] Adam and Eve and there was some
[1:19:57] fellowship with them again what so God
[1:20:00] realizes look I can't leave them
[1:20:02] completely cut off so he makes a tempura
[1:20:08] he's a temporal condition okay i slayed
[1:20:12] the lamb that would be me the condition
[1:20:13] the blood and our covenant schemes and
[1:20:16] promises as he walked out to the Garden
[1:20:18] of Eden you could hear the sheep skin
[1:20:20] eating against their brow and God felt
[1:20:22] so sorry
[1:20:22] and the blood running down Lisa's but
[1:20:24] that was the temporal position for them
[1:20:29] to come back into fellowship and speak
[1:20:31] again with Ghana and a fellowship again
[1:20:34] why through the shed blood of the Lamb
[1:20:38] hallelujah oh brother I feel a song
[1:20:41] coming on me he says denomination
[1:20:43] barriers will never work because you've
[1:20:46] got two issues you go to this church and
[1:20:48] Melissa denomination educational science
[1:20:51] God made one preparation for man to be
[1:20:54] restored back to fellowship nothing else
[1:20:57] he offered to the human race but the
[1:21:00] blood was the way back to fellowship and
[1:21:03] I say tonight in 2018 there's only one
[1:21:06] way back to fellowship brother he's not
[1:21:09] through your church he's not through
[1:21:10] your group it's not real pastor it's not
[1:21:13] through your church you run it through
[1:21:15] Jesus Christ and the shed blood of
[1:21:18] Calvary
[1:21:19] [Applause]
[1:21:21] hallelujah praise God and the enemy can
[1:21:26] keep you away brother
[1:21:27] if you come in tonight you come you

[1:22:03] hallelujah that's it Amen show the devil
[1:22:07] he wants to keep you there under
[1:22:10] condemnation but when you stand on your
[1:22:12] feet you defy nature when you reach a
[1:22:14] unified nature why I'm worshiping my god
[1:22:19] I'm showing the devil I mean fellowship
[1:22:25] oh I love this one brother feel this
[1:22:27] comes fresh fellowship is this way not

[1:23:03] face not even their mistakes not our
[1:23:06] mistakes can keep us away from God we
[1:23:09] serve a heavenly father and it's come
[1:23:12] down to call these children back through
[1:23:15] the blood of Calvary my god I see a
[1:23:19] black company Novus people I don't even

[1:23:46] said he'd turn the dead but the heels
[1:23:49] East bridge was the token he said
[1:23:51] brother and says God almost trapped
[1:23:53] himself because once the blood was
[1:23:56] applied he says every time you use Sun
[1:23:59] God want to come after you but as he
[1:24:01] comes there he sees the blood he can't

[1:49:20] guy yes
[1:49:21] you wrote him open you demote but God
[1:49:25] goes back to her and lets up now I left
[1:49:44] this one I wanted to keep it for first
[1:49:46] but I wanted to bring forth before this
[1:49:47] first guy there was one guy in the Old
[1:49:51] Testament that found the secret and if
[1:49:54] you support us so you know whom I'm
[1:49:55] talking about and the Bible says he
[1:49:58] walked with God he walked with God every
[1:50:06] morning he caught up he walked with God
[1:50:09] he loved in the days of Noah but the
[1:50:14] fear was right reading brother and says
[1:50:16] his name is Enoch and Enoch was Noah's
[1:50:20] grandfather can you imagine so he knew
[1:50:26] when anak was raptured then oh I begin
[1:50:29] with a hug and he says Noah was a type
[1:50:32] of the Jews but Enoch he found the
[1:50:36] secret and when he found the secret how
[1:50:39] to walk with God God says I better take
[1:50:41] him I better take this man because if
[1:50:46] more people is going to find out more
[1:50:47] people will be raptured but you see he
[1:50:49] had to fulfill that type because he was
[1:50:52] a seven from oh my
[1:50:55] he was the seventh from enema and he
[1:50:57] walked with God he found the secret how
[1:51:00] to walk with God and God says one day
[1:51:03] while he was walking his feet he'd the
[1:51:05] Kings Highway and he just kept walking
[1:51:07] and he walked up into glory God says
[1:51:10] come on come on
[1:51:11] you know come come come come I don't
[1:51:13] want them to find them I don't want them
[1:51:15] to find the secret and in the permit say
[1:51:19] come on in up on the pyramid so he put
[1:51:23] every secret every monthly in there so
[1:51:25] he knocked new in you I'll do walk with
[1:51:29] God oh yes something beautiful man
[1:51:32] and in a walk with God at his feet he
[1:51:34] the keys our way and it just took him
[1:51:36] home you know he's the type of the pride
[1:51:38] and he was raptured and so will the sky
[1:51:41] be raptured one of these mornings
[1:51:42] between 6:00 and 9:00 they say about
[1:51:45] Enoch they say you know he was he says
[1:51:48] you know he was for God and God took him
[1:51:52] Genesis 5:24 that's why didn't wanna
[1:51:54] read it because I kept it the original
[1:51:59] Hebrew meaning for walk implies of Enoch
[1:52:02] went to and fro with God continually
[1:52:05] conversing with him and growing concerti
[1:52:08] now we always think you know when I yell
[1:52:10] you know the pitch in my mind I almost
[1:52:12] thought he was in the armored some
[1:52:14] weather it's easy then if he's living in
[1:52:17] a cave on the mountain someone then it's
[1:52:19] easy but yet what they say they say he
[1:52:23] continually converse with him growing
[1:52:25] trusting in him we see a new kind of
[1:52:28] believer he walked arm-in-arm every day
[1:52:31] with the Lord the Lord was his very life
[1:52:33] so much so that the end of his life he
[1:52:35] did not taste death but he was
[1:52:37] translated out of this life Hebrews 11:5
[1:52:42] inoculant to walk pleasingly before God
[1:52:45] in the mass of a wicked society so Enoch
[1:52:49] wasn't separated he was right defines
[1:52:51] the people and the Bible says like it
[1:52:53] was in the days of Noah so that maybe
[1:52:55] Enoch loved in the days of Noah when
[1:52:58] they were eating
[1:52:59] drinking keeping in marriage that's a
[1:53:02] tiny love tea but he found the secret
[1:53:06] how do walk with God he'd wake up in the
[1:53:09] morning is a good morning father I'm
[1:53:11] ready to take a walk with you and but

[1:53:39] you know you better come over before
[1:53:42] someone else finds that secret and
[1:53:47] brother Theo says that that vision is
[1:53:49] for a time so take him home and in the
[1:53:53] end time after many many years yet comes
[1:53:56] Malachi for and it is us the revelation
[1:53:59] how to walk with God how do we change if
[1:54:02] you take those seven unknown thunders to

[1:57:14] nothing kept him bound though he was the
[1:57:16] earth man with all the obligations we
[1:57:18] have yet he knew how to get lighter
[1:57:23] Enoch was was not a part of this wicked
[1:57:26] world each day as he walked with the
[1:57:28] Lord he became less attached to the
[1:57:31] things below like Paul and itay me to
[1:57:34] this earthly life and he was taken up in
[1:57:37] his spirit to a heavenly realm and all
[1:57:40] around
[1:57:41] Enoch mankind grew increasingly ungodly
[1:57:44] yet as men change into wild beasts full
[1:57:47] of lust hardness and sensuality Enoch
[1:57:50] became more and more like the one with
[1:57:53] whom he walked oh don't you want to walk
[1:57:57] with Him oh you're the one speaking

[2:02:05] don't go too long there's so much there
[2:02:08] that I got you on Christ how we try to
[2:02:11] clean the church that he might live in
[2:02:13] and have fellowship with his heart is
[2:02:17] greater for fellowship than ours so God
[2:02:20] is closer than your right arm
[2:02:24] you think God is far from you brother
[2:02:27] says is right closer than your right arm
[2:02:30] it's right in your heart don't get tired
[2:02:35] I'm gonna close you know I'm gonna skip
[2:02:37] a lot of things and I want to wind up I
[2:02:39] want to show you here that we going back
[2:02:41] to Eden and we had I eaten conditioned
[2:02:43] on the earth and God had to demonstrate
[2:02:46] it before we leave to show there's a
[2:02:49] harvest coming and they will be the same
[2:02:57] [Applause]
[2:03:02] hallelujah
[2:03:03] I want you to stand I want everyone to
[2:03:06] stand I want you to listen to this
[2:03:08] please young people do me a favor you're
[2:03:11] not doing it for me yet God sees us and
[2:03:15] I'm skipping a lot of things and I'm
[2:03:17] going to write to the right to that to
[2:03:18] an Eden condition because Romans 8:26
[2:03:21] for the creature was made subject to
[2:03:23] vanity God knew you can afford the
[2:03:26] creature was made such a growl to fall
[2:03:29] there's nothing you can do God knew it
[2:03:32] but he knew in your heart is the same
[2:03:34] term that's why when it comes to
[2:03:36] predestination he says not even your own
[2:03:39] choosing no man can come to the Father
[2:03:41] unless my father draws him so it's not
[2:03:48] even your own choice I have the codec
[2:03:50] okay then he says how there's something
[2:03:53] beyond the veil yonder that pulls a
[2:03:55] Christian he can't explain it he doesn't
[2:03:57] understand it himself but there is
[2:03:58] something in that fellowship that he was
[2:04:01] with Christ that's why Christ in John 7
[2:04:04] is his father he says I want them to be
[2:04:06] where we are
[2:04:07] that was his desire you want that
[2:04:11] fellowship with you he says Lord can
[2:04:13] they be will I am and let them be one
[2:04:16] like you on Iowa you see so God wants
[2:04:20] fellowship and you don't give him enough
[2:04:23] fellowship and that's why we have less
[2:04:26] prayers answered the more we're gonna
[2:04:28] healed ourselves he says sister do the
[2:04:30] dishes quickly and once it's done go
[2:04:32] back to
[2:04:36] he says where's those old mothers that
[2:04:38] used to pre-conviction upon their
[2:04:40] children I'm gonna give a short test
[2:04:44] when I preach in New York brother promo

[2:04:57] it search for him and he saw the man
[2:04:59] driving the car going all the way down
[2:05:01] and then he said I sent the enforces the
[2:05:06] Holy Ghost after that man and while he
[2:05:08] was driving - all the way all of a
[2:05:10] sudden in the car comes conviction the
[2:05:12] man to his place she makes a u-turn any
[2:05:16] rights back and he leaves the carcass to
[2:05:19] the place and he starts running away you

[2:05:30] keys and everything and I know it is but

[2:05:36] know I said night God will go after a
[2:05:39] motor car and bring it back how much
[2:05:43] more our children brother then he's back

[2:05:48] speak their names man speak their names

[2:20:39] mountain and the snow was drying up the
[2:20:41] hot Sun steam coming out of my shirt
[2:20:44] just a moment or two difference and I
[2:20:47] started walking down the mountain and
[2:20:49] when I did now yeah I'm coming he says I
