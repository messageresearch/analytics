[14:07] our Zoom prayer meeting
[14:09] tonight and
[14:11] um if have your Bibles and keep the
[14:14] Bible close by I want to read two
[14:16] portion of scripture one from Matthew
[14:18] 21:12
[14:20] to13 and acts 747 to 50 or take it from
[14:25] there Matthew 211 12-13 says and Jesus
[14:28] went into temple of God cast out them
[14:31] that sold and bought in the temple and
[14:33] overthrew the tables of the money
[14:35] changers and the seats of them that so
[14:37] doves said unto
[14:39] them it is written my house shall be
[14:44] called The House of
[14:46] Prayer but you have made it a den of
[14:49] Thieves acts 7 verse 47 to 50 reads but
[14:55] Solomon built him an house how be it the
[14:59] most high dwelleth not in temples made
[15:03] with hands as sayth the prophet Heaven
[15:06] is my throne and Earth is my foot stol
[15:10] but what house will he build me sayth
[15:12] the Lord or what is the place of my rest
[15:16] had not my hand made all these things
[15:19] may God bless his word praise God and I
[15:24] have a thought I like to share with you
[15:27] what house will you build
[15:31] and I'm trying to see that house as a
[15:33] House of Prayer and we want to look at
[15:38] our bodies your bodies as the temple of
[15:42] God a little different tonight I sort of
[15:45] mini I'll run through some scriptures
[15:48] see what the Lord will do so he said
[15:51] Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot
[15:53] stool what house will you build me say
[15:56] the Lord or what is the place of my
[15:59] rest and the prophet said and start
[16:02] perect man he said this morning we want
[16:04] to speak on a subject or teach rather if
[16:06] we can building the living
[16:10] Tabernacle
[16:11] building the living Tabernacle of the
[16:14] living God's Dwelling Place the perfect
[16:18] man the living
[16:20] Tabernacle of the Living God where he
[16:23] dwell now this is beautiful even how it
[16:25] is phe the living Tabernacle so what
[16:29] that does that moves your mind away from
[16:33] the physical building the physical
[16:35] church that you attend to and it zooms
[16:39] in on a different light of this thing
[16:42] called the perfect man it's living
[16:45] tabernac then he was talking about the
[16:47] same way he brought his church up the
[16:50] same way he bringing his people up then
[16:53] Peter here says first seven things Faith
[16:55] virtue C knowledge Temperance patience
[16:58] godliness Brotherly Love at brotherly
[17:00] kindness and then the love of God the
[17:04] Holy Ghost here we go Christ in the
[17:08] person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you
[17:11] in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[17:15] and you got all these virtues seal in
[17:17] you then God lives in a
[17:22] tabernacle called the building the
[17:25] living
[17:26] Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling
[17:31] Place when a man possesses these kind of
[17:34] things then the Holy Ghost comes upon
[17:38] him so the object of God is not for you
[17:42] to be church ified it's for you to
[17:45] become a living
[17:48] Tabernacle now that kills all the
[17:50] excuses you may have against a deacon a
[17:52] Elder Minister Pastor the church that
[17:56] kills all of that and that's strips each
[17:59] person naked before God as to whether or
[18:04] not they are a tabernacle or becoming a
[18:09] tabernacle of the Living God Heaven is
[18:12] my
[18:13] Throne Earth is my foot to what house
[18:17] will you build me I hope you see
[18:20] something here tonight let's
[18:23] continue 1 Corinthians 6 verse 13- 20
[18:28] Paul speaks Meats for belly belly for
[18:31] Meats but God shall destroy both it and
[18:35] them now the body is not for
[18:41] fornication but for the Lord and the
[18:44] Lord for the body
[18:48] note the Lord for the body and God had
[18:52] put raise up the Lord and will also
[18:55] raise us by his own power know ye not
[18:59] that your bodies are the members of
[19:01] Christ see so so Paul is actually
[19:05] bringing them completely out of church
[19:08] completely out of location completely
[19:11] out of physical structure and look how
[19:13] he's presenting it now this is the the
[19:15] bodies know know ye not verse
[19:18] 15 that your bodies are the members of
[19:21] Christ shall I then take the members of
[19:24] Christ and make them members of an halot
[19:27] God forbid
[19:29] what know ye not that he which is joined
[19:32] on harot is one body for two say he
[19:35] shall be one flesh but he that is joined
[19:39] unto the Lord is one
[19:41] Spirit flee
[19:43] fornication every sin that a man doeth
[19:47] is without the body but he that commit
[19:50] fornication sinth
[19:52] against his own
[19:55] body
[19:57] what Paul PA speaks KN ye not that your
[20:01] body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[20:05] which is in you which he have of God and
[20:09] he are not your own
[20:12] aha so now it come to
[20:16] ownership it comes to who really owns
[20:20] this
[20:22] house this house that we have as a
[20:25] tabernacle this house as we have we have
[20:29] as a as a building who really is in
[20:31] charge of that house and I wrote down
[20:34] something here tonight that this body or
[20:38] house is not your
[20:41] own and you were not part of the design
[20:45] team or part of the team that made
[20:48] it so we must be concerned with what we
[20:53] do with it look at verse 20 now for ye
[20:57] are bought with a price
[20:59] [Music]
[21:00] therefore glorify God in your body and
[21:05] in your spirit which are
[21:09] Gods so this is a clear
[21:12] directive that we can glorify God in our
[21:16] physical
[21:17] bodies so in other words our life are
[21:21] not just like as a as a spiritual
[21:24] being because we on Earth we are subject
[21:28] to the senses of the earth that is why
[21:31] we have to be able to take a hold of
[21:34] this body that we have or this house
[21:37] that we have or this Tabernacle that we
[21:40] have that we did not design and we did
[21:43] not make let's
[21:47] continue Hebrews
[21:50] 10 verse
[21:53] 4-7 it says for it is not possible that
[21:57] the blood of bulls and goat should take
[21:58] away
[21:59] sin wherefore when he cometh into the
[22:02] world he sayth sacrifice and offering
[22:05] thou wouldest not but a body H has thou
[22:10] prepared me in bir offerings and
[22:12] sacrifices for sin thou have no pleasure
[22:14] then I said no I come in the volume of
[22:16] the book it is written of me to do thy
[22:18] will oh God so this sacrifice and
[22:23] offering which was figurative of a true
[22:27] sacrifice that was coming we talking
[22:30] about your
[22:31] body being prepared you being prepared
[22:35] your mind being prepared because what
[22:38] God really wants is your body your house
[22:43] your
[22:44] Tabernacle and the Lord is that spirit
[22:46] and where the spirit of the Lord is
[22:48] there is true Liberty what do you think
[22:50] Lucifer
[22:51] wants what do you think the devil wants
[22:54] he wants your house he wants your
[22:57] Tabernacle what does God want you want
[22:59] to use your eyes your ears your mouth
[23:01] your being you have to see it for what
[23:04] it is and the devil sees an
[23:06] opportunity God sees an opportunity but
[23:09] the opportunity of God is different
[23:11] because he put a seed in you before the
[23:13] foundation of the world and that seed is
[23:16] what is attracted to the word but
[23:18] because we are attract I uses that word
[23:22] in flesh meaning that we bypass our
[23:25] theophany so that we can be tempted and
[23:27] tried and tested
[23:29] it means that we have options as to the
[23:32] extent that we surrender as to the
[23:35] extent that we yield as the extent we
[23:39] give over our lives over to him and that
[23:42] is why in the par of Jesus when you talk
[23:45] about the seed fall on good ground you
[23:47] talk about some 30 some 60 some 100 all
[23:56] did not produce full yield
[23:59] so that means there are conditions that
[24:02] affects us from bringing forth full
[24:05] yield of the crop that God want from us
[24:09] he described it in John 15 as I am the
[24:11] vine you're the branches every branch
[24:13] that doesn't produce cut off and every
[24:15] brand I produce I purge to do what more
[24:18] fruit and here in is my father glorified
[24:20] what for much fruit so God is not in
[24:22] this dead beat thing as I said God don't
[24:25] want to break even he wants to know
[24:27] there's a productive
[24:29] a production of his word of his life and
[24:32] everything else let me see I can wrap up
[24:34] here
[24:35] now all
[24:37] right Romans
[24:39] [Music]
[24:41] 1 verse
[24:43] 18 I don't know if I ever read this
[24:46] scripture before to
[24:49] you but listen to this Romans 1:18 for
[24:53] the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven
[24:57] against all
[24:59] ungodliness and
[25:01] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[25:05] truth in
[25:06] unrighteousness because that which be
[25:08] known of God is Manifest in them for God
[25:11] had showed it unto them for the
[25:13] invisible things of him from the
[25:15] creation of the world are clearly seen
[25:17] being understood by the things that are
[25:20] made even as eternal power on godhead so
[25:23] that they are without
[25:24] excuse because that when they knew God
[25:28] they glorified him not as God neither
[25:30] were thankful but became vain in their
[25:32] imagination and their foolish heart was
[25:35] darkened professing themselves to be
[25:38] wise they became fools and changed the
[25:42] glory of The Incorruptible God into an
[25:45] image made like the corruptible man to
[25:47] birds and foref footed beasts and
[25:49] creeping things wherefore God here we go
[25:52] God also give them up to
[25:55] uncleanness through the lust of the
[25:58] their own
[26:00] Hearts to dishonor their own bodies
[26:04] between themselves who changed the truth
[26:08] of God into a lie and worship and serve
[26:12] the creature more than the Creator who
[26:15] is blessed forever amen for this cause
[26:18] God gave them up unto vile affections
[26:23] for even their woman did change the
[26:26] natural use into that which is against
[26:29] nature and like why also the men leaving
[26:33] the natural use of the woman burn in
[26:36] their lust one towards another men with
[26:40] men working that which is unseemly and
[26:44] receiving in themselves that recompense
[26:46] of their error which was meat and even
[26:49] as they did not like to retain God in
[26:51] their knowledge God give them over to a
[26:54] reprobate mind to do those things which
[26:57] are not convenient
[26:59] they amplifi this verse 28 says and so
[27:01] since they did not see fit to
[27:03] acknowledge God or approve of him or
[27:07] consider him worth the knowing god give
[27:10] them over to a base and condemned mind
[27:14] to do things that are not proper and
[27:17] decent or decent but
[27:20] lome being filled with
[27:23] unrighteousness fornication wickedness
[27:27] courageousness
[27:28] maliciousness full of Envy murder debate
[27:32] deceit maginity Whisperers backbiters
[27:36] haters of God despiteful proud boasters
[27:40] inventor of evil things Disobedience of
[27:43] parents without understanding Covenant
[27:46] Breakers without natural affection
[27:48] implacable
[27:50] unmerciful who knoweth the Judgment of
[27:52] God that they which commit such things
[27:55] are worthy of debt not only to do the
[27:57] same
[27:58] but have pleasure in them that do
[28:04] them so you can see
[28:07] here and all this men and men and women
[28:10] and woman and you could see is a
[28:12] perversion because God made man a
[28:14] certain way woman a certain way God made
[28:15] us a certain way this is his
[28:19] house what house are you going to build
[28:22] him and I use that scripture with Jesus
[28:25] running them and he said my house shall
[28:27] be called House of Prayer we cannot
[28:30] continue prayerless lives we cannot
[28:33] continue as if we have this sense of
[28:37] ownership and permanence as opposed to
[28:41] God give you like a rent or a lease with
[28:44] this Tabernacle that you have for a
[28:46] certain amount of time and sometime you
[28:49] have to sign off from this lease
[28:52] agreement and it's how you take care of
[28:55] that and God told the prophet when he
[28:56] was young don't smoke Don't drink don't
[29:00] defile yourself with woman because I
[29:03] have a work for you to do and if God
[29:06] said that it means that defilement is
[29:09] something that God takes very
[29:11] serious defilement is something God
[29:14] takes very very serious and and remember
[29:18] we are not God we have to follow through
[29:21] with his requirements there's a reason
[29:24] why God will speak about repentance
[29:26] there's a reason why God will say come
[29:28] and reason together do your sins be a
[29:30] scholet you shall be righteous know even
[29:33] if God wants to be merciful and and he
[29:36] is and pardon there's a way to get that
[29:40] pardon that he's looking for those who
[29:42] will ask for it if you want to be
[29:44] reconciled to God tonight you can be
[29:46] reconciled because you're not being
[29:49] reconciled to a man you're being
[29:50] reconciled to God people could be
[29:53] reconciled to church but still not to
[29:54] God people can come to church and still
[29:57] don't know anything about God because
[29:59] they see church as an end game they see
[30:02] church as an objective a place to go to
[30:05] a place to worship if you flip the
[30:07] script and see those that worship idols
[30:09] they go to a temple they go to a
[30:11] tabernacle they go to a house whatever
[30:13] it is and they worship the Creator the
[30:16] creature and when they leave from that
[30:19] worship they feel good they really think
[30:21] this is God and here it is the Living
[30:24] God wants to take you and I as
[30:28] Tabernacles that we could be living
[30:30] Tabernacles and this is where I'm going
[30:31] to close
[30:33] tonight from Romans chapter 12 so all
[30:37] that backdrop bring us to this scripture
[30:39] Romans 12 fam scripture verse one I
[30:43] besee you therefore Brethren by the
[30:46] mercies of God that you present your
[30:52] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[30:56] acceptable unto God
[30:58] which is your
[31:00] reasonable yes you could party yes you
[31:03] could go and take a line yes you could
[31:04] do with your friends yes you could do
[31:06] this and do that and do it's you your
[31:08] choice but Paul encouraging them to
[31:13] present their bodies a Living Sacrifice
[31:16] which is your reasonable service it is
[31:20] the base the bottom what it can give God
[31:23] that sacrifice watch now that you be not
[31:26] conformed to this world
[31:28] but be transformed by renewing of your
[31:31] mind that you may prove what is a good
[31:35] and acceptable will of God and this is
[31:38] the Amplified I appeal to you therefore
[31:40] Brethren and beg of you in view of all
[31:43] the mercies of God to make a decisive
[31:47] dedication of your bodies presenting all
[31:51] your members and
[31:53] faculties as a Living Sacrifice it come
[31:56] like if you
[31:58] present your body in service on a Sunday
[32:00] on a Wednesday but that is you
[32:03] presenting your physical body but from
[32:05] all the other days you taken in
[32:08] Hollywood or you just absorbing movies
[32:10] or whatever it is that means your mind
[32:13] which is part of your body your head or
[32:15] whatever your eyes and whatever you have
[32:18] that Focus somewhere else because if you
[32:20] take it from the scriptures Samson loved
[32:22] God Samson was really serving the lord
[32:25] and everything else but he end up now
[32:26] giving his strength to God part of his
[32:28] body and he gave his heart to a woman
[32:31] and that end up being a real downfall
[32:33] for him so here what the Bible talk
[32:35] about presenting all your members and
[32:38] faculties as a Living Sacrifice holy
[32:41] devoted consecrated and well pleasing to
[32:44] God which is your reasonable rational
[32:47] intelligence service and spiritual
[32:48] worship do not be conformed to this
[32:51] world this age fashioned after and
[32:54] adapted to its external superficial
[32:56] Customs but be transformed Changed by
[33:00] the entire renewal of your mind by its
[33:03] new ideas it New Attitudes so that you
[33:06] may prove for yourself what is the good
[33:09] and acceptable perfect will of God even
[33:12] the thing which is good and acceptable
[33:14] and perfect in his sight for you so I'll
[33:17] close and I have one more scripture and
[33:18] that is
[33:19] it all right yes one more scripture so
[33:23] when you come to service when you come
[33:25] to
[33:26] pran you are hearing
[33:28] God's thoughts if we are presenting the
[33:31] word to you and these thoughts is what
[33:34] you have to embrace these thoughts and
[33:37] words is what you have to connect with
[33:39] what you have to repeat what you have to
[33:40] go and read over what you have to say
[33:42] Lord this is this is mind I claim it it
[33:44] is mind because your mind has to be
[33:48] changed and renewed you know come like
[33:50] somebody who go up in a vient uh
[33:52] environment mother have gone father have
[33:54] gone th stealing whatever whatever the
[33:57] child being raised in a violent it'll be
[34:00] normal for the child to be accustomed
[34:02] and this is just a normal environment
[34:04] the noise the cursing and the swearing
[34:07] for that child to get a new environment
[34:10] is a whole different thing all together
[34:11] a different experience you see and This
[34:14] Is Us born in sin shap iniquity our
[34:16] lives have been shap us with way and
[34:18] you're coming out and things hitting you
[34:21] things are convicting you things are
[34:23] almost like people might say pulling
[34:26] teeth right it's hard but the truth of
[34:29] it is this is what going to change and
[34:31] transform
[34:33] you this is what it is last scripture
[34:36] and we will
[34:39] close Paul in 1 Thessalonians
[34:43] 41-5 Paul says furthermore then I we
[34:46] beseech you Brethren and exalt you by
[34:48] the Lord Jesus that as he have receiv
[34:50] received of us how you ought to walk and
[34:54] to please God so you would abound more
[34:58] and more for you know what Commandments
[35:01] we give you by the Lord Jesus for this
[35:03] is the will of God even your
[35:06] sanctification that you should abstain
[35:08] from fornication and this verse here
[35:11] verse four is such a powerful verse that
[35:14] every one of you should know how to
[35:19] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[35:23] honor not in the lust of cense even as
[35:27] the Gentile which know not God and this
[35:31] is the last quote this is the same text
[35:34] in the amplifi furthermore brethren we
[35:37] beg and admonish you in virtue of our
[35:40] Union with the Lord Jesus that you
[35:43] follow the instructions which you learn
[35:46] from us about how you ought to walk so
[35:50] as to please and gratify God as indeed
[35:53] you are doing that you do so even more
[35:57] and more abundantly attaining yet a
[36:00] greater perfection in living this life
[36:03] for you know what charges and precepts
[36:06] we give you on the authority and by the
[36:08] inspiration of the Lord Jesus for this
[36:10] is the will of God that you should be
[36:12] consecrated separated and set apart for
[36:15] pure and holy living that you should
[36:17] abstain and Shrink from all sexual vice
[36:23] that each one of you should know how to
[36:27] position
[36:29] control manage his own body in
[36:34] consecration Purity separated from
[36:37] things profane and honor not to be used
[36:40] in passion of lust like the Heathen who
[36:42] are ignorant of the true God and have no
[36:45] knowledge of his will let's bow our
[36:47] heads father God I thank you it was such
[36:50] a blessing to be here tonight to share

[37:02] and speak to them and convict them and
[37:04] anoint them and Inspire them as they cry

[37:12] just bring anything at the altar or
[37:15] bring whatever sacrifice we think that
