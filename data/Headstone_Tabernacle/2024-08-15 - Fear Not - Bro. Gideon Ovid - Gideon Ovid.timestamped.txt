[34:14] pray amen amen
[34:16] amen you love him
[34:20] tonight thank you
[34:25] Jesus what a blessing it is is to be
[34:28] here once
[34:30] again and I'd like to invite you to turn
[34:33] with me to one Short scripture I want to
[34:38] take my time and ensure everybody gets
[34:40] it everybody finds it I wouldn't be too
[34:42] long at
[34:45] all I believe that God has something
[34:47] special in store for us tonight
[34:50] amen So reading from the book of second
[34:53] Timothy chapter
[34:56] 1 and verse
[35:10] 7 would you find it say
[35:13] Amen all right and it says for God had
[35:16] not given us the spirit of fear but of
[35:20] power and of love and of a sound mind
[35:23] amen you believe that so he didn't call
[35:26] us to be shaken he didn't call us to be
[35:29] on the defensive but he called us to be
[35:31] on the offensive he called us to be
[35:34] strong and bold and brave not to be
[35:36] shaken under the task Mas under what the
[35:40] enemy has to throw at us but he's called
[35:43] us to not have
[35:46] fear to not cow to not bow down but to
[35:51] be raised up in such a time as this amen
[35:55] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[35:56] reading of his word
[35:58] you may have your
[36:02] seats for a
[36:04] title it's fair
[36:07] not and for a subject perfect love cast
[36:11] out Fair amen perfect love casts out
[36:15] fear the titled fear not because we are
[36:18] called in this time as mighty Gentile
[36:21] Warriors but just before just to clarify
[36:23] and to make the distinction you know the
[36:26] Bible says the fear of the Lord is the
[36:28] beginning of wisdom but that's not the
[36:30] fear we talking about tonight tonight we
[36:32] want to look at the spirit of fear that
[36:35] sometimes seems to bind us that keep us
[36:39] in in a in a state of Doubt where we're
[36:40] not sure who we are or what's promised
[36:42] to us and our ability to access that you
[36:46] see once you get to know who you are and
[36:48] what promises are left for you you could
[36:50] operate with a level of confidence you
[36:53] could operate with a level of boldness
[36:55] knowing that you could accomplish
[36:57] whatsoever is set out in front of you
[37:01] amen so in this end time I want to say
[37:05] whenever God is fixing to do something
[37:08] miraculous He commands that you have no
[37:10] fear he would say things like be bold be
[37:14] strong be courageous fear
[37:18] not
[37:22] amen he always command that you have no
[37:25] fear when he's about to do something cuz
[37:27] he doesn't like to work with weaklings
[37:29] he doesn't like to work with people that
[37:31] are shaky on the inside I did a little
[37:33] research about fair and they say
[37:35] fair although it may start
[37:38] mental has physical
[37:42] manifestations so people often express I
[37:45] feel afraid I feel fearful I have fear
[37:49] but rarely it has physical manifestation
[37:52] to say when you are afraid or frightful
[37:54] or experience fear there's a little
[37:56] feedback on the platform when you
[37:58] experience that they say your heart rate
[38:00] goes
[38:01] up they say your heart starts to beat
[38:04] faster scientifically it said or
[38:07] medically blood moves away from your
[38:09] hearts and towards your limbs so it puts
[38:12] you in what they call a fight or flight
[38:14] attitude so yes it could work well if
[38:18] your your your your challenge and let's
[38:21] say you're being chased by a dog or or
[38:23] or some some scenario that you need to
[38:24] get away quickly that feir may be seen
[38:27] as something good but guess what I also
[38:30] saw that when you are overcome with fear
[38:33] it stresses you out and that stress
[38:36] could be detrimental because it causes
[38:38] you to be
[38:42] double-minded double minded and we know
[38:45] a double-minded man is unstable in all
[38:48] his ways God doesn't want us to be like
[38:50] that so he often would say fear not it
[38:54] is I fear not
[38:57] amen before giving out his commands
[39:01] Amen in addition to saying fair not he
[39:04] also gives a sense of assurance so he
[39:08] doesn't just leave fair not don't be
[39:10] afraid so he just imagine for instance
[39:14] if you are afraid of dogs and you see a
[39:16] dog coming the Natural Instinct it's
[39:19] innate for you to to be afraid so if I
[39:22] were to say don't
[39:24] fear those are words but if I say don't
[39:26] be afraid afid because here I have a
[39:28] whip and if any dog come so I put a
[39:31] provision to protect you so you're now
[39:33] in a position to enforce the command to
[39:36] fair not amen so in this case we've seen
[39:39] through
[39:40] scripture that God has not just
[39:43] challenge us to to put away faar but he
[39:47] has also enforced it by putting
[39:50] Provisions in place for us to be all
[39:54] right I want you at the same time to
[39:57] remember that that this here is not a
[39:59] drill this is not a recruitment exercise
[40:02] God is not now looking for soldiers he
[40:05] recruited before the foundation of the
[40:07] world so right now you're in the
[40:09] training ground because this is not a
[40:11] simulation this is not a drill this is
[40:14] reality and he has prepared you for such
[40:17] a time as this in this battle we're
[40:20] fighting a real enemy you're not
[40:22] fighting me you're not fighting flesh
[40:24] and blood so you need to be prepared and
[40:27] to be victorious in this battle you have
[40:30] to Cast Away faar you have to throw that
[40:32] aside you have to G up your loins you
[40:35] have to answer like a man you have to to
[40:38] put your chest back put your shoulders
[40:40] back and be Brave and Bold like David
[40:44] and say I'll cut your head off I will
[40:46] cut your head off because God has made a
[40:49] promise to you and nothing is going to
[40:52] stop it from coming to pass nothing is
[40:54] going to stop it from becoming manifest
[40:56] in your life
[40:57] and it doesn't apply to your parents and
[41:00] not you it applies to the old to the
[41:03] young to the children it doesn't matter
[41:04] who you are where you are how long
[41:07] you're in church how long you're in the
[41:08] message how much spoken word books you
[41:10] read you're still called to fight in
[41:12] this battle you're still called to
[41:15] possess your inheritance that's left for
[41:19] you the reason we train is because in
[41:22] this battle we have all sorts of
[41:24] distractions we have all sorts of things
[41:27] trying to pull us this way and pull us
[41:29] that way but we've been trained to to
[41:32] hear a certain sound we've been trained
[41:34] to hear that sound they say if you don't
[41:38] know that sound how could you prepare
[41:39] for the battle how would you be prepared
[41:42] you hear a horn over there and you you
[41:44] don't know if it's an ice cream truck or
[41:46] you don't know if it's time to to put on
[41:48] your boots to G up your loins to have
[41:50] your staff in your hand to have your
[41:52] sandals on your feet Amen Let Let me
[41:56] just switch for a second
[41:58] and and in the Book of Joshua 1 and and
[42:01] and and and we're familiar with it this
[42:03] is after Moses now and God actually
[42:06] commands Joshua to operate without fear
[42:10] right and of course we know he was Moses
[42:13] Minister and in in verse 5 of Joshua 1
[42:15] it says there shall not any man be able
[42:18] to stand before thee all the days of thy
[42:23] life as I was with Moses so I will be
[42:26] with thee
[42:27] I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be
[42:30] strong and of a good courage For unto
[42:32] this people shall thou divide for an
[42:34] inheritance the land which I swear upon
[42:37] their fathers to give them so all that
[42:39] there highlights the
[42:41] promise that's not the command yet that
[42:43] that's just the promise he said listen
[42:44] here what this is my mission for you
[42:47] that I have committed and I have
[42:49] promised this and my promise will never
[42:52] fail will never fall it shall always
[42:55] accomplish amen so it goes on he said in
[42:58] verse 7 only be thou strong and and very
[43:01] courageous so it have have some some
[43:03] some contingencies here only be thou
[43:06] strong and very courageous that thou
[43:08] mayest observe to do according to all
[43:10] the law which Moses my servant commanded
[43:13] thee turn not from it to the right hand
[43:16] or to the left that thou mayest Prosper
[43:19] withersoever thou goest the book of the
[43:21] Lord shall not depart out of thy mouth
[43:23] but thou shal meditate therein day and
[43:25] night and thou May Subs deserve to do
[43:27] according to all that is written therein
[43:30] for then Thou shalt make thy way
[43:34] prosperous and then thou shal have good
[43:36] success so there is a few verses
[43:39] highlighting this is the promise here
[43:41] this is the goal this is exactly what's
[43:43] going to happen if you could hold on to
[43:46] the contingencies that I I I I have
[43:48] outlined and in verse n listen to this
[43:50] one he says have not I commanded thee be
[43:54] strong and and of a good courage be Not
[43:57] Afraid neither be thou dismayed so I
[44:00] don't want you D and out I don't want
[44:02] you to flake on me I want you to stand
[44:04] tall I want you to be steadfast single
[44:08] eyed and focused knowing this is the
[44:10] goal we set out the objectives we've
[44:13] laid it out for you and I expect you to
[44:15] see it through till the end he said be
[44:18] thou dismayed neither be thou dismayed
[44:20] listen listen this is the provision here
[44:22] for the Lord thy God is with thee so
[44:26] this is not just be not not afraid he
[44:29] said because I am with thee the Lord is
[44:31] with
[44:32] thee withersoever thou goest so if you
[44:36] go to the left or to the right if you go
[44:38] into battle he promised that he'll be
[44:41] there he said he'll never leave you nor
[44:43] forsake you but he will be even in you
[44:45] to the end of the age but you have to to
[44:48] look at the contingencies one of the
[44:50] things he say fair not go boldly because
[44:54] this is the promise he highlighted
[44:55] before amen
[44:58] now it's interesting to note in Joshua 7
[45:01] now they would have gone on and in the
[45:02] story of Joshua the promise was listen
[45:05] no man shall stand before thee this is a
[45:08] 100% success rate nobody nobody nobody
[45:11] nobody in Joshua
[45:14] 7 this is the scenario with
[45:17] Aon it says in verse one but the
[45:20] children of Israel committed a trespass
[45:23] in the accured thing for aen the son of
[45:25] Kami son of Z zabdi son of Zarah in the
[45:29] tribe of Judah took the ACC cursing and
[45:31] the anger of the Lord was kindled
[45:33] against the children of Israel you see
[45:35] that now God's
[45:39] promise doesn't negate his
[45:41] judgment that's good no matter what he
[45:44] promised you it doesn't mean that you're
[45:46] immune and you can do as you please
[45:48] because there are
[45:50] contingencies he said stay don't go to
[45:53] the left or to the right meditate on my
[45:56] word operate this particular way why
[45:58] because I will be with thee and you know
[46:00] what your success is guaranteed have no
[46:03] fear that's he command have no fear and
[46:06] you'll be successful if you could do
[46:08] these things now listen hallu in verse
[46:13] five Hallelujah and the men of I SM of
[46:18] them about 30 and six men for they
[46:21] chased them from before the gate even
[46:24] unto shearim and SME them in the going
[46:27] down wherefore the hearts of the people
[46:29] melted and became as
[46:31] water you know what that said there it
[46:33] says listen that's licks like fire no
[46:35] you're going and they're chasing and
[46:36] they're running like dogs no now does
[46:39] that sound like success to you no no no
[46:40] no no no no no no no no no no imagine
[46:44] God promised that no man should stand
[46:46] before thee and your men being routed
[46:49] before you even reach the enemy's gate
[46:51] that is the power of sin that is the
[46:54] power of Disobedience that is the power
[46:56] of staying from what he set forward as
[46:59] his contingencies but there is a chapter
[47:02] 8 and in chapter 8 this is after it was
[47:05] cleaned out after Aon was ston and
[47:07] removed it says and the Lord said unto
[47:09] Joshua listen now fear
[47:11] not neither be thou dismayed this is for
[47:14] the second time take all the people of
[47:17] war with thee and arise go up to I see I
[47:21] have given into thy hand the king of I
[47:23] and his people and his City and his land
[47:27] and thou shalt do to I and her King as
[47:30] thou did unto Jericho and her King only
[47:33] the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof
[47:36] shall he take for a prey unto yourselves
[47:38] lay thee an ambush your city behind it
[47:40] so Victory again success again once you
[47:43] could apply his contingencies he say
[47:46] listen fear not I don't want you be down
[47:49] and out be not dismayed don't worry
[47:51] about the past don't worry about what
[47:54] happened last night don't worry about
[47:55] what happened yesterday today I want you
[47:57] to stand stand tall stand bold be brave
[48:01] because my promise will never fail and
[48:04] he chose you before the foundation of
[48:06] the world
[48:08] Amen switching quickly to Gideon in the
[48:12] Book of Judges chapter 12 sorry chapter
[48:15] 6 and verse 12 I want you to know that
[48:18] fear not just paralyzes your faith but
[48:21] it's used as a filter Hallelujah God
[48:23] don't like it he don't want it he don't
[48:26] even want chain his army if you're
[48:27] afraid you know what he says if you're
[48:29] afraid stay home stay home because on
[48:32] the battlefield we want Warriors we want
[48:35] trained men we want people who could say
[48:38] we're more than able to conquer amen so
[48:41] in Judges chapter 6 and verse 12 and it
[48:44] says and the angel of the Lord appeared
[48:46] unto him and said unto him the Lord is
[48:48] with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor and
[48:51] we know the story and Gideon said unto
[48:52] them oh my Lord if the Lord be with us
[48:56] why then has all this befallen us
[48:58] adversity has
[49:00] fallen and where be all his miracles
[49:03] which our father told us of saying did
[49:06] not the Lord bring us up from Egypt so
[49:08] this is after Moses now but now the Lord
[49:11] had forsaken us and has delivered us
[49:13] into the hand of the midianites and the
[49:15] Lord looks upon him this is verse 4 now
[49:17] and says go in this thy might and thou
[49:21] shalt save Israel from the hand of the
[49:23] midianites have not I sent
[49:25] thee and he said unto him oh my Lord
[49:29] wherewith shall I save Israel behold my
[49:32] family is poor in Manasseh and I am the
[49:35] least of my father's house and the Lord
[49:37] said unto him listen provision
[49:41] now surely I will be with thee and thou
[49:44] shalt Smite the midianites as one man
[49:47] and down to verse 22 it says and when
[49:51] Gideon perceived that he was an angel of
[49:54] the Lord Gideon says alas oh Lord God
[49:57] for because I have seen an angel of the
[49:59] Lord face to face and the Lord said unto
[50:02] him in verse 23 peace be unto thee fear
[50:06] not Thou shalt not die so I am giving
[50:09] you a command you're going to Smite the
[50:12] midianites as one man but you can't go
[50:15] in there with fear as a matter of fact
[50:18] in chapter 7 and verse two it says and
[50:21] the Lord said unto Gideon the people
[50:23] that are with thee are too many for me
[50:26] to the median ites into your hands lest
[50:29] Israel vaun themselves against me saying
[50:32] my hand had saved me so he don't even
[50:34] want to take the glory he don't want to
[50:37] say well because I train and I'm a
[50:39] mercenary and God show me this is his
[50:42] provided way he don't even want you take
[50:44] the glory he says listen in verse three
[50:48] now therefore go to proclaim the ears of
[50:51] the people saying whosoever is fearful
[50:55] and Afraid
[50:57] let him return and depart early from
[51:00] Mount G gilled and there return the
[51:04] people 20 and 2,000 and there remain
[51:07] 10,000 so what does that say 2/3 of them
[51:10] went back filtered out because they
[51:13] afraid he said listen if you're even
[51:15] afraid if you have doubt if you're not
[51:19] sure there's not a battle for you take
[51:22] it at home not not not reality
[51:26] amen that's just the way he is he not
[51:29] into the fearful frighting and I don't
[51:32] know you know I seen Goliad there and
[51:34] depending on the angle but I'm not sure
[51:35] if you could take him today and know
[51:37] perhaps when it get dark no no no no no
[51:41] when David saw him he said listen who is
[51:43] this
[51:44] uncircumcised Philistine challenging the
[51:47] army of the Lord amen bold Brave without
[51:51] fear so he could be used by God to
[51:54] accomplish his promise amen
[51:59] my
[52:00] Lord there there's a message brother
[52:02] Brandon preached the way to have
[52:05] fellowship and in this
[52:07] message paragraph 26 he says that's the
[52:11] trouble with man tonight that's what's
[52:13] the trouble with people tonight you're
[52:15] scared that's the biggest curse there is
[52:18] on Full Gospel people or any other
[52:20] people it's because they are afraid God
[52:23] has made the provision but you're afraid
[52:25] to take his his word for it so the
[52:28] promise is there but you don't have
[52:30] enough faith it wasn't mixed with faith
[52:33] so you could go and possess the land
[52:36] yeah you kind of I kind of I remember he
[52:38] say that to know but I'm not
[52:42] sure he says if you wasn't afraid
[52:46] tonight you would take your healing by
[52:49] faith and know that God promise it and
[52:51] the thing would just go Plum away from
[52:54] you afraid scared of notice it that's
[52:57] the reason I'm such a believer in
[52:58] healing I know that if you can't get
[53:01] away from that scare and get love in its
[53:03] place something's going to happen
[53:05] there's only two faculties that govern a
[53:08] human and one of them is
[53:10] Faith which brings results and the other
[53:12] is fair which has no value in it at all
[53:16] Fai is of god fear is of the devil fear
[53:19] makes you wear Fair makes you wonder and
[53:23] if I was going to die in the morning
[53:25] what good would it do to me to get all
[53:27] stewed up about it what if I was going
[53:29] to be electrocuted in the morning and my
[53:32] life had to end in the morning tomorrow
[53:34] morning what good would it do for me to
[53:37] worry about it well you say what good
[53:39] would it do to have faith faith can sign
[53:42] my pardon sure there's a value in faith
[53:47] don't be weary don't be scared don't be
[53:51] upset just have faith and believe and
[53:54] the only way you can have faith you have
[53:57] to have love
[53:58] first for love produces faith for
[54:02] perfect love get it perfect love casts
[54:06] out all fear wish I had time to tell you
[54:09] the experience of Wildlife and and he
[54:11] went on to to tell the story of the
[54:14] bullu amen I just kind of skipped down a
[54:17] little bit and he says you know this
[54:19] bull had killed a CED man on a farm and
[54:21] and in in paragraph 28 he said and then
[54:24] when I started across the field right in
[54:26] a big open field not over about 30 yards
[54:29] from me this big fellow raised up and
[54:30] threw his horns down let out a big
[54:32] Bellow if you know what I'm talking
[54:34] about that killer bull was ready was
[54:37] ready and waiting was all primed up you
[54:40] know what he said he said it scared me
[54:42] at first at first it scared me this is
[54:45] brother Brandon right jumping the fence
[54:48] and going and he said the bull scared
[54:52] him he said I looked for a tree and
[54:54] there wasn't any tree I knew he could
[54:57] outrun me to Def fence so I thought well
[55:00] this is it so then something happened
[55:03] hallelujah oh God if that would only
[55:06] stay there instead of going away
[55:08] something happened I wish God would let
[55:11] it happen to everybody here tonight
[55:13] under the sound of my voice just long
[55:16] enough to get healed see something
[55:19] happened that I wasn't scared of the
[55:21] bull I felt sorry because I Disturbed
[55:24] him I was in his feet
[55:26] he was laying out there not bothering me
[55:29] I came along and woke him up and so I
[55:32] felt sorry for him now you can't Bluff
[55:34] itff it it has to be there that's the
[55:38] way faith is you can't Bluff you got to
[55:41] really have it it's an action thing you
[55:44] got to see it in motion you can't
[55:46] pretend and make it up you really have
[55:48] to have it the devil will know it and
[55:52] this fellow started to Ward me with his
[55:54] head down just as hard as he could
[55:57] I wasn't no more
[55:59] afraid that that's the prophet's words I
[56:02] wasn't no more afraid of that bull then
[56:05] I would be of my dear brother and sister
[56:08] standing on this platform and he run
[56:10] within about 5T of me and he stopped he
[56:14] looked at me so depleted he looked right
[56:17] and left I said fellow I'm sorry I
[56:20] Disturbed you I said now you're God's
[56:23] creature and I'm God's servant now the
[56:26] Creator that made you made me and I'm
[56:29] his servant I'm on my journey across the
[56:32] hill to pray for one of his sick
[56:34] children if I know you'd been laying
[56:37] there I wouldn't have come by and
[56:38] Disturbed you so now in the name of
[56:41] Jesus Christ the Creator go back and lay
[56:44] down this is the boldness this is the I
[56:48] mean this is the confidence of which I
[56:50] speak this is what God is
[56:53] seeking you say at the judgment bar you
[56:56] see it BR brought into light that bull
[56:59] looked at me for a few minutes turned
[57:01] around walked over and laid down and as
[57:05] I stood there the tears running down my
[57:08] cheeks I walked within 5T of that bull
[57:10] and he never even turned his head and
[57:13] looked at me why instead of hating him I
[57:17] loved him Love Will Conquer anything
[57:20] right that's what conquered my heart
[57:22] when I know that God so loved me that he
[57:24] gave his only begotten son that I
[57:27] wouldn't have to perish know that I was
[57:29] born in this world a sinner and I was
[57:32] perishing and God loved me that he give
[57:34] his son for my life to be redeemed amen
[57:37] you believe that tonight I couldn't hate
[57:40] no more I had to love that's what brings
[57:43] the result you see it's
[57:46] love you see that that that assurance
[57:49] that Assurance is what in Psalm 27 David
[57:53] said in verse one he said the Lord is my
[57:55] light and my
[57:56] salvation he wasn't writing poetry he
[57:59] wasn't making it up because it song good
[58:01] and it rhyming this was his testimony
[58:05] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[58:07] Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the
[58:10] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[58:13] afraid when the weak the wicked even my
[58:16] enemies and my foes came up upon me to
[58:19] eat of My Flesh they stumble and fell
[58:23] though an host should encamp against me
[58:25] my heart heart shall not fear this's the
[58:27] same guy God said is a man after my own
[58:30] heart a man that's bold that can cast
[58:33] Fair aside and trust in God he say in
[58:36] this will I be confident verse four one
[58:39] thing have I desired of the Lord that
[58:42] will I seek after that I may dwell in
[58:43] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[58:45] life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[58:47] and to inquire in his Temple and I said
[58:50] he leaves a provision when you have no
[58:53] fear there's a provision or a hedge
[58:55] protect you in verse 5 it says for in
[58:58] the time of trouble he shall hide me in
[59:01] his Pavilion it didn't say trouble
[59:04] wouldn't come but in the time of trouble
[59:07] he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the
[59:10] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[59:13] me he shall set me up upon a rock and in
[59:17] verse six he says and now shall my head
[59:19] be lifted up above my enemies round
[59:22] about me therefore I will offer in his
[59:25] Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing
[59:29] yeah I will sing praises unto the Lord
[59:32] you see why we praise and why we worship
[59:35] he sent
[59:37] ambushments to protect
[59:42] you I I had Psalms 121 and brother
[59:45] Anthony read it tonight amen so I want
[59:48] to switch over quickly to
[59:50] Elijah and and it's interesting as we
[59:53] know the scripture that God says he
[59:56] commanded a widow woman to sustain him
[1:00:00] amen yet when Elijah said bake me a cake
[1:00:04] first as we say she gave excuses now God
[1:00:09] commanded her amen and she gave excuses
[1:00:12] but listen listen in First Kings chapter
[1:00:15] 17 and verse 8 and the word of the Lord
[1:00:18] came unto him saying
[1:00:20] arise get thee to zerath which belongs
[1:00:23] to zidon and dwell there behold I have
[1:00:26] commanded a widow woman there to sustain
[1:00:29] thee which is to keep thee that's not to
[1:00:31] feed you that's to ensure that you're
[1:00:33] okay that's what sustenance
[1:00:36] is in verse 10 so he arose and went to
[1:00:39] zarapas and when he came to the gates of
[1:00:41] the city Behold a widow woman was there
[1:00:44] Gathering of sticks and he called to her
[1:00:46] he said fetch me I pray thee a little
[1:00:49] water in a vessel that I may
[1:00:52] drink and and as as we say while you're
[1:00:56] doing that as you're there bring and in
[1:01:00] in in in in verse 11 he says and as she
[1:01:03] was going to fetch it he called to her
[1:01:06] and said bring me I pray thee a muscle
[1:01:08] of bread in thy hand so in so far as
[1:01:11] you're bringing the the water bring the
[1:01:13] morle one
[1:01:15] time in verse 12 and she said as the
[1:01:18] Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake
[1:01:22] but an handful of meal in a barrel and a
[1:01:24] little oil in a crew CR and behold I am
[1:01:27] Gathering two sticks that I may go in
[1:01:29] and dress it for me and my son that we
[1:01:31] may eat it and die and Elijah said unto
[1:01:34] her watch his words fear
[1:01:37] not go and do as thou said so be Not
[1:01:42] Afraid don't doubt have faith and
[1:01:46] continue doing what you said you're
[1:01:48] going to do amen but make me therefore
[1:01:52] thereof a little cake first and bring it
[1:01:55] on to me and after make for thee and for
[1:01:59] thy
[1:02:00] son in verse 14 this is the provision
[1:02:03] now for thus said the Lord God of Israel
[1:02:07] the barrel of meal shall not waste
[1:02:09] neither shall the cruise of oil fail
[1:02:12] until the day of the that the Lord
[1:02:15] sendeth rain upon the Earth amen so time
[1:02:19] after time in verse 15 and she went and
[1:02:22] did according to the saying of Elijah
[1:02:24] and she and he and house did eat many
[1:02:27] days and the barrel of meal wasted not
[1:02:30] neither did the cruise of oil fail
[1:02:32] according to the word of the Lord which
[1:02:34] he spake by Elijah we seeing time and
[1:02:37] time again if you could
[1:02:40] observe what God has promised and have
[1:02:44] enough faith and cast out Doubt cast out
[1:02:48] fear be bold and courageous and apply
[1:02:51] the word of God to your life nothing
[1:02:54] could stand before you all the days of
[1:02:56] your life he is more than able to
[1:02:59] sustain you to bring you through to
[1:03:02] bring you out
[1:03:05] amen now at times we we we wonder and we
[1:03:08] we try to figure things out and we
[1:03:10] wonder why this had to happen this way
[1:03:12] and we can't explain and it was
[1:03:14] interesting in a message Be Be not
[1:03:16] Afraid brother Brandon was talking about
[1:03:19] about Lazar
[1:03:22] us and one of the things he said in that
[1:03:25] that message Be not
[1:03:27] Afraid paragraph 21 you say now you say
[1:03:30] that's not scriptural brother brandom
[1:03:32] yes it is now wait a minute Jesus was
[1:03:34] living with Martha and Mary and
[1:03:37] Lazarus he's living around them you knew
[1:03:40] each other well they were good friends
[1:03:43] you remember that and the father said to
[1:03:46] his son I want to use you believe God
[1:03:49] was in Christ certainly he
[1:03:52] was all right father wants to use his
[1:03:55] gift on Earth nobody wants to volunteer
[1:03:58] to get sick nobody want to volunteer to
[1:04:01] die but there are times when God has to
[1:04:03] do things to manifest his power and his
[1:04:06] ability on Earth for us to see you say
[1:04:09] he want to use his gift on Earth so he
[1:04:11] tells Jesus go away from the home
[1:04:13] because and this is a private discussion
[1:04:15] between God and Jesus now go away from
[1:04:17] the home because Lazarus is going to die
[1:04:19] so Jesus knew that before he says be
[1:04:22] gone for 4 days after 4 days he'll be
[1:04:25] dead dead Lazarus will be dead then you
[1:04:29] return so these are the instructions so
[1:04:31] we getting a glimpse behind the scenes
[1:04:33] here he say after four days he'll be
[1:04:36] dead then you return and go back and
[1:04:38] raise him from the
[1:04:39] dead that never said said no virtue left
[1:04:43] that went on over in four days they sent
[1:04:46] to him come pray for Lazarus he's dying
[1:04:48] he just kept on going sent another
[1:04:50] messenger come pray for Lazarus the one
[1:04:52] you love he's dying
[1:04:55] just kept going then after another time
[1:04:58] he said Lazarus sleepeth
[1:05:02] oh he said if he sleep he does well he
[1:05:06] said he's dead and for for your sake I'm
[1:05:09] glad I wasn't there because they've been
[1:05:12] trying to get him to do something that
[1:05:14] was against the will of God so the
[1:05:17] prophet is saying had he come back early
[1:05:19] he would have interrupted the will of
[1:05:22] God for lazarus's life so it had to
[1:05:24] happen this way had Lazarus not died the
[1:05:27] scripture wouldn't be the way it is
[1:05:28] today amen so you don't have to figure
[1:05:31] it out yourself you don't have to wonder
[1:05:34] once God is in it he's got it under
[1:05:37] control he'll never leave you nor
[1:05:39] forsake you he knows the end before the
[1:05:41] beginning so we just need to trust and
[1:05:44] Obey and have faith in his unfailing
[1:05:46] undying word that he who Creator the
[1:05:50] promise is able to fulfill it with or
[1:05:53] without you he don't need your your
[1:05:55] opinion he don't need your your your
[1:05:58] your insertion your
[1:06:02] advice switching quickly along
[1:06:05] here in a message then Jesus came and
[1:06:09] called This is referring to to Peter
[1:06:13] walking on the water after the miracle
[1:06:15] of the Five Loaves and two fish so
[1:06:17] imagine coming off of this High figuring
[1:06:20] out that we had so much left over it was
[1:06:23] a miracle they're excited
[1:06:26] Jesus left them and he went to pray and
[1:06:28] he told them go ahead go on a boat relax
[1:06:30] take it easy and the Bible said the
[1:06:33] winds were
[1:06:35] contrary so they were on the Water by
[1:06:38] themselves and Jesus is praying just to
[1:06:40] paint a picture for you and at that time
[1:06:43] paragraph 157 he says one time the
[1:06:45] disciples were out on the boats all
[1:06:47] hopes were gone the storms they went
[1:06:50] away without Jesus and the storms was
[1:06:52] just just like it was at Lazarus house
[1:06:54] all hope was gone
[1:06:56] the little old boat had water logged and
[1:06:58] this is this is the dramatization here
[1:07:01] now the little boat had water log and
[1:07:03] there was screaming and crying and maybe
[1:07:05] praying going on and lightning flashing
[1:07:08] and the boat filled up with water and
[1:07:09] mass poles dropped down the OES broke
[1:07:12] and they were holding one another crying
[1:07:14] and in the real darkness of hour then
[1:07:17] Jesus came walking along but he looked
[1:07:19] like a shadow to them he looked scary
[1:07:22] like a spirit and they cried out with
[1:07:24] fear that's what the m today Jesus comes
[1:07:27] in the hour of your dark hour just when
[1:07:29] it looks bleak just when it seems like
[1:07:32] nothing is going to work out just when
[1:07:34] it seems like at the end of your rope
[1:07:37] that's when he comes walking it may seem
[1:07:39] scary but that's when he shows up strong
[1:07:43] in your life that's when he shows up big
[1:07:45] in your scenario that's when he shows
[1:07:48] himself strong in the darkest hour he
[1:07:52] said you don't know what it is he said
[1:07:54] he comes the hour of your dark hour and
[1:07:57] you're afraid of it you don't know what
[1:07:59] it is they didn't know what he was they
[1:08:01] said oh it's a spirit they were
[1:08:04] screaming then he called them fear not
[1:08:08] it is I so put away all that doubt all
[1:08:12] that depression all that frustration
[1:08:14] about what happened into the boat
[1:08:16] because I am on the scene now and once I
[1:08:18] am on the scene all I want is you to
[1:08:21] have faith I want you to believe that I
[1:08:24] could calm this St in your life I want
[1:08:26] you to believe that everything is going
[1:08:28] to be all right that's the provision
[1:08:30] I've brought with my instruction and my
[1:08:32] command he said it is I in the darkness
[1:08:35] of our Jesus come along their help
[1:08:38] that's the way he always does comes in
[1:08:41] the darkness of our then Jesus came and
[1:08:43] manifested himself and come to them
[1:08:46] Peter said if it be you bid me come on
[1:08:49] the water this is the the show of Faith
[1:08:52] now this is the display of Faith now he
[1:08:54] said come on
[1:08:56] Jesus said come on you know what friends
[1:08:59] soon he will say you say soon he will
[1:09:03] come for those in this last days now
[1:09:05] isn't it strange that the church has
[1:09:07] gotten this Dark Hour again I'm going to
[1:09:10] say something here it's not a Doctrine
[1:09:12] I'm just prophesying you know what's
[1:09:15] happened it's going to come to a place
[1:09:17] soon mark my word this is a prophet's
[1:09:19] word now he said that all denominations
[1:09:21] are going to have to join The ecumenical
[1:09:23] council if they don't they can't have
[1:09:26] the support of the council therefore
[1:09:28] there'll be a boycott and nobody can go
[1:09:31] to these churches or go to any churches
[1:09:33] unless you have a mark from your own
[1:09:35] church you cannot buy or sell you see it
[1:09:39] just as it was so it's going to be again
[1:09:42] a mark unto the Beast and the church
[1:09:44] they're realizing that spiritual people
[1:09:47] and you Pentecostal people anyhow are
[1:09:50] recognizing it you begin to feel it when
[1:09:53] your churches many of the organization
[1:09:55] of the Pentecostal and I don't have to
[1:09:57] call your names but you know right now
[1:09:59] they are they are coming into it they've
[1:10:02] done wites what they were and when you
[1:10:04] do that what you're going to have to do
[1:10:07] you're going to have to forfeit your
[1:10:08] Evangelical teaching of the baptism of
[1:10:10] the Holy Ghost you're going to have to
[1:10:12] forfeit your doctrine of the Bible and
[1:10:14] the members is not going to stand for it
[1:10:17] real Born Again Christians will die
[1:10:19] first they are warned by the word they
[1:10:22] know this thing is coming yes sir and is
[1:10:25] isn't it strange and right in this
[1:10:27] darkest hour then Jesus comes along and
[1:10:30] calls us said don't get scared it's me
[1:10:34] I'm still with you I'm here to manifest
[1:10:37] my word as he was then so he is now he
[1:10:40] said he would do it oh my the master has
[1:10:43] come and has called for us many sick
[1:10:46] people here no doubt they're sitting
[1:10:47] here and the doctor has told you there's
[1:10:49] no hope for you you may be in your
[1:10:51] darkest hour and whatever the scenario
[1:10:53] is you may be in your darkest hour
[1:10:55] tonight but remember the master has come
[1:10:58] and called for you and someday someday
[1:11:01] someday the master is going to come and
[1:11:03] call for every name that's wrote on the
[1:11:05] Lamb's Book of Life if yours are not
[1:11:08] there get it on there now for he's going
[1:11:10] to come and call even those that are in
[1:11:13] the grave shall hear his voice and come
[1:11:15] forth to life the master will come and
[1:11:18] call for you and while he's calling
[1:11:20] today answer and make preparations for
[1:11:23] that day is my advice to you the the
[1:11:25] promise of this age he promised he would
[1:11:27] be here the thing that he did he' do
[1:11:30] again and now again the master has come
[1:11:32] to call for you
[1:11:37] Amen in a message
[1:11:40] love and we're almost getting ready to
[1:11:43] close paragraph 33 he
[1:11:46] said Peter said repent every one of you
[1:11:49] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:11:51] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:11:53] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:11:55] ho ghost and he said the promises unto
[1:11:57] you and your children and to them that
[1:12:00] are far off even as many as a lord Our
[1:12:03] God shall call amen that means me that
[1:12:07] settles it all anything God said you
[1:12:10] love him so much you believe it this is
[1:12:12] a message of Faith tonight when he says
[1:12:15] fear not he's saying do depend on your
[1:12:18] human faculties do depend on your five
[1:12:20] senses do depend on how it seems and how
[1:12:23] it feels and how it looks
[1:12:25] right he said to think that perfect love
[1:12:29] casts out all fear you're not scared
[1:12:32] about nothing you're just resting you're
[1:12:34] not oh I my backslides tomorrow I a
[1:12:37] backslide next week you're not
[1:12:38] wishy-washy he say I won't worry about
[1:12:40] that I'm not trying to hold on he held
[1:12:43] on for me he put a love in my heart that
[1:12:46] holds there it's him holding me not me
[1:12:49] holding him if it was me holding him
[1:12:52] I'll probably turn loose but as long as
[1:12:54] he's holding me he will never turn loose
[1:12:57] he promised he wouldn't I'll never leave
[1:12:59] thee nor forsake thee amen oh he that
[1:13:02] Hearth my words and Believe on him he
[1:13:05] that said me has everlasting life and
[1:13:07] shall not come into condemnation but
[1:13:09] pass from death into life the musicians
[1:13:12] could get
[1:13:18] ready there's one more thing I want to I
[1:13:21] want to strike which is from a message
[1:13:23] beyond the curtain of time
[1:13:26] and this is a a vision that brother
[1:13:29] Branham asked brother Neville to
[1:13:32] read in that message beyond the curing
[1:13:35] of
[1:13:36] time
[1:13:38] 61 and this is paragraph
[1:13:41] 41 you know and this is where the angel
[1:13:45] asked him in in a vision if he wants to
[1:13:48] be able to pay beyond the curtain of
[1:13:50] time and the voice asked would you like
[1:13:52] to see what's just beyond there and I
[1:13:55] answered it will help me so
[1:13:57] much what happened I cannot say whether
[1:14:00] I was in the body or not or whether it
[1:14:02] was translation I do not know but it was
[1:14:04] unlike any Vision I have ever had I
[1:14:08] could see the place to which I was taken
[1:14:10] and I could see myself lying back there
[1:14:13] upon my bed I said this is a strange
[1:14:16] thing there were great numbers of people
[1:14:19] and they came running greeting me crying
[1:14:21] oh our precious brother first came young
[1:14:24] woman a apparently in their early 20s
[1:14:27] and as they would embrace me they said
[1:14:28] oh precious brother young men in the
[1:14:31] Brilliance of their Young Manhood with
[1:14:33] eyes glistening like stars in a dark
[1:14:35] night with teeth as white as pears
[1:14:37] embrac me saying our precious brother
[1:14:40] then I noticed that I too had become
[1:14:42] young again I looked at myself there and
[1:14:44] turned and looked back at my old body
[1:14:46] lying on the bed with my hands behind my
[1:14:48] head I said I don't understand this you
[1:14:51] could play drw me
[1:14:53] arrow and then the voice spoke to me
[1:14:56] this is what you preach that the Holy
[1:14:57] Ghost is this is perfect love nothing
[1:15:02] can enter here without
[1:15:04] it suddenly I was back on the bed again
[1:15:07] I said oh God help me never let me
[1:15:10] compromise with the word let me stay
[1:15:13] straight on the word I don't care what
[1:15:15] anybody else does Lord let me press to
[1:15:18] that beautiful joyful place I'm more
[1:15:21] convinced than ever in my life that it
[1:15:23] will take perfect love to enter that
[1:15:26] place there was no jealousy no tiredness
[1:15:29] no sickness no old age no death only
