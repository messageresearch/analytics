[42:39] this eulogy was prepared by myself and
[42:41] his polar brother joel
[42:45] who resides in england
[42:48] it is so unfortunate

[42:53] present
[42:55] namely on kukuti aunty linda aunty becky
[42:59] and his brother joel
[43:01] due to the challenges and restrictions

[43:09] to
[43:10] other family members and friends
[43:14] jason was born on september 27
[43:17] 1980
[43:19] at portland spring general hospital
[43:24] he was born to the parents of sandra
[43:26] disease and doug nader
[43:29] his given name
[43:31] was jason subash
[43:34] andrew
[43:37] jason spent infancy and part of his
[43:40] early childhood years
[43:42] at number 24 lower symbols hill belmont
[43:45] porter spin
[43:47] together with his mother
[43:49] ella brother joelle
[43:51] grandparents
[43:53] monica and carlton dillion
[43:55] bodhisees
[43:57] aunties angela rebecca
[44:00] uncles kurtie and gerald
[44:04] during this time
[44:06] jason's early spiritual journey began
[44:09] where he and joel would accompany their
[44:12] grandmother
[44:13] mother and aunties
[44:15] to fellowship at berlintown street
[44:18] located on frederick street border spin
[44:22] i too would accompany them sometime
[44:25] thereafter
[44:30] on some mornings
[44:31] is uncle cootie often would stroll along
[44:35] patreon strips
[44:37] to drop off jason and joel for school
[44:41] jason was always a spritey lad and light
[44:44] on his feet
[44:46] always trying to skip over the flight of
[44:48] four stairs
[44:49] as he walked but couldn't
[44:53] one morning whilst walking along the set
[44:55] steps
[44:56] a neighbor's dog began barking at jason
[45:00] he got scared and quickly ran off
[45:03] jumping over the flight of four steps
[45:06] and there is somersault in the process
[45:08] landing on his feet
[45:11] he looked at uncle coty and started
[45:14] laughing
[45:15] as uncle kurti relates
[45:18] at nine years old jason did that example
[45:21] 91 to talk to me in roshani gandhi with
[45:23] his parents
[45:25] and other siblings
[45:27] his spiritual journey continued as our
[45:30] family began to fellowship with brother
[45:31] o'bid at cinema sani grande
[45:35] jason finished his primary schooling
[45:37] at sunny granny hindu school
[45:39] [Music]
[45:40] and passed for arima government
[45:43] secondary
[45:44] school as brothers we always look
[45:47] forward for weekends
[45:49] and all school vacations
[45:52] to visit our family in belmont
[45:56] because of the bond and love we shared
[46:02] we often pick oranges lemons grapefruit
[46:04] and portugal's with our dad from his
[46:06] estate
[46:08] and carried it to belmond
[46:11] jason and i would walk around with two
[46:13] market bags containing citrus
[46:16] selling to our friends and neighbors
[46:19] this was all jason's idea
[46:22] and we supported him
[46:24] eventually we had a little stall on a
[46:28] belmont circular road full of citrus
[46:30] fruits
[46:31] and it was very successful
[46:35] one of the favorite sports in belmont at
[46:37] the time was football
[46:40] the three young boys and other children
[46:43] our age
[46:44] we were the bald boys watching our
[46:47] uncles play football
[46:49] on the hill
[46:50] waiting for the ball to come our way
[46:53] we also enjoy playing cricket panhoop
[46:57] and even driving scooters down the hill
[47:00] with our auntie becky and uncle kirti
[47:04] i clearly remember one day
[47:07] rain began falling on the hills
[47:10] and jesus and i started playing in the
[47:12] rain
[47:14] jason sat down in a canal
[47:17] and the water pushed him straight down
[47:18] the hill
[47:20] i tried it after
[47:23] we did it a few times
[47:25] when jason turner wrong
[47:27] his short pants were top was torn apart
[47:30] exposing his cheeks
[47:33] mother dealt with us accordingly
[47:39] jason loved sports at an early age as we
[47:41] could
[47:42] often as we would often go with uncle
[47:45] cody to the queen's back savannah
[47:47] to play football with our cousins and
[47:49] friends
[47:51] jason also acquired his healthy appetite
[47:53] as he enjoyed
[47:56] besides mummy cooking his grandmother
[47:58] and auntie angela roti and good
[48:01] or his grandfather barbecue
[48:04] at our regular family gatherings
[48:08] jason graduated from arima government
[48:10] secondary school
[48:12] with a full certificate
[48:17] i remember at times when we had our
[48:19] choice to do at home
[48:22] jason
[48:23] always would be studying
[48:25] so mummy wouldn't
[48:28] ask him to do any chores
[48:31] he was always a studious person at a
[48:33] young age
[48:39] after secondary school jason began
[48:41] working at family's supermarket now for
[48:43] extra foods
[48:45] he was never a person to stay home and
[48:47] sit back
[48:50] whilst in his late 13 years he went to
[48:52] roy tech and continued to work at the
[48:54] supermarket
[48:56] jason began working in the ministry of
[48:58] oaks as a clerk in stanley granby
[49:01] he still maintained his passion for
[49:02] sports
[49:03] especially football
[49:06] as his favorite footballer was
[49:08] roberto boujou badgio sorry
[49:15] at age 23
[49:17] jason began his career in the public
[49:19] service
[49:21] and worked at nine
[49:23] district courts throughout trinidad
[49:25] and tobago as well
[49:28] jason continued to work part-time at
[49:30] extra foods
[49:31] supermarket
[49:33] jason continued to strive and succeed in
[49:36] all aspects in his life
[49:39] he was the wife the live wire in our
[49:41] family gathering
[49:43] with a great sense of humor making funny
[49:46] faces
[49:47] and the energy that he brought
[49:56] as brothers growing up
[50:10] as brothers growing up we had our
[50:12] struggles and hardships
[50:14] faced many challenges emotionally
[50:17] psychologically and financially
[50:20] throughout the years
[50:22] this only made us stronger as we grew
[50:26] with the love and support from our
[50:27] family
[50:29] and the ever-fighting spirit
[50:31] and love from our mum
[50:33] kept our boys intact
[50:36] there is no question about the fact
[50:38] that the love and bond we shared as a
[50:41] family
[50:42] was instrumental
[50:44] in carving
[50:45] all the character of jason
[50:48] for who he was
[50:53] jason started traveling in his mid-20s
[50:56] visiting several caribbean islands
[50:58] united states and uk united states of
[51:01] america
[51:02] uk and canada
[51:07] json trip to canada was based on a
[51:09] promise and soon endured several
[51:10] hardships
[51:14] when auntie angela
[51:17] found out about this she engaged other
[51:19] close friends and family living abroad
[51:22] and they reach out
[51:23] extending the same gratitude
[51:26] as if
[51:28] was her
[51:31] as jason journey throughout his life
[51:34] continued

[52:56] and kicked on and we both flew back on
[52:57] our seats

[53:27] large garbage bags of toys
[53:29] which took up the entire living room and
[53:31] dining room area
[53:34] and i would sometimes help sort them out
[53:38] he would try and hide from his nieces
[53:40] and nephew but one night
[53:42] his eldest niece woke up and saw him

[53:47] she was amazed and surprised
[53:50] his response was
[53:52] i am santa's helpers i am santa's helper

[54:00] his love for children was unquestionable
[54:02] as for to his nieces and
[54:05] nephew
[54:07] as he played an active role in their
[54:09] lives he will always minister to them
[54:10] about

[55:05] after which short tragedies dropped
[55:09] and only a month after
[55:12] his son
[55:14] had passed away
[55:16] this drove jason into deep grief and
[55:20] sorrow
[55:21] as he always wanted his son
[55:24] a year after
[55:27] tragedy struck again
[55:30] our mother passed away after battling
[55:32] cancer

[55:37] from the first
[55:39] tragedy jesus yet had another on his
[55:42] plate
[55:44] jason faith and desire
[55:46] the surfboard grew stronger
[55:49] as he interceded for his family
[56:00] as time went by jason and his wife
[56:03] traveled to europe
[56:05] the usa and some of the caribbean
[56:07] islands

[56:17] and in 2020 gave birth to jesus son
[56:21] mission
[56:24] his level of happiness rose to
[56:27] a static
[56:28] when he got his son
[56:31] misha aka shaki
[56:34] was his pride and joy
[56:35] [Music]
[56:37] on some saturdays jesus would bring

[56:43] when crystal

[57:15] unwell
[57:17] and in abundance of portion
[57:20] he will not come over
[57:23] he still pass and stop on the roadway
[57:26] for a short period
[57:29] to say hello
[57:34] when i learned about jason

[57:41] to drop off medication and some supplies
[57:45] tuesday december december was the last
[57:47] day i saw my brother
[57:51] the center of his eyes was jet black
[57:54] with no sense of direction or focus
[57:57] the stair was hollow inside
[57:59] he looked in my direction
[58:01] [Music]
[58:02] and didn't blink
[58:04] as he sat in a chair
[58:07] as if he was in a gaze
[58:10] this look reminded me
[58:14] of the night i last saw my mother alive
[58:16] tears came to my eyes
[58:19] as i doubted myself

[1:03:33] packing and we want jason and austin to
[1:03:35] take their groceries
[1:03:37] because we had fun serving people
[1:03:40] jason had a lot of
[1:03:41] love in his heart for people and he go
[1:03:44] all the extra miles so on our journey
[1:03:47] he would have
[1:03:48] branched off in into doing different
[1:03:50] things
[1:03:51] and i would have seen him one at one
[1:03:53] time
[1:03:55] we taken his mother's car to drive
[1:03:59] and go all over
[1:04:01] the other time we we were
[1:04:03] doing all sorts of things together but
[1:04:05] he always had my back and i always had
[1:04:07] his back
[1:04:08] we we had a journey where we were boys
[1:04:11] at one time and the general
[1:04:14] wanted me to script after us we became
[1:04:16] men we didn't know when that happened
[1:04:18] but we became men
[1:04:21] my first date jesus was the
[1:04:24] it was not out of my back and the same
[1:04:26] thing for him as well
[1:04:28] there were three times in jason's life
[1:04:30] where he was extremely happy
[1:04:34] the first time
[1:04:35] was when he met crystal and he told me
[1:04:38] he was getting married and he went to
[1:04:39] wrap things up with crystal and he was
[1:04:41] real happy with crystal
[1:04:43] the second time is when he married
[1:04:44] crystal
[1:04:46] the third time
[1:04:48] was when he had his first baby
[1:04:52] only time after that was when mishap was
[1:04:54] born
[1:04:56] in a true jason life
[1:04:58] all he wanted was to be happy and to be
[1:05:00] a father
[1:05:02] and to really
[1:05:04] add back to society
[1:05:09] jason was a giver
[1:05:11] jason used to become the santa claus at
[1:05:14] extra foods
[1:05:15] and
[1:05:17] i had one time where
[1:05:19] we would have um
[1:05:20] someone would have come to us and told
[1:05:21] us that they don't have a santa claus
[1:05:23] and they have a children's home
[1:05:25] that they want to um they want to give a
[1:05:27] few toys to
[1:05:30] and they asked if you could have used
[1:05:31] the actual food santa claus and i said
[1:05:32] well no problem you go wrong at that
[1:05:34] time i had a crv and i had like a
[1:05:36] sunroof
[1:05:37] and jason with us going to the sunroof
[1:05:41] pop his head out and say ho ho ho merry
[1:05:44] christmas merry christmas to all the
[1:05:46] boys angels and sometimes all each other
[1:05:48] and run along the van because a lot of
[1:05:49] toys is santa claus
[1:05:51] but in that home it had one little girl
[1:05:54] who didn't believe in santa claus for
[1:05:55] whatever case
[1:05:57] but that year jason would have practiced
[1:06:01] magic magic tricks
[1:06:03] and
[1:06:05] that year
[1:06:07] that little child who didn't believe in
[1:06:09] santa claus and didn't really wasn't
[1:06:11] coming towards santa claus because she
[1:06:12] was afraid oh she didn't believe in
[1:06:13] santa claus
[1:06:15] jason did a trick
[1:06:17] and pull out coins out the nose or
[1:06:19] something like that and then she said no
[1:06:20] no no that's really santa claus it's
[1:06:22] really santa claus and she was so amazed
[1:06:24] she was so amazed at all the time she
[1:06:26] was afraid to hug him up and all of that
[1:06:29] i don't believe i have a pet yeah i'll
[1:06:31] post it a bit later on facebook
[1:06:33] where that child hugged jesus
[1:06:37] hug jason as if jason was her father
[1:06:42] you know he had a heart of gold
[1:06:45] he would have done anything for anyone
[1:06:48] and it didn't have to be a millionaire
[1:06:50] for jason to do anything for you
[1:06:53] he was a man on the ground
[1:06:55] and just as jason was a man on the
[1:06:57] ground we must remember to always keep
[1:07:00] our feet on the ground and to serve each
[1:07:03] other and to love each other and take
[1:07:05] care of each other
[1:07:06] because this covered 19
[1:07:10] virus
[1:07:12] have shown us that
[1:07:13] although we need to be a part
[1:07:16] we still need to hold on to one another
[1:07:18] and encourage each other
[1:07:21] life is
[1:07:22] short
[1:07:24] but in times ideas we need to come
[1:07:26] together
[1:07:27] and spread the love of christ and spread
[1:07:30] the christ like love that jason would
[1:07:32] have had
[1:07:33] to all of us
[1:07:35] and we cannot let his light
[1:07:37] burn out today
[1:07:39] because our journey have not yet
[1:07:41] attended
[1:07:43] our journey
[1:07:44] is still
[1:07:46] written
[1:07:48] based on what god wants
[1:07:51] and for everybody inside there right now
[1:07:53] what jason would want today
[1:07:55] is that we keep his legacy going
[1:07:57] we keep what we have started going i
[1:08:00] don't allow it to end
[1:08:03] you have me shot there and we need to
[1:08:05] look after me shot as well too
[1:08:07] i already told crystal that mishak is my
[1:08:10] son too
[1:08:12] he cannot be a best friend and and
[1:08:14] having
[1:08:16] his son here and i i can't visit his son
[1:08:19] check and make sure he's okay
[1:08:23] friends family members
[1:08:26] all of us have a responsibility
[1:08:29] all of us need to
[1:08:31] come together
[1:08:32] and make things happen
[1:08:34] and spread christ like love throughout

[1:08:39] wonderful evening

[1:08:55] believe it is a true reflection
[1:08:57] of jason rajkumar here and his life that
[1:09:00] he has shared with us and we are so
[1:09:02] honored and privileged
[1:09:03] to celebrate and be a part of this
[1:09:05] afternoon

[1:31:50] you can't explain
[1:31:51] when things happen when you
[1:31:53] wasn't expecting that it just happened
[1:31:57] things
[1:31:58] just happen sometimes
[1:32:00] but job was amazing and it reminded me
[1:32:02] something
[1:32:04] jason ann said
[1:32:05] in the zoo meeting we had and a tribute
[1:32:07] to him she talked about when the baby
[1:32:09] was being buried
[1:32:11] and it was covered up
[1:32:13] that
[1:32:13] jason fell face down on the ground and
[1:32:16] bowled hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:32:18] he didn't say why
[1:32:20] he didn't say how
[1:32:21] he didn't question god he just bald
[1:32:24] hallelujah
[1:32:25] and i know
[1:32:26] that
[1:32:27] all is well with jason and with his son
[1:32:31] by god's grace
[1:32:33] now
[1:32:34] naked came into this world
[1:32:37] and where you are going
[1:32:39] you can't take anything of this world
[1:32:41] with you
[1:32:43] and many times and you know
[1:32:45] funerals are so important it reminds us
[1:32:48] not just our humanity and our frailty
[1:32:52] and the fact that we are here for a
[1:32:54] specific period of time
[1:32:56] and we have boundaries that we cannot
[1:32:57] cross
[1:32:58] but we cannot take anything in this
[1:33:01] world with you
[1:33:02] and today
[1:33:04] if i want to put a title to what i'm
[1:33:06] going to share with you for a few
[1:33:07] moments i won't be long
[1:33:09] i'm going to call it between the regions
[1:33:11] of the lost
[1:33:13] and the regions of the blessed
[1:33:15] this is where we are at here right now
[1:33:17] on earth
[1:33:19] between the regions of the lost and the
[1:33:22] regions of the bliss
[1:33:24] we know where jason gone too
[1:33:26] he's gone to the regions of the blessed
[1:33:28] but just as sure as there's the regions
[1:33:31] of the blessed there's also the regions
[1:33:34] of the lost the currency here
[1:33:37] of wealth
[1:33:39] fame
[1:33:40] health
[1:33:41] and fortune don't work over there
[1:33:44] when you go overseas
[1:33:46] you can't use your own currency
[1:33:49] you have got to get your money converted
[1:33:52] or changed
[1:33:53] you cannot take your tt dollars
[1:33:55] and go into the u.s and say you're gonna
[1:33:57] buy this and buy that it just won't work
[1:34:00] it has to be converted
[1:34:02] if it is not converted it has no value
[1:34:05] and jesus
[1:34:07] the first sermon he preached
[1:34:09] he said
[1:34:10] i say unto you
[1:34:12] except a man be born again he cannot see
[1:34:15] the kingdom of god
[1:34:17] nicodemus said unto him how can a man be
[1:34:19] born when he's old can he enter his
[1:34:21] second time in his mother's womb and be
[1:34:23] born and jesus said i say unto thee
[1:34:26] except a man be born and he defined it
[1:34:29] of the water and of the spirit he cannot
[1:34:32] enter into the kingdom of god that which
[1:34:35] is born of flesh is flesh
[1:34:37] that was born of the spirit is spirit
[1:34:39] marvelous but i said unto thee you must
[1:34:41] be born again
[1:34:43] now
[1:34:44] genesis 1 when god made man it was a
[1:34:46] spirit man
[1:34:47] that man couldn't tell the soil
[1:34:50] genesis 2 god take dust and form the man
[1:34:54] that's in that box right there because
[1:34:56] what jason was living in was a house
[1:34:59] so that flesh man
[1:35:01] that had five senses to contact this
[1:35:03] world is what god put a spirit man
[1:35:06] inside of that flesh man and man become
[1:35:08] a living soul
[1:35:10] so the jason that you know physical he
[1:35:13] was just beyond physical in other words
[1:35:16] the only reason cats and dogs and
[1:35:18] monkeys and and whoever is not inside of
[1:35:20] a church is because they don't have a
[1:35:21] soul
[1:35:22] but you have a soul and the fact we are
[1:35:25] here today is because of one thing
[1:35:27] because of sin
[1:35:28] it wasn't a bad it wasn't outside woman
[1:35:30] outside man is what adam and eve and a
[1:35:32] word from god the day you eat thereof
[1:35:35] that day you die
[1:35:36] that was the word from god people have i
[1:35:38] call it the god of their own imagination
[1:35:41] they have a thinking of what god is but
[1:35:43] the god that i know is a god that keeps
[1:35:45] his word it was a man and his wife you
[1:35:48] tell them the day you eat thereof is
[1:35:50] nothing that a nice child you know that
[1:35:52] day you die
[1:35:53] they eat of that tree and that's why we
[1:35:55] have a funeral today if adam didn't do
[1:35:57] it we was gonna have a funeral today
[1:35:58] because adam did it
[1:36:00] but christ came and paid the price that
[1:36:02] we could be restored back and that is
[1:36:04] what this whole gospel is about
[1:36:06] born again not catch phrases god is a
[1:36:08] good god all the time that's a nice
[1:36:10] phrase but it's not to go to the bible
[1:36:12] god of the bible keeps his word
[1:36:15] born again not saying catch phrases but
[1:36:17] to be changed to be transformed just as
[1:36:20] it changed tt dollars to u.s to be
[1:36:22] effective and they go to the states you
[1:36:25] to be effective going across there have
[1:36:27] to be changed
[1:36:29] and they call a conversion two parts
[1:36:31] word and spirit isn't that right and the
[1:36:34] bible talk about being born again of the
[1:36:37] not of the corruptable seed but of the
[1:36:39] incorruptible by the word of god and
[1:36:41] delivered to ever so the conversion must
[1:36:44] take place on this side
[1:36:46] to be recognized on the other side
[1:36:48] right now
[1:36:50] we are in a holding room this it
[1:36:52] a holding place
[1:36:54] a waiting room to see at the end of your
[1:36:58] thoughts words decisions and actions at
[1:37:01] the end of it you will either go in the
[1:37:03] regions of the bliss
[1:37:04] or the regions of the loss
[1:37:06] jesus said
[1:37:08] luke 13 strive to enter into the
[1:37:11] straight gate for many i say unto you
[1:37:13] will seek to enter in and shall not be
[1:37:15] able when once the master of the house
[1:37:18] is risen up and had shut the door and
[1:37:20] you begin to stand without and to knock
[1:37:22] on the door saying lord lord open unto
[1:37:24] us he shall answer and say unto you i
[1:37:27] know you not whence you are then you
[1:37:29] shall say we have eaten and drunk in
[1:37:31] your presence and thou has taught in our
[1:37:33] streets he shall say i tell you
[1:37:36] i know you not whence you are depart
[1:37:39] from me
[1:37:40] all the workers have iniquity you know
[1:37:42] remind me the story the bible story
[1:37:44] about the wedding and it happened i
[1:37:46] travel and in africa i saw it i couldn't
[1:37:48] believe it
[1:37:50] but in those days you were given the
[1:37:51] garment to enter the wedding so
[1:37:53] everybody looked the same and i was
[1:37:55] there african wedding and everybody had
[1:37:57] the same color material and it looked as
[1:38:00] if they will give to the guests what
[1:38:02] kind of material to buy so everybody
[1:38:05] look the same way so you can't go on i
[1:38:07] say crush the wedding as such
[1:38:09] and the bible gave a description because
[1:38:11] the eastern book and the man everybody
[1:38:14] had the same garment and one man was
[1:38:16] dressed differently and the man come and
[1:38:17] say friend how did you get in here
[1:38:20] because once i come to the door you will
[1:38:22] give him a garment so you know who rich
[1:38:23] who poor who have who don't have
[1:38:25] everybody wear the same garment and that
[1:38:28] man didn't have the garment he said buy
[1:38:30] name foot he called him friend
[1:38:33] and there shall be weeping and wailing a
[1:38:35] nation of god and nation of teeth
[1:38:37] so i want to say today
[1:38:39] during the home stretch of what we want
[1:38:40] to say
[1:38:41] this is not a
[1:38:42] game the reality of debt is because of
[1:38:46] sin or unbelief or disbelief of god's
[1:38:49] truth
[1:38:51] because you have to disbelieve god's
[1:38:53] truth
[1:38:54] before you can accept the devil's lie
[1:38:56] let me say that again
[1:38:58] you have to disbelieve god's truth
[1:39:02] before you accept the devil's line
[1:39:05] god is a good god all the time we talk
[1:39:07] about that it's like whistling in the
[1:39:09] cemetery tonight and saying you're not
[1:39:10] frightened you are frightened that's why
[1:39:13] you're whistling
[1:39:16] go to adam the day you eat that day you
[1:39:18] die god kept this word
[1:39:20] and adam died and god get out of the
[1:39:22] boots and kick him out
[1:39:24] of the garden put angels to god away
[1:39:26] back to the tree of life
[1:39:28] this is the god of the bible oh my here
[1:39:31] you are on earth
[1:39:32] between the regions of the lost
[1:39:35] and the regions of the blessed
[1:39:37] oh my
[1:39:38] if a man die shall he live again is a
[1:39:41] question
[1:39:42] and jesus brought back the answer he
[1:39:45] brought back the evidence by him not
[1:39:48] just being raised from the dead but to
[1:39:50] release his own spirit upon the lives of
[1:39:53] individuals
[1:39:54] and charms transform lives from sinner
[1:39:57] to a saint i am not talking about going
[1:40:00] to church i am talking about your life
[1:40:03] being changed
[1:40:05] not you stop doing this and stop doing
[1:40:06] that you know something happened on the
[1:40:08] inside take out the lust for this and
[1:40:10] the desires for that and something is
[1:40:12] just happening inside and your life is
[1:40:15] changed
[1:40:16] the holy spirit comes back upon the
[1:40:19] believer and the effect of it produces a
[1:40:22] changed life so you're not like you're
[1:40:24] trying something i said drinking or stop
[1:40:26] drinking no i'm not talking about that
[1:40:28] that's you stopping that you stopping
[1:40:30] smoking now you stopping limit i'm not
[1:40:32] about what you could do i'm talking
[1:40:34] about when god does something in your
[1:40:36] heart and in your life like his dad said
[1:40:40] something about his wife so powerful he
[1:40:42] admire the way she raised her children
[1:40:46] unto the lord is it something that he
[1:40:48] could see with his eyes he is not
[1:40:49] talking on truth he is talking the truth
[1:40:52] is something he witnessed it's something
[1:40:53] he saw is something that happened and
[1:40:56] this is what has to happen to us a
[1:40:58] change
[1:40:59] oh my a changed life
[1:41:02] is evidence there's another world you
[1:41:04] hear on the tape jason hallelujah that
[1:41:07] is from another world because amidst
[1:41:09] trials amidst dark hours he could say
[1:41:12] hallelujah it's a evidence that that
[1:41:15] shout that hallelujah is some around the
[1:41:17] world we don't belong here we are only
[1:41:19] journeying through here you can't take
[1:41:21] your money with you your car with you
[1:41:23] your land with you your house with you
[1:41:24] your car even take your family with you
[1:41:26] but we are journeying through here oh my
[1:41:30] our lives watch jesus himself said my
[1:41:33] kingdom is not of this world
[1:41:35] he said there's another kingdom there's
[1:41:37] another place jesus said i go to prepare
[1:41:39] a place for you and you are here what
[1:41:42] you are somewhere else our lives now
[1:41:45] are reflects where we are going let me
[1:41:48] say that again good
[1:41:49] our lives now reflects where we are
[1:41:52] going don't roll the dice jason wasn't
[1:41:54] gambling he was unashamedly a worshiper
[1:41:57] unashamedly loved the lord or my shame
[1:41:59] he will tell you about jesus he was just
[1:42:01] like that it was real to him and that is
[1:42:04] why he could express it from his heart
[1:42:06] he wasn't talking from his head and
[1:42:07] trying to be pretentious or he wasn't
[1:42:08] hypocritical he was genuine he was
[1:42:11] authentic he was original that's why
[1:42:13] he's just a unique kind of person and
[1:42:16] god made him thus oh hallelujah so this
[1:42:19] watch this our lives are reflects on
[1:42:22] where we are going the evidence of a
[1:42:24] transformed life is the witness that we
[1:42:27] have of a place on the other side this
[1:42:29] is what the resurrection is about this
[1:42:31] is what christianity is about this is
[1:42:33] what jesus being raised from the dead is
[1:42:35] about it's not about going to church but
[1:42:37] a transformed resurrected life by the
[1:42:40] spirit of god coming upon the human
[1:42:43] heart
[1:42:44] oh my if a cat had a soul a dog or a
[1:42:47] soul that would be in church here in the
[1:42:48] word of god but man
[1:42:51] have a soul
[1:42:52] a conscience and a subconscious
[1:42:54] you don't even need the bible to be
[1:42:56] judged you just need your own conscience
[1:42:59] god could take out your own conscience
[1:43:00] when you lie when you steal when you do
[1:43:02] something adultery or whatever it is you
[1:43:04] know in your heart you're wrong all god
[1:43:07] has to do is take it out and put it in
[1:43:08] this whole camera and his old theater
[1:43:11] and play back your own conscience to you
[1:43:13] and your own conscience will condemn you
[1:43:15] your own conscience will condemn you and
[1:43:17] that is why you need to repent and let
[1:43:19] the blood of jesus come and cleanse your
[1:43:20] past and cleanse your sin oh my
[1:43:23] hallelujah
[1:43:24] you not only is flesh and blood you have
[1:43:26] a body you have a spirit you have a soul
[1:43:29] your body contacts the earth here oh my
[1:43:32] and sometimes in your spirit you want
[1:43:35] this and when you get this you'll be
[1:43:36] happy when they get a husband they'll be
[1:43:37] happy when they get a wife you'll be
[1:43:38] happy when they get a child and as you
[1:43:40] get things and you start to get happy
[1:43:42] the the goal keep moving the posts keep
[1:43:44] moving because the devil keeps shifting
[1:43:46] things around thinking but you see
[1:43:48] happiness have to come on the inside if
[1:43:50] not the thing is going to get you happy
[1:43:52] is that what you possess should get you
[1:43:53] happy is what you have on the inside is
[1:43:55] what's going to get you happy oh my i'm
[1:43:57] going to close
[1:43:59] that don't change you
[1:44:01] it's only changed where you go
[1:44:03] where you live
[1:44:04] whatever you are here when you cross
[1:44:06] over you'll be just that scenery if
[1:44:08] you're a liar here it will be a line
[1:44:09] across there if you're born here we bang
[1:44:11] across here you have to change here
[1:44:14] this is the place you have to change
[1:44:16] not church i'm not talking about church
[1:44:18] i'm talking about change oh hallelujah
[1:44:20] here's what people don't get
[1:44:23] when you die
[1:44:26] your human spirit breaks up
[1:44:29] that human spirit is where you feel
[1:44:31] short of your money
[1:44:33] where you might be a ceo
[1:44:35] where you have your degree
[1:44:36] where you have your doctorate where
[1:44:38] people look up to you that all that is
[1:44:40] in the human spirit
[1:44:42] and when you die it breaks up and your
[1:44:44] soul comes up
[1:44:46] and whatever your soul is that is what
[1:44:48] stands
[1:44:49] and i'll give you an example
[1:44:51] there's a woman
[1:44:53] she taught she was saved
[1:44:55] she was going to church
[1:44:56] she thought she was fine she was thought
[1:44:58] she on her way to him
[1:45:00] and she was dying
[1:45:01] and as a spirit begin to break up she
[1:45:03] started well i'm lost
[1:45:06] i am lost
[1:45:07] you see after a while all this i am this
[1:45:10] and i have so much and all what the
[1:45:12] things you have begin to break and fade
[1:45:14] away
[1:45:15] just recently somebody died in this
[1:45:16] church and he was telling me and i know
[1:45:18] he loved electronics he loved disney
[1:45:19] love a lot of stuff he said bertillo he
[1:45:22] said all the desire for these things has
[1:45:24] gone
[1:45:25] he was leaving
[1:45:26] and as he was leaving the desires it
[1:45:29] just i know him i know him for years
[1:45:31] over 30 40 years and it just left him
[1:45:35] because you know why he was preparing to
[1:45:37] leave here
[1:45:39] who thinks about that
[1:45:41] when i had my child i didn't understand
[1:45:44] that that child already replaced me
[1:45:46] i didn't get that it was my little child
[1:45:48] i'm rocking there
[1:45:49] but actually my little baby
[1:45:52] was a replacement
[1:45:54] it just took 30 40 years to show up that
[1:45:57] no one's have no babies no more have big
[1:45:58] men who have their own children no my
[1:46:00] gran i'm a grandfather no
[1:46:02] but that is life
[1:46:04] you see it doesn't stop it goes on
[1:46:06] so people
[1:46:07] are deceived in the human spirit
[1:46:10] this is where you have all these i am
[1:46:13] this and i am that and you're proud and
[1:46:14] whatnot but that breaks up
[1:46:16] and your soul comes up
[1:46:19] and if your soul is not right it is
[1:46:21] condemned
[1:46:22] because your soul not your conscious
[1:46:24] your subconscious is the real you
[1:46:27] hallelujah
[1:46:29] that woman
[1:46:31] when it hit her
[1:46:32] nobody has to tell you no she knew she
[1:46:34] was lost
[1:46:35] it was too late then
[1:46:37] they gave us some kind of
[1:46:39] inoculation and she get conquered she
[1:46:41] died
[1:46:42] she was lost
[1:46:44] there's some place called the regions of
[1:46:46] the lost
[1:46:47] and there's another place called the
[1:46:48] regions of the blessed and you are in
[1:46:50] between
[1:46:51] i'm gonna close revelation 19 says let
[1:46:54] us be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[1:46:56] him for the marriage of the lamb has
[1:46:57] come and his wife had made himself ready
[1:47:00] he said unto me he said blessed are thee
[1:47:03] which are called unto the marriage
[1:47:06] supper of the lamb he said unto me these
[1:47:08] are the two sayings of god
[1:47:10] i'm going to wrap up here now
[1:47:12] luke chapter 16 there was a certain rich
[1:47:15] man which had clawed in purple and fine
[1:47:17] linen feared sumptuously every day and
[1:47:20] there was a certain beggar named lazarus
[1:47:22] which had laid at the gate full of sores
[1:47:24] and desiring to be fed and the crumbs
[1:47:27] which fell from the rich man's table
[1:47:28] moreover the dogs came
[1:47:30] and licked his swords
[1:47:32] it came to pass that the beggar died
[1:47:35] and was carried by the angels into
[1:47:37] ibrahim's bosom
[1:47:38] what is that the regions of the blessed
[1:47:41] all right
[1:47:42] and the rich man died and was buried
[1:47:45] and in hell
[1:47:46] he lifted up his eyes
[1:47:49] being in torment and see it abraham are
[1:47:51] far off and last rush in his bosom where
[1:47:54] is he in the regions of the lost
[1:47:57] and he cried saying father abraham have
[1:48:00] mercy on me send lazarus that he may dip
[1:48:03] the tip of his finger in water and cool
[1:48:05] my tongue if i'm tormented by the flames
[1:48:07] so this is another dimension now on
[1:48:10] earth rich american style here dropping
[1:48:12] nobody crumbs the beggar but but this
[1:48:15] change now both of them is dead
[1:48:18] one in the region of the blessed
[1:48:21] the other
[1:48:22] in the region of the lost
[1:48:23] he said no watch he cried and said
[1:48:25] father abraham have mercy on me and send
[1:48:28] lazarus that he may dip the tip of a
[1:48:30] thing in water and cool my tongue if i'm
[1:48:32] tormented in this flame and abraham said
[1:48:35] son remember that though when thy life
[1:48:37] thing received thy good things and
[1:48:39] likewise lazarus evil things but now he
[1:48:42] is comforted and dawah tormented and
[1:48:44] besides all this between us and you
[1:48:47] there's a great gulf fixed so that they
[1:48:50] would not pass hence so that you cannot
[1:48:52] neither can they pass to us so they
[1:48:54] can't cross there's a gulf between us
[1:48:56] right that they would come dance then he
[1:48:58] said i pray thee now listen to this
[1:49:00] request imagine a man in hell
[1:49:02] he's the reasons of the loss he have a
[1:49:04] concern for his family here his request
[1:49:08] he says he said i pray to their
[1:49:10] forefather that dog would have sent him
[1:49:13] to my father's house for i have five
[1:49:15] brethren that he may testify unto them
[1:49:18] least they also committed this place of
[1:49:20] torment ibrahim said unto him they have
[1:49:22] moses and the prophets let them hear
[1:49:24] them he said near father abraham but if
[1:49:27] one went unto them from the dead they
[1:49:29] would repent he said unto him if they
[1:49:31] hear not moses and the prophets neither
[1:49:34] will they be persuaded even though one
[1:49:36] rose from the dead
[1:49:39] so you are here
[1:49:41] where you are somewhere else
[1:49:44] that don't change you
[1:49:46] it just changes where you go to
[1:49:49] god will not be mocked
