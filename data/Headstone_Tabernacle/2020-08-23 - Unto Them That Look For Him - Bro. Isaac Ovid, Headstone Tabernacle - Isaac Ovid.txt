greatest he grace is he that is in me oh great is he that is in me oh great is he that is in me that he that is in the blessed be the name of the lord can we just bow our heads for word of prayer oh gracious heavenly father we thank you this morning lord for life lord for the opportunity to be able to gather in this way lord a different kind of a way lord that speaks to the season and the hour that we're living in and how we see the world is falling apart lord and lord to see the disruption the interruption of lives lord not just in this country but around the world lord to see how all these things lord don't come as a surprise to us father because lord there's a change that has taken place there's a transformation that is taking place lord the prophecies are being fulfilled in front of our very eyes lord so as we gather lord in this virtual service lord with the people in their homes where they may be lord you know exactly what you want to say this morning you know exactly what you want to do this morning lord you know how lord the the needs of the people and the challenges and the situations and law the conditions of this life that people have to endure lord i pray that you would open up the word to our understanding and you would walk out the pages of the bible lord may you speak to us in a special way lord and lord god we pray a special blessing on our pastor this morning lord and the ministry and the church we pray a special blessing on the believers that they would be in the spirit and in the atmosphere and they would declare their homes to be holy ground and they will put aside everything else and not be distracted but they will enter into the presence of the lord and lord may every man take his place may every man take his rank lord as we lord have worshiped lord to set an atmosphere for your word to come forth lord may you take me out of the way lord bless the officers that are just here to get the technology going and everything father and lord may you be with us in the precious theme of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen so i'd like to greet you this morning in the precious theme of jesus christ it's certainly a great privilege to be in the house of the lord and to be in fellowship there's no audience here this morning so but we know that we are connected by faith we are connected by the revelation we are connected by the word we are connected by the covenant we are connected by our predestination we are connected by our destination we are connected by the one who called us the one who preserved us and it is in times like these when uh nobody else could really see us and we are in our homes and we are struggling to deal with the changes of this world and and the whole pandemic and these things that we ought to be certain of god our faith cannot rest uh in in in ourselves our fate cannot rest on the church building our faith has to rest on almighty god so i'm here this morning by faith i torbered over it i wasn't feeling too well the last few days but i'm at my post of duty this morning looking to see god do something for us and to speak to us through his word because the word comes for us to be changed and to be transformed and i know it's been a real blessing uh the services the last few services that would have administered and truly truly truly a blessing to my soul and i pray that uh this morning god will do something for us as well so if you have your bibles would you turn with me uh to one portion of scripture reading from hebrews chapter 9 and reading from verse 24 this morning hebrews 9 and verse 24. for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true in other words uh for christ has entered not into holy places made with hands which are the copies of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us know yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entered into the holy place every year with blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world had he appeared to put away sin for the sacrifice of himself and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in your homes and uh robert really preached a tremendous message he has been on on on a road uh and he preached a message on wednesday night for those who love his appearing so i want to kind of connect to that now and take as a title this morning unto them that look for him so we're speaking unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation but unto them that look for him is the thought and the text this morning and uh brother branham had used that very same scripture that i read uh in a message that he preached called look you know and uh when you see what's happening and and you know it it takes a level of maturity to live above the situation and the circumstances but the world is looking for peace the world is looking for uh relief from the stress businesses are looking for a relief of the pandemic and these different things and but iran said in the message look now everybody is looking today everybody is looking for something and looking for something to happen so everybody is looking for something and looking for something to happen we know that the world is constantly watching the skies the radar and the screens and i can imagine somewhere there's some biologists or some doctor and he's studying china he's looking for a vaccine they're looking for a solution they're looking for some way to to to bring some relief to the world and and and man has every right to try to do what he wants to do there the radar and the screens that we have up around the nation every nation for its own defense whether branham said has got a magic eye looking to find something to appear into this screen like an atomic missile or something then they've got something there to go back to the one that's centered this way everything is looking and he's speaking in his context the ford company is looking to make a better ford the chevrolet is looking making a better chevrolet phoenix is looking to make a larger and better town the nation is looking for more territory so it can spread itself the church the church is looking for more members but the bride is looking for the coming of her lord and that's how i feel this morning we are looking for the coming of the lord we're not looking just to have church we don't even have it the way we would normally do but we are looking for the coming of the lord because we are getting ready to leave this place everything that's happening around us is for us to get ready to leave this place why this world is not our home we are just a passing through we are just walking through every day and we are trying to get back to where we were because man lost his way and we are working to get our way back can the church say amen so i want you to get in the spirit this morning i'm not going to be too long with you but i want to connect to individuals who are looking for him not just looking for a better job not just looking for a raise or pay not just looking to be a good church member not just looking to say i believe the message but looking unto him looking for him looking to him too many people are looking to the pastor too many people looking to the church but unto them that look for him unto them that look for him shall he appear so there are people who are in church who are members of the body and they are not looking to him they are just coming and they're just going and they're looking around but i'm speaking this morning to those that are looking unto him your eyes is fixed on him brother branham gave the example of that brass serpent he said if you look to the serpent then you got your healing so he said look and live so we want to be looking this morning not on the negativity we want to be looking this morning not on the bad news and what's happening but we want to look for him because when you look to him you get joy when you look to him you get hope when you look to him you get peace when you look to him it gets hallelujah oh joy unspeakable and full of glory when you look to him you see a possibility of what you didn't see before can the church say amen when you look to him you see him as he is you see him in the form of the holy spirit being present being real in your home real in your life can the church say amen so i'm encouraged this morning and i want to kind of connect a bit to the last message i preached about have we done enough because if you're looking for him then you're supposed to be making preparations anybody with me this morning if you're looking to him then it means that you are supposed to be putting things in place because your focus is him and it is so easy to lose focus in such a time as this and i realize all the news and all that's happening around us is to distract us from looking on to him can the church say amen you get caught up in this thing and and you're sending messages around about the virus and about this and about that and and at the end of the day you get so heavy and so anxious and all these things but that's the trick of the devil to keep your eyes away from him but when you look only to him then everything else begins to lose meaning everything else begins to lose priority everything else that began to stress you began to fall apart abraham was not looking at his condition abraham was not looking at sarah's condition abraham was looking to him abraham was looking to the promise abraham was looking to the word and as believers if there ever was a time for us to look to the word of god it's this time if there ever was a time to look to what the promise of god for this age is it is this time now and that's how i feel this morning that's my motivation to be here this morning because it's later than we think but our eyes this morning are fixed on him our eyes are focused on him and we are not going to go back we are not going to turn back we are not going to give up we are going to stay focused just like elijah and elisha he said if you see me go you're going to have what you asked for and the church say amen so that same focus is what we are talking about because only unto them that look for him hallelujah there are many people they're looking at words or they're looking at the books and they're looking at the tapes and he is not in the picture but we're talking about looking to him this morning and when you look at him and when you see him you see the promises for your home you see the promises for your family you see the possibility not just the possibility but the reality that you're going to be healed that you're going to be delivered that you're going to be adopted you're going to be perfected that you're going to grow up into a son of authority can the church say amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh so there has to be a way because if you're looking to him there has to be a way for him to identify i want you to catch this now if you are looking to him there has to be a way for him to identify who is looking to him because that's the only way he could appear to those and look for him can the church say amen so we are talking about that connection between you looking to him and him appearing to you there has to be some way for him to know who's looking at him we're not talking about physical eyes now but we're talking about looking to him and looking to his word and if you see his word his word should get you into action and that's where we're going this morning because when you look to him it puts you into action that's the only way he could know you're looking at him because he is the word and he is the spirit so our focus as believers now more than ever is to look at him as word and to see him as spirit and when word and spirit comes together something has got to happen can the church say amen glory even when jesus was on the earth oh john told them go find out are you the one or should we look for another they knew that somebody was coming they knew that something was going to happen oh glory to god and all these years we have been in the message we know something is about to happen it has not been for us to have church all these years that's not the objective the objective is not for us to be good church members the objective is for him to be able to appear a personal visitation to you oh hallelujah somebody say man no turning back hallelujah from the messenger token but god sent back the holy ghost that's the token was upon the human in the human's heart and that is your identification that you have accepted god's plan meant jehovah's requirements so in other words those that look into him they are the ones who will come in contact with the token not those who are looking at their circumstances not those who are looking at their situations not those who are looking at their problems not those who are looking at the opposition but those who look at the word for this day can the church say amen and that's the identification he met them for you at calvary and you have met them on your knees god has given you the token sign and return of the spirit was upon christ is in you and a guarantee identification of his life death burial and resurrection and a lie forevermore now in the believing church amen it's a positive token a token sign and we know when that token is applied when i see the blood when i see the token i'll pass over you when i see the token the play can come nigh you when i see the token hallelujah glory to god blessed be the name of the lord i can't hear you shout him but shout in your homes shout wherever you are right now lift your hands and give god praise give god glory because this is our time this is our season oh i feel like that that blind bartimaeus who couldn't see jesus but he lift his voice and say son of david have mercy on me he was not next to jesus but he was in the spirit he knew that jesus oh hallelujah could meet his need even though he had no eyes he was looking to jesus oh come on now even though he couldn't see him with his natural eyes he was looking to jesus and jesus appeared unto him oh blessed be the name of the lord and that is your promise to dave if you look on his word if you look on his promises if you look at the fact that every promise belongs to us every promise spoken in scripture that could not have been filled be it been fulfilled before this time it's for us to pick it up and for us to live it us to walk with it us to manifest it can the church say amen and the situations and the trials and what's happening around us is to create an environment for the world to be made manifest i'll say that one more time the situations and the trials and the tests and what's happening around us is to create the environment for the world to be made manifest situations have to come so that god could be proven situations have to come so you can exercise exercise the sea that's inside of you don't let the devil knock you out don't let the devil depress you don't let the devil frustrate you but lift up your head this morning and look to jesus because your redemption draw it nigh your hope draw it nigh your peace draw at nigh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah going on in the token the blood was the token that jehovah's requirements had been met in this house hallelujah so when you look to jesus and you are preparing for jesus i want to make the point now when you're looking for jesus you're looking to jesus you are expecting his appearing and you want him to appear to you and you want him to feel comfortable to come to you you want him to be welcome to come to you you cannot operate the same way that you have operated there has to be a change because he is holy so we must walk holy he is righteous so we must become righteous he hallelujah hallelujah there has to be a compatibility he must be able to say flesh of my flesh spirit of my spirit bone of my bone oh that's why he can only come unto them now look for him because this is a group of people it's not the majority it's the minority who are making preparations they are doing everything they are doing all that they could do they asked themselves the question have i done enough is there more to do because jesus is coming oh brother branham said if a celebrity or somebody important is coming to your house you will make preparations for it hallelujah are you making preparations to leave this place are you making preparations to leave this world behind are you making preparations in your daily walk are you making preparations in your daily talk nobody can see you but you're making preparations you can't fellowship the way you used to but you're making preparations every day you say lord i want to be ready and you are making the adjustments come the church say amen oh give the lord a shout out praise so that when i see the token i'll pass over you when the token is there show the price see the blood was not dead but it was the token of the death when i see the blood i'll know the debt price has been made so i'll pass over you oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i want to share this but abandonment saying the other day i was telling someone little donovan words here i guess you all know him i was hunting with him poor little fellow he's a nice little guy he comes here to church just a very good friend of mine and he said didn't want to bother you i looked and his ear turned all the way inside out and i said how are you donovan just took him by the hand like that on a cancer and i said donovan what's the matter with your ear he said don't know brother branham about six seven months and it just keeps getting i said why didn't you say something about it he said i didn't want to bother you brother branham i said do you know what it is he said i have no idea and brother adam said i just put my hand on him never said a word hallelujah two days after that there wasn't even a scar oh my my mind let me read that one more time he said i just put my hand on over him never said a word two days after that there wasn't even a scar what is it and this is what i want to get to friends because when you are looking to him there has to be a power that connects you and brother branham said it's the quickening power oh hallelujah and that's what i'm looking for is the quickening power oh that's what keeping you alive the quickening power is what brings the seed in your soul to life so if you're feeling kind of low this morning you need a quickening power to come into your soul you need a quickening power to come into your home you need a quickening power to come all over you and all your down feeling kind of get changed because the seed in you you didn't now put that seed there that seed has been there all along oh give the lord a shout of praise that seed has been there all along but what that seed needs is the quickening power oh lord send the quicken in power this morning send the anointing this morning see listen to the prophet it will quicken your mortal body his air would eat off his brains would have gone see he'd have died but the quickening power see oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name listen listen to the prophet and one day this is him talking about one day when i was wearing myself so maybe this will help somebody i said if you boy you better go ahead you're 50 years old now if you're going to do anything for the lord you better hurry up and do it you get an old seat and dear that morning the quickening power come and he let me look over the curtain and i seen all of you over there uh-huh see he said all that you ever loved and all loved you their gift to you see i seen them all over there like that what was it quickening power john the revelator was filled full of quickening power that stood up and seen the end from the beginning isaiah was full of quickening power and stood up and seen the millennium and all quickening power if the quickening power will make them see what they saw if the quickening power will make them feel how they felt if the quickening power will make them walk how they walked if the quickening power will make them shout how they shouted if the quickening power will make them turn the way they dance then i won that quickening power oh the letter kill it but the spirit gave it life i want the quickening power all over me i want the qriket and power in my soul i want the quickening power in my heart i want the quickening power to be able to move free into my life but iran said if the spirit that raised up christ from the dead dwell in you it will quicken your mortal body so that spirit has to dwell in you and if that spirit is in you it will quicken this mortal body it'll take over this mortal body it'll transform this mortal body i tell you you have a body change coming oh that gray hair is going to go black that ball is going to be reversed that ad right is going to be dissolved what will it be the quickening power that female condition has to be reversed because it was not so from the beginning when god placed man on the earth he was a perfect man but the fall of man separated man from that perfection but god created a way because even though man fell the seed in him could not fall because the seed was an eternal seed and that seed all these years has been waiting being moved in you to be connected with the quickening power because when the quicken and power connect with the seed it can only do one thing bring the sea to life oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord so i'm looking to see individuals begin to break out because they begin to look to him and that in looking to him they begin to make preparations they begin to cry out they begin to seek him they begin to forget the world they begin to forget everything else they begin to look unto him and the more you see him the more you look at him the more you see his be his being the more you see his nature the more you see his attributes up the more you see what he looks like you see all about him and the more you look at him is the more you can dress yourself the more you look at him is the more you can adjust yourself the more you look at him is the more you can make the changes because you want to be like him you want to look like him you want to walk like him you want to talk like him not like the church not like the pastor but like him unto them that look for him he shall appear those are the only ones he's gonna appear to not the one that's looking for church not the one that looking around the world but the ones who are focused on him so we want to bring back the focus in our lives i'm not a complicated preacher i'm a simple preacher i want to see jesus that's who i want to see all these years we've seen a lot of flesh we've seen a lot of explanation we have seen a lot of talk we have seen a lot of people come and go but sirs i want to see jesus i'm looking for him do you know where he is oh hallelujah do you know where he is i want to find him in the word i want to find how he speaks about me because brother branham had to find what was written about him in the word and we have to find what's written about us in the word and but the panel said if you read this bible and don't see jesus in every verse of scripture you got to read it again so we want to look to him this morning look to him for our joy look to him for our peace and look for him for sustenance when the world is falling apart don't look for the economy because that can't help you but look to jesus he could take care of you he promised to never leave you comfortable he promised hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord oh i'm encouraging you this morning i'm encouraging you this morning to look again oh look again go look again take another look i invite you to take another look at that one who walked the earth and broke the bread and broke the fish and fed 5 000 i invite you to take another look up at this man called jesus i invite you to take another look up don't look at the person who would have been next to you in the church but i invite you forget who's next to you forget who's on the side of you i invite you to look at jesus oh there are many people who look at the prophet and they forget to look at jesus the prophet was a sign pointing to jesus paul said follow me as i follow christ it's always been about jesus unto them that look for him because he is the fulfillment of every promise of every single promise that we preach every single service it's all speaking about that great promise and that great promise is jesus the mystery of god the whole mystery of god revealed every promise of god wrapped up in jesus and the love gift that jesus has for his wife so that his wife can make herself ready oh blessed be the name of the lord oh worship him right now give him praise right now i don't care if you're backslidden i want to invite you to look at jesus don't look at me this morning i'm not the focus this morning i'm trying to point you to jesus because only unto him that look for him oh glory will he appear oh blessed be the name of the lord i'm gonna fail but jesus could never fail unto him that look for him oh i'm gonna make mistakes but he has never made a mistake yet there might be some battles i might lose but he has never lost a battle the promise is not unto them that look to this church but unto them that look to him let's bring back the focus on jesus let's bring back the focus on our lord the prophet came to introduce messiah he came to make sure that we didn't look at him but at branham said i didn't come to build a denomination i didn't come to draw people to myself but he came to introduce messiah and only those that look to him will see that this god that was hidden from all generations only in this time the fullness of god has been made real to us that we can partake like no others have partook before can the church see amen oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord trying to encourage you this morning trying to motivate you this morning trying to inspire you this morning oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord don't look at your situation don't look at your problem don't look at your circumstance don't look at your bank account don't look at the doctor's report don't look at who got the virus don't look at what's happening on your street don't look to the government don't look to the united nations don't look to the world health organization don't look to no minister don't look to no church don't look to no group don't look to no movement don't look to any inspiration just look to jesus just look to jesus he's the author and the finisher he is the beginning and the ender he's the first and the last he made a promise and he could keep the promise oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord give the lord a shout of praise where you are oh if you ever was afraid to shout at church there's no excuse this morning you could give the lord assault in your home you could jump in your home you could roll around like a holy roller in your home this morning because we are looking to him oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord too many of us we want to look we want to have role models we have different people who we look up to and every single time god allows it that way that man would have an issue man would have some situation no matter how the best man you could ever find there'll be something about that man that will will rob you a certain way but not this man called jesus oh hallelujah hallelujah not this man called jesus he's taken closer than a brother what a friend we have in jesus this whole message that the ministers have made so complicated is a very simple message it's about bringing jesus christ on the scene that's what this message is about it's about jesus living moving walking breeding oh hallelujah blessed be the name after lord hallelujah hallelujah glory oh blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah hallelujah so we talk about the quicken and power because he is the quickening power and we need a quickening power that's why i cannot understand if you're looking to him how you could be dead if you're looking to him how you can be sad if you're looking you could only be sad if your eye is not on him think about it how could you look at jesus and be sad how could you look at jesus and not have hope how could he look at jesus and not say hosanna hosanna hosanna worthy worthy worthy worthy is the lamb worthy is the lamb worthy is the lamb when we have the full understanding oh of the fullness of the atonement and you don't want to look and you cannot be joyful you cannot rejoice you cannot be happy oh hallelujah it takes a revelation of him for me to be here this morning to preach your empty pews hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but i know i know who he is and i know who i am and i know the relationship that we have and how the relationship will grow until one day one day we're gonna leave this place and be where god promised that we should be oh blessed be the name of the lord listen to the man i'm continuing that same message we're reading from look what we have seen in this day the quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals so the hold oldest quickening power are we talking about was to open the seven seals what was that the intelligence of a man no the quickening power of god see the quickening power of god foretold this would take place see the quickening power of god made the world testify to it it's the truth and the angel of the lord i told you was around in a purifier quickening power let the world testify that is the truth and in that they didn't know what it was and we knew just look this away and it's our lord up there you see he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of the seals then revealing christ so that's how we could see what we see and that's why we look the way we look and that's how we act the way we act and the very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us and here he is standing there supreme judge showing that he is alpha and omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power did that to us quickening power let us see his coming quickening power snatch us from debt to life quickening power gives discernment to know what's wrong with you and what to do what you have done and what you ought not have done and what you should have done and what you will be quickening power all these things oh i see no more dead services whether it's in your home whether we meet in the church whether we meet on the streets there's enough picking in power for your family this morning there's quickening power for your dead children this morning there's quickening power for your backslidden son this morning there's quickening power and that quickening power is only for those who are looking to him who i have a relationship with him who are being drawn to him he is the attraction on the mountain this morning oh blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah oh my my listen to this i don't know i'm here this morning but we are here this morning we're looking for the quickening power to close the gap between where he is and where we are something has got to happen to change his body and along the way to change in this body he said how could we have faith for a rapture if we can have even faith for divine healing it will take the quickening power if the healing is in the quickening power oh and this morning i feel it's all over me but a terry it's all over me it's all over you one of these days it could happen in this service it could happen in any service you will be there in your home you'll be driving in the car and the quickening power that we have preached about all these years the holy ghost that we have preached about all these years of the power of god that we have preached about all these years because this gospel is not in word only but it's in power if in demonstration i can sit for hours and explain and explain and explain but at some point you have to come in contact with the quickening power not a new song not a new message but the quicken in power it's the holy ghost on fire it's the quickening power that's what the devil is afraid of blessed be the name of the lord who i feel religious this morning i feel pentecostal this morning i feel baptised this morning i feel everything this morning because i'm looking for the power of god or to transform us to change us because we are looking at him and we are seeing the requirement for our day it must be the same signs it must be the same wonders it must be the same miracles it must be the same behavior it must be the same attitude hallelujah oh but i'm sad you may be seated there are people who go to church and when you watch the pastor and you watch the people they look just like the pastor they operate just like the pastor they move just like the pastor you know why because their eyes are on the pastor oh anybody with me this morning oh hallelujah but there has to come a shift a change in your walk and your talk so that when you look at jesus then your revelation isn't based on anybody else's revelation you are so focused on him that wherever he goes you willing to go whatever he says you willing to do because you are looking to him to please him is not looking at him to be aware of him no but it's to please him you're looking for him you desire him you want to be like him you are expecting him you are preparing for him you're doing all that you need to do because you want to be connected with him you want to be united with him you want to be one with him that is the power of this message can the church say amen there's no other gospel that brings that unity with one between god and his church within christ and his bride that great holy union that unity of the head with the body unto them that look for him during this period of this pandemic there will be people who will drift away and there'll be people who come in because this is a great test in time this is a testing time there's nobody there to give you a hug and say you have to social distance so you have to encourage yourself you have to encourage yourself there's nobody to say just shake your hand you have to shake your own hand can the church say amen oh hallelujah like david he encouraged himself in the lord that's a real soldier now hallelujah when you can't see your church brother your church sister you know that that what is most important is to see him no one has ever seen him and remain the same hallelujah moses saw him as a burning bush and the moses that went up was not the moses that went down it's impossible to see him i have the same attitude you had when you walked up to him the more you see him is the more your behavior has to change because he is truth he is light he is the word he is perfection he is perfect and when you see him in perfection you look and see your imperfection and if there's a seed in your soul it drives you to be perfect then you take the word of god and you could read be there for perfect and now it takes on a new meaning because you are looking at his perfection you are looking at the fact that he didn't have to take your place what he did and if you see that about him it wants you to draw closer to him because he did for you what nobody else could do oh somebody help me this morning unto them that look for him looking for him looking for his coming looking for his power looking for his presence looking for his anointing looking for his word to be read to you this morning only unto them that look for him i hope this resonates in your soul this morning what are you looking for but i brought him in that message looky keep asking the question what are you looking for what are you looking for what are you looking for i'm looking for him i want to see him i want to see him walk in my life i want to see him walk among the young people i'm looking for him i'm looking for him to restore the backsliders i'm looking for him and he promised if you look for him he will appear he is promised up here and he has never broken a promise he has never broken a promise mama are you looking for him this morning papa are you looking for him this morning hallelujah but i'm saying you get what you expect so if you're looking for him to visit your children he's going to appear if you're looking for him to visit your house he will appear you're looking to provide for you he will appear can the church say man be encouraged this morning be encouraged this morning we still talking about the quickening power that connection between him and us hallelujah because he is power hallelujah hallelujah and listen the brethren said it this way he said when the bride gets to know who she is then the rapture will go the consciousness of who you are the revelation of who you are the mystery of who you are being made known to you because perfect faith is based on position your power is based in your position hallelujah and when you're in your position and you know your position it's clear to you your authority when you don't know your position you don't know your authority with position comes authority with position comes power even if somebody is weak and they have a certain position that position gives them certain power certain authority and the devil's whole job has been to take you out of your position when you are out of your position you lose your power you lose your authority but when you get into your position it automatically comes with power it automatically comes with authority when you get into a position that's why when abram speaks about being positionally placed oh hallelujah because when you're in your position the devil knows he has to back up hallelujah when you're in your position the demons have to back up because in your position no devil could move hallelujah but the planet would be there you'd be taking the building and see what i'm waiting on i'm waiting for the angel he is here he said i take every spirit not some i take every spirit under my control not a demon move not a spirit move because he was a son in his position that was one son on the earth in position what about our day when sons plural the manifestation of the sons of god who have been looking to him looking for him are now placed in position what will it be oh what devil could hold your son what devil could hold your daughter what demon could step into your home because you are in position can the church say amen listen to the prophet we're going on our lord jesus is so full of quickening power oh he was all of it together oh hallelujah that makes me want to run around the building he was all of it together he was so full of quickening power he said this you destroy this body and i'll raise it up in three days talk about confidence in the quickening power so brother branham is saying that jesus had confidence in the quickening power that he could say destroy this in treatise i'll raise it up again do you have confidence in the quickening power ah mama papa oh hallelujah have confidence this morning come on sister christine have confidence in the quickening power but military have confidence in the quickening power if you afflicted this morning have confidence in the quickening power because with the quickening power jesus said i can lay this life down but the quickening power will raise me back up again oh blessed be the name of the lord destroy this body and this temple and i bring it up in three days why'd he say that he knew that it was written of him glory see it was written of him by the word of god which cannot feel so he said so knowing that the quickening power connects with the word you heard that spoken about you so according to the word the quickening power connects with the word that's spoken so he found a word written about him and his confidence in the quickening power and in the world that was spoken give him the confidence to see it destroy this temple and in three days i'll raise it up again but i have good news for you this morning there's words written about you there's words written about me the quickened power cannot fail because it's not our power he is the quickening power he is the holy ghost he is a spirit of god he is a dynamic and that cannot fail and if the word that we preach is the word of god then that word cannot fail and when that quickening power when the holy ghost when the dynamics connect with the mechanics word that's spoken about us oh it's finished time to shout time to give god glory so the word says i am the god that healeth you the word says you shall be by his stripes i am healed by his stripes you are healed by his stripes we are healed oh his word promised a revival his word promised that we are going to see him and that's why we come this morning even though we are not gathered together we are still looking to him oh blessed be the name of the lord somebody give the lord a shout of praise somebody give the lord a hand of praise somebody give god a shout out praise right where you're at oh hallelujah hallelujah that's okay if the neighbors hear you that's okay if your family hear you let them wonder why you're shouting in the middle of the pandemic let them wonder why you're happy and there are many reasons to be sad i sing because i'm happy i shout because i'm happy i sing because i'm free i'm sing because i know there's a quicken in power and i sing because i know there's a word written about me i sing because i'm looking to him and unto them that look to him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation he's coming to get a bribe he's coming to get his people he is coming to get his wife and his wife have made herself ready we are getting ready this morning we are making preparation this morning we are making preparations today to leave this place are you getting ready are you getting ready do you have your passport oh are you getting ready to leave this place the token is your passport hallelujah do you have your passport this morning your passport is is is not the church you attend the passport is not who your pastor is the passport is not how long in church we're trying to see him we want to connect to him we want to meet him but to close the gap you need a passport oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh i feel good this morning i want my passport right now our airport is shut down but this journey i'm talking about we don't need a local airport oh it's a highway to heaven there's a rap to express that any day now will come to pick up his pride behold a bridegroom comment going out to meet him oh and they that were ready they went in they that had their passport they went in there that had the extra oil they went in they that had the holy ghost they went in they that had the token they went in and that cry is going out this morning only unto them that look for him what are you looking for what are you looking for church what are you looking for friends this world is not getting better oh my don't look for this world to get better there's a prophecy of judgment over this it because the kings of the earth the sons of god who will reign and rule on this earth are getting ready to step into their position but abraham says the earth knows and recognizes when a sun is in place when a sun is in position when a sun is it is it's an authority so remember that branham is here he said sun cometh and shine four days he said i had to ask who's too speaking they know a manifested son is under it oh hallelujah you heard what you read he said he didn't say a word he just put his hand on the air and two days later there was no scar he didn't even pray he didn't say a word because that scar that cancer that demon knew that the sun was on the earth and that son served notice to that demon that son served notice without even seeing a word his very desire was made manifest his very intention was made manifest his thoughts containing the matter was made manifest glory to god what a time we are living in what a season we are living in with sons and daughters it's a maturing time oh hallelujah all of these situations you think god is surprised by the coronavirus you think god is suddenly trying to make adjustments because of this god saw all of this taking place he saw he set it up brother anthony he set it up this way he set up this certain service this way everything that led to this day was designed this day oh hallelujah because for all these years man has always wanted to look to man way back there when his people were coming together and they were a nation and they had been under prophets and under spiritual leadership they looked around themselves and saw the other nations with kings and they said we want a king too because the other nations have one and that's how king saul was established samuel was broken he was hurt god had to comfort his prophet to say they have not rejected you they have rejected me they're supposed to be looking to me they're supposed to be getting help from me they're supposed to be seeking my face but they want a man so they got a man named saul but god always long for that personal relationship where he can see you and you can see him hallelujah just as it was when he could come now in the cool of the evening i love that and speak to adam and adam could see him and he could see adam and they could have fellowship around what took place that day are you working to close the gap with fellowship with what happened to you every day i know it sounds simple but we have some religious fanatics who don't want to pray they are no mystery but there's no life there's no mystery but they're not looking to him they're looking for the next thing the next revelation the next whatever it is but they're not looking to jesus if people had been looking to jesus throughout all of these years many of the issues that took place in churches would have never taken place because the trust and the confidence should only be in christ jesus i love how paul expressed it and it keeps me grounded follow me as i follow christ in other words you have no excuse it is your individual responsibility to be following christ along the journey to following christ god can place many people in your way to encourage you so paul was saying i'm following christ you could follow me but make sure you're following christ yourself because if i stray you've got to keep focused that's the problem in the churches many people that confidence is in the man i don't want your confidence in me i don't want your confidence in the pastor your confidence has to be in him live or die friend or no friend whether i maintain my family let me maintain christ elijah had his focus they told him you know your master will be taken away you say hold your peace hold the peace i want to stay focused don't try to distract me that's why the horse wears blinders so they can just see the focus on the finish line not on what anybody else is doing but look into jesus hallelujah looking to jesus not looking to anybody else but looking to jesus hallelujah how could you lose lose hope if you're looking to jesus when he is hope the great physician if you look into jesus then what does the doctor report matter when he is a great physician if you're looking to jesus then where does the next meal come from bother you when he's jehovah gyra and he can provide for your needs he's your over rafa he is jehovah niesi he's your oversight canoe he is jehovah he's everything to us oh i want to see him this morning oh i long to see him i hope this is an encouragement to you this morning church always an encouragement to you this morning friends that you could keep pressing the battle and don't get distracted why'd he say that i'm still reading this quota that it was written of him by the word of god which could not fail the word said i will not suffer my holy one to seek corruption neither will i leave his soul in hell and he knowed that quickening power would raise him up and there wouldn't be one cell corrupt you hear that that's the prophet speaking so jesus know when he was speaking there be not one cell corrupt he said you destroy this temple and i'll bring it back again in three days why it was prophecy the word of god and prophecy if it's true word of god cannot fail and if we understand that this great message that we walk in the footprints of this great message by this great messenger of malachi force in luke 17 30. this great message of a vindicated prophet that cannot fail then what are you doubting why are you afraid what are you scared of have faith in god have faith in god cannot feel and the same prophecy and word of god that said he'd raise him up listen to the prophet says that we are already raised with him oh my so the prophet is not asking you the prophet is not suggesting he is speaking past tense we are already raised with him in other words who he for knew he called who he called he justified already it's past tense it's already happened who we justified he had already glorified what shall we then say to these things if god before us tell me who could be against us what principality what power what spiritual wickedness what disease what can be against us we know who we are we know where we're standing we know where we come from we know where we're going we know who the devil is and we have been equipped by this great message to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks it has nothing to do with emotion it has nothing with our feeling it has nothing but proven who is right and who's wrong we're dealing with individuals who see their names and when you see your name you see him because he is the one who put your name there you cannot see your name and not see the out of your name can the church say amen [Music] rejoice not because you have power but rejoice because your names are written we are already raised with him no wonder he said fear not and it is written that the spirit that is now was in him now in us also quickens our mortal body fear not oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now listen to this the prophet said it's possible today that good man fine man walk with christ reading his word and still don't recognize that this is the hour that certain things of this bible must be fulfilled that's that's that's scary listen again it is possible today that good man fine man walk with christ reading his word and still don't recognize that this is the hour that certain things of this bible must be fulfilled it's the hour that we're living in the time is at hand when these things must be done it's written and thus it must be fulfilled because god promised it yes our eyes must be opened to see the word and but ibrahim and the message look talked about that look is looking at his word so it cannot be just a routine for you well i read a book i read a scripture and are in church and it has to be more than that it has to open to see the word listen to the prophet now give context he said the pharisees had that word drawed out just exactly the way the messiah was coming so he's saying the pharisees had access to all of the scrolls so they had access to what anybody else had access to they believed that they were right so even though they had access to the books and the tapes and they had access to everything they believed that they were right and here he was born and walked right among them and they condemned him when he told him you search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me he said search the scriptures they said we are moses's disciples he said if you would be moses disciples you would know me for moses wrote of me and he did moses said the lord your god shall raise up a prophet like unto me a law giver and so forth and a prophet and him the people shall hear see if they have knowed moses writing they would have known him they thought they knowed moses writing but you see they didn't know it see they were blinded to that very fact so i want to nail this down here friends don't take it for granted don't just walk around saying when i read a book and i read a tape and i have the prophet message he was saying that is no different it's no different to the pharisees having all the scrolls they read the word they interpreted it the way they thought it would be and when messiah himself who they had been reading about when he appeared they didn't see him it is not that they weren't trying to look for him you know but they were not looking in the right way that's but iran is speaking about into looking unto jesus so be careful friends that you don't run down some doctrine some idea some man your own interpretation and just like the pharisees he said but we are moses disciples and that's how people talk today but i'm in the message this is the quote i have what quote you have and why are they arguing about quotes jesus himself is walking amongst them in the midst of them the word made flesh is there they're looking at the word looking at the word made flesh and they cannot make the connection you imagine that this is as if i'm reading about brother anthony and brother anthony and it's a description of him he's about this tall he's wearing this suit he's wearing a certain tie he's wearing his shoes and all of the description is there and i'm reading it i'm looking at him and i'm not even seeing that he is that so then it asks another question so then what the pharisees looking at and whether branham said it they were blinded to that very fact oh my my my my my mind oh hallelujah hallelujah so look closer friends make sure your heart is pure don't take it for granted don't follow a movement a doctrine a man an idea look at jesus christ him moving among us him moving as the holy ghost his move him moving at the spirit of god in such a time as this i'm not going to be too much longer with you all but oversee when i keep the main thing the main thing and the main thing is that this world needs jesus but it will not come in the way they expected now to be jesus veiled in sons and daughters of god who have yielded themselves who have sacrificed themselves who have gone through place of trying who have gone through character formation who have resisted every temptation who have brought their their doubt on the subjection so that they can see plainly that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever this world has got to live this world has got to live friends oh somebody give the lord a shout our praise i'm not going to be too much longer with you hallelujah from i have heard but now i see but the branham said oh men and women tonight i say today if you can look around and see how close we are to the coming of the lord listen closely now listen if you could look around unto them that look to him so if you look around you know i know who's serious because if you look into him brother shane it means your fruits should speak of if you really seen him you know and and and it's interesting because i think this whole pandemic has highlighted a lot of things the ministry of health would tell people put on masks sanitize social distance and people hearing it you know but when you drive something you've seen people and you're asking yourself didn't hear it after all these months it's not the announcement was it made yesterday at all there are still people who have heard it and they don't believe it and listen they're seeing other people doing it and that is not enough to convince them to at least make an attempt or even if they're making an attempt they're doing it in a half-hearted way what accounts for that difference because i'm trying to understand because because but the brandon would say he said i can preach that i'm blue in the face and it doesn't matter how much preaching is done until you take it in your heart and begin to do something about it what we see should put our souls into action so this whole message is continuing along a vein of getting into action because unto them that look for him because looking is active you look at him where is he where is he where is he it's like the wise men where is he we have come from afar we're looking for him we're looking for jesus and they caught the whole city unawares they have the book to have the teams but nobody looking for him meanwhile the wise man coming under expectation where is he where is he where is he we've been coming from a long way because we're looking for him something about him caught our attention and we want to meet him we want to see him we want to have an experience we have something for him we're not coming empty-handed but we bring in something because we know who he is oh hallelujah we know what he means oh i can imagine it to me he's king i brought gold to rapist and his majesty oh my my my my my i brought frankincense because of the service that he would do and it testified i brought my because he will die but meanwhile the whole spiritual capital as it were people going around normal god sent a prophet you read the book let's go through that coat and talk about the coat meanwhile there's a there's a cry let this be the cry this morning where is he this morning that same jesus i'm looking for him are you looking for him are you trying to find him did you bring something for him are you preparing for him oh hallelujah what gift did you bring to the lord did you bring worship did you consecrate yourself this morning did you consecrate your heart did you approach this as a as a real service even though you're in your home or you just got up and you're just relaxing taking in the service is that how you're looking for him he is judge he is king he is the high priest are you looking for him are you trying to meet him is that how you want to meet him but a random preacher would approach to god what's your approach this morning because if you see him and you recognize how close he is it should hasten your actions it will adjust your attitude because you recognize if you don't come in contact with him you're finished glory to god help us this morning lord help us help us help us help us he is holy and he promised to judge this world and to bring back man into his position that's not a casual statement that's a reward to the overcomers it's as a reward to the overcomers those who overcome the lust of the eyes overcome the lust of the flesh overcome living ordinary overcome just taking the bible as there's a book that's to to read but they overcome and they see that they have to add to their faith virtue and the virtue knowledge and the knowledge temperance and the temperance patience and the patience godliness and the godliness broadly kindness because you are looking at him you are seeing him you are seeing his nature you are seeing his being you are seeing his attributes and you want to talk like him that's why they take note they had been with jesus written epistles that's my promise is it yours if you see him then live it if you see him that acted yes you'll stumble along the way but make sure every day you are closer make sure every day he becomes clearer to you that the message of the hour becomes clearer to you as but over it said a few weeks ago to see beyond the filler material to see the message the real message see the gift because this message is a message of a gift it's a gift to an elect lady who has been promised to meet him but ibrahimovic the the engagement ring of predestination oh to somebody's engaged to him for an encounter with him oh i'm getting ready to begin to whining in a few minutes i trust is a blessing to you this morning and god is is is interrupting your home hallelujah as he's interrupting as he interrupted moses casual living we are living too casual i i hear and it's around the world if the world had taken this thing seriously earlier they said it would not have spread the way he did you know but people take it casual why is man like that why is only when the pressure reached so much that you're back against you all you're trying to do all you could do and it takes a forcing of legislation lock this door lock this down lock this down because that nature of man really not designed to comply with order when man fell out of god's order order was something that disappeared it became a struggle it became a battle to him and we see it in the natural how much more in the spiritual people come to church and they claim to see jesus because you can't be in this mess without having some kind of glimpse of who he is but then you can see who is really looking for him and who look at him once in a while he just glanced at him versus actively lord i'm sick in your face as the heart pant after the water broke so my soul stopped david was looking for him trust deep desire i don't want to be this way i want more of you i don't want to be how i was yesterday lord today today today is a different day i want to walk different i want to talk different lord i want to see you father don't pass me by i've heard you touch other people but don't don't pass me by lord looking for him look in them go to the scriptures lord speak to me through your word speak to me through the minister whoever it is speak to me lord i want to see you i want to i want to know you for myself i don't want to be a second-hand revelation but i said god doesn't have grandchildren so your father can't look for you you have to look yourself oh god help us this morning i'm getting ready to wind down but unto them then look for him i want to challenge you to look to jesus look to jesus look to jesus but if adam said o men and women tonight and i say today if you can look around and see how close we are to the coming of the lord you listen carefully now and this is to everybody now you who have put off the baptism of the holy ghost so but i brought him connected what you're seeing and what you're looking for to one thing put off the baptism of the holy ghost he didn't say put off reading the books put off attending church he said put off the baptism of the holy ghost if you could see how close we are to the coming of the lord so but i brought him and say he's coming he's getting closer he's getting closer and he's only trying to connect i want you to see the picture of it of people looking for him he said there's one over there looking for me there's one over there looking for me there's one over there who's on his knees looking for me he that one wants a visitation that one over there wants a visitation that one over there is hungering and thirsting after righteousness that one over there is sighing and crying for the abomination in the city they're looking for me to come to to to to to change things around it they're looking for me to come to to put this world back into position all these years sin has been allowed to operate but they are looking that's one over there there's one over there there's one over there there's one in that house oh bypass this one bypass this one look another one here and this healing angel is going around to put a mark upon those that sigh and cry for the abomination in the city anybody with me this morning anybody with me this morning you who have put off the baptism of the holy ghost you may be relied upon some sensation or something you've done that satan can impersonate you and can't have the real spirit in you to go all the way in god's promises that's why i keep saying the holy spirit the quickening power has to take you all the way in god's promises how can a man that claims to have the holy ghost deny one word of this bible being not right you cannot do it now listen i want to get to the home stretch now the musician could get ready listen to the prophet he's going on here now are you looking for him friends are you looking for him friends oh hallelujah he is my vaccine he is my comfort so i'm looking to him i have way more confidence i have full confidence that he who started the work in you and i is more than able to complete it i have confidence that he is able to preserve my soul he is able to preserve your soul he is able to preserve you until the day of your redemption oh that's my assurance this morning that's my confidence this morning listen to the prophet he goes on this is the same message this is in 1965. this is november the 27th this is just a few weeks before the prophet is taken and this is what he's preaching you know how i feel about last words no matter how religious you are how many churches you belong to how many books your name's on if that genuine holy ghost is in you which is the word manifested you'll see the message and here's the message so you'll see him and the hour because it's the holy ghost that does it but there has to be something light that off inspiration strike you and if you pour water on the ground on the ground on the ground and there's no seed in there to strike it how can it ever bring forth anything there's nothing there to bring forth that is only the elected of god will see it so i wanted to begin to rejoice right now because only the elected of god will see this thing that i'm talking about this morning it's not for everybody it's not for the church member it's not for people who believe because even the devil believes but it's the elect of god who there's a seed in their soul that deep seed in the soul and there's a deep calling so there's got to be a deep to respond and you're looking for him every day you recognize that he's getting closer so you don't want to miss him now you're looking for him so you don't want to you want to make sure that when you're going to work that you're on your job that you don't let it get so distracting for you oh come on now that you lose sight of him hallelujah you don't want the news the politics the internet to let you lose so you know when you switch things off is to make sure you see him oh my my i hope this resonates in your soul this morning the elected of god seen it in noah's time so what are we saying now it's a it's an election thing it's an election thing the elected of god seen it in noah's time moses time jesus time in other words think about it friends the pharisees who had the books they had the quotes they had moses words and they missed him but here's a man named peter oh a symbol fisherman he's not fully transformed yet but his name in the book oh he would make many mistakes he would even deny christ but he was predestinated to see him oh my oh my and he lived it out when peter stepped out under the boat he said lord if it is you bid me come oh he was looking at jesus he was looking at jesus but when he took his eyes off of jesus he began to to sink he had to keep his eyes on jesus and you have to keep your eyes on jesus the elected of god seen it in noah's time moses time jesus time the apostles time looters i'm reading the prophet luther's time wesley time pentecostal time this is 1965 i feel like shelton the prophet didn't just see his time but now we can see it and in this time whoa we see it we see the purpose of this great message we see who we are in the world we see jesus in the world we see him coming we see his appearing we see his signs we see his wonders we see his miracles we see a revival in our souls we see restoration time we see manifestation time we see our family being delivered time we see our sons being delivered time our daughters being delivered time and no devil could stop it no demon could stop it no principality could stop it oh hallelujah they have got to come as for me and my house we will serve the lord o glory to god my i'm trying to wrap up but this is this is too good i don't know if you're having a time in your home but i'm having a time this morning oh this is too good to know that god opened our eyes we didn't open it he opened our eyes he elected us to see who he is to see who we are to see who the devil is and to know that we are going to make it every day we wake up and we stretch and say thank god for waking me up today i'm going to get closer i want to see more of him more of him through his word more of him to the scripture more of him and he has not stopped revealing himself to us oh hallelujah god is still speaking you know oh oh oh the prophet in the days of the voice and we are in the days of the voice the mystery is finished but it doesn't mean god has stopped talking oh oh you don't hear me this morning god is speaking he's speaking this morning there are many men around the world god is speaking this morning to his elect lady oh hallelujah hallelujah and brother branham said i'll say what the tapes say oh he said let there come man who would make more sense to it it can make more sense to it unless god inspires it to be so oh it can be man's idea god is still speaking oh hallelujah glory to god he's still delivering he is still restoring he is still breaking the bands of sin and by the preaching of the word faith comes to destroy doubt and to destroy unbelief and to let you know your past is not going to determine your future your mistakes will not determine your future if god held peter's mistakes to him he would never be the apostle he is today if god held saul who became paul you understand the paradox of this a man who persecuted the church orchestrated stephen's murder and god said yes that's the one that's my name saul oh you might know him as saul but in my book his name is paul oh glory to god you might know his past but i know his future you might talk about his mistakes but i know what he will accomplish until he would share with timothy i've fought a good fight i've kept the faith i've finished my course i've stood the test i've done what god put in me to do and i've left it here for our elect lady who will pick it up through the scriptures and a prophet who will come who will quote these scriptures to prepare bride for the lord oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so i just want to try to close up here trust is a blessing with you the elected of god seen it in noah's time so the elect cannot miss it the elect will see it the elect will be the ones looking for him that's always i know who's serious about this gospel because something pulsates maybe maybe you have not been looking as you should but there's something pulsating in your soul telling you this morning do better look harder go look again but i branham in that same message look use the example of elijah and he said when he told that boy go look he said he came back down he said i didn't see anything in the same message when he read the same scripture and he told that boy go look again go look again go look again and that's why i said during the service young brother young sister i don't know who's connected we don't track who's connected to this service this morning but if you have ever lost your way with the lord maybe maybe maybe somebody threw you off maybe somebody did something and and you just was so disappointed maybe you were under church and something happened maybe something happened to you and i want to challenge you don't look at church don't look at man i want to challenge you to look again take another look at jesus take another look at jesus take another look at the word of god take another look at the word of god concerning you i know the plans i have for you good thoughts not thoughts of your destruction but thoughts of your perfection thoughts of your adoption because he's coming back he's coming back to those who are looking for him i believe this morning that throughout this connection there are many people who are looking to him i want you to lift your hands right now [Music] oh hallelujah but abraham went on now why are the inspirations poured out to gather the bride together it's only those who are elected will see it jesus said i thank thee father that thou has hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it to babe such as would learn and now inspiration has to strike it [Music] oh i have a prayer from the prophet with our heads bowed all over i want to challenge you lift your hands right now wherever you are don't look at me don't look at anybody next to you we're looking to jesus i need him to i need him more than yesterday i need him more more than anybody else make that your prayer lord i want to see you i'm tired of seeing man i'm tired of seeing my mistakes the mistakes of others i'm willing to go past it all i'm willing to go past my past i want you to stop looking at your past this morning stop looking at anything else oh hallelujah just look at jesus look at jesus look at jesus look at jesus oh hallelujah with our heads bowed we're gonna while you make your decision will you go all the way will he go all the way oh i'm trying to close out but i feel a pull this morning maybe you have been looking to jesus as you should and i want to connect back to the service i preached a few weeks ago have we done enough [Music] friends we have not done enough we've been guilty of allowing the distractions of the world to pull our attention [Music] in the days of noah i can imagine the children asking daddy are you sure have we done all we should do [Music] are we how we should be in other words have we done enough [Music] if you see him in his word this morning friends are you ready what else must we do has moses stood there giving the instructions to put the blood on the door i can imagine as the time will pass and they hear the screams coming down daddy are you sure did you do it the way moses said have we done enough [Music] friend when you see him it's impossible to hold an ought when you see jesus it's impossible to hold ought because there's so much he could hold over you but if branham would relate how he went into a restaurant i believe one time and he saw this young lady with all the makeup on you know the story and at that point he lost sight of jesus he lost sight of what jesus did for him he saw that lady there and say lord is this the world you want my daughter to grow up in this is the world my children would grow up in [Music] and thank god that god had a relationship with him that he could touch him and say come look look again look at your sins look at this bumper of protection look at whenever you make a mistake it hits this bumper look at where i am i don't see it don't lose sight of jesus friends drop your oats drop it drop it drop it walk closer to jesus this morning let it all go let it all go let it all go your past your mistakes whatever it is let it go this morning just keep your eyes on jesus and keep on walking just keep on walking if we were in this building no doubt this anointing would have an altar call in the church but you could have an altar call in your home right now look to jesus and walk to jesus his arms are open [Music] he wants to come to you he wants to come to anyone who is looking to him [Music] oh hallelujah [Music] oh hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah let's read this last quote friends [Music] and may this be encouragement to you as you hold on but i randomly asked the question have you done everything you know how to do if you have done listen now if you have done met every requirement you've repented of your sins you've been baptized and you've done everything you know how to do and it still looks like god don't answer now i'm going to ask you hold on just keep holding there god's on the throne he knows all about you [Music] if you've got condemnation in your heart if you can think of something you have done that you ought not to have done some little iniquity a little thing that you did that you shouldn't have done then i'd ask you to repent of it all over the church all over the connection this morning i want you to lift your hands repent of your sins repent of whatever you have done that you should not have done what you should be doing that you did not do and let us just pray every head bowed every eye closed as his presence as the musicians play oh heavenly father lord this little thought about looking to you looking to you as the author to finish looking to you as you died on the cross for us looking to you as you've gone to prepare a place for us looking to you as you have sent your prophet to speak to us so we can be ready to meet you oh god we have allowed ourselves to be distracted we have allowed ourselves to lose focus lord in the middle of this pandemic lord there's so much distractions and there's so much going on but more than ever we want to look at you more than ever we want to see you more than ever we want to cry out more than ever we want an experience a spiritual experience your hand is not too short to reach out to us you are not limited by the physical boundaries of church but right now father may you move into homes move into the houses of your people oh god may you touch me you heal may you deliver break the chains satan
