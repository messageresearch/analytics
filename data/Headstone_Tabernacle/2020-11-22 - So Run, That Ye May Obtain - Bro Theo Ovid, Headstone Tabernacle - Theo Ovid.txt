out of the way and speak to your people may we hear direct from heaven today jesus clean us up speak to us search our hearts lord take the sergeant knife and call it what's not like you and shape us and moles into your very image lord tonight father god and all the hearers of your word bless your service today bless all that will be done and said in jesus name we ask it amen god bless you and welcome and we want to go straight to the word of god your favorite bibles i'd like to turn to first corinthians chapter 9 we want to read from verse 24 to 27 we want to go also to philippians chapter 2 reading from verse 3 to 8 and luke 15 verse 11-13 this morning good to see all of you all tonight today it's good to be here so first coming just 9 24. know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiver the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that's traveling for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we are incorruptable i therefore so run not as uncertainly sulfite eye not as one that beats the ear but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection least that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a cast away and philippians chapter 2 reading for verse 3 let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man and his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be new which was also in christ jesus who been in the form of god taught enough robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of sinful men like likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross and our last scripture is from luke chapter 15 you want to read from verse 11 to 13. and he said a certain man are two sons the younger of them said unto his father father give me the portion of goods that followed to me and he divided into them his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there [Music] wasted his substance which practiced living let's pray one more time father we thank you we have read your scriptures lord and it's strange texts and what to be said this morning and what i believe you want me to share with your people may you bless it and interpret it to their hearts and lives that no one would leave you the same way they came bless those that are connected live and those that would hear the message afterwards and jesus might ask it amen name god bless you may have your seats oh praise god i have a title this morning so run that you may obtain so run that you may obtain so it's not what you do but it's how and i didn't want to put it as an inspiration but the underlying thought behind this is uh fighting the spirit of entitlement and complacency it's very odd but this is what we have to share this morning fighting the spirit of entitlement and complacency habakkuk said i will stand up on my watch and set me up on the tower and will watch to see what he will see unto me and what i shall answer when i'm reproved amen and the lord answered and said write the vision make it plain upon tables that he may run that reason it not walk stop walking start a run but to run you have to get to see the vision plane and you would understand why you can't walk you have to run why you have to be enthused about all these promises and why if you get entitled and complacent you it wouldn't do you no good you'll get messed up o pray is the name of the lord so the bible says for the vision is yet for an appointed time so that is why you have to run with patience the race that is set before you can't be frustrated and fed up they can't take it no more you have to understand as a race it's not a sprint because there is nothing swift it's not a sprint it's a race a long race a long distance have mountains and valleys and things to climb but there's a race that we must win and we have to run it a certain way oh glory to god you don't want to be in it to be also ran you have no price for also ram you have to run to obtain you have to run to get to the mark and to the goal and that's why paul said i forget the thing that i passed i press towards the mark of the high calling so you have to have ambition you have to have aim you have to have some kind of desire to take you above where you are and further than where you are if you're satisfied with where you are you are messed up because you have to have a fight inside of you because you're wrestling against flesh and blood the devil is not under quarantine let me say that again the devil is not under quarantine he's alive and well and doing as much mischief as he has always done oh glory to god and if he's not on our current senior could be in our spirit under quarantine we may wear masks and take social distancing but in our spirit we are shoulders of the cross oh glory to god we intend to run this ways to win not to also run oh give the lord a shout we need to aim high we need to climb higher because we were born for the skies as eagles do you believe that this morning but abraham amen had relaxed he said the very name ephesus was a strange compound meaning and relaxed the high aspiration of this age that had begun with the fullness of the spirit the depth of god whereby they were aiming at the high calling of god begin to give way to a less watchful attitude a less added following of jesus christ began to manifest itself as an omen that in the future ages the physical vehicle called the church would sink into the awfulness of the depth of satan it had begun relaxed and was drifting already the age was backsliding it has left his first love when the bible said in the last days the love of many gonna wax cold prophet said only among the elect will have love the love of men are going to wax call because of inequity iniquity is knowing to do right and doing wrong you know better than that oh he said rather you're hot or you're cold if you're called you know you're dead if you're hot you're on fire but because you look warm oh glory to god complacent entitled people entitled believers entitled church members see that god owe them something and they deserve better and they deserve more oh my lord complacency meaning self-satisfaction especially when accompanied by unawareness of actual dangers or deficiencies danger unaware walking about like you're foolish and simple instead of being wise the foolish versions they wasn't studying about the extra oil they had enough to have the lamp lit for a while but the energy and the backup to have extra oil they failed deal they didn't have the wisdom of revelation to get the extra oil well you are not here to enter the wreath you are not here to be also ran you here to win you're here to run with a goal and a purpose paul said it perfectly oh hallelujah complacency a feeling of smug or on critical satisfaction with oneself or one's achievements let me read it again a feeling of smug a critical satisfaction with oneself or one's achievement no an entitlement is a right to a particular privilege or benefit if someone has a sense of entitlement that means the person believes he deserves certain privileges and whatever you feel you are entitled to question who's supposed to pay for that yeah you know they talked about vaccine and the vaccine were given on free but you know what the vaccine is free you know somebody paying faith you know if the government pay for it give any people free but somebody paid they call the pharmaceutical companies not doing it for free they're doing for a whole lot of money so what we take as for granted as what we're entitled to somebody paying for it so let's talk about that political son oh give the lord a shout let's let's talk about this this young man oh give the lord a shout could we praise him this morning let's talk about this young man who felt he was so entitled that he had the right not to wait but to go to his father say father you see what you have for me i want it now what i am entitled to all right like that what he spiritually said administration he take the money he head out to a far country nobody can counsel him advise him teach him share with him he just burned the money down to the ground he even invested he opened my business with it he didn't work for it he didn't earn it but he could burn it that's the spirit of entitlement yeah i'm in it you didn't label for it but you could burn it that is why god have no spoiled children because you know the human spirit that's why when people win lotto and lottery and whatnot within three years all the money burned because they never earn it they don't know how to handle it and that is why god are just dropping blessings of character oh glory oh god help me this morning maybe you didn't come for this kind of message but we have it for you this morning we got it locked barrel wrapped and prepared for you this morning oh hallelujah that's why god is dropping the blessings of the character he said karate is a victory not a gift that's why all them preachers with this blessing until blessed be stressed and all who bless and bless have no character because they can't manage when god give them that's why god wants somebody to manage power he needs to see character he needs to see what you go through or see him in somebody oh hallelujah hallelujah so you see what entitlement is to that young man make him lose everything not just lose the money worse than that what entitlement does it make him lose himself because the power in what he didn't work for or what he didn't end give him a certain right he could flash in his friends and flush with his car and flush with his house and flash with his mouth and flush with everything until the money ran out when the money ran out be it shame pride mixture all together shaken together the big house that they thought he was living he was living in the band behind that he said i had a few clothes for me he was flashing so he could flush try that but the eaton and the dining was with knife and fork and tablecloth was with the pigs he lost fission he lost focus he lost a sense of direction and he was there in his comfort zone nobody knew but this big food it's so bad after all i had some ketchup left over had some pepper left over and he was going through that for a while and the bible said he came to himself [Music] you see sometimes god had to do things for you to come to yourself no man can do that for you you go through enough stuff to recognize your own failures your shortcomings and your mistakes and so on when you go through enough stuff you have to come to yourself and when you come to yourself nobody could take you away from the connection and the reconnection with your father oh glory to god he didn't have no sense of shame anymore he was stripped and he was ready to get back home but really want to go there you want to go forward hallelujah so all you who have rights and privileges and feel this and i feel you are entitled to who paying for that some children they don't care all the concern of it is what they need what they feel what their parents supposed to give them and some parents foolishly give them everything that they want call them spoil children i'll see if they take parents that cut your tail and put some licks on your life will cut your tail and put licks on you because it's not the way god raises his own children and if god will raise his children that way do raise yours that way because there'll be spoiled rotten breaths that's why the first church was an experienced church with fire holy ghost cleansing and as the church move on it gets less watchful people have less experience they come and join and they become members of the church and the church just went downhill because no fire was present because the people kept complacent in sports many times teams that win championship most times next time they fail and flop because why they they get relaxed they don't seem to need to push to stay on top and that relaxed and that entitled they tell themselves they're skillful they have a lot of skillful men and another group they tapping the ball they're doing this thing they practice it every single day and afterwards they come to the court and when championship does come they cut the throat of the other team that won what happened relax taking it easy entitlement is a false impression of feeling i deserve it and i deserve more it's a condition that people deserve something special or someone owes me something and when you don't get that you get upset you get angry you get angry because it doesn't fulfill the expectation of what you think that you are entitled to so this entitlement affects your spirit it affects your marriage it affects you on the job it affects everywhere because because of your thinking you speak certain things and your attitude goes out a certain way because of that spirit of entitlement do you believe that people say it's my money i could buy what i want that's true but then when you buy things above where you could manage and handle put your hat you're not very hungry or you put your hat up there and you have to pay for the height very heart rich and it's your money but you're writing a debt behind you so then you live in anger resentment and frustration because others are not responding to the way you think you deserve katamata straight out of ministers overseas rip him and he find like i was unfair but he was off and what he was teaching and preaching i had to tell him the truth he challenged people if he preached anything come and talk to him i decided to go and talk to him with the other ministers he didn't expect that he was shocked but this is what i will do you make your boss and see if it's stinging wrong let somebody come and talk to us good fine i'm coming because this is my father's word and i am standing with the word i told ministers to understand about them as long as they stay with the world i we we are friends we go work together and whatnot you know but i'm staying with this word friend or no friend i'm not looking for friends i want to stay with this because i know god going to ride in on this oh glory to god you saw that one up in america fight him to try to change the election because you figure he's entitled to be in that white house and the people vote him out already he gone and you don't even know it fired and still on the throne that's what i'm talking about you think people doesn't get fired in god's kingdom they do god tells samuel that's all you're crying about he fired a finer better man go to the house of jesse and anoint one of the sons of jesse i can't even tell you which is here just go oh glory to god god did himself tell samuel he gotta give him name and number he didn't tell him who it was he said just go to the house of jesse and when elijah come out and begin to walk time and say sure this is he god said no no no don't move that no no no fast not so fast not so fast the lord doesn't look at the external he doesn't look at height and complexion and color and skin and nation he doesn't look at that you look at the heart oh give the lord a shout glory to god he look at your heart yes you could fall here failure but he looks at the heart and when the salmon passed through all those brothers he said isn't there one more because i ain't got no witness of none of these guys here they say i want more his name is david he says send for david samuelson sitting down until that man come and david come on grateful david come here fix no clothes he didn't put on no cologne he didn't take a bath he come just as he was oh glory to god and that's how you come this morning give the lord some praises that is all going to bless you well you could humble yourself when you could shake off who you think you are and what you think you should get and what you think you deserve get out of that that is foolishness i don't care who have a better house than you that is nonsense nobody watching your house nobody watching your car don't forget about your dress nobody watching your mask oh glory to god or your wig or get out to that in the name of jesus oh god you could have whatever you have give me jesus this morning oh i want a revival in my soul this [Music] [Applause] morning [Applause] this morning you know yeah this is a mystery christ is a mystery of god reveal hallelujah we read about him you know oh glory to god hallelujah we read about him he survivor said he said who been in the form of god taught him not robbery to be equal but god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the lightness of men and being found in the fashion as a man if anyone was entitled with this man it was anyone entitled to be god was this man not was he only entitled but he was god but he shake off his entitlement and he put on a robe of flesh and he became one of us to walk among us to live among us to feel what you go through and to experience the pain oh glory to god of what you're going through this morning and some of you going through stuff this morning but he was wounded for my transgression he was bruised for inequities let's just time it over with pieces upon him and by his stripes oh you can be healed this morning not tomorrow this morning not next week this morning you can be healed not all in your body but in your spirit [Applause] and in your soul this morning the doctors can do for you god could do for you this morning what the doctors can't do god can do for you do you believe it [Applause] entitlement when one's supposed to leave they are they deserve a better life i am married for this who are mindful you forget evolution last time i remember is for better for worth richer for poorer do i hear amen sickness empower all poverty and riches did that do us but that did last time are here this thing we just read before people it's a change same thing do you take this woman to be do you take this man to be and forsake all others that's the last time i think we read that so where is the entitlement i deserve a better life i know we deserve ideas to go to hell but god rich and mercy [Applause] god choose to love me god choose to love you is not we deserve his love his choice he choose to call you oh glory to god that's why i'm going to praise him this morning i'm going to bless him this morning amen so something i was this thing struck me and it was so upon me i had to go and dig up in it wake up this morning i said entitlement brings complacency and it just come to me like a thought when i went on the internet to search about it it was right there entitlement brings complacency oh you have need of nothing and know it not you are miserable poor wretched and don't even know it because the spirit of entitlement people think because in this message that god owed them something is that right a prostitute could come here this morning and sit down there and get a healing because they have faith god has respected them because of prostitutes he respecting what faith inside your soul is not your law in the church some people long and they deserve because you agree here you're gray here you better that black camera because your gray hair ain't no special entitlement channel old man that's going to help you you know old man has gone to heaven too you know moses brought the generation out miracles upon miracles they know his god as soon as trouble strike get me water give me this they say the same god thank you lord hallelujah the same god that brothers of egypt will provide for us no they complain that the spirit of entitlement hey this this bread is too light there bake it they make it go jumping on fresh bread every manner every single day fresh from god's bakery but these rascals say this bear is too light the one whole wheat one the one whole grain manner entitlement we want meat retirees like bread god called a whole bunch of birds to fall become blue one meat look me take meat the tasty water water bitter they they will get bitter moses take a branch and put them in water water turns sweet that is us that is how we behave we forget yesterday what god did for us as far as we can say when things going good hallelujah we have a testimony glory glory glory when things get going bad or things going off we forget his faithfulness we forget his trueness we forget how we kept us come on peace back to me this is a different kind of service there's a little interruption there's a pastoral kind of stuff because this is what i get for you this morning because i want you to get on fire i wanted to get all complacency i want you to know you're not entitled you have to fight for it [Applause] [Music] when i see what paul said it shook me up did you get what paul said this is paul who met the jesus christ this is paul who met pilaf fire you can't see him in killer fire this is paul called to be opposite of the gentiles this is paul saying how he's going to run he's not running just to run he's running to obtain oh come on now when you feel entitled you just feel like you could take things for granted you plant a promoter tree pump city tree what you take for granted the insects and worms depend on the country them they're not taking for granted they're working and when you snoring sleeping they're working and when you're coming no it's big worm big bees big buzz whatever it is bugs because they're working so what i'm beginning to realize is not a matter of taking your salvation for granted is understand the support systems that god require for you to maintain and uphold your salvation your redemption your blessing and you can't take it for granted so paul said clearly the reason he buffeted his body and end up tough does the purpose of that say tough some people are too soft too soft the devil's you feel sorry for anybody he will kill a baby he will kill old people he kill everybody you know because he's trying to cut people off from breaking through we are about to break you i know it i'm speaking it [Music] you hear what i said but this spirit have to go so we are fighting it we got to fight it because you see this is not going to keep you back from pressing into the revival fire i am not no catholic priest i'm not bringing a wafer for you oh glory to god every one of you are priests unto god every one of you have to connect to god you're not connecting to god through me sorry maybe other pastors he could connect through that but not that not here when the veil was ran from the top to the bottom he showed you to have direct access [Music] [Applause] god forgive you then you have to forgive your own self when god forgive you some people don't want to forgive themselves so they end up in a pity party you know my lord today something that bunks up here two of the biggest challenges confronting workplaces in 2020 are complacency and entitlement while there are many external factors that can affect how someone feels and thinks complacency and entitlement are a direct reflections of one mindset amen pride which makes a person think more than himself more about himself or herself than what he actually is the bible specifically exhorted us let not amounting more highly so when your mind thinks you up dear oh jesus gave lots of parables you know he said when you invite your feast take this seat at the lowest table you see if your mind just tells yourself you're on and you're it and you're sitting on the high table they say if you take a city high table leave somebody more worthy than you comes no and they have to move you so if you take the lowest seat they could move you up but when you take the higher seat there's only one place to move you that's dung all these are principles of living let me say again all these are principles of living take the lowest seat let them promote you let them recognize you you're big oh sorry we didn't oh it's you sorry sorry and we could take you to your worthy seat and this is what somebody shared about a few examples of an entitled heart what was given to me was not what i [Music] deserved others are blessed easily but why am i still struggling i deserve more than them i deserve that job because i'm more efficient than that person since i've gone through a lot from my challenges i deserve to be more blessed by god i am deserved to be treated well i'm working hard for the church entitlement the fruits of entitled spirit dinner different to the spirit is the fruit of entitled spirit is comparison and that's me so canada i better than she like better than she ever comparison discontent disappointment opinionated false expectation from people and god jealousy and envy so what is to be an entitlement you can't rejoice with somebody who get blessed with something because you figure that should be amazing so you can the bible say rejoice with your brother rejoice with your sister rejoice you can't rejoice because you figure is that where they get there are you coming to so long i should i'll have a husband long time i should have wife long time i should that this is a long time ago look a long time and you go through all of that oh my praise god amen one of the breakthrough to all of this is to be grateful and to be thankful because complaining weakens your feet you hear what i'm saying complaining weakens your fate so you begin to thank god for the day i wake up in the morning you should see me sometimes my father says so i don't hold my back a little bit so i'm just pause the feeling straighten up i thank god i could straighten up there's some people who got straightened up but i straightened up i could make one step two step take my time but i'm getting there because they get older the bones creaking as they're going all the things happening but you're pressing on anyhow oh give the lord some praises this morning hallelujah you love him oh praise the name of the lord my god so don't focus on your own life baby said mind the things of others and it's get away from your selfishness get away from your ungratefulness because you know represent ungratefulness my god and when jesus healed ten lepers one only one came back you know what was jesus first response where are the other nine they went having fun one came back out of 10. god appreciate gratefulness are you grateful you see when you're grateful you're not going to be worried and stressed out about what's going to come because you're trying for what if god isn't if god healed you of uh um your foot was bend and your horse straight on your foot god could he lay your hand goku could heal other parts god bring you so far god could take care of you i'm not worried about people and i remember in kyogre with a few people as we pray for them pray for them pray for them i know god like a buddhism with 10 people and afterwards i say lord i commit them into hands after that never take them back i am not i am not your i am not your god god the god who start to work in you i want to think about that now not some church that'll be working you know no church called you you know is the god that start to work on you is able to finish it you receive the call of god upon your life the devil didn't call you god called you yes you went through this you went through that but god called you your backslide but god still called you the devil couldn't call you all who you for no you call that is why you could bounce back because there's a calling upon your life oh give the lord some praises oh glory to god you know what i said that is why it bounced back [Music] [Applause] this coronavirus going to knock out some and bring in some glory to god yes yes yes people are going to be delivered right under this corner virus god set it up that way oh glory to god that people be free oh glory because come hallelujah praise god amen [Applause] i'm not waking i'm not waiting for a woman president of america i'm not ready for that i'm waiting to see what's going to happen among god's people because i know what there's promise among those people and that's what i'm looking for so no my light is like a torchlight shine on this thing about complacency and upon uh um entitlement and i recognize that have to shake people's lives and homes they come like a husband saying they waiting for the wife to bring breakfast [Applause] somebody said don't go there do go there like i'm going somewhere but like i hit something like i hit some nail on the head but saying don't go there don't go there but down there already i already intend to go the halo but i don't hear already and the wife has her entitlement and the husband have his entitlement are you really entitled nobody grateful i'm alive i have strength i remember reading a story about a man who got fired from his job and he came back home all depressed and when his wife heard he got fired she took him one of the best news and make him feel like a winner and when she dropped that anointing in the house so the man remember but what if the wife said what will you do and she hold the the frying pan this way because you want to know before you lose your work what do you do and she berated man why are we gonna pay the bill and how are you gonna do with this and how are you there see that kind of wife this first wife you're talking about encouraging his husband and cook good food frame and what nothing she was inspired that is the kind of help bt want that's the kind of help which i want not money everything's fine when you're going through your stuff that you can get somebody to motivate inspire energize activate to make you feel to go out there and try again oh glory isn't this what the services do to you isn't this what the gospel does to you it helped bring you all to the the dumps to bring you on to the depression and frustration and tell you know what i could break out i could break through i could break the strong barrier i could get the way i want to go oh glory to god i'm not fighting the air i'm not beating or beating up there's nobody fighting you're not fighting you're not don quixote fighting windmill [Applause] glory though god you're fighting not against flesh and blood but against principles and powers my god i feel the devils backing up this morning we need a spirit of gratitude it cannot be that the trials block up not all what god have done for you you're so much you're so much in distress that you almost want to curse god that will the devil tell job tell god i'll make him curse you give me a crack at him and what the devil bring trials after trials after trump joe was real blessed everybody knew those were blessed only marketplace a fine words to the people but when he tries to come and hit him so the beginning was not too bad you know it was just drugs you see many boys come and his wife had to help him clean and then he had to kiss himself because afterwards she got tired but to show you the grace in that man he say you're she's like he's calling him dead maybe i'll get insurance afterwards but do something but but but but what's your grace upon job he said you speak like a foolish woman he knew he a minor foolish woman no foolish woman can be his wife god did not deem that god didn't set that up job job couldn't be where he was with all that kind of woman by him so he know his wife under pressure and under pressure he doesn't say the wrong thing so i want to ease the pressure so they can say the right thing could the sisters say amen brother say amen everybody see amen oh hallelujah so sometimes that ungratefulness is the source of one's own misery and people spread that misery ungrateful people are not only grateful to god but to their families and their friends and their coworkers and their neighbors they're gone faithful to the church leaders they're quick to judge condemn everyone who has fallen short of their standards now obama said anybody you see somebody given trouble in church i'm saying this wrong and that wrong and that offer that off nine out of 10 time is them off but they start something and they almost have a placard is everybody's fault they upset somebody driving too slow themselves sometimes you do fast your car please did you too hot this is too cold it bigger than the military to him to go just like a please tell somebody sometimes do you don't do your dumb don't you're damned i say do what i feel like to do because if i cater for people you would do don't do don't you just walk away so i just had to do what i feel like oh my so thanksgiving give a grateful heart and and when you come you're not thankful spirit you're not in that mean angry spirit you bless god for this brother let's go for this sister you get a new vehicle you get the new shoes you get a new tie hallelujah glory your to have a big hole in it that's wonderful halloween glory too retiring not going to heaven you are oh glory to god hallelujah praise god amen thank you lord jesus oh praise god amen so therefore you have to look at your own attitude start to examine how you are entitled how you believe you're entitled and focused on helping others amen now let's go all right so i trust that happens this morning i want to wear you out but but he says and we know that there's going to be a bride and there's going to be a wedding supper still in the skies that's as sure to be as god is because it is in his word and we know that those that are going to make up the bride is going to be in his church and they're going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle here we go and they have the material and earth now to make themselves ready if you notice she has made herself ready so many say if the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling or lying or stealing i'll save him that's up to you you got to do something too no this is not unbelievers they're not sinners this is believers this is christians who fighting with the devil and the flesh and the lusts and the desires and the ambition this is christians this is church folks he said you've got something to do too they don't overcome shall never all things didn't overcome you have power to do it that's number one you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready i like that word you see god could not push us through a pipe and pull us all the other end and say blessed he'd overcome it you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself oh glory to god hallelujah we have got to make a decision you making a decision to respond to what we have preaching this morning and to see how it could affect your life and impact upon your life isn't that right hallelujah so what god said to joshua says all dear he said the land was there and god gave it to them but they must fight for it and the same way it is about divine healing god has got the power to heal you if you got the courage to accept it but you'll fight every inch of the way so here we go now are you ready this is not entitlement this is right so god paid a price for you and he set it up this way that's not just sit down like relax are waiting for it no he sets it up that you fight for it [Music] it is yours with a fight [Applause] so what is your joshua every place you put your foot just yours but the line is yours every place you put your foot it's just like i take up my knuckles and spider see that mountain mines you know yeah kind of long distance view of it yeah put in a foot yeah put your foot at all you're crossing at all he says a good word good word preacher hallelujah you applying nothing this this word passed through your ears so push and pass indexes you have a straight pipe you apply nothing it's not affecting you infecting you this thing has to infect you this has to be like a virus this is the real virus the virus of the word when it hit your soul you're coughing up all unbelief unbelief coming and the fever getting it burning all kind of unclean spirits out of your it's everything in the heat it's not fever it's fire oh god give the lord some praises fire lock up in my boat [Applause] my god i want when you leave here you get infected infected by the word infected by the holy ghost infected by the power of god infected by the revelation of jesus christ oh glory to god you'll have a revelation of god not of this church of god hallelujah we must be willing to lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that has set before us he said today people want shortcuts i got elijah garment on i get this sarcastic devils how long do i got it they want the shortcut to heaven taking as much of the world as they can you can't take any of it there are no shortcuts you come the way of calvary you come the way of the brass altar you come the way of the prison slipper you die you actually die oh god why can't i say it right you die literally to yourselves you die to the king of the world and you are born on you oh glory to god there are no shortcuts they want to come right quick they don't want to grow we grow in the lord it takes growth and experience you can be born today and adopted tomorrow it takes growth and experience give another beer they will have a lion and then he faced goliath or give the lord a shout a first pull a second pull a purple or give the lord a shout in the house [Music] when when moses and all them trouble makers that follow moses of egypt it wasn't only elected people in a whole about three kind of believers and more all kind of believers but they said all of the lord said come with me i'm still reading that's right he opened the earth and sold them up they were good people too sure they were they were fine people fine people swallowed up yes but that didn't do it not all said lord lord but the ones that do it the will of my father not he that starts is c that finishes there are no short cuts you are disqualified at the end of the race so it's not running the race it's how you run you are no shortcut shaking hand joining church denomination or confessing confessing the message i'm a believer of the brother are you ever say but i believe too the bible babysitting never believes i'm tremble oh my hallelujah so paul paul says uh he said watch this is the amplified do you know that in a race all the runners compete but only one received the prize so run your race that you may lay hold of the prize and make it yours i love that run the race and lay hold of the prize and make it yours you have to want it as a possession [Applause] [Music] what we are preaching you have to want it as a possession as the owner of it you actually have it now every athlete who goes to training conducts himself temporarily and restricts himself in all things so what paul's saying now if you're going to training you have to come into discipline there's no training about discipline playing football well you practice when you want to practice it doesn't work so even waiting inside the america not cleaning the boots and shoes and you say what that had to do with i think is cleaning boots and shoes and making up your bed do you know that but somebody come inside and say but where are we fighting i woke up i want to fight the enemy but they start every morning better inspecting your dead makeup every single day every single day that's the routine you want for discipline you can imagine joshua is a bunch of people in this message when i bring you the show shout and somebody feeling led break the rhythm of the spirit everything fall down nothing jericho was i'm straight because you're breaking the order of the spirit you have to follow the orderly spirit because joshua heard from god and then if we hear from god you will get the supernatural instructions so paul said so paul was saying no every athlete who goes into training conducts himself temporarily restricts himself in all things they do it to win a wreath that will soon wither but we do it to receive a crown of eternal blessedness that cannot wither therefore here we go here we go therefore i do not run uncertainly without definite aim i do not box like one bit in the air and strike him without anniversary but like a boxer like a boxer i buffet my body i handle it roughly i disciplined my hardships and subdue it for fear that after proclaiming to others the gospel and things pertaining to it i myself shall be unfit not stand the test be unapproved and be judged as a counterfeit so you know what paul was saying here i am not seeing myself as entitled i hope you see that this morning so paul wasn't under the spirit of entitlement or had the sense of entitlement so he couldn't be complacent so he brought himself in order to keep what he got and to strive and run correctly or give the lord some praises paul could i rock back and said i'm an apostle i am a dis i am a doc paul could i rock back on all of that he did not he said the reason i'm doing this because he said because he's like a box i buffered my body handed roughly disciplined by hardship and chopped jewett for fear that after proclaiming that others the gospel and things pertain to it i myself should become unfit oh my hallelujah ephesians 4 amplifies to let him the team steal no more like thieves and children rather than be industrious making an honest even in his own hands let no foul or polluting language or evil word who should do it for you that is your mouth that you come out your mouth but only such speech as in good and beneficial to the spiritual progress of others as is fitting to the need and occasion that it may be blessing and give grace to the fever to those who hear it oh my and then there's other scripture this is a colossians chapter 3 verse 5 mortified therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication on cleanness inordinate affection evil conspiracies and consciousness which is ideology for which things shake the wrath of god comment upon tyrion of disobedience oh my colossians 3 amplified say so kill deaden or deprive of power that same scripture we just read this is the amplified of it kill deaden or deprive of power the evil desires looking in your members whose animal impulses and all that is earthly in you that is employed in sin sexual advice impurity sensual appetite unholy desires and all greed and consciousness for that is idolatry the define of self and other created things instead of god oh my i'm almost finished museum could come up please but i branham said this i'll be at the home stretch here he said he never found a better way for a baby to get what they want than cry if you give him a bell i said junior you're only three days old when you want a bottle raise up ring the bell it will not work the baby christ what it wants and that's god's provided we right gods recommend this for his children god recommend this for his believing children he did not intellectual speeches some great theology to teach he wants you to cry for your needs that's right cry out for it he said don't be stiff and starchy oh god bless men jesus hallelujah when you go home we are meeting on the zoo monster that time you could lock the door and cry out you know cry for it call for the lord i need it oh hallelujah i've got to have it he said watch watch he says now how long does a baby cry until he gets satisfied that's the way the believing christian should do god's child if you see that god made his promise don't give it up cry till it's answered cry till you see god vindicate his word and when god finished his word and prove it's here then you don't have to cry no more you got it walk away and thank him for it until you do that scream out till you get it persistent and holding on not a hybrid punch a real genuine article of god they fight for every position they fight till they are finished on this earth oh gloria go say the devil coming for me and and build my box fight to the very end hallelujah you see every place the foot of the soul of your feature i'll try the pun that have i given to you fight for every inch so do we fight for every inch if it isn't something to be babied and petty the wrong like that come here we go come with determination come that you are going to stay there till it's over musicians come up please stay there till god answers and vindicates a man that believes in god can see the presence of god feel the presence of god sense the presence of god know he is here and he is here to answer everything that he made promise for that day oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah glory thank you jesus i'm finished hallelujah grateful is when you focus on the good in the situation hallelujah what others have done and aware how you are benefited that's when you're grateful when you are ungrateful is when you are unaware of the particular the situation what others have done and how you are benefited amen my so you basically take it for granted completely unaware you're doing so and there's another word called ingrateful this is when you focus on the negative of the situation believing that others have acted to harm you oh my disregarding or discounting any benefits you have received as inconsequential oh my hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of this just worship the lord oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord jesus blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah

father oh blessed be the name of the lord hosanna hosanna hosanna hosanna alleluia oh glory glory glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what an astonishing humility of paul what astonishing humility that he could say i buffet myself i bring my body in subjections because i fear that i be a cast away having preached this gospel friends the bible talk about working your own salvation out with fear and trembling it's nothing to take lightly he came unto his own he don't receive them now these people were so arrogant when jesus began to preach the ball all sign has hit man in the wilderness and jesus sent everyone dead and that dead is eternal separation from god he said moses saw my day this was my day before ibram was i am. friends this is serious the people that he was supposed to come to and receive and rejected him amen the so-called elected people and israel and had the covenant and all the history behind them they rejected the christ and it gave the opening for us gentiles to receive him do you see now how easy it is for god to reconnect with the jews and go to call out 104 000. begin to play something oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah repent of your ungratefulness repent of your entitlement repent of your complacency and ask god to set your soul on fire and forgive you for not being thankful and not being grateful
