[5:50] hearts and lives in Jesus name I ask it
[5:54] amen God bless you hallu if have bibl I
[5:57] to turn to Luke chap 8
[6:00] reading from verse 11 to1 15 and Romans
[6:03] chapter
[6:04] 8 Luke 8 and Romans chapter 8 scripture
[6:09] reading tonight
[6:17] hallelu I know we took the scripture
[6:19] from Matthew 13 in the camp but I want
[6:22] to take it from Luke chapter 8 I'm doing
[6:25] that on
[6:28] purpose
[6:30] we read from verse 11 now the parable is
[6:33] this the seed is the word of God those
[6:35] that by the ways side and they that hear
[6:37] then cometh the devil and taketh away
[6:39] the word out of their hearts least they
[6:40] should believe and be saved they on the
[6:43] Rock a day which when they hear receive
[6:45] word with joy these have no root which
[6:48] for a while believe and in time of
[6:49] Temptation fall away and that which fell
[6:52] among torns the they which when they
[6:54] have heard go forth and are choked with
[6:57] cares and riches and pleasures of of
[6:59] this life and bring no fruit to
[7:03] Perfection but on good ground are they
[7:06] which are in an honest and good heart
[7:09] having heard the word keep it and
[7:11] bringing forth fruit with patience I
[7:14] want you to note the word patience there
[7:15] bringing forth fruit with patience and
[7:18] we want to turn to Romans chapter 8 want
[7:21] to read from verse
[7:23] 28 it reads and we know that all things
[7:27] work together for good to them that love
[7:29] God to them who are decalled according
[7:31] to his purpose for whom he did for know
[7:35] he did predestinate to be conformed to
[7:37] the image of his son that he might be
[7:39] the first born among many Brethren amen
[7:41] so that's what Jesus supposed to be the
[7:43] first born among many Brethren amen
[7:46] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[7:48] he also called whom he called them he
[7:50] also Justified and whom he justified
[7:53] then he also glorified what shall we
[7:56] then say to these things if God before
[7:59] us who can be against us he that spared
[8:01] not his own son but delivered him up for
[8:04] us all how shall he not with him also
[8:07] freely give us all things who shall lay
[8:10] anything to charge of God's elect it is
[8:12] God that justified who is he that
[8:14] condemn it it is Christ that died he
[8:16] rather that is risen again who is the at
[8:18] the right hand of God who also maketh
[8:21] intercession for us who shall separate
[8:23] us from the love of Christ shall
[8:25] tribulation or distress or persecution
[8:27] or famine or nakedness or peril or sword
[8:30] for it is written for thy sake we are
[8:32] killed all the day long we are counted
[8:34] as sheep for the slaughter n in all
[8:36] these things we are more than conquerors
[8:38] to him that loved us for I'm persuaded
[8:40] that neither death nor life nor angels
[8:43] nor principalities nor powers nor things
[8:45] present nor things to come nor height
[8:47] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[8:50] be able to separate us from the love of
[8:51] God which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[8:54] let's pray father how we thank you for
[8:55] your word tonight and we are so blessed
[8:58] Lord to hear these powerful scrip and I
[9:01] pray father God that your presence will
[9:02] just have the pinenes and may your word
[9:04] come to light and life tonight in Jesus
[9:06] name I ask it amen you may be seated
[9:08] hallelujah oh praise God blessed be the
[9:11] name of the Lord hallu
[9:14] hallelujah praise God glory and uh I
[9:19] will take a little inspiration from uh
[9:22] Ecclesiastes 3 verse1 to everything
[9:24] there's a season and time to every
[9:27] purpose under the heaven and I'll
[9:29] connect that to Romans 8:28 and uh I
[9:32] have a title the manifestation of your
[9:34] season and time to fulfill your purpose
[9:39] Hallelujah the manifestation of your
[9:41] season and time to fulfill your purpose
[9:46] amen amen oh praise God so don't be too
[9:50] uh anxious you have to have patience yes
[9:53] sir that that seed going to come ripe
[9:56] and mature in the camp I wanted to
[9:58] emphasize 30 fold 60 fold 100 fold to
[10:02] show that once the seed strike good
[10:04] ground it will bring forth am it might
[10:07] bring to the measure of you know of of
[10:09] 100% but it be 30 it'll be 60 you'll get
[10:12] your measure you will get your Harvest
[10:14] Hallelujah but tonight I want to kind of
[10:16] emphasize that patience because the
[10:19] Bible talk about the husband man waited
[10:21] for the fruit of the earth and he had
[10:23] long patience you see when you plant
[10:26] something you can't be so excited to try
[10:28] to pull the fruit out of the tree the
[10:31] fruit have to unfold the life have to
[10:33] unfold and the fruit will come in due
[10:35] course now if you don't plant you don't
[10:38] reap if you don't plant you have no
[10:40] Harvest but if you plant you have to
[10:42] wait for somebody say Amen you have to
[10:46] wait as we said the sewing for to sew
[10:48] and as he keep sewing the birds take
[10:50] some we say don't stop at the birds
[10:52] don't let the birds Show You Off Track
[10:54] that bird is just that's what they do
[10:56] they take some they can't take all some
[10:59] fall among rocks not all will fall among
[11:00] the rocks just some will fall among
[11:02] rocks isn't that right some will get
[11:04] tired with torns just some not all but
[11:07] some will fall on good ground so your
[11:09] duty is to keep on sewing Keep On
[11:11] Believing keep on planting keep on
[11:14] pressing all might hold tonight but some
[11:16] going to hold someday someday something
[11:19] going to strike you something going to
[11:20] open up something going to break upon
[11:22] you Revelation going to break upon you
[11:24] you don't know when tonight may be your
[11:26] night tonight may be a special night you
[11:29] could make this a special night if you
[11:30] declare to be so you have to speak it
[11:33] first like that man who was half blind
[11:35] and they want know what room to take him
[11:36] in he said this room will be perfect
[11:38] they describ say how you know he said I
[11:39] make it so praise God and you could make
[11:42] this night your night because you choose
[11:44] it to be so you declare it to be so
[11:47] that's what our father did he said let
[11:48] there be he didn't argue with the
[11:50] darkness he didn't say do chaos and he
[11:53] said let there be and he just waited
[11:55] until it be praise God he waited for the
[11:58] season and time because once God said
[12:00] let their beat have a season and time
[12:02] for that seed to come to life but every
[12:04] seed must bring forth after it's kind
[12:07] it's a law built in built in just like
[12:09] summer is built in and Autumn is built
[12:12] in and winter is built in and spring is
[12:14] built in and nobody could stop the
[12:16] season and time because God said that in
[12:18] the heavens and man is on Earth and they
[12:21] can't change what God Said in the
[12:23] heavens and thy word oh Lord is settled
[12:25] forever in the heavens and once that
[12:27] word is settled man on Earth cap change
[12:29] so once God predestinated you unto his
[12:32] purpose and has all things work together
[12:35] for good to them that love God to them
[12:37] who are be called according to his
[12:39] purpose and if you are called according
[12:41] to his purpose I don't care what road
[12:43] you have to pass you through I don't
[12:45] care what way he have to pass you
[12:47] through you're going to come through
[12:49] nothing going to separate you from the
[12:51] purpose that God elected you and
[12:53] predestinated you nothing will to
[12:55] separate you from the love of God in
[12:58] Christ Jesus not tribulation not
[13:00] nakedness not poverty not depression not
[13:03] frustration not family issues not mind
[13:06] battle not even sin praise God because
[13:09] who he found you he called and who he
[13:11] call he justified what more shall we say
[13:14] tonight of these things if God be for us
[13:18] who can be against us it's time you
[13:21] recognize God is for you can somebody
[13:24] say can somebody give a shout of Praise
[13:27] You see how the Holy Spirit all together
[13:29] to everything there's a season and time
[13:32] to every purpose give God a shout of
[13:39] Praise hallelujah oh
[13:42] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[13:45] Hallelujah
[13:46] Hallelujah glory to God Amen it's a
[13:50] powerful thing to
[13:53] plant and Watch The Life
[13:56] unfold Hallelujah so if God want to show
[14:00] down the devil's Kingdom he just have to
[14:03] put in a seed a virgin shall
[14:07] conceive you didn't hear me tonight when
[14:10] he wanted to destroy and wreck the
[14:12] devil's Kingdom he had to put the seed
[14:15] so he said a virgin shall conceive and
[14:17] be a child his name Shall be Called
[14:19] wonderful counselor Everlasting father
[14:23] Prince Mighty God Prince of Peace what
[14:26] God did he put a seed in in there his
[14:29] womb hallelujah hallelujah to booze that
[14:33] devil Hallelujah to knock that Si's head
[14:35] isn't that right he put the seed a Manch
[14:38] child Christ Jesus and when he want to
[14:40] send a a message in this day to bring a
[14:43] Revival in this day all you have to do
[14:44] is to put a seed he said the bride had
[14:47] no Revival is here it will take them
[14:49] seven Thunders and he will send it he
[14:52] promised he just have to put a seed oh
[14:55] come on say Amen somebody and when God
[14:57] took the prophet off the devil thought
[14:59] it was cut off but he s an apostle
[15:01] behind the prophet to keep putting on
[15:03] that se some fell on the way side some
[15:06] fell on the Rocks some walk away but
[15:09] some fell on good ground I feel tonight
[15:12] that that spoken word which is the
[15:14] Original Seed has found some good ground
[15:16] in
[15:17] Trinidad oh Hallelujah I believe tonight
[15:20] we are ready for the rain I believe

[15:39] that when you raise your hands up to God
[15:42] to worship you understand what you're
[15:44] doing when you raise up your hands to
[15:46] God to worship you are really Watering
[15:49] your seed you have no excuse right now
[15:52] tonight you are breaking into Revelation
[15:55] the same camel that Rebecca watered was
[15:58] the the same camel that took up to Isaac
[16:01] and the same word we are watering
[16:04] tonight is the same power that going to
[16:07] take us to where we supposed to go so
[16:09] you better start worshiping you better
[16:11] start forgetting your problems and
[16:13] forgetting your situation and trying to
[16:15] figure out and begin to praise God and
[16:17] join them in the Revelation chapter 5
[16:20] when they say wory is the Lamb for that
[16:22] was redeemed us from now that thy blood
[16:25] when we shall rain on the earth God
[16:27] don't care about your problems this
[16:29] morning he care about your Praises
[16:31] because your Praises will bring the
[16:33] water to water the seed in you and that
[16:36] will solve your problem come on say Amen
[16:39] somebody stop studying the problem study
[16:42] the seed come on say Amen somebody oh
[16:45] give the Lord some
[16:49] Glory
[16:51] Hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah
[16:54] hallelujah hallelujah and as we grow in
[16:57] God
[16:59] and grow in Grace it will become
[17:01] simpler and
[17:04] simpler not more complex no it become
[17:07] very simple brother B said it is way
[17:10] from Genesis to Revelation could be
[17:12] described as word made
[17:13] flesh full step word made flesh God want
[17:18] to get something done he have to put a
[17:20] seed he can't help it because it's word
[17:22] is taught expressed his thinking have to
[17:25] be expressed by word and once his word
[17:28] is seed so but the Brandon preacher M
[17:31] spoken word is Original Seed it have
[17:34] contrary seed I we see them Cor in
[17:36] America you all you can do is eat it you
[17:39] can't SE it back because his man that
[17:41] man tamper with that and once man tamper
[17:44] with that it corrupt I we say once
[17:45] you're born of a woman you're subject to
[17:47] death you have no promise or anything
[17:49] else but death unless it comes to the
[17:52] Rapture time when you're going to be
[17:53] Chang in a moment and that's what we all
[17:55] looking forward for and if it's not us
[17:57] it's somebody else
[17:59] but for the meantime we under the law of
[18:00] debt isn't that right but we have life
[18:02] within us by the word now you can only
[18:05] overcome by the word you can't overcome
[18:07] by ethics by education by degrees you
[18:10] can only overcome by the word not by
[18:11] philosophy not by TV you only overcome
[18:14] by the word so the devil his job is to
[18:16] keep you away from the word isn't that
[18:18] right but to be bride you have to accept
[18:21] the atonement in his fullness which is
[18:23] the fullness of the word and once you
[18:25] accept the fullness of the word it means
[18:26] that you have to be born His Image you
[18:28] come into the fullness of his image
[18:30] which is his image and likeness he not
[18:32] only predestinated you but unto a
[18:33] purpose who he found he call who he call
[18:36] he justified who is Justified he ha
[18:37] already glorified isn't that right isn't
[18:39] that right blessed be the name of the
[18:42] Lord watch he predestinated what to be
[18:45] conformed to the image of his son so in
[18:49] reality you are to be M you have to
[18:52] manifest the word image you have to come
[18:55] into the word image in other words you
[18:57] have to become the word to be
[18:59] bride Hallelujah all else is just church
[19:02] members ah Glory oh this is good this is
[19:06] very good all else is church members you
[19:09] understand Abraham had ishma too that's
[19:11] right not only Isaac you understand that
[19:13] ishma have a great generation nation and
[19:16] so all the Arabs and all them all is
[19:18] Abraham C too but true ishma Hallelujah
[19:22] they still fighting today Isaac versus
[19:24] ishma the battle is on so it will be
[19:26] Bride versus church members yeah
[19:28] [Applause]
[19:31] so you can't study the church members
[19:33] you have to want to be born into
[19:35] manifestation to be
[19:38] bride hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[19:41] are you with me
[19:43] Glory do you understand that the 144,000
[19:48] are elected seeds that are the
[19:50] generation coming from
[19:52] Abraham that God recognize out of
[19:54] different tribes how do God seeing the
[19:57] generation after generation he know them
[19:59] by name he said 10,000 from this tribe
[20:02] 10,000 from that tribe
[20:04] 10,000 144,000 by
[20:08] name oh Hallelujah notice when people
[20:11] are called they are called by name who
[20:13] he form you he call he call you my name
[20:16] but not your literal name is the mystery
[20:18] of the book being unfolded to you that

[20:56] wrong when one person wrong get a wrong
[20:58] message the whole family have a wrong
[20:59] message because there's no Revelation
[21:02] there but when you understand that you

[21:07] and Revelation is the rock that he build
[21:09] his CH upon then you can't bother what

[37:14] Spirit you you start to trust God my
[37:16] trust is in you why because you're trust
[37:18] in yourself all the time listen to this
[37:21] from per perfect this is brother brandom
[37:23] he's praying he said there may be some
[37:25] here this morning Lord that has
[37:28] emptied themselves up okay let me back
[37:31] up a little bit he said now and there
[37:33] may be others out into the land where
[37:35] these safes will go where little humble
[37:37] women and men will take them into the
[37:38] homes and into the tribes out into the
[37:40] other lands may they hear Lord and
[37:42] understand empty themselves up so that
[37:44] the Holy Spirit can fill them and there
[37:46] may be some even here this morning Lord
[37:48] that has emptied themselves up since we
[37:50] started speaking and has listen and has
[37:53] realized that they have trusted too much
[37:55] in their own thoughts
[37:57] of their own ability trusting in the
[37:59] shrewdness of their own simple human
[38:02] mind which is nothing but filthiness
[38:06] before God oh God may they just empty
[38:10] themselves out now humbly submitting
[38:13] themselves and come for the filling of
[38:15] the spirit amen granted Lord amen you
[38:18] see the thing about it along long life's
[38:21] journey along the way what had happened
[38:23] is that people leave the Holy Spirit and
[38:26] they begin to use the cunning of their
[38:28] own mind and that bring out spirit and
[38:31] man Church politics so then people begin
[38:34] to be manipulative and controlling
[38:37] because they want influence but it end
[38:39] up being man's influence and not God's
[38:43] influence so then what end up happening
[38:46] is that the influence of the Holy Spirit
[38:48] become placed upon man and then now that
[38:51] man become a pope eventually then all of
[38:54] God's presence that's supposed to be
[38:55] among the people people end up Upon A
[38:58] man that become Antichrist Spirit isn't
[39:00] that right but God is a god of the
[39:02] audience so he want to release his
[39:05] Spirit among the people because he want
[39:09] to manifest himself as the god of his
[39:11] people now remember ministers supposed
[39:14] to be servants Hallelujah not power mad
[39:18] people supposed to be servants we
[39:20] supposed to put on the apron and bring
[39:22] the big tree to serve you it's not we
[39:24] are the important people you are
[39:27] We Are The Messengers to bring message
[39:29] to you hallelujah praise God maybe you
[39:33] get that anybody could be a minister
[39:35] toct scriptures and read scripture but
[39:38] very few going to be servants and God
[39:41] show me that since in Kyo it take a
[39:43] certain quality to be a servant a
[39:45] servant comes to serve not to be served
[39:49] and Jesus said the son of man come to
[39:51] serve not to be served and that's why in
[39:54] feet washing you have washed one 's feet
[39:57] to show that you're humbling one towards
[39:59] the other and Jesus is the one that
[40:01] washed your feet
[40:02] first and when Peter declined he busted
[40:04] Peter he said if you David don't let me
[40:06] do this you don't part of me praise God
[40:08] because the son of man not come to be
[40:09] served but to serve you understand that
[40:12] so you are very important to
[40:15] God why would a King die for
[40:19] you why would a King die for you and
[40:21] send Messengers to give you love
[40:25] letters
[40:26] Hallelujah every service is a love
[40:29] letter praise God every service is a
[40:31] word from God if it could State me out
[40:34] of the way and recognize wait a minute
[40:36] what is that man saying to me no what is
[40:39] God saying to you God have to use
[40:41] somebody he has to use a man Hallelujah
[40:43] could I find a man that I could pull out
[40:46] of the way that I could influence my
[40:49] people then you are influenced by the
[40:52] word then you are influenced by God then
[40:55] you no longer govern by human
[40:58] spirit that tra you into your own
[41:03] thing but you break out you break out
[41:06] where all things are possible hallu when
[41:08] you begin to believe all things and and
[41:10] hope all things and Hallelujah you're
[41:13] not trying to interpret somebody have a
[41:15] different motive and objective no you
[41:16] believ in all things and you're hope in
[41:18] all things and you're enjoing all things
[41:20] charity never fail it oh the devil don't
[41:23] want us to get told you know oh yeah we
[41:26] slam one another and talk we have
[41:28] forgiveness and brotherly kindness only
[41:29] just talk M just yapping yapping yapping

[1:01:45] escaped the Bible said he'll make war
[1:01:48] with the remnant of the woman's seed
[1:01:51] that is church members who haven't come
[1:01:54] into a manifestation all they have is
[1:01:57] intellectual they haven't come into the
[1:01:59] oil you see so one part is the water
[1:02:04] spirit another part Spirit oil wise
[1:02:09] virgin
[1:02:10] Hallelujah they have the seven
[1:02:13] altars they have the sacrifice but no
[1:02:17] oil the strange thing about this oil and
[1:02:20] we're going to call this oil charity the
[1:02:22] oil of Charity Hall
[1:02:25] to get
[1:02:26] charity it needs faith and that faith is
[1:02:30] based
[1:02:31] on forgiveness Hallelujah so therefore
[1:02:34] to access the
[1:02:37] Skylight you have to come true brotherly
[1:02:40] kindness watch not people brotherly
[1:02:45] kindness no Spirit of Brotherly kind
[1:02:49] Hallelujah so God has to allow people to
[1:02:54] do you
[1:02:57] wrong that's the only way for that to
[1:03:00] come
[1:03:01] forward God has to let people push you
[1:03:03] around and if you fight it I want nobody
[1:03:06] push me WR I let yeah yeah I want people
[1:03:08] to I want to push WR I want to see push
[1:03:10] you could
[1:03:12] take because only the person who God
[1:03:14] could push around God could
[1:03:15] [Applause]
[1:03:18] use you see some powerful things tonight
[1:03:21] yeah could God push you around or are
[1:03:23] you like a bulldozer am moving well God
[1:03:26] will move around
[1:03:27] you that's right that's right cuz you
[1:03:30] were moving and God want to move you to
[1:03:33] do the job you see you see you see when
[1:03:36] David was in the backside and dealing
[1:03:38] with the bear and the lion that's David
[1:03:40] experience God want to move him from the
[1:03:42] back side to the front side David right
[1:03:45] now on the back of the
[1:03:47] book cast send me back all the
[1:03:49] time you understand me that's why he
[1:03:52] take from the back and put it on the
[1:03:53] seventh fold on under the in the seven
[1:03:55] seal so he put the tunders on the back
[1:03:57] he put it in front but hide it from the
[1:03:59] devil so then move David now from the
[1:04:02] back and bring him to the front to Ser
