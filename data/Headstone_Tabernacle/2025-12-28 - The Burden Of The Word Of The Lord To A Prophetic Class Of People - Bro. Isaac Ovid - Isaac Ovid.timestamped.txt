[38:29] [Music]
[38:31] Hallelujah.
[38:42] One more time.
[39:07] Lord praise.
[39:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[39:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[39:16] Are you happy to be in the house of the
[39:17] Lord this morning? Are you happy that
[39:20] you made it to the end of another year?
[39:23] By his grace and his mercy, by his love,
[39:27] by his goodness, by his
[39:39] gracious heavenly father, we thank you
[39:40] this morning
[39:45] of pray
[39:49] and training and teaching and healing
[39:53] refuge, a house of peace, a house of
[39:55] safety, a house of God's bread, a house
[39:58] of comfort, Lord, a house where we can
[40:00] come and we can leave different than the
[40:03] way we came. Whenever we come into your
[40:06] presence, we either leave better or we
[40:09] leave, but we never leave the same way
[40:11] that we came. Heavenly Father, we leave
[40:14] this house, Lord, not just change, but
[40:16] change for the better. Change in the
[40:19] inner man, not just change in our
[40:21] feelings, our emotions Lord just to feel
[40:24] good about ourselves but something on
[40:26] the inside that Lord a new creation has
[40:29] been activated the seed in us has been
[40:31] quickened to life by the word of God
[40:34] that comes in contact with the spirit of
[40:36] God father we thank you for the grace
[40:38] and the mercy that you have Lord placed
[40:41] upon us and we thank you in advance for
[40:43] the healing that's about to take place
[40:46] breakthrough that's about to take place
[40:48] deliverance that's about to take place
[40:51] that are to go free because that's what
[40:54] you came to do. To set the captives free
[40:56] to Lord to put that liberty them that
[40:58] are bound to loose the bands of
[41:00] wickedness and break the shackles that
[41:03] have held the people back, Father. Lord,
[41:05] and as we come to the end of another
[41:07] year and prepare for a new year, Father,
[41:09] Lord, where your word teaches us to
[41:11] forgetting the things that have passed
[41:13] and to look to the things that up ahead,
[41:15] Father, we come to your house, Lord, to
[41:18] Lord, for this final service of 2025 of
[41:21] last Sunday as it were of the year.
[41:23] Father, we give you glory. We give you
[41:25] honor to your holy name in the precious,
[41:27] marvelous, wonderful name of the Lord
[41:29] Jesus Christ. And the church says,
[41:31] &gt;&gt; and the church says,
[41:33] &gt;&gt; amen and amen. You may be seated for a
[41:35] few minutes in the presence of the Lord.
[41:38] And certainly want to greet you, greet
[41:40] one and all in the precious name of
[41:42] Jesus Christ. And it's certainly a
[41:44] privilege to be in the land of the
[41:46] living.
[41:48] It's not something to take for granted.
[41:50] It's not something that you could take
[41:52] casually because there are many people
[41:54] did not make it to this point. They
[41:55] didn't make it to this day. They didn't
[41:57] make it to this month. They didn't make
[41:58] it to this year. But God through his
[42:00] grace and mercy has seen it fit that we
[42:03] would be counted worthy to be present to
[42:05] see what we see and to hear what we hear
[42:07] and to be a part of what God is doing in
[42:09] this season and this hour. So we want to
[42:11] just give the Lord a hand of praise and
[42:13] thanksgiving that he who has started the
[42:16] work in us is more than able to bring it
[42:18] to pass to bring it to completion. He
[42:20] said, "I know the plans I have for you,
[42:22] the thoughts I have for you to bring you
[42:24] to an expected end. It's an end that is
[42:26] expected. He knows the expectation of
[42:28] the end before you were even born. He
[42:30] had an expected end in mind of how you
[42:32] should look when you leave here. How you
[42:34] should look when you come to the house
[42:35] of God. How you should look when the
[42:37] Holy Spirit comes upon your life.
[42:40] I want to greet one and all and salute
[42:42] one and all by the grace of God. It
[42:44] feels good in the house of God. It feels
[42:47] like you're here because you know who
[42:48] you are. You know where you come from.
[42:50] You know where you're going. You know
[42:52] what God expects of you and your
[42:54] expectation should be rising by the
[42:56] grace of God. So I greet one and all
[42:58] those that are here. I know there are
[43:00] few people who are not well and they're
[43:01] downstairs. And I went to brother Hugh.
[43:03] I said brother Hugh why are there so
[43:05] many people downstairs? He says some
[43:06] people are not well.
[43:07] As I left hearing those words, I see
[43:09] maybe as the word goes forth this
[43:11] morning, the people downstairs will be
[43:13] quickened to come upstairs because the
[43:14] healing power that's not limited to time
[43:16] and space and limited by four walls can
[43:19] reach downstairs and quicken and heal
[43:21] and transform and deliver, regularize
[43:24] blood pressure. Come on. Destroy the
[43:26] virus and the flu and female condition,
[43:29] male condition, whatever condition it
[43:31] is. destroy cancer, destroy arthritis,
[43:34] DESTROY LEUKEMIA, DESTROY EVERY DEMON
[43:37] BECAUSE EVERY SPIRIT, EVERY PRINCIPALITY
[43:39] HAS A NAME. AND IF WE COULD IDENTIFY
[43:41] WHAT IT IS, WE COULD CALL IT OUT AND
[43:43] DEAL WITH IT. Can the church say amen?
[43:45] Even to reach the internet, to those
[43:47] that are connected online, may the
[43:49] quickening power of God touch you where
[43:51] you are. May your house, your home, your
[43:54] office, your desk, where you be, may the
[43:55] pillar of fire drop down because the
[43:57] spirit is promised to follow the word of
[44:00] the living God. Can the church say amen?
[44:03] &gt;&gt; So by the grace of God, on behalf of the
[44:05] pastor, I'd like to thank the church for
[44:07] their commitment to this year 2025, for
[44:10] the grace of God and for your
[44:11] faithfulness to the message of the hour.
[44:13] We don't preach our own message. We
[44:15] preach another man's message. Can the
[44:17] church say amen? So we salute you, the
[44:19] church, those that have made that choice
[44:21] to make this your home church. You know
[44:23] the prophet said you ought to have a
[44:25] home church, a place you call your home,
[44:27] a place where you identify. There are
[44:28] many people who profess this message and
[44:30] home church.
[44:34] You know, we're going into a new season.
[44:36] So, we're not holding back on anything
[44:38] anymore. We we're not dealing with
[44:40] children. Brother Clarence, when I was a
[44:42] child, I speak as a child, I understood
[44:44] as a child, and but when I became a man,
[44:46] we put away childish things. So, we want
[44:48] to eat some real food.
[44:51] You know, people coming out of the
[44:52] Christmas season, they had all kind of
[44:54] food,
[44:55] but there's some real spiritual food.
[44:57] That's not cereal. That's not milk.
[44:58] That's not soy milk or this kind of milk
[45:00] or but it's the real food of the word of
[45:02] God that quickens us and strengthens us
[45:04] and prepares us for battle because
[45:06] there's a great battle that lays ahead.
[45:07] There's a war that lays ahead. There's a
[45:10] there's challenges that lays ahead. But
[45:11] by the grace of God, he has raised up
[45:13] another generation who under their
[45:15] messenger will be the final voice to the
[45:17] final age. I really want to salute
[45:20] brother Oid. You appreciate your pastor
[45:21] this morning.
[45:24] I'm moving by inspiration this morning.
[45:26] He doesn't I'm doing this but we
[45:28] appreciate we appreciate you. We love
[45:30] you. We thank you for the vision. And I
[45:32] heard somebody say, you know, recently
[45:33] in the last few days, we are grateful
[45:35] for the ministry that we are under. And
[45:38] that is I could speak that from myself.
[45:43] There are God called men in this season.
[45:46] Ephesians say therefor God has set in
[45:48] the church. It's not man voting. It's
[45:50] not man electing. It's not man choosing.
[45:52] But when God sets and puts something
[45:54] upon a man's life that you be identified
[45:56] with in then you know is the Lord's
[45:59] doing and it's marvelous in our eyes.
[46:03] And brother Renham taught us you can't
[46:04] go where your pastor can't take you. You
[46:06] can't live higher than your pastor. So
[46:07] by the grace of God as we come to this
[46:09] end of the year we want to keep praying
[46:11] for our pastor that the Lord would
[46:12] strengthen him and like an eagle he
[46:14] would fly even higher so we could fly as
[46:16] a church. Hallelujah. To where the food
[46:19] is gathered and the where the carcass is
[46:21] there. the eagles gathered together to
[46:22] get strong meat so we could deal with
[46:24] the issues of life. Can the church say
[46:26] amen? So we want to salute our pastor
[46:28] and all the ministers and the elders in
[46:30] the church who stand faithful, who are
[46:33] committed, who are dedicated, brother
[46:35] Anthony,
[46:39] Jason,
[46:42] all the elders, the deacons, the
[46:44] trustees, the ushers, the technical
[46:47] team, the Sunday school team, the
[46:49] kitchen team, the Hospitality team, the
[46:53] parking attendants, the gardening team,
[46:56] the welcoming committee, the prayer
[46:58] warriors, the mothers, the fathers, the
[47:01] grandfathers, the children, the young,
[47:04] the old, the healed, those that are
[47:06] about to be healed, the delivered, those
[47:08] that ARE ABOUT TO BE DELIVERED, THE
[47:10] FREE, THOSE THAT ARE ABOUT TO BE FREE.
[47:12] IT DOESN'T MATTER. WE GIVE THE LORD
[47:14] PRAISE. HE SAID, "THANK HIM. IN THE GOOD
[47:16] TIME, PRAISE HIS NAME. IN THE BAD TIME,
[47:19] DO THE SAME." HALLELUJAH.
[47:23] GLORY.
[47:25] I'm telling you, we have preached many
[47:27] times before, but this season is
[47:28] different. We don't have much time left.
[47:30] When you look and see America has put
[47:32] their troops in this place, and this arm
[47:34] is in this place, and all these things
[47:36] they are doing has to wait on you and I
[47:39] to come into position.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT UP TO SOME WAR ROOM AND SOME
[47:44] POLITICAL DEBATE TO DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS
[47:46] NEXT. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS DETERMINED BY
[47:48] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. SHE IS GOD'S
[47:51] AUTHORITY ON THE EARTH. OH, you don't
[47:53] hear me this morning. Nothing moves
[47:55] UNTIL WE SAY SO. HALLELUJAH. ELIJAH,
[47:58] SHUT UP THE HEAVENS. THERE'LL BE NEITHER
[48:00] DUE NOR RAIN UNTIL I CALL FOR IT. AND
[48:03] THE BRIDE ON THE EARTH WILL HAVE THE
[48:05] POWER TO SHUT UP THE HEAVENS. NOTHING
[48:07] WILL MOVE UNTIL WE SPEAK.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'VE GOT TO REALIZE WHO
[48:12] YOU ARE. YOU GOT TO REALIZE THE POWER
[48:13] THAT'S LOCKED UP IN YOU. AND THAT POWER
[48:16] WANTS TO COME FORTH BECAUSE WHEN TWO
[48:18] OMNIPOTENT MEET, THE MIRACULOUS MUST
[48:20] TAKE PLACE. AND THERE'S AN OMNIPOTENT
[48:22] THIS MORNING IN THE PERSON OF THE HOLY
[48:23] GHOST. THAT SAME ANGEL THAT NEVER LEFT
[48:26] THE EARTH WHEN THE PROPHET LEFT IS ON
[48:28] THE EARTH NOW FIXING THINGS AROUND FOR
[48:30] THE COMING OF THE LORD.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; But there's another omnipotent here this
[48:34] morning locked up in the seeds of the
[48:36] elect. in that elect push his bride of
[48:39] Jesus Christ who WILL BE WASHED BY THE
[48:41] WORD, WASHED BY THE BLOOD, CLEANSED BY
[48:44] THE SPIRIT THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT HIMSELF
[48:47] WILL MAKE himself known.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:52] You may be seated.
[48:54] So want to salute the church. I want to
[48:57] appreciate my wife who has put up with
[48:59] me
[49:05] and my daughter Isabelle.
[49:09] The Lord has blessed me with we could be
[49:12] of service and of fellowship with the
[49:14] body of Jesus Christ.
[49:17] And friends, it's later than we think.
[49:20] When brother Brandham said these words,
[49:21] he said, "It's got me scared that we
[49:22] haven't done enough. Have we done
[49:24] enough?" You know, and on December the
[49:28] 24th, just about four days ago.
[49:32] 60 years ago to be exact, 1965 to 2025.
[49:36] It's been 60 years
[49:38] since God in his wisdom took the
[49:40] prophet.
[49:42] But the Brandham couldn't stay one more
[49:44] minute longer because his mission was
[49:47] finished. His purpose was finished.
[49:50] Every mystery had been revealed.
[49:52] Everything that this messenger was
[49:53] supposed to do had been accomplished
[49:54] because God will never take you off the
[49:56] earth unless your mission is
[49:57] accomplished. So if you are still here,
[50:03] &gt;&gt; can I say it one more time? God can
[50:05] never take you off the earth until your
[50:07] mission is accomplished.
[50:09] So if those who are not here are not
[50:11] here, it's because their mission has
[50:13] been accomplished. But once there's
[50:15] still a mission in your life, God cannot
[50:17] take you off the earth. You could be
[50:19] sick. YOU COULD BE TIRED. YOU COULD BE
[50:21] WALKING THIS WAY, THAT WAY. BUT IF
[50:23] THERE'S A PURPOSE UPON your life, then
[50:24] you'll be in the house OF GOD. YOU'LL BE
[50:26] FIGHTING DEVILS. YOU'LL BE DEALING WITH
[50:28] THE WORLD. You'll be DEALING WITH ISSUES
[50:30] AND CHALLENGES. BUT NOTHING'S GOING TO
[50:32] STOP YOU BECAUSE there's a purpose upon
[50:33] your life. Can the church say, "Amen."
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Turn to your neighbor and tell them
[50:37] there's a purpose upon your life.
[50:47] I'm just warming up this morning. It's
[50:49] the last Sunday, church. There are no
[50:51] more Sundays left.
[50:53] So, we want to put our all into it this
[50:55] morning. There are no more Sundays left.
[50:56] So, this is it. What you didn't do in
[50:58] the first Sunday, you'll do today. What
[51:00] you didn't do IN THE THIRD SUNDAY,
[51:02] YOU'LL DO TODAY. WHAT YOU didn't do in
[51:03] the 15th SUNDAY, YOU'LL DO TODAY.
[51:05] THERE'S NO MORE SUNDAYS LEFT IN THIS
[51:06] YEAR. So if YOU DIDN'T GET THE
[51:08] OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE THE DEVIL A KNOCKOUT
[51:10] PUNCH ON A SUNDAY, THEN THIS IS THE
[51:11] SUNDAY TO DO IT. YEAH, YOU YOU HAVE NO
[51:13] OTHER SUNDAY LEFT IN THIS YEAR TO DO IT.
[51:15] OH, YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. IF
[51:17] YOU DIDN'T KICK THE DEVIL, PUNCH THE
[51:19] DEVIL, BUT THE BRAND SAY SAY BOO BACK.
[51:21] IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT IN THE WHOLE YEAR,
[51:23] THEN TODAY IS THE ONLY DAY YOU HAVE
[51:25] LEFT. LET US DO WHAT WE COULD DO WHILE
[51:27] WE COULD DO IT. We must work while it is
[51:30] day.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Everybody feeling fine?
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:36] Glory.
[51:38] You know, but you know, I'm still under
[51:40] mentorship.
[51:42] I'm still under training.
[51:44] But to say, don't say it won't be too
[51:47] long with you.
[51:52] So, I'm taking instruction this morning.
[51:54] I'm not going to say that this morning.
[51:56] But by the grace of the Lord, when we
[51:58] come to the house of God, friends, it's
[51:59] the distress. But the man preach said
[52:02] letting of the pressure
[52:04] &gt;&gt; because this year was a lot of pressure.
[52:05] You know,
[52:07] &gt;&gt; so wait now that was just for me.
[52:10] This year was a lot of pressure and that
[52:13] how it's supposed to be. It's supposed
[52:14] to be a lot of pressure because the
[52:16] pressure is what proves the character in
[52:17] you. If there's no pressure, there's no
[52:19] character to be proven. We don't know
[52:21] who you are until the pressure comes.
[52:22] And when THE PRESSURE COMES, THEN WE
[52:24] COULD SEE IF THAT LOOKS LIKE A SON, that
[52:26] looks like a daughter. LOOK AT PRESSURE.
[52:28] LOOK AT STRESS. AND THEY'RE STILL
[52:29] STANDING. THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN UP, BUT
[52:31] THEY'RE STILL IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. THEY
[52:33] SHOULD HAVE BACKSLID, BUT THEY DRAGGED
[52:35] THEMSELVES INTO THE HOUSE OF THE GOD.
[52:37] THEY MAYBE THEIR MAMA BROUGHT THEM.
[52:39] MAYBE THEIR DADDY BROUGHT THEM. I DON'T
[52:40] CARE. BUT THEY'RE STILL HERE. SO, WHICH
[52:42] MEAN THE DEVIL DON'T HAVE THEM BECAUSE
[52:43] THEY'RE STILL IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. CAN
[52:45] THE CHURCH say amen? Glory.
[52:49] Hallelujah.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; So, I'm excited by the grace of God this
[52:54] morning. Can we stand to our feet just
[52:57] to read three portions of scripture?
[53:01] A little encouragement
[53:04] this morning from the word of God.
[53:06] I want to read Malachi 1
[53:09] second.
[53:22] Malachi 1 verse one.
[53:29] The burden of the word of the Lord to
[53:32] Israel
[53:34] by Malachi.
[53:36] The burden of the word of the Lord to
[53:39] Israel by Malachi. Reading second
[53:42] Timothy 3 and reading verse 16.
[53:46] All scripture
[53:48] is given by inspiration of God.
[53:52] Not some scriptures, but all scripture
[53:54] is given by inspiration of God and is
[53:57] profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
[54:01] for correction, for instruction in
[54:05] righteousness,
[54:06] that the man of God may be perfect,
[54:09] thoroughly furnished unto all good
[54:13] works. And lastly, Revelation 10:7.
[54:17] But in the days of the voice of the
[54:20] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[54:22] sound, the mystery of God should be
[54:24] finished, as he had declared to his
[54:26] servants, the prophets. May the Lord add
[54:29] his blessing to the reading of his word.
[54:31] Shall we just pray one more time?
[54:33] Heavenly Father, we thank you to be in
[54:35] your house on this final Sunday of 2025,
[54:37] Father. And Lord, there are so many who
[54:39] did not make it into this day. And Lord,
[54:41] we pray a special blessing, Lord, and
[54:43] everyone that's here, Lord, in the
[54:45] sanctuary downstairs, connected online,
[54:47] and who may watch this tape that the
[54:50] grace that and peace and mercy and
[54:52] blessing of the Lord that surpass it all
[54:54] understanding would be with them.
[54:56] Father, any man could read the
[54:58] scriptures, but it takes the Holy Spirit
[54:59] to open it and divide it and to rightly
[55:02] present it. So, may you drop down, Lord,
[55:05] and speak to your people. Take me out of
[55:07] the way completely, Lord. Bring my ideas
[55:09] and thoughts under subjection to the
[55:11] spirit. Let nothing be said that you
[55:13] don't once said. And father let what you
[55:15] once said be said. Father Lord have an
[55:18] impact and effect on the hearts of your
[55:19] people. May you pour out your Holy
[55:21] Spirit to confirm the word with signs,
[55:23] wonders, and miracles. We Lord pray for
[55:25] your people and pray for me also. Touch
[55:27] my body. Touch your people. Touch those
[55:29] that are weary. Touch those that are
[55:31] sick. Touch those that are tired. Touch
[55:32] those that are struggling. Touch those
[55:34] that the enemy Lord has almost had them
[55:36] on the back of a wall. But father, may
[55:38] strength and virtue and grace come unto
[55:41] your people even now and have your
[55:42] perfect way. Bless the word one more
[55:44] time and the reading of it we ask in the
[55:45] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[55:47] And the church says,
[55:49] &gt;&gt; "Amen and amen and amen." You may be
[55:51] seated in the presence of the Lord.
[55:56] Hallelujah. Glory.
[55:58] So, I have a title this morning,
[56:02] the burden of the word of the Lord to a
[56:07] prophetic class of people. The burden of
[56:11] the word of the Lord to a prophetic
[56:14] class of people. And we are taking that
[56:17] from that scripture we read in Malachi
[56:19] 1:1, the burden of the word of the Lord
[56:22] to Israel by Malachi. We're going to
[56:26] position it this morning as the burden
[56:28] of the word of the Lord to a prophetic
[56:32] class of people just to lay a
[56:35] foundation. We said it, but I want to
[56:37] just reinforce it as we end this year
[56:39] and prepare for a new year. On December
[56:41] 24th, Christmas Eve, 1965, 60 years ago,
[56:45] Brother Brandon went on to be with the
[56:47] Lord.
[56:48] unknown,
[56:51] almost unrecognized and unacknowledged
[56:53] by the world at large. Outside of the
[56:55] ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, the
[56:58] greatest prophet had silently
[57:02] slipped away.
[57:03] Many names such as Abraham, Moses, Noah,
[57:07] David, Daniel, Elijah, Elisha had long
[57:10] been established as necessary actors in
[57:13] God's great drama.
[57:16] But this time was different. This name
[57:18] was not to be written on buildings,
[57:20] universities, schools of theology. The
[57:23] ministry of this great prophet Elijah of
[57:26] Malachi 4:5 and six was different. As
[57:29] God unfolded the story of his life
[57:32] through three poles, there was a great
[57:34] purpose for this prophet. This prophet
[57:38] was to deliver a seven seals, seven
[57:40] thunder message to prepare an elect
[57:43] Omega word bride for the rapture, for
[57:45] the wedding supper, and for the
[57:47] millennium. God has always had an order,
[57:51] and God will never break his order. From
[57:53] the beginning of time, the word of the
[57:55] Lord has always come to the prophets.
[57:58] Amos 3:7 says, "Surely the Lord will do
[58:02] nothing, but he revealth his secret unto
[58:05] his servants, the prophets." I am not a
[58:08] prophet, so I'm not trying to attempt to
[58:10] be a prophet. But we thank God that
[58:12] there was a prophet in our day, a
[58:14] prophet in our time who almighty God
[58:16] spoke to and spoke through and used to
[58:19] point clarity to the word.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Kings were made subject TO THE PROPHETS.
[58:24] THE HIGH PRIESTS AND ALL the Levites
[58:26] were made subject to the prophet. Those
[58:28] who went to war were subject to the
[58:31] prophet.
[58:33] The word of the prophet would stand
[58:34] until the next prophet would come along.
[58:38] Is this age to be any different?
[58:40] According to my Bible, there is no other
[58:43] major prophet to come. There's no other
[58:47] messenger to come. The last messenger
[58:51] has already come and the last messenger
[58:53] has already gone. And as we established,
[58:55] he could not have left unless his
[58:57] mission and his purpose was
[58:59] accomplished. There will be no other
[59:01] ministry like his ministry for what he
[59:04] was called to do. But the ministry of
[59:06] Jesus Christ that operated in him is
[59:09] promised to operate through an end time
[59:11] bride, an end time people. And it will
[59:14] be not their might or their power, but
[59:16] it will be by the spirit of the Lord.
[59:18] When brother Brandham spoke, it was not
[59:20] a man speaking. When brother Brandham
[59:22] spoke, it was the son of man veiled in a
[59:26] son of man. No wonder brother Brham
[59:29] would say in the message the Leodysian
[59:31] church age. Yes, listen to the
[59:33] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[59:36] in this last age. What he says from God,
[59:40] the bride will say. The spirit and the
[59:43] prophet and the bride will be saying the
[59:46] same thing. and what they will say will
[59:49] have already been said in the word. This
[59:52] brings us back to the Bible because what
[59:55] they say will have already been said in
[59:58] the word. Can the church say amen?
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; I'm laying a foundation. Why I'm against
[1:00:03] organized religion? Remember Brandham
[1:00:04] said the Holy Spirit today, the
[1:00:06] manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that
[1:00:10] angel trying to get the people back to
[1:00:13] the word. Not back to church, not back
[1:00:15] to denomination, not back to gathering,
[1:00:18] but back to the word. Because the Holy
[1:00:21] Spirit will only vindicate the word. If
[1:00:23] I come this morning and present my
[1:00:25] dream, my idea, my thought, there is no
[1:00:28] confirmation or no vindication of that.
[1:00:31] But if I present the word to you, then
[1:00:34] the Holy Spirit has to vindicate the
[1:00:35] word because the Holy Spirit and the
[1:00:37] word is one. Can the church say amen?
[1:00:39] Back to THE WORD MEANS BACK TO the
[1:00:42] Bible. But the Bible has always been a
[1:00:44] sealed book. WITHOUT THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:00:47] HOUR, THE BIBLE IS CLOSED TO YOU. THIS
[1:00:50] IS WHY WE ARE NOT A PENTECOSTAL CHURCH
[1:00:52] or a Methodist church OR AN EVANGELICAL
[1:00:54] CHURCH OR JUST AN APOSTOLIC CHURCH OR
[1:00:56] JUST SEEN WE A MESSAGE CHURCH BECAUSE
[1:00:59] THE BOOK IS CLOSED OUTSIDE OF THE
[1:01:01] PROPHET. BUT WHEN THAT GREAT ELIJAH
[1:01:03] PROPHET STOOD ON THE EARTH THEN THE BOOK
[1:01:05] BECAME AN OPEN BOOK. THE BOOK BECAME A
[1:01:07] NEW BOOK AND WHEN WE LOOK AT SCRIPTURE
[1:01:09] IN THE BOOK IT LOOKS DIFFERENT TO US
[1:01:11] BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING THROUGH THE EYES
[1:01:13] THROUGH THE PROPHETIC EYES. CAN THE
[1:01:15] church say amen?
[1:01:18] Let us be clear. The Bible is closed to
[1:01:20] the Pentecostals. I don't care how
[1:01:22] anointed they are, how many signs and
[1:01:24] wonders they are, it's still a closed
[1:01:26] book to them. There are things they
[1:01:28] could see that's obvious, but there are
[1:01:30] things that are hidden that they could
[1:01:31] never see. Because what they cannot see
[1:01:33] is reserved only for a prophetic class,
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; A PROPHETIC CLASS OF PEOPLE. CAN THE
[1:01:40] CHURCH SAY AMEN? NOT EVERYBODY'S IN A
[1:01:42] PROPHETIC CLASS. THERE'S A SPECIAL
[1:01:44] CATEGORY THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM CALL A
[1:01:46] PROPHETIC CLASS OF PEOPLE. THESE PEOPLE
[1:01:48] ARE DIFFERENT. They could see what
[1:01:50] others cannot see. THEY COULD UNDERSTAND
[1:01:52] WHAT OTHERS CANNOT UNDERSTAND. THEY MAY
[1:01:55] NOT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN IT, BUT WHEN THEY
[1:01:57] SEE IT, THEY CANNOT UNSEE IT. OH, you
[1:01:59] don't hear me this morning.
[1:02:02] Can the church say amen? The Bible is
[1:02:04] close to the Pentecostals. The Bible is
[1:02:07] CLOSE TO THE BAPTISTS. THE BIBLE IS
[1:02:09] CLOSE TO THE METHODISTS. THE BIBLE IS
[1:02:11] CLOSE TO PEOPLE IN THE MESSAGE WHO DON'T
[1:02:13] really believe BECAUSE IN EVERY CHURCH
[1:02:16] THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF BELIEVERS.
[1:02:17] THERE ARE MAKE BELIEVERS, THERE are
[1:02:18] unbelievers, AND THERE'S A PROPHETIC
[1:02:20] CLASS. BECAUSE THE TRUE believers are
[1:02:22] the prophetic class. THEY ACCEPT THE
[1:02:25] PROPHET. THEY ACCEPT THE PROPHET'S
[1:02:26] WORDS. THEY EXPECT OH, COME ON NOW.
[1:02:28] SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO ME THIS MORNING.
[1:02:33] THE BIBLE IS CLOSED TO THOSE IN A
[1:02:35] MESSAGE WHO DON'T DIG DEEP ENOUGH IN THE
[1:02:38] PROPHET'S MESSAGE TO PULL UP THE HIDDEN
[1:02:40] MYSTERIES ALREADY REVEALED. YOU DON'T
[1:02:42] HEAR ME THIS MORNING. ALREADY REVEALED
[1:02:44] BY MALACHI 4. We are not preaching a
[1:02:46] message of salvation this morning. WE
[1:02:49] ARE HIGHER THAN SALVATION. WE ARE NOT
[1:02:51] PREACHING A MESSAGE OF JUST COME OUT TO
[1:02:52] THE WORLD. THIS IS AN AGE OF ADOPTION.
[1:02:55] WE ARE NOT PREDESTINATED TO SALVATION.
[1:02:57] WE ARE PREDESTINATED TO ADOPTION BECAUSE
[1:03:00] ADOPTION IS BRINGING BACK AUTHORITY,
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; POWER, PERMISSION. You don't hear me
[1:03:06] this morning. A police officer, brother
[1:03:08] man said, has no power to stop a
[1:03:10] vehicle. But when you see the uniform,
[1:03:12] you know that uniform represents all
[1:03:14] that the government has. It represents
[1:03:16] the commissioner of police. It
[1:03:18] represents the attorney general. It
[1:03:20] represents the prime MINISTER AND THE
[1:03:21] PRESIDENT BECAUSE A UNIFORM RECOGNIZES
[1:03:24] THE AUTHORITY THAT COMES FROM BEHIND THE
[1:03:26] UNIFORM. AND WHEN YOU PUT ON THE WHOLE
[1:03:28] ARMOR OF GOD,
[1:03:32] THERE COMES A CERTAIN AUTHORITY WITH
[1:03:34] THAT ARMOR.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; GLORY. I'm warming up. I'm warming up.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Glory. Thank you. Everybody feeling
[1:03:48] fine?
[1:03:51] last Sunday, right?
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Because we don't want to be coming to
[1:03:54] church and we don't know where we come
[1:03:55] from, what we going or somebody you MEET
[1:03:57] SOMEBODY AND WHY you believe this and
[1:03:58] you can't explain why you believe this,
[1:04:00] why you operate the way you do, why
[1:04:02] there's a covenant upon your life. And
[1:04:04] we preach about Samson. Even though
[1:04:05] Samson messed up, there was a covenant
[1:04:07] upon him.
[1:04:09] You messing up doesn't take away the
[1:04:10] covenant. God called you. THERE'S
[1:04:12] NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. YOU CAN'T
[1:04:13] UNDO IT. HE ALREADY CALLED YOU. THE
[1:04:16] CALLING PART TAKE PLACE. HE SAID WHO HE
[1:04:17] FOR YOU, HE CALLED. WHO WE CALL HE
[1:04:19] JUSTIFIED? WHO WE JUSTIFIED? HEATH
[1:04:21] ALREADY GLORIFIED. YOU BEING BACKSITTING
[1:04:23] THIS MORNING DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT
[1:04:24] THAT YOU'RE STILL CALLED ACCORDING TO
[1:04:26] HIS PURPOSE. THAT YOU ARE STILL GOING TO
[1:04:28] BE HEALED, STILL GOING TO RECEIVE THE
[1:04:30] HOLY GHOST, STILL GOING TO BE CHANGED,
[1:04:32] STILL GOING TO BE TRANSFORMED. OH, YOU
[1:04:34] DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:37] YOUR MISTAKES CANNOT STOP GOD. HE
[1:04:39] ALREADY SAW EVERY MISTAKE YOU WOULD MAKE
[1:04:41] AND HE STILL WROTE YOUR NAME. OH, YOU
[1:04:43] DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING.
[1:04:47] But preacher, I messed up. I made
[1:04:48] mistake. I doubted. I didn't believe.
[1:04:52] Peter made mistakes. Peter doubted.
[1:04:55] PETER WENT TO DENY CHRIST AND HE WAS
[1:04:57] STILL THE ONE ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST.
[1:04:59] These men are not drunk as you suppose.
[1:05:01] But this is that WHICH WAS THE PROPHET
[1:05:02] JOEL SPOKE ABOUT ONE OF THESE DAYS THE
[1:05:05] HOLY GHOST IS GOING TO GET UPON YOU. AND
[1:05:06] WHEN IT DOES, NOBODY HAS to tell you to
[1:05:08] worship. Nobody has to tell you to
[1:05:10] shout. NOBODY TELL TO LIFT YOUR HANDS.
[1:05:13] YOU WILL DO IT INVOLUNTARILY BECAUSE THE
[1:05:15] SPIRIT WILL MAKE YOU DANCE. THE SPIRIT
[1:05:17] WILL MAKE YOU SHOUT. THE SPIRIT WILL
[1:05:19] MAKE YOU SING. THE SPIRIT WILL MAKE YOU
[1:05:21] WORSHIP. THE SPIRIT WILL MAKE YOU
[1:05:22] FORGIVE YOUR BROTHER. THIS WILL MAKE YOU
[1:05:24] TROD CLOTHES FROM YOUR WARDROBE THAT
[1:05:26] SHOULDN'T BE THERE.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; But I want to make it CLEAR CHURCH. AND
[1:05:34] WE HAVE THE QUOTE. THIS IS NOT FOR
[1:05:36] EVERYBODY.
[1:05:38] This is only FOR A PROPHETIC CLASS OF
[1:05:40] PEOPLE.
[1:05:44] OH, I feel good this morning.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; So, Malachi 4 revealed many things.
[1:05:52] Now, there are three main scriptures
[1:05:54] that identify brother Brandham's
[1:05:55] ministry.
[1:05:57] There's Malachi 45 and 6, which is the
[1:05:59] first one you'll find in scripture in
[1:06:01] the cannon of scripture. Then you'll go
[1:06:02] across to St. Luke 17:30 and then
[1:06:04] Revelation 10:7.
[1:06:07] We're going to touch on Malachi 4
[1:06:09] because if you don't know young brother,
[1:06:10] young sister why you believe what you
[1:06:12] believe then anybody can sway you. You
[1:06:14] know
[1:06:17] somebody tell you something said but he
[1:06:18] say something and people talking a lot
[1:06:20] of stuff these days
[1:06:22] and they have to fact check a lot of
[1:06:23] things. Got people saying things and
[1:06:26] they have no facteing behind it.
[1:06:28] Presenting ideas, concepts this and
[1:06:30] that. And when you ready dig recognize
[1:06:32] who say that? Who already say that? I
[1:06:34] see it on the internet. Really?
[1:06:37] Somebody sent a video to me. It had like
[1:06:39] four views.
[1:06:44] That is the man who post it. Your friend
[1:06:47] who say check it and see if it up.
[1:06:52] No, you have to be careful because
[1:06:53] people sharing all kind of foolishness.
[1:06:55] And now in this AI age of artificial
[1:06:58] intelligence, people taking your voice
[1:06:59] and twisting it, taking words. And if
[1:07:01] you there people even the President
[1:07:03] Trump and all say it wasn't him, it was
[1:07:04] AI.
[1:07:10] So you have to know what your foundation
[1:07:12] is in.
[1:07:14] This is why I still thank God for the
[1:07:16] written books because no AI could
[1:07:19] interfere with this. You could share a
[1:07:21] link that AI inter but you see the
[1:07:23] original book when you go open the book
[1:07:25] and read it for yourself and recognize
[1:07:26] wait a minute this is where the prophet
[1:07:28] said that's the way THE CHURCH IS. THE
[1:07:30] VINE HAS BEEN SPLIT AND YOU could read
[1:07:31] it for yourself and KNOW THIS IS WHAT HE
[1:07:33] SAID. CAN THE CHURCH say amen? Glory.
[1:07:38] I'm laying a foundation.
[1:07:43] I see I hear me stream down. See why I
[1:07:46] need to be in church.
[1:07:52] I think it's still that they'll hear.
[1:07:59] Don't take church for granted. People
[1:08:03] have gotten too casual. We'll get to it
[1:08:04] in the script. People have gotten too
[1:08:05] casual. I understand. If you have no
[1:08:08] choice and you have then you have no
[1:08:09] choice. But if you have an opportunity
[1:08:11] to be the house of God, then why forsake
[1:08:12] the assembly?
[1:08:16] Why are you not in the house of God to
[1:08:17] put your shoulder to the wheel? And
[1:08:19] we're going to get it IN SCRIPTURE. SO
[1:08:20] MALACHI 4 REVEALED MANY THINGS. HE swed
[1:08:23] seeds that spoke of things that are
[1:08:24] about to unfold. There's nothing that's
[1:08:26] happening now that's a surprise to us.
[1:08:29] THINGS THAT ARE TO BE WARS, RUMORS OF
[1:08:32] WARS AND ALL THESE THINGS. THESE ARE NOT
[1:08:33] SURPRISE TO US. WE ARE NOT MARCHING TO
[1:08:35] THE BEAT OF THE WORLD. The world is
[1:08:37] marching to our beat because nothing, HE
[1:08:39] SAID, THIS GOSPEL WILL BE PREACHED AND
[1:08:41] THEN THE END SHALL COME. SO WHEN THIS
[1:08:43] GOSPEL IS FINISHED PREACHING, ONLY THEN
[1:08:45] COULD THE END COME. AND THIS GOSPEL WILL
[1:08:47] BE PREACHED UNTIL EVERY NAME THAT'S ON
[1:08:49] THE BOOK HAS BEEN DELIVERED. YOUR SON,
[1:08:52] YOUR DAUGHTER, YOUR WIFE, YOUR BROTHER,
[1:08:54] YOUR NEIGHBOR, YOUR COWORKER, I DON'T
[1:08:56] CARE WHO THEY ARE. IF THEIR NAME IS IN
[1:08:58] THE BOOK, THIS GOSPEL MUST AND WILL BE
[1:09:01] PREACHED. AND ONLY WHEN THE NAME IS IN
[1:09:03] THE BOOK HAS BEEN CALLED AND THE DOOR IS
[1:09:05] SHUT, THEN THE JUDGMENT CAN BEGIN. CAN
[1:09:07] the church say amen? GIVE THE LORD A
[1:09:09] SHOUT OF PRAISE.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 swed seed that spoke of things
[1:09:17] that are to be. He swed seed that tied
[1:09:19] up all the LOOSE ENDS. SO THERE ARE NO
[1:09:21] LOOSE ENDS IN THE WORLD. in the word.
[1:09:24] We have loose ends, but there's no loose
[1:09:27] end in the message. The loose ends is
[1:09:30] not ON THE PROPHET'S SIDE, CHURCH. IT'S
[1:09:31] ON OUR SIDE. WE HAVE TO TIE UP OUR LOOSE
[1:09:34] ENDS BECAUSE ALL THE LOOSE END OF THE
[1:09:36] WORD HAS ALREADY BEEN TIED UP.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; SO, WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR ANYBODY TO TIE
[1:09:39] UP LOOSE ENDS IN THE WORD, IT'S ALREADY
[1:09:41] TIED UP. EVERY MYSTERY REVEALED, BUT THE
[1:09:43] MYSTERY OF WHO YOU ARE AND HOW YOU LIVE
[1:09:46] AND HOW YOU ADD THE VIRTUES. THAT'S
[1:09:48] WHAT'S BEING UNFOLDED BEFORE US THROUGH
[1:09:50] YOUR TRIALS, THROUGH YOUR TESTING,
[1:09:52] THROUGH YOUR SITUATION, THROUGH WHAT'S
[1:09:53] GOING ON. HALLELUJAH. HE THROW YOU IN A
[1:09:56] BETTER SICKNESS. HE TURNED THE CHURCH
[1:09:58] AGAINST YOU. HE TURNED YOUR WIFE AGAINST
[1:10:00] YOU. WHAT IS HE DOING? WAITING TO POUR
[1:10:02] OUT YOUR SPIRIT TO SAY, "THERE IS MY
[1:10:05] SPIRIT FLOWING FREELY."
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Can the church say, "Amen.
[1:10:12] He swed the seeds that revealed every
[1:10:14] mystery,
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; special seeds for the bride. He said,
[1:10:19] "You see why I'm so zealous in the
[1:10:22] message spoken with the original seed.
[1:10:24] See why I'm been so zealous of the kind
[1:10:26] of seed that have been planted for the
[1:10:28] body. The rain's going to fall pretty
[1:10:31] soon. I mean, the real rain, and it's
[1:10:33] got to have seed to fall on. I hope I
[1:10:36] live to see it." Do you understand now?
[1:10:38] It will be the living word as it was at
[1:10:40] the beginning. The spoken word of God
[1:10:42] have his power for it is in him in his
[1:10:46] own body working his own way. So this
[1:10:49] morning we are speaking to those about
[1:10:51] those seeds that are for the bride body.
[1:10:54] You see what brother Andrew Glover said
[1:10:57] he not preaching about hell because he
[1:10:58] have no plan to go there.
[1:11:02] There's nothing wrong with preaching
[1:11:03] about hell. No, but why be spending time
[1:11:05] preaching about where we not going?
[1:11:07] WE COULD A WHOLE SERVICE ABOUT THE POPE
[1:11:09] AND about Rome and about this. But why
[1:11:10] not going into the tribulation period? I
[1:11:12] want to know what PROMISE IS MINE. TELL
[1:11:15] ME WHAT IS MINE. TELL ME WHAT BELONGS TO
[1:11:18] ME. BUT THE BRANDON PRESENTED MANY
[1:11:20] THINGS BECAUSE HIS PURPOSE WAS TO TIE UP
[1:11:22] ALL THE LOOSE ENDS.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT I WANT TO HEAR THIS MORNING IS
[1:11:25] TELL ME WHAT I GOT TO DO TO BE IN THE
[1:11:27] RAPTURE. TELL ME WHAT I GOT TO DO TO
[1:11:29] MAKE SURE THAT MY FAMILY BRINGS IN COMES
[1:11:32] IN. CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN?
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; It's good. I know about the tribulation
[1:11:38] and the plagues and the wars and all
[1:11:39] these things, but I have no plans to be
[1:11:42] here for the tribulation
[1:11:44] and you shouldn't plan either. What I
[1:11:46] want is the seeds, the promises, the
[1:11:48] word that the bride must produce. That's
[1:11:51] what's important to me. And this
[1:11:53] morning, those things that are revealed
[1:11:54] belong unto us and to our children.
[1:11:58] Brother Brandham, hallelujah, he
[1:12:00] revealed that there's a power coming
[1:12:01] into the church. There'll come a time,
[1:12:04] church, when we won't be preaching it.
[1:12:06] We'll see it actually come in. Right
[1:12:07] now, we are in the ministry of the word,
[1:12:09] speaking about it, speaking about it.
[1:12:10] But one of these days, we'll shift from
[1:12:12] the ministry of the word to the ministry
[1:12:13] of the spirit. Can the church say amen?
[1:12:16] He's prophesied that there'll be a
[1:12:17] manifestation of the sons of God. That
[1:12:20] by and through the bride will be
[1:12:21] fulfilled all that was promised. There
[1:12:24] will be an omega bride with the same
[1:12:26] signs, wonders, and miracles like the
[1:12:27] ALPHA BRIDE. ONCE MORE, the world will
[1:12:30] hear direct from God. There will be an
[1:12:33] Ephesians 4 ministry ON THE EARTH. ALL
[1:12:35] WITH THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:12:37] There'll be a perfect church. There'll
[1:12:39] be a church with Jesus Christ walking in
[1:12:41] it. There'll be a church where sin
[1:12:43] cannot stay IN THAT CHURCH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:45] THESE ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT MALACHI 4
[1:12:47] SPOKE ABOUT.
[1:12:51] There'll be a church where sin cannot
[1:12:52] stay in the church.
[1:12:55] SEVEN THUNDERS IS A BRIDES REVIVAL IN
[1:12:57] THAT CHURCH. RAPTURE AND FAITH IS LAYING
[1:13:00] IN THE MESSAGE IN THAT CHURCH. The same
[1:13:02] Jesus WHO HEALED THE SICK, RAISED THE
[1:13:04] DEAD, MADE THE LAME WALK, MADE THE DUMB
[1:13:06] TALK, WALK ON WATER, FED 5,000 WILL BE
[1:13:08] IN THAT CHURCH. THAT SAME JESUS WILL BE
[1:13:11] VEILED IN A PEOPLE. The mystery that HAS
[1:13:14] BEEN HID FROM GENERATION WHICH IS CHRIST
[1:13:15] IN YOU, THE HOPE OF glory will be in
[1:13:18] that church.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:13:22] Hallelujah.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:13:30] It is only through the prophetic message
[1:13:32] of the seventh angel that we can go back
[1:13:34] to the Bible. That's why we read that
[1:13:36] scripture, Revelation 10:7. But in the
[1:13:38] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:13:40] when he shall begin to sound, the
[1:13:42] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:13:45] had declared to his servants the
[1:13:47] prophets. So the ministry of that
[1:13:49] Elijah, Malachi 4, St. Luke 17:30,
[1:13:52] Revelation 10:7, the seven angel was to
[1:13:54] gather all the scattered word and tie up
[1:13:57] all the loose ends as a seven seal,
[1:14:00] seventh thunder message so that an
[1:14:02] elected bride can come to perfection,
[1:14:04] adoption, and go in the rapture.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together this morning?
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Let's go in the message of revelation of
[1:14:11] Jesus Christ. Brother said, if Satan
[1:14:14] hates any book in the Bible, it's the
[1:14:17] revelation
[1:14:20] BROTHER SAID HE HATES ALL scripture
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; and it's the WHOLE CANNON OF SCRIPTURE
[1:14:27] but if anything he despises mostly is
[1:14:31] revelation and Genesis
[1:14:33] because Genesis tells the beginning and
[1:14:36] Revelation reveals what's going to
[1:14:38] happen to him in the last days going to
[1:14:42] be bound a thousand years. Then him and
[1:14:44] the false prophet and the beast is going
[1:14:47] to be throwed alive into the lake of
[1:14:49] fire. SO THE DEVIL HAS READ THAT AND HE
[1:14:51] KNOWS IT. HE BELIEVES and it trembles
[1:14:53] and HE HATES IT BECAUSE it speaks about
[1:14:55] him. But the BOOK ALSO SPEAKS ABOUT US.
[1:14:59] HE HATES IT BUT WE LOVE IT BECAUSE THE
[1:15:01] SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE WILL SAY COME.
[1:15:03] HALLELUJAH. IN THERE IS A BRIDE. HIS
[1:15:06] WIFE HAD MADE HERSELF READY. THAT'S ALSO
[1:15:08] IN THAT BOOK. COME ON NOW CHURCH.
[1:15:11] Brother Brennham goes on, he'll attack
[1:15:14] the book of Genesis upon it being
[1:15:17] authentic. Brother Brandham is saying
[1:15:19] this in 1960 and people HAVE ATTACKED
[1:15:22] SCRIPTURE. THEY'VE ATTACKED THE PROPHET
[1:15:24] MESSAGE. THEY ATTACKED JESUS WHERE HE
[1:15:25] WAS WHEN HE WAS ON EARTH. So why should
[1:15:28] IT BE A SURPRISE TO US WHEN PEOPLE
[1:15:29] ATTACK SCRIPTURE OR TO ATTACK the
[1:15:31] message? They call Jesus BL.
[1:15:36] Could you imagine
[1:15:38] the audacity of man to look at God made
[1:15:42] flesh and say it's the devil?
[1:15:49] He'll attack the book of Genesis upon it
[1:15:51] being authentic. He'll say that it isn't
[1:15:54] authentic
[1:15:55] and he'll stir the minds of people.
[1:15:59] Watch where the devil lays. That book of
[1:16:01] Genesis or the book of Revelation, the
[1:16:03] first and the last. Let's go on. And the
[1:16:06] book of Revelation has more symbols in
[1:16:09] it than all the rest of the books in the
[1:16:11] Bible. It has more symbols because it is
[1:16:14] a book of prophecy. It's a prophetic
[1:16:17] book. Therefore, IT HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD
[1:16:20] BY A PROPHETIC CLASS. SO, nobody could
[1:16:24] UNDERSTAND THIS BOOK. BUT UNLESS YOU
[1:16:26] BELONG TO A PROPHETIC CLASS.
[1:16:28] HALLELUJAH. THANK GOD THAT I'M PART OF A
[1:16:30] PROPHETIC CLASS THAT WE COULD LOOK AT
[1:16:33] THE BOOK AND SEE THE FIRST SEAL, SECOND
[1:16:34] SEAL, third seal, FOURTH SEAL, SEVEN
[1:16:37] THUNDERS, REVELATION. I SEE A MIGHTY
[1:16:39] ANGEL COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN CALL WITH A
[1:16:42] CLOUD, RAINBOW UPON HIS HEAD, FACE AS IT
[1:16:44] WOULD HAVE FEET. OH, COME ON NOW.
[1:16:46] SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO ME. THE
[1:16:48] PENTECOSTALS COULD READ THAT, BUT THEY
[1:16:50] DON'T SEE IT. BUT YOU, YOU SEE IT, YOU
[1:16:52] READ IT. AND THEN YOU SEE REVELATION
[1:16:54] 10:7, IN THE DAYS OF THE VOICE OF THE
[1:16:57] SEVEN ANGEL, WHEN HE SHALL BEGIN TO
[1:16:59] SOUND, THE MYSTERY SHOULD BE FINISHED,
[1:17:01] GO ASK THE PENTECOSTAL ABOUT THAT. THEY
[1:17:03] DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT YOU KNOW, YOU
[1:17:05] KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; AND REVELATION 28, GO TO THE ANGEL AND
[1:17:10] TAKE THE BOOK. OH, HALLELUJAH. JOHN IS A
[1:17:14] TYPE OF THE PRIDE REPRESENTING YOU AND
[1:17:16] I. SWEET IN THE MOUTH, BITTER IN THE
[1:17:18] BELLY, BEARING THE REPROACH FOR 60
[1:17:21] YEARS. BUT HERE WE STAND. WE ARE NOT
[1:17:24] MOVING FROM IT. IF THIS IS WRONG, THEN I
[1:17:26] DON'T WANT TO BE RIGHT. IF THIS IS NOT
[1:17:28] THAT, I'LL KEEP THIS UNTIL THAT COMES.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Brother said this book is not meant for
[1:17:40] everybody.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Can I say IT AGAIN? THIS BOOK OF
[1:17:44] REVELATION IS NOT MEANT FOR EVERYBODY.
[1:17:46] YOU KNOW HOW MANY BIBLES IT HAVE IN THE
[1:17:48] WORLD? PEOPLE HAVE BIBLE ON THEIR PHONE,
[1:17:51] BIBLE ON THEIR BED, BIBLE ON THEIR
[1:17:53] BANISTER, BUT WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE BOOK
[1:17:54] OF REVELATION, THAT BOOK IS NOT FOR
[1:17:56] THEM.
[1:17:58] IT'S FOR A PROPHETIC CLASS OF PEOPLE.
[1:18:00] BECAUSE WHEN YOU READ IT, YOU'RE NOT
[1:18:02] READING WORDS. IT'S THE DIVINE MYSTERY
[1:18:04] OF GOD. It's the ORACLES OF GOD. IT'S
[1:18:07] THE PLAN OF GOD. IT'S THE PURPOSE OF GOD
[1:18:10] TO A PROPHETIC class of people.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; But everybody say this book is made for
[1:18:17] a certain class.
[1:18:20] I want to be in that class. I NEED TO BE
[1:18:22] IN THAT CLASS. I CAN BE OUTSIDE OF THAT
[1:18:25] CLASS. I DON'T WANT TO BE CLUELESS TO
[1:18:27] WHAT'S ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE. I don't want
[1:18:29] nobody tell ME WHAT IT IS. BECAUSE WE
[1:18:31] HAVE A PROPHET WHO REVEALED EVERY
[1:18:32] MYSTERY OF WHAT IT is
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; and that mystery shows me who I am.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "The cannal mind
[1:18:44] cannot comprehend them great things.
[1:18:50] There are some people of cannally mind
[1:18:53] be minded is
[1:18:58] they in the flesh
[1:19:00] everything for them is everything for
[1:19:02] them is everything
[1:19:06] there's human emotion human feeling they
[1:19:08] see things just they don't see God in
[1:19:10] everything that's why say if you read
[1:19:12] the Bible and don't see Jesus in every
[1:19:14] verse go and read it again
[1:19:20] because when you're now spiritually
[1:19:21] minded, you operate different. You look
[1:19:24] at things different. YOU PROCESS TRIALS
[1:19:27] DIFFERENT. You possess situations
[1:19:29] differently because you're spiritually
[1:19:30] minded. The cannal mind cannot
[1:19:32] comprehend them great things of
[1:19:33] scripture because it's foolish to them.
[1:19:38] But to the ones who are lovers of the
[1:19:42] word of God, are there any who love the
[1:19:46] word of God.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Notice it didn't hear here say people
[1:19:52] who love church
[1:19:57] people who love church enough.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; You know what they call that? A church
[1:20:00] spirit.
[1:20:04] They love church. And we'll get into
[1:20:06] that in a second. But to the ones who
[1:20:08] are the lovers of the word of God,
[1:20:10] that's who the book is written due to
[1:20:11] the church, the revelation of Jesus
[1:20:12] Christ. Can the church say amen?
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; So we are back
[1:20:24] to the Bible. The devil's greatest fear
[1:20:27] is when the bride gets back to the
[1:20:29] Bible. It is written. It is written. It
[1:20:33] is also written. You know the devil
[1:20:36] still has PTSD from that encounter
[1:20:40] when he met Jesus in the wilderness. Say
[1:20:42] if thou be, if thou be, do this, do
[1:20:44] this, do this. And Jesus just say it is
[1:20:46] written.
[1:20:48] Now church, you cannot say it is
[1:20:50] written. If you don't know what written
[1:20:51] or not,
[1:20:54] this is why the Bible and the message of
[1:20:56] the hour is supposed to be your book
[1:20:57] that guides your life. It is written.
[1:21:00] Hold on. Hold on. What is written again,
[1:21:01] buddy?
[1:21:05] The word is supposed to be your weapon.
[1:21:07] The word is supposed to be YOUR DEFENSE.
[1:21:09] YOU HAVE TO KNOW BECAUSE when the devil
[1:21:11] bring a doubt to your mind. This is why
[1:21:12] when that man came to the prophet and he
[1:21:14] came back again for prayer and I say I
[1:21:16] pray for you already. Just keep saying
[1:21:17] by stripes I'm healed. What was he
[1:21:19] saying? Keep saying it is written
[1:21:22] and he show him the word that applied to
[1:21:24] his situation.
[1:21:30] You can't read the next scripture and
[1:21:31] apply it. You have to know the scripture
[1:21:33] that applies to your situation.
[1:21:38] But back to the word means back to the
[1:21:40] scripture.
[1:21:41] In the message the end time sign said
[1:21:44] Jesus said that the scriptures has to be
[1:21:46] fulfilled. Every word has to come to
[1:21:48] pass.
[1:21:50] Today we have gotten so far away from
[1:21:52] it. We've just mixed ourselves up with
[1:21:54] creeds and so forth until we just got a
[1:21:57] wild tantrum just as the Bible said we
[1:22:00] would do. And this is why church is so
[1:22:02] important to have the right balance.
[1:22:04] This is why we thank God for the
[1:22:06] ministry that we under. Because there
[1:22:07] are those who have word, word, word,
[1:22:09] word, word and no spirit. And you have
[1:22:11] spirit, spirit, spirit, spirit and no
[1:22:13] word.
[1:22:15] When you have word and spirit together,
[1:22:17] then you have something because the word
[1:22:20] is meant to be anointed. We in the word.
[1:22:22] We try biscuit just nothing.
[1:22:28] Then you just jumping up and down.
[1:22:30] Jumping up and down. What you hear in
[1:22:32] church? I don't know. Just jump up and
[1:22:33] down.
[1:22:35] But balance,
[1:22:37] hearing the word, seeing your name,
[1:22:39] responding to the word, being quickened
[1:22:40] to you, coming alive by it. It's driving
[1:22:42] you. You're listening to tape. You're in
[1:22:44] the atmosphere. You're fellowshipping
[1:22:46] around it. It's your driving force. It's
[1:22:47] your motivating force. It's propelling
[1:22:49] you. It's pushing you. That's a
[1:22:50] different thing. Can the church say
[1:22:51] amen?
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; But the random goes on. But in the face
[1:22:55] of all of that, there's a real bride
[1:22:57] that God's bringing forth.
[1:23:00] Each generation gets its time. Did you
[1:23:02] ever notice there'll be a man of God
[1:23:04] come along that'll strike fire with God
[1:23:06] and there'll be a great revival sweep
[1:23:08] the land and what happens immediately
[1:23:10] after that they take the man's idea and
[1:23:12] denominate it and bring in creeds and
[1:23:14] mix with it there she dies and never
[1:23:17] rises again always has been always will
[1:23:19] be every time but coming back to the
[1:23:22] Bible is to produce a word bride because
[1:23:25] there has never been and will never be a
[1:23:28] bride like this bride but the random
[1:23:29] said there'll be brides brides churches
[1:23:30] churches brides bride but they must
[1:23:31] become one that has got the mechanics
[1:23:33] and dynamics together.
[1:23:40] Brother Brandham's ministry was limited
[1:23:43] by scripture
[1:23:45] because he could not go outside of
[1:23:47] scripture. But the Brandham said in a
[1:23:49] message, perfect strength by perfect
[1:23:51] weakness. I don't care what any angel
[1:23:55] would say.
[1:23:57] If it ain't according to the word, I
[1:23:59] don't believe it. So brother Brham
[1:24:02] himself was auditing the angels when it
[1:24:05] come to speak with him.
[1:24:10] He said if that angel told me, this is
[1:24:12] the PROPHET SPEAKING, "IF THAT angel
[1:24:15] told me something different from that, I
[1:24:19] wouldn't believe the angel."
[1:24:23] God's word first above all angels and
[1:24:26] everything else.
[1:24:33] Are we together?
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; WHICH REINFORCES WHY YOU HAVE TO KNOW
[1:24:38] YOUR MESSAGE. You have to know the word
[1:24:41] and you have to look in scripture to
[1:24:43] know what he says here.
[1:24:47] I'm almost done this part. Then we get
[1:24:49] into our text in the message.
[1:24:54] Speak to this mountain. And he says when
[1:24:55] he stands before me in that light that
[1:24:58] you see on the picture and reveals it
[1:25:00] every time is perfect with the scripture
[1:25:03] through and through. So brother but the
[1:25:05] Brandom everything that he presented had
[1:25:08] to be able to be run through scripture.
[1:25:13] THIS IS WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM HIMSELF
[1:25:14] SAID BACK TO THE BIBLE.
[1:25:18] And I've said it many times there are a
[1:25:19] lot of message people who don't know the
[1:25:21] Bible. God's word is THE BIBLE. BROTHER
[1:25:24] BRHAM'S MINISTRY WAS TO BRING LIGHT unto
[1:25:27] the written word. Show the revealed word
[1:25:30] in the written word.
[1:25:35] That's the reason brother Bam said, "I
[1:25:37] know it's the angel of the Lord because
[1:25:39] he bears record of his word." And if
[1:25:43] that angel told me one thing that wasn't
[1:25:48] scriptural, I would not believe him.
[1:25:52] It has to be with the word first. God's
[1:25:55] word is eternal because an angel could
[1:25:57] come and preach something else. PAUL
[1:26:00] SAID THAT WASN'T RIGHT. BUT IF IT'S THE
[1:26:02] word of God, the angel of God will
[1:26:04] verify that word every time to be the
[1:26:06] truth. If it's a true angel from the
[1:26:09] Lord, if it's something off color, then
[1:26:11] don't you listen to it. But if an angel
[1:26:13] come and speaks and says just exactly
[1:26:16] what the word says, then that angel's
[1:26:19] from God. And church, the reason I'm
[1:26:22] saying it because certain things cannot
[1:26:23] go into 2026.
[1:26:25] Not because somebody stand behind sacred
[1:26:27] desk mean they're speaking the truth.
[1:26:31] Just think about it friends. 12
[1:26:33] ministers went to the promised land.
[1:26:35] These were not noviceses, amateurs.
[1:26:37] These were the best men from every
[1:26:38] tribe. It was 12 men who were the best
[1:26:42] from every tribe, who would have had
[1:26:44] song doctrine, who would have had
[1:26:45] experiences, who would have BEEN
[1:26:47] TRUSTED. THE WHOLE TRIBE. THEY SAID THIS
[1:26:49] IS THE ONE BROTHER to go and witness
[1:26:50] this and bring back testimony of the
[1:26:52] land. It was Caleb, Joshua, and 10 good
[1:26:55] men from each tribe. Think about it in
[1:26:59] the whole tribe.
[1:27:01] You didn't send a a a random brother.
[1:27:06] They send THE BEST AND THE BEST WENT AND
[1:27:09] only two come back with a good report.
[1:27:14] And the other 10 OF THE BEST COME BACK
[1:27:16] AND SAY WE CAN'T TAKE IT.
[1:27:20] HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:22] GLORY. So this is why I am so careful
[1:27:26] because not everybody who say Christ
[1:27:28] Christ is is not all Israel is Israel
[1:27:31] and there are many in this message who
[1:27:32] believe a portion of it or is the agenda
[1:27:35] of it or their version of it. But I want
[1:27:36] the whole scroll. Tell me what I need to
[1:27:38] do to make it.
[1:27:41] I don't want to feel GOOD AND FEEL
[1:27:42] COMFORTABLE AND FEEL AND THEN I
[1:27:44] recognize I can't I can't I I I'm not
[1:27:46] qualified.
[1:27:49] Anybody with me this morning?
[1:27:52] That's why me I don't profess to be in
[1:27:54] the five-fold ministry. We having a
[1:27:56] conversation because that is God
[1:27:59] choosing.
[1:28:02] You can't get PROMOTED IN THE FIVE-FOLD
[1:28:04] MINISTRY. GOD places in the church. GOD
[1:28:06] HAS TO SET YOU IN THERE.
[1:28:10] Brother Brandon DID THE WORK OF AN
[1:28:11] EVANGELIST BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A PROPHET.
[1:28:16] So we HAVE TO BE SO CAREFUL BECAUSE YOU
[1:28:18] HAVE PEOPLE WHO HOLDING ON TO TWO BOOKS,
[1:28:19] three books, get their eyes open with
[1:28:21] something. But the mystery of God's mind
[1:28:23] for the age, they don't see it. I'm not
[1:28:26] speaking about anybody in particular.
[1:28:28] I'm just saying that THERE HAS TO BE A
[1:28:30] CLARITY TO YOU BECAUSE PAUL TAUGHT US
[1:28:32] WHO WAS THE GOLD STANDARD. FOLLOW ME AS
[1:28:34] I FOLLOW CHRIST. AND WE WANT TO be a
[1:28:37] word church, A BIBLEBASED CHURCH, A
[1:28:40] SCRIPTURAL CHURCH, A CHURCH THAT KNOWS
[1:28:42] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. CAN THE CHURCH
[1:28:44] say amen?
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; I'm almost finished this part. In a
[1:28:51] message, as I was with Moses, so I will
[1:28:53] be with thee. That's the trouble today.
[1:28:55] WE TRY TO GET AHEAD OF THE WORD and
[1:28:58] bypass and make the word to fit this,
[1:29:00] the word to fit that. It be scary. You
[1:29:03] meet somebody and they quoting this and
[1:29:05] they plum all the beaten parts but they
[1:29:08] know enough of the message scripture to
[1:29:10] justify foolishness
[1:29:12] when THE BIBLE IS VERY CLEAR ON CERTAIN
[1:29:14] THINGS. Can the church say amen?
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; What we need is follow the word inuza
[1:29:20] jubilee. Brother man said what we need
[1:29:22] to do is get rid of a lot of our fancy
[1:29:25] fandangos. Anybody know what a fandango
[1:29:28] is?
[1:29:31] But whatever it is you have to get rid
[1:29:32] of it.
[1:29:36] He said, "What we need to do is get rid
[1:29:38] of a lot of our fancy fandangos
[1:29:43] trying to check fandango
[1:29:48] and GET BACK TO THE BIBLE AND BACK TO
[1:29:50] THE OLDFASHIONED HOLY GHOST. BACK TO THE
[1:29:53] PLACE WHERE MAN and woman look and act
[1:29:55] and walk like Christians.
[1:29:57] NOT JUST ON SUNDAYS, BUT EVERY DAY."
[1:29:59] AMEN. AND YOU MIGHT THINK I'M A LITTLE
[1:30:01] EXCITED. I'M JUST A LITTLE CRAZY. BUT I
[1:30:02] TELL YOU, I LOVE to be this way.
[1:30:05] Hallelujah.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; But the man goes on, some time ago,
[1:30:10] going down the streets here in Los
[1:30:12] Angeles, I seen a man had a sign on the
[1:30:14] front of him. He said, "I'm a fool for
[1:30:15] Christ." And on his back, he said,
[1:30:17] "Whose fool are you?" So, I'd just
[1:30:20] rather be a fool for Christ than a fool
[1:30:22] for the devil anytime. HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:26] CALL ME WHAT YOU WANT. I WANT TO BE A
[1:30:27] FOOL FOR CHRIST. CALL ME OLDFASHIONED.
[1:30:29] CALL ME WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL ME.
[1:30:31] YOUNG PEOPLE, IT DOESN'T MATTER. CALL ME
[1:30:33] THAT WANT. I'M PART OF THE PROPHETIC
[1:30:35] CLASS. CALL ME WHATEVER YOU WANT BECAUSE
[1:30:37] I KNOW I'M GOING TO THE RAPTURE. I KNOW
[1:30:39] I'M LEAVING THIS WORLD BEHIND. I KNOW
[1:30:41] SICKNESS CANNOT HOLD ME. I KNOW DEATH
[1:30:43] CANNOT HOLD ME. I KNOW DOUBT CANNOT HOLD
[1:30:45] ME. HALLELUJAH. I KNOW SIN CANNOT HOLD
[1:30:47] ME.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout of praise.
[1:30:55] Brother Brandham goes on, "What we need
[1:30:57] today ministers, what we need today,
[1:30:59] brothers and sisters, is this one thing.
[1:31:02] The devil has got into our church and
[1:31:04] got us all formal, indifferent."
[1:31:07] You know what formal mean? It's just a
[1:31:09] routine. You come to church, everything
[1:31:12] formal. You know, people say that how
[1:31:15] normal and formal
[1:31:19] everything become a ritual in different
[1:31:22] in different meaning. You don't already
[1:31:24] care. It don't already bother you. You
[1:31:25] come church and it is whatever it is.
[1:31:28] What we need is a calling back. What we
[1:31:30] need is a oldfashioned gathering
[1:31:32] together again. The sounding of the
[1:31:34] jubilee, the pouring forth of the Holy
[1:31:36] Ghost, the outcoming of the spirit.
[1:31:39] Sure, there's caused to come back to a
[1:31:40] prayer meeting. It's true. We have just
[1:31:43] begun to fashion off just like the world
[1:31:45] do just the same things the world does.
[1:31:47] How it happened is a lot of Hollywood
[1:31:49] evangelism and a lot of television
[1:31:52] staying home at night watching
[1:31:53] television instead of going to prayer
[1:31:55] meeting watching who loves Lucy.
[1:31:59] Young people don't know about who loves
[1:32:00] Lucy but watching Netflix and all these
[1:32:02] things. Oh yes.
[1:32:04] And staying away from the word of God
[1:32:06] and away from church. And I tell you
[1:32:07] brother that's the reason you know
[1:32:09] that's the truth. God, help us today to
[1:32:11] come back to the oldfashioned
[1:32:13] Pentecostal experience of the baptism of
[1:32:16] the Holy Ghost. Can the church say amen?
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; So, let's touch the text a little bit.
[1:32:23] The burden of the word of the Lord to a
[1:32:27] prophetic
[1:32:29] class
[1:32:31] of people.
[1:32:33] Anybody has a burden for anything?
[1:32:39] Everybody has a burden. Some people have
[1:32:42] good burdens. Some people have bad
[1:32:43] burden. They have the burden for the
[1:32:44] wrong thing.
[1:32:50] But here we have a scripture the Lord
[1:32:52] speaking in Malachi 1:1, the burden of
[1:32:56] the word of the Lord.
[1:32:58] Not just the word, but the burden of the
[1:33:01] word.
[1:33:04] In other words, with this word, there
[1:33:06] was a burden coming with this word.
[1:33:12] When the word becomes a reality to you,
[1:33:15] it brings a burden with it.
[1:33:20] A burden for your family, a burden for
[1:33:23] lost souls, a burden for revival, a
[1:33:26] burden to pray. You cannot even pray
[1:33:28] without a burden.
[1:33:34] If you really want to pray for somebody,
[1:33:36] you have to catch a burden for them.
[1:33:39] If someone in your family is sick, you
[1:33:41] could pray with a burden or you could
[1:33:43] pray without a burden. You could sing
[1:33:46] with a burden or you could sing without
[1:33:47] a burden. THERE'S SOMETHING COMES OVER
[1:33:49] YOU when you have a burden.
[1:33:53] Lord, let us have a burden.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; A burden for revival. A burden for the
[1:33:59] Holy Ghost. A burden FOR THE SPIRIT. A
[1:34:02] BURDEN to see something change.
[1:34:21] Malachi is the last book of the Old
[1:34:23] Testament.
[1:34:27] And this is where I want to kind of
[1:34:28] bring it to us. Now
[1:34:33] he speaks to Israel
[1:34:37] in a time when the temple worship and
[1:34:41] the priestly service is functioning.
[1:34:47] He speaks through the scripture by
[1:34:49] declaring almost an accusation to the
[1:34:52] people.
[1:34:58] We read the message of Malachi but we
[1:35:00] know nothing about the man.
[1:35:05] Most of the prophets in scripture there
[1:35:07] are some identifiers about them.
[1:35:11] Isaiah son of Amos had access to kings.
[1:35:15] He was involved in national affairs.
[1:35:18] Jeremiah was from a priestly family. He
[1:35:20] was called young. We could read all of
[1:35:22] that. Ezekiel was a priest in exile by
[1:35:24] the river Chibba.
[1:35:27] We know about Hosea, his marriage and
[1:35:30] his children becoming a part of the
[1:35:31] prophecy. We know about Amos being a
[1:35:33] herdsman. We know his location in
[1:35:35] Takcoa. We know about Jonah and his
[1:35:38] travels and we have preached about these
[1:35:40] THINGS. WE KNOW ABOUT DANIEL AND HIS
[1:35:41] EXILE AND HIS ROYAL COURT AND THE
[1:35:43] PRAYERS OF DANIEL. Are we together?
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; But Malachi, we know who his father is.
[1:35:49] Nothing is said about him. We don't know
[1:35:51] his tribe. We don't know his hometown.
[1:35:54] We don't know any kings he interacted
[1:35:56] with. We don't know anything about his
[1:35:58] personal story. We don't know how he was
[1:36:00] called. We don't know when he was
[1:36:02] called. There are NO MIRACLES RECORDED.
[1:36:04] ALL WE HAVE WITH MALACHI IS THE WORD.
[1:36:13] This is not accidental because it means
[1:36:15] with GOD AND PLACING MALACHI IN THAT
[1:36:18] SPOT BECAUSE REALIZE THIS CHURCH MALACHI
[1:36:21] was the last prophet of the Old
[1:36:23] Testament
[1:36:25] and God wasn't playing.
[1:36:29] WE SAY IT IN THIS DAY GOD COULD HAVE
[1:36:30] CHOSEN ANYBODY from this day but he
[1:36:32] chose a special group of people for this
[1:36:33] day.
[1:36:36] So when GOD LOOKED THROUGH ALL THE
[1:36:38] PROPHETS HE WOULD HAVE, HE PICKED A MAN
[1:36:40] FOR THE JOB THAT HE DIDN'T want us focus
[1:36:42] on the man. He didn't want us to get
[1:36:44] HUNG UP IN HIS PERSONALITY and his
[1:36:46] experiences. He wanted to just FOCUS ON
[1:36:48] ONE THING AND WANTING ONLY THE WORD OF
[1:36:50] THE LORD.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; AND NOT JUST THE WORD, BUT IT'S THE ONLY
[1:36:53] TIME IN SCRIPTURE WHERE WE SEE THE
[1:36:55] BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD.
[1:36:58] SO WHEN IT COMES TO MALACHI, WE CAN'T
[1:37:00] PREACH ABOUT HIS AGE, HIS WIFE, HIS
[1:37:02] CHILDREN, HIS BACKGROUND, WHO ORDAINED
[1:37:04] HIM, WHO CALL HIM, WHERE HE WAS, IF HE
[1:37:06] WAS IN JERUSALEM, IF HE WAS IN JUDEA. WE
[1:37:08] DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. ALL WE HAVE
[1:37:10] IS A MAN WITH A BURDEN.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; This is not accidental.
[1:37:21] THE FACT THAT MALACHI IS NOT KNOWN mean
[1:37:24] God don't want us focus on a man.
[1:37:27] THE MESSENGER IS NOT THE IMPORTANT
[1:37:29] THING. THE MESSAGE IS COME ON NOW,
[1:37:31] SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO ME. BECAUSE IT
[1:37:32] WASN'T MALACHI'S MESSAGE. IT WAS THE
[1:37:34] BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD. IT
[1:37:36] WASN'T MALACHI SPEAKING. YOU DON'T HEAR
[1:37:38] ME THIS MORNING. THIS WAS THE BURDEN OF
[1:37:40] THE WORD OF THE LORD. MALACHI WAS JUST A
[1:37:43] MICROPHONE.
[1:37:45] ALL MALACHI WAS WAS JUST A MICROPHONE.
[1:37:48] YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING.
[1:37:56] HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; SO NOBODY COULD COME AND QUESTION WHAT
[1:38:02] WAS MALACHI'S PERSPECTIVE. WHAT WAS
[1:38:04] MALACHI'S EXPERIENCES? MAYBE MALACHI
[1:38:07] HAVE BIAS. WAS HE FROM THE TRIBE OF
[1:38:09] JUDAH OR THE TRIBE OF LEVITE? WAS HE
[1:38:11] FROM THE TRIBE OF WHATEVER? WE HAVE
[1:38:12] NOTHING ABOUT IT. ALL WE HAVE IS A MAN
[1:38:14] SPEAKING THE WORD OF THE LORD.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; And this word was so critical. THIS WORD
[1:38:19] WOULD be the LAST WORD THEY WOULD HEAR
[1:38:21] FOR 400 YEARS. BECAUSE AFTER MALACHI,
[1:38:24] THERE WAS NO PROPHET FOR 400 YEARS. SO
[1:38:26] GOD WAS BEING VERY DELIBERATE IN WHO HE
[1:38:29] would choose TO BE THE MAN TO CLOSE OFF
[1:38:31] THE OLD TESTAMENT. YOU DON'T HEAR ME
[1:38:33] THIS MORNING. HE WASN'T CHOOSING ANY AND
[1:38:35] ANYBODY. HE WANTED A CERTAIN KIND OF
[1:38:37] MAN. AND IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM.
[1:38:39] THIS MAN HAD TO HAVE NO EGO, NO
[1:38:41] AMBITION, NO STORY, NO I WAS HERE AND I
[1:38:45] WAS HERE AND I WENT HERE AND I PREACH
[1:38:47] HERE. NOTHING LIKE THAT. COME ON NOW.
[1:38:49] SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO ME. ALL HE HAD
[1:38:51] WAS THE BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD
[1:38:54] BECAUSE HIS PEOPLE WERE IN TROUBLE. OH,
[1:38:55] COME ON NOW. SOMEBODY PREACH back to me.
[1:38:59] Anybody with me this morning? Can we go
[1:39:01] ON A BIT? HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:04] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; MALACHI'S PLACEMENT WAS ALSO UNIQUE.
[1:39:18] Malachi's message
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; was also important because it was after
[1:39:23] restoration. When you LOOK BACK AT
[1:39:25] ISAIAH AND JEREMIAH and Ezekiel, brother
[1:39:28] Terren, they were either warning of
[1:39:30] destruction, speaking in the midst of
[1:39:32] exile, TELLING THE PEOPLE, "DON'T GET
[1:39:34] INTO TROUBLE." BUT MALACHI WAS
[1:39:35] DIFFERENT. THE TEMPLE HAD BEEN RESTORED.
[1:39:38] THE PRIESTS HAD BEEN NOW BACK IN THEIR
[1:39:40] POSITION. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING STILL
[1:39:42] WRONG.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me this morning?
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:39:58] Glory.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Isaiah had warned before captivity.
[1:40:08] Jeremiah had warned during collapse.
[1:40:10] Ezekiel had warned from exile. But
[1:40:12] Malachi was bringing a warning after
[1:40:15] restoration.
[1:40:17] The temple was rebuilt. But Malachi was
[1:40:20] there to say you could rebuild the
[1:40:21] temple and still have no fear of the
[1:40:23] Lord. We're going to get to it in
[1:40:24] scripture in a minute.
[1:40:34] Let's go to the Bible.
[1:40:36] Malachi 1 verse one and let's read
[1:40:49] the burden of the word of the Lord to
[1:40:52] Israel by Malachi.
[1:40:54] It's a burden. This is God having a
[1:40:57] burden.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; All through scripture, God has had a
[1:41:00] burden. He said, "I've heard the cries
[1:41:02] of my people and I've come down to
[1:41:04] deliver." Moses didn't have his own
[1:41:05] message. His message was in fact a
[1:41:07] burden of the Lord. God came down and
[1:41:10] the burden of the Lord became Moses
[1:41:12] burden. You don't hear me this morning.
[1:41:15] And Moses burden became a burden that he
[1:41:17] took HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILD AND SAID,
[1:41:18] "WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE PLACE WE RAN
[1:41:20] FROM BECAUSE I HAVE A BURDEN. YOU CAN'T
[1:41:22] OPERATE WITHOUT HAVING A BURDEN." SO
[1:41:24] WHEN MOSES GOT THERE, HE COME WITH A
[1:41:26] BURDEN. THUS SAID THE LORD, LET MY
[1:41:28] PEOPLE GO. AND THE BURDEN IN HIM COVERED
[1:41:31] HIS FEAR BECAUSE THE BURDEN WAS BIGGER
[1:41:33] THAN HIS FEAR. THE BURDEN WAS BIGGER
[1:41:35] THAN HIS PAST. THE BURDEN WAS BIGGER
[1:41:37] THAN HIS FAILURES. THE BURDEN WAS BIGGER
[1:41:39] THAN THE FACT THAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR
[1:41:41] HIM AS A WANTED MAN BECAUSE HE HAD A
[1:41:43] BURDEN.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:46] GLORY TO GOD. SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO ME
[1:41:48] THIS MORNING. EVERY PROPHET OF GOD HAD
[1:41:51] TO PREACH WITH A BURDEN. YOU CAN'T BE A
[1:41:53] PROPHET WITHOUT A BURDEN. YOU CAN'T BE A
[1:41:56] PASTOR WITHOUT A BURDEN BECAUSE A PASTOR
[1:41:58] IS A BURDEN BEARER.
[1:42:01] YOU CAN'T BE A MOTHER IF YOU CAN'T HAVE
[1:42:02] A BURDEN. BECAUSE AS A MOTHER, YOU OUGHT
[1:42:04] TO BE A BURDEN BEARER. OH, YOU DON'T
[1:42:06] HEAR ME THIS MORNING. WITHOUT A BURDEN,
[1:42:08] WE ARE FINISHED.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; But we live in A WORLD WITH FATHERS WITH
[1:42:16] NO BURDENS, MINISTERS with no burdens,
[1:42:19] deacons with no burdens, SONG LEADERS
[1:42:22] WITH NO BURDENS, CHILDREN WITH NO
[1:42:24] BURDENS.
[1:42:30] MALACHI.
[1:42:33] That's the only time we see his name in
[1:42:35] the Old Testament. And that's one verse
[1:42:37] right there. The burden of the word of
[1:42:40] the Lord. God needed a mouthpiece.
[1:42:43] Hallelujah. You know when Moses was
[1:42:46] around, he say don't let God speak, let
[1:42:47] Moses speak. So God can't come and speak
[1:42:50] to the people. He needed a mouthpiece.
[1:42:52] So he picked up a man called Malachi.
[1:42:54] Just as he picked up a man called
[1:42:55] William Brandom. He picked up a
[1:42:57] mouthpiece. He said, "Malachi, I have a
[1:42:59] burden and the word of the Lord IS MY
[1:43:01] BURDEN. GO AND SPEAK."
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; They had already been restored, but
[1:43:06] Clarence THE TEMPLE ALREADY RESTORED.
[1:43:08] BUT CLARENCE, THE PRIESTS ALREADY
[1:43:10] PERFORMING DUTIES AND SACRIFICES, BUT
[1:43:12] GOD STILL SAY, "I WATCHING THE
[1:43:14] RESTORATION. I'M WATCHING DELIVERANCE.
[1:43:16] I'VE DONE ALL THESE THINGS WITH THE
[1:43:17] PEOPLE, BUT I STILL HAVE A BURDEN
[1:43:20] BECAUSE SOMETHING'S STILL NOT RIGHT. BUT
[1:43:22] I CAN'T LEAVE IT THIS WAY." BECAUSE THE
[1:43:24] BURDEN IN GOD COULDN'T HAVE HIM SIT DOWN
[1:43:27] AND WATCH THE PEOPLE FALL APART. THE
[1:43:29] BURDEN GOT HIM TO PICK SOMEBODY ELSE.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; And when you have a burden, you can't
[1:43:32] SIT STILL. WHEN YOU HAVE A BURDEN, YOU
[1:43:34] FIND YOURSELF IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. I
[1:43:36] KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A BURDEN. WE KNOW
[1:43:38] WHEN YOU HAVE A BURDEN, YOU CAN'T WAIT
[1:43:40] TO COME TO CHURCH. YOU CAN'T MISS A
[1:43:41] PRAYER MEETING BECAUSE THE BURDEN DRIVES
[1:43:44] YOU TO THE ALTAR. THE BURDEN GETS YOU TO
[1:43:47] HOLD ON TO THE HALL OF THE ALTAR. THE
[1:43:48] BURDEN PUTS IT ASIDE AND CRY FOR THE
[1:43:51] ABOMINATION IN THE CITY. WHAT IS IT?
[1:43:53] IT'S A BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; What are you saying, preacher? When the
[1:43:58] word of God is preached, it should bring
[1:44:00] a burden. It should make you move. IT
[1:44:03] SHOULD MAKE YOU GROAN. IT SHOULD MAKE
[1:44:05] YOU TRAVAIL. UH IT SHOULD MAKE YOU SIGH.
[1:44:07] IT SHOULD MAKE YOU SAY, "LORD, DON'T
[1:44:09] PASS ME BY. SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE. I
[1:44:11] HAVE A BURDEN." THE WORD BEING PREACHED
[1:44:14] BRINGS A BURDEN. A BURDEN FOR LOST
[1:44:16] SOULS. A BURDEN FOR HEALING. A BURDEN
[1:44:18] FOR DELIVERANCE. A BURDEN TO MAKE THINGS
[1:44:20] RIGHT.
[1:44:29] Are we here this morning?
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; The question is what what burden
[1:44:38] did God have?
[1:44:41] This wasn't Malachi's burden, church.
[1:44:43] This is God's burden. IS THE BURDEN of
[1:44:46] the word of the Lord
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; to Israel by Malachi
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; OR IN OTHER WORDS TO THE PROPHETIC CLASS
[1:44:51] OF THAT DAY
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WASN'T SPEAKING TO EVERYBODY
[1:44:55] IN NO AGE DID GOD EVER SPEAK TO
[1:44:57] EVERYBODY WHEN MOSES WAS THERE HE WAS
[1:45:00] SPEAKING TO THE GENERATION THAT WAS
[1:45:01] GOING TO COME FROM THE PEOPLE IT WAS NOT
[1:45:03] TO THOSE people
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; and this is God's burden
[1:45:15] I have loved you sayeth the Lord.
[1:45:18] Malachi is not speaking his words own
[1:45:19] words here. Now I have loved you sayeth
[1:45:22] the Lord.
[1:45:25] And Malachi is saying what the people
[1:45:28] are saying.
[1:45:30] Yet ye say wherein hast thou loved us?
[1:45:35] So this is the burden of God. NOW GOD IS
[1:45:39] SAYING I'VE LOVED YOU.
[1:45:42] But the people are saying, "What love
[1:45:44] you talking about?
[1:45:50] WHAT YOU MEAN YOU LOVE ME?
[1:45:53] And I have trials and I have testings."
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; BUT THE BRANDON WOULD SPEAK ABOUT THIS
[1:45:58] IS ELECTIVE LOVE BEING DESCRIBED HERE
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BRIGHT SKIES ARE NO SIGNS OF GOD
[1:46:03] APPROVAL AND DARK SKIES ARE NO SIGNS OF
[1:46:05] HIS DISAPPROVAL. BUT HIS APPROVAL is in
[1:46:07] the beloved.
[1:46:12] The audacity of man to say, "Lord, you
[1:46:14] really love me." That's what they were
[1:46:17] saying here. THE BURDEN OF THE WORD OF
[1:46:19] THE LORD IS TABERNACLE WITH A CURRENT IN
[1:46:21] MALACHI.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; AND GOD WANTS TO EXPRESS TO HIS PEOPLE,
[1:46:25] I HAVE LOVED YOU.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT GOD REALIZES IS THEY HAVE NOT
[1:46:32] ACCEPTED IT.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. THEY DON'T
[1:46:36] BELIEVE THAT GOD LOVED THEM. OH, YOU
[1:46:37] DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. HE SAID, "I
[1:46:39] HAVE LOVED YOU." AND WHEN HE'S SAYING
[1:46:41] THAT, THEY'RE SAYING, "WHAT LOVE YOU
[1:46:42] TALKING ABOUT? I'M NOT FEELING THE LOVE.
[1:46:44] I DON'T KNOW THE LOVE." YOU DON'T HEAR
[1:46:46] ME THIS MORNING. HAVE YOU ACCEPTED THE
[1:46:49] LOVE OF GOD? THIS WAS THE LAST PROPHET
[1:46:51] OF THE OLD TESTAMENT.
[1:46:55] AND GOD WAS STILL HAVING ISSUES WITH THE
[1:46:57] PEOPLE ACCEPTING THE LOVE OF GOD.
[1:46:59] BECAUSE IF YOU ACCEPT THE LOVE OF GOD,
[1:47:01] THE MERCY OF GOD, THE GRACE OF GOD,
[1:47:04] IT'LL MAKE YOU MOVE DIFFERENT, TALK
[1:47:06] DIFFERENT, IT'LL MAKE YOU MORE LOVELY.
[1:47:08] IT'LL MAKE YOU MORE GRACIOUS.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; So I declare to you this morning THE
[1:47:15] BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD TO A
[1:47:17] PROPHETIC CLASS OF PEOPLE. I LOVE YOU.
[1:47:21] I LOVE YOU. THAT'S THE WORD OF THE LORD
[1:47:23] TO YOU THIS MORNING. I LOVE YOU IN YOUR
[1:47:26] FILTH, IN YOUR MISTAKES, IN YOUR SIN, IN
[1:47:28] YOUR CORRUPTION. IT'S AN ELECTIVE LOVE.
[1:47:31] IT'S A PERFECT LOVE.
[1:47:42] Have you accepted
[1:47:44] the love of God?
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; People live this world trying to find
[1:47:48] love in all the wrong places. Looking
[1:47:52] for love in all the wrong places.
[1:47:54] LOOKING FOR AFFIRMATION, LOOKING FOR
[1:47:57] RECOGNITION, looking for
[1:47:58] acknowledgement, LOOKING FOR
[1:48:00] APPRECIATION, LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY TO
[1:48:02] TELL US SOMETHING GOOD. AND HERE IT IS
[1:48:04] AFTER ALL THESE YEARS OR EVERY SINGLE
[1:48:06] PROPHET GONE. HE'S NOT TO THE LAST MAN
[1:48:08] ON THE BOARD AND HE'S STILL SAYING THE
[1:48:11] FIRST THING. I HAVE LOVED you Israel.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; I've been TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT FROM
[1:48:16] GENESIS WHEN NOAH WAS HERE, WHEN ABRAHAM
[1:48:19] WAS HERE, WHEN MOSES WAS HERE, WHEN
[1:48:21] JOSHUA WAS HERE, WHEN ELIJAH WAS HERE,
[1:48:24] WHEN DANIEL WAS HERE, WHEN JEREMIAH WAS
[1:48:26] HERE, IT'S BEEN THE SAME MESSAGE.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; I love you.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; I'm coming for you. YOU ARE THE REASON.
[1:48:33] YOU ARE MY CHOICE. YOU ARE MY BRIDE. YOU
[1:48:36] ARE MY CHOSEN. MY LOVE IS BIGGER THAN
[1:48:39] YOU. MY LOVE IS BIGGER THAN YOUR
[1:48:40] FAILURES, BIGGER THAN YOUR SIN, BIGGER
[1:48:43] THAN YOU. I HAVE LOVED YOU.
[1:48:46] So don't come into the church.
[1:48:49] Lord, you really love me.
[1:48:52] He was saying to them, don't doubt my
[1:48:54] love for you. DON'T QUESTION MY LOVE FOR
[1:48:58] YOU. DON'T TAKE MY LOVE FOR YOU FOR
[1:49:00] GRANTED. OH, COME ON NOW. SOMEBODY HELP
[1:49:02] ME. HALLELUJAH. DON'T TRY TO MEASURE MY
[1:49:05] LOVE. ACCEPT IT FOR WHAT IT IS. I HAVE
[1:49:08] LOVED YOU. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU. LOVE
[1:49:11] LIFTED ME. FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD,
[1:49:14] HE WOULD GIVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; CHURCH, last Sunday of 2025.
[1:49:30] You may be seated.
[1:49:34] I always say God had choices. When you
[1:49:37] read the book of Matthew, the book of
[1:49:39] the generation of Jesus Christ, the son,
[1:49:41] and it goes on and it lists the
[1:49:42] genealogy. In there, he lists Ruth. In
[1:49:46] there, he lists Tamar. In there, HE
[1:49:48] LISTS FIVE SISTERS AS IT WERE IN A time
[1:49:52] when female names not included. AND
[1:49:54] EVERY ONE OF THEM HAD ISSUES.
[1:49:58] RAHAB WAS IN THERE AS A PROSTITUTE. HE
[1:50:00] COULD HAVE CHOSEN A VIRGIN. HE COULD
[1:50:02] HAVE CHOSEN A SISTER WHO NEVER LEFT
[1:50:04] CHURCH. BUT HE CHOSE RAHAB. HE CHOSE
[1:50:06] TAMAR. HE CHOSE RUTH WHO WAS A MOABITIS
[1:50:10] BECAUSE IT WAS HIS ELECTIVE LOVE.
[1:50:13] HE HAS NEVER COME LOOKING TO FIND A
[1:50:16] PERFECT PEOPLE. HE TAKES IMPERFECT
[1:50:18] PEOPLE TO MAKE THEM PER OH, SOMEBODY
[1:50:20] HELP BACK TO ME.
[1:50:24] THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOD'S WAY. HE SAID,
[1:50:26] "THEY THAT ARE WELL HAVE NO NEED OF A
[1:50:29] PHYSICIAN. THEY THAT ARE OH, COME ON
[1:50:31] NOW. SOMEBODY HELP ME THIS MORNING. THE
[1:50:33] LOVE OF GOD, HOW RICH AND PURE.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; The very definition of God IS LOVE.
[1:50:48] THE BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE Lord
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; to Israel.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Malachi is standing there AND HE STARTS
[1:50:57] OFF BY ACCUSING THEM. LISTEN, I HAVE
[1:50:59] LOVED YOU SAYETH THE LORD. Yet ye say,
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; not God saying.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING THINGS GOD DID NOT
[1:51:08] SAY.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS NEVER CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT
[1:51:12] LOVING YOU.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE REINTERPRETING THE WORD. OH,
[1:51:16] YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. HE SAID,
[1:51:18] "I LOVE YOU." AND THEY SAY, "WHEREIN?"
[1:51:20] HOW? HOW? SHOW ME.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; What do you mean by this thing?
[1:51:27] Anybody with me?
[1:51:33] And God answered them in a way to bully
[1:51:39] to prove the election of God.
[1:51:46] You see God don't need to defend
[1:51:47] himself.
[1:51:49] He said I have loved you sayeth the Lord
[1:51:52] yet he say so I want you to envision
[1:51:54] like a court case
[1:51:56] the accusations. You have here brother
[1:51:58] Clark Malachi saying I have loved you
[1:52:01] said the Lord. But the people responding
[1:52:03] what are you talking about?
[1:52:07] Wherein hast thou loved us? And then God
[1:52:10] through Malachi presents a rebuttal
[1:52:14] to the question how you love me. And the
[1:52:18] rebuttal is, was not Esau, Jacob's
[1:52:21] brother?
[1:52:24] And God start to unveil here a mystery
[1:52:26] about election and choice? Because
[1:52:28] before them boys was born, he say Jacob,
[1:52:31] I love, even I hate. AND IF I SAY I love
[1:52:35] you, I REALLY LOVE YOU. BECAUSE IF I
[1:52:37] HATE YOU, I WILL FINISH YOU.
[1:52:40] You don't hear me this morning. AND THE
[1:52:42] FACT THAT YOU'RE NOT FINISHED MEANS I
[1:52:44] LOVE YOU. OH GOD, YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS
[1:52:46] MORNING. BECAUSE IF I WANTED TO FINISH
[1:52:48] YOU, YOU HAVE BEEN FINISHED A LONG TIME
[1:52:50] AGO. BUT THE GRACE OF GOD IS THE
[1:52:52] EXPRESSION OF THE LOVE OF GOD.
[1:52:56] [Music]
[1:52:58] HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:59] HALLELUJAH.
[1:53:01] HALLELUJAH. IN OTHER WORDS, GOD DIDN'T
[1:53:04] SAY, "I love you. Look how I wake you up
[1:53:06] this morning and look how I give you
[1:53:08] food in your table and look how I put
[1:53:10] money in the bank account." And that's
[1:53:11] not how God expressed his love at all.
[1:53:13] his love. HE SHOWED THEM HOW GREAT HE
[1:53:16] IS.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "ALL THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHO
[1:53:18] I AM." WHEN I SAY I LOVE AND I HATE,
[1:53:21] WHAT I MEAN, HE SAID, "WASN'T it Esau,
[1:53:23] Jacob, brother?" He said, "IF YOU WANT
[1:53:24] TO UNDERSTAND MY LOVE, LET ME SHOW YOU
[1:53:26] WHAT HATE LOOKS LIKE."
[1:53:29] BECAUSE HATE IS THE OPPOSITE OF LOVE.
[1:53:32] SO WHEN YOU SEE WHAT MY HATE LOOKS LIKE,
[1:53:34] TELL ME IF I LOVE YOU.
[1:53:37] HE SAID, "I HATED ESAU AND I LAID HIS
[1:53:41] MOUNTAINS AND HIS HERITAGE WASTE FOR THE
[1:53:43] DRAGONS OF THE WILDERNESS."
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; But George, your heritage is not waste
[1:53:50] for the dragons of the wilderness. Your
[1:53:52] heritage is your children. Your heritage
[1:53:54] IS YOUR GRANDCHILDREN. OR SOMEBODY HELP
[1:53:56] ME THIS MORNING.
[1:54:00] HE SAID, "WHEREAS," LOOK AT GOD'S
[1:54:02] RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION, "HOW YOU LOVE
[1:54:04] ME?" AND GOD SAID, "LET ME SHOW YOU HOW
[1:54:06] WHAT THE OPPOSITE OF MY LOVE LOOKS
[1:54:08] LIKE."
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Whereas Edom," we preached
[1:54:12] this before. Edom is Esau. "Whereas Edom
[1:54:15] say it, we are impoverished, but we will
[1:54:18] return and build the desolate places.
[1:54:21] Thus say the Lord of hosts, they shall
[1:54:23] build, but I will throw down." In other
[1:54:25] words, they will never see the way. When
[1:54:27] God
[1:54:28] doesn't love you, you will never see
[1:54:30] your way. But when GOD LOVES YOU, YOU
[1:54:33] WILL BUILD AND IT WILL STAY STANDING.
[1:54:36] OH, COME ON NOW. SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO
[1:54:38] ME THIS MORNING.
[1:54:44] GOD SAYING, "THE ESAU I HATE, THEY SHALL
[1:54:48] BUILD, but I will throw down, and they
[1:54:51] shall call them the border of
[1:54:52] wickedness, and the people against whom
[1:54:55] the Lord hath indignation forever." and
[1:54:58] your eyes shall see and ye shall see the
[1:55:00] Lord WILL BE MAGNIFIED FROM THE BORDER
[1:55:03] OF ISRAEL.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Do you know the name of the Lord is
[1:55:16] great?
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; The name of the Lord IS A MIGHTY TOWER.
[1:55:18] TODAY HE THE NAME OF THE LORD IS
[1:55:20] TERRIBLE
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; CUZ HE DESTROYS THE WORKS OF DARKNESS.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY BE SEATED.
[1:55:33] HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:34] HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; I heard somebody say recently, if you
[1:55:39] want to be feared, you have to be
[1:55:41] friends with the baddest man in the room
[1:55:44] or be the baddest man in the room.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; If you want to be feared, you need to be
[1:55:51] friends with the baddest man in the room
[1:55:53] or you be the baddest man in the room.
[1:55:54] Well, I got news for you. The God I
[1:55:56] serve is the baddest man in the room
[1:56:03] and he's my friend.
[1:56:06] HE'S MY FATHER. HE'S MY LORD. He's my
[1:56:10] king. HE'S THE KING OF KINGS. DON'T MESS
[1:56:12] WITH ME. HAVE YOU SEEN MY FRIEND? WHAT A
[1:56:15] FRIEND WE HAVE IN JESUS. ALL OUR SINS
[1:56:17] AND GRIEFS TO BEAR.
[1:56:21] LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FRIEND THIS
[1:56:23] MORNING. HE STICKS CLOSER THAN A
[1:56:25] BROTHER. I COULD LEAD ON HIS SHOULDER.
[1:56:27] YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. SOMEBODY
[1:56:30] GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT OF PRAISE.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Could you take some more?
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Could you take some more?
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE LAST SUNDAY OF THE YEAR WE
[1:56:48] GOING IN.
[1:56:57] So from verse one to verse five, God
[1:57:00] dealt with the issue of love. He said,
[1:57:02] "I love you. If I didn't love you, trust
[1:57:04] me, you wouldn't guess about you. You
[1:57:05] will know it."
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? I love you. If I
[1:57:11] didn't love you, you wouldn't be
[1:57:12] wondering. You will know it. BECAUSE THE
[1:57:14] OPPOSITE OF MY LOVE IS HATE.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; JACOB, I LOVE ESAU. I HATE AND I WIPE
[1:57:19] HIM OUT. HE CAN'T COP NOW. WE CAN'T
[1:57:21] CATCH HIS WAY.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU, you're still here. You're still
[1:57:24] in the HOUSE OF GOD. YOU MIGHT BE
[1:57:26] BROKEN, BRUISED, OR BATTERED, BUT YOU'RE
[1:57:27] STILL HERE.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE MY LOVE IS ELECTIVE LOVE. AS
[1:57:31] MANY AS I LOVE, I REBUKE, I CHASEN, I
[1:57:33] CORRECT, I STRAIGHTEN OUT, BUT DON'T GET
[1:57:35] IT TWISTED. I LOVE YOU.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; SO, there's a progression. Brother
[1:57:49] Clarence,
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; bear in mind
[1:57:53] you could have issue with different
[1:57:56] prophets and tribe and the father and
[1:57:59] the but Malachi is different. We know
[1:58:01] nothing about the man.
[1:58:04] He just packing a burden. So he he
[1:58:07] starts almost top down. He start with
[1:58:09] the love of God
[1:58:11] as the first accusation in this
[1:58:13] courtroom. Brother Steven and he goes
[1:58:16] deeper. Are you with me? Anybody
[1:58:17] sleeping? Just look and look person next
[1:58:18] to you and make sure everybody awake.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; GOD THROUGH Malachi and he says in verse
[1:58:34] six, "A son honorth his father
[1:58:39] and a servant his master."
[1:58:43] Now I want us to look at the word honor.
[1:58:47] Because if you are a son, do you honor
[1:58:50] your father? God is making an assumption
[1:58:53] here through Malachi that sons honor
[1:58:55] their fathers
[1:59:01] because the assumption is a foundation
[1:59:03] for where he wants to go next.
[1:59:06] So I want to tell you, you're really out
[1:59:08] of pocket if you're not honoring
[1:59:11] your father.
[1:59:14] and as a servant
[1:59:16] honoring your master because that is
[1:59:19] scripture.
[1:59:21] Anybody here?
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Now we have nobody to get vexed with in
[1:59:26] Malachi because we know nothing about
[1:59:27] him. We don't know his address. We don't
[1:59:31] know his tribe. We don't know his
[1:59:33] location. So don't get vexed with me or
[1:59:35] with him. You can't find him. You can't
[1:59:36] find me.
[1:59:42] He said, son honorth his father and a
[1:59:45] servant his master. IF THEN I be a
[1:59:48] father.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; This is God talking NOW BECAUSE I
[1:59:53] WATCHING WHAT HAPPENING AND I SEEING
[1:59:55] SONS honoring fathers and SERVANTS
[1:59:57] HONORING MASTERS. IF I
[2:00:00] BE A father
[2:00:03] where is my honor?
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Do we still honor the Lord?
[2:00:14] BECAUSE WHAT GOD WAS SEEING, BROTHER
[2:00:16] GEORGE, IS I'm not getting the honor.
[2:00:20] I'm watching and in the human context,
[2:00:23] I'm seeing honoring taking place, but
[2:00:26] I'm not seeing the equivalent honor to
[2:00:28] me because I'm watching the natural man
[2:00:31] operating in their homes. I see what
[2:00:33] they do for Christmas. They buy
[2:00:35] Christmas gift, they do this, THEY HAVE
[2:00:37] THING AND ALL THAT HAPPEN IN THE CARNAL
[2:00:39] REALM.
[2:00:41] What about me?
[2:00:43] How could we have God asking where is my
[2:00:47] honor?
[2:00:51] This is the burden of the word of the
[2:00:54] Lord through the last prophet of the Old
[2:00:57] Testament. In other words, as you said,
[2:00:59] before God drops the mic,
[2:01:02] before the last prophet finishes
[2:01:04] speaking AND BEFORE GOD SAYS AFTER THIS,
[2:01:06] I'M DONE TALKING. BECAUSE WHEN MALACHI
[2:01:09] FINISHED 400 YEARS OF SILENCE, THE ONLY
[2:01:12] person who CAME AFTER HIM WAS THE LORD
[2:01:14] HIMSELF.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me?
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; The next prophet that came after
[2:01:21] Malachi, everybody, the Lord Jesus
[2:01:22] Christ, A SON OF MAN.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; JOHN WAS JUST A FORERUNNER. JOHN WAS THE
[2:01:28] appetizer to the meal.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; JOHN WAS JUST CLEARING THE PATH. JOHN
[2:01:33] WAS ROLLING ON THE RED CARPET.
[2:01:37] But when God was done, he said after
[2:01:39] man, I have nothing to say because I I
[2:01:42] can't leave man to deal with this
[2:01:43] anymore because I need to come for
[2:01:46] myself. You don't hear me this morning.
[2:01:51] Malachi ended the age of the Old
[2:01:54] Testament prophets
[2:01:57] AND FOR 400 YEARS GOD SAY no more
[2:01:59] talking.
[2:02:05] Can we go on?
[2:02:07] The Lord saying, and I want you to get
[2:02:09] this, a son honoreth his father. I hope
[2:02:11] you're with me. I hope you
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; and a servant his master. If then I be a
[2:02:16] father, where is mine honor? And if I be
[2:02:18] a master, where's my fear?
[2:02:21] Say the Lord of hosts unto you,
[2:02:24] oh priests that despise my name. The
[2:02:28] Lord speaking of Can we go on? And the
[2:02:32] same way in the first time they asked,
[2:02:34] "How you love us?
[2:02:36] These people don't even know how to
[2:02:38] despise his name. So they ask the
[2:02:40] question
[2:02:42] and you say wherein have we despised thy
[2:02:45] name? Listen to this now church. Ye
[2:02:49] offer polluted bread
[2:02:52] upon mine altar
[2:02:55] and ye say on top OF THAT TO SHOW YOU
[2:02:57] HOW PEOPLE DON'T EVEN understand the
[2:02:59] sacredness of the things of God. the
[2:03:02] sacred because you are priest in your
[2:03:05] home. YOU ARE ROYAL PRIESTHOOD. SO THIS
[2:03:08] is addressing the old testament priests
[2:03:09] but we are priests in our own right. So
[2:03:13] there's an application to us here now.
[2:03:15] Are we together?
[2:03:19] You offer polluted bread upon mine altar
[2:03:21] and you say wherein have we polluted
[2:03:23] thee? In that you say the table of the
[2:03:26] Lord is contemptable.
[2:03:34] In other words, you don't have to pay it
[2:03:35] much mind.
[2:03:37] You can come to church how you want. You
[2:03:40] could approach the house of God any way.
[2:03:43] As a priest, you don't have to take
[2:03:45] things too seriously. It's not that
[2:03:48] serious.
[2:03:52] Verse eight.
[2:03:54] AND HE OFFERED THE BLIND FOR SACRIFICE.
[2:03:57] Is it not evil? What is he referring to
[2:03:59] here? You would remember church that
[2:04:01] when the priest had to offer a lamb for
[2:04:03] a house, you had to inspect the lamb to
[2:04:07] make sure there was no blemish. The lamb
[2:04:09] wasn't crippled, there was no deformity.
[2:04:12] It had to be a perfect lamb.
[2:04:15] He was saying, "You are so backsliden.
[2:04:18] Nobody could accuse you of not bringing
[2:04:20] your offering or your sacrifice, but
[2:04:22] what you bring is not worthy.
[2:04:26] IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S A FORM OF
[2:04:28] GODLINESS, but denying the power. So you
[2:04:32] you can say, well, but I was in church,
[2:04:34] but how are you in church?
[2:04:38] BUT I BRING A SACRIFICE. WHAT SACRIFICE
[2:04:40] DID you bring? BECAUSE THE SACRIFICE
[2:04:42] SUPPOSED TO BE WITHOUT BLEMISH. It's
[2:04:44] supposed to BE A PURE SACRIFICE. SO
[2:04:46] LISTEN TO GOD. ADDRESSING THE WAY THAT
[2:04:49] THEY APPROACH NOW AND I WANT TO BRING it
[2:04:50] to the message.
[2:04:54] If you offer the blind for sacrifice, is
[2:04:56] it not evil? And if you offer the lame
[2:04:59] and THE SICK, IN OTHER WORDS, they're
[2:05:01] just doing the priestly duty and they
[2:05:03] they don't care.
[2:05:05] Anything is anything. You have a lamb,
[2:05:07] bring it. They're not even inspecting it
[2:05:09] anymore.
[2:05:12] Are we together?
[2:05:14] They lost the sincerity.
[2:05:16] They lost the burden. They lost the
[2:05:19] sacredness.
[2:05:20] It's not that THEY DON'T KNOW BETTER.
[2:05:22] THEY KNOW BETTER, but they're not doing
[2:05:23] better. And we'll see now a scripture in
[2:05:25] a short while.
[2:05:28] And listen, and this I want to bring
[2:05:30] this to a point here because we talk
[2:05:32] about son, father, servant, master. And
[2:05:36] then God through Malachi SAYING, "OFFER
[2:05:38] IT NOW UNTO THY GOVERNOR." In other
[2:05:40] words, the government you're treating
[2:05:43] better than me. often
[2:05:46] if now unto the governor will he be
[2:05:48] pleased with thee or accept thy person
[2:05:50] said the Lord of hosts SO GOD IS USING
[2:05:52] OTHER WORDS TO SAY YOU YOU'RE NOT even
[2:05:54] going to do that for the government
[2:05:57] BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOUSE of God
[2:05:59] anything is anything
[2:06:06] say the Lord of hosts and now I pray you
[2:06:08] beseech God that he will be gracious
[2:06:10] unto us
[2:06:12] this had been by your means will regard
[2:06:15] your person, said the Lord of hosts.
[2:06:19] Who is there even among you in verse 10
[2:06:21] that should that would shut the doors
[2:06:23] for not?
[2:06:30] In other words, he's saying who will
[2:06:32] scream to shut it down
[2:06:35] so you don't do this filthiness.
[2:06:37] In other words, someone to shut down the
[2:06:39] foolishness.
[2:06:41] Say enough is enough.
[2:06:43] Is there even among you that would shut
[2:06:46] the doors for not. Neither do ye kindle
[2:06:49] fire on my altar for not. I have no
[2:06:52] pleasure in you, said the Lord of hosts,
[2:06:54] neither will I accept an offering at
[2:06:56] your hand.
[2:06:58] And this is where we get the scripture.
[2:06:59] FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN, even unto
[2:07:01] the going down of the same, my name
[2:07:04] shall be great among the Gentiles, and
[2:07:07] in every place incense shall be offered
[2:07:10] unto my name, and a pure offering. For
[2:07:13] my name shall be great among the
[2:07:14] heathen, say the Lord of hosts. But ye
[2:07:18] have profained it in that ye say the
[2:07:21] Lord, the table of the Lord is polluted,
[2:07:24] and the fruit thereof, even his meat is
[2:07:27] contemptable.
[2:07:28] And listen to this part. He said also,
[2:07:31] behold, what a weariness is it. In other
[2:07:36] words, he is saying the church is saying
[2:07:38] this thing tiring boy
[2:07:44] God watching their attitude towards the
[2:07:47] things of God and he's saying you say
[2:07:51] what is so much work had to go into this
[2:07:54] thing
[2:07:59] so much effort so much sacrifice so much
[2:08:01] praying so much seeking so much reading
[2:08:04] so much work into the ministry. So much
[2:08:06] work into this thing.
[2:08:09] Talk about the spirit of the age that
[2:08:10] we're dealing with. And he have snuffed
[2:08:12] at it,
[2:08:16] sayeth the Lord of hosts. And he brought
[2:08:18] that which was torn
[2:08:22] and the lame
[2:08:24] and the sick.
[2:08:26] Thus he brought an offering. Should I
[2:08:28] accept this of your hand? Say the Lord.
[2:08:33] Verse 14. But curse be the deceiver
[2:08:36] which hath in his flock a male
[2:08:40] and voweth and sacrifice it unto the
[2:08:43] Lord a corrupt thing. What is God saying
[2:08:46] here?
[2:08:47] He's saying in other words, you are not
[2:08:50] giving God your best.
[2:08:53] You're choosing to give God the extra
[2:08:56] whatever remain. You're giving God the
[2:08:58] extra time, the extra resources, the
[2:09:01] after YOU FIX UP YOURSELF and your
[2:09:03] family. Whatever left over is what God
[2:09:05] get.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; He say CURSED BE THE MAN WHO HAVE
[2:09:09] SOMETHING THAT HE COULD OFFER to the
[2:09:10] Lord
[2:09:12] and instead OF OFFERING YOUR BEST TO THE
[2:09:14] LORD, you just offering something AND
[2:09:17] YOU HAVE BETTER to give. In other words,
[2:09:19] you have more time, more commitment, you
[2:09:22] have more interest. So something. So
[2:09:24] this is why it HAS TO BE A BURDEN TO YOU
[2:09:25] TO RECOGNIZE. Am I doing enough
[2:09:30] for the Lord?
[2:09:34] I was about to say
[2:09:37] I have too much more left. But
[2:09:41] but over say preacher before I can even
[2:09:43] get this.
[2:09:46] But the reason I'm saying this is we're
[2:09:47] coming to the end of another year and I
[2:09:50] want you to ask yourself the question,
[2:09:53] did I give the Lord my best in this?
[2:09:57] Did I really give the Lord my best?
[2:10:02] Did I really give God his honor?
[2:10:06] That's due to his name. If you were to
[2:10:08] order, you know, when you go to school,
[2:10:10] you have a end of term report. If there
[2:10:12] was a end of year report for 2025
[2:10:16] and God was saying let me how this
[2:10:18] brother did for the year. How the sister
[2:10:21] did for the year. Let me give end the
[2:10:23] year report
[2:10:25] of who really give their all. They
[2:10:27] really give their all in prayer and
[2:10:28] worship and their offering and their
[2:10:30] tithes and their support to the church
[2:10:32] and ministry and prayer and offering
[2:10:34] themselves and not just the way they
[2:10:37] want to but in every aspect. They have
[2:10:39] given God their all and their best and
[2:10:41] the first Not as you say blind and lame
[2:10:44] and you have a meal but you even give a
[2:10:46] meal because you're giving something
[2:10:47] else whatever you're just grabbing
[2:10:48] anything. In other words, you wake up in
[2:10:50] the morning to go to church and whoever
[2:10:51] just putting on anything and I'm going
[2:10:52] up and no sincerity, no passion, no
[2:10:56] zeal.
[2:10:57] This is not to accuse anybody. This is
[2:10:59] this is a reflection because this was
[2:11:01] the last message God left with the Old
[2:11:03] Testament
[2:11:05] before he say I'm not talking anymore.
[2:11:07] Jesus himself have to come to deal with
[2:11:09] what happens next. Anybody with me this
[2:11:11] morning?
[2:11:13] The burden of the word of the Lord.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; That last verse there, verse 14, be c
[2:11:21] but cursed be the deceiver which hath in
[2:11:24] his flock a male and boweth and
[2:11:26] sacrifice it unto the Lord a corrupt
[2:11:28] thing. For I am a great king, sayeth the
[2:11:30] Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful
[2:11:32] among the heen.
[2:11:35] I don't think we're going to get to
[2:11:36] finish all of it in this service.
[2:11:43] I think I have to some Bible study.
[2:11:47] We can take a little more. We can take a
[2:11:48] little more.
[2:11:54] I will skip part of Malachi 2 and go to
[2:11:59] I want to go to 2 verse 10
[2:12:02] before we move on to three and then we
[2:12:04] touch four. So Malachi 2 verse 10. Have
[2:12:07] we not all one father.
[2:12:11] So that is that's the word. Now have we
[2:12:13] not all one father? Have not one god
[2:12:16] created us? Why do we deal treacherously
[2:12:19] every man against
[2:12:21] his brother by profaining the covenant
[2:12:25] of our fathers?
[2:12:29] Judah had dealt treacherously
[2:12:32] and an abomination is committed in
[2:12:34] Israel and in Jerusalem. For Jerusalem
[2:12:37] had profained the holiness of the Lord
[2:12:39] which he loved and had married the
[2:12:42] daughter of a strange court.
[2:12:45] So I'm placing it in scripture where
[2:12:48] brother Brandham says under no
[2:12:49] circumstance should a believer marry an
[2:12:51] unbeliever to show you this thing is all
[2:12:55] true scripture
[2:12:57] because God is saying aren't we brothers
[2:12:59] under the covenant? Why would you step
[2:13:00] outside of the covenant to marry someone
[2:13:03] of a strange God?
[2:13:06] Because the word is your defense. The
[2:13:08] scripture is your protection. If you
[2:13:10] don't understand these things, you'll
[2:13:11] find yourself in problems.
[2:13:13] Listen to God in verse 12. The Lord will
[2:13:16] cut off the man that doeth this, the
[2:13:19] master and the scholar out of the
[2:13:21] tabernacles of Jacob and him that
[2:13:23] offered an offering unto the Lord of
[2:13:25] hosts.
[2:13:29] Let's go on. He's coming into the home.
[2:13:32] It's a lot. Malachi dealt with it. Verse
[2:13:34] 14. Yet you say, "WHEREFORE, BECAUSE THE
[2:13:36] LORD hath been witness between thee and
[2:13:39] the wife of thy youth," he coming into
[2:13:41] marriage now. YOU SEE, THE LORD IS
[2:13:43] WITNESS TO THE MARRIAGE.
[2:13:47] Against whom thou hast dealt
[2:13:48] treacherously, yet is she thy companion
[2:13:51] and the wife of thy covenant, and did
[2:13:53] not he make one? Yet had he the residue
[2:13:57] of the spirit, and wherefore one, that
[2:13:59] you might seek a godly seed. Therefore,
[2:14:01] take heed to your spirit, and let none
[2:14:04] deal treacherously against the wife of
[2:14:06] his youth. FOR THE LORD, THE GOD OF
[2:14:10] ISRAEL, SAID HE HATED putting away.
[2:14:14] You see much stuff Malachi
[2:14:18] presents as the last message.
[2:14:26] Malachi 3 verse one,
[2:14:29] BEHOLD I WILL SEND MY messenger and he
[2:14:32] shall prepare the way before me. We know
[2:14:34] this is John the Baptist. And the Lord
[2:14:36] whom you seek shall suddenly come to his
[2:14:38] temple even the messenger of the
[2:14:39] covenant whom ye delight in. Behold he
[2:14:43] shall come say the Lord of hosts. But
[2:14:45] who may abide the day of his coming and
[2:14:47] who shall stand when he appeared? For he
[2:14:49] is like a refiner's fire and like full
[2:14:51] of soap. And he shall sit as a refiner
[2:14:54] and purifier of silver. AND HE SHALL
[2:14:56] PURIFY THE SONS OF LEVI AND PURGE THEM
[2:14:59] AS GOLD and silver that they may offer
[2:15:02] unto the Lord an offering of
[2:15:05] righteousness. So he was speaking now
[2:15:07] about the Lord Jesus himself coming now.
[2:15:09] Are we there? And when he comes, he will
[2:15:12] set everything right. When Jesus comes,
[2:15:14] he'll put everything in order. Verse
[2:15:17] four, then shall the offering of Judah
[2:15:19] and Jerusalem be pleasant under the
[2:15:21] Lord, as in the days of old, and as in
[2:15:24] former years. And I will come near to
[2:15:26] you to judgment. And I will be a swift
[2:15:29] witness against the sorcerers, and
[2:15:31] against the adulterers, and against
[2:15:33] false swears, and against those that
[2:15:36] oppress the hiling in his wages, the
[2:15:38] widow, and the fatherless, that turn
[2:15:40] aside a stranger from his right. and
[2:15:43] fear not me, sayeth the Lord of hosts,
[2:15:45] for I AM THE LORD. I CHANGE NOT.
[2:15:48] THEREFORE, YE sons of Jacob are not
[2:15:50] consumed.
[2:15:54] Are we together?
[2:15:56] Verse seven, even from the days of your
[2:15:59] fathers are ye gone away from mine
[2:16:02] ordinances
[2:16:03] and have not kept them. So this whole
[2:16:07] passage of Malachi is trying to
[2:16:09] straighten out the people for whom God
[2:16:11] has done things from Genesis all the way
[2:16:13] to then. And God is going to put in the
[2:16:15] final statement before the Lord Jesus
[2:16:17] comes.
[2:16:20] Return unto me.
[2:16:22] If anybody has lost their way,
[2:16:25] return unto me. And he promises and I
[2:16:30] will return unto you.
[2:16:32] Friends, this is here is a promisory. He
[2:16:35] says, "Return unto me and I will return
[2:16:38] unto you, sayeth the Lord of hosts." But
[2:16:41] he said, "Wherein shall we return?" In
[2:16:43] other words, was the passage back to
[2:16:45] return. This is scripture. Then he goes
[2:16:47] on. So this is now all in context
[2:16:50] because people read scriptures in bits
[2:16:52] and pieces and they don't understand the
[2:16:54] context of God. Will a man rob God?
[2:16:58] Yet he have robbed me. But he say
[2:17:00] wherein have we robbed thee? tithes and
[2:17:03] offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse,
[2:17:05] for ye have robbed me even this whole
[2:17:08] nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the
[2:17:11] storehouse that there may be meat in my
[2:17:14] house and prove me now herewith, sayeth
[2:17:18] the Lord of hosts. SO THERE IS A ASPECT
[2:17:20] OF THIS THAT PEOPLE DON'T EVEN
[2:17:22] UNDERSTAND. WHEN YOU BRING YOUR TITHES
[2:17:24] AND OFFERINGS, YOU HAVE TO NOW prove
[2:17:25] God.
[2:17:27] Hold him to his word. PROVE ME NOW
[2:17:30] HEREWITH. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS AN
[2:17:32] OPPORTUNITY TO SAY, I want to prove you,
[2:17:35] Lord, BECAUSE I'M DOING YOUR WORD. ALL
[2:17:38] OF THIS, I WANT YOU TO STUDY THIS out
[2:17:39] for yourself because you have to know
[2:17:41] this.
[2:17:43] Prove me. Now, hear it, say the Lord of
[2:17:45] hosts. If in doing this, I will not open
[2:17:49] you the windows of heaven.
[2:17:53] So, there is a blessing in obedience.
[2:17:55] This is why obedience is better THAN
[2:17:57] SACRIFICE BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANT
[2:17:59] TO OBEY. BUT HERE IN THE SHOW, PROVE ME.
[2:18:01] IN other words, put me to the test.
[2:18:04] Do this and watch me work for you. This
[2:18:07] is the word now.
[2:18:09] Say, IF I WILL NOT OPEN YOU THE WINDOWS
[2:18:12] OF HEAVEN, LISTEN, AND POUR YOU OUT A
[2:18:15] BLESSING THAT THERE shall not be room
[2:18:18] enough to receive it.
[2:18:26] Listen church, this was the burden of
[2:18:28] the word of the Lord. So this was
[2:18:31] important to God to ensure that the
[2:18:34] people understand that they are the only
[2:18:36] ones hindering their blessing here. He
[2:18:37] said, "Return unto me. If that's on you,
[2:18:39] return to me. I'll return to you. CLEAN
[2:18:42] UP YOUR SACRIFICE. UNDERSTAND MY LOVE.
[2:18:45] DO YOUR PART. I'LL DO MY PART. Prove me.
[2:18:48] AND SEE IF THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN DON'T
[2:18:50] GET OPENED UP FOR YOU TILL YOU HAVE
[2:18:52] BLESSING THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN RECEIVE.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't end there. He says in
[2:19:03] doing this, he said, "And I will rebuke
[2:19:06] the devourer."
[2:19:08] So it's not even up to you to rebuke the
[2:19:10] devourer. What is the devourer? That
[2:19:12] thing draining out your life, eating out
[2:19:13] your resources, eating out your mind,
[2:19:15] eating out devouring you. word or
[2:19:19] I will rebuke the for your sakes and he
[2:19:22] shall not destroy the fruits of your
[2:19:25] ground.
[2:19:27] You trying to do things in this world,
[2:19:29] you trying to achieve things and there's
[2:19:31] a destruction of the fruit of the
[2:19:33] ground. Neither shall your vine cast off
[2:19:36] fruit before the time in the field. In
[2:19:37] other words, you're expecting a crop is
[2:19:39] a TYPE HERE AND BEFORE THE TIME IT MASH
[2:19:42] UP. He's saying there's a PRINCIPLE IN
[2:19:45] THERE BECAUSE GOD THROUGHOUT EVERY ONE
[2:19:47] OF THESE THINGS WHAT GOD IS LOOKING FOR
[2:19:49] your best to know the best your best
[2:19:51] worship your best attitude put God first
[2:19:54] people put in there he he blasted there
[2:19:56] you putting the government first you're
[2:19:57] putting your employer first you're
[2:19:58] putting your family first you're putting
[2:20:00] everything else first and God is BEING
[2:20:02] SECOND PLACE IN EVERY ONE OF THESE
[2:20:03] scriptures
[2:20:07] I trust out of this service you will
[2:20:10] leave here pledging to put God first not
[2:20:12] just in well I love God or no put God
[2:20:16] against your job. Put God first over
[2:20:18] your family. Put God first over the
[2:20:20] government. Put God first over your
[2:20:22] marriage. Put God first over your
[2:20:24] children. Put God first over your
[2:20:25] finances. PUT GOD FIRST OVER THE DOCTOR.
[2:20:28] PUT GOD FIRST OVER EVERY OPPRESSION. PUT
[2:20:30] GOD FIRST. AND WATCH EVERY PRINCIPALITY.
[2:20:33] BOW. WATCH EVERY SITUATION. BOW. HE
[2:20:35] SAID, "SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD
[2:20:38] AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND EVERYTHING
[2:20:41] ELSE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WILL BE
[2:20:42] ADDED UNTO YOU." THAT IS STILL THE WORD
[2:20:45] OF THE LIVING GOD.
[2:20:48] AND IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME TO GO BACK
[2:20:50] TO THE WORD, IT'S NOW.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "I WILL REBUKE THE DEVOURER."
[2:20:55] SO, IN OTHER WORDS, GOD BATTLE FOR YOU
[2:20:57] ONCE YOU PUT HIM FIRST.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; It is not that God needs you to do
[2:21:04] things, but God's love for you comes
[2:21:07] with something. You tell me you love
[2:21:08] God. How you love God? By you have to
[2:21:10] show it. You have to do things. You have
[2:21:12] to act it. AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A
[2:21:14] LEVEL OF FAITH AND TRUST IN GOD.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; But you want to trust yourself and trust
[2:21:21] your ability and trust what you could do
[2:21:22] and trust what you could achieve. And
[2:21:24] God is saying, "Put me first and watch
[2:21:25] me work.
[2:21:28] Acknowledge me in all your ways and I
[2:21:30] will direct your path. You don't know
[2:21:31] how to go, acknowledge me. You don't
[2:21:33] know what to do, acknowledge me. You
[2:21:34] don't know where to go, acknowledge me.
[2:21:36] You don't know how to approach your
[2:21:37] situation, BRING ME BRING ME IN. BRING
[2:21:40] ME IN. PUT HIM ON YOUR BOARD OF
[2:21:42] DIRECTORS. COME ON NOW, SOMEBODY HELP
[2:21:44] ME. PUT HIM IN YOUR CAR AND WATCH HIM
[2:21:46] WORK.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; INVITE HIM INTO YOUR HOUSE AND WATCH HIM
[2:21:50] WORK. DON'T LEAVE HIM OUTSIDE. HE WANTS
[2:21:52] FULL PERMISSION TO move into your life.
[2:21:54] Move into your heart.
[2:21:59] GOD HAS SAID, "WHERE'S MY HONOR?
[2:22:02] Where is my honor?"
[2:22:05] Is there honor for the Lord in your
[2:22:06] home?
[2:22:11] I'm not trying to make you feel guilty
[2:22:13] or feel bad, but over the Christmas
[2:22:15] season, could the Lord have walked into
[2:22:17] your home?
[2:22:19] Could you have invited him to your
[2:22:20] Christmas lunch?
[2:22:23] Would you have been comfortable him to
[2:22:25] sit at the table of your Christmas
[2:22:26] dinner?
[2:22:31] If it wasn't that way this year, fix it.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; Because he promised to come suddenly
[2:22:36] into this temple.
[2:22:41] If you're not going to honor God, who
[2:22:42] will? Because the world not going to do
[2:22:43] it?
[2:22:48] Honor me with your time, with your
[2:22:50] effort. See, I say to young people, what
[2:22:53] what job you have, what education you
[2:22:55] have. If God didn't give you brains
[2:23:00] to write an exam, you could study all
[2:23:02] you want and if your brain shut up in
[2:23:03] the exam day, write nothing.
[2:23:07] If your hand freeze in the exam room,
[2:23:10] you write nothing.
[2:23:14] If it's not for the grace of God, you
[2:23:15] have nothing to write. Nothing to get.
[2:23:18] Nothing to do. YOU HAVE NO CREDIT TO
[2:23:20] GET. IT'S NOT YOURS. IT'S THE LORD'S
[2:23:22] DOING.
[2:23:25] IT'S NOT YOUR CAR. IT'S THE LORD'S CAR.
[2:23:28] THAT'S FOR HIS GLORY AND HIS HONOR.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T ICE.
[2:23:35] Do you understand? In this realm,
[2:23:37] nothing belongs to you.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? Nothing belongs to
[2:23:43] you. You don't even belong to you.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; YOU BELONG TO GOD.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING BELONGS TO GOD. YOUR BODY IS
[2:23:50] A TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST. YOUR BODY
[2:23:53] BELONGS TO GOD. YOUR HOUSE BELONGS TO
[2:23:55] GOD. YOUR CAR BELONGS TO GOD. YOUR
[2:23:57] CHILDREN BELONG TO GOD.
[2:24:00] Honor him
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; AND WATCH GOD BLESS YOU.
[2:24:13] People want to honor God in part.
[2:24:18] Honoring God is honoring his word.
[2:24:22] People leave quotes of well you have to
[2:24:25] have a home church. That is the word.
[2:24:26] How you operate out of a home church.
[2:24:28] How you operate outside the five-fold
[2:24:30] ministry who are ordained for the
[2:24:32] perfecting of the saints, the work of
[2:24:33] the ministry until we all COME IN. HOW
[2:24:36] YOU GOING TO STEP OUT OF THAT AND FEEL
[2:24:37] going into into the rapture is
[2:24:39] delusional?
[2:24:44] I don't want to be bad, but you realize
[2:24:46] there are more people outside of
[2:24:50] I didn't say it.
[2:24:54] Let it not be said, I said it. It have
[2:24:57] more people outside and inside wherever
[2:24:59] that place is
[2:25:02] because a spirit of delusion because
[2:25:04] people want to the god of their own
[2:25:05] imagination.
[2:25:08] It's either you want God or you don't
[2:25:10] want God. It's either you believe the
[2:25:12] message or you do not believe the
[2:25:14] message. It's either you want to go into
[2:25:16] the rapture, you don't want TO GO TO THE
[2:25:17] RAPTURE. IS IT YOU ACCEPT ALL THE WORD
[2:25:19] OR YOU'RE PLAYING GAMES?
[2:25:29] And I will rebuke the devourer for your
[2:25:31] sakes,
[2:25:32] and he shall not destroy the fruits of
[2:25:35] your ground. Neither shall your vine
[2:25:38] cast her fruit before the time in the
[2:25:40] field, sayeth the Lord of hosts. And all
[2:25:43] nation shall call you blessed, for ye
[2:25:45] shall be a delightome land, sayeth the
[2:25:48] Lord of hosts.
[2:25:51] You don't want that blessing.
[2:26:01] Young people, listen here now. Verse 13.
[2:26:05] Your words have been stout against me,
[2:26:11] sayeth the Lord.
[2:26:14] Stout means harsh. In other words, you
[2:26:16] have spoken harsh against God. So God is
[2:26:20] weighing what you say about him.
[2:26:24] You know the other day I tease my
[2:26:26] daughter and I say we have church
[2:26:29] this even church again
[2:26:36] don't worry she under the age of account
[2:26:38] she's six
[2:26:42] but many times but you know young people
[2:26:44] if you tell them we go and lime again or
[2:26:46] we going and have a fun time again you
[2:26:47] say let's go
[2:26:50] as brother Andrew Glover preached He
[2:26:52] said when you have an expectation with
[2:26:54] even when you go to sleep you remember
[2:26:56] the expectation. If I tell my daughter
[2:26:58] we go to walk the park in the morning
[2:27:00] and I tell in the night when you wake up
[2:27:01] in the morning the first thing you say
[2:27:03] daddy we still going to the park sleep
[2:27:05] air change the expectation or
[2:27:08] many of us have tiresome it is we have
[2:27:11] church again
[2:27:14] after I went to Uganda in September and
[2:27:16] had 17 services in three four days.
[2:27:20] It redefined what tiredness ever looked
[2:27:23] like. You know,
[2:27:28] it was four services per day.
[2:27:33] Sister Emran, to be honest, when I saw
[2:27:34] the schedule, I'm a faith shaker.
[2:27:39] And I'm a preacher.
[2:27:43] I don't want to say I had unbelief, but
[2:27:45] it was it was close.
[2:27:50] four services a day and I had a morning
[2:27:53] devotion before the four services.
[2:28:00] I asked the host pastor I said the
[2:28:03] ministers need to go to the morning
[2:28:06] devotion
[2:28:11] because we had flown in the night was
[2:28:14] got very early in the morning. What time
[2:28:16] in the morning was it on? Friday. I
[2:28:18] think it was 5 a.m.
[2:28:24] But it reframes you because by the time
[2:28:26] I got there into the service,
[2:28:29] well, he gave us a pass on that
[2:28:31] particular that morning
[2:28:37] wipes out. But by the last service
[2:28:40] reach, I was blown away at the zeal and
[2:28:44] the enthusiasm of the people. And you
[2:28:47] know what was amazing and mind-blowing?
[2:28:49] The place we had the meeting was a
[2:28:51] school with almost like a uh you know
[2:28:55] one of those like beaches. So it's like
[2:28:57] seats into like a stadium. But at Pwell
[2:29:00] there was no back to the seat.
[2:29:04] So you couldn't lean back.
[2:29:07] Maybe that's what we need.
[2:29:12] Maybe that's what we need. Maybe church
[2:29:16] just too comfortable.
[2:29:20] But with Lynon 16 services with no back
[2:29:23] rest.
[2:29:26] You either you have to be on your toes.
[2:29:27] You have to be on your toes.
[2:29:33] But it's an awareness because when you
[2:29:35] realize and this is why for some of us
[2:29:37] God has to treat us and put us in
[2:29:40] certain places because if things all
[2:29:42] right our nature is to get lazy and
[2:29:44] comfortable and complacent
[2:29:47] but when you go to places where people
[2:29:49] have it tough and they're rough and the
[2:29:51] situation is there and you have to now
[2:29:53] trust God because you really don't know
[2:29:56] where your next meal coming from. And
[2:29:58] there's a level of gratefulness with I
[2:30:00] don't know how it worked out but it
[2:30:02] worked out is a different operation.
[2:30:08] So this is why sometimes God allows
[2:30:10] situation to come and is unfortunate
[2:30:13] because sometime it takes sickness to
[2:30:14] get us more sincere. It takes something
[2:30:16] happening with the family. It takes
[2:30:18] losing job. It happen with your wife.
[2:30:20] WHATEVER IT IS TO DRIVE US BECAUSE GOD
[2:30:22] SAYS nothing must take the place of
[2:30:25] relationship with you and I.
[2:30:28] I AM YOUR FATHER. I AM YOUR LORD. I AM
[2:30:31] YOUR SUPPLIER.
[2:30:33] How could God be the source of your
[2:30:35] supply? But you more respectful to your
[2:30:37] boss on the job.
[2:30:39] And the Bible say give honor to the boss
[2:30:41] in the job. But the honor for God must
[2:30:43] be higher than
[2:30:48] brother but George is a lesson to all of
[2:30:49] us to know because people freed. You see
[2:30:53] how the Bible said in Malachi where is
[2:30:55] my fear? God asked the question would he
[2:30:58] say if I'm a master where is my fear
[2:31:02] people fear to reach later on in the job
[2:31:04] and you see we looking like we heading
[2:31:06] into recession here now people job on
[2:31:08] the line
[2:31:10] our oil production is lower our gas
[2:31:12] production is lower they just come
[2:31:15] January the 1st they're going to raise
[2:31:16] import duties customs duties this in the
[2:31:18] news what does that mean it means
[2:31:20] economically the cost of everything
[2:31:23] being imported
[2:31:25] will now be more exp expensive
[2:31:28] So what what who who who you going to
[2:31:30] trust?
[2:31:32] But I can guarantee you if God opened
[2:31:34] doors for you, then no man could trust
[2:31:36] it enough.
[2:31:39] If it have five deals to get in your
[2:31:41] business and it have 15 competitors, if
[2:31:44] God on your side, brother Papwell, God
[2:31:47] make it that when you drive down the
[2:31:48] road, BY THE TIME YOU DROP ONE PERSON
[2:31:50] OFF HERE, THE PERSON WAITING RIGHT there
[2:31:52] to go in and WHEN YOU GO LOWER DOWN,
[2:31:54] somebody leaves, SOMEBODY ELSE COME IN.
[2:31:55] ALL THEM OTHER MAXIM TRYING TO FIGURE
[2:31:57] OUT HOW HE ALWAYS IS DOING THAT. BUT THE
[2:31:59] LORD CLEARING A PATH, SLOWING DOWN CARS
[2:32:01] HERE, STOPPING TRAFFIC LIGHT HERE. YOU
[2:32:04] DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING.
[2:32:08] GOD IS ABLE TO ENSURE THAT YOU ARE
[2:32:10] BLESSED WHEN YOU PUT HIM FIRST. THAT'S
[2:32:13] HIS OBLIGATION TO YOU. HE SAID, "I WILL
[2:32:16] REBUKE THE DEVOURER. ANYTHING COMING
[2:32:18] AFTER YOU, I WILL COME AFTER IT. I WILL
[2:32:20] REBUKE IT MYSELF. I WILL STOP THE ATTACK
[2:32:23] OF THE ENEMY.
[2:32:26] THAT'S THE COVERING UNDER WHICH I WANT
[2:32:28] TO LIVE ALL THE TIME.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; We sing this song. I don't feel no way
[2:32:36] tired.
[2:32:38] Friends, I'm not talking about tiredness
[2:32:40] of body here
[2:32:42] because we will get tired. Jesus got
[2:32:44] tired. But you can't get tired of the
[2:32:47] mission.
[2:32:49] You can't get tired of the call upon
[2:32:51] your life.
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, you get physically tired. You're
[2:32:54] you're human. Let's not let's not paint
[2:32:56] the picture that you in church and you
[2:32:58] didn't work. You woke the whole night in
[2:33:00] church and I No, no. Humanness. There'll
[2:33:03] be tired moments, but don't get tired of
[2:33:05] this fight.
[2:33:07] Don't get tired of the prayers. Don't
[2:33:10] get tired of the promise. Don't get
[2:33:12] tired of the word of the Lord. Don't get
[2:33:14] tired being IN THE MESSAGE. DON'T GET
[2:33:16] TIRED BELIEVING. DON'T GET TIRED ON OF
[2:33:19] HOLDING ON FOR THE PROMISE OF GOD FOR
[2:33:22] YOUR FAMILY TO BE DELIVERED. DON'T GET
[2:33:24] TIRED OF THAT. DON'T GET TIRED OF
[2:33:26] WAITING FOR YOUR HEALING. LET IT NOT BE
[2:33:28] A WEARY SOMETHING. YOUR FAMILY HAS GOT
[2:33:31] TO COME. YOUR HEALING HAS GOT TO COME.
[2:33:33] YOUR BREAKTHROUGH HAS GOT TO COME. GOD
[2:33:36] IS GOING TO REWARD YOU.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; THEY THAT WAIT UPON THE LORD SHALL renew
[2:33:43] their strength.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; The musician going to get ready. I'm
[2:33:46] almost done.
[2:33:50] HALLELUJAH. HOLD THE LINE. THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; Hold the line. We're not giving up.
[2:33:55] We're not giving up. We're not giving UP
[2:33:58] THE BURDEN OF THE WORD OF THE LORD TO A
[2:34:01] prophetic class of people.
[2:34:09] Your words, verse 13 in chapter three,
[2:34:12] your words have been stout against me.
[2:34:14] God saying you have been harsh against
[2:34:16] me. Why are you talking about me like
[2:34:18] that?
[2:34:20] Yet you say what have we spoken so much
[2:34:24] against thee? So God is saying all
[2:34:26] you're saying things about me in a harsh
[2:34:28] way and people saying but what are you
[2:34:30] talking about?
[2:34:32] Ye have said it is vain to serve God.
[2:34:37] This is like young people saying but why
[2:34:40] I should go to church
[2:34:42] and God sees it as a harsh statement.
[2:34:46] Yet it is vain to serve. And what profit
[2:34:49] is it that we have kept his ordinance
[2:34:53] and that we have walked mournfully
[2:34:54] before the Lord of hosts?
[2:34:58] And now we call the proud happy.
[2:35:12] Y they that work within this asset of Y
[2:35:16] that temp God are even delivered.
[2:35:28] I want to dig into this a little bit
[2:35:30] before we close out.
[2:35:33] In the amplified it says your words have
[2:35:35] been harsh against me says the Lord. But
[2:35:37] you say what have we spoken against you?
[2:35:39] You have said it is useless to serve
[2:35:41] God. What profit is it if we keep his
[2:35:44] ordinances and walk around like mourers
[2:35:46] before the Lord of hosts? Being a
[2:35:49] Christian is boring.
[2:35:51] When you say foolish just like that, God
[2:35:53] is saying what kind of harsh thing you
[2:35:54] say.
[2:35:57] We walk like mourers sad and and
[2:36:02] we don't have any fun.
[2:36:06] So now we call the arrogant happy and
[2:36:09] blessed.
[2:36:11] evildoers are exalted and prosper
[2:36:15] and when they test God they escape
[2:36:17] unpunished. So God is saying that's the
[2:36:19] kind of stuff Paul is saying that I find
[2:36:22] offensive.
[2:36:27] Be very careful
[2:36:29] what you say. Be very careful how you
[2:36:32] see things because sometime only
[2:36:33] experiences come to reframe your view.
[2:36:36] Because David found himself in the same
[2:36:38] spot TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE AROUND THEM
[2:36:40] AND WHAT GOD HAS ASKED HIM, have you
[2:36:42] considered their end?
[2:36:45] YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW BLESSED THIS
[2:36:47] ONE IS AND HOW BLESSED I WAS. HAVE YOU
[2:36:48] considered their end
[2:36:54] looking after THE THINGS I WANT TO HAVE
[2:36:55] FUN, I WANT TO ENJOY LIFE.
[2:37:00] The most foolish things you hear young
[2:37:01] people say, well, they tell their
[2:37:02] parents, well, when you was young, you
[2:37:04] get to live and then decide what you
[2:37:05] want to do.
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; Nonsense.
[2:37:14] the grace of God to you that your
[2:37:16] parents could be in this thing THAT YOU
[2:37:19] NEVER HAVE TO GO and taste this thing.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; Taste the world
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; until people make the missing and cross
[2:37:30] a line from which they could never
[2:37:31] return BECAUSE YOU OPERATE AS YOU COULD
[2:37:33] WALK OUT FROM God and come back whenever
[2:37:35] you want.
[2:37:38] There are people who have walked out and
[2:37:39] never made it back.
[2:37:44] walked out from the grace of God and
[2:37:46] never made it back. THEY CAN'T EVEN COME
[2:37:48] BACK BECAUSE THEY ALREADY CROSSED THE
[2:37:49] LINE. THERE'S NO HOPE FOR THEM. THAT'S
[2:37:50] THE PROPHET'S WORD. I'm seeing a DAY
[2:37:52] WHEN THERE'LL BE YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE
[2:37:54] ALTAR CRYING OUT FOR GOD, BUT THEY HAVE
[2:37:57] DONE CROSSED THE LINE. NO MORE MERCY FOR
[2:37:59] THEM.
[2:38:01] THIS IS WHY THE BIBLE SAID, "SEEK YE THE
[2:38:03] LORD WHILE HE MAY BE FOUND. CALL UPON
[2:38:05] HIM WHILE HE IS NEAR." THERE'S A TIME
[2:38:07] LIMIT FOR MERCY.
[2:38:11] You want to go see the world and even
[2:38:13] when you step OUT THE DOOR SHUTS BEHIND
[2:38:14] YOU AND WHEN THEY TRY TO COME IN YOU
[2:38:16] CAN'T EVEN COME IN ANYMORE. DON'T PLAY
[2:38:18] GAMES WITH THE WORLD.
[2:38:22] Don't take church for granted. Don't
[2:38:24] take this gospel for granted. Don't take
[2:38:26] mercy for granted. DON'T TAKE SIN FOR
[2:38:28] GRANTED. DON'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED.
[2:38:31] THERE'S A TIME LIMIT.
[2:38:34] RUN FOR YOUR LIFE, YOUNG BROTHER. RUN
[2:38:36] FOR YOUR LIFE, YOUNG SISTER.
[2:38:39] THE JUDGMENT IS BEING HELD BACK. HE
[2:38:42] SAYS, "SEAL UP THE FOUR WINDS.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; PUT A MARK UPON THOSE THAT SIGH AND CRY
[2:38:47] FOR THE ABOMINATION IN MY CITY AND BEGIN
[2:38:49] AT my sanctuary at the ancient men at
[2:38:53] those who have sat IN THE MESSAGE FOR
[2:38:54] ALL THESE YEARS."
[2:38:59] God took offense for how they SPOKE
[2:39:02] ABOUT HIS LOVE AND HIS MERCY AND HIS
[2:39:03] grace and say it's a sad thing.
[2:39:06] Christians don't have no fun. ALL THE
[2:39:08] BOYS OUTSIDE LYING AND I IN HERE I have
[2:39:10] to be in a zoom prayer meeting. I have
[2:39:12] to have a Bible study. I could never get
[2:39:14] to do what I want. NOBODY THINK ANYTHING
[2:39:16] AND ALL THAT NONSENSE. AND YOU PARENTS
[2:39:18] THERE NOT EVEN BLASTING IT IN YOUR HOME
[2:39:20] AND SAY THE DEVIL IS AFTER YOU. THE
[2:39:22] DEVIL WANTS YOU BUT NOT IN THIS HOUSE.
[2:39:30] Not in this house.
[2:39:33] &gt;&gt; Some of you parents ARE TOO WEAK. NO
[2:39:35] BACKBONE.
[2:39:42] No backbone.
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; THERE'S DEATH HANGING OVER THE YOUNG
[2:39:47] PEOPLE. DEATH.
[2:39:50] The devil himself. THE DEVIL NOT AFTER
[2:39:53] THE WORLD. HE HAS THE WORLD.
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; HE HAS THEM IN THE WORLD. HE HAS NICKI
[2:39:57] MINAJ. HE HAS BEYONCE. HE HAS ALL OF
[2:39:59] THEM.
[2:40:04] Many have already given THEIR SOULS TO
[2:40:06] THE DEVIL. They could never be
[2:40:07] delivered, NEVER BEEN REDEEMED. BUT YOU,
[2:40:10] THERE'S A PROMISE OVER YOU OF
[2:40:11] REDEMPTION, OF THE HOLY GHOST, OF
[2:40:13] ADOPTION, OF THE POWER OF GOD COMING
[2:40:17] INTO YOU TO CHANGE YOU.
[2:40:23] BUT YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO SAY, "We
[2:40:26] mourning.
[2:40:28] We have no fun.
[2:40:35] Die young, die rich, die foolish.
[2:40:41] &gt;&gt; You have the opportunity to speak to
[2:40:44] someone incarcerated, someone on a bed,
[2:40:47] shut up. Somebody sick in a bed and hear
[2:40:49] what THEY SAY. THE MONEY DOESN'T MATTER.
[2:40:51] The girls doesn't matter. The popularity
[2:40:54] DOESN'T MATTER. THE FOLLOWERS DOESN'T
[2:40:56] MATTER. IT HAS NO MATTER BECAUSE THEY
[2:40:58] FACE DEBT. AND WHEN THEY FACE DEATH,
[2:41:00] THEY REALIZE THEIR MORTALITY.
[2:41:28] Where is my fear? The fear of the Lord
[2:41:33] is the beginning of wisdom. The fear of
[2:41:38] the Lord will make a husband love his
[2:41:40] wife. The fear of the Lord will make a
[2:41:43] wife reverence A HUSBAND. THE FEAR OF
[2:41:46] THE LORD will make children obey their
[2:41:48] parents. The fear of THE LORD WILL MAKE
[2:41:50] YOU LISTEN TO THE DEACON. THE FEAR OF
[2:41:53] THE LORD WILL MAKE YOU WORSHIP. THE FEAR
[2:41:55] OF THE LORD WILL MAKE YOU PRAY. THE FEAR
[2:41:58] OF THE LORD WILL MAKE YOU FORGIVE. THE
[2:42:00] FEAR OF THE LORD WILL BRING YOU INTO THE
[2:42:02] HOUSE OF GOD.
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHERE IS MY FEAR? WHERE IS MY
[2:42:07] HONOR?"
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:42:21] What profit is it that we have kept his
[2:42:24] ordinance?
[2:42:27] &gt;&gt; Bible said, "What profit a man to gain
[2:42:29] the whole world and lose his soul?" You
[2:42:32] want to talk about profit?
[2:42:37] People rushing into marriage, rushing
[2:42:40] into this, rushing into this without
[2:42:42] prayer, without advice. At the same
[2:42:45] TIME, PEOPLE RUSHING OUT OF IT.
[2:42:48] Because if GOD IS NOT THERE, IT'LL FAIL.
[2:42:50] IF GOD IS NOT THERE, IT'LL FALL APART.
[2:42:52] WITHOUT GOD, YOU'RE FINISHED.
[2:42:55] THE WHOLE BOOK OF MALACHI IS ABOUT WHAT
[2:42:57] GOD WANTS TO DO, WHAT GOD WANTS TO SAY,
[2:43:00] WHAT GOD WANTS TO ACHIEVE.
[2:43:12] Your gift, your talent, your expertise
[2:43:16] is a gift from God.
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; Gifts and callings are without
[2:43:23] repentance. God is not going to take the
[2:43:25] gift back, but he could shut down the
[2:43:26] gift. He has done it to many. Oh yes. Oh
[2:43:29] yes. He could shut down the gift. Judas
[2:43:32] had power and God shut him down because
[2:43:35] he was the son of predition. He walked
[2:43:37] with Jesus. He healed the sick with
[2:43:39] Jesus. He was in the upper room with
[2:43:40] Jesus. He was there in the church WITH
[2:43:42] JESUS. AND HE HAS BEEN STRICKEN. HIS
[2:43:45] NAME WRITTEN OFF.
[2:43:51] There is a limit to grace.
[2:43:57] There's a limit to mercy. I'm trying to
[2:44:00] close out, but maybe somebody in here is
[2:44:02] about to go free in a way you've never
[2:44:04] been free before because has NOTHING
[2:44:06] WITH YOUR FATHER, YOUR MOTHER, THE
[2:44:07] DEACON, THE TITOR. NOTHING TO DO WITH
[2:44:09] IT. BUT YOU, IF YOU'RE ON THE WAY TO
[2:44:10] HELL, I CHALLENGE YOU. FIX IT today
[2:44:16] before it's too late.
[2:44:25] Between now and early as night, there
[2:44:28] people will not see the new year.
[2:44:33] We speak positive. see you in a new
[2:44:35] year. This will not see it. They will
[2:44:38] not see it because God's will already
[2:44:40] cut them off.
[2:44:43] Whether good, whether bad, indifferent,
[2:44:45] and the things they should have said,
[2:44:46] the things they should have fixed, the
[2:44:47] things they should have made right, they
[2:44:49] have not made it right.
[2:44:52] And however that picture is taken, that
[2:44:55] picture now becomes unchangeable.
[2:44:57] Nothing else could change. Church, if
[2:45:00] you have things to fix, fix it today.
[2:45:05] Fix it today. Don't wait until tomorrow.
[2:45:08] Don't carry stuff into 2026. Your
[2:45:12] healing depends on it. Your deliverance
[2:45:14] depends on it. Your breakthrough depends
[2:45:17] on it. Mercy depends on it. Hallelujah.
[2:45:21] Glory.
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; Verse 16 of Malachi 3.
[2:45:31] I know many of you, you only know
[2:45:33] Malachi, Malachi 4:5 and 6. And we
[2:45:36] haven't touched all of it. We skipped
[2:45:37] through some parts. But is it why you
[2:45:39] have to study scripture? Because when
[2:45:41] you do, then when the winds blow, you're
[2:45:42] rooted and grounded in the love of God.
[2:45:44] Can the church say amen?
[2:45:46] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:45:49] Verse 16. Then they that fear the Lord.
[2:45:52] Do we have any that fear the Lord in the
[2:45:54] house?
[2:45:58] Not a scared he fear but the fear of the
[2:46:00] Lord because he is holy.
[2:46:02] &gt;&gt; The fear of the Lord because we are
[2:46:03] unworthy. The fear of the LORD BECAUSE
[2:46:05] WE ARE SINNERS. THE FEAR OF THE LORD
[2:46:07] BECAUSE HE IS GOD AND HE CAN STRIKE YOU
[2:46:09] DOWN AT ANY POINT IN TIME. BUT IF IT'S
[2:46:11] NOT FOR HIS LOVE AND HIS MERCY AND HIS
[2:46:12] GRACE AND HIS PREDESTINATION, WE ARE
[2:46:14] FINISHED.
[2:46:18] &gt;&gt; We fear the Lord.
[2:46:22] Then they that fear the Lord spake often
[2:46:25] one to another.
[2:46:29] And the Lord hearkened and heard it, and
[2:46:32] a book of remembrance was written before
[2:46:34] him for them that fear the Lord. And
[2:46:37] that thought upon his name, just
[2:46:40] thinking on his name, there's a blessing
[2:46:43] in there. Just to think about him, just
[2:46:46] to TALK ABOUT HIM, JUST TO FELLOWSHIP
[2:46:48] ABOUT HIM, JUST TO BE IN HIS PRESENCE,
[2:46:50] JUST TO BE IN ATMOSPHERE JUST TO GREET
[2:46:53] YOUR BROTHER AND SAY, "THE LORD IS GOOD.
[2:46:54] THE LORD IS MERCIFUL. HEALING IS COMING.
[2:46:56] DELIVERANCE IS COMING. A REVIVAL.
[2:46:59] THERE'S SOMETHING BUBBLING IN YOUR SOUL.
[2:47:01] ALL OF THIS IS BEING MEASURED.
[2:47:05] YOUR LIFE CANNOT JUST BE politics and
[2:47:07] the news and Venezuela and Trump and
[2:47:10] this.
[2:47:14] But when your conversation become the
[2:47:16] king coming suddenly to his temple WHEN
[2:47:19] YOUR LIFE BECOMES I'm looking to come to
[2:47:21] my home not just a church I would say
[2:47:23] come to my HOUSE OH GOD FIND MY HOUSE
[2:47:25] LORD COME TO MY HOUSE MEET ME WHEN I'M
[2:47:27] DRIVING IN THE CAR MEET ME WHEN I'M
[2:47:28] WALKING IN THE BANK MEET ME WHEN I'm
[2:47:35] &gt;&gt; if you ever needed a Lord is now I'm
[2:47:37] trying to close out
[2:47:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[2:47:43] verse seven and they shall shall be
[2:47:44] mine, say the Lord of hosts, in that day
[2:47:48] when I make up my jewels, AND I WILL
[2:47:50] SPARE THEM as a man spareth HIS OWN SON
[2:47:53] THAT SERVETH HIM.
[2:47:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; Listen to that verse in the amplified.
[2:48:04] They shall be mine, says the Lord of
[2:48:07] hosts. Who shall be mine? those that
[2:48:09] fear the Lord, those that sing upon his
[2:48:11] name, those that talk about him, those
[2:48:13] that make HIM A PRIORITY, THOSE THAT
[2:48:15] LOVE THE WORD, THOSE THAT LOVE THE
[2:48:17] BRETHREN, THOSE THAT LOVE THE
[2:48:18] FELLOWSHIP, THOSE THAT LOVE THE HOUSE OF
[2:48:20] GOD, THOSE THAT LOVE THE THINGS OF GOD,
[2:48:22] THOSE THAT LOVE THE WORSHIP OF GOD, THEY
[2:48:24] SHALL BE MINE, SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS.
[2:48:28] ON THAT DAY. LISTEN, when I publicly
[2:48:31] recognize them and openly declare them
[2:48:35] to be MY OWN POSSESSION, THAT IS MY VERY
[2:48:39] SPECIAL TREASURE.
[2:48:49] &gt;&gt; Then shall you return in verse 18 and
[2:48:52] discern between the righteous and the
[2:48:55] wicked. Don't you know the saints will
[2:48:56] judge the earth? Then shall you return
[2:49:00] and discern between the righteous and
[2:49:01] the wicked, between him that serveth God
[2:49:04] and him that serveth not. Because you
[2:49:07] will not be judged. You're already
[2:49:08] judged. HALLELUJAH.
[2:49:11] AND THE last chapter of Malachi, we'll
[2:49:13] close with this. For behold, the day
[2:49:16] cometh.
[2:49:17] So Malachi without knowing his tribe,
[2:49:20] his family, his background, his trade,
[2:49:22] where he lived, the house he had,
[2:49:24] whether he was married or not, if he had
[2:49:25] children or not, we know nothing about
[2:49:27] him. But yet within his ministry, he
[2:49:29] speaks about Christ. John the Baptist,
[2:49:32] Brother Brandham, he speaks about
[2:49:33] judgment. He speaks about redemption. He
[2:49:35] speaks about grace. He speaks about
[2:49:37] love. He speaks about mercy. HE SPEAKS
[2:49:39] ABOUT PROMISE, THE FEAR OF THE LORD. HE
[2:49:41] SPEAKS ABOUT WISDOM. He speaks to the
[2:49:43] YOUNG PEOPLE. HE SPEAKS TO THE CALEBS.
[2:49:47] TALK ABOUT THE GREATEST WAY TO END THE
[2:49:49] OLD TESTAMENT. Isn't God good?
[2:49:56] &gt;&gt; For behold, the day cometh that shall
[2:49:59] burn as an oven, and all the proud, yay,
[2:50:02] and all that do wickedly shall be
[2:50:05] stubble. They'll be burnt.
[2:50:08] Who? All the proud. And all that do
[2:50:11] wickedly shall be stubble. and the day
[2:50:15] that come it shall burn them up, say the
[2:50:17] Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them
[2:50:20] neither root nor branch. BUT UNTO YOU
[2:50:23] THAT FEAR MY NAME SHALL THE SON OF
[2:50:26] RIGHTEOUSNESS ARISE WITH HEALING IN his
[2:50:28] wings, and he shall go forth and grow up
[2:50:31] as calves of the stall, AND HE SHALL
[2:50:33] TREAD DOWN THE WICKED, FOR THEY SHALL be
[2:50:35] ashes under the shoulder of your feet in
[2:50:38] the day that I shall do this, sayeth the
[2:50:40] Lord OF HOSTS. REMEMBER YE the law of
[2:50:43] Moses my servant which I commanded UNTO
[2:50:45] HIM IN HOREB FOR ALL ISRAEL WITH THE
[2:50:48] STATUTES AND JUDGMENTS. BEHOLD, I WILL
[2:50:50] SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET BEFORE the
[2:50:53] coming of the great AND DREADFUL DAY OF
[2:50:54] THE LORD. AND HE SHALL TURN THE HEART OF
[2:50:56] THE FATHERS TO THE CHILDREN AND THE
[2:50:59] HEART OF THE CHILDREN TO THEIR FATHERS,
[2:51:01] LEST I COME AND SMITE THE EARTH WITH A
[2:51:03] CURSE. AND MALACHI ENDS OFF PAN POINTING
[2:51:06] TO THE GREAT ELIJAH PROPHET WILLIAM
[2:51:08] MARIAM PRANAM WHO WILL FINISH THE RACE
[2:51:11] WHO WILL CROSS THE FINISH LINE. WHO WILL
[2:51:13] SHOW THE BRIDE HOW TO GO? SHOW THE BRIDE
[2:51:15] HOW TO PREPARE. SEVEN THUNDERS WILL
[2:51:18] GUIDE THE WAY. SEVEN THUNDERS GIVES US
[2:51:20] RAPTURE IN FAITH. SEVEN THUNDERS WILL
[2:51:23] TAKE US HOME. MAY THE LORD RICHLY BLESS
[2:51:26] YOU. The burden of the word of the Lord
[2:51:29] to a prophetic class of people. May the
[2:51:33] Lord richly bless you.
[2:51:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. You appreciate
[2:51:49] the message this evening.
[2:51:51] Wonderful.
[2:51:53] God bless you, brother Isaac.

[2:52:24] the burdens you have car
[2:52:28] for in the sanctuary
[2:52:33] God.

[2:53:38] So he bless us and bless the broken.
[2:53:45] will come later.
[2:53:49] The birds you have to carry
[2:53:55] [Music]
[2:53:57] God
[2:53:59] is here.
[2:54:02] Just praise him this evening.
[2:54:05] Hallelujah.
[2:54:07] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you for your
[2:54:09] love, Lord. Thank you for your grace.

[2:54:37] for prayer. Heavenly Father, we bring
[2:54:40] the tithes and offering before you. May
[2:54:42] you bless it. May this use may use for
[2:54:45] your honor and for your glory in the
[2:54:47] precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

[2:55:37] When Jacob met the Lord, when Jacob met
[2:55:41] the Lord
[2:55:42] upon that lonely night, he wrestled
[2:55:46] there alone
[2:55:48] until the morning.

[2:56:38] before them and dwell in happy man. I

[2:56:56] keeps and satisfies my soul. I want

[2:57:06] pillows of heaven. That's the last
[2:57:09] verse.

[2:57:21] is drawing in. He's waiting to be
