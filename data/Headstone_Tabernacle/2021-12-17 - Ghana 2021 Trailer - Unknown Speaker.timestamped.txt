[0:20] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[0:21] likened unto ten virgins which took
[0:23] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[0:25] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[0:28] and five were foolish they that were
[0:30] foolish took their lamps and took no oil
[0:32] with them but the wise took oil in their
[0:34] vessels with their lamps
[0:36] while the bridegroom tarried they all
[0:39] slumbered and slept
[0:41] and at midnight there was a cry made
[0:43] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[0:45] to meet him
[0:47] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[0:49] their lamps and the foolish said unto
[0:51] the wise give us of your oil for our
[0:53] lamps are gone out but the wise answered
[0:56] saying not so lest there be not enough
[0:59] for us and you but go ye rather to them
