[30:00] spiritual retreat praise God
[30:04] nothing is by chance now oh yes what if
[30:08] dos ángeles go down this week it changes
[30:13] everything
[30:14] yeah you'd realize how real this message
[30:18] is what this profit in the spirit realm
[30:22] went up and saw and where we supposed to
[30:25] be for such a time as this
[30:27] what kind of condition we supposed to be
[30:30] him as the time begins to unfold and we
[30:33] see the Bible talk about the beginning
[30:36] of Sorrows important of we see this but
[30:41] we want to tank she say yochabel for
[30:43] that song I'll rise again talk about
[30:47] agree
[30:49] I'm gonna come and also from two extras
[30:51] looking away to Jesus I'm looking but if
[30:53] you've got blessing my brothers we
[30:55] certainly appreciate that email this
[31:00] morning we have precious but a solemn
[31:02] and a Gina from Ghana I'm gonna stick
[31:05] you this morning and you know many times
[31:11] people think being a leader you have to
[31:14] have a title a post a position but it's
[31:17] not really so I want to show you that
[31:19] you are called to lead you here this
[31:22] morning you you the people leaden is the
[31:25] behavior its attitude oh praise the name
[31:29] of the Lord
[31:30] the Bur mom says a minister now a
[31:33] minister cannot being a revival there is
[31:36] no preacher
[31:37] can being a revival he doesn't pack it
[31:40] with him the only thing he can do is to
[31:42] be loyal to God and with his word and
[31:45] the revival has to come by the people in
[31:49] your home in your life revival isn't
[31:54] adding new members to the church is
[31:56] reviving what we have already got so
[31:59] when the church get in a rut we need a
[32:01] revival it doesn't have new but it
[32:04] changes and under what is already dear
[32:08] or glory to God and then he said isn't
[32:11] it strange that God would want the
[32:13] people to have patented it when Jesus
[32:16] looked out into the harvest he said the
[32:18] harvest is ripe the laborers are few you
[32:22] pray the lord of the harvest that was
[32:25] him
[32:25] you pray to me that I will send laborers
[32:28] into my harvest it is some part you have
[32:31] to do God is waiting for his church to
[32:35] call on him so you say you written on
[32:38] God and go reason the new his church to
[32:40] call on him he always did it God is
[32:43] waiting today for the people to call his
[32:47] servant into action so you hold a key
[32:51] every prayer every praise every right
[32:55] life and attitude there is a part in
[32:58] this glorious program
[33:01] that get caught servants into action
[33:03] listen to this he said God is waiting
[33:07] for the people to call his civil
[33:09] interaction and the servant can't get
[33:12] into action till the people please
[33:14] o blessed be the name of the Lord
[33:17] we believe that then he said what we see
[33:21] happen should put every soul in action
[33:23] it should make a church that will make a
[33:26] revival Iain Phoenix that people will be
[33:28] flying from Europe to see what taken
[33:30] place they will say there's a place in
[33:32] Arizona called Maricopa Valley a city
[33:35] called Phoenix
[33:36] there is something broke out there until
[33:38] the seven thunders of Revelation ten
[33:40] that are not even written in the Bible
[33:43] is being manifested so there's a
[33:45] prophecy hanging over you for a
[33:47] manifestation of God or glory to God
[33:51] that there be a genuine witness that he
[33:54] is raised from the dead
[33:55] Oh hallelujah oh we appreciate that
[33:58] service last night but the daily or
[34:01] glory not brought it up or some day
[34:03] yesterday
[34:03] [Applause]

[34:35] have got to make a move
[34:38] Church every prayer every praise your
[34:43] life to create an atmosphere where God
[34:48] servants can come into Oh hallelujah if
[34:52] the minister cut the been revival we
[34:54] suppose some several all these years all
[34:55] along but the people the people have the
[34:59] minute revival
[35:00] there's something special about you God
[35:02] put a key that you wanna turn you could
[35:06] turn that man of God here to this
[35:08] morning your feet you see Albert Abraham
[35:10] on a platform he's gonna pray for the
[35:12] sick around Masada turn like this

[43:15] morning we are gonna enjoy ourselves
[43:17] so as we stand to our feet this morning
[43:19] shall we go straight to the word Matthew
[43:24] chapter 13 read verse 30 39 42 41
[43:37] you know Jesus talking about the parable
[43:39] of the sower like into the kingdom of
[43:42] God rest a teaser let both grow together
[43:45] until the harvest and in the time of
[43:49] harvest I will say to the Reapers gather
[43:51] ye together first the tares and bind
[43:54] them in bundles and bend them but gather
[43:58] the wheat into my barn
[44:00] verse 39 the enemy that sowed them is
[44:07] the devil the one that stood the test
[44:10] now is the devil the harvest is the end
[44:12] of the world and the Reapers are the
[44:15] Angels amen verse 40 and I was there for
[44:19] the tests are carried and been in the
[44:21] fire so shall it be in the end of this
[44:24] well the Son of man shall send forth his
[44:27] angels and they shall gather out of his
[44:29] kingdom all things that offend and them
[44:33] that which do iniquity Ecclesiastes
[44:37] chapter 3 verse 1 and to that to
[44:41] everything there is a season and a time
[44:44] to every purpose under the heaven a time
[44:48] to be born and a time to die a time to
[44:51] plant and a time to pluck up that which
[44:53] is planted made a lord are a blessing to
[44:56] the ring of his word you may please be
[44:59] seated a man I trust us you see give him
[45:04] praise here to worship Him he's the only
[45:08] one that deserves our praise and worship
[45:10] so this morning for a title the
[45:12] manifestation is the interpretation
[45:15] hallelujah what is in the ground let it
[45:19] come to the manifestation then it will
[45:21] give itself the interpretation my
[45:24] subject is at the appointed time and
[45:27] obviously the inspiration the harvest
[45:30] time hallelujah
[45:32] so the Prophet said this morning and I
[45:34] want to read from blasphemous names
[45:36] he said now coming from the Holy Spirit
[45:38] what is come then he will give you sue
[45:42] unnatural fate amen spiritual faith that
[45:48] here at the bottom then that's spiritual
[45:51] faith recognizes only the word no matter
[45:55] what anybody sees it turns to no good
[45:59] hallelujah the manifestation will only
[46:03] recognize the word which would be the
[46:06] interpretation it's not going to be
[46:09] theory is what the way it said but at
[46:12] where has an appointed time to be
[46:14] manifested it has an appointed time to
[46:17] be vindicated and you cannot let that
[46:20] weight come at the time that it is not
[46:22] appointed is that Abraham I will visit
[46:25] you according to the time of life and
[46:27] Sarah your wife will have a son now
[46:30] there had to be a time of life no matter
[46:33] how you know Abraham was in a hurry to
[46:35] have that son they had to come that
[46:38] appointed time that appointed season for
[46:42] Sarah to get in that condition to
[46:44] receive that child hallelujah
[46:47] Abraham was a man of faith but the
[46:49] appointed time had to come and it was
[46:52] according to God's own time Abraham
[46:55] could him push it for it to go here to
[46:57] contain 25 years on the promise it shall
[47:01] be
[47:02] it shall be I'm gonna have a son why God
[47:05] said so hallelujah hallelujah
[47:08] they opposition her to come the critics
[47:11] had to come but God hath spoken it and
[47:14] Abraham received a spiritual faith he
[47:17] wasn't looking at the circumstance of
[47:19] Sarah and this bride receives a promise
[47:22] hallelujah that is coming for a bride
[47:25] that bride is going to come for nothing
[47:28] will stop her hallelujah she is called
[47:31] she is predestinated she's ordained to
[47:34] come forth hallelujah
[47:37] but that bride cannot comfort until the
[47:40] appointed time but thank God this is the
[47:43] appointed time because we have gone
[47:45] through the denominational period
[47:47] hallelujah you may be seated
[47:49] but Abram said Amen that the way three
[47:53] group
[47:53] that way plantain and when you plant you
[47:57] are looking for the harvest you're not
[47:59] interested in the crop how beautiful the
[48:01] green crop is your focus is at the end
[48:05] what you are going to read from that
[48:07] crop hallelujah
[48:09] so three groups were planted when
[48:12] Abraham said Oral Roberts King he may I
[48:17] with me this morning on a road SK kilos
[48:22] wonky the Prophet came and they all
[48:26] planted and the Prophet that you wonder
[48:29] why you don't hear about Bill agree how
[48:30] many more you wonder why don't hear
[48:32] about Oral Roberts anymore is that an
[48:34] evil mind is the deadness of them all
[48:37] but it was gone into the ground it not
[48:40] being planted for a manifestation for a
[48:43] manifestation today you see the
[48:46] denominations are growing Indian numbers
[48:48] and numbers and numbers why it is a
[48:51] harvest time because a denominational
[48:54] seed was sold and now they are opinion
[48:57] numbers they were interested in the
[48:59] numbers they have the numbers but
[49:00] brother is coming for the price and that
[49:03] probably a minority but up prior her
[49:06] power that Brad wah
[49:08] power power from the Holy Ghost not
[49:11] power from her groups not power from
[49:13] denomination but power of the
[49:15] resurrected Christ but in the life of
[49:18] man again oh these signs shall follow
[49:20] them that believe the science follow the
[49:23] believer
[49:24] you may be seated so the Prophet said
[49:27] they were planted denominational sees
[49:30] were planted truble agree humming or
[49:33] aerobics so we see people you know
[49:37] coming into the machine like they used
[49:39] to you know the seeds have been planted
[49:41] and the profits that that bride will be
[49:44] in a minority because she'll be the Wed
[49:46] only
[49:48] hallelujah because she's gonna take back
[49:51] one her husband is and her husband is
[49:53] the word she knows no man made three
[49:56] hallelujah
[49:58] o blessed be the name of a living God
[50:00] and the Bible said and his bride has
[50:03] made herself what
[50:04] his wife Christ's wife not a man's wife
[50:08] Christ's wife and I'm looking at the
[50:10] wife of Christ today Oh glory be to the
[50:13] Living God some from Ghana some from
[50:16] Nigeria some from Trinidad what are we
[50:19] doing we're making ourselves ready for
[50:21] that bridegroom Oh glory be to the
[50:24] Living God so the prophet left the word
[50:26] in there
[50:27] hallelujah and he said he left a promise
[50:30] that the seven thunders will Cara the
[50:35] bride member dovi read this morning
[50:37] about how people were planning to see it
[50:40] manifested but there has to be a
[50:42] Katherine first hallelujah
[50:44] that is our seat after the prophets
[50:48] finish with the Pentecostals he still
[50:50] had to be three kinds of believers amen
[50:54] three kinds of believers that was coming
[50:57] three kinds of believers are left
[51:00] Pentecost
[51:01] bolita prophet but three kinds of
[51:03] believers but in death as believer best
[51:07] make believer that's unbeliever
[51:09] but the promise is to the believer that
[51:11] promise of the resurrection of Jesus
[51:14] Christ is to the believer Alleluia and
[51:18] the profit of the promise there wait
[51:20] till them seven thunders so there's a
[51:23] waiting for an appointed time for these
[51:26] seven thunders to alter their voices to
[51:29] that group this is a special group the
[51:32] pride group the pride group the elected
[51:35] group the chosen group the attain group
[51:38] the predestinated group that group that
[51:41] knows no man's greed wait till them
[51:44] seven thunders and what is the toughness
[51:46] Christ Himself the cup stole the
[51:49] headstone and he's coming for the
[51:51] harvest the harvest of the bride that
[51:54] I've waited long enough or to get a hot
[51:58] July Sun hot July Sun you might have
[52:01] wanted it in January but it's not time
[52:03] hallelujah you murabba wonder if in
[52:06] April but it was in time Oh glory to God
[52:09] that July Sun had to count and when he
[52:12] came it was time for the harvest is that
[52:14] come on
[52:16] the reapers let them put the sickle in
[52:18] before the enemy can do more damage and
[52:21] we are promised that is dynamics to our
[52:24] mechanics so all that we receive was
[52:27] mechanics hallelujah
[52:29] the Busan teams were mechanics but
[52:32] brother in the mechanical church members
[52:34] they were unbelievers they were big
[52:37] believers brother but the heavens had to
[52:39] come to separate a shock to separate a
[52:42] big believer to separate the unbeliever
[52:45] and to leave that bride alone because
[52:48] the Prophet said that bride has the
[52:50] material on the earth or to overcome
[52:53] that bride has the material on the earth
[52:56] to make you to perfection that bride has
[52:59] the material right now Oh glory be to
[53:02] the Living God to bring for the
[53:04] manifestation of the Holy Spirit that is
[53:07] why we are shouting we are not shouting
[53:10] because we are funny we are shouting
[53:12] because we know we have a revelation
[53:14] that our word is unfolded that our word
[53:17] is unveiled that God is unveiled in the
[53:21] word Oh give him prison small
[53:29] [Music]
[53:32] hallelujah hallelujah but a problem
[53:37] restore the Son of man reveal the son of
[53:42] man hallelujah and the Pharisees came
[53:46] tempting Jesus
[53:47] he's a wench on this the kingdom of God
[53:49] come Jesus told them it cometh not with
[53:53] observation there's no one day churches
[53:56] 1000 people then the kingdom is coming
[54:00] hallelujah I said they would tell you
[54:01] though here this is the man of the hour
[54:03] I said no don't listen to that
[54:06] hallelujah he's in a secret place
[54:11] thank you for unprotected the password
[54:15] [Applause]
[54:17] hallelujah I'm had a man I like a man
[54:23] that and protects himself you have
[54:25] nothing to hide
[54:26] I want you lock key down man there's
[54:28] some secret thing going on there
[54:31] hallelujah he said in the secret place I
[54:34] don't good here because the kingdom of
[54:37] God is within you that son of mine has
[54:41] been revealed is within you now and
[54:45] Brahm revealed the son of man as
[54:47] promises only to the bride the Prophet
[54:52] had to come be seated and tie up the
[54:55] loose ends of the entire Bible because
[55:00] the word will judge the world so
[55:04] judgment warning has to come before
[55:06] judgment so the pentecostal need to know
[55:09] the restore the full restored way to
[55:12] reject it then they can be jacked by
[55:14] that way the unbeliever has to see and
[55:17] know that the wear has been fully
[55:18] restored to reject it and then be jacked
[55:21] by that way so God sent the Prophet to
[55:24] tie up every loose end
[55:26] so Methodist has no excuse Catholic has
[55:29] no excuse the Pope has these books he
[55:32] has no excuse hallelujah but that was in
[55:35] their promise the promise was for the
[55:38] bride
[55:39] so after tying up the loose ends he then
[55:42] released the Son of Man as promises
[55:46] hallelujah and Peter said by these
[55:49] promises you become partakers of the
[55:52] divine nature of God divine nature
[55:56] divine me that you have nothing to do
[55:58] with it Mary had nothing to do with it
[56:01] be done to me according to your word I
[56:04] have nothing to do with it no man has
[56:07] nothing to do with the divine nature of
[56:09] God the problem revealing us promises
[56:15] and on the horizon the world God is
[56:19] obligated come on now pick back to do
[56:21] this more God is obligated at the
[56:26] appointed time to watch you suffer -
[56:32] what you get confused though he is
[56:34] obligated to meet you on the basis of
[56:38] them promises hallelujah hallelujah on
[56:43] the basis of the promises and the profit
[56:47] outside of those promises you have catch
[56:50] yourself off Oh glory be to the Living
[56:53] God that is why when I really say the
[56:55] seven thunders shall gather the bride
[56:57] I'm looking wherever the brightest got
[56:59] it I know the seven thunders is being
[57:02] manifested that is the manifestation of
[57:05] the prophets prophesy because he spoke
[57:08] it but the thunders who got her the
[57:10] bride the thunders will show her how to
[57:13] prepare how to escape the judgment hard
[57:17] to escape false Christ how to escape
[57:19] false anointed who the tenders will show
[57:22] that bright how to prepare
[57:25] oh and we are grading the ruptor we
[57:29] shall be chained at pandas who show
[57:31] their pride and give that bride the

[57:37] world but review to the bride ooh
[57:40] hallelujah hallelujah it doesn't stop
[57:45] there
[57:45] he said the seven thunders would be the
[57:47] price we Viva so when the shock pulls
[57:55] away in the message we can have a
[57:59] revival because the seven thunders would
[58:01] have gathered you together showing you
[58:04] how to prepare giving you faith to know
[58:07] that you are gonna be chained nobody can

[1:12:20] its kind that's right every seat will
[1:12:23] have to bring remember the F is full of
[1:12:27] seeds the rain makes it bring forth
[1:12:29] after each time hallelujah back home
[1:12:36] when the grains and the harvest and you
[1:12:38] know everything is dry and they set fire
[1:12:41] weight to rain comes next - even though

[1:12:52] rain drops you see them shooting up
[1:12:55] hallelujah so the ring bell Brown said
[1:13:00] the former rain has come is that a
[1:13:04] Pentecost Pentecost felt our they had

[1:14:43] can take place
[1:14:44] Oh glory to God we'll need the dynamics
[1:14:48] will meet the dynamics we have the
[1:14:50] mechanics we have the mechanics we can
[1:14:52] explain the mechanics of it but where is
[1:14:56] the power

[1:17:27] rest of them he said and the weight has
[1:17:29] been planted the word Rachael word and
[1:17:36] God will not bring that wedding the womb
[1:17:38] Bobby Hall it's gonna come to revision

[1:18:01] a home he's gonna bring it in the womb
[1:18:04] of a veggie that knows no other thing
[1:18:09] than the word because this word was
[1:18:12] given to the children for their defense

[1:18:20] anymore there's no pillow fire over you
[1:18:23] anymore the Angels don't come around you

[1:18:42] glory be to the name of a living God now
[1:18:46] listen here Balaam said in the seed of
[1:18:48] discrepancy
[1:18:49] he said now notice as ever as soon as
[1:18:52] Jesus went away went into heaven the
[1:18:56] Holy Spirit was sent back that was the
[1:18:59] seed the life giver onto the world so
[1:19:06] the Holy Ghost comes on the sea to give
[1:19:08] it life
[1:19:11] hallelujah without the holy goose
[1:19:14] mechanics the wrongs that we understand
[1:19:17] these things we read we understand we
[1:19:20] can explain them intellectually but it
[1:19:24] takes the Holy Spirit it takes the
[1:19:26] dynamics it takes the life giver onto
[1:19:29] the world as we spoke last night
[1:19:31] amen it is the one that quickens the
[1:19:34] word creaking means to bring to life the
[1:19:37] genuine Holy Spirit only brings to light
[1:19:40] the word that it is it will bring a
[1:19:43] creature to life
[1:19:44] it can't amen because it is nothing of
[1:19:47] the cream it is the life of the Word of
[1:19:50] God for it is strong and it quickens
[1:19:52] that body Oh glory to God the Holy
[1:19:56] Spirit only brings quickening power to
[1:19:59] the word and that word is well where is
[1:20:02] that where on books and tapes though the
[1:20:04] word is in the bride that where is in
[1:20:07] the bride and the prophet and a bride
[1:20:09] know what to do with that word either
[1:20:14] instant they say no man can make them do
[1:20:18] otherwise if it is not the word goodbye
[1:20:22] if it is not the word bye-bye hallelujah
[1:20:26] if it is not the word I don't want to
[1:20:28] see it
[1:20:29] see no evil hear no evil think no evil
[1:20:33] Oh bye you have to read in between the
[1:20:36] line
[1:20:36] Oh glory it wasn't the church was not
[1:20:39] built on reading in between the line
[1:20:40] upon this rock I will build my church on
[1:20:45] Revelation the revelation of her check
[1:20:48] no the revelation of Jesus Christ the
[1:20:50] same yesterday the same today the same
[1:20:54] forever he never fails he never changes
[1:20:57] and that quick name power only comes
[1:20:59] upon that word so the Prophet therefore
[1:21:02] they can be nothing shut do we not
[1:21:06] shadowy we're not looking with it with
[1:21:08] some less it is as it is it interprets
[1:21:12] itself a virgin shall conceive now a
[1:21:16] virgin conceived
[1:21:18] and brought for Christ but one said that
[1:21:20] don't need no interpretation his pocket
[1:21:23] Merrick brought forth that was the
[1:21:26] manifestation of the interpretation of
[1:21:29] Isaiah's prophecy params are nothing
[1:21:32] shadowy just a genuine unadulterated
[1:21:35] Word of God that is sons and daughters
[1:21:38] of God who is not born by the will of
[1:21:40] man or by a shaking of hand or some form
[1:21:44] of baptism but born of the Spirit of God
[1:21:46] by the Holy Spirit and the word
[1:21:50] manifested itself through them that is
[1:21:53] the genuine seed of God that is what
[1:21:56] goes into the harvest that the Holy
[1:21:58] Ghost can work through we're true we're
[1:22:02] true manifests in the word of the Living
[1:22:04] God that is the seed of God Oh
[1:22:08] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:22:15] now listen number drum continues in the
[1:22:17] seed of discrepancy amen
[1:22:20] he said but they finally came forth
[1:22:23] until proof is that by the finally came
[1:22:25] forth until both of two seeds the seed
[1:22:28] of discrepancy and the seed of God they
[1:22:31] put forth their genuine heads amen
[1:22:34] that wound up in Judas Iscariot and in
[1:22:37] Jesus Christ for he was the son of God
[1:22:40] Christ now he was the beginning of the
[1:22:42] creation of God he was nothing less than
[1:22:44] God and Judas is Carlos was born the son
[1:22:48] of perdition came from Hell returned
[1:22:51] back to hell
[1:22:54] the truth harvest time our scripture let
[1:23:00] both grow together at the harvest time
[1:23:03] at the showdown the manifestation will
[1:23:07] be the interpretation at that harvest
[1:23:10] time ah man but Abraham said amen
[1:23:14] Judas in his discrepancy was the seed of
[1:23:18] the devil come to the well for deceit
[1:23:24] am i preaching to somebody is born
[1:23:27] hallelujah
[1:23:28] Judas had a purpose Judas had a
[1:23:32] commission Jesus had a commission to you
[1:23:36] both seats so in the heart of men
[1:23:42] hallelujah also don't worry about what
[1:23:46] is going on in the message the elect
[1:23:50] will come to the hedge - nothing will
[1:23:57] stop the elect no matter how downtrodden
[1:24:01] how rejected how cut away they will come
[1:24:05] to the h2 called the up predestinated -
[1:24:10] it
[1:24:13] hallelujah
[1:24:15] Judas in his discrepancy was the seed of
[1:24:17] the table come to the world for this
[1:24:19] seat just like he was at the beginning
[1:24:21] Cain his former father
[1:24:22] Judas only play Church Judas knew how to
[1:24:29] clap and sing and dance and do all those
[1:24:31] which was though experienced with the
[1:24:34] Holy Ghost
[1:24:37] rather he wasn't really sincere he
[1:24:40] didn't actually have faith he have Evie
[1:24:45] had Hyrum never betrayed Jesus but see
[1:24:47] he sowed the seed of discrepancy he
[1:24:50] thought he could make friends with the
[1:24:52] world
[1:24:58] when there's no believer I can wear some
[1:25:01] pants
[1:25:10] he thought he could make friends with
[1:25:12] the world maman and have fellowship with
[1:25:14] Jesus but it was too late for him to do
[1:25:17] anything about it when the death hour
[1:25:20] came when he did this evil thing he
[1:25:23] crossed a separation line between going
[1:25:26] forward and retaining back all glory
[1:25:35] this is real
[1:25:41] there was a rupture your fate is on the
[1:25:43] tapes all that you need to make heaven
[1:25:47] is here order you need to gather Holy
[1:25:50] Ghost is here when the dead hour came
[1:25:58] when he did this evil thing he crossed
[1:26:01] the separation line between going
[1:26:03] forward and returning back he had to go
[1:26:06] on in the way that he went as a deceiver
[1:26:09] he sowed the seed of discrepancy he
[1:26:12] tried to find favor with those great big
[1:26:14] organizations of the day with the
[1:26:16] Pharisees and Sadducees and thought he
[1:26:18] would make himself some piece of money
[1:26:20] he will be popular among the people if
[1:26:23] he doesn't if he doesn't consume any
[1:26:26] people to get in that discrepancy trying
[1:26:28] to find a fever with man let's find
[1:26:31] favor with God
[1:26:35] this morning
[1:26:37] let me find favor with God
[1:26:41] not with man but that was what Judas
[1:26:44] done when this discrepancy headed up in
[1:26:47] him and we know that Jesus was the word
[1:26:51] st. John once said in the beginning was
[1:26:54] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:26:55] the Word was God and the Word was made
[1:26:57] flesh and dwelt among us then the weight
[1:27:00] is a seed then the seed become flesh and
[1:27:04] dwelt among us if G if Judas was the
[1:27:07] seed of the enemy and discrepancy it
