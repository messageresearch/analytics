[1:10:42] so I greet you this morning in the
[1:10:44] precious name of Jesus Christ is
[1:10:46] certainly a great privilege to be in the
[1:10:49] house of the Lord this morning and I'd
[1:10:51] like to get straight to the word reading
[1:10:54] three portions of scripture reading from
[1:10:57] the Book of Ezekiel reading second
[1:10:59] Corinthians and reading from the book of
[1:11:01] Revelation reading Ezekiel 36 second
[1:11:07] Corinthians five and revelation three
[1:11:14] ezekiel 36 and from verse 22 ezekiel 36
[1:11:25] and from verse 22 therefore say unto the
[1:11:30] house of israel thus saith the lord god
[1:11:33] i do not this for your sakes a house of
[1:11:41] israel but for mine holy namesake which
[1:11:46] he have profaned among the heathen with
[1:11:48] a you went and i will sanctify my great
[1:11:52] name which was profaned among the
[1:11:55] heathen which ye have profaned in the
[1:11:58] midst of them and the heathen shall know
[1:12:01] that I am the Lord sayeth the Lord God
[1:12:03] when I shall be sanctified in you before
[1:12:06] their eyes for I will take you from
[1:12:10] among the heathen and gather you out of
[1:12:13] all countries and will bring you into
[1:12:16] your own land then will I sprinkle clean
[1:12:19] water upon you and he shall be clean
[1:12:23] from all your filthiness and from all
[1:12:26] your idols will I cleanse you a new
[1:12:29] heart also will I give you and a new
[1:12:33] spirit will I put within you and I will
[1:12:36] take away the stony heart out of your
[1:12:38] flesh and I will give you a heart
[1:12:41] of flesh and I will put my spirit within
[1:12:44] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[1:12:47] and ye shall keep my judgments and do
[1:12:51] them reading 2nd Corinthians 5 and
[1:12:54] reading verse 17
[1:12:57] second Corinthians 5 and verse 17
[1:13:05] therefore if any man be in Christ he is
[1:13:08] a new creature old things are passed
[1:13:11] away behold all things are become new
[1:13:15] I read in Revelation 3 and reading from
[1:13:18] verse 14 revelation 3 and verse 14 and
[1:13:25] unto the Angel of the Church of the
[1:13:27] Laodiceans write these things saith the
[1:13:30] Amen the faithful and true witness the
[1:13:33] beginning of the creation of God I know
[1:13:37] thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[1:13:39] hot I would thou wert cold or hot so
[1:13:43] then because thou art lukewarm and
[1:13:45] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[1:13:49] out of my mouth because they'll see as I
[1:13:52] am rich and increased with Goods and
[1:13:54] have need of nothing and knowest not
[1:13:57] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[1:13:59] poor and blind and naked I counsel thee
[1:14:03] to buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[1:14:05] thou mayest be rich and white raiment
[1:14:08] that thou mayest be clothed and that the
[1:14:10] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[1:14:14] anoint our eyes with eyesalve that thou
[1:14:16] me as sea as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:14:19] chasten be zealous therefore and repent
[1:14:22] behold I stand at the door and knock and
[1:14:25] If any man hear my voice and open the
[1:14:27] door I will come in to him and will sup
[1:14:29] with him and he with me to him that
[1:14:31] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:14:33] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[1:14:37] I'm set down with my father in his
[1:14:39] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:14:41] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:14:43] me the Lord had a blessing to the
[1:14:45] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:14:56] so are you happy to be in a house of the
[1:14:58] Lord this morning
[1:15:00] amen to have the blessed privilege to
[1:15:05] gather around the Word of God and you
[1:15:11] know I really caught a burden this
[1:15:13] morning because a lot of people are
[1:15:16] going through a lot of stuff but the
[1:15:20] Branham preached a message one time why
[1:15:22] are people so tossed about and the
[1:15:27] struggles of life and problems of life
[1:15:31] and the situation's of life you cannot
[1:15:37] just say ignore it because you have to
[1:15:41] face it you have to confront it you have
[1:15:45] to confront the issues of life confront
[1:15:48] the challenges of life the problem is
[1:15:55] that this journey of Christianity I'm
[1:16:02] not calling it the journey of the
[1:16:03] message I'm calling it a journey of
[1:16:06] Christianity that has a very specific
[1:16:07] goal to be like Jesus not to be like
[1:16:12] other Christians but to be like Jesus
[1:16:17] not to be in the form of what church
[1:16:20] defines as church but there is a
[1:16:23] standard and the standard is to be like
[1:16:26] Jesus
[1:16:27] and as you situation that we find
[1:16:31] ourselves in today and every day that it
[1:16:35] is not going to get easier it is going
[1:16:40] to get more challenging there will be
[1:16:43] more pressure there will be more hurdles
[1:16:47] there will be more obstacles and as
[1:16:50] David had to encourage himself
[1:16:54] in the Lord we are challenged to
[1:16:57] encourage ourselves not in what the
[1:17:01] world has to offer but encourage
[1:17:03] ourselves in the Lord so I have a title
[1:17:08] this morning because in preparing to
[1:17:14] speak this morning I I always find
[1:17:17] myself really looking to see what does
[1:17:19] God want to see it is easy one time
[1:17:22] years ago I heard a story of a preacher
[1:17:25] and he was about to preach and he said
[1:17:27] you know I had this message and then
[1:17:30] when I came to the pulpit the Lord gave
[1:17:32] me another message and I heard somebody
[1:17:35] say well the first one you got was not
[1:17:36] from the Lord because his message came
[1:17:40] when you got there so it's very easy to
[1:17:44] intellectualize the message people pull
[1:17:47] quotes and scriptures and they have
[1:17:48] their own interpretation and if you read
[1:17:51] the Laodicean Church age but the Branham
[1:17:53] says the Baptist's believe they have the
[1:17:55] word the Pentecostals believe they have
[1:17:57] the word and you can't tell them that
[1:17:59] they don't have the word so so who is
[1:18:01] right and he says that coming down to
[1:18:04] the fruit of it it really is only one
[1:18:06] equal sign that's the life it is not
[1:18:09] what we profess is what you possess it's
[1:18:12] one thing for us to be identified with
[1:18:14] him it's another thing completely where
[1:18:17] he identifies with us
[1:18:20] it's easy to say I know him but does he
[1:18:23] say I know you your testimony as a
[1:18:27] Christian becomes something when both
[1:18:30] heaven and hell recognizes you I'll say
[1:18:34] that one more time your testimony as a
[1:18:37] Christian becomes something else when
[1:18:39] both heaven and hell recognizes you
[1:18:43] because when the sons of sceva went to
[1:18:46] cast out Devils those demons said Peter
[1:18:49] I know Paul I know what is your name
[1:18:54] I've never heard of you before so real
[1:18:57] Christianity means the devil must have
[1:18:59] you on his watch list because you are
[1:19:02] defying his order his system so if you
[1:19:08] are not on his watch list you are not
[1:19:10] working hard enough to be a rebel as it
[1:19:15] were in this that we are living in
[1:19:18] because this belongs to us and due to
[1:19:22] the feelings of our brother Adam we lost
[1:19:25] what belong to us but God has been
[1:19:28] building up a resistance movement from
[1:19:31] since the book of Genesis which sons of
[1:19:34] God who have been sleeper agents working
[1:19:38] under the cover of darkness
[1:19:40] with the greatest cover be in the
[1:19:43] seventh seal to not under there beyond
[1:19:46] the eyes of the devil would be a people
[1:19:49] rising up under their messenger can be
[1:19:54] the final voice to the final age with a
[1:19:58] voice of such power and authority that
[1:20:02] the devil has to let go not just of your
[1:20:06] party he has to let go of the atmosphere
[1:20:09] he has to let go of the earth because we
[1:20:12] shall reign on the earth
[1:20:17] and we and the devil will not coexist we
[1:20:22] are not taking prisoners
[1:20:24] we are not forming a treaty we are not
[1:20:27] signing an agreement he has got to go oh
[1:20:32] you know here it is morning he has got
[1:20:36] so cold that cancer got to go we are not
[1:20:40] trying to figure out how to live with it
[1:20:43] that's not the solution
[1:20:45] we are not preaching pain management we
[1:20:48] are not preaching taking the medication
[1:20:51] we have got to let that Devil know he
[1:20:54] has got to go do we have any Christians
[1:20:58] in the house this morning do we have any
[1:21:01] believers in the house this morning do
[1:21:04] we have any sons of God in the house
[1:21:06] this morning do we have any stalkers of
[1:21:09] God in the house this morning
[1:21:12] I'm the church semen that's only 60% can
[1:21:17] the church say Amen
[1:21:18] oh that's getting a little warmer I'm
[1:21:21] the church semen you maybe see them if
[1:21:28] you are sick this morning your healing
[1:21:31] is not being by revelation your healing
[1:21:34] is not based on knowledge your healing
[1:21:36] is peace and only one thing the merit of
[1:21:38] your feet your faith in Jesus Christ
[1:21:40] that's why people came to the prophets
[1:21:43] meetings knew nothing
[1:21:45] quad feet and walk out healed can the
[1:21:49] church say man your feet has nothing to
[1:21:52] do with your mistakes your feet has
[1:21:54] nothing to do with what happened
[1:21:56] yesterday when you woke up this morning
[1:21:58] and you took your car keys
[1:22:00] and you put it in the ignition and you
[1:22:03] turn the car you had an expectation that
[1:22:06] that power is gonna stop in fact you'd
[1:22:09] have been shocked if it did not start
[1:22:11] because your feet declare that when you
[1:22:14] do that action there should be an
[1:22:16] opposite reaction you don't hear me
[1:22:19] destroy your car didn't ask what happen
[1:22:22] yesterday that car did not see you got
[1:22:24] paid you just turn the ignition and the
[1:22:27] response is supposed to happen that's
[1:22:29] the simplest form of faith when when you
[1:22:32] come to the house of God you can put
[1:22:34] your feet into action when you put the
[1:22:37] key into the ignition and see it by your
[1:22:40] stripes I am healed or you don't hear me
[1:22:44] this morning
[1:22:47] I'm here to preach you happy you have to
[1:22:50] make the revival it's got to be in your
[1:22:53] heart it's got to be in your house it's
[1:22:55] got to be in your life it's got to be in
[1:22:58] your walk-up it's got to be in your talk
[1:23:00] you gotta shake yourself
[1:23:02] [Applause]
[1:23:08] hallelujah
[1:23:10] you may be seated I'm here this morning
[1:23:12] I'm not feeling too well but I'm here
[1:23:15] this morning
[1:23:16] my body is weary but I'm here this
[1:23:18] morning because I'm not gonna let the
[1:23:20] devil move one more inch I've drawn a
[1:23:23] line in the sand and say Satan
[1:23:26] you can go no further your only movement
[1:23:29] is to retreat because the pride of Jesus
[1:23:32] Christ is moving forward we might move
[1:23:34] slowly but we are moving we might be
[1:23:37] tired but we are moving no everywhere
[1:23:40] but we are moving we might be sick but
[1:23:44] we are moving we might take a long time
[1:23:46] what we are moving brother Anthony
[1:23:48] please last week the race is not for the
[1:23:51] swifter the race is not for the strong
[1:23:53] the race is not for the big people but
[1:23:56] the race is about consistency every day
[1:23:59] with Jesus sweeter than the day before
[1:24:02] every day with Jesus I love him more and
[1:24:06] more I might fall back a little bit I my
[1:24:09] black side a little bit up but the race
[1:24:12] is not for the Swift I can keep on
[1:24:14] moving I made a mistake yesterday what
[1:24:17] time God the race is not for the Swift
[1:24:20] and they have lost my joy but thank God
[1:24:23] the race is not for the Swift
[1:24:28] halleluyah halleluyah
[1:24:32] I may have gray hairs but the race is
[1:24:35] not for the swift because once I make it
[1:24:37] to the finish line
[1:24:39] this gray hair has got to reverse itself
[1:24:42] if I can just make it to the finish line
[1:24:45] yes a brightness has got to go if I
[1:24:49] could just make it halleluyah halleluyah
[1:24:57] [Applause]
[1:24:59] I don't care if you're moving like a
[1:25:02] snail just keep on moving if this is
[1:25:05] your piece just keep on moving it might
[1:25:08] look as if nothing is happening but keep
[1:25:10] on moving don't stop don't stop turn to
[1:25:14] your neighbor tell them don't stop
[1:25:16] [Applause]
[1:25:30] [Applause]
[1:25:32] you may be seated
[1:25:34] [Applause]
[1:25:36] giving up it's not in my vocabulary
[1:25:40] turning back it's nothing my vocabulary
[1:25:44] listen the word retreat it's not enough
[1:25:47] vocabulary the best-case scenario if you
[1:25:51] don't feel like moving forward is stand
[1:25:53] still and see the salvation of the Lord
[1:25:56] that's that's the that's the mostly way
[1:25:59] you're gonna get this morning if you
[1:26:01] can't move just stand still and see the
[1:26:04] salvation of the Lord because the battle
[1:26:07] is not ours it is the Lord's so if you
[1:26:11] are tired of swollen day that wait upon
[1:26:14] the Lord shall renew their strength
[1:26:17] stand still and see the salvation of God
[1:26:21] in your house in your life in your
[1:26:24] family in your marriage in your business
[1:26:28] in your children it's yours it's yours
[1:26:31] to keep
[1:26:32] it's yourself choir it's yours to get up
[1:26:35] it's your time it's your season it's
[1:26:38] your hour it's bright time it's C time
[1:26:42] it's Adoption time it's manifestation
[1:26:45] time
[1:26:51] you may be seated
[1:26:53] [Applause]
[1:27:12] everybody feeling fine so I have a title
[1:27:17] this morning a new heart a new spirit
[1:27:30] his spirit I'll see it again a new heart
[1:27:35] a new spirit his spirit I'll see it
[1:27:41] again
[1:27:42] a new heart a new spirit and his spirit
[1:27:48] the Bible speaks of a process a process
[1:28:02] something that unfolds itself something
[1:28:07] that has to happen and even when were
[1:28:09] the Brandon brought out Jesus's first
[1:28:11] miracle he said that when Jesus turned
[1:28:15] the water into wine he said that Jesus
[1:28:18] bypassed the process but the bypass was
[1:28:22] a complex bypass because we're Branham
[1:28:25] said the water would have eventually met
[1:28:28] with grapes the grapes would have been
[1:28:30] fermented it would have been aged but
[1:28:34] Jesus bypassed the process by speeding
[1:28:37] up the whole thing and brought it not
[1:28:39] just to wine but the wine was
[1:28:43] [Applause]
[1:28:47] the wine came each where the currents as
[1:28:50] if it had been made years ago talk about
[1:28:54] bypassing the process all right but it
[1:28:56] is a process that takes you from where
[1:28:59] you start the way you are supposed to
[1:29:02] finished so when the brandman brought it
[1:29:07] out he said listen I'll give you a new
[1:29:11] heart I'm not gonna really cause a
[1:29:13] little trouble I don't leave you a new
[1:29:14] heart because the heart that you have
[1:29:17] it's not compatible with the nature and
[1:29:22] things of God the heart that you are
[1:29:27] born with the nature of that heart is
[1:29:30] evil and God is not evil so you cannot
[1:29:33] speak the same language before you can
[1:29:38] talk about spirit you have to deal with
[1:29:41] the issues of the heart
[1:29:43] [Applause]
[1:29:47] and out of the heart comes all the
[1:29:50] issues of life the Bible says as a man
[1:29:55] thinketh in his heart so is he or so he
[1:29:59] is so is he here mapped out a trajectory
[1:30:06] to get you from your fallen condition
[1:30:10] which was not your fault
[1:30:14] so you cannot take blame for your
[1:30:17] starting position what your father did
[1:30:22] what your mother did what you cannot
[1:30:23] take blame for how you were born you can
[1:30:28] however take blame and responsibility
[1:30:30] for where you end up anybody who judges
[1:30:41] you and where you start is a fool
[1:30:44] because you have no control over where
[1:30:47] you started but it is an expectation as
[1:30:50] a Christian with where you finish and
[1:30:54] brother Anthony brought it here last
[1:30:56] week about this race and it's raised or
[1:30:59] journey of life from start to finish
[1:31:01] every man of God has had to run a race
[1:31:05] as great as me I have run derbys finish
[1:31:10] my course
[1:31:13] [Applause]
[1:31:18] and that should be our goal to have that
[1:31:23] same kind of testimony that we did not
[1:31:27] wash our hands can I just talk a little
[1:31:32] bit I don't have the strength to preach
[1:31:35] so I'll just talk a little bit I love
[1:31:39] studying the Scriptures and it's the
[1:31:41] foundation of many promise in the
[1:31:43] message because people don't study the
[1:31:45] Scriptures but just to drop this one off
[1:31:48] before I continue when Jesus was
[1:31:51] arrested he was taken to Anna's first
[1:31:53] was the retired high priest after Anna's
[1:31:55] he was taking the Caiaphas who was the
[1:31:57] reigning or current high priests and it
[1:31:59] was just like past adornment to Hera to
[1:32:01] Pilate and and when Pilate came to the
[1:32:03] point that he had Jesus in front of him
[1:32:05] the Bible said he was astonished that
[1:32:08] all the accusation that came to Jesus
[1:32:10] Jesus did not say a word now it is
[1:32:13] confusing because if you are innocent
[1:32:16] you would be declaring your liberty and
[1:32:19] your freedom and your innocence with all
[1:32:20] that you have and if you are guilty even
[1:32:24] the guilty people have a problem
[1:32:26] acknowledging their guilt so Jesus was
[1:32:29] an anomaly to Pilate till he could
[1:32:31] rationalize what it was and Pilate said
[1:32:34] you know what I'm gonna wash my hands of
[1:32:37] this whole situation
[1:32:39] in other words Pilate said I'm not going
[1:32:42] to make a decision on this I'm gonna
[1:32:44] have the people make a decision but
[1:32:47] pilots decision to not make a decision
[1:32:50] was also a decision
[1:32:56] pilot decided to not make a decision and
[1:33:01] he washed his hands you can't control
[1:33:07] how you start the journey but the
[1:33:09] Branham said he was born in a poorhouse
[1:33:10] his father was a drunkard that's how he
[1:33:13] started growing up he would have been
[1:33:15] called a son of a drunkard he didn't
[1:33:17] have a great education that was as a
[1:33:19] result of how he started but how did he
[1:33:22] finish the race is not for the swift
[1:33:26] it's how you finish the race so we are
[1:33:30] born in sin we are shaped in iniquity we
[1:33:32] come into the world speaking lies God
[1:33:34] said I am holy then I hate sin our very
[1:33:40] nature is sinful our desires are sinful
[1:33:43] our very best effort is still sinful
[1:33:49] [Applause]
[1:33:51] your own efforts and righteousness is
[1:33:54] filthy rags the Bible says so any manner
[1:34:03] of encountered quality angel of God
[1:34:05] recognized his nature his feelings his
[1:34:11] problems so it's impossible for me to
[1:34:14] understand the self righteousness in the
[1:34:17] message but more so in the church but
[1:34:22] it's a spirit it's a Laodicean spirit
[1:34:24] that's why I read the scripture blind
[1:34:28] wretched miserable naked and don't even
[1:34:33] know it have need of nothing and there's
[1:34:38] been no change of heart
[1:34:41] far less to reach a new spirit we're
[1:34:45] gonna get it I get to read the quotes
[1:34:48] brother Branham brought out a new heart
[1:34:51] and he spoke of that new heart as your
[1:34:54] appetite to something you ever heard the
[1:34:58] statement it's an acquired taste how you
[1:35:03] can eat that type of seafood is it's an
[1:35:04] acquired taste and people are self uses
[1:35:07] that because it expensive it isn't good
[1:35:08] and it isn't horrible but because this
[1:35:10] measure I have an acquired taste for it
[1:35:13] but it means your appetite has been
[1:35:16] introduced there's something new
[1:35:19] something different something I've never
[1:35:22] had before so I want you to understand
[1:35:24] that porn and sincerity lying is all you
[1:35:26] know deception but it'll suddenly get a
[1:35:28] new half and your appetite has been
[1:35:31] introduced to a new kind of love a new
[1:35:34] kind of goodness or a new kind of Mercia
[1:35:37] something called grace something called
[1:35:39] favor
[1:35:43] aha Trane's frantic pleas that you can
[1:35:46] now begin to enjoy the fragrance coming
[1:35:50] from the Rose of Sharon honor and
[1:35:52] appreciate the beauty of the lily of the
[1:35:55] valley because we for your heart
[1:35:57] exchange you you can see the beauty of
[1:36:04] his majesty
[1:36:05] you can relate to it you can come to
[1:36:09] church and sit in church but you can
[1:36:11] understand the joy of the Lord unless
[1:36:14] your appetite has been introduced to the
[1:36:17] [Applause]
[1:36:26] not because somebody's in church it
[1:36:28] means their heart has been changed not
[1:36:32] because they all know the message or in
[1:36:34] the message means their heart has been
[1:36:36] changed it could be working with the
[1:36:37] same old engine because if the devil
[1:36:43] could believe and tremble and if the
[1:36:46] devil could sit in church every Sunday
[1:36:48] because you know he he can't miss church
[1:36:50] you know it's against his nature to miss
[1:36:53] church because he was a chief worshiper
[1:36:55] so he has to go somewhere
[1:36:57] it makes no sense he stays home so he
[1:37:00] finds himself he already has the world
[1:37:02] he's not operating in the bar or the
[1:37:04] club he has those people so he has to
[1:37:06] find his way into our building this
[1:37:07] morning to try to cause confusion and
[1:37:09] cause back an island and stab gossip and
[1:37:12] rumors people in church with the sium
[1:37:20] all engine same heart nice behavior same
[1:37:27] heart you know but the balance and the
[1:37:30] devil can impersonate any kind of a gift
[1:37:37] [Applause]
[1:37:38] and the devil could do everything except
[1:37:42] greed
[1:37:44] so even within the context of the
[1:37:47] virtues but the Branham said there's a
[1:37:48] difference between godly virtues and
[1:37:50] your own ups are you guys real patient
[1:37:54] you will get pay for two months you
[1:37:55] patient thank you nice days there is not
[1:37:59] a patient of God as your natural
[1:38:01] disposition you eaten taxi pass and you
[1:38:04] eaten people go in and wash and you let
[1:38:05] sweet in you you know rushing for
[1:38:07] nothing you rest patient that is
[1:38:10] different God's patience there are
[1:38:11] people with knowledge the rest read and
[1:38:13] they read and intellectual knowledge you
[1:38:15] said with a theologian they have more
[1:38:17] knowledge and people you will meet is
[1:38:19] that acknowledged of God there people
[1:38:22] are just forgiven you see people who did
[1:38:24] an or and if you forgive everybody love
[1:38:27] everybody and they connect into
[1:38:29] principles but that's not the brotherly
[1:38:31] kindness or the forgiveness of God
[1:38:34] but we're talking about a change in your
[1:38:37] heart so that you are no longer a pig
[1:38:41] but no you are alum and whenever Adam
[1:38:48] said after your heart is changed I'm
[1:38:51] gonna give you a new spirit I'm gonna
[1:38:55] Baron taught us and he taught us very
[1:38:57] well that that new spirit is not the
[1:39:00] Holy Spirit he said that new spirit and
[1:39:04] he placed examples he said because with
[1:39:07] your own spirit if I even get along with
[1:39:09] your wife hmm
[1:39:13] with that old spirit if I get along with
[1:39:15] your neighbor with that old spirit I
[1:39:17] can't get along with your boss and then
[1:39:19] he qualifies it far less how will you
[1:39:22] get along with God so that new spirit is
[1:39:26] like speaking the same computer language
[1:39:29] she's like a new heart I give you a new
[1:39:32] computer but the operating system cannot
[1:39:34] talk to God it's like you have Mac and
[1:39:36] God is PC simplistic example so you're
[1:39:40] operating on your wrong
[1:39:41] OS you have the wrong operating system
[1:39:45] so when you have a new spirit no you
[1:39:47] could actually talk the language of God
[1:39:49] because his language is not our language
[1:39:52] his thoughts are not our thoughts his
[1:39:54] ways are not our ways as the heavens are
[1:39:56] higher than the earth so are his
[1:39:58] thoughts and his ways higher than always
[1:40:02] but brother Branham said when you get
[1:40:04] that new spirit it makes you a different
[1:40:07] person you feel a new peace you feel a
[1:40:11] new joy yeah you're not ease the
[1:40:13] anointing it's different for you you
[1:40:15] have a really a car way to come and
[1:40:17] church but that still naughty holy goes
[1:40:22] a new heart a new spirit and then the
[1:40:26] promises out put my spirit and when his
[1:40:32] spirit is in you now now you are new
[1:40:35] creation
[1:40:36] because it's no longer your thoughts
[1:40:38] it's no longer your ideas it's no longer
[1:40:41] your interpretation he sits in the
[1:40:44] control tower of your heart and you can
[1:40:48] go anywhere unless he lets you go
[1:40:50] you can't say anything unless he lets
[1:40:53] use is there anybody this morning wants
[1:41:00] to be transformed can the church say man
[1:41:07] now I wanna strike a bit of something
[1:41:10] because you can only bring an antidote
[1:41:13] when you understand the problem you can
[1:41:17] only vaccinate if you know what the
[1:41:19] diseases or the virus or bacteria or
[1:41:21] whatever is the proper Tillman's so in
[1:41:25] the Laodicean Church age which is define
[1:41:28] as the last age but the brand came as a
[1:41:30] messenger to this age we read the
[1:41:33] scripture I know thy works that thou art
[1:41:37] neither cold nor hot I what that dog
[1:41:45] would call or hot so then because thou
[1:41:50] art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I
[1:41:53] will spew thee out of my mouth because
[1:41:57] thou says I am rich and increased with
[1:42:00] Goods and have need of nothing and
[1:42:02] knowest not that thou art wretched and
[1:42:05] miserable and poor and blind and naked I
[1:42:11] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:42:14] the fire
[1:42:15] no but the Branham goes on to say and I
[1:42:18] want you to ride with me this morning
[1:42:19] because you have to understand what you
[1:42:22] are fighting for and
[1:42:24] understand why this transforming power
[1:42:26] of God is so important and why you need
[1:42:29] to be desperate to be changed and why he
[1:42:32] to meet the conditions of God to be
[1:42:34] changed and why you need to fight for
[1:42:37] all that's within you because the
[1:42:39] kingdom suffered violence and the
[1:42:42] violent take it by force and even though
[1:42:44] God gave Abraham a promise that the
[1:42:47] people of God would be delivered from
[1:42:48] Egypt he was only responding when they
[1:42:53] cried out to him and by the Branum said
[1:42:55] if you don't cry God will not respond
[1:42:58] because as a baby cries out for milk so
[1:43:01] too we as babes in Christ have to cry
[1:43:04] out for something more but the problem
[1:43:06] is there's a spirit of contentment
[1:43:09] little spirit of comfort there's a
[1:43:12] comfort in the thought that I'm in the
[1:43:14] message I'm in the inspiration I have
[1:43:17] books I have tips I'm in the church I'm
[1:43:20] in this church I go to this convention I
[1:43:22] pray and he said I've considered all of
[1:43:24] your words and God's conclusion is
[1:43:29] you're not hot and you're not cold
[1:43:33] you look warm lukewarm as that state of
[1:43:36] being in the middle because of your
[1:43:38] heart you are a hundred percent about
[1:43:42] the things of God and the business of
[1:43:45] God he said I rather you're 100 percent
[1:43:47] or you're zero but you see the in
[1:43:51] between the inbetweeners coming to
[1:43:55] church with no life coming to church
[1:43:57] with no effort you're reading books you
[1:44:00] know but you're not applying it to your
[1:44:01] life you're not meditating you're in one
[1:44:04] day you're out one day one day assaulted
[1:44:07] in exit you're fighting one day you live
[1:44:12] we will write with your family the other
[1:44:13] day they're not sure you're saved and
[1:44:16] you yourself say is only because I'm a
[1:44:19] Christian the fact it is Hannah
[1:44:25] you said are out of your Hut or are you
[1:44:29] cool I rather give you all or no butter
[1:44:32] to give nothing at all
[1:44:33] god help us this morning no more
[1:44:38] standing in the middle no more standing
[1:44:43] with one foot trying to having one foot
[1:44:47] in the kingdom and one foot in the world
[1:44:53] friends it's the worst place to be when
[1:44:56] you're caught in the middle when you're
[1:45:00] caught in the balance
[1:45:02] that's why people say I'm a lukewarm and
[1:45:04] I am feel anything right now that's
[1:45:07] that's why because it takes a decision
[1:45:10] to go 100% it takes a decision to say
[1:45:15] I'm gonna pray I'm gonna stop talking to
[1:45:18] this one because they are not going
[1:45:19] where I'm going it's okay to do that
[1:45:23] it's okay to say no it's okay to say
[1:45:26] this is not right the Spirit of Christ
[1:45:30] is what led Jesus to the temple to beat
[1:45:34] the money changers out well how Jesus
[1:45:37] could move so the zeal of my father's
[1:45:44] had eaten me up lukewarm in the message
[1:45:52] sitting down listening to tapes and no
[1:45:55] joy no excitement no fire no zeal I'm
[1:46:03] really proud I'm said it and but the
[1:46:04] random would get tired because you say
[1:46:05] when you go to a ball game if you want a
[1:46:07] Phoenix proceeded game nobody considered
[1:46:11] in a ball game who's a real sports fan
[1:46:13] and I could understand even as a sports
[1:46:15] fan but if you have sports man on your
[1:46:17] team plane and your team score cool you
[1:46:21] have a reaction and it's an involuntary
[1:46:24] reaction of people who does be prim and
[1:46:26] proper there's neither to stuff stand up
[1:46:29] on top a cheer me like Picasso sorry I
[1:46:30] you realize I reached up here how did
[1:46:32] that happen
[1:46:33] because in the spirit of that thing I'm
[1:46:35] Cora saying if you're ready crazy about
[1:46:37] me if you already love
[1:46:38] me if you if you're ready about this
[1:46:40] thing there should be an involuntary
[1:46:42] reaction where you are worrying about
[1:46:45] who's next to you who beside you what
[1:46:48] will happen to your clothes your shoes
[1:46:50] if you're here go flying in that
[1:46:52] direction just matter to you because
[1:46:54] that
[1:46:55] [Applause]
[1:47:08] listen to the Prophet I was a nail this
[1:47:10] down because I don't want to be cold I
[1:47:13] don't want to be lukewarm I don't know
[1:47:15] about you because coal means judgment
[1:47:20] you finished it beat means I finished
[1:47:22] and in the middle it means spewed out of
[1:47:25] his mouth those options are not for me
[1:47:31] friends and they should not be
[1:47:32] considered by you you should be on fire
[1:47:35] for God every day you should be on fire
[1:47:37] for God where they have no money and
[1:47:39] fire for God when everything going wrong
[1:47:42] on fire for God I didn't say though he
[1:47:45] slay me yet still I trust him here do I
[1:47:49] walk to the valley of the shadow of
[1:47:50] death I will fear no evil that should be
[1:47:55] your attitude all day every day every
[1:47:58] day on fire
[1:48:01] the Lord had cheated me so I get around
[1:48:04] the licks but he has time giving me over
[1:48:07] the debt he gonna kill me but I'm still
[1:48:09] alive I'm still on fire
[1:48:11] [Applause]
[1:48:16] you may be seated
[1:48:17] but when Isaac you don't know how much
[1:48:19] struggles and how much fight I guess in
[1:48:22] my fight is real fight so you think you
[1:48:25] are the only one you want me to tell you
[1:48:27] my fight if I tell you my fight
[1:48:33] we wanna see little drawings a guy
[1:48:37] Ricard enjoyed insane lawyer these are
[1:48:40] stones hitting me and knocking over and
[1:48:42] somebody joy savory Lord holding some
[1:48:44] huge ball and you say listen I try to
[1:48:46] haul up these things I'm a sinner easy
[1:48:48] small ones because the Bible said God
[1:48:50] will not give you more than you could be
[1:48:53] so you are trials it's as if it goes
[1:48:58] retailer or the seamstress and you will
[1:49:00] measured for your trial
[1:49:01] your child is a perfect fit for you
[1:49:03] later
[1:49:09] so wear it with a smile it's a perfect
[1:49:13] fit whatever you go into right now is a
[1:49:16] perfect fit God designed it to develop
[1:49:21] your character come on somebody pitch
[1:49:23] back to me
[1:49:27] you may be seated God gave Moses a hot
[1:49:30] tempered wife by design and he had to
[1:49:34] wear it but the Branham in the middle of
[1:49:40] his trial he whipped he cried he tried
[1:49:44] to commit suicide and when it was all
[1:49:48] over and he looked back to time he said
[1:49:51] he was just testing me it is impossible
[1:49:57] to see that in the middle of the test
[1:49:59] but when you get through it you can look
[1:50:02] back and see it was a perfect fit
[1:50:05] because if it have not been for that
[1:50:08] situation have not been for that problem
[1:50:11] have not been for that trial have not
[1:50:14] been for that test had been for the
[1:50:17] haters have not been for the stalkers
[1:50:19] have not been for the gossip had not you
[1:50:24] would not be here this morning something
[1:50:26] brought you to the house of God this
[1:50:29] morning can the church see men
[1:50:35] I'm not I'm not preaching this morning
[1:50:37] I'm just talking a little bit just to
[1:50:40] put things into context so stop
[1:50:44] complaining it is well no more
[1:50:54] complaining no more worrying no more no
[1:50:59] it's the attitude keep your eyes focused
[1:51:02] on the finish line keep your eyes on the
[1:51:05] target there's a reason that put
[1:51:07] blinders on the horses your race is not
[1:51:10] against somebody else you know your race
[1:51:14] is between you and the line I tell young
[1:51:21] people all the time do not compare
[1:51:22] yourself with anybody else if your
[1:51:26] potential is to be a B+ student do not
[1:51:30] give me a B if your potential is to be a
[1:51:36] B+ student in physics do not give me a B
[1:51:39] give me a B+ good that's your potential
[1:51:41] you might be stronger in mathematics and
[1:51:43] that is the air don't give me a B+ I
[1:51:46] want an A because that is your potential
[1:51:49] it is not about anybody else God is not
[1:51:53] calling groups he's calling individuals
[1:51:55] and his selection of you is beasts and
[1:51:58] his knowledge of you because we for knew
[1:52:02] he called
[1:52:05] so he's not calling people that he don't
[1:52:07] know the problems and he don't know your
[1:52:09] issues he don't know you is with the
[1:52:12] knowledge of your issues that's why he
[1:52:15] called you because he realized that your
[1:52:18] issues is not too much to be a factor to
[1:52:21] deny your access into the heavenlies the
[1:52:26] accumulation of your failures would not
[1:52:29] be enough to deny your place in the
[1:52:31] kingdom of God when you look at your
[1:52:34] report card from your birth to where you
[1:52:36] are today
[1:52:37] he said not guilty not guilty I'm not
[1:52:40] stumbled and nut butter I love him still
[1:52:42] I love her still she gonna make it
[1:52:44] you're gonna overcome i watch when you
[1:52:47] fall but I know you're gonna get back up
[1:52:49] that's my boy get back up again
[1:52:54] if tests don't make you happy I don't
[1:52:57] know what will this oughta make a black
[1:52:59] slider say there's hope for me there's a
[1:53:02] possibility he may be seated
[1:53:08] that's what Sampson saw he saw the
[1:53:11] possibility I said to the young people
[1:53:15] who came up with the lights Thomas
[1:53:17] Edison Thomas Edison invented the lights
[1:53:20] and he had in his heart
[1:53:22] I am tired with Flambeau I am tired with
[1:53:26] candle I am tired light in flames there
[1:53:29] has to be an easier way that I could
[1:53:31] touch something and see like come on now
[1:53:35] on his journey to figure in this thing
[1:53:38] out he filled so many times and when you
[1:53:43] had a conversation with him he couldn't
[1:53:46] say every time I feel I learned another
[1:53:49] way of how not to do it and that ability
[1:53:55] of trying again is one of the critical
[1:53:59] aspects to your Christian journey
[1:54:02] yesterday was a rough day but I'm here
[1:54:04] this morning cause I want to try again
[1:54:06] every time the Sun Goes Down comes back
[1:54:10] up it's a reminder that there's a room
[1:54:12] for you to try again try again try again
[1:54:20] because you're finishing testimony is
[1:54:23] your gonna make it but girls I'm gonna
[1:54:25] tell you every step of the way of how
[1:54:26] you're gonna make it you have to figure
[1:54:28] it out
[1:54:30] the Bible says work out your salvation
[1:54:34] God not working it out for you you work
[1:54:38] out your salvation with the antrum
[1:54:40] M'Lynn you will come at the church for
[1:54:43] the ministry to work out your salvation
[1:54:45] you have to pray you have to fast you
[1:54:48] have to side you have to cry you have to
[1:54:51] give up the world you have to separate
[1:54:53] yourself from unbelief you have to trawl
[1:54:56] the television you have to give up
[1:54:58] sports whatever it is whatever it is
[1:55:02] that's holding you black
[1:55:04] you ever see that people wanted Deacon
[1:55:09] to get on my timetable ever but God
[1:55:15] don't want it by ruse you might have to
[1:55:17] call every morning but uh burn a nickel
[1:55:21] you you pray it when I go at seven
[1:55:25] o'clock you haven't prayed but but
[1:55:30] magician you ready Bible today so I'm
[1:55:33] supposed to call you every day and hold
[1:55:36] you accountable
[1:55:37] brother I'm trying to fight to work out
[1:55:40] my own salvation and that must be your
[1:55:50] desire Lord I want to be ready as for me
[1:55:57] and my house you parents in the church
[1:56:00] the best you can do is point your
[1:56:02] children the right way free for them and
[1:56:06] don't worry about it because getting
[1:56:08] stressed and worried will not solve
[1:56:10] anything do your very best as the
[1:56:13] scripture said train up a child in the
[1:56:17] way they should go and when they get
[1:56:19] older they will not depart from it you
[1:56:23] do your very best effort because God
[1:56:26] knows you may not have all the tools it
[1:56:28] take to be the number one father or
[1:56:30] number one mother but God place them in
[1:56:33] your care and the ability that you have
[1:56:35] cannot be compared with anybody else you
[1:56:38] try your best and pray and pray and pray
[1:56:41] and leave it up to God
[1:56:43] [Applause]
[1:56:47] and live a life that they can see Wow
[1:56:52] that's how I want to be when I grow up
[1:56:58] listen we don't need more talk we need
[1:57:01] more for life
[1:57:03] that's why Jesus astonished to people
[1:57:06] because was just as what it was a life
[1:57:08] he confused them when the woman came in
[1:57:13] with the alabaster box Oh wiped his feet
[1:57:16] they're talking about ourselves if he
[1:57:18] only knew who that woman is he win him a
[1:57:22] letter
[1:57:23] how many room father's touch him and
[1:57:25] Jesus disorders he said you guys let me
[1:57:29] comment here and you guys embarrass me
[1:57:31] by not even washing my feet but this
[1:57:34] woman this woman who are we to judge
[1:57:41] anybody who we just said this one can't
[1:57:45] make it this one not going to make it
[1:57:49] look at Paul Paul was not just a
[1:57:52] murderer you know Paul was going after
[1:57:55] Christians those brothers in Jerusalem
[1:57:58] had a serious problem at all the Bible
[1:58:02] said it they had trouble with Paul even
[1:58:07] he was he was preaching and converting
[1:58:09] them but it had a fight with Paul how do
[1:58:11] you explain the mind of Christ because
[1:58:15] God is sovereign he does not need your
[1:58:17] permission or my permission and he's no
[1:58:19] respecter of persons
[1:58:25] His grace is sufficient for you it is
[1:58:27] sufficient for me his love is sufficient
[1:58:30] for you it is sufficient for me but this
[1:58:33] is such a simple message this morning
[1:58:35] but people have simple problems tying
[1:58:37] them up people know books and tapes and
[1:58:40] can't lift their hand or worship because
[1:58:41] they weigh down we're done by what he
[1:58:44] said my yoke is easy my burden is light
[1:58:46] what's weighing you down this morning he
[1:58:50] said pass all of your cares upon him
[1:58:53] what's weighing you down this morning
[1:58:55] that you can't show
[1:58:57] [Applause]
[1:59:02] [Music]
[1:59:10] and if you are sitting here this morning
[1:59:12] with unconfessed sin then don't you
[1:59:16] leave this building this morning without
[1:59:18] coming to the elders coming to the
[1:59:20] pastor and getting it prayed for
[1:59:22] because whatever heaviness you're going
[1:59:25] through God didn't design you for that
[1:59:27] he said he hated seeing people in
[1:59:29] bondage but at Branham said the world's
[1:59:31] the most horrible sight to see an eagle
[1:59:33] cage is he a bird cage up to see
[1:59:36] anything he'd jump the co-winner builds
[1:59:39] for captivity that's why when Jesus read
[1:59:42] from Isaiah he spirit of the lord is
[1:59:43] upon me for he has anointed me to bring
[1:59:48] liberty to the captives what bondage
[1:59:55] Watson me today be the day you break
[2:00:00] free forever break out forever free pass
[2:00:05] forever drop it forever drop the weight
[2:00:09] of sin drop the weight of guilt you have
[2:00:12] odds against anybody this morning drop
[2:00:15] it today it's too heavy to carry it's
[2:00:19] holding you down the rapture is coming
[2:00:22] and we're gonna be light enough to go
[2:00:24] into the rapture we're not taking the
[2:00:26] world with us we're not taking a pain
[2:00:28] with us we're not taking our sin is got
[2:00:31] to go
[2:00:33] can the church seamen
[2:00:37] I haven't I'm actually still on page
[2:00:42] five of page five of 64 looking
[2:00:48] frightened but is the fun sighs I'm a
[2:00:53] page five of 64 but I'm trying to
[2:01:00] address the conditions that exist that
[2:01:03] requires the Holy Ghost to be the
[2:01:05] antidote
[2:01:06] because I saw a promise because our
[2:01:09] intellect not the antidote knowledge is
[2:01:12] not the antidote your consistency in
[2:01:16] church is not the antidote
[2:01:18] those are means an end the end result
[2:01:21] they're people who go to school for five
[2:01:23] years and attendance one point sports on
[2:01:28] point PE on point and after five years
[2:01:33] the end result is they did not get a
[2:01:36] pass it is sad but it is true I attended
[2:01:42] every class and never was late except
[2:01:44] students when the school never late for
[2:01:46] failures that no passes why people come
[2:01:56] into church and by the banham I'm going
[2:01:58] to it's not even about the wood it's
[2:02:00] about the life because the world is
[2:02:03] supposed to produce the life and the
[2:02:05] fruit of the life is the fruits of the
[2:02:07] spirit so all of your years in the
[2:02:12] message it's supposed to create a
[2:02:14] certain pattern of behavior that is
[2:02:17] supposed to be so much like rice that
[2:02:19] people can't tell the difference between
[2:02:21] you and Jesus
[2:02:22] [Applause]
[2:02:26] listen friends when the Prophet was here
[2:02:29] people saw Jesus that is started to see
[2:02:33] that's that's Jesus because his life his
[2:02:39] life thundered I hope I get to the code
[2:02:43] brother branham said if your life is not
[2:02:45] affecting anybody you need to look at
[2:02:46] your life again whose life have you
[2:02:52] affected when people look at you can
[2:02:56] they say that's a real Christian that's
[2:03:01] a real Christian man that's a real
[2:03:03] Christian woman I said I'm not preaching
[2:03:05] this morning this is a conversation on
[2:03:08] your job they could know who are the
[2:03:10] Christians if your name is not fully
[2:03:12] something is wrong because that's a
[2:03:19] thunder that shakes the devil so you
[2:03:24] have to know where you fall this morning
[2:03:25] no heart no spirit his spirit and if you
[2:03:34] don't have the Holy Ghost you don't have
[2:03:36] to worry spirit that should be your
[2:03:37] burning desire but the Branham said that
[2:03:40] was the theme of every apostle was only
[2:03:44] one message I preached have you received
[2:03:46] the Holy Ghost since you believed I
[2:03:49] believe I'm speaking to believers this
[2:03:51] morning but it's a supernatural element
[2:03:54] that still remains you need some power
[2:03:58] in your life
[2:04:00] and by the pound said the holy ghost
[2:04:02] comes to give you power power to pray
[2:04:05] power to speak power to live a holy life
[2:04:09] he said take a woman there can get the
[2:04:11] prayer answers given a Holy Ghost wash
[2:04:13] her prayers get answered that's what the
[2:04:16] Holy Ghost is given for KO hallelujah
[2:04:21] so can we continue of it we tourmaline
[2:04:26] Laodicean Church each and its effects
[2:04:30] today but the madam said this
[2:04:34] lukewarmness demands a penalty from God
[2:04:39] and the penalty is that they will be
[2:04:43] spewed out of his mouth and by the
[2:04:47] balance said here is where we don't want
[2:04:49] to go astray so but the madam wants to
[2:04:51] horn on on what that actually means hot
[2:04:55] coral or lukewarm he said this verse is
[2:05:00] not given to an individual it is given
[2:05:02] to the church she is talking to the
[2:05:04] church furthermore if you were just keep
[2:05:07] the word in mind listen to the Prophet
[2:05:09] you will recall that nowhere does it say
[2:05:11] that we are in the mouth of God we are
[2:05:16] in creating his palms
[2:05:18] we are carried in his bosom we're back
[2:05:21] in the unknown ages before time we were
[2:05:24] in his mind we are in his sheepfold and
[2:05:27] in his past years but never in his mouth
[2:05:31] so what is in the mouth of the Lord the
[2:05:34] prophet has he said the word is in his
[2:05:37] mouth and the word is supposed to be in
[2:05:41] our mouths - that's where the Prophet
[2:05:42] says I'm gonna Brendan go so now we know
[2:05:45] that the church is his body it is here
[2:05:48] taking his place so what would be an
[2:05:50] amount of the church to it so they see
[2:05:53] seven and then what is wrong with these
[2:05:55] people of the last day he said they have
[2:05:59] gotten away from the word they are no
[2:06:02] longer fervent about it they are
[2:06:05] lukewarm about it
[2:06:10] but what has happened to the world the
[2:06:12] Prophet said the world has been put
[2:06:14] aside so God says I'm gonna I'm going
[2:06:18] against you all I will spew you out of
[2:06:21] my mouth this is the end for seven out
[2:06:24] of seven ages I have seen nothing but
[2:06:28] men and steaming their own word above
[2:06:30] mine so at the end of this age I am
[2:06:34] spewing you out of my mouth it is all
[2:06:37] over I am going to speak alright yes I
[2:06:41] am here in the midst of the church the
[2:06:43] 'man of God faithful and true will
[2:06:46] reveal himself and it will be by my
[2:06:50] prophet oh yes that is so sober the
[2:06:55] venom goes on he's envious
[2:06:57] I want you listen carefully now he is
[2:06:59] sending a vindicated prophet he is
[2:07:02] sending a prophet after almost 2000
[2:07:05] years he is sending someone who is so
[2:07:08] far from organization education and the
[2:07:12] world a religion that has John the
[2:07:15] Baptist and Elijah of all he will hear
[2:07:17] only from God and he will have dust seer
[2:07:20] the Lord and speak for God he singular
[2:07:24] will because mouthpiece and he as it is
[2:07:27] declared in Malachi 4 6 within the
[2:07:29] hearts of the children back to the
[2:07:32] father's and this is my friends it is so
[2:07:36] important for you to recognize your day
[2:07:39] and your message only one office is
[2:07:44] qualified as the mouthpiece of God and
[2:07:48] that's the prophetic order and but the
[2:07:52] Branham said here for 2000 years there
[2:07:54] was no prophet like this prophet and I
[2:07:58] was sharing by the oven in the office
[2:08:00] when I said when Jesus was here there's
[2:08:02] only one name he singled out you know in
[2:08:04] speak enough to come because the
[2:08:06] disciples came said Jesus why do the
[2:08:09] scribe see that the Elias must risk oh
[2:08:13] Jesus didn't reference Paul's to come or
[2:08:16] any other name he said yes truly
[2:08:17] Elias must come and restore all things
[2:08:20] so when Cesar was walking he was
[2:08:22] thinking of our D and if a great prophet
[2:08:26] s will come that is in a different
[2:08:28] category altogether different from Moses
[2:08:31] different from Abraham different from
[2:08:33] Tevan different from Paul different
[2:08:36] Iranians for all time because the
[2:08:41] magnitude of Jesus's ministry on earth
[2:08:44] was so powerful you were wondering where
[2:08:47] does this elias fitting because it's
[2:08:51] sort of greatness of jesus's ministry in
[2:08:53] front of the eyes but why the scribes
[2:08:56] keep talking about your lions must first
[2:08:57] come he said yes truly you must come and
[2:09:00] even after I'm gone there's a
[2:09:01] restoration to take place he will
[2:09:04] restore all things you know bless we are
[2:09:07] to be in this age with a profit this
[2:09:13] kind of profit not the ordinary profit
[2:09:19] this is the one you maybe see that Jesus
[2:09:21] it will restore all things reveal the
[2:09:24] mystery of the seven thunders tie up all
[2:09:27] the loose ends call up people and
[2:09:29] because of him there will be a people
[2:09:32] who will be the final voice to the final
[2:09:35] age for the first time because things
[2:09:39] are restored there will be a people who
[2:09:41] will pray I'm not even up to use in
[2:09:44] Jesus name because his name will be in
[2:09:47] her
[2:09:51] her authority as the bride will rest on
[2:09:55] him she will be one when she speaks
[2:09:59] whatever she says is backed up because
[2:10:02] she has signing privileges to the
[2:10:05] economy of God and could dispatch at a
[2:10:09] moment's notice
[2:10:10] whatever need you desire if you shall
[2:10:13] say to this mountain be moved ask what
[2:10:20] you will happy right I give you your two
[2:10:24] boys that is a sign of a people who will
[2:10:28] speak like that
[2:10:31] glory to God
[2:10:33] can the church gives a lot of shouter
[2:10:35] praise
[2:10:42] [Music]
[2:10:44] hallelujah may be seated
[2:10:47] so Jesus himself knew there's a waiting
[2:10:51] period because it's battle that started
[2:10:54] in heaven didn't started it started in
[2:10:57] heaven had to come to an end
[2:11:00] because the battle had a beginning and
[2:11:03] every part of her seven-inning
[2:11:05] anything that had a beginning has to
[2:11:07] have an inning the Angels had a
[2:11:09] beginning
[2:11:10] so ethos in those keys have an ending
[2:11:13] because the devil has promised lake of
[2:11:14] fire but before the beginning before the
[2:11:23] dawn of creation there was some
[2:11:26] attributes that a part of God who have
[2:11:30] no beginning because they were always
[2:11:32] part of God he existed in his thinking
[2:11:38] and forever tied to him and that is what
[2:11:43] gives us confidence this morning because
[2:11:45] in Joe's valley of darkness God chose to
[2:11:50] remind you that's your beginning on
[2:11:53] earth is tighter and eternal eternity
[2:11:57] where you have no beginning so where was
[2:12:00] our job when I need a foundation of it
[2:12:03] and the morning stars sang together and
[2:12:06] the sons of God shouted for joy Joe I
[2:12:10] know it's hard to remember in the midst
[2:12:12] of your child but even it is John your
[2:12:15] spiritual memory you come from another
[2:12:17] place
[2:12:18] you come from another dispensation
[2:12:24] and the reason you are here is to prove
[2:12:28] that you can make it that's the reason
[2:12:31] you are here I could have sent anybody
[2:12:33] but I chose to send you to prove to the
[2:12:37] devil that in his Eden in Satan's Eden
[2:12:41] Satan made the mistake of coming into
[2:12:45] God's Eden so caught waited until the
[2:12:48] iniquity of the amorite shuffle until
[2:12:51] Shem is at its highest until they are
[2:12:54] Ashiya has taken over until it was
[2:12:56] almost blacked out except for our
[2:12:58] prophet to put the sliver of light to
[2:13:01] see arise and shine because you are my
[2:13:04] people and I will restore all the years
[2:13:07] that the tangka womb and the caterpillar
[2:13:09] and the locusts and the Palmer womb
[2:13:13] [Applause]
[2:13:32] curry can we take some more my voice
[2:13:36] little pressure but this is good food
[2:13:38] this morning this is what it'll warm up
[2:13:41] with him
[2:13:42] five still on page five cuz I
[2:13:45] reading from the seven churches someone
[2:13:47] knows they're still on page five mama
[2:13:48] knows George one of these deals will
[2:13:52] have a silver that will never end and
[2:13:56] the tempers no boss no your thing using
[2:13:58] your boss disturb the kingdom
[2:14:02] you take the government can stop making
[2:14:04] longer if they need to call tomorrow
[2:14:07] holiday nationally tonight to make sure
[2:14:09] you get sleep it'll be a national
[2:14:10] holiday if God sees you whole law to
[2:14:15] make sure Mary get to bed level you know
[2:14:20] how much factors have to come together
[2:14:22] for Jesus be born in Bethlehem they're
[2:14:25] changing taxes yeah they had to make
[2:14:27] your roads they had to census the people
[2:14:30] they had to be able to verify what city
[2:14:32] are you from what tribe are you from you
[2:14:34] want government involved with one
[2:14:36] purpose little Mary on the donkey taking
[2:14:40] our time had another Bethlehem because
[2:14:42] the prophecy pleased him being born
[2:14:45] there and there's a prophecy that
[2:14:48] identifies your time your place your
[2:14:51] season your victory your anointing and
[2:14:56] the prophecy of God can never be
[2:14:58] defeated
[2:14:59] [Applause]
[2:15:06] hallelujah whoo
[2:15:11] [Applause]
[2:15:17] the problem today people look at the
[2:15:19] world as a history looking but if you
[2:15:23] see the Sun noting as a present tense
[2:15:26] thing as a living book this book is the
[2:15:30] life is you only book that's a life this
[2:15:34] book always was this book always will be
[2:15:37] what was said in the before present
[2:15:40] future is all one because he's eternal
[2:15:42] he is Alpha Omega beginning and same
[2:15:46] yesterday today and forever no matter
[2:15:50] how inside of here
[2:15:55] I am sure when Isaiah was speaking the
[2:16:00] Spirit of the Lord is upon me for he has
[2:16:02] anointed me those who were here that
[2:16:04] word for that day
[2:16:05] failure knowing to come and offer those
[2:16:06] words it was real in that day but when
[2:16:09] Jesus came it was also present tense it
[2:16:12] was spoken in prophecy but it was in
[2:16:15] present tense also because in the
[2:16:17] economy of God there's no measure of
[2:16:19] time this time thing is the chappy devil
[2:16:22] when he was kicked out of eternity and
[2:16:25] trapped in time so we can beat him up in
[2:16:28] time before we return back to eternity
[2:16:32] don't tell me how much time the doctor
[2:16:35] give you doctor can talk about time time
[2:16:37] is subject our feet we are eternal
[2:16:41] creatures come from the earth day the
[2:16:44] day that has no beginning has no ending
[2:16:52] you may be seated it is that revelation
[2:16:56] of the difference between time and
[2:16:58] eternity that could allow you to say let
[2:17:01] the weak say I am strong because it
[2:17:03] takes you from your current situation
[2:17:05] for your eternal position in eternity
[2:17:08] you are strong it may take time to bring
[2:17:11] it a manifestation but because there's
[2:17:13] no construct of time and eternity you
[2:17:16] can count the things as not as though
[2:17:18] they were
[2:17:19] [Applause]
[2:17:31] somebody's getting it it's because of
[2:17:35] this confusion between time and eternity
[2:17:38] you can thank him in advance that woman
[2:17:45] with the dead son who was right into the
[2:17:48] Prophet Elisha her boy was dead but as
[2:17:51] she was writing this is what's going on
[2:17:53] all as well she was not in time she was
[2:17:57] riding in eternity
[2:18:02] it takes a revelation to discern the
[2:18:06] difference between time and eternity
[2:18:07] because brother Branham taught us
[2:18:09] eternity is another dimension it's right
[2:18:12] around us you don't hear me respond it
[2:18:14] it's right here right now he said you
[2:18:16] can't see the TV waves with your eyes
[2:18:18] you can't see the radio waves with your
[2:18:21] eyes but they are here right now listen
[2:18:25] you may be seated
[2:18:26] we're going somewhere don't worry they
[2:18:30] got food afterwards be seated be
[2:18:32] comfortable we're gonna be here for a
[2:18:34] while one of the curses of the Laodicean
[2:18:38] Church age is blind and don't know it it
[2:18:42] takes the Holy Ghost to lift the
[2:18:45] blindness to see what the natural eyes
[2:18:48] cannot see so when Elijah woke up that
[2:18:51] morning when the king of Syria did the
[2:18:56] Commission of Inquiry he revisited to
[2:18:59] find out how the children of Israel
[2:19:01] always know the Platteville plans every
[2:19:09] time the king of syria finish a meeting
[2:19:12] and see we go in here israel already
[2:19:14] know they performed a whole commission
[2:19:18] of inquiry did you spy for us did you
[2:19:20] talk to the israelites listen nobody
[2:19:22] boss we all leave the room yet when the
[2:19:27] investigator said as a man is a prophet
[2:19:29] in a land whose name is Elijah and he
[2:19:32] sees what going on in a bedroom he see
[2:19:35] what going on in a living room he see
[2:19:37] what going on any back of the house
[2:19:39] [Music]
[2:19:39] [Applause]
[2:19:46] you may be seated they say let's go and
[2:19:48] get him
[2:19:49] you may be seated you know never it has
[2:19:52] a penis I have real penis
[2:19:55] if this man seein what happening in your
[2:19:57] meetings
[2:19:58] oh you can see it going again if every
[2:20:04] time you plan an attack he know you're
[2:20:06] planning
[2:20:06] oh you can plan to run catch him you
[2:20:09] can't catch that kind of a man and
[2:20:12] noting the devil can never catch you
[2:20:14] because you come from that class
[2:20:28] you may be seated so that morning
[2:20:31] there's nothing like waking up in the
[2:20:34] morning without a key in the world Eli
[2:20:36] so cut up Sheena for omelets and Harmon
[2:20:39] hash browns and toast with rye bread
[2:20:43] orange juice with coffee grate some
[2:20:46] nutmeg and cinnamon in the coffee try it
[2:20:48] you like us he cut up that morning
[2:20:51] flipping the omelet turning around the
[2:20:53] sausages meanwhile he's a southern boy
[2:20:57] Goethe said and sees all the army of
[2:21:00] Syria
[2:21:00] he said he Leiter you'll see we're going
[2:21:02] on Elijah flip it one more time and say
[2:21:09] Lord Lord this poison Laodicea he is
[2:21:13] blind open up his blind eyes and when
[2:21:18] that boy looks again he has been pulled
[2:21:21] from Laodicea into the bright age he had
[2:21:24] been pulled from time into eternity yet
[2:21:26] been perfect want I mentioned to the
[2:21:29] other dimension he said wait a minute
[2:21:31] they are more for us than against us and
[2:21:35] I look in this room this morning they
[2:21:37] are more for us than against us
[2:21:40] [Applause]

[2:22:20] gonna get the Holy Ghost you are gonna
[2:22:22] have a revival we are gonna have a

[2:22:33] the panel that'll shake the devil
[2:22:40] Halloween you maybe seen it for a minute

[2:22:52] fear
[2:22:53] challenges you to do the unexpected
[2:22:57] fifth challenges you to go beyond your
[2:23:00] feeling I am sure that when Joshua and
[2:23:04] they walked around the walls of Jericho
[2:23:05] there would have been people who may
[2:23:07] determine feeling well not everybody
[2:23:11] have the same physical conditioning but
[2:23:13] Jesse said when I bit it a shout shout
[2:23:16] your sword might be not as good as my
[2:23:19] shout my child might be shorter than
[2:23:20] your shout but when we get there we
[2:23:22] shorten because it's a victory shout it

[2:24:37] hallelujah friends you may be seated for
[2:24:41] a minute and this is where I say the
[2:24:46] Bible qualifies many things the Bible
[2:24:49] said if two shall agree touching
[2:24:51] anything it places no restriction on the
[2:24:56] action of two agreeing it's the same
[2:25:00] principle as God asking is anything too
[2:25:03] hard for the Lord there are no
[2:25:04] restrictions with God there are no
[2:25:07] limitations with God there's no context
[2:25:09] of distance or time or space before the
[2:25:12] doctors hand touches my wife
[2:25:14] the tumor will go down that distance
[2:25:18] that's action that's biology that's all
[2:25:21] kind of stuff at the same time that's
[2:25:23] the God reserving friends if two shall
[2:25:32] agree but the Branum identified he said

[2:25:54] some of you have different problems but
[2:25:57] don't hold back the blessing on somebody
[2:26:00] because you are on your own
[2:26:02] tangent in your own pity party
[2:26:06] [Applause]
[2:26:08] because the anointing that will come
[2:26:10] will throw you out the church because
[2:26:14] God will not restrict the blessing on
[2:26:17] his people because of your laziness your
[2:26:21] own pity party there are a lot of
[2:26:23] Moses's in the church crying and cause
[2:26:26] it why crying stop the foolishness speak

[2:28:10] this physical building but you could
[2:28:12] construct a spiritual building and the
[2:28:16] material of that construction is praise
[2:28:18] so he can inhabit the praises of his
[2:28:21] people so when you appraise he now has a
[2:28:24] spiritual tabernacle and you are his

[2:33:18] what the Lord will do but I believe that
[2:33:20] in my heart is striking somebody this
[2:33:23] morning I just want to read a quote from
[2:33:29] the Prophet just Italian I title a new
[2:33:34] heart a new spirit his spirit from a
[2:33:38] message the Intervale but the Baron said
[2:33:40] notice you put a new spirit God has to
[2:33:44] give you a new spirit or you couldn't
[2:33:47] even get along with him you can't get
[2:33:51] along with yourself that old devil
[2:33:54] spirit you had in you so he's got to put
[2:33:57] a new spirit in you so you can get along
[2:34:00] with his spirit amen
[2:34:01] I will put a new spirit in them and I
[2:34:04] will put my spirit in them he said after
[2:34:08] he's give you a new spirit that's you
[2:34:12] don't get it confused with God's Spirit
[2:34:15] it's not
[2:34:16] it's your new spirit so you can get
[2:34:19] along with the Holy Spirit if he ever
[2:34:22] gives it to you
[2:34:23] amen cuz you in your condition never get
[2:34:27] along
[2:34:28] you can't get along with your wife you
[2:34:30] can't get along with your husband can't
[2:34:32] get along with your neighbor how are you
[2:34:34] ever going to get along with God so he
[2:34:38] has to give you a new spirit before you
[2:34:40] can get along with him so he puts a new
[2:34:43] spirit in you and then he puts his
[2:34:46] spirit in you gives you a new spirit a
[2:34:49] new outlook a new feet then he puts his
[2:34:52] holy spirit in you notice can the church
[2:34:55] say Amen just a kneeling down hidden
[2:34:58] life with Christ many people have no
[2:35:00] spirit God had to give you a new spirit
[2:35:02] to get along with his spirit some people
[2:35:07] so mean they can't even get along with
[2:35:08] themselves let alone with God if he come
[2:35:11] that's right so doubtful and up and down
[2:35:15] you hear the Prophet God has to give you
[2:35:18] a new spirit give you a new nature so
[2:35:21] you can get along with his spirit when
[2:35:24] it comes I hope you see it God gives you
[2:35:27] a new spirit for yourself and then puts
[2:35:30] his Holy Spirit in there to dwell with
[2:35:33] you and abide with you last quote on
[2:35:40] this from a hidden life in Christ he
[2:35:46] said he'd give you a new spirit now that
[2:35:48] spirit isn't God's Spirit that's your
[2:35:50] spirit God gives you a new spirit then
[2:35:52] he says I'll put my spirit in him but
[2:35:55] the thing is God has to do is give you a
[2:35:58] new spirit make your nature a little
[2:36:00] more gentle and settle down or he
[2:36:05] couldn't live with you so yes to get you
[2:36:07] fixed up first before he can come in
[2:36:10] I'll give you a new spirit then you
[2:36:14] could take him anywhere oh my you could
[2:36:18] go all kinds of places he's got to get
[2:36:21] you fixed so you can entertain him right
[2:36:25] the church say man you love the Lord
[2:36:27] this morning you could be gonna play
[2:36:30] something softly as I get ready to close
[2:36:34] out this morning friends friends we talk
[2:36:39] about the transforming power of God to
[2:36:45] turn you from a woman to a butterfly to
[2:36:52] turn you from your nature into a nature
[2:36:55] that he could step in but he could fill
[2:36:59] you not just a part of you but fill all
[2:37:02] of you
[2:37:05] I love speaking about Peter because from
[2:37:10] my own personal testimony I I see my
[2:37:13] life in Peter Peter wasn't always a
[2:37:17] strong Christian Peter had his moments
[2:37:21] of reluctance yet his moment of bravery
[2:37:24] he had his moments of doubt
[2:37:27] yet his moments of weaknesses he had
[2:37:30] moments of frustration after three and a
[2:37:33] half years with Jesus his best response
[2:37:36] after hearing the Sermon on the mountain
[2:37:40] was the chirp of a man is this was not
[2:37:45] at the beginning of the three and a half
[2:37:47] years this is Jesus about to be
[2:37:49] crucified it goes to show that hearing
[2:37:52] the word doesn't change your behavior it
[2:37:55] takes something more than hearing the
[2:37:58] world to change your behavior it takes a
[2:38:00] spiritual experience with God with the
[2:38:04] Holy Ghost itself to change what's on
[2:38:08] the inside his mind had been opened up
[2:38:12] he had caught revelation who do men say
[2:38:16] I am tower the Christ that same Peter
[2:38:21] this experience was before he chopped
[2:38:24] the guy years off
[2:38:26] [Music]
[2:38:31] in fact in Matthew 16 when Peter got his
[2:38:34] greatest revelation a couple verses
[2:38:36] later Jesus wings on pizza and says get
[2:38:41] thee behind me Satan
[2:38:44] because Pizza had gone off the word and
[2:38:47] told Jesus you shouldn't get crucified
[2:38:49] you see him pizza so God was taking
[2:38:55] Peter true a number of experiences to
[2:38:58] lead him to a destination the Upper Room
[2:39:04] Jesus had given pizza power to cast out
[2:39:08] Devils and he said rejoice not because
[2:39:11] of that but rejoice because your names
[2:39:13] are in the book because because your
[2:39:15] names are in the book you have an
[2:39:17] appointment with the Holy Ghost
[2:39:22] you might have a new heart you might
[2:39:24] never know spirit but you still need my
[2:39:26] spirit Peter you have seen miracles you
[2:39:31] have heard there's nobody who preach
[2:39:33] like Jesus I know it's beautiful Jesus
[2:39:37] didn't preach complicated the kingdom of
[2:39:41] heaven is like a net cast into the sea
[2:39:44] the kingdom of heaven is like ten
[2:39:46] virgins
[2:39:48] he gives a story of the prodigal son he
[2:39:50] that's the simplicity of the greatest
[2:39:54] preacher who ever walked it and Peter
[2:39:57] was there and he still had his struggles
[2:40:02] he still had his moments Jesus dealing
[2:40:07] with the whole crucifixion timeline and
[2:40:09] busy pizza want you there in that
[2:40:11] service on the 18th of February yeah I
[2:40:16] don't know we're talking about
[2:40:17] [Music]
[2:40:19] don't you know Jesus want you on the
[2:40:21] Fahrenheit when it's a pity just
[2:40:23] shouting my name is Denise out he said I
[2:40:25] wasn't me
[2:40:26] Peter I saw you there and five and Peter
[2:40:31] decided to use some choice language to
[2:40:34] differentiate because you know
[2:40:35] Christians don't speak like that but yet
[2:40:38] still God protects the native pizza for
[2:40:42] the upper room
[2:40:43] because God knew that one encounter but
[2:40:49] the Holy Ghost itself will do more in
[2:40:52] five minutes than 30 years of sitting
[2:40:55] out in a church pew
[2:41:02] that's why I said two weeks ago Pizza
[2:41:05] needed a personal experience with God
[2:41:08] and there are different experiences you
[2:41:11] have a good pizza saw the fish come out
[2:41:15] when there was no fish Beatle walked in
[2:41:17] the water those were all experiences
[2:41:21] that he went through but they still did
[2:41:23] not compare to when the Holy Ghost drop
[2:41:27] down into the sockets of his soul
[2:41:29] [Music]
[2:41:31] and his spirit was now inside Peter's
[2:41:34] heart until Peter could no longer
[2:41:38] control himself though in the book of
[2:41:40] Acts men and the ninth and Sapphira came
[2:41:42] he said you ever lied to me you lied to
[2:41:46] the Holy Ghost
[2:41:48] because he is controlling hard friends
[2:41:54] the season is changing and I don't want
[2:41:57] you to be guilty of the Laodicean spirit
[2:41:59] where you comfortable you are ease in
[2:42:02] Zion but really you're miserable and
[2:42:06] naked and blind and don't even know it
[2:42:08] having a form of godliness but denying
[2:42:11] the power the power of the Holy Ghost
[2:42:17] makes it a be a day where you can say
[2:42:20] Lord it's me me in need of a touch me
[2:42:26] and need of the Holy Ghost
[2:42:28] me and need of a transformation and
[2:42:31] wherever you are today maybe you need a
[2:42:34] new heart maybe you need a new spirit
[2:42:36] maybe you need his spirit wherever you
[2:42:39] are this morning say Lord changed me if
[2:42:44] you need a new heart say Lord I've never
[2:42:46] met you before
[2:42:47] [Music]
[2:42:50] glory me a new heart
[2:42:53] lord I can't get along with my wife I
[2:42:55] can't get along with my children lord I
[2:42:56] need I need a new spirit coz if I can't
[2:42:59] get along with my wife my brother my
[2:43:01] sister how could I even get along with
[2:43:03] you that's what a prophet taught and if
[2:43:06] you have that new spirit say Lord I need
[2:43:08] your spirit so I need a Holy Ghost they
[2:43:13] were in the upper room
[2:43:14] desperate for Court himself to drop down
[2:43:20] in the sockets of their souls
[2:43:23] if there's anything you take away from
[2:43:25] this service this morning his Lord I
[2:43:28] can't go on the same way I've been going
[2:43:30] I need more and by the brand I'm taught
[2:43:34] us even when you're filled is that the
[2:43:37] dynamics to this church will be a
[2:43:39] refilling of what was worked in a
[2:43:43] smaller measure
[2:43:45] so we all have something to look forward
[2:43:47] to this morning we all remember to cry
[2:43:50] out for this morning
[2:43:54] friends let's get desperate let's catch
[2:43:58] a burden for your life catch your burden
[2:44:03] for your house catch a burden for your
[2:44:06] children a burden expressed to God will
[2:44:10] do more for your children I'm talking to
[2:44:12] them for six days
[2:44:16] I am Shores as the hockey right have
[2:44:18] spoken to her boys many times tell her
[2:44:21] about church tell my mother Lord tell me
[2:44:23] because she was a believer
[2:44:24] I remember the Branham told his
[2:44:26] testimony she could have said that's
[2:44:27] nothing but the truth
[2:44:29] [Music]
[2:44:31] and the Lord told her prophet give her
[2:44:33] whatever she wants
[2:44:35] and her burden expressed itself in what
[2:44:38] she asked for and if God this morning
[2:44:41] with the grand deepest desires of your
[2:44:44] heart
[2:44:45] what is that desire make sure it's a
[2:44:49] deeply rooted spiritual desire not money
[2:44:55] not a new job that can be your deepest
[2:44:57] desire not a raise on a promotion that
[2:45:00] cannot be your deepest desire
[2:45:05] not even healing because that'll take
[2:45:07] care of itself the Holy Ghost is eternal
[2:45:12] life
[2:45:14] [Music]
[2:45:19] it's hard to preach this kind of a
[2:45:21] service and not give individuals the
[2:45:24] opportunity to talk to God for a few
[2:45:27] minutes
[2:45:31] if you want to come to the altar this
[2:45:32] morning will pray for you this morning
[2:45:35] if you are struggling this morning and
[2:45:38] you are fighting the Laodicean spirit
[2:45:42] struggling and you can't break free and
[2:45:45] today is your day to see Lord I want to
[2:45:47] break free with a Branham said the
[2:45:51] Laodicean people lost the fluency did
[2:45:53] they lost the desire they took did it
[2:45:57] became password it became just coming to
[2:46:00] church it became a formality it became a
[2:46:05] routine it became a ritual
[2:46:09] Oh God but Anthony you could begin the
[2:46:13] same
