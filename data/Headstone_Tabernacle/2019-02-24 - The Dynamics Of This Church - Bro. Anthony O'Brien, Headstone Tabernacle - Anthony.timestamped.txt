[59:13] dynamics of this church isn't all right
[59:15] a man of my subject God reproduces
[59:17] himself now I was reading this quote
[59:20] here and I was saying that he said the
[59:23] big machine you've got all the mechanics
[59:25] see all the world system government
[59:27] system right its mechanic just leaning
[59:30] me he said any only thing they have to
[59:32] do is to have Satan get in here in there
[59:35] with his dynamics to force the marking
[59:39] of the beast so it's like the wires
[59:41] already plugged in everything is hooked
[59:44] up and all they waiting on is this
[59:47] Luciferian satanic spirit to come into
[59:50] it and to empower it and enforce this
[59:54] system but the devil has had a long time
[59:57] to set up his Eden and he has done it
[1:00:01] marvelously there's technology is
[1:00:03] convenience there's buildings his
[1:00:06] architecture is government system
[1:00:09] structures to second coffee why would
[1:00:12] you want to leave this earth there has
[1:00:14] to be a vision greater than this that
[1:00:17] your heart is longing for but your soul
[1:00:20] is crying out for all these pills and
[1:00:24] all this mortgage and all this mess
[1:00:26] there's got to be something more than
[1:00:27] this
[1:00:28] that we are looking at for City this
[1:00:31] morning

[1:00:36] satisfied we just come in a church no
[1:00:39] but have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:00:41] since you believed Oh have you received
[1:00:44] the spirit it's a pill of fire burning
[1:00:48] in your heart if not Oh hallelujah so we
[1:01:05] see the end game we see what God is
[1:01:08] pointing us to back to the spirit before
[1:01:11] there was were there were spirits and
[1:01:13] that Great Spirit anointing spoke and
[1:01:15] out of it came logos word which had to
[1:01:18] go forth first before anything
[1:01:20] materialized so he said let there be and
[1:01:23] then like materialize but before like a
[1:01:26] come a word had to be spoken holily and
[1:01:30] that comes from the awesome praise God
[1:01:32] original Spirit of God now that spirit
[1:01:36] hallelujah
[1:01:37] it's trying to call you back to himself
[1:01:39] but the only way he could do it was to
[1:01:42] the word so you have to speak a lot here
[1:01:48] you come in 2019 ojala little pick up
[1:01:52] your word to pick up your spirit to pick
[1:01:55] up your anointing for your tale to run
[1:01:59] the devil's out of your life to let the
[1:02:01] devil know whose side we are to finish a
[1:02:04] battle that was started in heaven
[1:02:07] call him man hallelujah hallelujah Jesus
[1:02:17] came it's not right he said the Spirit
[1:02:21] of God is upon me because he has
[1:02:22] anointed me to preach the gospel isn't
[1:02:25] that right but he stopped in the middle
[1:02:26] part the day of vengeance have all gone
[1:02:30] that was not his part to bring yet he
[1:02:33] was gonna bring a bride one day to do
[1:02:35] that part please Papa Haiti coming his
[1:02:37] first coming
[1:02:38] isn't that right and he was anointed
[1:02:40] isn't that all right he healed the sick
[1:02:42] he raised the dead he cast out Devils

[1:11:29] [Applause]
[1:11:35] oh it's a glorious church without spot
[1:11:53] or wrinkle that's what he died for oh my
[1:12:04] hey I'm still trying to read this quote
[1:12:06] here I'm taking my time this morning is
[1:12:09] that okay all right he said now when
[1:12:13] she's forced down then the dynamics is
[1:12:15] working so the dynamics is a working
[1:12:18] palm that comes upon the mechanics that
[1:12:21] comes upon the material apart it's not
[1:12:25] much to make the gears turn to make the
[1:12:28] pulse move to make the thing push up and
[1:12:30] down it's a dynamic that is working
[1:12:33] that's a dynamic power that is turning
[1:12:35] isn't all right the Prophet said the
[1:12:38] mechanics is there he said they've
[1:12:40] already got them we'll system and he
[1:12:42] said now let me say something too he
[1:12:44] said this u19 time to see churches
[1:12:47] uniting nations uniting he said it's a
[1:12:50] uniting time of God and his bride - and
[1:12:55] he said that I say this with reverence
[1:12:57] and respect he has a prophet hear this
[1:13:00] he said I believe that the pride of
[1:13:02] Christ is called oh right then he spoke
[1:13:05] it
[1:13:07] yeah you're coming for hit he's picking
[1:13:10] you up he said I believe the part of God
[1:13:12] is Paul I believe Holland he is he's
[1:13:15] standing in 1963 he's speaking because
[1:13:17] he know there's a bride in 2019 who's
[1:13:20] gonna hear this very same message this
[1:13:22] morning he said I believe the bride is
[1:13:25] call I believe she sealed into the
[1:13:27] kingdom of God
[1:13:28] I believe the mechanics is there and
[1:13:31] they are waiting for the dynamic that
[1:13:34] will take her off the earth and into
[1:13:37] glory in the rapture I have caught
[1:13:43] prophets pocket I believe it and praise
[1:13:54] God a man a man he said we don't know he
[1:13:59] said I believe it all my heart he's a
[1:14:01] man is not right he said we don't know
[1:14:04] dynamics I'll take off the words in the
[1:14:06] glory an interruption he said I believe
[1:14:09] it with all my heart do you believe it
[1:14:11] this morning it's the only hope the
[1:14:14] church has today so I believe it with
[1:14:16] all my heart because there's nothing to
[1:14:18] go back to we've already burned the
[1:14:21] boats so there's no going back
[1:14:23] we've got to go for whatever whatever
[1:14:26] I'll take your sword and run into the
[1:14:29] battle hallelujah praise calling man if
[1:14:33] God be with me then I shall be able I
[1:14:36] believe it all my heart yes sir
[1:14:39] we don't know how he's gonna do it but
[1:14:42] he shall do it he is the dynamic or let
[1:14:46] me say that again
[1:14:47] he is the dynamics so after he set up
[1:14:54] his own system
[1:14:55] God set up his own system in you burns
[1:14:59] all the lust and lies burns out the
[1:15:01] filth and trash burns all the
[1:15:03] worldliness all the desires for the
[1:15:05] things of this world then he comes and
[1:15:07] sets up his system
[1:15:09] his button of light is inside of you
[1:15:13] expanding expanding he's getting more
[1:15:16] greater holla little he's consuming you
[1:15:19] then he himself Christ Himself comes
[1:15:23] down into what he has created and he
[1:15:28] works the thing and if he wants to do a
[1:15:31] certain thing all you have to do is tap
[1:15:34] his mechanics on the shoulder come this
[1:15:37] way come this way unless there's
[1:15:40] something I want you to - I love her God
[1:15:47] move
[1:15:48] what have his own thing going on revival

[1:20:57] all the way
[1:20:58] hallelujah the devil will use the ninety
[1:21:02] nine and nine-tenths but those who's got
[1:21:04] a hundred percent on for God isn't that
[1:21:08] yeah they're the ones that God will use
[1:21:12] because God can the devil can't find an
[1:21:14] inch of space to work in you see you got
[1:21:21] yourself a 1% leave room for the devil
[1:21:26] the Bible said make no provision for the
[1:21:28] flesh to fulfill the lust thereof and it
[1:21:32] makes me think about that rich young
[1:21:33] ruler when he come to Jesus he was a
[1:21:36] good man the Bible said Jesus loved him
[1:21:40] he come and he asked good master what
[1:21:44] should I do to inherit eternal life and
[1:21:45] so on are you gonna tell him well in
[1:21:47] obey the commandments and do what's
[1:21:49] right and it'll come to church be a nice
[1:21:53] Christian so he say well this I do from
[1:21:56] my UT I'm doing this since I'm a small
[1:21:59] man no I'm a big man and I still feel
[1:22:03] the same I come to church for a long
[1:22:06] time but I still feel the same I don't
[1:22:10] feel no change it's become a routine for
[1:22:13] me it's becoming order for me it's
[1:22:17] become a schedule to wake up in the
[1:22:19] morning and to go to church I don't feel
[1:22:22] the spirit
[1:22:23] I don't feel the anointing there's
[1:22:25] something wrong but I just can't put my
[1:22:28] finger on it
[1:22:29] Oh hallelujah I need a change
[1:22:32] but max I need something good master I
[1:22:35] need something to make me whole
[1:22:38] I'm only patch hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:41] bull thing and at that point the Bible
[1:22:47] said Jesus loved him
[1:22:49] love projected itself and then in an
[1:22:54] atmosphere and not a holy holy spirit
[1:22:58] now was examining his soul almost like a
[1:23:01] x-ray on the outside people look normal
[1:23:04] but when you take x-rays it does expose
[1:23:08] some stuff
[1:23:10] we take an ultrasound it does expose
[1:23:13] some stuff that you didn't even know
[1:23:16] what's wrong with you thought she was
[1:23:18] okay you know you feel a little funny
[1:23:21] they come to the doctor for a checkup
[1:23:23] and here was this man come to the good
[1:23:25] master because I'm sure he went to other
[1:23:28] rabbis and priests of that time maybe he
[1:23:31] didn't get the answer he wanted but he
[1:23:34] ain't come to the right place he come at
[1:23:37] the right time and maybe this morning
[1:23:39] you come to the right place just at the
[1:23:41] right time to hear the right message
[1:23:44] hallelujah hallelujah yet Jesus said
[1:23:49] you've got a money demon it's like a
[1:23:51] soul you better sell all that you have
[1:23:53] [Music]
[1:23:55] sell all that you possess even not nice
[1:24:00] thing you put up on that pedestal that
[1:24:02] you have don't like those own now just
[1:24:05] turn on any morning and take off any
[1:24:07] night that thing sell it
[1:24:10] that thing that you idolize God said I
[1:24:14] will have no idols before me walk before
[1:24:17] me and be there for perfect that is the
[1:24:20] commission that God is calling us to is
[1:24:26] now but some of us we keep idols keep
[1:24:32] things locked away and no one knows
[1:24:36] we're shaking hands and we're trying to
[1:24:38] be the best we can and that's alright
[1:24:41] what was the cue yet jesus said he that
[1:24:48] loveth his life in this world shall lose
[1:24:50] it but he that hated his life in this
[1:24:54] world shall keep it until life eternal
[1:24:58] because he's gonna give you a new life a
[1:25:00] new walk a new talk to set your
[1:25:04] affection on things above
[1:25:11] halleluyah halleluyah
[1:25:13] if you're willing to give up or then God
[1:25:17] could fully occupy the space and he has
[1:25:20] in there and he put in man for the Holy
[1:25:24] Ghost profits it is a small compartment
[1:25:26] in the heart scientists don't know what
[1:25:30] it's for profits that I believe we've
[1:25:34] caught put a space there got to be a
[1:25:36] purpose for it I believe that's where
[1:25:38] that spirit wants to dwell in your heart
[1:25:41] you got to be able to take him to school

[1:26:22] precept upon precept oh honey teaching

[1:26:29] not what you need is that Spirit of God
[1:26:31] to come and confirm his word what he

[1:26:54] let's go that he's a big dynamics we
[1:26:57] just become members of the Machine of
[1:27:00] his body that's a beautiful line even
[1:27:02] forming ourselves into his image and
[1:27:05] then seeing him uniting himself with us
[1:27:08] in his works with his love gifts as he
[1:27:11] hands them to us before the wedding
[1:27:12] supper and we're waiting we're watching
[1:27:15] for that are you watching for that today
[1:27:17] Amen they're big churches to be united
[1:27:20] it's not right okay
[1:27:21] said now dammit dynamics of this year to
[1:27:23] be refilling the Holy Spirit that we
[1:27:25] work in a small measure while the
[1:27:27] headstone is coming down to unite with
[1:27:29] the body but when the head on the body
[1:27:31] unites together the full power of the
[1:27:35] Holy Ghost would raise her up just
[1:27:38] exactly like that my my my my my you
[1:27:45] know what that's like that's like you
[1:27:47] have a car all tuned up or a piece of
[1:27:49] machinery or something that's just maybe
[1:27:53] it's just missing a little part maybe
[1:27:55] just need one part to work on your
[1:27:57] hunting all over looking for that part
[1:27:59] hey man that's how God is looking for
[1:28:01] you this morning he needed that part for
[1:28:04] it to work I know if it was a screw
[1:28:06] where there was a plug maybe it was the
[1:28:08] smallest thing but he just needed that
[1:28:10] one thing maybe it's a fan belt I don't
[1:28:13] know just needed something to get this
[1:28:17] thing moving they kept this thing into
[1:28:19] March and once it was in position he
[1:28:23] could turn the key and the thing would
[1:28:25] ignite so this part is getting ready
[1:28:34] because she has to catch the headstone
[1:28:36] there's a void or cap up there that you
[1:28:40] will call out of this laude CH I don't
[1:28:44] have a permit here but he'll call out of
[1:28:46] that laude CH to fit into that void or
[1:28:49] gap towards Donahue stones stones out of
[1:28:54] different corners of the earth all over
[1:28:55] the place God is gonna call different
[1:28:57] ones that's why you come from different
[1:29:00] places and different backgrounds
[1:29:01] different Society holy oh but that does
[1:29:05] any German who you are but because God
[1:29:07] predestinated a bright God put a seed of
[1:29:11] predestination in your soul
[1:29:13] I see the perfection that you will not
[1:29:16] satisfy with who you are that you were
[1:29:18] called to so much more than this and you
[1:29:21] believe that with all your heart and God

[1:31:08] full word back in this last day all our
[1:31:11] scattered throughout the ages right
[1:31:14] that's why God call the profit in this
[1:31:17] last thing to tie up all the loose ends
[1:31:19] to finish all these hidden mysteries
[1:31:21] things that the people didn't know to
[1:31:24] reveal what Luther was doing the part
[1:31:26] that Wesley had to play the part of the
[1:31:28] Pentecost has had to play to reveal the
[1:31:31] open door age and to show that whole
[1:31:33] thing come down right down into this

[1:31:47] hallelujah the Prophet to reveal the
[1:31:52] full word so with the full word restored
[1:31:55] every single part now the fullness of
[1:31:58] the Holy Spirit could come down into the
[1:32:00] bodywork and seal the whole thing and
[1:32:03] make it live and it'll speak and they'll
[1:32:06] create itself hallelujah all these
[1:32:10] things that we're looking for a man is
[1:32:13] not right will be fulfilled at that time
[1:32:16] when it connects isn't that right
[1:32:19] priests gone so I wanted to strike my
[1:32:22] subject here and I know that now God
[1:32:24] wants to reproduce himself I just want
[1:32:28] to stress on this for this a few moments
[1:32:34] and I think about sometimes a mother
[1:32:36] maybe you know any mother would love to
[1:32:39] have children in Sumer and instead his
[1:32:42] hire of any mother any woman to come at
[1:32:44] a point where she where she wants to
[1:32:46] have children or to have a family of
[1:32:48] always narrowing and how she wants to
[1:32:51] you know bring four children and to
[1:32:53] experience that and I feel how God maybe
[1:32:56] felt that way too at one time that he
[1:32:59] wants to to reproduce himself he wanted
[1:33:02] to Tirta to bring forth something like
[1:33:06] himself he had a desire to do it yes I
[1:33:12] don't know how long time wasn't measured
[1:33:14] then but he stayed alone with his
[1:33:16] thoughts and he had these wonderful
[1:33:19] thoughts about being a father Savior
[1:33:22] healer and I know we talk about it a lot
[1:33:25] but I want us to focus on the pathway
[1:33:27] God's building and desire is because he
[1:33:31] wanted to have sons
[1:33:34] he wanted to have somebody to talk to
[1:33:37] he wanted to have somebody to fellowship
[1:33:40] with Oh hallelujah
[1:33:43] no wonder he told add on it's not good
[1:33:45] for man to be alone because he knew how
[1:33:48] that felt and that's why he laid Anam
[1:33:51] down on the ground in that deep sleep
[1:33:54] and out of his rib he brought for Eve
[1:33:57] and now the man who stole accord was
[1:33:59] happy
[1:34:00] Boris please isn't that right
[1:34:03] that man was no longer alone it pleased
[1:34:05] God to see his creation come forth to
[1:34:09] see Adam comfort any time God look at
[1:34:12] Adam he would smile he would rejoice
[1:34:15] because finally after all of this time
[1:34:19] there was somebody on the earth that
[1:34:22] looked like him I walk like him talk
[1:34:25] like him I could be like him he could
[1:34:29] talk to God wants somebody to talk to
[1:34:34] this man and when we pray when we go
[1:34:46] into a closet what are we doing we are
[1:34:49] reconnecting with our Father we are
[1:34:51] reconnecting with our Heavenly Father
[1:34:53] who has a desire to talk to his children
[1:34:57] to talk to his loved ones to talk to his
[1:35:00] sons to talk to his daughters God wants
[1:35:04] to have a relationship with his Alleluia
[1:35:07] with his thoughts so there were no more
[1:35:15] talks
[1:35:15] God spoke it's not right we know all the
[1:35:19] logos comfort creation and man and
[1:35:22] everything else
[1:35:23] finally he was so pleased tele to caress
[1:35:30] because a man on the earth had the
[1:35:32] authority to sign a check he looked like
[1:35:35] him walk like him talk like him mainly
[1:35:39] animals to what you want to do God come
[1:35:43] to such a point of rest
[1:35:44] like all he had to do any evening was
[1:35:47] come down and ask out of our report how
[1:35:50] was the day
[1:35:51] well I changed this tree I didn't like
[1:35:54] this color so I found it look nice what
[1:35:56] do you think about it wow that looks
[1:35:58] good
[1:35:59] couldn't have done it better myself my
[1:36:01] holiday of a relationship they were
[1:36:04] having conversations Adam was given a
[1:36:07] report every evening holily about how
[1:36:10] well he was doing and the father was
[1:36:12] happy hallelujah and corn was desire for
[1:36:17] a son was meant through Adam - even so
[1:36:21] on
[1:36:21] what desires I have children then it
[1:36:24] became to hoever gaan quoted his family
[1:36:27] it's not right but now the devil stepped
[1:36:31] into the picture and now caught all Adam
[1:36:34] you gave him a commission what did he
[1:36:36] tell him he told to multiply and to
[1:36:39] replenish and subdue the earth and do
[1:36:42] have dominion over it
[1:36:43] isn't that right you take control you
[1:36:46] take charge and the devil saw an
[1:36:49] opportunity to slip into God's program
[1:36:53] and to break is now right what God is
[1:36:57] coming on to so before God he could come
[1:37:00] into that multiplying time that season
[1:37:02] that was supposed to come around where
[1:37:05] God would reveal how that would take
[1:37:07] place but ever comments to put a stop to
[1:37:09] it
[1:37:10] isn't that right and that's how sin came
[1:37:13] into the picture and that's how the
[1:37:14] devil the serpent was able to corrupt
[1:37:17] this this being this man that caught it
[1:37:22] creating and slipped us little
[1:37:24] discrepancy in there
[1:37:25] isn't that right and all creation fell
[1:37:28] hallelujah so the devil was successful
[1:37:32] you can see temporarily in hindering
[1:37:37] God's work but that's ok because it's in
[1:37:41] the weakness it's in the fallenness it's
[1:37:45] where he shows himself to be strong
[1:37:53] and sometimes we make a mistake and we
[1:37:57] feel like we can't come back or we feel
[1:38:00] like it's too far for us but right there
[1:38:03] it's where God shows himself to be God
[1:38:07] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah how
[1:38:13] could he be the god of forgiveness if
[1:38:15] there's nothing to forgive but we were
[1:38:18] lost in sin we were souped hallelujah
[1:38:21] we were down in the dumps we didn't know
[1:38:24] who we were real almost cut off his
[1:38:27] night but for the blood of Jesus that
[1:38:30] reached out his hand and pulled you up
[1:38:33] out of the darkest deepest depths that's
[1:38:37] the card we serve this morning that is
[1:38:41] Jesus that is what he can do oh but he
[1:38:45] can do it
[1:38:46] Oh hallelujah hallelu
[1:38:49] if he didn't know guilt you wouldn't
[1:38:52] know that the liberty of the freedom of
[1:38:54] the sons of God when he reveals himself
[1:38:58] to you
[1:38:59] when he unlocks and opens the prison
[1:39:01] doors when he sets you free when his
[1:39:04] prayer comes upon you when you feel the
[1:39:06] anointing of God because you know it's
[1:39:10] not like the world it's not like
[1:39:12] anything the worker gives you know the
[1:39:14] world you've tasted a world but this is
[1:39:16] the French this is unique this is God
[1:39:19] coming down upon your soul Oh hallelujah
[1:39:23] how can you be satisfied with anything
[1:39:26] less than the Spirit of God in your life
[1:39:29] Oh hallelujah hallelujah once you taste
[1:39:32] it you want more of it hallelujah Amen
[1:39:37] young people only after to its taste God
[1:39:41] wants and you want more of it I know it
[1:39:45] for myself that's why I could speak it I
[1:39:48] don't serve God just because to be a
[1:39:51] church boy or church girl or something
[1:39:53] no no no but because we had an
[1:39:55] experience because we felt God we felt
[1:39:59] the warm rays of his Holy Cross
[1:40:02] we know he's real we know he's alive we
[1:40:06] know he is powerful we know he is
[1:40:09] glorious all you have to do touch God
[1:40:23] one time and see if God don't do
[1:40:26] something for you it'll give you the
[1:40:28] boldness to go into the school to go
[1:40:31] into the job or wherever you are I let
[1:40:34] them know you're a Christian how are you
[1:40:37] a Christian because their Bible your

[1:40:46] into contact with the pillar of fire
[1:40:48] getting into contact with the core of
[1:40:51] the Bible you heard about him you read
[1:40:54] about him
[1:40:55] but now you need to meet that called
[1:40:57] yourself by a glorious wonderful baptism

[1:56:18] superior soon you just ride the
[1:56:20] anointing he said now of course we know
[1:56:23] that God couldn't fulfill the promise to
[1:56:24] Adam to multiply the devil stepped in
[1:56:26] all right so God's plan was to always
[1:56:29] reproduce himself so when the prophets
[1:56:32] come Joseph an agent and and all the
[1:56:36] sages of all isn't all right Abraham
[1:56:38] Isaac isn't right they were already
[1:56:40] showing likenesses of Christ I was to
[1:56:42] come but when Christ come on the scene
[1:56:45] he was a magnificent one he was another
[1:56:49] Adam that God could look down upon
[1:56:52] finally got to continue his work that he
[1:56:55] had started on it's no wonder jesus told
[1:56:59] his disciples he called Philip ecole
[1:57:01] Andrew they didn't know where they were
[1:57:03] being called but it felt something on
[1:57:05] their souls they felt something in their
[1:57:07] hearts they knew that this was a messiah
[1:57:10] they couldn't quite explain it isn't
[1:57:13] that much but he was calling them why
[1:57:16] because he was getting ready to multiply
[1:57:19] and replenish he was getting ready to
[1:57:21] reproduce himself he said a little while
[1:57:24] long my the world will see me no more
[1:57:27] but you are gonna see me and because I
[1:57:29] live you shall live also unless you got
[1:57:32] caught had sent me even so send I you
[1:57:35] no wonder he said on that day you shall
[1:57:38] know I am in my father here in me and I
[1:57:41] knew no one hallelujah before God could
[1:57:54] pour out his Spirit upon them he had to
[1:57:56] speak at first he had to put the word
[1:57:58] out there first so he told them certain
[1:58:01] things and the treaty is the son of man
[1:58:03] will be lifted up and they into the
[1:58:04] hands of sinful man it's not writing a
[1:58:07] treatise he be raised up again
[1:58:09] honey pull them what what happened he
[1:58:12] told them what would take place a man is
[1:58:14] now right
[1:58:16] hallelujah he came unto his own the
[1:58:19] Bible said and it's all receive him not
[1:58:21] but as many as received him that them
[1:58:24] gave he power God knows who would
[1:58:26] receive him oh my do you know who you
[1:58:30] are this morning you are not just
[1:58:32] anybody but you are them who would
[1:58:34] receive him you are his hands
[1:58:37] you are the Sheep of his pasture or how
[1:58:40] can the devil block you from his hands
[1:58:42] we know the truth
[1:58:45] hallelujah and the truth is what sets us
[1:58:48] free no wonder he told him unless a
[1:59:01] corner wheat fall into the ground and
[1:59:02] die it abideth alone but when it die it
[1:59:06] bringeth forth much fruit you keep
[1:59:08] dropping off the word speaking unto them
[1:59:11] it might seem like they couldn't handle
[1:59:13] it because it couldn't understand it but
[1:59:15] he still had to speak it because he knew
[1:59:17] he was gonna come around in that
[1:59:19] resurrection ministry and begin to open
[1:59:22] their understanding to the scripture
[1:59:24] hallelujah how to shoot him what he was
[1:59:26] telling them hallelujah that's why I
[1:59:33] told ya I went Christ I'm in some
[1:59:36] transaction took place so for three days
[1:59:39] he lay in the ground but on the third
[1:59:41] day by the word just as he spoke it he
[1:59:46] rose up holidays night the mighty
[1:59:49] Conqueror harlot and in the evening
[1:59:51] service when they were shot in afraid of
[1:59:54] the Romans there was hair wheaten they
[1:59:57] were their parents didn't want to go
[1:59:59] sign it was a too afraid to pray it was
[2:00:02] a solemn assembly but all of a sudden
[2:00:05] Here Come Jesus the Bible said he came
[2:00:08] in to them while the doors were shut let
[2:00:13] me tell you something there's no tour
[2:00:15] this morning that can shock brought out
[2:00:18] if God wants a common side he's gonna
[2:00:22] find a way to get in there because he
[2:00:27] wants to bless you o people try to shut
[2:00:39] go out and they get despondent and they
[2:00:42] get you know content 3 maybe or maybe
[2:00:46] get discouraged sometimes and it happens
[2:00:49] in a Christian journey and sometimes I
[2:00:51] feel like we just shut everything out
[2:00:52] and we don't hear from nobody but
[2:00:55] there's no tour this morning that you
[2:00:57] could close hard enough if you are
[2:01:00] predestinated God's gonna find you
[2:01:02] brother what's gonna find you sister God
[2:01:06] will make himself known to you oh you
[2:01:15] shut he'll find a way he came in and he
[2:01:19] spoke to his disciples and we can't
[2:01:21] encourage them and he breathed upon
[2:01:24] receiving a Holy Ghost hallelujah
[2:01:27] because a transaction already took place
[2:01:29] now he could put in hallelujah he could
[2:01:32] issue out the warrants but it devil's
[2:01:34] arrest now because he's holding the keys
[2:01:36] he's got the authority over everything
[2:01:39] in heaven and energy and he kept them
[2:01:42] the Holy Ghost he said sorry in
[2:01:45] Jerusalem and wait for the power I'm
[2:01:48] gonna give it to you I'm going up so
[2:01:51] that he could come top hallelujah praise
[2:01:54] call him a man oh and they waited and
[2:01:59] they tarried and they prayed and they
[2:02:02] praised God continually oh it didn't
[2:02:05] happen on the first day right man but
[2:02:06] Isaac said and I did not put on a second
[2:02:09] leading up on the third day but it
[2:02:11] didn't discourage them they knew they'd
[2:02:13] heard from God
[2:02:14] they knew they heard from Jesus they
[2:02:16] finally knew who this man was hallelujah
[2:02:22] hallelujah oh my
[2:02:25] imagine these brothers come at the
[2:02:28] church for three and a half years and
[2:02:30] didn't know who he was
[2:02:31] imagine you going to a church and you
[2:02:34] don't know who that man is
[2:02:35] but you just know this is real you just
[2:02:37] know this alive you know you never felt
[2:02:40] anything like this ever before for some
[2:02:48] strange reason something keeps holding
[2:02:50] you something keeps holding arranged you
[2:02:53] don't understand all of it
[2:02:54] but you know God spoke to you you know
[2:02:57] God's doing something in your life
[2:02:58] you're not what you ought to be but
[2:03:00] you're not what you used to be you're
[2:03:02] coming on to something and for all of a
[2:03:05] sudden after all those years their mind
[2:03:08] was a lot I saw who they were and to
[2:03:12] what they had to receive brother you can
[2:03:15] imagine what kind of service they had
[2:03:18] that's the kind of service we have in
[2:03:20] right now we understand by revelation
[2:03:23] who we are and what we have to receive
[2:03:27] hallelujah that you have to receive the
[2:03:30] same penny the same Holy Ghost that
[2:03:33] Peter received and Mary receives not
[2:03:36] genre Philip all of them Oh hallelujah
[2:03:38] hallelujah
[2:03:40] hallelujah you know that that prophet
[2:03:45] came to turn us back to the feet of the
[2:03:47] father's tennis back to the feet of a
[2:03:50] solid fathers that once more this bully
[2:03:52] had direct from God what we have to
[2:03:55] connect back to what they had hallelujah
[2:03:58] we have to connect back hallelujah
[2:04:00] hallelujah is now right to the Spirit of
[2:04:02] God the word stay on books and tapes for
[2:04:05] a long time
[2:04:06] hallelujah is night but he our common
[2:04:09] now is when the true worshipers are
[2:04:12] gonna worship the father in spirit and
[2:04:14] in truth how because they will have
[2:04:17] dynamics and mechanics working together
[2:04:20] spirit and truth in the church or power
[2:04:23] of God working in the church dynamics
[2:04:26] upon the mechanics in the church calling
[2:04:28] sin out Oh hallelujah calling out the
[2:04:31] unbelief calling out the uncircumcised
[2:04:33] healing the sick raising the dead
[2:04:36] casting out Devils
[2:04:44] hallelujah so he's spoken to them why
[2:04:48] okay wanted to reproduce himself and in
[2:04:51] order to do that he had to give them the
[2:04:54] word the word as prophesy as to what he
[2:04:59] was about to do among them and in them
[2:05:02] and all he didn't quite understand it he
[2:05:06] had to say it he had to speak it before
[2:05:10] his resurrection ministry so here was
[2:05:15] another Adam that please Gordon so much
[2:05:19] that the Spirit of God drop down and say
[2:05:21] here is my here is my son my beloved Son
[2:05:24] in whom I'm well pleased to dwell he a
[2:05:28] him Christ isn't that right hallelujah
[2:05:33] was all at God once God poured himself
[2:05:36] into this man God had another one like
[2:05:40] him on the earth and this man had a
[2:05:43] mission he couldn't stay like that
[2:05:46] because he said unless the corner wheat
[2:05:48] fall into the ground and die it abideth
[2:05:50] all
[2:05:51] so Carl had to find a way to reproduce
[2:05:55] that same Jesus he had an urge and the
[2:05:58] only way he could do it is to release
[2:06:01] the spirit that was upon that man
[2:06:03] because that's the only spirit that
[2:06:06] could come back upon the worshiper isn't
[2:06:10] that right because the blood of bulls
[2:06:12] and goats was only a temporal pardon for
[2:06:15] sin but the spirit of that animal could
[2:06:18] not come back upon the worshiper
[2:06:21] isn't that right because it was just an
[2:06:23] animal it was just a type it was just a
[2:06:26] sacrifice God temporarily received for
[2:06:29] sin at that time but God was coming on
[2:06:32] to the fullness of his sacrifice isn't
[2:06:35] that right I fully stopped his atonement
[2:06:37] for sin and the only way he could do it
[2:06:40] was true Christ so here come he spoke
[2:06:42] another one into existence and he come
[2:06:45] through Mary a sinless one and he lived
[2:06:48] and he acted and he did and he pleased
[2:06:52] God and he learned obedience by the
[2:06:55] things that he suffered and he grown
[2:06:57] with a headache he was tired yet at the
[2:07:00] grave of Lazarus he said Lazarus comfort
[2:07:03] he was a man yet he was more than a man
[2:07:07] because what was failing him was the
[2:07:10] power to release you from your guilt to
[2:07:13] release you from your shame hallelujah
[2:07:17] praise God praise God that's why he told
[2:07:23] them that the Son of man had to be
[2:07:25] offered up holidays night at the hands
[2:07:29] of sinful men why his spirit had to be
[2:07:31] released because it was yet to go in the
[2:07:34] presence of God you remember with Iran
[2:07:36] the priests and everything they tied a
[2:07:38] rope around him and they let him go in
[2:07:41] blue and sing it ringing holy holy unto
[2:07:43] the Lord a man they couldn't go in
[2:07:46] themselves if anything happened to Iran
[2:07:48] in there they had to pull him out nobody
[2:07:51] could go in it's not right but now the
[2:07:55] veil was torn not that he had made a way
[2:07:59] this morning the same spirit I was in
[2:08:02] Christ
[2:08:03] because he came up the coast that Holy
[2:08:06] Ghost had not coming to you he released
[2:08:11] his spirit the same spirit that you
[2:08:13] could not catch that you could not
[2:08:15] access that made you strangers and
[2:08:18] foreigners but now through the blood of
[2:08:20] Jesus Christ
[2:08:22] we have been made kings and priests and
[2:08:25] fellow citizens of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:08:29] [Applause]
[2:08:30] [Music]
[2:08:32] which means this morning you have every
[2:08:35] right to clean the Holy Ghost you have
[2:08:38] every right to pray to cry out the ask
[2:08:42] God for the rain that is caught for your
[2:08:44] promise to clean every promise of God

[2:08:52] belong unto the Lord God keeps it a
[2:08:55] secret
[2:08:56] the coming of the Lord a secret here he
[2:09:00] has that all to himself
[2:09:01] no man knows the day or the hour God has
[2:09:05] a man what he has a secret set aside no
[2:09:08] man could know it but the thing that he
[2:09:11] has revealed that belongs to you in

[2:09:35] that from you if God reveal that you
[2:09:38] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[2:09:40] Spirit the gift of the Holy Ghost then
[2:09:43] that is your promise
[2:09:44] it could reveal up to you then that
[2:09:47] belongs to you this morning oh you don't
[2:09:51] hear me you don't hear me if God reveals
[2:09:54] to his word that your thought is gonna
[2:09:57] be healed then that belongs to you this
[2:09:59] morning if Paul revealed that your
[2:10:02] family will be delivered that your
[2:10:04] husband will be delivered that's all
[2:10:05] wife Amy deliver
[2:10:07] that belongs to you this morning and if

[2:12:40] a spark it's not there to manifest that
[2:12:44] power unless there's a power there to
[2:12:47] confirm that that's gasoline
[2:12:49] it just might as well be water that
[2:12:51] don't matter how much t ol oceans clean
[2:12:54] how much people preach away how much how
[2:12:57] scientific they get isn't alright he
[2:13:00] said how well your you got your church
[2:13:01] set up how much education you got how
[2:13:04] much like the Bible he said until that
[2:13:05] wave sheaf until the Holy Spirit comes
[2:13:08] upon that person to quicken that way
[2:13:12] he said that gasoline represents the
[2:13:15] word what is the gasoline it's the word
[2:13:18] is that it's the truth he said but
[2:13:21] without the spirit it won't move let it
[2:13:26] kill it but the spirit giveth life it is
[2:13:30] the life giver to the word the Prophet
[2:13:33] said I've spoken with the original seed
[2:13:34] the watering spirit is what come upon
[2:13:37] the seed to make the seed live the Holy
[2:13:40] Spirit is the watering spirit that comes
[2:13:43] up on the seat in your soul and makes it
[2:13:46] live it's something else then when you
[2:13:49] praise God it's something else when you
[2:13:52] speak it's something else when you live
[2:13:54] it's something else
[2:13:55] it's something got ahold of you oh I
[2:13:58] went to a meeting one night and my heart
[2:14:01] was rich and my life was rich and I was
[2:14:05] praying and I was doing my 1/3 and all
[2:14:08] of a sudden something got ahold of me Oh

[2:14:16] that's what I want today that's what I
[2:14:18] need today oh and we won't rest until we
[2:14:22] get it
[2:14:22] hallelujah do you feel that way many men
[2:14:26] oh my oh my he said we have put too much
[2:14:31] stress on the mechanics here at my but
[2:14:36] nothing on the dynamics he said it needs
[2:14:39] the dynamic power of God the
[2:14:42] resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon
[2:14:44] the church to manifest and to bring to
[2:14:47] pass that this is gasoline the word
[2:14:49] isn't there oh my he said it might be in
[2:14:52] a gasoline can it could still be water
[2:14:54] see it looks the same he said but the
[2:14:59] only way to prove it is to put this life
[2:15:01] on it
[2:15:02] it's not right and it'll prove whether
[2:15:04] it's gasoline or not amen he said I want
[2:15:07] you to try to put a holy spirit on a
[2:15:08] denomination he said you're as much your
[2:15:11] your you you can get a spotter he said
[2:15:15] but you ruin your engine by getting it
[2:15:18] full of carbon isn't all right he said
[2:15:20] but oh I'm so glad that there is a ten
[2:15:23] thousand teen power the Word of God what

[2:26:15] he's finishing his church he's finishing
[2:26:18] your life you're gonna go back home with
[2:26:20] the sword of the Spirit which is the
[2:26:22] word of God and defeat every Amalekite
[2:26:25] every Philistine in your life
[2:26:32] yes that's who you are that's what
[2:26:36] you're called to praise God prophet said
[2:26:39] in the first seal at the end of the
[2:26:41] Pentecostal age he said we re supposed
[2:26:43] to receive according to the world as God
[2:26:47] helped me tonight to show you here that
[2:26:48] we had to receive a messenger that will
[2:26:51] take those loose ends out there and
[2:26:53] reveal the whole secret of God for the
[2:26:57] rapturing of the church I love her but
[2:26:59] Isaac said last week he said the purpose
[2:27:01] of the endtime message was to lose the
[2:27:03] Holy Spirit it was to lose the Holy
[2:27:05] Ghost listen yeah he said Ananias
[2:27:08] comment 47 mysterious thunders that's
[2:27:12] not even written at all he said that's
[2:27:14] right he said and I believe truly seven
[2:27:16] thunders rapira field in the last days
[2:27:19] it's in order to get a bride together
[2:27:22] for rapture and Paige because what we
[2:27:25] have right now we won't be able to do it
[2:27:28] we need the dynamic power this morning
[2:27:31] in order to be able to do it to do the
[2:27:34] greater works his 9 he said but there's
[2:27:37] something he said this comment for
[2:27:40] something that's something is here and
[2:27:43] now I believe it for a mine he said
[2:27:52] there's something we've got to step a
[2:27:54] little further and that's what they're
[2:27:56] doing today and that's what we'll be
[2:27:58] doing this week will be step a little
[2:27:59] further a little further than pray a
[2:28:02] little further push a merry man is not
[2:28:05] right he said we can't have enough faith
[2:28:07] for divine healing hardly he said but
[2:28:09] we've got to have enough faith to be
[2:28:10] changed in a moment I've swept all the
[2:28:14] desert and we'll find that after a while
[2:28:17] the Lord willing we are gonna find where
[2:28:20] it is written and on birth pains he said
[2:28:23] I go God has set some in the church
[2:28:24] through the labor pains
[2:28:26] he said already got tremendous sometimes
[2:28:29] he said but when a church is growing on
[2:28:32] the persecution of the outside world
[2:28:34] believing on the Lord Jesus not the
[2:28:37] promise of the Holy Ghost
[2:28:39] is just as real as it was to Pentecost
[2:28:42] how they grown and how they crack on the
[2:28:46] labor pains but when they are born and
[2:28:50] positionally pour into the kingdom of
[2:28:53] God the Prophet said then the Holy Ghost
[2:28:56] has set in a church some apostles some
[2:29:00] prophets some teachers some pastors some
[2:29:05] evangelists then he given to their
[2:29:08] speaking with tongues interpretation of
[2:29:11] tongues knowledge wisdom gives up
[2:29:14] healing all kinds of miracles when does
[2:29:16] that happen
[2:29:17] after the Holy Ghost come upon you you
[2:29:20] shall receive the dynamics to this
[2:29:23] church is now right are filling up the
[2:29:26] Holy Spirit that's what we're seeing
[2:29:28] today one more quote to be understand
[2:29:30] jesus said see through this mountain you
[2:29:32] could play some softly he said and you
[2:29:34] would they what about it thing taking
[2:29:37] place that the ministry that were
[2:29:39] entering into now he said we're way up
[2:29:41] the road now he said soon the coming of
[2:29:44] the Lord Jesus we've got to have a
[2:29:45] rapture in fate in a church that could
[2:29:48] be changed in a moment in a twinkling of
[2:29:50] an eye to go out or will not go he said
[2:29:54] but don't worry it will be there it'll
[2:29:57] be there this morning it'll be there
[2:30:00] today when the power of this church
[2:30:02] rises it'll bring its brethren the power
[2:30:06] of touch it rises it'll bring its
[2:30:08] brethren and then the part that church
[2:30:10] will rise and bring the other brethren
[2:30:13] and then there'll be a general
[2:30:14] resurrection we are looking forward to
[2:30:17] it meet Allah bless you I'm finished

[3:02:15] ship you have a testimony to read the
[3:02:20] morning seen some thanking the Lord for
[3:02:22] His blessings towards me before praying
[3:02:25] I usually read a scripture
[3:02:27] so last week Wednesday the 13th of
[3:02:31] February I did my usual routine and when
[3:02:34] I'd opened my Bible Hosea chapter 6 was
[3:02:37] the first scripture that I saw so I
[3:02:39] started reading I knew God was speaking
[3:02:41] directly to me and when I reach his
[3:02:43] second visit started after two days he
[3:02:46] will revive us and then just thought
[3:02:49] came to me that two days from now I
[3:02:51] would I had an intention of fasting
[3:02:54] because I usually fast on a Friday then
[3:02:57] the scripture continued which said in
[3:02:59] the third day he will raise us up then I
[3:03:01] remember the third day from now is gonna
[3:03:03] be the youth service which we had the
[3:03:05] last Saturday so I knew I had to be
[3:03:07] there then the end of the scripture said
[3:03:10] and we shall live in his sight so I knew
[3:03:12] I had to have a closer walk with God I
[3:03:14] did my prayer and fast that Friday with
[3:03:17] faith that God will revive me then I
[3:03:19] went to the youth-oriented service
[3:03:21] believing and I'll be raised spiritually
[3:03:23] from the anointing and will be there
[3:03:25] Sunday morning you can keep playing when
[3:03:28] I had reached to church I was blessing
[3:03:31] and thanking God for the three blessing
[3:03:33] that he gave me from that scripture and
[3:03:35] after by the Isaac was finished
[3:03:37] preaching I was worshiping in the wood
[3:03:41] after came to my mind when it came the
[3:03:44] third time I felt the anointing which
[3:03:46] was causing my body to shake so I made
[3:03:48] my way to the altar and they I received
[3:03:51] fire baptism the upper part of my body
[3:03:53] had a feeling of tingling I felt so weak
[3:03:56] that I could not support myself my eyes
[3:03:59] could not open and I was not fully
[3:04:01] conscious I am trying
[3:04:02] the Lord for His grace towards me in
[3:04:05] this experience sister Juliet we

[3:05:06] take anything and use it for anything
[3:05:08] but the manufacturer of the finger one
[3:05:10] who made the thing knows why he made it
[3:05:12] you can use a pen to do you could use a
[3:05:15] pen to still water you know if you don't
[3:05:17] know what a pen is and you see ie
[3:05:19] somebody's turn you pick up a penny who
[3:05:20] study juice and you want to sweeten and
[3:05:22] that works but the original manufacturer
[3:05:26] of the pen put something in it to
[3:05:27] express itself so when you put it on
[3:05:29] paper something comes out and you could
[3:05:31] write and many of us have misused and
[3:05:33] abused because we have found ourselves
[3:05:35] in the wrong place in the wrong purpose
[3:05:37] and our own calling but when you come
[3:05:39] into contact with a manufacturer then
[3:05:41] your purpose can be identified and you
[3:05:42] can abide in your calling and if God
[3:05:45] could really do something with you so
[3:05:47] god bless you welcome thank you for
[3:05:48] coming and may gorkon you to work with
[3:05:51] you service continues this Wednesday at
[3:05:54] 7:30 p.m. make every effort to be here
[3:05:57] on the great expectation there will be
[3:05:59] no service this coming Friday mail me no
[3:06:02] service on Friday and this Sunday coming
[3:06:04] there'll be just one service tell me no
[3:06:07] Lord supper on Sunday Sunday evening we
[3:06:10] are making preparations to head to a
[3:06:13] marrow youth retreat
[3:06:15] just to be clear the only midweek
[3:06:17] service this week will be on Wednesday
[3:06:19] at 7:30 p.m. there'll be no service on
[3:06:22] Friday and this Sunday will only be one
[3:06:24] service maintenance team group six
[3:06:28] please meet with brother Adrian Joseph
[3:06:31] after the service and I know some of you
[3:06:34] would have already been aware but if you
[3:06:37] don't know but the four passed away this
[3:06:41] week was it with a fourth of the church
[3:06:48] Green Street una Puna pastor Eric Ford
[3:06:51] so the funeral going home service will
[3:06:54] be this coming Tuesday at 10 a.m. at the
[3:06:58] Tabernacle they on Green Street into
[3:07:00] anapana there'll also be a short meeting
[3:07:04] immediately after the service for all
[3:07:07] those who would be going to marrow next
[3:07:09] week Sunday so for those of who haven't
[3:07:14] Peters yet we want to encourage you to
[3:07:16] get that sorted out today if possible
[3:07:19] and quite honestly the cost is is no any
[3:07:23] aware the actual cost is to spend the
[3:07:26] entire time of the including food and
[3:07:28] everything is $150 and for those who are
[3:07:33] not staying it's a hundred dollars for
[3:07:35] about six meals or so so I'm not quite
[3:07:37] sure how they're pulling that off but I
[3:07:41] know it's a very collaborative effort
[3:07:43] and it is also done in an effort to
[3:07:45] encourage as much participation as
[3:07:49] possible in addition to that our annual
[3:07:53] convention is rapidly ahead of us it's
[3:07:58] just about five months away it's amazing
[3:08:01] how quickly the time is going and we are
[3:08:05] trying to redeem time you know so July
[3:08:08] 5th 6th and 7th we want you to already
[3:08:11] begin to be conscious of those days and
[3:08:14] for those who need to apply for those
[3:08:17] days we encourage you to do so for those
[3:08:19] who intend to break Beach I can't speak
[3:08:21] to your employer situation
[3:08:24] but July 5th 6th and 7th we look and
[3:08:28] have a great time in the Lord again
[3:08:30] knowing that we don't have much time
[3:08:32] left friends we don't know if we'll be
[3:08:34] the last convention and this for us is
[3:08:36] our fifth convention 2015-2016 17 18 19
[3:08:40] so this is our fifth by the grace of God
[3:08:43] and five the prophet or is the number of
[3:08:45] Greece you know so it's the grace of God
[3:08:48] that we could even reach this spot but
[3:08:52] more than that it'll be the grace of God
[3:08:54] for what he does for us for this meeting
[3:08:56] you know and brother Branham said if God
[3:09:00] would ever pour his spirit wouldn't even
[3:09:01] be our effort but it'll be the grace of
[3:09:04] God and the headstone with Comet
[3:09:06] shoutings crying grease grease on Satan
[3:09:08] we don't know the day or the hour when
[3:09:10] our time will come and when the rapture
[3:09:12] will call and the rule is call up yonder
[3:09:14] but while we do have the strength and
[3:09:16] the ability to do all we can do for the
[3:09:18] kingdom we want to do all that we can do
[3:09:21] for the kingdom as well so as is our
[3:09:24] custom we work very hard to prepare for
[3:09:28] the convention from a hospitality
[3:09:31] perspective from the physical building
[3:09:33] from the technical team perspective from
[3:09:35] the meal preparation and the hotel
[3:09:38] coordination and air flights and
[3:09:41] different things like that so once again
[3:09:43] we solicit your support and your
[3:09:47] financial support and your support in
[3:09:50] other ways in the future to pick up at
[3:09:53] the airport and all these different
[3:09:54] things they all have a part to play they
[3:09:56] all have a critical role over the years
[3:09:58] we have gotten a deeper understanding of
[3:10:01] all these things work so on the one hand
[3:10:05] it is it is getting easier but at the
[3:10:08] same time there are still a lot of
[3:10:09] responsibilities that are still
[3:10:11] concentrated on a few individuals and
[3:10:14] you want to share those responsibilities
[3:10:16] as much as possible to share the burden
[3:10:18] in every way that we can and to really
[3:10:20] have our heart for serving the body of
[3:10:24] Christ beyond the vision of the local
[3:10:26] church and it's to see what God wants to
[3:10:28] do because it's one body and it's by one
[3:10:30] spirit we are baptized into the body so
[3:10:33] the sisters will be downstairs
[3:10:36] with forms if you are in a position to
[3:10:39] make a pledge this church has never been
[3:10:42] one to impress upon the people to put a
[3:10:45] certain amount we encourage you to do as
[3:10:48] the Lord would lead you to do one thing
[3:10:51] that's very evident here is that there's
[3:10:54] always evidence of what's taking place
[3:10:56] and the progress that's taking place and
[3:10:58] of the yesterday we had four brothers
[3:11:01] doing training on a technical system
[3:11:03] off-site as well so we are continually
[3:11:05] looking to put things in place to
[3:11:07] continue to do all that we can do until
[3:11:10] he comes and then we comes all that sin
[3:11:14] is natural is done you know you know I
[3:11:16] asked the question last week what does
[3:11:18] yours what is mines because the Bible
[3:11:21] said the earth is the Lord's and the
[3:11:22] fullness thereof everything is his and
[3:11:24] we want to give our time we wanna give
[3:11:27] our heart we want to give our our
[3:11:29] substance and whatever we can do to
[3:11:31] achieve his purpose he has no hands with
[3:11:34] our hands he has no feet but our feet he
[3:11:36] has no voices but our voices to
[3:11:38] encourage somebody to serve the Lord
[3:11:40] occur in some way to get back on step
[3:11:43] get back on track that's that's that's
[3:11:45] our responsibilities because God has
[3:11:46] spoken to us the 120 no upper room where
[3:11:49] the first-fruit of the 3,000 that would
[3:11:52] come but God had to use somebody to
[3:11:54] reach somebody else and many of the
[3:11:56] young people they don't know much about
[3:11:57] testifying and reaching out to people
[3:11:59] but but that is being as a part of your
[3:12:02] Christian journey and all these things
[3:12:04] we have to see manifested before we can
[3:12:06] leave here because God has not changes
[3:12:09] by the Anthony said we have instant
[3:12:11] coffee we have cell phones we have
[3:12:13] technology but God remains the same and
[3:12:15] its principles remain the same its laws
[3:12:17] remain the same and his blessings remain
[3:12:20] the same so we encourage everyone and
[3:12:22] whatever way you can to come begin we
[3:12:26] have about five months February March if
[3:12:29] I'm a June 5 months to allow us to
[3:12:32] contribute towards the success of the
[3:12:34] Convention and what will go what God
[3:12:36] will do you know so a man you love the
[3:12:40] Lord what what Sorkin says Amen with the
[3:12:53] Michael you can switch over
