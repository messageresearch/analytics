bless us we pray as you approach your word in Jesus may God bless you thanks so much for coming out tonight uh we have prairie Quest we will take right after the service and um what a time we had last service but Isaac where is the Lord God of Elijah so we wanted to know about the second Kings 2 14 15 just want to come behind him to share something with you um Isaiah 61 1-2 Second Kings 2 14 and 15 and revelation 22. verse 17. so let's read from Second Kings 2 14 and 15 and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah when he also had spit in the waters departed his antither and Elisha went over when the sons of the prophets were to view a Jericho saw him they said the spirit of Elijah not rest on Elisha and they came to meet him and bow themselves to the ground before him Isaiah chapter 61 written verse 1 and 2. the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord had anointed me to preach good Titans unto the meek yet sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captors and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptability of the Lord than the dear Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn last scripture reversion 22 verse 17. and the spirit and the bride say come let him that Herod should come let him that the tears come and whosoever will let him take the what of Life freely may God bless his word you may be seated we are so grateful to be in his presence with all this presence we are nothing so from second Kings chapter two we're just going to read back something there verse 9 it says he came to pass when they were gone over that's Jordan that Elijah said and Elisha acts what I shall do physique before I be taken away from thee and Elijah said I praise thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me and he said thou husband ask a hard thing nevertheless if those see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so so it was conditional and it came to pass as they went on and talked behold they appeared a child of fire horses a fan party them both asunder and Elijah went up in a whirlwind into heaven Elijah went up in a chariot of Fire Hallelujah so tonight I want to take a title when Elijah said he said ax what I shall do for thee before I take him from thee and Elijah said I pray he let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me that's the title tonight let out the proportion of thy Spirit be upon me you want another proportion tonight you do just want a blessing you want a double portion tonight so that's my titles and I let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me it's a prayer it's a request it's what you're asking for it's what you desire is what you want from God you need that double portion isn't that right praise the name and he said if you see me go you can have that portion you got to know that's the condition you have to see me go praise God you have to know that amen Elias has already come William Branham came and do all that he had was to do and every direction faith is leaning the messages everything we have needed is already on the earth everything we have need of is already on the earth it's already here do you believe that tonight oh praise the name of the Lord we believe that Hallelujah give me a double portion that's what you want I want a double portion in that right so God had to send the anointing for the Rapture isn't that right so he had to send the Elijah anointing because the anointed to take you up praise God as a Rapture anointing the Elijah anointing praise God Elijah got caught up in a child by Whirlwind isn't that right so the Rapture anointing of the come of Elijah goes and behold lights and United the prophet but that spirit is what went up oh glory to God that Spirit was raptured Oh Glory to God in that anointing fell long on Elisha isn't that right Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord do you believe that so he releases Seven Seals it's not right that's the power of God the word of God but it takes Faith to move that power we're going to get down here tonight but Abraham the we are true prophet he says Elijah went to Jordan one day and struck it with Elisha it parted back and he crossed over and he come back with another proportion so when he came back he actually came back to the rubber portion and when we strike Jordan we'll give the Lord a shout that's a prophecy tonight you know not if not when we strike Jordan with Christ we got one portion but when we return we are coming with two portions we got eternal life Resurrection from sin now in righteousness with the Holy Ghost and then on the return with Christ we come back with both physical Resurrection we already got a spiritual Resurrection so you've got to get the spiritual resurrection and the physical Resurrection okay the Lord a shout we need that of proportion we're going to come back with another portion we have to have a double portion we'll give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah we have a double portion of it always a type of Christ Elisha and Elijah so there's a spiritual resurrection that has to go on now and there's a physical Resurrection so it's a double portion for the resurrection and the Rapture oh give the Lord a shout in the house did you hear that a double portion for the resurrection and the Rapture there's going to be a resurrection the whole glory to God and we who are alive and remain them who have gone on it's not right glory to God Glory Hallelujah now Jesus said the things that I do the church greater than you know if it couldn't be greater in quality it had to be greater in quantity because he stopped nature raised the dead healed the sick everything that could be done he did it give life back to the dead and everything so it could not be done any greater in quality but in quantity these things that I do shall you do also and greater than you shall you do because I go to my father no right here we go now could you imagine after the blessing being promised this young preacher how he kept his eyes right on Elijah I tell you if somebody said look over here Elijah or some noise happen over here Elisha kept his eyes right on Elijah because he wanted that double portion isn't that something like how we heard the Jacob you want that bird right you only watching to see if you could get that birth right he was in every move he saw make Oh Glory to God because you won that birth right well glory to God and when that blessing was poured upon him he could know the father can reverse it what God blesses bless when God put that anointing conducted bride oh God he can reverse it Oh Glory to God we have a prophecy that the spirit will come upon the bride that the spirit in the Bible say come the bride will be given a voice because the spirit so I'm sowing I see tonight for the spirit itself that going to come upon you that mantle of Elijah Oh Glory to God to fall upon you it could fall upon you tonight tonight may be your night you don't know when they're gonna drop down upon you but we have a promise you're gonna drop down upon you oh can the Lord a praise offering we're not talking crazy tonight this is the word of Prophecy Oh Glory to God the spirit is promised to anoint a bride Hallelujah Jesus give the Lord some praises Hallelujah Jesus went right into Isaiah 61 prophecy to pick up the spirit of the Lord upon me yet to speak it you have to say it the spirit Lord is upon me for he had anointed Me O glory to God I pray God Titans or kill the Lord I shout and that same anoint him have to come back upon a pride Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah so if you want that double portion tonight this is not my words now this is the prophet saying this if you want that double abortion tonight keep your eyes on Jesus people don't want to talk about Jesus they don't want to preach about Jesus they preaching everything about Jesus but the prophet can be introduced Jesus Christ okay the Lord I praise offering your message will forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ he came to introduce Jesus Christ the Capstone The Headstone the chief Stone to take us out of here I am preaching nothing less than that we have to see Jesus you have to long to see Jesus we have quotes we have Mysteries Revelations inspiration but we at the end of the day when you put the equal sign you have to see Jesus Jesus we miss the mark if we don't recognize here we miss the mark every reader we don't understand and see Jesus and every word every mystery we miss the mark because Christ is the mystery of God reveal you're gonna be revealed inside of you isn't that right if you want that double portion tonight keep your eyes on Jesus don't pay attention to what the devil say what the critics say what the unbelievers say keep your eyes out on Calvary say Lord you promised it you know what that is they speed in the promise that's why he said the bride has no Revival yet has no Revival no manifestation of God which is still the pride will take them seven Thunders to pick the bride up right he saved the preachers if the churcher will forget their Creeds and dogmas and plead the promise to plead the promise and say Lord you promised it you can lie if you said that you have to keep it you can't make a promise you can't keep you said ask what you want ask what you will and Elijah said I want a cup of portion God care lies that whatever you want oh believe the Lord I shout acts what you want what do you want tonight oh glory to God you want church where you want post you want the office where you want what you want tonight he said I want that double portion Oh Glory to God you act a hard thing it's not an easy thing after her thing he said God wanted to ask him how things oh can the Lord I shout you ask him do Souls you're asking too easy you're asking for little stuff he wanted to answer High things things [Applause] glory to God hallelujah I like Elisha Elisha was no Petty deliver he was nothing but you know if I can get the same thing you have you may be seated you want double because he had more trouble than that coming he's like double for your trouble then Oh Glory that God double to deal with what's what what's after faced with you can't face to be the same anointing you have a higher anointing you have to have a great anointing you have to want that you can be satisfied where you are praise God our people in bond and what not because they satisfy where they are but you have to have a longing that's why you want to say lecture the proportion of your spirit be upon me keep your eyesight and Calvary say Lord you promise it when the fiery Child come down horses are charity I just stepped on and he went up into heaven he had buttoned his room whatever it was chew it back to Elijah Elijah pick up the Garment put it in his own shoulder walked onto the Jordan and the very same thing Elijah done he doubled His Garment together and struck the Jordan where is the Lord God of Elijah and he battered us under one part together notice as Elijah went up Jesus Promised a double portion of his Spirit to the Believers the things that I do shall you do also even greater and on the day of Pentecost when he went up on the day of Ascension the day of Pentecost the same holy ghost that was upon him come again upon the church and when the day of Pentecost was fully come the mantle who glory to God fell upon all them Believers and they were filled with the Holy Ghost having the same power Jesus had oh God the spirit of Elijah dot rest so Glory they were that that's a confessional goal come you know the same spirit that was upon Malachi 4 with no upon Ephesians 4 get the Lord some Praises there's gonna be a genuine file full ministry not press and play tape faithful Ministry preaching The Gospel According to the commission go eat all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature oh give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah glory to God Amen we believe that tonight all right so watch this all praise God thank you Jesus [Music] right yes so he said Elijah went up Jesus Promised the proportion of his Spirit to the Believers the things that I do shall you do also even greater on the day of Pentecost when he went up on the day of Ascension or they have Pentecost the same I like that word I don't knew Holy Ghost same Holy Ghost is not Mary say be it done unto me according to your word and said he cries that sounds good that sounds good but that same Mary had to go in the upper room and stagger yeah I already said that ready you know sorry could I call that back and say I I said when the angel told me I said Christ yeah maybe we couldn't quote that scripture then you know she had to watch the other Mary Magdalene just like she's inside her room and brother I'm saying that he had a glossy Pride foreign [Music] [Music] shout out the spirit of forgiveness you have to drop your old stinking Hearts you have to let it go and let it blow that you can get in communication with God by the spirit of forgiveness because right on top of the spirit of forgiveness is Charity the price absolute oh can the Lord I shout that's the mantle that has to come upon you oh glory to God so brotherly kindness have to be applied and manifested oh come on preach back to me Church broadly kindness have to be applied and manifested that you could come and speak in terms with God Oh Glory leave your body altar make it right with your brother make it right with your sister then come back and worship oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah where are we going with that tonight Hallelujah um and I wonder today people who claim to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and claim that they have kissed the rims of the cup of blessings of God how can we hold our peace when we see things going on the way it is it is time to take this holy spirit that we Anointed with and say where is the Lord God that was Upon Jesus Christ where is the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob where is the god that was our Lord Jesus Christ he said we have to say that God God say that for you you can't make God say that for you you have to want it what you want a double portion of your spirit what you want at Revival what you want the Holy Ghost what you want Dynamics to the mechanics what you want to order half of the Chinese ticket what you want Rebecca's Hill my God which the whole church was here tonight and yeah as in that great crisis they had some want to turn back to although Elijah was gone and that there was one that poured water in his hands had the double portion of the spirit so is the sick and sinful world looking here we go the second sinful were looking forward they look into a real Church of the Living God who possesses a double portion of his spirit not professors a double portion of his spirit what can we do in this time brother our answer should be who is going to be the next president our answer shouldn't be who's going to be the next president or some theology we should gift them the Living God the Resurrected Lord Jesus Christ could you imagine being able to produce the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ you know what's happening and this is yet a night Channel Oh Glory to God resurrected Lord Jesus Christ people camping out outside Ibraham Tabernacle always and always an hour before service even start because they are sick they are hot they are blind they are all kind of condition they come everywhere because they're resurrected Lord Jesus Christ is back on the Earth confirming the word with signs with wonders with Miracles not someone explaining theology you know but the resurrected Jesus Christ after every syllabus he could say I am waiting prayer line so and so and so you're sick but so and so and so and Christ come in and heal the people he said I'm not the Healer Jesus Is A Healer but you have to have faith to call him on the scene okay the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God when are we going to make professions for that we can't be talking for our silver three hours seven yapping yapping yapping with no power talking talking with no anointing okay the Lord some Praises it has to be a space where God can drop down Hallelujah it has to be a space where the minister get out of the way and the Holy Spirit began to work and begin to move Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah Christ the mission of God revealed Christ revealing his own word he said I can't see with your hands yes it's part of your body you can't see with the ears yet it can hear you can't see but the nose yet it smells you can't see with the lips though it speaks that was the Pentecostal age but now it's high time seeing no there isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye the next is the intelligence which is Christ himself who controls the whole body not some man from America sorry not some not some Modern bishop or some Modern message Pope I call them and I preaching this long time blasting message Pope who look under control and have influence over no next after the prophet supposedly the intelligence watch see praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise be to Jesus all right let's let's go watch see down to the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age the seed went into the ground complete seed then it comes to defeat Luther come back out through Wesley into the Pentecostal the tongues and the lips now it's the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4. so he identified his ministry the prophetic as the eyes he's the Seer but next he said but no there's nothing else for him to come but well okay but now there is nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that because that's the last thing there is so the prophet brought the sin right Division and make it plain he brought the vision that he that weird can run no he formed something that Christ himself could step into it oh glory to God which is all about the same one that pick up Isaiah 61 the same one that walked into the temple after you overcome Lucifer with lust of the eyes lust of the Flesh and the pride of life after the overcome himself that same one that went in the templates in the spirit is upon me for he anointed me he knew he was just not reading scripture he knew this day in scripture was being fulfilled he knew the seasonal changed because it was not no longer the prophet what was the prophet's prophecy oh give me a praise God hallelujah my God I'm having a Revival yet tonight Oh Glory God Jesus knew it was no longer Prophet John Elijah it was now the prophet's prophet see Behold the Lamb of God oh glory to God I take away the sins of the world hallelujah praise God Oh Glory the god that Mantle hit Jesus and the fullness the spirit coming upon him oh Hallelujah the fullness Came Upon him led by the spirit Into the Wilderness to overcome that devil and when he finished with the devil you overcome that devil to give us a witness it is written it is written it is also written he demonstrated no power he demonstrated no witness to the devil at all Unicode scripture walk into the temple find his own scripture the spirit is upon me because he anointed me but be fine all scripture tonight Revelation 2-17 the spirit and the bride we are to find our own scripture we have a scripture Oh Glory to God to break into the spirit realm we have a scripture that we could take brother Stephen and identify as the month of Elijah coming down upon her bride the Spirit charity will give the Lord some Praises that has to come upon a bride it will glory record the thing that can't fail even the voice of the Archangel okay the Lord I shout them is going to be a resurrection there is going to be a power strike the church Oh Glory to God and no coming in when man will speak the word gonna flash like lightning Hallelujah there is nothing else left here to come but him himself to step into that because that the last thing there is the next is the intelligence no we have no intelligence of our own we have no sight of our own and so forth like that one Oneness watch the Commandment is so imminent second coming of Jesus his garden is elected together he has got a Oneness his true one is showing himself among them out of every denomination bringing his leg together from all kinds of her churches from everywhere bringing out his children falling right in line with the word now the coming of the Lord Jesus is so imminent the coming of judgment coming up Jesus criminal judgment he's calling is elected together in Oneness with himself and with the same kind of ministry he had so the prophecy is the same Ministry has to come back among us to bring on that Oneness not the books not the tapes not brother so and so from foreign Ministry that means how to be Same Spirit watch this now you know how I shape the churches yes the big Torah was built called the pyramid and Hudson was never put on it remember how the Lutheran scheme Wesley in the minority then down to Pentecost and how what he's doing he's calling from that what did he do he called out the election Lutheran is our message to his thing all these books on tips you cannot believe us that call really shouting it having left who is the bride oh how the rest is tribulation since that's why identifying them all right what he's doing he's calling from what he called out the elect out of Lutheran to make the Wesleyan he could already let out of that to make the Pentecostal now he is calling the elect and the castle out to make the headstone the commented or you mean so brother Brandon was building a building and he was building this headstone that he that God himself could step into it govern the whole body because the headstone pulling up the whole thing The Headstone is the magnet that raising the dead and picking up the the the Riu alive and Remains The Headstone is the magnet oh my hallelujah it's not you going you know it's what's inside of you what's going you have to have the magnetism of the Holy Ghost on the inside so when the big magnet come it picks up that and you win with it or give the Lord a shout therefore the Rapture is going to be in you yeah go into the Rapture Oh Glory to God Raptor going inside of you what is that the Holy Ghost Inside of You the Holy Ghost can lead back the Holy Ghost oh get the Lord of Praise Give the Lord a shout that magnetism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost can lead back the Holy Ghost Hallelujah oh my God praise God so you get it now step into it step into what the headstone so you are being stolen it's called the laodicia to fit into that Holy Ghost slot all right now here it is notice this is when the Holy Spirit told Brown pick up and write there's a little portion of it notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until he seen the father or the father showed him first how many between God and Christ see John 5 19 so will the bride he shows her his word of life he shows her she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her wise men you know why all them dogs and camels and rattlesnake and one couldn't sting them and kill them because they had the right gifts to identify Messiah nothing can kill them nothing can destroy them no bomb no whatever whatever they have everybody who had the all them terrorists who was terrorized before he doesn't sleep that night then pass through easy easy you know why they had the right gifts and God will preserve and keep the right gifts on this planet Earth nothing couldn't stop it I like how much bombs put in line up praise God right now you you can humiliating put in a holy power gonna show his boss you know a lot of people feel the control the time and controlling things yeah are they just watch and see on time does unfoldings the controlling this and they're cutting it off and working and like them in power they're not Empower you know all that is in the human spirit playing games inside the mine but Brighton pump and Circumstance and everything else oh my so here we go now he receives that she never does it nothing can Hammer not even debt for if the sea be planted the water is up again Oh my he said I got a great Hallelujah here is the secret no understand this this is the holy spirit speaking to the prophet write these things so there's not a man thoughts this is Spirit giving words here's the secret the word is in the bride the minor Christ to know what he wants done with the word what does that mean the intelligence so he is prophesying that the word that I'm preaching now through the Seer age going to come into you and then the intelligence that is next going to come upon you a manta gonna come over your robe the spirit itself will come upon you and that spirit will show you to know what he wants done with the word Oh Glory to God to know what he once done with the word your glory to God the spirit itself have to tell you what he once done with the word that's why we need the intelligence oh hallelujah praise God praise God I'm gonna come here for babies you know you're the Holy Childhood is a child and cross the road and and things like that and wash the cars and yeah look at look left look right before you cross the road go there coming for that you know if you're talking about let us make man not let him make boys let us make man you know image and like this let him up to million praise God hallelujah God wanted one like him praise God I love what about Isaac said God heal and keep my healing like God stingy God they want to heal himself God doesn't need healing God doesn't need Redemption God doesn't need new kidney and you live and whatnot he doesn't need those things we need them kind of things so he want to release those things Oh Glory to God but he wants the leader to character to life glory to God what did Elisha do imagine God tell Elijah go and anoint that man into being instead what did he do he take the mantle and drop it in your mind and pull it off take about 10 years or so before he gets across Journal number one now writing what do we put the anointing about ticket off otherwise you're going dry I wonder if God still with you yeah you're feeling it and if you're feeling trouble for you have that day because God taking you to your wilderness go take you to your test Jesus had power Fire Fall upon him the anointed hit him okay so he charged up he charged but he charged when you step into the middle so no anointing him then he had to go to all of them it is written it is written and when he finished the Bible said the spirit of God returned he returned in what the party hit him again after he come through that dry spell after he tried to come to the test power of God hit him again and the power of God take him to the scriptures Isaiah 61 they say the spirit is now upon me I overcome the lust of the eyes overcome the lust of the flesh overcome the pride of life I overcome me some men want to hop all over others and they do up over themselves they have to take a seat praise God God give no man no power who have no power for himself Oh Glory to God you have that over you before God gave your power over others oh give the Lord some praises praise God when man get power he doesn't want to leave at all you know still in prison for life I'm thinking it permanently until God pulley rock on them is because they want they want to keep the money they want to keep everything going that's human I'll say my wife you know I recognize money still man you know still greedy still envious they're jealous he's smiling with you but you have a knife very bad days God bless you corrupted I mean when when when Samuel gets old someone says um he said what breathing he said keep the best for the Lord corrupt money they say kill everything kill everything you know I mean save some it's good good good view good lamb good meat good goat he said kill everything are we talking about men that come into full obedience this is a test of power you know when we could come into full obedience to what God tell it might look simple if I look small it might look little but he will test you to see if you will obey evenly Little Things another one of the big things of little things little things here's a secret the wood is in the bride won and the mind of Christ two to know what he wants done with the word she does it his name she has thus here the Lord so if I'm part of this bright I have tonight don't say the Lord because God sent a prophet with us here the Lord and if I receive him I have that I have the authority to check every man by the word to try every spirit I don't care what your name and your surname is it doesn't matter what name you have and how long in the message this is the word here and Paul said another angel from America and eventually come from Heaven one which threat back wings and say any other thing that what this will say crack your book your book you're gonna shoot you know blast it you know because that is of the word understand this he said this will come unto a razor edge think about it now how sharp you have to be in the wood there's no joking like the message is fighting baptism this is a message fighting message you never had before the but the battle is right inside prophecy two Spirits working not one working alone you know two of them working one trying to match up the church one trying to bring cold formal Spirits one trying to to dry up the anointing job the atmosphere nice people you know Anointed with spirits and the other one is the Holy Ghost one Spirit trying to bind the church to bring him on this objection to some overseas Bishop Liberty to preach and speak what they put upon the heart so the man of God no longer have the rights to speak what God lay upon his heart he had to check headquarters hello what they play tonight you blame that too and then God completely out of it you see this is what happened in Old Testament you know they was playing the tips every Saturday they were singing this song singing songs and they they're not even looking at the prophecy all them Bible scholars supposed to know all descriptions because I was looking forward to so when them tree wise men hit Jerusalem where is he they wasn't talking about um anybody um see him they had this stimulation Revelation upon them two years they they were like a pressure cooker and look looking at a lot of pressure so when I'm coming to Jerusalem they start to depressurize where is he they talk everybody excited people doing Market marrying giving them marriage do not cutting normal normal living until they come and shake up the whole place because their behavior is different then they recognize then fellas come from so far somebody has to be serious could you find what scripture what could they get that from why they behaving like that why are they talking about this revised Revival and them seven Thunders because we are hearing about this thing at all so long I am about Ukraine I bought Russia trilateral Council I hearing by Illuminati you know okay nothing voices at all them three wise men three wise men not two stupid man you know not three foolish my three wise men come and they come they're saying the Messiah no I BCB signing we see you stand he is and we come to worship we have come to debate with nobody we come to identify that the prophecy is now on the earth no Oh Glory the core that we are activating the spirit of Prophecy that was prophesied by the prophet America for oh glow it all give me a shout in the house hallelujah praise God one day we have to identify this is that that the prophet William Branham spake of and if this is not that we have tonight we're going to keep this till that come oh give the Lord I shall be keeping this we will keep the shout we will keep the fire we will keep the Praises we will keep the anointing until charity comes I change come okay the Lord send praises Hallelujah the secret is what the word is in the bride that is not man taught in ideas that told a bunch of ministers I ain't coming this message for someone to preaching ideas and the preaching the own thing and then they sprinkling like it is pepper sauce and salt of the Prophet on their sermon when they finish their drama the girl sprinkling you know I mean professors also and it gave her a sprinkling but we're going to release their message they're pumping them pumping their own thing they miss their own profits then I ain't for that channel I had taken that from me and I've taken that from my people oh give the Lord some Praises why why is it because the spirit and the prophet and the pride will say the same thing get the Lord a shout in the house let me say it again good the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say will already be said in the word they could read it man or get the Lord some Praises I feel good tonight but I can't really feel like praise God 20 years ago hallelujah praise God I feel God tonight Allah the devil's a liar tonight oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah the spirit the prophet the bright say the same thing oh Glory the god holds that the Spirit come upon the bride Lord let me get the double portion of your spirit Oh Glory to God when that seed within you is dead right oh give the Lord a shout when that seed were in you get stead right you're ready for the spirit Oh Glory to God the spirit brings the water to the ripened seat inside of you the secret is the words and the bride the word is a seed okay the Lord I shout hallelujah praise God praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God no fool yourself this satisfied with the books and tips and they figure as brother is actually under the spirit of entitlement that that entitles them to go any Rapture they are entitled to be fully received but believe in that foolishness they figure that because they have books and tips they're entitled to go in the Rapture that's a lie that comes from hell that have nothing to do with what is prophesied but I'm saying hear me Brandon Tabernacle you have to be talking displayed spirit did you have to see the spirit working not when I see church not when I see Elders not when I see pastors no no I was in a nice church group not that when I see the blood I'm gonna pass over you when I see the operation of the spirit I'm gonna pass over you oh glory to God give the Lord a shout in the house foreign God hallelujah this bride of thus say the Lord what she does it his name she has just say the Lord then it is traumatized so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it is grown and serve its purpose the Holy Spirit does what what is it that's what Rebecca did right now what the man of God prayed and said the servant says if the damselves that come and water my camel I'll give him what me get me water let that be the one for Isaac shout the water camel and give him water too hallelujah praise God and the prophet said the same word that you're worshiping watering it's the same spirit will take it to Isaac Oh Glory to God you have to be a genuine Holy Ghost Worship in the church we can't get around that just as we can't get the wrong brotherly kindness we could we can't get around that so much I hate us in this message now you don't even know if they're saved tell people who like and I'm not even sure they're saved if they ever had a revelation or experience of Salvation not that kind of behavior it is absolutely horrible it I've seen as an unbelievers be even better than that no excuses none none no excuses well he do this and he don't have none because Revelation 2017 is the bright expression of mercy and Grace an extension of life to whosoever Will revelation 22 17 is the key to the Jubilee the key to the Jubilee period the key to your loved ones being saved and delivered the spirit and the brights that come let him that heareth say come and whosoever will that is final Mercy only the spirit could do that people cutting you off they just want to shock this one is this this one is false this one is this and they're judging and they're judging the judging like they're playing God and the Bible said is somebody a cup of water they shall not miss the reward and these Jokers blame God trying to take people only book I gave them only book and the anointed and the people believe the foolishness I said that nonsense that they believe that the bride that little Club they have there that little cult that's the bride that the bride or what that was a brighter the man when he pulled their new brother Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ is Mrs Jesus Christ flesh of his flesh you could see her life in the scriptures you know they can line up with that you know she had no bad behave right you know rude and send back to your husband and wouldn't listen to this but you do a short thing and like by the word like let me let me go there tonight I just problems I can't just are you trying to go to life less friction I'm not looking for friction at all I'm looking for I keep on my part straight I'm not looking for create strict looking for friction looking for a fight you're looking don't worry we did no better in the early days you're looking fast forward when you see a sharp but when you study some Moody you're looking for somebody to clash with and his first person he come and they say any kind of police and foot everything caught up nobody guys it was it was actually root yeah but it gets like Scott oh boy that was crazy that was Zeal without knowledge that was that was not virtue no Spirit of Christ just sword fighters you know looking forward for The Clash right now looking back the hardest thing is when there are no way to fight they're looking for a fight and nobody fight they fight just them they're looking at themselves oh my so here's the secret what is in the bride minor cries coming down to know what he was done with the word so therefore there are things in the wood God wants us to do operate act on it act in feet that will try to have a little prayer line and what now we acting in feet believing that God will come down we don't know when he comes from this Temple for hundreds years to wait and nobody will come Johnny but become like a madman saying the accelerated with the tree there's one stand among you John know you have a Ministry born filled with holy ghost in his mother's womb he comes into the Messiah he knew what he calls to do he don't know who the Messiah is he said the one you see the spirit coming along and resting so people can rest and then disappear and leave rest leave rest leave rest leave the one remain so he only see the dove come and Jesus and remain they say oh God that's the one when she is coming to him he said you should baptize me that may be so but we need to fulfill righteousness oh my what happened the spirit is not resting they were not mad hated nobody can take it off you know nobody can hold that man that's why I'm saying the spirit coming upon you you know you have to confess the spirit of Elijah to press upon Elijah no all in school or prophets looking for my far off let them keep looking keep looking keep looking something coming something coming something keep your eyes keep your eyes we're not looking at you you look at us keep your eyes for yes somebody think I promise I'm too long it's stale somebody said I appreciate the same thing over and over yes I'm flipping the egg ball in the egg rolls in the egg is their leg It Will Rain the same thing we just we're just getting inspired with it like are you still assimilated from 1975 no I still stimulated Oh Glory to God I'm still looking for This Promise This dynamics of the mechanics this charity the right is absolute have you ever seen love manifested yet you hear about Anthony books and tapes but have you ever seen that yet think about it now whatever you're telling them people be done if I said die they die what not is I forgive you and the Holy Ghost poured out because God was so pleased with her son expressing the father's kindness oh give the Lord a shout in the house have you ever seen anything like that glory to God is there anything on the earth like that put somebody off finish what now do you finish up there finish you know you're gonna leave him how I get out when go open my name in the book who had he recently raise the name of the book think about it well if anybody see that woman in the world in heaven yesterday go and take a break go and buy some pizza somewhere go and buy some KFC or something or they can't handle whatever you know see this woman coming out the timing for more divisions but that woman name on the book and she's about to be released oh by the book itself oh Hollow when Jesus finished what she saw she said come see a man who told me all I did isn't this the Christ oh hallelujah look at the condition he went beyond the bone and the marrow go down your soul and see the seed inside the deer Oh Glory to God I meant he connect with that seed she was liberated no devil no Pharisee daughter no strike daughter could be better than she because her name is on the book oh can the Lord I shout if you never shout before Give the Lord I shout I am saying

time this is our season glory to God wait over them sons of God to be manifested when they backed up cancer back up tumor back up praise God coronavirus back up whatever it [Applause] two bees pigs and power oh give the Lord a shout Paul are going to confront plates [Applause] If You Preach anything and it's the gospel truth then God is obligated to vindicate that he said is that true can you say Amen now if that be so let the god that wrote the word this is if that be so let the god that wrote the word let the god that made the prophecy Let The God Who is God of the word comfort and prove that he is God that's the way we have to talk now Hallelujah where is the Lord God of Elijah praise God love that message okay the Lord I shout in the house hallelujah praise God as Elijah went up on the mountain watching Elijah Elisha went watching Elijah he said I wanted a proportion under Michael that wasn't Elijah fell upon Elisha He Walked on double that blanket struck the river where's the Lord God of Elijah and the scene then I haven't seen Elijah happy Elijah then but if I'm slipped in here the same gospel when he says don't like to hear this but we're still saying it the same power the same son of man that was yesterday is today and will be forever he boosted in it he said when I am gone healing is not gone when I am gone the angel is not gone the angel came with the book open One Foot In the Land one for the sea that's that part of Adam that's the angel that is Christ himself and seventh understood the voices out then in the days of the voice of the seven Angel but he shall begin the song that's Malachi 4 but right after that it has stopped there it's the voice Taste of the voice this is the voice there's a voice and the voice said go to Jacksonville all right the boy didn't say that go to New York didn't say that go to Africa go to America got it no go to the angel and say what give me the little book not go to Pastor Huli Ali no go to the angel and say give me the little book and I went under the angel said give me that book and I took the book and eat the book and he said Thomas prophesy again and that is what we have been doing all these years not preaching our own message prophesying again that of the same Prophecy of the same prophecy there's gonna be a price Revival there's going to be on point of the Holy Ghost there's gonna be Revival in Trinidad a seven ton of Revival in Trinidad there's going to be signs and wonders in Trinidad they're going to be a power of God wave after wave after wave fill a fire hanging over the building we'll give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God after prophesied for this church God prophesied for another church every man of the prophesied over their own church or give the Lord some Praises I have faith for nobody at church I have faith for the Believers that God put me to serve right here if I did the prophecy is still alive okay the Lord I shout is not my prophecy it's God's prophecy because it's a world prophecy hallelujah praise God Hallelujah are you ready we are done yet to know your feelings right we are done yet charge up here tonight I believe prophecy the time is coming the manifestation of the gifts that's give to every man the prophet with her I believe is it gives a wonderful we need him and respect them but I believe the time is coming when it's going to be a higher standard than that after these things are done away dark love will endure forever it's the love of God we'll be just standing preaching like this not playing taper not person player I want to identify what you're talking about here not touch close don't know we can't do this eh let me see it good not Church closing on this happening you get what I'm saying no good damn it right here we'll be standing preaching like this like this tonight or talking like this tonight and just the love will just settle over the building I didn't make that up the island dreamed that last night they still hear from God keeps his word oh give the Lord a prophecy hanging over your church Oh Glory to God I don't have to be standing anyone and ministers and anybody could be standing and love will just come down [Music] love God could use anybody anybody to stand and speak and love settle over the building Glory this is this bomb this is the day of preaching this is the day when we got to move in and get Sinners and pull them out that's what the preaching of the word is for it's for Sinners and bring them out and what he said when the last one comes in the door is shut oh praise God praise be to Jesus so therefore we must come truly into a real Spirit of forgiveness isn't that right and seventh under faith is based upon what forgiveness so brotherly kindness forgiveness opens the door to love you can't jump over that to get to the thing that can't feel you have to go through brotherly kindness and that opens the door of love to come upon you as the mantra no forgiveness means that you could put yourself in your brother's place on the matter so you could feel for him so that's all but Abraham operated when he was in India and he might come a blind the man of no shoes the first thing where I'm did was to take his shoes off to see if his foot could match the man to give the man his shoes he was feeling for the man he had that Spirit he asked him out of a Christian if he's a Believer and what nothing most like he might be a Hindu or whatever it is you get blind from looking at his son worshiping his son God gave back the money eyes and and I think but that's now he's talking about put yourself on the brother you don't worry about a Feeling and you don't know why he's so angry or so upset and why he treated you the way he's treating you and God sometimes allow things that way when he was making love in church God allowed that you know because God wants to know how he'll manage power is a powerful thing you know some of you want to know what people are having them give them power you will see what craziness inside is so God doesn't know if I have no crazies so you have to test you before power that's you with power to see what you will do even when he said your power to be buying the Mamba but be more sincere but Ram knew the mama couldn't affect him but he know the Bamba could kill the brother but God said be more sincere he didn't say if he'll be more sincerely get power I give you power but I want you to know the condition to really graduate with this power so the power have to grow with you Hallelujah Jesus ministry didn't start with Lazarus recently that you know it climaxed with that like when they could not live after Resurrection but he started with water to wine he started low and then go up high so when he hit Resurrection now they said No No all he will go after him let me kill him let me see you could sell him out and then they get Judas in the business they get a little silver thing now get some U.S and different things some euros get some punks today you know taking pongs euros and U.S who is Celio I kid you not still have them the God is still money Hallelujah let me tell you wrap up here now prophecy I believe the church is beginning here the message beginning to understand about friend so he was saying the channel to get into listen we have got to lay in the presence of the Sun not quote presence of the son we have got to be ripened what is he saying presence is what we're writing yeah watch this our faith isn't right intellectually we are hearing a message that God gave us seeing the signs that he showed us pruning by the Bible it is dear but holy church needs to lean on his presence till it tenders up and gets sweet in the spirit what he's talking about Spirit of forgiveness spiritually kindness till it gets sweet in the spirit so it can be done in my early days when I was sword fighting I know bathing down there you know it was blood it's a blood it was blood but they have a signature play with again I'm fighting them um computer games I forget what they call it this man fighting this one this one it was like that then like like the kind of combat some kind of comeback Mortal Kombat some kind of combat fight him just just clinging sword watch this you know but but seeing the signs here it's a so watch this the church need need to lay in his presence tell it 10 days up you know get sweet in the spirit so it can be done what is he saying that tendering is what's going to bring us any condition to being speaking things with God when that Thunder is not there is what is Grudge hit see somebody across the street yeah I want to shake the hand you have to tell nothing not even my greetings not even my season greetings big neighbor saying season greetings all believers say ingredients hello and Happy New Year and whatnot no happy new nothing you know so all of a sudden like I don't know if he wasn't human before we're humans said therefore you know I inquiring and you know I'm saying come on you know like remembering Ten Commandments the lady said those who are no strength or those who are no power Loveless Moses mother she wants you baby the woman claiming Moses to be baby she's mother too you fall on seeing them so people who love the pastor they love this other people love their Pastor too I mean they're crazy about it inside of here but I've been saying you know what I mean I'm saying that people have their own they support their own they love their own and whatnot Jesus disciples love their own thing too but Jesus tell them you have to exceed this kind of Pharisees you know because they love their own they treat each other nice and whatnot you have to love your enemies not that you have to love those who hate you bless them bless them bless them how could you get this experience if you don't have people doing hating doing the upsetting and mashing your corn it has to us these conditions are wrong that you could see what's going on in your spirit because you have to know how you come from swords man to sweet man oh you come from Salt to honey because the Honeys were gonna stick the Holy Spirit boil the trash out the church but the honey sticks it looked like it won't stick but it will stick sticky with love so the honey will stick charity and that's the only thing could take us out of here we cannot leave the Earth with brotherly kindness it will still fail but charity never fail at oh let's let's say no musician God please praise the lord we time has run on me and I'm now on page five you believe that my Jesus hear the prophecy now so till I get sweet in the spirit so you can be down sometimes you're speaking a message you get harsh after break it like that because you've got the Clinton name to make it whole but when the church once gets it the elected is called out and separated then in the presence of God where in the presence of God I know it will be something like that like the people was there when it takes the Rapture so before the Rapture comes they have to be the people get separated in presence oh Hallelujah my Lord no watch he said the Bible said called the illness that I'm Anointed with oil and pray watch he said well watch your your genuine faith will do it right there your genuine fit will make it so real to you look at that little woman with the blood issue if I can touch a part of His Garment I'd be made well and as soon as she did it she said she felt within herself that her blood issues stopped she actually believes it she said she wasn't hoping to be healed she knew without even getting a touch she knew something happened then but around said this now when she touched it to prove it stopped Jesus didn't say who touched me that perfect feet that same perfect Faith tonight will touch Jesus Christ just as it did them the woman come with a perfect for that time and we see at first the disciples didn't have this perfect fate they didn't have it because they had Christ walking with them but then afterwards Christ was in them so it's hard to have this perfect without the Holy Spirit it has to bring it so the Holy Spirit himself is what brings that perfect fate Oh Glory to God hallelujah oh glory to God I'm gonna wrap it up here it is he said they had power they had been given power to heal the sick to raise the Dead the castle that was refuted before that they had the power but not the Fate use the power there's the problem Tabernacle day of the church the bright today the holy spirit is here with the power but you haven't got faith to move it see what I mean it takes Faith to move it so the Seven Seas is the power but he puts seven Thunders on the back of the book to bring Faith to move the power when they reject the time there's a reject the Fate they can't connect with the power but Faith seventh on the faith which is based upon forgiveness going to connect with the power and you're going to see the power begin to work oh praise I do believe that he said no he said it takes Faith to charge it and throw it out there see what it takes perfect at night the power of the Holy Spirit perfect fate to ignite the power of the Holy Spirit which we have now since he come upon you Faith to ignite to see great things hallelujah praise God glory to God so knowing exactly oh my God I'm gonna skip that praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God so it takes Faith to operate these promises isn't that right brother Brown says at least I can kind of got speed up here now how would we see him Christ how would we see him question we have to see his spirit if he's in us that Spirit would have to do the same thing he did then or it wouldn't be the same spirit and he gave a script to fit I am Divine you are the branches if the branch is in Divine the branch will be the kind of fruit Divine produces and where the first Vine come forth was a Pentecostal branch of Visions Powers healings baptism the Holy Spirit great time and wonders the next man will have to be the same kind of branch Hallelujah glory to God so the spirit promise the spirit and the bride it's not just talk it's not a quote people had it in Alabama over the church Spirit on the bride that's just words I'm saying the spirit part have to be identified that you could say the spirit and the bride say Come Oh Glory they got same vision same life same works it's not right oh glory to God is not right the spirit say come and that come means you're not looking at this short dress for the short pants or the hot pants or whatever they're looking at any circumstances you're saying come because you have the right Spirit the spirit that speaks Mercy the spirit that speaks Grace the spirit that speaks love the spirit final Mercy before judgment Oh Glory to God is your approach it's the attitude What It Takes here's a woman touches garment she was healed with the blood issue a soldier spit on his face put a crown of thorns in his head felt no virtue it's your approach the attitude of what it takes that's what it is tonight dear friend it takes the attitude we are here we go and believe that we are in the presence of Jesus Christ but it's your attitude that brings the results the mechanics is here and so is the Dynamics if you can just get started God will do the rest so he already identified mechanics and Dynamics is already here oh give the Lord just shout in the house hallelujah praise God praise God praise God praise God let's just sweep it down hallelujah praise be to Jesus Glory so what did God do to Elijah
