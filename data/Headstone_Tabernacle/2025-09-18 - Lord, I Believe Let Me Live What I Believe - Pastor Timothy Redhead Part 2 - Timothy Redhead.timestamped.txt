[0:00] shot. So in the law firms and in these
[0:03] big places have a lot of things going
[0:05] on. So this person collapsed no
[0:08] complaint they can't find out were wrong
[0:10] all the scans coming back nothing and so
[0:12] that person had to travel and then
[0:15] another person went to the car
[0:18] I think that you know them keys start
[0:20] car outside
[0:21] &gt;&gt; maybe start the car went on the other
[0:23] side to put their back and when they
[0:25] open the car I think the car start going
[0:27] on the own. So when they realize what
[0:31] I'm more than for, they call me and ask
[0:33] me what to do. I said, "Please let this
[0:36] be the last time you all call me for
[0:38] this because I don't want that's not
[0:40] what I'm for. I am for the people in the
[0:42] church.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; You ain't even save.
[0:46] &gt;&gt; But people are doing what they want to
[0:48] do and then getting in trouble
[0:50] &gt;&gt; and then calling for help.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; But we are obligated to you."
[0:54] &gt;&gt; And in these things, I find out little
[0:56] secrets. And that's why I'm telling you,
[0:58] I challenge you. Do you really believe?
[1:02] &gt;&gt; And that is why for all these years you
[1:05] in Trinidad, what you're doing the
[1:07] message, you have 22 churches in a
[1:08] Trinidad in this little place. Do you
[1:11] know why you have 22 churches with one
[1:13] message book?
[1:15] It's because everybody thinks they know
[1:17] and they believe, but only to find out
[1:18] if they believe they would stay. And now
[1:21] people are exchanging membership cards,
[1:23] word from this church to that church,
[1:24] and all kinds of stuff flying around
[1:26] because they're looking for faith
[1:29] &gt;&gt; that is not there.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz faith is in the word, not in your
[1:33] mind,
[1:34] &gt;&gt; not in your head,
[1:35] &gt;&gt; not in your ideas. It is in the word.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; They have turned from the word
[1:41] &gt;&gt; to their own way.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; And we find now we have trouble in the
[1:45] church. So a lot of churches that look
[1:47] solid actually is solid with unbelief.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; Solid unbelief. And the Bible says when
[1:56] I come
[1:58] &gt;&gt; shall I find
[2:00] &gt;&gt; faith. Now if God saying that you better
[2:03] check that
[2:04] &gt;&gt; because I know a man saying that and he
[2:06] asked a question. It's not like he don't
[2:08] know what going on because he said shall
[2:09] I find and then we go back to brother
[2:12] Brandham quote if I find 12
[2:16] And then all of a sudden at that time
[2:18] when I just came in the message I could
[2:19] that couldn't tabulate 12.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; Now I'm down to five
[2:25] &gt;&gt; because a lot of things that you thought
[2:27] was solid,
[2:29] &gt;&gt; they're not solid, brother.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; And that is my worry as a minister
[2:33] because after preaching for all these
[2:35] years and you ask yourself, what do we
[2:37] have?
[2:38] &gt;&gt; Where is the church? You see the little
[2:40] church here?
[2:42] &gt;&gt; That might be the church.
[2:44] the little group
[2:46] &gt;&gt; that is stick to it
[2:48] &gt;&gt; and stays with it
[2:50] &gt;&gt; that speaks volume. But I still want you
[2:53] to be able to know God for yourself.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; You cannot survive on brother Isaac
[3:03] experience nor brother's experience. You
[3:06] have to have years for yourself.
[3:08] And the only way you could have an
[3:10] experience with God is to enter into the
[3:13] go the gates and into his sanctuary and
[3:16] into a relationship where you are
[3:18] talking to God and God is coming back
[3:21] and confirm the conversation.
[3:26] &gt;&gt; Otherwise you have nothing. No, you have
[3:28] no edge.
[3:31] &gt;&gt; You need an edge
[3:33] &gt;&gt; in this hour. Amen.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; The devil in joking
[3:37] &gt;&gt; not for what I see going on.
[3:40] &gt;&gt; So let's go into it now.
[3:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, how much time am I? Lord, all you
[3:44] put them watch on on pause.
[3:48] Now here's what the prophet said. Now we
[3:50] all know that cancer, tumor, cataracts,
[3:52] tuberculosis, all those things are not
[3:55] natural things. They are supernatural
[3:57] and are demons. Scripture plainly
[4:00] vindicates this. But this is demons in
[4:02] the body with growths. It got life in it
[4:05] and that life is a demon in the physical
[4:08] form. However, there are demons in the
[4:10] spiritual form that's in the soul. Same
[4:13] as they are in the body and some of
[4:15] these demons we see with our eyes with
[4:18] growths and so on. Now, every disease is
[4:20] a fourth dimension disease. The
[4:22] beginning of it you have seven
[4:24] dimensions and briefly I'll tell you and
[4:26] you know light and the various let me
[4:29] see if I have it here. Now many people
[4:31] with good thoughts, good people who try
[4:33] many times to rest upon some little
[4:35] theology, something they were taught
[4:37] since a child and still find that dong
[4:39] in their being is that soul they still
[4:42] have something that's not right. And
[4:45] whenever Christians are gathered
[4:47] together, you find people who has these
[4:49] spirits in them and it's undesirable.
[4:52] They don't want it. They say, "If I
[4:54] could only quit lying, if I could only
[4:56] quit lusting, if I could only quit
[4:58] this." And let me tell you between you
[5:00] and me lying is not you don't even get
[5:03] the idea. People are lying so easy that
[5:05] they're thinking is the truth
[5:08] &gt;&gt; and easy like that they say oh yes and
[5:11] after they gone you say is that a yes or
[5:12] a no. Well is a is a was a no. But why
[5:15] don't you go and make it right? And they
[5:17] walk away because they have come to a
[5:19] place where they are comfortable with a
[5:22] little lie
[5:24] &gt;&gt; with a little devil cuz even big yet
[5:27] it's still small.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; And I almost I always say if you can get
[5:31] caught in one area, what else is there
[5:36] that you are being cut with? Because it
[5:39] grows, it develops, it's a growth.
[5:43] There's demons, devils.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; No, I ain't come to take you onto your
[5:47] faith, but I'm coming to challenge you
[5:48] so that you will get real
[5:51] &gt;&gt; and stop coming to church because you
[5:53] should come.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; But come to church because you need to
[5:56] come.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; You need to see God. You need to hear
[6:00] from God. You need to connect with God.
[6:03] And as you get older, it should be more
[6:06] real.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; You're not getting young.
[6:12] And I say you got to know God for
[6:14] yourself. And there's even times where
[6:16] you do all that you have to do and God
[6:18] didn't answer. What do you do then?
[6:21] &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm saying Lord I
[6:23] believe. Help me to live
[6:26] &gt;&gt; what I believe.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; Are you getting it now? Cuz we need to
[6:32] get down into the crux. That's why I
[6:33] love brother Brennham. He went and check
[6:35] things.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; You can't hear a message and just say
[6:38] wonderful message. stand up and clap and
[6:40] then you go it and then the next day you
[6:42] are doing the exact opposite of what you
[6:45] heard that you said amen to.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; God didn't call us here to be
[6:51] hypocrites. He called us here to live
[6:54] what we preach, what we hear, what is
[6:58] said. Amen.
[7:03] &gt;&gt; Now, I heard brother uh Them talking
[7:06] about prophet
[7:08] who anybody that does anything that a
[7:10] prophet and it's sick,
[7:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[7:12] &gt;&gt; Something wrong with them?
[7:14] &gt;&gt; Because why would you do something that
[7:16] is going nowhere
[7:17] &gt;&gt; and it doesn't bring no benefit
[7:20] &gt;&gt; and there's nothing in it. Why would you
[7:21] do that?
[7:23] &gt;&gt; So, there has to be profit in your
[7:24] Christian walk. There has to be
[7:26] something that you could identify with.
[7:28] And if you didn't get it yet, aim to it
[7:32] &gt;&gt; because I'm saying to you, you can't
[7:33] just sit there and wala wala and die
[7:37] &gt;&gt; cuz you're going to die in your sins.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:42] &gt;&gt; All right, so let's move on. So these
[7:44] people behave like that and they don't
[7:46] really want to lie. They don't want to
[7:48] lust. There's another big one. And you
[7:51] have a lot of big old men in the message
[7:53] are lusting.
[7:55] Now I am a different preacher to brother
[7:57] to you. I just tell you black is not
[8:01] white.
[8:04] I mean not that he wouldn't tell you
[8:05] that but I I just go a little lower
[8:10] in Grenada. That's how we go. Go a
[8:12] little lower in Trinidad. Had to be
[8:14] careful because everybody's so
[8:16] knowledgeable and you know refined. In
[8:19] Grenada we in refined.
[8:21] All right. Now the Bible speaks of
[8:23] Jehoshaphat,
[8:25] king of Judah, visiting Ahab, king of
[8:27] Israel, and they buckle up together and
[8:30] made an alliance with each other to go
[8:32] fight at Ramagillion. But this they did
[8:35] without first praying. That's why you
[8:37] get to have you got to have to ask if a
[8:40] certain thing is wrong alone.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; You do it as long as you are questioning
[8:46] it, leave it alone.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Leave it alone.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Don't do it at all.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you know you are right
[8:52] because all things ought to be
[8:54] considered prayerfully. Then all other
[8:56] things will be added. If men and women
[8:59] could only get into the position where
[9:01] their soul and their thinking and their
[9:04] attitude will be perfect in the sight of
[9:06] God that would unleash one of the most
[9:08] powerful church in this hour.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; Because as I just preached in Grenada, I
[9:15] believe we are in a period of
[9:16] manifestation. Listen, there's no new
[9:18] message to come. You've been in the
[9:20] message for what? 40 years. You can't
[9:23] plant for 40 years.
[9:25] &gt;&gt; There's a time for planting.
[9:27] &gt;&gt; There's a time for growing and there's a
[9:29] time for reaping.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; And I believe we're in the hour where it
[9:32] is reaping. And people are being
[9:34] identified. When you see certain
[9:36] qualities coming out, that is their
[9:38] manifestation time
[9:42] because you can't be planting all the
[9:44] time and the word is a seed
[9:47] &gt;&gt; and seed is to grow. Amen.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; And there comes a time and remember
[9:51] there were two planters.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; There was the one that planted in the
[9:54] white and then the one that came in the
[9:56] back. He was in the black.
[9:58] &gt;&gt; They both planted
[10:00] &gt;&gt; and they both were growing. And he said,
[10:02] "Should I rip them up?" He said, "No,
[10:04] you going to pick up good fellas, leave
[10:06] them, let it grow together. Then at the
[10:10] end,
[10:12] I will send
[10:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not leaving it to you. I will send
[10:17] the angels and they will separate first
[10:22] the tears first the tears then I'll put
[10:26] the wheat in the Ghana but what am I
[10:28] doing with the chairs I'm buckling them
[10:30] are binding them and put them together
[10:33] there's a lot of madness going on in the
[10:35] message in Grenada where people gone
[10:36] back home
[10:38] &gt;&gt; they're serving God home the people are
[10:41] not doing communion anymore they're not
[10:42] doing feet washing anymore and many
[10:45] people stop Pay tithes.
[10:46] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; I hope you don't do that.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; A lot of people, oh God, they're doing
[10:51] suzu with God. If I pay this month, I'll
[10:53] pay next month. Oh, you could do that.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; Now, you see how you get quiet?
[10:58] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not living here, so I can
[11:00] afford to tell you that.
[11:04] &gt;&gt; But tithe is a critical part of your
[11:06] experience.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; And he says, bring the first portion.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; You don't pay God last, you pay him
[11:11] first.
[11:13] Similarly, communion and feet washing.
[11:15] He says, "Do it until I come."
[11:18] &gt;&gt; So, how so many people gone home then
[11:21] they I heard in another place they shut
[11:23] down the church.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; In Africa, a lot of churches are
[11:27] shutting down. What does that tell you?
[11:29] Wake up. Smell the coffee. It burning.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; What does that tell you? Look here. 20
[11:35] years ago, the place will be full.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; There's a sign. You need to wake up.
[11:40] Something is going on. We are in the
[11:43] village. We are in a place where there's
[11:45] going to be a shower. Where there's
[11:47] going to have a manifestation and it
[11:50] will be for the bride.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; For the bride,
[11:54] &gt;&gt; for those inside.
[11:55] [Applause]
[12:00] &gt;&gt; All that message have to go somewhere.
[12:03] Has to produce something. It can't go.
[12:05] He said it will not return void, but it
[12:08] shall accomplish that which I purpose.
[12:11] And when God purpose, there has to be a
[12:14] people. Behind the purpose, not some
[12:17] trees, not some animals, people.
[12:21] [Music]
[12:23] There has to be a body. There has to be
[12:26] a place. So if you're sick now is for a
[12:29] purpose so that you can get well. But
[12:33] you can't get well. doubting
[12:36] [Music]
[12:37] [Applause]
[12:38] those conditions come to drive us to
[12:41] God, pull us to God. We too complacent,
[12:45] be too relaxed. So situations come to
[12:49] drive you.
[12:52] Israel was driven in the wilderness.
[12:55] They didn't walk. They were driven.
[12:58] God's people are always driven by the
[13:01] spirit.
[13:03] Jesus was driven by the spirit in the
[13:07] wilderness. The spirit is in charge.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; God is loving. God is kind. God wouldn't
[13:17] give me a disease.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; But the enemy will drop one
[13:21] &gt;&gt; so that guy could go to God and say,
[13:24] "Look what he did.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; I want it off. I want to get rid of it."
[13:31] So he left a word for us.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; If you say
[13:37] &gt;&gt; not only that, whatsoever
[13:40] &gt;&gt; you desire,
[13:45] &gt;&gt; those things are for purpose. Those
[13:48] written words are for purpose. And
[13:50] there's a time for it to be fulfilled.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; All word must be fulfilled. All word
[13:57] must be fulfilled. And you and I are
[14:00] what you call waiting prophecies
[14:04] &gt;&gt; to fulfill what he said
[14:08] &gt;&gt; on whom the ends of the world are come.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; When I was here Sunday enjoying the
[14:18] word,
[14:19] &gt;&gt; you know, I think about people that go
[14:21] to church and they sit there doing jury
[14:23] duty.
[14:30] collecting information, watching here,
[14:33] watching there. No. Amen. No. Praise the
[14:35] Lord. They're there like like juries.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; Am I do I agree with what he's saying?
[14:41] Do I agree with what he's saying? Well,
[14:43] I can't remember that. Where is that
[14:45] quote?
[14:46] &gt;&gt; I can't st Where's the quote? Where's
[14:48] the quote? It in the Bible. Amen.
[14:51] &gt;&gt; If it in the Bible, then the courts are
[14:53] somewhere
[14:54] &gt;&gt; cuz the Bible is first then the courts.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham never lead us to the
[15:00] courts without the word.
[15:02] [Applause]
[15:06] &gt;&gt; All right, let me see if I listen. I'm
[15:08] trying to jump in place because I'm
[15:10] thinking about the time. But let's go.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; All right, so they they got together and
[15:16] they didn't pray. Now he says he could
[15:19] unleash one of the most pullful
[15:20] churches. Now they have I like this one.
[15:23] Brother Bham said they have a lie
[15:25] detector which is used to detect lies
[15:28] and you could get in there and try your
[15:29] best to make a lie. Sound like the
[15:31] truth. It will register negative all the
[15:35] time because the human was not made to
[15:38] lie.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Lying is deceitful. It's a hard thing.
[15:45] It's an evil thing. I would rather have
[15:47] hear the prophet. I would rather have a
[15:49] drunkard
[15:51] &gt;&gt; with me any day than a liar.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; And the father of lies is who?
[15:57] &gt;&gt; So why you lying?
[16:00] &gt;&gt; Why do we lie?
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Now I know you're feeling uncomfortable,
[16:04] but if you lie, you're not to worry.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Only worry when it's when it's true.
[16:13] No matter how sinful you are, you are
[16:15] still a fallen son of God. God did not
[16:17] intend for you to be sinful. He wanted
[16:20] you to be a son of daughter of his. You
[16:23] were made in his own image. And yes, his
[16:26] spirit is in you. But sin calls you to
[16:28] do these things. And no matter how much
[16:31] you try to impersonate and make a lie
[16:33] seem right, the detector will prove it
[16:36] wrong. Even if you tell the lie with all
[16:39] the innocence you got, it will still
[16:41] register negative. Imagine you're
[16:43] telling a lie and you're innocent.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; It sound like a oxymoron or or
[16:52] one of those words that you have a
[16:54] double meaning, but the prophet says
[16:56] with all the innocence yet is a lie.
[16:59] Yes.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; And I have seen that happen where people
[17:02] make confession with the best words.
[17:05] They put it together and it sound right
[17:08] but it was a lie.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; And only God could pick that up.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Now let's move on. So he says he said
[17:20] because God put in your subconscious
[17:23] down in the human being and it knows
[17:24] what is true. It's better than the lie
[17:27] detector machine. It does not need
[17:29] springs and wires all over your body.
[17:32] It's already wired by God to your heart.
[17:36] And while man may be able to fool a lie
[17:38] detector machine with a lot of practice,
[17:40] the subconscious dong in you set up by
[17:42] God cannot be fooled. It will detect a
[17:46] lie and register it up your
[17:47] subconscious. What am I getting at? When
[17:49] you tell God you believe
[17:53] &gt;&gt; and you really don't
[17:59] &gt;&gt; in pray
[18:02] &gt;&gt; if you didn't reach there yet said God I
[18:04] ain't reach yet help me to reach there
[18:06] like what the guy did. Lord I believe
[18:08] help me in my unbelief.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; So you can't pray a miss neither can you
[18:14] pray a lie.
[18:16] &gt;&gt; God know your heart. So if you're dumb
[18:18] right down, say, "Lord, I'm dumb right
[18:21] down."
[18:24] &gt;&gt; And that's why our prayers are not
[18:26] answered
[18:27] &gt;&gt; because we are not truthful. And God
[18:29] hates lies.
[18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now remember, I tell you, I from
[18:36] Grenada, we different. We down in the
[18:38] ground.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; All right.
[18:42] All right. So where am I now?
[18:46] So he says, "Now just think if a man or
[18:49] woman could ever get their thoughts."
[18:51] Sorry. Yeah. And their confession and
[18:54] their lives so line up with God until
[18:58] the channel of the Holy Ghost will be
[19:00] perfectly one with God. Imagine all
[19:04] those things that look impossible. It
[19:05] now becomes possible to them that
[19:08] believe. Why it's so line up where the
[19:11] freedom from their heart and faith from
[19:14] the inner man connects and you have a
[19:16] what an explosion of miracles and signs
[19:21] and wonders.
[19:24] Oh, we want we want to do miracles and
[19:27] we want signs and wonders with what that
[19:30] you have to get the training
[19:32] &gt;&gt; in prayer where God realizes that you
[19:35] know you nothing. Do you know why a lot
[19:38] of men in this message are not what you
[19:40] call uh prophets and doing miracles? God
[19:42] entrust them.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; Big egos.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; Why you think we have so many churches?
[19:49] Egos.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; Everybody want to be high. When when
[19:52] when Joshua died, you know what was the
[19:54] problem in Israel? Who in charge next?
[19:59] &gt;&gt; I heard brother Tio saying we had to
[20:01] die. And that is not a game
[20:04] &gt;&gt; because you might be saying, "Amen." But
[20:06] when it come to your thing, leave the
[20:08] thing alone.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; But the Bible tell us live for others,
[20:15] &gt;&gt; not for ourselves.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; I heard brother Isaac say that and that
[20:21] was powerful.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; Some of you old and will die alone
[20:29] &gt;&gt; because we only studying ourselves.
[20:31] There comes a time when even the money
[20:33] can't help you
[20:34] &gt;&gt; cuz you're so, you know, you're so
[20:36] obnoxious and you're so funny and stuck
[20:38] in your ways that nobody me don't want
[20:41] nobody live with me. You see me I funny
[20:44] funny
[20:46] and you a Christian
[20:48] and you don't even want nobody to come
[20:51] man go in the home
[20:54] then you fall sick and who you calling
[20:56] for brother one of them brothers see if
[20:59] they could come and stay with me for the
[21:02] night or one of them sisters one of them
[21:04] young one
[21:08] &gt;&gt; now you want help
[21:11] &gt;&gt; if you was living Right. They come
[21:13] without you asking for it.
[21:17] And that's why I love what he said
[21:19] because too much nonsense going on and
[21:22] re really true. I you know I came I was
[21:24] fellowship my brother and I you know I'm
[21:27] an observer. I like to observe things.
[21:31] All right. And I observe a lot of times
[21:33] I I say not much but I'm observing. And
[21:36] when I hear some of the stories in this
[21:38] message and what going on I don't want
[21:40] to know the rest.
[21:43] I don't want to know the rest. I ain't
[21:44] bright at dun. And if I get to know the
[21:47] rest, you're going interfere with my
[21:49] faith and my prayer. I want to pray
[21:51] free.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; I like to be free in my prayer. All this
[21:57] thing and this one did that and my God
[22:01] and wife and husband married together
[22:03] and husband saying I love you honey and
[22:05] you have another girl outside too light.
[22:10] The light to her and the lighter that
[22:12] one.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; Two light by one man.
[22:17] And did honey saying, "Well, yes,
[22:18] darling, I love you." And she making eye
[22:20] in the office.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; That right, brother Brandham. Trust some
[22:24] of them sisters in the office. They
[22:26] can't take pressure.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; Soon as they get, you know, you're a
[22:30] really pretty girl, you're nice. Wow.
[22:33] And that just gone.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; Where where is your feet? Where is the
[22:40] word? Where is your connection with God?
[22:44] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? We need to go back.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Husband and wife living like beasts
[22:50] &gt;&gt; home and like angels
[22:52] &gt;&gt; here.
[22:55] God bless. And you say, "Boy, them
[22:57] looking nice." And you now want to when
[22:58] I I want to be like them.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; You know what going on? You know what
[23:04] going on? Do you know razor bleeding
[23:06] cutting home is worse?
[23:13] And a lot of people you think in love,
[23:14] not in love, they in trouble.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; We need to get back to the word. Get
[23:20] back to our relationship with God. Get
[23:22] back to holiness. Get back to where it
[23:24] makes sense.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Why? Why all that drama?
[23:30] You know, no profit in it.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; I mean, come on.
[23:37] You don't have a short life already.
[23:39] You're making it worse by having an
[23:40] enemy in your house and eating her food.
[23:44] You crazy.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Now he's taking chances and the devil
[23:54] already telling them thing.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; You're taking that,
[23:59] you learned that pass.
[24:04] But I'm telling you and a lot of us, you
[24:07] know, we act like if all is well. Some
[24:09] of us ain't even sleeping.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Anxious worries and you're saved. You
[24:18] and God have a connection.
[24:21] Paul says these things don't move me.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Lying vanities.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; I heard brother Terry voice. Is he here?
[24:29] &gt;&gt; Man, I was behind him Sunday. I have a
[24:31] little time, but I had to say this. And
[24:33] I was enjoying myself. I didn't know the
[24:35] brother could have dance.
[24:38] That brother had me going. I don't I
[24:40] can't do it. But he was dancing for me.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; I love him.
[24:47] Praise God. God open that eye.
[24:52] [Applause]
[24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:57] Glory.
[25:02] Amen. This God I serve can do anything.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; It's just that we limit him by not being
[25:08] genuine.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, help me. I'm going. Let me keep
[25:15] going. Just think if a man or woman
[25:17] could get their thoughts and their
[25:19] confession. You hear it? Thoughts and
[25:21] confession line up
[25:23] &gt;&gt; with the word.
[25:27] You can't be saying one thing in your
[25:29] confession, saying another thing in your
[25:31] prayer and your thoughts
[25:33] &gt;&gt; another place.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; The world better than us.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; Because we supposed to be having more
[25:42] wisdom,
[25:44] &gt;&gt; but we letting the devil mess us up.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Stop the double life.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Live true. Live right. Live according to
[25:53] the word. And if you can't live it, say,
[25:56] "Brother Tio, I need help."
[25:59] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's a deacon, trustee,
[26:01] or whatever um position you have in the
[26:03] church. Position have nothing to do with
[26:05] demons.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; And demons are very smart. They stay
[26:13] hide and they quiet and they don't make
[26:15] trouble until you're alone.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; You think a devil going to come and you
[26:20] come to church and wake up and make you
[26:21] behave on the way? No. die for when you
[26:23] get home. Die when you're home with him.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; You're only fooling yourself when you
[26:30] come to church and you're not in it.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; I hear them men preaching. Those
[26:34] brothers here preaching, you should be
[26:36] glad you have a man of God like that.
[26:39] [Applause]
[26:43] &gt;&gt; And don't you know, anyhow, let's move
[26:45] on. So many people come to the altar to
[26:47] be prayed for with intellectual faith
[26:50] and claim to have confessed their sins
[26:52] and they believe it in their mind. They
[26:55] believe it because they heard it. They
[26:58] believe it because they know it the best
[27:01] policy. But somehow they seem to miss
[27:04] the mark. And I'm saying to you, this is
[27:07] something I found out and I found it in
[27:09] my church where people are telling me
[27:10] one thing and living another. And it's
[27:13] not that they want to do that, they
[27:15] can't help it.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; And you say, breth, why? Because they
[27:20] were not fully surrendered. If you're
[27:22] not fully surrendered, God ain't come in
[27:23] and give you everything.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; You get what you give.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; You want a quart of God, you get it.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; He walk with you with what you give him.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; You remember the the message brother
[27:36] Brennon preached with the woman with the
[27:38] alabaster box of plate. You you you get
[27:41] what you give and then we just blame the
[27:43] message and blame this and I find I
[27:46] ain't seeing God and I ain't seeing God.
[27:47] How you going to see God when you're
[27:48] blind?
[27:50] You ever see a blind man see?
[27:54] &gt;&gt; Blind as a bat and you want to see God
[27:56] and you seeing this and you seen signs.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to see signs if you're
[28:01] on God and connected.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; If I didn't seen signs, you think I've
[28:05] been in the message? The message holds
[28:07] me.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; I don't hold it.
[28:11] God holds me.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; I don't hold him.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; Some people say, you know, they come to
[28:16] God and say, "Boy, I just hope and pray
[28:19] that all goes well." I ain't saying
[28:20] that.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Hear what I saying.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; If the world is so attractive that the
[28:26] enemy trying to pull me back, I dead
[28:28] first
[28:31] &gt;&gt; by my feet.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; You can't say that. Just so you know cuz
[28:34] as you say death you start to trembling
[28:38] and you start to do all kind of thing.
[28:40] But I am so serious about my faith that
[28:43] I would die than go back.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; When you have an experience with God you
[28:52] think you will go back.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; That's what you need and it's real. If I
[28:56] could get it, if a nothing like me could
[28:59] get, what's stopping you?
[29:06] &gt;&gt; We need to come off our high horse. Come
[29:08] down that horse, get a donkey or
[29:09] something and and get you change ways.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Remember, there's mental faith and
[29:16] supernatural faith. Both cometh by
[29:19] hearing.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Both cometh by hearing. But the key is
[29:24] hearing who? Cuz remember Wild Brother
[29:28] preaching, the devil preaching to him.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; That is why a lot of people just be
[29:33] watching him so
[29:35] &gt;&gt; under their glasses,
[29:40] &gt;&gt; wondering what he mean by that.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; And I told him already his voice louder
[29:44] than mine. I love that. The devil can't
[29:46] take noise. He just get confused.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; So we're keep blasting it here. Don't
[29:53] ease up at all. cuz them devils and them
[29:55] in feeling sorry for you.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Nobody, let me tell you, the harder I
[30:00] preach home is the closer them people
[30:02] get, the tighter they believe. If I go
[30:05] there, listen, if I come by you and I I
[30:07] giving you baby food, a big old 25y old
[30:10] man and I say, "Okay, try and take this
[30:11] here. Here is some conflicts." And I
[30:14] giving you conflicts with a spoon.
[30:16] There's a conflict. What you behave
[30:17] like? You won't be say
[30:25] you act like a child cuz I treat you
[30:27] like a child.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; But if I throw the conflicts and I say
[30:31] eat some cuckoo
[30:34] &gt;&gt; and dashing and fig and them thing that
[30:37] is hurt teeth,
[30:39] &gt;&gt; what you think got them teeth for?
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So you that's why
[30:46] brother Brennham you ever hear brother
[30:47] Brennham preach a easy message
[30:50] &gt;&gt; you ever listen to him I don't stop my
[30:53] tape all during the night I have him
[30:56] playing when I wake up I hearing him
[30:57] when I go to sleep I hearing him
[31:00] &gt;&gt; that's my life
[31:01] &gt;&gt; and I talk it live it
[31:04] &gt;&gt; some of you as soon as church done you
[31:06] done
[31:08] &gt;&gt; anyhow let me keep going because you're
[31:10] pulling me off all your
[31:13] &gt;&gt; all you behave yourself
[31:17] In most cases outside in our head is a
[31:20] knowledge of God. But inside the heart
[31:22] is a demon
[31:23] &gt;&gt; doubting.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Listen good.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Listen good.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; You have a knowledge. Everybody have a
[31:30] knowledge. You have a Bible. You read it
[31:31] 15 times. What has it done for you?
[31:36] &gt;&gt; And in in Trinidad, everybody know the
[31:38] message. They've been in the message
[31:40] even when the message was still coming.
[31:43] Hallelujah.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; We don't have that that thing. I It's so
[31:46] much of us in Grenada. Maybe I were
[31:47] three or four. You used to be 60 going
[31:49] down to about two now.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; As the time going, people just in
[31:53] getting they just tired. And you'll see
[31:56] it here when people just get tired. Why?
[31:59] Their faith run out of gas.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Their faith tired.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; How much of you struggling with coming
[32:07] to church and you're coming up say, "Oh
[32:10] god, the arthritis." What arthritis?
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; If you had arthritis, you'll still be in
[32:15] bed.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; What arthritis? When you come into
[32:19] church, you want to hear about God. And
[32:20] if you know God, you running up the
[32:22] step.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; All right, let me keep going. So I
[32:30] believe divine healing is real, but it
[32:32] is not for me or how can I get it if the
[32:36] doctor says this or the doctor says
[32:38] that. So outside you admit it but inside
[32:42] your conscience quietly register. I
[32:45] know. Well, let me have some secret for
[32:47] you. If you sick bad and you need
[32:48] deliverance and you don't give God
[32:50] everything, you go dead.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Try and get accustomed to us in Grenada
[32:58] die. Stop
[33:02] &gt;&gt; and you don't want to die. So you have
[33:04] no choice. Hear me. You have no choice
[33:07] but to live.
[33:08] Let me tell you a secret. People who say
[33:11] they committing suicide,
[33:13] you know how to find out if it's true?
[33:16] Bring them in the ocean and let them go.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Throw them overboard. The mount of noise
[33:22] and the mount of balling and the mount
[33:24] of swimming. I thought you don't want to
[33:26] death.
[33:29] Not that they want a rope that you could
[33:31] just quit but to be swimming where you
[33:33] have to make an effort. I thought you
[33:36] don't want to dead. Try it.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; People just talk.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; But when reality come,
[33:44] &gt;&gt; it's a different story. Hear what God
[33:45] says. Love your enemies.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; You you you have enemies.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; And there are Christians say, "I have no
[33:52] enemies, but you talking to that one,
[33:53] you passing by them." And you make sure
[33:55] when you see them, you bounce.
[33:59] How many times you see a sister coming
[34:00] and you're just gone in a sto
[34:04] &gt;&gt; and as she gone you just back out and
[34:06] you're walking past
[34:11] &gt;&gt; you get the picture yet you will tell
[34:13] people you're not no enemy. Why? Because
[34:14] I the right thing to say
[34:16] &gt;&gt; in reality
[34:17] &gt;&gt; not true.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Not true.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; And you see me I can't handle fake.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; I hate fake.
[34:27] I believe in reality
[34:29] &gt;&gt; and that's why if you have a problem you
[34:31] and wife you think and you all have a
[34:32] problem go and pray if too all you can't
[34:35] pray together because the tension so
[34:37] great come and say we in trouble
[34:40] &gt;&gt; and then many don't want to come to
[34:41] Braio because we don't want to know as
[34:43] if he know you think he will tell you
[34:45] everything
[34:47] &gt;&gt; you think God will have a pastor that
[34:48] don't know what going on with the people
[34:50] &gt;&gt; I mean I shouldn't tell you that because
[34:52] I pastor secrets but
[34:55] the holy The spirit doesn't reveal
[34:57] things.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; So the best way to do is don't hide.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; I hate hiding.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Expose the devil.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; And what I'm telling you going all over
[35:08] you think you say in Trinidad your you
[35:11] have marriage doing fine. All marriage
[35:12] under pressure right now.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Right now the most common thing is
[35:16] divorce. Divorce. Divorce. It's like a
[35:19] song. It's like a pandemic.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Why? Satan has invaded. Satan know his
[35:25] time is up. So he's making a a quick
[35:28] short work. Why? Because he heard God is
[35:31] making a quick short work. And he's a
[35:34] full fashion. He's an imitator.
[35:36] Everything God does, he comes up with a
[35:38] plan for it.
[35:40] [Applause]
[35:44] &gt;&gt; And God help you. If you have too much
[35:46] knowledge,
[35:47] &gt;&gt; he can't help you.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:52] And a lot of times people don't want to
[35:54] change. They so fix in their ways.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Right now some of you switch off.
[36:02] I don't reach 60 already. Me can't
[36:04] change now.
[36:06] You might think hell nice. There we go.
[36:10] So hear this. Oh, if I can get it. The
[36:12] doctor says this or that. So outside you
[36:14] admit, but inside your conscience says
[36:15] no. Mark 11:20. So faith is a staggering
[36:19] thing to many people and we ought to be
[36:21] ashamed of ourselves to confess that we
[36:23] don't have faith in God. Brother Bren,
[36:25] I'm saying that not me.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; We don't have to. I prove that.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Go when the hour come to prove it. We
[36:32] running.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; We going somewhere else. I'm talking to
[36:36] you. Put your mind in there.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Your mind somewhere else.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; So,
[36:50] brother um the prophet says an
[36:52] experience. So, you have faith in God.
[36:54] Usually people with faith are people who
[36:56] have experience and experience only
[36:58] comes by a life
[36:59] &gt;&gt; and I say a life of prayer and
[37:01] communication between you and God.
[37:03] Experience bring faith. Hence Jesus said
[37:05] in John 3, except a man be born again.
[37:07] You know what born again means?
[37:09] &gt;&gt; All right. Don't do like Nicodemus. He
[37:11] cannot understand the kingdom of God. He
[37:14] what that means he cannot see.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; See what what the word says what the
[37:19] word means. Yeah,
[37:21] &gt;&gt; you know many time Jesus tell the
[37:23] disciples thing and they say they
[37:24] believe and then later on he had to pray
[37:26] them for their hardness of heart. It's
[37:28] not we the first one it happened. It
[37:30] happened ever since time memorial. His
[37:33] disciples did not believe he rose.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; So don't feel bad. What we had to do is
[37:41] break it. What we had to do is defeat it
[37:44] &gt;&gt; because you've been given the tools.
[37:47] [Applause]
[37:49] Don't come every day and get the tools
[37:51] and put it in your bag and pack it up.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Use it.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; What is the problem with the church?
[37:58] Lack of faith, lack of experience, lack
[38:00] of prayer. Why? You do it for me.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; We like old Roman Catholics.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; We leave the church, but we didn't leave
[38:08] the doctrine. I can't do God for you.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; You ought to do God for yourself.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, I find time to pray, but you can't.
[38:18] My you ready yet?
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Hello. Is only one Mary. Haven't you
[38:22] gone?
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Let me move on. So the word says, see,
[38:29] it means to understand, not to look with
[38:31] your eyes. So being born again is
[38:33] connected
[38:35] to understanding what you hear.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; And the word of God says faith cometh by
[38:40] hearing. Let me tell you, if we really
[38:42] were taking all the word we receiving,
[38:43] the rapture gone already.
[38:45] Some of us have been doubting the
[38:47] rapture. Why you think God being
[38:48] merciful, not willing that any should
[38:50] perish, but giving you an opportunity,
[38:53] giving you another chance? Because he
[38:54] knows what is in man.
[38:57] [Applause]
[38:59] &gt;&gt; He knows what is in us. He know how we
[39:01] up and down.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Up and down the deck. We only moving up
[39:05] and down. Stay.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Glory. Up and down the deck. We can't
[39:15] sit down and we can't settle.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; When you believe something, stay with
[39:19] it.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, don't come for prayer.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; If you believe God could heal you, stay
[39:24] with it. And let me tell you, healing is
[39:27] not miracles.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Healing is something that takes a
[39:32] process.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God want you to get
[39:35] stronger when it is gone.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding that? So, there
[39:42] are things your body need. When he
[39:43] healed the girl, you say, "Give her some
[39:44] food or give her some water or give her
[39:47] something." Because why? That was
[39:49] connected to her going.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; So you lose nutrients, you lose things.
[39:53] So when you recover, so when you
[39:55] recovering, God is the person is the one
[39:58] that's bringing your recovery, that's
[39:59] bringing your healing. But you have to
[40:01] stay with it.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Why do I stay with it, brother Tim?
[40:06] Because God said, "No, you
[40:08] &gt;&gt; you Why we don't believe?" Because we
[40:10] figure he's weak to do the work.
[40:12] You can't help God.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; You can't even know what going on in the
[40:16] next 15 minutes you could help God.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; So leave the healing to him. Leave the
[40:21] work to him. God said it. I believe it.
[40:25] That settles it.
[40:27] [Applause]
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; So that's why he said, "He that have to
[40:35] hear,
[40:36] &gt;&gt; let him hear." Not all who have. He that
[40:40] have not this thy lobe
[40:44] &gt;&gt; the air is in the heart
[40:46] &gt;&gt; cuz the heart have ears to hear the
[40:49] word.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look all this exercise we've been
[40:54] having spiritually. What have we learned
[40:56] spiritually?
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; We still day in the in the world of
[40:59] touch, taste, smell, and feel.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Trust God.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; The Lord say, "Love your enemies. do
[41:07] good to them that hate you and
[41:08] despitefully use you. Pray for them.
[41:11] Give them a gift.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; I was at work one time and the young
[41:15] lady who I working with and we were
[41:17] talking and then she talk about
[41:18] something. I said well I'm a Christian I
[41:20] to you and she get mad.
[41:23] I shouldn't tell her that. So she tell
[41:25] me get off her office. I say come and
[41:27] move me
[41:29] teasing her because me can't fight
[41:32] and she get mad and she and she say all
[41:35] kind of thing. I leave and I go in
[41:36] tongue and I buy a card and a cup about
[41:40] God's blessing and wonderfulness. We
[41:43] best friends now
[41:47] because I can't carry I can't carry
[41:49] grudge. You know how heavy that is.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Do you know how heavy that is? That
[41:55] would just Why you think just bring up
[41:57] your pressure
[41:58] &gt;&gt; besides normal thing in the body?
[42:02] Hey, and that's something I had to talk
[42:04] about. You're taking pressure tablets
[42:05] and you suffer you go down.
[42:08] Where you going?
[42:11] So who fooling who?
[42:14] I mean I can't even trust the doctor.
[42:20] And you tell him I make sure I take it
[42:26] &gt;&gt; and God tell me whatsoever
[42:30] &gt;&gt; I desire. What desire means? Having a
[42:33] strong feeling. We only have strong
[42:37] feeling when we when something gets
[42:38] serious.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; But if you have a strong desire and you
[42:42] go and pray,
[42:45] &gt;&gt; you expect to get results. But where is
[42:47] the secret, brother Tim? Because I had
[42:48] to cut short.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you where the secret is. We
[42:51] go and pray.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Forgetting the ought that we had against
[42:57] our brother because he said when you
[42:59] stand praying,
[43:01] &gt;&gt; you got to connect the verses.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; When you stand praying, forgive.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; That is connected to when you have a
[43:07] desire.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; So when you have a desire and you
[43:11] forgive,
[43:12] then you could believe so that you can
[43:16] receive. So don't expect to get nothing
[43:19] from God and you and your brother ain't
[43:21] talking and you breaking word.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; You got to make it right.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; That is a secret.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; God is holy.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; God willing to heal you more than you
[43:35] want to get healed. But he cannot handle
[43:37] sin.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; And what is iniquity?
[43:42] &gt;&gt; What you know you shouldn't do and
[43:43] you're doing it. If you have ought means
[43:46] grievance,
[43:47] complaints, offense,
[43:51] issues,
[43:53] &gt;&gt; fix it.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; A lot of people are dying today because
[43:56] they have grievian. Yes.
[44:00] When I came to the Lord, I has to find
[44:01] everybody and fix it.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; I cannot knock about. I imagine my best
[44:07] friend. Oh, God. Confession is good. I
[44:09] had to go and tell him, "Boy, I was
[44:10] interfering the wife." And I don't want
[44:13] to tell him,
[44:15] &gt;&gt; "You think I could be preaching now if I
[44:16] fix that?"
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Or you to make that look as if, well,
[44:20] you know, he's betraying me and God.
[44:21] That is a lie.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; So I didn't tell him I sorry cuz when I
[44:26] was out there, the devil was trying to
[44:27] destroy me.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; I didn't know that.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; I thought I was blue boy.
[44:36] Any I know you had to go to work, but I
[44:39] here to tell you this. If you fix the
[44:43] and you believe, what's the next thing?
[44:46] You will receive.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Bow your heads and pray. And if you have
[44:58] anything that you need to fix when the
[45:00] service is over, fix it. If you've been
[45:02] not doing your sacraments that the word
[45:04] says, then fix it. But may God help us
[45:08] so that we could rise from here. I heard
[45:10] your pastor saying, "We expecting great
[45:12] things." Great things don't come unless
[45:13] we fix small things.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; So, let's fix it. Let's make it right.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Let's deal with God as a holy person,
[45:24] not something that God is a spirit
[45:26] &gt;&gt; and they that dealing with him must deal
[45:28] with him in spirit and in truth.
[45:31] If that is your desire, you stand to
[45:33] your feet and say, "Bim, I need prayer."
[45:36] That God will deliver me from doubts,
[45:38] from unbelief, and that God will help me
[45:41] going forward to be victorious. And if
[45:44] you mean it, you will receive it.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Father God, I thank you for the little
[45:49] time we have. It flies so fast. But I
[45:52] pray that you will help the people as
[45:54] you have helped me and help them to see
[45:57] the significance of prayer, the
[45:59] significance of making things right, the
[46:01] significance of confession with truth
[46:04] and the significance of believing you.
[46:07] Then miracles will happen, things will
[46:10] take place cuz we overthrew for these
[46:14] moves of God. So we bring those things
[46:16] and we say Lord these things you said we
[46:19] will receive them. Give them mercy's
[46:22] journey as they go. And me too, Lord.
[46:25] And bless this tabernacle as you have
[46:27] been doing. And continue to anoint your
[46:29] brothers, the brothers here and sisters
[46:31] and the people and draw them closer to
[46:34] you. Bless the word and bring it. Let it
[46:37] bring forth fruit cuz it cannot return
[46:39] void is my prayer in Jesus name. God
[46:42] bless you. I love you. Until we meet
[46:44] again.

[57:13] us this word in this hour. Lord, Father,
[57:16] when so many people are feigning
[57:18] Christianity
[57:19] and failing so many things, Lord,
[57:22] brought a message tonight for us to be
[57:24] real with you tonight, Lord, for us to
[57:25] be sincere, to open up our hearts,
[57:28] really examine ourselves, and ask
[57:29] ourselves the question, do we really
[57:32] believe? Father, we pray tonight, dear
[57:35] God, that you would bless, Lord, your
[57:38] servant, Beretta, tonight, Lord, in a
[57:40] special way. May you raise him up, may
[57:42] you anoint him. May you clothe him with
[57:45] a fiery reality of the supernatural
[57:48] presence of God from this time forth.
[57:51] May you take him a level higher there,
[57:53] God.
[57:55] We anoint him and bless him, Lord, for
[57:57] the journey that yet lays ahead,
[58:00] Lord. here. Uh bless the people over
[58:01] there in Grenadia, Father, the church,
[58:03] Lord, and believers. You raise them up
[58:05] in strength to deal with the the issues
[58:08] of life, Lord, and the things that we
[58:10] got to deal with. Lord, while we on this
[58:12] earth, Lord, we're just holding your
[58:14] hand, Father. We're just praying that
[58:16] you lead us on, Father. Continue to lead
[58:18] and guide him and the church and
[58:21] everyone else, Father. We commit them
[58:22] into your hands. Lord, we thank you for
[58:24] the word of God tonight that has found
[58:26] its place in our hearts. We believe by
[58:28] faith tonight at hands. We pray, oh God,
[58:30] that you would examine us, Father, as we
[58:32] examine ourselves, oh God, in the mirror
[58:35] of the word, Lord, to see, Lord, if we
[58:37] really do believe, the things that we
[58:39] confess, Lord, the things that we say
[58:41] that we confess. Father, we don't want
[58:43] to just sound nice, Lord. We want to be
